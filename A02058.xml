            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

                     r. 14.9. it ſeemeth by the words of our Sauiour Chriſt in the Goſpell, that thoſe actions do chiefly continue our name and memory in the world, which are performed vpon

Chriſt and his ſeruice: and that it is an iniurious and malicious practiſe, to conceale and ſmoother the bounty of thoſe, who haue beene liberall in contributing to Chriſtian and Religious exerciſes. Foraſmuch therefore as you haue powred your coſtly oyntment vpō Chriſts head, more aboundantly than many other of your place and order, you may perſwade your ſelfe, vpon the ground of Chriſts owne rule, which is infallible, that you haue layd a ſure foundation for your name and memory, as long as the world endureth: and you haue alſo giuen iuſt occaſion to thoſe that haue taſted your large benignity, to giue the world knowledge thereof, to the end that others may bee mooued by your commendable example, to practiſe the like godly actions &amp; they that are not able to imitate you

in performance, may yet prayſe God for you, and pray vnto God long to preſerue you, for the further good of his Church, and the benefit of this gouernment wherein you are a Magiſtrate.
            To imitate you in performance, is neither the will nor power of many: yet I freely profeſſe my ſelfe to bee one of thoſe, which both praiſe God, and pray vnto God for you, being obliged thereunto, by receyuing ſome porcion of my maintenance, from your large contribution to the Lecture at Saint Antholines, where I am one of the morning Lecturers. In which regard, I haue preſumed to preſent to your Worſhips patronage, theſe my poore labours ſometimes preached there. If they may carry acceptation from you, and bring profit to any ſoule, I ſhall be

abundantly ſatisfied. Howſoeuer, I commend their ſucceſſe to GOD, their patronage to you, their vſe to the world, deſiring euery one, into whoſe hands this Booke ſhall come, as to take knowledge of your goodneſſe, ſo to pray for your euerlaſting happineſſe. Amen.
            
               
                  Your Worſhips in all reſpectiueneſſe, Robert Gray, 
               one of the Morning Lectures at S. Antholins.
         
         
            
            To the VVorſhipfull Maſter Boothby, Maſter Iay, M. Venn, M. Moody, M. Dorington, M. Sprot, M. Moore, M. Waſhborne, M. White, M. Smith, of the Pariſh of S. Antholins London, and to all the deuout and zealous hearers of the Morning Lectures there, Grace, mercy and peace bee multiplied with God the Father, through IESVS CHRIST.
            
               
                  SALOMON ſayth, that there is a time for all things. The wiſdome of man therefore, is, to know his time, &amp; for all ſuch actions as hee vndertakes, to make choyce of the fitteſt, &amp; moſt commodious time, to effect and bring them to paſſe. In worldly things which are moſt agreeable to our nature, we account the Morning the beſt &amp; moſt conuenient time

of all the day beſides: for reaſon &amp; experience do teach vs, that in the morning our memory is the quickeſt, our ſences the readieſt, our natural powers the ableſt, being reuiued, as it were, &amp; hauing recouered freſh ſtrength &amp; liberty, by reaſon of that ſweet ſleepe, and comfortable reſt, wherewith they were repoſed the night paſt. And therfore the Student for his ſtudy, the traueller for his iourney, the labourer for his worke, and euery man in his place and calling, for ſuch proiects as hee hath, chuſeth the morning, as the fitteſt time, not onely to beginne, but alſo to further their enterpriſes.
            If therefore in things which are agreeable to nature, wee vſe the morning, as an helpe to further

vs in our actions, much more ſhould wee make choyce of the morning, for thoſe things which are leſſe agreeable to nature, or rather contrary to nature, yea indeed, aboue nature, of which kind is praier, &amp; hearing of the word of God: for nature doth not ſtirre vs vp to prayer, neyther doth nature waken vs early in the morning to heare the word of God. Prayer, and hearing of the word, go with our nature, as againſt the ſtreame: and therefore it is very neceſſary, that the firſt thing that comes to our eyes in the morning, ſhould be the Temple, the firſt thing that comes to our eares, ſhould be the word of God, and the firſt thing that comes to our minde, ſhould be prayer and thankeſgiuing, that ſo we may walke with Eliah, al the

day after, in the ſtrength of thoſe things which wee haue heard out of the word of God: and ſo wee ſhall vſe our callings more carefully &amp; conſcionably, we ſhall be directed what to doe, and what to leaue vndone, and whatſoeuer we doe, we ſhall do all things the better to Gods glory, and the poſſeſſing of our owne ſoules continually in peace and patience.
            And truly, if wee conſider the practiſe of the Saints of God, wee ſhall find, that they haue obſerued the morning, as the fitteſt time for the exerciſes of their piety &amp; deuotion.
                  Gen. 22.3 Pſal. 119 147, 148. 1. Sam. 1.19. 
               Abraham roſe very early to ſacrifice his ſonne. Dauid preuented the morning light, &amp; cryed: his eyes alſo preuented the night watches, to meditate in Gods word. Elkanah and his houſhold

aroſe vp early, and worſhipped before the Lord in Shiloh.
                  Eſay 56.9. And the Prophet Eſay in the perſon of the faithfull, ſaying, With my ſpirit within me will I ſeeke thee in the morning. Mary Magdalene came to viſit the ſepulchre of our Sauiour Chriſt very early, while it was yet darke. And as this hath bin the time, which the Saints of God haue chiefly choſen for the practiſe of their piety &amp; deuotion: ſo wee read in the Scriptures, that God hath powred his bleſsings vpō men, more vſually at this time than at any other time of the day. Manna, that heauenly food,
                  Exod. 16 13. 2. Kings 3.20. was by God giuen to the children of Iſrael in the morning. When the three kings of Iſrael, Iudah, and Edom made warre vpon the king of Moab, and were greatly diſtreſſed

for water, in ſo much as the king of Iſrael cryed out for feare of the preſent danger, it pleaſed God in the morning, when the meate offering was offered, to ſend the three kings plenty of water, both for the army and for all their cattel.
                  Acts 2.15. The holy Ghoſt came downe on the Apoſtles in the morning: for it was the third houre, which was between 7. and 8. of the clocke: ſo that it may be truly gathered, that they were before that houre exerciſed in hearing the word of God &amp; prayer.
            Vpon which grounds, you that are of the Pariſh of S. Antholins in London, &amp; you yt are the hearers of the morning Lectures there, are worthily to be cōmended: the one, becauſe you haue founded a Lecture in that place, at the fitteſt

time of the day, which, as hath bin prooued, is the morning; wherein appeares your godly wiſdome. The other, for repayring to heare the ſaid Lecture; wherin appeares your zeale and deuotion.
            Many Cōgregations haue done religiouſly in this kinde, but you ſurmount them all: for howſoeuer the word is to be preached in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon, (and no time or ſeaſon is vnfit for the hearing of the ſame) yet they are to bee commended aboue the reſt, which make choyce of the fitteſt time for this purpoſe. There bee ſome, which dare deride and ſlander this morning exerciſe; but this ought not to derogate from the worthines &amp; excellency of it; for I neuer heard of any action, were it neuer ſo holy and vertuous, but

it alwayes had aduerſaries to impeach it. And this is a ſure argument vnto me, that it is a ſeruice acceptable vnto God, aboue other of the ſame nature, becauſe it is more depraued &amp; ſlandered than any other: for the more diuine that any action is, the more enuy hath the deuil at it. Let none therfore be diſcouraged, or take offēce at this Lecture, if they heare it any way euil ſpoken of: but let this be my exhortation both to you that mayntayne it, &amp; to you that repayre to heare it▪ that you be not weary of well doing: for ſo is the will of God,1. Pet. 2.15. that by continuing in well doing, you may put to ſilence the ignorance and malice of fooliſh men.
            
               
                  Yours in the Lord, Robert Gray.
            
         
      
      
         
            
            AN Alarum to England.
            
               
                  
                     Gen. 19.23, 24, 25.
                  23. The Sunne did riſe vpon the earth, when Lot entred into Zoar.
                  24. Then the Lord rayned vpon Sodom and Gomorra brimſtone and fire from the Lord out of heauen,
                  25. And ouerthrew thoſe Cities, and all the plaine, and all the Inhabitants of thoſe Cities, and all that grew vpon the earth.
               
            
            
               MAny and fearefull haue bene the iudgements, which Almighty God from time to time hath executed vpon man for ſinne: But of all the examples of Gods vengeance, this which he ſhewed vpon Sodom

and Gomorrha for their impiety is moſt horrible and dreadfull: for whoſe eares do not tingle, whoſe fleſh doth not tremble, whoſe hart doth not melt, to heare of ſuch a ſudden, ſtrange, and mercileſſe fire as this was,The deſtructiō of Sodō and Gomorrha, the moſt fearefull example of Gods vēgeāce that euer was inflicted in this world vpon mākind for ſin. which like a ſhowre of raine fell vpon theſe cities and deſtroyed them? Wée read of the torments of hell, that they are vnſpeakeable, and as the heart of man cannot imagine the ioyes which are prepared for the godly, no more can the heart of man imagine the miſeries which are reſerued in hell for the wicked and vngodly. Now of all the iudgements which God hath inflicted vpon man in this world, there is none which doth more reſemble the paines of hell, then this wherewith Sodom and Gomorrha were ouerthrowne. Eſay. 30.33. it is ſayd, that in Tophet there is burning fire, and a riuer of brimſtone is there ſayd to kindle it: and Reuel. 20.21. it is ſayd, that the diuell was caſt into a lake of fire and brimſtone; and Reuel. 21.8. all the wicked and vngodly are threatned to haue their portion in the lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone, which is the ſecond death.

So that the torments of hel, and the iudgement wherewith Sodom and Gomorrha were deſtroyed, are fire and brimſtone. As therfore the torments of hell are vnſpeakable, and paſſe all other torments: ſo this vengeance which the Lord inflicted vpon Sodom and Gomorrha, reſembling hell torments, is the moſt grieuous and fearefull vengeance, which euer was executed vpon any people in this world, &amp; for this cauſe ought we more duly and ſeriouſly to conſider it, to the end that the horrour and dread thereof might ſtrike and imprint a feare and trembling in our hearts, to offend ſo great and mighty a God, which is able to puniſh and deſtroy the vngodly, euen in this world, with ſuch horrible and fearefull puniſhments.
            And ſurely, if euer we ſtood in néed of precepts to admoniſh vs, of counſell to forewarne vs, or of examples to terrify vs, we now ſtand in néede of them in this hard and flinty-hearted age of the world, wherein neyther precepts nor counſell, nor examples of other folkes harmes can any thing preuayle with vs to make vs beware: what things ſoeuer were written before,

were all written for our learning: all people before vs haue bene made examples for vs, yet nothing can moue vs or make vs wiſe, but wée are as inreſpectiue of Gods iudgements, and as careleſſe of his diſpleaſure, as though we had neuer read or heard any thing, and ſo reſolute are we in our impenitency, that if we ſhould ſee Sodom and Gomorrah burning before our faces, the fearefull beholding of ſo ſtrange an obiect might happely breede admiration and wonderment in vs, but repentance and amendement of life it would not.
            But Sodom lyes in the aſhes of her deſtruction, and wée haue raked by the remembrance of her in the aſhes of obliuion: Sodom is not ſo much as heard of by report in the day of our pride: her deſtruction was a wonder indéed: but we confirme the old prouerb, The greateſt wōder laſts but nine dayes. And as the ſmoke of her and of her land ſometimes aſcended into the clouds, and ſo vaniſhed: in like maner, the remembrance of her and of her deſtruction is periſhed like ſmoke, and forgotten as though it had neuer bene: yet wée

practiſe her ſinnes, and are corrupted more then ſhée in all her abominations: ſhée is a younger ſiſter to vs in iniquity, and we iuſtify her in all our tranſgreſſions. What a madnes is this to forget the iudgement wherewith ſhe was deſtroyed, and to practiſe her ſinnes, which was the cauſe ſhée was deſtroyed? This is to be penny wiſe &amp; pound fooliſh; for we may be well aſſured,If we practiſe the ſinns of Sodō we ſhall taſte of the iudgments of Sodom. that if we practiſe her ſinnes, we ſhall taſte of her iudgements. Therefore in her name I haue vndertaken to giue an Alarum to this City and this land, to eſchew the ſinns of Sodom, leſt they burne in the iudgements of Sodom, and for the ſame purpoſe I haue made choiſe of this parcel of Scripture, contayning a true, plaine, and perfit relation of that feareful ouerthrow, which Almighty God brought vpon Sodom and her Cities for their abominations.
            In which ouerthrow we haue foure things eſpecially to conſider. 1.Fiue cauſes why Sodom was deſtroyed. The ſuddennes of it: it was by Sun-riſe. 2. The author of it, which was the Lord from the Lord out of heauen. 3. The maner of it, which was with fire &amp; brimſtone. 4. The

generality of it, all the plaine, and all the Inhabitants of the Cities, &amp; all that grew vpon the earth, were deſtroyed in this ouerthrow. Laſtly, the cauſe of this ſudden, fearefull, generall ouerthrow, which was ſinne and iniquity.
            The ſuddenneſſe of Sodoms deſtruction appeares, in that the Hiſtory reporteth, that it happened by the Sunne-riſe in the morning: ſo that their deſtruction came vpon them vnawares. Ouer-night, they were all gathered together about Lots houſe, to breake open his dores; and in the morning their owne houſes crackle about their eares, &amp; are burnt ouer their heads, and they themſelues conſumed in the ſame fire: They made Lot and his gheſts haue an ill night; but now they themſelues haue a worſe morning: for in their ſinfull beds did the fire take them, or if they were riſen from their beds, a ſhowre of fire and brimſtone gaue them a wofull good morrow: And though this fire and brimſtone came downe in a ſhowre of rayne, yet it was ſuch a ſhowre, as was not diſcerned, before it came: the Skye was not ouercaſt, the Sunne was not ouerſhaddowed

with clouds,The ſuddennes of Sodōs deſtruction. nor the firmament with gloomy and thicke darkeneſſe, as vſually it is before other ſhowres: but the Sunne did riſe as fayre and bright vpon the earth, as at other times, ſo that there was no cauſe to expect or feare ſuch a ſhowre, and by reaſon it hapned ſo ſoone in the Morning, it took ſome of them in their beds, ſome aſléep ſome not throughly wakened, ſome apparrelling themſelues, others preparing themſelues to go about their ſundry occaſions, but none of them dreaming of ſuch an hot ſeruice, as to haue fire and brimſtone to their breakefaſt.
            When Almighty God brought that vniuerſall floud vpon the old world, Noah was a Preacher vnto them of that age, and by preparing the Arke, he gaue them warning what was intended towards them.
            In like maner, when Iericho was layd leuell with the ground, the ruines of that City were in a maner made manifeſt vnto the Inhabitants thereof, by the ſeuen dayes compaſſing of it about, and the ſound of the trumpets did, as it were, ſound foorth their deſtruction

vnto them: and euen vnto Pharaoh was Moſes ſent ſtill the day before, to forewarne him, and giue him knowledge of the plagues which ſhould enſue the day after: but in this deſtruction of the Sodomites, there was no man to forewarne them of it, no prediction to foretell it, no ſigne to demonſtrate it; ſo ſuddenly doeth vengeance take them, euen vnawares, and when they little thought of any ſuch matter.
            
               Doctrine.From whence growes this inſtruction vnto vs, that ſuch as continue and goe on ſtill in their wickednes without repentance,Vengeance ſhal ſuddenly ouertake the vnrepentant ſinner. Iob 34.20. ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed, before they be aware. God ſendeth downe his vengeance ſuddenly vpon the wicked, euen when they cry, Peace, Peace, and all is well, then doth vengeance come ſuddenly vpon them, as ſorrow commeth vpon a woman trauayling with child. This Elihu noted in his experience. They dye ſuddenly (ſayth he) meaning the wicked, and the people ſhalbe troubled at midnight, that is, when they looke not for it, and they ſhall paſſe foorth, meaning, the iudgements of God, and take away the

mighty without hand, that is, quickly, or contrary to all expectation.
            Many and fearefull are the examples which we haue in the Scriptures concerning this matter:
                  Gen. 19.26. Num. 25.8. 
               Lots wife turning her head awry, was her ſelfe at that very inſtant turned into a pillar of ſalt. Zimry and Cozby were both ſlaine amidſt their filthines. Belſhazzar in the height of his feaſting, reuelling, and banquetting, had his iudgement laid vpon him. Dauid being aſtonied at the ſudden deſtruction of the wicked, maketh an exclamation by way of admiration concerning this matter, Pſalm. 73.19. Oh how ſuddenly (ſayth he) are they deſtroyed, periſhed, &amp; horribly conſumed! And ſurely, the ſudden deſtruction of the wicked is not onely terrible to them yt are ſtriken with it, but it cauſeth as many to wonder, as eyther heare of it, or behold it: When the earth opened &amp; ſwallowed vp Corah, Dathan and Abiram with their wiues and children, they themſelues did not onely ſend foorth pittifull and rufull outcryes at the ſuddennes of their owne deſtruction,
                  Numb. 19.34. but all Iſrael that were about them, fled at the cry

of them: death, come it neuer ſo gently, yet it is moſt terrible &amp; dreadfull to nature, becauſe it deſtroys nature:Sudden death is one degree more fearefull then death. but ſudden death is a degrée more fearefull then death, becauſe death is the way of all fleſh, and it is appoynted for all men once to dye: and therefore it is wiſedome patiently to beare, and not to feare, that which cannot be auoyded: but ſudden death is neyther common to all, nor neceſſary for any, but it is like a Kains marke, ſet vpon ſome few for examples ſake, to warne others to feare and liue preparedly. In all worldly reaſon, it is better to dye in a moment, then of a long languiſhing ſickenes. Therefore Caeſar was wont to ſay,Suet. in vita Caeſar. 
               Repentinus &amp; inopinatus finis vitae eſt commodiſſimus. But howſoeuer a long languiſhing ſickenes is grieuous to nature, and tedious to fleſh and blood, yet therein a man hath time to compoſe and ſet himſelf in order, to diſpoſe and ſet his houſe in order, to yeld back his ſpirit to God which gaue it, with old Simeon to ſing that Swanlike ſong: Lord, now letteſt thou thy ſeruant depart in peace according to thy word: to giue teſtimony to the world, that he dyes in

the true faith of Chriſt, and in loue and charity with all men; ſo that he leaues a good report behind him, which as Salomon ſayth, is better then a precious oyntment: But as for him that dyes ſuddenly, he can do none of theſe things, and therefore he leaues a ſuſpition behind him, neyther can the iudging Nature of man hardly beléeue charitably of him: For indéed, to ſay the truth, where God will haue mercy, he commonly giues time to craue mercy: but when he ſtrikes ſuddenly, it is a fearefull ſigne that he meanes to haue no mercy; for ſo he threatens to the vngodly: His deſtruction ſhall come ſuddenly,
               
                  Pro. 6.15. 
               he ſhalbe deſtroyed ſpeedily without recouery.
            
            Theſe things being duly conſidered, we haue iuſt cauſe to pray with the Church in her Liturgy, From ſudden death, good Lord, deliuer vs. But you will ſay,Wee ought to pray againſt ſudden death. that we ought continually to liue ſo prepared and prouided for death, that we ſhould be ready at all times, ſteale it neuer ſo ſuddenly vpon vs. True it is, ſuch in déed ſhould be our readines and preparation; But yet this is no good argument,

that therefore we ſhould not pray againſt ſudden death: for thus I will inſtance againſt it:1. Tim. 5.8. Euery man is bound to prouide for his family, things honeſt and neceſſary for their reliefe and mainetenance, and he that doth not ſo, is worſe then an Infidell: yet euery man notwithſtanding muſt pray Giue vs this day our dayly bread. Our prouiſion for bread muſt not hinder our prayer for bread, neyther muſt our preparation for death hinder our praying againſt ſudden death. But you will ſay vnto me, Doe you condemne all that dye ſuddenly? or doe you thinke that ſudden death is alwayes a ſpirituall iudgement? What ſay you to good King Ioſias, ſo much lamented by Ieremy,
               Lam. per. tot. and commended by the teſtimony of Gods ſpirit in the Scriptures? What ſay you to many good men, ſome drownd at ſea?How to iudge of thoſe which dye ſuddenly. ſome kild in fight? ſome going well to bed, and found dead in their beds? do you affirme, that ſudden death to all theſe is a ſpiritual iudgement? Surely, concerning Ioſias, I anſwere, that he dyed not a ſudden death: for he was wounded at Megiddo,2. Chron. 35.23.24. and after he was wounded, he complayned to his ſeruants, that he

was very ſicke: wherevpon his ſeruants remoued him out of his owne charret, into an other, and afterward carryed him to Ieruſalem, and there he dyed. Can Ioſias be ſayd to dye of a ſudden death? They doe but f
                  •
               atter the world, which countenance the ſudden death of their friends, with the example of Ioſias: for where it is ſayd, that he was taken in there nets,
                  Lam. 4.20. the Prophet doth not meane by Nets, the ſuddennes of his deſtruction, but rather the cunning deuices and ſtratagems which his enemies vſed to worke his ouerthrow: and ſo is Net taken, Iob. 18.8. and in diuers other places beſides.
            And as for ſuch as periſh at ſea, they cannot be ſayd to dye ſuddenly: for when a man ſets his foote into a ſhip, he well knows, that there is but halfe a foots breadth at the moſt betwéene him &amp; death; ſo that a mans entrance into a ſhip to goe to ſea, is, as it were, an entrance into ſome dangerous ſickenes: and commonly there is ſome ſtorme before a ſhipwracke, which is a good premonition of enſuing danger; &amp; when a man is vnder water, he is not preſently depriued of life, but there is ſome

reluctation of Nature, in which time of reluctation, there may be many a déep ſigh ſent vnto God for mercy and forgiuenes; and as it is with thoſe that goe to ſea, ſo it is with thoſe that goe to fight: who knoweth not, that the chance of warre is vncertaine? &amp; therfore when a man goes into the field to fight, he ſhould make account that he lies him downe vpon his ſick-bed. The Drums and Trumpets are to him as ſo many bells, that ſound forth his dolefull knell: The Arrowes, the Pikes, the ſhot of all ſort, are meſſengers of death vnto him, ſo that he cannot be ſaid to die ſuddenly:Who are ſayd to dye ſuddenly. but that man dyes ſuddenly, who being in perfect health, and frée from all imminent danger, is ſo depriued of life, that there is no reluctation of Nature to bée perceiued. And what are we to iudge of ſuch? Surely, concerning ſuch, we are not onely to conſider the preſent condition of their death, but alſo to looke backe to their liues formerly paſt; and if we find them to haue liued in al good conſcience before God and men, and to haue béene buſied in ſome holy or charitable action at the howre of their death, theſe men, doubtleſſe, dye in the fauor of God; &amp; ſudden death is but a temporall

iudgement vnto them;Sudden death not alwayes a ſpiritual iudgement. Amb. de obit. Val.
                &amp; it were againſt the rule of charitie &amp; piety, to iudge otherwiſe of them: for of what kind of death ſoeuer a iuſt man dyes, it ſhal be wel with him, &amp; his ſoule ſhal be at reſt: but if a man hath all his life time liued wickedly &amp; vnconſcionably, and be alſo taken by death in ſome vngodly &amp; vncharitable action, out of al queſtion, ſuddē death is a ſpiritual iudgment to ſuch a man, as it was to the Sodomites here in this place, whom the Apoſtle S. Iude doth definitiuely condemne, ſaying,
                  Iude. 1.7. that they ſuffer the vengeance of eternal fire. Let this therefore be the vſe of all that hath bin ſaid, euen to pray againſt ſudden death, &amp; yet to liue alwaies ſo prepared for death, that we may be ready at all times with the fiue wiſe virgins in the Goſpel, to go in with the bridegrome,
                  Mat 25.10. &amp; be partakers with him of al his pleaſures which indure for euermore. Now we are in the 2.The Author of Sodoms ouerthrow. place to conſider the Author of this fearefull ouerthrow, wherewith Sodō
                &amp; Gomorra were deſtroyed; &amp; that was the Lord: for the text ſaith, The Lord rayned vpon Sodom &amp; Gomorrha brimſtone &amp; fire frō the Lord out of heauen. The phraſe of ſpéech here vſed, ſéemeth ſomwhat ſtrange, &amp; therefore

diuers men haue diuerſly interpreted it; ſome haue thought it to be nothing els but a ſpeach proper to the Hebrew tongue: others haue thought it a redundancy of ſpeach: ſome againe haue thought, that the holy Ghoſt would, by this forme of ſpeach, note vnto vs a miraculous and extraordinary action, aboue and beyond the courſe of nature: but in reading the ancient fathers, we may finde, that they did vrge this place againſt certaine Hereticks of their time, to proue the eternity of Chriſt. So Marcus Arethuſus in the Sirinian Counſell alledged theſe words againſt Photinus, expounding them thus, The Lord Chriſt, to whom ye Father hath committed all iudgement, did rayne from the Lord Iehouah his Father, brimſtone and fire out of heauen. So that Almighty God by his Sonne, did execute this fearefull vengeance vpon Sodom and her Cityes.
            There was neuer any thing which hapned in the world, eyther ſo miraculous or extraordinary, but there haue bene euer ſome, which haue eyther douted of the truth of it, or diſputed about the true cauſe of it.

Concerning the deſtruction of Sodom and Gomorrha, there be that do attribute it to the nature of the ſoyle:Strabo. for the country (ſay they) being full of pitch &amp; ſlime, and other combuſtible matter, the fire that deſtroyed theſe cities,Againſt thoſe that aſcribe ſtrange accidents to naturall cauſes. did burſt forth of the earth. Which aſſertion of theirs is cleane contrary to the Scripture here in this place, which ſayth, that it came from heauen. And amongſt vs at this day, if any ſtrange accidents do happen eyther in the Ayre or in the Earth, or in the Waters, we referre them to ſome naturall cauſe or other, being vnwilling (as it were) to acknowledge God to haue a hand in them. And why ſhould we be ſo willing to ſéeke out cauſes in nature for ſuch things as fall foorth ſtrangely in the world, and ſo vnwilling to intitle the God of nature in them? God made the Starres, and the Planets, and the

reſt of the celeſtial bodies of that kind, to be for ſignes, and ſeaſons, &amp; dayes, and yéeres: and this is the right and lawfull vſe of them by their creation. Let them be for ſignes,

Aſtra demonſtrant, non neceſsitant: The Starrs doe ſometimes foreſhew ſuch things as happen,Againſt the vanitie and incertaintie of iudiciall Aſtrologie. but they are not the inforcing cauſes of ſuch things as happen. Moſt impious therefore and blaſphemous it is, to aſcribe theſe things to the influence and operation of the Stars: for it is to rob God of his honour, to derogate from his power, to ouerthrow his prouidence, and to tye God to ſecondary and ſubordinate cauſes, and in reſpect of our ſelues, it extinguiſheth the feare of God in vs, it hinders our repentance and conuerſion vnto God, it drawes vs to Atheiſme, and to a flat contempt both of God and his Iudgements. Pharaoh was not mooued with all the miracles that Moſes &amp; Aaron could

doe, ſo long as hée ſaw his Sorcerers could doe the ſame; becauſe he attributed, whatſoeuer was in thoſe miracles to Art and Nature, and not to the power of God. The beaſts of the field doe not tremble at the braying of an Aſſe: but they are horrible afraid at the roaring of a Lyon. So we tremble not, we are nothing afraid, we are not mooued with any thing, be it neuer ſo ſtrange, ſo long as we are perſwaded it comes from naturall cauſes: but when we acknowledge the hand of God in ſuch things as befall vs, this bréeds in vs a feare of his Maieſtie, and we are the ſooner mooued to repentance and amendment of life.
            
               Origen is very bitter againſt theſe ſtarre-gazing Naturaliſts, and ſayth of them, that Dum alias ſtellas beneficas, alias maleficas faciunt, os ſuum in coelum aperiuno: Whiles they make ſome Planets beneuolent, and ſome maleuolent, they open their mouth againſt heauen it ſelfe.

And that ancient Counſell of Toledo, holden in the foure hundreth yéere after Chriſt,In aſſert. fidei cap.

                  lt. decréed thus againſt them, Si quis Matheſi aut Aſtrologiae exiſtimat credendum, Anathema ſit: Let him be accurſed, yt thinks there is any credit to be giuen to Aſtrology, or Mathematiſme. What comfort, I pray you, can any man haue, to thinke yt the Planets are the cauſes of ſuch things as happen in the world? Admit the Planets could hurt vs: can they heale vs, when they haue hurt vs? can they relieue vs, when they haue plagued vs? can they helpe vs, when they haue croſt vs? That man therefore muſt néeds be comfortles in his afflictions, that attributes the cauſe of them to the influence of the Starres, or to Fortune, or to neceſſity, or to any other ſecondary cauſe whatſoeuer. But as the Lord Iehouah did execute this terrible iudgement vpon Sodom and Gomorrha by the Lord Chriſt: ſo we muſt confeſſe and acknowledge, that it is God, and

not Nature, the Almighty, and not the Planets, the Lord of heauen and earth, and not Lady Fortune, that is the cauſe of all ſuch things as happen here in the world, whether they be particular or generall, whether they be curſings or bleſſings, ſafety or deſtruction, loſſe or gaine, iudgements or mercies, proſperity or aduerſity. This doth the Almighty himſelfe witnes of himſelfe, Eſay. 45.7. I make peace, and I make euill. And the Prophet Amos affirmeth the ſame thing of God,
                  Amos 3.6. 
               Is there any euill in the City, and the Lord hath not done it, ſayth the Prophet? Both which places do pregnantly proue vnto vs, that whether it be good or euill that happeneth vnto vs, God is the Author of it, and it commeth from him, as the true and onely cauſe thereof. Therefore the Prophet Ieremy demaunds this Queſtion of theſe that do ſo curiouſly obſerue the rules of Nature,
                  Iere· 14.22.

our God,
               
                  Pſ. 147.4. ſaith the Prophet? God being the God of nature, ouer-rules nature, he calleth the ſtarres by their names, and therefore diſpoſeth them at his pleaſure, &amp; guides the Planets after his will. Let vs not therefore employ our ſtudyes in ſuch vaine Arts, which haue no certainty in them: Let vs not beléeue, nor conſent, nor conſult with the rules therof:Hierom. in Eſay. cap. 27.
                for as Hierome well ſaith, ſuch Arts and the profeſſours, practiſers and inquirers after the ſame, doe more harme in a citie, then fire.
                  Canō. 16. And therefore the Councell of Venice, holden in the foure hundred and ſixtieth yéere after Chriſt, decréed, that if any man did ſtudy Aſtrologie, or gaue credit to any ſuch as did ſtudie that Art, if he were a miniſter, he ſhould be depriued, &amp; whatſoeuer he were, he ſhould be excommunicate: For indéede, theſe inferiour, though celeſtiall creatures, were made to ſerue man, and not to rule man. Let vs not therefore obſerue them,
                  Deut. 4.19.
               
attribute any thing vnto them, feare them, nor conſult with them; for thereby we prooue both iniurious to God, to our ſelues, &amp; to the creatures.
            But this is our wiſdome,
                  Micah. 6.9. Doct. God the Author of al ſuch things as befall man. to follow the counſel of the prophet, which is, acknowledge the rod, &amp; who hath appointed it: when any croſſe, affliction, iudgement, loſſe, or tribulation doth befall vs, we muſt confeſſe &amp; acknowledge, that by our ſins we haue iuſtly deſerued the ſame: &amp; in the ſecond place we muſt confeſſe &amp; acknowledge, that God hath appointed, ordeined, inflicted &amp; laid the ſame vpon vs, &amp; not the ſtarres, nor Fortune, nor Planets, nor Deſtiny, nor the diuell, nor man, nor any other creature in heauen or earth; but as the Lord rayned fire and brimſtone from the Lord out of heauen vpon theſe cities, &amp; this countrey of Sodom &amp; Gomorrah, ſo al our croſſes, loſſes, afflictions, and tribulations come from the Lord out of heauen. This Iob wel vnderſtood, &amp; acknowledged: for although

the Chaldeans and Shabeans ſpoyled him of his Oxen, Aſſes, and Camells, yet Iob aſcribes it all to God.
                  Iob 1.21. 
               The Lord hath taken it away, ſayth he. So likewiſe Sathan is ſaid to haue ſmitten Iob with ſore biles, from the crowne of the head, to the ſole of his foote, &amp; yet he lays it vpon God: The hand of God hath touched me,

When Shemei curſed Dauid, &amp; threw ſtones at him, and rayled vpon him, howſoeuer the ſonnes of Zaruiah tooke it to be the curſing of a dead dog, yet Dauid aſcribed it to God. The Lord, ſayth he, hath bidden Shemei to curſe Dauid. Whereby it is apparant,2. Sam. 16.10. that there is no euill that happens vnto vs, I mean the euill of puniſhment, or affliction, but God is the Author of it, and layes the ſame vpon vs; and to know and acknowledge this, is great comfort vnto vs:
                  Vſe. 1. for as God woundeth vs, ſo he is able to heale vs; as he afflicteth vs, ſo he can remoue our afflictions from vs: and therefore this bréedeth in vs a feruency

in prayer, according to the counſell of the Apoſtle,
                  Iames. 5.13. 
               Is any man afflicted amongſt you, let him pray? But to whom ſhould he pray in his afflictions? to the Starres and Planets? to Fortune and Chance? to Fate &amp; Deſtiny? None of theſe can relieue vs, they cannot heale vs, they cannot helpe vs. But heere is our comfort, that God afflicting vs, he can alſo comfort vs; therefore this prouoketh vs to be inſtant with God by prayer. Againe,
                  Vſe. 2. to acknowledge God to bée the Authour of our afflictions, it bréedeth patience in vs: Euery one of vs by Nature are wonderfull impatient, euen in the leaſt croſſes which can befall vs: and the reaſon is, becauſe we do not acknowledge from whence our croſſes come; for it we did, we would neuer be found to ſtriue againſt God. Dauid confeſſing his infirmity in this caſe, teacheth euery man his duety, and how to carry himſelfe in his afflictions, I ſhould haue bene dumbe,

haue opened my mouth, ſaith he, becauſe thou didſt it. Séeing his troubles came from God, he confeſſeth, he ſhould haue indured them patiently. Let vs therefore learne what to doe in the ſame caſe, euen to be patient in our greateſt troubles, becauſe God inflicts them and layes them vpon vs. The bird being caught in the lime-buſh, and not knowing the true cauſe of her calamitie, ſtriueth and ſtruggleth to inlarge her ſelfe, but the more ſhe applieth her ſelfe to procure her fréedome, the more ſhe plungeth her ſelfe into thraldome, the more feathers ſhe loſeth, and the more vnable ſhe makes her ſelfe to make her eſcape, if ſhe were at libertie. Euen ſo the partie afflicted, not knowing, or acknowledging from whence his afflictions come, the more he laboreth to recouer and rid himſelfe out of his troubles, the more hee inwrappeth himſelfe into troubles; the more meanes he vſeth of his owne deuiſing, to relieue himſelfe,

the leſſe comfort doth he féele, and the heauier are his croſſes vnto him. But as the ſhip, which by the violent courſe of a ſpring-tide is driuen vpon the maine, doth patiently abide, til the next ſpring-tide come and fetch her off, knowing that as ſhe was driuen vpon the ground by the Tide, ſo ſhe muſt be brought off with a Tide: ſo that perſon which is croſſed or afflicted, knowing that his afflictions come from God, doth patiently indure them, knowing that he which laid his afflictions vpon him, can alſo in his good time remooue them from him. Laſtly, to acknowlege God to be the author of our afflictions,
                  Vſe. 3. ſtirreth vs vp more duly &amp; ſeriouſly to ſerue &amp; pleaſe him according to his wil. If there could haue bin found, but 10. righteous men in Sodom, the Lord would haue ſpared the whole citie for thoſe Tens ſake. So if the Lord finde any thing in vs, that is agréeable to his will, or acceptable in his ſight, he will not puniſh vs, nor afflict vs,

nor croſſe vs further then may be for his glory, and our good: None can promiſe to himſelfe, though he be neuer ſo righteous, that he ſhalbe frée from afflictions: but the afflictions of Gods children are gentle chaſtiſments, they come from the loue of a Father, and not from the rigour of a Iudge. We neuer read, that euer he rayned downe fire &amp; brimſtone vpon the godly: but if at any time he do correct them, his corrections are milde, fatherly, and tending to amendment, and not to their deſtruction. If therefore thou wilt haue God fauourable, and kind, and good vnto thée, ſerue him, feare him, &amp; pleaſe him: ſo if he do chaſtiſe thée, it ſhalbe for thy good, and not for thy deſtruction.
            
               The maner of Sodoms deſtruction.Now in the third place, according to my firſt obſeruations, let vs conſider the maner of this deſtruction which the Lord brought vpon Sodom and Gomorrha, and that was fire and brimſtone; fire, which as we ſay, hath

no mercy, fire from heauen, which is more fierce &amp; fearefull then other fire, fire mingled with brimſtone; whereby the fire became more furious, and terrible, and the whole Land made barren and fruitleſſe for euer. And this mercyleſſe, fierce, &amp; terrible fire mingled with brimſtone, came from heauen in a ſhowre of rayne; but neuer was there ſuch a ſhowre of rayne fell vpon the earth. This was a rayne, not to coole and refreſh the earth, but to burne and conſume the earth, and the Inhabitants thereof. This was a raine, not to make the Earth fruitfull, but to make it fruitleſſe for euermore. This was a raine, not to moyſten the earth, nor to make it ſpring, and bring foorth things neceſſary for mans vſe, but it was a rayne, to ſkorch and parch the Earth, and to deſtroy both man and beaſt, from the face of the Earth;
                  Gen. 7.12. for it rayned fire and brimſtone from heauen. In the deſtruction of the old world, we read, that it rayned vpon

the earth forty dayes and fortynights: but it was water ſimply, without any other mixture.

               ones &amp; fire mingled with the haile, and that raine hurt nothing but what was in the field: but this raine which fell vpon Sodom, was not water, but fire, nor hayle mingled with fire, but fire mingled with brimſtone, and it did not onely deſtroy that which was in the field, but whatſoeuer was either in field, or citie, within the houſe, or without, at home, or abroad, was deſtroyed with this raine, man, woman, and child, beaſt, and cattell, trées, and herbes, all periſhed with this raine. And the more ſtrange was ye maner of this iudgemēt, becauſe it is ſayd, that brimſtone came from heauen. We often read of brimſtone in hell; but it is very ſtrange, that a thing of ſo ſtinking and odious a ſmell as brimſtone is, ſhould come from ſuch a ſwéete and pleaſant place

as heauen is.
            Lamentable and rufull hath béene the diuaſtation &amp; ouerthrow of diuers cities in the world, as of Troy, Carthage, Ieruſalem, Thebes, and ſuch like, inſomuch as the very relation of their ruines hath mooued mens hearts to pittie the perplexed eſtate of all degrées, diſtreſſed with ſuch deſolation. But the maner of this deſtruction, wherewith Sodom and Gomorrha were ouerthrowne, is without compariſon: Neuer was there people ſo diſtreſſed. If the rude and barbarous ſouldier had entred theſe cities by force, and had put man, woman, &amp; child to the ſwoord, imbruing their hands in the reuerend bloud of the old men, ripping vp the bodies of women great with child, taking the Infants &amp; ſucking babes out of their cradles vpon the points of their ſpeares, deflowring wiues, rauiſhing maides, ſpoyling the widdowes and fatherleſſe, ſparing no age, ſexe or degrée, but

deſtroying all before them with fire &amp; ſword: this had bene lamentable; but yet ſuch is the condition of warre, and no ſtrange thing had happened to theſe Cityes, but ſuch as had bene common to other cityes in their ouerthrow. If the Lord had ſent a famine vpon the people of theſe cities of Sodom &amp; Gomorrha, &amp; broken their ſtaffe of bread, and diminiſhed the oyle in the cruze, and the meale in the barrell, and had dryed vp all their ſprings &amp; fountaines, ſo that they had bene inforced to haue eaten and drunke their owne excrements, euery man to haue eaten the fleſh of his owne arme, and euery mother the childe of her owne wombe, this had bene very miſerable, yet ſuch as diuers other people beſides haue taſted of. But this people were otherwiſe ſurpriſed. It was no mortall enimy, but the immortall God, that fought againſt this people. The heauens ſent downe their forces againſt this people; and therefore in vaine

was it to lift vp hands, head, or eyes towards heauen, becauſe from thence came their deſtruction. If an enemy of the ſame mould that this people were of, had beſieged them, there might haue béene ſome treaty, ſome parley, ſome conditions of peace, of departing with bagge and baggage, of ranſome, or tribute hoped for: but when they ſaw the heauens open aboue their heads, and ſending downe fire and brimſtone vpon them, whē they ſaw their houſes on fire about their eares, no place of refuge or ſafegard to flye vnto, no meanes to eſcape, when they felt the fire fall vpon their ſoft and tender bodyes, as thick as rayne, when they felt it ſcorche their fleſh, when they ſaw one another lye ſprawling vpon the ground, drawne to, like a ſcrowle of parchment, with ye ſcalding heat of the fire, none able to help another, none able to cōfort another, what a miſerable face of a citie was there, thinke you?
            
               —quis talia fando
               
                  temperet a lachrymis?
            
            For the Lord rayned vpō theſe cities brimſtone &amp; fire from the Lord out of heauen.Reaſons why God brought this maner of deſtruction vpon Sodom and Gomorrha. Reaſon. 1. Now the reaſons which moued the Lord to ſend this ſtrange and terrible iudgement vpon theſe cities and people, were eſpecially 3. This God ſo wonderfull in power &amp; might, and ſo feareful in his puniſhment, had before this time drownd the world, for ſin; but the people of Sodō &amp; Gomorrha were nothing terrified with that iudgemēt, but were as wreched &amp; wicked in their courſes, as if they had heard of no exā
               ple of Gods wrath againſt ſin; &amp; therefore now God ſends fire to deſtroy them, to let all the vngodly of the earth know, that all the Elements and all creatures in heauen, earth and hell, are readie, and preſt to take vengeance vpon man for his ſin, when it pleaſeth God to command &amp; enioyne them: the Lord is not ſo bare of iudgements, that he hath but one kinde to reuenge himſelfe vpon ye vngodly, he hath more thē one arrow of vengeance to the bow of

his wrath, he hath water to drawn thée, fire to conſume thée, plague &amp; peſtilence to deſtroy thée, dearth &amp; famine to pine thée, a thouſand grieuous diſeaſes to bring thée to thine end. The earth is at his beck, to open and ſwallow thée vp quick: the Angels are at his commandment, to ſtrike 
                  〈…〉
                ſudden death: The deuils wayt vpon his will, and if he bid them goe, they haue power to tempt thée to bee thine owne butcher and executioner, as to hang thy ſelfe, to throw thy ſelfe downe headlong and break thy neck, to cut thine own throat. This God would haue ye ſinner know. And therefore let all the vngodly of the world feare this God, trēble at his iudgmēts, be careful &amp; cōſcionable to ſerue &amp; pleaſe him, &amp; take héed how they offend him; for if they prouoke him, he wil not ſpare them. They haue not ſo many wayes to anger him withall, as hée hath plagues &amp; puniſhments to deſtroy them withall. And from hence an impenitent ſinner may gather, that there is no place of ſafety nor ſecurity for

him; a walled citie is no place of defence for a ſinner, his houſe is no caſtle vnto him, his bed is no place of ſafegard for him; for in al theſe places God hath meſſengers of death and deſtruction to attach him.
            
               
                  Reaſon. 2.The ſecond 
                  〈◊〉
               , why the Lord brought this kind of iudgement vpon theſe cities, &amp; people, was, yt the maner of their puniſhmēt might be ſuteable &amp; correſpondēt to the maner of their ſin: for wheras they burned in the filthy luſt of concupiſcence one towards another, againſt the order &amp; courſe of nature, the Lord, to puniſh this vnnatural heat of luſt in thē, brought a ſupernatural fire vpon them: &amp; as they delighted in the filthy &amp; odious pleaſure of ſin, &amp; defiled themſelues with the helliſh contagion of impietie: ſo the Lord puniſhed them with brimſtone mingled with fire, that as their ſins made them ſtinke in the noſethrills of Almighty God: ſo they might be choked &amp; ſtifled with the deteſtable ſtinking ſmell of brimſtone: &amp;

as the Lord made the puniſhment of this people ſuteable to their ſinne: ſo he would haue al ſinners know, yt wherewith a mā ſinneth, by the ſame alſo ſhal he be puniſhed: for it was not vnpoſſible to the Almighty hand of God, which made all the world of nought, to haue drowned this people &amp; their land with the ouerflowing ſtreames of Iordan, or to haue deliuered them into the hands of ye foure kings, as once before, or to haue ſent the infectious &amp; noyſom peſtilence among them: but God choſe rather to deſtroy thē with fire &amp; brimſtone from heauen,
                  Gen. 14.10. to giue notice to all poſterities, yt as they ſin, ſo ſhal they be puniſhed. Aarōs ſonnes offred ſtrange fire vpon the Altar: &amp; therfore a ſtrange fire from heauen deſtroyed them. Samſon ſuffering the eyes of his mind,
                  Leuit 10.2. and the light of his reaſon to be extinguiſhed, was for his puniſhment depriued of his bodily eyes, and loſt the comfortable ſight of this world. And as he ſuffered himſelfe to be captiuated and inthralled

to the wil of a woman, ſo was he made a ſlaue to the will of his vncircumciſed enemies, &amp; compelled by them to grinde in a mill like an horſe, then which there could not be a more ſeruile ſeruitude. And it ſéemeth by the example of Diues,
               
                  Luke 16.24. that in hel there ſhal be ſome thing in the torments of the damned, which ſhall haue ſome correſpondency with their ſinnes: for Diues being vnmerciful in the world while he liued, can finde no mercy nor compaſſion when he is dead, either in hell or heauen: he that would not giue a crum of bread to Lazarus in his life time, cānot now get a drop of water to coole the typ of his tongue. Howſoeuer therfore there be generall torments in hell for the damned, yet it ſhould ſéeme that there ſhall be ſome particular thing in their torments, which ſhall haue ſome ſemblance with their ſins; &amp; the reaſon is, becauſe they might, to their greater griefe, be put in minde of their ſinnes, which were the cauſe of thoſe tormēts.
            
               The third &amp; laſt reaſon,
                  Reaſon. 3. Gen. 19.13. why the Lord from heauen ſent downe this ſtrange &amp; feareful iudgement vpon theſe cities &amp; people, was, becauſe their ſinnes cryed vp to heauen, therefore God anſwered the cry of their ſins, with a puniſhmēt from heauen. And this God doth, to let vs ſée how ſin turneth heauen into hell, and maketh the mercifull Sauiour of mākind, to be an vnmerciful deſtroyer of mankind. God is by nature a preſeruer of men, The ſhepherd of Iſrael,
                  Iob 7.20. Pſ. 23.1. Pſ. 18.2. A refuge for men to fly vnto for ſafegard &amp; ſuccour: but ſuch is the ſtrong effects of ſin, and ſo ſtrangely worketh it with God yt of a preſeruer of men, it makes him a deſtroyer of men▪ of a ſhepheard, it makes him a leopard, &amp; of a lambe a lyon. The heauēs by nature giue rayne vnto the earth in due ſeaſon,
                  Deut. 28.12. Hoſ. 2.21. to make it fruitefull and fertile, to bring forth things neceſſary for the vſe of man: But ſinne makes the heauens to bée braſſe vnto vs, &amp; cauſeth them to ſend downe fire &amp; brimſtone, ſtorme &amp; tempeſt,

to make the earth barren &amp; fruitles, &amp; deſtroy both man &amp; beaſt from off the earth. Moſt miſerable then is the eſtate and condition of a people or a land, when the ſinnes of that people or land become to be crying ſinnes: for in vaine is it for a people or a land to cry for mercy vnto God, whē their ſins cry for vengeance. In vaine doeſt thou hold vp thine hands, or lift vp thine eyes to ye heauens for fauor, when thy ſins with their cry haue ſollicited againſt thée for iudgement. When Ziba hath once accuſed Mephiboſheth vnto Dauid, it is in vaine for Mephiboſheth to excuſe himſelfe:2. Sam. 16.3. 2. Sam. 29.16. ſo if thou haſt practiſed ſin ſo long, that it now beginnes to cry vnto heauen, God that is in heauē wil heare the cry thereof, &amp; he will ſend downe ſome ſtrange puniſhment or other vpon thée to deſtroy thée. As Abigail therfore preuented the wrath of Dauid, by méeting him before he came at her huſband: ſo preuent thou the cry of thy ſins, &amp; méete God with thy repentance,

before the cry of thy ſinnes bring him downe to take vengeance vpō thée: cry thou for mercy, before thy ſins cry for iudgement: ſtop the mouth of thy ſins with contrition &amp; ſorrow; ſtil their cry with repentance &amp; amendment of life; &amp; as Pharaoh dealt wt the children of the Iſraelites in Egypt, ſo deale thou with thy ſins; kil them in the birth, neuer let thē trouble the houſe with their cry:
                  Exod. 1.16. ſo ſhalt yu find God mercifull vnto thée, &amp; the heauens fauorable vnto thée: otherwiſe, if thy ſins ſend their cryes before thée into heauen, look for ſome fearefull iudgemēt frō heauen to light vpō thée.
            The fourth thing we are to obſerue in the deſtruction of Sodom and Gomorrah,The generality of Sodōs deſtruction. is the generality of the deſtruction. Wherein we are to conſider 3. things: Firſt, that the whole countrey was deſtroyed. Secondly, the whole people, man, woman and child, old and young, were all taken away in this iudgement. Thirdly, all that grew vpon the earth, which Tremelius calls

               foetum terrae, the brood of the earth, whatſoeuer the earth brought foorth or nouriſhed, was all deſtroyed in the deſtruction of theſe cities. Concerning the countrey, we are to conſider it in two reſpects. Firſt, in regard of the largeneſſe and greatneſſe of the countrey: and ſecondly, in regard of the excellency of the countrey.The largeneſſe of the countrey of Sodom. Gen. 14.2. The largeneſſe of the countrey may be conſidered, either in the number of cities which it contained, or in reſpect of the ſcite and circuite of the ſoyle, within the compaſſe and territories whereof it was bounded. Concerning the greatnes of this country, in reſpect of ye cities thereof; Moſes deſcribeth them to be fiue, Sodom, Gomorrha, Admah, Zeboim, Zoar, which was alſo called Bela: of theſe fiue cities, foure were ouerthrowne in this iudgement of fire and brimſtone, as you may read, Deut. 29.23.
                  Gen. 19.22. for Zoar was preſerued at the entreaty of Lot. And the cauſe why Sodom &amp; Gomorrha are onely named in

this place which we haue now in hand, is, becauſe theſe were the chiefe cities of this countrey, more populous then the reſt, more abounding in wealth, and more abominable in their ſinnes.
            The firſt thing then which we are to conſider concerning the generality of this deſtructiō, is, that not villages, but cities, not one or 2. cities, but 4. cities, not 4. poore, baſe, beggerly cities, but foure great, populous, rich cities, were ouerthrowne in this fearefull ouerthrow, executed wt fire &amp; brimſtone.
            The ſecond thing to be conſidered in the largeneſſe of this countrey, is the ſcite and circuite of it, which was, as Pliny reporteth, one hundred miles in length, &amp; 25. miles in bredth. But Ioſephus, whoſe report is thought more true and certaine, deſcribeth this countrey to bée but thréeſcore and twelue miles long, &amp; ninetéene miles broad.
            Whereby we gather, that not a fewe fields or acres of ground, not a ſmall parcel or quantity of ground, but

a large country was ouerthrowne in this deſtruction.
            
               The excellency of the countrey of Sodom.Concerning the excellency of this countrey, Moſes ſets it foorth vnto vs, Gen. 13.10. by comparing it to the Garden of God, or to that part of the land of Egypt, which is watered with the ouerflowing ſtreames of the riuer Nilus: ſo that out of all queſtion, this countrey of Sodom &amp; Gomorrah was a moſt goodly countrey, fertil, pleaſant, &amp; delightfull; for as Paradiſe was watered with the ſwéete, freſh, wholſome waters of Euphrates, &amp; Egypt with ye faire, ſoft, ſliding ſtreames of Nilus: ſo this land of Sodom, lying alōgſt the ouerflowing banks of Iordē, might wel be compared to either of them for all 
                  •
               ind of riches, pleaſures and delights. And ſurely, the ſins of this countrey declare, that it was a goodly, rich, pleaſant countrey;
                  Ezech. 16.49. for as it is in the prophecy of Ezechiel, the ſins of this country were pride, fulnes of bread, and abundance of idlenes. The pride of this people

ſhewed their riches; their fulneſſe of bread, the fruitfulneſſe and fertilitie of the ſoyle; and the abundance of idlenes in this people, ſhewed the pleaſures and delights of the countrey: but how populous ſoeuer this countrey was, by reaſon of the cities that were in it, how large and great ſoeuer this countrey was, in reſpect of the ſoyle and circuit of it, how rich, fruitfull, and pleaſant ſoeuer this countrey was, the Lord ouerthrew thoſe cities, and al the plaine, euen the whole countrey, with fire and brimſtone, ſo that it is now as vnpleaſant as euer it was pleaſant: for there ariſe ſuch filthy, and foggy vapours and miſts out of the ground, as none is able to abide the ſmell of them, and as Borchardus reporteth, the neighbour mountaines are made barren with the contagion thereof: and how fruitfull ſoeuer it was before the deſolation of it, vndoubtedly, it is now as fruitles and barren; the waters are ſo bitter and vnſauoury, that nothing

liues in them: for if any fiſh doe happen to fal into the waters of this country, out of the riuer Iordan, by reaſon of the inundation of ye ſaid ryuer, they dye preſently: no graſſe growes in the countrey: Trées there be, which beare fruite, which outwardly ſéemeth very faire, but within ye rine there is nothing but duſt &amp; aſhes. And laſtly, this countrey is now as deſolate, as euer it was beautiful and goodly, for there is not a man inhabiting there, no creature abiding there,
                  Doctrine. Nothing can priuiledge either place or perſon from Gods vengeance againſt ſinne. not a cottage or a houell ſtanding in all the countrey: for the Lord deſtroyed all the cities, and al the whole countrey, with fire and brimſtone. Frō whence we for our inſtruction may learne and know, that when Almighty God takes vengeance vpon any land or countrey for ſinne, he reſpects neither greatneſſe, nor excellency, nor goodlineſſe, nor beauty, nor any other outward thing whatſoeuer: A fruitfull land maketh hée barren, a populous countrey makes

he waſte,
                  Pſ. 107.34. a beautifull countrey makes he deſolate: and all this he doth, for the ſinne of the people that dwell therein. Though Babylon ſit as a Quéene, and ſaith ſhe is no widow, neither ſhall ſée any mourning, yet her plagues ſhall come vpon her in one day, death, ſorrow, and famine, and ſhe ſhall bee burnt with fire. The diſciples woonder at the faire and goodly building of the Temple: but our Sauiour Chriſt tells them, that there ſhould a time come, euen the time when God ſhould viſit that people for their ſinnes, at which time there ſhould not one ſtone be left vpon another of all that beautifull building, that ſhould not bée throwne downe.
            We therefore of this land and citie ought to take this Alarum, for a warning giuen vs by Sodom &amp; other places, moſt excellent &amp; eminent in their times, yet al deſtroyed &amp; ouerthrowne for their ſins and impieties: for though England be a Paradiſe for pleaſure, a

ſtorehouſe of wealth, and a rich Exchequer of all plenty and delights; And though London be the Kings Chamber, the ſeat of the Nobles, the Mart of rich and worthy Marchants, &amp; indéede the beauty of the whole land, yet if God once viſit this land and citie, for the ſinnes of the inhabitants thereof, neither this nor that, neither the largenes of their territories, nor their beauty, excellencie, riches, or multitude of people, ſhall excuſe them, but he will make them as Sodom, and like vnto Gomorrha. If God would haue ſpared any place for the outward worthineſſe of it,
                  Pſ. 50.2. he would haue ſpared Zion, in which place the Lord appeared in perfit beautie, and of which place God gaue this teſtimony, that he loued the gates of Syon more then all the habitations of Iacob. And in another place the Lord hath choſen Syon, ſaying,
                  Pſ. 87.2. Pſ. 132.13.14. 
               This is my reſt for euer, here wil I dwell: for I haue a delight therein. And yet this place is ſo defaced, ſpoyled,

and ruinated at this day, that it lyes abhorred &amp; deſolate, being a cage of moſt vncleane birds, and a filthy denne of Turkes, miſcreants, and Infidels. And how can England or London ſecure themſelues, or promiſe any immunity of Gods iudgements vnto themſelues, by reaſon of any outward worthineſſe or excellency, wherewith they ſéeme to be bleſt aboue other Nations? for whenſoeuer God ſhall viſit this Land &amp; City for their ſinnes, nothing ſhall exempt vs frō his iudgements, except we preuent them by repentance.
            Concerning the generality of this Iudgement which the Lord brought vpon Sodom and Gomorrha, it is furthermore ſaid,Man, woman &amp; child deſtroyed in Sodoms ouerthrow that he deſtroyed all the Inhabitants of thoſe Cities, the whole people of the Land, not men onely, but women too, not men &amp; women onely, but men, women and children, euen all the Inhabitants of thoſe Cities periſhed in this ouerthrow, not the poore

onely, but poore and rich; not the baſe and inglorious Pezant, but the Noble and honorable amongſt them; not the ſubiect, but their Kings and Rulers; not thoſe which were in the field, but all that were in the cities, euen all the Inhabitants of thoſe cities were ouerthrowne in this deſtruction: So that as God ſpares no place, for any reſpect of outward excellency, no more doth he ſpare any perſon, for his owne worthineſſe or eminency: but when he brings his Iudgements vpon man for ſinne, the wiſe and the foole periſh both together, the King that ſits vpon the Throne, and the begger that ſits vpon the ground, they beare both a part, and drinke of the ſame cup, when he is angry. This the Spirit of God doth teſtify vnto vs by the Prophet Dauid, You ſhall dye like men,
               
                  Pſal. 82.7. 
               and ye Princes ſhall fall like others. And the Prophet Ieremy tells Ieconiah King of Iuda,
                  Ier. 22.24. that though he were the ſignet of the Lords right hād, yet he ſhould

be pluckt from thence. No title of honour, eminency or excellency, can frée a man from Gods iudgements. The plagues of Egypt were vpon Pharaoh, as well as vpon the people. And therefore Kings and Princes, and the honorable and renowmed perſonages of the world, muſt not flatter themſelues, nor ſuffer the pompe of ye world to deceiue them: for whether their honour and dignity conſiſt in authority, or in wealth and riches,1. Kings. 22.31. The greateſt men doe oftentimes taſte firſt of Gods iudgements. Dan. 5.30. or in the voluptuouſnes and pleaſure of life, none of theſe can frée them from GODS iudgements: Nay, if we marke the procéedings of God in the execution of his iudgements, we ſhall often ſée, that the mē in chiefeſt place, do ſooneſt taſte of his iudgements. Ahab, king of Iſrael, was firſt ſlaine in the battell at Ramoth Gilead. Among all the people that met Iehu as he went to Izreel, we read of none that was ſlaine, but the 2. kings, Iehoram king of Iſrael, &amp; Ahaziah king of Iudah .1000. princes

did profane the golden and ſiluer veſſels, which were brought out of the Temple at Ieruſalem, together with Belſhazzar King of the Chaldeans, as alſo did his wiues and concubines; yet the Scripture makes mention of none that was ſlayne that night, but onely the King. This ſhould teach Kings and Rulers, and ſuch as are of note and place, to take no more liberty of ſinning vnto themſelues, then thoſe of the vulgar ſort and condition: for they are as ſubiect to Gods Iudgements, as the meaneſt among the people.
            But now wonder all ye that read this Hiſtory, let your hearts melt with griefe, and your eyes be reſolued into teares of ſorrow, when you heare, that not onely thoſe of diſcretion &amp; yéeres, but euen children,Childrē deſtroyed as wel as thoſe of elder yeeres. Infants, and ſucking babes, that hangd vpon their mothers breſts, which knew not their right hand from their left, which neuer cōmitted ſinne actually, were alſo

deſtroyed in this ouerthrow: The tenderneſſe of their age might haue pleaded for them, they ſtucke to their mothers breſts, as Apples to their trées, they could not ſpeake, ſtand, nor helpe themſelues: Their innocency &amp; harmeleſſe ſimplicity might haue pleaded for them, they knew not their right hand from their left, they could not diſtinguiſh betwéene good &amp; euill, right &amp; wrong, ſtraight and crooked. Thoſe of elder yéeres had iudgement, &amp; will in themſelues, &amp; therfore they were iuſtly puniſhed for their tranſgreſſions: but what had theſe infants done, which had not as yet attayned to yéeres of diſcretion? But ſo fierce is the wrath of God againſt ſinne, that nothing could excuſe theſe ſilly infants: for the Lord deſtroyed all the inhabitants of theſe cities, he reſerued neyther man, womā, nor child aliue. Neyther was there any cruelty or iniuſtice in God, in deſtroying the childrē of Sodom, together with thoſe that were of elder yéeres &amp; diſcretion:

for foure reaſons may be yéelded of this action.
            
               
                  Reaſon. 1. Reaſons why Infants were deſtroyed.The firſt reaſon why the infants and ſucking babes in Sodom were deſtroied aſwell as thoſe of elder yéers was, becauſe they were the branches of ſuch curſed trées, &amp; children of ſuch vngodly parents: for howſoeuer it be true, that the Lord ſpeakes by the Prophet Ezechiel, that the child ſhall not beare the fathers ſin, it is true alſo that the Lord himſelfe ſpeaketh in the ſecond Commandement, He will viſit the ſinne of the fathers vpon the children: So that if a wicked and vngodly man beget a child, that child ſhal not beare the ſinne of the parents ſpiritually, and eternally, if it walke in good wayes, and betake it ſelfe to holy and vertuous courſes: but if the childe of vngodly parents liue neuer ſo carefully and conſcionably according to Gods will, yet the Lord will viſit the ſinnes of the parents vpon it corporally &amp; temporally, and if it walke in the wayes

of the parents, it ſhall beare the ſinnes of the parents eternally alſo. But admit that a childe of vngodly parents neuer come to commit ſinne actually, the Lord in his iuſtice may viſit the ſinnes of the parents vpon that childe both temporally and eternally, becauſe it is of the ſame nature that the parēts are: euen as the Huntſ-man finding a litter of ſome noyſome &amp; obnoxious beaſtes, killes them, though they neuer did harme, becauſe their nature is to doe harme if they liue: euen ſo, God in his iuſtice may deſtroy the very infants and ſucking babes both temporally and eternally, though they neuer committed ſinne actually, becauſe their nature is corrupt and tainted by propagation from their parents. But you will ſay vnto mée, The like may bée ſayd of the children of godly parents. No: For the godly haue a promiſe, that God will not onely bée their GOD, but the GOD of their ſéede alſo:

ſo that if the children of the godly dye while they hang vpon the breſt, or in the wombe, yet there is hope of mercy, by reaſon of the promiſe: but if the children of the wicked dye before they be of power to commit ſinne actually, there is no hope of mercy, but a fearful expectatiō of iuſtice, becauſe there is no promiſe of mercy belōging vnto them.
            You ſée then the reaſon, why God deſtroied thoſe infants &amp; ſucking babes of Sodom, with this temporall iudgement of fire &amp; brimſtone, euen becauſe they were children of vngodly parēts. And if he hath deſtroyed them eternally, he hath done no more then in his iuſtice he might, becauſe he neuer made promiſe of mercy vnto them.
            The ſecond reaſon why God deſtroyed theſe children, was to increaſe the griefe and ſorrow of their parents: for commonly the miſeries of our children are more grieuous vnto vs, then our owne miſeries. Dauid tooke the death of his ſonne Abſalō
                ſo heauily,

that hée wiſht hée had dyed for him. And out of queſtion, when this people ſaw their children lie ſprawling in the fire, ſcorcht and burnt with the heate thereof, when they heard them ſcréeke and cry, and could not helpe them, it was as grieuous vnto them, as their owne miſerie; and therefore the Lord did it, euen to increaſe and inlarge their ſorrow.
            The third reaſon why the Lord deſtroyed theſe children, was,
                  Reaſon. 3. becauſe they ſhould not walke in the wicked &amp; abominable waies of their parents; for if they had liued, the nature which they drew from their parents, would haue drawne them to the ſinnes of their parents: leſt therefore theſe children ſhould haue traced the ſinfull ſteps of their parents, the Lord takes them away in the ſame deſtruction with their parents.
            The laſt reaſon why theſe children were deſtroyed, was,
                  Reaſon. 4 becauſe GOD would leaue none of that wicked brood

to remaine vpon the earth; there were ouer-many of that ranke already:
                  Doctrine. Parents, euen in regard of their childrē, ought to liue conſcionably. and therefore the Lord, to the end he might roote out the memorie of this people, he deſtroyed children and all. Whereby man is taught to liue holily, iuſtly, and ſoberly in this world, foraſmuch as a man is not wicked onely to himſelfe, but to his poſteritie alſo. The wickedneſſe of the parents lyes heauily vpon the children: and therefore if thou haſt no regard of thine owne ſoule, yet haue a reſpect of thy children, and for their ſakes ceaſe to doe euill.
                  Eſay 57.3. The Prophet Eſay ſummons the children of Witches, the ſéed of the adulterer and of the whore, and the children of the rebellious, hée ſummons them all before God, and he layes this heauie iudgement vpon them; There is no peace to the wicked,
               20. 
               ſaith my God. It is a fearefull thing to be the child of an Uſurer, of an Adulterer, or Whore, of a Drunkard, of a murtherer, of a blaſphemer, or of any other

notorious wicked perſon whatſoeuer: for ſurely God will viſit the ſinnes of the parents vpon the children, as he hath threatned in the commandement, temporally, liue the children neuer ſo well, but temporally and ſpiritually both, if the children doe walke in the wayes of their parents.
            Laſt of all, concerning the generalitie of that deſtruction, which the LORD brought vpon this Countrey and people, it is ſaid,All liuing creatures deſtroyed in Sodoms ouerthrow. that Hee deſtroyed all that grew vpon the earth: or as Tremelius hath learnedly tranſlated the ſame wordes thus, All that the earth brought forth, and nouriſhed, all cattell and beaſts of the field, all creeping things, and whatſoeuer was vpon the face of the earth, was deſtroyed in this ouerthrow. And here we may iuſtly wonder at the iudgements of God, which he extendeth not only vnto man, which hath iudgements &amp; will, nor vnto babes and ſucklings which are tainted with

corruption by the propagation of nature from their parents, but alſo to vnreaſonable creatures, which neuer ſinned, but are ſubiect to vanitie againſt their willes, which doe not offend their Creator, but follow the law of their creation, and ſhall neuer come into iudgement; yet theſe creatures, as void of ſinne as of reaſon, are oftentimes plagued and deſtroyed for the ſinne of man. Thus was the earth curſed for the ſinne of Adam: Thus were al theſe creatures deſtroyed with the floud, for the ſinne of that age; and yet we may ſay of them, as Pithagoras ſometimes ſaid:

                  Quid meruiſtis oues, placidum pecus?
                  Quid meruere boues, animal ſine fraude?
               
            
            What haue theſe poore ſillie creatures deſerued, that they ſhould bée puniſhed? nay, deſtroyed, hauing neuer offended? Wée are the ſinfull wretches of the world, workers of all iniquitie, deſeruing not to be ſcourged with rods, but with Scorpions: We

(I ſay) being onely nocent, cauſe innocencie it ſelfe to be puniſhed for our tranſgreſſions. Behold then, O ſinfull man, thine owne vngraciouſneſſe, thou doeſt not only procure vengeance to thy ſelfe by thy ſinne, but to euery thing elſe that doth ſerue thy ſinfull vſe. Man by his creation is a Lord, and a high commander vpon the earth; for as it is in the Pſalme,
                  Pſal. 8. he hath dominion ouer all the workes of God, all things are put in ſubiection vnder his feet, all ſheepe and oxen, yea and the beaſtes of the field, the birdes of the ayre, the fiſhes of the ſea, and whatſoeuer walketh thorow the pathes of the ſeas: So that man in reaſon ſhould content himſelfe with this dominion and Lordſhip which he hath ouer the creatures, and not ſéeke and procure the deſtruction of them: Man ſhould ſatiſfie himſelfe with the vſe and commoditie of theſe creatures, and not ſeeke the ruine and wracke of theſe poore bond-ſeruants, both by ill intreating

them himſelfe, and by prouoking God with his ſinne, to plague, puniſh, and deſtroy them. And ſurely, but that the prouidence of God doth reſtraine theſe ſilly dumbe creatures, it is a maruell, that they doe not break their league with man, and ſhake off the yoke of obedience toward him: It is a maruell that ye earth doth not rent in ſunder vnder man, as he walkes vpon it, ſéeing it is ſo plagued with barrenneſſe for the ſinne of man: It is a maruell, that our oxen and our horſes, with their hornes and hooues, doe not make warre againſt vs, ſéeing we are ſuch vnrighteous &amp; tyrannicall Lords ouer them, not content to haue their vſe and ſeruice, except wée plague them beſides into ſuch vndeſerued vengeance of GODS wrath by our ſinnes and tranſgreſſions. Let vs therefore forbeare and eſchew ſinne, and flye from it, as from a Serpent, ſéeing by it wée doe not onely draw downe Gods heauy iudgements vpon

our heads, but alſo wée plague our poſteritie, and the very dumbe and vnreaſonable creatures into the wrath of Gods vengeance, by our ſinnes and tranſgreſſions. And let vs further learne the perfect hatred of GOD againſt ſinne, who doth not onely puniſh it in mā which committeth it, but in all things which any way ſerue man in his ſinfull courſes: and let vs eſtéeme no ſinne ſmall, ſéeing the infinite maieſtie of God is offended by it, infinite torments are prepared for it, and nothing can ſatiſfie for it, but the ineſtimable price of Chriſtes blood, applyed to the conſcience by a true and liuely faith.
            Now it remaines,The cauſe of Sodoms deſtruction was ſinne. that in the laſt place we examine the cauſe, why the Lord brought ſuch a fearefull deſtruction vpon this land and people. There muſt néeds be ſome great cauſe, that did exaſperate the Lord to execute ſuch a fierce &amp; ſtrange iudgemēt vpon them. The cauſe is not hard to be found out:

for nothing doth ſeparate man from God, but ſinne; nothing doth prouoke God to puniſh, plague and deſtroy man, but ſin; nothing doth draw downe the iudgements of God vpon man, but ſinne; and ſinne it was, that mooued the Lord to reuenge himſelfe thus ſeuerely vpon this land and people, as it appeares by the wordes of Almightie God to Abraham,
               
                  Gen. 18.20. 
               Becauſe the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and becauſe their ſin is exceeding grieuous, I will go downe now, ſaith the Lord. Sin brought death into the world, they are twinnes, bred and borne in one day; ſinne and deſtruction are Relatiues; admit the one, and the other followes; death and deſtruction growes foorth of ſinne, as fruite from the tree: and therefore if we ſin, we may ſurely expect to be puniſhed; and if we be puniſhed, we need not doubt of the cauſe, but we may ſafely thinke with our ſelues, it is for our ſinnes. Therefore as we haue conſidered

the puniſhment of Sodom, ſo let vs conſider the ſins of Sodom, which were the cauſe of her ouerthrow and deſtruction. The Prophet Ezechiel doth make knowne vnto vs the ſinnes of this people to be foure; Pride,
               
                  Ezec. 16.49. The ſins of Sodom. Gen. 19.5. 
               fulneſſe of bread, idleneſſe, and vnmercifulneſſe towardes the poore. But theſe were not all the ſins of Sodō: for the Scripture layes downe another ſinne practiſed amongſt this people, which becauſe it did either beginne amongſt them, or was more practiſe
                  •
                amongſt them then amongſt any other people beſide, deriued the name from them, and ſo holds it to this day: but the Prophet doth reckō the forenamed ſinnes, to be the ſinnes of this people, becauſe they were the principall cauſes of that vnnaturall ſin, which wi
                  •
               h the cry thereof brought ſuch a fearefull vengeance vpon them.
            In ſpeaking of the ſinnes of Sodom, I will kéepe the ſame order, that the Prophet obſerueth in the place

before cited,Pride. placing Pride in the firſt ranke, as though it were the Ringleader to the reſt, and the roote from whence all other vices doe follow: and ſo it is indéed, and therefore it is called the Center in the ſphere of mans life, from whence are drawne lines to the circumference of iniquitie. If a man haue any good gifts or qualities in him, pride doth expell and abandon them: if a man haue none, pride will not giue place for any to enter:A proud man cares not for God. Pſ. 10.4. and the firſt thing that pride works in mā, is an irreſpectiue care and an incurious reſpect of God; hee cares not for God, he ſéekes not for God, hée doth not truſt and relye vpon God, nay, he thinkes alwayes there is no God; for the obiect of his pride is his God, and in it he doth truſt, vpon it he doth relye, and he ſets it vp as an Idoll, not onely in his owne heart, but in the eyes and view of the world, to the end all men may applaud, admire, honour and magnifie it: as if a man be proude

of his Nobilitie, of his dignitie and greatneſſe, of his wealth and riches, of his credit and eſtimation, of his learning and wiſdome, of his apparel, of his coſtly and goodly buildings, or whatſoeuer elſe is the obiect of his pride, he doth not onely ſet his heart vpon it himſelfe, ſéeking all meanes to vphold and maintaine it, deriuing all his ioy and contentment from it, depending vpon it as vpon the ſtaffe and ſtay of his ſtrength, but he muſt haue all other men likewiſe to commit Idolatry with it: and as the finger is alwayes where the paine is, and the eye where the affectiō is: ſo is the heart of a proud man alwayes ſetled &amp; fixed vpon ye thing whereof he is proud. And therefore it is true that Dauid ſpeaks of him; he cares not for God,
                  Pſ. 10.4. he ſéekes not for God, &amp; he thinks alwayes there is no God: &amp; as he is thus careles &amp; inreſpectiue of God, ſo is he moſt iniurious to his neighbor, in ſcorning, diſdaining, deſpiſing, &amp; vildly eſtéeming him.

               Superbus neſ
                     •
                  at eſſe ſocius:A proud man is iniurious to all men. A proud man acknowledgeth none to be his equall. A proud man is alwayes contentious, and by reaſon he is wholy poſſeſt with ſelfe-loue, a man ſhall neuer haue iuſtice at his hāds: for which cauſe, Moſes gaue warning to the Iſraelites,
                  Deut. 17 20. not to chuſe a King, that ſhould lift vp his heart aboue his brethren: for when the chiefe Magiſtrate is proud and haughty, all iuſtice and iudgement is peruerted, &amp; he gouerns all things after the rule of his owne proud conceyts: And euen as when a man winnoweth wheate, the chaffe mounts aloft, though it be light and vnprofitable, but the wheate falls downe vnto the groūd, though it be more precious and excellent then the chaffe: euē ſo, when a proud man ſits in gouernment, vanity is preferred, but iuſtice and iudgement are depreſſed.
                  Pſ 119.51.69. 
               Dauid complayneth of the proud, that they had him excéedingly in deriſion: and in another place, that they imagined a lye

againſt him: noting vnto vs thereby, that in the firſt place, they ſcorne and diſdayne all men; and in the ſecond place, that they wrong, maligne, and deale vniuſtly with euery man. Thus is a proud man foūd impious towards God, iniurious to his neighbour,A proud man not capable of grace. not capable to receyue any good gifts or graces, as a certain Philoſopher told Alexander, perceyuing his pride, God (ſayd he) is able to giue wiſdome vnto men, but Alexander is ſo proud, that there is no place for wiſdome to take place in him. And laſtly, a proud man is in danger to loſe thoſe good gifts and qualities which hée already hath, according to that old prouerbe,
Inficit egregios adiuncta ſuperbia mores.
            
            Where pride is, there all excellent conditions are infected and poyſoned, ſo that they eyther dye, or grow ſo weake, that they are not able to performe any good office or duety.
            
               
               
                  Pſal. 36.11.This made Dauid pray, Let not the foot of pride come againſt mee: for well he was aſſured, that if pride ſet in a foot againſt him, hee ſhould haue extreme wrong offered him. Pride then being one of the ſins of Sodom, it is manifeſt, that there was no religion there, no ſéeking after God, nor any care of his worſhip or ſeruice, neither was there any iuſtice, iudgement, or equitie in the land, but all kinde of oppreſſion and wrong, all grace &amp; goodneſſe was exiled thence, neither was there any place for vertue &amp; godlineſſe in that place: and therefore no maruel it was, if God brought ſuch a fearefull deſtruction vpon ſuch a proude place and people; for pride brings alwayes deſtruction with it, as Salomon ſaith, Pride goes before deſtructiō,
               
                  Pro. 16.18. 
               and an high minde before a fall. So that a man is neuer néere a miſchiefe, till hée grow proud: for thē he procures Gods hatred towards him, as it is in ye Prophet,
                  Amos 6.8. 
               The Lord hath ſworne by himſelfe,

I hate the excellency of Iacob. And this hatred that God beares againſt pride,
                  Iam. 4.6. prouoketh him to reſiſt the proud, to croſſe them, and by ſundry meanes to reuenge himſelfe vpon them.
                  Zeph. 2.10. 
               This ſhall they haue for their pride, ſayth the Prophet. The Lord will be terrible vnto them, as he hath threatned by the Prophet Ieremy, ſaying, Behold, I come vnto thee,
               
                  Ier. 50.31, 32. 
               O proud man: And, The proud ſhall ſtumble and fall, and none ſhall raiſe him vp, and I will kindle a fire in his cityes, and it ſhall deuoure all about him. All theſe threatnings againſt pride, did the LORD bring vpon Sodom and her Cityes, in ſuch ſort as they are héere remembred, for an example vnto all poſterityes: the ſame threatnings he will likewiſe bring vpon all thoſe that are infected with it.The ſecond ſinne of Sodom, fulnes of bread.
            
            The ſecond ſinne of Sodom, was fulnes of bread. By bread is ſignified all ſuch meats &amp; drinks as are vſed for the

nutriment of the body, which this people of Sodom did vſe with ſuch ſaturity, and ingurgitation, as did not relieue nature, but deſtroy Grace: Nature is content with a little, Grace with leſſe; but where this fulneſſe and repletion of bread is, there nature is depraued, and grace deſtroyed. This ſinne is the baite which the diuell vſeth,Gluttony, the deuils baite. to prouoke men to yéeld vnto all his temptations; for as the Faulconer, when he would call his Hawke to his fiſt, doth not hold out his bare fiſt vnto her, but ſheweth her a piece of fleſh, vnto which ſhee willingly comes, and ſo is taken: ſo the deuill, when he would tempt a man to any ſinne, he offers him the baite of deliciouſneſſe, knowing that the more the body is repleate, the more emptie is the ſoule of all grace and goodneſſe. One cauſe why Diues was ſo vnmercifull towards poore Lazarus was, becauſe he fared deliciouſly euery day; for a full belly is neuer touched with

the féeling of others miſeries. The cauſe why the Iſraelites were not ſorry for the affliction of Ioſeph,
               
                  Amos. 6.4.6. nor pitied the diſtreſſed eſtate of their brethren, was, becauſe they ate the lambs of the flocke, and the calues of the ſtall, and drunke their wine in bowles. The cauſe why euery man among them neyed after his neighbours wife, was,
                  Ier. 5.8. becauſe they did riſe in the morning like fed horſes. And the cauſe why they committed idolatry, and worſhipped the golden calues which Aaron made them, was, becauſe they cram'd themſelues exceſſiuely with meat &amp; drinke, and that made them forget God, which had done ſo great things for them. Whereby it is euident, that the repletion of the belly is the confuſion of the ſoule, and that the deuill hath the greateſt aduantage againſt vs to tempt vs, and wee the leaſt ſtrength to withſtand him in this repletion and fulneſſe of bread:
                  Pſal 69.23. therefore Dauid calleth the table of delicious féeders, a

ſnare: for euen as birds are caught in that place where they come to féed: euen ſo are they that fare deliciouſly, caught in the Deuils net, whiles they féed.
                  Pro. 23.20. For this cauſe, the Wiſe man forbids vs to bée companions with thoſe which cramme themſelues with fleſh, leſt by eating and drinking exceſſiuely, we giue the deuil aduantage to tempt vs to ſome grieuous ſinne. And in like maner did Almighty God forbid the Prophet to go into ye houſe of feaſting,
                  Ier. 16.8. to ſit there to eate and drinke: for as he ſaith in another place,
                  Hoſ. 13.6. When men are filled, their hearts are exalted, and then they forget God. And as this fulneſſe of bread plungeth the ſoule into many inexplicable dangers, &amp; makes it ſubiect to diuers temptations: ſo is this vnmeaſurable féeding hurtfull &amp; obnoxious to the body: for when the ſtomake receiueth ſuch aboundance, &amp; ſo many kindes of meat and drink, it is oppreſſed rather then relieued. Therefore ſaith Salomon,
               
                  Eccle
                        •
                     . 5.11. that the ſaciety of the

rich will not ſuffer him to ſleepe: his body is ſo diſtempered by his féeding, that his quiet reſt departeth from him. We eſtéem the goodnes of a medicine,Meat &amp; drinke to be taken like a medicine. not by the pleaſantnes, nor by ye great quantity, but by the wholeſome &amp; good operation of it: ſo ought we to eſtéeme of meat, not by the deliciouſneſſe of it, nor by the abundance of it, but by the health it bringeth to our bodyes. Nothing bréeds a ſurfet ſooner, then this fulneſſe of bread; &amp; out of all doubt, this vnmeaſureable féeding hath brought many to an vntimely death. If therefore thou wilt kéepe thy body in health, vſe thy meat and drinke as thou vſeſt medicines; that is, ſeldome and in ſmall meaſure:Fiue cautions to be obſerued in eating &amp; drinking. for in fiue things doe wée eſpecially offend in eating and drinking.
            Firſt, when wee make it our firſt worke in the morning, being no ſooner out of our beds, but our minde is vpon our meat; for which cauſe Salomon denounceth a wo vnto that land,

whoſe Princes eat in the morning: for ſuch as eate in the morning, are fit for nothing all the day after. Secondly, wée offend in eating and drinking, when we are too curious and nice in our dyet, not contenting our ſelues with ordinary and common meates and drinkes, but longing after ſtrange and vnuſuall things, and thoſe muſt be moſt coſtly and curiouſly dreſt: this was the ſinne of the Iſraelites,
                  Numb. 11.6. which loathing Manna, deſired fleſh for their luſt: for which curioſitie of theirs, God deſtroyed them, euen whiles the meat was in their mouthes.Plutar. in Rom. Apoph. Caution 3. And the Emperour Auguſtus did cauſe one Erotes, a Lieutenant in Egypt, to bée naild to the maſt of a ſhip, becauſe hée bought a Partridge and ate it. And our Sauiour Chriſt noteth curious féeding, as a fault in the rich Glutton, euen becauſe he fared deliciouſly.
            The third ſinne in eating &amp; drinking, is, when we eate and drinke without meaſure, not reſpecting what will

ſuffice nature. Our Tables are called menſae, as ſome thinke, a menſura, to teach vs to meaſure our appetite, and not to eat &amp; drinke vnmeaſurably; for euen as that raine, which comes downe méekely and gently vpon the earth, doth moſt good, and makes the earth moſt fruitfull: ſo that meate which is taken in meaſure, doth moſt benefit the body and ſoule: and this is the meaſure wée muſt obſerue, wée muſt not eat much, but rather for neceſſitie then for luſt; then we muſt not eate nor drinke often: and laſtly, wee muſt not eate nor drinke of diuers and ſundry ſorts: for all theſe things doe make our eating and drinking ſinfull and hurtfull.
            Fourthly, we offend in this kinde,4 when we ſtudy and deuiſe what to eate or drinke. Theſe perſons are compared to thoſe beaſts, which are alwayes either eating or chewing the cud: ſo theſe perſons are either alwayes eating, or deuiſing what to

eate. This was the ſinne of the ſonnes of Hely;1. Sam. 2 13, 14, 15. they were not content with thoſe parts of the ſacrifice which the Law had prouided for them, but they found out new deuices, and ſometimes they would haue ſodden fleſh, &amp; ſometime they would haue raw, ſometime without fat, and ſometime fat and all. Theſe deuiſers are they, that make their belly their God.
            Laſtly, we offend in eating &amp; drinking, when wee gréedily deuoure the creatures like dogs, which haue it no ſooner in their mouthes, but it is down their throats. This was ye ſin of Eſau, who comming hungry from hunting,Gen. 25.30. Sine me haurire: Tr
                     •
                  mel. deſired his brother to féed him quickly, or to ſuffer him to deuoure thoſe red pottage. But he had better haue taken more leyſure, and eaten more aduiſedly: for he loſt the prerogatiue of his birth-right by his gréedineſſe. And becauſe man ſhould not deuoure his meat and drinke with gréedineſſe, Nature hath giuen man a leſſe mouth,

then many creatures which are leſſe then he; to teach man by ſo ſmall a receptacle, to receiue his meate &amp; drinke with time and leyſure.
            Thus haue we heard the fiue things, wherein wee offend in eating and drinking.
            Now this fulneſſe of bread is ſuch a grieuous ſinne in the ſight of God, that hee hath ſworne hee will neuer purge it. And the reaſon is,
                  Eſay 22.13, 14. becauſe we are called to other duties. Non nati ſumus ad libidinem, hoc poſsimus facere, ſed non eſt opus noſtrum: Wée are not borne into the world, neither do we liue in the world, to giue our ſelues to delicious &amp; full féeding, to feaſting and banquetting, nor to fulfill our owne luſts and deſires; wée may doe theſe things, if wee will runne head-long into our owne miſchiefe: but this is not our calling, it is not that wee are bound to doe, it is not the worke which we are commanded and inioyned to performe: and

therefore, as it is Crimen laeſae maieſtatis, a capitall and treaſonable crime for an Embaſſadour,Fulneſſe of bread moſt diſpleaſing vnto Almightie God. to execute his charge contrarie to the limitation of his profeſſion: euen ſo it is moſt diſpleaſing vnto Almightie God, when we walke contrary to our calling, croſſing the end of our creation. No maruell then, if Almightie God tooke ſuch a fearefull vengeance vpon this people, which walkt ſo contrary vnto him, filling themſelues with bread, and cramming themſelues with fleſh, when indéed the Lord calles men to wéeping and mourning,
                  Eſay. 22 12. to baldneſſe and girding about with ſackcloth.
            
               The third ſin of Sodom was idleneſſe.The third ſinne of Sodom and her people, was idleneſſe, which was twofold in this people. Firſt, they gaue themſelues to their eaſe, to vnthriftineſſe and ſluggiſhneſſe, not following their callings laboriouſly and induſtriouſly, but liuing looſely and remiſſely, giuing themſelues to all diſſolute and vnthriftie courſes: This may be gathered

out of the 19 Chapter of Geneſis, the 4. verſe, where it is ſaid, that all the men of the Citie, euen from the yong to the olde, all people out of all quarters compaſſed Lots houſe about, to haue the mē brought out vnto them, that they might know them. From whence it may be gathered, that they were an idle and vnthrifty company, giuing themſelues to no good employment, but rather to vaine &amp; diſſolute exerciſes. The ſecond kinde of idlenes in this people was, a careles ſecurity, &amp; a certaine reſpectles regard, wherewith they were ſo poſſeſſed, that they neuer thought vpon dangers, they feared nothing. Abraham had ſlaine ye fiue kings, which would haue made them tributarie, hee recouered all the ſpoyle, and gaue it to the King of Sodom, ſo that now they had no enemie to be afraid of; they had peace &amp; plenty, and therefore they liued idly, that is, ſecurely &amp; careleſly, fearing no dangers, preuenting no miſchiefes.
            
               As the pride of this people prouoked God to reſiſt them, and as their fulnes of bread gaue the deuill a greater aduantage to ouercome them by his manifold temptations, ſo their Idlenes made them a burthen to the Earth: They were a coomber and a ſurcharging trouble to ye place of their abode, liuing vnthriftily &amp; vnprofitably both to themſelues, and to the land where they dwelt.
                  Luk. 13.7 Idle perſons a burthen to the earth. The figge trée in the Goſpell being barren and vnfruitfull, is ſayd to trouble the ground; ſo thoſe perſons which liue idly, do but trouble the world, &amp; ouercharge the earth: for which cauſe the Bée driueth from the hiue the Drone, which takes no paines, but deuoures the hony, which others by their great labour do get &amp; bring in; teaching the Magiſtrates of the earth their duty, which is, to correct, with all ſharpnes of diſcipline, thoſe vnthrifty and vnſeruiceable Drones, which liue idly in the common wealth, trifling out their time in

continuall lazines, as though there neuer had a law bin giuen to the ſonnes of Adam to labour, nor to the daughters of Eue, with the ſweat of their browes to get their liuing.
                  Pro. 6.6. All creatures in heauen, earth &amp; hell, painefull in their places, but onely man. 
               Salomon ſendeth the ſluggard to the Piſmire, to conſider her wayes, and to learne wiſdome: for ſhe hauing no guide, gouernor, or ruler, prouideth meat in Summer, &amp; gathereth food in harueſt. Man therfore may be much aſhamed of himſelfe, that hauing reaſon to guide him, nature to direct him, law to gouerne him, grace to rule him, lims ſtrong &amp; able for performance, yet prouideth not, gathereth not, laboureth not, but like a Drone conſumes his dayes in idlenes, liuing vnprofitably and vnſeruiceably both to himſelfe and others.
            God ſanctified not his reſt, before he had finiſhed his labour. The Angels in heauen attend in their places, and ſtand before their Creatour, and with all alacrity, readineſſe,
                  Iob. 1.7. 2. Pet. 5.8. and induſtry fulfill his will.
            
               
               
                  Iob. 1.7. 2. Pet. 5.8.The deuill himſelfe is ſaid to compaſſe the earth, and to walke about, ſéeking whom he may deuoure. Séeing therefore God, Angels, Bees, Piſmires, and the deſpiſed wormes of the earth, do all of them in their kindes &amp; places giue themſelues to labour: Nay, ſéeing the deuill himſelfe ſpends not his time idly, they are worſe then the deuill, which ſuffer the dayes of worke to ſlide away, without labouring in the workes of their vocation. Idlenes, as Barnard ſaith,Idleneſſe the ſinke of all lawleſſe temptations. is a ſink of all luſtfull and lawleſſe temptations. What was the cauſe that Aegiſthus became an Adulterer?
            In promptu cauſa eſt, deſidioſus erat.
            Idleneſſe was the cauſe that prouoked him thereunto. And if you will know the cauſe of ſo many robberies in the fields, ryots in the ſtréets, diſorders in euery place: in a word, all theſe &amp; many more inconueniences procéed and grow from idleneſſe; for euen as that water that hath no currēt, doth in

ſhort time corrupt, &amp; become offenſiue: ſo that body or mind which exerciſeth it ſelfe about no imployment, becomes a very ſinke of all lewdneſſe &amp; diſorder.
                  Pro. 24. 
               Salomon went by the field of the ſluggard, and lo, it was all growne ouer with thornes, and nettles had couered the face thereof. And as the field of the ſlouthfull is couered with nettles and thornes;Idle perſons corrupt both in body &amp; minde. ſo his body is ouer-growne with infirmities, his minde corrupted with the infection of ſinne, his conſcience deſtitute of a good teſtimony to it ſelfe, and his ſoule voyd of all hope of eternall happineſſe. God hath placed vs in this world, as labourers in his vineyard, as ſouldiers in his campe, as trauellers to ſéeke a countrey to reſt our ſelues in, as curſitors or runners in a race: whereby wee may gather, that idleneſſe is not our profeſſion: for we cannot obtaine, except we run the race: we cannot ouercome, except wée fight manfully: we cannot haue that pennie, except we labour in the vineyard:

the fruitles trée muſt be caſt into the fire. The vnprofitable ſeruant muſt be bound hand and foote, and caſt into vtter darknes.This world no place of reſt. Therefore whoſoeuer reſts here in this world, where he ſhould labour, ſhal labour in the world to come, where he thinks to reſt. Our Sauiour Chriſt promiſeth his diſciples, that when he ſhould reſt, they ſhould reſt alſo. But when did our Sauiour Chriſt reſt, ſayth Barnard? not in this world: for he went about, doing good, and reioyced as a mighty Giant to runne his courſe: therefore his diſciples muſt not looke to ſit, and reſt them in this world. It is a ſhame, ſayth Auguſtine, that the Sunne, whoſe going out is from the end of the heauen, and whoſe compaſſe is to the ends of the ſame, ſhould take any man in his bed: for may not the Sunne rightly ſay to ſuch a ſluggard, I trauelled a greater iourney yeſterday, then thou didſt, and art thou in bed after me this morning? It ſhould ſéeme, that in

               Iobs time,
                  Iob. 30 5. there was very ſtraight order taken for ſuch as liued idly, and vnthriftily: for they were chaſed foorth from among men, and euery one ſhowted at them as at a théefe.2. Theſſ. 3.10. And the Apoſtle Saint Paul maketh a ſtrict decrée againſt them, that ſuch as would not labour, ſhould not eate. So much hath Idlenes bene alwayes deteſted among good men: &amp; therefore no maruell if God brought ſuch a fearefull deſtruction vpon Sodom, whoſe Inhabitants liued in this abominable and deteſtable ſinne.
            But this people was not onely poſſeſſed with a careleſſe and ſecure ſlumber of Idlenes in their bodyes,A ſecond kind of Idlenes which was in the Sodomits. but in their ſoules alſo; they did not onely liue looſely and remiſſely in their ordinary vocations and callings, but they liued without all feare of any imminent danger, or future calamity that ſhould fall vpon them for their wickedneſſe: they liued ſinfully in their liues, &amp; ſecurely in their hearts:

Their ſinnes cryed for wrath, but they cryed, Peace, peace, there ſhall no harme happen vnto vs: they prouoked the Lord to vengeance, and yet they promiſed themſelues ſafetie. This ſlumber of the ſoule is worſe then that of the body: for it is a preſent forerunner of deſtruction: when men ſhal ſay, Peace and ſafety,2. Theſſ. 5.3. then ſhall come vpon them ſudden deſtruction, as trauell vpon a woman with childe, and they ſhall not eſcape.
                  Matt. 24.23, 24. Our Sauiour Chriſt dehorteth vs from this ſecurity, by the fearefull example of the old world; for whiles they in that age did eate and drinke, and buy and ſell, and marry wiues and were marryed, the flood came and drowned them all: ſo if wée liue and lye ſnorting vpon the careleſſe beds of ſinfull ſecuritie, the wrath of God will come ſuddenly vpon vs and deſtroy vs.2. Cor. 5.11. 1. Pet. 1.17. For this cauſe the Apoſtle perſwadeth the feare of the Lord vnto men. And S. Peter exhorteth men, to paſſe the time of their pilgrimage here

in this world in feare: and Salomon pronounceth thoſe bleſſed,
                  Pro. 28.14. that liue alwayes in feare: for they which harden their hearts, ſhall fall into euill.
            This ſecurity is one of the ſignes,Securitie a forerunner of deſtructiō. which ſhall goe before that great and finall deſtruction of the world at the laſt day: and it is ſaid, that the day of the Lord ſhall come as a thiefe in the night; euen when men are in the dead ſléepe of ſinne, then ſhall the laſt iudgement come vpon them. Whiles the Mariner ſléepes at the helme, the ſhip is ſoone run againſt a rocke.
                  Iudg. 4.21. 
               Iael doth eaſily ſtrike a nayle in the temples of Siſera, whiles he ſléepeth vnder a couering.1. Sam. 30.16, 17. 
               Dauid comming vpon the Amalechites, &amp; finding them eating and drinking and dancing, ſlew euery man of them, and recouered all the ſpoyle. So when men feare nothing, but paſſe their time in pleaſures, delights and vanities, without feare of God or his iudgements, then doth God come vpon them ſuddenly, and deſtroyes them

without mercy.
                  Mat. 24.48. Therefore our Sauiour Chriſt giues euery one warning of this careles ſecurity, and accounts him an ill ſeruant, that ſhall ſay in his heart, My maſter doth deferre his cō
               ming, and ſo beginneth to eate and drinke with the drunken, and ſmite his fellow ſeruants: The maſter of this careles and ſecure ſeruant ſhall come in a day, ſayth our Sauiour Chriſt, when he looketh not for him, &amp; in an houre that he is not aware of, &amp; will cut him off, and giue him his portion with Hypocrites, where ſhall be wéeping and gnaſhing of téeth. Seing therefore this people of Sodom laboured of ſo dangerous a Lithargy, they were iuſtly ſurpriſed with ſo ſtrange and fearefull a iudgement.
            
               The fourth ſinne of Sodom.The fourth ſinne of Sodom, was, They did not ſtrengthen ye hand of the poore, they were vnmercyfull, vncharitable and hard-hearted towards the néedy: and ſurely they could not otherwiſe be; for a proud heart, a full belly,

and a vaine, careles, idle head neuer regards ye diſtreſſed eſtate of thoſe that are in want and miſery. Other ſinnes prouoke God to wrath and indignation: but this ſinne prouokes him to deny mercy, and to become inexorable, according to that ſaying of the Apoſtle,
                  Iames. 2.13. 
               There ſhalbe iudgement merciles to him that ſheweth no mercy And the reaſon why God will ſhew no mercy to thoſe that are mercyleſſe vnto the poore, eyther in oppreſſing them, or in not relieuing them, is, becauſe he taketh all vnmercyfull and vncharitable dealing with the poore, to be an iniury done vnto his owne perſon, according to that ſaying of Salomon, He that oppreſſeth the poore, reprocheth him that made him.
            
            Thus you may well perceiue, that all the wrong that is done to the poore, the LORD doth take it as done to himſelfe: for in euery place throughout all the whole Scripture, the Lord GOD doth profeſſe himſelfe to bée

the Gardian and kéeper of the poore and néedy,God the Gardian of the poore. and acknowledgeth them to be his Wardes and Pupils: and therefore God wil reuenge himſelf in iuſtice without mercie, vpon all thoſe, which either deale vncharitably or iniuriouſly with them. Whereupon the Lord expoſtulates the matter with his people,
                  Eſay. 3.15. and demaunds of them, What they had to doe to grinde the faces of the poore? As though it were a thing that they could not iuſtifie. And to the end that all the cruell and vnmercifull of the world might know, that GOD will not ſuffer the wrongs that are done to the poore, to eſcape vnreuēged, hee proclaimes it to the world by the Prophet Dauid,
               
                  Pſ. 12.5, 6. that for the comfortleſſe troubles ſake of the needy, and becauſe of the deepe ſighing of the poore, I will vp, ſaith the Lord, and helpe euery one from him that ſwelleth againſt him, and will ſet them at reſt. As if he ſhould ſay, Though I paſſe ouer other ſinnes, and beare with

patience other indignities,Though God beare with other ſins, yet he will not beare with the ſinne of vnmercifulnes. Pro. 22.23. though I ſit ſtill and winke at other tranſgreſſions, yet when the caſe concernes the poore, when my Orphans and Wards are wronged, then I will vp, ſaith the Lord, Ile beare no longer, but I will reuenge their cauſe and relieue them. For which cauſe Salomon giues al the vnmercifull dogges of the world warning, not to bite nor deuoure theſe ſilly ſhéepe: for the Lord will defend their cauſe, ſaith he, &amp; ſpoile the ſoule of thoſe that ſpoyle them. The poore, ſaith S. Auguſtine, are Gods barnes, in which except we lay our earthly treaſures of pittie and compaſſion in this world, we ſhall not finde that heauenly treaſure of euerlaſting life in the world to come.
            Many and fearefull are the plagues which are threatned againſt thoſe which deale vnmercifully with the poore. Their prayers are abominable;The prayers of the vnmercifull, are abominable. the Lord will not heare them, though they cry vnto him in the bitterneſſe of

their ſoule.
                  Pro. 21.13. 
               He that ſtoppeth his eare at the cry of the poore, ſhall alſo cry, and not be heard.
            
            In which words, Salomō
                doth giue vs two things to vnderſtand; firſt, that the vnmercyfull men ſhall crye, how rich, how honorable, how potent and mighty ſoeuer they be, yet the Lord will lay ſome grieuous thing or other vpon them, eyther in health or in ſickneſſe, eyther in this world, or in the world to come, that ſhall make them cry, as vpon their death-bed: the guiltyneſſe of their owne conſcience, the feare of death, the horrour of hell, and dread of damnation. If God lay theſe things vpon them, they wil be inforced to cry: but if not, yet certaynly they ſhall cry in hell, with their fellow Diues;
                  Pſal. 104.21. Pſa. 147.9. Hoſe
                        •
                     . 2.21. Gen 4.10. for cry they ſhall, as Salomon ſayth: but the ſecond thing is, they ſhal not be heard. The Lions roare, and the Lord heareth them: The young Rauens cry, and he heareth them: he heares the heauens, he heares the blood

of thoſe that are murthered, and indéede he heares all things; but an vnmercyfull man, he ſhall cry, and not be heard. Diues is a notable preſident to all thoſe that are dogged and hard-hearted towards the poore; he cryed not in this world, he had his pleaſure, as many more rich men haue: but for all that, the ſaying of Salomon proued true vpon him; for though he cryed not in this world, yet he cryed in hell, I am tormented in this flame. But was he heard? Alas, no, he could not haue ſo much as a drop of cold water graunted him. This therefore is one plague, and a fearefull one alſo, which ſhall happen to all vnmercyfull, cruell and vncharitable perſons: They ſhall cry, and not be heard.
            The ſecond miſery, that ſhall befall thoſe that do not ſtrēgthen the hand of the poore, nor ſuccor them in their miſeryes, is, they ſhall not inioy ye things which they chiefly deſire to inioy,

their preſent hope ſhal be fruſtrate, and when they think thēſelues to be the ſureſt of their wiſhed deſires, euen then ſhal they be depriued of al their hopes, and ſhall neuer ſée the fruites of their labours.
                  Amos. 5.11. This doth the Lord threaten by the Prophet, Foraſmuch, he ſayth, as your treading is vpon the poore, ye haue built houſes of hewne ſtone, but yee ſhall not dwell in them, yee haue planted pleaſant vineyards,
               
                  Iob. 20.20. 
               but yee ſhall not drinke wine of them. This is the miſerie of the vnmercifull, they ſhall purchaſe, for others to inherite, they ſhall builde houſes, for others to dwell in, they ſhall get and ſcrape together, but others ſhall inioy their hopes, and carry away the fruits of their labours. Nabal, that fooliſh Churle, may ſerue for an example to confirme the truth of this vnto vs, who out of his hard, and incompaſſionate heart denyed his bread, his water, and his fleſh to Dauid and his followers in the wilderneſſe. This

               Nabal did ſheare his ſhéepe, but he neuer liued to ſell his wooll; he made a great feaſt, but hee neuer digeſted his meate: for he became as a ſtone, and dyed in tenne dayes after. So ſhal the hopes of all the vnmercifull bee fruſtrate, and they ſhall not be partakers of their wiſhed deſires, but leaue their labours for others to inioy.
            Now,The ſin of vnmercifulneſſe prouoketh God to puniſh a whole land. Amos 8.4, 8. if the ſinne of vnmercifulnes did onely prouoke God to inflict priuate and particular puniſhments vpon men, it were the more to bee borne withall: but indéed it procureth the fierce wrath of God, and his heauy iudgements vpon a whole land, and againſt a people or nation in generall: For ſo the Lord hath threatned by his Prophet, Heare this, ye that ſwallow vp the poore, that yee may make the needy of the land to faile, ſhall not the land tremble for this, and euery one mourne that dwelleth therein? So that, vnmercifull men do not onely prouoke the vengeance of God vpon

themſelues, but to the land wherein they inhabite, and to the people of the land where they dwell. No maruell then, if the Lord God brought ſuch a feareful and ſtrange puniſhment vpon Sodom and Gomorrah, and the people of that country, ſéeing this ſinne of vnmercifulneſſe was rooted amongſt them ſo, that they did not ſtrengthen the hand of the poore.
            The laſt miſerie that ſhall befal vnmercifull men, is, that laſt and dreadfull ſpeech, which ſhall be pronounced vnto them at the day of iudgement, Depart, yee curſed, into euerlaſting fire prepared for the deuil and his angels.
               The vnmerciful ſhall haue the curſe of God, which is wo euerlaſting. Then ſhal al the vnmerciful of the world know and féele, to their wofull experience, that there is a God that reuengeth the cauſe of the poore and néedie. Then they ſhall pay deare for all that they haue gotten by oppreſſiō and wrong, and by hard and vnmercifull dealing. Then ſhall they haue as much torments, as euer they had pleaſure,

and as little comfort, as euer they had mercie: depart they muſt from the preſence and fauour of God for euermore. If vnmerciful and vncharitable perſons would but think of ſuch a day, of ſuch a ſpéech, of ſuch a departure, and of ſuch a fire, they would diſtribute and giue to the poore, they would make friends of their vnrighteous Mammon, that in the world to come they might be receiued into euerlaſting habitations, and not thruſt into euerlaſting fire.
            The laſt ſinne of Sodom,
               The laſt ſinne of Sodom. was that vnnaturall ſinne, which taking the name of that citie, hath carried it euer ſince, and is called Sodomy. In ſpeaking whereof, I will follow the aduice of Simmachus, who ſaith, that it is the ſafeſt, not once to name it. Paul had not knowne what luſt meant, but that the Law ſaid, Thou ſhalt not luſt. So that ſinne tooke occaſion by the Law,
                  Rom. 7.8. to worke concupiſcence in Paul. So, if I ſhould diſcourſe of this ſinne,

you might haply ſay vnto mee, Wée had not knowne what this ſin meant, if you had not taught vs. Therefore Solō
                would not make any law againſt parricide, leſt, whiles he went about to repreſſe it by law, hee ſhould teach it rather. So if I ſhould lay open this ſinne at large, I ſhould rather teach the world it, then doe any thing elſe. I will therefore paſſe it ouer in ſilence, as not worthy once to be named.
            
               A compariſon between the ſins of Sodō and the ſinnes of EnglandThus haue we heard the deſtruction of Sodom, and the ſinnes of Sodom, which were the cauſe of her deſtruction: and now it remaines, that wee compare the ſinnes of Sodom, and the ſinnes of England together: For, if we find our ſins to be as great as the ſinnes of Sodom, we haue iuſt cauſe to expect ſome ſuch like fearefull iudgement to bee inflicted vpon vs, as was vpon that Citie, people, and countrie.
            And firſt concerning the ſin of pride, it is notorious, that we of England are no whit inferiour to thoſe of Sodom
               
in this ſinne: For, whether we conſider pride, as it is the botch of Nobilitie &amp; Honour, or the leproſie of riches, or the bile of apparell, or the ſcourge of authoritie, or the madnes of building, or the bane of good learning, certayne it is, that pride was neuer at ſuch an height, as it is amongſt vs in this age.The pride of England equall to the pride of Sodō. The Noble man will not be reproued, the rich man muſt not be mated, ye gay coate muſt be honored, authority will not yéelde, ſumptuous building muſt looke ouer the whole country, and learning makes vs ſwell aboue the banks of modeſty and ſobriety: So euery one thinks better of himſelfe then of others, and euery one in the height of their pride ſcorneth another: and herevpon comes thoſe diſſenſions, oppoſitions, contentions, diuiſions, enuy &amp; emulation amongſt vs:
                  Iudges. 5.16. for as Deborah ſung of Ruben, ſo may we ſing of our ſelues, The diuiſions of England are great thoughts of heart. Aſke the poore country Farmer, wherevpon it

is, that ſuch vnreaſonable fines are exacted of him, why his rents are ſo rackt and enhaunſt, and hee will tell thee, it is to maintaine the pride of his Land-lord &amp; Land-lady. Hoſpitalitie, charitie, patience, humilitie, &amp; almoſt all vertue both diuine and morall, are by pride exiled and baniſhed this land. The ſubiect is like the Prince, the ſeruant like the maſter, the maid like the miſtreſſe; and ſuch a confuſion and diſorder hath pride brought into this land, that euery one hath forgottē their duetie, calling and condition. The faces of the Elders are not had in honor, that ancient reuerence, which ſometime was giuen to the ſacred calling of the Clergie, pride hath now turned into great contempt; deuotion is ſcorned, we giue nothing, for pride perſwades vs, that all is too little for our ſelues. We forgiue nothing; for our pride ſtill prouokes vs to crueltie and reuenge. That humble, homely habite, which kings in former times haue vſed in

their apparell, is now of euery baſe vnthrift and prodigall companion ſcorned. Thoſe frugall faſhions, &amp; courſe ſtuffes, both for woofe and workemanſhip, which ancient times delighted in, are now turned into veluets and ſilks of moſt ſtrange and helliſh deuices. The pride and profuſion in apparell, together with the faſhions and inuentions which are vſuall in England, were not once heard of in Sodom, in the day of her iniquitie. Our women, as ſoone as they riſe, put on a Pedlers pack vpon their backs, they paint their faces, pinne their ruffes, frizzle their haire, &amp; then their dayes work is done. Many there be, whoſe apparell is more worth, then all their eſtate beſide: and very few there be, but their apparell is better then themſelues. Our Sauiour Chriſt noted the rich gluttō, for that he was clothed in purple &amp; fine linnen: but how many may he brand with ye mark of his heauy diſpleaſure, which amōgſt vs go as braue as he euery day! O that

lawes could redreſſe ye pride of England, ſhame ſuppreſſe it, or preaching breake the neck of it! but all men &amp; women haue ſo generally taken it vp, that neyther lawes, ſhame, nor preaching can take it away. There is nothing that hath vndone Gentlemen, &amp; men of other ranck, ſo much as pride and profuſion. Neyther are we euer to expect or looke for happy &amp; good dayes, till ſuch time as authority deuiſe ſome meanes, to purge out of the body of this Realme, the ſuperfluous humour of this ſinne: for it confounds all, conſumes all, vndoes all: Thus by wofull experience we haue foūd our pride to be growne to the higheſt pitch, ſo that the pride of Sodom could not excéede it.
            
               Fulnes of bread in England equall to that of Sodom.Now in the ſecond place, we are to compare the exceſſe in meate &amp; drinke, which was in Sodom, to that of our countrey of England, of whom it may be truely ſayd, that we build houſes, as though we ſhould neuer dye, and

we eate and drinke, as though we ſhould dye to morow. The very creatures cry out vpon vs for this ſinne, becauſe we abuſe them and kill them, not for our neceſſity onely, but alſo for our exceſſe and riot: we kill them, not to eate onely, but to eate them deliciouſly and intemperately. Our faſting dayes are deſpiſed, and we eſtéeme it a poynt of ſuperſtitious Popery, to obſerue dayes, and abſtayne from meats.Amb. Epiſt. 82. ad Eccle. ver. The Church in the time of Saint Ambroſe condenmed ye Iouianiſts for heretikes, becauſe they called faſting, delirium, a mockery or madnes. And haue not we them amongſt vs at this day, that hold faſting to be ſuperſtitiō? And although in former times, the time of Lent was approued and commaunded by nine ſeueral Councels and Synodes, beſides the Canon of the Apoſtles commaunding the ſame, yet we, making a God of our bellies, do, without any difference, ſerue the beaſtly deſires of the ſame. And although authority hath taken

order often, to reſtraine this our exceſſe in eating and drinking, yet when did wee pull one diſh from our tables, or withhold one morſel frō our bowels, in ſigne of obedience to authoritie, and of contrition towards God? But what doe I ſpeake of faſting, ſéeing our ſoules abhorre it, and in ſtead thereof haue intertained feaſting, in which we ſhew our ſelues to bee Gentiles rather then Chriſtians? Our feaſts are the feaſts of Sodom, and we imitate that villainous Emperor Vitellius,
               Suet. in vita Vitell. ſect. 13.
                in his inſatiable gluttony, of whom we read, that at one Supper he had prepared for him 2000. ſundry ſorts of fiſh, and 7000. ſorts of Fowle. So the multitude of diſhes, and the varietie of ſeruices, is our glorie at our feaſts. And whereas one wood doeth yeeld ſufficient ſuſtenance for many Elephants, the earth, the ayre, the ſea will hardly miniſter prouiſion for one of our feaſts: but ſtill we ſay, We are ſory we haue no cheare: and therefore

it is not poſſible, that the exceſſe of Sodom in their fulneſſe of bread, ſhould be greater then ours in England.
            The third ſinne of Sodom, was,Idlenes of England equall to that of Sodom. idleneſſe; in which ſinne, if we compare our ſelues with them, wee ſhall finde our ſelues nothing inferior vnto them. The Steward in the Goſpell, that waſted his maſters goods, confeſſed fréely that he could not worke, &amp; that he was aſhamed to beg: but we haue them amongſt vs, that can worke, and yet are not aſhamed to beg, being ſo impudent in this kind, yt neither ſhame nor lawes can reſtraine them. The Theaters, the Tauerns, ye Bowle-alleyes, the Brothel-houſes, ye fields, the ſtréets of Sodom did neuer ſwarme more thicke with ſuch vermin, then ours do, to the great diſpleaſure of Almightie God, &amp; the vnſpeakable detriment of our coū
               trie and Common-wealth. The rich ſit downe to eat and drinke, and riſe vp to play. The poore laborer was neuer more idle in his calling, thē at this day;

hee hath learned to make two dayes worke of one, &amp; he makes no cōſcience how he gets his wages, nor how he ſlubbers vp his worke. The Tradesman doth not liue on the labour of his hands, but by the tricks of his wits; and therefore is euery thing ſo deceitfull &amp; full of ſleight, becauſe idle hands haue the handling of it. Others there be, which take the paines to riſe to their dinner, and then walke to a play, and ſo returne home by a whore-houſe, thē to ſupper, and laſtly to bed: and thus they paſſe their time from day to day, as vnprofitably, as euer did Marg
                     •
                  tes, of whom it is ſayd, that he did nothing in all his life that might tend to good. Thus our Land is become a poole of ſtanding waters, &amp; a hiue of Drones, and except Authority draw foorth the ſword of correction againſt the idle lozells of this Land, they will in time deuoure all the ſwéet from the paynefull and induſtrious hand: for where no Oxen are, there the crib is empty;

and where none are that be paynefull, there is but want and beggery. Peter muſt be commaunded to caſt foorth his Nets: The watchman muſt be charged to ſtand vpon his watch, and not vpon his honour, eaſe and reputation: Caeſar muſt not ſléepe,Suet. in vita Clau. 33.
                when he ſhould adminiſter iuſtice, nor the Captayne muſt not be in the Tauerne, when he ſhould be in the field, nor the Tradesman, nor the Gentleman, nor the Laborer, muſt in no wiſe haue idleneſſe ſticke in their fingers ends; for as it was one ſinne amongſt the reſt, that procured the ouerthrow of Sodom: ſo will it together with other ſinnes, haſten our iudgement vpon vs,Wāt of mercy and charity in England without compariſon. ſéeing we haue it in as great aboūdance amongſt vs, as euer they had it amongſt them.
            And now order leades me to ye compariſon of a ſin practiſed amongſt vs, wherein indéed we ſuffer no compariſon, which is vnmercyfulnes towards the poore and néedy. Our vnmercyfull &amp; vncharitable dealing with the poore,

was not heard of in the day of Sodoms iniquity; for their vncharitableneſſe onely extended it ſelfe to ſtrangers, as farre as can bee gathered by Hiſtorie. They were inhoſpitales: they harbored no ſtrangers, but if any ſtranger happened to come into this country, they abuſed him ſtrangely and villainouſly: and for this cauſe they would haue vſed Lot ſo il, becauſe he intertained and lodged ſtrangers: following herein the cuſtome of other nations, but eſpecially of the Egyptians, who offered al ſtrangers that arriued there, vpon the altar of Buſiris, being ſometimes King of Egypt:Pined. in Iob, tom. 2. in cap. 31.
                in whoſe raigne there was a great drought in the land for the ſpace of nine yéeres: whereupon Buſiris ſent into Grecia for certain ſoothſayers to be ſent him, to the end that by them hee might be certainly informed of the cauſe of this drought: vnto whom was ſent Thaſius, a man very expert in this kind, who certified the king, that the ouerflowing of Nilus
               
could not be procured, but by the blood of ſome ſtranger offered vp to Iupiter in ſacrifice. Whereupon Buſiris
               
                  — fies Iouis hoſtia primas
                  Inquit, et Aegypto tu dabis hoſpes aquam:
               
And ſo offered this ſoothſayer ſtranger vnto Iupiter: and euer after, theſe Egyptians, in any calamitie or diſtreſſe, vſed to offer the ſtrangers that arriued amongſt them, vpō the altar of Buſiris. Frō which cuſtome of the Egyptians, other nations became very barbarous, cruell, &amp; vnmercifull vnto ſtrangers. But amongſt vs, Manaſſeh eates Ephraim, &amp; Ephraim eates Manaſſeh, and both of them eate Iuda. And it may rightly be ſaid of vs, as the Prophet ſometimes ſaid of his people, There is no mercie in the land. For whereas mercie and charity conſiſts in giuing and forgiuing, our hard &amp; vncompaſſionate hearts will ſuffer vs to giue nothing, &amp; our malicious minds will permit vs to forgiue nothing:

there was ſomtimes an age of giuing, &amp; lending: but now our pride, our couetouſneſſe, our ſelfe-loue, perſwade vs, that all is too litle for our ſelues; &amp; therfore this modern age neither giues nor lends; It may be, when we dye, then we will and bequeath, but as long as we liue, we kéepe and hold faſt. And ſurely, if the moſt charitable man that liues in this age, would but compare that which he giues to the poore, with that he ſpends and beſtowes idly, vainly, and vpon his pleaſures, he himſelfe would cry ſhame vpon his charity. The crying and complayning of the poore in our ſtréets, doth witneſſe againſt vs, that we do not ſtrengthen ye hand of the poore. There was an age, when men would haue forborne much, and haue forgiuen much: but now we go to law for euery trifling treſpaſſe, and we take our debtors by the throat, and caſt them in priſon, till they pay the vttermoſt farthing. But it may be, the Sodomits were as vnmercyfull as

we, in giuing and forgiuing: but the name of an Incloſer was not ſo much as heard of amongſt them: and happy had it beene for England, if Incloſure had neuer beene knowen.Againſt Incloſers. Eſa. 5.8, 9, 10. Wo bee to theſe Incloſers, euen that wo denounced againſt them by the Prophet: for they are the vnmercifull men of the world, they leaue no roome for the poore in the land, they appropriate that to themſelues, which cuſtome hath made common: iniurious they are to common ſociety, they pull downe houſes, ouerthrow townes, ſend men, women and children of all ſorts, the widow, &amp; the fatherleſſe, from their knowne and accuſtomed dwelling places, to ſeeke where they can thruſt in their heads. Iniurious they are to Religion,Tho. More, Eutop. lib. 1.
                and to the worſhip and ſeruice of God: for either they pull downe Churches, or if they let them ſtand, it is not for deuotion, but either to crooue their ſheep in, or elſe for ſome baſe and irreligious ſeruice: Iniurious they are to common-wealth,

by ſtraitning, ſtepping, or turning high wayes out of their right courſe, into a wrong courſe, ſo that trauellers eyther cannot paſſe at all, or elſe with great danger and feare of robbing and killing: they deſtroy tillage, whereby corne is growne both very ſcarce and extreme deare. And now that they haue incloſed and conuerted their Incloſure into paſture, they farme out their grounds at ſo deare rate, that Butter, Chéeſe, Milke, Béefe, Muttō, Veale, is at ſo exceſſiue a price, as neuer before among our forefathers. The fields of England were ſometimes compared to Chriſts coat, which was without ſeame: ſo were they eyther without hedge▪ or ditch: but now they reſemble a beggers cloke, being ful of ſeames, pieces, and patches. Theſe vnmercifull men were not heard of in Sodom; for of Sodom it is ſaid, that it was a plaine countrey:
                  Gen. 13.11. and 19.29. therefore ſhall the Sodomites riſe vp in iudgement at the laſt

day againſt our Incloſers. Cymon, the Athenian, commaunded al hedges and pales to be pluckt vp, and taken away from his grounds, to the end that both Citizens and ſtrangers might haue frée acceſſe into his fields for any thing they ſtood in need of: but the Incloſers of our age do ſet down hedges and pales, where neuer any was, to kéepe out both ſtrangers and home-borne perſons, and to abbridge them of that which cuſtome once made common to all: therefore that heathen man ſhal riſe vp in iudgement againſt the Incloſers of our age.
            Neither was the name of Engroſſer heard of in the day of Sodoms iniquitie: Theſe are they,Againſt Engroſſers. Amos 8.5. which ſwallow vp the poore; for when they haue got a commoditie into their hands, they make the Ephah ſmall, and the ſhekell great, and falſifie the weights by deceit: then they buy the poore for ſiluer, and the néedy for ſhooes, &amp; ſell the refuze of the wheat,

and their commodities at their owne price. This is a wicked generation; for they appropriate that to thēſelues, which nature hath made common to others: they care not who wéepe, ſo they may laugh: they ſéeke to bring all the water to their owne mill, neyther doe they reſpect the publike good of the Common-wealth, but onely their own priuate profit and gaine. Nature doth abhorre this kind of oppreſſion. For as it were an vnnaturall thing in the body, if one member ſhould draw vnto it all the blood and nouriſhment, which the other members ſhould bee ſtrengthened and preſerued withal; ſo is that man an vnnaturall member in the politike body of the Common-wealth, which by engroſſing, foreſtalling, and regrating, doth get into his hands any commoditie to inrich himſelfe, without due reſpect of the good of others.C. de M
                     •
                  n. lib. Iube. The ciuill law doth condemne theſe kind of men, as moſt pernicious and hurtfull to the State where they liue, &amp; therefore

all their goods are by the ciuill law confiſcate, and they themſelues for euer baniſhed: and the Magiſtrate which did conniue and winke at ſuch perſons, was to loſe fifty pounds, for ſuffering ſuch perſons to practiſe ſuch vnlawfull meanes to enrich themſelues by. And all Diuines doe hold, that Monopolies are directly againſt the eight Cōmandement, Thou ſhalt not ſteale: proouing it to bee a kind of publike theft. And yet though nature abhorre it, the Ciuill law condemne it, &amp; the Law of God forbid it; the practiſe of it is common amongſt vs at this day, and many haue riſen to the height of that greatnes which now they inioy, onely by this meanes, to the great diſhonour of Almighty God, contempt of law, vndoing of many hundreds in particular, and the publike detriment of the Common-wealth in generall.
            The vnmercifull vſury of our age farre exceeds all that euer hath beene before vs:Againſt vſury. All ages before vs haue

condemned it for a ſinne, but we haue thoſe in this age, that dare vndertake to defend it to be no ſinne. Vſury hath alwayes drawne her name from byting: but now ſhee may well haue her name of deuouring; for vſury, as it is practiſed amongſt vs, doth not only bite, but deuoure. The Vſurer in time paſt was excommunicated, as a man not worthy of the ſociety and communion of Saints; hee was depriued of Chriſtian buriall, as though hee were not worthy to lye in the earth, but in hell; he was not permitted to make a will at his death, as though his goods were not his owne: but now they are accounted worthy of the beſt company, our Churches are profaned with their ſepulchres, and their wils and Teſtaments haue as good approbation, as theirs, who haue gotten their goods moſt truely and vprightly. Thus we doe not onely defend the ſinne which our forefathers haue condemned, but wee approoue, reuerence, and iuſtifie

the ſinner, which GOD will condemne: and therefore wee ſurmount all that haue beene before vs in our ſinnes.
            What ſhall I ſay to the workemaſters of our time?Againſt the vnmerciful dealing of work maſters. Neuer were there ſuch vnmercifull perſons heard of, as ſome of them bee: if I ſhould ſpeake what I could, it might ſéeme vncredible, that euer there ſhould be ſuch vnmercifull courſes among Chriſtians. Theſe are they which grind the faces of the poore Tradeſman, by changing his wages ſeuen times, as Iacob ſaid to Laban: for eyther they deteyne the workmans wages, or they abate them, or they change them, or reckon them ſhort, or pay them in ſuch commodities as is to be wondred at. And ſurely, great pity it is, yt ſome mercifull man or other doth not take in hād to redreſſe this oppreſſion of the workemaſters: but if the poore Tradeſman ſhould complaine, or ſéeke redreſſe, then hee ſhould loſe all, and cleane thruſt

himſelfe out of cuſtome for all worke. Thus muſt hee take all, and hold himſelfe content, or loſe all, and be content whether he will or not. Was there euer ſuch a lamentable thing heard of, that the workeman liuing in his calling, according to the law which God firſt layd vpon man, In the ſweat of thy browes ſhalt thou get thy liuing, ſhould notwithſtanding, contrary to that law, bee wronged of his wages which are the ſtay of his liuing? Oh ye vnmercifull men of the world, haue you none to oppreſſe but ye poore workman? haue you not read, Thou ſhalt not muzzell the mouth of the Oxe that treadeth out of the corne? If man owe a duty of mercy to the vnreaſonable creature which laboureth for him, much more doth he owe a duty &amp; right to man, which is his owne mould, and ſhould not muzzell vp the mouth of the workeman, his wife &amp; children, by vnconſcionable courſes in his wages: for the like was neuer heard of in Sodom.

Thus are wee vnmercifull in giuing, vnmercifull in forgiuing, vnmercifull in lending, vnmercifull in paying, vnmercifull in buying and ſelling: ſo that it may iuſtly be ſaid of vs, which was ſaid of the Sodomites, They ſtrengthen not the hand of the poore &amp; néedy.
            Thus haue we found, by comparing our ſinnes with the ſinnes of Sodom, that wee are nothing behind them in our ſinnes; if we excéed them not, wee are ſurely equall with them. It is ſaid of the ſinnes of Sodom, that they cryed in the eares of the Lord: and ſurely our ſinnes are as ſaucy and impudent, as euer were theirs; and if theirs cryed,Sinnes of England, crying ſinnes. ours are not tongue-tide, I warrant you: we reach home to them with our wickedneſſe. The ſinnes of Sodom were growne to their full height, &amp; ſo are ours. For it is impoſſible, that any man or womā in theſe dayes, ſhould adde any thing to the ſins which they practiſe: ſo that as in a general plague, it is not ſuch a maruell at thoſe which

dye, as it is at thoſe which eſcape: ſo in this generall infection of ſinne, wherewith the world at this day is defiled, wee are not ſo much to maruell that there be ſo many bad, as that there be any good. Now when the ſinnes of a people grow to that height, that they come to be crying ſins, then vengeance loyters not, deſtruction comes ſpéedily.
            When the LORD had taken knowledge of the cry of the ſinnes of Sodom, and had found their ſins to be according to the cry, euen the next day he rained fire and brimſtone from heauen, and deſtroyed them all. So, when the Lord ſhal finde our ſinnes at their full height, he will ſpéedily bring his iudgements vpon vs, and deſtroy vs: for as the huſbandman thruſts the ſickle into the Corne, when it is perfitly ripe; and as the Oxe is brought to the ſlaughter, when hee is fat: ſo deſtruction comes vpon men, when the meaſure of ſinne is fulfilled.
            
               Now,The ſinnes of England at the ful height. that our ſinnes are at their height, and are growne to their perfit ripeneſſe, it is manifeſt; becauſe they are equall with the ſinnes of Sodom, as hath béen already prooued, and alſo, becauſe there can not be any addition made in the ſeueral humors and diſpoſitions of men, to the ſinnes which they practiſe. But admit, theſe two reaſons ſhall not bee thought of trueth ſufficent, to confirme the height and ripeneſſe of our ſins, I will adde foure infallible arguments, to proue the ripeneſſe of ſinne.
            Firſt, when ſinne is directly committed  againſt God, againſt nature,The height and ripeneſſe of ſinne, prooued by foure arguments. and againſt humane ſociety, of which ſort our ſinnes be: they are directly againſt God, witneſſe our horrible ſwearing and forſwearing, and our fearefull blapheming of the moſt holy and bleſſed Name of GOD, and our prophane vnhallowing of his Sabboth, together with the contempt of his word, and neglect of his

Miniſters: They are againſt nature, witneſſe ye filthy ſinne of Sodomy, of which this Land of ours can not cleare it ſelf; as alſo the Inceſt, the Parricide, the Fratricide, the Cooſen-germane marriages which are committed amongſt vs: &amp; they are againſt humane ſocietie, witneſſe our incloſing, our ingroſſing, our cruelty, extortion, oppreſſion, robberies, murders, and ſuch like.
            
                Secondly, the generality of ſinne doth prooue the ripenes of ſinne, when not a few, but a whole multitude are corrupt: and ſuch is our eſtate, a generall infection of ſinne hath runne ouer the whole Land, ſo that except the Lord had left vnto vs a ſmall remnant, we ſhould haue beene as Sodom, and like vnto Gomorrah.
            
                Thirdly, the impudency of the ſinner doth prooue the ripeneſſe of ſin, as when men are not aſhamed to tranſgreſſe openly, and alſo to bragge and boaſt of their ſinnes: and ſuch haue we amongſt vs, as might be inſtanced by

men of note, if it were expedient to particularize.
            Laſtly, when the ſinner is not humbled, nor amended by puniſhments, &amp; iudgements inflicted vpon him, it is a true marke that his ſin is at the height: and herein haue we ſhewed our ſelues to bee incorrigible: The Lord hath threatned vs with warre, he hath plagued vs with the peſtilence, hee hath pinched vs with ſcarcity &amp; dearth, and yet wee are not bettered, there is no turning vnto God,More tokens of Gods wrath againſt vs within fewe yeeres, then of long time before. but wee fall away more and more: our ſinnes therefore being at the height, the fierce wrath of God muſt néeds be euen néere at hand, and ready to be executed vpon vs. And will you haue ſuch likely-hoods, as may perſwade the trueth thereof vnto vs? Then wryte my words in tables, yt they may bee monuments for later dayes; for when your childrens childrē ſhall heare of them hereafter, they will bee aſtoniſhed at them. The moneths of the yéere haue not yet gone about

eight times in their courſes, wherein the Lord hath ſhewed more tokens of his intended &amp; approaching wrath, then the agedſt man in our Land is able to recount of in ſo ſmall a time. The winds haue beene ſo outragious &amp; violent, as though the foure ends of heauen had conſpired to turne the foundations of the earth vpſide downe. The anger of the clouds hath béene powred downe vpon vs in ſuch abundance, as hath béene both vnſeaſonable for the time, and vnprofitable for the earth. The heauens aboue vs haue beene turned to braſſe, and the earth beneath vs into iron, which hath wrought ſuch effects, that the child vnborne ſhall ſpeake of it. The ſea, with vnwonted inundations, hath attempted to bring the Land within the territorie thereof. The fire, as an Ambaſſadour of the laſt vengeance, hath moſt fiercely raged in all parts of our Land. Treaſons many, mighty &amp; mōſtrous, neuer before heard of, or imagined,

haue beene plotted and contriued againſt our moſt dread &amp; Soueraigne, our Quéene and Royall Iſſue, intending the vtter ouerthrow of Kingdome, State, and Countrey.
            The Commons haue riſen, pretending themſelues wrongd in their commons, indangering the common peace and tranquillitie of the Common-wealth.
            The arrowes of a woful peſtilence haue beene caſt abroad at large in all the quarters of our Land. A preſent dearth without ſcarcity, doth pinch vs, bringing pouerty like a way-faring man vpon vs.
            Our Summer is turned into Winter, our cheapeneſſe of all things into dearth.
            The ſkies lowre vpon vs, becauſe their Creatour is angry at vs. The Sunne hideth from vs his gladſome light, as though wee were not worthy to inioy it.
            The clouds, night and day, do let fal

ſhowres of teares, bemoaning the miſeries which God hath determined to bring vpon vs. And thus all the creatures doe threaten and foreſhew our approching deſtruction: yet wee, more ſenceleſſe then ye inſenſible creatures, neither feare any thing, nor ſuſpect any thing. Well, there muſt bee an end of ſinning, or elſe God will make an end of vs.There muſt be a turning vnto God on our parts, before God will turn vnto vs. There muſt be a turning vnto God, or elſe God wil not turn vnto vs. If our ſins be the ſins of Sodom, our iudgement muſt bee the iudgement of Sodom. There muſt be ſome end of our ſinnes, or if Moſes and Samuel, with all the holy Angels, were amongſt vs, to beſtow both their preaching and their prayers that wee might be ſaued, they ſhould ſaue but their owne ſoules, and neither vs, nor our ſonnes and daughters: Wee are not ſinners of yeſterday▪ wee are not Nouices in the ſchoole of Sathan: but we haue long troden the pathes of vngodlineſſe, &amp; wearied our ſelues in

the wayes of wickedneſſe. We haue wearied the tongues of ye Lords Miniſters, and grieued the ſoules of thoſe Preachers that haue bin ſent vnto vs, in ſéeing their labour loſt vpon vs; they haue preacht in ſeaſon, &amp; out of ſeaſon, they haue brought out of their treaſures things both new &amp; old, they haue giuen vs milke, and ſtrong meat, they haue come in the ſpirit of gentleneſſe, and with a rod, they haue entreated, threatned, preached mercy, &amp; preached iudgement, and yet all this without ſucceſſe: for we haue beene like ye deafe Adder, ſtopping our eares, &amp; refuſing to heare the voice of the Charmer, charming ſwéetly vnto vs.
            Hearken now, I pray you, and bee iudges your ſelues, O ye inhabitants of England, if ye men of Sodom might haue had thoſe meanes to haue drawne them to repentance, which you haue had, would they not haue broght forth fruits more worthy of repentance then you haue done? Therefore ſhall they

riſe vp in ye day of Iudgement againſt you. Let this Alarum, giuen you by Sodō &amp; her Cities, be a warning vnto vs all, to eſchew their ſins, leſt we burn in their iudgements. Let vs al, frō the higheſt to the loweſt, fall downe and knéele before the Lord our maker: let vs lye low before the footſtoole of his Maieſty, and with all ſubmiſſion both of body and minde, acknowledge our ſinnes, &amp; preuent the intended wrath of God againſt vs, by our true &amp; hearty repentance. For the Lord is our God, and will, and muſt be ſerued of vs: hée is our Lord, &amp; wil, and muſt be honoured of vs: he is our Father, &amp; will, and muſt be obeyed of vs: he is our Iudge, and dreadfull Reuenger, and will eyther bee feared of vs, or elſe hee will reuenge himſelfe vpon vs.
            FINIS.
