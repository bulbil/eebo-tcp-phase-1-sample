            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               HAuing had the good happe
(among other aduentures
of Presse) to Print (not long
since) sundry small fragments
full both of honest
reuelation for Wit, and vseful obseruation
for Wisedome; fit to please and profit
the wel-disposed. And perceiuing the
same (accordingly) to haue found generall
approbation and applause: howbeit
(I must ingeniously confesse:) neither
so orderly disgested by the P
                  •
               nne, nor so

exactly corrected at the Presse (by reason
of some vnseasonable hast:) as both
the Author and my selfe haue since seriously
wished. Now therefore, at better
leasure (for your greater delight in reading,
and ease in finding:) I haue here
(with the helpe of a skilfull and industridustrious
friend) Methodically reduced
all into this Rich Cabinet; doubly
furnished with ample Addition of newe
Treasures of diuers kinds: which

               Affinitie.
               This wel may be the weake ones strong defence;
               And strōg ones weaknes may proceed frō hence.
               
                  AFfinitie cannot haue greater
glory, then when the father
is wise; the children vertuous;
the brothers kinde; the
cosins louing; and the kinred
conformable.
               Affinity is happy, where cosins &amp; nephewes
are well bred, and kinde consorts; sisters
are modest and gracious maidens; brothers

are naturall and indiuiduall friends;
children obedient and pleasing to their
parents; wiues are vertuous and submisse
to their husbands, and wise and careful to
gouerne their housholds.
               Aff
                     •
                  nity degenerating in honesty, is like
foule scabs in a faire skinne: such Affines
brings as much credit &amp; comfort to their
friends, as do lyce in their clothes; &amp; they
are much like of a lousie condition: they
will cleaue close vnto you, while you haue
bloud to feede them; but if you begin to
die, or decay, they goe from them that
breed them.
               Affinity doth sometimes shew a catalogue
of kinsmen, but a blank of friends. For it is
not the similitude of titles or names, but
the resemblance of like true and tender affection
and harts, wherein the reality of
right, and naturall affinity consists.
               Affinity of faire words and false hearts, are
like Tantalus his apples, they are euer
hanging round about him, but he may die
for hunger, before he shall taste them. Or
they are like the apples of Sodom, that are
faire without, and dust within. Good for
nothing but to deceiue hungry passengers,

who would, but cannot feed vpon them.
               Affinity is pleased, when the children and
childrens children, prooue the Parents delight;
but if vngracious, they are more
charge then comfort.
               Affinity with needy and penurious friends,
is like a stemme, that hath many suckers or
vnder-plants; which are still drawing the
iuyce away from the great and maine root,
but themselues neuer bring forth a handful
of fruit.
               Affinity hath that priuiledge, that in lordly
houses, and of inheritors, there ought to
be the haunts of brothers, cosins, nephews,
vnckles, and all other of his kin; bearing
good will to their affaires, &amp; supporting
their necessities: in such wi
                     •
                  e, that to them
is no houre forbidden, or dore shut; neuerthelesse,
there are some brothers, cosins,
and nephewes so tedious in speech, so
importunate in visiting, and so without
measure in crauing, that they make a man
angry, and also abhorre them; and the remedy
to such, is to appart their conuersations,
and succour their necess
                     •
                  ties.
               Affinity makes men presume in offences:
but heere lies the danger, when kinsmen

fall out indeed, they are at deadly food,
and commonly irreconcileable: therefore
a care must be had of the occasion, and a
cunning to contriue a pacification.
               Affinity setteth whole families many times
at variance, euen to the drawing of strangers
to take part: but when an attonement
is contriued, the rest are not only condemned,
but pay for the mischiefe, when a
mans bloud returnes, and feare of ouerthrowing
the whole family keepes malice
in restraint.
            
            
               Anger.
               Ire's good and bad: if good, it still doth swell
               At ill: if b
                     •
                  d, it frets at dooing well.
               ANger is the heat of bloud, as feare the
defect of nature: but in both temperance
bringeth men to perfection.
               Anger and Enuy makes the body leane, and
ma
                     •
                  erates the minde, when it had need of
rest
                     •
                  u
                     •
                  ation by rest.
               Anger is sometimes manly, as griefe vvith
reason is naturall▪ but to be outragious

is beastly, and to cry, childish.
               Anger without discretion turneth into furie,
and continuing without restraint, endeth
in sorow.
               Anger vpon good cause is wis
                     •
                  dome, and
against sinne, honesty; and without sinne,
holinesse: but to braule and swagger is vnciuell.
               Anger without force, is like a lustfull Eunuch,
willing but weak; or like a mocked
old man, that holds vp his staffe, but cannot
strike: in both, a man shall show folly
in willingnes to hurt, and inability to execute.
               Anger bringeth hastie spirits in danger of
hurt; and when the passion is cooled by
consideration, repentance followes: but
if it be too late, it is subiect to derision.
               Anger and excesse of meates, are great enemies
to health. For meats doe corrupt the
humors, and anger consumeth the bones:
so that if men did not eate ouermuch, and
would not be ouer-angry, there should be
little cause to be sick, and much lesse of
whom to complaine. For the whips that
do most scourge our miserable life, are ordinary
excesse, and deepe anger.
               
                  
Anger, made great Alexander (like the least
part of himselfe) kill his minionized friend
Clytus: for, had it been drunkennesse, hee
would haue tapt out his hart bloud before
he heard him speake: for▪ drunkennesse is
an afternoones madnesse, and can do nothing
aduisedly. But it was bold, through
friendly reprofe from Clytus, stird Alexander
to ire; ire increasing by exasperation,
became furie; furie enflamed by the wildfire
of desperate rage, could not be quenched
but with the life-bloud as it were of
his own (or one he lou'd as his own) hart.
Whereupon ensued too late repentance;
which grew to such excesse of sorrow, as
diuided the King (as mad) from himselfe;
and almost life from the King; who would
haue made his proper hands reuenge vpon
himselfe that improper act, had not his
friends watchfull care matched his bloudie
carelesnesse.
               Anger makes men sad, melancholy, heauy,
sorowfull, and of an euill colour: whereas
those that be mery &amp; glad, be alwaies fat,
whole, and well coloured: so that without
comparison, there be more which growe
sick by anger they entertaine, then of the

meates they feed vpon.
               Anger must not reuenge euery iniurie; for
so shall a man neuer want worke, neuer
want woe, but shall put his peace and felicitie
in the power of euery enemy, vassal,
or boy. He that wil goe to law vpon euery
wrong, shal sildom gaine either credite or
coine by the bargaine. After he hath forsaken
his rest, imployd his cogitation,
spent his time, mony, friends and paine,
turnd slaue to his Lawyer, and his owne
passion to haue his will on his aduersary,
hee shall be a great looser by such a victorie.
               Hee that will liue in the world and put vp
no iniuries, is like him that sits and fights
with a hiue of Bees: hee may crush, &amp; kill
many of them, but were much better to let
them alone. For he shall be sure to be continually
stung, in body or minde, in goods
or good name.
               Anger of a Superiour prouoked by iust ocsion,
may with conscience and credite proceed
to moderate castigation: but must
take heed of tormenting, least the offender
inforced to repell outrage and violence,
returne a mischiefe in his owne defence:

or at lest discredite his Superiour by an
out-cry or vproare, if he can do no more.
               Anger must needs be auoided in officers of
authoritie. For they ought to be honest in
their liues, vpright in iustice, patient in
iniuries, measured in their speech, iustified
in that they commaund, righteous in
iudgement, and pittifull in execution.
               Anger is many times so beastly, that Magistrates
or ministers of iustice, doe dishonour,
misuse, shame and despise such as
come to audience: so that the sorowfull
sutor doth more feele a rough word they
speake, then the iustice they dilate.
               Anger is no other thing but an inflamation
of the bloud, as Aristides saith, and an alteration
of the hart. Possidoniu
                        •
                     
                   calleth it
a short foolishnes: Tully saith, that vvhat
the Latines call anger, the Greekes name
vengeance. Aeschines saith, that ire was
caused of the fume of the gall, &amp; the heat
of the heart. And Macrobius saith, that
anger groweth of some occasion, and testinesse
of euill condition.
               Anger hath certaine priuiledges, or if you
will, notes of discouery: not to belieue
our friends, to be rash in attempts, to haue

the cheekes inflamed, to vse quicknesse
with the hands, to haue an vnbrideled
tongue, to be fumish and ouerthwart for
small causes, and to admit of no reason.
               Anger put vs to the triall of reason, vvhether
wee differ from beasts. For they indeed
enraged, runne vpon one another for
reuenge: but men must consider the cause,
the euent, and circumstances of repentance.
               Anger not onely transformes vs into fooles,
but also makes vs to bee abhorred of others.
               Anger is sometimes a touchstone of vvisedome:
for Socr
                        •
                     tes holding a dagger readie
to strike his seruant, remembring himselfe,
refrained because he was angry, and
so might haue exceeded moderation.
Which meditation brideled Plato also
vpon the like occasion.
               Anger lifteth the heart to a mans tongue,
vvhen a vvise man keepeth his tongue in
his heart.
            
            
               
               Atheisme.
               When beasts &amp; kinde 
                     •
                  iends God confesse, what thē
               
               Are men denying him? 
                     •
                  iends made of men.
               ATheisme maketh men worse then
beasts, or diuels. For they belieue &amp;
tremble, when men neither feare God, nor
the diuell, and therefore deserue a double
hell.
               Atheisme maketh Witches and Coniurers
hells agents; and he that seeketh to them
for help, goeth to the diuell by atturny.
               Atheisme bringeth men to disobedience:
for they are neither comforted with promises
from God, nor terrified with the
punishments from hell; whereas yet the
Oxe yeelds his necke to the yoke, the
hound is at commaund of the huntsman,
and the hawke stoopes down to the lure.
               Atheisme and blasphemy are the high-way
to hell, and maketh lies and stabs agents
for the gallowes.
               Atheisme maketh plenty of oathes, and hee
that trusts them, is like him, which talks

to the winde, and may haue aire for his
answere.
               Atheisme is the studie of the damned, and
the diuell is author of the doctrine: for
although men belieue there is no God, &amp;
so by consequence no diuell: yet therein is
the cunning of the diuel more apparant, to
harden their harts against the truth.
               Atheisme is disputable, whether it proceed
from pride or ignorance: for although
Idolaters are not properly called Atheists,
because they worship a dietie in the abominable
deceit of representments; yet was
Pharaohs host destroied for hardnesse of
hart, &amp; contempt of religion. So we may
say of the worlds inundation, the building
of Babel, and the burning of Sodome.
               
               Atheisme made the Giants war against the
Gods, and Salmoneus of Italy inuent fireworks
to throwe vp into the element against
thunder and lightning.
               Atheisme can yeeld neither reason for the
wilfulnesse, nor comfort in such opinion:
for if there be no world after death, nor
other life to be expected, how miserable
is man to endure affliction, &amp; how wretched

satisfie a present lust, neither danger is
feared, nor any following euent mistrusted.
               Beauty in a foole is a disgrace to nature;
and for an old man to dote on a faire face,
is a discredite to wisedome. For a gray
head, and wanton hart are ill suted.
               Beauty in a woman that is honest and not
proud, is like faire weather in haruest, both
to comfort and profit.
               Beauty of nature is vertue, and the due of
vertue is honour.
               Beauty blinds a vaine eye, musick drownes
an idle 
                     •
                  are, but reason rules a good wit, &amp;
grace doth blesse an humble soule.
               Beauty is the witch of nature, as gold is the
god of the world: so that a woman without
beauty hath few followers, as a man
without money hath few friends.
               Beauty is much blemished, when a vvoman
wanteth her teeth, and a man his beard:
but vertue in the one, and wisedom in the
other, ouercommeth natures imperfection
and defects.
               Beauty that is painted, resembles an idole,
and hee that worshippeth it is an idolater.
For as the one is made artificiall to the dishonour

of the deitie: so the other is marred
by cunning to the disgrace of nature.
               Beauty that breedeth loue is the forgetfulnesse
of reason, and their wits are troubled
with the studie of idlenes.
               Beauty in a strumpet, is a faire ripened fruit
to please the eye, but if it be rotten at the
hart, it cannot relish the taste.
               Beauty of women ouercomes the weaknes
of husbands; whereupon Themistocles son
merily vpon a day brake out into this pretie
speech, touching his mothers power in
the state; What I will, my mother will,
what my mother will, Themistocles vvill,
and what Themistocles will, the people of
Athens will.
               Beauty is one of the three things, that alters
the condition and nature of man: for Aristotle
obserued, that pride, women, and
wine, ouercame all the world.
               Beauty of Apame in Esdras, ouerawed Darius
greatnes. For as hee tooke her in his
armes to gaze vpon, shee would take the
crown off his head to play withall: sometimes
putting it on her owne, and then againe
on his.
               Beauty is held a diuine grace, and of the

ancient Phylosophers much esteemed. For
Socrates named it the tyrant of short time:
Plato a priuiledge of nature: Theophrastus,
a silent deceit: Theocrites, a delightful
hurt: Carneades, a solitarie kingdom: Domitius
said nothing was more gratefull:
Aristotle, a tongue-tied eloquence: Homer,
the glory of nature: and Ouid, a grace
of God.
               Beauty of the world pleaseth the eye of nature:
but the contemplation of heauen
rauisheth the soules of the Elect: so that
there is great difference in outward and
spirituall beauty.
               Beauty and comlinesse euen make beasts
proud: for when a horse is young, vvell
shaped, perfectly managed, and richly adorned,
he is as proud of his own beauty:
as his master, that hath him to serue his
turne.
               Beauty of a new house may consist in outward
building, &amp; faile in seruiceable continuance:
when an old Castell is stronger
for defence, and will endure to the owners
profit.
               Beauty of the proudest is momentary: for
age &amp; sicknes are her enemies, that many

times they preuent her ostentation with
vntimely accidents.
               Beauty sooner ouercommeth old men, then
enflameth youth: for old wood doth sooner
burne then greene sticks. But then it is
strange, how ridiculous they make their
grauity, which should rather be imploied
to study in bookes for wisedome, then
looke on babies for recreation.
               Beauty of a curtisan is a meere trap to deceiue
one, and a worse danger: for the one
peraduenture catcheth but our goods, or
bodies; but the other rauisheth both our
senses and harts.
               Beauty is a very Lamia of wit: for Samocratius,
Nigidius, and Ouid writ many
bookes of the remidies of loue, and vsed
none themselues. So they all three died,
persecuted, and banished, not for those
offences they committed in Rome, but for
the loues they attempted in Capua.
               
               Beauty of curtizans cannot be auoided, but
by flying the conuersation, and eschewing
the occasion: for in causes of loue; wee
doe see many escape, that absent themselues;
but very few, that tary &amp; abide it.
            
            
               
               Birth.
               Birth to the bodyes life doth entrance giue▪
               
               And Death vnto the soules: then die to liue.
               BIrth bringeth life into light, &amp; a good
life is better then a learned: for hee
knoweth enough, that from his birth keepeth
an vnspotted conscience.
               Birth is like a messenger of gladsome tydings:
for how euer the night may be full
of sorow, yet ioy commeth in the morning,
that a man-child is brought into the
world.
               Birth &amp; life enioy the vse of sence, but the
soule hath the vse of reason: and therfore
as the reasonable soule is more precious
then life: so ought the life to bee spent to
prouide, and regard for the soule.
               Birth bringeth vs into a laborinth of sorowes,
and therefore not to bee loued:
when death is but a short paine, and therfore
not to be feared.
               Birth and life full of offences make men miserable,
but to die vnfaithfull, is vnpardonable.

               Benefits.
               Vnthankefull men hurt others: for they let
               The hand of Grace to pay kind Natures debt.
               BEnefits without all exaction require all
thankfulnesse: we must therefore blesse
God for his bounty; be ioyfull in his mercie,
and faithfull in our loue toward him
for both.
               Benefits haue sometimes a taste of bribery,
and there is a fault both in the giuer &amp; receiuer;
if honour be thereby purchased.
               Benefits of magnificence are not measured
by the smal desert of the receiuer, but the
noble bounty and disposition of the rewarder:
so Alexander giuing a citie to an
inferior person, who thought it ouermuch
for his merit, answered him, that though
it was too much for him to receiue, it was
not too much for Alexander to giue.
               Benefits growe weary euen in common passages,
when men bee ingratefull: but to
make comparisons for good turnes, breedeth
an euerlasting hatred.
               
                  
Benefits that are weake make a mans trauaile
greeuous, and when they seem wrested
perforce, they lose a grace in their acceptation;
whereas a timely reward is like
raine to a barren land, or a pleasant shewer
in a distempered drought.
               Benefits haue an excellent sound in their signification,
&amp; Etimologie: for being deriued
of bene-faciens, or doing well, they must
needs do well, that bestow good turnes, as
they doe not amisse, that deserue them.
               Benefits makes beasts remember their benefactors:
For in the story of Andronicus
the slaue, when he was to be cast into the
Lions denne at Rome, the principall and
strongest amongst them, not onely abstained
from hurting him himselfe, but
kept others apart from any outrage against
him. And this was the cause; this
Lion he had healed long before in Affrica,
when he ran from his Mr. and hid himselfe
in his caue, which now remembred him in
requital in Rome, when he was there to be
deuoured. The story is in Aulus Gelius, and
enlarged by Gueuara in his Epistles.
               Benefits bestowd without desert shew some
want of iudgement, but receiued without

requitall, or thankfulnesse, absolutely conclude
an vnmannerly and ill conditioned
man.
               Benefits in time are the true blessings of
friendship, otherwise, they may come
when wee need them not, and so lose the
grace of acceptation: or too too late, and
so lose the life of their effects: thus an early
frost is ill for fruit, and great raine noysome
in haruest.
               Benefits from God are blessednesse in this
life, and eternitie hereafter; which vvho
will attaine to, must giue much, take little,
seeke nothing, and be thankfull whatsoeuer
falls out.
               Benefits from the suns light are not helpfull
to the blind, &amp; litle profiteth riches where
the miser is: we must therefore do good,
while we liue, &amp; bestowe our good, where
we may doe good.
               Benefits of good are quickly forgotten, and
nature is corrupted, where the drosse of
the earth drawes a man to the diuell.
               Benefits sometimes make a man proud and
elated, when a man requited for a good action
supposeth by and by his owne worth
extraordinarie; and so either vilipendeth

the recompence, or esteemeth better of
himselfe, then he deserueth.
               Benefits after death makes the graue thank
a man for his bountie, and he that is miserable
in life is a steward for hell.
               Benefits receiued for flattery, are worse
then punishments suffered for truth.
               Benefits are excellent trialls of mens dispositions:
for he that taketh in worth a smal
reward, shall bee sure of a greater: but
hee that growes proud of a great one,
shall want a small one; and hee that cares
for none at all, meanes neuer to impart any
to others.
               Benefits wherein Courtiers reioyce, are as
they are bound to serue Princes, they haue
licence to craue of them: as they endure
many encombrances, so they hope for
great preferment: as they toile in many
iourneys, so they participate of diuerse
pleasures: as they endure night watches,
they are glad of daily newes: as they spend
their owne substance, so they supply their
home necessities: and as they wearie out
their toilsome bodies, so they recreate
their disquieted mindes, and at last according
to their degrees growe forward to
preferment.
               
                  
Benefits multiplied to temporall prosperitie,
&amp; loued after with continuall greedinesse,
shew some token of following mishap.
               Benefits tie vs to obseruation, and keepe
an honest man from speaking his minde:
so somtimes vertue is betraied to wealth,
and conscience made a slaue to respect.
            
            
               Couetousnesse.
               This is an ill which doth good most abuse,
               Because it loues the good it hates to vse.
               COuetousnesse maketh rich heires for a
time, but he that is blest of GOD, is
happy in his posteritie for euer.
               Couetousnes is a spirituall idolatry, an vnnatural
misery, a rich mans beggery, a wise
mans mockery, a proud mans theeuery, a
poore mans tyranny, a great mans infamy,
and a meane mans disquiet.
               Couetousnes eateth vp the beauty of a commonwealth,
the honor of a kingdome, the
hart of the poore, &amp; the soule of the rich.
               
                  
Couetousnesse fills the Vsurers chest vvith
trash, the poore mans eyes with teares, the
good mans eares with wroth, the mouth
of the distressed with curses, and the diuels
hands with soules.
               Couetousnesse is base in a King, vncomely
in a Court, dishonourable in a Captaine,
prophane in a Churchman, vnnaturall in a
whore, miserable in a Gentileman, vnprofitable
in a foole, and dangerous in a Merchant
himselfe.
               Couetousnesse is such an enemie to the
magnificence of Princes, that Titus the
Emperous vvas vvont to say, he had lost
that time, vvherein he did not some good
turne, or bestowed a reward.
               Couetousnesse is so great an enemie to
the happinesse of life, that Alexander
cryed out, there vvas nor life, nor delight
in life, but to be liberall, and to requite
good turnes.
               Couetousnes is so contrary to the nature of
a noble &amp; valiant Captaine, that Theopontus
the Thebane gaue his shooes off his
his feet to a souldier demaunding mony to
buy bread, saying plainly, thogh I haue no
mony, it is better that I goe barefoot, then

thou an hungred.
               Couetousnesse is an enemy to charitie, the
inuenter of vsury, the plotter of misery,
and the breach of amity.
               Couetousnesse feedes vpon prodigalitie,
liues in penury, delights in scarsitie, and
dies in misery.
               Couetousnesse makes the whores spring,
and the bawds haruest, the vsurers Christmas,
and the prodigalls lent.
               Couetousnesse makes the Lawyer vnconscionable,
the Iudge vncharitable, the
theefe vngracious, and the hangman vnmercifull.
               Couetousnes made Laban a deceiuer, Naball
a churle, Gehezie a leper, and Iudas a
traytor.
               Couetousnes is the roote of all euill.
               Couetousnes should be so far from the hart
of Kings, that they must not onely abhor
it in others, but not practise it themselues.
For thus one way Galba lost his life and
Empire; and another way Dionisius the
tyrant reprehended his sonne for keeping
certaine iewels hee had: saying, Sonne, I
gaue thee these iewels to bestowe, and not
to hoord vp.
               
                  
Couetousnes and Honor bee so contrarie,
that they neuer dwell in one person, nor
at any time had any aff
                     •
                  nity.
               Couetousnes is contrary to all other vices,
for euery other vicious man hath some tast
in his sinnes, &amp; intemperate humors: but
the most vnfortunate couetous niggard is
tormented with that, which others doe
possesse, &amp; takes no comfort in that, which
he hath himselfe.
               Couetousnesse is euer accompanied vvith
feare &amp; suspition; either the raging flouds
cary away his mills, the cattell eate vp his
medowes, the mildew blasteth his corne,
the hunters breake his fences, the thieues
rob his treasure, &amp; the family spends more
then he is able to maintaine.
               Couetousnesse is a wicked and secret theeuerie:
for how euer a miser keepeth his
goods from others, he robbeth nature of
her blessings, and debarreth himselfe euen
of necessary substance.
               Couetousnes seeketh euer to hoord vp: wisheth
that no man craue of him: hideth
his head from spending: keepeth his hands
from giuing: dares not stirre out of dores,
nor cannot sleepe for disquieting himselfe

with mistrust and despight.
               Couetousnes is so terrible an enemy to conuersation,
that no honest man will approach
him, no man will talke, no man
will accompany, no man giueth any thing,
no man enters his doores, neither will any
man fetch fire at his house. For who will
hope to receiue good from him, which neuer
afforded to doe himselfe any?
               Couetousnesse keepeth the heart in fear, the
minde in care, the body in trauaile, and
the soule in sinne.
               Couetousnes makes the woe of nature, the
want of rest, the wonder of reason, and
the way of hell.
               Couetousnes debarreth the possessors from
all loue and friendship: for who will be a
friend to him, that is an enemy to himself?
who will remedy his necersity, that neuer
succoured others? who wil send him a present,
that neuer gaue an almes? who will
succour him, that suffered others to starue?
who will giue him wood, that warmes
himselfe with straw? who will lend him
money, that hideth his owne in a corner?
nay, who will wish him well, to vvhom
God hath threatned to do vengeance.
               
                  
Couetousnes is worse, then honest pouerty:
for the poore man is contented with a little,
when the rich miser with his aboundance
seemeth to be in necessity.
            
            
               Crueltie.
               Diuine is mercy, diuelish, cruell bents;
               Then men (like God) must pardon penitents.
               CRuelty is not so raging in beasts, as in
men: for they pray, but for meere necessity;
when men rage of wantonnes. Yea
in a great hunger, the Lion will not sease
on a Lambe, nor the Eagle catch at flies,
nor diuers others insult ouer inferiors. &amp;c.
               Cruelty maketh rich mens almes miserable,
when the beggers wealth is liberty.
               Cruelty and couetousnes sometime goe together,
and at all times procure infamie,
as by the story of Andronicus in Aulus
Gellius may appeare, where to this houre
it is vpon record, that the Consull Dacus
vvas so cruell and couetous, that he
gaue his slaue neither coat, shooes, nor
shirt, and yet made him earne his owne

liuing daily: which by any chance neglected
he was not onely debarred his necessary
foode, but whipt, and beaten with
rods.
               Cruelty and pride are sometimes companions:
which make rash &amp; bloudy officers:
who because they would haue a name of
seuere iustice, they will commit a thousand
cruelties in their Countries.
               Cruelty and fire haue both one condition:
for they consume all things, and at last
themselues.
               Cruelty offereth wrong and reuengeth iniury;
maketh him vnhappy that receiueth
it; him infamous that offereth it; him guiltie
that preuents it not; and him accessary
that winketh at the violence and inhumanitie.
               Cruelty correcteth beyond authority, and
shameth honour: for to punish for euery
trifle, breedeth rather hate, then commendation
of iustice.
               Cruelty is the effect of rage and madnesse,
wherein if a man, especially in a great estate,
doe not restraine passion, hee may
well be feared and hated, but neuer loued
or esteemed.
               
                  
Crueltie is increased by the povver of
wrath, and enforceth despight; whereas
clemencie is the grace of nature, and continueth
respect.
               Cruelty &amp; ingratitude are sometimes companions,
when we rebuke him, whom we
ought to reward, &amp; punish those of whom
we haue receiued good turnes: the right
nature of a dogge, and wit of a diuell.
               Cruelty maketh men fitter for a butcherie,
then a common-wealth: when we wil not
harken to a resonable demaund, nor relieue
a poore distressed petitioner.
               Cruelty hath deafe eares, while pitties eyes
are subiect to teares.
               Cruelty cares not, whether reuenge be base,
nor regards the bloud of the innocent:
but the one is a blot to honour, and the
other a worme in conscience.
               Crueltie can make no mans arme mightier
then Pharaohs; yet was Pharao
                        •
                     s interior
to the waters.
               Cruelty kills the poore with famine, when
we see him starue for hunger, and 
                     〈◊〉
                  
relieue him.
               Cruelty that reuengeth euery transgress
                     •
                  on
leaueth no part, nor place for indgement.
               
                  
Cruelty is the fuller of indignation, when
wee haue an enemy at aduantage, vvhom
wee haue abused before, and know he wil
reuenge it, if he suruiue.
               Cruelty and beauty are sometimes vnited,
when a proud contemptuous woman insulteth
ouer a poore louer, &amp; knoweth no
reason to deny, but because she hath heard,
she must not yeeld at the first.
               Cruelty and Enuy many times are companions,
especially in old women, who past
the world themselues, speake ill of al sportiue
exercises for vanities, because they
cannot bee agents in the businesse themselues.
               Crueltie keepeth men from all assurance or
hope. For when a man shall vse crueltie
for charitie, which in this world in obedience
and loue to God hee oweth his brother,
how can he expect any fauour in the
world to come of his heauenly father?
               Cruelty is euer accompanied with forgetfulnes
of Christian dutie; when furious &amp;
firie Iudges execute the lawes extremity,
whereas true iustice is full of humanity, &amp;
a noble minde replenished with pitie.
               Cruelty possessing the heart of the proud,

makes pouerty be put to the height of her
patience.
               Cruelty in men of power without mercy, in
punishing the poore distressed creature,
pulls down more mercilesse plagues from
the mighty Creator, vpon the head of the
oppressor.
               Cruelty makes a Tyrants frownes to bee
feared, when the threats of a coward are
smally regarded.
               Cruelty makes the crying of children pittifull,
the teares of the aged lamentable, the
complaint of the orphan miserable, the
wringing of the widowes hands wofull,
and the confusion of a Common-wealth
execrable.
               Cruelty is seene both in fire and water,
which haue their force and course to ouerthrowe
strong holds: yet when they encounter,
they destroy one another.
               Cruelty breedes curses, when a man remoueth
the marke of his neighbours land;
how then can he think to be blessed, when
hee would wring him out of his inheritance?
               Cruell hearts are more harder then stones:
for they are pierced with drops of water,

when the other are not moued vvith the
the teares of our cryes.
            
            
               Curtesie.
               I rob men of their hearts, if I be true;
               And giue them, for it, what to them is due.
               CVrtesie &amp; Charitie doe commonly hold
hands together: for though an enemie
haue been malicious, yet by a curteous
man hee shall be remitted vpon the least
submission.
               Curtesie doth sometimes deceiue with faire
words, and then is it flattery: but if it
speake the truth, it is honestie.
               Curtesie is seene and known by ciuill specches;
as modestie by ciuill lookes.
               Curtesie that is common, is but a laughing
ceremony; yet it reproueth rude behauior,
and maketh ciuillity commendable.
               Curtesie teacheth great Commaunders to
deale with the meaner sort, as with sonnes:
with the equall as with brothers: with
the ancient as with fathers: and with the
strangers as with fellowes.
               
                  
Curte
                     •
                  y maketh a wise Lord to be more beloued
then serued: for by that meanes hee
shall get the commaund of the hearts and
goods both of neighbours and strangers.
               Curtesie will not tread on a worme in distresse:
yet he that kneeles to a thistle, deserues
the blessing of a nettle.
               Curtesy sheweth, that a Gent: is of good
bringing vp: for strangers do loue him, &amp;
his own do serue him, wherupon curtesy &amp;
friendly behauiour is more honor to him
that vseth it, then to whom it is done.
               Curtesie, according to Plato, is vnited to
magnanimitie, and then it consisteth in
three speciall things; salutations of people,
relieuing the oppressed, and kinde vsage
of friends.
               Curtesy sometimes leadeth a man to pietie:
for king Alfonso beeing one day by one
of his Counsel found fault with for his too
much pitie toward great offenders, answered,
that hee would be ready to make account
of his sheep, that hee had charge of,
when God called him to account, and deliuer
as many safe and sound, as hee could.
               Curtesie and kindnesse is naturally incident
to diuerse beastes: for the Elephant

will lead the wanderer into his way; the
Lizard wil wake a sleeping man in a danger;
the dogge will follow and attend
him, though he be beaten; and the horse
is most gentle to his rider, and master.
               Curtesie debarreth vs from presuming either
in iest or in earnest to speak to a gentleman
any malicious or suspitious words;
whereof he might remaine shamed or despighted:
and commaundeth to performe
the request of any Lady, or Damsel, which
lies in his power to doe.
               Curtesie winnes the harts of inferiors; and
noble kindnesse teacheth vertue the measure
of grace.
            
            
               Courtier.
               Bright, oft too light, with words 
                     〈◊〉
                   smooth as oyle,
               (Lamp-like) he spends himselfe; and time doth spoyle.
               The Courtier that is all for shew and complement,
is the onely professor of humanitie,
master of curtesie, vaine promiser, idle
protester, seruant of folly, and scholler of
deceit: for in one word; he neither performeth,

what hee commonly sweares, nor
remembers in absence, what hee hath formerly
protested: so that his oaths and
words are like smoake and aire: and his
deeds and actions meerly shadowes, and
farre from substance.
               The fantastick courtier is an antick inuentor
of fashions, and so subiect to newfanglenes,
that ere a sute of apparell is worne
on his backe, hee is deuising another to
please with varietie.
               A courtier is not a name incident to euery
one that followes the remooues: for so
you shall haue many sluttish groomes, and
slouenly vnder-seruants: but is appropriat
to such, as either are voluntary for
the Kings honour, or their owne preferment:
or in place of eminence, fit to attend
on men and women of Honor.
               A courtier is sometime taunted with the
tearme of effeminate, and carpet Knight,
because they know not how to tread, but
on rushes of a chamber; nor where to bestowe
themselues, but on a beds side, or
wanton places of rest.
               A courtier must needs be hansome in apparrell;
neither ouer-garish, nor ouerplaine:

but orderly comely, and extraordinarily
fashionable, according to some
priuat occasions, or publique solemnities.
               A Courtier must be seruiceable to Ladies &amp;
women of Honour, dutifull to high officers,
gracefull amongst Councellers, pleasant
amongst equalls, affable to inferiors,
and curteous to all.
               A courtier depending on a faction in pallace,
is like a man that laggeth on a cart
going vp an hill; which if hee hold fast,
will in time draw him vp with the same:
but if it roule downe the hill, hee must either
let goe his hold, or sinke to the bottome
with it.
               A courtier hoping for preferment by order
of seruice, must not onely giue attendance
accordingly, but endure with a great deale
of patience; yea somtime with despight, to
see an inferior person preferd before him.
               A courtier is sometimes terrified with
wants, and losses of time: for wee commonly
say, A young courtier, and old begger:
therefore it is wisedome to preuent
the worst, and policie to prouide before
wants knock at the dore indeed.
               The meaner courtiers life may many times

be resembled to Humble-bees, which flie
abroad the pleasant fields all day, and
then retire to a cowshard at night: so
they frequent the pallace, and sometimes
are in presence of the King; but how they
lie and rest in their lodging, it is pittiful to
relate, and barnes &amp; stables are good resting
places.
               Courtiers are bad pay-masters; and vvhen
the money is once in their purses, it is
hardly got out againe. For how euer they
sweare and protest, they dispence with the
time, &amp; make their creditors attend their
leisure.
               A Courtiers life is as bad as the Merchants:
for he trauels and leaues his wife at home,
longing for the end of a progresse; and
this takes a long iorney, and cannot return
when he would: in both, discontinuance
doth many times diminish loue; and
while their husbands are troubled with
the affaires of the world, their wiues are
delighted with the pleasures of their bed.
               A courtier scorneth to be counted vnciuill;
yet esteemeth it a grace to bee braue and
high minded: so that whē pride is in fashion,
men may be vicious, &amp; whē familiarity

breeds contempt, it is an error to be humble:
thus are Courtiers the corrupters of
vertue, and mock-apes of time.
               Courtiers are companions of souldiers: &amp;
and how-euer they are curious and dainty
in the pallace, they are noble and brauely
disposed in the field.
               Courtiers are companions with Schollers:
for without learning &amp; obseruation, they
cannot practice humanitie and good manners:
and vnlesse they study and read histories,
they will faile in discourse &amp; conuersation,
the principall end of a courtiers
life.
               A Courtier &amp; Citizen are many times eye-sores
to one another: &amp; so foppish vve are
by custome, that we thinke derision a kind
of vertue. Thus when a Gentleman reprehends
his seruant, hee threatens him with
playing the merchant with him: &amp; when
the trades man vpbraides his, he saies, he
hath serud him like a gentleman. So fares
it with the women; She is but a Lawyers
Lady saith the Citizen: she is but a London
Lady saith the Lawyer. Again, These
Merchants are cutthroats, cryes the Courtier:
These Courtiers are cosoners complaines

the Merchant.
               Courtiers of the vainer sort, are puzzeld in
amorous encounters, and a crosse answer
of their Mistres crosseth the armes, hangs
downe the head, and puts a willow branch
in the hat-band. Againe, a dissembling
looke raiseth a feather of her colours, cuts
the footcloth as her 
                     •
                  ut-worke, and sets
an Embleme on his Pages liuery.
            
            
               Clergie.
               You cannot knowe me by my sable weede,
               If lust and riot in my bosome breede.
               CLergy men are at this instant the subiect
of all discourses: because some of
them doe resemble Physitians; who prescribe
their Patients thin diet, and barlie
water, when they eate themselues high
nourishing meates, and drink good wine:
so they admonish vs, how to liue, what to
forbeare, wherein to continue, and teach
a way to serue God; but are licentious in
their own example, and run all the course

of violent and vicious behauiour.
               Clergy men are sometimes so corrupted,
that I haue known such as will not preach
in haruest, because they are busied &amp; ouertroubled;
&amp; may not preach out of haruest,
because they goe visitations; nor
cannot preach at others times, because
they doe not study; nor dare not preach at
all times for weakening their bodies, and
disquieting the auditory.
               Clergie men, if they be ambitiously bent,
beeing once beneficed are neuer contented:
but suppose them-selues seated on
a staire of degrees, which leadeth to a
roome, into which they must goe: and
thus they ascend higher &amp; higher, as they
still sue for better place and better.
               Clergy men of the common sort, suppose
they liue sufficiently religious, if they obserue
morning &amp; euening prayer on Sondaies,
read an Homelie, come to Church,
receiue the Easter offrings, and keepe the
orders prescribed in their canons: but neither
examin their own liues to amendment
of their manners, nor endeuour the reformation
of their neighbours by their good
words, or good examples.
               
                  
Clergy men, that liue religiously according
to their profession, are worthy of their liuing
and maintenance. For if the Physitian
that cures the body, must haue a fee, surely
he, that saueth the soule, deserues a reward.
               Clergy men are some way resembled to
burning tapers, who consume themselues
to light &amp; pleasure others: so should they
weary themselues, and tire out both body
and minde to bring the ignorant to vnderstanding.
               Clergy men haue beene and are many times
so ignorant, that both Prophets and Apostles
haue cried out with our Sauiour: If
the blind lead the blind, they must both
fall into the ditch: and if they vvhich
should direct vs out of the path of damnation,
are vnskilful Pilots, how is it possible
to follow them in vncertaine courses.
               Clergy men discredite their profession, and
and make euen rascalls vilipend it, when
they see them faile both in life and doctrine.
Nay, vvhen they giue ill example
of prophaning the Sabboth, keeping bad
company, following wanton sports, talking
at randome, want of charitie, and vnlimitable
licentiousnes.
               
                  
As a Clergy man, if an idle or vnprofitable
Preacher, or prophane liuer, is the most
hatefull &amp; pernicious person of all others,
both to himselfe, and his auditours: so if
he be a learned, faithful, sincere, and painfull
Preacher, and godly liuer, you shall
hardly finde any man whatsoeuer, whom
God hath dignified with so many tearmes
of true honour. Calling Ministers the Angels,
or Messengers of God; the Embassadours
of Christ; the Disposers of his hid
mysteries; the seruants of GOD, and of
Iesus Christ; the Paranymphs of Christ;
the witnesses of the truth of God; the
voice, or mouth of God; the trumpets of
God, to denounce warre to the wicked,
and to stir vp the godly, by sounding the
alarum to the battel against sin and satan.
The proclaimers or publishers of the Gospell,
or glad tydings of saluation by
Christ, to all that beleeue in him. The coadi
                     •
                  tors,
fellow labourers, or fellow-helpers
of God. Gods husbandmen, that
plow vp, and harrow mens harts with the
law, and cast in the immortall seed of his
heauenly word; the builders of the church
fallen downe in Adam; &amp; the repayrers of

of the ruines of sin, and satan. Stewards of
Gods house, who after his precise rule, and
prescription, deuide aright to euery one,
his portion of meat, and worke, in due season:
keepe the keyes of heauen, open the
doore to all faithfull seruants, and shut out
the obstinate, and vnbeleeuers. The light
of the world, set on the hill of euery Parish,
to dispell the darknes of ignorance
and sin, and shine before men both in life
and doctrine. The salt of the earth, to season
mens vnsauoury soules, and keep them
from corruption; making their persons &amp;
actions liuely and sauoury sacrifices, acceptable
to God, and well pleasing. Fishers,
or catchers of mens soules, out of
the dead sea of their sinnes, and satans dominions.
Fathers or begetters againe of
sinfull men, heires of wrath and perdition,
to be the sonnes of God, &amp; heires of heauen.
Bishops or ouerseers, watchmen, or
obseruers of mens soules, to discouer and
giue warning of the stratagems &amp; assaults
of sin, and satan Guides or leaders, shepheards
or feeders of mens soules, with heauenly
bread, &amp; liuing waters. Sauiours of
men, and remitters of their sinnes, vnder

God, as his instruments. Princes in all Nations.
Royall or kingly Priests, and shall
shine in glory like the brightest stars. Of
such high and precious account are these
vvith God, tendred as the apples of his
eyes, and graced with super eminent titles
aboue all others.
               Yet are they in the estimation of vvicked
worldlings, and proud Popelings, reputed
as the off-scouring of all things.
Themselues as poore almesmen, or baser
abiects; their wiues as lemans, their issue
as bastards.
               Their lyuings are thought superfluous,
their labours tedious, their zeale ridiculous,
their exhortations friuolous, their
reprehensions malicious, their comforts
hartlesse, their cōminations enuious, their
religion puritanicall, their profession pharisaicall,
their conuersation hypocriticall,
and their persons, prouisions, professions,
meere needlesse burthens, the best of them
all.
               The godly Preacher is the Generall of the
field, with whō all the parish must fight against
their spiritual enemies: he is the man
that must furnish &amp; arme them with christian

and complete armour, where-wth
(through his help) they shal encounter, &amp;
conquer the huge armies of pernicious ignorances,
pestilent errors, and poysonous
heresies. Hee the singular Surgeon to apply
the soueraign salue that must heale the
wounds thy receiue from the fiery darts of
their fleshly lusts. Hee the high Marshall,
that hath receiued the sword of the spirit,
to suppresse the mutinies, and bring into
obedience their rebellious wills. The high
Controler of Gods house, that hath power
to reproue the outrages of their vnruly affections,
and riotous actions, &amp; to punish
their disorder by spiritual censure. The soueraigne
Physitian, that hath the precious
preseruatiues against all tentations; present
remedies for perilous passions; the
word of truth, to resolue all doubts; Christ
his infinite merits to free them frō all fears;
his precious promises to cure their cares;
his heauenly-reposed pleasures to support
all sorowes; and he procures the generall
panacea of patience, to ease all paines.
               In a word, he hath the only heauenly receits
to heale all the diseases of their sinne-sicke
soules; their boiling lust, their raging

anger, their open hate, their close enuie,
their couetous desire, their deadly despaire.
Hee strengthens their fainting
hopes, confirmes their trembling feares,
reuiues their dying harts, beats back their
deuouring enemies. Hee comforts them,
when their conscience condemnes them;
hee confirmes them, when sin, death, and
damnation dismaies them: hee stands by
them, when Physitians, and friends, and
all the world forsakes them.
               To conclude, GOD by his ministerie or
meanes, regenerates their natures, illightens
their mindes, conformes their wills,
orders their affections, reformes their vices,
confirmes their graces, sanctifies their
liues, assists their deaths, and is the Mydwife,
that brings their soules out of endlesse
torments, into immortall ioyes.
               The best of all men, are good Christians, the
best of good Christians are good Ministers;
but are the worst paid for their
paines of all others. They vvatch many
nights, burne many candles, reade many
bookes, write many quiers, spend many
spirits, preach many Sermons, conuert
many sinners, saue many soules; and for

all this, are defrauded of their tythes;
which their parishioners take not to be
necessary duties, but voluntary almes. The
Minister must comfort all them, and all
they may cosin him; he must feede them,
but they may starue him. They make him
like a captiue or bond-slaue cooke, who
must dresse them dainties, but (without
their leaue) may not licke his owne fingers.

               A learned, zealous, honest, and industrious
Minister, hath (by common consent, and
manifold reason) this priuiledge giuen him
aboue other men, to be truly termed a Diuine,
for his diuine calling by inward inspiration,
for his diuine ordination, by
Christ his owne institution, for his diuine
function, which meddles with no matters
but onely diuine, hee studies the diuine
bookes of the holy Scriptures, conceiues
diuine meditations of heauenly things,
works with diuine instruments, the word,
the spirit, and holy sacraments, hath diuine
obiects, immortall soules, offers vp
diuine and publike prayers for spirituall
blessings, produceth the diuine effects of
all theologicall vertues, proposeth, and
obtaineth the diuine ends of the glory of
God, and saluation of soules. Now the Minister
in these, &amp; many moe diuine qualifications,
&amp; gratious respects, being so diuine,
is for that very cause, so mightily
maligned by worldly men, hauing so little

warre. For men quoth the King? be you
carefull to fill the treasure, and let it be my
imputation, if reward, and the name of a
Prince draw not millions to affront any
danger: whereupon they replied, that the
wealth of the Cleargy might supply their
wants, and the very, late and challices of
religious houses, would coine so many
crownes of the sunne, as would discharge
the army, and recompence the souldiers.
Not so quoth the King, a theeues almes
cannot prosper, nor good actions thriue
with wicked purposes: besides, I had rather
haue one godly man to pray for mee,
then a hundred ruffians to fight for mee;
and thus you know, when the Princes of Israell
were discomfited in their warres, they
repaired to the Prophets for intercession
to God, who is not compelled with the
power of swords, or strength of men: but
enforced with the teares of the penitent, &amp;
deuotion of the religious.

               A Citizen is a professor of ciuilitie; and
liuing in a glorious quiet, maketh
the Common-wealth to flourish: and
how-euer he is condemned for too much
ease, yet cannot the souldier repulse the
enemy, or maintaine the warre, except the
Merchant adde fuell to the fire.
               A Citizen had a time of honour euen in the
title: for to be a citizen of Rome, was once
as glorious, as to be a gentleman of Venice.
               
               A Citizen, how-euer he may be noted for
couetousnesse, and corruption in trading:
yet vnder colour of priuat enriching himselfe,
he laboureth for the publique good▪

                  or abroad is nauigation maintained, and
the forraine kingdoms explored: and at
home the Cities are enlarged, the country
supplied, the commerce of people maintained,
the streets filled, the houses adorned,

the subiects encreased, &amp; the Prince
honoured in the multitude of obedient
seruitors.
               A Citizen is master of dellicacie and neatnesse:
for what in other men wee sometimes
call pride, in him is but natiue hansomnes,
and profession of cleanlinesse.
               Citizens in times past did not marry beyond
their degrees, nor would a Gentleman
make affinitie with a Burgesse: but
wealth hath taught vs now another lesson;
and the Gentleman is glad to make his
younger sonne a tradsman, and match his
best daughter with a rich Citizen for estate
and liuing.
               Citizens, how euer they are enuious one against
another for priuat respects; yet as
the triumuiri of Ierusalem against the Romans,
will they vnite their forces for the
publique good: yea, if a stranger fall out
but with a seruant in the street, let him be
sure to haue a swarme of fists or clubs about
his eares.
               A Citizen, if he will, may boast of his title:
for I can tell him wherein hee is more noble
then a Prince. For to be a citizen of
heauen, is to bee preferred before a King

on earth.
               A citizen is more troubled with his vvife,
then his wares: for they are sorted, locked
vp, and neuer brought out, but by constraint
for the profit of their master; but
his wife is decked, adorned, neatly apparrelled,
sits for the gaze, goes at her pleasure,
and will not be restrained from any
sights or delights, or merry-meetings;
where they may shew their beauties, or
riches, or recreate themselues.
               A Citizen is in great danger of displeasure,
if he deny his wife any thing which
her meere fancie conceiteth: as shee is in
perill of despight, if hee would restraine
her libertie vpon suspicious iealousie:
in both, loue beginneth to breake
as ice, which once crakt, runneth further
and further.
               Citizens are neuer so out of countenance,
as in the imitation of Gentlemen: for eyther
they must alter habite, manner of
life, conuersation, and euen the phrase of
speech: which will be but a wrested compulsion;
or intermingle their manners and
attire in part garish, &amp; in other part comelie,
vvhich can be but a foppish mockery.

Whereupon, I remember a story of Sir

his Tayler to make him a gowne of
tawny cloth against Christmas; vvhich
Iohn Drakes the Shoomaker liked so well,
that hee would needs haue another of the
same cloth and fashion. The next day, the
Knight comming along, and seeing more
cloth then his owne, asked what the matter
meant; and beeing told the truth, hee
willed the Tayler to cut his, all to iagges,
and small cuts, of which fashion the Shoomakers
was also made: but when he came
to put it on, and saw such a spoile, all enraged
he chafed with the tayler; who answered
truly, that he did no more then he
was bidden; for hee made it like Sir Iohns
in all proportions: whereat the shoomaker
sware, hee would neuer be in Gentlemans
fashion againe.
            
            
               Country life.
               The Citie cannot stand without my store,
               Nor Court, nor kingdome, yet I liue as poore.
               COuntry life is toilesome: yet experience
maketh the labour more easie, and the

paines more pleasant: especially if profit
come in apace, and a rich haruest fills the
barne.
               Country life is wholsome; for the bodie is
strengthened with exercise, and diseases
repulsed with simple, moderate, and orderly
diet. For whereas other men liuing
in idlenesse, prepare their diet according
to their stomacks, these haue good stomacks
for any meat and wholsome viands.
               The Country man is chu

                  ctiseth

and ceremonies, hee either absenteth
himselfe, or comming abroad vseth his
owne customs.
               The Country man is the nurse-childe of
warre: for whereas a souldier must endure
misery and wants, it may be done the better,
if the body be accustomed to labour
and sparing.
               Country life is vnapt for cunning: for when
a husbandman would practice deceit, hee

                   when the Butler came rushing

&amp; 
                     •
                  he other knew not where to goe,
and so continued in a great perplexitie, till
set at liberty, he would aduenture no further
to hazard his safetie, to liue sweetlie
by subtiltie.
               Country life is blessed in imitation of nature:
for they vse the night for rest, and
the day for labour: whereas idle liuers
incurre the woe in the Prophet, by making
day night, and night day; sitting vp
by candle light in pleasure, and sleeping
in the sunne-shine in idlenesse.
               Country life is seasoned with experience:
for he saith not to his seruants, Goe yee,
but, Let vs goe; if hee cannot doe so, hee
were better keep the plough at home, and
his cattell out of danger. For the eye of
the master maketh the field rich, and the
horse fat.
               Countrey life hath a touch of pride: for
how-euer the huswise bee attyred at
home, shee will goe as neat and cleanlie
as shee can to the market, &amp; as finelie
to the Church: though a carnation girdle,

a silke apron, a hat lined vvith veluet,
and a fringd paire of gloues, are
ornament
                     •
                   for a fiue hundred pounds portion:
and in this generally the excesse of
women deserues restraint and limitation,
that they spend not aboue their husbands
reuenew, nor exceede their place and proportion.
               Countrey life is euery way commendable
vvhen it comes in her ovvne colours:
but to aduenture on the Cities nicetie,
the Courtiers brauerie, the Gentlemans
libertie, the Souldiers prodigalitie, the
I awiers cunning, and the Merchants subtiltie,
resembleth a hansome woman, that
to follow the fashion, spoileth her face
by painting.
               A Countrey man in times past did not
knovve, what Vsury meant, but by hearesay:
for many a good house-keeper liued

A Country man is thus farre a good fellow;
he will meet you at the Alehouse to
make merry, at the market to bargaine, at
the faire for prouision, at the Church to
pray, at the field to doe his worke, and at
the next Pari

but will sildome come to your house, or
inuite you to his, lest a greater charge
come vpon him, and the spending of time
hinder his necessary businesse.
               Country life is peaceable; and he that will
serue God quietly, may there bee exempted
from the worlds vanitie, though
not from the diuels subtilty.
            
            
               Cuckold.
               Tis not the name (so full of game) I feare,
               But hate the falshood, and a forraine heire.
               A Cuckold is a kinde of creature (as
mad fellowes say) which God neuer
made, man cannot endure, women cannot
iustifie, the diuell cannot challenge, the
world cannot banish, nor time cannot
alter.
               
                  
A cuckold is a deuise of the diuell against
the peace of mankind: for as at the first he
caused the woman to deceiue the man to
his vtter condemnation; now hee instructeth
her to abuse man, to his infamous derision.
               A cuckold is an vnpreuentable destiny, the
breach of loialtie, and an vnsufferable
wrong; not for the losse of credit in himselfe,
but for feare of bastardie in his children.

is, when a man hauing maried an honest
maiden, findeth her afterward transported
with the loue of another, and onely one
other, who diuideth the stakes, and conuerseth
in friendship.
               A cuckold is abused with this secret of nature,

clothes to bee beaten: for in bringing
wanton company to a wanton woman, it
is as putting fire and toe together. Nay,
such is the basenes of some men, that they
marry wiues of purpose to make them
whores; and care not for any reputation,
so they may liue at ease, and riot by their
dissolution.
               A cuckold thinks himselfe safe if he can auoide
the name of wittall. For hee thinks,
men may conceiue, much water goes by
the mill, which the Miller knowes not of,
and an honest man may bee ignorant of
his wiues wickednesse; but to giue way
to filthinesse, and yeeld to a wiues prostitution,
is a beastialitie contrary to nature
and reason.
               A cuckold is mocked with hornes, because
of double iniury: another man lyes with
his wife, and his child hath two fathers.
               A cuckold that knowes it not, is questionlesse
of a good beliefe, and so beares with
that, he cannot remedy: but hee, which
knowes it, is of an admirable patience, &amp;
endures more then man can suffer.

before old mens faces, behind young mens
backs; young men may die soone, old
men may not liue long.
               Death commonly presents the rich vvith
feares, the poore with comforts, concerning
their future estates. For she tels many
poore men, who are buried in Churchyards,
that their soules shall rest &amp; reioyce
in heauen; and many rich men, who are
buried in stately sepulchers, that they shal
be tormented in hell.
               Death well ended is birth to eternity: and
a true faith purchaseth felicitie.
               Death is not to be feared, when it deliuers
from misery,

               Death of a good 
                     〈◊〉
                  , is the mis
                     •
                  ry of a
good seruant; 
                     〈◊〉
                   of a good father, the
ioy and reioycing of a reprobate childe:

but hee is not worthy to liue, that is sick
of the father.
               Death both vntimely and shamefull, is
commonly the end of theeues and lechers.
For thé one furnisheth the hatefull gallowes;
and the other is commonly finished
by lothsome surgery.
               Death vndesired of age, sheweth little feeling
of grace: as youth doth little signe
of good nature or breeding, that doth
not loue and reuerence his elders and
betters.
               Death endeth the sorrowes of the righteous,
and beginneth the miseries of the
wicked.
               Deaths musick is sounded, when wee beginne
the song with sighs, end it vvith
sobs, and keepe time with teares.
               Death belongeth to him that killeth his
enemie; but hell to him that killeth himselfe.
               Death is one and the same to all, how-euer
diuerse Nations differd in their seuerall
burialls and sepulchers.
               Death amōgst the Salamines &amp; Agarens had
an extreame enmity: for they were buried
with their backs turned one against another;

so that, if in life they were enemies,
after death they scarce remained friends.
               Death amongst diuerse Nations had as diuerse
entertainements. For the Hircanes
washed their dead friends bodies vvith
wine, and afterward annointed them with
oyle, which they kept to eate and drinke.
The Massagetes drew forth the bloud, and
did drinke it, burying the bodies. The
Caspians burnt the bodies to ashes, which
they did afterwards drinke in wine; so
that the entrailes of the liuing, was the sepulcher
of the dead. The Schithes buried
no man, without one aliue were ioyned
with him; which if any friend denied, a
slaue was bought to maintaine the custome.
And so in many other Nations,
according to the seuerall conditions of
life, they had as many deuises of buriall.
Yet death is but the priuation of life in all.
               Death of good children woundeth the Parents
harts: but the life of a wicked wife,
is the woe and misery of marriage; so that
in such a case, it were better to be honestly
dead, and worshipfully buried, then
liue to be continually tormented.
               Death eternall, and life abreuiated, is the reward

of the wicked and damned.
               Death makes an end of all liuing creatures,
whereas derth destroieth but some kingdomes,
warres depopulateth but some
countries, &amp; fire cōsumes but some cities.
Death is so much the more grieuous to the
rich, by how much they made more account
of long life. For when a man shall
bid his soule to liue at rest, what a terror is
it to haue it taken from him that night?
But life is irksome to the miserable, because
they cannot liue, as they should, nor
die when they would.
               Death of sutes proceeds from denialls; and
they commonly come by corruption of
bribes: and delayes are the mi
                     •
                  eries of
hope; vnkindnes the scourge of loue, and
combersomnes the breach of friendship.
               Death and murther are wrought by vnskilfull
Physitians, and ignorant, idle, or illliuing
Ministers: the one receiues money
to kill the body; the other, benefices to destroy
soules; either for want of good Sermons,
or by corrupt examples of their
loose and lewd liues.
               Death is often wrought by meere conceit
of a faint heart, as the fight of a drawn

sword is formidable to a coward.
               Death is sweet to a quiet conscience, when
life is irkesome to a distempred minde.
               Death that is honorable, is farre to be preferred
before an ignominious life; and
life that is vntainted, cannot but end with
a glorious death: in both, necessity must
preuent disquiet, and hope of heereafter
good, extinguisheth the griefe of present
bad.
               Death is no way hurtfull in it selfe; but the
manner, and the cause makes it most irkesome
and odious.
            
            
               Diseases.
               The minde and body subiect are to sin,
               And so to sicknesse: but the worst's within.
               DIseases amongst the Greeks, were preuented
without physick, when they
did gather sweet herbes in May, were let
bloud once a yeere, did bathe once euery
moneth, and also did eate but once a day.
Diseases torment the flesh, as sinne woundeth
the soule: patience applyed to the

one, and repentance to the other, (if applyed
in time) will preuent destruction.
               Diseases vnfelt of the patient, are like sinnes
vnthought of by the reprobate.
               Diseases at Ephesus were cured vvithout
money, or other instruction, then their
own experience, and reading: for the tables
of medicines were hanged in the temple
of Diana for euery man to read; and
such as had iudgement, to practice.
               Diseases are a bridle to the flesh, and pull
down the pride of lust: yet sinnes that infect
the soule, are farre more dangerous.
Diseases are not easily and lightly cured,
when the patient is either inordinate or
vnrulie, the Physitian ignorant, or vnfortunate,
and the medicine ill compounded,
or vntimely.
               Diseases that continue are grieuous to nature:
as wants vnsupplied are wofull to
reason.
               Diseases are not cured in one body so soone
as in another: nor are the same medicines
to be applyed to all constitutions alike at
all times, and vpon the same occasions.
               Diseases most times are bred by gluttonie,
except such as growe from infirmity; and

when the appetite is choaked, the stomack
is made sick; whereas hunger beeing orderly
fed, and nature moderatly supplied,
preuenteth that distemprature, which
shall tend to sicknes.
               Diseases of cruelty, are the gowt, collick,
toothach, stone, and strangury; but of
senselesnesse, loue, and the lethargie.
               Diseases haue had new names with new
times; and although in truth they haue
been one &amp; the same: yet are men so subiect
to varietie, that they must still say, It
is the new disease; haue new physick, and
entertaine new Doctors.
               Diseases are bred by infectious aire, as a
venomous tongue may procure death.
               Diseases of the minde are bred by opinion,
which beguiles vs with a false taste of true
happinesse: for false opinion leads vs into
vaine delight; which is indeed the superfluitie
of desire, and enemy of nature.
               Diseases are not cured without medicine,
nor fooles made wise without instruction;
which neglected, the one may die in
his griefe, &amp; the other run mad in his folly.
               Diseases are most dangerous, that are not
preuented betimes: for if the bodie be

corrupt, they pull on still diuerse infirmities;
so that it many times chanceth, that
when a Physitian hath healed that disease,
which he was sent for, yet the rest remaining,
bred by the former, procure the ruine
of the body.
               Diseases and wounds are of one nature, &amp;
both resemble the conditions of sin: for
if diseases continue long, &amp; putrifie, they
cannot be healed without corasiues, and
sharp burnings: no more can a long sinner
and corrupted heart come to heauen,
without true contrition or repentance, &amp;
troublesome afflictions.
               Diseases weaken the body, but sin ruines
the soule.
               Diseases of the body may be sometimes cured,
if the causes be apparant: but the torment
of a guilty and desperate conscience
is incurable, though wee knowe that sin
hath infected it.
               Diseases are sildome cured with vvords
without mature medicines; vvhich while
the Physitian museth on, but misseth the
true cause, or royall cures, the patient hits
the way to heauen before he can agree vpon
his ingredients.
            
            
               
               Drunkennesse.
               Who hath to friend a Drunkard, hath a foe
               That with his friend, can neither stand nor go.
               DRunkennesse makes men worse then
beasts; for they doe neuer exceed the
measure prescribed by nature, but man
will not be measured by the rule of his
owne reason.
               Drunkennesse and pride are hardly hidden,
whē other wicked actions are many times
couered, and most times excused.
               Drunkennesse dimmeth the braine, dulleth
the heart, spills the stomack, and spoyles
the whole body. I could say, inflameth the
stomack, burneth the liuer, infecteth the
breath, dazeleth the eyes, loosneth the
teeth, encreaseth the palsy, weakneth the
ioynts, swelleth the flesh, and ouerthroweth
the perfect temper and sound constitution
of man.
               Drunkennesse loues to open the follies of
men, the shames of women, the gates of
cities, the secrets of Common-wealths,

the weaknesse of Princes, the discoueries
of treasons, the burnings of incontinencie,
and the errors of all ages and sexes.
               Drunkennesse is many times cause of madnesse,
but most times occasions of infirmities:
for when the interior senses and
parts are brought into distemper, the exterior
are weake in working, or worke in
disorder.
               Drunkennesse is contrary to all other vices:
for eyther they leaue vs, or we leaue them
through wants or age; onely drunkennes
is made worse with continuance, and the
older we growe, the more beastly we are.
               Drunkennesse bringeth forth shame &amp; impudencie:
and it fareth with men in this
vice, as with improuident sinners; vvho
are so farre from repenting themselues,
that they are sory they haue done no
more. Which makes me remember a certaine
Father; who hauing a Sonne giuen
ouer to this beastlinesse, brought him into
the streets to see a drunkard wallowing
in the durt, and wondred at by many
standers by; supposing that the lothsomnesse
of the sight would haue wrought vpon
him, &amp; the odiousnesse of the example

diuerted him from offending. But he was
so farre from both, that hee asked his father
where that good wine was, vvhich
made the man so drunke, that hee might
goe and take his part.
               Drunkennesse misconstrueth kindnes, mistaketh
friendship, mistearmeth good felowship,
misuseth Gods creatures, despiseth
good counsell, scorneth assistance, &amp;
forsweareth his owne senses.
               Drunkards sinne against God, who forbids
the abuse of his good creatures; against
the poore, that want them for their nenessary
vses; against their owne bodies,
which they fill with manifold diseases;
against their own soules, which they defile
with their swinish sinnes; against their
whole persons, which they turne out of
men into beasts; and against their eternal
saluation (if they repent not) and forsake
not that beastly &amp; abhominable custome.
               Drunkennesse makes a wet surfet, a full stomack,
a sodden liuer, &amp; a drownd soule.
               Drunkennesse puts a Carpenter by his rule,
a Fencer from his ward, a Poet out of his
vaine, and a Player out of his part.
               Drunkennesse makes the vict
                     •
                  er rich, the

rich man poore, the poore man a begger,
the begger a roge, a theefe, and a murtherer,
and so the end is a halter.
               Drunkennes, as it is beastly, so it is remedilesse,
and maketh the father ashamed of
his child, and the child carelesse of his father.
Which brings to my mind a story of
a wise man, who sending a son to trauell,
and enformed of his wanton courses resident
in a lasciuious citie; yet excused the
same, and hoped of reformation of all, till
it came to drunkennesse. For when he was
told of he was fallen into this filthie vice
and abominable beazeling, O (saith hee)
youth may be wanton, and heerafter stayednes
may reduce him; puft vp with pride,
that may be moderated by conuersation,
or religious aduise; giuen to gaming, either
wants, or the discouery of falshood
may make him leaue it; delighted with lechery,
either age wil tame &amp; coole him, or
an honest wife diuert him; he may be carried
away with ambition, it shewd a noble
spirit, and some-thing must be gotten by
men of worth: but when hee is drawen to
drunkennes, he is to be lamented as vtterly
lost, without all hope, but worse &amp; worie.
            
            
               
               Effeminatenesse.
               A man that is a woman, ne're considers
               He is a Peacock▪ all fowle but the feathers.
               EFfeminatnesse hateth exercise, is an enemy
both to strength and wit, when labour
perfecteth the vnderstanding, and
raiseth manhood to a full height.
               Effeminatnesse maketh happinesse but an
imagination; and then hope is a vveake
hold: but when vertue and valour builde
the house, the frame standeth on a good
foundation, and the workmanship must
needs be honourable.
               Effeminatenesse is ridiculous in a Courtier,
when a young man weares furred bootes,
dares scarce tread on the ground, smelleth
of perfumes, holds a fanne in his hand to
keepe the winde from his face, rideth too
softly in the streets, &amp; must alwaies tread
on a matted floer.
               Effeminatenes is contemptible in a Knight,
when hee rideth on a slowe-paced Mule,
like an old Iudge; painteth his face, boasteth

of wrought night-caps and buskins,
keepeth his bed because it is cold, dares
not stirre out of doores because it is durtie,
and will ca
                     •
                  e no meat but tender and
minced.
               Effeminatenesse is lamentable in a souldier,
when hee must needs haue a downe-bed
to lie vpon, a warme wastcoat, an oiled
gauntlet, a sweet shirt, a perfumed armor,
lined greeues, and a quilted burgonet.
               Effeminatenesse is vnseemely for a Mariner,
when he cannot endure a storme, girdeth
his gowne to worke in, is afraid to foule
his hands, and findeth fault with the smel
of the pitch.
               Effeminatenesse is an enemy to good huswiferie,
when either the man dares not
plow, because it mizells, nor the wife rise,
for that it is a cold morning.
               Effeminatenesse is a fault of all mothers;
when their children may not goe to bed
without warming the same, nor rise till
the curtaines be all close, nor stirre out of
dores, till their girdle be aired by the fire,
nor goe to schoole, till they haue their
breakfasts.
               Effeminatenesse is the aduersary of health;

when a young man will not walke without
a candle, nor stirre, but in faire vveather,
nor ride without a foot-cloth, nor
daunce without a Mistris, nor do, or weare
any thing but tending to curiosity.
            
            
               Eloquence.
               Did I not make the wrong right now &amp; then,
               I were an ornament to law-full men.
               ELoquence is the beauty of learning, if it
proceed from wisedome; and in the eare
of vertue truth is the best Orator.
               Eloquence that ouerthroweth the speaker,
is as bad as an ill perfume, that poisons
the braine.
               Eloquence with beauty, maketh nature
gracious, and wit honourable.
               Eloquence of heathen men, hath corrupted
the heart of christians; but venomous is
that breath, that poisoneth men in their
soules.
               Eloquence of liuely words cannot be expressed
in dead lines &amp; letters: for he that
giues, what he sales in writing, binds himselfe

to lose his credit.
               Eloquence was so forcible in Demosthenes,
that he had many times mony offered him
to hold his peace, when other men lookt
for great rewards to debate the matter.
               Eloquence was so much laboured amongst
the Philosophers, and Orators of Athens,
that Damonidas florishing in the time of
Pisistratus the tyrant, on a day he said vnto
the Senate of Athens, All men may freelie
come &amp; speak with me in their affaires, except
the Philosopher Damonidas; who
may write vnto me, but not come &amp; talke
with me: for he holdeth such efficacy in his
words, that he perswadeth to what he wil.
               Eloquence is rather the gift of God, then
the perfection of learning: for many worthy
men haue attaind to great knowledge,
who for want of elocution, haue lost their
honors, and memorable renowne.
               Eloquence applyed to purpose containeth
great efficacy, which king Philip, Alexanders
father knew very wel: for besieging a
certaine citie, he came to this parlee, that if
they would suffer Theomastes to enter, and
make an Oration, he then would depart,
and raise his siege. Sure Theomastes had

great eloquence in his words, and forcible
perswasion in his speech: for they not
onely rendred themselues, and opened
their gates, but acknowledged king Phillip
for their Prince, as hee did the Orator
for preuailing. Thus had eloquence more
force in words, then the King in his Armies.
               Eloquence hath secret enemies, Folly and
Ignorance: the one cannot vnderstand
the secret; &amp; the other cannot learne the
qualitie.
               Eloquence and Wisedome are not alwaies
companions: for many times a ridiculous
matter passeth in the eloquent deliuery; &amp;
weake thrusts pearcing the heart, dispatcheth
the combat.
               Eloquence and discretion must needes be
obserued in writing letters of importance;
and to a man delighted with varietie,
and volubility of speech.
               Eloquence maketh a man desire glory, and
then he writeth with aduisement, &amp; speaketh
with iudgement: and as you see the
plough-man reuiew his furrow to straighten
what is amisse: so must a wise man examine
his writings, to make them seeme

more meet and orderlie.
               Eloquence in writing a letter is discouered,
when it is pleasant to read, and discreet
to be noted.
               Eloquence and honesty are sometimes enemies:
for a wicked matter enforceth attention
by perswading speeches, and procureth
dispatch by a timely compulsion.
               Eloquence is no way auaileable with God:
for the simplest prayer of a good man
shall be truly heard, when the vaine Oratory
of the brauest Philosopher shall not
preuaile.
            
            
               Enuy.
               I (like the diuell) nought but Good pursue;
               Whereby I waste to naught, yet Good eschew.
               ENuy frets the heart, and marres digestion
in the stomack; nay farther, the fire
of malice feedes on hellish furie.
               Enuy of neighbours watch thy actions, and
make thee stand on a guard of circumspection.
               Enuy cannot speake well of vertue, nor

endure to heare another commended:
especially in an enemy, or in him, vvith
whom wee contend for superioritie, or
glory. And if therein our aduersary preuaile,
we cannot sleepe in quiet, nor eate
with content.
               Enuy and hate doe commonly goe together:
so that Timon vvho enuied good
men, because they were so good, beeing
asked, why he hated all men; answered,
I hate wicked men, because of their wickednesse;
and I hate all other men, because
they hate not the wicked.
               Enuy is somewhat contrary to othervices:
for they commonly extend to the hurt of
others, when the enuious man hurteth
himselfe; and then most chiefly, when he
cannot preuaile to doe mischiefe, and faileth
in practicing reuenge.
               Enuy wrought the destruction of Pharoh
and his host, by his owne contempt against
God: the troubles of Ioseph by his
brethren: the death of Iohn Baptist by
Herodias daughter: and the crucifying of
Christ by the Scribes and Pharises, who
knew, that hee was the Sauiour, and yet
repined at his humilitie.
               
                  
Enuy made Caine murther his brother Abel;
the Sodomites repine against Lot;
Saul murmure at Dauid; Ioab kill Abner;
Shemei raile, vvhen Absalom rebelled against
his Father; and the Diuell himselfe
tempt the vvoman to bring all mankinde
to destruction and ruine.
               Enuy makes men vvorse then diuels: for
they beeing a legion, yet agreed together
in one man: but two bretheren can
scarce agree together in one house.
               Enuy breedes a frowne in the forehead, a
leere in the eye, vvrinkles in the face, leannesse
in the body, malice in the heart,
and a mischiefe in the soule.
               Enuy bred by the pride of Lucifer, caused
his fight &amp; contention with the Arch-angell;
but especiallie made the Diuell
vvatch the Woman in the wildernesse, to
deuoure her child, when she should be deliuered.
               Enuy vvill doe him-selfe hurt to procure
his aduersarie a greater mischiefe.
Which makes mee remember a storie of
an Enuious and Couetous man vvalking
together, vvho at last met with Iupiter,
and had the fortune to haue their

petitions granted with this prouiso, That
whatsoeuer the first man wished, the other
was sure to haue it doubled vpon
him. Wherupon, the couetous man would
not wish, because hee would haue had all
the good to himselfe; and the enuious
man durst not, for dooing another double
good. But at last, in casting of lots, it
fell to the Enuious mans turn to ask first;
and so hee desired to haue one of his eyes
pulled out, that the Couetous man might
lose both: which was immediatly effected;
and Iupiter wondred at the malice of
the wicked man.
               Enuy breakes the knot of amitie, sowes
the seed of sedition, and brings forth the
fruit of ruine and destruction.
               Enuy loues no number but one, no iudgement
but partiall, no power but absolute,
nor wisedome but will.
               Enuy euen remaines in the graue: for the
Salamines buried their dead, their backs
turned against the Agarens, which vvere
their mortall enemies; in such wise that
their enmitie endured not onely in time of
life, but also when they were dead.
               Enuy is of that property, that it sometimes

produceth a miracle. For after E
                        •
                     eocles
and Polinices had killed one another in
battaile, and that their bones and bodies
were to be burnt and sacrificed together,
the very flames diuided themselues asunder,
and shewed the enuy and disvnion of
the malicious brethren.
               Enuy is an incurable disease, a torment of
the minde, a vexer of the spirit, corrupter
of the bloud, canker of the flesh, rust in
the bones, &amp; consumer of the very soule.
               Enuy and malice haue no mercy in case of
victory, when weakenesse is forborne,
when it is vnder the power of true fortitude
and valour, and ignorance is instructed,
not derided by Christian wisedome.
               Enuy maketh quarrells vpon cold bloud, to
the hazard both of body and soule: and
how-euer they be dangerous vpon sudden
heats, they be this way vnpardonable vpon
premeditated malice.
               Enuy is euer a supplanter of the vertuous;
who if they once rise to the fauor of Princes,
let them be sure of enuiors; yea, and
peraduenture of such, as flatter them to
their faces.
               Enuy produceth horrible effects: for when

                  Porrex had killed his brother Ferrex,
whom the mother loued extraordinarie;
shee so stomacked the matter, that finding
her sonne the suruiuing King asleepe,
shee stabd him to the hart.
               Enuy is not to be trusted, nor reconciled:
for questionlesse, at an opportunity her
malice will returne, and doe a mischiefe,
if shee can.
            
            
               Folly.
               I am turn'd Goddesse, and haue sacrifice
               Of men and women, now turn'd Butterflies.
               FOlly, which in Scripture is the same with
sinne, maketh the pride of the flesh swel
to lust, and then asswageth it with wounding
the soule: but wantonnesse is ouercome,
when the wise grow temperate and
continent, by vertuous disposition and
conuersation.
               Folly maketh men weepe, because they
were not borne a thousand yeeres agoe,
nor can liue a thousand yeeres after: yet it
is worse folly to thinke, there is no being

after death; no hell nor heauen; which can
not be conceiued but by Atheisme. It is
the Athisticall foole that saith in his hart,
There is no God.
               Folly makes fooles proud of gay coates;
and so the apparrell be gawdie, it neuer
cares, though it be painted cloth, or guilt
leather.
               Folly is shown, when a man may be wise
and will not; thinketh himselfe wise, and
is not; supposeth other fooles, that be
wise indeed. He would be wise, but cannot
take any paines with his addle wit.
               Folly makes vs not feare sinne; keepes vs in
loue of vanitie; loseth time about trifles;
and bringeth her followers to scorne and
confusion.
               Folly makes a man prattle with lesse delight
and more hurt, then a Parret and other
birds, that speake but as they bee vrged,
and taught: but fooles runne at randome,
without enforcement or reason; and such
a glib tongue is (for the most part) as void
of truth as it is of discretion.
               Folly both wanteth vnderstanding in it self,
and scorneth counsell from others.
               Folly thinketh it selfe wise and is not, and

so is as short of wisedome, as he which
supposeth hee is at his iourneys end, and is
but halfe way.
               Folly loseth her wits in a wood by prying
into other folks thoughts; but yet to hate
the simple, is wicked subtiltie.
               Folly beateth the aire with words, but wise
men penetrate the senses with matter.
               Folly makes him lose his wits in his way,
that trauels further, then hee can returne:
but he that sits still, and does nothing, is
vnprofitably borne: yet better to bee a
foole, then a knaue, and to sit still, then rise
to doe mischiefe, or walke to practice reuenge.
               Folly makes one care for that, which is
needlesse, and neglect that, which is necessary.
               Folly will not be taught any reformation;
and hee that goes about it, loseth his labour:
as hee that would wash an Aethicp
white, loseth both his sope &amp; his water.
               Folly maketh men vncapable of schollership:
and to nimble spirits are as dangerous
to deale with: for wit and folly are
commonly maried together, vnlesse discretion
askes the banes, and giue them

orderly in the Church.
               Folly presumes of ouermuch goodnesse, and
seeth not his owne, nor cares to doe another
hurt.
               Fooles are not to be troubled aboue their
capacitie: no more then a dwarfe should
striue to reach heauen with his hand.
               Fooles are more troubled with opinion
then matter: subiect to feare, rather then
faith: yet sometimes for lack of discretion,
vnapprehensible of danger; and so as
desperate, runne into irrecouerable perill.
               Folly maketh men esteemed pratlers for fiue
causes: much speaking; false speaking; idle
speaking; desire of speaking, when hee
should hold his peace; and not speaking
at all, when he ought to declare his mind.
               Folly sheweth a shallow braine, in babbling
quicquid in buccam, without discretion;
in boasting of knowledge without
moderation; in reuealing secrets to euery
vnwise or vnworthy acquaintance without
distinction; in flattering him as a
choice friend, and onely man, whom hee
would trust with such a thing, which hee
could not keepe himselfe, when it was in
his keeping.
               
                  
Folly proceedes from simplicitie of iudgement,
wantonnesse of disposition; or idlenesse
of liuing: in all which, a well-meaning
man many times may be taken.
               Folly is not heere meant of naturall Idiots,
in whose difference from other men, God
setteth out his glory by such varietie: but
of such, as either counterfet for worldly
respects, or are obstinate of diuelish despight,
or are ignorant indeed for want of
instruction, or good will to learne.
               Fooles are some-times Fortunes minions,
but wisedome is truly, if not onely precious;
and is of the more reputation, by
how much lesse it is more common.
               Folly lies couched at Fortunes feet, as she
rides at triumph in her Chariot; and when
she riseth to visit the world, Folly catcheth
hold of her skirts, and will goe with
her, or cry like a baby for being left behind
her.
               Folly setteth all men on worke against the
great voiage, wherein the ship of fooles
is Admirall of the iourney.
               Folly speakes much, and knowes little:
reads much, vnderstands little: spends
much, &amp; hath little: so that in little time

hee must needs be little worth.
               Folly makes a wise man in hope of a nigh
way, to leaue the high way: and to finde
a by-way, let him thanke himselfe, if it
prooue a wry-way.
               Fooles &amp; villaines are commonly exempted
from sorrow: for the one cannot, and
the other will not take thought.
               Fooles are not to be affected, least they disgrace
thee; nor wise men to bee abused,
least they reprehend &amp; controle thee.
               Folly cannot hide herselfe from discouery:
for though she apparrell herselfe neuer so
demurely, looke soberly, goe grauely, and
still fit quietly; yet will shee be speaking
to no purpose, and euen in the manner of
deliuery, discouer her folly.
               Folly may come by want of education, by
ill accident, or by natiuitie: but vvhen
it is counterfet, it proceedes from meere
knauery.
            
            
               
               Fortune.
               Oft am I idle; yet my wheele still ply
               To bring the high, to lowe: the lowe to hie.
               FOrtunes wheeles are full of cogges, driuen
with vncertaine windes, vaine desires,
venturous braines, violent hands, &amp;
haue vnworthy, wonderous, and ridiculous
euents.
               Fortune, when she is feared, flowteth the
weaknes of your faith: but once braued,
flincheth at your fortitude.
               Fortune hath many Emblemes; as standing
on a wheele, which turning about, mounteth
the begger to the top, and whirl
                     ••
                  h a
Prince to the bottome: and so she shewes
her inconstancie.
               Fortune is painted blinde, as if she saw not,
where shee distributed her fauours, nor
cared not to whom: and so shee shewes
her impartiallitie.
               Fortune is deciphered with a hairy 
                     ••
                  retop,
and a bald head behind: to signifie, that
we must not let slippe any good occasion,

but take all times to doe our selues good;
and so she shewes her opportunitie.
               Fortune is figured naked, and cares not to
be cast into the Sea: fore she can saue her
selfe without swimming; &amp; so she shewes
her power.
               Fortune resembles a woman, who commonly
plays with men, as the bodie with
the shadow: runne thou away, and it followes
thee; follow thou it, and it flies
from thee: and so she shewes her peeuishnesse.
               Fortune standeth on the globe of the world,
as if she commanded all like an Empresse:
and so she shewes her imperiousnes.
               Fortune is the fiction of idlenes, and fancie
of a frothy wit.
               Fortune bringeth high floods to lowe ebs,
and lowe ebbes to high floods: teaching
men not to misse their passage, but take
time while time is, and the tide as it falls.
               Fortune is a tearme profanely abused: for
what the heathen called a deitie, as Adrastus
built a temple to Nemesis, &amp; in Rome
she was honored as a Goddesse: we Christians
call Gods prouidence; or at least
should thinke and belieue so.
               
                  
Fortune is inexorable; for she will not heare
the best prayers, nor be mooued with the
greatest teares; it is not sighes can controle
her, nor sobs make her flexible; and
so she shewes her crueltie.
               Fortune flies the encounter of sury: for
where shee fights the fielde, manie mischiefes
followe by ineuitable fate and destinie.
               Fortune maketh order out of confusion: for
as Christopherus Laucius said; Fortune is
an influence, which proceedeth from the
reuolution of the heauens; and shee, as
they, doe continually turne about: for riches
beget pride; pride, impatience; impatience,
reuenge; reuenge, warre; vvar,
pouerty; pouerty, humility; humility, patience;
patience, peace; &amp; peace, riches.
               Fortune is then most execrable and odious,
when she so carrieth the cause, that one is
punished for anothers offence.
               Fortunes wheeles mount aloft like raging
waters, which quickly throw downe slender
banks: right so shee shewes her suddennesse,
and violence.
               Fortune laughes to see one fret at her,
knowing he hurts himselfe, and not her:

like an Adder in her hole, who lieth safe
when she hath stung thee: it is in vaine to
charme her, or coniure her, or curse her,
when thou canst not reach her, nor reuenge
thee vpon her.
            
            
               Friends.
               A house declining, vnderpropt must bee,
               And thou tru friends, whē Fortune ruines thee.
               FRiends thinke themselues discharged of
their duties, if they remedie one another
in necessitie, &amp; comfort them in aduersity.
               Friends are not to be lost for trifles, nor
should a wise man cause himselfe to be beholding
to an enemy for any needful thing.
               Friends once tried are to be made much of;
and thou must both beare and forbeare,
where thou expectest a kindnesse.
               Friends that faile, breed deepe dislike; and
there is no such griefe, as to be deceiued,
where we trust.
               Friends vntried or vnknown, make men vnwise
to build vpon them; but he that hath
true friends &amp; loues them not is vnwise, &amp;

he that betraies them, is a villaine.
               Friends that are faithfull, are not to be suspected:
yet a reconciled enemy, though
he seeme a friend, is not to be trusted.
               Friends in their absence are vncomfortable;
in their wants greeuous; in their importunities
combersome; in their vnmannerlinesse
irksome; and in their death lamentable.
               Friends are parted by vnkind breaches, as
kingdoms are diuided by the tumultuous
seas: but wretched are the occasions, that
seperate vnited friends.
               Friends that are kinde, are sweet companions:
but a malicious man is a neighbour
for the diuell and his damme.
               Friends that haue sound hearts, haue sildome
frownes; but false ioyes breede
true griefes.
               Friendship is delicatly expounded amongst
the Philosophers: for Aristotle beeing asked,
what he thought of friendship; answered,
that it was one soule in two bodies.
               Friends that are kinde, are pleasing companions:
but if they be constant, they bee
rich iewels.
               
                  
Friends may be trusted, when they haue
beene tried; strangers when they are
known; dogges when they be muzled;
women when they be in sight; and enemies
when they are vnder ground.
               Friends are so priuiledged, that sometimes
we may labour for their good, when we
cannot speake for our own. As for example;
there was a law amongst the Romans
much vsed, and obserued; that vpon paine
of death, none should presume to approch
the tent where the Emperour did eate and
sleepe: which yet in the time of A
                        •
                     relius
a certaine Greeke did infringe, and so hee
was taken and condemned to die: but the
Emperor vnderstanding the matter by the
hurlibu
                     •
                  ly, spake with a loud voice: If
this man did come to sue for any thing for
himselfe, let him die; but if for his friend,
hee shall liue.
               Friends that are sildome seene, and much
lesse spoken and conuersant withall, are
lesse familiar, but more sure; in that they
loue not for rewards, but for vertue and
goodnesse.
               Friends before they make a perfect combination,
must obserue these circumstances

If our friend be poore, we must giue him;
if he be rich, we must serue him; if hee be
fauoured, we must worship him; if hee be
wilfull, we must obey him; if he be impatient,
wee must beare with him; if hee be
vicious, we must dissemble with him; and
if he be malicious, we must beware of him.
               Friends in their wants may be perilous vnto
vs, &amp; in their importunities tedious.
               Friends that are old and acquainted, once
changed for new, make men resemble little
children, who refuse an old angel for
a new counter; and cry to goe from their
true parents, to strange nurses.
               Friends are thus farre vnprofitable, that
they are the thieues of time; and come to
seeke vs, not to do, what we think good,
but to perswade vs to what they thinke
conuenient.
               Friends, though they be kinde, are sometime
troublesome to suffer; as enemies
are perilous to endure.
               Friends remedy in aduersities, comfort in
necessities, beare with imperfections, pardon
transgressions, &amp; endure in troubles.
               Friends canot be rightly so named, that affoord
their persons for priuate respects,

and deny their goods vpon plausible pretenses.
               Friends are (in some Philosophy) denied to
be in the plurall number: for as long as a
man hath but one heart, hee can haue but
one friend: who beeing vnited in loue, are
as it were one minde and soule in two bodies.
               Friends that are vnkinde, are vncomfortable:
but an vnquiet wife is intollerable.
               Friends come in at all houres, yea into all
places: for sure to whom I haue afforded
my hart, I will neuer deny him my house.
               Friends are priuiledged aboue kindred: for
a man may haue many kinsfolks, but few
friends: yea kindred doe daily encrease,
but a friend once lost, is hardly recouered
againe; and once dead, neuer recalled.
               Friends, so farre as they impouerish not our
estates by lauish expences, may command
our purses; but a great discretion must gouern
our passions. For hee cannot well be
said a friend, but an enemy, who makes vs
lose our time by friuolous or foolish importunities,
or to vnnecessary or vntimely
imployments.
            
            
               
               Gentery.
               Highnesse of blo
                     •
                  d is base, vnlesse it bee
               Made bright by vertue in a high degree.
               GEnerositie is a speciall prerogatiue amongst
all people. For to be descended
of noble parents, is commonly a signe
of noble conditions: and as you see a faire
Diamond made more rich by Art and embelishing;
so is vertue more gracious in a
Gentleman, then in an Artificer.
               Generositie teacheth her possessors so to
recreate themselues, that thereof rise none
offence; neither to themselues by immoderate
exercise, nor to others, by inconuenient
abuses.
               Generositie ought to vse none but honest
recreations, performed with moderate &amp;
harmelesse cariages, in due and seasonable
times, directed to honourable and profitable
ends.
               Generositie is a great helpe to perswade the
people a man is thereby more worthie to
be a Prince: but that kind of ambition is

subiect to great malice, and supplantation:
so that many haue lost their liues, for
feare lest their noblenesse in blood, and
good conditions should preferre them to
high and honourable places.
               Generositie teacheth men to be temperate
in feeding, sober in drinking, liberall in
giuing, considerat in receiuing, short in
sleeping, reposed in speech, affable in businesse,
patient in hearing, prompt in expedition,
gentle in chastisement, and benigne
in pardoning.
               Generositie teacheth men neuer to be idle,
or ill-doing; not to be a follower of wine
or women, or euery effeminate fashion;
not to brawle with any man; not to hurt
enemies, nor to be vngratefull to friends.
               Generositie is of so delicate a condition,
that in any matter of controuersie, conference
may be admitted; but contention
vtterly condemned: for noblenesse and
despight did neuer accompany in one gentle
person.
               Generositie maketh knights and souldiers
of so valiant a courage, noble minds, and
worthy demeanors, that they are neuer inflamed
with choler, but in the field against

enemies; nor angry with their friends, but
for desperat vices.
               Generosity teacheth knights and gentlemen,
in the time of war not to write from
their owne houses, but the campe: euerie
man in his owne ranke; the priest praieth,
the husbandman ploweth, and the knight
fighteth.
               Generositie doth not account him a gentleman,
which is onely descended of noble
bloud, in power great, in iewels rich, in
furniture fine, in attendants braue: for all
these are found in Merchants and Iewes.
But to be a perfect Gentleman, is to bee
measured in his words, liberall in giuing,
sober in diet, honest in liuing, tender in
pardoning, and valiant in fighting.
               Generosity hath preheminence of Honour:
for H. 8. answered a man, that desired to be
made a gentleman, that hee could make
him a noble man, but not a gentleman.
               A Gentleman vvithout meanes, is a painted
bardge without oares; faire to looke on,
but there is no vse of him, neither in calm,
nor storme. While hee is tied to his post,
and stayes at home, hee either rots as hee
stands for want of rowing, or trimming;

or else takes in such soule water of euerie
vice, that floweth vnto him, as either in
short time corrupts within him, or speedily
sinks him.
               But if you vntie his rope or chaine, and lose
him from home, hee is not able to strike
one stroake towards the staires of a faire
fortune, though it be neuer so nigh him:
especially, if the least winde or tide of any
opposition be against him; but is carried
downe the streame of head-long passion,
without sterne or reason, or hand of friend
to stay or direct him. So that if some luckie
and vnlookt-for Neptune ioyne not
with Venus, to hale him in, and land him
in the lap of some lustie Lady, or rich
widow, he is driuen into some dirty ditch,
where hee rots, if not vnseene, and vnknown,
yet vnpittied and vnrespected for
all his rich painting.
               A Gentleman without meanes, is like 2
faire house vvithout furniture, or any inhabitant,
saue onely an idle house-keeper:
vvhose rearing was chargeable to the owner,
and painfull to the builder, and all
ill-bestovved, to make a mock-begger,
that hath no good morrovve for his

next neighbour. Who may knock, and
haue no answer; or if he enter, he may goe
into the kitchen, and be neuer the warmer;
into the celler and be neuer the wetter;
vp into the chamber, and lie downe
on the floer, &amp; come out againe as much
the neere for his need, as he came in. It was
cost cast away vpon a faire fruitlesse
frame, that brings in no rent, but is stil in
reparation, or running to ruine.
               A Gentleman without meanes is a prettie
plant, but without rinde, without roote,
without leaues, without fruit. He is a tender
creature that can weare his clothes in
good fashion, if his Mercer &amp; Tayler will
trust him. Hee can borrow with as plausible
and pittifull perswasion, and put off
payment with as pretty inuention, and
soader euery allegation, with as fast and
firme oathes as any man. His minde reacheth
to the Court, and cloth of State,
but his horse tyres ere he comes at Court
gate. Hee salutes, and sweares as courtlie
as any man, and weares bad clothes in the
best fashion.
               Hee is a louing and frequent friend to his
wealthy neighbor or country-man, whersoeuer

he meets him: and not ouermuch
reserued towards any free-hearted, and
openhanded Gentleman. Hee is of a fellowly
condition, and comes to a feast (and
that with the soonest, if it be of free cost)
vpon the first inuitation: and to any merry
meeting (if the shot be not high, or the
guests ouer-fine) he failes not to come. He
feeds as choicely &amp; freely, drinks as sweetly
and soundly, and talkes as boldly and
brauely as any in the roome: and yet vninuited,
vpon necessary occasion to dine at
home, he can eate as moderatly, and fit as
soberly, as any other man.
               He shall weare a cloake, &amp; a paire of boots
as long, borrow your horse as often, and
ride him as well as the best in the towne:
and shal as respectiuely diet him, &amp; shooe
him, as if he were his owne. Hee can hold
vp the lower salt, with festiuall and timely
table talke, in competent, and commendable
sort: and (barre distinction, and orderly
speaking) he wil ouer-argue a scholer
in his owne profession. Hee can hold
your cardes, or play your game; fill, and
light, &amp; taste your Tobacco with as good
iudgement as the Merchant that bought

it, and sold it: and if it be not of the right,
he can tell you, where you shal buy it.
               He can hold a trencher hansomly for neede,
vpon an extraordinarie occasion: and carry
a token, or message, and deliuer it, that
no man shall mend it. You shall neede no
better Intelligencer to bring home all the
newes from the Burse &amp; Poules, and other
publique places, to be repeated at dinner.
None shall sooner spy out a fit match for
your sonne, or daughter: doe your person
and state more credit, or sooner clap it vp,
vpon loane of your nagge, and reasonable
profit.
               Take him to a play, and trouble not his cogitation
with the water-man, entrance, or
sitting: hee shall laugh as hartily, obserue
as iudiciously, and repeat as exactly for
nothing, as another man shall for his halfe
crowne.
               Yea, you shall finde him able (or forward)
in short time, to correct the Actors, and
censure the Poet. Nay, if any want of his
own, or enuy at the excellencie of another
man, or indignation at his better fortune,
do much importune him; you shal see him
chuse some pleasant theame suteable to

the time, and write a tolerable tract, or
passable Poeme. He can flout a stranger,
scorne a scholer, and scoffe a Minister, no
man better. He is the onely medius 
                        •
                     erminus,
or man to conclude a merry meeting,
or to set downe the conditions, place, and
time.
               You shall finde him in the Cock-pit, in the
vpper ring: he offers a Iacobin, but at next
dangerous blowe, layes halfe a crowne; if
it be sixe to one. He can mew or man your
hawke; enter &amp; traine your hound; shew
you where to hunt, when the hounds goe
counter; how to breake the fault; follow
the game; and lie, if not run, as fast as the
huntsman; who if hee call him not vp before
day, yet of his owne accord hee will
rise before dinner.
               Hee layes not many wagers, but stands as
tightly on his reputation, and hath his pedegree
as perfect as any man; and can readily
recount, what a royall house-keeper
his great grandfather was in euery particular.
He sowes his crop, and carries in
his corne, with the best expedition. But
as he neuer lends his neighbour his teeme:
so is he, neither at season, sheep-sheere or

haruest, beholding to any man. His rent
to his Lord, at the due day is neuer vnpaid;
his houses are neuer in reparations; no
idlenesse or disorders are euer seene in his
seruants. He discommends the vanitie and
varietie of costly clothes, as the foxe did
the grapes. Hee railes on Vsurers, the
dearth, bribery, and corruption of the
times. He abhors Bayliffes, Sergeants and
Sheriffes. Hee hates collections for any
vses. He hunts on Sondaies, and wrangles
for tythes; yet he sildome or neuer goeth
to law with his neighbours. His fences are
so good, that no mans cattle can come into
his ground: and his own are so ringed,
and yoakt, and lawde, that they neuer trespasse
on any other man.
               He is alwaies in pursute of some good widdow,
but scornes to make his way by base
briberie: onely the maid shall be made, by
faire promises, and kinde kisses. His own
mothers maid shall giue her word, that he
is good for propagation and breed: none
so good to plant a colony and people a
country.
               The dislike of his owne, inclines him to
seeke better fortunes in other countries:

and bar stormy winter, dry byscuit bread,
and cold water, no man shall trauaile a
league further. He well approues necessarie
warres, for those that haue bodies fit
for cold and hard beds, short commons,
and sharp swords: but onely desperation
of meanes driues himselfe to the vvarres;
yet not vnlesse hee want hart to be hangd
at home, for taking of purses. VVhich
should not seeme so, by the often quarrels
hee entertaines with his inferiors, vpon
equall hazard of life and lands: saue
that onely respect of reputation, and honour,
with-holds him, from fighting vpon
vnequall tearmes, with base companions.
And as for his betters, hee is very temperate
and discreet in forbearing them; and
bearing their iniuries, who may be his benefactors.
Hee lesse feares to offend God
then his rich idols, to whose deitie he offers
the incense of all his indeauours: being
euer superstitiously anxious to delight
their eyes, tickle their eares, obserue their
desires, sooth their humors, second their
opinions, applaud their speeches, picke
their thanks, by finding, and aggrauating
the faults of their seruants.
               
                  
This weake &amp; worthlesse luie, must either
not liue, or lie down, or else leane to some
substantiall rich oake or other, as his sycophant,
parasite, or iester; or else as his
beadesman, or bayliffe, to goe afield with
victuals to his woaders, or weeders, to ouerlooke
their labours. The top of his
hope is to attaine to the chamber of some
Court-fauourite, grand Councellor, graue
Iudge, or great Officer. Where beeing
soone slypt into his satin sute, silke stock,
treble ruffe, and beauer hat; he is not long
in learning his occupation, and the due respects
hee is to haue, whose cause hee furthers,
and whom hee admits: knowing
that the profit of his watchful prouidence
heerein, will in short time, enable him
with means, to impropriate a prety punk,
and purchase good lands.
               But if this, &amp; all other meanes faile, why yet
with a little labour, he would proue a pretie
excheator, a prowling promooter, or a
good land-spaniel, or setter for a hungry
Courtier, to smell him out a thousand
pound sute, for a hundred pound profit.
But to say the truth, the onely ordinarie
vocation he is most naturally apt vnto, &amp;

hath dexteritie in; that he likes, and likes
him, that he liues by, and liues in, is the
Art of cheating.
               For conclusion, this beggerly Gentleman,
is too proud to be a seruingman, to poore
to be a Merchant-man, too weake to be a
husband-man, too wastfull to be a tradseman,
too lazie to be an artificer, too idle
to be a scholer, too tender to be a souldier:
and yet hath matter in him, to make
him fit for all this, with good moulding
in tract of time. For full and finall description
of this indigent gentleman; he
is a rationall creature, potentially apt for
any thing, but actually good for nothing.
               A Gentleman without manners, is like a
custard of addle egges, in a siluer coffin,
which promiseth sweetnesse, by his sugered
crust; 
                     〈◊〉
                   p
                     •
                  ooues vnsauourie, and
loathsome to the stomack and taste: faire
to looke on, but fulsome to feede on. Or
if you will;
               An vnmannerly Gentleman, is like an vnparboyld
pastie of tainted venison, which
graceth the table, and pleaseth the guests,
as it comes out of the oven; but beeing
cut vp, forth-with fills their noses, and

offends their stomacks: so that that, which
ear
                     ••
                   delighted their eyes, doth now loath
their appeties. It was ill imployed cost,
of pepper and salt in the seasoning, and
butter and creame in the crust. Right so,
the out-side of an vnmannerly gentleman,
seemes an obiect of worth, where hee is
vnknowne: but if you taste him, or try
him, by more neere commerce, or inward
conuersation, you shall finde him, for ignorant
prating, for impudent lying, for
scornfull scoffing, for rude rayling, for
quaffing and quarrelling, for swaggering
and swearing, for bawdery and blaspheming,
of so riotous and rotten; so contagious
and stinking a condition, that of all
others, you may least endure him: as the
sweetest and best meats once corrupted,
yeeld of all other, the most vnfauourie
stinks.
               The first sight of an vnciuill Gentleman, is
the best; the further you see him, the better
you like him; the neerer he comes, the
worse you brooke him. Twas all lost was
layd out on the education of so costly a
caryon. To this purpose I remember a
story in the time of H. 7. who was ledde

after the sedation both of forren and domestick
encombrances, by the hands of
prosperity to the house of a great Maiestie
and Honourable wealth: insomuch that
the Court encreased to statelines
                     •
                  e, the
Citie prospered, the Country thriued, and
all sorts of people thought it the greatest
glory to liue in the florishingest showe:
wherevpon it is recorded, that a husbandmans
sonne hauing been imploied in some
seruices, vvhere example had raised his
spirits to immitation, demaunded of the
King, as a recompence to be made a Gentleman.
The King, neither angry nor pleased,
quickly dispatched him with this answere,
he could not: For though Princes
can raise men to Honor, noblenesse, offices,
and authoritie: yet lay it not in their
power to enlarge vertue, good conditions,
and the renowne of ancestors, whereby
and wherein a true Gentleman is best
known, and shines most brightly. Besides,
my friend (quoth he) with what colours
of prosperitie canst thou florish thy
estate? And it like your Maiestie, the Farmer
replyed, my inheritance is raised on
the degrees of fortie pounds a yeer. Alas,

said the King, the times are now corrupted;
and that may keepe thee as an honest
man, but will neuer maintaine thee for a
Gentleman.
               Generosity disclaimeth vilenes, sluggishnesse,
niggardlinesse, maliciousnes, lying,
and cowardlinesse; so that in a Gentleman,
though there may be found somewhat
to be reprehended, yet there ought
not to be contained any thing, worthy of
reproach and infamy.
               Generositie is more aduanced by noble and
vertuous auncestors, then by wealth or
inheritance: for to descend of noble
bloud, doth not onely honour vs, but prouokes
vs to be vertuous.
               Generositie doth lead vs to honour, and
teach vs to amend our estates; whereas infamie
doth tempt vs to be desperate.
               Generositie doth cause vs to attend and be
seruiceable to all Ladies and Gentlevvomen;
but especially to forbeare them in
matters of contention, and with curteous
demeanor to perswade them to the right.
               Generositie was so esteemed amongst the
Romans, that the law Prosapia ordained,
that when contention did arise for the

Consulship, then those which descended
of the Siluians, Torquatians, Fabricians
should be preferred.
               Generositie is an ordinance of GOD: for
Christ himselfe came of the noble Tribe
of Iuda.
               
            
            
               GOD.
               Vse reuerent words of God that ruleth all,
               For at his pleasure, thou shalt stand or fall.
               GOd is incomprehensible in wisdome,
absolute in power, vnsearchable in essence,
glorious in his graces, infinite in
mercy, inuisible in person, infallible in
word, vnspeakable in bounty, matchlesse
in maiestie, and endlesse in his abiding.
               God maketh men wise through his feare,
affordeth honour by his seruice, yeeldeth
life to his belieuers, sendeth happinesse to
his louers, yeeldeth comfort to his obseruers,
and crowneth his martyrs with euerlasting
happinesse and eternitie.
               God hath his seat in heauen, his footstoole
on earth, his church both in heauē &amp; earth,

his kingdom among his Saints: and blessed
are those soules, which make their bosoms
his temple.
               God is more dishonoured in blasphemi
                     •
                  ,
then Kings endangered by conspiracie.
               God will haue mercy, where faith pleades
penitencie, and not sacrifice: and the angels
reioyce at the conuersion of a sinner.
               God hath told vs what wee ought to doe,
and therefore wee ought to looke no further:
for if we turne back againe to mens
inuentions, we shall seem to despise God
and trust in man.
               God is of that excellencie in his properties,
that euen heathen Philosophers (especially
Clcero) haue said, that as man by his wil
moues the members of his body: so God
by his almightie will moueth all the parts
of the whole world.
               God is more honoured with the hart, then
the lips: &amp; the poore more releeued with
the hand, then the tongue.
               
                  God the Father.
                  The fear of God is the learning of the wise;
the grace of God is the glory of the learned;

the peace of God is the rest of the
faithfull; the loue of God is the ioy of
the Elect.
                  God for his greatnesse is to be feared;
for his goodnesse to be loued;
for his wisedome to be admired;
for his loue to be honored;
for his grace to be serued;
for his mercy to be praised;
for his iustice to be reuerenced;
and for his glory to be adored.
                  God onely is the height of power;
the essence of goodnes;
the depth of wisedome;
the life of loue;
the spirit of grace;
the nature of mercy;
and the eternitie of glory.
                  God was before all times, and is aboue all
things: the onely life of beeing, and beeing
of life.
               
               
                  God the Sonne.
                  God so loued the world, that his sonne Iesus
Christ liued in the same, and died for
the same, to redeeme the Elect out of the
hands of the Diuell.
                  
                     
No man euer spake as Christ did: for hee
spake as with authoritie and power.
                  No man euer liued, as Christ did: for hee
liued without sin.
                  No man euer loued, as Christ did: for hee
gaue his life for his beloued.
                  No man euer did, as Christ did: for he healed
the diseased, droue out the diuels out
of the possessed, and raised the dead to
life.
                  No man euer healed, as Christ did: for hee
onely spake the word, and it was done;
touched the sore, and the party recouered;
yea the hemme of his garment had vertue
sufficient to stanch blood.
                  No man euer sailed, as Christ did: for hee
walked on the seas, and bad Peter come
vnto him.
                  No man euer sweat, as Christ did: for hee
sweat water and bloud.
                  No man euer feasted, as Christ did: for hee
turned water into wine; and fedde many
thousands with a few barly loaues and fishes.
                  No man euer died as Christ did: for he conquered
death and hell by his passion.
                  Therefore is hee aboue all: for

his wisedome to be admired;
his life to be commended;
his loue to be loued;
his power to be feared;
his death to be honored;
and his passion to be glorified.
               
               
                  God the holy Ghost.
                  God the holy Ghost is the full perfection
of the deitie; the third person in Trinitie;
the spirit of life; the life of grace; the
comfort of our soules; and the assurance
of our saluation.
                  God the holy Ghost, is neither created, nor
begotten, but proceeding: is the breath
of heauenly influence; the protector of
our weaknesse against the strength of the
diuell; the conqueror of tribulation; and
the assurance of all spirituall gifts.
                  God the holy Ghost is the clenser of our
filthinesse; the preparer of our hearts to
receiue good gifts; and the preseruer of
such infused vertues as are poured into
vs.
                  God will haue his owne word stand for a
law; his law to giue vs directions to know

the truth; his truth to be embraced before
the earth, or the world; and the world to
be hated in respect of eternall saluation.
                  God will haue all or none: for wee cannot
serue him and B
                           •
                        all: we may not looke vp
to heauen, and think on transitory things:
wee may not lift vp our heads on high, &amp;
haue our harts below in the world.
                  God and the Diuell are so opposite, that
though the Diuell neuer stirreth, but as far
as God permitteth: yet doth hee practice
nothing but to abuse God, and confound
man.
                  God cannot bee resembled to any liuing
thing, nor worshipped vnder any forme
or shape of a creature.
                  God is the author of truth, the diuell the
father of lyes; man the inuenter of vanitie:
woman the seducer of man; and all
other things and creatures the subiects of
man.
                  God is onely the searcher of harts; the discouerer
of hypocrisie: the reuenger of
iniuries: the entertainer of all persons,
without respect; and the maker of vvisedome
foolishnes.
                  God is not to be deceiued with mans deuises,

nor ouer-reached with mundane
policie.
                  God is loue; and he that meaneth to dwell
with him, must loue his brother, loue
himselfe, loue God, loue all that God hath
made: for God made nothing, but what is
good; nor must wee loue any thing, but
what is good.
                  God yeeldeth such plentifull matter to discourse
on, that I must conclude vvith the
Phylosopher; and take two daies respite
to tell you, what God is: and if you come
then to knowe further, I will take foure;
and if then, I will aske eight; and so aske
longer and longer. For the more you meditate,
the more you may: and when you
suppose to haue done, you haue further
matter to begin withall.
               
            
            
               Grauity.
               Like mee they looke, that well do signiorize
               Themselues, and others: Rulers that are wise.
               GRauitie is an honourable ornament,
but sometimes it represe
                     •
                  teth bad colours

to shadow a deformitie: for a foole
and an hypocrite may appeare both sad,
demure, and sober.
               Grauitie and orderly silence shewe a true
vnderstanding; when a fleering countenance
discouers dissimulation and folly.
               Grauitie in a Tyrant is a dangerous note of
tyrannie; and vvhen hee seemeth setled
to study, it is commonly to contriue some
bodies destruction.
               Grauitie is not so sutable to a young man,
as an old: yet doth it not amisse in either,
if not counterfeited, or ouer-much affected.
               Grauitie cannot be dissembled by a foole:
for as soone as euer hee setleth his countenance,
he discouers a change; and in the
very restraint, bursts out into ridiculous
action in one manner, or other.
               Grauitie is most necessary in a Iudge ouer
criminall causes, as well for the reuerence
of his place, as to strike a terror against
offenders not to hope for mercie, hovv
euer it may be affoorded vpon ture repentance.
               Grauitie is made known by a quiet minde,
reposed speech, decent actions, comelie

gesture, sober countenance, stately gate,
ciuill behauiour, &amp; sildomnes of laughter.
               Grauitie must not dally with a matter of
importance, nor encline to derision, when
a man in distresse stands at his triall for his
life.
               Grauitie may be dissembled by corrupt officers,
to the abuse of iustice, and ouerthrow
of sutors, who haue confidence in
the Magistrate.
               Grauitie in religious men hath a due of reuerence,
when they studie Gods glorie,
their own saluation, and the peoples edifying:
but to make grauitie onely a step
to vvorldly preferment, is the diuels policie.
               Grauitie is the fame of a Matron; the reuerence
of a Bishop; the comlinesse of a
Iudge; the maiestie of a Commaunder;
the cunning of a Scholer; the hope of a
Physitian; the dignitie of a Lawyer; the
honour of a Councellor; the louelinesse
of age; and the deceit of youth.
               Grauitie cannot endure scurrulous foolerie,
idle Iesters, inconsiderat talkers, palpable
ribaldry, wanton enterludes, impudent
behauiour, lasciuious demeanour,

and childish exercises.
               Grauitie sometimes couers ignorance; and
although pride may be suspected, yet it
tempers it from violence and rage.
               Grauitie is commonly a companion to Religion:
for from a Countesse to a country-wench,
if she but seeme to serue God, she
will shew it in a sober looke, and decent
attire.
               Grauitie keepes both men and vvomen
from outward burstings out of follie;
and indeede shadowes manie imperfections.
               Grauitie is much abused, when an officer
vnder colour of State, vvill not orderly
admit a petitioner to tell his tale.
               Grauitie is assumed on a sudden in the
selfe-same persons vpon notable changes:
as when a Courtier is preferred to be
a Chancellor; and a Chaplen to be a Bishop;
a seruant a master; a young Gentleman
a Iustice; a Merchant an Alderman:
and such like.
            
            
               
               Honour.
               On Vertue still I waite; and though I doo,
               The vertuous waite both for, &amp; on me too.
               HOnour, that breedes forgetfulnesse of
goodnesse, is wicked; while the true
eye of wisdom seeth all the world but vanitie.
               Honour that is gracious, is gotten by vertue,
and noble merit: and is neuer at full
height, till vertue bring it to heauen.
               Honour in his true definition is a certaine
reuerence, which one man yeeldeth to another
extraordinarily, for his vertuous
merit, and worthy desert: so that it should
not be wealth, but vertue, which should
make an honourable man.
               Honour is more great, that maintaineth others,
then that, which obtaineth for it
selfe: as wisedome, which is imployed for
the good of the Common-wealth, excelleth
that, which aymes at a mans priuate
ends.
               Honour is persecuted by the enuious, riches

and liberalitie by the couetous, and vertue
by the vicious: so that no man aduanced
to honor, can behaue himselfe so wel,
but he shall be sure to be watched by enuious
eyes.
               Honour hath certaine markes of preheminence
both in high titles of dignitie, and
many ceremonies of attendancie: and
this they receiue by imitation, and example
of scripture. For Abraham was called
the friend of GOD: Moses the man
of God: Iosua the great Captaine: Gedeon
a valiant man: Iudas the strength of
his brethren: and Christ Iesus a Sauiour,

                     el, or God with vs.
               Honour in some cases is inferior to Gentilitie:
for the auncestrie of bloud must
needes haue preheminence ouer a familie
newly erected. Whereupon I remember
a story of Henry the eight: who beeing
entreated to make a clowne a gentleman;
answered suddenly, hee could make him a
noble man, or person of Honour, as in
the estimation of the Common-wealth it
passed currant: but a Gentleman must
boast of his famous auncestors vertues,
and his owne worthy merit.
               
                  
Honour without desert is like a word without
substance, sense, or wit: and both may
be incident to a foole.
               Honour cannot consist in riches; for so
clownes may be honourable: but in truth
there can be no true honor in the loue of
the world. For Diogenes being asked who
were the most noble; answered, the despisers
of riches, glory, and pleasures of
this life, and the patient endurers of the
contrary. And Socrates said, that true honour
consisteth in the due temper of the
body and the minde.
               Honour, though it be neuer so glorious,
cannot be greater then Salamons, nor Salomons,
then the Lillies of the field.
               Honour maketh worldlings happy in their
titles: but heauen is the ioy of the blessed.
               Honour of a Soulder consisteth rather in
pitying captiues, then subduing of enemies:
this made Scipio so famous in Spayn,
who hauing a virgine of incomparable
beauty brought vnto him, when he vnderstood
how she was betrothed to a Prince,
he not only abstained from her, as remembring
his owne honor, but gaue the ransom
which her father brought to redeeme

her; with as much more of his own vnto
her husband in dower.
               Honour is truly established, when vertue is
embraced; but both must depend vpon
graue and good actions.
               Honour may be graced by fortune, &amp; fortune
may be great: but the vertuous are
truly wise and honourable, and the godly
truely noble.
               Honour without desert is like a painted
post without life: or a fantasticall idol
without a spirit, or a flower without any
sent.
               Honor is most famous, when men are borne
of gentle parents; rise to liue in great dignitie;
die in glorious libertie; are buried
with ensignes of vallure; and leaue a memorie
of their fames and glories to posteritie.
               Honor of the world is a meer chance of fortune:
but to be truly vertuous, the gift of
God, and delight of his Saints.
               Honour is neuer so out of countenance, as
when men of noble eminence descend to
base actions, and practice vile conditions.
            
            
               
               Humility.
               Without me, though men Angels be in sight,
               They are but black ones be they ne're so bright.
               HVmilitie suffreth wrong, though it be
enormous, and detaineth vs from doing
any which is impious: so that, if it
be for Gods sake, we are glad of the persecution,
and humble our selues to the
rod, leauing the reuenge to him.
               Humilitie and loue gaines the fauor of honour;
and the necessity of obedience caused
the law of allegeance.
               Humilitie vpon comparisons confesseth
want of power to be liberall; want of abilitie

                     •
                  o be seruiceable; want of libertie
to visit; want of wealth to recompence;
want of iudgement to conclude; vvant
of wisedome to determine; want of experience
to aduise; want of power to aduance,
and want of fauour to bring others
in grace.
               Humilitie cooleth the heat of ambition, and
is notwithstanding the staires to honourable

ascending.
               Humilitie brought saluation to all mankinde,
and Christ became man, to bring
men vnto God. By him were the burthened
vnloden; the wearied refreshed; the
hungry fedde; the thirstie quenched; the
lame restored; the lepers clensed; the God
of the world riding on an asses colt; the
childe of grace laid in a manger; the conquerer
of hell fled into Egypt; the commaunder
of Angels buffeted on the face;
the tamer of diuels scourged with rods;
the ruler of heauen led away by souldiers;
and the sauiour of the world cast down into
a graue; and all this was done, when in
the molde of loue, hee did melt the law of
feare.
               Humilitie in Christ did the worke of his father;
and that was to conuert sinners, and
saue the penitent soules.
               Humilitie rather forgiueth the dissembling
and treason of friends, then reuengeth the
iniuries of enemies.
               Humilitie teacheth vs rather to repent for
dooing of ill, then proudly to boast of doing
any good.
               Humilitie keepeth the heart from swelling

too high, as fasting keepeth the body
from growing too fat.
               Humily is commonly in league with loue,
and so turneth rough into plaine, black
into white, bitter to sweet, angry to quiet,
malicious to simple, grosse to discreet, &amp;
the heauy to light.
               Humilitie taketh in worth many despights,
neuer reuengeth iniuries, will not murmure
at them that anger him, deny them
that aske him, resist them that take from
him, answere them that reproue him, disgrace
them that shame him, nor absent
himselfe from them that send for him.
               Humilitie teacheth vs to pardon friends, &amp;
release offenders: but of all things wil not
suffer any to be proud, theeuish, murtherers,
adulterers, gluttons, malicious, nor
blasphemous.
               Humility striueth for no superioritie, is not
proud of aduancement, boasteth not of
knowledge, triumpheth not for preuailing;
nor insulteth ouer the deiected.
               Humilitie pleaseth God, is the gift of God,
maketh men fit for God, reioyceth Angells,
afflicteth diuels, helpeth men, and
preserueth the whole world.
            
            
               
               Hypocrisie.
               I holier seeme that each religious rout,
               Like a leane kidney, onely fa
                     •
                   without.
               HYpocrisie turneth the prayers of the
wicked into sinne, when the righteous
preuaile with God by penitent petitions.
               Hypocrisy makes a corrupt hart shew a dissembling
countenance: and as a double
face maketh a monster in nature; so a double
hart makes a diuell incarnate.
               Hypocrisie may deceiue a good eye-sight:
for hee that sees the face, knowes not the
hart, as when a man beholds a hansome
shooe, yet cannot tell where it wrings, or
pincheth him that weares it.
               Hypocrisie &amp; singularitie commonly walke
together, and discouer each other: for in
the attire, gesture, countenance, words,
and actions, there shall still appeare some
thing ridiculous, as if nature were forc't
by some cunning of Art, and the minde
restrained from his owne bent by filthi
                     •
                  
deceit.
               
                  
Hypocrisie is properly the poyson of true
religion.
               Hypocrisie is so great an enemy to mans
peace with God, that hee will pardon the
sorrowfull conuertist before the proud iustifier:
for he that standeth vpon tearmes
of dooing well, when hee determineth to
continue bad, is worse then he that looketh
vp to heauen, and falleth into some
durty puddle or other.
               Hypocrisie standeth vpon tearmes of practicing
and fulfilling idle ceremonies for
outward vaine-glory; and leaueth vndone
all charitable actions and true deuotions.
Thus did the Pharises wash their
hands, when their harts were defiled; cast
vp their eyes to heauen, when their feete
were fastned on the earth; went to the
Temple to pray, when they deuoured widowes
and orphanes at home; knocked &amp;
thumped their breasts before the pillers,
when their minde was on rapine, auarice,
and augmenting their inheritances.
               Hypocrisy doth tell his own secrets to learn
out the affaires of other men, and makes
you belieue shee would runne away with
the Hare, when indeed he determineth to

pinch with the hound. Thus are friends
betrayed, husbands abused, virgins entrapped,
orphancs deceiued, masters impouerished,
counsels discouered, treasons
contined, and aboue all, God and religion
dishonoured.
               Hypocrisie seemeth to aske aduise of Gods
seruants, how to proceed in religious
courses, or iustifiable actions: but if the
answere returne any thing against their
owne mindes, they repine &amp; follow their
owne wilfull humors.
               Hypocrisie will endure disgraces for aduantage,
and seeme to be humble and submissiue,
when indeed hee lyes in wait for
opportunitie of greater aduantage, or sorer
reuenge.
               Hypocrisie is the Genus or maine spring,
from whence the riuulets of flattery, cogging,
fawning, dissembling, vain-praises,
superfluous speeches, &amp; all cunning actions
ouerflowe mans naturall reason, and
euen disperseth poyson into the veines of
well enclined dispositions.
               Hypocrisie takes roote in the heart, and
so bursteth foorth like a growing tree
into many seuerall geftures, counterfet

shewes, seeming deuotion, vaine apparitions,
vvicked deceits, and absurd contrarieties.
            
            
               Inuections.
               No one thing in the world brings such a curse,
               As to detract the good, and make bad worse.
               INuections sauor of detraction, and both
proceed from enuy: impaire not therefore
another mans credit, nor spend on his
purse. For the one is his countenance, the
other his maintenance.
               Inuections of a venomous tongue, are the
ruine of a multitude; as the blasting wind
withers the fruit, or vnkindly mildewes
withers the corne.
               Inuections proceeding from iealous anger
against horrible transgressions, and impudent
sinners, are commendable, and represent
sharp corasiues to festered and inueterat
sores.
               Inuections that are defamatory vvithout
cause or good ground, are diabolicall, and
tooke originall from the serpents rayling

on God to the woman; whom hee knew
well enough, that as soone as euer they
should eate of the apple, their eyes should
be opened, like Gods, knowing good and
euill: and therefore he prohibited them;
but indeed, it was to debarre them of so
excellent a priuiledge.
               Inuections find great grace with the world;
for mens eares doe more itch to heare of
other mens faults and ouer-sights, then of
their vertues.
               Inuections need small oratory: for to rayle
on a man, bitter words are quickly found;
when to commend vertues, the sweetest
phrases are hardly belieued.
               Inuections are not accepted at all times alike:
for in a setled State, libels passe as
Pasquills; but in a time of innouation or
confusion, they are dangerous in themselues,
and perilous to the author.
               Inuections may be both waies matters of
policie, and both waies dangerous; especially
in millitarie affaires. Thus did the
explorators of the land of Canaan terrifie
the Iewes: thus did Caleb and Ioshua comfort
their bretheren.
               Inuections are meerely wicked, that depraue

praue the good, when they merit vvell;
extenuate their worth, when they deserue
farre better: and of a mole-hill of imperfections,
make a mountaine of transgressions.
But if he be cursed, that remooueth
the marke of his neighbours land: surely,
he must needs be accursed, that killeth him
oliue, and taketh away his good name.

                  ctions are so far from the rules of vertu

that whereas humanity pardons iniurie
                     •
                  ,
these will not remember good turns;
nay, from an ingratefull mind they repine
at small ones, and take the best but of dutie
and necessitie.
               Inuections are commonly taken in ill part,
&amp; may briefely be defined to be a too too
vehement rebuking of others, when vvee
are more faultie our selues.
               Inuections without cause, are in a foole ridiculous;
in a Diuine irreligious; in a
great man ignominious; in an officer malicious;
in a meane man dangerous; in a
wise man vngracious; and in all men, vnworthy
of commendation or allowance.
Inuections with cause, must bee moderated
against superiors; mittigated against
inferiors; sparing against equalls; and

confined vvithin the borders of charitie
toward all.
               Inuections are vnhappy ratings, when men
shall be told of their faults in publique,
that may otherwise be reprehended ciuilly
in priuate: this way good aduise doth
many times make the wicked worse: and
and so the fault remaines with the shame;
and the very best are rather obstinat, then
reclaimed.
            
            
               Ignominy.

               IGnominy is due to those that hold the
place of iustice, when Clyents are made
miserable by the delay of Courts, and partiallity
of Iudges.
               Ignominy followeth sudden falls; which if
it be from dignitie, is the anguish of the
hart: from wealth, the griefe of the mind:
but from 
                     〈◊〉
                   death of the soule.

preserued, but once broken, can neuer be
recouered.
               Ignominy followeth seuerall men in seuerall
sinnes; and is the more hainous, by
how much more their offences are vnnaturall:
as for a Diuine to be an hypocrite: a
Musitian mercenary: a rich man a theefe:
an old man lecherous: a young man impudent:
a matron vnmannerly: a vvife a
gadder abroad: a Prince couetous: a noble
man proud: a gentleman seruile: a
scholer ignorant: an officer vaine-glorious:
and a graue man a great talker.
               Ignominy is the shame of dignitie, when
honour is the grace of vertue.
               Ignominy was so fearefull to the Romans,
that they haue chosen rather to die honorably,
then liue infamously: nay, many of
them meerely to auoide shame, and open
opprobry, haue slaine themselues with
their owne hands.
               Ignominy must be auoided in our liues; as a
Gentleman must not consent to dishonorable
actions for 
                     〈…〉
                  : no, not pouertie

traytor, or committer of seruile crimes,
must looke to haue his actions registred
on record, and his infamy left to posteritie.
               Ignominy is no other then a feareful shame
for some base and degenerating courses
taken in our liues: as when a noble man is
auaricious, cruell, vnciuell, a receiuer of
bribes, and scornfull: a souldier to begge
or pilfer: a gentleman to proue a pandor,
and such like. In all which, the great man
must not presume on his power, nor the
meane man be desperat of his pouerty.
               Ignominy or reproach done to noble Captaines,
stirre vp reuenge, and is not pacified
without bloud. Thus was Narsetes
reuenged on the Empresse Sophia: &amp; many
others despighted with scorn &amp; taunts,
incited to strange courses, to reintegrate
their honours. The former story is thus;
When Narsetes gouerned the Western
Prouices for the Emperor Iustinian, and
had been famous for many noble exploits;
his enuiers suggested, that he ambitiously
sought the Empire: whereupon hee was
enforced to passe from Rome into Asia;
where appearing before the Empresse Sophia,
                  
shee thus taunted and defamed him;
Sith thou Narsetes art lesse then a man, &amp;
halfe a woman, beeing an Eunuch, I commaund
thee leaue the gouernment of the
Empire, and get vp to weaue, where my
maidens knit caules. Which words made
so forcible impression, that hee changed
countenance, the teares brake from his
eyes, and his choler thus vented his griefe;
Serene Princesse, I would you should chastise
me as a Lady, but not defame me like
a woman: It grieues me not so much for
that you haue said, as the occasion you
haue giuen mee to make you answere; I
therefore presently depart for Italy, but to
weaue, knit, and frame such a toile, as neither
thou maist comprehend, nor thy husband
vndoe.
               Ignominy is neuer more aggrauated, then
when women are cruell, which should be
pittifull; nor more deserued, then vvhen
subiects are disloiall, who ought to be
faithfull.
               Ignominy is like an Adder in a path, from
whose very sight a man would start back:
but not be tainted with the poyson vpon
any condition.
               
                  
Ignominy maketh taunts so fearefull, that
euen mean men haue answered great Emperors
distastingly to saue their reputation.
As when Alexander the great reproached
Cle
                        •
                     nidus the pirat for a thiefe &amp; rouer:
It is true great Prince said he, because
I rob but with one or two ships, I am therfore
defamed; but thou that fillest the Hellespont
with mighty nauies, art therefore a
mighty Emperour, and Monarch of the
world. Thus againe was the Lady Mary
of Padilia reproued for her ambition and
treason, when the commons reuolted in
time of Charles the 5. Emperor in Spaine.
If histories deceiue vs not, saith the author,
Mamea was proud: Medea cruell:

read of none that hath been disloyall and
a traytresse, but your Ladiship.
               Ignominy is worse then blowes: for they
punish but for a time, or at most our life
time; but shame and reproach continueth
after death: yea, maketh our posterity dishonourable
by our vile conditions, or base
proceedings.
            
            
               
               Idlenesse.
               With monstrous births I commonly do burst
               Of shame, diseases, pennury, and lust.
               IDlenesse will rather begge, then vvo
                     •
                  ke,
and then correction is needful: but when
the rich will starue the poore, the plague
is a good scourge of a Common-wealth.
               Idlenesse is an enemy to Honor, and sloth
bringeth pride to pouertie.
               Idlenesse cares for nothing, maketh men
gracelesse, and ioyned with sloth, quickly
vvitlesse; as ielousie increaseth madnesse.
               Idlenesse is the ground of ignorance, and
a foole is the scorne of reason: but exercise
maketh the fallow field fruitful, and a
good wit pleasant and plentiful.
               Idlenesse againe is the sister of doltishnesse,
both enemies to Art: vvhereas exercise,
conference, &amp; experience make both arte
and wit to yeeld forth fruit &amp; exornation.
Idlenes is cause of lazines, diseases, corruption
of bloud, &amp; dulls the spirit, which peraduenture

by nature would produce commendable
effects: but wearines may come
of weakenesse and great labour, and then
rest and idlenesse is a refreshing to nature,
and recouery of strength.
               Idlenesse worketh contraries against kinde:
for commonly idle men sleepe a daies, and
walke a nights: but woe be vnto them that
make day nigh
                     •
                  , and night day; for questionlesse
they cannot preuent pouerty.
               Idlenesse is called the graue of the liuing, &amp;
was so odious amongst the Persians, that
to auoid idlenes they would whittle sticks,
or rip the seames of their coats, to 
                     •
                  end
and sow them againe.
               Idlenesse is a priuation of goodnesse, and it
is ill to doe nothing, worse to doe bad, and
worst of all neuer to repent and amend.
               Idlenesse maketh a foole miserable, when
trauell maketh a wise man honourable.
               Idle men amongst the Philosophers were
banished, the couetous hated, the traitors
hanged aliue, the vicious were buried, and
the lasciuious were whipped.
               Idle Bees gather no hony, and so become
drones to rob the hiue: thus are pampered
iades vnapt to trauell, and lasie rogues vnwilling

to worke.
               Idlenes is to bee hated as vnprofitable, and
wickednes to be abhorred as damnable.
               Idlenesse causeth sleepe out of season, which
must be auoided: for sleepe is a kinde of
death, and therefore so much as you take
from sleepe, you adde vnto your life.
               Idlenesse is the mother of pouerty, the rust of
reason, the enemy of health, the spring of
malice, and the fountaine of vices: whereas
labour is the improuer of wealth, the preseruer
of health, the andidote of vice, the
seed of vertue, the mistresse of experience,
as experience is of art, and art of wit and
delight.

               Idlenes knowes not where to bestow itself,
nor how to imploy the time: but when
wakefull &amp; working villany makes a cloke
of honesty, God is dishonoured, and Gods

               Idlenesse boasteth of sleepe, as if it were a
praise to liue at ease: but a great sleeper
shall goe in a ragged coat.
               Idlenes many times begets frenzy, and then
the lunaticke and franticke are full of mischiefe,
which cannot be auoided, but by
industry and good endeuors.
               Idlenes sleepes out the morning, to the losse
of the whole day: but the night watches
are the bodies weakenes, and immoderate
sloath, the poison of health.
               Idlenes is hatefull; yet better lie still, then
goe about an ill busines: and better be asleepe,
then awake to doe villany.
               Idlenes is casie to a corrupt minde; yet willing
labor makes the taske more pleasing,
and when all is done, no goodnes can come
by the ease of lasines, whereas great matters
are compassed by industrious indeauors.
               Idlenes makes men nasty slouens, loathsome
and vnholsome; as weomen out of coiues,

pride, and folly, become ridiculously
fine.
            
            
               Kings.
               We Gods on earth are still enstil'd; what then?
               We should fly pride, sith we must die like men.
               KIngs as they be gracious and worthy of
their scepters, are Gods Lieuetenants,
and so they make Nobles vertuous, Officers
iust, Iudges vpright, Lawyers perfect,
Preachers zealous, Merchants industrious,
the Citizen honest, the Countrey-man laborious,
the Scholler studious, the Souldier
vigilant, all estates orderly dutifull, and
the whole land peaceable and plentifull.
               Kings haue glory through wisdome and encrease
of happinesse, by the loialty of the
subiect, and the confederacy of forren
Princes.
               Kings crownes seeme glorious, but the burthen
of them is heauy: for they bring more
cares, then their heads haue haires.
               Kings confederate themselues by diuine
wisdome and counsell, but ciuill discord

is a worke of the diuell.
               Kings maintaine not their maiestly by bigge
lookes, but by wise counsels, and reserued
cariages, nor magnanimity consis

high words: but in bountifull and roiall
deeds.
               Kings that are gracious, make the state
beautifull and sure, as castels well fortified
the indwellers secure.
               Kings loue high flying Hawkes: but if
they stoope to the Lure, they are the better
manned.
               Kings weare rich Diamonds as Iewels in
their hats; but a gracious Queene is a iewell
in his heart, and wise counsell a iem at
his eare.
               Kings that are good; are called gods: but
those that are wicked goe to the diuell for
all their titles.
               Kings are Gods Lieuetenants vpon Earth;
where if the Officers be not Saints, the Diuell
will creepe into their companies.
               Kings hearts are in the hands of God, how
euer the heart of the Kingdome is in the
hand of the King.
               Kings courts are best for fauourites; yet such
as bee young and vnexperienced may suppose

it a pleasure, as the warres are a brauery
to those that are ignorant.
               Kings must take heed of violence, or outragious
actions: for Dionisius hearing that
his sonne had deflowred a virgin of honor,
caused him to be brought before him, and
in great anger rebuked him; asking if euer
his father did the like? to which his sonne
answered? No? For you had not a King to
your Father; nor quoth he shalt thou haue
a King to thy sonne, if thou vse these vild
actions.
               Kings (after Alexander the Great his opinion
and answere to one, which demanded
how he came by his Monarchy;) maintaine
their estates by counsell, elloquence, martiall
discipline, and curteous liberality.
               Kings are more glorious in their wise and
vertuous gouernment, then in their sumptuous
pallaces: but aboue all their mercy
shewes a diuine spirit.
               Kings are blessed when God chooseth them
for his seruants, and the Kingdomes are
blessed when such a King is chosen ouer
them.
               Kings can neither endure comparisons,
though the subiect should excell in some

enriching quallity; nor contestings, though
they are in the wrong themselues.
               Kings haue scepters &amp; swords, the one their
subiects, the other for enemies, and both
for the honor of iudgement, and ornament
of maiesty.
               Kings fighting for kingdomes, make a valiant
conquest: but he that fighteth for his
conscience, makes a heauenly victory.
               Kings come to ruine by priuat profit, inward
hatred, and ciuill warre.
               Kings keepe their Crownes by armes, and
preserue their kingdomes by gouernment,
in both labour and art must make a league.
               Kings that get their Crownes by the sword,
enamell them in blood: but possessed with
peace, they are brighter then a Diamond.
               Kings are Masters in their own Kingdomes;
but euery seruant shall be their fellowes in
the kingdome of heauen.
               Kings that flourish, are the beauty of the
Earth, as Courts that flourish, are the beauty
of a kingdome.
               Kings may not be abused in their titles, nor
God prophaned in his name: nay, to conclude;
you must not think euill of the King
in your heart, no
                     •

               Knowledge.
               The world might starue, except I make the feast
               And man by me doth differ from the beast.
               KNowledge &amp; vnderstanding ioine hands
with vertue and industry, to crowne
the life with wealth and honour: so that by
them foure men of base parentage haue
come to place of high preheminency.
               Knowledge hath an eare, wisdome an eye,
trueth a tongue, and vertue a heart, which
heareth soundly, seeth cleerely, speaketh
wisely, and thinketh heauenly.
               Knowledge is like a tree, whose root is in a
reposed heart, the blossomes are elloquent
words, and fruit worthy and commendable
actions.
               Knowledge teacheth how well to liue, not
how long: the one wicked men commonly
desire, the other good men onely attaine.
               Knowledge makes a Prince maiesticall in
his Kingdome, and the care of Counsellors
is the key of the Common-wealth: for thus
are forren affaires discouered, and home

               Knowledge taketh instruction of occasion,

the end must bee first foreseene, and then
the meanes applied in their due time.

the temptations of the diuell, the treason
of enemies, and the importunity of friends:
In all which, though we know what wee
ought to doe, yet we practice the contrary,
and take part against knowledge with our
wicked affections.
               Knowledge is grauelled about the secrets of
the soule, because God hath framed it after
his owne image, and no man can tell what
God is by description.
               Knowledge directed all your Philosophers,
and learned men in their exemplary learning,
especially such as studied diuine matters,
whereupon Thales Milesius hath
taught vs, that the most ancient of al things
was God, for that he was alwaies: the most
beautifull thing, the world: for that it was
the worke of God: the most capable, was
place, because it comprehended all other
things; the most profitable, hope: for that
all other things gone, it onely remained;
the best thing vertue, because without her,
there could no good bee spoken off; the
most swift, the minde of man; for in an instant
it runneth through the world; the
most forcible, necessity, because it goes

beyond all other actions, and accidents:
the most easie, to giue counsell to other:
the most hard, for a man to knowe himselfe:
and most wise, Time: for that it followeth,
and obserueth all things.
               Knowledge more delighteth in the food of
the spirit, then the body: Whereupon
Charles the 4. Emperour, entring one day
into the schoole of Prage, and there staying
more then foure houres, to heare the
disputations of excellent scholers; vvas
told by some of his Lords, that it was time
to goe to supper: whereupon he replyed,
Ye that loue your bellies, get you to your
victuals; for I am better pleased thus to
increase my knowledge with these disputations,
then any other refections.
               Knowledge teacheth vs, that bookes are
faithfull counsellers: for Alphonsus of Aragon
was wont to say, that without fear,
enuy, flattery, hope of reward, or any other
passion whatsoeuer, they did faithfully
tell him whatsoeuer he demanded. And
Cicero called them deerly beloued books,
a pleasant houshold: for if he would, they
would talke with him, if not, they were
silent at his commandement: they were

nigh him without importunitie, neither
rash, cruell, rauening, nor malicious: but
euery way affording satisfaction.
               Knowledge most deceiueth a man, when he
is proud of his own conceit, and so groweth
to selfe-loue: whereby hee starteth aside
before he come to true knowledge indeed.
               Knowledge doth not consist in much reading,
but in iudicious obseruation, and
orderly conceiuing, how to adopt, what
hee reades, to good purpose and vse when
hee shall haue occasion.
               Knowledge teacheth men both secrets of
Art, and wonders of Nature. By it amongst
others you may obserue, that these
three things are most firme in their operations,
suspition, winde, and loyaltie:
the first, where it once entreth, neuer parteth:
the second, neuer entreth, where it
cannot get out: and the third, where it
once goeth away, it neuer returneth.
               Knowledge leadeth to vertue, vertue to estimation,
estimation to honour, honour
to obseruation, obseruation to loue, loue
to heauen; and these be the steps of the
ladder of life.
               
                  
Knowledge instructeth thus farre of the
soule; that the soule being alwaies one &amp;
the same, by her qualities and powers assumeth
diuerse different titles; as a spirit,
whereby we contemplate; a sense, whereby
we see, and feele; a minde, wherby we
conceiue; a knowledge, whereby we vnderstand;
a reason, whereby we discerne;
a will, whereby we consent; a memorie,
wherby we record; &amp; an essence, whereby
we liue: and all these are but one soule.
               Knowledge of Philosophy is a good studie;
but a man must beware, least in seeking
for gold, he lose not his siluer. For Alchumistrie
is rather a knauery, then a knowledge.
               Knowledge discouers the errors of auncient
writings, &amp; present experience feares
not in many things to goe cleane contrarie,
and as it were flat against the face of
antiquitie.
               Knowledge teacheth a Gardiner to cull the
weedes from the wholesome herbes: the
husbandman to till &amp; plough his seasons:
the Physitian to decipher the operation of
simples: the Artificer to fashion his work
to the best formes, and with the best aduantages:

and all estates sexes &amp; degrees,
perfection in the works of their callings.
               Knowledge of a mans selfe onely makes a
man wise, how euer his bookes teach him
the knowledge of many other things.
            
            
               Knauery.
               All feasts and companies I doe frequent,
               But best I fare among the innocent.
               KNauery makes men seeme good, which
are not: but at last in deceiuing others,
they deceiue themselues.
               Knaues and Pandars are the venome of a
Court, parasites and flatterers the poison
of a Prince; brokers and vsurers the cormorants
of a city, and couseners and cunny
catchers, the vndoing of the countrey.
               Knauery sometimes gains credit by chance,
as cunning without learning: but yet the
seed that is sowen by knauery, for the most
part makes an vnhappy haruest.
               Knauery makes the heart false, and a face of
brasse to blush at nothing, and outface any
thing.
               
                  
Knaues are impudent, as fooles be importunate:
both a griefe to the honest, and trouble
to the wise.
               Knauery boasteth of shifting wit, and yet
endeth with beggary; while a vertuous
heart is sull of grace, and either obtaineth
temporall blessings, or is contented with
that which it hath.
               Knauery is meer fraud &amp; mockery of friendship,
when vnder colour of loue and kindnesse,
a man either discouers his friends secrets,
or worketh vpon his estate, or makes
way to entise and obtaine his wife, or deceiueth
the trust committed vnto him, or
leaueth him in misfortunes, or indeed maketh
a dissimuled shew of loue, and falleth
backe when there is a triall to be made.
               Knaues in their knaueries, are like swine
that are wallowing in foule and filthy
places, who not onely bedurty themselues,
but raise a stinke to trouble others.
               Knauery makes the Officer take bribes, the
Lawyer pleade in a wrong matter, the wife
to cuckold her husband, the Merchant to
play h
                     •
                  r querout when he need not; the citizen
vse false measures and weights, and
euery tradesman to vse his peculiar deceits,

the Mercer to mingle mice turds with his
pepper, the Artifice
                     •
                   to loiter, the countryman
to water his corne, to make it weigh
heauy, the plow-man to make his furrowes
too shallow, and all men to abuse themselues,
and cosen other in their calling.
               Knauery is an ouercunning of wit and craft,
which hath twenty tricks to cosen others;
but at the last, of all others coseneth the
author most. Yet an ideot is a disgrace to
nature, and is neither profitable to himselfe
or any other.
               Knauery of one man troubleth a whole
towne. For as the windes doe make the
seas to worke, which now doe tosse, now
sinke the boat: so when knaues practice
their intended plot, the trouble or mischiefe
lights on some mans pate.
               Knauery is an instrument out of the diuells
budget, and serueth for as many purposes,
as his workman will apply it vnto: It is
neuer idle, and yet not wel imployed: it is
euer busie, but deserueth little thanks for
his labour.
               Knauery still tendeth to deceit, and yet is
sometimes caught in its owne craft: for
a fox seeing a cock sitting vpon a tree, called

to him with these words; Good morrow
cosin, 
                     〈◊〉
                   tell you good newes▪
There is a great peace made amongst all
the liuing creatures of the world, so that
none may offend another; therefore I prethe
                     •
                  
come downe, and let vs talke a little
merily together of this world. Indeed said
the cock, these are good newes; but what

                     〈◊〉
                   those two dogs, that come with open
mouth toward thee? Whereat the foxe in
a feare starting, and looking behind him,
stayed a little. Why how now, quoth the
cock; if the newes be true, why feare you
the dogges? O, quoth the fox, I beleeue
the dogges haue not heard of it, &amp;c. But
by this meanes, his knauery was detected,
and he went without his prey.
               Knauery makes a villaine laugh euen going
to hanging, and as we say, breake a iest of
the gallowes: but an honest heart findes
matter of griefe and displeasure, at euery
offence of God and his neighbour.
               Knaues can doe great euil out of a little wit,
when honest men can do little good wanting
wealth.
               Knauery is commonly either in wicked
words, or villanous actions: yet sometimes

sullen silence dissembles, when most
mischiefe is a working.
               Knauery is the cause why the wicked are
flattered, and the good depraued. The diuell
sets both on worke, and hee will pay
them their wages.
            
            
               Lawes.
               All Nations liue in order, peace and right
               When lawes do rule, &amp; sway an arme of might.
               LAwes make treason like the eyes of a
Cockatrice, which kill, if they espy vs
first with their venom: but are killed, if
we discouer it in his poyson.
               Lawes make a sword the seruant of iustice,
and a scepter the instrument of mercy; &amp;
as iustice must be shewed to the reprobate;
so must mercy extend to the penitent.
               Lawes in misgouernd Common-wealths
are compared to cobwebbes, through

               Lawes, or if you will, going to law, require
both charge and trauaile; but miserable
is that breath, which is sold to iniustice for
mony, and terrible is that trauaile that vndoes
the Master.
               Lawes are broken by scorne, and custome:
as for the fooles excuse ignorance, howeuer
it may goe currant, when fauour admits
it, it is no plea against the fault, or
the penaltie.
               Lawes that are commaunded by God, are
to be obeyed before such as are commanded
by men; and thou shall finde it better
to goe to prison, then to hell.
               Lawes are like a paire of tarriers; and hee
that enters into them, is like the treading
in a Maze, who goeth in with ease, &amp; out
with labour. Or if you will, the fellow in
the horne; who leapeth lustily into the
great end, but is squeezed at the going out
of the small.
               Lawes are made to terrifie offenders, as

               Lechery.
               When lust doth master reason, man's a beast
               Raging in sin; most loathsome at the least.
               LEchery is loue abused in carnal delight:
and as scoffes are the superfluity of wit,
scabs of humours; so is lust of desires.
               Lechery is a filthinesse belonging onely to
men: for they against kinde, and times, abuse
both themselues and others without
any respect; whereas beasts are limited by
nature: and how-euer they rage in their
seasons, yet are they moderate when the
heat is past, especially the female, &amp; will
not abuse one another in an vnnaturall or
vnseasonable sort.
               Lechery is an inward infection; for all other
sinnes are without the body, but this
is an offence against a mans own body.
               Lechery is a filthinesse of such beastly varietie,
that men may sinne with men, women

vvith vvomen: man may sinne by
himselfe, by and with his owne wife,
with beasts in abhominable prostitutions:
with their own blouds and kinred in
incestuous maner: with other mens wiues
in adulterous copulation: with all sorts in
filthy licenciousnesse: and in all, both abuse
GOD, and confound themselues in
body and soule.
               Lechery corrupted the vprightnes of Lot,
weakened the strength of Sampson, befooll'd
the wit of Salomon, prophan'd the
holinesse of Dauid, confounded the peace
of Israel, &amp; brought a curse on Baal Peor
for seducing the Iewes.
               Lechery weakneth the body, shortneth the
life, corrupts the mind, impouerisheth the
state, infameth the credit, dulleth the vnderstanding,
dampeth the hart, and damneth
the soule.
               Lechery is so fearefull a temptation, that as
a Father of the Church writes, Paul was
stung with the loue of a virgin, which followed
him in the seruice of Christianitie:
how then can a man be safe alone with a
bad woman, but he shall fall into the snare
of the diuell. And if the choice Apostles

haue entred this combat of concup
                     •
                  scence,
how shall worldly men, and obsceane liuers
preuaile in the same?
               Lechery, after Aristotle and other Phylosophers,
is the ruine of the body, the abridgment
of life, the corruption of vertue, the
breach of the law, and the effeminating of
manhood.
               Lechery named the first whore, made the
first 
                     ••
                  ckold, brybed the first bawde, and
bred the first bastard.
               Lechery was begot by ease and idlenesse, is
maintained by pride and wantonnesse, decaies
by want and weaknesse, and dies in
shame and filthinesse.
               Lechery is an enemy to virginitie, the death
of honesty, the breach of amity, and the
nurse of iniquitie.
               Lechery is remedied with fasting, and the
body tamed with exercise: and if a man
would be continent, hee must auoide the
occasions, and meanes of the act.
               Lechery is naturally attended with shame
and feare: for the violentest man in his ragingest
heat, would be loath to be seene,
and afraid to be known in such an vnlawfull
action.
               
                  
Lechery will proue an vnprofitable plea in
Gods law: for if he could not be excused,
that said, he had maried a wife, and therefore
could not come; hee cannot be excused
that is with a whore, and therefore wil
not come.
               Lechery makes age doat, youth mad, a seruant
a commaunder, a free man a slaue, a
foole ciuill, a woman impudent, a valiant
man temperat, a coward valiant, a beast
fond, and a tyger milde.
               Lechery breeds a painfull pleasure, a woful
repentance, a miserable delight, and hellish
reward.
               Lechery is in plaine tearmes extreame lust,
vnlawfull loue, brutish desires, beastlie
wantonnesse, and the itch or scab of old
concupiscence: so that when a lasciuious
man hath as it were no abilitie to sin, yet
the polluted hart hath a good will to bee
sinning.
               Lechery rauished Dina; deceiued Iuda with
Tham
                        •
                     r; destroyed Gomorrah; traduced
Ammon; murdered Vriah; wrought folly
in Israel; and brought fiery serpents into
the host.
            
            
               
               Loue.
               O
                     •
                   loue alone depends Gods royall law;
               That is, when loue of God doth stand in awe.
               LOue breeds awfull subiection, and willing
obedience, without murmuring or
questioning.
               Loue is a hidden fire, a pleasing wound, a
sweet poyson, a bitter sweet, a delightful
disease, a pleasant punishment, a flattering
death.
               Loue which is vnhonest, ends in a thousand
sorrowes and trauailes: for many times, if
the woman doe not dissemble, play false,

                     •
                  nd impouersh one; yet doe men become
wounded, watched, abhorred, flowted,
defamed, and bepilled.
               Loue of Princes glads the heart of the subiects;
and when the reward of vertue is
not delayed, then is vertue proud of good
gouernment.
               
                  
                     •
                  oue is the ioy of the heart, as faith is the
salue of the soule.
               Loue of many, like a diuided flame or

streame is weakened by diuision; but hee
that loues not at all, is of a strange condition
and cold constitution.
               Loue can sometimes yeeld no reason euen
in sensible men; as hate no measure in an
inraged humor.
               Loue maketh a man hansome, that peraduenture
cannot reach to pride, and teacheth
him ciuilitie, that otherwise vvanteth
common humanitie.
               Loue breedeth melancholy, and melancholy
requires solitarinesse; and solitarinesse
setteth the thoughts on worke: but wisedome
preuenteth the mischiefe, and maketh
exercise a dispeller of wantonnesse.
               Loue is commonly both praised and possessed
by constancie; but feare doth frustrate
all desire, and is indeed loues onely enemie.
               Loue is in his glory, when it is enamoured
on vertue: but where beauty bewitcheth
reason, there is a base, and (vsually) an vnlucky
passion.
               Loue hath a language in silence, which is
rather seene in action, then protestation.
               Loue thy wife as thy selfe; thy children as
of thy selfe; thy friend next to thy selfe;

but GOD aboue thy selfe.
               Loue trusteth our wiues with life, our
friends with our goods, our kinred vvith
our liberty, the common-wealth with our
honour, and the Diuines with our soules:
but God is to be trusted in all, &amp; ouer all.
               Loue, that makes ones head a cushi
                     •
                   for his
Mistris feet, shewes that hee findes more
force in her eyes, then in his own
                     •
                   hart.
               Loue with ielousie and a mad man, are cosin
germanes in vnderstanding: for questionlesse
loue is a madnes, and then had Bedlam
need to be a great house: for hee that
neuer was in that predicament, is either
blind, or babish.
               Loue, and the cough, and a woman with
child, can hardly be concealed.
               Loue is happy, where eyes speak, harts answer,
and faith is firme.
               Louers that are eager and affectionate, are
like fighting hennes, who in hope of victory
thinke they haue spurres on their
heeles.
               Loue that is wanton, breeds but losse of
time, and malicious humours bring the
soule to destruction.
               Loue not without a cause, and leaue not a

sure hold: for affection may be deceiued,
and fortune is faithlesse.
               Loue is painted like a Chimera, which was
a monster according to Fulgentius, with
three heads: the fist a Lion; the second a
Goat; the third a serpent: signifying, that
loue was fierce and proud as a Lion in the
beginning, libidinous and luxurious like a
Goat in the midst; and in the end, full of
poyson like a Serpent.
               Loue of goodnesse begins in the loathing
of euill, as the declining from good breeds
inclination to ill: but both good and ill
cannot agree in a godly soule.
               Loue hath not her perfect obiects or best
conditions, if men loue the world, which
is so full of deceitfull flatteries; or their
owne humors, which draw men into many
dangers; or themselues more then their
neighbours; or God not more then themselues.
               Loue relieueth the miserable, and sendeth
soules to heauen; maketh the beautie of
the Church to shine; and taking the name
and effect of charitie, is the pathway to
saluation.
               Loue is not loue but sorow, not mirth but

displeasure, not 
                     •
                  aste but torment, not recreation
but confusion, when in the enamoured,
there is not youth, libertie, and
liberalitie.
               Loue, according to the world, enstructeth
young men to serue; the liberall to spend;
the patient to suffer; the discreet to haue
skill to talke; the secret to keepe silence;
the faithfull to gratifie; and the valiant to
perseuer.
               Loue the Bee for her hony, and allow her a
good hiue: but trouble not her labours,
lest her sting be vnpleasant.
               Loue is seene euen in creatures void of reason:
for the Pellicane makes her breast
bleed, yea sometimes to death to feed her
young; and the Stork is not vnkinde to
feed her old one in age.
               Loue, of all passions is the sweetest, and
treason of all villany is the vildest.
               Loue in youth, is full of kindnes: in age, ful
of trouble: in folly, full of vanity: in ielou
                     •
                  e,
full of frenzie: and in necessity, ful
o
                     •
                   misery.
               Loue was an old nothing to exercise wit in
idlenesse: and is now a new nothing to
feed 
                     •
                  olly with imagination.
               
                  
Loue is begotten by the eyes, bred in the
braines, walks in the tongue, growes with
the flesh, and dies in an humor.
               Loue doth trouble wit, hinder Art, hurt
nature, disgrace reason, lose time, spoile
substance, crosse wisedome, serue folly,
weaken strength, submit to beautie, and
abase honour.
               Loue is wills darling, patience triall, passions
torture, the pleasure of melancholie,
the play of madnesse, the delight of varieties,
and the deuiser of vanities.
               Loue is the virgins crack; the widowes
cros
                     •
                  e; the bachelers bane; the maried
mans purgatory; the young mans misery;
and the ageds consumption: a fained god;
an idle fancy; a kinde of fury; &amp; in some,
a frenzie.
               Loue is the abuse of learning; the ground
of enuy; the stirrer of wrath; the cause of
mischiefe; the disquiet of the minde▪ the
distracter of the wit; the disturber of the
senses; and destruction of the vvhole
man.
            
            
               
               Liberty.
               I rather had abroad my selfe engage,
               Then with the Larke liue in a golden cage.
               LIberty is such a priuiledge of nature,
that the bird had rather flie in the open
fieldes, then sing in a siluer cage, or princely
banqueting house: from which euen
with gladnes, if an escape can be made, she
flieth away.
               Liberty hath bin so precious euen amongst
Cities and Countries, that many of them
haue destroied themselues, rather then be
subiect to their conquering enemies. Witnes
Numantia, who from her ancient originall
of Greeks, and immitation of their
honorable maintaining their liberty, set
fire of all they had, and after killed one another.
               Liberty is so sweet a delight, that it hath
made kingdoms forsworne, and Princes
breake their vowes, which necessity enforced:
witnes al the tributs that France, England,
Denmarke, and other Countries haue

payd to one another: and for vvhich
whole Armies haue been leuied, battailes
fought, thousands slaughtered, Cities deuasted,
Countries ouer-runne, and people
brought to ruine; and all to maintain
                     •
                  
their libertie.
               Liberty hath caused many rebellions, and
taught great Princes admirable lessons of
magnanimitie. For when Zenobia Queen
of Palmira had lost her husband Odenatus,
shee raised warres in Syria against
the Romans to maintaine her liberty: but
at last, ouercome by Aurelianus the Emperour,
and carried in tryumph to Rom
                        •
                     ,
shee there died in sorow for the losse of
her libertie.
               Liberty is a bewitching pleasure; for it
bringeth vs to pouerty: for rather the
                     •
                  
vvee will take paines, or serue in some
honourable attendancie, we will be idle,
as vagabonds, and abuse libertie in wicked
and abhominable liues.
               Libertie is cause of all disorder: for if the
licencious be not restrained by law, &amp; terrified
from offending by punishment, and
detained in obedience by denial
                     •
                   of libertie;
they would runne at randome to all

vices: and set open a larger fielde of intemperancie.
               Liberty is the mother of wantonnesse; and
therefore as in a Citi
                     •
                   there be many watches,
Courts of gard, gates defended,
rounds walking, and Sentinells standing
to keepe men within their houses at vnseasonable
times: so in the libertie of our
liues, there be diuerse vertues to suppresse
our rebellious thoughts, and as it were,
put in prison our impious cruptions of
frailetie.
               Liberty many times proceedeth from honorable
respects, and causeth losse of life before
losse of reputation: as in the story of
Sopho
                        •
                     isba may appeare; whom when
Masinissa had promised Scipio to deliuer
into his hands: because hee would performe
his word, and defende her glorie
from captiuitie, hee caused her to poyson
herselfe; and so rendred the dead body
to the Romans.
               
               Libertie is the iewell of life, and comfort
of our verie soules. For if wee be free,
it makes vs the Lords seruants: and if
wee be seruants, it aduanceth vs to be the
Lords free-men: so still we must be at liberty

from sinne, to auoide the seruitude
of Hell.
               Liberty is a good mother of many bad children:
for sloth, idlenes, licentiousnes, vanity,
wantonnes, abuse of time, pouerty, and
wants are many times the birth of her trauels,
and become monsters in the world
through the abuse of libertie.
               Libert

                  orous virgin, for
both tend to destruction, and without speciall

               Merchant.
               I am (if royall) of that dignit
                     ••
                  ,
               As bright, by right, makes my posteritie.
               MErchant is a worthy cōmon-wealths
man, for how euer priuate commoditie

may transport him beyond his owne
bounds: yet the publicke good is many
wayes augmented by mutuall commerce,
forren trading, exploration of countries,
knowledge of languages, encrease of nauigation,
instruction and mustering of seamen,
diuersity of intelligences, and preuention
of forren treasons.
               Merchant is onely traduced in this, that the
hope of wealth is his principall obiect
whereby profite may arise, which is not
vsually attained without corruption of
heart, deceitfull protestations, vaine promises,
idle oathes, paltry lyes, pedling deceit,
simple denials, palpable leauing his
friend, and in famous abuse of charitie.
               Merchant must bee cunning in diuers artes,
nay: neede both learning and iudgement,
especially Arethmaticke, Cosmography,
morallitie, Rhetoricke, vnderstanding to
make vse of time, and place, and skill in his
profession to knowe what is cheape to bee
bought abroad, and deerely soulde at
home? where ready money serues the
turne, and exchange of commoditie supplies
the want, how hee shall be entertained,
how long, and how many times welcommed,

because in some places they are
tied to precepts, and limited to proclamations.
               Merchant is no common freeman ouer the
world, as we suppose: for euery countrey
hath her seueral restraints, he that trauels in
the East, may not goe into the streights, he
that goes into Indy, cannot trade into Turkey,
not he that sends to Turkey haue busines
in Stode, or other places of our principall
marts, except he be free of those companies,
and haue serued accordingly in his
prentiship.
               Merchant is a ciuell and conuersable man,
rich in money, delicate in apparell dainty
in diet, sumptuous in furniture, elloquent
in discourse, secret in his businesse, carefull
in his losses, watchfull for his profit, and aboue
all, sparing in his lending of money.
Merchant continuing his estate, may setle
his fortune, and augment his credit: but if
he once turne Gentleman before his time,
hee is like a gamster that plales at a game
he knowes not for a great deale of money:
wherein I will giue you onely one reason,
whereas before hee imployed his time to
get wealth, he now spends it in consuming

his substance: and whereas before he remained
in his owne element, and so had
some lustre, he now is counted but an intruder,
and purchaseth onely vanitle.
               Merchant committeth this error in his natiue
opinion to speake 
                     •
                  uill of Gentlemen,
when all that he labours for, is to be esteemed
so, or at least to leaue his sonne so,
both in name and libertie.
               Merchant is a substantiall commonwealths
man, how euer some pedlary fellowes, and
paltrey brokers haue abused the title.
               Merchant must take heede of keeping his
word and credit: for if he faile at his daies,
and absent himselfe from the common
place of entercourse, as we cal it the Bursse,
let him be neuer so rich, he looseth a good
opinion, and hazardeth his reputation for
euer.
            
            
               Man.
               A litle world I am, and all controule.
               As Gods vicegerent, but the inward soule.
               MAn seeming wise, and is not, is no better
then a foole: and hee that is

wise, and seemes not: is a flower without
a sent.
               Man though neuer such a dwarffe growes
not on the highest hill: or neuer so tall,
looseth any thing in the lowest valley.
               Men (as Astrologers doe dreame) doe receiue
qualities according to the condition

as from Saturne a man hath vnderstanding,

Mars courage, from the Sunne vertue,

of both.
               Man is subiect to such blindnesse of minde,
that he will fast, pray, and take paines for
a momentary pleasure, but will doe neither
for the true and heauenly pleasure.
               
                  
Man that is carnall, persecuteth the spirituall,
through ignorance or Enuy: but the
spirituall man pardoneth the carnal throgh
wisedome and mercy.

               Man and his ages are described by the foure
times of the yeere: as the spring his infancie,
the summer youth, the haruest manhood,
and the winter olde age.
               Man was formed without Paradice, yet had
he the name of superiour: Euah was framed
in Paradice, that had the name of inferiour:
so it is not the place, but the
perfection, that giueth the title to noblenesse.
               Man is the image of God, the choyce creature
of his loue, the commaunder of all
creatures the lobourer of the earth, the obse
                     •
                  uer
of nature the deuicer of formes, and
the student of grace.
               Man is the lesser world, the pilgrim of the
earth, the traueller to heauen, the honour
of reason, the wonder of nature, the ioy of
Angels, and the iewell of heauen.
               Woman is the femall of man, the second

creature, the care of time, the trouble of
reason, the exercise of patience, the
strength of will, the weakenesse of vnderstanding,
the encrease of numbers, the delight
of vanitie, the pride of beautie, the
abuse of loue▪ the breeder of iealosie, and
the deceit of trust.
               Man being subiect to passion, will quickely
ouerthrowe his vnderstanding, if he doe
not refraine by reason, so that euen worldly
loue, wherein the best men are ouerreached,
will turne to displeasure without
manly restraint, and orderly remedies,
which are absence and imployment.
               Man of himselfe can doe no good, though
he seeme to commend all the creatures in
world.

speeches: for how-euer the lippes of
wantons will runne ryot to please themselues;
yet doth modestie restraine them
from impudent discourses, and vndecent
behauiours.
               Modosty restraineth men from a greedy desire
of vaine-glory, and cannot endure anie
palpable and grosse flattery to mens
faces.
               Modesty keepeth women from going abroad;
when they are abroad, from entring
into any infamous &amp; notorious places
when they come into such by compulsion,
or necessitie of time or company,
from giuing example of any ryot, and vnciuell
behauiour: and when the companie
is ouer-seene in either, from tarrying in
the same, or forbearing the like excesse, as
if they tooke no pleasure therein.
               Modesty is euen an ornament in Princes;
which made Alphonsus King of Naples the
wonder of his time for many gracious actions;
especially when a Gentleman of

                     ples vpon an iniury done vnto him by a

great officer, which he could not reuenge,
fell into a frenzie: wherein he hauing passed
many idle actions like a lunatick, hee
was further subiect to the noble mans enuy.
Whereupon, he came one day to the
King to begge the gouernment of the Castle
which the Gent: had; alleaging it
was not fit for a mad man to haue any possession
of lands or castles. But the worthy
Prince most modestly answered, Alas, thy
request is vnreasonable; for if God haue
layd his punishment vpon him for his sins,
to distemper a little his braines, vvouldest
thou haue me play the diuell, without offence,
to take away his goods and honors,
&amp; so driue him quite out of his wits? No,
I will not adde vnto his affliction.
               Modesty is the daughter of Nurture: and
how-euer sometimes it prooueth the cunning
of nature, when a lasciuious woman
would appeare honest and religious; yet
questionlesse, it hideth the fault, and excuseth
the imperfection: so that shee passeth
without publique condemnation, and
infamous opprobry.
               Modesty will not iustifie vnhonest actions;
so that how-euer we are driuen by nature

the ignorant; an enemy from insulting ouer
anothers misery; a valiant souldier
from disgracing a weake courage; a rich
man from vp-braiding a begger; and all
degrees from vaine-glorious appearances.
               Modestie fleeth from the conuersation of
the lasciuious, and auoideth the occasion
of incontinencie; so that though men doe
amisse, yet in the sildomnes, and ciuel demeanour,
a pardon before hand is granted,
and no man can iudge by the outward
show.
               Modestie apparrelleth in comlinesse, howeuer

               Money.

                  abe;
               For as they vse me, them Ile marre or make.
               MOney, or if you will riches, (for so remember,
that this word shall stand
for both, yea for all) augmenteth the pleasures
of life: but the ioy of the godly is
in such obiects and pleasures, as cause contempt
of all worldly wealth.
               Money maketh a man a 
                     •
                  laue, if hee make
not a slaue of it; and when it hath done, it
will be gone, wee knowe not when, nor to
whom.
               Money imployed to necessary vses, &amp; good
purposes, brings comfort to our consciences;
but hoorded vp, is infectious, &amp; will
witnesse against vs.
               Money breeds not so many inconueniences
in the want, as in the bad imployment; euen
as there is lesse hurt in the want of wit,
then in the ill imploying of it. But the
want of honestie and grace (which is the
only true treasure, that cannot be abused,

but makes men immortall if it be well imployed)
is a greater want, and more lamentable
losse, then either of both.
               Money and wit doth many wonders in the
world; but the vertuous and faithfull are
gracious with God, and shall be glorious
with him in the world to come.
               Money is the Monarch of the world; the
maintenance of pride; the nurse of couetousnesse;
the steward of Lechery; the
sower of 
                     •
                  edition; the cause of warre; the
sinnewes of warre; and the ouer-throwe
both of Citie and Country.
               Money is the gluttonous purueyor, the
drunkards cupbearer, the theefes tempter,
and the hangmans master.
               Money is the misguider of wit, the corrupter
of conscience, the blinder of reason,
the ouerthrower of honour, the Vsurers
God, the poore mans oppression, the Lawyers
hope, and the labourers hire.
               Money doth good to few, hurt to many;
pulls downe Churches, buildes faire houses,
makes the prodigall an ape, and the
miser a dogge: makes furrowes in the Ocean,
and fire in mens braines, fetcheth the
beasts from the wildernesse, and the birds

out of the ayre; drawes fancies out of
fine wits, and eloquence from learned
mouthes; makes friends foes, &amp; enemies
friends, and serues all professions, qualities,
and conditions, from the King to
the begger.
               Money is the reliefe of the poore, and the
ruine of the rich: because the one dooth
lacke it, and the other abuse it.
               Money is good, so it be well got; better, if
it be well imployed; and not ill, if it bee
honestly left.
               Money makes men to commit idolatry, but
hee is of a strange religion that thinketh
gold a God.
               Money for want of grace maketh man finde
means to get riches; wit to increase them;
will to keepe them; and power to possesse
them: but teacheth not the owner the true
vse of them, nor yeelds him any perfect
pleasure in enioying them; but makes
them that might be Lords of other mens,
to be slaues to their owne proper goods.
               Money causeth cursed auarice, which is far
worse then honest pouertie; because the
poore man is contented with his little, &amp;
the rich man with his aboundance, seemeth

to himselfe to be in necessity.
               Money is the grand witch of the world,
which infects all minds, and worketh mischiefe
where euer it comes: no Coniurer
can allay the euill, that is raised by this deuill.
               Money in the best increase breedeth care,
and the proudest confidence maketh our
chiefest footing a changeable sleeting.
               Money was not made to be kept, but well
imployed: better are the vessels that poure
out mercy, then hoord vp mettals.
               Money makes the passage in all Countries,
how-euer learning is good for iudgement,
and language for trauaile.
               Money in the want causeth much woe: but
the want of grace is the soules misery.
Money is a blessing, if the rich relieue the
needy, and knowledge a true comfort, if
the learned instruct the ignorant.
               Money, wanting to supply necessity, puts a
wise man to his wits, as a tired horse in a
foule way to his patience.
               Money is dangerous for surfet in the sweetnesse,
but vnsauorie and very sower, when
it hath once bred the soules distemper:
nay, then it is tyrannous in power, and

terrible to the troubled minde of the owner;
drawing out the life in the length of
cares, and shutting it vp in the misery of
repentance.
               Money makes the couetous man want that,
which he possesseth; and the whole life of
the niggard is spent in penance.
               Money maketh a wretched niggard seeke
carefulnes for himselfe, enuy for his neighbours,
spurres vnto his enemies, a prey for
theeues, perill for his person, damnation
for his soule, malediction for his heires, &amp;
law for his children.
               Money and the loue thereof maketh a wretched
man dwell in a house, whose chambers
are full of cobwebbes; the dores vnhindged;
the windowes cleft; the locks
decaied; the floers vneuen &amp; ful of holes;
the chaires broken; the chimneyes fallen
downe: that it is rather a house for hogs,
or horse, or kyne, then for men.
            
            
               
               Negligence.
               Much blame I àoe procure, and reason too.
               Best doe I liue, when I doe men vndoe.
               NEgligence keepeth preferment backe,
for many a man looseth the office due
vnto him of course, for want of diligence
to aetend the same: thus is the tide lost for
not taking the time, and the day lost
when a man angles wiihout fitte implements,
he shall neither catch fish nor frogs.
               Negligence is the cause that water, as
weake as it is, throwes downe whole
cities if it bee not preuented, and the Sea
in her ouerflowings drowneth whole
countreys.
               Negligence dares not plough the ground,
because the earth seems duskey, and so hee
supposeth it cannot bring forth daintie colours.
               Negligence is the only enemie to good huswiuery,
and the onely ouerthrowe of good
house-keeping: for as diligence is the
foundation of hospitalitie; so is negligence

of pe

                  urie and beggerie.
               Negligence is the cause that the horse is ill
dressed, the cattle vnfed, the husbandrie
backward, the vineyard barren, the season
ill sowen, the corne as ill gathered, as ill
growne, the meale mustie, the bread moldie,
the mault full of mice-turdes, and
greene for want of turning, the drink dead
as soone as it is made, the creame thin, the
butter nastie or none, the cheese full of
eyes and as hard as a horne, in a word: that
no worke is well done, no foode wholesome,
no life long.
               Negligence cares not, how much is spent,
how little is reserued, who eates the best
meat first, nor when prouision is prepared.
               Negligence of a sleeping sentinell, of the
watch in a campe, the court of guard in a
citie: causeth the ouerthrowe of the Army,
the surprising of the citie, and the spoyle of
a whole countrey.
               Negligence amongst Mariners runneth the
shippe on shelfes and sandes, leaueth the
leakes vnstopped, entangleth the tackling,
letteth the rudder loose, suffereth the ship
to runne at randome, and at last, is cause
that all is lost.
               
                  
Negligence seeldome shutteth the doore,
brusheth the apparell, fouldeth vp the linnen,
maketh the vessell handsome, clenseth
the garners, sweetneth the chambers, keepeth
any good orders, or maketh any good
manners.
               Negligence is a maruailous enemie to Princes
pallaces and profits, whose many officers
might and would better husband
their businesse, if either they were to mannage
their owne affaires, or did tast of the
wants in priuate houses.
               Negligence is the onely aduersarie to all

scratched the windowes, brake the glasses,

               No-body came to rob a man that nothing

               No-body telleth strange newes, inuenteth

                  rture is the mistresse of ciuilitie, and adorneth
all Common-wealths with that
maiestie, wherein Princes maintaine their
estates: for though Kings by nature haue
diuers prerogatiues, which breede obedience
in their subiects: yet doth nurture so
sweeten their nature by sweetnesse, that it
allures mens loue much more, and so there
is pleasure and honour vnited together.

                  curtesie, an officer comlines, a Iudge
vprightnesse, a Courtier hansomnesse, a
Citizen cleanlinesse, a Merchant finenesse,

a countriman sobernesse, and a Scholler ciuilitie.
               Nurture keepeth a great Lady from pride,
an inferiour from nicenesse, a Gentlewoman
from rudenesse, a mistresse from coynesse,
a dame from stoutenes, a good wife
from sluttishnesse, a Damosell from rudenesse,
a child from boldnesse, and a woman
in generall from vnwomanhood.
               Nurture instructeth a father to loue, and yet
correct: a child to obey, a maister to command,
a seruant to stand in awe, a husband
to begentle, a wife to respect, a house-keeper
to prouide, the household to saue, a
kinseman to obserue, and a friend to endure.
               Nurture which teacheth the true and easie
disposition of worldly wealth, maketh it a
pleasure, which otherwise breedes trouble
and perplexitie to the vnskilfull and vnworthy
owner; for if we knowe not how
to dispose of our goods, when God doeth
send them, we are vnworthy of them: and
how can wee truely be saide to be wise or
wealthy men, if we knowe not, or doe not
make vse accordingly of our wealth by discretion,
and condition of our calling.
               
                  
Nurture teacheth a schoole of good man-manners:
to salute our betters with reuerence,
our equall with loue, our inferior
in curtesie, to speake orderly, to giue the
wall, not to be angry without a cause: and
when there is cause to moderate the same:
to looke cheerefully, to bee apparrelled
cleanly, to goe soberly, to liue handsomly,
to conuerse without offence, to entertaine
with cheerefulnesse, and to dismisse
with freed liues.
               Nurture purchaseth good report, when
rudenesse and inciuilitie keepe a man from
respect: nay, make conuersation tedious
and odious to all men.
               Nurture is such a iewell in a nation: that all
others, where it is not; are called barbarous,
for lacke of ciuilitie, besides the
beastlinesse of conditions, eate one another
in necessitie, or rather wantonly or
wilfully only in sauage inhumanitie, without
necessitie.
               Nurture is a handsome commendation, and
so farre from flattery, that when we say: he
is a well mannered man, we meane: there
is a great deale more to bee spoken in his
commendations then we haue yet vttered;

whereas in all other praises we may quickly
exceed, and incurre suspition of hypocrisie
or flattery.
               Nurture teacheth vs to deale gently with
women, how euer men may be answered
with ruder tearmes, and manly contradictions.
               Nurture and ciuility are in a manner all one:
for good manners is the ende and scope of
their iourney, and euery man must bee a
scholler in that schoole, or else he shall neuer
be preferd to vertues accademy.
            
            
               Oeconomick.
               Who keepes an house, and knows not me, he shal,
               Not keepe it so, but it with him must fal.
               OEconomick in one briefe definition
teacheth all good rules of house-keeping,
and orderly gouerning of a family:
yet there bee some house-keepers, which
keepe as ill houses as they doe ill orders;
as the worme and mole that dwell in darknesse,
the thiefe and cutpursse in a dungeon,
the strumpet and vagabond in Bridewell,

the matchiauilian and murtherer in
Hell.
               Oeconomick maketh mariage the first degree,
and foundation of a familie: for as a
shippe cannot be gouerned without a rudder;
so cannot a house be ordered without
an ouerseer, which must needes bee man
and wife, subordinate one to the other: he
to play the good husband abroad, and she
the good housewife at home, and both to
consent in a sweete harmoney of mutuall
helpe to maintaine their familie.
               Oeconomick hath great necessity and neere
affinitie with nurture and ciuilitie, whereby
the wife must haue grauitie in speech
and action: wisedome in gouerning, patience
in suffring her husband, loue to bring
vppe her children, affabilitie to conuersing,
diligence to lay vppe and saue, and
friendlinesse in entertaining, and dismissing
neighbours and friendes when they
come.
               Oeconomick teacheth the maried man to
be reposed in speech; milde of conuersation;
faithfull wherein hee is trusted; wise
wherein hee giueth counsell; carefull for
the prouision of his house; diligent in ordering

his goods; suffering in the importunities
of his wife; and carefull in bringing
vp his children, maidens, and men.
               Oeconomick warneth, that men &amp; women
too young attempt not mariage or houskeeping,
lest their wiues are broken and
spoiled in their childbedde; their strength
weakned; their children multiplied; their
patrimony consumed; ielousie inflamed;
honesty and honor stained; the houshold
vnprouided; the substance consumed; &amp;
the man and wife finally seperated, after
long discontent, and great want.
               Oeconomick must first of all prouide for necessity,
and then preuent prodigality: for
after money is gone, and wants are come,
it will be too late to spare, when the barrell
is at the bottom.
               Oeconomick is opposed &amp; incumbred with
manyu inconueniences in maried folkes,
wherein if fortune cannot be preuented,
wisedome must mittigate the extremitie;
as commonly, a milde and modest maiden
is a poore one; a rich one proud of her
dowrie; a faire one of her beautie, and is
to be watched; a foule one is nastie, and
is to bee loathed; a wise and comely, is

both wilful and costly; a semster, a singer,
or dauncer, and no housekeeper; a huswife
irksome and imperious; and an honest
one iealous. Besides, if thou make
thy wife tarry at home, she will complain;
if she walke at libertie, the neighbours wil
talke of thee; if thou chide, shee will be
sullen and dumbe; if thou be silent, nothing
shall be heard for her chime; if she
haue the laying out, the stocke goeth to
wrack; if thou dispose thy owne money,
she scorns to come for euery peny; if thou
keepe thy house, thou art suspicious; if
thou tarry abroad, thou art vicious; if she
be trim, shee must abroad to be seene; if
she be but in ordinary fashion, thou art a
base minded miserable man: and so may I
goe infinitely on the inconueniences and
crosses, that are incident to housekeepers
and maried folkes.
               Oeconomick is blessed, when the wife is
modest; a housekeeper, no babbler; not
fretting, fuming, nor of any ill condition:
for the impudent, prating, angry, scolding
and fighting woman, maketh her husband
either a sheepe or a lyon; discrediteth her
kin; is blamed of her friends; hated of her

seruants; slouted &amp; auoyded of her neighbours.
               Oeconomick giueth warning that the husbands
be not rigorous, especially vvhen
they be new maried to their wiues: for as
the wife is the honour and happiness of her
husband in respect of her chastitie: so the
husband is the hell of his wife, in regard of
his cruelty.
               Oeconomick giueth warning, that the husbands
be not ouer ielous: for how-euer a
man may sometimes shut the dores, remoue
his wife from the window, bar her
going abroad, and detaine her from suspitious
company; yet must he bring this
to passe with great skill, and shew, that he
hath alwaies more faith in her liberty,
then in his owne restraint or obseruant
eye.
               Oeconomick giueth warning, that though
there happen vnkindnesse betweene man
&amp; wife, yet not to impart it to their neighbours,
nor giue them cause of whispering;
lest from thence it run ouer all the towne,
and expose them both to derision.
               Oeconomick teacheth husbands to prouide
things necessary for all domesticall

occasions, as to feed &amp; cloth their wiues,
and their children, and to giue them good
education, to pay their seruants, &amp; to moderate
their expences, to cast abrode for
their liuings, to be skilfull in bargainings,
to get their goods honestly, to deale with
all men equally, and vpon occasion to giue
liberally; and in a word, to dispatch all
affaires without dores. The office of
wiues, is to keepe their houses, to gather
and saue the goods, not to spend vainely,
or to be too talkatiue with euery bodie, to

                     〈◊〉
                   their words and actions and clothes
with modestie, to oder all things within,
with discreet frugalitie, and matron-like
to gouerne her family; and to demaund
nothing ouer-costly for her degree.
               Oeconomick instructeth the husbands, that
they bring no suspicious person to their
houses; and the women not to be ouer

                     〈◊〉
                   with any man, though a neere

                     〈◊〉
                  .
               Oeconomick causeth the women to sowe
with the needle, worke at the distaffe, spin

                     〈◊〉
                   rock, play the cooke, take heed of

                     〈◊〉
                  , as the onely enemy to chastitie, to

                     〈◊〉
                   about euen with her head vndrest, &amp;

her coats tuckt vp, her armes bare, and
feet without slippers, chyding the maides,
calling vp the seruants, and dressing the
children: feeding the chickens, making
the cheese, setting ouer the pot, tunning
the beere, turning the mault; and so orderly
along to euery other necessarie
thing.
               Oeconomick te
                     •
                  cheth inferior women to
make their owne partlets; to wash their
clothes, to aire the wheat, to sift the meale,
to make the bread, to set on the pot, and
to dispatch euery meaner office in due order
and place.
               Oeconomick more reioceth the husband to
see his wife working on the Saturday,
then gossipping on the Sunday: but there
can be no good husbandry, or housekeeping
for familie, nor good example for the
neighbourhood or vicinity, nor commendation
for the childrē, when the wife goes
to bedde at midnight, riseth next day at
a leuen, goes to dinner at twelue, sleepeth
or talketh all the afternoone till supper
time, spends much time in trimming her
chambers, and neuer descendeth downe
staires to looke to the inferior roomes.

When the Husband giueth not the woman
proportionable money to prouide for
her family, but hanteth the tauerne, looks
neither to maid nor man, tilleth not his
ground in due season, and is negligent in
all his affaires within and without dores.
            
            
               Office and officers.
               The good, the bad, the high, the lowe I serue;
               But still the vncorrupt doth best deserue.
               OFfices that are wel gotten, make good
magistrates to releeue the widow and
fatherlesse: but hee that oppresseth them,
is both vnworthy of any office, and to be
punished for example of iniustice to others
in like place.
               Offices obtained by corruption, make the
prosperity and posterity that get them vnhappy,
because euil is vnpunished, malice
couered, iustice hindred, vice nourished,
and the inward enemies of our soules so
strengthned against the vertues or our
mindes, that they are either so weakened
that they cannot shew forth their efficacy,

or so vtterly banished, that they sildome
returne to their natiue country.
               Offices are commonly a way for the Prince
to know the condition of the subiects: for
as the touchstone trieth currant and counterfet
mettals: so doth the integritie or
iniquitie vsed in offices, try the disposition
of magistrates; and by them, the opinion
and conuersation of the subiect. For good
Princes make good lawes; good lawes
raise good magistrates; good magistrates
ouer-see good executions; and good execution
detaineth the inferior sort in obedience
and loyaltie to supreame authoritie;
in loue to the country, in due respect
to their betters, curtesie to equalls, humanitie
toward inferiors, and charitie to all
of all sorts.
               Offices are still subiect to this error; that
such as should obtaine them by order of
place, are commonly shut out by fauour or
reward: insomuch that Princes cannot
sometime eate or sleepe in quiet for such
suters, as are euer begging and buzzing in
their eares. Which makes me remember
a story of Alphonsus King of Naples; who
being at supper, and hauing on either hand

some or other to whisper in his eare about
the obtaining some office of honourable
or profitable place, suddenly with a loude
voyce cryed out; O how happy are the
very asses, that trauaile with their burthens:
for when they are at their bait, their
maisters let them feede quietly, which you
see Kings cannot doe.
               Officers ought to looke into causes, not persons:
that power may not oppresse misery,
nor pitie hinder iustice to the hurt of
any.
               Officers and Magistrates are to knowe, that
mercy without remisnesse, seueritie without
tyranny, zeale without hypocrisie,
iustice without extremitie, and pitie without
partialitie, not onely conserue Common-wealths,
but augment the reputation
of particular offices.
               Offices abused by wicked magistrates,
make the rich murmure, the poore cry out,
the widowe wring her handes, the orphan
shed teares, the souldier mutiney, the scho
                  
                     •
                  er
complaine, and all sortes repine.
               Officers that bee good may bee subiect to
some imperfections: and then knowing
their infirmities, they must rather with an

humble lenity draw others from their errors,
then with a rough tyrannie make
them destitute of hopes, and more dissolute
in manners.
               Officers that are wise, are the pillers of
State; as a gracious Prince is the ioy of
his subiects.
               Officers that are wicked, sometimes do wel
to gaine fame; like healing witches, that
would be thought charitable, and do that
they doe, meerly by delusion, to obtaine
an honest reputation.
               Officers corrupted, haue commonly euill
eyes; dissembling tongues; hypocriticall
harts; open hands; &amp; close feet. For they
will sit still for their owne profits, but sildome
take paines to help others.
               Officers thinking of nothing but gaine, forget
to enioy what they haue already got
with labour and paine.
               Offices obtained by money, and not to be
continued long in probabilitie, make the
possessors the more greedy to enrich
themselues.
               Offices bestowed by Princes in court, against
ancient custome, and commendable
order, make the Courtiers to murmur:

saying, The Prince doth not consider;
the Councell doth not dispatch; the
Paymasters delay; the Parasites beare
sway; the Bishops be not residents; the
Secretaries haue priuate pensions; Iustices
take bribes; the officers compound for
duties; the gentlemen play the vnthri
                     •
                  ts;
the husbandmen that drudge for all, are
beggers.
               Officers ought to be thankfull to God, and
pittifull to men: for God hateth the sinne
of ingratitude: &amp; the poore doth reuenge
iniuries with teares.
               Officers in the administration of iustice, are
gouerned by learning and wisedome: for
learning, to giue sentence; &amp; prudence, to
gouerne; both which are two such properties,
as many desire, but few obtaine.
               Offices amongst martiall men are bestowed
by order of discipline, and knowledge in
the warres: otherwise shall the vnexperienced
hazard the businesse in hand, and
giue the whole Campe cause to repine and
repent. Yet many times the fauor of Generals
may be iustifiable in the preferment
of younger souldiers, who may be of greater
merit then their elders.
               
                  
Officers that get to preferment with intent
of priuat profit, are not onely voyde of
good counsell, but continue therein to
their greater scandall; the dishonour of
the bestower; the infamy of the procurer;
the feare of good men, and fall of good
order.
            
            
               Order.
               The heauen's, without me, would confused rest,
               But with me, bell may well receiue the blest.
               ORder framed the world,

times; limited the seas with banks
and bounds; and fet an orderly course in
all creatures. Where onely Hell is full of
confusions, horrours, and vtter disorders.
               Order but a little neglected, makes a small
errour to growe greater: as a little spark
ill raked vp, kindles a great fire; and a little

foule &amp; filthy water, marres the whol

his crafts master.
               Order teacheth vs, that an ill fauoured face,
a wicked nature, a horrible life, and execrable
death, doe commonly accompany
one another. The first is vgly, the second
hatefull, the third fearefull, and the fourth
damnable.
               Order teacheth the Iudge to summon the
parties in question, to appoint a day of
hearing, to giue eare to both sides, to examine
the particulars, to certifie the iurors,
to open the truth, to receiue the verdict,
and giue the sentence. For as a carpenter
by his axe and rule squareth and
proportioneth his timber: so in deciding
of causes, impertinent points are to be pared,
ambiguities sifted, shyfts examined,
the truth discouered, and so the cause orderly
and truly decided.
               Order maketh the eye, though neuer so little,
see many things, and that a far off, one
after another.
               Order setteleth the maiestie of a Kings palace,
and quieteth the ambitious spirits of
noble men; who from order and princely

direction, knowe how to take their place
without repining: whereas if the offices in
diuers mens hands are disposed without
orderly rules, there must needs be vnorderly
proceedings in the duties that belong
to their seuerall places.
               Order in proceeding keepeth a hote braine
from running into any extreame, vvhereby
the whole work may bee ouerthrown.
Whereas the minde is setled, the body accommodated,
the hand ruled, the worke
perfected, the workman commended.
               Order marshalleth a feast, appointeth the
banquet, disheth the meat, placeth the dishes,
setteth the guests, soundeth the musick,
and sets euery ones teeth on worke in
his seuerall rank.
               Order maketh the Physition famous, by
preparing the body both for the purge &amp;
the vomit, to cast the cruditie out, &amp; then
setling the stomack.
               Order altred in nature distempers the body,
but peruerted in vertue damneth the
soule.
               Order is disturbed, when nature is peruerted;
as when Sommer is cold, or Winter
hote; so that the seasons of the yeere fall

out so contrary, that they are pleasant or
profitable to no body.
               Order climbs vp the mountaine with labor,
but teacheth you to come downe againe
with discretion and leisure.
               Order teacheth the eyes to direct the feet,
the hands to feede the mouth, the mouth
to fill the belly, the belly to satisfie the entrailes,
and euery part to assist one another
in due time and season.
            
            
               Oathes.
               Swearing contents no sense; then what a diuell
               Is man to doe so ill for nought but euill?
               OAthes haue been of great antiquitie:
for euen heathen Princes made their
contracts vpon the assurance of oathes; as
you may read betweene Abimelech and
Abraham, who durst not offend God in
the breach of the same.
               Oathes haue assured damnation to the wicked:
for God did sweare in his wrath, that
they should not enter into his rest.
               Oathes must not be made but by the name

of God, and then are they as dangerous to
be broken, as if you should rebell against
him: so then as you vvould auoide the
name of traytor toward an earthly Prince,
you must take heed of the condemnation
of rebel against the Prince of all Princes.
Oathes were foreseene by Gode himselfe to
come to corruption, and growe to abuse:
therefore was the law proclaimed, to detaine
vs in obediēce; to limit our tongues,
to curbe our vanitie; to suppresse our idle
talke; to condemne our prophanation;
and aboue all to limit vs, how farre wee
might sweare, and must be silent.
               Oathes are many times abused, euen to the
eating them vp; as a man will sweare by
the bread, and eate it; by the drinke, and
drinke it: but when hee comes to the candle,
he will refuse it.
               Oathes are very forcible amongst most vnciuell
people: for in Ireland to sweare by
their hand, their fathers hand, their Lords
hand, by Oneales hand, &amp; such like, are as
forcible, as if they called heauen and earth
to witnesse.
               Oathes taken in vaine, are the more to bee
condemned; because of the greatnesse of

the sinne, and the easinesse to auoide it: for
of all other sins the naturall man can yeeld
you a reason, or if you will an excuse, except
swearing: which being voluntary,
and not restrained, is the more to be condemned,
because of the presumption, and
vnnecessary transgression.
               Oathes vnnecessary are in themselues vnlawfull,
but in their violation abominable:
so that to so sweare is wicked, but to forsweare
damnable.
               Oathes are meerely accoustomary wickednes,
or wicked coustome, and thereby odious,
euen to the naturall and ciuill honest
man.
               Oathes haue tied all men to obseruation: yet
Euripides hath a saying, that in cases of
loue and soueraingtie an oath is not to bee
trusted, nor man to bee beleeued: for so
sonnes haue ouerreached their fathers, and
depriued them both of libertie and of life.
Oathes are the more dangerous, by how
much God is most holy, and cannot endure
to haue his name vnhallowed at any
time, much lesse by ordinary and audacious
custome.
               Oathes are the more fearefull, by how much

the casue is most friuolous: for you shall
heare euen vagabonds, roagues, and boies
sweare with horrible libertie for trifels,
and slender occasions: yea in their ordinary
discourses as they goe in the streetes,
and walke in the fieldes.
               Oathes and drunkennesse doe commonly
goe together, and being fearefully vnited,
make vp the diuels chaine to tie vs to damnation.
               Oathes are monstrous in a woman, in whom
impudency ioyned with prophanation
makes them the more odious and loathsome.
               Oathes doe commonly depend vpon gaming,
wherein vnthriftines is ioyned with
perdition: for with the losse of time, followes
the losse of money, the losse of reputation,
the losse of honesty, the losse of
faith: and finally of saluation.
            
            
               
               Pleasure.
               I am the net of Hell, except you looke
               For quicke preuention, in true vertues booke.
               PLeasures passe away with as great vanitie,
as there be passions: and as many men
as liue in the world, haue their seuerall
pleasures to content their mindes, and recreate
their bodies.
               Pleasures hinder our heauenly exercises, and
are mayne enemies to contemplatiue studies.
               Pleasures of the world should not be so eagerly
pursued by men, because they are
transitory and vaine: but the ioyes of heauen
are euer to be thought vpon, because
they are euerlasting.
               Pleasures delight the eyes with delicate obiects,
the eares with musicall harmonie the
heart with ioy of health, and the soule with
the louely face of vertue.
               Pleasure is a meere net of the diuell to catch
a man that is idle: but honest exercise preserues
the body, sets the minde on worke

in some profitable study, wherein as
                     •
                  uredly
makes the labour easie, and the attemptes
runne on with pleasure and felicitie.
               Pleasure must not so abuse vs, as to spend
the precious treasure of time so vnprofitably,
which we ought to imploy: first, to the
benefit of our soules: secondly, for the augmentation
and honour of our estates: and
fourthly, for the reputation and credite of
our persons: fifthly, for the helpe and comfort
of our neighbour.
               Pleasures are dangerous in their extremities:
yet is moderate mirth a recreation of
body and minde; musicke a diuine inuention,
hunting a martial imitation, hawking
a Princely pasttime, riding manly and
gracefull contentment, and if skilfully performed,
an honourable ornament: and infinite
such like exercises followed in their
fit and seasonable times, increase health
and strength and agilitie in mens bodies,
delight in their minds and relish and adapt
both to better businesse.
               Pleasure hath two great enemies; an ouer
eager desire, and continuall feare: for what
we desire to enioy, we are affraid to loose.
Pleasure of hunting consisteth in three chaces

the Deer, Fox, and Hare: but sinne hath
the eescore times three, which to hunt from
our soules is happines to our selues, &amp; heauenly
ioy to the holy Angels.
               Pleasure is but a further degree of contentment:
whence a willing trauaile is more
pleasant then a forced ease.
               Pleasure hurteth the flesh more then exercise,
as pride enuenometh the spirit aboue
other more painfull sinnes.
               Pleasure breedes a lamentable sorrow: or a
dangerous mutiney, when the misery of
a whole common-welth, breeds the mirth
of a few.
               Pleasure is wretched that breedeth sorrow,
but it is a blessed sorrow that bringeth ioy.
Pleasure of riches in Christian mindes consisteth
in commendable spending, not in
couetous hoording: for if the poore starue,
the neighbour be needy, the orphane complaine,
and the widowe shed teares; what
pleasure can it bee to thee to haue many
bagges lying by thee, and see them complaine
and pine away in their necessitie.
            
            
               
               Poetry.
               I that doe make life ouer death to vaunt,
               Can hardly liue, without contempt, and want.
               Poetry was gratious, when Salomō
                   made
a loue song, and with spirituall influence
described heauenly secretes as Dauid sung
his Psalmes, and draue away the diuell by
the sound of his Harpe.
               Poetry in his vse is an admirable vertue, and
a rauishing contentment: For it raiseth the
honour of renowne, illustrateth the actions
of famous men, eterniseth the memory of
merit, and quickeneth the very spirit of the
reader to the same prosecutions: againe it
sendeth vice to hell, maketh miquitie a
monster, keepeth vs from sinne for feare of
shame, and compareth the odiousnesse of
impiety to deepe pits, whence it is more
easier to keepe ones selfe from falling in,
then once fallen to come out againe.
               Poetry in his abuse is a meere excrement of
an idle frency, a drunken fury, a scorne of
wise men, a popular iollitie, a common

may-game, a storehouse for balladmongers,
an lnne for rimers, and an idle and vnprofitable
pastime: liuing in pouertie, and
dying in contempt.
               Poetry animated by musicke are dangerous
companions amongst working spirits, and
barbarous nations: witnesse the bardes
and rimers of Ireland, and Wales, whose Siren
songs haue excited such hellish treasons,
and horrible tumults.
               Poetry and pouertie march hand in hand
commonly, though at first they scorned to
take reward: yet at last it grewe so common,
that without reward they could not
liue by the occupation.
               Poetry now adayes marcheth with impudency,
for whereas ancient poesie studied
to make vertue famous, the moderne endeuours
to make vice glorious: esteeming
honesty an idle word, and a simple ornament:
but ribaldry a witty mirth and
sweete contentment.
               Poetry must take vigor and spirit from Bacchu
                        •
                     
                  
company, and as a fainting stomach
is setled and refreshed with some cordiall
receite, so a wearied wit is refreshed with
a little wine, and the verses slip more easily

out, being washed ouer with that pleasant
and liuely liquor.
               Poetry seasoned with piety and learning is
a Iewell of estimation: but corrupted with
fancy and scurrilitie a counterfeit Iem, and
the worst excrement and drosse of pure
vnderstanding.
            
            
               Pouertie.
               Although I be not ill, yet doe I make,
               Men shund (like 
                     •
                  iuels) for their euils sake.
               Pouertie is subiect to many miseries: yet
not to bee scorned, lest haughty pride
make a man worse then humble pouertie.
Pouertie is borne with patience, when felicitie
is corrupted by plentie, and he which
is armed with vertue, can endure miserie,
when, he which is fraughted with vices, can
not moderate prosperitie.
               Pouertie may come by worldly troubles,
and as you call it, vnfortunate mischances:
but wretched is that wealth, which is gotten
by the wofull wracke of others.
               Pouertie that comes by prodigalitie, is rather

to be derided with scorn, then relieued
by pitie: and meriteth so much the more
reproch, by how much the more intemperately
the prodigall liued in his former
iollitie.
               Pouertie will try the honesty of disposition,
and patience the discretion of vnderstanding.
               Peuertie hath an inward griefe, yet sometimes
is, endured with constancy, but villancy
is hard to bee concealed by the authors,
or indured of others.
               Pouerty maketh men rob the rich, and to
excuse it by necessity: but the rich that
robbe the poore, haue no excuse for
their auarice and tyranny.
               Pouerty triumphs to see the miserable diuision
of rich mens goods. For one part is
giuen to flatterers, another to Lawyers, a
third to Physitians, a fourth to vnthrifts,
and the last to funeralls: so that the wicked
haue his goods, his children his infamy,
the graue his body, the wormes his
flesh, and the diuell his soule: from most
of which pouerty is exempted.
               Pouerty comes by fruitlesse paines: for hee
that plowes the seas, or sowes the sands,

may haue his seede well washt, and a cold
haruest for his lost labours and vnprofitable
paies.
               Pouertie is no vice: yet a wofull inconuenience,
for friendes forsake vs in our miseries,
as crowes leaue the fleshlesse carkasses,
that are eaten vp to skinne and bones.
               Pouertie is a pitifull spectacle, and more miserable
then a mo
                     •
                  ster: for men giue mony
to see nouelties, but runne away from
poore mens complaints and necessities, as
from infectious leprosies or ruinous wals.
               Pouertie is subiect to so many inconueniencies,
to be suffered of mightier men then
themselues, that poore men may not think
on reuenge of their former wrongs, but
rather on defence from further iniuries
and mischiefes: as in this example appeares.
A poore countrey man hauing lost
a calfe, made a vowe to Iupiter to sacrifice
vnto him a lambe, if he would doe him the
grace to shew him the thiefe that had stollen
it: whereupon looking vp and downe,
he saw a Lion feeding on the same; whereat
much more affrighted, hee lift vppe his
hands a new to heauen, and cried: O god,
whereas I promised thee a lambe to helpe

me to finde the thiefe that stole my calfe,
I will now being found, such as he is, giue
thee a bull to deliuer me out of his clawes,
               Pouertie is troublesome in it selfe: but when
other mischifes are added, it is much
more grieuous and irksome. For when a
poore man had a shrewe to his wife: one
day in a fury he had happned to anger her,
and shee for want of her will hanged her
selfe on a figge-tree in his garden; at the
sigth whereof much amazed, hee ranne to
his neighbours being as poore as himselfe,
and wept extreamely: but at last
brought them to the spectacle, which they
perceiuing asked, why he was so foolish to
weepe, when they would faine haue a graft
of the same tree to set in their owne gardens.
               Pouertie is a good helpe to knowledge: for
Diogenes was wont to say, that a Phylosopher
could not study without an emptie
belley, thinne diet, want of money, poore
apparell, and a good wit; yea, Phylosophy
perswaded to pouertie, and maintained all
the principels of the scorne of wealth and
prosperitie.
               Pouertie is a part of the play which we acte

in this world, &amp; as Epictetes said: if the master
of a Comedy can adapt the dispositions
of his boyes to such seuerall parts, as
shall well befit their natures and inclinations,
to grace the enterlude; so that sometimes
a beggers sonne shall play the King,
and a Gentlemans a vagabond and rogue:
shall not the God of heauen dispose of his
creatures, as best befitteth their abilities,
either to try their moderation in prosperitie,
or patience in aduersitie? since
without controuersie, it is onely God that
permitteth pouertie as a triall or chastisement,
or else sendeth it as a plague or punishment.
               Pouertie bursteth foorth into some extreamities,
which may be pardoned: but insolent
and causelesse mutineys are not to bee
endured.
               Pouertie and riches haue denominations
and effects contrary to themselues in some
persons: for the widowe was rich in her
mite, when the rich were poore in their
plentie.
               Pouertie is the greatest profession in the
world; for all men are beggers from the
richest to the meanest, for some begge one

of another, but all of God.
               Pouertie is miserable, if it ouercome patience:
as wealth is wicked if it breed pride.
Pouertie in a good scholler is as pitifull a
spectacle, as a rich foole is a scornful.
               Pouerty comes through a licentious wife,
pilsering seruants, vnthrifty children, cont
                     •
                  tious
neighbors, &amp; combersom friends.
               Pouertie followes a carelesse spender, as a
long sicknesse brings the body to a consumption.
               Pouertie is fittest for a begger and a godly
life: yet many honest men would not aime
at such a marke, nor walke in such a pilgrimage.
               Pouertie hath more reliefe by the hand, then
the tongue, as God is more honoured
with the heart, then the lippe.
               Pouertie makes hunger a good sawce, but
too much takes away the stomach.
               Pouertie without redresse, is like a naked
body without a raiment: and both finde
but cold comfort in compassionate words;
For a word without a substance, is like a
small light, that maketh the little yeelde a
great shadow.
            
            
               
               Player.
               I should be vertuous, sith to vice I act:
               As makes both me, and others loath the fact.
               PLaier was not taken in ill part at the first
but counted both a glory and a cōmendation:
for as an Orator was most forcible
in his ellocution; so was an actor in his gesture
and personated action.
               Player and Historian were gracious in all
Common-welths: for as their Tragedies
and Comedies were seeldome vsed; so
when they were vsed, it serued for honourable
purpose: either for the glory of a
Court, the priuate pleasure of a Prince, the
gracing of triumphs, the famosing of great
Captaines, or the personating some particular
humors.
               Plaier was euer the life of dead poesie, and
in those times, that Philosophy taught vs
morall precepts, these acted the same in
publicke showes: so that vice was made
odious, vertue set on a throne of immitaon,
punishment warranted to the wicked,
reward afforded to well deseruers, fathers
prouoked to prouident loue, children
taught obedience, and all sorts seuerally
instructed in their seuerall callings.
               Player is now a name of contempt, for times

corrupt men with vice, and vice is growne
to a height of gouernment: so that whereas
before men were affraid to offend, they
now thinke it a disgrace to bee honest:
whence the eie must be satisfied with vanitie,
the care with bawdery, 
                     •
                   the hand with
obscenitie, the heart with lust, the feete
with wandrings, and the whole body and
soule with pollutions: in all which Players
are principall actors.
               Players, Poets, and Parasites doe now in a
manner ioyne hands, and as Lucifer fell
from heauen through pride: these haue
fallen from credit through folly: so that to
chast eares they are as odious, as filthy pictures
are offensiue to modest eyes.
               Players haue by communitie mared their
owne markets: for as vertue is the better
by enlargement and communication,
so is vice the worse by disimulation and
common infusion of it's contagious poyson.
               Players are discredited in the very subiect
of their profession, which is onely scratching
the itching humours of scabbed minds
with pleasing content and prophane iests,
and how can he be well reputed, that employes

all his time in vanity and lies, counterfeting
and practising nothing else.
               Player is affraid of the plague, as much as a
cowherd of a musket: for as deth is formidable
to the one, so is pouertie and wants
to the other.
               Player is affraid of the statute, for if he haue
no better supportation then his profession,
he is neither admitted in publicke, nor if
hee bee a roamer dares iustifie himselfe in
priuate, being a flat roague by the statute.
               Plaiers practises can hardly be warranted in
Religion: for a man to put on womans apparell,
and a woman a mans, is plaine prohibition;
I speake not of execrable oathes,
artificiall lyes, discoueries of cousenage,
scurrulus words, obscene discourses, corrupt
courtings, licentious motions, lasciuious
actions, and lewde iesture s: forall
these are incident to other men, but here
is the difference: in these they come by
imperfection, in them by profession.
               Player is a great spender, and indeed may
resemble strumpets, who get their money
filthily, and spend it profusely.
               Player is much out of countenance, if fooles
doe not laugh at them, boyes clappe their

hands, pesants ope their throates, and the
rude raskal rabble cry excellent, excellent:
the knaues haue acted their parts in print.
               Player hath many times, many excellent
qualities: as dancing, actiuitie, musicke,
song, elloqution, abilitie of body, memory,
vigilancy, skill of weapon, pregnancy of
wit, and such like: in all which hee resembleth
an exceellnt spring of water, which
growes the more sweeter, and the more
plentifull by the often drawing out of it:
so are all these the more perfect and plausible
by the often practise.
               Player is at the first very bashfull, as strucken
with a maze at the multitude, which
being of various dispositions, will censure
him accordingly: but custome maketh
perfectnesse, and emboldeneth him sometimes
to be shamelesse.
               Player must take heede of wrested and enforced
action: for if there be not a facility
in his deliuerance, and as it were a naturall
dexteritie, it must needes sound harsh to
the auditour, and procure his distast and
displeasure.
               Player is like a garment which the Tailor
maketh at the direction of the owner: so

they frame their action, at the disposing
of the Poet: so that in trueth they are reciprocall
helpes to one another; for the
one writes for money, and the other plaies
for money, &amp; the spectator payes his money.
            
            
               Pride.
               I vsher nought but falls: but Angells fell
               Before mee; no, but with me, downe to hell.
               PRide is much abated, when a man thinketh
on his sinnes: as a Peacock puts
downe his taile, when hee beholdeth his
deformed feet.
               Pride in authoritie maketh pouerty looke
for misery: but wisedome abstaineth from
extremities, and maketh vertue gracious.
               Pride insulteth ouer miserie, and is for the
most part coupled with Malice and enuie:
so that when affliction doth most oppresse
his enemy, hee not onely reioyceth ouer
him, but helpeth to distresse him, till he be
vtterly ouerthrown.
               Prides wings transports vs, but to the

height of wickednes, and both flie with
vs vnto wretchednesse, or fall back againe
to pouerty and destruction. For they are
but slightly glewd, and quickly melted
with the heat of Gods heauy indignation.

                   following story: Benedetto
de Alb 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   of a friend of his
to be aduanced a Cardinall, came to Rome
of purpose to see him; 
                     〈◊〉
                   obseruing his
stately and proud manner of behauiour,
the next day he made him a mourning sute,
in which hee came againe to visit the Cardinall;
who demaunded, why hee was so
altred: Benedetro answered, for sorow to
see the death of humilitie, and the life of
pride in you.
               Pride is so dangerous a vice, that commonly
there is no worldly help for it: wherevpon
Alphonsus King of Naples, beeing
vpon a time demaunded his opinion touching
the benignity of nature; made this
answer; that nature had prouided a helpe
for all her imperfections: as for lechery,
mariage, or fasting: for hunger &amp; thirst,
meat and drink: for couetousnesse, spending:

for wrath, patience, and forbearance:
but for pride, he saw no helpe: so
that it was a thing not onely hurtful vnto
nature, but hatefull both to God &amp; man.
               Pride apparrels the wicked with costly raiment;
makes them thinke their speech
like the voice of Angels; and swallowes
the praise and popular applause of men
with greedinesse: but let them remember
that of Herode, who was eaten vp with
lice and wormes.
               Pride threw the bright starre Lucifer out of
heauen: therefore must not man in the
darknesse of the earth presume too high,
lest he fall into the like precipitation.
               Pride maketh the minde greedy of power,
and then can they neither abstaine from
things forbidden, nor containe themselues
within the compasse of moderation.
               Pride causeth a man, that hath the eyes of
his soule shut vp from the light of grace,
to mount vp so high vnto vanitie, that he
falls down head-long into hell: as a blind
kite, that hath her eyes 
                     •
                  eeled vp, beeing
thrown from the first, mounteth vp on high
so long as she can carry herselfe with her
wings, till at last beeing weary, shee falls

downe and dies.
               Pride is the enemy to grace, the scorne of
reason, and the absolute impediment of
further progresse in goodnesse and learning.
               Pride bred the fall of Angels, the mis
                     •
                  ry of
man, the curse of the earth, and the torment
of diuells.
               Pride bedecketh the body, deformeth the
soule, stores the Vsurers with mony, and
the prisons with mis
                     •
                  rie. For many a man
to go in braue apparrell, runnes ouer head
and eares in the Mercers bookes, til stumbling
at the heape of his debts, hee falls
headlong into a cold and comfortlesse,
poore and penurious prison.
               Pride made the Painters complection, the
fantasticks inuention, the rich mans ambition,
the fooles correction, and the beggers
conclusion.
               Pride, or a proud man in gay apparrell, is
like a prety virgin, who playeth the counterfet
Queene amongst other mayds; puts
on a sober and yet stately dem
                     •
                  anor, and
will all that day scarce speake, nor looke
vpon her fellowes; but at night when she
puts off her apparrell, then she bids them

all good night, and goeth home perhaps
to some poore cottage, from whence shee
came in the morning. So I say is it with a
proud man; who all the daies of his life
from the brauery of his purse ouerlooketh
all his poore friends and neighbors: but
at the night of his dayes, when he must be
stript out of his richest ragges, and is going
to his graue, thē perhaps hee bids them
all good night, when he is going not onely
to the earth, from whence hee came;
but it may be to hell, from whence he shal
neuer returne.
               Pride is vnprofitable for a Commonwelth,
when the superfluitie of one night serues
the necessity of many: and the disgrace of
a Common-wealth, when a man shal care
more to satisfie his owne vaine-glory, and
outward vanity, then respect the profit of
his country, the praise of vertue, the paterne
of humilite, the example of sobriety,
the times necessitie, the complaints of pouertie.
               Pride hinders charitie, endures no equalitie,
loues flattery, murmureth at superiors,
triumpheth ouer inferiors, and wil admit
of no humble thoughts.
               
                  
Pride robbeth the heart of wisedome, the
mind of vnderstanding, the spirit of grace,
and the soule of saluation.
               Pride, or a proud man that is cladde in colours,
like the Knight of the Rainebow, or
bedawbed in gold like the calfe of Horeb,
feeles neither the burthen of sinne, that
lyeth heauy on his soule, nor the weight of
a whole lordship, that hangeth heauy on
his shoulders.
               Pride ingrafted by nature, is somtimes tollerated
in a great estate: but if the same
party come to deiection, then doth pouertie
expose his pride to the greater hate and
contempt.
               Pride is many times augmented by honour,
as we say, Honors change manners: so that
a man otherwise well disposed, when hee
comes to preferment, not onely alters the
course of his life, but the qualitie of his
very soule.
               Pride without controuersie, is the diuells
hooke to pull sinners neerer to him: and
can catch a man a farre off without anie
other baite, then the hast of him, who of
his owne accord doth come too fast on.
            
            
               
               Profit.
               
                  Ianus they say had double face: but I
               Haue double hand and tongue to silch &amp; lie.
               PRofit is a kinde of witchcraft, &amp; draweth
so fast downward to the earth, that
we haue no leysure to looke towards heauen:
though it be lawfull to liue by honest
gaine, if couetousnesse carry vs not beyond
good conscience, through ignorance,
that carelesnesse of the world, is the
way to true happinesse.
               Profit maketh a churle thankfull: yet hee
that is onely gratefull in necessitie, deserueth
small praise, and lesse pitie in his penurie.
               Profit forgetteth former paines, and patience
worketh a passage through many
difficulties.
               Profit which commeth by seruants, maketh
them worthy of their wages: as a horse
that trauailes, is of his oates.
               Profit will quickly decay, if either a man
sell much and buy little; or buy much, and

sell little, or buy little, and sell nothing at
all: so that all men, which liue by profit,
must proportion their layings out to their
gettings at least.
               Profit maketh light ballances &amp; false measures,
&amp; both are an abhomination to the
Lord.
               Profit is the desire of many men, and losse
their griefe: but when their faith growes
to suspition, their loue is at the dore to be
gone.
               Profit many times comes in freely; as the
Bee brings her hony like a sweet seruant
to the hiue; and gathering from many
things, labours to enrich onely one: but
there is small profit to take from one, and
disperce amongst many.
               Profit is got by labour; and labour that
brings profit, is sweet to the patient: but
the impatience of a foole that wil not persist,
nor can stay to expect, loseth his profit,
and may leaue off his trade.
               Profit is vnlikely to rise to any great matter,
when the haruest is troubled with wet
wether: yet may a latter spring recompence
the losse of the former ill season.
Profit in a base trade may befoule the fist:

but the gaiue of briberie will deforme the
soule.
               Profit comes in with cheerefulnesse, when
a good haruest makes the Farmer feast his
neighbours; as faire wether and searoome
glads the fortunate Merchant &amp; Mariner,
and makes them spend frankly, when they
come home.
               Profit, which is honest, needes little cunning,
but true endeauours, and orderly
dealing.
            
            
               Quietnes.
               Wherein can honor, wealth, or pleasure thriue,
               If I their pleasure do not keepe aliue.
               QVietnes is the paradice of conscience,
where a man walkes merrily, when all
the world is in a hurly-burly.
               Quietnes of minde is setled with comfort,
when wee feare not the contrary; and are
so prouided against mischances, that when
they happen, they cannot disquiet vs.
               Quietnes makes sleepe like a sweet refreshing
showre to the senses, but slothfulnesse

dulls them like a glut of raine. On the
contrary, a setled melancholy makes way
to madnesse, if it be without rest or intermission
from continuall and intentiue cogitation.
               Quietnes of minde ioyned with quietnesse
of body, makes the estates of our liues
happy: whereas either body or mind disquieted,
all outward blessings are but smal
refrcshings.
               Quietnes maketh honor to shine with a luster,
which otherwise is farre inferior to
contented pouerty, and a setled mediocritie.
               Quietnes and rest must needs be had after
labour, or else, neither body nor mind can
endure.
               Quietnes and contentation of a Christian,
was first procured and proclaimed by
Christ: in saying that his yoake was sweet,
and his burthen easie; meaning to them,

                     〈◊〉
                   were a little exercised therein.
               Quietnes must needes be disturb'd in time
of generall troubles; and whosoeuer shal
then repine, is as kinde to his country, as
hee is wife that wil complaine, that drops
fall on him in a storme.
               
                  
Quietnes must not make her end to be idlenes,
for extreamities are alwaies vices:
but the end of rest and quietnes, must be
to enable mens bodies &amp; mindes to future
paines; as the Inne dooth rest, and refesh
the trauailer, that he may rise againe, and
goe further. So doe we vnbend bowes, to
bring them again to as strong a straine the
next time, lest continuall intention should
boow the bowe, or breake the string.
               Quietnes seasoneth &amp; sweetneth all worldly
blessings, which haue no true taste, but
in reposed mindes: otherwise, be they neuer
so great or so good, they are but bitter
sweets.
               Quietnes and feare, are like day and night
which cannot dwell together: they are incompatible
enemies, and expell each other.
A setled resolution to sustaine all
chances, shuts out all feares; and fearefull
apprehensions, and fainting expectations,
forestalls all couragious and constant resolutions.
            
            
               
               Reason.
               Wisedome I must confesse outstrips me still,
               Yet am I author both of good and ill.
               REason argues all matters in controuersie,
it prooues truth, and approues it, it
refutes falsehood, and refuseth it; it discernes
the good and iustifieth it; it reueales
the bad, and forbids it; whereby
the good is iustified, and the bad condemned.
               Reason is the ground of the law, which reasonable
men will therefore obey. But such
barbarous beasts as will not bee ruled by
reason, which was giuen to direct them,
must be ouer-ruled by law, which was
made to correct them.
               Reason hath two great enemies, wilfulnes,
and power; who by tyrannous ouer-bearing
all right and reason, doe incurre the
more terrible condemnation.
               Reason is much troubled with folly &amp; women;
the one cannot vnderstand her, the
other will not stand to her: for wee commonly

say, It is a womans reason; It is so,
because it is so: I will not doe this or that,
because I will not.
               Reason is quite casheird in loue and passion.
For the bold &amp; blind Louer (neither seeing,
nor fearing the many mischiefes may
follow him) hath his eyes &amp; his thoughts
onely on the face of his Mistresse. And the
fierie cholcrick companion, beeing caried
headlong with fury and madnesse in the
heat of his passion, neither heedes the
bloudy face of fearefull misfortune before
him, nor of bleake and pale repentance behind
him. Both loue and anger if they be
strong, raise vp a clowd of clustring spirits,
which cleane dazel and darken the
cleare reason of man, and peruert all wise,
orderly, and happy proceeding.
               Reason sanctified, maketh cōscience a good
schoole mistris, but when wit is wicked, &amp;
will peruerted, no order or goodnesse can
be expected.
               Reason animated by Religion hath a power
aboue nature; for if you offer to throw
a child out of a window, it will quake for
fear
                     •
                  , whereas bring a martyr to the fire
for Gods sake, he reioyceth for loue.
               
                  
Reason erres from the rule of wisedome,
when she doth not yeeld the necessity, or
taketh not opportunity of time.
               Reason sorteth the sound from the scabbed
sheepe; as in Gardens it separateth the
wholsome herbs and sweet flowers, from
the noysome and vnsauoury weedes, lest
growing together, the infection &amp; offence
of the one, take away the profit and pleasure
of the other.
               Reason is the ground of law, law the foundation
and strength of a kingdome, and
iustice the crowne of a King; vvho must
adde life to the law by iust execution,
without which it is neither a buckler for
innocencie, nor a sword against sinne. The
law is, as it were, a dumbe or dead King,
the King a liuing or speaking law: without
execution, neither King nor lawe are
worth a straw.
               Reason teacheth the Gardner to cut his
growne herbes, and not pull them vp by
the rootes, &amp; a good shepheard to sheere
his sheepe, not to fley them.
               Reason should teach vs a fearefull foresight
and flight of future misfortunes, euen by
the example of brutish creatures. For the

hunted Hare feedes euen in feare, and a
dogge once burnt with fire, is often after
afraid of cold water.
               Reason is discouered by speech, which indeed
is the image of a mans mind. For Solon
was wont to say, that speech was the
life of action, the discouerer of the inward
man, and that as in a glasse a man might
see the outward lin
                     •
                  aments and proportion
of the body: so in the speech, a man
might discerne the inward disposition of
the minde; whereupon when the same Solon
was to giue his iudgement on a youth
sent vnto him, hee bad him speake, and
answer him, that hee might see what was
in him.
               Reason tells you, that the trumpet giues no
sound, but by the breath of the trumpeter,
and religion tells you, that the Preacher
cannot of himselfe propose any spirituall
matter, without the gracious illumination
of a heauenly Inspirer. For what high
or heauenly thing can proceed out of the
blind vnderstanding of the naturall man,
corrupted Adam, and a bespotted conscience.
               Reason teacheth young men to liue well, &amp;

prepareth old men to die well.
               Reason delighteth in contemplation, and
the study of wisedome; as youthful spirits
doe in sportfull recreation.
               Reason is augmented by experience, and
tells vs, that the strained wit hath not the
strongest apprehension; nor a weake capacitie
is fit for a high designe.
               Reason vttred by a plausible tongue, makes
perswasions passasle with a popular eare;
but iudgement that discernes substance
from colour, the maske from the face, the
forme from the matter, will easily find out
the fallacie and error: euen as a good pen
doth helpe and grace a good writer: but
if the paper be nought, he shall make many
a blot for a letter, or commit such slender
faults as will bee easily discried by a
Scriuener.
               Reason rules the minde, as the eye directs
the body, and the helm the ship, the brydle
the horse; though bodies, shippes, and
horses knowe not their rulers. So though
the yeere is knowne by the dayes, the
dayes by the houres: yet the thoughts &amp;
reasons of mens actions, are onely known
to God and themselues.
            
            
               
               Religion.
               By me is God made knowen, tost faith repos'd:
               Diuels confounded, and all sinne disclos'd.
               REligion is set down in diuers books, but
the rest &amp; resolution of the faithfull soule
is onely in the Bible, the onely vnerring
trueth of God, which Christ hath sealed
with his blood.
               Religion is sometimes made a cloake for
villany, but he which doeth so, may goe to
Hell with his cunning, and leaue his habit
behind him.
               Religion consisteth not in benefices or dignities
of the Church; nor in a couetous
zeale that eateth vp the house of God, nor
in a malitious spirit, that enuieth the reuenues
of the Church: but in the fruites of
vnfained faith, and feruent loue.
               Religion inspired with grace, keepeth vs in
friendship with God, and defiance of the
Diuell.
               Religion truely entertained, onely rauisheth
the soule, howeuer Philosophy delighteth

with knowledge, and looke how excellent
the soule is ouer the body: by so much
Religion surpasseth all sciences in 
                     〈◊〉
                  
world.
               Religion for the summe and most materiall
points consisteth of two parts: either begging
of mercy, or giuing of glory; either
prayers or praises.
               Religion filleth the mind with Gods graces
and then it careth not for worldly pleasures:
as full stomaches euen despice hony
combes.
               Religion teacheth vs, that in the booke of
God lieth the tresure of the soule, as pearls
are found in shels, and gold digged out of
the earths entrailes: but herein is great difference;
these cannot be got without cost,
labour, toile danger, torment of mind, and
trouble of bodie: but Gods graces are obtained
without money, yea all may come
and buy for nothing.
               Religion teacheth vs to be godly, howeuer
the world may suppose it good to be wise,
and better to be rich, &amp;c.
               Religion teacheth vs the way to heauen truly:

neuer attaine the remission of sinnes.
               Religio sheweth that he, which seeketh God
with a faithful heart, and loueth God with
a ioyfull heart, and ioyeth in God with a
thankfull heart, hath a gratious blessing, a
blessed grace, a continuall comfort, and an
endlesse happinesse.
               Religion saith, that the feare of God is the
learning of the wise: the grace of God,
the glory of the learned; the peace of God,
the prest of the faithful: and the loue of
God, the ioy of the elect.
               Religion assureth vs, that he which reades
the booke of God, findes a glorious history:
he that beleeues what he reades, hath
a gratious inspiration: he that remembers
what he beleeueth, hath a blessed memory;
and he that maketh the right vse of his remembrance,
hath the perfection of vnderstanding.
               Religion warranteth vs, that impatience is
the sting of nature, and presumption the
pride of sinne, while humility is the ground
and grace of vertue and, and quietnesse and
contentation, the blessing of grace.
               Religion heareth Christ by his word, beleeueth

in him by his grace, liueth in him by
his loue, and ioyeth in him by his spirit.
               Religion guideth vs to repentanc
                     •
                  , and repentance
powreth out incessant prayers:
and true prayers will pierce the heauens,
whilest worldly securitie goeth to hell
like Diues and the diuel with a merry gale.
               Religion is vnited thus farre with Philosophy,
that euery thing feares a superior and
higher power: as the deer fears the hound,
the partridge the hawke, all creatures
man, and man God.
               Religion goes beyond superficiall knowledge,
or worldly vnderstanding: for it lifteth
vp our soules to God; as to the author,
former, and gouernour of all, and
whosoeuer knoweth him, shall neede to
know no other thing.
               Religion maketh the stomach to hunger for
grace, and so to feede on the bread of heauen:
and the soule to thirst for drinke, and
and so to carowse the water of life.
               Religion saith, that true repentance commeth
by these degrees, sadnesse of heart,
sorrow for sinne, confession of the mouth,
promise to amend, and endeuouring to
make a full satisfaction both in word and
deede.

growes couetous, and a gentleman prodigall:
while the one is walking to beggerie,
the other is comming to ignominy: and
both are going to hell.
               Religion teacheth vs neither to offend the

other.
               Religion makes conscience to confesse truely,
when pollicy causeth vs to conceale or

               Religion is scandalised in the varietie of

there is but one God, and one faith, nor

                     •
                  e, and many times the enemy of
friendship: for if iniuries are not forgotten,
and vnkindnesse put out of minde:
displeasure follows, and one mischife commonly
drawes on another.
               Remembrance in some sence is an enemy to
our saluation: for if God remember our
sinnes, who can answere him, or if the diuel
be admitted to record our transgressions,
who shall dispute against him, or trauerse
the inditement.
               Remembrance againe is the comfort of our
soules: for vnlesse God remember Dauids
troubles, he shall neuer bee released, nor
ouercome his enemies.
               Remembrance is the onely treasurie of wisdome:
for vnlesse a man bee able to make
vse of his reading by memory, and orderly
adapting the obseruations of profitable
precepts, it is to no purpose to reade the
principles of art, or ouerlooke the histories
of times.
               Remembrance is an instinct of nature euen
in beastes: for the horsse remembers his

rider, especially his feeder: the dogge his
maister, the hawke his fawlkner: the lion
his keeper, and the beare his commander.
               Remembrance maketh dumbe creatures reward
good turnes, as in the story of Andronicus
the slaue, in Aulus Gellius may appeare:
for when his maister Dacus had sent
him bound to Rome, to be cast into the Lions
denne: it was his fortune to chance into
the hands of that Lion, whose sore foot
he had healed in Affrica, which he presently
tooke notice of, and not onely saued
him from the rest, but fawned vpon him,
and relieued him by his obedience, to the
amazement and pleasure of the people.
            
            
               Resolution.
               I compasse great exploits, make weaknes strong:
               Outstrip faint hopes, thogh time defer me long.
               REsolution is perfected by patience: so
that valure and time effecteth euen impossibilitie
to faint hearts.
               Resolution is fearelesse, and in a good cause
makes a clean conscience, as a strong castle.
               
                  
Resolution tendeth to extremities, and carieth
wilfull men into many dangerous
and desperate conclusions, when without
other reason, then that they are resolute to
doe so, they runne headlong to infinite and
vnreuerseable euils.
               Resolution hath likewise a hand in Religion;
for a man must resolue to denie the
world, and dispossesse the diuell, before
he can come to heauen, as he which determineth
to take possession of a house, wherin
a stronger man dwelleth, must needes
forsake his ease and pleasures, verter on
many dangers, and thrust him out, either
by strength or pollicy, before hee get the
victorie.
               Resolution must prepare you to your trauaile,
for if you cannot endure labour,
want, disgrace, reuiling, discomforts, and
diuers other inconueniences, you were
better stay at home then vndertake a iourney
into forren countries.
               Resolution made Caius the Philospher,
when hee was in a study at his going to
death, answere the tyrant Calligula, that he
determined to marke whether the soule
would haue any knowledge or feeling of

his departure from his body.
               Resolution maketh women famous for many
memorable actions, &amp; worthy exploits
As in the time of the Emperour Conradus
the third, Caesar hauing wars in the kingdome
of Bauaria, amongst other places
came to the Citie of Monaco: where when
hee had lost some principall Captaines in
the assault, he swore: that if he entred the
towne, he would not leaue a man aliue in
it; whereupon when it was in a great distresse
indeede, and not able to hold out:
some of the Ladies and best sort of women
went to the Emperor, and falling on their
knees at his feete, beseeched him so farre
to mittigate the heate of his wrath, that
though he had sworne the death of all the
men: yet to spare the women, and giue
them leaue to passe away with life, and euery
one with that which she did cary orderly
away, which solemnly granted, not one
woman issued out of the towne, but had
either husband, brother, childe, kinseman,
or friend on her back. Whereat the Emperor
much amazed, cōmended their resoluon,
and forgate his anger, and in great mercy
sent them with all the men into the

towne againe, gaue them all their goods,
and tooke the Duke not onely to mercy,
but aduanced him to honour, as all the rest
vnto fauour.
               Resolution biddeth vs feare no shadowes,
for their forces are litle: nor trust in dreams,
for they are but illusions.
               Resolution raiseth valour to the first steppe
of honour, while excuse and feare are the
disgrace of a noble nature.
               Resolution made the siedge of Numantia so
famous, and the destruction so glorious:
for as the Romans one way were resolued
to conquer it, and so endured infinit troubles
and distresses: the Numantines were as
absolute in the defence of their honours:
and so put in practise a most memorable
stratagem. For when there was no remedy
but submission, they brought al the substance
of their citie into the market place
and burnt it to cinders, and presently
kylled themselues, so that when the Romans
entred indeede, there was neither riches to
cary away, nor persons to triumph ouer.
            
            
               
               Statesman,
               I languages with forren secrets, know:
               And for my countrey doe my paines bestow.
               A Statesman cannot well maintaine the
credit of his place, except hee haue bin
a Trauailer, a Linguist, a Scholler, and iudicious:
for it is not an outward fame, that
can carry it away, but a substantiall knowledge
must leade you vp to preferment.
               A Statesman many times hazardeth the credite
of his honesty abroad: for hee commonly
reuealeth his owne secrets to know
other mens, and seemeth of any religion to
pry into the businesse of a Kingdome.
               A Statesman steps vp a higher degree then
a Trauailer, for what time this spendeth

               A Statesman must not onely be secret himselfe,
but be very cautelous, that no man
else discouers his secrets: for else hee shall
onely passe with a superficiall knowledge,
and neuer attaine vnto true intelligence.

affairs are certified vnderhand, before their
letters are read in publicke.
               Statesmen at home must euer remember the
common good, before their priuate profit:
wherein these particulars are much in vse;
the honour of the Prince, the glory of the
Nation, the confederacy of the Princes,
which may soonest annoy being enemies:
the affinitie of such as may best loue the
countrey, if alteration should happen, the
armies made sure, the nobilitie held in fauour,
the Gentlemen maintained in their
priuiledges, the commons kept in obedience,
and the publicke treasury supplied.
               Statesmen must not bee ignorant of ancient
lawes, and former antiquities, least pollicie

dangerous grudgings traduce priuate men
for their priuate respects.
               Statesmen endeuouring to ouerthrow antient
customes, must worke it out by pollicy;
and to set vp new deuices, contriue it
by cunning; for the people will quickely
espy a rent in the whole cloth, and dare doe
more then whisper against the seducers of
Princes.
               Statesmen must take heede, that Princes doe
not fauour corrupt officers: for though a
Prince be good, yet if his fauorites be bad,
it is as ill as if he were bad himselfe.
               Statesmen must not practise any thing against
the principles of religion, least it sauor
of Atheisme rather then pollicie: and
so the diuell seeme to bee serued, and
God dishonoured.
               A Statesman, if he be not carefull of his carriage,
will incurre the imputation of an
enformer abroad, and at home of irreligious:
for abroad he must giue intelligence
of his best friends, and at home flatter his
very enemies.
               Statesmen must obserue the Court, promise
faire to the Citie: fauour the countrey,
counterfet with the Nobles, entise the

Gentlemen: pardon the factious: keepe
the mightie in league: and detaine the
commons in curtesie.
            
            
               Scholer.
               I striue for learning, without strife; that time
               With Fames faire wings may learn mee how to
climbe.
               A Scholer is for the time a prentise to
Art, and must serue out his yeeres before
he can sue his freedome: but heerein
lies the difference betweene learning and
riches; when a tradesmans prentishippe is
finished, hee sets vp for himselfe; when a
scholers, for others; as a principle in Philosophy,
He liues not at all, that liues not
to the good of his country.
               Scholers, of all vices, are not couetous: for
they care not how little they take for their
money.
               Scholers and souldiers must entertaine resolution
to beare with all inconueniences, &amp;
tarry the time of preferment: for otherwise,
if either start back, as wearied with

some hindrances, he is anew to beginne againe:
yea peraduenture in as ill a case, as
hee, that goes vp a ladder, but slippeth off
the rondells; or when one breakes, falls
downe in great danger.
               Scholers are euer learning: for such is the
excellencie of Art, that the more they studie,
the more they may; and the more
knowledge they haue, the lesse they seeme
to knowe: for comparing the hidden secrets
with the apparant, they seeme no otherwise,
then a candle in the sunne, and a
riuer to the sea.
               Scholers ought to be penitent for nothing
more then the losse of time: for the Merchant
complaines of shipwrack; the Citizen
of bad creditors; the Souldier of ill
pay-masters; the Lawyer of long vacations;
the Artificers of slender setting on
worke; the Physitian of temperate times
and diet; the Countryman of wet haruests;
and the Scholers of ill imployed
time, and worse spent houres.
               A scholer that makes mysticall Arts the abuse
of wit and studies, imployes his time
ill, to seeke preferment by the diuel; who
yet will neuer serue his turne, but to bring

his soule to destruction.
               A scholer is an enemy of fortune, because
they are many times preuented in their
race to aduancement, by such as are farre
inferior to themselues: and either for want
of friends or presents, must lose their expectations.
               A scholer may vse honest recreation at seasonable
houres, as well for the health of
his body, as chearing his spirits: for as a
knife, though it haue neuer so good an
edge, may be quickly dulled, with continuall
cutting hard or sharp things: so the
best wits in the world cannot retaine a
continuall vertue without rest, and artificiall
supply from delight and further encourage
                     •
                  ent.
               A scholer should not be vain-glorious; yet
this is a naturall imperfection incident to
learning; that in young beginners they
goe forward the better in beeing praysed;
and in old Doctors, they liue the merier
in hope to be commended.
               A scholer must be of a spare and moderate
diet: for how euer Venus cannot florish
without the helpe of Ceres and Bacchus,
yet will Minerua and the Muses liue gloriously

by the pleasant waters of Hellicon.
               
               Scholers should haue great acquaintance
with the morning: for two houres vvell
imployed then, is of more force then foure
afterward, for the attainement of learning.
            
            
               Souldier.
               O that I were not as the flow'rs in May,
               Which, when the sent is lost, are cast away.
               SOuldier is a name of that honour, that
it is the genus of vallure &amp; valiant men▪
for Emperors, Princes, great Commaunders,
inferior Captaines, &amp; military men,
with all their famous exploits, are all
comprised vnder this tearme, Hee is, or
was a braue souldier.
               Souldier seemes the prime honour and glorie
of a Nation: for in that title all other
professions are darkned, in a sort, as when
a man discourses of a Countrey hee is not
first demaunded; what Merchants there
are; how the Citizens liue; how the
Countryman tills the ground; how the

Gentlemen liues idly, and such like: but
what able men are in the same; what garisons
maintained; what souldiers florish;
what exployts they haue performed;
and this is commonly the first question.
               Souldier in the best common-welth is compared
to a nosegay, which is worne all
day, while the sweetnes &amp; freshnesse doth
last, but at night, when it fades, is cast on
the dunghill: so when necessity calls to
our Countryes defence, and that worthy
men must be imployed, they are much
made of, entertained, admitted, welcommed,
and rewarded: but as soone as peace
is confirmed, &amp; the troubles ouerblown,
then are the better sort dismissed peraduentute
with flattering words: and the
inferiour left to the whip or to the gallowes.
               Souldiers one way are the cause of welth:
for wheresoeuer they be resident, victuals
growe deere in the market: &amp; those commodities,
which the Countriman must either
spend himselfe, or sell at an easie rate,
are vttered for double value: another way
they are the ruine of a country vpon furie
of an execution, where all th
                     ••
                  gs are

subiect to fire and sword.
               Souldiers augment their honour in pardoning
of enemies, rather then their valour
in killing of the vanquished: so that the
greatest vertue in a Soldier is to ouercome
by courtesie, when by force of armes they
they haue got the victory.
               Souldiers must neither attempt any thing
by vain-glory, nor refraine through feare:
but carry such a moderation and gouernment,
that his courage turne not to fury
and madnes, nor his forbearance to pusillanimitie
and cowardise.
               Souldiers are true Christians, and true Christians
are Souldiers: for hauing a spirituali
warre-fare with the flesh, world, and diuell:
they must be euer in action, yea preuaile
at last, or else be vtterly destroyed,
for no composition can serue the turne:
therefore, that we may neither faint, nor
make friuolous excuses, God hath sent vs
into an Armory to choose such weapons,
as vnder the conduct of our Captaine Iesus
Christ, we are sure to preuaile with.
               Souldiers of the world through liberty and
ease: quickly abuse their profession: For
where is in noble designes they are honorable

and glorious in filthy idlenesse, they
are roagues and vagabonds: in the one
they are seated in a chaire of preferment,
in the other chained in a dungeon of infamy.
               Souldiers and saylers are brothers in good
courses: for there be but two Elements,
in which mortall creatures liue: Earth and
Water; wherein the Souldier at land, and
Marriner at Sea, dispatch all our businesse.
               Souldiers must either haue pay or spoile,
and sometimes loue the one better then
the other, because that pay comes by limilation,
but spoile by fortune, which filleth
many times the bag of a meane man with
rich booty.
            
            
               Shifting.
               If I sincke not, I care not who doth swell:
               I faine would liue, though how I know not well.
               SHifting doeth many times incurre the
indignitie of reproch, &amp; to be counted a

shifter, is as if a man would say in plain
tearmes a coosener.
               Shifting setteth ones wits on the tenterhookes,
for he which hath no certaine reuenew
coming in, and yet would faine
hold vp his head in the sea of the world,
must make hard shift to maintaine his credite,
and continue his estate.
               Shifting is incident to very good men, who
somtimes are compelled to vse great sums
of money, which if they cannot procure by
their owne credit, they must make shift by
others suretiship, or some good pawne:
sometimes inforced vpon some dangerous
attempt: for if a man he with a wi
                     •
                  e, and
her husband come in the mean while, he is
put to his sh
                     •
                  fts to escape the danger: somtimes
subiect to ship wracke, and 
                     •
                  o makes
hard shift to saue his life, and when hee
hath escaped, must shift himselfe, or else
goe in a drunken sute: and somtimes troubled
in a long iourney with an vntoward
Iade, which if he doe not shift, he may either
faile in his voyage, 'or fall in the dirt.
Shifting may serue ones turne in the world
amongst men: but when death comes, there
is no shift for him.
               
                  
Shifting is a very poore and troublesome
trade, if a man haue no other meanes to get
his liuing: for if his shifts faile, he must either
beg, or steale, and then followes another
shifting to put off his doublet, and
put on a rope.
               Shifting is the mother of cleanlinesse, and
the commendations of a good housewife:

                     •
                  or if the seruants be not shifted they will
become lowsie, if the sheetes be not changed
they will be nastie, if the trenchers be
not turned thee will be greasie, if the beds
be not tossed they will be fustie, and if the
houses be not cleansed they will be dusty.
               Shifting is a most necessary thing in Princes
pallaces: for if they make not often remoues,
the great concourse and continuall
residence will breede offensiue aire and infectious
sickenes.
               Shifting is the onely brauery and credite of
a Courtier, for if he be not able to change
his apparrell sometimes thrice in a day, he
is ous of countenance, and at least thrice
a weeke out of credite, but yet I would
not haue him make this shift to pawne his
winter cloaths in summer, and his summer
in winter, his Sunday-cloaths for working

daies, and his working daies for holy
dayes.
               Shifting brings confusion to a mans fortune
for he that taketh no certaine course to
maintaine his estate, is like a man in a
wood, that runneth wildly vp and downe
whooping and crying, and cannot get out,
because there is no certaine path to direct
him.
               Shifting robbeth Peter to pay Paul, and borroweth
of this man to satisfie that: so that
at last, as the pitcher going often to the
water comes broken home: hee runneth so
farre in debt to auoyde discredite, that he
is cast into a prison, whence hee cannot
returne.
               Shifting a side is sometimes excusable, as
when an importunate and troublesome suter
will not bee answered, it is not amisse
for a man to go a little a way, nor make an
honest excuse to rid him of a troublesome
businesse.
               Shifting is lamentable, proceeding of necessitie:
knauish, of wantonnesse: holesome
for cleanlinesse: courtlike for comelinesse:
Princelike for brauerie: whorish for vanitie:
diuellish for villanie: and hellish for

want of constancy in true faith and christianity.
            
            
               Singularity.
               Who me affects, vnlesse to grace I leane,
               Odly to play his part, quite marres the Scene.
               SIngularity in apparell maketh a man ridiculous,
when fantasticalnesse by custome
is neither de

                  ided not ashamed, 
                     •
                  o
odious is it to erre from that which is ordinary
and common, and suspected of pride
and selfe conceit to take vp a peculiar habit
and fashion.
               Singularity discouered the pride of Diogines
euen in his pouerty: for he not onely despised
the other sect of Philosophers, but
contested with the great Alexander himselfe,
who yet commended his humour, and
made him more proud in saying; that if hee
were not Alexander, he would be Diogines:
but all others traduced him for his singularity,
and the common people called him Ciricke,
or dogge.
               Singularity is most odious, if it be seconded

by hypocrisie: for so many attire themselues,
looke heauily, goe demure, sit sadly
speake sparingly, feed priuately: and doe all
things contrary to other men: but are yet
mecie hypocrites, and either cut-throats,
hard hearts, or licentious lechers.
               Singularity for the most part, is singularly
deceiued in its expectatiō, seeking praise,
but finding reproch and derision by an vn
                  
                     •
                  uth
fashion. for singularity euen in vertue
seldome scapes the note and brand of
hypocrisie, but to vsurpe a singularity in
things of common vse and nature, which in
themselues are matters of indifferency (as
apparell, speech, behauiour,) are euer sure of
the generall censure of giddy humerous and
ridiculous absurdity.
               Singularity hath many synonimaes; curiosity,
when in all our attempts

                  e striue to
hit the bird as it were in the eye; wilfulnes,
when in despite of custome of discretion we
will doe but what we list, and follow our
own fashion; opposition, when our custome
is contrary to all men; 
                     •
                  ancy, when our new
fangled fashion hath more lenity, then vse
or decency: hypocrisie, when we reproue
small fault's, and commit greater our selues:

pride, when wee scorne others, contempt
when we thinke none so good as our selues,
and finenesse forsooth when wee are afraid
to touch or tread on that that may foule our
fingers, or durty our shooes.
            
            
               Sinne.
               O Nothing which dost all things mar, if made;
               Why art thou Nothing, yet dost thou not vade?
               SInne is the Diuels that old Serpents
stinge, whose viperous poison it is farre
easier to auoid, then being stunge, to expell
the venome.
               Satan that sworne enemy to man, hauing
matched himselfe in marriage with iniquity,
had by her nine children, which he placed
with seuerall persons, fitting in disposition
to their seuerall humours and inclinations,
in manner following. Viz. Simony with
Priests, hypocrisie with Professors, oppression
with Nobles, vsury with Citizens deceit
with Merchants, falshood with seruants,
sacriledge with souldiers, pride with
weomen, luxury with all.
               
                  
Sinne is committed by humane frailty,
but continued by diuellish peruersity.
               Sinne is the high-way to hell, but a man
were better goe in a priuate path, though a
great way about, then follow many in the
common rode.
               Sinne continued with delight, ends in
wofull and wretched smart.
               Sinne is more infectious then the plague,
and most deadly in despaire: for in the one
sometime a recouery is had: but in the other
soule and body are vtterly confounded.
               Sinne vnreproued maketh the concealer
accessary: but he that delighteth in it, shall
feele the greatest smart of it.
               Sinne maketh men afraid to die, though
they be weary of their liues.
               Sinnes proceeding of ignorance, and confessed
with penitency, obtaine forgiuenes,
and are written in forgetfulnes.
               Sinne is a worke of darkenes: for Peter
denied Christ in the night, but confessed
him in the day, which shewes that repentance
is an action of light.
               Sinne is a trespas in thought, an error in
speech, a wickednes in committing: but
damnation in the delight and continuation.
               
                  
Sinne followed with pleasure and speedinesse,
makes a man slow of pace to meete
with his Sauiour.
               Sinne in vs is worthy to be afflicted with
punishment for offending of God, when
Christ was plagued in sauing of vs not for
any sinne of his owne, but onely for taking
our sinnes vpon him.
               Sinne repented in health when we haue power
to proceede, shews a leauing of sinne:
but 
                     •
                  e that in sickenesse repenteth, when
he hath no more power, sheweth that sin
hath left him, not he the sinne.
               Sinne through weakenesse is against the father
and his mightinesse, through ignorance
against the sonne and his wisedome,
through mallice, against the holy Ghost
and his grace.
               Sinne killed Saul with his owne hand: hanged
Absolom by his owne haire: slew Zenacherib
by his owne sonnes, and betrayed
Christ by his owne seruants.
               Sinne is the baite of folly, and the scourge
of villany, it brings the begger to the
stockes, the bawd to the cart, the theefe
to the gallowes, and the murtherer to the
wheele, and all without repentance to hell.
               
                  
Sinne makes wrath in heauen, warre on
earth, woe for man, and worke for the
diuell.
               Sinne is the seed of darkenesse, the roote of
rottennesse, the tree of cursednesse, the
blossome of vanitie, and fruite of bitternesse.
               Sinne toles the passing bell of life, strikes vp
the drum of death, sounds the trump of infamy,
and makes the whole triumph of
hell.
            
            
               Sorrow.
               Sorrow for sinne, can neuer breake the heart
               For ioy within, else life it makes to part.
               SOrrow for sinne is a signe of grace, and
ioyned with true repentance worketh
our saluation. For as a warme hand mouldeth
and fashioneth wax to what impression
it please: so do teares and true contrition
worke God to compassion.
               Sorrow is sinnes salue, and amendment of
life keepes the soule in health.
               
                  
Sorrowes concealed are killing paines, and
repentant teares though they make lesse
noyse are more forcible with God, then
fained or strained outcries, with whom
the throbs of the heart are as powerfull as
drops of blood, and the sighings of a penitent
and sorrowfull soule do alwayes preuaile.
               Sorrowes vnfelt condemne vs for want of
sense: but not forborne, proues we haue no
patience, nor right vse of affliction.
               Sorrow bursteth foorth many times into
teares, which from a true heart are gratious,
from a kinde heart pittifull, from a
curst heart scornfull, from a false heart diuellish,
and from a foolish heart ridiculous.
               Sorrow filleth the heart full of greefe, and
maketh silence a heauie burden: yet is it
better to suppresse sorrow in silence, then
let it breake forth into rage with greater
offence.
               Sorrow is ended by death, and although
patience is the ouerruler of passion: yet
delay is the murtherer of hope.
               Sorrow that is helples, is a heauy passion, &amp;
hopelesse patience is an endlesse griefe.
               
                  
Sorrow, if moderate, may bee had for the
dead, but extremities are to be auoyded i
                     •
                  
all things. For as a glutting raine is eue
                     •
                  
noysome to corne: for in seede time it
drowneth it, in the growth it lodgeth it,
and at haruest it rotteth or burneth it: so
doth sorrow and excesse of teares dull our
sences, quench our spirits, cloud our vnderstandings,
and in conclusion killeth all
liuely operation of our soules and bodies.
               Sorrow oppresseth the minde, breaketh the
heart, and keepeth vs from our iourney to
quietnesse, as a tired horse faintes in his
way, sinkes vnder his burthen, and sometime
lies downe in the dirt.
               Sorrow, if great, makes the soule burst forth
into cries; but if excessiue, it smothers
them or choakes them in the very birth or
conception: so that in sorrow, the lesse
the sound is, the more is the sense.
               Sorrow maketh a contrite heart to sigh, and
teacheth the penitent to talke with God
in prayer, which indeede is the true sacrifice,
and onely redresse of sorrow.
               Sorrow fashioneth an vnruly heart to good
order, as a wide and side garment is cut &amp;
pared, and plighted and put together in a

sit and comely manner.
               Sorrow is renued with remembrance of sins
past, meditation of faults present, and feare
of future offences.
               Sorrow is the cause of a heauy heart, hot liuer,
bad digestion, vnsauoury breath, abstinence
from meates, dry bones, swelling
eyes, sad countenance, deiected lookes,
dull and dolefull dispositions, pensiue passions,
and many melancholike maladies,
and macerations, pittifull gestures, mournfull
speeches, and mad actions, sorrow is
neuer so profitable as for sinne, nor ioy so
comfortable as for forgiuenes of sinne.
               Sorrow for sinne if true and hearty, causeth
in the faithfull feare to offend againe, but
causeth 
                     •
                  eare ioined with hope of pardon;
whereas the sorrow of the faithlesse followeth
feare of death and damnation.
               Sorrow ouercharging the heart, puts it to a
dangerous and deadly plunge: as a Faulcons
life is hazzarded by ouer-gorging, &amp;
a slender roofe by ouer-burdening; so that
a weake heart is quickely ouerthrown, and
a strong put to the more paine.
               Sorrow and teares cleanse the soule of her
sinnes, and contrition of the heart maketh

confession with the mouth: for all true
griefe makes a man know and acknowledge
himselfe.
               Sorrow in extreamity ouerpresseth a weake
resolution, as a ship ouer-loaded, doth
sometime sincke with the weight.
               Sorrow about worldly businesse bringeth
pensiuenes, and detaineth vs from such endeauours
as may preuent mischiefes, yea,
keepeth vs from godly meditations and
heauenly obiects, which are more profitable
vnto vs.
               Sorrow for wants cannot remedy them, nor
preuent necessities, and therefore it is the
way to proc
                     •
                  ed to action, and ouer come
sorrow with painefull imployments.
               Sorrow for vnkindnesse in Louers, must be
vented by words, or else the heart shall neuer
make knowne griefes, but by faire and
friendly expostulations, it comes to passe
often times, that the falling out of Louers
is the renuing of loue.
            
            
               
               Temperance.
               Nothing too much: mixe water with the wine;
               The mean is best, which temperance doth define.
               TEmperance both in iudiciary proceedings,
and in priuate mens minds and
actions, procureth tranquility, and preuenteth
outrage and calumny in Commonwealths:
for so neither the bad are supported,
nor the good oppressed, the mighty
imperious, nor the weake refractarious,
the souldier mutinous, nor the scholler contentious,
the rich couetous, nor the poore
enuious: for although most of these may
bee comprised vnder the gouernement of
Iustice; yet must Iustice her selfe be guided
by temperance.
               Temperance in diet and exercise, will make
a man say; a figge, for Gallen &amp; Paracelsus.
Temperance sitting in the heart, and ruling
the affection and tongue, keepeth a man
from flattering, dissimulation, which is an
extreame, which though the world say; he
that wants, hath no wit, vet I say, he that

vseth it hath no honesty.
               Temperance keepeth vs from flattering
speeches, which are like smooth waters,
wherein men are drowned sooner, then in
rough streames, because they are commonly
deepest, and most dangerous.
               Temperance in wine, is a whet-stone to the
wit: but excesse, is a milstone to the sences.
               Temperance through patience maketh the
smart of others soares a lenatiue to his
owne wounds; but indeed there need no
such distinction: for there is no temperance
without patience, and patience is a kinde
of temperance.
               Temperance is pace and moderate proceeding,
bringeth lowly snailes (as slowly as
they goe) to the top of high towers, when
gaping and fluttering Rookes breake their
necks for hast, out of their lofty nests.
               Temperance is the protectrix of all other
vertues: for Socrates was wont to say, that
hee which would loue his countrey as his
owne life, must aboue all things loue temperance,
or abstinence, and flie from selfe
will and excesse, as from a Syren: and Epictetes
the Stoicke did as it were knit vp all

Phylosophy in two words, Suffer and Abstaine.
In the first whereof we may learne
to beare aduersitie with a good minde: in
the second to abstaine from our owne wils
and vaine sed
                     •
                  cings.
               Temperance keepeth our affections in order:
for otherwise, if our appetite might
seede alwaye on Manna, wee would loath
it; if our inheritance did stretch to the
plaine of Iordan, we would goe beyond it;
and if we were seated in heauen, we would
lift vp our heads aboue it.
               Temperance was surely wanting when E
                     
                        •
                     ah
thought not Paradise sufficient for her
habi
                     •
                  aton; the dainties of Eden sweete enough
for her taste; nor the presence of
God good enough for her company and
contentment.
               Temperance teacheth men to vse riches &amp;
endure pouertie: yea to moderate prosperitie,
and ouercome aduersitie.
               Temperance vseth wine moderately to the
comforting the heart, and quickning the
wit, whereas taken in excesse it dulleth
the memory, weakeneth the sence, corrupteth
the blood, troubleth the stomacke,
infuseth error, and bringeth vs to

ignorance.
               Temperance poyseth vertue in a meane and
moderate scale, and hope of attaining future
good by moderation, keepeth our
wicked wils from extrauagant ranging.
               Temperance keepes the spirits at rest, and in
order, which otherwise would burst into
passions and extremities: but nothing excessiuely
violent is durable; nor any thing
orderly moderate is easily mutable.
               Temperance brought most of the Romane
warres to perfection, &amp; all the great Captaines
to glory. Thus Q
                        •
                      Fabius ouercame
Hanniball and Scipi
                        •
                     
                   Spaine: yea in his abstinence
from the beautiful captiue espoused
to Iudibilis, he wonne the hearts of all
the people, and setled the Romane Empire.
               Temperance is diet keepes the bodie in
helth, but a cleare conscience is the soundnesse
of the foule.
               Temperance ioyned with modesty teacheth
apparell to couer nakednesse, and meate
to nourish nature: but feasts cause surfe
                     •
                  
                  ting,
riches pride, voluptuousnesse idlenes,
and excesse ouerthrowes all.
               Temperance is the way to walke to perfection:

and as when we looke in a glasse, and
see the spots in our face, vnlesse the hand
be li
                     •
                  ted vp to make all cleane, it is to no
purpose. So though wisedome discouer
our imperfections, yet if temperance assist
not to reformation, vices will spread farther
and farther to our finall ruine.
            
            
               Time.
               This is the cure of griefe, the end of hope,
               To all thy wishes time affords thee scope.
               TIme ouercommeth all labour, and endeth
the greatest miserie and heauines:
for how forcible soeuer sorrowes seeme,
yet there must be an ending, as there was a
day of beginning.
               Time amongst many other wayes, is not
least of all lost in telling lies and wonders,
and seldome are such men beleeued in
true relations; like the shepheards boy,
that called the shepheards to helpe him:
for the Wolfe was comming for a Lambe;
who therupon startled came once or twise
bu. were deceiued: for the wanton boy

did mocke them with a lie; whereupon
when the Wolfe indeede was come, they
would not beleeue him, and so lay still vntill
the Lambe was gone, and the boyes
was turned to crying.
               Time betwixt infancy and age seemeth long
but in respect of eternitie it is much lesse
then a minute: for God is before and after
all times, which beare no proportion to
his induring.
               Time is pretious to the wise, but vile to a
foole; to the learned a treasure, to the lasie
tedious, to the blessed ioyfull, and to the
damned horrible: for in hell their pai
                     •
                  e is
surpassing and perpetuall.
               Time is vnrecouerable, and threfore not to
bee spent in want on fictions, or idle fantasies,
or vaine pleasures.
               Time watche th
                     •
                  our life, for the euening tels
what the day hath done, the weeke casteth
vp the dayes account, the monthes the
weekes, the yeeres the monthes, our life
the yeeres, and death our life and all our
actions.
               Time makes the snail
                     •
                   clime a great height,
though hee hasten but a slow pace, the
warmth of the Sunne recouers dead flies;

the graine of mustard-seede becommeth a
tree: the small seeds of the earth spred to
florishing branches: and al naturers works
come to perfection in their due time.
               Time is not to bee let slip: for a bright morning
may haue a blacke day, and a glorious
day a gloomy euening.
               Time is lost, when wee labour in vaine, but
whē we to work euil its to abuse both wit
and time: so time gained is a proofe of wit,
but abused the reproofe of wickednesse.
               Time of har
                     •
                  est is ioyfull to the husband-men;
of receiuing fees to to the lawyer; of
taking rents to the Gentlemen; of rest and
case to the souldier &amp; laborer: of expences
to the prodigall, of releeuing the poore to
the charitable, and so in infinite other particulars.
               Time is pictured like Fortune with a hairy
foretop and bald behinde: to shew that we
must catch hold of time, while shee offers
her selfe, and not let slip an opportunity to
to do vs good; for there is no hold fast to
be taken, when she is past and gone.
               Time is pretious to the vnderstanding spirit,
and labour easie to the louing heart,
while losse of time is the shame of folly,

and forced paine brings vnpleasing profit.
               Time trieth all things, and openeth the eyes
of true vnderstanding, making the eye of
nature to guide the whole world in good
order, the eye of reason to run the course
of nature, the eye of art to note the rules
of reason: but the eye of wisedome to take
grace for her direction.
               Time lost is hardly to bee recouered, olde
sores are hardly healed, credite crackt is
hardly restored, and long quarrels hardly
quieted.
               Time lost is the effect of folly, the shame of
wit, the rudenesse of will, the rust of sence,
the raine of reason, the wound of sinne, the
woe of man.
               Time and tides must be watched: for if they
will not tarrie for kings, let not inferiour
persons expect to command the heauens.
            
            
               Traueller.
               I Countries, vices, manners, men, obserue;
               Learn languages, and would good fame deserue.
               TRaueller is an excellent hunts-man of
idlenes, and Phisitian to cure the passion

of loue: for by labour and more generous
imployment out of sight of the absent
and beloued obiect, the body and
minde are otherwise so set on worke, that
lasinesse and loue are quite extinct.
               Traueller must doe more then looke on
goodly buildings, and gaze on beautifull
faces: lest he be like to his carriage truncke
that is remo
                     •
                  ed hither and thither to serue
his idle humours, to make showes, and fill
vp places: but makes no profitable obseruations
for publike seruices.
               Traueller must haue the head of a Philosopher,
to carry away all he remembers, and
sees, the heart of a Lyon to endure all afflictions,
and not be afraid of any dangers,
the mouth of a swine to tast and eate all
meates, the eyes of a Hawke to view the
secrets of all places, where he resorts, the
backe of an Asse to beare and forbeare either
floutes or disgraces, the legges of a
Cammell to carry his owne body, and other
necessaries if need be, and the vigilancy
of a Cocke to bee awake at all houres,
and be ready to attend his iourney.
               Traueller at sea sees the wonders of God, &amp;
at land the pleasures of the world: at sea

he must endure both stormes and wants: at
land he may preuent extreamities, at sea he
must prouide before hand, and so may
make shift without mony: at land he must
alwaies haue coyne or credit to serue his
turne, as sea he liueth at ease without pleasure,
at land he hath delight with some labour,
at sea he is in danger of Piracy, tempests,
and shipwrackes: at land he may fall
amongst theeues, couseners, and curtesans,
at sea hee is troubled with the vnsauory
smell of the ship, at land refreshed with the
sweet scent of flowers of the field. To conclude,
at sea he must endure some inconueniences,
and at land he may enioy great
contentment and delight.
               Traueller must make vse of his labours: for
it is not sufficient to goe from City to City,
from Countrey to Country, from house
to house, from one delight to another, except
he learne the language, obserue the
most remarkeable things, conuerse with
vnderstanding men, conferre with the iudicious,
be in person at solemnities, giue 
                     •
                  are
to all reports, but beleeue onely truthes or
strong probabilities, and not let slip any
opportunity to enrich his knowledge, and

pleasure his Countrey.
               Traueller must not take exception to his
Inne, find fault with his lodging, murmure
at his bedfellow, grudge at his diet, raile
on his waggener, speake ill of the religion,
make comparisons with the state, villipend
the place, where he remaines, not take exceptions
to the faults and imperfections of
priuate persons, no though they be apparant
impieties.
               Traueller neede not care for costly or superfluous
apparell: must haue money and
not shew it, learning and not boast of it,
secrets and not discouer them, abilitie of
body and not abuse it, courage of heart,
and not imploy it: and patience, but not
ouerburthen it; for in matters iustisiable
all conntries hearken after complaintes,
and are prowd, when they may doe iustice
to strangers.
               Traueller must take heede of curiositie, either
to enquire after dangerous newes, or
to seeke after others secrets: for so he may
be brought to the suspition of an intelligencer,
and discredit of enformer: in both
which, though there bee some things allowable;
yet the very title maketh a blur.

Traueller must be sure of credit, where hee
meanes to reside: for as he cannot beforehand
determine his returne; so hee may
not trust vnto strangers for their charitie
in vnknowne places: nay, his owne countreymen
will faile him, and his wants defeate
and disgrace him.
               Traueller may performe his businesse the
better, by how much hee makes the lesser
show: For from a priuacy of life, he is vnsuspected,
whereas publicke eminence
makes him dangerously marked.
               Traueller must be tongue-tied in matters of
Religion, and leaue disputation of controuersies:
for to reise no arguments, to vse
no contradiction, to make no comparison,
to reproach or dispraise no man, or by nips
or iests to expose him to derision, are secure
points for a Traueller to build on.
            
            
               Troubles.
               Troubles are trials, though they turne to losse:
               Like gold and siluer, that are tried from drosse.
               TRoubles are incident to an honest life:
but sometimes they are so many and so

heauy, that they make honesty weary, &amp; to
sell her freehold: but troubles to confirme
constancy in honesty are gracious trials.
               Troubles are tokens of Gods fauour, wherevpon
Policrates the tyrant was affraide of
nothing so much, as the sicklenesse of fortune,
because he had neuer any trouble or
mischance in the world, which made him
cast his rich iewell into the sea, because he
would haue some crosses: but a fisherman
hauing taken an extraordinary Dolphine,
brought it to the King, who found his
iewell in her belley: whereat amazed, hee
presently swore, there was some great mischiefe
and trouble toward him, which fell
out accordingly: for that night there was
a conspiracy against him, and he lost his
life.
               Troubles are like sea-markes to direct vs
in the channell of saluation, least wee fall
on the rockes, and shelfes of worldly cares
and couetousnesse: or sincke ouer-head
with cares into the gulphes and skirts of
deuouring vanitie, or filthy pleasures: from
which we are often preserued by profitable
troubles.
               Troubles that are sudden and not foreseene,

puzell our very thoughts; and perturbe
our vnderstandings with pensiue cares:
therefore is premeditation a great point
of discretion, but it must forecast as well
to preuent present mischiefes, as to prouide
fo
                     •
                   future times.
               Troubles make men-trust in God, and then
they cannot be deceined, whereas hee that
trusteth in man, shall be sure to be abused.
               Trouble is of greater power to restraine the
act, then satisfie the desire: for the body
may be weary of sinning, when desire is
neuer satisfied with sinne: as the drunkard
that can drinke no more, yet cals for more
wine; and the lecher vnable to satisfie his
lust, yet loues to rub and scratch his scuruey
ytch.
               Troubles bring a man much lesse griefe with
a vertuous wife; but a vi
                     •
                  ious woman her
selfe alone, will ouercome the patience of
any man. They are much more troublesome
to mens hearts, then a smoaking
chimney is to their eyes.
               Troubles are comforts to none, but such as
haue grace to see, who sendes them, and
why? and so to profit by them accordingly.
So imprisonment is pleasing onely to

such as know their patience and good cariage
for a while, will procure their greater
libertie.
               Trouble not the Lion in his pleasure, nor anger
him in his pray, it may doe thee hurt,
it cannot good; hunting will not make the
wilde bull tame, but starke madde.
               Trouble of a disquieted minde can no more
be concealde then the cough, or a woman
with childe, it filles with frowardnesse and
griefe, and both will forth.
               Trouble is the common place of the poore,
they are euer in it, and for want of meanes,
there is great disquiet: but an vnruly wife
is a quotidian feauer, and a continuall
plague on earth.
               Troubles are the trials of patience, and passion
the trouble of reason, feare is the enemy
of a weake spirit, but faith is the assurance
of comfort, as temperance the warrant
of iudgement.
               Troubles and trauaile keepe the body in
motion, as study the minde and sences.
But as ouermuch of the one trieth the body:
so ouermuch of the other exhausteth
the spirits.
               Troubles happen sometimes to the best liuers,

and sutes in lawe are a meere laborinth
to an honest man, and quiet minde.
               Troubles cannot ouerthrowe godly resolutions,
nor wise men bee ouercome with
trifels.
               Troubles of the spirit grow by the infirmity
of the flesh, and the infirmity of the spirit,
is the flesh ruined: so that they are both
wayes cause of each others calamities.
            
            
               Vanitie.
               The world (though Heau'n) is but meere vanity
               Compar'd with God? no, with Saints piety.
               VAnitie in words, cloathes, and actions,
wherein men doe so much glory, sheweth
them voide of wisedome and pietie,
which if it infused no other infection to
the speaker, or hearer: actour, or beholder;
yet were it herein a great sinne, that it is a
lauish profuser of pretious time.
               Vanitie and des
                     •
                  re of glory doe commonly
keepe company, for gorgeous buildings,
sumptuous tombes, large hospitalles, outward

pompe, delicate banqueting houses,
delightfull orchards, and all such fabricks,
and sumptuous workes of purpose to bee
talked of, and adde to our fame: are all but
vanitie, wanting the substance of good
deedes and true humilitie.
               Vanitie is often vented with litle vnderstanding,
and yet great study, while the hand
of wisedome quickly discouereth the folly
of idle inuention.
               Vanities are herein venemous, that they so
blast the forward wits of youth in the blossome
or budde, that they seeldome come
to substantiall and mature frute.
               Vanitie maketh wit a foolish wanton: for
he that delighteth in toyes, to neglect
weighty affaires, hath litle vnderstanding.
               Vanitie soothed corrupts wit and reason:
but the correction of vice commendeth
and causeth wisedome.
               Vanitie transporteth to vnprofitable pleasures,
when wisedome delighteth in necessary
imployments.
               Vanitie of the world is like a smoake in the
ayre, which seemeth to ascend vnto heaheauen,
but it goeth and vanisheth to nothing,
and letteth fall the followers thereof

to the pitte of perdition.
               Vanitie is seene in certaine things, whereto
no trust is to be giuen. The chance of the
dice, the continuance of prosperitie, the
faire wether in winter, or sun-shine in Aprill:
the teares of a Crocadile, the playing
of Dolphins, the elloquence of a flatterer,
the preferment of a tyrant, and the constancy
of a woman.
               Vanitie is soone seene in vaunting brauadoes
as appeares by this story. The Duke
of Calabria going to make warre vpon the
Florentines: in a brauery saide hee would
not pull off his bootes before hee had entred
the citie, to whom a merry fellow
standing by saide, oh my Lord, you will I
feare fret out a number of shooes then: for
it must needes bee a longer businesse then
you imagine.
               Vanitie is a great reproach to true vnderstanding,
when we either speak more then
our cau
                     •
                  e in hand requires: or liue aboue
our abilitie and estates, making a greater
shewe and pompe then we can maintaine
by our meanes: or attempt any enterprise,
which we are not able to finish.
               Vanitie sheweth it selfe much in idle actions

and ridiculous iests▪ as in this tale may appeare.
A Gentleman of Naples, whose
spirit was too high for his fortune, liued
farre exceeding his maintenance: and yet
had the fortune by secrete supportation to
hold vp his head in the sea of the world in
despight of enuious eyes. Thus one night
he lodged in the house of a baron, a friend
of his, where waking somewhat early: he
fell to make his prayers vnto God for the
remission of sinnes, and worldly meanes,
which a certaine i
                     •
                  ster ouerhearing, and
lying in the next chamber, answered with
a lowde voyce! oh thou prodigall childe,
thou art borne a yonger brother, and to
keepe but one man and a boy art stil begging;
but if thou wilt maintaine a number
of idle followers (whereof thou art ambitious)
learne to be thrifty, &amp; spare in time▪
or thy prayers will not be heard, whereat
the Gentleman seeing his vanitie, and perceiuing
he had cōmitted some error, replied.
Indeed I spake too lowde to let thee
heare me: and haue committed a greater
folly to suffer thee to liue vpon me.
               Vanitie of apparell sheweth the pride of
heart: the weaknesse of wit, the fantasticknesse

of will: the defect of vnderstanding,
or vnrulinesse of affection, the superfluitie
of prodigalitie: and a prognosticate of
pouertie.
               Vanitie of discourse and foolish table-talke
maketh men often ridiculous, as appeareth
by this. A Gentleman sitting at the table
of a great friend being his fauorite, the
table fully furnished, and the company wel
prepared to their viands: the maister of
the house began to rouse his shoulders in
a rich chaire, and himselfe as richly attired,
spake to a kinseman of his somewhat
abruptly, and then leauing him, he also
spake to the former Gentleman: and then
againe to his cousin, whereat all the company
amazed, expected to heare some
matter worthy to be vttered: but he gaue
onely a hemme, and with a spit, saide no
more, but cousin: what is that pye before
you; whereat a iester, cha
                     •
                  ing that he had
stayed his teeth to giue time to his eares,
replyed suddenly: better eate of a calues
head, then heare an owle speake: whereat
the ghuests held laughter so hard, that they
were ready to breake, and thus is idle ignorant
vanity worthely made ridiculous by
hier owne folly.
            
            
               
               Valour.
               Vnlesse I make a man base feare subdue:
               He's but a beast to God and man vntrue.
               VAlour aduanceth to honour, and thrusteth
misery aside from pressing vs down
in the durt.
               Valour proceeding by wisedomes direction,
perfecteth such actions, as otherwise
would faile in the execution.
               Valour may be accompanied with folly, and
and then is it meere foole-hardinesse or temeritie:
so that now in the schoole of the
wisest it is disputable, whether a wise
coward, or a valiant foole is the better
man.
               Valour maketh a Captaine with a few souldiers
ouercome many enemies: but he that
ouercommeth himselfe, is valiant indeede;
but he which is his owne enemy, whether
shall he flie for succour or securitie.
               Valour differeth from foolish hardinesse, as
a wise feare may be farre from cowardice:
in bo
                     ••
                   extremities turne to vice.
               
                  
Valour scorneth to moue the impotent to
impatiency, to betray the innocent to villany;
or to vexe the simple with impetuositie.
               Valour wil not insult ouer a weake hearted,
nor picke a quarrell with one that cannot
answer him, either for impotency, some
defect of nature, disabilitie of person, inequalitie
of condition, or imperfection of
sense.
               Valour in a good cause doth not feare death
as true diuines in Gods cause are not terrified
with the diuell.
               Valour is often ouerthrowne by rashnesse,
and had I wist is the worst part of vnderstanding:
for rashnesse without reason may
breed sorrow without compassion.
               Valour is glorious in mercy, but a cowheard
is tyrannous in victorie.
               Vallour must not attempt impossibilities,
nor run into with absurdities; but carry an
equalhead both in the practise of attempts
and relation of actions, neither bosting
of its owne worth, or extenuate anothers
merit.
               Valour of the Captaines is a maine meanes
of victorie to the whole armie; whereuppon

the Numantines being great souldiers
thus commended the Romans: when once
in a battaile, or great peece of seruice they
were put to the worst, and driuen to slight
by Scipio Aemilianus: at their sitting down
they were reprehended by their leaders in
great rage for their base cowardise, with
these words; are not these the Romane
sheepe, that we haue so often beaten home
to their foldes? to which the souldiers
made this answer: they are indeed the same

                     ••
                  eepe, but they haue changed their shepheards,
meaning they had now more valiant
Commanders.
               Valour is so great a friend to learning, that
that it will answer in her behalfe, vnterrified
with swearing or swaggering: for so a
noble young Gentleman much giuen to
learning, and a great louer of study sitting
one day amongst his bookes, was visited
by a more hot braine, then wise witted
gallant: a neighbour of his, who at his
comming vnto him, vsed this speech?
What still at thy booke? euer amongst the
dead? come abroade, and liue with the liuing?
Oh answered the yong Gentleman
I am sorry to heare thee say one thing, and

prooue another; for my bookes are dead in
show, but full of life indeede; and thou
doest liue in shew, but to vertue the true
life thou art dead.
               Valour holds vp the sword of Iustice, and
maketh life to shine with a lustre of honor,
as the starres through the cloudes.
               Valour raiseth meane men to order of her
seruice, and degrees of militarie renowne
so it be seasoned with experience and vnderstanding;
otherwise to see a yonger soldier
preferred before another breedes repining,
and how euer fauour and authoritie
may proceede per saltum, yet it is a
meere wrong.
            
            
               Vertue.
               I make true honour worthie truest praise,
               And from the dust the humble I do raise.
               VErtue hath a countrey in heauen, and
when she commeth on earth, she is like
a traueller that goeth to a friend to perswade
him to change his dwelling for a
better.
               
                  
Vertue maketh life famous, and death glorious;
and he that neglecte
                     •
                  h her is a foole:
but he that hateth her is a diuell.
               Vertue in youth maketh age honorable, and
in age maketh death memorable: it is as
harmony to life, and a sweet Di
                     •
                  pason in
musicke to the comfort both of the players,
and standers by.
               Vertue in misery is the ioy of the wicked,
as wickednesse in prosperity is the griefe
of the godly: which makes me remember
a saying of a Phylosopher, to Phalaris the
Tyrant, who reprehended him for weeping
at the death of his friend, as being a
principle against true Phylosophy: but he
very confidently replied; I weepe not O
Tyrant, that the vertuous doe die, but that
the vicious doe liue, and such as thou dost
gouerne.
               Vertue is blemished with vaine-glorious
ostentation, but to boast of wickednes and
vice, is the top of sinne, and most abhominable
to God and good men.
               Vertue in a Prince is the subiects ioy, and the
peace of all estates is conserued by vertuous
administration, mar
                     ••
                  all discipline, due
execution of lawes, worthy aduancing to

preferment, couragious suppressing the insolent,
and resolute constancy to mainetaine
true religion and ciuell administration:
all which must be performed by vertue,
and cannot be done without her direction.
               Vertue of the wise is to be beloued, the life
of the vertuous to be gracious, the seruice
of the faithfull to be rewarded, and the honour
of the valiant to be aduanced.
               Vertue maketh the minde of man to thinke
right vpon God, and to doe right amongst
men, so that true Vertue beginneth by
good motions, good motions proceed to
resolute meditations, resolute meditations
must bee expressed by orderly wordes:
orderly wordes must goe forwards to
effectuall deeds: effectuall deeds to constant
perseuerance, and perseuerance must
knit vp the life with the indissoluble knot
of eternall fame.
               Vertue is most graced by mercy and pitty:
for therein doe men come neerest the diuine
nature, whilst tyrants on earth breath
nothing but blood and reuenge.
               Vertue buildeth vpon hope of reward, and
honour is a great spur
                     •
                  e to vertuous endeauors.
               
                  
Vertue hath her greatest lustre compared to
the vicious, as starres shine brightest in the
darkest night.
               Vertue of the soule dimmeth the beauty of
the body, as the brightnes of the Sunne diminisheth
the light of a candell: for vertue
will appeare in despight of enuy, yet must
men take heed of polluting ve
                     •
                  tue with the
lest crime: for a staine is not so soone seene
in a course cloath, as in pure linnen.
               Vertue is gracious in the beginning, famous
in the proceeding, admirable in the end,
and glorious in the memory euen after
death.
               Vertue in the depriuation thereof, leaueth
the soule more bare then the naked body.
               Vetue is like a mirrour: for as when a man
looketh in a glasse▪ and thereby discouereth
the spots and staines of his face: so
through vertue doe we behold the imperfection
of nature, and the deformity of
sinne.
               Vertue cannot bee obtained without an industrious
heart, and painefull pursuit: 
                     •
                   therfore
let no idle person euer thinke to attaine
vertue by following vanity: for a shadow
in shew, cannot produce a substance
in effect.
               
                  
Vertue is the gift of God, but gotten by industry.
            
            
               Warres.
               I am a scourge of sinne, how ere I seeme,
               Vniust and barbarous, as fooles esteeme.
               VVArres that are bloody, make
euen the peace wofull, and those
are accursed, that are sowers of ciuell discord.
               Warres dispeople Countries, deuast Cities,
defloure Virgins, rauish Matrons, ouerthrow
Common-wealthes, ruinate husbandry,
spoile Merchants, empouerish the
Trades-man, and turnes topsie turuy the
whole Kingdome.
               Warres are sent as a Nurse, and punishment
of sinnes, and because sinne doth euer encrease,
till the last houre; there will neuer be
a generall peace.
               Warres attempted through ambition or
vaine-glory, doe commonly end to the
preiudice of the beginner: but if to propulse
iniuries, then the decider of all controuersies

commonly carrieth the cause with the
innocent parties.
               Warres are leuied to maintaine peace: for
as a sword is an instrument of defence, and
a cloake a shelter for the raine: so men vse
wars to keepe themselues from the stormes
of vtter ruine by forren enemies, or priuate
subuersion, by ciuell, or if you will, vn
                     •
                  iuel
friends.
               Warres that grow vpon ambition, are like
to bee terrible: but a luxurious peace is as
miserable.
               Warres are pleasing in conceit, or for outward
brauery to the vnexperienced, as
peace is vnpleasant to a troublesome spirit.
               Warres are fearefull in the very rumour,
much more in the terrible effects: for
though the Drumme and Trumpet ye elda
braue sound, yet doth the Musket and Pike
giue a killing blow.
               Warres are commonly forren, or domestick;
the first may bee propulsed by like forces:
but the other must be preuented by cautelous
endeauours, and both in the beginning,
as we doe the bursting out of riuers,
which otherwise will spoile all with their
violent ouerflowings.
               
                  
Warres cannot be maintained without men:
Men cannot be got without money, mony
cannot be leuied without taxes and impositions,
taxes cannot be paid without obedience,
nor obedience shewed without
loue, and hearty inclination to the Prince.
               Warres resemble the eyes and beauty of a
strumpet, pleasing to the sight, attractiue
and full of fauour in outward resemblance:
but there is death in her company, hell in
her bed, and damnation in her entertainement:
so to see braue plumes and scarffes,
rich cassockes, barbed horses, to heare the
cheerefull Drum and Trumpet, to march in
martiall manner through the streetes, and
to be trained in the flourishing fields, our
acquaintance beholding vs, and friends
smiling on vs, is a gallant idlenes: but to
lie in the durty fields, to watch in the dark
                     •
                  
nights, to freeze standing sentinell, to famish
for want of meates, to be infeebled
by the flix, to fight with cruell enemies,
to be shot with their bullets, to be thrust
through with their pikes, to be slaine with
their swords, to be trampled with horses,
to bee eaten vp by rauens, to rotte in the
fields, or be buried in heapes, are fearefull

ishues of faire showes.
               Warres that are neuer so honourable and
glorious, are farre inferiour to peace vpon
any honest composition whatsoeuer.
               Warres resemble a new broom, which sweepeth
away the vnclean cobwebs, &amp; casteth
them out of our houses vpon our dunghils;
so doth warre consume the caterpillers of
a countrey, and carry the vagabonds and
rogues, and rascall rabblement to their
common graues.
            
            
               Wilfulnesse.
               No woe is wanting to a wilfull Man?
               If he be hurt, it from himselfe began.
               VVIlfulnesse maketh him fall, that may
stand, and then we say hee is iustly
hurt by his owne hand, howeuer wee may
excuse the stumbling of one that is blind.
Wilfulnesse bringeth folly to woe, whilst
the warinesse of the wise, runs the course
of great comfort.
               Wilfulnesse in steed of law, makes patience
subscribe to power, and when wit wants

iudgement, what hope can there be had of
iustice.
               Wilfulnesse is cosin german to madnesse, and
he that will not be aduised, if he perish in
his peeuishnesse should not be pittied.
               Wilfulnesse in the Generall of an Army,
many times ouerthroweth the whole action,
because he runneth head-long to destruction,
and nere disputeth what hinderances
and obstacles may intercept him;
which makes mee remember the History
of Heluetia, when the Emperour Charles
the fift determined to inuade the same, the
Noble men and Captaines were so wilfully
bent, that they presently resolued without
further disputing to enter the Countrey,
had not a foole standing by thus interrupted
them: here are great words among
you, that you will presently enter Heluetia,
and goe into the mountaines: but let mee
aske you, how you will get out againe: for
when you shall be pusselled in the narrow
passages, where ten men, may keepe out a
hundred, you will repent your wilfulnesse:
whereupon better aduice was taken, and
the iourney for that time adiourned.
               Wilfulnes brings repentance too late, when

irrecouerable mischiefe hath light on a
franticke pate, and made it too late to deliberate,
how to preuent it.
               Wilfulnesse of the Gouernours is the highway
to the slaughter of their souldiers: for
when at the first besieging of Belgrade, the
great Turke in a manner saw the impossibility
of the attempt, he yet was so wilfull,
that he commanded the Ianisaries to come
forward; who thereuppon pressing ouer tumultuously,
were slaughtered in thousands,
to the filling vp both of trenches and dit
                  
                     •
                  hes,
so that there were slain aboue 60000.
lamentably through the imperious wilfulnesse
of the Empeour.
               Wilfulnesse made the prodigall child runne
his riotous race, to the offending of God,
disobedience of parents, griefe of friends,
consuming his inheritance, and hazzard
both of body and soule in misery eternall.
               Wilfulnesse causeth strumpets to pleade nenessity
of maintenance, want of seruice,
losse of friends, liberty of life, and priuiledges
of loue; when yet it is meerely a wilfull
resolution to doe wickedly, and enioy the
pleasures of sinne for a season: for otherwise

vertue cannot bee poore, nor want
maintenance, if it want not industry.
               Wilfulnesse in prodigall courses, begin and
goe on with some sence and hope of delight,
but quickely runne into pouerty, and
end in misery.
               Wilfulnesse cannot endure either restraint
or direction, but runneth on in the course
of destruction, as a seeled Doue flieth
head long on shee knowes not whither,
and at last is subiect to the seisure of the
Hawke.
            
            
               World.
               No doubt I am a Master piece of beauty,
               If my lesse Worlds within me, doe their duty.
               THe World hath so many bewitching
properti
                     •
                  s, that we are so much the neerer
to the diuine nature, as we lift vp our
minds from it, or aboue it for there is great
difference betweene temporall trash, and
spirituall treasure.
               The world must bee cared for to maintaine
the body, the body to preserue life, life to

comfort the soule: but neither to nourish
vs in iniquity, and dispossesse vs of eterninie.
               The world is but a daies walke: for the Sun
goes about it in 24. houres, and the Sea is
but shallow: for it is but a stones cast to the
bottome, but the thought of man is vnmeasurable,
and the depth of wisdome vnsearchable.
               The world holds him wise that is wealthy:
but vertue knowes him to be wealthy that
is wise: for many loose their liuing for want
of wit, but very few loose their wits for
want of land.
               The world you see is a beautifull workmanship,
yet it shall be consumed with fire for
deformity and pollution of sinne.
               The world resembles a generall Merchants
store-house, wherein are infinit sorts of
wares for diuers vses; but if the buyers
come more for idle fancies, then necessary
vses, they may spend their money to little
purpose, and loose their time to great repentance.
               The world made the Phylosophers amazed
to consider it: for they could not conceiue
the originall, were ashamed to see the vanity,

and confounded to consider to what
end and issue it would come: whereupon it
is recorded, that three excellent Phylosophers
gathered themselues together concerning
the same: Heraclites, Democritus,
and Epictetes the Stoick. After some disputation,
Epictetes put a fooles cap ouer the
Globe, Democritus laughed to scorne the
vanity, and Heraclitus 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   the miserie.
               The world seekes wealth, the wealthy honor,
the honourable respect, but the true
conuert careth for nothing but Christ, and
him crucified.
               The world doth commonly persecute men
three manner of waies, in soule, body, and
goods: the soule is troubled with vnlearned
Diuines, the body tormented with vnskilfull
Physitians, and the goods purloined
by factious Lawyers: whereupon the
Archbishop of Florence said to Cardinall
Alexandrinus, that Lawyers themselues sildome
went to law, Physitians tooke no
physicke, and Diuines were many of them
scarse good Christians.
               The world by the opinion of Cyprian was
corrupted with certaine abuses, wherein

mans imperfections shewed a rediculous
disparity, or rather an impious contrariety,
as a wise man without good workes, an
old man without religion, a poore man
proud, a seeming matron without honesty,
a noble man without vertue, a Christian
without piety, a Church-man without charity,
a Priest without learning, a state without
lawes, a Common wealth without gouernement:
Thus are men carried in the
world with contrary humors, and infested
with opposite vices.
               The world was taught three good rules by
Chilo: to know that it was Gods handyworke,
that it was made of nothing, and
shall be consumed to nothing: so man was
instructed to know himselfe, not to desire
much, and to keepe himselfe out of debt.
               The World is the toile of the couetous,
whose wealth is the witch of the wicked,
while heauen is the hope of the faithfull,
and grace the ioy of the blessed: Thus again
in the world we may say, that impatience
is the sting of nature, and presumption the
pride of sinne, while humility is the grace
of reason, and patience the blessing of
grace.
               
                  
The world is a shop of such wares, as 
                     •
                  heateth
the deluded buyers, who count wealth
as a iewell, pouerty a plague, conscience a
foole, care is a Lord of mis
                     •
                  ule, and will
the master of the sences.
               The world sheweth vs plainely, that beautie
is an eye-sore, learning a taske, valour
a heat of blood, reason a gift of God, Kings
Gods on earth, a Noble-man, a great man:
a Souldier, a stout man: a Courtier, a fine
man: a Lawyer, a wise man: a Merchant,
a rich man: a begger, a poore man: and an
honest man, a true man.
               The world cannot continue, except times
and seasons haue their courses: day and
night make their changes, labour and rest
comforts mens bodies, meate and sleepe
preserue life, punishment and reward proceed
from true iustice, and wisedome and
folly make the difference of all estates.
               The world telleth vs that a kingdome bringeth
care, learning is full of trouble, power
full of charge, youth full of action age full
of griefe: and content is the onely happinesse.
               The world is a laborinth of wit, the consumption
of vnderstanding, the pilgrimage

of patience, and the purgatory of
reason: so that in trufth he is happy, that
dwelleth in it to Gods glory, his owne
comfort, and the benefit of his neighbour:
and to conclude, the vse is good; but the
abuse dangerous.
            
            
               Woman.
               I long'd for dainties, was deceiu'd by lust:
               In one marr'd all men, made the world vniust.
               VVOman was the originall of mans destruction:
for he had not disobeyed
God, but by the enticement of the woman:
for the which God told him plainely,
hee was accursed and subiect to damnation.
               A woman is a stinking rose, a pleasing euill,
the mouse-trap of a mans soule, the thiefe
of his life, a flattering wound, a delicate
distraction, a sweete death: and the loue
of her hidden fire; a pleasing wound, a
sweete poyson, a bitter sweete, a delightfull
disease, a pleasant punishment, a flattering
death.
               
                  
Woman is the strength of will, the weakenesse
of vnderstanding, the exercise of patience,
the trouble of reason, the encrease
of number, the delight of vanitie, the pride
of beautie, the abuse of loue, the breder of
iealosie, and the deceite of trust and confidency.
               Woman is the wonder of nature: for shee
maketh two bodies one flesh, and two
hearts one soule: so that the husband and
wife truely louing, so conspire in all their
actions, that they haue in a manner, but
one motion: for loue maketh vnion, as
hate doeth seperation and deuision.
               Woman is a necessary ill, a pleasing yoakefellowe:
and a strong supportation, to
weake meanes of house-keeping; for as in
a teeme, except the oxen be ioyntly vnited
and draw together: the plough or cart
cannot orderly goe forward. So in housekeeping,
except man and wife doe louingly
agree, and ioyntly labour in their seueuerall
places to maintaine &amp; increase their
estates, all will quickly be ouerthrowne;
for a diuision of loue and action, makes a
dimunition of substance, or rather a dissipation.
               
                  
Woman againe is a purgatory on earth, and
with contrary humors quencheth the hoatest
loue, and breaketh the hardest heart;
for if she be honest, she will be imperious,
if faire, she wil be venerious: if foule, she is
loathsome: if a wanton, full of fraude or
treason: if proud, costly aboue thy ability:
if witty, impudent to shame thee▪ or make
thee weary: if sheepish, she will neither
increase thy commoditie, nor gouerne thy
family: if familiar and affable, she will bee
foolish and tell all: either she hath no good
qualitie, or such as are quite ouermatched
by the contrary.
               Woman that prooueth a good wife, commonly
continueth a good mother, so that
the husband hath ioy, the children comfort,
the seruants contentment, and all the
house establishment.
               Woman must auoide all occasions of bad
rumors: for it is not enough that shee bee
honest, but that she bee so reputed and reported;
because the honour of a man dependeth
on his wiues loyaltie, and the reproch
of children, on the report of her dishonestie.
               Woman is the weaker vessell, and therefore

must man beare with the infirmitie of his
wife, as she endure the impatience and imperfection
of her husband.
               Woman is the author to her husband of
much good or ill, as she is indued with the
grace of God, or the malice of the diuell.
               Woman faire, and proude, and wanting wisdome:
is a looking-glasse of vanitie, and
a miror of inconstancy, idle, fantastick, desirous
of nouelties, disdainfull, chargeable,
a daintie feeder, a gadder, a talker, and euery
way irregular.
               Woman is seldome pitied in her teares: for
they commonly proceede either from anger,
or deceit; anger, that she cannot bee
reuenged: deceite, that shee cannot haue
her will in wantonnesse and libertie.
               Woman is endued with the same vertues as
man: for there hath beene as valiant, wise,
godly, magnaninous, pollitick, iudicious,
great spirited, and learned women as men:
yea, our histories are filled with the glorious
actions and famous conquests of wo
                     •
                  
as well as Emperours, or other persons of
honour, elloquence, learning, and iudgement.
            
            
               
               A whore.
               I am of shame a scorge, of sinne a sincke:
               My lifes-flame quencht, it like a snuffe doeth stincke.
               A whore hath many significant names,
as filth, curtisan, queane, strumpet,
puncke, light-hus-wife, concubine, leman,
Ioue, mistresse, and infinite other fictions,
according to mens fantasies; but all concluding,
breach of chastity, and contempt
of loyaltie, either to virginitie or mariage.
               A whore once prostituted to lust, will hardly
bee reclaimed to honesty: and there is
more hope of a branded thiefe, then an impudent
whore.
               A whore is like a horse-leach: for as it sucketh
the blood from corrupted bodies and
neuer falles off, till it swel with fuln
                     •
                  sse. So
playes the whore with our substance, and
best blood in our bodies, and neuer leaues
a miserable besotted man, till she haue fethered
her nest, and filled her coffers: nay,
till shee hath emptied the bones of marrow,

and the purse of money.
               A whore is knowne by the boldnesse of her
face, pride of her eies, wantonnes of countenance,
vnconstancy of her lookes, gaudines
of cloathes, giddines of gate, immodesty
of her gesture, loosenesse of her behauiour,
licenciousnes of her words, leawdeof
her actions.
               A whore is of the nature of Astrology,
an art of all men embraced and practised;
so a whore is railed and reuiled of euery
body for her 
                     •
                  ilthy conditions, and yet
courted and embraced for her wanton allurements,
and pleasing delight.
               A whore studieth for nothing but wealth,
brauery, and expences: yet she is neuer the
neerer to attaine to any setled estate, nor a
iot the richer at the yeeres end.
               A whore is not to bee trusted with a secret,
nor can be 
                     •
                  ilent in a matter of importance
especially if a bribe whisper her in the eare
and a greater reward entise her to discouerie.
               A whore bringeth a foole into the house of
slaughter, and he that goeth into her chamber,
is like an Oxe led by the Butcher.
               A whore cannot bee better compared then

to deepe pits, from whence it is 
                     •
                  asier to
keepe ones selfe from falling, then once
fallen to recouer out: so it is more easie to
absent thy selfe and neuer remember her,
then by her company to content and satiat
thy desire.
               A whore is compared to coales taken out
out of the fire, which either burne a man or
besmeere him: so doe whores either consume
our estates, or our credites.
               A whore amongst many other hath one
louely condition, that in her louers misery
she will laugh and sing, and at his intreaties
she will fleere and scorne.
               A whore reprehended for her incontinencie
standeth more stiffely then any other on
tearmes of honesty, and reproued for her
shamelesse and filthy desire of change and
varietie, iustifies with fearefull oathes her
constant fidelitie.
               A whore supposeth to redeeme and wipe aaway
her filthy crimes, by going to
Church and giuing Almes: but let her
know that the sacrifise of a theefe, is as if
he had offered the head of Dog, and the
charitie of a strumpet, as the stinke of a
dunghill.
               
                  
A whore hath this vsuall impediment, that
she cannot repent. For while youth lasteth
shee is loath to leaue her profitable sport,
and when both faile, she sees that of a yong
whore she may turne an old bawd, and so
still liue by the trade.
               A whore that is mercenary, will hardly bee
drawn from her filthy life, she is so fast linked
to the loue of money, otherwise many
faultie women repent their first o
                     ••
                  ence,
and become of bad maides very good
wiues.
               A whore thinkes her selfe excellent wittie,
when she can practise disloyaltie cunningly,
and ouerreach her friendes by her subtiltie.
               The finest whore is but a filthy drippingpan,
so often set to the fire, till she is caught
by the flame, and so burnes her selfe, and
her basting sticke ere she hath done.
            
         
         
            
            AN EPITOME
OF GOOD MANNERS,
extracted out of the treatise of
Mr. Iohn Della Casa called
Galatea.
            
               ALthough vertues and high exalted
qualities seeme to haue
a greater praise: then common
rudiments, and simple
precepts of life; yet because
euery mans arme cannot reach at so high a
branch, nor capacitie attaine to so great
knowledge, and that good mauners is more
necessary, and to bee put in practise in all
conuersations. I will here briefly shew you
by way of short and ciuill admonitions,
how a man should demeane himselfe with
acceptation to all noble societies.
            
               
               Good Manners preferreth as much
as Vertue.
               First then to encourage thee the more;
beleeue it, that many men haue attained to
great preferment by cheerefull and pleasant
behauiour alone, when as diuers endowed
with vertues of admiration, haue not yet
stepped so high on the degrees of honour.
Contrariwise, rude and vnciuill fashions
make men both odious and combersome:
for though there bee no lawes nor punishments
articulated against them: yet is nature
a principall corrector in his kinde, and
maketh them vnsociable to mutuall commerces,
and others of moderate demeanor
affraide of their rudenesse; for as men doe
commonly runne away affrighted at sauage
and cruell beasts, not seeming once to haue
any feare of gnats, and flies, and other lesser
vermine: yet by reason of continuall annoyance,
they complaine more of these, then the
other. So fareth it in the hate of wicked and
impious liuers: but yet by being continually
conuersant with one another, wee are
more affraide of vnmannerly and vntaught

companions, then tyrannous and dissolute
liuers.
            
            
               Flattery.
               Next to frame our selues conformable
to societie, wee must liue in such a fashion,
that we may please others, and not satisfie
our mindes altogether: wherein discretion
must so measure our actions, that as we
ought to be farre from palpable flattery incident
to a Parasite: so must we be remote
from deprauing inuection, the office of a decractor
and railer.
            
            
               Loathsome and filthy things.
               We must not onely refraine from such
things as be foule, filthy, loathsome, and nastie:
but not so much as name them; so that
neither the common sence of other men
should be offended, nor the conceite and
imagination with matter vnpleasant distasted:
as for example; a Gentleman ought
not openly to thrust his handes into his priuities,
to reach to his head, or any part of his
body, as if he fished for a louse, to ease himselfe
in publicke view, and so trusse himselfe

in a brauery, to wash his hands on a sudden:
as giuing the company notice, where he had
beene, to shew them any loathsome thing,
as hee passeth by the way: nor to offer to
their nose any filthy or stincking weede,
which may annoy, or displease their patience.
            
            
               Vnpleasant sounds.
               We must not grinde the teeth, whistle,
make noises, nor offend the eares with any
harsh and vnpleasant sound: nay we should
not offer to sing aloud, especially hauing an
vntun
                     •
                  able voyce; as for coffing, sneezing,
and yawning, they bee things so vnsauory,
that a man is bound to auo
                     •
                  de them in publicke,
or at least restraine himselfe as much
as nature may suffer, and tollerate; but the
principall reason is, the vile-pending the
company, and taking vpon our selues a greater
state of preheminence, then either they
will allow, or falleth to their proportion to
carry.
            
            
               Blowing the nose.
               We must not blow our nose too lowde,
nor open the hand-chercher at all to shewe

any nasty filthinesse, nor lay it to the cuppe
where another meanes to drinke, nor smell
to the meate, which he determines to eate,
no not to that, which thou hast chosen for
thy selfe, no nor reach the cuppe or meate,
which thou hast tasted to any other of thy
owne voluntary will, except such a familiar
friend, as dependeth on thee for loue, or obseruation:
for though they seeme small offences,
yet beleeu it, slight stripes haue power
to slay fast enough.
            
            
               Vnmanner linesse at the table.
               We must auoide all rauenous and greedy
feeding, all vnmannerly besmeering the fingers,
all filthy bedawbing the napkins, wiping
our face with them, sweating with eating,
blowing in drinking, and rubbing our
fingers on bread, table-cloth, or any other
place vnbefitting; nor should a man blow
vpon any thing to deliuer it to another, as
the dust of a roasted appell, or a fether from
ones ruffe and such like: for winde was neuer
without water, nor offer thy hand-kercher
to another, nor come so neere in thy
talke as to brtath in ones face, nor indeede

any thing which may breede offence, or
breach of friendship.
            
            
               Carelesnesse of the company.
               We must doe nothing in our ciuill conuersation,
which may giue a distast to those
with whom we keepe company of vile-pending,
or smally estimating them; as sleeping,
where men be met to commune, and confer
together; rising to walke vp and downe,
when others are disposed to sit and complaine
to on another, or dispute the matter;
stretching our selues and yawning with other
rude iestures, pulling out of letters to
reade, as if some great affaires importuned,
and were committed vnto them: payring of
nailes, dromming with fingers, whistling,
singing betweene the teeth, humming, shuffling
with the feete, when other men would
sollace themselues otherwise: sitting with
turning our taile to our next neighbour, lolling
with our feete vpon a table, or higher
forme: leaning on ones shoulder, punching
with the elbowe at euery abrupt sentence
we vtter, and such like, all which shew a certaine
carelesnesse of the company, and setting

at nought such, as we conuerse withall

               Decency of apparrell.
               We must apparell our selues meete for
our age and calling, and not haue other men
in contempt by our singularitie, but fasshion
our selues to common vse, though

when all men weare hansome beards,
we should not shaue our selues with strange
attire of other countries, or

               We must not be too tedious in trimming
or apparelling our selues: for it either shews
a pride or curiositie, which is as ill a vice:
nor must we haue any busines to doe, when
we should fit downe at the table, or seeme

to be angry, that the meate is brought in so
soone, when yet all the company would
faine be at dinner, nor show a manifest pride

the hansommest chamber, going in a doores
or vp staires without some ceremonious
proffer, and sports and exercises, as if they
were rather masters of the company, then
companions.
            
            
               Brawling and railing with seruants.
               We must not brawle and raile too much
at the seruants: much lesse strike, especially
when company is within hearing; For either
it shewes a froward and teasty humor,
or foolish pride, which is of all other vnbesitting
a Gentleman, who should boast of
nothing so much as an humble minde, pleasant
affabilitie, and well sorted curtesie: nor
should wee make our table a place of vnkindnesse,
quarrell, or chaffing; for mirth
and solace is the physition of feeding, and
to be then froward or fromward, is meerely
an extremity, and breach of true friendship.
Againe we must not be too sad or lumpish,
but pleasant and familiar, so that the company

may suppose themselues welcome,
and proceed in their entertainment, this custome
must be likewise obserued in all ciuill
entercourse, and salutations: so that when
a question is demanded, no dogged and vnmannerly
reply must followe: no musing
nor extraordinary contemplation amongst
friendes or company: no nicenesse, or effeminate
daintinesse: no dangerous exceptions,
if friendes or companions should talke
somewhat displeasing, or doe something,
which might be forborne.
            
            
               Filthy talke, ribaldry, prophanation, vnseasonable
speeches.
               We must not defile our communication
with filthy and obsceane talke: prophaning
Gods name, or intermingling religious secrets,
with common entercourses, and vnseasonable
conference, and out of time, as
telling Fryers sermons to yong Ladies disposed
to be merry, or talking idly when the
company is in serious discourse, is a thing to
be auoided: as also at feasts and banquets
to make relation of wounds, slaughters, or
other tr

                  gicall accidents is vnciuill, and a

custome to be reclaimed: nor should wee
take vppon vs the discouery of our visions
and dreames, as many will doe with a tedious
curiositie, and vnseemely confidence:
but of all other things an honest Gentleman
must not dishonest himselfe with any
fiction or lie, especially of his owne inuention,
either in hope of vaineglorious prayse
of a good wit, or grosse flattery toward any
in presence: nay in relating newes, and the
report of other men, he must bee very circumspect,
and obserue such cautions; as
may induce the company to good and worthy
attention, and not to scorne or deride
him, either for his owne vanitie in ambitiously
discouering some commendable exploytes,
or his detracting others in proclaiming
their infamie.
            
            
               Counterfeiting of greatnesse, Comparisons.
               We must not counterfeit a greater port
and brauery, then God hath established vs
in, nor yet practise high and magnificent
gestures, nor ouer-rich and costly apparell:
nor ouer-topping and discountenancing
our inferiours, we must not boast of our hohonour,

Ancestors, wealth, exploits, nor contest
with the company by way of vnequall
comparisons, either to braue our betters, or
insult ouer others of meaner condition: nor
are we too too remisly to imbase our selues,
lest it tend to a secreter pride by contemning
what euery man thinketh due vnto vs: as
if we deserued farre better, and yet seemed
to disclaime it, till it were fully offred vnto
vs: nor should wee refuse in modesty to tell
the truth, either concerning our selues or
others: but wee must auoide a prolixitie of
speech, and fetching about, when we are demanded
our aduise: there is likewise a fault
to be auoided amongst gentlemen, proceeding
from an abiect minde; which is when a
man doth embase himselfe farre lower then
his place, to the trouble and combersomnes
of the whole company: but sometimes it
proceeds from folly and ridiculous custome
with them, and then it is lamentable.
            
            
               Ceremonies.
               We must auoid all extraordinary ceremonies,
or curious entertainements, as vncouering
the head, bowing the body in token of

reuerence, vsing high titles and stiles of honour,
kissing the hands, embracing the body,
and such like; all which, as they may be

                     •
                  sed, are decencies, and things of meere necessity
and of duty: but for euery idle fellow
in foppish meetings, and saluting one another
without distinction of time, place, and
persons, anticke like to confound them is
meerly discrepant from generosity and good
manners: therefore is it not a lamentable
case for a Gentleman to honor them in titles,
whom they despise in their hearts, and with
verball protestations offer seruice, when yet
wee thinke our selues worthy to command
and controll them: yea, sometimes it happens,
that encountring with a stranger, how
base and vnworthy soeuer he be: yet we giue
him all the attributes of noble and high exalted,
yeelding as much as vnto our best
deseruers, yet I cannot denie, but there be titles
by priuiledge according to the degrees
of men, as Princes, Lords, Gentlemen, Officers,
and such like, wherein yet wee must obserue
a decorum, but not disperage the worthy
by bestowing their graces on the vnworthy.
            
            
               
               Ceremonies for Profit, Duty, Vanity.
               Wee must therefore consider, that Ceremonies
are vsed for Profit, Duty, or Vanity.
For profit as we see in flatterers, who sooth
our humors in euery thing, not in regard
of our wils, but because they themselues
should be recompenced, wherein a Gentleman
should not be seene: for it cannot
be otherwise, then a lye; and a man cannot
honestly make a lie, nor seeke by vertuous
courses to pleasure himselfe, by the hurt of
another.
            
            
               Duty.
               But ceremonies of dutie are not to bee
left according to the ciuell custome of the
place, and therefore we say, you, and not
thou, to men of good sort: so in the rest, we
must seeke to please others, as well as our
selues, although sometimes we can yeeld no
probable reason for the sam

of long former times, it is no more to
be practised, then to send vs to eate akorns;
because in the beginning of barbarisme we
did so.
            
            
               Vanity.
               We must not be touched with ceremonies
of vanity or pride, wherin custome of conntries
is to be obserued: for what is conueniēt
at Naples, being a City of Nobles and Gentlemen,
is not so requisite in Florence and
Leuca, places consisting of Merchants, and
inferior degrees, as also because in Veni

there is an extraordinary kinde of kissing,
and saluting one another, by reason of pleasing
one another, in giuing their ba

               Combersomenesse.
               Ceremonies are also to be restrained, that
breed cōbersomnes, wherin the circumstāce
of time, age, and condition, must be respected:
for a Iudge need not vse such humility
as another, an old man as a young, a country-man
as a courtier, a seruant as a stranger,
and diuers others: for where men exspect a
duty, they care for no ceremonies, and where
they respect them, they are also tied to decencies:
for as curtesy and humility are
gracefull euen to inferiors: so too much affectation
and foppish motions ten
                     •
                   to flattery,
and make vs mocked with the titles of
double diligence.
            
            
               Booke Ceremonies.
               For when men are cunningly courted, they
are weary of it, disdaine it, and herein is great
reason, because these glauering fellowes doe
thereby shew, that they estimate the party,
as a vaine and arrogant person, or a simple
and shallow-witted gull: we must therefore
take heed of Booke Ceremonies, which in

                  Spaine of all other places are vsed, yea, euen
to the selling of them for money, and obseruing
how this man must bee spoken vnto,
that Nobleman saluted, that Lord exalted,
that woman magnified, &amp;c. So that nothing
passeth without prescription, which when
ignorant men haue got once, they practice
with immoderate basenesse, folly, and cow

               Slandering, Quarrelling, and Wrangling.
               We must not slander or depraue another
mans doings: no nor repine at our neighbors
prosperity: for therein we shall imitate
the Oxe that goreth with his hornes, or striketh
with his feet: All quarrelling, wrangling,
and ouerthwarting must be auoided:
for as in a combat the victory is the principall
end of the fight; so in verball contentions
wee endeuor to seeme to be in the right
and preuaile, as more iudicious then another,
so that the gaining the cause in trifling
matters, doth many times loose the loue of
a faithfull friend: for who will be acquainted
with such, that euery houre are contentious,
and giue vs cause rather to stand vppon

our guard to preuent a quarrell, then to
desire conuersation to maintaine our delight
and contentment.
            
            
               Counselling and Reprouing.
               We must be carefull how, and whom we
goe about to counsell or reproue: for commonly
it proceeds from self loue and pride,
that we are wiser then they; yea, sometimes
it seemeth a checke to him for his ignorance
and folly, so that this interm
                     •
                  dling with other
folkes businesse, is a dangerous matter:
for hee that counselleth, hath euer a good
conceit of himself, and an ill opinion against
the other, and he that reproueth others, seemeth
as though hee had no faults of his
owne.
            
            
               Scoffes and Scornes.
               We must not scorn or scoffe at any man: for it
is a greater signe of contempt &amp; disdaine to
scorne a man, then to do him an open wrong.
For as much as wrongs may be done either of
choller, or of some couetous mind or other;
and the nature and effect of a scorne, is properly

to take a contentation and pleasure to
doe another shame and villany, though it
doe our selues no good in the world: therefore
we must neither reproue the blemishes
of nature in other men, nor make a sport to
counterfet their imperfections, &amp; although
there bee some difference betweene a scoffe
and a mocke, as that a scorne sheweth alway
despight, and a mocke may be done in pastime▪
yet must a Gent, auoide both the one
and other, or at least be limited in his mirth,
that it turne not to shaming the party, and
so may be counted as ill, as a scorne or depriua
                     •
                  ion.
For it many times chanceth, that in
boording and iesting one takes in sport, the
other strikes againe in earnest, so that a
mocke is no better then a deceit, and he that
seekes to purchase good will, and be well
thought on, must not make himselfe cunning
in mockes and iests, and yet a pretty
fashion of mirth is sometimes maintained
from pleasant iests and conceits, and a good
wit is both commendable and allowable:
but herein must be a great gouernment and
moderation, because it cannot be good to
iest in matters of weight, and much lesse in
matters of shame, Againe, where it is out of

time for to laugh, there to vse any iests or
dalliance, it hath a very cold grace: besides,
iests must bite the hearers like a sheepe, and
not like a dogge: for if it pinch as the bite of
a dogge, it shall be no more a iest, but a
wrong: so then iests be no other things but
deceits, and deceit cannot be wrought but of
men that haue fine and ready wits, and very
pleasant. For to iest or taunt is not currant
with euery man that will, but onely with
them that can.
            
            
               Counterfetting, Discourse at large.
               We must not for other mens pleasures dishonest,
and dishonor our selues, as to counterfet
to bee fooles, and vnsauery dolts, nor
talke at randome with farre fetch discourses,
and absurd relations, onely as I said before,
a man may bee merry conceited, and vse a
pleasant liberty in speech amongst his equals,
as also vpon occasion, discourse at
large with well disposed speeches vttered
to purpose, concerning the trauels of forren
places, or the H
                     •
                  story of Liues, or the relation
of troubles, or such like circumstantiall
matter, wherein it behoues them to vse

proper names, and not to change them after,
but aboue all not to say any thing, which vnsaid
in silence, would make the tale pleasant
enough, and peraduenture glue it a better
grace to leaue it out; yet sometimes men
may dispose and order their tale first with
by names, and then rehearse them as neede
require, that are proper, as for example who
would describe coue
                     •
                  ousnesse, or any other

                  sonate a name of any
man notoriously infamed for the same, or
gloriuusly exalted for the other.
            
            
               Plaine Words, No double signification,
Apt wordes.
               Our words must also be plaine, that all
the company may easily vnderstand them,
and withall for sound and sence they must
be apt and sw

                  ubtfull and ambiguous aenigmas
or amphibologies, to put the hearers in a
maze for the interpretation. They should
be also apt and proper to that thing we goe
about to deliuer, whereby the discourse shal
be more pleasing, and the iudgement of the

discourser more commendable.
            
            
               Forren Languages.
               We must auoid all talking in forren languages,
to him that vnderstandeth not what
we say, nor should we vse it at all, but when
it is needfull for vs to be vnderstood, and
meerely when necessity enforceth to vse
them. For without controuersie, our owne
is more naturall vnto vs, and addeth a grace
to euery discourse.
            
            
               Words dishonest in their meaning.
               Besides this, it becommeth euery honest
Gentleman to eschew those words that haue
no honest meaning: for the goodnesse of
words consisteh either in their sound, or
pronouncing, or in their sence and interpretation:
so that a man must not onely beware
of vnhonest and filthy talke, but also of that
which is base and vile, and especially where
a man talketh, and discourseth of great and
high matters: as for example, to scratch the
scabbes of sinne, to name weomen of the
world scuruy whore
                     •
                  , and infinite of this

sort, wherein wee must auoide the filthines
of speech, and rather accustome our selues
to such gentle and courteous speeches, and
so sweete, that they may haue no manner of
bitter tast in them: nay as I said in the reprehension
of sinne, and discoursing of pleasant
matters; we must be moderat, &amp; vse couert
tearmes and descriptions. Moreouer, a man
should not bring a mans faith and honesty
in question and doubt: but if a man promise
you any thing and doe not performe it, you
shall rather impute it to forgetfulnesse, then
thrust out any stings of complaint, anger, or
choller; you should therefore neuer speake
before you haue first considered and laid the
plot in your minde, what it is you haue to
say; for in so doing your talke shall be well
deliuered, and not borne before the time.
            
            
               Voyce and tongue must be pleasant.
               We must also beware that our voyce be
not hoarse and shrill, and when wee laugh
and sport in any sort, wee must not cry out,
and scrich like the pulley of 
                     •
                   well: nor yet
speake in our yawning: so that if a man doe
flatter by nature, or become hoarse through

imperfections, it is most meete for him to be
sparing of speech, and rather silent, and attentiue
to others, then forward to discourse
with displeasing; it is also an ill noyce to
heare a man raise his speech high like to a
common cryer, and yet not so low and softly,
that he that hearkens, shal not heare him:
nay, if he be inforced to repeate his tale againe:
he must doe it soberly, and not as if
he were angry indeed: our manner of speech
must be also disposed, as the common vse is;
and not vnsorted, disordered, and scattered
confusedly, as many doe vpon a brauery
like a Scriuener, or some pedanticall schoolmaster:
nor must wee preposterously place
our words, as versefiers may doe: nor should
we vse the pompe, brauery, and affectation
incident to others; but withall we must take
heed of such base speech, as vile meane people,
or as we say the rascall scab accustome;
in one word, as wee haue partly shewed before:
we must fashion our selues like Gentlemen,
and professors of ciuilitie.
            
            
               Talkatiue fellowes.
               As the defects of slowe and fumbling
spe
                     •
                  ches are to bee reformed: so must wee

not talke too fast, nor too much, as many
talkatiue fellowes, who out of vanitie loue
to heare themselues speake, and trouble all
the company; there is another fault likewise
to be redressed, and that is interrupting
another mans discourse, which must
not bee: for nothing mooues a man sooner
to anger, then when he is suddenly cut short
of his wil, and his pleasure, be it neuer so little
&amp; of smal importance: If any man therefore
be in a redinesse to tell his tale, it is no
good manners to enterrupt him, nor to oppose
against him, although hee entermin
gled some lie or fiction in his discourse: nor
must you diuert the hearers from any mans
discourse to a new begunne speech, and tale
of your owne; for as the interrupting of a
man is, as if you should take him by the
sleeue, and stop his course beginning to run,
so to aske abrupt questions in the midst of
a tale, or offer to beginne another discourse,
when a man is telling a story or such like, is
as if you should shuffle stones against him
which goeth. For euery man in his owne
conceit thinkes he can tell his tale well, although
for modesty sake he deny it: yet men
must take heede of ouer much talking; for

he must runne into some errors, and commit
many faultes, that talkes too much, and
he that talks all the talke to himselfe, would
after a sort prefer himselfe aboue them that
heare him, as a master would be aboue his
schollers, and therefore it is not good manners
for a man to take vpon him a greater
state, then doeth become him.
            
            
               Silence.
               Wee must not also bee ouermuch silent:
for to vse silence in place where other men
walke too and fro, is in manner as much a
fault, as not to pay your scot and lot as other
men doe; therefore it is good manners
for a man to speake, and likewise to holde
his peace, as it comes to his turne, and occasion
requiers.
            
            
               A good grace.
               Wee must also vse a manner of grace in
our speech and actions; For it is not enough
for a man to do things that be good, but he
must also haue a care he doe them with a very
good grace: and a good grace is nothing

else, but such a manner of light as I may call
it, as shineth in the aptnesse of things set in
good order, and well disposed one with another
and perfectly knit and vnited together,
without which proportion and measure,
euen that which is good is not faire,
and the fairenes it selfe is not pleasant.
            
            
               Of Vices, curled haire, sweet smels, custome,
condition, country.
               Wee must not offend any man with our
vices; for as they be foule and filthy in themselues;
so they produce shamefull effects,
and turne to our losse and reproach; it shall
then be necessary for Gentlemen, and men
of good behauiour to haue a regard to this
measure, I speake of in going, standing, sitting,
iesture, apparell, port, silence, rest and
action; for a man must not apparell himselfe
like a woman: as in their haire and beardes
frisled and curled with bod-kins: their face,
necke, and handes painted or starcht; their
perfumes so hot as a daintie strumpet, and
themselues meerely effeminate and womannish.
As for apparell spoken of before, wee
must vse them according to the fashion,
and our calling: for we must not take vpon

vs to alter custome at our will: for time doth
beget them, and time doth also weare them
out: yea, wee should apparell according to
the countrey we liue in, for what peraduenture
is allowed in Verona, perchance would
not be suffered in Venice.
               
            
            
               Comlinesse in going.
               We must not run, nor goe too fast in the
streete, least it make one sweate and puffe,
which is too vnseemly for a Gentleman, nor
yet are we to goe so soft and demurely as a
maide: neither should we shake the armes,
or writh the body, mince it: or walke with
high gate, and lifting vp the leg, nor stampe
with the feete, nor goe as it were splay-footed,
nor stroake vp the stockins in going,
nor stare in ones faee, nor looke vp too high
nor muse too lumpishly, nor doe any thing
vnseemely when wee would bee professed
Gentlemen, who should be masters of true
ciuilitie, good manners and curtesie.
               Many other things I could here relate: as
a table, wherein a true life is pensilled our,
and delineated for example and immitation:
but because it would bring mee along,

as it were into a confused iourney, I will desist
from trauelling in vnknowen waies, and
wading further in the deepe, then I shall be
able to recouer the shore; and so I leaue with
these few cautions, and abbreuiated principles,
and hope you haue the discretion
to retire to greater volumes,
and better direction, if
these be not fully
satisfactory.
