            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            TO THE
Right Honorable
Henry Earle of
Huntingdon, Lord
Haſtings, Hungerford, Botreaux
Molines &amp; Moiles,
his Maieſties Lieu-tenant in the
Counties of Leiceſter and Rutland

                  RIGHT Honorable
I haue
vndertaken a
great taske to
teach men how to be happy
in this life: I haue vndertaken
and performed it:

Wherein I haue followed
Seneca and gone beyond
him; followed him as a
Philoſopher, gone beyond
him as a Chriſtian, as a
Diuine. Finding it a true
cēſure of the beſt Moraliſt,
that they were like to goodly
ſhips, graced with great
titles the Saue-gard, the
Triumph, the Good-ſpeed,
and ſuch like, when
yet they haue beene both
extreamely Sea-beaten and
at laſt wracked. The volume
is little, perhaps the
vſe more; I haue euer
thought according to the
Greeke Prouerbe 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               .
What it is,

euen iuſtice challengeth it
to him, to whom the Author
hath deuoted himſelfe:
The children of the bondman
are the goods of the
parents Maiſter. I humbly
betake it to your Honors
protection, and your Honor
to the protection of the
higheſt.
            
               Your Honors
moſt humbly
deuoted in all
duty and ſeruice.
Ioſ. Hall.
            
         
      
      
         
            
            
            HEAVEN
vpon earth
or
of true peace of
minde.
            
               Sect. 1.
               
                  WHen I had
ſtudiouſly
red ouer the
morall writings
of ſome wiſe Heathen,Cenſure of Philoſophers. eſpecially thoſe of
the Stoicall profeſſion, I
muſt confeſſe I found a
little enuie and pitie ſtriuing

together within
me: I enuied nature in
them, to ſee her ſo witty
in deuiſing ſuch plauſible
refuges for doubting
and troubled mindes: I
pitied them to ſee that
their carefull diſquiſition
of true reſt, led them
in the end but to meere
vnquietneſſe: VVherein
mee thought, they
were as hounds ſwift of
foote, but not exquiſite
in ſent, which in an haſty
purſute take a wrong
waie, ſpending their
mouthes, and courſes in
vaine. Their praiſe of
geſſing wittily they ſhall

not leeſe, their hopes
both they loſt, and whoſoeuer
followes them. If
Seneca could haue had
grace to his wit, what
wonders would he haue
done in this kind? what
Diuine might not haue
yeelded him the chayre
for precepts of Trāquillitie
without any diſparagement?
As he was,
this he hath gained. Neuer
any Heathen wrote
more diuinely, neuer any
Philoſopher more
probably. Neither would
I euer deſire better Maſter
if to this purpoſe I
needed no other miſtres

then nature. But this in
truth is a taske, which
nature hath neuer without
preſumption vndertaken,
and neuer performed
without much imperfection.
Like to thoſe
vaine and wandring Empiricks
which in Tables
and pictures make great
oſtētatiō of cures, neuer
approouing their skill to
their credulous patients.
And if ſhe could haue
truely effected it alone.
I know not what employment
in this life ſhe
ſhould haue left for
grace to buſie her ſelfe
about, nor what priuiledge

it ſhould haue
beene here below to be
a Chriſtian, ſince this that
we ſeeke is the nobleſt
worke of the ſoule, and
in which alone conſiſts
the only Heauen of this
world; this is the ſumme
of all humane deſires,
which when we haue
attained, then onely we
begin to liue, and are ſure
we cannot thence forth
liue miſerably. No maruell
then if al the heathen
haue diligently ſought
after it, many wrot of it,
none attained it. Not Athens
muſt teach this leſſon,
but Ieruſalem.
            
            
               
               Sect. 2.
               
                  YET ſomething
Grace ſcorneth
not to learne of
Nature,What Tranquillitie is, &amp; wherein it conſiſts. as Moſes may
take good counſell of a
Midianite. Nature hath
euer had more skill in
the end, then in the way
to it, and whether ſhe
haue diſcourſed of the
good eſtate of the mind,
which we call Tranquillitie
or the beſt which is
happineſſe hath more
happely geſſed at the generall
definition of them
then of the meanes to

compaſſe them. She
teacheth vs therefore
without controlement,
that the Tranquillitie of
the mind is, as of the Sea
and weather, when no
winde ſtirreth, when the
waues doe not tumultuouſly
riſe and fall vpon
each other, but when the
face both of the Heauen
and waters is ſtill, faire,
and equable. That it is
ſuch an euen diſpoſition
of the hart, wherein the
ſcoales of the mind neither
riſe vp towards the
boame, through their
owne lightneſſe, or the
ouer-weening opinion

of proſperity, nor are too
much depreſſed with any
loade of ſorrow; but
hanging equall and vnmooued
betwixt both;
giue a man libertie in all
occurrences to enioy
himſelfe. Not that the
moſt temperate minde
can be ſo the maiſter of
his Paſſions, as not ſomtimes
to ouer-ioy his
griefe, or ouer-grieue
his ioy, according to the
contrary occaſions of
both, for not the eueneſt
weights, but at their firſt
putting into the balance
ſomewhat ſway both
parts thereof, not without

ſome ſhew of inequalitie,
which yet after
ſome little motion, ſettle
themſelues in a meete
poyſe. It is enough that
after ſome ſudden agitation,
it can returne to
it ſelfe, and reſt it ſelfe at
laſt in a reſolued peace.
And this due compoſedneſſe
of minde we require
vnto our Trāquillitie,
not for ſome ſhort
fits of good moode,
which ſoone after ende
in diſcontentment, but
with the condition of
perpetuitie. For there is
no hart makes ſo rough
weather, as not ſometimes

to admitte of a
calme, and whether for
that he knoweth no preſent
cauſe of his trouble,
or for that he knoweth
that cauſe of trouble
is countervayled with as
great an occaſion of priuate
ioy, or for that the
multitude of euils hath
bred careleſſeneſſe, the
man that is moſt diſordered
finds ſome reſpits
of quietneſſe. The balances
that are moſt ill
matched in their vnſteddie
motions come to an
equalitie, but ſtay not at
it. The franticke man
cannot auoide the imputatiō
                  
of madnes, though
he be ſober for many
moones, if he rage in
one. So then the calme
minde muſt be ſetled in
an habitual reſt, not then
firme when there is nothing
to ſhake it, but
then leaſt ſhaken when it
is moſt aſſayled.
            
            
               Sect. 3.
               
                  WHence eaſily appears
how vainly
it hath beene
ſought either in ſuch a
conſtant eſtate of outward
thinges,Inſufficiency of humane precepts. as ſhoulde
geue no diſtaſt vnto the
minde, whiles all earthly
thinges varie with the

weather, &amp; haue no ſtay
but in vncertaintie, or in
the naturall temper of
the ſoule, ſo ordered by
humaine wiſdome, as
that it ſhould not be affected
with anie caſuall
euentes to either part;
ſince that cannot euer by
naturall power be held
like to it ſelfe; but one
while is cherefull, ſtirrīg,
&amp; redy to vndertake;
anotherwhile drouſie,
dull, comfortleſſe, prone
to reſt, wearie of it ſelfe,
loathing his own purpoſes,
his own reſolutions.
In both which, ſince the
wiſeſt philoſophers haue

grounded al the rules of
their tranquillitie, it is
plaine that they ſaw it a
farre off, as they did heauen
it ſelfe with a deſire
and admiratiō, but knew
not the way to it: Wherupon
alas, how ſleight &amp;
impotent are the remedies
they preſcribe for
vnquietnes. For what is
it that for the inconſtancie
and lazineſſe of the
minde ſtill diſpleaſing it
ſelfe in what it doth,Senecaes rules of Tranquillity abridged and
for that diſtemper thereof
which ariſeth frō the
fearefull, vnthriuing, and
reſtleſſe deſires of it, wee
ſhould euer be imploying

our ſelues in ſome
publike affaires, chooſing
our buſineſſe according
to our inclination,
and proſecuting
what we haue choſen?
wherewith being at laſt
cloied we ſhould retire
our ſelues and we are the
reſt of our time in priuat
ſtudies; that wee ſhould
make due comparatiue
trials of our own ability;
nature of our buſineſſes;
diſpoſition of our choſē
freends? that in reſpect
of Patrimonie we ſhould
be but careleſly affected,
ſo drawing it in as it may
be leaſt for ſhow, moſt

for vſe; remouing all
pompe, bridling our
hopes, cutting off ſuperfluities
for croſſes, to cō
                  ſider
that cuſtome will
abate and mitigate them
that the beſt thinges are
but chaynes &amp; burdens
to thoſe that haue them
to thoſe that vſe thē, that
the worſt thinges haue
ſome mixture of cōforte
to thoſe that grone vnder
them. Or leauing
theſe lower rudimentes
that are geuen to weake
and ſimple nouices to
examine thoſe golden
rules of mortality, which
are commended to the

moſt wiſe &amp; able practitioners,
what is it to accoūt
himſelfe as a tenant
at will? To fore-imagine
the worſt in al caſual matters?
To auoyde all idle
&amp; impertinent buſineſſes
all pragmaticall medling
with affairs of ſtate? not
ſo to fix our ſelues vpō any
one eſtate as to be impatiēt
of a change, to call
backe the mind frō outward
things, and draw it
home into it ſelf? to laugh
at &amp; eſteeme lightlie of
others miſdemeanours?
Not to depend vpon others
opiniōs but to ſtād
on our own bottoms? to

carry our ſelues in an honeſt
and ſimple truth, free
frō a curious hypocriſy,
&amp; affectation of ſeeming
other then we are, &amp; yet
as free frō a baſe kinde of
careleſnes? to intermeddle
retyrednes, with ſociety,
ſo as one may giue
ſweetneſſe to the other
and both to vs. So ſlackening
the minde that we
may not looſen it, &amp; ſo bē
                  ding
as we may not break
it? to make moſt of our
ſelues, chearing vp our
ſpirits with variety of recreations
with ſatiety of
meals, &amp; all other bodily
indulgence, ſauing that

kennes (me thinkes) can
neither beſeeme a wiſe
philoſopher to preſcribe
nor a vertuous man to
practiſe.Allowed

faire ſpokē at the
firſt cloſing, to be a perpetual
make-bate betwixt
God and man, betwixt a
mā &amp; himſelf. And this
enmity, tho it do not cō
                  tinually
ſhow it ſelfe, (as
the mortalleſt enemies
are not alwaies in pitched
fieldes one againſt the other)
for that the cōſciēce
is not euer clamorous, but
ſomwhile is ſilēt, otherwhiles

yet doth euer more work
ſecret vnquientnes to the
hart. The guilty man may
haue a ſeeming truce, a
tru peace he cānot haue.The torment of an euil cō
                     ſcience.
Look vpō the face of the
guilty hart, &amp; thou ſhalt
ſee it pale aud gaſtly; the
ſmiles &amp; laughters fainte

doubtful, &amp; ful of abrupt

the purpoſes &amp; motiōs
vnſteddy, &amp; ſauorīg

plainly that ſin is not
ſo ſmooth at hir firſt motions,
as turbulent afterwards:
hēce are thoſe vain
wearyīgs of places &amp; cō

torment. Nero, after
ſo much innocent blood
may change his bed
chamber, but his friendes
euer attend him, euer are
within him, and are as
parts of himſelfe. Alas
what auailes it to ſeeke
outward releefes, when
thou haſt thine executioner
within thee? If
thou couldeſt ſhift from
thy ſelfe thou mighteſt
haue ſome hope of eaſe;

now thou ſhalt neuer
wāt furies ſo long as thou
haſt thy ſelfe. Yea, what
if thou wouldſt runne
from thy ſelfe? Thy ſoule
may flie from thy body,
thy conſcience will not
flye from thy ſoule, nor
thy ſin from thy conſcience.
Some men indeed
in the bitternes of theſe
pangs of ſinne, like vnto
thoſe fondly impatient
fiſhes, that leape out of
the pan into the flame,
haue leapt out of this priuate
hell that is in themſelues,
into the common
pit, chooſing rather to
aduenture vpon the future

paines that they
haue feared, rather then
to indure the preſent horrors
they haue felt: wherin
what haue they gayned,
but to that hell
which was within them,
a ſecond hell without.
The conſcience leaues
not where the feends begin,
but both ioyne together
in torture. But there
are ſome firme &amp; obdurate
forheads, whoſe reſolution
can laugh their
ſinnes out of countenance.
There are ſo large
and able gorges as that
they can ſwallow and digeſt
bloody murders,

without complaint,
who with the ſame hāds
which they haue ſince
their laſt meale embrued
in blood can freely carue
to themſelues large mor
ſels at the next ſitting.The ioy and peace of the gilty but diſſembled.
Beleeueſt thou that ſuch
a mans heart laughs with
his face? will not he dare
to be an hypocrite that
durſt be a villaine? Theſe
glow-wormes when a
night of ſorrow compaſſes
them, make a lightſome
and fiery ſhow of
ioy, when if thou preſſe
thē thou findeſt nothing
but a cold &amp; crude moiſture.
Knoweſt thou not

that ther are thoſe, which
coūt it no ſhame to ſin,
yet coūt it a ſhame to be
checked with remorſe eſpecially
ſo as others eies
may deſcry? to whom repentāce
ſeems baſe-mindedneſſe,
vnworthie of
him that profeſſes wiſedome
and valour. Such a
man can greeue when
none ſees it but himſelf cā
laugh when others ſee it
himſelf feeles not. Aſſure
thy ſelfe that mans heart
bleedeth when his face
counterfaites a ſmile, hee
wears out many waking
hours when thou thinkſt

hee reſteth, yea as his
thoughts affoorde him
not ſleep, ſo his very ſleep
affordes him not reſt: but
while his ſenſes are tyed
vp, his ſin is looſe, repreſenting
it ſelfe to him in
his vglieſt ſhape &amp; frighting
him with horrible
and helliſh dreames.
And if perhaps cuſtome
hath bred a careleſneſſe
in him, (as we ſee that vſual
whipping makes the
childe not care for the
rod) yet an vnwonted extremity
of the blow ſhall
fetch blood of the ſoule,
and make the backe that

the blow is fetcht through
intermiſſion of remorſe,
the harder it muſt needs
alight. Therefore I may
confidently tell the careleſſe
ſinner as that bolde
Tragediā
                   ſaid to his great
Pompey. the time ſhal
come wherein thou ſhalt
fetch deepe ſighes, and
therefore ſhalt ſorrowe

ſorrowedſt not ſooner.
The fier of the cōſciēce

with a pile of greene
wood, that it cannot bee
diſcerned, whoſe moiſture
when once it hath

maiſtred, it ſends vp ſo

ſtopt the noſthrill for
bleeding in hope to ſtay
the iſſue when the blood
hindered in his former

be no recōciliation without

neither forget the iniurie
of ſinne, nor diſſemble
hatred. It is for men,
&amp; thoſe of hollow harts,
to make pretences contrary
to their affections:
ſoothings, and ſmiles, &amp;
imbracements where we
meane not loue, are from
weakeneſſe. Either for
that we feare our inſufficiencie
of preſent reuenge,
or hope for a fitter
oportunitie afterwards,
or for that we deſire
to make our further
aduantage of him to

whom wee meane euill.
Theſe courſes are not incident

power, who hauing the
command of all vēgeāce
can ſmite where hee liſt

If it could be perfect wee
owe it al in preſent, what
we are bound to doe in

for what we haue
not done in time paſt,
which while we offer to
God as good payment,

we do with the profane
traueller thinke to pleaſe
him with empty dateſhelles
in lieu of preſeruation
Where ſhal we then
finde a payment of infinite
value but in him
which is onely and all infinite.

he ſuffred in ſhort time
was proportionable to
what we ſhould haue ſuffred

He did all, ſuffred all,
paid all, he did it for
vs, we in him. Where
ſhall I begin to wonder

at thee O thou diuine &amp;
eternall peace-maker, the
ſauiour of men, the ānointed
of God, mediator betweene
God &amp; man, in
whom there is nothing
which doth not exceede
not only the conceit, but
the very wonder of Angels,
who ſaw thee in thine
humiliatiō with ſilēce, &amp;
adore thee in thy glory
with perpetuall prayſes
and reioyſinges. Thou
waſt for euer of thy ſelfe
as God, of the father as
the ſon; the eternall Son
of an eternall Father, not
later in being, not leſſe
in dignity, not other in

ſubſtance. Begotten without
diminotion of him
that begot thee while he
cōmunicated that wholy
to thee, which hee retained
wholy in himſelf,
becauſe both were infinite
without inequality
of nature, without diuiſion
of eſſēce when being
in this eſtate thine infinite
loue and mercy to
deperate mankind cauſed
thee O Sauiour to
empty thy ſelfe of thy
glory, that thou mightſt
put on our ſhame and miſery.
VVherfore not ceaſing
to be God as thou
wert, thou beganſt to bee

what thou wert not, mā;
to the ende that thou
mightſt be a perfect mediatour
betwixt God &amp;
man, which wert both
in one perſon; God that
thou mightſt ſatisfie, man
that thou mightſt ſuffer,
that ſince man had ſinned
God was offended,
thou which wert God
and man, mightſt ſatiſſy
God for man. None but
thy ſelfe which art the
eternall word, can expres
the depth of this miſtery
that God ſhould be cloathed
with fleſh, come
downe to men, and become
man, that man

might be exalted into
the higheſt heauens; and
that our nature might be
taken into the fellowſhip
of the deity. That he to
whom all powers in heauen
bowed, and thought
it their honor to be ſeruiceable,
ſhould come
downe to be a ſeruant to
his ſlaues, a ranſome for
his enemies; together
with our nature taking
vp our very infirmities,
our ſhame, our tormēts,
and bearing our ſinnes
without ſin. That thou
whom the heauens were
too ſtrait to containe,
ſhouldſt lay thy ſelfe in

an obſcure cratch, thou
which wert attended of
Angels, ſhouldſt be derided
of men, reiected
of thine owne, perſecuted
by Tyrants, tempted
with Diuels, betrayed
of thy ſeruant, crucified
among theeues, and
(which was worſe then
all theſe) in thine owne
apprehēſion for the time
as forſaken of thy father;
That thou whō our ſins
had pierced ſhouldſt for
our ſins both ſweat drops
of blood in the Garden,
and powre out ſtreames
of bloode vppon the
Croſſe. O the inualuable

purchaſe of our peace. O
ranſome enough for mo
worlds! Thou which
wert in the counſell of
thy Father the Lambe
ſlayne from the beginning
of tyme, camſt now
in fulnes of tyme to bee
ſlayne by man, for man;
Being at once the ſacrifice
offred, the prieſt that
did offer; and the God to
whome it was offred.
How gratiouſly didſt
thou both proclaime our
peace as a prophet in the
tyme of thy life vppon
earth, and purchaſe it by
thy blood as a prieſt at
thy death, and now confirmeſt

and applveſt it as
a King in heauē? By thee
only it was procured, by
thee it is profered. O
mercy without example,
without meaſure! God
offers peace to man, the
holy ſeekes to the vniuſt,
the potter to the clay,
the King to the traytor.
We are vnworthy that
we ſhoulde be receiued
to peace tho we deſired
it; what are wee then that
wee ſhoulde haue peace
offred for the receiuing?
An eaſy condition of ſo
great a benefit, hee requires

From hēce it is that
we are intereſſed in al that

Hence haue wee
frō God both forgiuenes

either peace or glory.
Hence of enemies we become
more then friends
ſonnes, and as ſōnes may
both expect and challenge
not onely carefull
prouiſion and ſafe
protection on earth,

but an euerlaſting patrimony
aboue. This fielde
is ſo ſpatious, that it were
eaſy for a man to leeſe
himſelfe in it, and if I
ſhould ſpend all my pilgrimage
in this walk, my
tyme would ſooner ende
then my way, wherein I
woulde haue meaſured
more paces, were it not
that our ſcope is not ſo
much to magnify the benefit
of our peace, as to
ſeeke how to obtaine it.
               Behold now,A corollary of the benefite of this receite. after we
haue ſought heauen and
earth where onely the
wearied Doue may find
an Oliue of Peace. The

apprehending of this alſufficiēt
ſatiſfactiō makes
it ours, vpon our ſatiſfaction
we haue remiſſion;
vpon remiſſion followes
reconciliation; vpon our
recōciliatiō, peace. Whē
therfore thy Conſcience
like a ſterne Sergeāt ſhall
catch thee by the throat,
and arreſt thee vpon
Gods debt, let thy onely
plea be that thou haſt already
paid it; Bring forth
that bloody acquittance
ſealed to thee from heauen
vpon thy true Faith,

looke of thy conſcience

changed into frendly

to haue croſſed
the old ſcrole of our ſins
if we preuent not the future,
yea the preſent;
very importunity of tētation
breeds vnquietnes.
Sin where it hath got an
haunt looketh for more,
as humours that fall towards
their old iſſue, &amp; if
it be not ſtrōgly repelled
doth neer as much vex vs
with ſoliciting as with
yeelding. Let others ēuy
their happines I ſhall neuer
thīk their life ſo much

quiet, whoſe dores are
continuall beaten, and
their morning ſleep broken
with early clients,
whoſe entries are dayly
thrōged with ſuters preſſing
neare for the next
audience; much leſſe that
through the remiſſe anſweres
are daily haunted
with traytors or other inſtrumēts
of villany, offering
their miſchieuous
ſeruice &amp; inciting them
to ſome peſtilent enterpriſe.
Such are tentations
to the ſoule. Whereof
it cannot be ridde ſo
long as it holds them in
any hope of entertainement

and ſo long they
will hope to preuaile,
while we giue them but
a cold and timorous denyall;
Suters are drawne
on with an eaſy repulſe;
counting that as halfe
grāted which is but faintly
gainſaid: Peremptory
anſweres can onely put
ſin out of heart for any ſecond
attempts. It is euer
impudent when it meets
not with a bold heart; hoping
to preuayle by wearying
vs, &amp; wearying vs
by intreaties. Let all ſuggeſtions
therefore finde
thee reſolute ſo ſhall thy
ſoule finde it ſelfe at reſt

for as the Diuell, ſo ſinne
his naturall brood flies away
with reſiſtance. To
which purpoſe all our
heddy &amp; diſordered affections,The ordering of affections.
which are the
ſecret factors of ſinne &amp;
Satan, muſt be reſtrained
by a ſtrong and yet temperate
command of reaſon
and Religion; theſe,
if they finde the reynes
looſe in their necks (like
to the wilde horſes of
that chaſt hunter, in the
Tragedie) carry vs ouer
hils and rocks, and neuer
leaue vs till we be diſincombred,
and they
breathleſſe; but contrarily

if they be pulled in
with the ſudden violence
of a ſtraite hand,
they fall to plunging,
and careering, and neuer
leaue till their ſaddle
be emptie, &amp; euen then
daungerouſly ſtrike at
their proſtrate rider. If
there be any exerciſe of
Chriſtian wiſedome, it
is in the menaging of
theſe vnrulie affections,
which are not more
neceſſarie in their beſt
vſe, then pernicious in
their miſ-gouernance.
Reaſon hath alwaies
beene buſie in vndertaking
this ſo neceſſarie

a moderation, wherein
altho ſhe haue preuailed
with ſome of colder temper,
yet thoſe which
haue beene of more ſtub
borne mettall, like vnto
growen ſchollers, which
ſcorne the ferula that ruled
their minority, haue
ſtill deſpiſed her weake
indeuours. Onely chriſtianity
hath this power
which with our ſecond
birth giues vs a new nature,
ſo that now, if exceſſe
of paſſions be naturall
to vs as men, the order
of them is naturall to
vs as Chriſtians. Reaſon
bids the angry man lay

ouer his Alphabet ere he
giue his anſwere; hoping
by this intermiſſion of
tyme to gaine the mitigation
of his rage. Hee was
neuer throughly angry
that can endure the recital
of ſo many idle letters.
Chriſtianity giues not
rules, but power to auoid
this ſhort madneſſe. It
was a wiſe ſpeech that is
reported of our beſt and
laſt Cardinall I hope, that
this Iland either did or
ſhall ſee, who when a skilfull
Aſtrologer vpon the
calculation of his natiuity
had fortold him ſome
ſpecialities, concerning

his future eſtate, anſwered:
ſuch perhaps I was
borne, but ſince that time
I haue beene borne again
&amp; my ſecond natiuitie
hath croſſed my firſt.
The power of nature is
a good plea for thoſe that
acknowledge nothing aboue
nature. But for a
Chriſtian to excuſe his
intemperatenes by his
naturall inclination, and
to ſay I am borne
cholericke, ſullen, amorous,
is an Apologie
worſe then the faulte.
Wherefore ſerues religion
but to ſubdue or gouerne

nature? Wee
are ſo much Chriſtians
as we cā rule our ſelues,
the reſt is but forme, and
ſpeculation. Yea the
very thought of our
profeſſion is ſo powerfull
that (like vnto that
precious ſtone) being
caſt into this ſea it aſſwayeth
thoſe inward
tempeſtes, that were
rayſed by the affections.
The vnregenerate
minde is not
capable of this power,
and therefore
through the continuall
mutinyes of his paſſions

cannot but be ſubiect to
perpetuall vnquietneſſe.
There is neither remedy
nor hope in this eſtate:
But the chriſtian ſoule
that hath inured it ſelfe
to the awe of God, &amp; the
exerciſes of true mortification,
by the onely looking
vp at his holy profeſſion
cureth the burning
venome of theſe fiery
ſerpents that lurke within
him. Haſt thou nothing
but nature? reſolue
to looke for no peace.
God is not prodigall to
caſt away his beſt bleſſings
on ſo vnworthy
ſubiects. Art thou a chriſtian?

Do but remember
thou art ſo: and then if
thou darſt if thou canſt,
yeelde to the exceſſe of
Paſſions.

Croſſes (vniuſtly termed
euils) as they are ſent of
him that is all goodnes
ſo they are ſent for good
and his end cannot bee
fruſtrate. What greater
good can be to the diſeaſed
man then fit and proper
Phyſicke to recure
him? Croſſes are the onely
medicines of ſicke
mindes. Thy ſounde
body carryes within it
a ſicke ſoule; thou feeleſt
it not perhappes
ſo much more art thou
ſicke and ſo much more
daungerouſly: Perhaps

thou laboureſt of ſome
plethorie of pride, or
of ſome dropſie of Couetouſneſſe,
or the Staggers
of inconſtancy, or
ſome feuer of luxurie,
or conſumption of enuye,
or perhaps of
the lethargie of idleneſſe,
or of the phrenſie
of anger: It is a
rare ſoule that hath
not ſome notable diſeaſe:
Onely croſſes are
thy remedyes: What
if they bee vnpleaſant?
They are Phyſicke
It is enough if
they bee wholeſome;

Not pleaſant taſt, but the
ſecret vertue commends
medicines; If they cure
thee, they ſhal pleaſe thee
euen in diſpleaſing, or els
thou loueſt thy palate aboue
thy ſoule. What
madneſſe is this? when
thou complaineſt of a
bodily diſeaſe, thou ſendeſt
to the Phiſician, that
he may ſend thee not ſauorie
but wholſome potions;
Thou receiueſt
them in ſpight of thine
abhorring ſtomacke, and
withall both thankeſt &amp;
rewardeſt the Phiſician.
Thy ſoule is ſicke; Thy
heauenly Phiſician ſees it,

and pitties thee ere thou

ſends thee not a plauſible

thou loatheſt the ſauor,
and rather wilt hazard
thy life, then offend
thy palate; and in ſteede
of thankes repineſt at, reuileſt
the Phiſician. How
comes it that wee loue
our ſelues ſo little (if at
leaſt we count our ſoules
the beſt or any part) as
that we had rather vndergoe
death then paine;
chooſing rather wilfull
ſicknes then an harſh remedy?
ſurely wee men are
meere fooles in the eſtimation

of our own good
like children our choice
is led altogether by ſhow
no whit by ſubſtāce. We
cry after euery well-ſeeming
toy, and put from

thinges: The wiſe arbitrator
of all thinges ſees our
folly and corrects it, with
holding our idle deſires
and forcing vpon vs the
ſound good wee refuſe:
It is ſecond folly in vs if
we thanke him not: The
fooliſh babe cryes for his
fathers bright knife or
gilded pilles; The wiſer
father knowes that they
can but hurt him; &amp; therfore-holdes

them after al
his tears; the child thinks
he is vſed but vnkindly:
Euery wiſe man, &amp; himſelfe
at more yeares can
ſay it was but childiſh
folly, in deſiring it, in cō
                  plaining

is no fortune to giue or
guide riches; there is no
true goodnes in riches to

then was (as I can interpret

euer riches were good to
any. In ſumme, who
would account thoſe as

deſcried and diſcomfited
which done,Poſitiue rules of our peace. wee haue enough
to preſerue vs frō
miſerie, but ſince wee
moreouer ſeeke how to
bee well and happily,
there yet remaine thoſe

poſitiue rules whereby
our Tranquillity may bee
both had continued and
confirmed: VVherin I
feare not leaſt I ſhould
ſeeme ouer-diuine, in
caſting the anchor of
Quietnes ſo deep as heauen,
the only ſeat of conſtancy,
whiles it can finde
no holde at all vpon
earth: All earthly
thinges are full of variablenes,
&amp; therefore hauing
no ſtay in themſelues,
can giue none to
vs. He that will haue
and hold right Tranquillity
muſt find in himſelfe
a ſweete fruition of

God and a 
                     〈◊〉
                   apprehenſion
of his preſe
                     •
                  ce.
That when he finds manifolde
occaſions of vexation
in theſe earthly
thinges he ouer-looking
them all, and hauing recourſe
his comforter
may finde in him ſuch
matter of contentment,
that he may paſſe ouer al
theſe petrye grieuances
with contempt; which
whoſ euer wants, may
be ſecure, cannot be quiet.
The mind of man cā
                  not
want ſome refuge▪ &amp;
(as wee ſay of the Elephant)
cannot reſt vnleſſe
it haue ſomthing toleane

vpon: The couetous
man, whoſe heauen is his
cheſt, whē he heares him
ſelfe rated and curſed for
oppreſſion, comes home
and ſeeing his bags ſafe,
applaudes himſelfe againſt
all cenſures: The
gluttō when hee looſeth
friendes or good name;
yet ioyes in his full furniſh't
table, &amp; the laughter
of his wine; more pleaſing
himſelfe in ſome one
diſh; then he can be greeued
with all the worldes
miſ-carriage: The needy
ſcholler whoſe wealth
lyes al in his brain, chears
himſelfe againſt iniquity

of times, with the conceit
of his knowledge.
Theſe ſtarting holes the
mind cannot want when
it is hard driuen: Now
when as, like to ſome
chaſed Siſera it ſhrowdes
it ſelfe vnder the harbor
of theſe Iaels altho they
giue it houſe-roome, and
milke for a time, yet at
laſt either they entertain
it with a nayle in the temples,
or beeing guilty
to their owne impotency,
ſend it out of
themſelues; for ſafety
and peace. For if the
Croſſe light in that
which it made his refuge

as if the couetous man
bee croſſed in his riches
what earthly thing can
ſtay him from a deſperate
phrenſy? Or if the croſſe
fall in a degree aboue the
height of his ſtay, as if the
rich man be ſick or dying
(wherein all wealth is either
contemned; or remembred
with anguiſh)
how doe all his comforts
(like vermin frō an houſe
on fier) runne away from
him, and leaue him ouer
to his ruine? VVhiles the
ſoule, that hath placed
his refuge aboue, is ſure
that the ground of his
cōfort cānot be matched

with an earthly ſorrowe,
cannot be made variable
by the chāge of any euēt
but is infinitly aboue all
caſualtyes, &amp; without all
vncertainties. What
ſtate is there wherein this
heauenly ſtay ſhall not aforde
me not only peace
but ioy? Am I in priſon?
or in the hell of priſons,
in ſome darke, low, and
deſolate dungeon? Loe
there,Pompon. Alger. Fox. Martyr. 
                  Algerius that ſweet
Martyr findes more light
then aboue, and pitties
the darknes of our libertie
wee haue but a Sunne
to enlighten our world,
which euery cloud dimmeth,

and hideth from
our eyes, but the father
of lights (in reſpect of
whome all the bright
ſtarres of heauen, are but
as the ſnaffe of a dim candle)
ſhines into his pit, &amp;
the preſence of his glorious
Angels make that an
heauē to him, which the
world purpoſed as an hel
of diſcomfort. What
walles can keepe out that
infinite ſpirit, that filles al
thinges? What darkeneſſe
can bee where the
God of this ſunne dwelleth?
what ſorrow where
hee comforteth? Am I
wandring in baniſhmēt?

Can I go whither God is
not? what ſea can diuide
betwixt him and mee?
then would I feare exile
if I could be driuē away
as wel from God, as my
country. Now hee is as
much in all earthes; His
title is alike to all places,
and mine in him: His ſun
ſhines to mee, his ſea or
earth beares mee vp, his
preſence cheareth mee,
whetherſoeuer I goe.
Hee cannot bee ſaide to
flitte that neuer changeth
his hoſt. Hee alone
is a thouſand companions,
he alone is a world
of friendes; that man

neuer knew what it was
to be familiar with God
that complaines of the
want of home; of friends
of companions while
God is with him. Am I
contemned of the world
It is enough for me that
I am honored of God, of
both I cānot: The world
loue me more, if I were
leſſe friends with God: It
cannot hate me ſo much
as God hates it: what
care I to be hated of thē,
whom God hateth. He is
vnworthy of Gods fauor
that cannot thinke it happines
enough with out
the worlds? How eaſy is

it for ſuch a man▪ whiles
the world diſgraces him
at once to ſcorne and pitty
it, that it cannot think
nothing more contemptible
then it ſelf? I am empoueriſhed
with loſſes:
That was neuer throughly
good, that may be loſt:
My riches will not leeſe
mee yea, tho I forgoe all
to my skin, yet haue I not
loſt any part of my welth
For if hee bee rich that
hath ſomthing, how rich
is he that hath the maker
and owner of al thinges?
I am weak and diſeaſed in
body; He cannot miſcarry
that hath his maker for

his Phyſician: Yet my
ſoule, the better part is
ſound, for that cannot be
weake, whoſe ſtrength
God is: How many are
ſicke in that &amp; complain
not: I can bee content to
bee let blood in the arme
or foot, for the curing of
the head or heart; The
health of the principall
part is more ioy to mee
then it is trouble to be
diſtempered in the inferiour.
Let me knowe
that God fauours me, thē
I haue liberty in priſon,
home in baniſhment, honor
in contempt, in loſſes
wealth, health in infirmity,

life in death, and in all
theſe happines: And ſurely
if our perfect fruition
of God be our complete
heauen, it muſt needs be,
that our inchoate cōuerſing
with him is our heauen
imperfectly; &amp; the
entrance into the other▪
which (me thinks) differs
frō this, not in the kind of
it, but in degree: For the
cōtinuatiō of which happy
ſociety (ſith ſtrāgenes
leeſeth acquaintāce, and
breedeth neglect) on our
part muſt be a daily renuing
of heuēly familiarity,
by ſeeking him vp, euen
with the cōtēpt of al inferior

diſtractiō; by talking
with him in our ſecret inuocatiōs,
by hearing his
cōferēce with vs; and by
mutual intertainment of
ech other in the ſweet diſcourſes
of our daily meditatiōs;
He is a ſullē &amp; vnſociable
frend that wants
words: God ſhal take no
pleaſur in vs if we be ſilēt:
The hart that is ful of loue
cannot but haue a buſy
tongue: Al our talk with
God is either Suites or
Thankes: In them the
chriſtian heart pours out
it ſelfe to his maker, and
would not change this
priuiledge for a world:

All his annoiances, al his
wants, all his diſlikes are
poured into the boſome
of his inuiſible friēd who
likes vs ſtil ſo much more
as wee aſke more, as wee
complaine more; Oh the
eaſy and happy recourſe▪
that the poore ſoule hath
to the hye throne of heauen▪
We ſtay not for the
holding out of a golden
ſcepter, to warne our admiſſiō,
before which our
preſence ſhould bee preſumption
and death; No
houre is vnſeaſonable, no
perſō too baſe, no words
too homely, no fact too
hard, no importunity too

great: we ſpeak familiarly
we are heard, anſwered,
comforted: Another-while
God interchangeably
ſpeakes vnto vs by the
ſecret voyce or his ſpirit;
or by the audible ſound
of his word, we heare, adore,
anſwere him; By
both which the minde ſo
communicates it ſelfe to
God, and hath God ſo
plentifully communicated
vnto it, that hereby it
growes to ſuch an habit
of heauenlineſſe, as
that now it wants
nothing but diſſolution
of full
glory.
            
            
               
               Sect. 23.
               
                  OVt of this main
groūd once ſetled
in the heart
(like as ſo many riuers
from one common ſea)
flow thoſe ſubordinate
reſolutions,The ſubordinate rules of Tranquillitie. which wee
require as neceſſary to
our peace, whether in reſpect
of our actions, or
our eſtate.1. For actions. For our actiōs
ther muſt be a ſecret vow
paſſed in the ſoul both of
cōſtāt refraining frō what
ſoeuer may offend that
maieſty we reſt vpō; and
aboue this, of true and

Canonicall obedience to
God, without all care
of difficulty, and in ſpight
of all contradictions of
nature: Not out of the
confidence of our
owne power: Impotent
men, who are we, that we
ſhoulde either vow or
performe? But as hee
ſaide; Giue what thou
bid'ſt, and bid what
thou wilt: Hence the
courage of Moſes durſt
venture his hand to
take vppe the crawling
and hiſſing Serpent;
Hence Peter durſt walke
vpon the Pauement
of the waues; Hence

that Heroicall ſpirit of
Luther (a man made of
metall fit for ſo great a
worke) durſt reſolue and
profeſſe to enter into
that fore-warned cittye,
tho there had been as many
diuells in their ſtreetes
as tiles on their houſes:
Both theſe vowes as wee
once ſolemnly made by
others, ſo for our peace
muſt wee renew in our
ſelues. Thus the experienced
mind both knowing
that it hath met with
a good friend, &amp; withall
what the price of a friend
is; cannot but be carefull
to retayne him, and wary

of diſpleaſing &amp; therefore
to cut off all daungers
of variance, voluntarily
takes a double oath of alleageance
of it ſelfe to
God; which neither benefit
ſhall induce vs to
breake, if we might gaine
a world, nor feare vrge vs
thereto, tho we muſt leeſe
our ſelues: The wauering
hart that finds continuall
combates in it ſelfe
betwixt Pleaſure &amp; Conſcience▪
ſo equally matched
that neither gets the
day, is not yet capable of
peace; and whether euer
ouer commeth, is troubled
both with reſiſtance

&amp; victory. Barren Rebecca
found more eaſe, then
whē her twins ſtruggled
in her womb: If Iacob had
been there alone, ſhe had
not complained of that
painfull contentiō: One
while Pleaſure holdes the
fort, and Conſcience aſſaults
it, which when it
hath entred at laſt by
ſtrong hand, after manye
batteries of iudgementes
denounced, ere long pleaſure
either corruptes the
watch, or by ſome cuning
ſtratagem, findes way
to recouer her firſt hold;
ſo our part is euer atempting,
and euer reſiſting,

betwixt both, the hart cā
                  not
haue peace, becauſe
it reſolues not; For while
the ſoule is held in ſuſpenſe,
it cannot enioy the
pleaſure it vſeth, becauſe
it is halfe taken vp with
feare; Onely a ſtrong and
reſolute repulſe of pleaſure
is truly pleaſant; For
therein the Conſcience
filling vs with heauenly
delight, maketh ſweete
Triumphes in it ſelfe; as
beeing now the Lorde
of his own dominions &amp;
knowing what to truſt to
No man knows the pleaſure
of this thought, I
haue dōe wel, but he that

hath felt it: &amp; he that hath
felt it, contemnes all pleaſure
to it. It is a falſe ſlander
rayſed on Chriſtianity,
that it makes men dū
                  piſh
and melancholicke;
for therfore are we heuy,
becauſe wee are not enough
Chriſtians. Wee
haue religion enough to
miſlike pleaſures, not enough
to ouercome thē;
But if wee bee once conquerours
ouer our ſelues
and haue deuoted our
ſelues wholly to God,
there can be nothing but
heauenly mirth in the
ſoule. Loe here ye philoſophers,
the true Muſick

of heauen, which the
good heart continually
heareth, and anſweares it
in the iuſt meaſurs of ioy
Others may talk of mirth
as a thing they haue hard
of, or vainly fancied; Only
the Chriſtian feeles it;
and in compariſon therof
ſcorneth the idle ribaldiſh,
and ſcurrilous mirth
of the prophane.
            
            
               Sect. 24.
               
                  AND this reſolution
which
wee call for,2. Rule for our actions.
muſt not onely
exclude manifeſtly euill
actions, but alſo doubting
and ſuſpenſion of

minde in actions ſuſpected,
and queſtionable;
wherein the iudgement
muſt euer giue confident
determination one way:
For this Tranquillity cō
                  ſiſteth
in a ſteddines of
the mind; and how can
that veſſell which is beaten
vpon, by contrarie
waues and windes, and
tottereth to either part,
be ſaid to keepe a ſteddy
courſe? Reſolution is
the onely mother of ſecuritie.
For inſtance; I
ſee that Vſurie, which
was wont to be condemned
for no better then a
Legall theft, hath now
obtained with many, the

the reputatiō of an honeſt
trade: &amp; is both vſed by
many, &amp; by ſome defended.
It is pittie that a bad
practiſe ſhould finde any
learned or religious Patron:
The ſumme of my
patrimony lieth dead by
me, ſealed vp in the bag
of my father; my thriftier
friends aduiſe me to this
eaſy &amp; ſure improuemēt;
Their counſel &amp; my gain
preuaile; my yearly ſums
come in with no coſt, but
of time, waxe, parchmēt;
My eſtate likes it well:
better then my conſcience;
which tels me ſtill
he doubts my trade is too

eaſy to be honeſt; Yet I cō
                  tinue
my illiberall courſe
not without ſome ſcruple
and contradiction; ſo
as my feare of offēce hinders
the ioy of my profit,
&amp; the pleſure of my game,
hartens mee againſt the
feare of: iniuſtice; I wold
be rich with caſe, and yet
I would not be vncharitable,
I would not be vniuſt
All the while I liue in vnquiet
doubts, and diſtraction;
Others are not ſo
much entangled in my
bonds, as I in my owne.
At laſt that I may bee
both iuſt and quiet, I cō
                  clude
to referre this caſe

wholly to the ſentence of
my inward iudge, the
Conſcience, the Aduocates,
Gaine and Iuſtice
plead on either part at
this barre with doubtfull
ſucceſſe. Gaine informes
the Iudge of a new and
nice diſtinction of toothleſſe
and biting intereſt, &amp;
brings preſidents of particular
caſes of vſury ſo
farre from any breach of
charity or iuſtice, that
both parts therein confes
themſelues aduantaged:
Iuſtice pleades euen the
moſt toothleſſe vſury to
haue ſharpe gummes; &amp;
finds in the moſt harmeleſſe

and profitable, practiſe
of it and inſenſible
wrong to the common
body; beſides the infinite
wracks of priuate eſtates;
The weake iudge ſuſpends
in ſuch probable
allegatiōs, &amp; demurreth;
as being ouercome of
both, and of neither part:
&amp; leaues me yet no whit
more quiet, no whit leſſe
vncertaine: I ſuſpend my
practiſe accordingly, being
ſure it is good not
to doe, what I am not
ſure is good to be done;
and now Gaine▪
                   ſolicites
mee as much as iuſtice
did before▪ Betwixt both

I liue troubleſomely:
Nor euer ſhal doe other,
till in a reſolute deteſtation
I haue whipped this
euil merchant out of the
Temple of my heart:
This rigour is my peace;
Before I coulde not bee
well, either full or faſting:
Vncertainetie is
much payne, euen in
a more tollerable action:
Neither is it (I
thinke) eaſy to determine,
whether it be
worſe to doe a lawfull
acte with doubting,
or an euill with
reſolution: ſince that
within it ſelfe is good,

is made euil to me by my
doubt, and! what is in nature
euill, is in this one
point not euill to mee,
that I do it vpon a verdict
of a Conſcience, ſo now
my iudgement offends in
not following the truth I
offend not in that I follow
my iudgement: Wherin
if the moſt wiſe God had
left vs to roue onely according
to the aime of
our owne coniectures, it
ſhould haue beene leſſe
faulty to be Sceptickes in
our actions, and either
not to iudge at all, or to
iudge amiſſe: but how
that he hath giuen his a

perfite rule of eternall equity,
and truth: wherby
to direct the ſentences of
our iudgement, that vncertainty
which alloweth
no peace to vs, will aforde
vs no excuſe before the
tribunall of heauē: wherfore,
then onely is the
hart quiet, when our
actions are grounded▪
vpon iudgement &amp;
our iudgement
vpon Truth.

ſince hee muſt

and falles with euery
waue, and depends only
on the mercy of wind &amp;
water: But who relyes on
the ineuitable decree, &amp;
all-ſeeing prouidence of
God, which can neither
bee croſſed with ſecond
thoughts, nor with euēts
vnlooked for, layes a ſure
grounde of Tranquillity,
Let the world toſſe how
it liſt, and vary it ſelfe (as
it euer doth) in ſtorms &amp;
calms, his reſt is pitched
alo
                     •
                  t, aboue the ſphere of
changeable mortality. To
begin is harder then to
proſecute▪ What coūſell

had God in the firſt molding
of thee in the
womb of thy mother?
what ayde ſhall hee haue
in repairing thee from
the womb of the earth? &amp;
if he could make, &amp; ſhall
reſtore thee without thee
why ſhall hee not much
more (not without thy in
deuor) diſpoſe of thee? Is
God wiſe enough to
guide the heauens &amp; to
produce all creatures in
their kindes: and ſeaſons
and ſhall he not bee able
to order thee alon? Thou
ſayſt I haue friendes, and
(which is my beſt friend
I haue wealth, to make

both them, and mee; and
wit to put both to beſt
vſe. O the broken reedes
of humaine confidence!
Who euer truſted on
friendes that could truſt
to himſelfe? Who euer
was ſo wiſe, as not ſometimes
to be a foole in his
owne conceit, ofte times
in the conceit of others?
Who was euer more diſcōtent
then the wealthy?
Friends may bee falſe,
wealth cannot but be deceitfull,
wit hath made
many fooles; Truſt thou
to that, which if thou
wouldſt cannot fail thee.
Not that thou deſireſt

ſhall come to paſſe; but
that which God hath decreed:
Neither thy feares
nor thy hopes, nor vows
ſhall either for ſlow or alter
it. The vnexperienced
paſſenger when hee
ſees the veſſell go amiſſe
or too farre, laies faſt hold
on the contrary part, or
on the maſt for remedy,
the Pilot laughs at his folly,
knowing that (what euer

                     •
                  e labors) the barke
will goe which way the
winde and his ſterne directeth
it. Thy goods
are embarked; Now
thou wiſheſt a direct
Northwinde to driue

thee to the Straytes▪
                  
and then a Weſt to
runne in; and now, when
thou haſt emptyed and
laded againe, thou callſt
as earneſtlie for the
South, and Southeaſt
to returne; and lowreſt
if all theſe anſwer
thee not: As if heauen
and earth had nothing
elſe to doe but to
wayte vpon thy pleaſure,
and ſerued onely
to bee commaunded
ſeruice by thee: Another
that hath contrary
occaſions asks for
windes quite oppoſite
to thine: He that ſits in

heauen, neither fits thy
fancy nor his, but bids his
winds ſpit ſometimes in
thy face, ſometimes to fauor
thee with a ſideblaſt,
ſometimes to be boiſterous
otherwhiles to be ſilēt
at his own pleſure. VVhether
the marriner ſing or
curſe, it ſhal go whither it
is ſent; Striue or lye ſtill,
thy deſtiny ſhal run on, &amp;
what muſt bee, ſhalbee;
Not that we ſhould hēce
exclude benefit of means
(which are alwaies neceſſarily
included in this
wiſe preordination of
all things) but perplexity
of cares, and wreſtling

with prouidence. Oh
the idle &amp; ill ſpent cares
of curious men, that conſult
with ſtarres, and ſpirits
for their deſtinies, vnder
colour of preuentiō;
if it bee not thy deſtiny,
why wouldſt thou know
it, what needes thou reſiſt
it? If it be thy deſtiny,
why wouldſt thou know
that thou canſt not preuent?
That which God
hath decreede is already
done in heauē, and muſt
be done on earth. This
kind of expectation doth
but haſten ſlow euills, &amp;
prolong them in their
continuāce; haſten them

not in their euent but in
our conceit: Shortly then
if thou ſwimmeſt againſt
the ſtreame of this prouidence,
thou canſt not eſcape
drowning, euerye
waue turns thee ouer like
a Porckpoſe before a tempeſt;
but if thou ſwim'ſt
with the ſtreame, do but
caſt thine armes abroade
thou paſſeſt with ſafetye,
and with eaſe; it both
beares thee vppe, and
carries thee on to the
hauē, whither God
hath determined
thine arriuall

in hauing much,
but now that he only
hath much that hath
contentment, and that
is as eaſily obtayned
in a lowe eſtate; I
can account of theſe
thoughtes no better
then proudely fooliſh.
Thou art poore? VVhat
differēce is there betwixt
a greater man and thee

ſaue that he doth his buſineſſes
by others, thou doeſt
them thy ſelfe? He hath
Caters, Cookes, Bayliues, ſtewardes,
Secretaries, and all
other offices for his ſeuerall
ſeruices, thou prouideſt,
dreſſeſt, gathereſt, receiueſt,
expendeſt, writeſt
for thy ſelfe: His patrimonie
is large, thine
earnings ſmall. If Briareus
feed fiftie bellies with
his hundreth hands, what
is he the better, then hee
that with two hands feedeth
one: He is ſerued in
ſiluer, thou in veſſell of
the ſame colour, of leſſer
price; as good for vſe, tho

nothing but liberty, that
alone would make him
happy: Once free forgetting
his former thought,
he wiſhes ſome wealth
to make vſe of his freedome,
&amp; ſayes it were as
good be ſtraited in place
as in ability; Once rich,
he longeth after nobility,
thinking it no prayſe to
be a welthy peaſāt. Once
noble he begins to deem
it a baſe matter to be ſubiect▪
nothing can now
content him but a croſhn
Then it is a ſmall matter
to rule, ſo long as he hath
but little dominions, and
greater neighbours; he

woulde therefore bee
an vniuerſall Monarch;
Whither then? ſurely
it vexes him as much,
that the earth is ſo ſmall
a globe, ſo little a molehill;
and that there
are no moe worldes to
conquer; and now that
hee hath attayned the
hyeſt dignitye among
men, hee would needes
bee a God, conceites his
immortalitye, erects temples
to his owne name
commaundes his deade
ſtatues to bee adored:
And not thus contented,
is angry that hee
cannot commande heauen

in to ſolace himſelfe; The
weight whereof varies
according to our eſtimation
of them: One hath
much wealth, but no
child to inherite it, he enuyes
at the poore mans
fruitfulneſſe, which hath
many heires and no lands
and coulde bee content
with all his aboundance
to purchaſe a ſucceſſour
of his owne loynes. Another
hath many children,
little maintenance
he commēdeth the careles
quietnes of the barren
&amp; thinks fewer mouthes
and more meate woulde
do better; The labouring

man hath the bleſſing of
a ſtrōg body fit to digeſt
any fare, to indure any labor;
yet he wiſheth himſelfe
weaker, on condicion
he might bee wealthier;
The man of nice education
hath a feeble ſtomach,
and raſping ſince his laſt
meale, doubts whether he
ſhoulde eate of his beſt
diſh, or nothing; this man
repines at nothing more
thē to ſe his hūgry plowman
feed on a cruſt; and
wiſheth to change eſtates
on condicion hee might
change bodies with him:
Say that God ſhould
giue thee thy wiſh, what

not for value: His diſhes
are more dainty, thine as
well reliſhed to thee, and
no leſſe wholeſome: Hee
eates oliues, thou garlick,
he miſlikes not more the
ſmell of thy ſauce, then
thou doſt the taſte of his,
Thou wanteſt ſomwhat
that he hath, hee wiſheth
ſomething which thou
haſt, and regardeſt not:
Thou couldſt be cōtent to
haue the rich mans purſe,
but his gout thou woldſt
not haue; He would haue
thy health, but not thy
fare: If we might picke
out of all mens eſtates
that which is laudable, omitting

the inconueniences
wee woulde make
our ſelues complete; but
if wee muſt take altogether,
vvee ſhoulde perhaps
little aduantage our
ſelues with the change.
For the moſt wiſe God
hath ſo proportion'd out
euery mans condition,
that hee hath ſome iuſt
cauſe of ſorrow inſeperably
mixed with other cō
                  tentmēts;
and hath allotted
to no man liuing, an
abſolute happines without
ſome grieuances; nor
to any man ſuch an exquiſite
miſery, as that he findeth
not ſomwhat wherin

wouldſt thou deſire? Let
me (thou ſaieſt) bee wiſe
helthfull, rich, honorable,
ſtrong, learned, beautiful
immortall: I knowe thou
loueſt thy ſelfe ſo well,
that thou canſt wiſh all
theſe, and more; But ſay
that God hath ſo ſhared
out all theſe gifts by a
moſt wiſe and iuſt diſtribution,
that thou canſt
haue but ſome of theſe,
perhaps but one; Which
wouldſt thou ſingle out
for thy ſelfe? Any thing
beſide what thou haſt: If
learned, thou wouldſt be
ſtrong, if ſtrong honorable,
if honorable long-liued;

Some of theſe thou
art already. Thou foole;
Cannot God chooſe
better for thee, then thou
for thy ſelfe? In other
matches thou truſteſt
the choyce of a skillfuller
chapman; when
thou ſeeſt a goodly horſe
in the fayre (tho his
ſhape pleaſe thine eye
well) yet thou dareſt
not buye him, if a cunning
horſemaiſter ſhall
tell thee hee is faulty and
art willing to take a playner
&amp; ſoūder, on his cō
                  mēdatiō
againſt thy fācy:
How much more ſhould
we in this caſe allow his

choyce that cannot deceiue
vs; that cannot
bee deceyued? But thou
knoweſt that other thou
deſireſt, better then what
thou haſt; Better perhaps
for him that hath
it, not better for thee:
Libertye is ſweete and
profitable to thoſe that
can vſe it; But fetters
are better for the
frantick man: Wine is
good nouriſhment for
the healthfull, poyſon
to the aguiſh; It is
good for a ſound body
to ſleep in a whole skin,
but he that complains of
ſwelling ſores cānot ſleep

till it be brokē: Hemlock
to the goat, &amp; ſpiders to
the monky turn to good
ſuſtenance, which to other
creatures are accoū
                  ted
deadly; As in diets ſo
in eſtimation of good &amp;
euill, of greater and leſſer
good; there is much variety:
All palats commend
not one diſh, and what
one commends for moſt
delicate, another reiects
for vnſauory. And if
thou know what diſh is
moſt pleaſant to thee, thy
Phyſician knowes beſt
which is wholeſome:
Thou wouldſt follow
thine appetite too much

and (as the French haue
in their prouerb) woldſt
dig thy owne graue with
thy teeth; thy wiſe phyſician
ouerſees &amp; ouerrules
thee: He ſees if thou wert
more eſteemed, thou
wouldſt bee proude, if
more ſtrong, licentious, if
richer, couetous, if health
fuller, more ſecure; But
thou thinkeſt not thus
hardly of thy ſelfe Fond
man, what knoweſt thou
futur things? beleue thou
him that onely knowes
what would bee, what
will bee; Thou wouldſt
willingly go to heauen,
what better guide canſt

thou haue, then him that
dwels there? If he lead
thee thorough deepe
ſloughes, and brackie
thickets, know that he
knowes this the neerer
way though more cumberſome:
can there be
in him any want of wiſedome
not to foreſee the
beſt? Can there be any
want of power not to
effect the beſt? Any want
of loue not to giue thee
what he knowes is beſt?
How canſt thou then
faile of the beſt? Since
what his power can doe,
and what his wiſedome
ſees ſhould be done, his

loue hath done, becauſe
all are infinite: He willeth
not things becauſe
they are good, but they
are good becauſe hee
wils them: Yea if ought
had beene better, this
had not beene; God willeth
what he doth, and if
thy will accord not with
his, whether wilt thou
condemne of imperfection?
            
            
               Sect. vlt.
               
                  I Haue chalked
out the way of
peace;The concluſion of the whole what remains▪
but that we walke along in it.

I haue cōducted my reader
to the mine, yea to
the mint of happines, &amp;
ſhowed him thoſe glorious
heapes, which may
eternally enrich him.
If now he ſhall go away
with his hands and skirt
empty; how is he but
worthy of a miſerable
want? who ſhall pitty vs
while we haue no mercy
on our ſelues? wilfull diſtreſſe
hath neither remedy
nor compaſſion: And
to ſpeake freely, I haue
oft wondred at this painful
folly of vs men, which
in the open view of our
peace, as if wee were condemned

to a neceſſary &amp;
fatall vnquietnes, liue vpon
our own rack, finding
no more ioy then if wee
were vnder no other
handes, but our executioners.
One droupeth vnder
a fained euill, another
augments a ſmall ſorrow
through impatience, another
drawes vpon himſelfe
an vncertaine euill
through feare; one ſeekes
true contentment, but
not inough; another hath
iuſt cauſe of ioy, and perceiues
it not: One is vexed
for that his grounds of
ioy are matched with equall
grieuances; another

cannot complaine of any
preſent occaſion of ſorrowe,
yet liues ſullenly,
becauſe he finds not any
preſent cauſe of comfort;
One is haunted with his
ſinne, another diſtracted
with his paſſiō: Amongſt
all which, he is a miracle
of men, that liues not
ſome way diſcontented.
So wee liue not
while wee doe liue,
onely for that wee want
either wiſedome, or
will, to huſband our
liues to our owne beſt
aduantage. O the inequalitye
of our cares!
Let riches or honour

bee in queſtion; we
ſue to them, we ſeeke
for them with importunitye,
with ſeruile
ambition: Our
paynes neede no ſolicitor;
Yea there is no
way wrong that leades
to this end: VVee
abhorre the patience
to ſtay till they inquire
for vs. And if euer
(as it rarely happens)
our deſert and worthineſſe
winnes vs the
fauour of this profer,
wee meete it with
both handes, not daring
with our modeſt
denyalles to whet

the inſtancy, and double
the intreaties of ſo welcome
ſuiters; Yet lo, here
the onely true and precious
riches, the hyeſt aduancement
of the ſoule,
peace and happines, ſeeks
for vs, ſues to vs for acceptation;
our aunſwers are
coy and ouerly, ſuch as
we giue to thoſe clients
that look to gaine by our
fauors. If our want were
through the ſcarcity of
good, we might yet hope
for pittye to eaſe vs, but
now that it is through
negligence, and that wee
periſh with our hands in
our boſome, wee are rather

worthy of ſtripes for
the wrong wee doe our
ſelues, then of pitty for
what we ſuffer. That we
may and will not, in oportunity
of hurting others▪
is noble and Chriſtian
but in our owne benefite
ſluggiſh, and ſauoring of
the worſt kind of vnthriftineſſe.
               Sayeſt thou then this
peace is good to haue,
but hard to get? It were
a ſhamefull neglect that
hath no pretence: Is difficulty
ſufficient excuſe
to hinder thee from the
purſuit of riches, of preferment,
of learning, of

bodily pleaſures? Art
thou cōtent to ſit ſhrugging
in a baſe cottage,
ragged, affamiſhed, becauſe
houſe, clothes, and
food will neither be had
without money, nor money
without labour, nor
labour without trouble
and painefulneſſe? Who
is ſo mercifull, as not
to ſay that a whip is the
beſt almes for ſo lazy
and wilfull neede? Peace
ſhoulde not bee good,
if it were not harde:
Go, and by this excuſe
ſhut thy ſelfe out
of heauen at thy death

and liue miſerabely til
thy death, becauſe the
good of both worldes
is hard to compaſſe.
There is nothing but
miſerye on earth and
hell belowe, that thou
canſt come to without
labour; And if wee
can bee content to caſt
awaye ſuch immoderate
and vnſeaſonable
paynes vpon theſe earthly
trifles, as to weare
our bodyes with violence,
and to incroach
vpon the night for tim
                     •
                   to
get them; what madnes
ſhall it ſeem in vs not
to afforde a leſſe labour

to that which is infinitly
be
                     •
                  ter, and which onely
giues worth &amp; goodnes
vnto the other? Wherefor
if we haue not vowed
enmity with our ſelues
if we be not in loue with
miſery and vexation, if
we be not obſtinatly careleſſe
of our owne good;
let vs ſhake off this vnthrifty,
dangerous &amp; deſperate
negligence, and
quicken theſe dull hearts
to a liuely and effectuall
ſearch of what onely can
yield them ſweete and
abiding contentment;
which once attayned;
How ſhall we inſult ouer

euils, and bid them do
their worſt? How ſhall
wee vnder this calme &amp;
quiet bay laugh at the
rough weather &amp; vnſted
dye motions of the
worlde? How ſhall heauen
and earth ſmile vpon
vs, and we on them; commāding
the one; aſpiring
to the other? How pleaſāt
ſhall our life be, while
neither ioies nor ſorrows
can diſtemper it with exceſſe?
yea while the matter
of ioy that is within
vs, turnes all the moſt ſad
occurrences into pleaſure?
How deare &amp; welcome
ſhall our death bee that

ſhall but leade vs from
one heauen to another,
from peace to
glorye? Goe now yee
vaye and idle worldlinges,
and pleaſe your
ſelues in the large extent
of your rich Mannors,
or in the homage
of thoſe whome
baſeneſſe of mind hath
made ſlaues to your
greatneſſe, or in the
price and faſhions of
your full wardrop; or
in the wanton varietyes
of your delicate
gardens; or in your
cofers full of red and
white earth, or if there

bee any other earthly
thing more alluring,
more precious, enioy
it, poſſeſſe it, and let it
poſſeſſe you: Let mee
haue only my peace &amp;
let me neuer want
it, till I enuie
you.
