            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

               IT is not more triuiall then true, Nimia familiaritas parit contemptum, Too much familiaritie breedeth contempt. Plenty breedes loathing of what wee moſt deſired, and weariſomneſſe in what we moſt delighted, cuſtome cauſeth facilitie, and that againe produceth careleſneſſe, and neglect. Neceſsitie ſearcheth and findeth out neceſſaries, Art beautifieth, but out of Art ſpringeth idle curioſitie that marreth all. What integrity is there in any thing? When the world was cleane purged by waters, and the wicked ſwept all away, yet there remained a ſecret Cham lurking in the righteous familie, and in Lots houſe

one that looked back to the rich plaine of Sodome. The pureſt quinteſſenee extracted from the pureſt body by the p

The Church being cleanſed of her leproſie, and reſtored to her antiquitie comely▪ and beautifull, groweth ſo curious on the one ſide, and ſo Atheiſtically ſacrilegious on the other ſide, that who is a good man, who a wiſe man, ſub iudice lis

                  eſt. We are falling from comely ſobriety, to proud ouer-weening curioſity, and phantaſticall leuitie, like thoſe that thinke a thing neuer to be well, till it be ſpoiled with too much fingering, whitling, and hammering. Too much playing with the phantaſie, (the diſeaſe of theſe times) marreth a good vnderſtanding. For as a learned man ſaith, it is mater erroris, the mother of errour leading vs from naturall portraitures to anticks, the like whereof (for illuſtration ſake) is to be ſeene in our apparrell, and putting on thereof, and ſhould be ſeene in our bodies, if they were of aerious ſubſtance, and changeable at our will. Much preaching we haue, and much hearing, (a peculiar bleſsing on this nation) we are ripe of conceit, and glib of tongue, euery thing is eaſie, nothing difficult, and how many thinke themſelues able to teach their teachers, and gouerne their gouernours? Surely, if the Pulpit, and place of authority, were granted them, we ſhould haue ſo many new coyned Churches, and polities, that the diuine, true, and naturall portraiture of both ſhould be loſt, and all of vs left in a maze, and as creatures tranſlated out of their proper element into another. Much haue we in times paſt deſired the ſober, and plaine preaching of the word, for knowledge of the truth, and right practiſe of duties towards God, and one towards another, but the fickleneſſe

of many is weary of both. They cannot tell whom they would heare, what they would heare, what forme they would haue, and as the ſicklie man, and want on childe would haue they know not what. Many are ſo rauiſhed with their owne anticks, and conceit of their owne knowledge, and all-ſufficiency, that it is enough for them to heare for varietie, and compariſon ſake, new inſtruments, new voyces, to looke the Preacher in the face, but in the meane while, like Cut-purſes, to haue their ſacrilegious hands in his pocket, and to ſalue the ſmarting ſore with a dinner or a ſupper, ſawced with oyly words, with deceitfull hollow courteſies, which fill the eye and the phantaſie (bewitchingly) but drie vp the bloud in the veines; for wee are fooles, but they are wiſe. Their heart goeth after their pride, after their couetouſneſſe, Ezech. 33. 31. Plenty of the word hath bred loathing thereof, and plenty of Preachers contempt of them. Many haue heard, and ſeene Chriſt enough, yet finde neither profit

Heatheniſh deuotion is meere madneſſe; Popiſh deuotion is ſuperſtitious, and fooliſh ſober hearing and well doing is weariſome: What remaineth but Epicuriſme? And what is that but to make an Idoll of the corruptible body, the moſt rotten Idoll of all? Surely, neither Pagans, nor Popiſh Churches and houſes were euer ſo filled with Idols, as they are now. For the belly, body, or perſon, is the Epicures Idoll, as the Apoſtle ſaith, Phil. 3. 19. And how this Bel, and Iezabel, the corruptible carke is ſhould be more adored, and deifyed, than now it is, I conceiue not, neither can any Cooke, or Tailor imagine,

for in deuiſing new follies they fall into the old vnawares. Now what will be the ripeneſſe of this ſwiniſh wallowing in the lees of concupiſcence, but backſliding into Paganiſme, or rather a progreſſe into Atheiſme, when all good wiſedome and vnderſtanding is depraued through luſt? So that in the end, we ſhall be worſe Ignorants, or rather worſe miſcreants, then euer we were, according to that principle in Philoſophie, Bonum optimum corruptum fit peſſimum.
            
            Conſidering the ſeaſon (beloued Father in God) I was in doubt whether it were better to haue exerciſed my ſelfe in the Prophet Ieremie, whoſe propheſies are well befitting this laſt end of the world, drawing neere to the vniuerſall iudgement, as the particular nation of the Iewes did towards theirs, for their wilfulneſſe, hard-heartedneſſe, contempt of their Prophets, carnality of their Prieſts, confidence in their owne ſtrength, couetouſneſſe, oppreſſion, &amp;c. But becauſe I feared both meanes and health would faile me in ſo long a worke, I vndertooke this, which is of like nature; and intent, namely to withdraw men from the tranſitory world, and the periſhing luſts thereof, euen from this loathſome Belly-Idolatry, ſpirituall Maſtupration, Selfe-harlotry, to the feare of God, and obedience to his commandements, conſidering the proud preſumption▪ want on ſecuritie, the ciuill filthineſſe, modeſt leuity, courteous Chuch-robberies, and the fruitleſſe i

               making bookes there is no end, and much reading is a wearineſſe to the fleſh. But he that is not a forgetfull hearer, but a doer of the worke, this man ſhall be bleſſed in his deede, Iam. 1. 25. For this is totum hominis, the whole duty of man, Ecceſ. 12. 13. Surely, if bleſſedneſſe be to be found in the deede, then in much writing, reading, ſpeaking, hearing, there muſt needes be wearineſſe, if not to the body, yet to the conſcience, which in theſe outward exerciſes onely, can neuer finde true comfort, or aſſurance of Gods loue.
            Now I haue made choice of your Lordſhip, to whom I might Dedicate this worke; and that for ſundry cauſes: Firſt, that I might exhibite it to you as a New yeares gift, the beſt that I haue, in token of my ſincere loue and duty, and earneſt deſire of your proſperous and happie welfare, who as you were ſtudious your ſelfe, when once you were Fellow of Queenes Colledge in Cambridge; ſo were you a ſpeciall fauourer, and furtherer of the Studious, whereby you purchaſed ſpeciall loue, both in your owne Colledge and abroad alſo, and the ſame through your perſeuerance, and prudent gouernement is ſtill continued amongſt vs that liue vnder your Iuriſdiction. Another cauſe is, that it might finde the better paſſage vnder your patronage, and kinder entertainement vnder your name, that though it be defectiue in ſelfe-deſert, yet for your ſake the indifferent, beneuolous, and generous eye, reſpecting the ſtrong, might ingenuouſly paſſe by the we

fruits of my Miniſteriall labours to you, a ſpeciall fauourer of faithfull Miniſters. Laſtly, as tokens of ſmall weight, but of great value, are more acceptable then great Summes, I truſt that this ſmall gaine of my one Talent, which I preſent to your Lordſhip, as a token of my ſincere affection, obedience, and ſeruice, ſhall counteruaile a ponderous volume. And what I am leſſe able this way to performe, I ſhall recompence with my continuall and hearty prayers for your temporall and eternall happineſſe.

                  RIGHT WORSIPFVLL, and worthy minded Gentlemen: Hauing in the firſt place elected the diuine, learned, iudicious, enriched with wiſedome, and piety, for the patronage of this worke, I haue alſo further beſtowed the ſame on you, (nil minuit de lumine lumen) to the end that being ſhielded with reuerend, and pious grauity▪ in the Van, and guarded by generous and vnblemiſhable vertue in the Rere, I may be ſafely protected from the ſnarling detraction of enuie on the one ſide, and receiue a fauourable conſtruction of what may be amiſſe on the other. The vniuerſality, and excellency of the ſubiect, hath enlarged my dedication; It is Solomons Ethiks, his tractate de ſummo bono, of the chiefe, and compleat felicity, and the worlds vanity, and therefore the very roote, ſeede, or kernell of all happy knowledge, both of

good, and euill in all things, naturall, politicall, eccleſiaſticall. Contraria iuxta ſe poſita magis illuceſcunt, ſay the Phyloſophers; and ſaith a Father. Qui malum non nouit, perfecte bonum non intelligit, He that hath not knowne euill, doth not perfectly vnderſtand good. As the earth, ſo the Arts haue their weeds, from which they are purged by their Phyſicion. Truth is like Gold in the Mine: Vprightneſſe is ſur▪rounded and clouded with calumnies: Wiſedome is darkened with ſophiſtry▪ 
               Impurus ſpiritus ſe immiſcit in omnibus: The vncleane ſpirit intrudes himſelfe into euery thing. Solomon therefore doth not onely 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , id eſt, deſtruere, deſtroy the falſe and counterfeit felicities of mans darke heart, and that by euident arguments, drawne from ſuch grounds as the wiſe-men of the world could not finde, groping like the Sodomites for Lots doore, but could not finde it; not ſo quicke-ſighted as hee that ſaw men walking like trees. For as they ſay, Nullum elementum ponderat ſuo loco, No element is ponderous in his place; ſo they being in corruption, felt no weight of corruption, no more then the Fiſhes in the Sea and wormes of the Earth feele the weight of either. Worldly wiſedome is wearineſſe, both to the body and minde▪ and a vexation of ſpirit. For being it ſelfe crooked, it cannot rectifie things crooked. Mirth is madneſſe. Royall magnificence is tranſitorie and m

               table. The ſageſt aduiſements depend on vncertaine iſſues. Proſperitie and aduerſitie are ſet one againſt another, as hill againſt dale. The reſtleſſe Pole is immoueably fixed in his place; as the grinding milſtone, ſo is the earth in her centre a maſſe of mutabilities. Of the heauens there is a conſtant reuolution, vp and downe, to and fro, they neuer haue the ſame face, neuer hold the ſame countenance, at leaſt from the firſt motion till the end of times. Here is the difficulty of prognoſtication. Omnia verſantur in perpetuo aſcenſu &amp; deſcenſu; There is a perpetuall aſcending and deſcending of life, and ſtate. Euery man, euery ſtate, euery thing is a Planet, whoſe ſphericall reuolutions are ſome of longer, ſome of ſhorter continuance. Ʋulgar iudgements are variable; their counſels groundleſſe. Scinditur incertum ſtudia in contraria vulgus; but the prudent deſignes of ſage States are firme; euen ſo are the imaginations of the wiſeſt worldlings in all their

wayes, and enterprizes; but the foundation of God remaineth ſure. Their wiſe ſayings are applauded, when they doe but dreame waking, and raue like men in ſickneſſe, thinking themſelues to be in Dothan, when they are in the middeſt of Samaria; 2 Kings 6. When they are on the ſureſt ground, they walke on pinnacles; againe, when they are naked in the middeſt of their enemies Camp
                  •
               , they are armed in the ſtrongeſt fort. For the hand of God doth all, that men might feare before him, and not leane to their owne wiſedome. Yet vaine man would be wiſe, ſeeing he is but a wild Aſſes Colt, ſaith Iob. He would be happy, being but a maſſe of mortalities. For being the moſt compound and vniuerſall nature, as concerning his plaſme, and ſo the moſt excellent by creation, he is the moſt miſerable by degeneration. Nam bonum optimum corruptum fit peſſimum. And how much greater then is the corruption of his ſpirit? That is to be ſeene by the corruption of the moſt excellent ſpirit. Both haue their reſtraints, and limitations; yet hath not God left man in deſperation, but in his eternall wiſedome prouided meanes of reſtauration, which here is begun, and there finiſhed, whence the Authour of corruption fell. This reſtauration is firſt the renouation, or change of the centre, the roote of man, I meane his heart or ſpirit of his minde; then of his ſpirits veſſell, I meane the brutall nature, or inferiour part, which I take to be the ſperme, or quinteſſence of the vniuerſe, and then are all things renued with him; 2 Cor. 5. 17. Felicity therefore is here to be had, and by the holy endeauours of renewed wiſedome to be obtained. But this good in this vale of miſery is imperfect, yet in continuall motion, and progreſſe to perfection, though the whole engine with all the furniture thereof, man, and euery condition and ſtate of life, ethike, politike, eccleſiaſtike, groane vnder the burthen of vanity. Here then is wiſedome and worke for the curious Alchymiſt, who ſurpaſſeth common capacities. Here is the skill that extracteth gall out of hony, and hony out of gall. Here is the Phyloſophers ſtone, that turneth yron that baſe mettall, into gold the pureſt mettall, euen the ſoueraigne good that ouercommeth euill, yea, that turneth things in their natures curſed, into bleſſings, the beginnings of endleſſe torments into eternall glory, the light that expelleth darkneſſe, the life that ſwalloweth vp death, the ſpirit that weareth out the leproſie, canker, and rottenneſſe of the ſpirit, of the veſſell, of the

perſon, of the outward ſtate. To omit the many learned dotages of the worldly wiſe, and madneſſes of ſelfe-willed Idiots; ſome man thinketh himſelfe happy, if he knoweth the euils of this life, and with all hath knowledge to auoid them, and in procuring of good vnto himſelfe for his bodily eaſe, comfort, and pleaſure, thinkes that by this wiſedome he hath obtained the chiefe good, and ſo kiſſeth his hand, and ſacrificeth to his net, his ſubtle, ſound pate, as he iudgeth. Here is his vttermoſt extent, in this ſphere is he rowled as the Sow in the mire. Secondly, ſome man againe eſteemeth ſuch a one but brutiſhly ſubtle, becauſe he doth not good to others as well as to himſelfe, as the principle of humanity requireth; Quod tibi vis fieri, fac alijs, Doe as thou wouldeſt be done to. Therefore becauſe he is cautelous, and prouident for himſelfe, and communicateth to others alſo, he iudgeth himſelfe to be that happy man. He excelleth indeed the former brute, as he againe doth that vegetable one; Eccles. 4. 8. euen as the ayre excelleth the water, and that the earth. But the wiſedomes of theſe three conioyned by vnion into one indiuiduall, are but as an excellent veſſell, or receptacle for this laſt. Laſtly, another who is truly wiſe indeed, excludeth this man from happineſſe yet, becauſe he is but as a beautifull body without a quickning ſpirit, which is pietie, the ſoule or ſupernaturall ſpirit, enlining the reſt. So that neither the wiſe vegetable, nor the wiſe brutall or ſenſible, nor the wiſe reaſonable or humane, but the wiſe ſpirituall organized with the reſt (as I may ſay) is onely capable of this ſoueraigne good of Solomon. This onely knoweth what is good in euill things and ſtates, what euill in good things and States, what is good for himſelfe in both, in this vaine life, according to that line and meaſure that God dealeth to man. This wiſedome ordereth and enliueth the other wiſedomes, being a ſupernaturall gift, the diuine influence of the ſanctifying Spirit: For they being ſeuered from this, are but an eye without the optike ſpirit, which indeed is no eye, but a dead member. The like we ſee in the ſtructure of mans veſſell, id eſt, in the vegetable and brutall ſpirits, but the reaſonable ſoule enliueth, moueth, and ordereth them both, or rather her ſelfe in and by them, by vertue of her vnion with them, whereby they become rationall.
            The degrees of this good to be gathered out of Solomons 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , or poſitiue doctrine, are briefly theſe:
            
               
               1. To be in a calling, according to Gods generall decree; Gen. 3. 19. Otherwiſe a man is a belial, a ſluggard, a diſſolute, diſperſt, incompact member, out of fauour with God and man, and his owne conſcience, and lyeth open to many miſeries, as he is the fitteſt ſubiect to be ſentina malorum, the ſinke of euils.
            
               2. To labour in that lawfull calling, to exerciſe his talent, that his Lord may receiue his owne with aduantage.
            
               3. To labour with diligence, Chapter 9. 10. of this booke. Hereby many bodily miſeries, and occaſions of ſpirituall temptations alſo are auoyded. For a man to be negligent in his buſineſſe, is to be brother to a waſter, as Solomon ſaith elſe where.
            
               4. To comfort and ſolace the body with the fruits of our labours, all the creatures from the higheſt heauen to the centre of the earth, ſeruing to no other purpoſe then the reparation &amp; conſeruation of the ſoules fraile, corruptible veſſell: For the ſoule her ſelf is enliued, fed &amp; conſerued by another World, the Word of God effectuall by the ſpirit that ſpeaketh therein. The body is ex limo terrae, of the ſlime or ſeede of the vniuerſe; but the ſoule is ex alia propagine, progenie.
            
            
               5. As we haue receiued good▪ ſo to be faithfull diſpenſers thereof, viz. to communicate to others, wherein the eſſence of charity conſisteth. Communicating of mutuall duties, is the bond of ciuill or ſociable life, whereby a man in any condition of life, in harmefull occurrences, and vnfortunate accidents, is preſerued, helped, relieued, and the beneuolous aſpect of neighbours congratulating his proſperous ſtate, is a lightſome, pleaſant, and comfortable thing. Moreouer, danti dabitur, &amp; qua menſura metimini, vobis metietur. But this communicating is of all gifts and duties, towards equals, ſuperiours, and inferiours, euen of euery one in their place and calling towards others, in oeconomike, ethike, politike ſtate. Thus farre the Heathen man goeth, but here he makes a ſtand, he cannot tranſcend his Orbe. All things are made for man, ſaith Cicero, and man is borne for man, to be ſeruiceable and comfortable one to another in ſociable life. Therefore all theſe degrees doe but as it were conſtitute the veſſell of the quickning ſpirit.
            
               6. The ſixt and laſt degree therefore of felicity, is piety towards God, ſincerity in diuine worſhip, briefly ſhut vp in this word, Feare
               
               God, and keepe his Commandements. It is totum hominis, or totus homo, the whole man, without which he is but praeſtantiſſimum brutum. What this feare, and obedience is, is ſet downe in the Law of Moſes at large, which is more largely and plainely expounded by the Prophets, and they againe by the life and doctrine of our Sauiour Chriſt, and that againe by the Apoſtles, and they by Paſtors and Teachers to the Worlds end. This is that compleate ſoueraigne good, of ſoule, body, and ſtate, poſitiuely taught in this Treatiſe. Which in a word is this, the wiſe demeanor of a man towards himſelfe, towards others, towards God, in things concerning his owne body, and perſon, concerning communicating, or ſympathiſing others, concerning diuine worſhip according to the direction of Gods Word. Theſe degrees muſt not be ſundered, but kept intire of him that would be compleatly happy, ſo farre forth as happineſſe can be obtained in this confuſed, enormous World. Men being ignorant of this ſixe-fold vnion, fall into many errours, run out into many extremities, and plunge themſelues into a gulfe of miſeries, yea, and digladiate among themſelues, prayſing, diſprayſing, blaming, excuſing they know not what, euen toſſed in a labyrinth. But he that builds on this ground, and walketh in this light, riddeth himſelfe and others out of many, euen infinite errours, and miſeries of this vaine life. One man will be very deuout and zealous, but what inconueniences runneth he into, when he neglests his particular calling? and of the practiſe of how many duties and goods that by him might be done, is he depriued? Cert
                     •
                   in quo peccaueris, in eodem puniêris. Wherein a man ſinneth, therein ſhall he be puniſhed; pouerty, debt, impriſonment, &amp;c. ſhall fall vpon him, and the obiecting of his profeſſion to ſcandall, is no ſmall matter. Sed peccat in tutiorem partem; But I ſay, what inforceth that offence at all? He that ſaith, Deum timè, feare God; ſaith alſo, Mandata eius ſerua, Keepe his commandements; whereof diligent labour in a calling is one. For want whereof a man omitteth much good, and offers himſelfe to many temptations, and ſnares. Another laboureth diligently, and worſhippeth God, but neglects the duties of charity, whereof in theſe dayes there are not a few. Saint Iames complayneth of ſuch. Another inſiſting on duties of charity, neglecteth the duties of piety. But to reckon vp the extremities, and errours

of men in the breach of this vnion, which yet would all be wiſe, and ſeeme happy to themſelues, is an endleſſe worke. A ſound and prudent ſpirit within a man, is better then a World of Bookes. Therefore Saint Iohn ſaith, that thoſe few leaues of the Goſpell by him penned, among a World of Bookes that might haue beene made of Chriſts ſayings and doings, are ſufficient, what needeth more? Neither the whole Scriptures, nor the Ʋolumes of the Fathers, nor what can be vttered by voyce, can preuaile, where an heart is wanting. And who can giue man an vnderſtanding heart, but God onely? yet are men preſumptuous, therefore they come not to the fountaine of wiſedome, and ſo liue and die in vanity. Thus haue I briefly declared the very life, and ſubſtance of this Treatiſe of the wiſe and aged King, whoſe ſentences, though they ſeeme to be difficult and independent, collected by ſome that haue taken them from his mouth, vpon occaſions vttered; yet are they doubtleſſe a continued ſpeech, purpoſely penned, euery thing orderly cohearing, and methodically colliming at the ſame obiect. The more wiſe and aged, moſt commonly the leſſe diſcourſiue; and much talking is tedious, their ſentences are briefe, fundamentall, and pithy, and their words ſeeme oft times very independent. Beſides this, Solomon, without regard to artificiall ſtructure, vttereth his experiments, and that from the heart to the heart, not from the braine to the eare, (as common vſe among many is in theſe heartleſſe dayes) and alſo as the ſanctifying Spirit of God moued him. Therefore are his words pure without tincture, altogether of ſpirituall relliſh, and without any taſte of the caske. For his maine drift is to caſt man wholly out of himſelfe, that he might be found in Chriſt alone, or elſe be vtterly loſt. Cap. 12. 13. Phil. 3. 8. 9. 10.
            
            Now my earneſt deſire, reuerend, religious, and learned Gentlemen, louers of learning, ſpeciall fauourers, and friends of the learned and vertuous, is, that you would iudge theſe labours of mine amongſt others, worthy your acceptation, rather valuing the ſame in your generous ſpirits, according to the mind of him that honoureth, and loueth your vertues, then reſpecting the dignity of the worke it ſelfe, which notwithſtanding ſhall be ſuch like as it ſhall pleaſe you to accept, and the Lord to worke by it in the hearts of the Readers without whoſe quickning Spirit, the whole Scripture is but a dead

letter, but into whoſe noſtrils the Lord ſhall breathe againe the breath of eternall life, it is to them no noſe of waxe, as the Papiſts ſay, but a plaine euen way, a lanterne to the feete, a light to the paths. Howſoeuer, we are vnto God the ſweet ſauour of Chriſt in them that are ſaued, and in them that periſh; 2 Cor. 2. 15. And vnto you this publike teſtimony of my obſeruance, and loue for your loue to our gifts and calling, I truſt ſhall be acceptable; which I ſhall recompence againe with my continuall and hearty prayers to Almighty God, the Father of lights, and fountaine of all good, that the true felicity and chiefe good reuealed to, and penned by Solomon, and here explained, may be plentifully conferred vpon you, to your greateſt comfort here in your ſpirits, ſoules, bodies, ſtates, and perfect glory of all in the Kingdome of glory.

            AN EXPOSITION OR COMMENTARIE ON ECCLESIASTES.
         
            CHAPTER I.
            
               
                  Verſe 1. 
                  The words of the PREACHER, the Sonne of DAVID, King in Ieruſalem.
               
               
                  The Inſcription. 
                  IN this Treatiſe of Solomon, two things are to be conſidered. Firſt, the Title or Inſcription, layd downe in this Verſe. Secondly, the Subſtance, Subiect or Matter thereof, from Verſe 2. to the end of the Booke.
               
                  The Words of the Preacher. The Author is not ſimply named, but deſcribed, I. By the perſon that hee taketh vpon him at this time, the Preacher, not the Politician▪ not handling matter of mans outward ſtate, but of his ſpirituall ſtate▪ teaching Mortification, or the abnegation of himſelfe, and the carnall conſideration and vſage of all things on the one ſide, and the ſubiection of himſelfe, and all things with him

to God onely in feare, and obedience on the other ſide. This word Coheleth, tranſlated the Preacher, is of the feminine gender, ſignifying properly an Aſſembly or Congregation; figuratiuely, a Function or Office in the Church: And it is tranſlated of the Greekes. ECCLESIASTES, a Preacher, or one ſpeaking in the Church: Or it may ſignifie (as here it doth) a perſon revnited or reconciled to the Church; and ſo
                     •
                  t is a note of a penitentiarie teaching others out of his owne experience of ſtanding, falling, riſing.
               This reconciled Penitent, Church man, or Preacher, is notified by foure names in the Scripture, viz Solomon, that is, Peaceable, 1 Chron. 22. 9. Iedidiah, that is, Beloued of the Lord▪ 2 Sam. 12. 25 Lemuel, that is Him that appertayneth to God, Prou. 31. 1. Coheleth, in this place.
               II. He is deſcribed by his relatiue, or parentage, Sonne of Dauid. An argument to moue attention, and more ſerious conſideration of that which is ſpoken, and to procure beneuolence. Dauid of Dod, ami
                        •
                     us, dilectus.For Dauid his father feared God, and was beloued of God and the people, whereof hee tooke his name.
               III. By his dignity, or office, King. An argument to moue docility, and awfull regard, drawne from the dignity and authority of the perſon, and duty of the hearers. His office is explicated by the obiect thereof, vnderſtood in the next word, viz. the people of God in Ieruſalem.
               IIII. By the place of his habitation, in Ieruſalem. Ieruſalem, the Sacrarie, Chappell, or Treaſure-houſe of wiſedome, the Fountaine of wiſedome, the onely place of Gods worſhip and ſpeciall preſence: And therefore a King excelling all other Kings of the earth, which are but meere worldly politicians, not ſanctified, not guided by diuine wiſedome, but ignorant of the glory of God, which is the end that Kings ſhould onely ayme at.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 2. 
                  Vanitie of Vanities, ſaith the Preacher, Vanity of Vanities, all is vanitie.
               
               
                  The Propoſite. THe maine purpoſe of Solomon in this booke, is, to ſhew wherein the bleſſed eſtate, and happie condition of man

in this vale of miſerie conſiſteth. Which ſeeing that it is not to be found in the world▪ I meane, out of the Church, the wiſe-men of the world are of ſo different, yea contrary opinions among themſelues, and all aberre from the truth, becauſe being in darkeneſſe, they neither know God nor themſelues, neither what is good, nor what is ill for man in this vaine life. Againe, they lay downe this for a ground or principle, that there is a Summum bonum, or felicitie, by the wiſedom, and endeauour of man to be found in the things of the world: But this ground being falſe, all their buildings muſt needes fall downe to the ground. But Solomon here by the ſpeciall inſtruction and direction of the ſpirit of God, layeth downe ſuch a felicity as the world by their wiſedome, could not comprehend. The briefe ſumme whereof is this; Feare God, and keepe his Commandements, or in a word, faithfull 
                  The Theme or Queſtion.
                  obedience is the chiefe good. This is the Theme, or queſtion, as appeares by the concluſion of all, Chapter 12. 13. Now the argument of confirmation is thus framed: Principall Syllogiſme.
               
               
                  
                     Prop.Either is the feare of God and obedience to his lawes the chiefe good, or elſe it is to be found in, &amp; by the things of this world, which wee call the goods of the body, the goods of the minde, the goods of fortune, or outward goods.
                  
                     Aſſum.But it is not to be found in and by theſe things.
                  
                     Concl.Therefore is the feare of God, and obedience to his lawes, the chiefe good.
               
               The Propoſition is euident, the Aſſumption is to be proued. 
                     Proſſyllogiſme, i. A reaſon confirming the Principall.
               
               
                  
                     Prop. If all be vanity moſt vaine, then there is no felicitie, or chiefe good to be found in the things of the world.
                  
                     Aſſum. But all things are vanity moſt vaine:
                  
                     Concl. Therefore, &amp;c.
               
               And ſo he proceedeth forward in the handling of this argument to the end of the booke, which hee concludeth, Chap. 12. 8. So that this verſe is a Proſſyllogiſme, or reaſon added to the principall; in the handling whereof the whole body of this booke conſiſteth. Hebraiſmus.
                  Vanitie of vanities. An hebrew phraſe of ſpeech. They expreſſe the comparatiue often by a prepoſition, and the ſuperlatiue by doubling of the

ſame word, which noteth excellency or perfection. As if hee ſhould ſay, all things are moſt vaine, or vanity it ſelfe. It is firſt amplified by a repetition, wherein the adiunct is put for the ſubiect, to ſignifie the certainty of this fundamentall truth, which is Epiz
                        •
                     uxis▪
                  figured as an ingemination, or redoubling of the ſame ſound, more vehemently to moue the affections. Secondly confirmed by teſtimony, the dignity whereof dependeth on the office of the ſpeaker. The Preacher faith it, therefore beleeue it. Aged men are to be heard with reuerence, Iob 32. 6. 7. I am young, and yee are very old, wherefore I was afraid, and durſt not ſhew you mine opinion. I ſaid, dayes ſhould ſpeake, and the multitude of yeares ſhould ſhew wiſedome. Conuerts are to be greatly regarded, Acts 22. 19. 20. So Paul argueth. Surely they will receiue my teſtimony, for they know that I impriſoned, and beat in euery Synagogue them that beleeued on thee: And Preachers eſpecially, Mal. 2. 7. The Prieſts lippes ſhould preſerue knowledge, and they ſhould ſeeke the Law at his mouth. So Oſee. 4. 4. Therefore is Solomon to be beleeued, being wiſe, aged, experienced. By vaine, is meant imperfect, vncertaine, tranſitory, voyd of contentation, full of griefe, fruitleſſe, to no end, nothing. Briefely, both man and all things with man are naught, and come to naught, 1 Cor. 2. 6. We ſpeake wiſedome among them that are perfect, yet not the wiſedome of this world, nor the Princes of this world, that come to naught. What hath man than to glory in but in the Croſſe of Chriſt, whereby he is dead to the world, and the world to him? as Paul ſaith. Man therefore, and whatſoeuer is within him, without him, about him, proceedeth from him, is moſt vaine, euen nothing, Phil 3. 8. till hee be a new creature, and all things renued with him, 2 Cor. 5. 17. Henceforth we know no man after the fleſh, yea though we haue knowne Chriſt after the fleſh, yet now henceforth know we him no more. Therefore if any man be in Chriſt, be is a new creature: old things are paſſed away, behold, all things are become new.
               
            
            
               
               
                  Verſe 3. 
                  What profit hath a man of all his labour which hee taketh vnder the Sunne?
               
               
                  
                     Epilogiſme, A Reaſon confirming the reaſon of a Reaſon. THe Epilogiſme confirming the Proſſyllogiſme. All things are moſt vaine, becauſe man can reape no profit, no contentation of minde, no quietneſſe of heart of all the endeauours, cares, labours of body and minde, wherewith in vaine he wearieth himſelfe all the dayes of his life. The argument is figured by a communication or queſtion, to intimate the certaine and infallible truth thereof: For both the ignorant and the wiſe, euen euery man that commeth into the World, is wholly carried with an opinion of an earthly felicity; to the obtaining whereof, there is, as he iudgeth, an aptitude in man, and a poſſibility in the things of the World. The moſt learned and wiſeſt placed it, ſome in diuine contemplation without the word of God, ſome in morall vertue onely, ſome in vertue and worldly proſperity together, ſome in riches, ſome in honour, ſome in one thing, ſome in another. And euery man feeling manifold miſeries, troubles, and wants, wherewith he is compaſſed and filled, doth imagine to himſelfe a poſſibility of deliuery and freedome on the one ſide, and an happy enioying of the contrary good on the other ſide. Ah that I were freed once from this, or that; if I had but this, or that; I could doe this, or that; I would euen deſire no more; I ſhould thinke my ſelfe happy, &amp;c. doth euery man imagine. Hereupon hee beginneth to buckle himſelfe to his worke, to gather his wits together, to beſtirre his ſtumps, and either ruſheth violently forward, as the Horſe ruſheth into the battaile; or elſe he proceedeth warily, wiſely, fundamentally, as they that ſpend all in ſearching out the Philoſophers ſtone, but neuer finde it. Of thoſe Zophar, one of Iobs kinſmen ſaith; Iob 11. 12. 
                     Ʋaine man would be wiſe, though man be borne like a wild Aſſes Colt. The reaſons of this vaine proiect, are
               Firſt, becauſe man cannot looke beyond the world; he is confined within the limits of the Spheres, hee is in bondage vnder the curſe; his phronema, mens, or pureſt wiſedome, is

nothing elſe but luſt, or brutality. 1 Ioh. 2. 16. All that is in this world, as the luſt of the fleſh▪ the luſt of the eyes, and the pride of life▪ is not of the Father, but of the world▪
                   But man knoweth not this his miſery, and how than ſhall hee know the right way to be rid out of it? So than euery natural man is a foole. Rom. 1. 22. A beaſt; Ier. 10. 14. A wild Aſſes colt; Iob 11. 12.
               Secondly, being but a foole, a beaſt, a wild Aſſe, hee looketh on the glory, the riches, and the beauty of the world, and iudgeth according to the outward appearance thereof, neither conſidering the vanity that is in himſelfe, nor that which is in the creatures: For Sathan taketh away his heart, and bewitcheth him with the pleaſant ſhewes of that which is not. So he ſet the World before the eyes of Chriſt, in a glorious ſhew or viſion, to rauiſh him with the loue thereof: So he ſet before the eyes of our firſt Parents a better &amp; happier ſtate, than that wherein God had placed them. Thus he doth with euery man; 2 Cor. 4. 4. He is the God of this world, blinding the eyes of men with the ſhew of a worldly glory and felicity, that the true glory and felicity of the Goſpell might not appeare to them, but rather ſeeme ignominious, baſe, and contemptible: That he ex
                     •
                  olleth, and preferreth, this he debaſeth, and ſuppreſſeth by all meanes, as we ſee how he worketh in and by his inſtruments, worldly minded men. The like to this we ſee in the flickering painted Harlot, who by her ſubtle ſhewes, lookes, geſtures, glaunces, rauiſheth the young man hee knoweth not with what vehement fancies. Amor tollit de cardine mentem. He looketh at her, he longeth after her, he dreameth on her, ſhee is as an Angell in his fancie; the full poſſeſſion of her is his felicity: But when hee findeth by experience that this felicity is nothing but the ſtocks, poxe, and gallowes, ſhee is now a loathſome carrion, and as a ſcab'd vlcerous iade, and a limme of the Diuell to company with.
               Whence commeth this deluſion? Firſt, it ariſeth out of mans owne vaine heart, and is cheriſhed by Satans fotures. The ſicke and weakly, thinketh the ſtrong and healthfull happy. The deformed, admireth the beautifull. The poore

bleſſeth the rich. The ignorant and baſe, admire the honourable, and men of authority and power. The pleaſant ſeate, ſumptuous buildings, gorgeous apparrell, delicious fare, proud attendance, variable delights and pleaſures of the rich, rauiſh the minde of him that lacketh theſe. He lookes on theſe, and pineth, iudging according to the outward appearance. Sed latet anguis in herba. Hee conſidereth not the vanity, and ſorrow of this ſplendide miſery, this beautifull Harlot. It is like a beautifull picture drawne with white and red colours in ſackcloth, which afarre off is very louely, but neere by it is like the filthy matter of a ſore or wound, purulent rottenneſſe, or the backe of a galled Horſe. No man euer yet found any conſtant contentation in any ſtate: yet may his outward appearance deceiue others, and anothers him.
               Secondly, therefore this deluſion ariſeth from the vaineglorie and pompe of the world, deceiuing, and being deceiued. It is the common corruption of man to pride, to boaſt, to ſet forth himſelfe, to bleſſe himſelfe, as Iob ſaith; to colour and couer his vanitie from others, to draw them into admiration of him, and to be admired of others is his ioy and delight: For their falſe teſtimony of his happineſſe mitigateth, rather blindeth the ſight of his vanitie, or miſeries from himſelfe, (for of thoſe doth euery carnall man deſire to be inſenſible, that he may more freely reioyce, and ſolace himſelfe in the fleſh.) Who is the happy man? ſaith Craeſus to Solon. Euery one flattered him, and if this Philoſopher had done the like, he would euen haue runne madde, and ruſht, as Alexander did, out of mankinde into the ranke of the gods. To what purpoſe did Ezechiah ſhew all the treaſures of his Kingdome to the Embaſſadours of the King of Babel? Eſay 39. 2. And what one man almoſt in the world hauing friends come to his houſe, doth not the like? See an example hereof in Haman, Heſt. 5. 10. 11, 12. Wee would all ſeeme to haue this imagined worldly happineſſe, faine would we bleſſe our ſelues, and be admired of others: But we are but proud bankerupts, gentlemen to day, feſtiuall and gorgeous, and to morrow beggars, and caſt into priſon. All is

but the crackling of thornes vnder a pot, a great flame, a loud noyſe, light aſhes, follie, vanitie, nothing. To conclude, euery naturall man imagineth that profit, yea, jithron, durable profit, is to be found and wrought out by wit and labour in the world. There is a felicity to be had, and all mens ſtudy is to find out the right way to attaine it: He thinketh his game to be good, if hee can but rightly play his cards. If but one poore tradeſman hath gotten goods together, and through the increaſe of a ſmall ſtocke, hath at length made a great purchaſe, and left it to his heire, who ſtill increaſeth it, and putteth his ſonne to the Innes of Court, &amp;c. whereby he becommeth a gentleman, and ſo forward, than are all beggars in hope. This one example ſerueth to cut off all deſpaire, and impoſſibility; yea, prouoketh a thought of the like proiect, that lyeth dead in the bottome of the braine. But if the world beginne to runne a little on the beggars ſide, his hope is preſently kindled, thought ariſeth after thought, and calleth vp this dead proiect, his bloud riſeth, his pulſes begin to beate, as he that hath found a purſe full of gold, he ſtirres about, his heart panteth, his minde is in the top of the world, why may he not be a Tamerlane? But of Gods Kingdome and glorie there is no thought at all in him. Doth any man doubt of this that I ſay? Why doe men ſo ſtudy, and breake their braines night and day for preferment? Why do they ſo weary themſelues with heaping vp riches? Why doe they ſo climbe to honors? And why doe they euen ſell their ſoules and bodies to the Diuell, to obtaine worldly prerogatiues, if there were no profit, no contentation, no felicity in them? Surely they doe not thinke that they are filling a bottomeleſſe tub, but fore-caſt great profit, pleaſure, and contentment of minde to ariſe of their labours hereafter; which thing the rich man, Luke 12. vainely boaſted of. Pſal. 49. 11. Their inward thought is, (the vaine imagination of euery carnall heart) that their houſes ſhall continue for euer, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names. Euery man knowes that he ſhall die, yet hee laboureth and ſtriueth, and putteth off from day to day, as though hee ſhould liue for euer. The Diuell ſo bewitcheth him, yea, ſtealeth

away his heart, that hee knoweth, and neuer thinketh what he knoweth; he beleeueth, and doubteth: Therefore ſaith Dauid, Lord teach me to number my dayes, that I may applie my heart to wiſedome. The manifold glaunces, ejaculations, and fancies that luſt ſuggeſteth, and Sathan ingeſteth into the minde of man, are ſtrange and wonderfull: But it is more ſtrange, that contrary to the truth, which he heareth, ſeeth, knoweth, they ſhould carry him away, at leaſt make him a mindleſſe, dreaming, vnprofitable wanderer, like a feather in the winde, without all reſolution. The caſe is common: A foole hath alwayes a knaue attending on him; hee heareth his friend truely counſelling, and carefully admoniſhing, he knoweth him to be without deceit; yet the knaue whom he ſuſpecteth and feareth, carrieth him away. A foole is bound to his luſt, the diuell and the knaue worke vpon the luſt, which hee calleth humouring, and ſo catch the foole.

                  One generation paſſeth away, and another generation commeth: but the earth abideth for euer.
               
               THe vnprofitableneſſe of all the ſtudies, endeauours and labours of man, whereby he enquireth and ſearcheth, deuiſeth and plotteth continually to finde out a felicity or happy reſt, is argued by the inſtable, tranſitorie, variable, vncertaine condition, and circular courſe, both of mankinde and of the world, with all the creatures, their effects and euents. The World with all his creatures is Gods engine, for his owne vſe, created in perfection of beauty, wherein God ſhewed forth his incomprehenſible wiſedome &amp; goodneſſe to the view of Angels and men: But through the diſobedience of man, for whoſe ſeruice, vnder God, all things were made, the curſe was layd vpon him, as a iuſt iudgement, and vpon all creatures with him. For in that it is ſaid, Thou ſhalt ſurely dye, Gen. 2. 17. There is the curſe or corruption of the Soule: And where it is ſaid, Curſed be the earth for thy ſake, Geneſ. 3. 17. Here is the corruption of the whole

engine, with all the creatures. Now this curſe or corruption▪ is want of created vigour and ſtrength, ataxie, and anomie, diſorder, iniquitie, confuſion, and in one word, Vanitie: So that all this vniuerſe is a maſſe of vanitie, mortalitie. And who can bring a cleane thing out of filthineſſe? ſaith Iob. Who can worke felicitie out of miſerie? bleſſedneſſe out of curſedneſſe? profit out of loſſe? conſtancie out of inſtabilitie? ſtrength out of weakeneſſe? ioy out of ſorrowe? ſoundneſſe out of corruption and rottenneſſe? life out of death? This thing all men ſtriue to doe, becauſe they neither know the vanitie that is in themſelues, nor that which is in the creatures. But they doe nothing elſe but heape vanitie vpon vanitie, as hee that ſtruggleth in the mire, and medleth with pitch.
               
                  One generation paſſeth away, &amp;c. The words are a Proſepilogiſme, or reaſon confirming the former, dr
                     •
                  wne from the fleeting and corruptible ſtate of man, and all worldly things, according to Solomons common obſeruation of all things in the world. The reaſon may be framed thus:
               
                  
                     Propoſ. If both man and all things with man be inconſtant, tranſitorie, vncertaine, mutable, corruptible, then are all mens ſtudies and labours vnprofitable and fruitleſſe, yeelding no ſound contentation, or quiet.
                  
                     Aſſump. But both man, and all things with man are of this condition.
                  
                     Concluſ. Therefore there remaynes nothing, no contentation, no ſound or durable good wherein to reſt, to man of all his labours.
               
               The Propoſition is manifeſt. The Aſſumption is confirmed by an Induction grounded on obſeruation, which is a reaſon by many particulars proouing and concluding an vniuerſall, againſt which there cannot any one particular be obiected. This induction is of all ſuperiour and inferiour parts of the world, to wit, of Man, the centre of the world, Verſe 4. and of the circumference, to wit, of the Sunne, Moone, Starres, Heauens, verſe 5. of the windes, verſe 6. of riuers, verſe 7. Nec in caeteris contrarium eſt videre, and of all things, verſe 8. both ſimples and compounds, vniuerſall cauſes, and their effects.
               
                  
                  One generation paſſeth, &amp;c. The firſt particular. Not onely particular men doe vaniſh away through ſome extraordinary diſeaſes, or outward caſualties, and their ſtates alſo, but euen whole generations ſucceſſiuely, yea the moſt healthfull, ſtrong, and ſound are diſſolued againe into their duſt, and ſo is the moſt firmely ſetled ſtate diſperſed and brought to nothing by an vnchangeable decree. All things were created of the earth, and to the earth they returne againe.
               
                  But the earth abideth for euer. The vanitie of mankinde is illuſtrated by a compariſon of the vnlike. Man vaniſheth away ſuddenly as, a flower in the ſpring, but the earth, more vile than man, laſteth euer. The earth is as it were a Stage, whereon euery man in his generation acteth his part, and afterward departeth with all his pompe and crackle neuer to be ſeene againe, nor remembred any more. Abideth euer, that is to ſay, in compariſon of the periſhing generations of all things, which riſe and fall, ebbe and flow continually. Otherwiſe it ſelfe alſo ſhall melt with feruent heat, and be purged with fire. By euer, is meant till the end of all things: Earth is put for all the elements by the figure Synecdoche, and for the heauens alſo. The whole engine ſhall be changed, Pſal. 102. 25. 26. 2 Pet. 3. 10. Therefore man hath no profit of all his labour, the fruit of all his contentious endeauours is a meere nothing. For by reaſon of this inconſtancie, and fluxibility of himſelfe, and all things, he doth but lay his foundation on the floods. He vaniſheth away in his ſtudies, and periſheth in his labours, as a Snayle. His life is but a continuall dying or paſſage to death, and his workes are like himſelfe. When we looke vpon the earth, let vs remember our birth and buriall. Our bodies, names and workes ſhall be all alike, euen as the duſt blowne into the ſea with the winde, and as the ſmoake vaniſhed in the ayre. Finally, we are more vile than the earth, for it is permanent, but we are moſt fraile, and neuer abide in one ſtay, but haſten like a Poſt-man to our end.
            
            
               
               
                  Verſe 5. 
                  The Sunne alſo ariſeth, and the Sunne goeth downe, and haſteth to the place where he aroſe.
               
               THe ſecond particular. As the generations of man▪ for whom all other things were made, are not durable, neyther are the things of man, his counſels, and acts durable, but new generations differing from the former ſucceede: ſo likewiſe the Heauens, the Sunne and other Starres are reſtleſſe in their motions, and changeable in their courſes; ſo that when we looke vpon the Sunne, or but open our eyes to behold the light, we may cleerely ſee the Sunne acting before our eyes, as it were on the ſtage of the firmament, the vnſtedfaſt condition and periſhing ſtate of man, hauing his circular motion, after the ſimilitude of the heauens, yea, and alſo cauſed by the heauens, which are ſecond cauſes or vniuerſall inſtruments of God for the foture of all things, both elements and elementarie bodies, and in that reſpect may well be called the baſis or firmament of the world. But contrarily by accident, that is, by reaſon of corruptibilitie, weakneſſe, want of vigour in the creature, and in man aboue the reſt, which is the effect of the curſe denounced, Gen. 3. they are the conſumers, and deſtroyers of all things. For as the Sunne is the generall inſtrument, or moſt remote cauſe of generation and preſeruation, (Sol et homo generat hominem, ſaith Ariſtotle,) ſo by accident it corrupteth, and deſtroyeth all things, and that both by his diurnall and annuall reuolution, to wit, from Eaſt to Weſt, from South to North, cauſing Day and Night, Summer and Winter, with other ſeaſons of the day and yeare.
               To conclude: The life of man as concerning his bodily ſtate, is a continuall paſſage from the wombe whence it iſſueth, to the graue into which it falleth, as the Sunne ſeemeth to riſe out of the earth, and to deſcend into the earth; and man in his iſſue or progenie may be ſaid to returne circularly againe, with the Sunne, out of the earth, out of the wombe into the horizon, into the world. Againe, concerning his outward ſtate, he hath his aſcending, &amp; deſcending,

birth, and buriall with the Sunne. For there is no conſtancie of any ſtate, or kindred, though one continue longer than another, as the Oake out-liueth the Aſhe, and the Aſhe the Willow, yet all dye, and vaniſh in their time: For the Lord raiſeth vp the poore out of the duſt, and the needy out of the dunghill, that hee may ſet him with Princes, Pſal. 113. Againe. Pſal. 107. 40. He poureth contempt vpon Princes, and cauſeth them to wander in the wilderneſſe, where there is no way, 1 Sam. 2. 7. He maketh poore, and maketh rich, hee bringeth lowe, and lifteth vp. So that with the Sunne there is a double motion of mankinde; one of life, which is diurnall, and another of ſtate, which is annuall, I meane, the houſe, or kingdome of longeſt continuance. Laſtly, in this certaine and ſtedfaſt motion there is nothing but vncertaintie, and vnſtedfaſtneſſe, therefore no felicitie but vanitie.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 6. 
                  The winde goeth toward the South, and turneth about vnto the North; it whirleth about continually, and the winde returneth againe according to his circuits.
               
               THe third particular. As the Sunne is wheeled about with reſtleſſe motion, ſo are the windes alſo whirled about according to their manifold circuits. The former wee ſee, this we heare, and feele, which teach vs to ſee, heare, and feele our vanity, vnleſſe we be ſenceleſſe. The wind is a neerer inſtructer, beating on our faces, and ſounding in our eares, yea, piercing into our eares and heads, to awake our dull ſpirits, to cauſe vs remember what we are, what our workes are, and what our end, and their end is. So that vnleſſe we be in a dead ſleepe, drunke with ſenceleſſe carnality, we cannot but remember the brittleneſſe of our bodies, the incertainty of our liues, the inſtability of our ſtates, and all things with vs running in their circuits; as the windy exhalations aſcending out of the earth to the region of the cloudes, are from thence flung backe by contrary and diſcordant qualities, and ſo run circularly in the aire from South to North, or from what places ſoeuer they ariſe, towards the ſame places againe. Vaine therefore are earthly wiſe men,

that thinke their houſes ſhall continue for euer, and call their lands by their owne names, as Dauid ſaith. But why doe they ſo labour in the winde? Becauſe a brutiſh man knoweth not, neither doth a foole vnderſtand that God hath ſubdued all things to mutability, and vanity, that in him onely wee might ſeeke for durable riches, and the true and euerlaſting felicity.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 7. 
                  All the Riuers runne into the Sea, yet the Sea is not full: vnto the place from whence the Riuers come, thither they returne againe.
               
               THe fourth particular. Not onely the winds ariſe, make a noyſe for a little ſeaſon, and then die, after which others ariſe againe in like ſort; but the waters alſo are circularly carried, by perpetuall ingreſſe and regreſſe, into the ſeate, and from the ſeate of waters, the Sea. As the Sea is the receptacle of freſh waters, ſo doe her ſalt waters re▪paſſe through the veines, and conduit pipes of the earth, ſtrained and qualified by diuers Mines, and tempers of mould of magneticall nature, which appeareth in this, that the Sea is not filled. For the earth thirſteth for moiſture, and attracteth from the Sea, as the hand, fingers, toes, and all members doe blood from the liuer, by many net-like veines ramified all ouer, which breake through the breaſts of poroſe and rocky hilles, through clefts of quarries, and ſo runne downe into the Sea, from whence they came: Whereof aroſe that ſpeech, He that knoweth not the way to the Sea, let him ſeeke for a Riuer to be his guide. As it is no maruell that the bloud ſhould aſcend out of the liuer to the higher parts of the body; no more wonder is it, that the waters ſhould ſpring out of the high mountaines, as milke doth out of womens breaſts, ſeeing that the earth, nay, whole nature is magneticall, or alchymiſticall. Wee maruell not that bloud and milke ſhould be ſweete, though we eate ſalt meats, and as little cauſe haue we to maruell at the other. The Fiſhes of the Sea are freſh, not ſalt; for the Sea is their element, as the earth is to her creatures: And when a creature beginneth to reſemble his element,

it is a token of diſſolution, as when blew▪ greene, yellow colours, &amp;c. beginne to appeare in the fleſh, which we call earthly, and dead colours. So ſprings and torrents are the fruits of the Sea, or rather the Sea is the aliment of the earths body, which conuerteth her ſalt waters into milke, for the nouriſhing of all that ſpring out of her wombe. Or, whether it be, as Ariſtotle thinketh, that the waters are conuerted into liquid, or rorid ayre, which is ſuckt in of the earth, by her magneticall thirſt, and congealed into many diſperſed ſmall droppes, as moiſture attracted through the poroſe and ſupple bladder becommeth a torrent of vrine: which vapours gathering together in the veines of the earth, for that purpoſe ordained of God, breake forth of the hilles. But according to the former doctrine, theſe drops are rather euaporated and ſweat out from thoſe veines, to ſuſtaine and moiſten the rootes of vegetables in the vpper parts of the earth. As for the attraction of liquid ayre, dewes, and raines, the earth hath her Syſtolen, &amp; Diaſtolen, her dilatation and conſtriction, which wee call the breath in liuing creatures, ſhee continually draweth in, and ſendeth out. Liuing creatures alſo are not onely fedde by the roote of the ſtomach, but by the ayre drawne in, and ſent forth by the breath, which is temperature of the hearts heate, nutritiue of the animall and vitall ſpirits. and purgatiue of vnnaturall vapours. As the humours haue their purgatiue paſſages, ſo haue the ſpirits. The eare is a purgatiue veſſell, as well as the inſtrument of hearing; and ſo of the other ſenſes. To conclude, which way ſoeuer this paſſage of Riuers is, they returne from whence they came; and ſuch a circular motion is there of man, and all humane things: Therefore in this world there is no firme ground for man to build vpon; But the ſecureſt man, and the ſureſt ſtate ſhall be diſſolued, diſperſed, and brought to naught: Wherefore let euery wiſe man build vpon the Rocke Ieſus Chriſt, and his worke ſhall remaine for euer.
            
            
               
               
                  Verſe 8. 
                  All things are full of labour, man cannot vtter it: the eye is not ſatisfied with ſeeing, nor the eare with hearing.
               
               A Generall concluſion of all the particulars. As the generations of men, the heauens, the windes, the waters, are reſtleſſe; ſo are all things in their kindes inconſtant, tranſitory, fleeting. They trauaile in paine with man, they groane vnder the burden of corruption with him; and their diſorder, enmity, infirmity, miſery, corruption, vanity, ſheweth forth to man that he is euen ſuch like; yea, his condition is worſe then theirs: For whatſoeuer is within man, is without him; and whatſoeuer is without him, is within him. So that whereſoeuer he turneth his eyes, he may behold his vanity. The plaſme, or veſſell of mans ſoule, is his brutall nature, which we call the body, which is the centre of the world, or vnion of the whole, or an vniuerſall nature, wherein all particulars are vnited. For doe we not ſee how euery creature is the Chaos to his ſeede, as the matter whence it firſt ariſeth and iſſueth, and the ſeede againe is the Chaos of the creature that ariſeth, and iſſueth thereout, whoſe members, as Dauid ſaith, are faſhioned day by day, when as yet there was none of them? Pſal. 139. 16. Therefore of man there is a twofold Anatomy, one of his body into members, another of his bodily nature into coſmicall parts or natures, whereof he is termed the little world. As man hath a ſimilitude, and proportion of members with all liuing creatures, ſo hath he alſo of their natures, and is an vnion or mixture of their natures. So that man is the text, and euery word in this text hath his Gloſſe, or Common-Place, to wit, ſome creature to explicate &amp; manifeſt it. He that would know the worke of the Spirit in the ſimples, the heauens and elements, might know it in the compounds, and how one compound is of like, or vnlike conditure▪ affected, and diſaffected to another, kinde vnto kinde, and kindes among themſelues. All things in their creation were placed in ſubordinate order, both in themſelues, and in reſpect of others; but by the curſe was that diſſolued, and contrary ataxie, or diſorder, and confuſion brought vpon

them. To proceede, the creatures of one element haue the proportion, and ſimilitude of the creatures of another element, and is the ſame as neere as the matter, and condition of the element will affoord. And euery element hath his degrees of creatures, whereof one commeth neerer to mans nature, than another; and one is more particular and vniuerſall than another: but all are full of enmity, impotency, miſery, vanity. Therefore in the creatures a man may behold his condition, his qualities, his ſhame, his brutiſhneſſe, his miſery, his vanity. For being the moſt compound, and vniuerſall nature, he is ſubiect to moſt corruptions, infirmities, diſeaſes, paines, aches, yea, to all the vanities, and miſeries of all the creatures, but yet according to the manner of his vnion or mixture, whereby he is indiuiduated, and differenced from all. Hence it is that naturall men in the Scriptures are compared to beaſts. For this brutality is mans nakedneſſe; Gen. 3. 7. ſhewing forth it ſelfe moſt in thoſe parts. When a man keepeth himſelfe in his ſpirit, his nakedneſſe is couered; when he breaketh forth into paſſions, yeelding to his brutall plaſme, id eſt, veſſell or body, his ſhame is diſcouered: but when his ſpirit ſeeketh to ſatisfie it in the luſts thereof, as Epicures doe, he is a very beaſt, and worſe than a beaſt. For a beaſt is but his plaſme, his veſſell is himſelfe, but man hath a ſpirit to gouerne his veſſell, to couer his ſhame, of which he is termed a man. But mans naturall ſpirit is falſe, a diſſembler,
an ignorant, impotent, vaine. It couereth ſhame indeed, but with a net, nay, with a menſtrous cloth. For as he cannot abide to be likened to a beaſt, ſo he ſtriueth to make himſelfe glorious, and by dignifying his perſon, and beautifying his body, and by diſguiſing and masking his beſtiality, to beget and maintaine in the minds of men a reuerend and diuine eſtimation of him. This is indeede neceſſary for all men to doe, as the light of nature teacheth, and for Princes and Gouernours eſpecially; yet cannot the Blackmoore change his skinne, nor the Leopard his ſpots. Yea, in ſeeking to couer ſhame, he moſt of all layeth it open, (not knowing ſo much) as our apparell now adayes, and the putting on thereof doth teſtifie; and in ſeeking to auoide brutality, and to

be as a God in the eyes and mindes of men, hee moſt of a l runneth into brutalitie, and becommeth a Leuiathan, Behemoth, the moſt beaſtlie of all men. It is the ſpirit of God that renueth, not couering, but taking away ſhame, not diſguiſing, masking, and colouring, but transforming. Chriſt was not naked, nor aſhamed: In him are we built vp new againe, our leproſie cleanſed, and the workes of the Deuill are diſſolued; He that is in him, neede not be aſhamed of any thing, though the world count it ſhame to be in him, Rom. 1. 16. Shameleſſe carnals know not their ſhame, namely, that their glorie and boaſting is bruitiſhneſſe, and deuilliſhneſſe.
               
                  All things are full of labour. By things, hee meaneth, 1. All Creatures. 2. All Actions and humaine affaires, whereby hee ſtriueth for this imaginary happineſſe, like a foole, a madde man, a wilde Aſſes colt. By Labour, he meaneth the ſphericall motion, the inſtability of things riſing, decaying fading, fainting, falling, fraile, and impotent; vncertaine, and corruptible, inordinate, and full of enuy, one againſt another, and all againſt man; and thoſe that are in ſome ſort obedient and ſeruiceable to man, are full of croſſenes, auknes, and vncertainty, and ſo are men among themſelues, in all their courſes and actions. As there is no bond of loue, ſo there can be no coordination or co-working of things together for mans good, nor of men among themſelues for their owne good. All is rents, ragges, and diſtractions: Euery thing is for it ſelfe, and euery man is for himſelfe, as a ragge or peece rent out of a garment, or limbe cut off, imagining a felicitie to himſelfe, but by this meanes running into Gods curſe, and mans hatred. Euery man ſtriueth to make a concurrence, or to bring in a confluence of all things, qu
                        •
                      poteſt, to the extent of his power, yea, to turne the world about to his priuate intended proiect of happie contentation, with remouing all obſtacles out of his way: But it is too heauy a maſſe for the wilde Aſſe, too difficult a matter for the ouer-reaching foole, that by violence, and ſubtiltie ſtriueth to ruſh or ſteale into Paradiſe againe. But againſt euery hill there is a dale, God hath ſet aduerſitie ouer-againſt proſperitie, euery thing is croſſe, and peruerſe, and runneth out into

extremities, quite out of created harmonie, and concord. There can no happie contentation be at all obtained indeed, but by their reconciliation, ſoliditie and conſtancie. But that can neuer be in ſtate of corruption, all things are ſo vnconſtant, croſſe, and fraile, yea, ſo rotten, like an old houſe, or corrupt body, that one part being repaired, another falleth downe, and one ſoare being cured, two breake out in another place. Hee therefore that laboureth to make this apt concurrence of things to obtaine his imagined happineſſe, doth but goe about to gather together wilde beaſts of all ſorts, that runne out on euery ſide, and being with infinite labour gotten together, will deuoure one another, or elſe all ſet vpon him; and to bring many men together to effect a worke, that are at variance among themſelues, and all oppoſite to him.
               Concerning humaine affaires, they are full of alterations and changes. Common-wealths, priuate ſtates, publike buſineſſes, domeſticall workes, and actions, are full of inconſtancie, vncertaintie, croſſeneſſe, trouble and griefe. Such croſſeneſſe is there in euery thing, ſo manifold euents contrarie to mans intendments, that the beſt gameſter hath commonly the worſt lucke: And euen thoſe things, whereof mans wiſedome and prouidence ſeeme to haue moſt power and command, doe fluctuate vpon vncertaine iſſues, in ſo much that he is altogether vncertaine, whether his intents ſhall ſucceede at all, and how, and whether they ſhall turne to his benefit, or hinderance, to the raiſing vp of himſelfe, or ouerthrow of himſelfe, and that which to day hee hath reſolutely determined, is to morrow through vnknowne occurences changed and quite diſanulled. To conclude: Of all theſe vanities, there is a conſtant reuolution.
               
                  Man cannot vtter it. An illuſtration by a compariſon of the Leſſe. The reuolution, inſtabilitie, vncertaintie, and vanitie of man in himſelfe, in his eſtate, in all his wayes, and imaginations, and alſo of the creatures with him, is more than man by word or writing is able to expreſſe. How vncertaine, and vnknowne are the ordinances of Heauen? And who hath ſet the dominion thereof in the earth? Iob
                  
38. 33. Who can foretell the ſeaſons of the yeare by the variable configurations of the ſtarres? Yet hath God ſet them for times, and ſeaſons. And one vnſeaſonable Summer, or Winter, Seed time or harueſt, turneth all mens ſtates vpſide downe, inriching one, and impoueriſhing another. Now the ſeede rotteth with too much moiſture; than both graſſe and graine is ſcorched with heat, and how ſlipperie is monie, and cattle vncertaine? Man and his eſtate therefore ſtanding vpon ſuch foundations is altogether inſtable, and vncertaine. And how ſure a foundation is that of the windes and the waters? Yet the Marriner muſt apply and commit himſelfe to them, he muſt obey them. Whether he ſhall returne home againe he knoweth not, nor when, nor which way, whether poore or rich. And whether the Sea, or Land be the ſafer habitation hee cannot determine. As the water ſwalloweth vp, ſo the fire deuoureth, danger is euery where. The continent is inconſtant, as the waters. For the earth is full of darkeneſſe, and cruell habitations. All the foundations of the earth are out of courſe. High-wayes, bye-wayes, and hedges are full of robbers, wilde beaſts, and ſerpents. A man is ſafe no where: One lyeth in waite for his tongue, another for his purſe, another for his body. Againe, things profitable, and good in their kinde ſometimes afford no profit to the owner, and ſometimes hurt. Contrarily, things of leaſt account, and that are as it were made for euill, doe a man the moſt good. What is good, what ill for a man, by all his wiſedome he cannot certainly know, no not for a moment, and blinde hope is doubtfull and fearefull. Whence then is ioy and full contentation? How long could it laſt if a man had it? The heathen ſhewed forth this inſtabilitie and vncertaintie of mans eſtate, in their card-play, and dice-play. For theſe playes are nothing but a ſportfull imitation of Gods prouidence, vnder the names of chaunce and fortune, with a wiſe diſpoſing of thoſe chances for the moſt good, and leaſt loſſe, that fortune dealeth. The beſt play, ſo the beſt courſe, hath oft times the worſt euent, and contrarily. So chancefull, changeable, and vncertaine are all worldly things.
               
                  
                  The eye is not ſatiſfied with ſeeing, nor the eare filled with hearing. The former compariſe figured by a gradation. Man can neither vtter by voyce, nor by his owne obſeruation perceiue, nor by relation of others attaine to the depth of Gods wiſedome in his workes, nor yet of the corruption that is in them. Although the wiſeſt, and moſt exerciſed in the contemplation of the creatures, and humane affaires ſtriue neuer ſo much to ſatisfie his curioſitie in ſearching out the vnknowne paths of God in all things, yet can he neuer finde it out, nor comprehend in minde the firme foundation of God in ſuch infinite contingencies, caſualties, inconſtancies, appearances, diſparences, courſes, and recourſes of all things: Yea, the counſels of God are ſo deepe, and his waies paſt finding out, that man imagineth that there is no knowledge, nor gouernement at all, or that he ſwayeth great matters onely, which maketh him ſo truſt to his owne wiſedome and prouidence, and thereby to worke out this happineſſe conceiued in his vaine minde. Moreouer, the frailety of all creatures in themſelues, and miſchieuous diſpoſitions one againſt another, and all againſt man, are infinite. Euery thing is but a Lyon in the grate, their obedience is outward
compulſion, not inward affection, as in their creation. But the frailty of mans body, inſtabilitie of his eſtate, the malice of his heart, the wickedneſſe of his actions againſt God and man, are wonderfull, his inuentions are innumerable. The wicked ſubtilties of a woman in inſnaring the fooliſh, and the madneſſe of fooles is endleſſe, Salomon ſaith that hee could not comprehend it, Chapter 7. God onely is able to deliuer a man. The miſeries, troubles, diſquietneſſe, vexations of man, in the beſt common-wealth, are manifold and great. Euery one is ſuſpitious, and afraid of other, the hearts of men are ſo deceitfull, their ſimulations, and diſſimulations ſo many, &amp; their diſpoſitions ſo variable. All things are carried by extremity, neither doth reaſon rule, nor good affection moue. And this is a common deceit in euery one, in euery matter to make an alledgement, &amp; ſhew of reaſon, and good will, when it is nothing but the awe of the Magiſtrate, or ſome other compulſion, or that one may make

vſe of another for the time. In which caſe euery one loueth himſelfe, but neuer one another. Miſchiefe, enuy, and deſtruction is in the heart of euery one naturally. And a politicke regiment is a grate for wilde beaſts, euery one hauing an habitation by himſelfe, and Lawes are iron chaynes for madde men: If the chaynes were broken, and the grate broken vp, we ſhould be as wilde beaſts in a forreſt. How many headie beaſts are there, craftie Foxes, ſubtle Serpents, that by monie, fauour, and all deuices ſeeke to wreſt, and cracke theſe chaynes? How many violent and moody beaſts, ruſhing againſt the ſides of the grate, making the houſe to ſhake in the parts, and ſometimes in the whole, euer waiting, watching, wiſhing, trying now and then to breake all open? This is the qualitie of euery wilde thing in hold. Surely if a man looke into the ſpirits of men, in their dealings and diſſemblings, hee ſhall not onely ſee a forreſt of beaſts and ſerpents, but an hell of wickedneſſe and miſeries. All is ſelfeloue and hatred: hence commeth ſuch feare and ſnatching; For otherwiſe men would not ſo much care in whoſe poſſeſſion the goods of the world were, ſeeing the reaſonable, wiſe, liberall, louing, and right diſpenſation thereof according to the law of nature, and of Chriſt. Thus it was for a little while, Acts 4. 34. 35. but that feſtiuall day laſted not long, nay rather it laſteth ſtill among the faithfull, to the worlds end. But that is another argument. Here wee ſpeake of the condition of the darke and euill world, and the imaginarie deceitfull good thereof without Chriſt.
               To conclude: Hee that looketh on the frailty of man, and all the creatures with him, the interchangeable courſe of all things and ſtates, and conſidereth the depth of cauſes, and reaſon of things, ſhall be forced to ſeeke for felicitie, durable reſt, or happy contentment, ſomewhere elſe than in the confuſed, diſordered, tranſitory World: For all is vanitie, nothing, to none end, like the actions of a foole, and talke of a man in his dreame. This ſecret God reuealeth to his ſecret ones: As for the men of the world, they will be wiſe, great, glorious, and doe great matters; they heare, they ſee, they liſten, they ſtudy, and ſtriue, imagining that by a further

and deeper reach they ſhall finde good: For they are wilde aſſes colts. As the Spartanes indigitating or deifying Alexander, at his command, contrary to their owne liking, wrote; Becauſe Alexander will be a god, let him be a god: So I write; Becauſe theſe will be wiſe, will be great, will be glorious, will be what they will be; then let them be ſo. But Alexander dyed like a man, in the flower of his age: euen ſo there is more hope of a foole, than of one of theſe wiſe (mad) ones. To conclude: As the ſoule of man working eſpecially by the organs of eye and eare, cannot finde perfect contentation in things and times abſent; neither euer ſhall it doe in time to come, for all things paſt, and to come are the ſame in their kindes, as the ſeaſons of the yeere are the ſame for euer: So that there is no poſſibility that the ſoule ſhould be ſatiſfied and filled with good in worldly things, through the miniſtery of the chiefeſt ſenſes, but rather with irkeſomneſſe, wearineſſe and loathſomneſſe.

                  The thing that hath beene, it is that which ſhall be, and that which is done, is that which ſhall be done; and there is no new thing vnder the Sunne.
               
               AN amplification of the Argument, or former Induction, figured by a Prolepſis, or preuention of an Obiection ſecretly framed in the fooliſh heart, which is a wild, roauing, groundleſſe imagination, or euill ſuggeſtion of a poſſibilitie to obtaine a durable felicitie, or happy reſt, in a full, firme and ſolid ſtate. It is mans ignorance and preſumption to ſtriue for that, which neuer any yet had, and to doe that which neuer was done before: Hee is all for nouelties and wonders. To be the onely one is euery mans deſire, and to this point doe all his ſoaring thoughts aſpire: Euery man will needs try his wit and ſtrength in finding out the means to this worldly bliſſe, that none euer yet felt himſelfe entirely to enioy: Such courſes hee deuiſeth to take, ſo farre to trauaile, ſuch curious inuentions to finde out, as neuer yet any did. Euery man in his kinde and wayes ſtriueth, as it were, to finde out the ſtone that ſhall turne iron into gold, till all

his wit and ſiluer be ſpent, and at the laſt hee bringeth forth winde: It was but the crackling of thornes vnder a pot. Parturiunt montes, exit ridiculus Mus. With theſe mountanous imaginations and windie thoughts Solomon here meeteth.
               
                  The thing that hath beene, is that which ſhall be, &amp;c. Both the things that haue beene, and the deedes that haue beene done, are euen the ſame that now are, and are done, and ſo ſhall be hereafter. And there is no new thing vnder the Sunne. An amplification by the contrary denyed, to take away doubting, and to inculcate the certaine truth thereof. 
                     Ʋnder the Sunne. That is, worldly or humaine things, or deeds. There is a circular reuolution of all things, counſels, deeds, euents, as well as of the ſpheres of heauen, windes and riuers. There is a riſing, falling, aſcending, deſcending, appearance, diſparence of all things. Let the profoundeſt ſpeculatiſt, or curious practitioner, turne the edge of his wit which way he will to finde out ſome new thing, the like whereof was neuer yet knowne, nor heard, yet ſure it is, the ſame things haue beene, and the ſame deedes were done of old, and they are nothing but the circular reuolutions of the former. The heart of man is the ſame that it hath beene of old, and produceth ſuch effects good or euill; it cannot alter it owne kinde, but is wheeled about in it owne ſphere. Some haue ſought for a felicity in the ſtudies of Wiſdome; ſome in riches and ſenſuall pleaſures; ſome in Honour, pompe and magnificence: but no man euer yet found contentment in his preſent eſtate, without mixture of griefe, griefe accompanying it, or ſorrow following him hard at heeles. Many haue thought, and thinke others happy, but none euer yet found himſelfe happy. Suos quiſque patimur manes. If none euer yet reaped profit of his endeauours and labours, neither then ſhall euer any doe it now, or hereafter. Euery man complayneth of the preſent ſtate of the world, and ſaith, it was neuer ſo bad, but it is not worſe, nor yet better then it hath beene, neither ſhall it be otherwiſe. The ſame complaints and diſcontent hath beene, and ſhall be, in all generations. If a man liue neuer ſo long, hee ſhall neither ſee nor heare other things then heretofore haue beene, neither is it in his

power to alter or mend any thing; for the world is nothing but an alteration of alterations in it ſelfe. A man hath no more command of it, than the Sea men hath of the windes. Some violent and hautie ſpirits haue ſtriuen forcibly for the full fruition of an earthly happineſſe, but hauing obtained their deſires, that ſeemed ſo beautifull a farre off▪ they found themſelues no whit the better, but rather worſe, yea, neareſt to miſerie, whereof they thought to rid themſelues for euer. Therefore it is better to ſit ſtill, than to riſe and fall; to liue in obſcuritie, than to be a publique ſpectacle of follie, as the moſt ſubtile and violent workers of old haue beene, and ſo ſhall they be ſtill. Euery man hath great hopes, as of old, neither can he be diſſwaded from this vanity, till old age bring him to ſee, by long experience, this reuolution of all things, and then beginnes he to diſpaire and to be weary. He is full of teaſtineſſe, anger, and impatience when he ſeeth nothing but vanitie, follie and madneſſe in men.
               It may be obiected. If there be ſuch a conſtant reuolution of all things, then there is a certaine knowledge of all things to be had, and a fore-knowledge of things to come, which a man may attaine to, and ſo obtaine contentation of minde in the ſpeculation of diuine wiſedome, in the frame and gouernement of the world, and in this ſort to be vnited vnto God by communication of his ſecret counſell, is a felicitie. I anſwere, the particular or indiuiduall things, and actions, with their proper circumſtances, are now, and neuer were before, nor ſhall be againe, but the things and actions in their kinde, and nature, and intent, are the ſame that were of old. They are the ſame in ſubſtance, but differenced by circumſtances, or indiuiduall properties, and ſo is generation from generation, Father from Sonne, Man from Man, Summer from Summer, Winter from Winter, Yeare from Yeare, Day from Day: For that figure, face, or rather countenance of the heauens which is to day, ſhall neuer be againe, or, the eſſence of all things in their kindes is the ſame, but their exiſtences, whereby a thing of the ſame kinde is this, and not that, are without number: And in this reſpect may a man ſay that there are infinite worlds.

Man cannot vtter it, nor conceiue it in minde, as was ſaid before.

                  Is there any thing, whereof it may be ſaid, See, this is new? It hath beene already of old time, which was before vs.
               
               A Confirmation of the anſwere. There was neuer yet any man that could ſay, this thing, or action in the ſubſtance, nature, kinde, or intent thereof is new. Such a thing was neuer thought, ſaid, nor done, plotted nor effected. This propoſition is figured by a communication, to ſignifie the certaine truth thereof. The argument is drawne from all the Specialls denyed to deny the Generall. The argument may be framed thus.
               
                  
                     Prop. If there neither be nor ſhall be any one thing new, which hath not beene of old, then all things that now are, and ſhall be, haue beene of old.
                  
                     Aſſum. But the antecedent, or former part is true:
                  
                     Concl. Therefore the Conſequent or latter part is true alſo.
               
               For if we ſhall recount from the creation till this preſent day, and conſider all the Saints, and Sinners, with their words and workes, the manner of their liuing, and behauiour in all things, both towards God and man, mentioned in the Scriptures, wee ſhall ſee none other things then wee now ſee, and ſhall ſee with our eyes, and heare with our eares. Though there be not the ſame degrees, meaſures, or extents, yet there is the ſame ſpirit, will, deſire, endeauour, conceit of minde, and actuall performance, Qua data porta ru
                        •
                     nt, as power is giuen, and way lyeth open, &amp;c. To exemplifie this that I haue ſaid. The old Saints and Martyrs are all departed this life, and their perſonall workes done on earth are ceaſed with them, and ſo it is to be ſaid of the wicked alſo: but the natures and kindes of both, with all their words and workes, are yet liuing, and liuelily acted now in the world, and ſhall be, as they were then. Chriſt is enuyed, perſecuted, tempted, mocked, crucified to the worlds end, not in his owne perſon, but in his Miniſters and other members. For, ſaith Chriſt, If they haue called the Maſter of the houſe

                  Belzebub, much more them of his houſhold? Againe; All theſe things will they doe vnto you for my names ſake: yet ſhall they not know ſo much. Moreouer, the ſame iudgements of God doe now fall on the wicked, but they acknowledge them not, nor apply them; Ier. 5. 3. becauſe they are brutiſh and fooliſh; Pſal. 92. 6. and alſo the ſame bleſſings and deliuerances on the godly, that did in old time, and the godly that are exerciſed and depend on the Word know it; Zach. 11. 11.
               All bleſſings and curſes were but caſualties, chances, lucks, naturall effects, and euents, to them that beleeued not, nor applied the Sermons of the Prophets; which cauſed Ieremie to complaine, Thou haſt ſtricken them, but they haue not grieued; thou haſt conſumed them, but they haue refuſed to receiue correction. They hardened their faces, and refuſed to returne. And why? becauſe they will not acknowledge ſuch things to come of the Lord for ſinne; but they, and we ſticke in the ſecond cauſes, we cannot goe beyond the cloudes, windes, ſtarres, &amp;c. therefore neither are we thankfull to him for his benefits. And if we Miniſters were gifted with ſpeciall reuelations as the Prophets were, who would beleeue vs more now than they did then the Prophets? And though our prophecies were fulfilled in their eyes, yet would they not ſo apply them. The ſame things come to paſſe now that did then, though they be not now fore-told in ſuch ſort; and ſhould haue done ſo than, though they had not beene foretold, (for both the nonage and rudeneſſe of the Iewes required ſuch ſpeciall reuelations) and the people with all their ſayings and doings are now that were then. Thankefull obedience procureth the ſame bleſſings; contempt and rebellion bring the ſame puniſhments and corrections, though they bee not propheſied: For wee neede no new propheſies nor miracles, ſeeing that the old are ſufficient, (vnleſſe God ſhould ſend a new Goſpell.) We are the ſame people, and ſuch are our words, workes, and behauiours; and ſo is God the ſame God, not partiall, not vnequall: Wherefore if the old preuaile not, neither will the new. If we want wiſedome and grace to applie the old, wee would acknowledge

the new, no otherwiſe than the Iewes the old people did; Ier. 5. 3. Well, propheſies by ſpeciall reuelation &amp; miracles are ceaſed, but all things propheſied or taught by the Prophets, and the efficacy of miracles▪ are ſtill the ſame. The Scriptures ſet forth the ſtate of the World for the ſubſtance, nature, and condition thereof, to the Worlds end, and endureth throughout all generations, which are the ſame, and ſo is it the ſame, and to be preached to all generations. There is no man, good, or bad, no thought, word, or worke, but there may hee ſee himſelfe, his workes, and thoughts of his heart plainely depeinted forth. It is accompliſhed, and fulfilled in euery generation; but the eyes of the wicked are holden. Therefore if there were new propheſies, new miracles, yea, a new Bible, it ſhould be but the ſame, that which now is, in the nature, kinde, ſubſtance, and ſcope thereof, differing onely in reſpect of circumſtances. To conclude. All things whatſoeuer a man can particularize, are the ſame, that haue beene; the ſame I ſay, Specie, in kind or nature, not numero, the very ſelfe-ſame without indiuiduall or circumſtantiall difference.
               Here then is wiſedome to diſcerne the times and ſeaſons, and to apply after-things rightly to the former, or rather to behold things paſt in thoſe that are preſent; but that is hidden from moſt mens eyes, and it is giuen to few to behold that which they heare, and reade of, though it be neuer ſo plainely acted before their eyes; yea, and he is euen now acting it himſelfe. There i

                   nothing in the written Word, but it extendeth in ſome ſort to euery man, though man be a foole, and a beaſt, and will haue nothing to concerne him, but what he luſteth. So are we blinded with Sathan, and bewitched with our brutiſh luſts, that in hearing we vnderſtand not, and in ſeeing perceiue not. A iuſt iudgement of God on the wicked, which hate the truth, and embrace lies. How many profeſſing the name of Chriſt, beleeuing in God, children of Abraham, (as they ſay, and imagine) are indeed the very Princes, Prieſts, Phariſes, and commons of the Iewes, that heard, ſaw, toucht, talkt much of Chriſt, and with Chriſt, but yet heard him not, ſaw him not? &amp;c. They look
                     •
                  
                  
for Elias to come, but he was already come, and they did vnto him whatſoeuer they would. He was already come, not in his owne perſon, but in ſpirit, and power. The Iewes that were garniſhing the Sepulchers of the Prophets, whom their Fathers murdered, would haue murdered the ſame Prophets if they had beene than liuing, and preached as in the dayes of their Fathers; and they did indeede murther them all in the great Prophet, the Son of God; Math. 23. Therefore ſaith Salomon, The wiſe mans eyes are in his head, but the foole perceiueth nothing of all that is before him. Therefore they that are now liuing, with their words, and workes, are the ſame that were of old. Happy, yea, thrice happy, are the eyes that can ſee this, and the heart that can vnderſtand it: but that is not giuen to all. The obſtinate being conuicted of a deede condemned of old, may ſay, it is a wrong indeede, it is vniuſt, I muſt confeſſe, &amp;c. but it muſt be ſo, it cannot be remedied, &amp;c. Againe, they that doe ſuch and ſuch things, haue good reaſons for it, &amp;c. I anſwer, it muſt be ſo indeede, and ſuch reaſons muſt goe currant, and preuaile: ſor offences muſt be as they haue beene of old; but woe be to him by whom the offence commeth, as it was ſaide of olde. And they had alſo as good reaſons in former times for their muſts, as wee haue now for our muſts, and euen the ſame. Woe be to them that ſay, we muſt doe thus, and this, or elſe, &amp;c. I muſt doe this, or that; or elſe I cannot liue, &amp;c. So the Princes, Prieſts, Phariſes, Commons, muſt crucifie Chriſt, for their owne ſecurity, and preſeruation of the Temple, City, and worſhip of God, (here are good reaſons.) So Iudas muſt betray his Maſter, becauſe he muſt haue money. Pilate muſt be partiall, and doe iniuſtice for fauour, or feare of the Iewes, though he knew the innocent and iuſt to be perſecuted of enuie, and ſhould haue giuen iudgement rather againſt his falſe accuſers, and aided, and protected him with his power, and garriſon of Souldiers, countenanced him and his doctrine, and all that fauoured him; and contrarily diſgraced, and weakened euery aduerſary: he ſhould haue obeyed the ſubmonitions of his owne conſcience; but that the wicked muſt not do, becauſe they haue reaſons to the contrary.

The Iſraelites muſt follow the wayes of Ieroboam, contrary to the voices of all the Prophets, and ſo muſt an infinite number now adayes be croſſe, and hatefull to all their teachers, contrary to the ſubmonition of their conſciences, becauſe they haue reaſons which many are aſhamed to vtter. The Iewes muſt be Church-robbers, purloyning, and alienating tithes, becauſe they had good reaſons for it, ſuch as we haue for our Church-robberies: But he that muſt ſteale, muſt be hanged, notwithſtanding his good reaſons; ſo the wicked muſt doe wickedly, becauſe he cannot liue elſe, or not liue ſo, or ſo well as he deſires, becauſe he muſt be damned. Hell fire muſt burne, therefore it muſt haue fuell.

               AN explication of the confirmation, figured alſo by a Prolepſis. Ob. But there are now many things, the like whereof wee neuer heard before: And wee reade of many things, that haue beene ſaid, and done, that now are not, neither are likely to be hereafter. Anſ. That is but our ignorance. For time conſumeth all things: Euery particular thing periſheth, and euery deede vaniſheth, but yet in ſuch ſort as I ſaid before. Therefore when an olde thing is renued, or clothed with other circumſtances, we obſerue it not, we perceiue it not, no not when we are euen doing and ſaying that which wee know to haue beene done and ſaid of olde, no more then Iudas knew himſelfe to be Achitophel, and Dauid vtterly condemned himſelfe in another; 2 Sam. 12. 5. The Pope knoweth not himſelfe to be Caiphas, nor the Ieſuites that they are Phariſes. The Phariſes knew not themſelues to be the very ſame with their Fathers, to ſpeake and doe euen the ſame things; neither knew they Chriſt to be Zacharie, or Elias, hauing the ſame, yea, a greater ſpirit, and power; Mathew 23. 29. 30. See their madneſſe. They condemned their Fathers, and iuſtified themſelues, becauſe they built the Tombes of the Prophets, and garniſhed the Sepulchers of

the righteous, and ſay, if they had beene in the dayes of their Fathers, they would not haue beene partakers with them in the bloud of the Prophets. True iwis, if Moſes had beene there, they would haue ſhewed themſelues tender-hearted Wolues. For Iohn 9. 28. They were Moſes Diſciples, not Chriſts; and yet is Moſes fulfilled in him, and Moſes commanded them to heare him. Abraham reioyced in ſpirit to ſee his day▪ 
                  Iohn 8. 56. and they boaſt themſelues to be his children, 
                     Ʋerſe 39. But if Abraham ſhould haue beene raiſed from the dead, (as was Lazarius, or as Diues would haue had one riſen from the dead to warne his brethren) to haue accompanied Chriſt in preaching &amp; teaching theſe his children; they would haue done the ſame to their Father Abraham, and to Moſes, that they did to him. They would haue crucified both Abraham, Moſes, and Elias with him, as the Pope would doe Peter now. They boaſt that God is their Father, verſe 41. but God was now among them, not in maieſty and terrour, as he appeared in Mount Sinai to their Fathers at the giuing of the Law, but incarnate, appearing in their owne nature, humble and meeke, teaching them all things in mildeſt manner, with ſufficient teſtimony of his God-head: yea, euidently ſhewing forth the maieſty and power of his God-head, whereof themſelues were conuicted. What blinded them thus? what deceiued them? what bewitched them? Euen their luſts. They were full of pride, couetouſneſſe, enuy; in a word, carnally minded, hauing a ſhew of religion and deuotion, in doing the outward letter of the Law, and ſtrictly obſeruing their owne ceremonies and traditions, thereby deluding the people, and themſelues alſo; but what the ſpirituall intendment of the Scriptures was, they were altogether ignorant. Faith in Chriſt their Redeemer, and the deniall of themſelues, the world, the fleſh, and the deuill, was farre from them. They could not goe before an earthly felicity, a fleſhly happineſſe, therefore they looked for a worldly redeemer of their ſtates from vnder the power of the Romanes, &amp;c. Their deuotion was but a maske of worldly craftineſſe, policie, and deuilliſhneſſe, to blinde the people with, and themſelues

alſo. The people groaned vnder their burden, and in hope of liberty thronged in ſuch multitudes after Chriſt; but when ſuch fleſhly hopes failed, Iudas betrayed him, and they cryed, Crucifie him, away with him, (hee is not for our profit) to pleaſe their deuout tyrants againe, whom they had diſpleaſed in following him. Behold the condition of theſe brutiſh hypocrites. They follow and flatter the Preacher of the Goſpell. Ioh. 6. 25▪ 26. 27. Not beleeuing and humbling themſelues, as Mary did, but like rebellious belly-gods, Papiſts, to ſet vp a Pope againſt their King. For when they found him to be a ſpirituall King, Shepheard, Redeemer, they perſecuted him with deadly hatred, and had rather be vnder any tyrant, than vnder his ſpirituall regiment. The Goſpell is the moſt grieuous burthen that can be borne, and the Preacher thereof the greateſt tormenter. Ah, that Papiſts, common-Proteſtants, Libertines could lay theſe things to heart! How many ſtand vp at Creed, but fight againſt the Goſpell! How many receiue the ſigne of the Croſſe in their foreheads, but fight vnder the deuils banner! How many make a vowe to God in Baptiſme, but caſt the payment thereof vpon their ſureties, like brutiſh ding▪ thrifts, running out like Cham, and Cain, and deuils, foorth of Chriſts preſence, which in ſpirit cry out againſt their teacher, What haue we to doe with thee, art thou come to torment vs before the time?
               
               To conclude. All that is, and ſhall be done, hath beene done of old, but wee know not ſo much. Shortneſſe of life is a great cauſe thereof: For few men liue ſo long to ſee the reuolution or circular courſe of many things. And ſome things and ſtates are of longer continuance than others. Moreouer, this kinde of obſeruation, moſt profitable to man is neglected of moſt▪ but the wiſe obſeruer can fore-tell many things to come, or neerely ayme at them. Furthermore, the remembrance of things paſt dyeth with the preſent generation, &amp; a wonder laſteth but nine dayes, and but a few memorable things are deriued to the next, which alſo vaniſh more and more out of their mindes, and at length remaine with very few, vaniſhing as a ſound or loud noyſe

by little and little, and as a bird of the ayre vaniſheth out of ſight. In like ſort, all things, now ſaid, and done in this preſent generation of the world, ſhall in future ages be forgotten, and the like alſo may be ſaid of all things in ages to come, in reſpect of ages following them. To conclude: Seeing that man, and all things with him are ſo vnſtable, and changeable, there can no good remaine to man of all his labours, no contentation of minde, no quietneſſe of conſcience. He muſt ſeeke that elſe-where: For his foundation here, ſhall be but laid on the ſands, and his buildings ſhall be but the Tower of Babel, and fall downe like the Tower of Siloam, on the head of the builder. Therefore all is vanity.
               If any man thinke that this following is the more naturall analyſis of this former part of the Chapter, I eaſily yeeld to it. The firſt verſe containeth the inſcription of the booke. The ſecond verſe containeth the Theme or generall propoſition. The third verſe containeth the principall argument, which is confirmed by two reaſons in this chapter. The firſt is drawne from the inſtabilitie of man dying, verſe 4. illuſtrated firſt by a compariſon of the earth ſtanding and remaining, verſe 4. end. Secondly, by a compariſon of the Sun, Windes, Riuers, riſing, falling, and returning backe againe, which man doth not, verſe 5. 6. 7. To which purpoſe Catullus.the Poet ſaith.

                  And iſſue forth againe out of the deepe:
                  When our ſwiftſtarre of life is vaniſhed,
                  It nere returnes, in death we euer ſleepe.
               
               
                  And to the ſame purpoſe Iob ſaith, There is hope of a tree, if it be cut downe, that it will ſprout againe, and that the tender branch thereof will not ceaſe, though the root thereof waxe olde in the earth, and the ſtocke thereof dye in the ground, yet through the ſent of waters it will budde, &amp;c. But man dyeth and waſteth away, yea, man giueth vp the ghoſt, and where is hee? Iob 14. 7. 8. 9. 10.
                  
                  The windes alſo are rowled in their circuits, and the riuers keepe their conſtant reuolution, they returne backe againe.
               
               The ſecond reaſon is drawne from the inſtability of all creatures, ſtates, and humaine affaires, illuſtrated by a compariſe of the leſſe, which is figured by a gradation, verſe 8. amplified by a prolepſis, verſe 9. confirmed, verſe 10.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 12. 
                  I the Preacher, was King ouer Iſrael, in Ieruſalem.
               
               HEere beginneth the latter part of the Chapter, wherein Solomon ſheweth that he found not onely by obſeruation, but alſo by experience in the ſtudies of wiſedome, that all things are but vanity and vexation of ſpirit, both the things themſelues, and mans wiſedome and knowledge of the things alſo. All things are inſtable, fraile, and full of corruption, no ſure thing can be built vpon them, no felicity can proceede out of vanity, no perfection out of imperfection. For the curſe is on man▪ and on all things with man, therefore there muſt needs ſuch like effects proceede from them. For a cleane thing cannot come out of filthineſſe, Iob 14. 4.
               His purpoſe is to ſhew that hee made ſearch in the beſt things, wherein there was appearance of any good, which man moſt deſired and admired. And firſt he beganne with wiſedome, which of all other things being meerely tranſitory, is the flower. For as for other things they are not ſo preeminent, becauſe fooles, and beaſts may be partakers thereof as well as the wiſe, to wit, riches, honours, friends, pleaſures, beauty, ſtrength; but wiſedome is proper to the wiſe onely, by which a man is a man, and commeth neereſt to the diuine nature: Therefore true happines was likelyeſt to be found in wiſedome.
               The argument whereby he confirmeth the vnprofitableneſſe of humaine wiſedome, and things ſeeming good, is drawne from the teſtimonie of his experimentall knowledge of things ſubiect to knowledge and ſcience, in the reſt of this chapter, and of things ſubiect to mans bodily vſe, chap. 2. The things ſubiect to knowledge are eyther naturall with

their cauſes, properties, effects, or elſe morall, both good and euill, both wiſedome, madneſſe, and follie. The teſtimonie of experimentall knowledge hee declareth and proueth to be firme and good by two arguments. The firſt is drawne from the perſon ſearching out the knowledge of things by obſeruation and experience, verſe 12. Secondly, from his diligent trauaile therein. Of this trauaile, Firſt, hee propoundeth his counſell, verſe 13. Secondly, he declareth the effect thereof. Thirdly, he expoundeth both his reuiew; and determination or iudgement thereof, verſe 14 His determination he confirmes by a reaſon, verſe 15. All is figured by a prolepſis, verſe 16. 17. and concluded, verſe 17. which is confirmed, verſe 18.
               The firſt argument confirming the certaintie of his experimentall knowledge, is drawne from the condition of his perſon, (King) and therefore of fartheſt extent, and reach, of de
                     •
                  peſt apprehenſion, and largeſt comprehenſion, as he that on an high hill ſeeth fartheſt, and comprehendeth moſt. Men of priuate ſtate are but of priuate, ſtraight, and and particular wits, experienced, and exerciſed in few and inferiour things, and alſo diſturbed many waies. But a King is as the Sunne, comprehending all things, ſuperiour, and inferiour within the compaſſe of his ſight, and is eleuated▪ as I may ſay, aboue the troubled regions of the Aire, (all things being placed vnder him) and free from all obſtacles in a firmely eſtabliſhed and peaceable common-wealth, as this of Iſrael now was: In a word, hee is Gods vice-gerent, the neereſt attendant to him, of his priuie counſell, euer in preſence and ſight, on whoſe hand, as I may ſay, the great King leaneth. Dauid was a man of warre, but God gaue Solomon peace with all nations, and all nations were ſeruiceable to him: Wherefore? The more freely to liue in eaſe, and fleſhly pleaſure? To doe as brethren doe oft times falling at variance among themſelues for want of an outward aduerſarie, againſt whom they may ioyne in vnitie of contention? Or that the members of the body ſhould deuoure and conſume one another for want of matter to worke vpon from the ſtomacke? No ſuch thing: For that is bruitiſh

and ethnicall: But he gaue him peace that hee might build him an houſe, a glorious houſe. Hee gaue him wiſedome with peace, to gouerne his people prudently, and to teach them the feare of the Lord, to ſtabliſh the whole worſhip of God in perfection, according to the Law. To glorifie the Lord in erecting his houſe, and ſtabliſhing his worſhip, that the beauty of both might be an aſtoniſhment to the nations, that the God of Iſrael might be glorified in all the earth.
               To conclude, his Kingly office is amplied by the ſubiect, or obiect (Iſrael) the people of God, and therefore the moſt excellent, and glorious King. Laſtly, by the place, (in Ieruſalem) Ieruſalem the citie of God, the beauty of holineſſe, the paradiſe of the world renewed, the ioy of the whole earth. Now being a King, hee wanted no meanes to attaine to knowledge, neither authority to enquire and demaund the opinions, and iudgements of others, nor ability to get and vſe all meanes requiſite for exquiſite knowledge.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 13. 
                  And I gaue my heart to ſeeke and ſearch out by wiſedome, concerning all things that are done vnder heauen: this ſore trauaile hath God giuen to the ſonnes of men, to be exerciſed therewith.
               
               THe ſecond Argument, confirming the certainty of his experience drawne from his diligent trauaile and accurate endeauour. As hee wanted not power and ability to procure and vſe all meanes; ſo neither wanted hee deſire and diligence: For hee gaue himſelfe wholly, not onely to ſeeke by wiſedome to know things, but to ſearch out by obſeruation and tryall, according to wiſedome, the cauſes, properties, and effects, and the reaſon of all things that are, and are done vnder heauen. But this hee did not in pride and curioſitie, but in modeſty, accordingly as he found himſelfe gifted of God, 1 King. 4. 33. For God is the father of lights, the gifts of his ſpirit are lights ſhining in darkeneſſe. Wiſedome is with God, and proceedeth out from the throne of God, which whoſoeuer wan
                     •
                  eth can neuer attaine to the true knowledge of him, becauſe his worldly heart is full of darkneſſe.

For God hath ſubdued all things vnder vanity, which the blinde world knoweth not, or but dreamingly noteth, (which maketh fleſh and bloud ſo proud) from which no man can rid himſelfe, ſtriue hee neuer ſo much, but rather doth ſtill, as the proud curious heritickes did, encreaſe vanity, errour, and folly, as the hydropical body by thirſting and ſtriuing to quench thirſt by drinking, doth increaſe the diſcaſe, and in the end deſtroy it ſelfe. The heathen kept neither meane nor meaſure in the curious and ambitious ſearch of the wiſedome of God in the world, and his ſecret counſell in the vſe of his creatures: But for as much as the end of their endleſſe labours was not the glory of God, euen ſubiection to him in feare and thankefull obedience, but their owne vaine-glory, praiſe, pleaſure, fooliſhneſſe, impietie, they found not that which they ſought for: For a foole, ſaith Solomon ſeeketh wiſedome and findeth it not, but wearieth himſelfe in a Labyrinth; and ſo became vaine in their worldly imaginations. Wherefore becauſe they ſought to know God out of his Church, and to aſſume the glory thereof to themſelues by returning their owne eyes, and the eyes of men after them, to exalt and magnifie them; as hee that ſeeketh praiſe by the curious deſcription of a cunning worke, but forgetteth, yea deſpiſeth the workeman himſelfe, and becauſe they thought and ſought to comprehend the infinite maieſtie and wiſedome of God, in the creation and gouernment, by humane capacitie, and trauaile, without the Spirit and Word of God, therefore were they blinded, like the Sodomites ſeeking Lots doore, groping all their life after that which they could neuer finde, attaining onely to ſo much as ſerued to quicken the worme of their dead conſciences to make them inexcuſable.
               Furthermore, as God hath by a generall decree in the beginning laid ſore trauell on man to humble his pride thereby, in ſo much that nothing can be gotten without great labour ſince the fall; ſo neither can he attaine to the knowledge of wiſedome without diligence: For the gift is indeed freely giuen of God, but we muſt receiue it by the appointed meanes. Therefore although hee granted the requeſt of

                  Solomon, in giuing a wiſe and vnderſtanding heart aboue all that were before him, or after him, yet he applyed himſelfe to the ſtudy and contemplation of all things, and to finde out the ſecrets of Gods wiſedome by carefull obſeruation, and experience. So that in the ſtudies of knowledge, there is great affliction both of body and minde: Firſt, becauſe ſome neuer attaine to true wiſedome, but fall into vaine imaginations, and manifold errours, and ſo when they thinke to be wiſe, they become fooles. The iuſt iudgement of God on their proud preſumption, Rom. 1. 22. Of thoſe kinds of ſtudies theſe wordes of Solomon may be vnderſtood, This ſore trauaile hath God giuen, &amp;c. Secondly, they that are mooued, and directed by the ſpirit of God to the right end, and ſo attaine to wiſedome, are greatly humbled with infinite toyle as well as the husbandman; and in the end ſee nothing but vanity, euen matter of griefe, both in the things that are knowne, and in the knowledge it ſelfe. For they are ſtill as farre from contentation and peace of conſcience, as euer they were. For no worldly thing can make a man happy. So that although a man had all knowledge, without Chriſt it is nothing; Paul eſteemed it but loſſe and dung, Phil. 3. Of this wiſedome, I rather thinke the words to be vnderſtood.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 14. 
                  I haue ſeene all the workes that are done vnder the Sunne, and behold, all is vanity, and vexation of ſpirit.
               
               IN the former verſe he propounded his counſell, in the applying of himſelfe to get knowledge and experience, not of ſome things, but of all things. Here he declareth the ſucceſſe or effect thereof. I haue ſeene all the workes, &amp;c. I haue indeede by the gift of God obtained that vnderſtanding which I ſought for: For I haue ſeene it with mine eyes, I haue read it in the Booke of Nature, the holy Spirit of wiſedome inſtructing, and directing me. God hath giuen me a right and true diſcerning of all that I haue ſeene, and diſcourſed on, by ſanctified reaſon. Euery man heareth and ſeeth as well as Solomon, but no man rightly diſcerneth ought,

but by the reuelation of the Spirit. For a man is a beaſt by his owne knowledge, a foole, darkely led, deceiued by Satan, and ſuch like are his obſeruations. If a man looke on the faireſt letters, and cannot reade, what is he the better? Solomon attained not to this height of wiſedome by reading of the naturall and morall Treatiſes of the Aegyptians, Chaldeans, Aſſyrians, Gimnoſophiſts, diſcourſing by imagination vpon other mens workes, and culling ſentences out of them, to make a ſhew of that which was not in him; wherein indeede many excellent things are buried, as in darke and confuſed Mines, (yet but wilde fruit, proceeding from the wilde Oliue) out of which notwithſtanding a diuine and ſanctified ſpirit can extract good matter, and conuert it into the right nature and vſe thereof, as it may be Solomon did, ſome may thinke; but the Kings of Iſrael were to be exerciſed in the Booke of the Law onely, not in Ethnicall vanities, which commonly we call learning. What their wiſedome was, the Prouerbes, the Canticles, the Sonne of Sirach, the Booke of Wiſedome, make manifeſt, which differ much from ethnicall morall Treatiſes, which are the wilde fruits of wilde trees, and wilde ones are moſt addicted to them; ſuch lippes, ſuch lettuce. But Solomon ſaw with his eyes, and rightly conceiued in minde what hee ſaw, by the ſpeciall illumination of the Spirit of God, which gaue ſuch a plentifull bleſſing to his holy endeauours, that he became famous for his wiſedome among all the wiſe men, and Kings of the earth; who were deſirous to heare of the wiſedome which God put in his heart; 1 King. 10. 24. So that euen his ſeruants were counted happy, that attended on him, and heard his wiſedome.
               Here wee note that there is twofold learning or knowledge in a man; the one is obtained by reading of mens bookes, the other by reading in the Bookes of God. The former kinde of wiſedome is imitation, which we commonly call learning: It is gotten by imagination and ſtrength of memory: It is a talkatiue learning, which a man relateth from the mouth of another, not from an vnderſtanding heart. A parable is harſh in a fooles mouth, and ſo is learning. He

hath not, as our Sauiour ſaith, Radicem vel ſemen in ſ
                        •
                     ipſo, Roote, or ſeede in himſelfe, hewants the ſeede or principles of that whereof he talketh in himſelfe. It is therefore but ſpeculatiue and childiſh, and as it were an artificiall or painted complexion, whereof a man boaſteth, vainely puſt vp in his ignorant minde. Hi volunt ſe primos omnium rerum eſſe, nec ſunt: but the other is modeſt and humble. For it is gotten by reading in the Bookes of God. Yet a
                     •
                   the Booke of the Word being ſealed vp, or claſped, affoordeth no knowledge; Eſay 29. 11. no more doe the creatures, when our eyes are held. The creatures ſound out the maieſty, power, wiſedome, iuſtice, goodneſſe, mercy, glory of God; as alſo the corruption, folly, ſhame, vanity, and miſery of man. For in them he may ſee his nakedneſſe, his curſe. But the foole perceiueth nothing of all that is before him: Hee neither beholdeth the glory of God in them with praiſe and feare, nor his owne nakedneſſe, and brutiſhneſſe with ſhame. If God open our eyes and eares, yea, giue life vnto ou
                     •
                   dead ſenſes, vnfolding this booke vnto vs; then ſhall we be able to reade in this booke, the Spirit ſhall bring all things to our remembrance, (we heare and ſee confuſedly in a ſlumber, and vnperfectly, as children) and ſhall gine vs ripe vnderſtanding in all things, both to behold the reuerend and glorious wiſedome of God in his workmanſhip, as Dauid ſaith; I am fearefully and wonderfully made, and his ſecret counſell, with his goodneſſe in the vſe of thoſe his veſſels, and the effect, and vſe of that vanity that is in them.
               In one generation may a man obſerue, and know euen by ſight, all things whatſoeuer haue beene taught by word or writing, diuine or humane, ſince the beginning of the world, foraſmuch as all things are the ſame in their circular courſes. But if a man be not guided by the Spirit, his obſeruations are but ſuperſtitious, and falſe rules, his readings erroneous, yea, though he hath read all Bookes, and hath not roote or ſeede in himſelfe, he is but in a maze toſſed too and fro, hearing and ſeeing as in a dreame: In a word, he wants wiſedome, he hath no learning. Wherefore men muſt not preſume aboue their gift, nor runne before they be called; but

worke according to their talent.
               
                  And behold, all is vanity, and vexation of ſpirit. After that he had trauelled for knowledge, and obtained knowledge; now thirdly he taketh a reuiew, or reflection in his minde thereof, to conſider what benefit or fruit redounded, or might redound to him thereby, and with all preſently determineth the caſe moſt plaine and euident. And] when I had ſought, and ſearched, and knowne what I could; Behold] marke, conſider, and remember what I ſay, All is vanity] both knowledge, and things knowne, euery thing was empty of good, full of euill, I had nothing but labour for trauell. After that Solomon had knowne all things, not by their ſhadowes and pictures, namely, by reading bookes, and relation of voice; but ſeene with his owne eyes, and things ſeene moſt affect and pleaſe: yet he found no profit of this his labour, no contentation, no happy reſt. Why? Becauſe all was but vanity and vexation of ſpirit, or the feeding of the ſoule with winde. The Hebrew word ſignifieth either in differently; He got nothing but labour for his trauaile, and griefe for his care. Contrarily, he that drinketh the waters of life, his thirſt ſhall be quenched; Iohn 4. and he that eateth the bread of life, his hunger ſhall be ſatisfied; Iohn 6. There is the true and euerlaſting foode of the ſoule, which onely giueth contentation, that fooliſh man ſo greedily elſe-where ſeeketh for, but neuer findeth.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 15. 
                  That which is crooked, cannot be made ſtraight: and that which is wanting, cannot be numbred.
               
               A Reaſon why hee found no contentation, no profit by the diligent ſearch of wiſedome, drawne from the ſubiect or obiect thereof, the things themſelues, which were not in mans power, and prouidence, nor reformable by his wiſedome, but in the hand of God; Chap. 3. 11. and Chap. 7. 13. For in all the parts of the World, in all liuing creatures, chiefly in man, and ciuill ſtates, there is nothing but corruption, enmity, vanity, miſery. The creatures, and man himſelfe, the ſucceſſe and euent of things and buſineſſes, are

crooked, peruerſe, confuſed. If a man labour to build vp ſome ſure worke vpon the creatures, it is a vaine trauaile, and brings forth vexation. For they are fraile, weake, imperfect; they decay, alter, periſh, and are ſubiect to innumerable infirmities and caſualties, which crookedneſſe no man can remedy. To ſpeake more fundamentally, euery thing in nature is peruerſe, and diſordered, one thing is diſtracted from another, the vnity of the whole engine is diſſolued, the vniforme ſubordination diſioynted by ſedition, all things tranſuerſe and peruerſe, euery thing enuiouſly eying, and deſtroying another, through the poyſon of enmity that is in them, as if the parts of the body ſhould fall at oddes, euery thing following a corrupt inclination and inordinate affection of it owne; neither can they be brought into the right frame of ſubordinate vnity, of m
                     •
                  tuall duty, and loue one to another, and all to man, or man to man, and man to God, by any power or wiſedome of man. The creatures in their kindes are all ſelfe-loue, pride, cruelty, pernicious, and dangerfull one to another, and all to man, and man to man. They are miſerable in themſelues, and adde miſery one to another through enmity and miſchiefe. Some reconciliation I grant, is made among ſome of the creatures one with another, and with man, by the wiſedome and labour of man, taming and teaching them, and ſo alſo is there ſome reconciliation of men among themſelues in a politicke gouernement▪ but the beſt vnity, and vniformity, is imperfect, weake, crooked, full of corruption, vanity, and miſery. No felicity can be built thereon, no contentation can be found therein.
               To proceede, as all things are thus crooked in their kinds, ſo is man more crooked then the reſt. His minde is depraued, full of blindneſſe; his paſſions or affections are inordinate; his body is ſubiect to innumerable diſeaſes. It is the corrupt veſſell or inſtrument of a more corrupt ſoule: Yea, mans crookedneſſe is an vnion or mixture of the crookedneſſes of all the creatures. This crookedneſſe can hee neuer make ſtraight by all his wiſedome, which is crooked it ſelfe. All humane ſcience cannot giue one ſparke of true light, nor rid the ſoule from one drop of poiſon, wherewith it is infected▪
                  
The bloud of Chriſt onely muſt purge it. The wiſeſt Philoſophers, Naturaliſts, and Moraliſts, when they had done all they could, yet their crookedneſſe remained in them. The ciuileſt and beſt theefe is but a theefe: What was Alexander but a theefe? And the ciuileſt and faireſt conditioned whore is but a whore: The whore Flora, deifyed by the Romanes, and honoured with feſtiuall dayes, was but a beaſtlie ſade. What elſe can the truth make of theſe two perſons? Such like indeede differ much from the rude, vnmannerly, and ſauage people, yet are they beaſts as well as they. The fleſh of Iezabell was but dogges meat, and the bloud, the royall bloud of Ahab, dogges drinke. No better was the corps of Iehoiakim, Ie

               Moreouer, from this crookedneſſe of the creatures, and of man, proceede many croſſes, vnluckineſſe, innumerable dangers, many misfortunes and caſualties in euery beſt courſe that the wiſeſt can take, and ſo is all his labour loſt, there remaineth no fruit to him, but griefe and vexation. Therefore in the beſt compoſed ſtate of things there is naught but deformitie, imperfection, weakeneſſe, want of vigour and ſtrength, diſeaſes, infirmities, ſickneſſes, ſtrange caſualties, ſuddaine misfortunes, vntimely deaths, which all creatures, with man, are ſubiect vnto. Againe, the beſt ordered ſtate, or common-wealth is full of wants, full of ſuperfluities and running into extremities on both hands, full of cruelties, of oppreſſions, and partiall dealings, and that of fauour, enuie, reuenge▪ Vnworthy perſons are preferred and honoured, the beſt-deſeruing are deiected, vice is graced and inri

In principall matters there is negligence, careleſſeneſſe, remiſſeneſſe: In trifles there is much curioſity and contentions; Iudgement is deferred, lawes are diſtorted, and ſuch like things, without number, which it is as hard for any Prince by wiſedome and power to reforme, as to regenerate or reſtore whole nature againe vnto her firſt integrity. If we conſider the ſtate and condition of the creatures themſelues, and one towards another, the defectiueneſſe, crookedneſſe, croſſeneſſe of all things, with their euents and

caſualties, wee ſhall finde it to be vnpoſſible to lay any ground-worke thereon, whereupon to erect an happie eſtate.
               To conclude: Seeeing that a wiſe man in the aboundance of knowledge ſeeth nothing but peruerſeneſſe and weakeneſſe, the one whereof cannot be reformed, the other not helped, neither of them remedyed, hee reapeth no ioy, no comfort by ſuch ſights, but anger, diſquietneſſe, griefe, and hath ſatisfied his deſire, and expectation of happy reſt no more then he that eateth and drinketh winde to ſatisfie the bodies appetite, when the one is fatted, the other ſhall be contented.

                  I communed with mine owne heart, ſaying, Loe, I am come to a great eſtate, and haue gotten more wiſedome then all they that haue beene before me in Ieruſalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wiſedome and knowledge.
               
               AN amplification of the confirmation handled, Verſe 12. 13. 14. 15. by a compariſon of all Kings that raigned before him in Ieruſalem, figured by a Prolepſis, thus: Thou maiſt haplie be deceiued in this matter, through partiall conceit of extraordinary wiſedome, and therefore hauing but an ouerly conſideration of things, and being blinded with the vaile of the common imperfections of things, and follies of vulgar people, and diſtempered Princes, haſt not rightly beheld to what happie ſtate, and contentation a man may attaine in this life by the right and perfect vnderſtanding of things and by the prouident and prudent carriage of himſelfe in all things, &amp;c. Anſ. Neither the dulneſſe of apprehenſion, nor the weakeneſſe of iudgement, nor want of diligence haue beene any let to me in this ſearch. For I haue not attempted this of pride, nor ſpoken it of arrogance, as puft vp with a vaine imagination of wiſedome, but I haue vnpartially communed with mine owne heart, and haue found that as God hath giuen mee riches and power; ſo alſo hath he giuen me wiſedome and knowledge of all ſecrets, aboue all the Kings that raigned before mee in this treaſurie of wiſedome, Ieruſalem, the City of the great King: Neither

doe I deceiue my ſelfe with the ouerly diſcourſe of manifold imaginations, and groundleſſe concluſions, but my heart hath ſeene great wiſedome and knowledge, I haue fundamentally obſerued and had the ocular experience of things, their natures, cauſes, properties, effects, vſes, &amp;c.

                  And I gaue my heart to know wiſedome, and to know madneſſe, and folly: I perceiued that this alſo is vexation of Spirit.
               
               A Continuation of the ſame anſwere. As I perceiued in my heart that I had receiued of God a greater meaſure of diſcerning, and ſenſible inſight aboue others, ſo according to my vttermoſt ability, I diligently exerciſed my ſelfe in ſearching out, yea following the euen tract and way of wiſedome in her workes, ſo farre forth as man is able to apprehend, and comprehend her. Conſequently by the rule of wiſedome I examined the wiſedomes, doctrines, and inſtructions of men, euen the manifold,

                  iw, determination or iudgement, Verſ. 14. To conclude, as I by wiſedome ſought out the knowledge of naturall things, and found that all was nothing but vanity and vexation of ſpirit: ſo haue I more then that ſought out, examined, and tryed the vnderſtanding of morall things, good, and euill, and I find as before, that this is alſo full of vexation; Wiſedome on the one ſide being incomprehenſible, and the conſideration of ſuch men, their opinions, and doings being weariſome and grieuous to the ſpirit on the otherſide, yea, their madneſſe is endleſſe.

                  For in much wiſedome is much griefe: and he that increaſeth knowledge, increaſeth ſorrow.
               
               A Reaſon why that ſeeking after knowledge, both of wiſedome and folly, there is no contentation of minde, but vexation of ſpirit. For the further that a man ſearcheth into the bottome of things, to giue fuller ſatisfaction to his heart, the more griefe he findeth, and ſorrow is increaſed with knowledge: For,
               Firſt, the accurate ſearch, and diſcuſſing by examination and iudgement of that which is fought, is a great affliction to body and minde.
               Secondly, when a man hath done what he can, hee hath onely attained to the ſight of that great darkeneſſe of ignorance that is in him, Chap. 7. 23. 24. which he thinking by ſtudy to expell, doth more increaſe it, that is, hee more and more ſeeth into what a deepe dungeon, hee and all men are fallen by the ſinne of Adam.
               
               Thirdly, it is difficult, troublous, full of intricate queſtions, and diſtracting doubts, endleſſe, and withall tranſitory. It is neither perfectiue of him that hath it, nor perfectiue of other men, or their matters.
               Fourthly, the more that a wiſe man knoweth, hee ſtill more, more and more beholdeth greater corruption, vanity, folly, madneſſe, and miſery, wherewith his ſpirit is diſcomforted, and grieued, his heart is heauy, his minde diſpairefull. So that he is farther off from happineſſe then the ignorant, that knoweth nothing. For he worketh and eateth, and drinketh and ſleepeth ſoundly, he is without care, he is heartily merry, and ſo is ſtrong and healthfull.
               Fiftly, when a man hath tranſcended common capacities, his darke parables, inſtructions, and counſels, of many ſhall be had in contempt, of others hee ſhall be enuyed, and his wiſdome ſhall be but the white of a But to be ſhot at, of ſome he ſhall be ſuſpected, and ſuppreſſed, for Princes are ſuſpicious of the godly-wiſe-learned, I thinke becauſe their rudeneſſe and nakedneſſe lies open to their iudicious eyes; which

made Nero kill his maſter Seneca; or elſe deſire ignorance that the thouſand-headed beaſt might be better held vnder the yoke of gouernment: For if they be wiſe and godly, the rude Princes thinke that their nakedneſſe lyeth open, whereof contempt followeth. This is ethnicall pollicie. Contrarily, the wiſe and godly Prince ſhall by his wiſedome, and godlineſſe bind the conſciences of his people, and cauſe them to reuerence and dread him, as Iob ſaid of himſelfe. This is the onely ſecurity of a Prince, as of Iob, Dauid, Solomon, Ioſiah. Moreouer, if the wiſe would haue the benefit of his wiſedome to redound to many, he muſt deſcend to their meanneſſe, and rudeneſſe, and of a plentifull ſeed-ſowing moſt commonly reape little, and ſometimes nothing.
               Sixtly, he ſhall ſee the foole oft-times graced, countenanced, preferred for money, and other ſiniſter reſpects, when he for all his wiſedome ſhall not be regarded, but be buried in obſcurity, and obliuion.
               Seauenthly, If a man vnderſtand all miſteries, and all knowledge, and that no ſecret be hid from him, all cannot free him from death, but it ſhall rot in the graue with him: Wherefore if a man know not himſelfe to be in the number of Gods Elect, if in the curious ſearch of all things, he cannot find that in himſelfe, what contentation, reſt, ioy, quietneſſe of conſcience, what happineſſe can knowledge bring him? nay rather it will increaſe his ſorrow. Wherefore all humaine knowledge is vaine, euen nothing, and worſe then nothing. For when a man hath attained to all knowledge that can be comprehended in mans braine, the Deuill hath ſtill more then hee: For he hath been in the kingdome of glory, and ſeene God face to face. And if a man had as he hath, how much ſtill ſhould he be the better? Surely, if a man know not onely the depth of Gods wiſedome in the world, but the ſecrets of the kingdome of glory, and of the damnation of hell, &amp; alſo could by words vtter them, he ſhould notwithſtanding liue in miſerable perplexity all his life, till hee had this ſauing knowledge, which ſhould be his onely ioy and comfort both in life and death.
               This onely ſhould ſweeten all the miſeries of this life,

whereas the other doth exacerbate, and turne all the prerogatiues, delights, and pleaſures of this life into gall, and wormewood. There is no felicity on earth but this; feare God, and keepe his commandements: For he that hath obtained all worldly wiſedome, cannot by the ſame worke out a felicitie to himſelfe in this crooked ſtate, and vaine condition of all things.

                  Verſe 1. 
                  I ſaid in my heart, goe to now, I will prooue thee with mirth, therefore inioy pleaſure: and behold, this alſo is vanitie.
               
               
                  
                     SOlomon hauing found no profit, no happy contentation in knowledge, nor in things ſubiect to knowledge, purpoſeth now to try what contentation may redound to him by the vſe of the creatures, all care caſt away, whereof aboue other men hee had the full poſſeſſion and fruition. This verſe containeth 1. a declaration of his counſell about the finding out of the chiefe good, by the tryall of another way. 2. his determination or cenſure, which is amplified by a note of attention, or aſſeueration, I ſaid in my heart, &amp;c. As if he ſhould ſay, I haue already tryed what profit the ſtudies of wiſedome can afford; but neither in contemplation, nor in experimentall knowledge found I any thing, ſaue onely much affliction of the fleſh, and vexation of minde; for contentation cannot be attained, nor grieuances auoyded thereby. Well, then I purpoſed in my heart to proue what profit the vſe of worldly things might bring vnto me: And firſt of all, tis before I ſubdued my body to the ſpirit of my minde, ſuppoſing that the chiefe good wherein the ſoule reſteth contented, was to be traced out by that path whereby a man commeth neereſt vnto God, but found no contentment at all, yea contrarily ſorrow; ſo now on the contrary, I fell into a conſideration of the vſes of the manifold creatures of God, for mans neceſſitie,

comfort, and delight. Therefore now I began to apply and exerciſe my wiſedome in the cheering, and pampering of the fleſh, in bathing my ſelfe in the pleaſures and delights of the ſonnes of men: I with-held nothing from the deſires of my heart, but yeelding my ſelfe to all my bodily appetites, as farre forth as lawfully I might, to try what more profit and better contentment I, or any other that is moſt delighted in this way, might finde in this courſe of life. But when I reflected my ſpirit vpon the conſideration of this way alſo, I ſaw that here was nothing but vanitie. For there is no ſtedfaſtneſſe in the things that conſume away euen with the moderate vſing, and the body together with them alſo, and the immoderate vſe thereof would be a greater burden to the fleſh, than the immoderate ſtudyes of Learning. Becauſe immoderation in this kinde would bring a ſure and ſudden deſtruction both to body and ſoule. Wherefore neither in the moderate nor immoderate vſe thereof was there any felicitie, but vanity.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 2. 
                  I ſaid of laughter, it is mad: and of mirth what doth it?
               
               A Confirmation of the cenſure: Mirth and pleaſure are vanitie. For when I had ſought out and tryed what contentment epicuriſh and ſenſuall liuing could afford to him that is moſt addicted to it; I ſaw that laughter was madde, and mirth reaſonleſſe, both vaine. For indeede the matter of laughter is mans ſhame, or nakedneſſe; it is follie, or brutalitie to be lamented, not laughed at. For let a man laugh at what he will, and but ſmile at any thing, when he returneth to ſobriety of heart, and to the prudent conſideration of himſelfe, and the thing that he laughed at, he ſhall finde it to be follie, vanitie, miſerie, I meane a ſlippe, or defect of that wiſedome, prudence, prouidence, and reaſon in ſome ſaying, deede, or euent which is not in the perfect image of God, nor in man as he is man, to wit, graue, wiſe, reuerend, honourable, perfect in this imperfect ſtate that no light conceit of him, his words, actions, euents in the mindes of men ſhould moue laughter. For what matter of laughter is there

in the perſons, ſpeaches, deedes, euents of reuerend Sages, Kings, Iudges, of Chriſt, and of God? Our Sauiour Chriſt often ſorrowed, but we cannot learne that euer he laughed, neither yet conceiue at what he ſhould laugh. It is recorded in ſtories that the Philoſopher Heraclitus alwaies wept and ſorrowed, becauſe he ſaw nothing but vanities and miſerie, yea, bruitiſhneſſe in all the dealings of men, whether in their ſobriety or laughter. Contrarily, Democritus alwaies laughed. What was the matter or obiect of his laughter? Euen the follie, madneſſe, vanitie, brutalitie of men, which by laughter he neither reioyced at nor approued. Finally, whenſoeuer a man laugheth at things great or ſmall, let him by gathering onething of another but diue to the ground of his laughter, and he ſhall finde ſome matter of griefe and repentance, both in the perſon, or thing laughed at, and in himſelfe, or at leaſt in the one. For if Adam had neuer fallen, there ſhould neuer haue beene laughter, nor weeping, but an heart poſſeſt with heauenly ioy, euen ioyfull ſobriety.
               The epicuriſh and ſenſuall laughter therefore that Solomon here ſpeaketh of, is madneſſe, euen the corruption and intemperance of reaſon, the froath of vaine imaginations, the ſuperfluity of the ſpleene, corrupted by the fall, and bewrayeth oft times much ſinne in the ſoule, which bringeth griefe and repentance. And as laughter was madneſſe, ſo was mirth vnreaſonableneſſe, or fooliſhneſſe. For it neither cauſaily bringeth out of it ſelfe, nor yet accidentally occaſioneth any profit.
               It is ſhort, and vaniſhing, dying with the action, like the ſtroke of an inſtrument, and the taſte of honey: The one whereof in the continuall vſe groweth weariſome, and is in the end the greateſt toyle; the other groweth bitter, and is in the end very loathſome: Neither affoord ſolide contentment. For hee that maketh the time of this life but a play, is as hee that maketh it but a market: Both ſhall receiue the ſame iudgement; the one for his Iouil
                     •
                  y, as the leud Iauils of theſe dayes tearme it, the other for his drudgery. Both are their owne Idols, oppoſite one to another, and both to God. Therefore are both, the carefulneſſe of the one, and

carefulneſſe of the other, a burden to the conſcience. So that in laughter and mirth, wine and women, diſſoluteneſſe and luxury, there is no felicity, but vanity, no contentation, but deſperation. Yet notwithſtanding all this we muſt put a difference betweene the common frailty of mans nature, which God paſſeth by, and the ſinful laughter of the wicked.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 3. 
                  I ſought in mine heart to giue my ſelfe vnto wine (yet acquainting mine heart with wiſedome) and to lay hold on folly, till I might ſee what was that good for the ſonnes of men, which they ſhould doe vnder heauen all the dayes of their life.
               
               AN expoſition or declaration of Solomons counſell concerning the finding out of the chiefe good, by the tryall of another way, which is the exerciſe of his wiſedome in pompe, and magnificence, to the end of the tenth verſe. Firſt he found no content in the ſtudies of learning, or ſpeculations of the minde: Secondly, he found leſſe comfort in the contrary courſe, bodily pleaſures: Now thirdly hee will try the 
                     ••
                  xt or middle courſe, in the right vſe of all worldly delights, and bodily pleaſures, according to the direction of wiſedome, which is the glory of a King, euen that thing which all men count happineſſe. And for the attainment of his intended purpoſe, he fared ſtill deliciouſly, and by wiſedome beheld the follies and vanities thereof: Namely, how Princes wanting wiſedome, abuſed themſelues in the diſſolute and immoderate vſe of theſe delights, &amp; all prerogatiues, yea oft times transformed themſelues into the natures of beaſts, that ſo he might behold the true and right vſe thereof, and conſequently find out, yea worke out a perfect contentation to himſelfe in ſuch an happy ſtate during the time of life, as many men haue dreamed of, and aimed at, but none for lacke of wiſedome to enter into, and keepe the right path, haue attained. As the Al

                  hymiſts hold a poſſibility of making their Philoſophers ſtone, to turne yron into gold; ſo doe men imagine a poſſibilitie of a worldly felicitie to change ſinfull wretches into gods. But as the moſt learned could neuer find the one, ſo neither ſhall the moſt wiſe and wealthy euer

find the other. For this cauſe doth God lay ſore trauaile, and croſſes on men, to humble their pride thereby. For we children of Adam would faine be as Gods; Gen. 3. 5 6. We ſtriue violently to runne backe into Paradiſe againe, but that is done away, and another is ſet before vs, into which earthly dregges haue no deſire to enter: For the Eele loueth the mudde, not the chriſtall Springs, and the Toade loueth ſcumme and ditches, not the Pallace.

Firſt, he propoundeth the ſame generally; I made me great workes. All the workes that I did were curious, and coſtly, as mans wit could deuiſe the manner, and the world could afford the matter. So that the ſeate of my Pallace in all the workes thereof, was as it were a reſemblance of the World, and the glory thereof, that mine eyes, and ſenſes being filled with what pleaſures and delights my heart could imagine, I might enioy full contentment. To which purpoſe I built me houſes moſt large and ſpacious, whoſe timber workes were of Cedars, and pillars of Almug trees; I made me Chambers and Galleries for all vſes, for neceſſary vſes, for delights, and pleaſures, for ſolitarineſſe, and priuate meditation, for Summer and Winter, &amp;c. For Cedars and ſiluer were as plentifull with me, as ſtones in the ſtreetes, and Sycomore trees in the dales. Of gold I had abundance. For there came yeerely ſixe hundred ſixty ſixe talents of gold, beſides that which I had of Merchant men, and ſpice Merchants, of the Kings of Arabia, and Gouernours of the Countrey. I made me a great throne of Iuory, and ouer-laide it with the beſt gold, the like whereof was not in any Kingdome. All my drinking veſſels were of gold, and all my veſſels of the Forreſt of Lebanon were of pure gold. I had alſo abundance of precious ſtones, Iewels, ſpices, oyntments, odours, and what precious things

the earth could affoord, were ſent to me for preſents. I had 1 King. 4. 7. 22, &amp;c.twelue Officers ouer all Iſrael, to prouide victuals for me, and my houſhold. I had for one dayes prouiſion thirty meaſures of fine flower, and ſixty meaſures of meale, ten fat Oxen, and an hundred Sheep, beſides Harts, and Roe-bucks, and Fallow Deare, and fatted Fowle. So that the meate of my Table, the ſitting of my Seruants, the attendance of my Miniſters, and their apparell, my Butlers, &amp;c. were an aſtoniſhment to Princes. Moreouer, I had foure thouſand ſtables 2 Chron. 9. 25. 1 Kings 4. 26. Chap. 10. 26.of Horſes for my Chariots, ten Horſes in euery Stable, forty thouſand in all. I had foureteene hundred Chariots, and twelue hundred Horſemen. I made me two hundred Targets of beaten gold, ſixe hundred ſheckles went to one Target. I made me alſo three hundred ſhields of beaten gold, three pound of gold went to one ſhield. Alſo I was at peace with all Kings, which did reuerence to me, and ſent me preſents, who were deſirous to heare of my wiſedome, and of my workes. My Princes and Officers alſo were loyall and faithfull to me. So that I enioyed the fulneſſe of proſperity, and ſecurity. And becauſe no pleaſant thing might be wanting to me, I planted me vineyards, and furniſhed them with the choyſeſt Vines of all ſorts.

I had alſo others borne in my houſe, the children of Captiues, euen the choyſeſt, and beſt qualified of thoſe that had beene taken captiues in the warres. Alſo I had great poſſeſſions of Cattle, both of Oxen and Sheepe, of Horſes, Camels, and Mules, partly for the prouiſion of my Houſe, partly for other vſes, aboue all that were before mee in Ieruſalem.
               
            
            
               
                  Verſe 8. 
                  I gathered me alſo ſiluer and gold, and the peculiar treaſure of Kings, and of the Prouinces: I got mee men-ſingers, and women-ſingers, and the delights of the ſonnes of men, as muſicall inſtruments, and that of all ſorts.
               
               FIftly, alſo of ſiluer and gold, I had abundance, which yeerely came vnto me, beſides that which came once euerie three yeeres from Tarſhiſh, for veſſels and vtenſils, for the beautifying of my houſe, for ſhields and targets, and other vſes; and other precious treaſures, which for their rareneſſe and beauty, Princes value at higheſt rate, and are therefore peculiar to them. I got me alſo men-ſingers, and women-ſingers, that both had perfect skill and pleaſant voyces, that not onely the ſhrilneſſe of the quauering treble, and the grauity of the deepe baſe, and the delightfull mediocrity of the mixt tenor mitigating the ſharpeneſſe of the one, and eleuating the flatneſſe of the other, might refreſh my ſpirits with their pleaſant ayre; but alſo that the ſong it ſelfe might affect

my minde with the lightſome ayre of pleaſant thoughts, inſinuated by the pleaſing deceits of harmonicall allurements, to remoue the impreſſion of penſiue melancholy, and to pacifie the ſurges of cholericke fancies, that ſuch obiects being ſtolne away from my minde vnawares, as cares are by ſleepe, I might be retracted from the diſturbance of intemperate paſſions. I had alſo the delights of the ſonnes of men, euen all kindes of muſicall Inſtruments. The Hebrew words are Schaddah, Schiddoth, id eſt, deuaſtation, and deuaſtations; or ſpoyle, and ſpoyles, and ſignifieth the faireſt women taken captiues in the ſacking of a City, as Xantis Pagnine tranſlateth it, which thing was the common cuſtome of old times. The words afore-going, delights of the ſonnes of men, import as much, being, as I thinke, more properly related to Solomons three hundred Concubines, which were the faireſt women of captiuities. For as Wife and Children are termed the pleaſures of the eyes, and Idols the delight of the eyes; ſo alſo may theſe be termed the delights of the ſonnes of men, in thoſe warlike times; Iud. 5. 30. Haue they not ſped? haue they diuided the prey, to euery man a damozell or two? which was a ſpeciall reward. But Tremellius tranſlateth it, Symphonie, and Symphonies, that is, all kindes of muſicall Inſtruments, as it is in our Engliſh Tranſlation. For melody is a mixture of like, and vnlike voyces, or of like, and vnlike ſounds, in the mixture and temperature whereof, one is ſo refracted and retuſed by another, that of them all, Symphonie, id eſt, a diſcordant concord ariſeth after the imitation of the elements refracted in an harmonicall mixture in compound bodies. Now muſicke is delightfull to young men, and may well be thus termed.

                  So I was great, and increaſed more then all that were before mee in Ieruſalem: alſo my wiſedome remained with mee.
               
               A Concluſion containing an amplification of his pompous magnificence, by a compariſon of all his predeceſſours. I became great both in power and wealth, eminent

and glorious aboue all. Neither in this royall ſplendour was I intemperate, giuing the reines to inordinate affections and luſts, but I behaued my ſelfe both in the getting and vſage of theſe things, according to the direction of wiſedome, that I might both freely without checke of conſcience reioyce in them, and alſo be admired and honoured in the mindes and hearts of mine owne ſubiects, and forraine Princes.

               SIxtly, moreouer beſides theſe particular prerogatiues, whereof I haue made mention by name, I with-held no delights from my ſenſes, which either by the wiſedome of my minde, or by the ſubmoniſhing inclinations of my ſenſes I perceiued to affoord acceſſe of ioyfull contentment. Neither did I ſuppreſſe the fancies of my heart with checke, or delay, but it reioyced in the eaſie, ſpeedy, and full attainement thereof. Therefore my heart reioyced in all my labour which I tooke for the ioy of my heart. And this was the portion of all my labour, euen to reioyce my ſelfe in the vſe of theſe things. Thus farre of the triall of the third way to felicitie.

                  Then I looked on all the workes that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to doe: and behold all was vanity, and vexation of ſpirit; and there was no profit vnder the Sunne.
               
               AN expoſition of Solomons counſell, in the reuiew of his pompeous magnificence, and of the euent thereof. After that by wiſedome I had effected all that was in mine heart to do, and gotten what comfort, contentment and ioy could be affoorded to my heart in the poſſeſſion, ſight, and vſe thereof, the teſtimony of other Kings and Princes in their admiration of my royall ſplendour, alſo furthering and confirming

in me the conceited hope of happineſſe: then vpon vnpartial reueiw of all my glory, according to true wiſdome, without deceitfull flattery of my ſelfe, I ſaw no profit, no ſolidity, no perpetuity, but changeableneſſe, and chancefulneſſe both in the parts and in the whole. For both the things themſelues are ſubiect to caſualties, and alterations, and howſoeuer in time to vaniſh quite away, and alſo age it ſelfe maketh the moſt delightfull things weariſome. So that what felicity ſo euer men, through the errour of their mindes, may imagine to themſelues, or the things of the world may occaſion them to hope for, by their deceitfull ſhew promiſing what they cannot performe; yet there is no ſuch profit, no ſound tranquility, no conſtant reſt in them, all things being vncertaine, fleeting, ſubiect to diſſolution by a thouſand wayes, ſome apparent, ſome ſuſpected, moſt vnknowne, holding the vnſtable minde, and doubtfull heart alwayes in vnquiet ſuſpence. Therefore by reaſon of this vanity, they are a vexation to the ſpirit, giuing no more contentment thereto, then light wind doth to the hungry appetite and empty ſtomacke. Neither indeed can the armies of heauen and earth afford it, becauſe God hath ſubdued all things vnder vanity.

                  iall ſenſualitie, and alſo fooliſhneſſe, with a confirmation therof. Wiſedome and madneſſe are quite contrary. Madneſſe is inconſideratenes, raſhneſſe, epicuriſhneſſe, mirth, and iollity, without all care. Folly ſeemeth here to be a mixture of both. But wiſedome in the wicked cannot be tearmed wiſedome, but worldly craftineſſe, brutiſh, or diabol

                   the right way. Such wiſe men, as the world counteth

wiſedome, are in the Scriptures termed brutiſh, and fooliſh, Ier. 10. 8. And beaſts euery where, becauſe their wiſedome is onely exerciſed in fulfilling their brutiſh appetites, and fleſhly luſts, which is a thing common to man with beaſts, neither can the vnregenerate do otherwiſe. 1 Ioh. 2. 16 A foole is either naturall or ſpirituall. The naturall foole is either reaſonable, or reaſonleſſe. The reaſonable is hee that wiſely and prudently ordereth himſelfe according to reaſon, which reaſon notwithſtanding is corrupt and limited to luſt. Rom 1. 22. 1 Ioh. 2. 16. So that in him there is nothing but folly and wickedneſſe. Such a foole is euery man vnregenerate, Pſal. 14 1. 2. The reaſonleſſe foole, is either he that hath not ſound reaſon, whoſe principles of reaſon are cra
                     •
                  kt, broken and confuſed, but yet to his power doth wickedly; or elſe that hath reaſon, but vſeth none, being captiue to his luſts, of whom there is leſſe hope than of the other. To this foole, ſhame and reproch belongeth. He is full of miſchiefe, proud, wilfull, wrathfull, reuengefull, raſh, and is inwrapped in many dangers, and troubles. For as he gloryeth in his craft, and is miſchieuous, ſo miſchiefe falleth on him, it is his portion. The ſpirituall foole is euery carnall Profeſſour of the Goſpel in outward ſhew without the power thereof, who hath a generall illumination, confuſed, and broken principles, but his manners and all his courſes are heatheniſh, and brutiſh, being captiuated to his luſts. Yea, and he is a foole alſo, that hath vnderſtanding, knowledge and learning, but yet ſerueth not God but his owne luſts thereof, deceiuing his owne heart. There are abundance of ſuch fooles now a dayes. Of all theſe fooles Solomon here ſpeaketh, but more ſpecially, I thinke, of the reaſonleſſe fooles. To diſcouer the vanity, and folly of ſpirituall fooles more at large. This fooliſhneſſe is that common mediocrity or meane, which worldly wiſe-men, polititians, and moraliſts, and all fooles doe falſly imagine to be vertue, or the beſt profeſſion, which conſiſteth in the middle of their extreames. But in caſe of religion, their darke hearts neuer rightly conceiued what either extreames or middles were. For this common meane, is a mixture of light with darkeneſſe, good with euill, ſweet with

ſowre, wiſedome with ſenſuality, pretious with vile, religion with carnality. But ſuch indifferences are hatefull and loathſome before God, and vpright men. This the Scriptures tearme folly, and ſuch wiſe ones, fooles and hypocrites, Matth. 23.
               Vnderſtand therefore the deceitfulneſſe of the heart, and the deluſion of Sathan, euen that deepe ſophiſtrie, by which whole multitudes doe periſh, yea euen all, except the very Elect. For what is that common wiſedome, reaſon, indifference, honeſty of men, but a certaine mediocrity or meane mixt of linnen and woollen, of ſowre with ſweet, of religion with fleſhly morality; as though that all things, religion and all ſhould onely tend, and ayme at a happy worldly ſtate, or glorifying of the fleſh or outward man, or to approach as neere to this marke as may be. This was the ſinne of Saul. He did not aime at the ſole glory of God, but mingled the holy commandement and his owne luſt, euen his vaine-glory, together. He would not looſe his owne glory in that triumph: Therefore Samuel told him that hoe was become a foole. 1 Sam. 13. 13. Such fooles were the Iſraelites. 1 Kings 18. 21. and Exod. 31. 1. Such fooles were the Phariſes, Princes, people of the Iewes. The diſciples being yet but rude, and weake were tainted with this folly, Ioh. 12. 22. Yet in them it was but infirmity, becauſe they were in Gods election, and actually beleeued, and followed him in ſincerity. Euery profeſſour of the Goſpel, not inwardly renued by the ſpirit of ſanctification is a foole, but we muſt take heed of iudging, and cenſuring: For the worke of the ſpirit in the regenerate is not to make a mixture of heauenly &amp; carnall things, but by mortification to ſub due all things to himſelfe, euen to conuert the whole man inward and outward into ſpirit, to bring euery thought and imagination, euery word and worke into captiuity vnder Chriſt, which is true wiſedome and liberty. So that whereas it is ſaid, that in ſtate of grace we are partly fleſh, partly ſpirit, in all our actions and affections, it is not meant of mixture, for where there is mixture, there is no ſound, no ſauing conuerſion, but the Foxe will to his kinde; but that we are as the ruſty Iron in the fire, the

menſtruous or filthy rag in the fullers ſoap, nay rather Lazarus dead in the graue, into whom the ſoule being re-entred, cauſeth motion of the ſpirits, firſt in the heart, than of the pulſes, and bloud, then of a leg, or arme, &amp;c. till at length he be riſen wholly out of the graue, and at laſt brought to his former ſtate of life, and ſo is death ouercome of life. But what this meaneth, our common, honeſt, reaſonable, wiſe, indifferent minded men, neither will nor can conceiue. For they know not through the hardneſſe of their hearts, that the ground of their Chriſtian profeſſion, is the vtter denyall of themſelues, or the vtter deſtruction of the fleſh, and the beſt things thereof, as enmity to the grace of Chriſt, Rom. 8. 7. Phil. 3. 7. that they might be wholly in him, and for him, 1 Cor. 6. 19. 20. which is the maine ſcope of this preſent treatiſe of Solomon. To redreſſe this beautifull, but fundamentall euill, let vs remember, and lay to heart theſe two Texts of Scriptures. The firſt is Dauids charge to Solomon his ſonne, 2 Chron. 28. 9. And thou my ſonne Solomon, know thou the God of they father, and ſerue him with a perfect heart, and willing minde: for the Lord ſearcheth all hearts, and vnderſtandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts. The ſecond, is the ground and life of euery word and worke, which maketh it acceptable in the ſight of God. Rom. 14. 23. Whatſoeuer is not of faith, is ſinne. He that wanteth true faith ſhall periſh euerlaſtingly, whatſoeuer, how great ſoeuer his workes be.
               Laſtly, Solomon here confirmeth his experiments, with the conſiderate and iudicious view thereof, by the conſcience of his ſufficiency in wiſedome, and experience, which is figured by a Prelepſis, or preuention of an obiection, thus. It may be that thou haſt not perfectly knowne the difference of wiſdome and madneſſe, and folly, and ſo haſt not iudged and determined rightly of things, and the vſe thereof. Anſ. I haue ſufficiently knowne, and tryed the truth of that which I haue ſpoken concerning theſe things, and the vanity thereof. This aſſertion is amplyfied by an argument of the Greater denyed. No man can know or try more than I haue done? The words are figured by a communication, What can the man doe? Haadam,

This teſtimony of himſelfe is confirmed by the dignity and excellency of his perſon, (King,) amplified by a compariſon included in the demonſtratiue article, noting eminence, hammelek, the King, the moſt excellent King. As if he ſhould ſay, If Kings that haue power to get the knowledge, and experience of things, are to be beleeued, then much more the moſt eminent King is ſufficient to know, trie, and determine the truth of all this that hath beene ſaide, therefore to be beleeued.

                  Then I ſaw that wiſedome excelleth folly, as farre as light excelleth darkeneſſe.
               
               A Determination or cenſure vpon his iudicious reuiew of the two former wayes, in the commendation of wiſedome, and diſpraiſe of folly, figured by a prolepſis thus; Thou ſeemeſt to put no difference betweene wiſedome, and madneſſe, and folly, in that thou canft finde no profit, no content in any of them, but onely vanity and vexation. Anſ. Although that true felicity is not to be found in wiſedome, neither in the wiſedome of this World, nor in the literall knowledge of the Goſpell, yet it altogether excelleth folly, yea, is contrary to folly. The propoſition hee illuſtrateth by a compariſon of things contrary. Euen as light excelleth darkeneſſe, not in degrees, but in nature; ſo doth wiſedome excell folly, not in degrees, but in nature, hauing no fellowſhip or communion with it, but mortifieth it, as light excelleth darkeneſſe, and water extinguiſheth fire. By folly, he meaneth the crooked actions and conuerſation of wicked idiots, and crafty colts, vnaduiſed fooles, and cunning fooles, whoſe wiſedome is worldly, ſenſuall, and diuelliſh; Iames 3. 15. ſeparated from all feare of God, and grounds of naturall goodneſſe, and exerciſed in euill, as Tamar ſaide to Amnon, intiſing her to inceſt; Thou ſhalt be a foole in Iſrael. Such a foole as he here meaneth, was Nabal.
               
            
            
               
               
                  Verſe 14. 
                  The wiſe mans eyes are in his head, but the foole walketh in darkeneſſe: and I my ſelfe perceiued alſo that one euent happeneth to them all.
               
               A Confirmation of his determination in the commendation of wiſedome, &amp; diſpraiſe of folly, and alſo a reuiew of the euent of wiſedome, and the wiſe. The wiſe mans eyes are in his head. The head is as a Tower, the eyes are as watchmen looking round about, and afarre off, and as the Sunne which is the eye of the World. Watchmen in the top of a Tower, are watchfull, diligent, and circumſpect, fore-ſeeing euill a farre off, and preuenting it before it ſurprize them. So in the eyes of a wiſe man there is vnderſtanding, diſcerning, iudgement, ſobriety, heedfull diligence, fore-ſight. Wiſedome ordereth all the wayes of a wiſe man, he eſcheweth dangers, miſchiefes, inconueniences, and euery hurtfull thing; he procureth commodities on all ſides, he hath delight and pleaſure in the workes of his hands. Whereas contrarily, the foole is blind, he knowes not what he ſaith, nor what he doth; he obſerues not perſons, times, and place, but ruſheth headily forward, committing euery word, and deede to fortune. He falles into the ditch on euery ſide, hee daſheth his head againſt euery poſt, he wrappes himſelfe among buſhes and briars, as they that walke in darkeneſſe, and vnknowne places, and is rent and torne, and if he ſtruggle out, he is neuer the neerer, but is by and by in new dangers, becauſe hee wanteth the lanterne of Gods Word and Spirit, to direct him into the right pathes, and to guide him therein, that onely is it that maketh the ſimple wiſe, and teacheth man knowledge.
               The World is Gods Booke, euery thing that a man heareth or ſeeth, is a leafe, or a line, wherein hee may reade ſomething to his owne inſtruction, and further edification. The wiſe man beholdeth the wiſedome, prouidence, goodneſſe, and iuſtice of God in all things. Againe, he beholdeth the deprauation and corruption of all things, brought in by the enuie of the Diuell. Hee diſcerneth the vprightneſſe of

godlineſſe, and the tortuoſity of wickedneſſe, the plaine pathes of wiſedome, and the peruerſe wayes of folly in all things, and in euery thing. The one hee chuſeth, ordering himſelfe in all his wayes according to wiſedome, the other he refuſeth, and correcteth, and retracteth himſelfe by wiſedome. So that the vnderſtanding, ſober, heedfull, watchfull eyes of the wiſe, looke not on the things themſelues, or outward appearances, but on Gods wiſedome, goodneſſe, iuſtice in the things; yea, hee beholdeth Sathans malice, and mans miſery, and diſcerneth the times, and the ſeaſons, the workes of God therein, and the counter-workes of the Diuel. But the foole walketh in darkeneſſe. The foole hath as it were no eyes, or eyes wherein the ſight is periſhed. He looketh on things, as doth the wiſe, but he ſeeth into nothing. Therefore Solomon ſaith, Prou. 17. 24. The eyes of a foole are in the ends of the earth; that is, light, heedleſſe, wandring eyes, ſhewing the confuſion of many vaine imaginations in the head, but no diſcreete apprehenſion, no ſobriety of wiſedome, no prudent obſeruation. He looketh on outward appearances, and obſerueth childiſhly. But hee cannot ſee one whit how the Scriptures, teaching the whole knowledge of God, and of our ſelues, his wiſedome, mans folly, his grace, mans malice, are continually fulfilled before his eyes. Hee that is in darkeneſſe, diſcerneth not colours, no more doth the foole things that differ. The foole gathereth vp follies, and glorieth in ſome imitatiue wicked ſubtilties, and a parable or wiſe ſentence is harſh, and odious in his mouth. The foole hath the eyes of a beaſt, iudging, chuſing, refuſing, according to his carnall affections and luſts, &amp;c. And I my ſelfe perceiued alſo that one euent happeneth to them all. Here is his reuiew of the euent of wiſedome, and the wiſe. This worldly wiſedome which men ſo much magnifie, maketh not a man happie. For I my ſelfe not forgetfull of my ſelfe in my royalty, not enamoured of my beauty, not kiſſing my hand, perceiued alſo as well as others, that one euent or end happeneth to the wiſe &amp; fooliſh, and both of them are alike ſubiect to the manifold afflictions, calamities, ſorrowes, and miſeries of this mortall life. Therefore ſpeake what you can in the

commendation of worldly wiſedome, and act what you can thereby, it ſhall in the end be co-incident with folly.

                  Then ſaide I in my heart, as it happeneth to the foole, ſo it happeneth euen to me; and why was I then more wiſe? Then I ſaide in my heart, that this alſo is vanity.
               
               
                  HIs determination, or concluſion vpon the reuiew. When I ſaw that the wiſe and foole had one euent, and chance; I reaſoned thus within my heart. If good things befall the foole as well as mee, and euill things befall me as well as the foole, then haue I to no purpoſe wearied my body and minde, in ſearching out wiſedome: But I ſee that it doth ſo; therefore to defraud a mans ſoule of pleaſure, in ſtriuing for wiſedome; is to no purpoſe, and conſequently it is alſo vanity.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 16. 
                  For there is no remembrance of the wiſe more then of the foole for euer, ſeeing that which is now, in the dayes to come ſhall be forgotten; and how dyeth the wiſe man? as the foole.
               
               A Confirmation of his reaſon concluded in the verſe aforegoing, by two arguments, the one in the beginning, the other in the end of the verſe. Concerning the former. If the wiſe man with all his words and workes be not had in euerlaſting remembrance, no more then the foole, then is the labour and wiſedome of the wiſe to no purpoſe: but the antecedent or former part is true, becauſe that both the perſons, and their doings that now are, ſhall be forgotten in ſucceeding generations; therefore is the conſequent or latter part true alſo. Time is a depth which ſwalloweth vp all things. And the decourſe of time is a paſſage, leauing all things behind it. The further that time paſſeth away, the more confuſedly ſtill wee ſee things paſt, which in the end quite vaniſh out of minde, as the bird or arrow that flyeth into the profundity of the ayre, or ſtone that falleth into the height of the deepe. Now the fiſh, and the ſtone, the bird and the arrow, are all one, euen without difference, to him that ſeeth neither, yea, plaine nothing; and ſo are all things

vaniſhed out of minde. And how dyeth the wiſe man? as the foole. Here is the latter argument, whereby hee confirmeth the vanity of wiſedome, by the ſame condition thereof with follie, figured by a communication, or rather an exclamation, intimating, that the wiſe is greatly to be commiſerated, becauſe he receiueth no more fruit of his worthy labours, then the mad and fooliſh, that liue in ſenſuality and bodily pleaſures, after the manner of beaſts. It cannot be diſcerned by their end, in outward appearance, whether is the happier, or whether is the more miſerable.

               A Concluſion. Therefore am I ſo farre from hope of obtaining any contentment, profit, or happineſſe in this World, that I rather hated life it ſelfe, hauing no matter of loue, or deſire in it. My reaſon is, becauſe that all things which men doe in this life, are grieuous. Euery worke is full of griefe in it ſelfe, and occaſioneth griefe to others. The workes of the brutiſh Epicure are grieuous; the workes of the fooliſh that thinketh himſelfe wiſe, are grieuous; and ſo are the workes of the wiſe, ſeeing that he dyeth, and his wiſedome is forgotten, as they and theirs are. Moreouer, hee confirmeth this reaſon againe by a Proſſyllogiſme, or addition of another reaſon. For all, as well the beſt, as the worſt things, is vanity and vexation of ſpirit.

                  Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken vnder the Sunne: becauſe I ſhould leaue it vnto the men that ſhall be after mee.
               
               THis verſe hath relation to the reuiew, and euent of his pompous magnificence, verſe 11. He looked on all his workes, and labours, but all was vanity and vexation; Why? becauſe there was no profit vnder the Sunne. Here is further ſet downe the conſequent of that euent, namely, that he obtained not only no contentment by his great workes, but alſo hated them. The reaſon of his hatred is, becauſe hee ſhould leaue them to the poſſeſſion and vſe of another man, who ſhould be heire to all his labours, yet neuer tooke any paines for them.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 19. 
                  And who knoweth whether hee ſhall be a wiſe man or a foole? yet ſhall hee haue rule ouer all my labour, wherein I haue laboured, and wherein I haue ſhewed my ſelfe wiſe vnder the Sunne.
               
               A Confirmation of the reaſon, figured by the preuention of an obiection, thus: That a man ſhall leaue his labours to another, is no cauſe of griefe: For ſeeing that hee muſt not alwayes liue here; for one generation paſſeth, and another commeth, it is a mans ioy, and comfort rather, yea, the proſperous ſucceſſe of them in their continuance to future generations, giueth great contentment to the heart.
               
                  Anſ. That cannot be, becauſe it is impoſſible for me, or any man to know whether he ſhall be a wiſe man or a foole. It is figured by a communication, to intimate the impoſſibility thereof. And what manner of man ſoeuer hee ſhall be, yet ſhall he haue the rule, command, and vſe of all my labours at his pleaſure, wherein I haue ſo diligently exerciſed my wiſedome. If hee proue a foole, what is the fruit of my labour, and my wiſedome? euen to be the purueyour of another mans ſenſuality, and to ſubminiſter matter for the execution, and maintenance of his folly: So all my labour is

loſt. If he proue a wiſe man, yet will he alter, change, and vſe all my labours according to his owne minde, and ſo ſhall they be transformed, as a veſture, into a new faſhion. Therefore in that a man muſt leaue his labours to another mans poſſeſſion and diſpoſition, that is alſo vanity.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 20. 
                  Therefore I went about to cauſe my heart to deſpaire of all the labour which I tooke vnder the Sunne.
               
               A Concluſion of the reaſon confirmed in the verſe before. Seeing that my wiſedome in my labour, ſhall be either turned into folly, or elſe tranſlated into another faſhion, I iudged it better to deſpaire of getting contentment by my workes, rather then to place any hope in ſuch vncertainties, that I might elſe-where ſeeke for the true happineſſe, that cannot be loſt nor changed. Therefore ſeeing that in the beſt things done here by wiſedome, wee haue more matter of deſpaire than hope, and howſoeuer, are held in continuall ſuſpence, they are meere vanity and vexation.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 21. 
                  For there is a man whoſe labour is in wiſedome, and in knowledge, and in equity: yet to a man that hath not laboured therein ſhall he leaue it for his portion. This alſo is vanity, and a great euill.
               
               AN amplification of the concluſion conteined in the verſe before; Namely, of the deſpaire and griefe of his labour, by an obſeruation of the common condition of men. There is many a man that laboureth to attaine to an happy eſtate here, and that by wiſedome, knowledge and equitie, to which God alſo giueth a bleſſing, that ſo his heart might reioyce without checke of conſcience in the fruition thereof, which is ſeldome incident to the rich; yet ſhall he leaue his eſtate behinde him, to be a portion for another that neuer tooke any paines for it. And ſo be the prouident and true drudge of he knowes not whom; and how it ſhall be vſed and imployed, and bleſſed in the hands of him he altogether knoweth not. Yea, ſometimes it falleth out that the

heire curſeth his patrimony, becauſe that if he had not had ſuch a meanes and prouocation, he ſhould not haue committed ſo many euils. Faelix neceſſitas, quae ad meliora tra

                  For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart wherein he hath laboured vnder the Sunne?
               
               THis verſe hath reference to the 18. verſe before, containing a reaſon of the hatred of his diſpairefull labours, figured by a communication, to giue more weight vnto it. If a man ſee no profit of the labours of his body and minde, then they haue nothing but matter of deſpaire and hatred in them: but what profit, or ioyfull contentment can any man finde in the laborious getting, and carefull keeping of his gettings? Therefore as I ſaid at firſt, ſo after many proofes, I conclude; What profit hath a man of all his labour that hee taketh vnder the Sunne.

                  For all his dayes are ſorrow, and his trauaile griefe; yea, his heart taketh not reſt in the night. This is alſo vanitie.
               
               A Proſſyllogiſme, or confirmation of the former reaſon. He hath no profit of his labours, no calme contentation. Why? For becauſe all his dayes are full of paines, and ſorrowes, trouble, and anger. His trauaile is full of care and anguiſh, feares, and doubts, perplexitie, and anxiety. His heart is depriued of the naturall reft of night. For then hee falleth to reuiew the labours of the time paſt, and to diſpoſe of the trauaile of the time following, to bring all things aptly together, without the interruption of manifold occurrences, or chances, for the accompliſhment of his proiect. Againe, although he would take his reſt, yet the manifold buſineſſes, and exagitations of his thoughts on the day, cauſe

many broken dreames, and fearefull phantaſies, which often diſquiet the ſpirit, and maketh the heart penſiue afterward: So that a man hath no profit of his paines, but his labour for his trauaile, and this alſo is vanity.
               
            
            
               
                  Verſe 24. 
                  There is nothing better for a man, then that hee ſhould eate and drinke, and that he ſhould make his ſoule enioy the good of his labour. This alſo I ſaw, and that it was from the hand of God.
               
               IN this verſe Solomon ſetteth downe the right vſe, and onely good that is to be found in the things of this life, for a remedy, or mitigation of the vanities or miſeries, and declareth the ſame by the efficient cauſe. His propoſition is illuſtrated by a compariſon of the Greater denyed; And it is an anſwere to a ſecret obiection, which is this. If nothing but ſorrow and griefe redound to man of all his labours, to what purpoſe then ſhould a man apply his minde to wiſedome, and his body to trauaile? And if ſo be that a man muſt either depriue himſelfe of life, or elſe prolong his dayes in perpetuall ſorrow, then the world ſeemeth to be made for none other end, then to be an engine of torture vnto men. Anſ. Not ſo neither. For though I haue already prooued that a man can obtaine no true profit, or happy contentation by the things of the world, nor by any thing that can be knowne or done by mans wiſedome: yet it followeth not therefore that there is no good in all things made for mans vſe, by which he may be inabled and helped both to liue, and to order his life according to wiſedome, and vertue. But there is a good in them for which cauſe God hath created them, and imparted the ſame to euery one according to his owne pleaſure. And this good, is not to depend or reſt on them, nor to truſt in them; for therefore hath God made them vncertaine, and vaine, nor yet by treaſuring them vp to depriue a mans ſelfe, or others of their vſe, nor to lauiſh them out, as though they would neuer haue end: but to feede, cheere, and comfort the body therewith, with tranquility of minde reſting on Gods mercy, and ſo to paſſe the time of this life with ioyfull contentation in honeſt labor, not in idleneſſe,

ſenſualitie, or drudgery. He that looketh for more then this in them, is vtterly deceiued, ſeeing that in the beſt vſe of them, they are tranſitory and vaniſhing. Laſtly, this good vſe of them he declareth by the principall efficient cauſe. Not onely the poſſeſſion of theſe things, but alſo their vertue to feed, and refreſh the body, and mind, is the gift of God. Otherwiſe, all wiſedome is full of vanity, and griefe. They come neither by mans prouidence, and endeuour originally, nor by chance, Deut. 8. 17. Therefore let vs returne all praiſe and thankes to him, in the vſage of our ſelues, and vſe of all his gifts.

               A Confirmation of his propoſition, amplified by a compariſon of the Greater denyed, and figured by a communication. Who could receiue more profit, ioy and contentment of theſe tranſitory, and fading things more then I? and who can more ſpeedily, and eaſily obtaine, and more ſecurely poſſeſſe and vſe them more then I? what good thing ſoeuer could be had, and what vſe could be made of them for the pleaſure of my body, and delight of minde, I had it in the perfection thereof, yet this is all that I by experience found, or could conceiue in heart to be found in them.

               AN amplification of this right vſe of worldly things by the efficient cauſe thereof, both in himſelfe and other men. Theſe men are deſcribed by their condition and quality (good;) Goodneſſe is illuſtrated by a diſtinction thereof [in his ſight,] that is, truely good, Pſal 3

things therein for mans vſe, hath giuen wiſedome and knowledge to thoſe that are accepted of him, and feare him, to get them rightly, and to vſe them comfortably. This worke of Gods mercy is illuſtrated by the Antitheſis, or contrary worke of iudgement in the ſinner. Contrarily, God withholdeth this wiſedome, knowledge and ioy from the ſinner, which feareth him not, but turneth his eare from the Law, and maketh no conſcience of his doings, and leaueth him in the power and bondage of his luſts, to torment himſelfe both night and day with carking, caring, and drudgery to gather riches, and yet to depriue himſelfe of all comfort, meate, drinke, cloathing, recreation, &amp;c. This worke of Gods iudgement in the ſinner is declared by the end; Namely, that after this faithleſſe drudge hath treaſured them vp, God might giue them to them that feare him, and are accepted of him, Iob 27. 17. Againe, God doth take them away from good men, when he correcteth their faults, and giueth them to the wicked, that are both theirs and his enemies, as the example of Ezechias doth manifeſt. To conclude; This alſo is vanity and vexation of ſpirit.

                  To euery thing there is a ſeaſon, and a time to euery purpoſe vnder heauen.
               
               
                  
                     SOlomon hath hitherto diſcourſed, and concluded the vanity of mans purpoſes and deſignes of happy contentment. Firſt, by the common obſeruation of things ſubiect to mans knowledge. Secondly, by his owne experimentall knowledge both of wiſedome, and of the vſe of worldly things, in the two former Chapters▪ Now hee continueth ſtill his obſeruation, ſhewing by the conuerſion of times, and particular examples pertaining to knowledge and vſe, that all things, deedes, counſels, euents, good, and euill, are known to God onely, and

in regard of vs doe fluctuate vpon vncertaine iſſues, yea, altogether vncertaine in their beginnings, proceedings and endings, which depend and attend vpon vnſtable times, whatſoeuer our aduiſements &amp; deuices be either in attaining good, or auoyding euill. This is another maine argument▪ or Proſepilogiſme, confirming the Epilogiſme, Cap. 1. 3. Whereby he proueth that a man hath no profit of all his labours. Firſt, he propoundeth it generally in this verſe, and after confirmeth it by an induction of ſundry particulars as hee did before. And here is a liuely expoſition of that which he ſpake, Chap. 1. verſe 8. of the mutability, and corruptibility of all things, All things are full of labour, man cannot vtter it, &amp;c.
               
                  To euery thing there is a ſeaſon. No maruell is it if all mans wiſedome, and the vſe of worldly things, whether ſenſuall or magnificall be ſubiugated to vanity, when as all things, all counſels, all deeds, all euents, ſo variable, and repugnant in this vnquiet world are ſubiected to this inſtable courſe and recourſe of times, which God hath put in his own hand; and in his ſecret prouidence hath prefixed a time vnknowne, and vnalterable by man. To euery thing that is ſubiected to the Law, inclination, and inſtinct of nature, there is a time; and a time to euery purpoſe vnder the Sunne, that is, to euery thing done by the election, counſell, and will of man. To euery thing that neceſſity vrgeth vs to doe there is a time, both of their beginnings and endings, ordained of God: So that wee cannot doe what we would, nor when we would, nor how we would, nor how long wee would, nor ſurceaſe when wee would, nor change when we would. For the hidden foundation of God remaineth ſure, and ſheweth it ſelfe in his time contrary and diuers to our manifold vaine imaginations, deſires, and purpoſes. We therefore and all things with vs, within vs, and without vs, in our bodies, and in our mindes are ſubiect to the inſtabilities of times and ſeaſons, euen to opportunities, and occaſions, in our beginnings, proceedings and endings.

                  A time to be borne, and a time to dye: a time to plant, and a time to plucke vp that which is planted.
               
               FIrſt, it is not in the power of man to come into the world, nor in his will to depart out of the world. But the ſeaſon or opportunity of both, whether by the courſe of nature, or otherwiſe, is prefined by the counſell of God, and is the work of his hand. And as there is a time of the birth and death of man, ſo alſo of the planting and rooting vp of trees, there is a time ordained of God. There is a time of their growth, age, ſtanding, and falling, according to the neceſſitie and vſe of man: For euery man, and euery generation hath his neceſſitie, according to the exigence whereof hee applyeth himſelfe by the information of reaſon, partly to obtaine good, partly to auoyd euill. So there is a time to ſow, and to reape, which things though men voluntarily doe, yet the ground thereof is neceſſitie, and for the doing of them, wee tarry the appointed times, and waite for the conuenient ſeaſons, which are not in our owne power.

                  A time to kill, and a time to heale: a time to breake downe, and a time to build vp.
               
               SEcondly, the times of naturall life and death, are not only appointed of God, but alſo vntimely deaths, by diſeaſes, caſualties, violence, Iuſtice, which wee thinke by skill to preuent, and by prouidence to auoyd, haue their appointed times. And contrarily, deſperate life; namely, mortall euils, both of dangers and diſeaſes, in our reaſon vnauoydable, is in the hands of God, who deliuereth and recou

                  reth, killeth and ſaueth aliue at his pleaſure, to whom nothing is vnpoſſible. Hereof the Scriptures affoord innumerable examples. Dangers, and diſeaſes, troubles and ſickneſſe, deliuerances and recoueries from both, are in the power of God. Moreouer, as there is a time of liuing, dying, planting, and rooting vp: ſo alſo of building and pulling downe, according to the exigence of mans neceſſitie; yea, a time there is of building

houſes where trees, graſſe, and corne haue growne, and beaſts haue beene fed; and a time to feede beaſts, to plant trees, and ſow corne, where paued courts, and ſituations of faire buildings haue beene. And all theſe workes depend vpon the opportunities of times, without the power of man, to which man applieth himſelfe voluntarily by iudgement of reaſon, according to the exigence of a ſecret neceſſity.

For either the want of fore-ſight and diligence in himſelfe, or outward croſſes and chancefull occurrences ſhall cauſe, or elſe occaſion weeping, whether he will or no. Againe, there is a time to mourne, which men deſire to auoid as the greateſt euill; yea, when they cry peace, then is ſorrow at hand, which neither can be auoyded, nor mitigated, nor ended by the counſell of our owne will: For euen that is not in our power. Contrarily, heauineſſe may endure for a night, but vnexpected ioy commeth in the morning; Pſal. 30. 5. 11. As the one commeth vnſent for, ſo the other commeth vnlookt for.

               FOurthly, if a man purpoſe to pull downe an houſe, yet that hee cannot doe euen when he would, but hee muſt tarry for a conuenient ſeaſon. And if hee would gather ſtones together to build an houſe, he muſt craue leaue of opportunity, which dependeth on manifold circumſtances. So that whatſoeuer he prepareth in his heart to doe, the iſſue muſt be of God, yea, opportunity calleth vs out to doe many things that we neuer intended. Alſo there is a time of

marriage, both with whom, and when; and a time for children appointed of God, to which a man muſt yeeld, or elſe procure great and manifold euils to himſelfe. So there is a time to refraine from marriage, and a time to abſtaine from imbracing, vnleſſe a man ſhall bring vpon him the anger of God for his intemperancy,

               FIftly, if a man vſe any traffick by Sea or Land, or by what trade or exerciſe ſoeuer he getteth his liuing, hee muſt heedefully obſerue the opportunity of time: For time and tide tarry no man. Time is to be taken and vſed whiles it ſerueth and offereth it ſelfe, otherwiſe, it is in vaine to follow the bird that is eſcaped. This is a thing, whereof all men repent them, that they tooke not time while time ſerued. Hence Solomon ſaith, Prou. 27. 1. Boaſt not of tomorrow, for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring forth. We in this Land, that doe not wiſely vſe that opportunity of peace which God offereth vs to enrich our ſelues by honeſt and lawfull parſimony, but breake out into pride, and prodigality, venery, and all kinde of vanity, ſhall once repent the miſvſage thereof. We haue had a large and fit opportunity a long time to ſerue God, and to doe good workes; but with the vnprofitable ſeruant we hide our talent in the ground, nay, ſpend all on our luſts, which are as a fire kindled by the fire of hell, to deuoure vp holy things alſo. It is ſaid that in old time they ſpared from backe and belly, and ſuperfluous buildings, to build Churches, and maintaine Friars; but the proud, venereous, politicke, gluttonous Iou

                  A time to rent, and a time to ſow; a time to keepe ſilence, and a time to ſpeake.
               
               SIxtly, there is an opportunity to rent old garments, when they are worne, to be put to other vſes. If they be rent before they be worne, that is vnprofitable; if they be worne too long, that is in-decent, and occaſioneth contempt, and I know not what euill conceit of a man in the mindes of men, as the ſonne of Sirach ſaith; The apparell, countenance, and geſture, declare what a man is. Contrarily, there is a time to ſow garments, both for neceſſity, and comelineſſe. But the ſuperfluity of ſowing bringeth pouerty, and diſcouereth ſhame. For God bleſſeth his owne ordinances, and proſpereth his owne opportunities. But there is no time ordained of God in his will and ordinance for the inuenting, and bringing in of ſtrange faſhions; That is an opportunity taken by the permiſſion of God from the Diuell. Furthermore, though there is neceſſary and continual vſe of ſpeech, yet it is limited and confined to fit opportunity, elſe is it fooliſh babling, diſpleaſing and harſh to the eares of God and man. Therefore ſaith Solomon, Prou. 25. 11. A word fitly ſpoken, is like apples of gold in pictures of ſiluer, id eſt, moſt acceptable, profitable, comfortable, amiable, beautifull. Alſo Chap. 15. 23. Ioy commeth to a man by the anſwer of his mouth, and how good is a word in due ſeaſon? Hee that obſerueth not opportunity of ſpeech, doth oft times depriue himſelfe of many good things, and inwrappeth himſelfe in many miſeries alſo. Further, Solomon ſaith; Prou. 16. 1. The preparations of the heart in man, and the anſwer of the tongue, is from the Lord: Contrarily, there is a time to keepe ſilence. To be ſilent in ſeaſon, is as great a vertue, as to ſpeake in due time; For he that is defectiue in the one, is ſo in the other. Wee moſt commonly offend in ſpeaking, namely, in our owne cauſes; but in ſpeaking on Gods behalfe, and our neighbours, we are commonly mute enough, yea, poſſeſt with a dumbe

ſpirit. But of good ſpeech and ſilence, God giueth opportunity, and ſeaſon. Our tongues are the keyes of God, to open and ſhut the doores of our lippes, and our hearts are, or ſhould be Gods treaſury. Therefore our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith; A good man out of the treaſure of his heart, bringeth out good things. And out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth ſpeaketh. Dauid ſaith, Pſalme 116. 10. I beleeued, therefore I ſpake. Paul ſaith; We ſpeake wiſedome among them that are perfect, 1 Cor. 2. Dauid ſaid; Awake my glory, meaning his tongue. Chriſt was the word of the Father, ſo muſt the beleeuer be the word of Chriſt.

                  A time to loue, and a time to hate: a time of warre, and a time of peace.
               
               SEauenthly, there is a time to loue, as there is a time to ſpeake, and this opportunity of loue is as commonly offered of God. Loue or true friendſhip is the bond of humaine ſociety. By the bond of loue, all the members of the body are knit together into one head: It is the ſinewes of the Church, and common-wealth. Where loue faileth, all tendeth to diſſolution. God is all loue, the Diuell hath knowledge and faith, but hee hath no loue at all▪ Therefore the vertue and power of opportunities, in getting, making, keeping, and vſing friends, is excellent, and neceſſary. Contrarily, there is a time to hate, to know our enemies, to confront, and contend with them, to beware, and auoid them, to encounter and flie away, yea, alſo to make good vſe to our ſelues of the wrongs that are offered vs. For howſoeuer a man ordereth his life, and behaueth himſelfe in all things, loue and hatred, concord and diſcord, good will and enuie ſhall ſift and toſſe all affaires. For the vncleane ſpirit mingleth himſelfe in all things to make confuſion, and to bring deſtruction. Therefore ſaith Solomon, Prou. 28. 4. They that forſake the Law, praiſe the wicked: but they that keepe the Law, contend with them. The wicked are whelpes of the ſame littour, therefore are they affectioned one towards another, and praiſe one another. Rom. 1. 31. Nam. 16. 41. They

grace ſinne in others, to couer their owne blemiſhes, and to preuent reproach, and controulement of their euill dealings and behauiour: but the man of conſcience, that feareth God, will diſcountenance, diſcourage, and diſpraiſe them, reſiſt, and oppoſe them, and ſtriue for the truth vnto death. Hence it is that Dauid ſaith; I hate them that hate thee, and earneſtly contend with them that riſe vp againſt thee.
               
               
                  Ob. Chriſt ſaith, Math. 5. 39. 
                  Reſiſt not euill: but whoſoeuer ſhall ſmite thee on the right cheeke, turne to him the other alſo.
               
               
                  Anſ. Reſiſtance is either a lawfull and harmeleſſe auoiding of euill, or elſe a retaliation, or rendering of like for like, wrong for wrong, reuenge for reuenge, and that is forbidden, Leuit. 19. 17. 18. Yea, wee ought ſo to be poſſeſt with the ſpirit of patience, bounty, and goodneſſe, as to ſuffer a new wrong, rather then to reuenge an old, through hatred and ill will. To this purpoſe Paul ſaith, Rom. 12. 17. Recompence to no man euill for euill, which is to be ouercome of euill, verſe 21. but ouercome euill with goodneſſe, darkeneſſe with light, corruption with grace; if it be poſſible, haue peace with all men. How is that? Auenge not, verſe 19. but if thine enemy hunger, giue him meate, and if he thirſt, giue him drinke▪ ſo ſhalt thou heape coales of fire vpon his head: to wit, either winne him with thy benefits, or his owne conſcience ſhall witneſſe againſt him, that the fire of Gods wrath hangeth ouer his head, who will not ſuffer wickedneſſe to goe vnpuniſhed▪ Which terrour of his conſcience thou muſt not deſire, nor reioyce at in way of reuenge, or for eaſe of thine owne ſtomacke, leaſt God turne his wrath from him vnto thee, but rather pitty him, yet ſo as God might haue the glory. Therefore by turning of the cheeke, is not meant that a man ſhould make himſelfe a prey to contentious men▪ malapert, and violent perſons, and a voluntary obiect of their cruell contempt: but to be of ſuch moderation and equity, as to pacifie and winne them with ſufferance, goodneſſe, kindneſſe, or what good meanes ſanctified reaſon can deuiſe, not to be incenſed with hatred, to oppoſe and wracke them, and ſo be ouercome of Sathan by theſe his inſtruments, both to bring the Goſpell into

ſlander &amp; hatred, &amp; to fall into the ſame condemnation with them. Wherefore we are to pray for the conuerſion of them, and Gods protection of vs, not to contend with them in their kind, that by the vertues of the ſpirit appearing forth in vs, the corruption of nature, &amp; malice of Satan in them may be by their owne conſciences condemned. But all this infringeth not the law of nature, which is to kill rather then to be killed, without the lawfull courſe of ciuill iuſtice, nor yet diſanulleth the politike law, which God hath ordained to protect the iuſt, to bridle the violent, and to reforme the vitious and iniurious. Let vs take heed how we cauill, and ſophiſticate the ſimplicity of the Scriptures.
               All this is explained, verſe 44. Loue your enemies: Your enemies; not Gods enemies, which we are to hate, yet to take heede of raſh iudgement: For though the cauſe or fact be hatefull, yet that argueth not ſimply hatred of the perſon. Wherefore loue them, that is, deſire their conuerſion, not their confuſion; for we know not whether they be in Gods election, but charity hopeth the beſt. Whom God hath caſt off, and who haue caſt off God, we muſt caſt off, leſt wee be partakers with Gods enemies; therefore we muſt not bid an obſtinate heretike God-ſpeed. Neither would the diſciples haue eaten bread with Iudas, if they had knowne his plot of treachery, but Chriſt reuealed him not: And Paul ſaith, haue no fellowſhip with the vnfruitfull workes of darkenes. If a man can haue no fellowſhip with their workes, neither with their perſons, ſpecially ſuch perſons, as on the one ſide make a mocke of all good edification, and on the other ſide, are ſtrong corrupters. For what could Satan incarnate and in ſubiection to the ciuill power doe more? To conclude; We muſt doe good to our enemies willingly, reſiſt their euils peaceably, make the cauſe Gods, not our owne, contend with them lawfully, liue among them warily, commit the vengeance to God, caſt no ſtumbling blocks before them, but rather offer meanes, and further their conuerſion, that they may glorifie God in the day of viſitation, that is, when it ſhal pleaſe God to open their eyes to ſee, and diſcerne the truth. To conclude. Loue and hatred in priuate perſons, warres and

peace in publike ſtates, haue alwayes beene, and muſt be to the end. For throughout all nature there is an oppoſition of one thing to another, as well diſcord as concord, tares as wheat, becauſe God will be glorified as well by iudgement as by mercy. For in both he delighteth, Ier. 9. 24. All theſe things and times are out of our power, and fall out by the determinate counſell of God. As we receiue all temporall benefits from the hand of God, not what, not how much, not by what meanes we liſt, ſo likewiſe we take opportunities for all things from his hand alſo. For he is all hand, holding and giuing all things, what, to whom, how, when hee will, Iam. 4. 13. 14. 15. We purpoſe, but know not what ſhall be, wherefore we muſt ſay, if the Lord will, Prou. 27. 1. And Ieremy ſaith, O Lord, the way of man is not in himſelfe.

                  What hath he that worketh, in that wherein hee laboureth?
               
               A Concluſion of the principall argument, that a man hath no profit of all his labours, Chap. 1. 3. The Propoſition or Maior is, Chap. 3. 1. The Reaſon is framed thus:
               If there be a time to euery thing▪ and to euery purpoſe vnder the Sunne, then a man hath no profit of all his labours, ſeeing that all things depend on the inſtability of times.
               But the Antecedent, or former part of the reaſon is true, as I haue already proued by many examples, of things naturall, neceſſary, voluntary.
               Therefore the conſequent or latter part is true alſo, namely he that ſtudyeth, endeauoureth; worketh, hath no profit in all his labours.
               For the beginning, proceeding, finiſhing, euent, depend all on vncertainties. And euen in that he knoweth not what ſhall become of his labours, who ſhall haue the benefit, whether a wiſe-man or a foole, his friend, or his foe, doth as much afflict the minde, as to be croſt in the beginning and proceeding of his workes by infortunate caſualties; what greater vanity and griefe is there then for a man vpon the reueiw of his labours to ſay, Opera, &amp; impenſa perijt. All is loſt?

                  I haue ſeene the trauell which God hath ginen to the ſonnes of men, to be exerciſed in it.
               
               A Commoration, amplifying this concluſion to verſe 16. In this verſe he ſetteth downe the cauſe of this vanitie of mans labour, and that is the iudgement of God vpon his pride. For thus hath God alwayes auenged the ambition, and curioſity of mans heart, that he ſhould intangle himſelfe in infinite buſineſſes, perplexe his minde with endleſſe cares, ſpend all his dayes in troubles, griefe, anger, ſorrow, ſickneſſe and till the day of death to be forgetfull of death, and vnmindfull of the euent of his toyle. But that hoped contentation of mind, which he dreameth of, ſhall he neuer obtaine, and if he doe obtaine it, it ſhall haue matter ſtill of greater miſery in it. The Iſraelites murmuring for fleſh in the Wilderneſſe had their deſires to the full, but the fulneſſe of their deſire, was their deſtruction, Num. 11. 32. 33. And our Sauiour ſaith, Matth. 6. Verely, they haue their reward. So that this ſuppoſed contentation, of allſo earneſtly laboured for, is in the poſſeſſion thereof, but the earneſt-penny of euerlaſting miſery. What profit then hath he that worketh, in that wherein hee laboureth? How much better were it to ſubmit himſelfe to the prouidence of God, and ſuffer himſelfe to be gouerned by his lawes? This verſe is an expoſition of the 13. verſe of the firſt Chapter.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 11. 
                  He hath made euery thing beautifull in his time: alſo he hath ſet the world in their heart, ſo that none can find
                        •
                      out the worke that God maketh from the beginning to the end.
               
               THe vnprofitable vanity of mans labour is illuſtrated by an Antitheſis, or contrariety of the moſt wiſe worke of Gods prouidence. God by the worke of his power and wiſedome, hath made and ſet all things in comely order, and by the word of his prouidence he gouerneth and adminiſtreth all things, hauing prefined aforehand a conuenient and beautifull opportunity for euery thing. But whereas the imaginations

of mans heart, are onely euill, his pride is ſuch, that he would be a god, and equall with God, Gen. 3. 5. 6. and that by working out an heauen, a felicitie, and a glory in the world to himſelfe; therefore hath God laid a iudgement vpon his impatience, ambition, curioſity; namely, a preſumptuous and fooliſh dotage, to imagine that he is able to comprehend the whole courſe of times paſt, and to come, and thereafter to plot his endeuours to attaine a poſſibilitie of his own proiects, to auoyd all oppoſite accidents, and to remoue all croſſe occurrences; yet is hee ſo farre from the knowledge of that moſt wiſe, iuſt, conuenient, and ſecret adminiſtration or aeconomie of God, that he cannot rightly conceiue of one worke of Gods prouidence, how it is begun, how it proceedeth, how it is finiſhed, by what meanes, turnings, and returnings it is effected. Yea, the wayes of God are paſt finding out. Yet this is the madneſſe of thoſe, whom we call vnderſtanding, wiſe, prudent, and politicke men, to frame a world in, and according to their owne hearts, as if they were gods, or rather Gods Apes, that is, firſt, to purpoſe with themſelues what they will haue, and what they will be, and then by their wiſdome, and ſtrength, to turne all the world, and euery thing about to this point, to winde and wring in euery man, and euery matter by craft or violence, by feare, by flattery, by ſimulation, diſſimulation, to make in the end a generall concurrence or confluence of all ſtreames into this Ocean. This impoſſibility is that, wherabout he beateth his braines, vexeth his minde, diſquieteth his heart, toyleth his body, depriueth himſelfe of all ioy, and comfortable reſt all the daies of his life. But what is the profit of his wiſedome and labour in the laſt end? Euen to make himſelfe a foole, aby-word, a ſpectacle of follie. Parturiunt montes, exit ridiculus mus. The maine end of all, is but a bable like the towre of a Babel, a new nothing. It is like that great ſenceleſſe lumpe of earth that Nabuchadnezzar ſet vp, yea, it is like that huge braineworke, the Synagogue of the Romiſh beaſt.
               It may be obiected, How can euill things be ſaid to be beautifull? and what times hath God ordained for wickedneſſe? I anſwere, euill things in the kinds and natures thereof,

as they proceed from the deuill, and the venemous fountaine of mans heart, are loathſome and vgly: but euill things in their times as God vſeth them, are beautifull, neceſſary, and comely, namely, as they are ſent as iuſt and due puniſhments from God, as executions of wrath and vengeance for the wickedneſſe of the world, and tryall of the faith, and patience of his ſeruants. In time of peace there is vnthankfulneſſe, pride, contempt of God, abuſing of his creatures to riot and exceſſe; then the ſword, famine, warres, peſtilence and manifold miſeries, are in that reſpect beautifull in their time. Many men get their goods by couetouſneſſe, racking, oppreſſion, vniuſt dealing, extortion, bribery, deceit, vſury, vnmercifulneſſe to the poore, purloyning, and withholding of the Leuites wages. Now it is a iuſt reuenge, and beautifull that a Ruffian and dingthrift riſe vp, and riotouſly waſte all. Dauid committed adultery with Bathſheba, and ſlew her huſband; This diſpleaſed the Lord, 2 Sam. 12. Therefore ſhall the ſword neuer depart from his houſe, he will raiſe euill againſt him out of his owne houſe, and take his wiues before his eyes, and giue them vnto his neighbour, &amp;c. So Amnon defiled his ſiſter Thamar, and Abſolon in reuenge ſlew him. Abſolon rebelled againſt his father, and by the counſell of Achitophell committed inceſt with his wiues, &amp;c. Afterwards Achitophell hanged himſelfe, and Abſolon was ſlaine by Ioab, (and he was executed by Solomon.) Theſe adulteries, murthers, inceſts, rebellions, treaſons are in their kindes abominable, but as they are iudgements of God, beautifull. He turneth all euill things to the good of his Elect, and his owne glory as well in executing Iuſtice, as ſhewing mercy.

                  Remedies of vanities IN theſe verſes he gathereth and concludeth from the former obſeruations and conſiderations, the right vſe of all

worldly things, for a remedy or mitigation of the vanities, as he did, Chap. 2. 24. which he confirmeth, firſt, by the teſtimony of his owne knowledge; ſecondly, by the efficient cauſe. Seeing that it is the propertie of fooles to weary themſelues about vaine contriuing, and diſpoſing of things according to their inordinate deſires, let the wiſe man be better aduiſed, and learne by the example of Gods dealing with them, how to apply himſelfe both to get and ſpend; namely, with a contented mind, and quiet heart. Let him learne to reioyce, and cheere his body in the comfortable and ſober vſe thereof, and to giue part to the poore. Epheſ. 4 28. and to the Church, 1 Cor. 9. 14. To this tranquility of minde Dauid exhorteth, Pſal. 37. 3. Hope in the Lord, and be doing good, dwell in the land, and verily thou ſhalt be fed. Relye on Gods prouidence, and leane not to thine owne wiſedome, as Solomon ſaith: This is all the good, that all our wiſedome and trauell can produce out of theſe earthly things, and the onely true profit that can be made of them. But this conſideration can no man fetch out of his owne braine: If he doe apprehend it, yet his memory cannot long hold it. And if hee doe remember it, yet his fooliſh heart cannot practiſe it, becauſe wits (not ſeaſoned with grace) muſt be working. It is therefore the gift of God.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 14. 
                  I know that whatſoeuer God doth, it ſhall be for euer: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doth it that men ſhould feare before him.
               
               A Confirmation of contentation, and tranquility in the right and good vſe of things, drawne from the ſtedfaſtneſſe of Gods workes, which are vnalterable. It is meere madneſſe, either to think that the cauſes of things, and their proceedings are in our power, or that the euents of our counſels ſhall be according to our deſignements, or yet to vexe our ſelues at all, if the ſucceſſe be not anſwerable according to our expectation. For let a mortall man deuiſe, aduiſe, and plot what he will, and as he will, yet can hee neuer diſanull, or any whit alter the decree of God, for the preparations are

of the heart, ſaith Solomon, but the anſwere of the tongue is of the Lord, and ſo is the worke of the hands. Yea, it is a great impietie for a man to thinke that he can by his power or free-will, either adde, or detract from the decree of God, or turne aſide any part of his counſell: For euen that which a man hath done by his free-will, was originally from the vnchangeable decree of Gods will, Act. 4. 28. From whence proceeded euill but from the negation of election and giff of perſeuerance? The ordering and diſpoſing whereof, God hath decreed according to the pleaſure of his will, which is a depth vnſearchable, vncomprehenſible. But wee know this, that he doth all out of the loue of himſelfe, and to the glory of himſelfe: And ſo is he all in all. All this he confirmes by the teſtimony of his owne knowledge.
               Moreouer, the vnchangeableneſſe of Gods prouidence, is amplified by the end thereof. That men might feare before him. That men ſeeing their owne ignorance, weakeneſſe, fooliſhneſſe, in the diuine additions, detractions, changings and diſa

                  ulling of their purpoſes and deſignes on the one ſide; and all things ſwayed by an ouer ruling power on the other ſide; might be brought euen whether they will or no, into his preſence; namely to acknowledge, reuerence, and to depend on him only, and humble themſelues to his ordinance, being reuoked from their owne ambition and pride, by the vnhappy ſucceſſe of their wiſeſt, and ſureſt courſes. This is that which Moſes ſo laboureth in the repetition of the law to imprint in the minds of the Iſraelites. Deut. 8. 2. 3.

               A Confirmation of the ſtability of Gods purpoſes or workes of his prouidence, as before, Chap. 1. 9. As the heauens, windes, riuers, haue their conſtant courſes, and recourſes by perpetuall motion; euen ſo God hath prouided in his moſt wiſe adminiſtration of mans affaires alſo, that one thing ſhould ſucceed another, according to the inſtability of times, and returne againe by their courſes, euen in their circuits,

in kinde and nature, according to the reſtleſſe reuolution of time. So that whatſoeuer hath beene in old time, is now at this preſent: and whatſoeuer is gone and paſt, ſhall God cauſe to returne againe. Therefore, as times, ſo are all things in time in the hands of God, and as all things come from his hand in their conuenient ſeaſons, ſo againe they returne into his hand, as the ſeede is caſt out of the hand of the ſower, and returneth againe into the hand of the ſower, circularly for euer.

                  SOlomon hath heretofore declared in generall the vanity of mans wiſedome and prouidence, by peculiar obſeruation and experience: now hee commeth particularly to declare the vanities, and vexations, vncertainty, and inſtability of all worldly things, by his diligent obſeruation of outward examples in ciuill ſtate, or common life. All which tend ſtill to the ſame end, to wit, that a man can finde no perpetual courſe of proſperity in any worldly ſtate, nor any thing in any ſtate wherein to content his minde, and reſt his heart, but that all things are full of vanity and vexation, and ſo conſequently he muſt reſt on God onely. Of theſe vanities and euils, ſome proceede from the malice of others, or doe outwardly come to a man, as thoſe examples following doe manifeſt.

Euery man and eſtate is ſubiect to troubles, and contentions, cauſed partly through want of wiſedome and prouidence to preuent euils, partly by the violence of cruell and mercileſſe men, partly through the vnquietneſſe of humorous, and diſtempered perſons, partly through many vnauoydable chances. Howſoeuer, wheate and tares, Gods flocke and euill beaſts, muſt liue together in ciuill ſtate during the time of this life. Now whereas in this mixture, innumerable controuerſies and wrongs ariſe, good lawes are eſtabliſhed for

the deciding of the one, and reforming of the other, that men might liue happily, by the preſeruation of peace, and iuſtice. And for the making, and execution of the ſame lawes, are Magiſtrates ordained. But I ſaw that wrong reigned in the place of iudgement, as well as any where elſe, and that publike authority was made but a cloake, yea, a defence of publike iniuſtice, whereof the Scriptures affoord vs many examples. Here is vanity, for no certaine remedy can be found here, but rather greateſt euils oft times proceede from hence.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 17. 
                  I ſaid in mine heart, God ſhall iudge the righteous, and the wicked: for there is a time there, for euery purpoſe, and for euery worke.
               
               A Confirmation of vanity, increaſed by the place of iudgement, (wherein notwithſtanding to the faithfull that waite on God, there is matter of comfort.) Becauſe no remedy is here to be had, and that iudgement proceedeth not forth, but is turned into gall and wormewood, (for theſe perſons being armed with publike authority, thinke to vſe the Lawes at their pleaſure, without puniſhment) therefore the oppreſſed muſt appeale to the iuſt Iudge, and vnpartiall auenger of euery wrong. But God doth not alwayes ſmite ſinners in the act of ſinne, but commonly when they haue forgotten, and are in greateſt ſecurity; as Amnon had the ſtab, when his heart was merry with wine; Antiochus when he was in the height of his pride; Alexander and Herod, when they tooke vpon them to be gods; Iulius Caeſar when he was in the Senate; Ieruſalem about forty yeeres after Chriſts reſurrection, when all was forgotten. Therefore a man muſt ſtay Gods leiſure: For the Lord will come, and not tarry, he will be a ſwift witneſſe, and auenger of wrongs. All muſt be conuented before his iudgement ſeate, 2 Cor. 5. 10. and render an account of euery idle word, much more of euill deeds. All is vanity.
               
                  For there is a time there for euery purpoſe, and for euery worke. This word, [there] as I thinke, hath relation to Gods iudgement

ſeate, as if hee ſhould ſay, vniuſt Magiſtrates haue a time by the patience, and long-ſuffering of God, to fulfill their bloud-thirſty, and gold-thirſty luſts: but another time ſhall ſucceede that, when the wronger and wronged, the iuſt and vniuſt▪ ſhall giue vp an account, and be doomed according to their workes, to liue or die for euer: And euen then when they ſit vpon the iudgement ſeate, is God preſent to take notice of their corrupt and partiall dealings, to cenſure them, and to giue ſentence vpon their ſentence; yea, and to beginne the execution of his ſentence vpon them by vntimely death, diſgrace, baniſhment, remorſe of conſcience, &amp;c. Therefore they that haue authority and power to doe what they will, and to haue what they will, and thoſe that are ſtrengthened by authority in their luſts, ſhall obtaine no profit▪ nor quietneſſe of heart thereby. This alſo is vanity, and vexation to them, aſwell as ſuffering wrong to the other.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 18. 
                  I ſaid in my heart concerning the eſtate of the ſonnes of men, that God might manifeſt them, and that they might ſee that they themſelues are beaſts.
               
               A Confirmation of the former. I ſaid in my heart concerning the ſtate, or condition of the ſonnes of men, that God by iudgement might manifeſt them, or lay them open, (for where no law is, there is no difference, and where no iudgement is, there is as little) and that they might ſee their owne ſhame, namely, themſelues to be beaſts, and that by their beaſtly luſts and affections, chiefly by their cruelty one towards another, in deuouring and preying one vpon another; as fiſhes, birds, and beaſts doe, which want vnderſtanding and reaſon, and ſo know not God, nor themſelues. And though they glorifie themſelues, and are as gods in their owne eyes, and cauſe others to fall downe, and humble themſelues vnto them, whereout they ſucke no ſmall aduantage, yet ſhall they die like men, and come to the ſame end that beaſts doe, yea; they are more miſerable then beaſts, which are not ſubiect to ſinne, nor culpable of iudgement.
               
                  
Or, theſe wordes may be thus interpreted. I ſaid in my heart, concerning the order of the ſonnes of men, that God had giuen them dignity, and to ſee to they are as beaſts to themſelues. For this word Dibrah, ſignifieth order, Pſal. 110. 4. and Barar ſignifieth to chuſe, to purge, to declare, whereof commeth Berurim, choyce men ſet vp in dignity, namely, Princes, Rulers, Gouernours, Officers ordained of God, for peaceable, honeſt, and happy life, which abuſing themſelues and their places, are to mans reaſon as but ſtronger, and more ſubtile beaſts, preying vpon the weaker and more ſimple &amp; harmeleſſe.
               Againe, they may be tranſlated thus, that they might cleere, or iuſtifie God, and ſee that they themſelues are beaſts; and therefore vanity it ſelfe, euen out of meaſure vaine. Laſtly, thus, that God had purged them, id eſt, created them pure, holy, and righteous, in his owne image, in the beginning, yet to ſee to, in this ſtate of degeneration or corruption, they are in themſelues as beaſts, accordingly as he ſaith, Chap. 7. 31. God hath made man righteous, but they haue ſought out many inuentions: and Pſal. 49. 20. Man that is in honour, and vnderſtandeth not, is like the beaſts that periſh. Which of theſe interpretations is the moſt genuine and naturall, I leaue to euery mans iudgement.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 19. 
                  For that which befalleth the ſonnes of men, befalleth beaſts; euen one thing befalleth them all: as the one dyeth, ſo dyeth the other; yea, they haue all one breath, ſo that a man hath no preheminence aboue a beaſt: for all is vanity.
               
               THe apt coherence of theſe three verſes following with the former, intimate, that the laſt interpretation is the moſt proper. For they are a reaſon prouing the corruption, vanity, vileneſſe, and miſery of proud man, by comparing him to beaſts, whoſe frailety, corruption, or vanity, is Gods iudgement vpon man. In them may hee behold his ſinne, and his corporall puniſhments for ſinne before his eyes, if otherwiſe he be inſenſible, which are the fore-runners, and beginning of eternal torments; and ſenceleſneſſe is a iudgement

of God vpon the reprobate. This like condition of man and beaſt, to carnall iudgement, is ſet downe in theſe three verſes; which ſimilitude or likeneſſe made the Epicures to thinke that the eſtate and condition of them both, was all one; and conſequently, that to eate, drinke, and play, was the chiefe good, or onely felicity of man. For wee ſee by daily experience, that man and beaſt are ſubiect to the like caſualties and misfortunes, how men vexe, deuoure, lye in waite, inſnare, kill, &amp;c. one another, as beaſts doe, how they die, as beaſts doe, hauing the ſame cauſes of corruption in them with beaſts. They haue the ſame breath whereby they liue, the ſame ſpirit whereby they moue, the ſame ſenſes, the ſame inward and outward members, and in bodily ſhape many beaſts come neere vnto him, and he is ſubiect to deformities, and all infirmities in his kinde, as much, and more then they. So that in outward ſtate hee hath no preheminence aboue the beaſt. For he cannot longer vſe the things of this World, nor carry any thing away with him more then the beaſt doth. The reaſon is, becauſe all is vanity. Therefore there is no difference.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 20. 
                  All goe vnto one place, all are of the duſt, and all turne to duſt againe.
               
               A Commoration. All goe to one place, that is, both men and beaſt are diſſolued againe into their elements. For God created all things of the duſt, and all turne to duſt againe. There is the ſame matter of man, and beaſt. Some thinke that beaſt was made of the earth, and man of the duſt of the earth, to wit, either of mire, or elſe of the duſt, that lyeth on the ſur-face of the earth. But that is an idle contention. For mire, and duſt, and earth, are all one, and the ſame in eſſence or ſubſtance. When the raine falleth on the earth, it is mire, when the Sunne extracteth the moiſture out of it, it is duſt. So that the whole earth is nothing but duſt, or mire, whether you will. Therefore man was not made of baſer matter then beaſt, as ſome ſay, but rather of better: For Adam ſignifieth red earth, or red duſt, or red mire. All

is one without any difference. And Solomon ſaith here, all are of the duſt, or earth, which by the figure Synecdoche ſignifieth all the elements, whereof earth in earthly things is predominant, and water in the creatures thereof. No element is ſimple, or pure, but it hath a mixture of other elements alſo to be the Chaos or nurſe of their ſundry creatures, which in their purity they could not be. So that earthly things are moſt earth, eſpecially, the more particular or ſimpler creatures, as mettals, ſtones, trees, &amp;c. Yet water, ayre, and fire alſo, with which the element of earth is mixed: By vertue of which mixture, man and beaſt are made of the other elements as well as of the earth.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 21. 
                  Who knoweth the ſpirit of man that goeth vpward, and the ſpirit of a beaſt that goeth downe-ward to the earth?
               
               A Continuance of the commoration, figured by the preuention of an obiection, thus. There is great difference betweene man, and beaſt: For mans brutall nature and ſpirit is but the plaſme or veſſell of his ſoule, which is not compound, or mixed with it, but onely vnited to it. Therefore when this fraile veſſell is broken or diſſolued, the immortall ſpirit or ſoule aſcendeth to God that gaue it, and the veſſell againe is abſumed into the elements whereof it was formed. But the ſpirit of a beaſt is nothing but the quinteſſence, the pureſt and prime of his body, or his life, which conſiſteth in the harmony or vnion of the elements, and ſo not being another eſſence ſeparable from the body, it dyeth with the body. Anſ. This is indeed the holy and diuine truth, but now ſpeaking of the worldly, outward, and miſerable ſtate of man, as it appeareth to humaine ſenſes and reaſon, who can by any ſigne or token, or skill of Anatomy find out any differing wayes of theſe ſpirits? What man can ſhew me the aſcending of mans ſpirit into heauen, or the deſcending of the beaſts ſpirit into the earth; namely, the diſperſing thereof into the elements? If a man ſay, that the ſpirit of man aſcends vpwards into the firmament, how can he let me ſee that? but if it doe, then doth the beaſts ſo alſo. For the firmament is but the

quinteſſence or prime of the elements, as the ſpirit is of the body, according to Plato. And be it that by humaine reaſon, a man may eaſily demonſtrate the immortality of the ſoule, as the learned heathen haue all done, yet what is that to the outward worldly ſtate of man liuing? Man whiles hee is man, (and of man we onely ſpeake, not of ſpirits) is no better then beaſt. So that to conclude; Seeing that it is with man, as with beaſt, there is no profit, no contentment, no reſt, no durable proſperity, no happineſſe at all in this curſed, confuſed, brutall world, but all is vanity.

                  Wherefore I perceiue that there is nothing better, then that a man ſhould reioyce in his owne workes: for that is his portion; for who ſhall bring him to ſee what ſhall be after him?
               
               A Concluſion of the right conſideration, regard, and vſe of worldly things inferred as before, ver. 12. And Chap. 2. 24. Seeing that there is nothing but vanity and miſerie, I perceiued that it was but vanity and folly to ſeeke for any happineſſe in any worldly ſtate. And that it was the point of true and ſolide wiſdome for a man to reioyce his heart in the honeſt getting, comfortable vſing, and prudent diſpoſing of things put into his hand by the prouidence of God, while it is his, euen in his hands. For this is a mans portion, yea, all the good that can be found in them, and by them. For who can bring a man to ſee what ſhall be after him? Chap. 2. 18. 19. The knowledge of after-times belongeth to God onely, and when we are gone, then is all out of our hands, and none of ours, but left to Gods diſpoſing, which how God vſeth and beſtoweth, or what good is done therewith, is no thankes, no reward to vs. Therefore it is but folly for a man to depriue himſelfe of the benefit of his workes, and to diſquiet his heart and minde in vaine, with prouiding and plotting for after-times; namely, for his poſterity, whereof hee hath no certainty. What greater folly is there, then for a man to torment his body, vexe his ſpirit, torture his conſcience, loſe his ſoule, for thoſe that come after him, which either ſhall be wreſted from their goods, or die preſently after him, or waſtfully

ſpend them, working out their damnation in the prodigall ſpending, as he did in the couetous getting. But if they doe enioy them, and doe good with them, yet is that nothing to him that is now in torment. For it is not by vertue of the goods gotten, and left by him, but of Gods grace, and that doth good as well without thoſe goods, as with them. For it is not how much we doe, but how well, not what, but what God accepteth. For all is his owne, wee can doe nothing for him, nor giue any thing to him.

                  So I returned, and conſidered all the oppreſſions that are done vnder the Sunne; and behold the teares of ſuch as were▪ oppreſſed, and they had no Comforter: and on the ſide of their oppreſſours there was power, but they had no Comforter. II. Example of vanities in outward things.
                  
               
               
                  A Second example of corruption in ciuill ſtate, is of the oppreſſed. This is the ſecond example of vanities, obſerued in outward things, ſuch things as outwardly come to a man. Theſe words haue dependance on verſe 16. chap. 3. There he ſhewed how vanity was increaſed by corruption in place of Iudgement and Iuſtice; here hee ſheweth how vanity is increaſed by manifold oppreſſions euery where; whereby almoſt euery man of wit and wealth oppreſſeth, treadeth on, inſnareth and vexeth the inferiour and weaker, after the manner of beaſts. And behold, A graphicall or liuely deſcription of oppreſſions in all ages, and among all ſorts of men, continuall and common. They are deſcribed
               Firſt, by the greatneſſe thereof. They are ſuch as cauſed not onely griefe and complaining, but alſo teares.
               Secondly, they are amplyfied by their want of remedy, the incompaſſionateneſſe of people, which is the ſinne of Sodome. They had no Comforter. There was none to deliuer

                  
                     Eſay 59. 16. them, none to take their parts, none to counſell them, but euery one rather treading on him that falleth, after the manner of brute beaſts.
               Thirdly, by the perſons oppreſſing, which were men of authority and power, that had the law in their owne hands.
               Fourthly, by the incompaſſionatenes of other great men, which were mercileſſe, cruell, and hard-hearted, aboue the common ſort of rude people, as Ierem. 5. 26. 27. 28. complaineth. Which perſons though they were able to remedy wrongs, yet they rather approued the ſame, as Herod did Pilates, and Pilate in ſome ſort did the Prieſts and Phariſes: So farre were they from affording any comfort to the diſtreſſed. The whole verſe laboureth of a gradation.
            
            
               Verſe 2.
               Wherefore I praiſed the dead, which are already dead, more then the liuing, which are yet aliue.

                  Yea, better is be then both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not ſeene the euill worke that is done vnder the Sun.
               
               AN amplification. He amplifieth theſe grieuous euils both of the oppreſſours, and the oppreſſed, by a compariſon from the Leſſe to the Greater. They that are dead, hauing left their wiues and children, lands and goods behind them, which is a great cauſe of mourning, and teares as contrarily life is ioy; are notwithſtanding more happy then theſe that are liuing, and inioy the priuiledges of life. This compariſon is figured by a R

                     cation, whereby he recalleth backe the former compariſon as not ſufficient to illuſtrate the vanities and miſeries of life, and bringeth in another more fit to expreſſe the greatneſſe thereof. Yea, rather the condition of him that is not yet borne, is better then they both, becauſe he hath not felt nor ſeene the calamities of the world. Better it is not to be at all, then to be in miſery. What profit then hath a man of all the labour that he taketh vnder the Sunne? Mundus eſt inuolucrum, 
                        •

                  Againe, I conſidered all trauell, and euery right worke, that for this a man is enuyed of his neighbour: this is alſo vanity and vexation of ſpirit.
               
               
                  III. Example of vanity in outward things A Third example of vanities, outwardly incident to man, is enuy, not actiue but paſſiue. By enuy alſo is vanity greatly increaſed. I conſidered all the honeſt and moderate labour of him that rightly earned his liuing, without couetouſneſſe and wrong▪ who depriued not his ſoule of comfort by hoarding them vp, but reioyced in the work of his hands, and extended the fruits of his labours to others alſo. But euen this man was enuyed of his neighbour, becauſe he was good, and did good. Yea, euen they that were pertakers of the benefit of his labours with him, reioyced at his fall. Wherefore did Cain hate his brother? euen becauſe his brothers deeds were good, and his owne euill. Wherefore ſhould Labans houſe enuy Iacob, through whoſe faithfulnes all things proſpered well with them? yet ſo it was and is. Wherfore doth the righteous man make himſelfe a prey? Iſa. 59. 15. Becauſe he ſpeaketh the truth, and departeth from euill. Why did the ſonnes of Iacob, enuy their brother Ioſeph? becauſe their father loued him. What occaſioned Iſmael to mocke Iſaac? Gen. 21. 9. Euen becauſe God had bleſſed him. And Amos ſaith, Chap. 5. 10. Hee that rebuketh in the gate is hated, and he is abhorred that ſpeaketh vprightly. Why was our Sauiour Chriſt hated, perſecuted, crucified? becauſe he was true, holy, righteous, the holy one, and the iuſt. Becauſe hee was good, and his goodneſſe extended wholly to others. For in the world he had no prerogatiues of the world, all was theirs, and their childrens, he tooke nothing, but gaue himſelfe for them; he was 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , full of loue and fauour to man, whatſoeuer he was it was for mans good. Yet in this he could not be pardoned, but muſt be put to ſhame and contempt with the greateſt malefactors. All this argueth the great vanity of this life.

                  Better is an handfull with quietneſſe, then both the hands full with trauell, and vexation of ſpirit.
               
               
                  I. Example of inward euils, is ſloathfulneſſe. THeſe vanities or euils hereafter following, proceed from a mans ſelfe, from within him, whereof there be three examples following in this Chapter, to wit, of the ſloathſull, the niggard, and the will-full, which heape miſeries vpon themſelues by their owne folly.
               The firſt example is of ſloathfulneſſe, whereby much vanity is increaſed, whereof much wickedneſſe and miſery proceedeth. The ſluggard is graphically depeinted forth by an hypotipoſis, or liuely deſcription, by his generall, and effects. in this verſe. The foole. The idle perſon is firſt deſcribed by his generall, he is a foole, or wicked perſon, one of that ranke that wanteth wiſedome and vnderſtanding. For he deſpiſeth the decree and ordinance of God. Gen. 3. 19. In the ſweat of thy face ſhalt thou get thy liuing. Againe, he bringeth himſelfe, into contempt, baſe account, and hatred, by wilfull pouerty. Moreouer, he bringeth himſelfe into bondage and ſlauery, when he is inforſt to run into debt, and to ſubmit himſelfe to the vices, and euill diſpoſitions, whatſoeuer they 
                     •
                  e▪ of other men, to pleaſe them, for reliefe, and ſo to be the ſeruant of other mens corruptions, a ſonne of Belial. Finally, he ſetteth open the gap to infinite euils very hardly to be auoyded, as lying, diſſembling, flattering, humouring, grudging, enuying, ſtealing, robbing, murthering, impriſonment, &amp;c.
               
                  The foole foldeth his hands together. Secondly, he is deſcribed by his deedes, or geſtures, which are priuatiues or prauatiues rather, ſignifying not any labour, or preparation to labour, but a preparation to more reſt and eaſe, which is a priuation of labour. Hee foldeth his hands. Hee ſitteth or lyeth now ſtretching, now enwrapping his armes one within another, now yawning to eaſe himſelfe a little, when through want of motion, the blood drawing more inwardly thickneth, leauing the outward limmes more riged and ſtiffe, and ſetleth

about the heart. Now he hangeth the chin into the boſome, becauſe his lazineſſe wil not rouze vp his dull ſpirits, and diſperſe his cold and clottered bloud. Now hee looketh vpward, gaping with open mouth, becauſe he will not ſtretch a little the ſinewes of his throate and chapps, as a man doth that looketh vpwards with his lippes ſhut; therefore this idle foole draweth his breath in at his mouth moſt commonly, for the rheume aſcending into his head, for want of moderate exerciſe, and diſcending into his noſe, hindereth the eaſie paſſage of his breath, that hee cannot ſo fully enioy his pleaſant ſleepe. And for recreation ſake, when he is weary with ſleeping on the one ſide, he turneth on the other, as the gate doth on the hookes, Prou. 26. 14.
               Againe, He foldeth his hands together. As others vnfold their hands, armes, knees, to labour; ſo he infoldeth or crudleth his limbes together to ſleepe, as euery kinde of creature doth. Working and walking, doe moſt exerciſe the body, ſtanding leſſe, leaning leſſe then that, ſitting leſſe, and lying leſſe then that, but the infolding of the members giue greateſt reſt, and ſecurity. For then the blood is kept more temperate, hee coucheth in a leſſe roome, and is ſooner vp, if any euill outwardly aſſaile him. In heat the ſluggard diſplayeth abroad his limbes, in cold he gathereth them on an heape. Theſe drowſie fooles liue by inſtinct of corrupt nature, like beaſts. As for prodigall, ſtirring, liuely, and witty fooles, they more reſemble the Diuell. They are not ſnailes, but waſpes, and hornets. They are idle alſo, for either they liue in no profeſſion or calling, or elſe take no paines in their profeſſion. And of them is this text alſo vnderſtood.
               
                  And eateth vp his owne fleſh. What other euils ſoeuer hee may auoide, yet this is a ſure puniſhment laid on ſluggiſhneſſe, that it pineth, and conſumeth the body, as it waſteth the outward ſtate. For by labour muſt a man liue, therefore by idleneſſe ſhall he deſtroy himſelfe. For idleneſſe is a cauſe of many diſeaſes, when the dregges of the humours are not moued, nor ſuperfluities evaporated by agitation, and ſweat▪ Drowſineſſe breedeth droſſineſſe, and vaine pleaſures, which

is another kinde of idleneſſe, bringeth pouerty and paine. Againe, he eateth vp his owne fleſh with griefe, enuie, couetouſneſſe. Griefe flayeth him, Prou. 21. 25. Enuie and couetouſneſſe conſume the fleſh, and drye the bones. Many ſluggards are couetous and greedy, yet proud, and idle, enuying the plenty of thoſe that labour, and ſpeake euill of them. There are abundance of ſuch like now a dayes.

                  Better is an handfull with quietneſſe, &amp;c. Thirdly, the ſluggard is here deſcribed by his inward effects, or vaine imaginations of his fooliſh heart, deſtitute of iudgement, vttered by the tongue, whereby he excuſeth, maintaineth, and confirmeth himſelfe in his idleneſſe. For a foole wanteth not his reaſons, yea, the ſluggard is wiſer in his owne conceit, then ſeauen men that can render a reaſon; Prou. 26. 16. But his reaſons are grounded on his luſt, and according to his luſt, for that is his law. Better it is to haue an handfull with quietneſſe, then both hands full with trauell &amp; vexation of ſpirit. As if he ſhould ſay, it is better for a man to content himſelfe with a little with reſt, then to toyle himſelfe as the drudge doth, carking and caring night and day hee cannot tell for whom. What ſhould a man doe, but eate and drinke, and play, and be merry, and take his naturall reſt? A man cannot tell how long hee ſhall liue, wherefore then ſhould hee make a beaſt of himſelfe? He were as good ſpend his goods himſelfe, as let another ſpend them. A man may labour all his life to gather goods for his children, and they may hap to be rather the worſe, then better for them. For as he hath freed them from care to get them, ſo will they but care how to waſte them. Againe, he that ſtriueth to be rich, ſhall be intangled in manifold buſineſſes, troubles, ſuits, and be diſquieted with a multitude of ſeruants and labourers, which will ſpend it as faſt as they get it. Moreouer, he that hath much, is but a prey to theeues, robbers, and catch-poles, ſo that vnleſſe hee looke well and warily to himſelfe, hee ſhall be inſnared one way or other, and be hated and enuyed. Now for a man to liue, and lie continually thus at defence, is a great vexation, and better were it that his goods were farre enough, then to liue in continuall feare, and drudgery. Therefore I hold it

a wiſer courſe for a man to take his eaſe and pleaſure, to be content with a little, let the World runne which way it will. The ſluggard ſeemes to haue many good ſpeeches oft times, but they proceede from an euill heart, and tend to an euill end. Therefore they are but fooliſhneſſe and wickedneſſe.

                  There is one alone, and there is not a ſecond, yea, he hath neither child nor brother; yet is there no end of all his labour, neither is his eye ſatisfied with riches, neither ſaith hee, for whom doe I labour, and bereaue my ſoule of good? this is alſo vanity, yea, it is a ſore trauell.
               
               A Deſcription of the impure drudge. Firſt, by his ſolitarineſſe, or vnſatiableneſſe: There is one, and not a ſecond. That is to ſay, a ſoliuagant, or ſolitary vagrant, a Deaſtricolous perſon, whoſe heart is fixed in the ground like the roote of a tree, neither a rationall, nor yet a brutall creature, but a plaine vegitable, or locomotiue plant. For diuers of this kinde there be, that are without coniugall affection, or abſtaine from marriage for feare of charge of children and expence. For hee hath not a ſecond, (all liuing creatures are ſociable but he) that is, he hath no companion or fellow, all companies are vaine and euill, and offenſiue to this ſober one, (for ſo is he conceited of himſelfe) and the beſt man with him is

but a talker, a familiar friend is but a diſturber of his thoughts, and hindereth him from his buſineſſe. So fearefull and carefull, diſtruſtfull and deſpairefull is a man, when God leaueth him to himſelfe.
               Secondly, he is deſcribed by his vnreaſonableneſſe, argued by the negation of the impulſiue cauſes of his carefull drudgery. He hath neither child nor brother, kinſman, nor allianee▪
                   at leaſt that ſtandeth in neede to be helped with his goods.
               Thirdly, he is deſcribed by his exceſſe. There is none end of all his labour. Hee is inſatiable, his heart is a bottomeleſſe gulfe that cannot be filled, his deſires are inlarged as hell. All that he looketh vpon with his eyes, he deſireth to haue. And if he had it, yet could not that quench his thirſt, nor ſtay his hungry appetite. He is a Leuiathan, a Sea-dragon, or Whale, that wanteth roome in the maine Ocean.
               Fourthly, he is deſcribed by his ſenſeleſneſſe. forgetfulneſſe, want of diſcourſe, and vſe of reaſon, being in vtter bondage to his luſt, and ſo wholly degenerated into the nature of a beaſt. He neuer ſaith, for whom doe I labour, and bereaue my ſoule of good? Hee is carried euen forward like the plant by his inclination, or like the beaſt by his appetite, like euery irrationall by his inſtinct, neuer reflecting his reaſon vpon himſelfe, or his trauell, to conſider the end thereof, and vſe of worldly things, nor vpon his owne end, though hee ſee death in others, both elder, younger, and equals euery day before his eyes, and euen feele the cauſes, fore-runners, or warnings of death in his owne fleſh and bones ſummoning him to iudgement. This perſon moſt wiſe, moſt good in his owne conceit, commeth farre ſhort of the rich man, Luke 12. who in the fulneſſe of wealth was able to ſay; Now ſoule take thy reſt, thou haſt goods enough, eate▪ drinke, and be merrie. He commeth farre ſhort of Nabal, that ate, and dranke, and was drunke, and ſlept ſoundly vpon it. Nay, he neuer bethinketh himſelfe how all the things of this World ſerue for nothing elſe but meate, drinke, apparell. For he depriueth himſelfe of theſe as neere as may be, and layeth them vp for the wormes, mothes, and canker. This ſeruice is the

euent of his labour, as much as in him lyeth, (for death, not he, putteth others in poſſeſſion and vſe thereof) what other end ſoeuer he confuſedly dreameth of, but neuer obtaineth.
               The whole verſe laboureth of a Gradation, thus: He carefully laboureth for no cauſe; and not onely ſo, but there is none end of his labour; and not onely that, but he is neuer ſatisfied, neither that onely, but he affords no comfort to his body therewith. He planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit; he feedeth a flocke, and eateth not of the milke, he is an oxe treading out the corne, and muzzleth his owne mouth, yea, when his bread is before him, he layeth his knife to his throat, as Solomon ſaith, ſcarcity is vpon his table. This is a vanity, and a ſore trauell. It is one alone indeed, for there is nothing in nature to compare him to. For euery creature deſireth the perfection of it ſelfe, but this ſeeketh his owne deſtruction. He is like a Water-mill.

                  Miſanthropicall couetouſneſſe, by a compariſon of contrary Which is a remedy againſt the contrary▪ vanity.ſociety or community of life; Two are better then one. This contrariety is confirmed by the oppoſition of the benefits of ſociable life, and euils of ſolitary life, by diuerſe examples, in theſe foure next verſes, to wit, of two working together, of two lying together, of two contending, with the Oppoſition, or contrariety.
                  Antitheſis of their reaſons, or contrary conſequence of contraries.
               The firſt example, is of two working together. Two or more labouring, or trauelling, or doing any thing are helped, furthered and comforted one by another. And that worke, or exerciſe whereabout they are buſied, hath better ſucceſſe by much, then when one is alone. Man by nature is the moſt ſociable creature, as his reaſon and ſpeech doth manifeſt. As for other liuing creatures they are ſociable alſo, but yet by naturall ſympathy, and ſo are plants alſo. They are gathered or ſeuered by their manifold differing kinds, and by ſympathies and antipathies in their kinds: But reaſon and ſpeech vniteth men into one ciuill body, and ſeuerall men are

ſeuerall members of that body. And whereas no member can ſerue it ſelfe, maintaine or comfort it ſelfe without the other, nor if it be ſicke, lame, &amp;c. can relieue it ſelfe without the other: ſo neither can any one man liue without the coworking, nor comfort himſelf without the aid &amp; compaſſion of another. But if he ſtriue to doe it, or can doe it in ſomethings yet it is altogether imperfectly, vnprofitably, vncomfortably done, and of no continuance. For the whole ſtate of one member is ſo by diuine prouidence intangled and vnited with another, that in the perfect wel-fare of one there muſt be a concurrence or communion of all, as wee ſee it to be in the members of the body, which though they haue ſeuerall offices, yet cannot one execute his office to the perfect good of it ſelfe, without the communion of the offices of the other members. What can the man doe, whom all men forſake and leaue wholly to himſelfe? what can the eye doe when all the other members leaue it? what profit hath it by ſeeing? Therefore the more that a man is ſeperated from ſociety, and community of life, he is the more imperfect, comfortleſſe, miſerable. But now this Miſanthropicall drudge hath no ſociety with God, and little with men, therefore he is a member deſtitute, imperfect, yea worſe then a beaſt. He is imperfect and deſtitute▪ 
                  quia flagrat inuidia populi, the hearts of all are againſt him. All the members with-hold their lucky communicati

                  g influence, as I may ſay, and are maleuolently aſpected: Now he that is diſhearted of all, is as fruit in an ill ſeaſon, too cold, too hot, intemperate. Contrarily, he that hath the hearts or good will of men, flouriſheth vnder their beneuolous aſpect. Therefore the pliant ſociable man is much better then the tough, ſtiffe, ſoliuagant drudge in all ſeaſons and affaires.

                  For if they fall, the one will lift vp his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not auother to helpe him vp.
               
               THe contrary reaſons, ſhewing the benefits of ſociable life, and the euills of ſolitary couetouſneſſe. If they fall, &amp;c. If

one or any of them miſcarry, in a iourny, or any action, then his fellow will helpe him vp, commiſerate his caſe, and communicate his helpe, euen his ſtrength with the others weakneſſe. So it is in the ſociety, and community of ciuill life. If a man haue companions, friends, and well-willers, which are gotten and kept by mutuall duties, and tokens of loue and friendſhip, he ſhall haue helpers and furtherers of him in his neede, reioycers with him in his proſperity, comforters of him in his ſickeneſſe, incouragers of him in his troubles, and commiſſerators of his ill-fare, of what kind ſoeuer it be. Contrarily, woe is to him that is alone; when he falleth, he hath not another to helpe him vp. Woe, that is, loſſe, trouble, vncomfortable liuing, &amp;c. is to him that is alone: For as he careth for no man, ſo no man careth for him. Euen as he that is alone in a iourney, and falling by the way hurteth himſelfe, or falleth lame, or falleth ſicke, or wanteth money, &amp;c. is in greater trouble and diſtreſſe, if he want a fellow, or companions to communicate, and impart their helpe vnto him: ſo if a man be a ſolitary drudge, and an vnprofitable incompact member, that he careth for none but for himſelfe, nor yet in effect and truth for himſelfe, as Domitius Nero, who complained that he could find none to kill him, when a more ignominious death waited for him; he I ſay, ſhall in his proſperity be enuyed, and grudged at of all, in his ſtrict dealings be curſed, in his need be helples, in his troubles remedileſſe, in his heauineſſe comfortleſſe, in his falling troden vnder foot, and after his death caſt into the pit as an vnprofitable drone. Briefly, he ſhall want all the profitable and comfortable fruits that redound to men by vertue of mutuall duties, and loue in ſociable, and ciuill life. What profit hath this man of all his labours that he taketh vnder the Sunne?

                  Againe, if two lie together, then they haue heate; but how can one be warme alone?
               
               THe ſecond example is of two or more fellowes lying together in bed, or boards, or on the ground. Two lying together, are better then one, becauſe they haue heate. Contrarily,

how can one be warme alone? If two or three men lye together in the colde, they ſhall be helped one by another, and all kept warme: euen ſo, if there be an entercourſe of mutuall duties among men, accordingly as euery man hath receiued the gift of God, then ſhall they be helped, comforted, ſuſteined one by another, and it ſhall be well with euery one of them. But contrarily, if one lie alone, the cold ſurpriſeth him on euery ſide, and by his contrary quality, driuing and inforcing the blood and heat inwardly, benummeth the outward parts, oppreſſeth the heart, and mortifieth it; whereas two or three lying together, the heat is produced and kept in the outward parts the pores of the body kept open, the blood diſperſed, the fleſh kept ſupple by the heat, and ſo preſerued from the rigidity of the cold: euen ſo in ciuill ſociety, if a man be without fellow, friend, companions, louers, welwillers, he is helpeleſſe, comfortleſſe, and impotent, ſubiect to many euils, and inconueniences that might be auoyded, hee hath none to reioyce with him in his good ſucceſſe, nor to commiſerate his euils, none to maintaine him in his ſtanding, nor to ſuſtaine him in his falling.

                  And if one preuaile againſt him, two ſhall withſtand him; and a three-fold cord is not quickly broken.
               
               THe third example is of two or more fellowes in matter of contention. If one preuaile againſt him, two ſhall withſtand him. As if he ſhould ſay, If a man be not alone, but hath fellowes or pertakers, then though that one be ſtronger then he, to giue him the foile, yet ſhall he with the helpe of his fellow withſtand that one. This is amplified by a compariſon of the leſſe to the greater, figured by a prouerbiall or alligoricall ſpeech. (A three-ſold cord is not quickely broken.) If with the helpe of one he ſhall be able to withſtand him, much more then with the helpe of two or more. Or, when many ſhall lay their ſtrengths together, they ſhall be much more able. So likewiſe if a man be not a ſolitary, malecontented, ſelfe-conceited, rigorous muckrell, but communicate with others, and be conſociate with them by the

intercourſe of mutuall duties, beneuolence, courteſies, kindneſſe, compaſſionateneſſe, &amp;c. the like he ſhall find againe. Therefore the vniuſt ſteward dealt wiſely, Luke 16. He made friends afore-hand, leſt he ſhould be alone, and deſtitute, and end his dayes in deſperation.
               To conclude all this point, our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith, With what meaſure ye mete, it ſhall be meaſured to you againe, Mat. 7. 2. Thus much of the ſecond example of inward euils.

                  III. Example of inward euils is wilfulnes. A Third example is of folly in kings, men of authority, and rule, men of wealth, and of what preheminence ſoeuer, whereby vanity is alſo increaſed. Idleneſſe bringeth the ſluggard to miſery; couetouſneſſe bringeth the niggard to miſery; and wilfulneſſe bringeth euery man of power and great eſtate, who hath an outward ſhew of happineſſe, to miſery. Yea, ſo farre from happineſſe is a wilfull and ſelfe-conceited man, although he be a King or Monarch, that a poore and a wiſe childe is better then he: The childe is better then the old man, the poore is better then the rich. Docility, teachablenes, tractablenes is the property of wiſedome, and he that is wiſe is neereſt vnto happineſſe, whatſoeuer his age and eſtate be. Contrarily, ſtubbornneſſe, peruerſneſſe, wilfulneſſe is the property of fooliſhneſſe, and he that is fooliſh is fartheſt from happineſſe, though he be a Monarch; Yea, hee is neereſt to greateſt miſery, as Ieho

                     akim, Saul, Zedekiah, &amp;c. Samuel was better then Heli, and Dauid then Saul. And through the like folly, were ten tribes rent from Rehoboam. The higheſt eſtate, or dignitie that a man can attaine to, and which men commonly count the happieſt, is the ſtate of a king. For a king hauing all other in ſubiection and vnder command, is in that worldly reſpect the neereſt vnto God, whoſe immediate vicegerent he is. And therefore in reſpect of ſupremacy in the execution of Iuſtice and iudgement, Kings are tearmed, comparatiuely, Gods.
               But notwithſtanding that high place and ſupreame power,

if hee want diſcretion and wiſedome to ſway the ſcepter in Iuſtice, and iudgement, according to the law of the higheſt, he is worſe than a poore ſubiect or inferiour, that hath wiſedome to order his priuate and particular ſtate aright. Yea, though he be old, and rich, yet is he worſe then one that is yong and euen a childe, and poore becauſe this hath wiſedome, that is, is capable, teachable, tractable, and ſo is in poſſibility and hope. But contrarily, the other being old, and by reaſon of age, and long experience ſhould be of a wiſe and vnderſtanding heart to diſcerne truth and equity, but yet is fooliſh, and carryed with the ſway of wandring and fruitleſſe luſts, as children commonly are; neither yet through wilfulneſſe will be admoniſhed, that is, will not heare, nor yeeld to the aduice and counſell of ſage, and prudent counſellers, but like Rehoboam, Zedekiah, Ahab, Nebuchadnezzer ſetleth himſelfe vpon his lees; the other, I ſay, is better then hee. All this compariſon is figured by a Synecdoche of the Speciall. For by king is meant all men of any externall power, place, wealth, kindred, beauty, ſtrength, age, or any prerogatiue. Contrarily, by the poore childe, is meant any one that wanteth theſe prerogatiues, and is the moſt inferiour.

               A Confirmation of the Antitheſis, or contrariety, by the contrary effects of wiſedome and folly in them both. For out of priſon he commeth to raigne: That is, though he be a captiue, and kept in hold vnder chaines, as Ioſeph was, yet by wiſedome he commeth not onely to obtaine liberty, but alſo riſeth by degrees to the ſcepter: So that he which was a bondman, is now become a King; contrarily, he that is borne in the kingdome becommeth poore, as if he ſhould ſay the other was a made bondman, but borne a king, this made a king, but borne poore, becauſe that the other was in his birth and bondage of a kingly heart and diſpoſition, as was Dauid, though of meane parentage; but this in his kingly birth

and royall preheminence, is of a declining and degenerating heart and diſpoſition, as was Iehoiakim, and Comah; Ier. 22. Whereby it commeth to paſſe, that he looſeth the reuerend and awefull regard of his ſubiects, as did Sardanapalus, &amp;c. By folly and wilfulneſſe, are great houſes and kingdomes ouerthrowne, and tranſlated to others, whereof the Scriptures affoord diuers examples. By priſon-houſe is meant any of meane eſtate, or low degree, as Dauid was, and as Ioſeph was, according to the Pſalme 113. 7. 8. and ſpecially Pſalme 106. 17. 18. 19. 20. By borne King, is meant any of higher eſtate, degree, or preheminence in outward things, by the figure Synecdoche. Such like were Zedekiah, Iehoiakim, Coniah.

               THis third example of vanity, and vexation belonging to royall ſtate, is figured by the preuention of an obiection thus: What though ſometimes it fall out that Kings are led aſide, either through their owne folly, or deceits of wicked Counſellours, as the flattering Princes corrupted Ioaſh? 2 Chron. 24. 17. that argueth not that wiſe Princes behauing themſelues prudently in all their wayes, ſhould be ſubiect to vanity; that is, depriued of happy contentation, as other inferiour degrees are. I anſwer, that vanity and vexation in royall ſtate, is not onely increaſed by their owne folly, or produced by an inward cauſe; but alſo it proceedeth from an outward cauſe, to wit, occaſioned (if he were guarded from all other euils and diſcontentments) by the vnconſtancy, and the inſtability of the paſſionate people his ſubiects. For they are fickle and reſtleſſe, carried to and

                  ro, as euery blaſt of diſcontentment and idle fancies toſſe their humours, and are oft times like the Sea, that maketh a noyſe when no winde is ſtirring, when they haue no cauſe, but onely diſquieted with an itch, affectation of nouelties &amp; changes, though it be for the worſe, as the Iſraelites being weary of Iudge▪ ordained of God, would be gouerned by Kings, as other Nations were, 1 Sam. 8. 6. 7. As they that being wea

muſt be exerciſed with labour, verſe 11. to 18. that they may be brought to know their happy eſtate, which through fickle and wanton diſcontent they are ignorant of, like to children that hauing too much of their owne will, cry for the roode, for nothing elſe will quiet them. Deliciouſneſſe, and fulneſſe in euery thing, groweth loathſome. Howſoeuer, men know not, or are forgetfull of their owne good. This then is a griefe, and vexation to a King, that the people reſt not contented in him, and if they doe, yet when he is old, they begin for the moſt part to turne their hearts towards the ſecond, euen the child, or heire, that ſhall reigne after him. And this is not one of the leaſt griefes of old age, the contempt or neglect of the younger, when as they ſee themſelues growing out of requeſt, their names, account, and memoriall, decaying by little and little, with their bodies, and with death vaniſhing quite away. As this is to others, ſo to Kings alſo a vexation to ſee already the common aſpect of their people, bent vpon another obiect before the time. Old age is iealous, and ſuſpitious of the contempt of youth.

               A Reaſon, why people are with the ſecond child, that ſhall ſtand vp in the Kings ſtead, namely, their vnconſtancy. There is no end of all the people that haue beene before them▪ End, hath not relation to time, or perpetuall ſucceſſion of generations, but ſignifieth a fixed reſolution, and reſiſtfull contentation, or ioyfull complacence, which is not to be found in the people, which are wauering as the Sea, and variable as the Moone. For former people little regarded the preſent Kings Grand-father, being old, and in their deſires turned after his Father being young, whom againe now being old, the preſent people are weary of, and are all for his ſonne, and that for ſiniſter reſpects, euen their owne preferment, gaine, &amp;c. or itching after nouelties, and changes. They alſo that come after, ſhall not reioyce in him. And when he

is old alſo, the people then ſhall no more reioyce in him, then the former did in his aged Father. For the common people are like to children, that reſt not contented with any Schoole-maſter, and like to ſeruants, that loue to change euery yeere their Maſters, euen as againe Parents and Maſters are affected to new Miniſters. People are deſirous to heare new Preachers, as Feaſters to heare new ſongs, and new inſtruments; Ezech. 33. 32.
            
         
         
            CHAPTER V.
            
               
                  Verſe 1. 
                  Keepe thy foot when thou goeſt to the houſe of God, and be more ready to heare, then to giue the ſacrifice of fooles: for they conſider not that they doe euill.
               
               
                  He ſheweth here the vanities of the body eccleſiaſtick. 
                  IN this Chapter Solomon proſecuteth ſtill the ſame argument of vanities. But from the firſt verſe to the ninth, he maketh a digreſſion from vanities in temporall things, and ſheweth the vanities that are rife in the Word in the ſeruice of God. As before hee declared the vanities of all humane things, both inward and outward, and withall ſhewed the good that was to be found in them, euen the comfort of the body; ſo here hee ſetteth downe the true felicity and happineſſe of man, and where it is to be found, to wit, not in worldly wiſedome, worldly wealth, worldly pompe, but in the reuerend feare, and true ſeruice of God. It was not to be found in the Schooles of humaine learning, but in the houſe of God. And withall he ſheweth the vanities and hypocriſies of men, corrupting themſelues in this his ſeruice, to the verſe 8. and the occaſions of their hypocriſies and fainting in his ſeruice, verſe 8. as doubtings of Gods prouidence and adminiſtration through oppreſſions; which ſtill increaſeth vanity. And this he doth by way of exhortations, dehortations, or admonitions. That ſo by ſhewing on the one ſide the vanities of humaine things, with the good of

them for the body; and on the other ſide, the good of ſpirituall things for the ſoule, with the vanities therein, he might plainely ſet before our eyes the moſt abſolute and perfect felicity of both body and ſoule, euen of the whole man here in this World, yea, that in ſeeing the good of all things, and the vanities of all things, we might be mortified to this, and quickened or renewed to that. Keepe thy foote when thou goeſt to the houſe of God. Come not to the houſe of God, as to an ordinary houſe, but conſider whether thou goeſt, into whoſe preſence, to what end. In Prou. 4. 23. he ſaith; Keepe thy heart with all diligence. Here he biddeth, Keepe thy foote. By heart, hee meaneth the ſoule; by foote, the affections. The ſoule is carried vpon the affections, as the body is vpon the feete. Therefore the meaning is, take heede to thy ſoule, to thy ſelfe, to thy ſpirit, to thy affections. Conſider well how thou art in ſpirit affected, in affections diſpoſed, when thou goeſt to the Temple of God, to performe the workes of diuine ſeruice.
               
                  And be more ready to heare. When thou commeſt to the Temple of God, put thy ſhooes off thy feete, thy carnall affections, Exod. 3. 5. For the place where thou ſtandeſt, is holy, that thou mayeſt reſigne thy ſelfe wholly to the Lord; Ruth. 4. 7. Come in reuerence, humility, ſincerity, to heare the Law and the Prophets, to vnderſtand, to beleeue, to yeeld thy ſelfe to the Lord in abſolute obedience to his Word. Know wherefore thou commeſt, into whoſe preſence, what thou intendeſt by thy offerings, ſo ſhalt thou come in reuerence and dread, in faith, in thankfulneſſe.
               
                  Then to offer the ſacrifice of fooles. That is, fooles come cloathed with the ragges of vanity, ignorance, pride, preſumption, and other luſts, they come without a wedding garment. They come with a multitude of ſacrifices, and to burthen the Altar of God, as though God regarded their outward workes, and needed their gifts, that hee ſhould be pleaſed with them, reconciled to them, and reward them for their workes and gifts ſake, as great men vſe to doe, when coſtly preſents are ſent vnto them. But theſe fooles know not that the true intent of ſacrifices is not to giue to God, but

rather receiuing of God, as forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, deliuerance from euerlaſting death, ſaluation, and life, the right of this World, and the glory to come by the death and merits of the Sonne of God, whom thoſe ſacrifices, and offerings did ſhadow forth, repreſent, and ſignifie vnto them. They know not that they ſhould come to learne, vnderſtand, ſee, beleeue, and receiue the endl

                  s, and withall to teſtifie their thankefull obedience to him; euen the deniall of themſelues, and all fleſhly luſts, to reſigne themſelues wholly to him, who in the appointment of God, had euen already giuen himſelfe for them. This true faith and obedience is far from thoſe ignorant fooles, who thinke to appeaſe the anger of God, and to pleaſe him with their outward workes, and gifts, lip-prayers, and faſtings; Math. 6. Yea, to merit at his hands hereby, as euidently appeareth, Mal. 3. 14. It is in vaine to ſerue God, and what profit is it that we haue kept his Commandements, and that we haue walked humbly before the Lord of Hoſts? Here they looke to be rewarded of the Lord for their workes, and faſtings, according to their luſts, as they that honour and flatter Princes for their owne benefit and preferment. They did all for their owne profit, as the multitude that followed Chriſt ſo earneſtly, Iohn 6. 26. Suauis odor lucri ex re qualibet, Gaine is ſweete out of euery thing. In Zach. 7. 4. 5. They faſted the fifth and ſeauenth moneth, (a Law of their owne making, elſe it ſhould not haue beene kept ſo long, ſeauenty yeeres together, verſe 5.) to obtaine temporall benefits for their bodies of him, but they ſtopped their eares at the voyces of the Prophets, verſe 7. they refuſed to heare, they pulled away the ſhoulder, and made their hearts as an adamant, verſe 11. 12. God a giuer was theirs, but not God a receiuer.
               
                  For they conſider not that they doe euill. They vnderſtand not that theſe workes, prayers, ſacrifices, vowes, faſtings, are an abomination to the Lord, where faith, reuerence, humble confeſſion, loue, obedience, are wanting; Eſai 1. Pſal. 50. 8. to the end. 1 Sam. 15. 22. Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and ſacrifices, as in obeying the voyce of the Lord?
                  
                  Behold▪ to obey is better then ſacrifice; and to hearken, then the fat of Rammes; Prou. 15. 8. The ſacrifice of the wicked, is abomination to the Lord; but the prayer of the vpright is his delight. Theſe outward exerciſes of Religion, performed by fooles, are euill; and therefore an abomination, procuring wrath and deſtruction from the Lord. Firſt, when they are done in ignorance, and diſobedience, as appeareth by the Texts aforeſaid, the Iewes did, and moſt people now adayes doe, and alwayes haue done. Secondly, when vnder colour of religion, as hearing, reading, religious talking, &amp;c. they intend to effect ſome miſchiefe, at leaſt to couer their prophaneneſſe, couetouſneſſe, reuenge, &amp;c. So Abſolon vnder colour of a vow conſpired againſt his Father. The Phariſes vnder pretence of long prayers, deuoured widdowes houſes, they crucified Chriſt alſo vnder many pretences. So the Iewes faſted, Iſai 58. 4. Such a faſt was Iezebels, to murther Naboth. Such like were the Preachers of Corinth, and they that preached of enuie to increaſe Pauls afflictions; Phil. 1. 15. 16. And it is to be feared, that ſuch like abominable ones are plentifull in theſe dayes. For as all things are pure to the pure, ſo hypocrites defile the pureſt, and holieſt things.

               AN amplification of the former inſtruction by the ſpecials or particulars, to wit, of prayer &amp; vowes, to verſe 8. but negatiuely, or dehortatorily, to declare alſo the vanities incident to theſe religious exerciſes, as I ſaid before. Here he teacheth how we ought to pray, or to keepe our foote or heart in prayer. Be not raſh with thy mouth. That is, when thou art about to aske any thing of God, or to giue him thankes by prayer, let not thy tongue runne before thy wit, let not thy minde be carried away with rowling imaginations of many broken matters, and confuſed apprehenſions, nor yet thy affections vnpurged from the ſcent of ſenſuality,

pride, preſumption, boaſting, like the Phariſes, babble not forth ignorant &amp; heartleſſe formall ſpeeches in the eares of God, as hypocrites doe, which thinke to be heard for the loudneſſe of their noyſe, and multitude of their words, Mat. 6. 5. And let not thine heart be haſty to vtter a thing before God.
               
               Be not vnaduiſed in thy thoughts, and intent thereof in Gods preſence, to aske or promiſe what thou thinkeſt good according to thine owne luſt or liking, Iam. 4. 2. 3. 4. to giue and take as pleaſeth thy ſelfe, as if thou thy ſelfe be pleaſed God ſhould be pleaſed alſo, to doubt of Gods goodneſſe, and promiſe of giuing, and to limit his power. Let not thy counſels or thoughts proceed from an vnpurged, and ill diſpoſed heart, nor thy words from vncompoſed, vnconſtant, wandring, wauering thoughts. For God is in heauen, and thou vpon earth. Theſe words are an argument or motiue inforcing the former dehortation by a compariſon of things vnlike, to wit, Gods glorious Maieſty, and mans weakeneſſe, baſeneſſe vnworthineſſe, argued by the difference, and diſtance of the places where God moſt ſheweth forth his glory, (in heauen) and man hath his habitation (on earth.)
               
               As the higheſt heauen, which is the throne of God, is more glorious and greater then the earth, which is but his foot-ſtoole, and how farre the one is diſtant from the other, ſo is God much more excellent and powerfull than man, as the Lord ſaith, My thoughts are not as your thoughts, nor my wayes as your wayes.
               
               
                  Therefore let thy words be few, that is to ſay, dread that glorious and fearefull Name, The Lord thy God, Deut. 28. 28. Come before him in humility, feare and reuerence, vtter no fooliſh ſpeeches, make no vaine repetitions; but aske with an earneſt deſire in knowledge, according to his will, and for his glory. For he knoweth before what thou ne

                  deſt, he vnderſtandeth thy ſecret thoughts, and can giue thee what, and when it pleaſeth him, without thy prayer. But this meanes hath God ordained that he might be glorified by thee, by thy reuerend ſeare, ſubmiſſion, thankefulneſſe, that acknowledging of whom thou art, and from whom all that thou haſt commeth, thou maiſt returne thy ſelfe, and all that thou

haſt receiued to him, euen to the praiſe of his glorious name.
               
                  Few words are here oppoſed to ethnicall, phariſaicall, heartleſſe crying, and babling. 1 King. 18. 28. not to the often praying, nor long prayers, nor feruent repetitions of the ſanctified heart. Luc. 2. 37. Matth. 26. 44. Ioh. 17. 14. 16. Our Sauiour Chriſt ſpent whole nights in prayer, and the Apoſtle ſaith, Pray continually: And Chriſt by the parable of the vniuſt Iudge and the poore widdow, exhorts vs to frequent and vehement praying. Euery particular bleſſing requireth a particular prayer and thankeſgiuing. The Lords prayer containeth the ſubſtance of all prayers, as the twelue articles doe the Goſpell, and the tenne Commandements the whole Law. The diſciples made a generall requeſt of prayer in generall; Lord teach vs to pray, Luke 11. 1. not particularizing any ſubiect or matter, but as Iohn taught his diſciples. The prayer of Iohn was doubtles (as Caluin
                        •
                     
                   ſaith) ſome certaine forme gathered from diuers Scriptures, agreeable to the time of the comming of Chriſt, and his ſpirituall kingdome. And the prayer of Chriſt containeth the whole ſubſtance of his kingdome, which is Gods wiſedome and glory in mans ſaluation; the three former petitions reſpecting Gods glory, and the three latter thoſe things that are profitable to mans ſaluation. So alſo the commandements are diuided into two tables, the former containing duties of piety towards God, the other duties of charitie towards men. So the twelue articles teach vs what to beleeue concerning God, Father, Sonne and Holy Ghoſt, and what concerning the Church. The diſciples being yet but children and of confuſed knowledge vſed this prayer onely (I thinke) in ſolemne praying▪ as children and ignorant people are firſt taught the articles of faith, the commandements, and this prayer. But they that hold it enough to ſay the Lords prayer onely; namely, this forme of words, may as well lay it is enough to faith and obedience, onely to beleeue the Creede, and doe the commandements, refuſing the particulars of the Law and the Prophets, the Prouerbes of Solomon, &amp;c. the writings of the Euangeliſts, and Apoſtles, and all expoſitions and applications, as indeed they doe. But when the Apoſtles

were indued with full meaſure of the ſpirit they could frame prayers according to all circumſtances, &amp; exigence of times, and occaſions, as Act. 4. 24. &amp;c. Act. 20. 36. Which Pauls alſo in all his Epiſtles teſtifie after the example of Chriſt. Ioh. 17. and Chapter 11. 22. 42. &amp;c. and many other places. Therefore I conclude, as a mans knowledge of the truth is, ſo let him pray generally or particularly; yea both, according to the direction of the Lords prayer, and that is according to the doctrine of the whole Scripture of Chriſts kingdome. Euery right prayer is a branch of the Lords prayer, ſo euery doctrine a branch of the Creed, and euery worke of the ten Commandements. Aske, beleeue, doe. If theſe ſeeds be within vs, they muſt branch forth all ouer, as veines doe from the liuer, and ſinews from the braine; yea, if their branches fill the world, it is but the perfection and plerophorie, or fulnes of prayer, faith, obedience. As a man abounds in knowledge, ſo may he abound in all prayer and thankeſgiuing. But he that will inſiſt onely vpon the briefe collections or formes of the Creed, Lords Prayer, and ten Commandements, is very likely to deny all in particular, that in generall hee confuſedly confeſſeth, ſaying as it were, that fruit, that br nch neuer came out of that kernell which I had in my mouth ſeauen yeares agoe. This is but a fooliſh babler, that ſtandeth vp at the Creed, and fighteth againſt the Goſpel. That bableth ouer the Commandements, and maintaineth ſwearing, and hateth euery godly and righteous man, and is to euery good worke reprobate, one that is like the corne vpon the houſe tops, that maketh a ſhew a while, but neuer commeth to good.

               AN argument of dehortation, drawne from the effect, or rather adiunct, of many words, [batologie, or polylogie,] they are ſignes of a foole, they bewray an ignorant and heartleſſe hypocrite that prayes without knowledge, and without ſanctified affections. This is illuſtrated by a ſimilitude.

As the multitude of buſineſſe cauſeth a dreame, ſo doe many words declare a foole, who by raſh and inconſiderate ſpeeches, vttereth many follies and vaine things, that make him knowne to be a foole that hath a fooles heart: For a foole is counted wiſe till he ſpeake. He that hath no roote of vnderſtanding and wiſedome in his heart, but either ſaith other mens written prayers, or rabbles together many words and ſentences without vnderſtanding and affection, is a foole. Otherwiſe, he that is weake in knowledge, or otherwiſe defectiue, may vſe other mens prayers, and parcels of many prayers, into which his vnderſtanding and affection being implyed, they become his owne. For hee doth ioyne with holy men in their prayers, as the people ioyne with the preacher in his prayers, if he vſe diſcretion in the vſe of their prayers. For one ſet prayer cannot agree to all times and circumſtances, vnleſſe it be more generall, as the Lords prayer is moſt generall, and may therefore be ſaid at all times.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 4. 
                  When thou voweſt a vow vnto God deferre not to pay it: for hee hath no pleaſure in fooles: pay that which thou haſt vowed.
               
               THe ſecond particular is a vowe. When thou voweſt a vow vnto God, deferre not to pay it. That is, when according to the Law thou haſt vndertaken to exhibite an euident teſtimony of honour to the Lord by a vowe, thereby exciting and ſtirring vp thy ſelfe to giue vnto the Lord that which is his owne and due vnto him, euen thy ſelfe, the reſignation, and conſectation of thy ſelfe, or any thing into his hands, to be to his honour in thankefull obedience after a more ſpeciall manner; deferre not to pay it, doe not mocke God, trifle not with him, make no diſſembling ſhew of ſpeciall ſeruice, and thankefulneſſe to him, when thou art loath to performe it, as though thou wert willing to bind thy ſelfe to God, but yet loath to abridge thy ſelfe of liberty: This is like the hypocriſie of Ananias and Saphira, Act. 5. For he hath no pleaſure in fooles. An argument inforcing the admonition. They that doe ſo are not accepted of God, becauſe they are

fooles, that is, they are ſinfull and wicked, their raſhneſſe ſheweth their irreuerence, their ſlackneſſe in paying, ſheweth their dead heart and coldneſſe of affection, and their not paying, manifeſteth their deepe hypocriſie and contempt of him. The man of honour, and the aged are offended, if a man in ſuch ſort trifle with them, much more is God diſpleaſed, when he is ſo lightly regarded, and mocked. Therefore the Lord commanded in the Law, Deut. 23. 21. When thou ſhalt vow a vow vnto the Lord thy God, thou ſhalt not ſlacke to pay it: for the Lord thy God will ſurely require it of thee; and it would be ſinne in thee. Pay that thou haſt vowed. A concluſion of the reaſon. If thou ſlackeſt to pay thy vow, it ſhall be ſinne in thee: Therefore pay it.

                  Better it is that thou ſhouldeſt not vow, then that thou ſhouldeſt vow and not pay.
               
               AN amplification of the concluſion, by a compariſon. It is better not to vow, becauſe that it is indifferent and free, for God hath not commanded it, but promiſed to accept that incitation of thy ſelfe to ſpeciall ſeruice and duties. Therefore if thou forbeare to vow, it ſhall be no ſinne in thee; Deut. 23. 22. it is better I ſay, then that thou ſhouldeſt vow and not pay, becauſe that is ſinne. For God is mocke
                     •
                  , ſeeing that whom with thy lippes thou haſt honoured, thou haſt by deede diſhonoured, ſhewing thereby thy want of feare, reuerence, and loue to him, as followeth in the next verſe.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 6. 
                  Suffer not thy mouth to cauſe thy fleſh to ſinne, neither ſay thou before the Angel, that it was an errour: wherefore ſhould God be angry at thy voyce, and deſtroy the worke of thine hands?
               
               A Reaſon of the compariſon, why it is better not to vow, then to vow and not to pay: becauſe it is ſinne. For though thy vow be in thy free choyce, yet when it is once made, God hath commanded the performance. Deut. 23. 23.

                  That which is gone out of thy lippes, thou ſhalt keepe, and performe; euen a free-will offering, according as thou haſt vowed to the Lord thy God, which thou haſt promiſed with thy mouth. Therefore Dauid ſaith, Pſal. 66. 13. 14. I will pay thee my vowes, which my lippes haue vttered, and my mouth hath ſpoken, when I was in trouble. This he propoundeth by way of dehortation. Suffer not thy mouth to cauſe thy fleſh to ſinne. That is, neither conceiue in minde, nor promiſe with thy mouth, that which thou canſt nor, nor oughteſt to performe, for that is but to binde thy ſelfe to ſinne, which eaſily thou mighteſt haue auoyded▪ yea, to call and ſeeke for occaſions of ſinne, in that thou takeſt vp that for an occaſion, which God hath left free, and eaſie for thee to forbeare. Neither ſay thou before the Angell that it was an errour. A preuention of an obiection, thus. Although I haue raſhly vowed that which now I cannot performe, and through ignorance haue vowed that, which afterwards I find to be vnlawfull, yet my intent was good: Therefore if I confeſſe mine errour before the Lords meſſenger, Mal. 2. 7. and ſeeke to be abſolued from my vow according to the Law; Leuit. 5. 4, 5. &amp;c. I truſt God will be reconciled to me. Anſwer. When we are about to doe for our ſelues, I meane, to pleaſe God according to our owne ignorance and luſt, then we terme it a good intent; but when the deede is naught through want of knowledge of Gods will, and hearty ſubmiſſion to his will, the intent is as bad. A foole will not want excuſes for his follie, and this good meaning, or well meaning, is one of the common deceits of a carnall heart, being like him that wiſheth well to his friend, but neuer doth him good, but rather euill alwayes in the end, when he is throughly tryed. He that inconſiderately and vnlawfully voweth, vnder colour of good, and good intents, prouoketh God to anger, and ſhall not goe vnpuniſhed, notwithſtanding his outward abſolution. For vnleſſe we dread his Maieſty, and ſeeke to know his will, that wee ſinne not againſt him, he will not accept our offerings. Leuit. 5. 6. 10. Our prayers ſhall be turned into ſinne. For this is nothing indeed; but to make the Ordinance of God, an occaſion to ſinne againſt God. If we ſinne vnwillingly, and of

infirmity, we haue Ieſus Chriſt the righteous, a propitiation for our ſinnes; but if for that cauſe we be careleſſe, and preſumptuous, we mocke God, and deceiue our ſelues, and there is no truth in vs. For Chriſt came to redeeme vs from ſinne, to bind vs vnto God, and not to giue liberty to ſinne, to make leſſe conſcience thereof, but rather more, according to the abundance of mercy. Wherefore ſhould hee be angry at thy voyce, and deſtroy the worke of thine hands? Wherefore ſhouldſt thou prouoke God to anger by words, and ſuch words as are in thine owne power? For God hath not commanded thee to promiſe this or that to him: So that in not promiſing, thou haſt not ſinned. Why then ſhouldeſt thou bring ſinne vpon thy ſoule, by promiſing that which thou oughtteſt not, or canſt not performe? Surely, when thus for want of feare of God, thou diſhonoureſt him, hee will honour himſelfe in thy luſt iudgement, that others may dread his name.

               A Reaſon of the dehortation, or admonition. For in many words, that is to ſay, in raſh and inconſiderate promiſes, and excuſes accordingly, there are diuers follies. For God is offended, the Meſſenger of the Lord is grieued at thy follies, men are ſcandalized, and thou art puniſhed. This he illuſtrateth by a compariſon of dreames, which neither are true, but the confuſed &amp; diſordered fancies of one that ſlumbereth, nor ariſing from the principles of reſt, by iudicious diſcourſe, but cauſed by diſtempered humours, neither to any end, but to diſquiet him that would take his reſt. Such like are fooliſh prayers and fooliſh vowes. But feare thou God. An exhortatory concluſion of all, ſetting downe the true ground of prayer and vowes, which maketh them acceptable to God. But feare God. The feare of God is the beginning of wiſdome, Pſal. 19. 9. The feare of God is cleane, a good vnderſtanding haue they that doe thereafter. If thou feareſt God, thou wilt wiſely promiſe, and diligently performe. Feare being

               THeſe words are a confirmation of his former documents, or diuine leſſons of ſacrificing, prayer, vowes, figured by a prolepſis, gathered from his former diſcourſe of vanities, increaſed by oppreſſions, Chap. 3. 16. 17. Cap. 41. 2. 3. Obiect. It is in vaine for a man to bind himſelfe too ſtrictly to religion, and religious exerciſes, otherwiſe then for politicke reſpects ſeeing that there is no prouidence of God, nor diuine adminiſtration oſ the World, as euidently appeareth by the oppreſſions of the poore, and the violent peruerting of iudgement and iuſtice. For it is a maruell indeed, and a thing euen contrary to reaſon, that there ſhould be not onely a generall, but alſo a ſpeciall prouidence and gouernment in iudgement, and iuſtice, and mercy, Ier. 9. 24. and yet to ſee ſuch oppreſſions &amp; wrongs goe vnpuniſhed &amp; vnreformed, &amp; the poore &amp; godly without deliuerer, without comforter.
               
                  Anſ. This argument ſeemeth good indeede to carnall reaſon, which iudgeth according to outward appearance, not according to the ſecret and good wiſedome of God, who intendeth the glory of himſelfe in all things. For ſo the fooliſh ſay, Mal. 3. 14. it is in vaine to ſerue God, what profit haue wee by obedience and humiliation of our ſelues in mourning and faſting? And the wicked ſay, Pſal. 10. 11. God hath forgotten, he hideth away his face, he will neuer ſee it. So Pſal. 73. 11. How doth God know? Is there knowledge in the moſt high? Dauid was alſo tempted to this folly,

But Solomon here reſolueth this doubt. If thou ſeeſt ſuch diſorder in a

Prouince, maruell not that it ſhould be ſo, for God that is moſt high in power and dignity, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and Iudge of Iudges, knoweth and regardeth, yea, ordereth all theſe diſordered things according to his wiſedome for his glory, the puniſhment of the wicked, and good of his ſeruants. And as theſe earthly Princes and Gouernours, are ſet in high place, and are therefore called gods, becauſe they are Gods Vicegerents; ſo hath God other Miniſters, an innumerable company of Angels, higher and greater then they, by whom he executeth iudgement on tyrants, and cruell oppreſſours in his time, as Chap. 3 17. They ſhall be puniſhed, and the godly and poore, oppreſſed, ſhall be deliuered, Pſal. 12 5. For the oppreſſion of the poore, for the ſighing of the needy, now will I ariſe, ſaith the Lord, I will ſet him in ſafety from him that would inſnare him.

                  IIII. Example of vanities obſerued in outward things. A Regreſſion to his former diſcourſe of vanities in worldly things. This is the fourth example of vanities, obſerued in outward things, to wit, of earthly poſſeſſions, pertaining to the manifold vſes of this preſent life in ciuill ſtate, which men get without oppreſſion and wrong, by lawfull courſes, whereby notwithſtanding vanity is increaſed. And he maketh his repaſſage to the demonſtration of theſe vanities, by a compariſon of worldly goods among themſelues. Moreouer, that is to ſay, now (after this digreſſion to vanities in ſpirituall things) to returne againe to theſe earthly things, wherein men beſtow ſo much ſtudy and trauell, amongſt all their manifold ſtudies and practiſes to ſatisfie their hearts deſires, there is nothing more needfull and profitable then tillage. For the earth is for

               The earth is the wombe whereof all are formed, and the breaſts or dugges whereof all are fed and preſerued. The fulneſſe of the earth are the creatures thereof, and the fulneſſe of the creatures, the fruits and vertues that are in them, to ſuſtaine and maintaine this mortall life. The reuenewes of the earth therefore are moſt neceſſary and excellent, amplified by an argument of the Greater.

                  He that loueth ſiluer, ſhall not be ſatisfied with ſiluer; nor he that loueth abundance, with increaſe: this is alſo vanitie.
               
               AN argument to confirme the vanities of this ſtudie, exerciſe, and courſe of life alſo, illuſtrated by a compariſon of the like. Euen as he that loueth ſiluer cannot be ſatisfied therewith, but this thirſt increaſeth with his ſtore, as the Poet ſaith, Creſcit amor nummi, quantum ipſa pecunia creſcit, that is, as the heape is greater, ſo the appetite is ſharper, All the benefit that he receiueth by his money, is the ſight of it, and the ſight breeds longing, and that breedeth diſcontent with that which is preſent; as this man I ſay, is not ſatisfied, ſo neither can he that loueth abundance be ſatisfied with increaſe. He that loueth full fraughtage of grounds, corne, cattle. &amp;c. receiueth no contentation by thoſe which he hath, but hee ſtill deſireth more, neither doe the fruits redound to him in ſuch meaſure, as he ſtill deſireth. And if there be no difference betweene the greedy Farmer or Purchaſer, and the biting Vſurer, the one receiuing no more contentation by his grounds and ſtocke, then the other doth by his ſiluer, then is the ſtate of them both miſerable, and vaine and full of vexation. Note, he ſaith not, He that hath money, or he that hath abundance is not ſatisfied, but he that loueth them. For a man may haue theſe, and yet loue God onely, which the other do not. But Solomon ſpeakes here of worldly things, which are the deſire, loue, delight of worldly men, whereby and wherein they ſeeke for an earthly felicitie in the pleaſant paradiſe of their poſſeſſions, but finde naught.

                  When goods increaſe, they are increaſed that eate them: and what good is there to the owners thereof, ſauing the beholding of them with their eyes?
               
               A Confirmation of this inſatietie, and conſequently vnprofitableneſſe by a cauſe thereof. When goods increaſe, they are increaſed that eate them. As a man deſires to haue aboundance of corne, cattle, wine, oyle, &amp;c. So muſt he haue alſo a multitude of ſeruants and hirelings, his family muſt be inlarged with his reuenewes, who worke the ſame out of the earth for him. And what good is there, &amp;c. That is to ſay, no good at all, figured by a communication. They worke for him indeed, but the benefit redoundeth to them, for as they get it, ſo theyeate it, and weare it, ſharing him out a part thereof amongſt them, ſometimes the beſt, ſometimes the worſt, ſometimes the greateſt, ſometimes the leaſt, and that for ouerſeeing them; and yet his ouerſight is ſuch ſometimes, as that his alowance is made him accordingly. This is the good that hee reapeth by the profits of the field, euen to behold the ſharing of them out into parts, to looke vpon his owne part, and to eate as the reſt doe, for he can make no more of it, but meat, drinke and apparell, and ſo much doe they make of theirs, with as full contentment and more. For they lay all the burden of cares, and all other troubles vpon his fairer portion, to reduce it to an equal

                  tie with theirs.

                  The ſleepe of a labouring man is ſweet, whether hee eate little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not ſuffer him to ſleepe.
               
               AN amplification of the vnprofitableneſſe of plenty of earthly fruits by a compariſon. A man in the ample poſſeſſion of theſe is in worſe caſe then the poore man that wanteth this aboundance: Becauſe that the ſleepe of a laboring man is ſweet, whether he eate little or much. The laboring man is tyed to a competency or meane, therefore on the one ſide hee is free from the euill ſuperfluities of intemperance

and riot, to which filth is ſubiect, yea, to which out luſtfull nature doth captiuate vs in the poſſeſſion thereof, but the other is reſtrained, for his fire wanteth fuell to flame forth with the other, and is kept in a temper. Againe on the other ſide, he is free from conſuming cares, which weary the braine, and diſquiet the heart of the other; So that his bodily paines are recompenſed with pleaſant ſleepe, whether he eate much or little, whereas the reſtleſſe ſpirit of the other rideth his body day and night: For his abundance will not ſuffer him to ſleepe. His abundance is a great heauy lumpe, like the ſtone of Siſiphus, which is rowled vp and downe continually with a doubtfull, fearefull, carefull heart; or elſe the contrary temptations thereof doe ſo ouer-power him, that he hath no more command of himſelfe then the fed horſe. So that his condition is miſerable, and cauſeth the poore man to bleſſe himſelfe in his mediocritie, yea, to preferre his pouerty before the others wealth. This is a great euill, but there is yet a ſorer then this.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 13. 
                  There is a ſore euill which I haue ſeene vnder the Sun; namely, riches kept for the owners thereof, to their hurt.
               
               AN amplification of the vnprofitableneſſe of wordly goods by their euent. It is firſt propounded generally, There is an euill. Secondly, confirmed by the teſtimony of his ſpeciall obſeruation: Which I haue ſeene vnder the Sunne. Thirdly, explicated more ſpecially. Riches kept for the owners, to their hurt.
               
               In theſe three laſt verſes before, the vnprofitableneſſe of riches, is figured by a gradation, thus. A man hath not onely no good by them▪ ſaue to looke on them, verſe 11. but alſo they depriue him of his neceſſary and naturall reſt by night, verſe 12. Neither doe they onely ſo, but (poſitiuely) they bring him to ruine oft-times, verſe 13. The former words include a compariſon of euils among themſelues, to illuſtrate this euill of riches; as if he ſhould ſay: There be many infirmities and euils incident to man, and to his outward ſtate, to increaſe vanity, anger, ſorrow, griefe, &amp;c. Yet is this a

ſore euill, cholah, or euill diſeaſe, euen a ſickeneſſe to death, that a man ſhould ſpend all his dayes in trauell, depriuing his body and minde of recreations, and ſuch comforts as the vſe of riches bring, that in his latter dayes his ioy may be full, and perfect, without any mixture of care, or feare of want, either for himſelfe or for his children; but then it ſhould fall out quite contrary to his expectation; namely, that thoſe things which were gathered, kept and preſerued for his good, ſhould be to his deſtruction in their euent. This was the euent of Hamans aſpiring to promotion and honour, wealth, friends &amp;c. Hee little thought that all his plots for honour and wealth ſhould haue beene a rope and a gallowes to hang him on, whereas many others had been hanged with leſſe coſt and labour. But the more coſt the greater infamy, the higher riſe the greater fall.
               The builders of the tower of Babel intended to make themſelues famous in the earth, but the euent was their labor for their trauell, and the iudgement of God vpon their pride. It became a bable good for naught, but to proclaime their folly to all ages of the world. The deuill and the Phariſes thought that all was firme and ſure to them and theirs, when they had crucified Chriſt, and in his ignominious death had expoſed his name, doctrine, and all that beleeued in him, to ſhame and perpetuall contempt. But the euent was the downe-fall of Satans kingdome, and the ſhame and confuſion of them and their children, as it is in the parable of the vineyard. They that beleeue in him ſhall neuer be confounded, nor aſhamed. Much a doe a long time alſo, hath there been about the building and eſtabliſhing of the Romiſh Synagogue, and deifying the great Gull, but confuſion and ſhame ſhall be the euent. The rich man. Luk. 12. prouided and laid vp great ſtore of wealth, for his caſe and ioy in his old age, but when he begins to ſay, Now ſoule caſt off all care, take thine eaſe, eate, drinke, and be merry, the euent was quite contrary, for his goods preſſed downe his ſoule to hell.
               Finally, to how many and moſt lamentable miſeries may a man and his family be expoſed by reaſon of his abundance,

wherein ſoeuer it conſiſteth, all ages affoord innumerable examples. Neither doe theſe euils befall the wicked onely, the euent of whoſe vnlawfull-gotten-goods, Solomon here alonely aimeth not at, but euen the good alſo, as the example of Naboth, and of innumerable in our experience may teſtifie. Sinne is the cauſe or ground of all euils. Pride was the cauſe of Hamans fall, and ſinne was the ground of Iobs miſery, and Naboths death.
               To conclude, this is a vanity and a grieuous euill belonging to worldly goods, whoſoeuer getteth them, or keepeth them; namely, oft-times to occaſion his ruine. This generalitie doth Solomon principally intend.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 14. 
                  But theſe riches periſh by euill trauell, and he begetteth a ſonne, and there is nothing in his hand.
               
               AN amplification of their vnprofitableneſſe, by their inſtability and vncertainty. They are a ſlippery poſſeſſion, like an Eele in a mans hand, or a bird that hath ill-will to tarry there, for as ſoone as the hand 
                     •
                  lacketh, ſhe is flowne; ſo riches take them the wings of an Eagle, and flie vp ſuddenly into heauen, they writhle out of the hand, and luſh into the deepe, and that when a man ſeeth and looketh on. But theſe riches periſh by an euill trauell. This word (But) ſeemeth to imply a prolepſis, thus: Wealth indeed ſometimes doth occaſion a mans ruine, as Abraham trauelling into Egypt, feared that the beauty of his wife ſhould be an occaſion of his deſtruction, Gen. 20. 11. So Iacob feared that his poſterity ſhould occaſion euill to him from Laban, and his ſonnes, but that is ſeldome.
               
                  Anſ. Be it ſo that a man periſh not by thoſe riches, yet theſe euen theſe riches hagnaſher ha
                        •
                     ica, that a man hath ſo laboriouſly gotten, and carefully kept, and ſtill diligently increaſeth, ſhal periſh in his hands, (as though they muſt either kill, or be killed) and that either by caſualties, to which they lye open, as well as himſelfe doth; or elſe by his owne folly, and improuidence. For there is a way, which a man in wiſedome taketh, whereby all things ſucceed according to his minde.
               
                  
Againe, there is a way which a man taketh for the beſt, and likelieſt, but it is filled with croſſe and loſſe, euery one falling in the necke of other, both cauſally, and occaſionally, which thing oft times bringeth a ſudden diſſolution of the greateſt, and moſt ſetled eſtate. For in this caſe a man is in a maze, and knoweth not which way to turne him. For if he take this way, a Lyon ſhall teare him; if he leape ouer the hedge, a Serpent ſhall bite him; if he turne another way, hee ſhall fall among theeues. Whether he trauaile or trafficke by Sea or Land, it is an euill trauaile. What can a man doe when the Army of God encountereth him, or with-draw, as I may ſay, their fortunate aſpect from him? when nothing thriueth with him, but is like the panting Bird, or writhling Eele in his hand? And he begetteth a ſonne, and there is nothing found in his hand. An amplification of his calamity, by the extent, which is the pouerty of his poſterity alſo. It is not onely a griefe to him, to be depriued of his goods for himſelfe, but that his children alſo, for whom he ſo carefully trauelled, and are as deare vnto him, as vnto himſelfe, ſhould be left deſtitute, and helpeleſſe. And withall, the griefe of their Fathers fall extendeth to them, to adde affliction to the ſorrowfull, beſides the hopes of their poſſibilitie, which are now become fruſtrate: To be depriued of that which a man was borne to, as we ſay, is a perpetuall ſorrow, and cauſeth many a deepe ſigh.

                  As he came forth of his mothers wombe, naked ſhall he returne, to goe as he came, and ſhall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand.
               
               AN amplification of the vnprofitableneſſe of riches, by their common adiunct. They are bodily, temporary, momentany. Man is euerlaſting in his better part, whereof he is denominated a man. But riches ſerue onely for the time of this our life. There is no ſtrength in them to free a man from death, but they leaue him in the iawes of death. They ſerue onely for his expence by the way, till he come to the place of his accompt, and his iudgement vpon his accompt.

Riches are like an Harlot, which hauing intangled a man with the loue of her, maketh a ſhew as though ſhee would not depatt from him; but when he is arreſted by the Sergeant for debt, ſhee vtterly forſaketh him, and followeth other cuſtomers, whom ſhee mocketh in like ſort. The rich man can carry away nothing in his hand of all his labour, to affoord any helpe, or comfort to him after death. Diues, Luke 16. doth witneſſe this, who of all his earthly abundance, could not enioy ſo much as a droppe of water to coole his tongue. The rich mans departure out of the World, is illuſtrated by a compariſon of his comming into the World. As he came naked, ſo ſhall he returne. It will be ſaid; That is the common condition of euery man, and no more griefe to the rich then to the poore. Anſ. It is indeed the common condition of all men, but yet a miſery peculiar to the rich: For he hath onely laboured for riches, he hath put his confidence in his riches, his ioy, delight, comfort, was all in his riches; he knew none other God, but his Idoll. Now as it is the torment of hell, to be quite ſeparated from the preſence and protection of God, from the company of his Angels and Saints: ſo is it the greateſt miſery of the rich man, to be ſeparated from the preſence and protection of Mammon: When he and his Idoll are parted, then he falleth into deſperation. This we ſee verified by the practiſe of thoſe, who being yet aliue, and likely to liue long, make away themſelues, yea, oft times for a ſmall loſſe, but their feare is great: for they haue now none other God to truſt on, or to fl
                     •
                  e vnto for ſuccour. Therefore how much ſoeuer a man is addicted to any other ſinne, how great ſoeuer his deſire, his loue, delight be in any vice, yet for this onely is he termed an Idolater. And this is the cauſe, why the Scriptures impute this common condition of man with all creatures, to the rich, for a ſpeciall miſerie, Pſal. 49. 17. And as a mans deſire, ioy, loue, and confidence in his goods is the greater, ſo much greater is his miſerie: Otherwiſe, he that truſteth in the liuing God, who hath life in himſelfe, and by himſelfe, and giueth life to all, is poore in his abundance, Math. 5. 3. and rich in his pouerty. For in vſing of this World, he vſeth it not, for his heart is in

heauen, becauſe his treaſure is there. But hee that hath his treaſure here, liueth in feare, and dyeth in deſpaire. O death how bitter is the remembrance of thee to a man that liueth at reſt in his poſſeſſions, vnto the man that hath nothing (in outward appearance at leaſt) to vexe him, and that hath proſperity in all things, (for a little while, as Craeſus had) yea, vnto him that is yet able to eate meate, that is young, luſty, and ſtrong? &amp;c.

               AN amplification of the vnprofitableneſſe of riches loſt, by a compariſon of the common condition of man leauing his riches. For a man by death to leaue all behinde him, is a miſery. But it is a greater miſery for riches to leaue a man before death. Commonly riches accompany the rich to the graue, and there giue him his farewell, which indeed is a miſery to goe as he came: but this man hauing gotten them with exceſſiue toyle, is depriued of them before his death, ſo that in all points he goeth as he came. This is a double miſery. Diues his miſery was great in that hee muſt part from his wealth, yet he was honoured with a pompous funerall; but Iobs was greater, that being beſtripped of all, hee ſhould die before his death, and be buried before his graue was open, as yet hee knew nothing to the contrary. For firſt his whole ſtate was diſſolued, all his ornaments, all his neceſſaries vtterly diſperſed, dead in his eſtate, dead in his children, the World was a dead thing to him, and hee a dead thing to the World, as the Prouerbe is, Who is ſo woe begoue, as firſt a man ſince none. Againe, he was buried in the graue of ſorrow, and couered with the moulde of obliuion, and contempt. Therefore ſaid Dauid in his deiection alſo, I am a worme, and no man, I am as a dead man out of minde; and Elias, 1 Kings 19. 4. I am not better then my Fathers were. This then is alſo a ſore euill. Theſe words are an illuſtration of this miſery, by a compariſon with the former verſe 13. from

the Equals, in this word (alſo). As it is a grieuous euill for a man to periſh by occaſion of his riches; ſo is it alſo as grieuous an euill, that his riches ſhould periſh from him. For his life ſtandeth in his riches. And as Dauid in his mourning for Abſolon, wiſhed that he had died for him, 2 Sam. 18. 33. So the rich man in his mourning for the loſſe of his goods, wiſheth himſelfe dead, or that he had beene dead, when by ſuch or ſuch a folly he incurred ſuch an incurable damage. How many a man hazardeth, yea, looſeth his life to ſaue his goods? This deuoted ſeruitor will alſo die for the honour of his god Mammon. He is a Martyr alſo. What profit hath hee that hath laboured for the winde? A concluſion amplified by a compariſon, to illuſtrate the vnprofitableneſſe and vanity of vncertaine and periſhing riches. Euen as hee that laboureth for the winde, wearyeth himſelfe, but getteth naught▪ ſo this man gathering goods, enioyeth naught. The wind-gatherer feeleth the winde, but graſpeth naught; ſo this man imbraceth ſweetly his goods, but holdeth naught.

                  All his dayes alſo he eateth in darkeneſſe, and he hath much ſorrow, and wrath in his ſickneſſe.
               
               AN hypotypoſis, or liuely deſcription of his miſery, that is deſpoyled of his poſſeſſions, which I called before the death and buriall of a man, in reſpect of his worldly eſtate. All his dayes he eateth [a ſynecdoche of the ſpeciall) in darkeneſſe (a metaphor). As proſperity is compared to the ſhining of the Sunne, and brightneſſe of the Moone, Iob 31. 26. ſo is aduerſity to obſcurity and darkneſſe; Eſai 58. 10. The earth into the which the euill ſpirits were caſt downe, is a death, and an hell to them in compariſon of the glory of heauen; and this earth is proportionably an heauen to the damned. So in ſome proportion pouerty and want is a graue, a death, an hell to the wicked rich, in compariſon of the ſplendour and glory of his wealthy ſtate, from which he is fallen. When Diues would haue beene glad of one drop of water, how glorious and beautifull was the reuiew of his earthly ſtate? yea, the thought that for a man to behold the light of the Sun,

to haue his abiding among the creatures of God, to liue among men, and to be in the Church of God, though otherwiſe he licked the duſt with the Serpent, and drunke water, and were filled with all the temporall afflictions of this life, was an heauen. Now as this vale of miſery was to Diues in torments an heauen without miſery: ſo are vaine riches a paradiſe of pleaſure to the godleſſe rich, being now in pouerty. He counteth the rich happy, and himſelfe when hee was rich; but now he is in deſpaire, and hateth himſelfe, hee hath no comfort in himſelfe. For then he loued himſelfe for his goods ſake, but they being loſt, he is periſhed. Hee wandereth in ſolitarineſſe, like to an ignis fatuus, vndone, deboſhed, he auoydeth mans company, he delighteth in nothing, all things are turned into bitterneſſe, hee is a Pellican in the Wilderneſſe, an Owle in the Deſert. He hath much ſorrow ſicklineſſe, and anger. An amplification of the former generall ſpeech, by the ſpecials. Sorrow, in Hebrew Cagnas, ſignifieth indignation, wrathfulneſſe, fretting, grudging, repining, making euery thing a prouocation of griefe, as Prou. 21. 19. It is better to dwell in the wilderneſſe, then with a woman of contentions, and indignation, vacagnas, ſicklineſſe, and anger. In the Hebrew, and ſicklineſſe, or languor, and fury. Indignation, mourning, fretting, cauſeth ſicklineſſe, conſuming, and languiſhing, it dryeth, and maketh bitter the humours, which againe cauſeth furiouſneſſe. The Hebrew word Ketzeph, properly ſignifieth ſuch anger as cauſeth foaming, and froathing, as the tumultuous waters toſſed with the winde. As if he ſhould ſay, He is full of madneſſe, or beaſtly fury. For ſuch men commonly are angry againſt God, to which Sathan would haue tempted Iob. They curſe the Diuell and all ill lucke, they ſtorme againſt the creatures themſelues, and enuie other men. Neither doth he ſpeake of thoſe men onely that are thus impatient in loſſes, but of all men, which bewray ſuch infirmities in like caſe, though not in ſuch meaſure and deſperation, as the wicked doe, which once hauing riches, truſted not in God, but in riches.

               A Propoſition of Solomons iudgement (vpon conſideration of theſe vanities) of the true and right vſe of all worldly things, confirmed by the teſtimony of his owne obſeruation, and experience▪ 
                  Behold, that which I haue ſeene. Behold, a preface to ſtirre vp attention, conſideration, and remembrance of his inſtruction. That which I haue ſeene; The teſtimony. It is agood, which is comely, for one to eate▪ to drink &amp;c. the propoſition. This is the onely good that is to be found in them, bodily ſuſtenance, and perſonall maintenance. This Good is amplified by the adiunct, comelineſſe. This ioyfull, and comfortable vſe of honeſt labour is agreeable to the nature of man, who differeth from a beaſt: And carnall reaſon teacheth, that all things are made for man, that man might reioyce with man in the comfortable vſe thereof.
               Againe, it is agreeable to the perſon of man, who is the image of God, indued with a reaſonable ſoule, which is not made for his body, as the Epicure dreameth, nor the body for goods as the niggard ſlumbereth, but contrarily, Matth. 6. 31. Take no thought for meate, drinke, cloathing: For the body is not for raiment, nor the life for meate, but contrarily, Verſe 25. Clothing is for the body, meate is for the life, and the life is for the kingdome of God, verſe 33. Seeing that theſe things are for the reparation, ſuſtenance, and maintenance of mans body, which is the houſe and veſſell of the ſoule, it is a comely thing that this veſſell or houſe be accordingly maintained. For▪ that is the onely end and vſe thereof. As man is the moſt excellent creature and image of God, ſo let him not make himſelfe a beaſt, and ſeruant to the creatures; but maintaine the dignity of his perſon. But yet let him not turne his perſon into an Idoll, as it is now common.
               
                  For that is his portion. A confirmation by a reaſon drawne

from the end, and vſe of earthly things. They are giuen him of God, for that purpoſe, euen to conuert them to that vſe onely, for no other good is in them, no further matter can be wrought, or attained to by them. Therefore herein let him reſt himſelfe contented, and to this end limit his deſires, and indeauours.

               AN amplification of the propoſition, by the efficient cauſe, in the laſt words: This is the gift of God. For a man to labour moderately for riches, and by Gods bleſſing of his labour to attaine to riches &amp; wealth; and alſo to haue power to vſe the ſame for the comfort of his body, in eating, drinking, apparell, building; for the comfort alſo &amp; education of his children and family, accordingly as God hath beſtowed on him, and to reioyce herein alſo, without greedy deſire of more, or faithleſſe feare of loſing that which is preſent; All this is the gift of God. For vnleſſe God that giueth power to get wealth, giue alſo grace to vſe wealth aright, hee ſhall liue beſide his wealth, yea liue in pouerty, and die in miſery.

Neither ſhall the time preſent, nor the time to come be grieuous through feare of want or loſſe, or through doubting of Gods prouidence for him and his poſterity, or

through feare of death it ſelfe, ſommoning him to his reckoning. And why? Becauſe God anſwereth him in the ioy of his heart. A confirmation by the cauſe. As God hath giuen him power to gather riches and wealth, ſo he is anſwerable to his honeſt and conſcionable labours and trauaile, with another power, gift, or grace; namely, ioy of heart▪ comfort, and hearty ioy in the vſe thereof, to his owne good, his neighbours good, and Gods glory.

                  Verſe 1. 
                  There is an euill which I haue ſeene vnder the Sunne, and it is common among men.
               
               
                  AN illuſtration of the comfortable vſe of riches, which is the gift of God, by the contrary vnprofitableneſſe, vanity, or abuſe therof, in thoſe that want this grace; or rather by the abuſing of themſelues, their ſoules and bodies, in withholding the vſe thereof from both. Which thing is a plague and curſe of God vpon ſinners, that ſeeke not his kingdome, and the righteouſneſſe thereof, but truſting in themſelues and their goods, ayme at a full and firme eſtate, voyde of care and feare, or elſe of plaine and exceſſiue pride hoard vp their riches for the aduancement of their poſterity: Of which purpoſe alſo God defeateth them, by tranſlating their goods to ſtrangers. And this is a great calamity and woefull miſery. This hee toucheth to the end of verſe 6.
               This firſt verſe containeth the generall propoſition of this vnprofitableneſſe, and vanity of riches, which increaſeth the miſery of man that ſeeketh for a felicitie in them, not in God. There is an euill which I haue ſeene vnder the Sunne, and it is common among men. This vnprofitable vanity i
                     •
                   declared in this verſe. 1. By the Generall, an euill. 2. Confirmed by teſtimony, Which I haue ſeene vnder the Sunne. 3. Amplified by

the adiunct, and it is common among men. This knowne euill, whereof there is great complaint euery where, is common among men, and peculiar or proper to men: For beaſts are not ſubiect to this euill diſeaſe, but men onely, who in this reſpect among other, are worſe and more miſerable then beaſts. And it is indeed our peculiar plague of God vpon the diſtruſtfull, faithleſſe, vncharitable niggard; who as he neither loueth God, nor his neighbour, ſo neither doth he loue himſelfe, by the iuſt iudgement of God.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 2. 
                  A man to whom God hath giuen riches, wealth, and honour, ſo that he wanteth nothing for his ſoule of all that he deſireth, yet God giueth him not power to eate thereof, but a ſtranger eateth it: This is vanity, and it is an euill diſeaſe.
               
               A Particular explication of the propoſition in theſe two next verſes, wherein this vanity or euill plague, is ſet forth to the view of the eyes, by an hypotipoſis or liuely deſcription. There is a man, that as hee hath thirſted after worldly goods, as the Iſraelites hungred for fleſh, ſo God hath giuen him his hearts deſire: He hath riches, hee hath wealth, and the abundance of all things ſeruiceable for the welfare of mans life; he hath honour, or the place, and title of dignitie to which he hath aſpired, neither doth hee want any thing that his ſoule luſted after, but hath inioyed all the full meaſure and perfection thereof. Here is the outward appearance of happineſſe: But God withholdeth his grace from him, that he cannot vſe it to his comfort. He is like an aſſe loaded with gold, and victuals, but eateth thiſtles, and in the end a ſtranger that neuer ſweat for it, one vnknowne to him, yea, it may be one that was his enemy ſhall haue the vſe thereof. So that it plainely appeareth at the laſt to all men, that this happy man was the drudge, the Purueyor, the Porter, the aſſe of other mens burdens. Here is the vnprofitableneſſe and vanity of his labour. And this is an euill diſeaſe, or grieuous ſickeneſſe. This euill diſeaſe than conſiſteth, 1. In the accompliſhment of his deſires, He hath riches, wealth, honour, amplified by a commoration, he wanteth nothing. 2. In the

priuation or want of grace to vſe them: Yet God giueth him not power to eate thereof: Eating, is put for all comfortable vſes, by a Synecdoche of the ſpeciall, 3. In the euent of all his poſſeſſions, the tranſlation thereof to ſtrangers; But a ſtranger eateth it.

                  If a man beget an hundred children, and liue many yeares, ſo that the dayes of his yeares be many; and his ſoule be not filled with good, and alſo that he haue no buriall, I ſay, that an vntimely birth is better then he.
               
               A Continuation of the deſcription of the vanity of riches without vſe, figured by a Gradation. If, or although▪
                   a man hath not onely riches, wealth and honour, but hath euen an hundred children alſo, euen children (eſteemed the greateſt bleſſing, as orbity and barrenneſſe was a reproch) according to his deſire, which he may ſend out like flocks, Iob 21. 11. and not onely ſo, but withall liue many yeeres, and yet his deſires be not ſatisfied with riches, ſo that he cannot inioy the comfortable vſe of theſe things that are preſent; but euen his children are an occaſion of greedy deſire, care, ſorrow, ſparing, and pinching, &amp;c. and not onely ſatisfied and comfortleſſe in life, but alſo at his death hath no buriall, euen neither then hath any vſe of his goods, children, kinsfolkes: for the honourable execution of his funerall, Ier. 22. 18. but is rather executed for ſome capitall crime committed, as many Emperours and Popes were, or murthered, Ier. 22. 19. or drowned, or maketh away himſelfe, as Nero, and Achitophel, Saul and Iudas did, or dyeth farre from home, and ſuddenly, or that had beene hated, as Iaſon, 2 Maccab
                        •
                     us 5. 8. 10. of all men, and euen his children be weary of him, and aſhamed of him, yea diſcredited by him in his latter dayes, when his vnderſtanding and memory fayling, he hath no gouernment of his inordinate paſſions, but is wickedly humorous, weariſome, and odious, and therefore euen his friends glad of his death; this is a vanity, a miſerable calamity. This vanitie or euill diſeaſe, particularized in this verſe, conſiſteth. 1. In hauing children at a mans deſire. 2. In liuing

long. 3. In being depriued of all ioy through faithleſſe and greedy deſire. 4. In an infamous, and diſhonourable death. Laſtly, he illuſtrateth this vaine condition of the rich, by a compariſon of an abortiue child, to wit, one that is borne before his time, and dyeth in his birth: The vntimely birth is better then he.

                  For he commeth in with vanity, and departeth in darkeneſſe, and his name ſhall be couered with darkeneſſe.
               
               A Confirmation of the compariſon or preheminence of the vntimely-borne child aboue him. Ki bahebel ba, for he commeth in vanity, i. as nothing, being ſenceleſſe of good and euill. So that his comming is as no comming at all. And as he commeth before his time and growth to ripeneſſe of birth, and ſo is no man; ſo againe he departeth in darknes, he is priuately buried, either few or none knowing thereof, and his name is couered with darkeneſſe. For there is no ſpeech, nor remembrance of him any more.

               A Second priuiledge or preheminence of the abortiue aboue the vaine rich. Hee hath not ſeene the Sunne, &amp;c. His birth was to him an end of all miſeries to which the life of man is ſubiect. He neither felt in himſelfe, nor ſaw the manifold corruptions and euils in the world, nor the cares and trauels of this painfull life. He is freed from bodily diſeaſes and paines, from oppreſſions and enuy, from feares, and dangers, from griefe, anger and fury, with which the other was preſſed and oppreſſed: Therefore he hath more reſt then the other, who liued and dyed in vanity.
               The corne that is cropt vp as ſoone as it appeareth, or is bruiſed in pieces when it lyeth in ſprout, is better then the old weed that is hated while it ſtandeth, and in the end is cut downe for the fire.

                     d yeeres twice told, yet hath he ſeene no good. Doe not all goe to one place?
               
               AN amplification of the former argument by a prolepſis. Notwithſtanding, the eōmon afflictions of mortal life, yet it is a pleaſant thing to behold the Sunne, to enioy the bleſſings of God beſtowed on a man, and long life is a bleſſing deſired of all. Therefore in that hee liued here many yeeres, his condition is much better then the abortiues, which was depriued of all. Anſ. Although hee liued long, yea, a thouſand yeeres, and a thouſand to the end of that, yet is that no prerogatiue, but a multiplication of miſeries, and vanities: For he hath ſeene no good. He hath ſpent his dayes in carefull trauell, in ſorrow, griefe, anger, in much diſquietneſſe, feare, and trouble, he hath depriued himſelfe of ſociall recreations of the day, and the naturall reſt of the night▪ to accompliſh his vaine hopes, he hath liued beſides all his goods, he hath iaded his body, broken his braines, burthened his conſcience, he is hated of God, loathed of men, the earth groneth vnder his burden, the World is weary of him, hee is quite ſtript of all goodneſſe, and baniſhed out of euery place in the hearts of men, as Iaſon, 2 Macc. 5. 8. He dyeth in ignominy, he is burled in forgetfulneſſe, his name is rotten before his body, he hath neither done good, nor enioyed good, and how long ſoeuer he liued; Doe not all goe to one place? After that he hath had the experience of two thouſand yeeres vanities, he muſt deſcend into the graue of the abortiue, and returne againe into duſt with him. Now when they are both duſt, whether duſt is the better? the former or later? The duſt of him that had the experience of common, and perſonall vanities, without number, many yeeres, and ended his dayes in ſhame and diſhonour, or of him that neuer knew any thing?

                  All the labour of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled.
               
               THe ſecond part of the Chapter: which is, a concluſion of the weakeneſſe, and inſufficiency of riches to ſatisfie the deſire of man, to the end of the Chapter. Man conſiſteth of an immortall ſoule and corruptible body; that is ſpirituall, this is earthly: yea, that is a ſpirit, and the body is but a veſſell, or inſtrument vnited to it, without compoſition or mixture. This veſſell is the ſperme of the World, the duſt of the earth, that is to ſay, an elementary matter or ſubſtance, conſiſting of a mixture of the elements, and therefore it is ſuſtained and maintained by elementary foode; So that the appetite, to wit, hunger, and thirſt, is earthly alſo. Now what is the end of all the labour of man? wherein doth he labour? what is the obiect or ſubiect whereon he worketh? Is it not all to ſatisfie the bodily appetite? Whence proceedeth, and whether tendeth this appetite? Nature it ſelfe declareth the matter. The appetite of the Tree is the more ſimple moiſture, or rather iuyce of the earth, and it cannot, neither willeth to goe beyond his kinde: For the appetite is limited to the kinde, which onely deſireth the perfection, and propagation thereof. And ſo of all creatures liuing and ſenſible, according to their kindes. But mans veſſell being the moſt compound, not that it hath more elements then other creatures, but the moſt vniuerſall nature, hath an vniuerſall appetite: And the whole World, with all the creatures therein, ſerue onely for meate, drinke, and cloathing. The whole Armies of heauen and earth are onely for theſe three ſeruices of mans body, either immediately, or mediately; that is to ſay, either foode, or elſe preparatory veſſels, Miniſters, Officers, or Tradeſ▪men, ſubordinate one to another for man, who is the centre of them all▪ Sheepe and Oxen eate the iuyce of the earth, not immediately, but by the preparatory veſſell, the greene hearbe, by which it is transformed into foode agreeable to the nature of

wormes, and vileſt things, are by ſubordinate veſſels from one to another, prepared to his mouth, and for his mouth. The moſt vniuerſall inſtrument by whoſe foture the life of the World, and of all his furniture is maintained, is the light in the Sunne, which God therefore created before any other creature. Then the Starres, nextly the matter of the firmament, whereof the ſtarres were formed: Theſe are ſubordinate. So that the heauens are an vniuerſall cauſe or veſſell, by whoſe foture the elements are ſuſtained. Againe, the elements are an vniuerſall cauſe of ſuſtenance of their creatures produced out of their wombes, and formed of them. Laſtly, the mixt creatures are preparatory veſſels one for another, till at length all come to the belly and backe of man, euen his body, the centre of them all: For all is meate, and meate includeth medicine alſo. Now euery man hath in him the nature of all men, ſo that all men are but as one man, this one man is the ſperme or ſeede of the whole World, ſuperiour and inferiour nature, as the kernell containes the tree with all his branches, leaues, colours, vermiculations, fruits, &amp;c. &amp; as the ſperme of the liuing creature containeth the members, faculties, qualities, operations, &amp;c. of the creature from whoſe body it is propagated, and is by the vniuerſall fotures of the light, ſtarres, firmament, elements, &amp;c. produced into growth and perfection, which are but the vniuerſall preparatory inſtruments, which this ſperme vſeth and applyeth for the building vp of it ſelfe with the next foode or matter, which is apt to be adapted, and incorporated into the nature of it ſelfe: This matter or foode it onely deſireth. And ſo doth man alſo in his kinde. Of the animall and ſpirituall foode and appetite it is impertinent here to ſpeake. Therefore all the labour of man is for his mouth. The heauens, the elements, the creatures, worke, and prepare for him, by their influences, inclinations, appetites, for to ſatisfie and fill his appetite. Their mouthes are made for his mouth, their skinnes for his clothing, and building alſo is but a cloathing or couering. All things are for the neceſſities and delights of the body. In this reſpect alſo is he the Image of God, in that all things are for him, and he is for himſelfe, as concerning

the creatures. For all are ſeruants to him, but he is ſeruant to none: If he be, that is his degenerating, his curſe, his fall, his brutiſhneſſe: for he that ſerueth any thing, body, or bodily things, is a beaſt in that reſpect. But who almoſt now a dayes maketh not an Idoll of his body? therefore when we would be as gods, then are we euill beaſts, filthy beaſts. But bodily things are for the ſeruice of the body; the body for the ſpirit, and that for the Lord. Otherwiſe, as Ieremy ſaith; Euery man is a beaſt by his owne knowledge.
               
               
                  And yet the appetite is not filled. Or as the Hebrew ſignifieth; The ſoule is not filled. What the extent of mans appetite is, both perſonall, and bodily, may well appeare, by that which is already ſpoken, and alſo by the two examples following. The firſt is ſufficiently teſtified by the example of Alexander the Great, who was not contented with the poſſeſſion of the continent or Land, nor yet of the Sea, when he had heard Anaxagoras diſputing of the plurality of Worlds; and when he had conquered all, hee muſt needs be a god, pretending a title to heauen alſo. The appetite of man is not limitted to the materiall World, till he be transformed, or degenerated into the nature of a beaſt, which is when his light is fallen downe into the confuſed Chaos againe, the lees of his concupiſcence, which is vtter darkeneſſe. The ſecond is teſtified by the example of Heliogabalus, the monſtrous glutton, who was ſerued at one ſupper with ſeauen thouſand fiſhes, and fiue thouſand fowles, and had ſixe hundred bawdes and harlots following him in chariots, and gaue great rewards to him that could inuent any new pleaſure. Who is not an Alexander, and an Heliogabalus, if God ſuffer him to range? God hath alwayes permitted ſome to runne out into extremities of vice, as the Sodomites, that all men may ſee what horrible filth lyeth in the heart of euery man, which God reſtraineth for the preſeruation of man-kinde for his Elect ſake, otherwiſe the Diuell is come downe, and rideth vpon mans appetite. The appetite multiplyeth it ſelfe infinitely. For of all the millions of the liuing, among whom the World is diuided, euery one hath an appetite of all, which ſheweth it ſelfe in the vehemency, and extreamity of

mens ſtriuings, and aſpirings higher and higher, one roaring waue or billow beating forward another to ouerflow the banks, and to conuert all into ſea, if God had not limited their line, within which euery man is bounded, when hee hath inhiated, ſtriuen, and done what he can. His might ſhall neuer be to his moode. For God hath ſet hill againſt dale, and contrarily. But what the appetite of him that hath but one acre of ground to liue on, and but one wife, is in the nature and kinde thereof without outward reſtraint, or inward grace, and indeed both, plainely appeareth by theſe two examples, which may ſerue for all. Therefore all the labour of man is for his body and bodily ſtate, but the appetite is not filled.
               
               Moreouer, if the bodily appetite ſhould be ſatisfied with meate, drinke, apparrell, with the delights of the ſonnes of men, and pleaſures of the eyes; and that the perſonall appetite were alſo ſatisfied with honor and Soueraignty, which happened neither to Alexander, nor to Heliogabalus, nor to any naturall man; yet cannot the ſoule be ſatisfied with infinite worlds. For the food of the ſoule is not the world, but God in the world.
               The excellent beauty of Gods wiſedome ſhining forth in all things, enamoureth the ſoule with the loue thereof. And the more that a man knoweth, the more he thirſteth and longeth for knowledge. But this appetite is not filled, for it worketh on an infinite obiect, which cannot be comprehended nor contained in the ſoule, at leaſt, while it worketh by earthly organes. So that neither Alexander nor yet his Maſter Ariſtotle, nor Plato, Ariſtotles Maſter could be ſatisſied herewith. Their appetites could not be ſtanched. Hee that goeth about it, maketh God an Idoll, becauſe he limiteth the infinite. But if he be comprehended of any creature in heauen or earth, then is he limited. I conclude, though the appetite of the body ſhould be filled, yet the appetite of man could neuer be filled. Then full contentment or felicity is not to be found in this world, nor by this world, and the appetite that will not be filled with a little, ſhall neuer be filled, howſoeuer men commonly deceiue themſelues, thinking

that if they had but this, or that, they would ſet vp their reſt. Yea, euen as Diues would haue ſet vp his reſt, if he had gotten but one drop of water to quench his feruent thirſt. The truth is, the more fuell the fire hath, the more hot it burneth. But the ſpirit of Chriſt is the water that cooles this heate, and quencheth this thirſt, his body and blood ſatisfieth this hunger. When the appetite, the attractiue, retentiue, digeſtiue powers worke on this foode, the other becommeth an excretion or expulſion.
               But againe, though we enioy Chriſt and the kingdome of glory by faith, yet ſo long as we are here in the fleſh, wee haue not the full poſſeſſion thereof, 1. Ioh. 3. 1. and therefore deſire to be with him, 2 Cor. 5. 1. 2.
               To conclude; Neither the appetite of the brutiſh man, nor of the animall or carnall man, nor of the ſpirituall man is here filled. And what ſhal fill the vegetable man, or locomotiue tree, which deſireth not meat, drinke▪ cloathing, women, children, buildings, &amp;c. Eccle. 4. 8. And yet is there none end of his labour? Men now a dayes grow as thinne as Oakes begin to grow, and all is filled with brutes and vnprofitable vegetables.

               A Confirmation of his former propoſition concerning the inſufficiency, and weakeneſſe of earthly things, to ſatisfie the appetite in their vſe, figured by a prolepſis, and that by a Communication. What can the wiſe man doe more with theſe worldly things then the foole? And what can the rich man in all his abundance doe more with it, then the poore doth without it? The Hebrew is thus. What more excellent or better thing by them is to the wiſe man, then to the foole? and what other thing is to the poore, then to him that knoweth to walke before the liuing? Then to him that can put forth himſelfe, put himſelfe in preaſe, make a ſhew, or crackling noiſe, carry a good account for doing good vnto himſelfe, Pſal. 49. 18. This I thinke

the Hebrew directly intendeth. Neither the wiſe man by, his wiſedome, nor the rich man by his power, ſtrength and skill to order them for the beſt, can doe more with them then bring their bodies to the ground in the full period of their times. But this the foole and the poore doe as well as they, andwhen they are all in the graue, what difference is there of their bones? And if there were any, what is of their duſt? If the rich and the wiſe can do no more with them, then the poore and the fooliſh, then is there no ſtrength in riches to full contentation, or felicity.

                  Better is the ſight of the eyes, then the wandring of the deſire: This is alſo vanity and vexation of ſpirit.
               
               AN amplification of the former reaſon, further figured by another prolepſis, thus: Seeing that God hath giuen the earth and worldly goods to men for the ſuſtenance and pleaſures of the body, they are a bleſſing, and tokens of his loue, and the beholding of them with the eye, affordeth ſome contentment, and ſatisfieth the deſire of the ſoule.
               And although perfect happineſſe conſiſteth not therein, yet it is much better then a wandring deſire, which longeth after many things, and wanteth neceſſaries, which the body naturally calleth for, and prouoketh a man to ſeeke for, though he would neuer ſo much inforce himſelfe to reſtfull contentation. He that hath a good competency and ſufficiencie, to cheere his body with comfortable things, and to liue in good account and credit among the better ſort, is of a more ſtayed deſire, and hath loy in himſelfe aboue him that hath leſſe, and is alwayes wiſhing, complaining, crauing, &amp;c.
               
                  Anſ. Be it ſo, yet in theſe things that he poſſeſſeth, there is vanity and vexation of ſpirit. There is no ſoundneſſe but rottenneſſe. Miſery may be mitigated, but it can neuer be cured.

               A Confirmation of his iudgement, or cenſure deliuered in his former briefe anſwere, This is alſo vanity, &amp;c. by two arguments. The former whereof is drawne from the notation of mans name. That which hath beene (whatſoeuer it is for outward reſpects) is already named, and it is knowne that it is man. Nod

                     Prop. He that hath his name of the earth, is earthly, mortall, in bondage to corruption, miſerable, vaine.
                  
                     Aſſump. But man hath his name of the earth, the matter whereof he was formed; for Adam ſignifieth red earth, duſt, or mire: Therefore
                  Man is earthly, mortall, miſerable, &amp;c.
               
               Whether a man be wiſe, or fooliſh, rich, or poore, honorable or baſe, it mattereth not much. For it is enough to argue his vanitie, that he is Man, or Adam, of the earth, earthly, mire, duſt, the moſt miſerable of all creatures, ſubiect to infinite miſeries, as hath beene already ſhewed. For the beſt good being corrupted becommeth the worſt euill, from Lucifer to metals and ſtones. Neither may he contend with him that is mightier then he. Another argument drawne from the decree of God, who hath ſubdued him, and all things with him vnto vanitie, whereof he can by no meanes rid or free himſelfe. For a man to contend with God, who is more mightie that is, but to encreaſe vanitie, euen to adde madneſſe to folly.
               There are indeed that haue ſtriuen. 2 Mac. 9. 8. to exalt themſelues and to be happie men in their owne eyes, and opinions of all the people (for the contrarie opinion of one man breaketh this enforced deceitfull complacence) as Valer.

                  Craeſus thinking not onely himſelfe happie, but that all men alſo ſhould count him bleſſed, asked Solon who was the happie

man, to try what he would ſay; but when Solon preferred Tellus the Athenian, a priuate man, and Cl
                        •
                     obis and Bitus alſo, he was offended. But Solon anſwered him that he might he called rich and mightie, but not bleſſed till he had made an happie end. This curbed the vaine conceit of his fained, inforced felicitie. For ſuch like will needes draw the iudgements of all men after their owne, to deifie them, eyther by reward or reuenge, by fauour or diſpleaſure, by countenancing or diſgracing, &amp;c. So Mordecaies diſ-reuerence was the breaking of Hamans felicity, and Micahs prophecy of Ahabs. The Scriptures afford diuers examples hereof. But the greateſt ſhame, contempt, &amp; confuſion abideth on them that haue thus contended with God, 2 Mac. 9. 12. Act. 12. 23. and they are left for memorable examples of vanity till the worlds end. And ſo ſhall the great whore, that pompous ſcarlet whore of Babilon be trodden vnder foot, as vnſauorie ſalt, and ſwept away as doung in the end. This is a principle vttered by him that cannot lie, He that exalteth himſelfe, ſhall be brought lowe. But man in honour vnderſtandeth not, he is like the beaſts that periſh. All is, and muſt be vaine.
               Well, whatſoeuer vanity and vile abhomination of euill is in one man, is in the nature of all, and that which breaketh out of the skinne of one, lieth in the bones of another, though it neuer finde paſſage forth in ſuch meaſure, nor come to that height, as it hath ſometimes done in others, to be an euident and viſible document to all, of their vnknowne and vnfelt corruption. For God hath his hooke in their noſtrils, and they are kept as wilde beaſts in the grate, which being ſet at libertie ſoone ſhew whence they are bred. For all is but man. Nay, who almoſt forgets not himſelfe to be but man? and who is not a beautifull Idoll in his owne ſight? Who would not faine ſeeme to be a glorious man in the eyes of all, at leaſt in the eyes of all of his owneranke, equals, and inferiours, and ſo on forward infinitely, as paſſage lies open, and obſtacles are more and more remoued? Euen a beggar is proud of a better ragge, and a childe is proud of a toye, thinking himſelfe happie in compariſon of other children,

and would haue other children to praiſe, admire, bleſſe, and exalt him for his toye ſake, and to deiect, and vilifie themſelues in compariſon of him, yea, he taketh occaſion by his toye to ſhew forth not onely pride, but contempt, and crueltie. People in theſe dayes are huft-bubbles, tumorous excreſcences. They ſtriue much to make Idols of their bodies, they ſtretch out themſelues beyond their meaſure, and racke others to make their bodies pompous ſpectacles, they couer, and colour till their whole ſubſtance be turned into rottenneſſe within the ſhel, and all is to make a goodly ſhew, to be glorified of others, as they glorifie themſelues, and for that purpoſe glorifie others againe. But thou art ſtill but man, when thou haſt made of thy ſelfe what thou canſt. And why art thou proud O earth and aſhes! Thou doſt but contend with him that is mightier than thou. He will ſtill be exalted, and thou ſhalt be a beaſt. Euery one now ſtriueth to be a proud Iezabel, to be an Herod, a Nabuchadnezzar, to make a deceitfull ſhew, to affect the ſubtilties of Anti-chriſt, to bewitch others with their ſhewes, as Iezabel would haue bewitched Iehu. They are like the deuill to caſt phantaſmes before the eyes and mindes of men, (heare this ye fine beaſtlie women) yea, they conuert holy things to the ſeruice of their Idoll, and all too little. And why? becauſe man will needs inforce an happie ſtate, at leaſt in ſhew and account, vpon himſelfe. But this is vanitie, and ſhall end in miſerie. Bel, greedy Bel ſhall be ſtamped to powder, and Iezabel ſhall be dogs meat. And I pray God that our ſinnes turne not our yealow ſtarch into red.

               A Reaſon why man muſt not contend with God, but yeeld himſelfe to the acknowledgement, and confeſſion of vanitie; to depend on the commandement and mercie of God. Seeing there be many things that increaſe vanitie,
                  
                  what is man the better? The hebrew is, ſeeing that, when as becauſe much is belonging to things, or is of things increaſing, or, that doe increaſe vanitie, what is there more to man? That is to ſay, ſeeing that the more things that a man hath and dealeth withall, the more that he intangles himſelfe in, beateth his braines, and br
                     ••
                  keth his body about, the more vanities, and vexations he enwrappeth himſelfe in, what is he better than he that ſitteth ſtill? Nay, doth he not moſt often by his wit worke out his woe? and by his ſtrength procure his owne ruine? Therefore let not a man in pride and preſumption ſeeke to breake out from vnder the yoke of God. Rom. 8. 20. forgetting himſelfe to be but man; but rather humble himſelfe to the right way, and meanes of freedome which God continually ſoundeth in his eares. If by mortification he hath entred in at the ſtrait gate, let him keepe ſtill in the narrow way, which few doe, leaſt his Chriſtian profeſſion proue but a vaile to couer and colour paganiſme, yea atheiſme. To conclude, as worldly things are multiplied, ſo is vanity with them. It is but an addition and more vniuerſall mixture of vanities, to bring forth greater and more miſeries. For the deeper that a man wadeth, the more ſhall he be wet.

                  For who knoweth what is good for man in this life, all the dayes of his vaine life, which he ſpendeth as a ſhadow? for who can tell a man what ſhall be after him vnder the Sunne?
               
               THis verſe containeth a confirmation of the former reaſon, why that a man medling with great and many matters, is nothing the better, figured by a communication to inculcate the certaintie thereof. No man knowes what is good for a man in this life, all the dayes of his vaine life. Life is amplified, firſt by an emmeration of the leaſt particles of time concluded in the generall [all the dayes] Secondly, by the adiunct, vaine, Vanitie▪ is illuſtrated by a compariſon, it paſſeth
                  
                  away as a ſhadow. The time of life is but a day, which is diuided into morning, noone and euening. The ſhadow is longeſt in the morning, and it doth nothing but vaniſh till noone, where it ſeemeth to make a ſtand, but doth not, but by increaſing it vaniſheth quite away. If the ſhadow grow ſhorter, time ſpends, if it grow longer time alſo ſpends: ſo is the time of life a continuall ſpending, as the Snaile that continually waſteth her ſelfe. Now in this fleeting time, who can tell what is good for a man, ſeeing that man, and all things with him vaniſh away like a ſhadow? Againe, as there is no conſtancie of dayes, in regard of their naturall qualitie and diſpoſition, but are variable and contrarie, ſo neither is there of the ſtate of man in the decourſe of his life: Euery day bringeth new trauels, new cares, new troubles, alterations, and changes, and euery one is doubtfull and fearefull of after times. And this is a vanitie.
               Againe, euery man ſeeth his imprudence, and manifold errors, committed in the dayes that are paſt; he ſeeth his inconſiderate courſes, his ouer-ſights, the weakeneſſe of his vnderſtanding and iudgement, in contriuing things to the beſt, for which he vexeth himſelfe with griefe and anger all his life after, and ſo recompenceth vanitie with vanitie. Againe, when he ſeeketh to redreſſe that which hath beene amiſſe by a new and better courſe, he falleth rather into greater errours, as hee that is in a maze, or vaſt deſart. Therefore neither can a man himſelfe, who is beſt knowne to himſelfe, tell what is good for him, neither can any other man. For who can tell a man what ſhall be after him? A confirmation of the former. No man can tell what is good for a man throughout the whole courſe of his life, ſeeing that life is vaine, and euery day of life is vaine. But why cannot a man tell what is good for a man? Becauſe that he that cannot tell what ſhall be after a man, either in after times of life, or when he is dead, cannot tell what is good for a man to doe for the preſent; but the former can no man doe, neither can he doe the latter. If a man could tell what would be cheape, what deare, he would be rich in a yeere. But God

hath left that in his owne power, that all mans courſes might be vaine and fooliſh, 1 Macc. 6. 8. So that when hee hath ſtriuen all his dayes with vehemency of body and minde, the ſimple man that ſat ſtill, hath gotten the prize. Therefore ſeeing that no man can tell what ſhall be, he cannot tell what is good for him, whether to doe this, or that, whether to take this courſe, or that, whether the obtaining of his preſent deſires ſhall turne to his good, or greater euill; 1 Macc. 6. 11. Luke 12. 20. He knoweth not the iſſue, or euent of any thing: For all is in the hands of God, who doth all that men may feare before him, and denying themſelues, caſt themſelues wholly vpon him.
            
         
         
            CHAPTER VII.
            
               
                  Verſe 1. 
                  A good name is better then precious oyntment; and the day of death, then the day of ones birth.
               
               
                  
                     SOlomon hath hitherto declared the vanity of all worldly things in the laſt Chapter, of riches that occaſion the deſtruction of the owner, of riches loſt by caſualties, and leauing their owner deſtitute and miſerable of riches without grace to vſe them, of the multitude of children, of long life, of the inſufficiency of riches to ſatisfie mans deſire, of their weakeneſſe to benefit one more then another, of their vncertaine euent; Chap. 5. Now in this Chapter he ſheweth the vanities of this life by degrees, by comparing them with other things that are better for men then the beſt or moſt pleaſing things, though to the carnall man it may ſeeme otherwiſe, and in their owne kinde are ſo indeede.
               And his maine ſcope herein, is to ſet downe thoſe better things for certaine remedies, whereby to auoide thoſe vanities of life, or to extenuate and mittigate them, and to gather what good may redound to man by the right ordering

of himſelfe in the things of this life. This he principally intendeth, and the demonſtration of vanities leſſe principally or by conſequence in this Chapter. Moreouer, the auoyding, or extenuating of theſe vanities, is not all that hee aimeth at, but alſo the right meaning of that ioyfull and comfortable vſe of riches, whereof he ſpake before, Chap. 5. 18. &amp; 2. 24. For this gift of vſing riches, is not terminated in the welfare and complacence of the fleſh, as the Heathen imagine, but for a further grace here intimated, in that thoſe things that are contrary to the pleaſure of the fleſh, are preferred aboue all. This I take to be the counſell and direct intendment of Solomon here.
               
                  A good name is better then precious ointment. Concerning the coherence of theſe words with the former; They are an anſwer to an obiection vpon occaſion of his laſt words eſpecially, to wit, that the increaſe of worldly goods was nothing but a multiplication of vanities, and that no man could know what is good for him in this vaine life. The obiection may be thus framed. If there be nothing good for a man here, but all is vanity, and the more that hee ſeeketh to ridde himſelfe of infelicity by wiſedome and trauell, and to obtaine wealth and honour, by ſo much the more vanity is increaſed, yea, and that there is no good to be had, nor knowne in this life; then is there nothing but matter of deſpaire in this life, and better it is for a man to depriue himſelfe of life, then to prolong it in miſery, eſpecially when hope of better faileth. Anſw. Although that God hath ſubdued all things to vanity, and all the wiſedome and ſtudies of men to folly, yet that is not driftly to torture man with deſpaire, and to deſtroy his creature, but to bring him to faith and obedience, to know, to feare, and obey his Creatour. For if man of pride, and preſumption, will needes exalt himſelfe, and coyne a felicity or glorious ſtate here in the World, to make a petty god of himſelfe, he ſhall in the iſſue and vpſhot find all to be but vanity, and himſelfe a foole, and a beaſt. And all men naturally doe thus. Gen. 3. 5. 6. There is the ſpawne, or beginning, that hath ouer-ſpread all generations of the World.

Therefore God hath ſubiected all things to vanitie, out of which a man can by no meanes extricate himſelfe, but rather by ſtriuing runne further in. But yet ſeeing that there is an happie ſtate of man here begunne, which a man is to deſire and ſeeke for, in God, (not in worldy things) and euen that in this vaine life, which in that reſpect is not vaine, there are certaine ſalues for theſe ſores, and remedies for theſe vanities: Solomon therefore, that he might take away from men diſcontentment, and diſpaire of their eſtate, doth here deliuer rules of direction and comfort, that they may haue wherewith to arme themſelues againſt the troubles and miſeries of this vaine life, and in ſome good meaſure be able to alay and mitigate the ſame, which God laid vpon Adam, and all his ſonnes, for a iuſt puniſhment of his fall.
               The firſt rule or remedy is in this firſt verſe: A good man. A good reputation or report, being the teſtimony of good men, of the vertuous life &amp; honeſt conuerſation of a man, is a ſpeciallbleſſing of God, arming the heart with great ioy and comfort againſt many, yea, all outward loſſes, and want of bodily things. The excellencie of a good name is illuſtrated by a compariſon of the beſt and moſt delicious things, ſignified by ointment, by a Synecdoche of the Speciall. The compariſon is both of the qualitie and quantitie. Firſt, concerning the qualitie: euen as the pretious ointment hath a fragrant ſcent refreſhing and delighting the ſpirits of the ſenſes, whereby the body and minde is cheered; ſo a good name and deſerued eſtimation is of all outward things the moſt pleaſant poſſeſſion, comporting the heart in euery ſtate of life: For it originally proceedeth from a good conſcience, and is the perfume of a godly and faithfull heart, yea, hee that hauing a great meaſure of the annointing of God, which is the graces of his ſpirit, to be a patterne to the rude, a light to the blinde, a guide to them that know not the way, doth alſo refreſh, encourage, and cheare the ſpirits and hearts of all that loue God, and his truth among the filthy ſents of corrupt examples, fleſhly faſhions, and ethnicall behauiours, that are noyſome and grieuous to the eyes,

eares, and mindes of men of gracious diſpoſition, and as a freſh gale of ſweet ayre to him that laboureth in the earth, that liueth among earthly men.
               Concerning the quantity, the argument is from the leſſe to the greater.
               A precious oyntment is of great value, a chiefe treaſure, and eſteemed with the moſt precious things, but a good name is of more worth then it, or any earthly ſubſtance. For coſtly oyntments, and other treaſures are of times more plentifull among the wicked: For the ſenſuall are all for their ſences, but this is peculiar to good men alone. They may be bought for money, but this is the gift of God, not to be purchaſed with baſe mettall. They are corruptible, this is euerlaſting. They leaue a man in death, and betake them to a new maſter, but the praiſe of the iuſt man remaineth ſtill, and ſtill, his owne. It both tarrieth behinde him on earth, and goeth with him to heauen, and will crowne him with glory at the laſt day. For although it be darkened for a time amongſt the goates, as Naboth was, as Pauls and Dauids, yet ſhall it breake forth as the rayes of the Sunne from vnder a cloud. It may be couered, but it cannot be polluted with vnclean tongues, yet it becommeth more bright as mettall rubbed with duſt or myre. Whereas contrarily, the falſe and forced praiſe of ſinners that are prone and ambitious, turneth to their greater ſhame, as that of Herod, Senacherib, and the Phariſees did. And ſo ſhall Antichriſts doe, as did that of Antiochus.
               
               
                  And the day of death, then the day of ones birth. Theſe words are a ſecond rule, to arme the man that feareth God againſt temporall miſeries. Concerning their dependence vpon the former, they are an anſwere to an obiection framed thus: A good report in this life affords little comfort, ſeeing that death commeth after it, which is the miſerable end of all men.
               
                  Anſ. The day of death is better then the day that one is borne. It is better then the time of life, and the tranſitory things of life. Yea, it is better then a good report it ſelfe,

becauſe it is a comfort to extenuate the afflictions of life, but this vtterly aboliſheth all vanities. The birth-day is an entrance into all woe and miſery, but the day of death is a paſſage into life. The body is but a priſon and a racke to the ſoule, but by death it is ſet at liberty: For by death are all miſeries ended, all dangers, paines, aches, diſeaſes, ſorrowes, teares, and that grieuous warre and conflict of concupiſcence, or fleſhly luſts, 1 Pet. 2. 11. doubtings, vnbeleefe, feares, pride, ignorance, couetouſneſſe, ambition, enuy, hatred, luſt, which fight againſt the ſoule, are dead, from which Paul ſo earneſtly deſired to be freed, Romans 7. 24. 2 Cor. 12. 8.
               Againe, by death a man is freed from euils to come, Eſay 57. 1. He is deliuered from the weariſome company of petulcus goates▪ 
                  Pſal. 120. 5. 1 King. 19. 4. and from the aſſaults of Sathan, yea from all fightings within and without, to reſt, and raigne in glory with Chriſt, and the bleſſed company of heauen: This of the rule or remedy principally aymed at. Now for the ſequele or collection concerning vanity, the argument from hence is thus. If the day of death, which to carnall reaſon is miſerable, be better then the day of birth, ſurely this life is a thing moſt vaine. But ſo it is.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 2. 
                  It is better to goe to the houſe of mourning, then to goe to the houſe of feaſting: for that is the end of all men, and the liuing will lay it to heart.
               
               A Second rule or remedy whereby a man is armed againſt the vanities of life, is mortification, which is the ſuppreſſing of ſinne, and curbing of the motions of ſinne in the heart ſimply, becauſe it diſpleaſeth God, and is the onely thing whereby he is diſhonoured. Other mortifications are but either philoſophicall, or ciuill, or ſubtle; the firſt whereof is of naturall conſcience, the ſecond of vaine glorious diſpoſition, the third of a diuelliſh heart. But this is wrought onely by the Spirit of God, who is a purifying fire, and purging

ſoape; Mal. 3. 2. 3. not onely reſtraining and bridling, but conſuming ſinne. This conſumption beginneth at the heart, Ier. 4. 4. Breake vp your fallow grounds, circumciſe the fore-skinne of your heart. If mortification beginne not here, it is guilefull; Pſal. 32. 2. He is bleſſed whoſe ſpirit is not guilefull, though he be ſubiect to many infirmities. Now that this rule may be operatiue, and of force, Solomon ſetteth downe the meanes and courſes that are to be taken, whereby to produce and nouriſh it, for the comfort of the ſoule, in this vale of miſery. The gift is of God, from whom euery good ſeede of grace proceedeth; the other are but artificiall, imitatiue, and coyned: yet this ſeede of God groweth not but by planting &amp; watering, as all other ſeeds doe, and that is the vſe of the meanes. The meanes therefore of the growth and increaſe of this grace, Solomon here ſetteth downe, illuſtrating the ſame by a compariſon of the contrary vanities, and they are foure, in the foure next verſes.
               The firſt meanes of mortification, are the outward prouocations thereunto, to wit, ſuch places, and companies whereby that good ſeede of grace that lyeth in the heart may be preſerued and increaſed. For euery ſeede muſt haue his proper place, and outward foture of warmth and moiſture to concoct it to perfection, which Saint Paul calleth, Rigation. 1 Cor. 3. 6. It is better to goe to the houſe of mourning, to viſit the ſorrowfull, and ſad in heart, to goe to the graue of the dead, to frequent the companies of mourners, to weepe with them; then to goe to the houſe of feaſting, where there is ſinging, dancing, merriment, vanity, and prouocations to vanity moſt commonly. For that is the end of all men. A confirmation of this rule, or reaſon of the compariſon, by the antitheſis, or contrarietie of the adiuncts. The adiuncts of the banqueting houſe, are not expreſſed, but vnderſtood by anantapod
                        •
                     ſts; The former are death and mourning: for there is the end of all men.
               
               Let a man feed, pride, and beautifie his body as he will, yea, as moſt doe now a dayes make an Idoll of it, yet ſhall it be a dead carkeis buried in the earth, as other dead carrion is,

and more vile then other. Bonum optimum corruptum fit peſſimum. The more compoſition the more corruption, as in riches increaſed there is more vanity. So that if it muſt needs be an idoll, yet ſhall it be but a carrion idoll, and ſuch are all they that adore it in feaſts and pompous meetings, as did the Phariſees.
               Againe, let a man put away all remembrance of death out of his heart, to ſource himſelfe in the fleſh, to boyle in pleaſure, ſeeking out companions, and prouocations of luſt, (which are planters and waterers alſo in their weedy kinde) yet ſhall it be turned in the end to lamentation and mourning, vnleſſe that curſe be laid on a mans death, that none ſhall mourne for him, but rather eate him vp, as the dogges did Iezabel, one worrying another for his goods and lands, and the wicked poore roaring like greedy Lions for his fleſh, that care not who dye, nor how many, ſo that their bellies be filled.
               
                  And the lining will lay it to heart. A reaſon or proofe of the conſecution of the former argument, which was this:
               If in the houſe of mourning there be the end of all men, then it is better to goe thither, then to the houſe of feaſting.
               But the antecedent is true.
               Therefore the conſequent alſo.
               The reaſon of the conſequence is, the liuing ſhall lay it to heart. Theſe words ſhew the effect of death and mourning, (which are termed, the end of all men) namely, a ſerious meditation of the ſtate, and condition of man. All men are apt to forget themſelues to be but men, ſpecially in their feaſtings, and iolity, iouil
                     •
                  y, and ribaldry; but this end of all men, and them being expoſed to the ſenſes, eyes, and eares, doth occaſion them to remember whence they came, what they are, whether they are to goe. So then this ſerious meditation or remembrance, is the effect of the impulſiue cauſe. For by the dead corpes and mourning, a man is occaſioned to remember himſelfe. The inward impulſiue or precedent, is the gracious diſpoſition of the heart, to take ſuch good occaſions, or ſuffer himſelfe to be moued therewith: for the

wicked heart is ſtony, brawny, without remorſe, full of infidelity; therefore hee maketh this contrarily an occaſion of more epicuriſh and ſenſuall liuing, yea, at this time ſeruing his belly and his luſts, as hee that cutteth purſes euen before the bench. And the eye of the foole is mindleſſe, wandring in the corners of the earth. The outward impulſiue, I ſay, is the occaſion, to wit, the dead corpes and mourning, the houſe of mourning, and the graue of the dead. What is a man by this occaſion moued to lay to his heart?
               I. His owne death, for euen ſo muſt he die, and be mourned for of his wife, children, kinsfolkes, &amp;c. caſt into the graue, and be putrified in the earth.
               II. The vanity of all worldly things, whereof a man is now quite beſtript, as lands, goods, buildings, cloathing, treaſures, skinne, body, and all are cleane ſliuen off from the ſoule, as barke from a tree, and as a ſhell from the fiſh, and the ſoule is gone naked, as the body came in naked, either to be glorified in heauen for the good deeds that it did in the fleſh with worldly things, or to be confounded and tormented in hell for the euill.
               III. Of the account or reckoning, that it muſt make before the iuſt Iudge of the talent, that God gaue it to employ with diligence to his beſt aduantage.
               IIII. Of repentance and continuall preparation to death, by auoiding euill, whereby his Lord is indammaged, and by doing good, ſetting euery thing in order euery day, and diſpoſing all things to the beſt for the profit of his Lord, that when he commeth, hee may receiue his owne with aduantage.
               Theſe and ſuch things doth he lay to his heart, that hath an heart, when hee goeth to the houſe of mourning, and commeth to the graue of the dead. The ſequell, or argument of vanity gathered by the compariſon, is this:
               
                  
                     Prop, If it be better to goe to the houſe of mourning, then to the houſe of feaſting, then are all merry meetings, iuncatings, playes, games, ſports, paſtimes, &amp;c. vaine and

vnprofitable and no quietneſſe of heart to be found in them.
                  
                     Aſſump.But the antecedent is thus; therefore the conſequent.
               
            
            
               
                  Verſe 3. 
                  Sorrow is better then laughter; for by the ſadneſſe of the countenance, the heart is made better.
               
               A Second meanes of mortification, is ſorrow or anger, which is a godly indignation or griefe, for our ſinnes committed, and duties omitted. This ſorrow goeth before repentance, and worketh repentance. It is that which Saint Paul commendeth in the Corinthians, occaſioned by his reprehenſory letter 2 Cor. 7. 10. 11. where it is ſet downe by ſeauen effects in them.
               1 Carefullneſſe or diligence in reforming their errours, and in conforming themſelues againe to that purity, which was wrought in them, when at firſt he preached the Goſpell to them in the euidence of the ſpirit, from which they were declined through the Philoſophicall ianglings of the falſe Apoſtles.
               2 Clearing of themſelues, or defence [
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ] which was a deprecatory excuſe of their errours, which kinde of defence intimateth an ingenuous confeſſion together with ſome alleadgement for themſelues, to inſinuate that they had done amiſſe, rather of infirmitie then wittingly and willingly, and ſo were ready to be reformed, which thing muſt needs pacifie Pauls mind, and moue him to commend them rather, ſeeing that to erre is humane frailty, but to acknowledge and reforme an errour is grace. So that this defence is an excuſation including confeſſion, deprecation, reformation.
               3 Indignation, when a man grieueth at his folly, impudence, and careleſſeneſſe, that he ſhould be ſo or ſo ouertaken and miſled, whereby to diſpleaſe God, to offend his brother, to burthen his owne conſcience, and to giue aduantage to the aduerſary.
               
                  
4 Feare, which is a ſence of Gods diſpleaſure, for ſome ſinne committed. This remorſe bringeth repentance. It is contrary to the ſeruile feare of an euill conſcience with hardneſſe of heart, and to worldly feares.
               5 
                     Ʋehement deſire, namely to ſeeke for, and to obtaine the fauour of God, that they might reioyce in his grace againe, as they did at their firſt conuerſion, for by ſinning we grieue the ſpirit of God, and cauſe him to frowne on vs, whoſe preſence and countenance we earneſtly deſire to be turned, towards vs againe, as he that through vnkind dealing, hauing almoſt loſt his beſt friend, ſeeketh earneſtly to recouer the fulneſſe of his former loue, which thing is plainely exemplified in Dauid, Pſal. 51.
               6 Zeale, which is a feruent indeauour to repentance. It is mixt of loue, and anger, or rather here, of deſire and indignation or ſorrow, which is all one.
               7 Reuenge, which is a chaſtening and curbing of our ſelues vpon conſideration of Gods diſpleaſure, that we may preuent his iudgements, and winne his fauour againe, 1 Cor. 11. 30. 31. The whole verſe laboureth on a gradation. By the expoſition of this verſe it fully appeareth what the ſorrow or indignation is that Solomon here ſpeaketh of. The meaning of the words are, better is a ſad and thoughtfull heart, cauſed by remorſe and grudge of conſcience, tending to repentance, and amendment of life, then a light heart and variable mind hauing no ſerious conſideration of ſinne, nor of Gods iudgements in this life, nor after this life impreſſed in it, but ſeeketh rather to extinguiſh both, the more freely to laugh and be fat.
               
                  For by the ſadneſſe of the countenance, &amp;c. A confirmation by the effect. This ſorrow of the heart appearing in the firme and ſad countenance maketh the heart more ioyfull, and pleaſant. For as heat expelleth heat, ſo doth godly and penitent ſorrow expell feare, trouble and deſpaireful doubtings which oppreſſe the heart as an heauy weight. The reprobate cannot expell this ſeruile ſorrow with penitent or gracious ſorrow, but by other falſe remedies ſeeketh to mitigate

and alay the rigour, as Diues would haue cooled his heate with a drop of water, but one drop of grace in life, would haue done more then an Ocean of waters in hell. The wicked would be eaſed of torment, but they will giue no glory to God, like the nine lepers, whether they be liuing or dead, they are all for themſelues. If Diues would as earneſtly haue craued but for one drop of grace when he was liuing to haue killed the worme in her breeding, his thirſt ſhould haue beene quenched. But being giuen to the bellie, and bodily pleaſures, he loued not ſorrow, nor repentance, but applied falſe remedies to the worme, laughter and fatneſſe. He loued not the rebukes of the wiſe, but ſuch as were skilfull to feede his humors. Theſe words may alſo be expounded thus. By the ſad countenance and ſober behauiour the hearts of one another are made better, vaine fancies and luſtfull thoughts are checked and curbed, ſinfull words and euill deeds following them are preuented. The ſequell or argument of vanitie gathered by the compariſon, is as before, and ſo throughout the Chapter.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 4. 
                  The heart of the wiſe is in the houſe of mourning: but the heart of fooles is in the houſe of mirth.
               
               A Third meanes of mortification is ſober conuerſation. The heart of the wiſe, &amp;c. As there is ſorrow and remorſe in the heart and conſcience of the wiſe, ſo there is ſadneſſe in the countenance, and alſo ſober behauiour, ſober apparrell, and ſober compaine. The heart of the wiſe man is affected to ſuch places and companies as he may haue benefit by to his edification in knowledge, and godlineſſe. Such things he loueth to heare, to ſpeake, and to relate as may make both himſelfe and others the better, Prou. 15. 30. Good hearing maketh his bones fat, (and ſo of the ſeeing alſo.) The heart of him that hath vnderſtanding ſeeketh knowledge, that is, moueth his lippes, eyes and eares to ſeeke for increaſe of that holy wiſedome, wherewith he is in ſome good meaſure

already indued. For to him that hath ſhall be giuen. Therefore he is ready alſo to frequent the houſes of mourning (a ſynecdoche of the ſpeciall) and the ſocietie of mourners, ſuch as are well acquainted with the croſſe, exerciſed in temptations, and men of ſober carriage, whereby he receiueth more comfort and eaſe of heart, than by all feſtiuall and merry meetings, where there is commonly vanity enough, and matter of griefe to him that ſeriouſly thinketh on his latter end, and the account of euery idle word. As the nature and kinde of the ſeede and roote is, ſuch like is the ſappe and ſhape of the tree, ſuch or ſuch places it deſires to grow in, and among ſuch or ſuch other trees. If it hath place and companie according to his liking, than it proſpereth, flouriſheth and reioyceth, if not, yet it liueth, brancheth and fructifieth though poorely, as the willow in the forreſt, the hyſ

                  p on the wall, wheat in light ſand, and rapes in ſtiffe clay. Euery thing deſireth his proper place and company, with other fotures according to his kinde, to attaine the perfection, and flouriſhing ſtate of his kinde, which thing if it cannot doe, yet is it prudent and ſhiftie, and will reape the moſt commoditie to it ſelfe that may be, without any loſſe through improuidence and negligence: But if it be in a ſo

                  ered by the qualitie of his food or humour, &amp;c. yet will it retaine the kinde, or elſe dye. The ſeed or root of man is his heart, as the heart or ſpirit of man is, ſuch is the man. Mens c

                     uſque, is eſt quiſque. And though of all creatures he be moſt variable, and can perſonate himſelfe infinite wayes, yet doth his ſpirit incline him one way. The Adamant in the diall is fickle, &amp; it is vncertaine, what coaſt it moſt affecteth, or rather what his naturall poſition is, being violently agitated; but when diſturbance ceaſeth, it reſteth on the north-pole. So, foxe to the kinde. A wiſe mans heart is his

                  oote, and ſuch like are his thoughts, countenance, words, workes, carriage. And as the man in his kinde, nature, and diſpoſition is, ſuch ſoile he re

grow in, ſuch things he loues to heare by voyce or writings, ſuch companies he frequenteth, this he extracteth, that he reiecteth, as his ſpirit is. For the body of a common▪wealth is as it were a mixture of all kindes, or a Choas, from whence euery ſpirit may gather matter of edification and corruption: As the frame of his heart is, ſo may he adapt matter of perfection or deſtruction. But the wiſe heart vſeth all things, and turneth all things to the beſt.
               
                  But the heart of fooles is in the houſe of mirth. An illuſtration of the former by the contrarie. This heart is of a contrarie ſappe, of contrarie affection, and diſpoſition, and as inwardly, ſo outwardly contrarie. Such ſoyles it loueth, and ſuch fotures as are agreeable to his kinde, ſo doth euery beaſt, euery weed, euery plant. Such lips, ſuch lettuce: And wilde things accord not well with the tame. And though they be tamed, yet are they troubleſome. The ſpirit of policie curbeth and driueth the ſnaile into her ſhell, but the ſpirit of God renueth. The foole ſeeketh for nouriſhments of his follie, ſuch counſels ſuch bookes, ſuch hearing, examples and companies, and ripeneth his follie. The foole is but a body, and his ſoule is but as ſa

If he be among the wiſe, and heare the words of the wiſe, the beſt things he reiecteth (light is not comprehended of darkeneſſe) other things he miſconſtrueth, and conuerts into follie. If hee heare or ſee infirmitie, or vani

The dainty tooth deſireth delicates, ſo doth the foole all things that may feed his beaſtly luſts. Therefore let the wiſe be wary for giuing offence, and abſtaine from appearances of euill, elſe will the foole by occaſion of his follie runne mad. Therefore ſaith Solomon, anſwere a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe, and anſwere not a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe. Let thine anſwere curbe, not cheriſh his follie.

               THe fourth meanes of mortification, which is the way to true felicity, is the rebuke of the wiſe, that is to ſay, it is better for a man to ſubmit himſelfe to the admonitions, and wholſome reproofes of the wiſe, then to be praiſed and flattered of fooles. Wiſedome ſaith to the ſimple, Pro. 1. 23. Turne you at my correction, you that haue erred from the way of truth, and prodigally waſted your ſelues: But the fooliſh deſpiſe her counſels, her admonitions, her corrections, the ſtubborne foole will abide no touch, verſe 25. The wiſe man will loue him that reproueth him, but the foole is prouoked to wrath. The wiſe childe is better than the old King that will not be admoniſhed. Dauid deſired rather to be ſmitten of the righteous, than to eate ſuch things as pleaſe the wicked, becauſe the rebukes of the wiſe are as pretious balmes. Better it is to be rebuked of the wiſe for a mans errors, than to be praiſed of the wicked for pleaſing their humours. Than for a man to heare the ſong of fooles. An illuſtration of the former by the contrarie. The ieaſting, merrie conceits, and fleſhpleaſing talke of the vngodly, corrupteth the mindes of the hearers, and ſtealeth ſober thoughts out of their hearts, to ſettle them on their dregges, at leaſt for the preſent, and is a meanes to quicken and reuiue thoſe head-ſuppreſt reliques of concupiſcence that are mortified in them, as the fire reuiueth the ſnake that is almoſt dead with cold. The foole footheth and flattereth a man in euill, and to euill. He extenuateth and vilifieth euery grace of God, he excuſeth madneſſe, and imbraceth follie, which is ciuill wickedneſſe. Yet he hath many good words, and ſheweth wit, but all is to clothe vertue with the contemptible rags of vice, and to clothe vice with the robes of vertue. His good words are but as the ſcripture in the Deuils mouth, Mat. 4. 6. he defileth them, but they purifie not him. Therefore, whether a foole be merrie or ſober, angry or pleaſed, hee is

grieuous to the wiſe, but the wiſe ſheweth wiſedome in both. His words are ſeaſoned with ſalt. Hee is gracious and louely.

                  For as the crackling of thornes vnder a pet, ſo is the laughter of the foole: this alſo is vanitie.
               
               A Reaſon of the compariſon, why that the rebuke of the wiſe is better than the ſong of fooles. It is illuſtrated by a ſimilitude of thornes crackling vnder a pot. Euen as thornes vnder a pot make a loud noiſe, and flaſh forth into a great flame, but the noiſe ſuddenly ceaſeth, and the flame is preſently quenched: ſo vaine-glorious fooles, and epicuriſh fooles, enemies to ſober wiſedome and grace, make a pompous ſhew for the time, drawing all mouthes and eares, and eyes after them, as though they were the onely happie ones; but it is but a noiſe and flaſh of vanitie, Moreouer as the crackling of thornes is a vaine ſound, offenſiue, and harſh to the eare, and of no regard, ſo is the laughter of a foole, laughing at his owne wicked fantaſies, grieuing the wiſe with his turbulent noiſe.
               The ſequele or collection concerning vanitie is this, if rebukes and checks be better than mirth and pleaſant companions, and delicious, and voluptuous life, then is that pleaſurable kinde of life but vaine, &amp;c▪

                  Surely oppreſſion maketh a wiſe man mad: and a gift deſtroyeth the heart.
               
               A Third rule or remedy, whereby a man is armed againſt the miſeries or vanities of this life is patience. Patience is a voluntary &amp; continuall ſuſtaining &amp; bearing of euils and euill men, the more freely to ſhew &amp; bring forth the fruits of the ſpirit, for the comfort of our owne hearts, and the increaſe of our aſſurance, and for the conuerſion of the wicked our enemies. For in contending with the wicked in their kinde (otherwiſe the righteous contendeth with them) and

reuenging of our wrongs, wee ſhall obſcure the graces of God, and fall into the ſame miſchiefe, and condemnation with them, which thing the enemies of grace deſire. This remedy is ſet downe in the foure next verſes. The Analyſis whereof I take to be this. Patience is firſt illuſtrated by a compariſon of the contrary, to wit, impatience, expreſſed by the fountaine or cauſe thereof (pride of heart) verſe 8. Impatience is deſcribed, firſt by the effects, verſe 7. Secondly, by the euent, verſe 8. Moreouer, patience is amplified by a dehortation, verſe 9. and figured by a prol
                        •
                     pſis, verſe 10.
               This verſe then is a deſcription of impatience, or the proud ſpirit, by the effects thereof, oppreſſion, and peruerting of the Law. Oppreſſion ſtandeth in racking, wronging, reuenging. Surely oppreſſion maketh a wiſe man mad. As a mad man is without the vſe of reaſon, being violently carried with a corrupt humour, ſaying, and doing nothing from any ground of good vnderſtanding, but according to the multitude of broken and confuſed phantaſmes, cauſed by the diſtemper of blood: euen ſo the wiſe being carried with inordinate affections and luſts, to wrong, oppreſſe, reuenge, and catch from euery man to grind the face of euery man, in lending and betting, to wreſt the Law for aduantage, bewrayeth not onely fooliſhneſſe, but madneſſe, harming himſelfe, and miſchieuing others, as other mad men doe. The difference betweene them ſtandeth onely in this, that the one is but a bodily madneſſe, cauſed moſt often through the ſuperfluity of an humour, the other is ſpirituall, inſpired and incenſed of the Diuell. That is in the blood, this is in the heart: that is brutall, this is diuelliſh; that is common to all, this peculiar to the children of the Diuell: that hath not reaſon, this vſeth not reaſon, or rather that cannot vſe reaſon, this will not vſe reaſon.
               Finally, there is a ſpirituall frenzineſſe in fleſhly ſobriety. Theſe are Sathans wildings, whom he hath blinded, and ſo rideth them at his pleaſure. They are taken of him at his will▪ as the Apoſtle ſaith. The propoſition is amplified by a vehement aſſeu
                     •
                  ration, (Surely). And a gift deſtroyeth the
                  
                  heart. This is another effect of impatience, peruerting of the Law for bribes: In Deut. 16. 19. A gift blindeth the eyes of the wiſe, and peruerteth the words of the righteous; that is, either the words of him that elſe would iudge righteouſly, or the matters of the innocent, for the Hebrew word Dabar, ſignifieth indifferently both, and both are one. Here it is ſaid, a gift deſtroyeth the heart, corrupteth the heart, taketh away the heart, all are one. Who is ſo blind as he that will not ſee? And ſo fooliſh as he that wil not vnderſtand? What heart is more corrupt then that which condemneth it ſelfe in that which it alloweth, or rather condemneth it owne thefe, in giuing ſentence vpon anothers? yea, which preſſeth it ſelfe to death, in giuing ſentence of death, or abſoluing another from death? And what words more peruerſe then thoſe of Iudas, Quid mihi dabitis? What will ye giue me, and I will betray the innocent into the hands of his cruell aduerſaries? When the Magiſtrates eyes are blinded, then is he led by the ſtring of the briber, and the briber by the ſtring of the Diuell, and they both fall into the ditch. As the ſight of the Apple deſfroyed the heart of Eue; ſo the ſight, or feeling of a bribe, deſtroyeth the heart of the wiſe, that knoweth the Law, and diſcerneth iudgement. Our firſt Parents for an apple loſt Paradiſe, and woon hell; ſo euery child of Adam, like Eſau, for a ſweet bit will ſell his ſoule to the Diuell, and his brother to a lying bribing thiefe, yea, partake with the thiefe, as Iudas did with the Phariſees, and all for a bit. We, wiſer children, thinke that it was a great folly in our firſt Parents, that hauing ſo much, and ſo much choyce of other fruits, would notwithſtanding taſte of the forbidden ſruit, without any neede at all. It is euen as great folly, for a man in his abundance to deſtroy himſelfe, and his brethren for a bribe, a trifle of no value. The briber is the Diuels meſſenger: Now when he preſents his Maſters baite to the bribe-taker, then is the Diuell at hand to inflame the luſt of couetouſneſſe in him, whereby the bribe ſeemeth pleaſant to the eyes, as the apple did to Eue. The gift dazzeleth the eyes, it hath a bewitching power in it, it taketh away the▪ heart,

it peruerteth wordes, it maketh a wiſe man madde.

                  Better is the end of a thing then the beginning thereof: and the patient in ſpirit, is better then the proud in ſpirit.
               
               A Deſcription of impatience by the euent. Better is the end of a thing, &amp;c. Theſe proud perſons that will not relie on the prouidence of God, nor ſubmit themſelues vnto his will, but they will needes be what they will be, and haue what they will haue, and ſo through impatience fall to wronging ſnatching, racking, reuenging, deceiuing, wreſting, &amp;c. doe at their beginning aime at great matters, worke much miſchiefe, make themſelues terrible to inferiour men, to ſucke aduantage at their pleaſure out of them, and to make them come in with offerings on euery ſide, as to ſome great Idoll. But this proud, preſumptuous, tyrannicall beginning, ſhall haue a bitter end: For God is iuſt to defeat them, to reward their pride with ſhame and confuſion▪ He is good and mercifull, and will deliuer the oppreſſed out of the hands of the oppreſſour in the end, euen in his good time. God moſt wiſe, moſt iuſt, will turne thoſe euill attempts to his owne glory, and good of his children. The end tryeth euery matter, and euery man; for in the end commeth iudgement: And the iuſt Iudge will take vp all matters into his owne hands, and pronounce righteous iudgement. And the patient in ſpirit, is better then the proud in ſpirit. Theſe words containe the rule it ſolfe, inferred by way of conſequence, or a concluſion of the premiſſes. Therefore the condition of the patient man that ſuffereth wrongs and contumeliet, is better then he that of pride 
                        •
                     aſteth away, yea, derideth patience, as but baſeneſſe, timorouſneſſe, puſillanimity. The argument may be gathered thus.
               
                  
                     Prop.If a wiſe man, of a proud and impatient ſpirit, falling to oppreſſion and bribery, ſhall in the end bring the iuſt iudgement of God vpon his madneſſe, then is the pationt in ſpirit, that rather ſuffereth wrong, better then he.

                     h out of them what aduantage pleaſeth him; then is all but vanity, and miſery. For the former is counted miſerable, and if the later, who bleſſeth himſelfe, and is counted happy of others, be vaine in his beginnings, and miſerable in his ending; then is all miſery and vanity, both to oppreſſe, and to be oppreſſed.

                  athfull contention and reuenge, whereby thou ſhalt be prouoked to deuiſe and plot miſchiefe againſt thy neighbour, yea, and againſt the Lord alſo, when thou haſt once giuen place to the Diuell, and ſuffered thy luſt to get dominion ouer th
                     •
                  e. For anger reſteth in the boſome of fooles. Anger is an enemy to wiſedome and counſell, therefore he that is ſwayed with this inordinate affection, ſhall be carried head-long into all folly. For wrath is an euill counſellour, it cannot keepe ſecrets, nor couer infirmities, It is like Rehoboams young counſellours, and Huſhai counſelling Abſolon, and inwrappeth a man in manifold troubles, dangers, and miſchiefes. If he preuaile in his reuengefull and moody courſes, then is he hated of all men;

if he be preuailed againſt, then is his impacience either turned to fury &amp; madnes, and he becommeth an odious miſcreant, or elſe ſhall be derided of his aduerſaries▪ and bewray his folly to all men; and this ſhal be his inheritance. Anger therfore reſteth in the breaſt of a proud, malitious man, but the wiſe-man will conſider the worke of God, both of his ordinance and prouidence, and ſo according to the vnderſtanding, and mature diſcerning of the matter, proceed or ſurceaſe, &amp;c. For the prouidence of God ſhall ſurely be accompliſhed, but clamour, wrath, violent, wilfull and prepoſterous courſes ſhall redound vpon the head of paſſionate fooles, of what degree, place or condition ſoeuer they be, whether their contention be againſt their ſuperiours, equals, or inferiours. An example of fooliſh anger and wiſedome, See Act. 5. 33. 34. &amp;c. Act. 19. 28. to the end. Act. 23. 2. and verſe 5. 6.

                  Say not thou, what is the cauſe that the former dayes were better then theſe? for thou doſt not inquire wiſely concerning this.
               
               THeſe words containe the complaint of impatient people, and are a common obiection of wrathfull fooles, whereby to excuſe, yea, approoue, and cherriſh their moody and reuengefull paſſions, which wanting particular cauſes of iuſt anger, open their mouthes wide againſt the world, but indeed againſt God himſelfe, in whoſe hands the gouernment of the world is. This complaint is continually in the mouthes of the wicked moody, and the wicked needy. The moody Papiſt would murther all the godly that haue Scripture in their mouthes, yea, and liues alſo: For they be Canaanites and Hagarens. And the needy prophane would murther the rich, for they are lyons in the grate. What theſe would doe appeareth by their complaints, groaning like mute theeues and murtherers vnder the preſſe: For the weight of the Law lyeth heauy vpon them by occaſion of their owne malice. For to the iuſt and godly euery law is a law of liberty. Say not thou, why were the former dayes better
                  
                  then theſe? Theſe next words are an anſwere. Thou doſt not wiſely inquire concerning this. Thou doſt not conſider of times according to wiſedome, but art a foole to expoſtulate with God, who according to his owne infinite wiſdome ordereth the times and ſeaſons in iudgement, iuſtice and mercy. Solomon giueth no other reaſons, becauſe this common complaint is a common folly, and the murmuring of ſtubborne and reaſonleſſe perſons, that are not capable of any reaſon, or elſe will not be perſwaded by reaſon, but are rather worſe when they are reaſoned withall: They are moſt commonly but moody, needy, greedy and malecontented fooles that make this complaint, and it is vaine to argue according to wiſdome with vncapable ignorants, and indocible ſtubborne ones. For they will deſpiſe the wiſedome of the wiſe, and tread vnder foot their precious pearles, and glory in their mad contempt. Yet to try whether the foole will leaue his folly I will giue two or three anſweres to this idle obiection not worth the anſwering.
               Firſt, let him recount from the dayes that God placed man vpon the earth, till the preſent time, and ſhew mee when this good world was, (antiquae meliora: The more ancient, the purer, ſaith the prouerbe in another reſpect.) How good were the dayes that Cain and Abel liued in? How good were the dayes of the old world, till the Flood? The dayes of Sem and Cham? The dayes of Abraham, Iſaac and Iacob in Canaan? Of the Iſraelites in Egypt? How good were the dayes of the Iudges? The dayes of the Kings of Iuda, and Iſrael? How good were the dayes of Solomon, thoſe peaceable and wealthy dayes? Did not the people complaine of the grieuous burden of thoſe dayes, and were ready to rebell, as afterward they did? How good was the world in the dayes of Chriſt, and of the Apoſtles? If it were not then good▪ when ſhould it be good? How good in the times of the Primitiue Church, boyling in the heat of perſecutions and hereſies? How good were and are the times of Antichriſt? Of all times we find grieuous complaints. And of the times of Popery (hinc illae Lachrymae) we find great complaint

in the Fathers. Theſe times were full of warres, bloudſhed, maſſacres, treaſons, rebellions, robberies, &amp;c. cauſed by that man of ſinne. Fryar Mantuan diſcouereth the goodneſſe of the world then: And Euerard Arch-biſhop of Canterbury, wrote a volumne (called Obiurgatorium temporis) the Rebuke of the time. Wicked and monſtrous were thoſe daies, yea, exceeding the heathen about two hundreth yeares agoe, the goodneſſe whereof our wicked ignorants ſo much admire. But Elmerius, a Monke of Malmeſbury, counted them the dayes of greateſt woe and miſery, and thereupon gathered the certainty of Anti-chriſts preſent raigne? Fullwell doe theſe proud murmurers ſhew their tyrannicall, and rebellious hearts: When they had a Pope to abſolue them from their alleagiance, and to quench their thirſt with the blood one of another, the world was good: When the Pope partly with ſubtilty, partly with violence wreſted Nobles, yea, Kings out of their poſſeſſions, yea, whom he luſted, after one manner or another, then was there cheapneſſe and plenty: The Fryars made Robin-hoods penny-worthes, and this is all that theſe greedy blood hounds commend the old world for. The Fryars bound the commons to them by making good penny-worths of other mens liuings, both of the Cleargy, and Laity, wrung from them by all deceitfull meanes, for which the Commons were but their ſlaues, and fooles praiſed their bounty for giuing them a cake of their owne meale. It is an eaſie matter to be liberall on other mens purſes. Neither yet conſidering the times then, were there any ſuch penny-worths. Your fore-Fathers groaned vnder the burthen of thoſe penny-worths ſurely, when they put vp a bill in a Parliament, in the dayes of King Henry the fourth, the contents whereof was to take away Temporall Lands, inordinately ſpent by the Cleargie: Which Lands were ſufficient to maintaine fifteene Earles, fifteene hundred Knights, ſixe thouſand and two hundred Eſquires, one hundred Almes-houſes, fifteene hundred Prieſts, and to allow twenty thouſand pound yeerely to the King; allowing to euery Earle, three thouſand markes by yeere: to euery Knight

one hundred markes, and foure plow-land; to euery Eſquire forty marks and two plow-land; to euery Almes-houſe, for to maintaine ſuch ſurpluſage of poore, as Cities, and Townes were not able to maintaine, one hundred markes; and to euery Prieſt ſeuen markes. Fabian. chron. in Hen. 4. ann. 1410. Say not therefore, Why were the old times (in thoſe reſpects) better then theſe?
               
               A ſecond anſwere is, that ſinne and death hath ouerſpread all places and times, all the ſonnes of Adam are ſinfull, and the curſe lyeth on them, and the deuill is their Prince, who is the Lord of the fleſh: but God hath gathered a Church to himſelfe, which is peſtered with Hypocrites alſo, and the children of God themſelues, partly by meanes of theſe corrupting hypocrites, partly through the temptations of the reliques of luſt within them, are drawne aſide out of the way oft times. The iuſt God therefore puniſheth the one, and chaſteneth the other. His meſſengers or inſtruments are, the Plague, comprehending all infirmities, diſeaſes, and maladies; the Sword ſignifying all miſeries and troubles that way; and Famine. Say not therefore, Why were the old times (in that reſpect alſo) better then theſe?
               
               A third anſwere is giuen by Solomon himſelfe, Chap. 1. 9. 10. The thing that hath beene, is that which ſhall be, and that which is done, is that which ſhall be done, and there is no new thing vnder the Sunne. Is there any thing whereof it may be ſaid, ſee this is new? The foole perceiueth nothing of all that is before him, why? Becauſe he diſcerneth not the ſubſtance of things when they are cloathed with other circumſtances. Therefore what is new, what old, hee knoweth not, neither can obſerue how the variable imaginations of all generations, all their deeds, and manners are fixed in their centre, to the nature whereof all things are conuerted.
               A fourth anſwere therefore ſhall be this. Leaue off murmuring, complaining, and diſputing againſt God, mortifie wrath, reuenge, and couetouſneſſe, betake thy ſelfe to the word of God, with a wiſe and vnderſtanding heart in humility, exer
                     •
                  iſe thy faith in obedience thereto, and then ſhall

the world be well with thee, the righteous ſhall reſort to thy company, they ſhall reioyce with thee, and commiſerate with thee, and the peace of conſcience ſhall ouercome all things. If the world be an hell of euils, yet ſhalt thou be in heauen; contrarily if the world were a paradiſe of pleaſures, yet ſhouldeſt thou be in hell. Some are full of feare and deſpaire, and moſt greedy in time of plenty; ſome are ioyfull, hopefull, and content in time of ſcarcity. He that hath aboundance, and no children is a care full drudge, and hee that hath but little ſubſtance, and many children liueth in comfort. Therefore auoyde wrath, let goe diſpleaſure let the world runne his circuits, heare thou for thy time what the Lord ſaith to thee, and doe his will while thou liueſt, and then ſhall it be as good a world to thee as euer it was.
               To conclude; If all theſe old worldlings would mortifie thoſe rebellious affections and luſts which reigne in them, and heare what he ſaith, who ſpeaketh to all generations, the world ſhould be as good as they can imagine it euer yet was. But when the Lord calleth to them, then are they euer ready to call vp their fore-fathers, to ſet them in oppoſition againſt the Lords, as the Phariſees did, Ioh. 9. 28. We are none of this mans diſciples, we are Moſes diſciples. The truth is, they were the deuils diſciples, and ſo are theſe Sauages. If theſe anſwers ſatisfie not, the rod of the Magiſtrate is for the fooles backe, and the yoke for the beaſts necke.

Concerning wiſedome two things are handled. Firſt, the profitableneſſe thereof, to verſe 23. Secondly, the difficultie thereof, from thence to the end. The profit is firſt generally propounded,

verſe 11. 12. The propoſition is infolded in a compariſon with that which is of greateſt account, yea, commonly counted the chiefeſt good among men, to wit, an inheritance. Wiſedome is good with an inheritance, or as an inheritance, gnim nachalah: and by it there is profit, It is more excellent or better, Veiother, i. &amp; praeſtantius, magis) to them that ſee the Sunne. The compariſon is from the Leſſe to the Greater, figured by a Correction, thus: A faire inheritance is a thing deſired of all men, and a man of great poſſeſſions is commonly counted happier then other men. Yet is not that the onely good, nor the beſt good, but there is another gift of God, as good, and as profitable for man as an inheritance, without which his inheritance, be it neuer ſo great, ſhall be vnprofitable to him. Nay, if we muſt make compariſon betweene wiſedome and wealth, wiſedome is the more excellent in it ſelfe, and better to man: For a wiſe and a poore childe is better then an old King that wanteth wiſedome.

                     ah. i. In the ſhadow of wiſedome. The fruit or profit of wiſedome is illuſtrated by a compariſon of an arbour, or thicke leaued tree in the heat of Summer, which is very great in thoſe countries, and therefore they vſe to ſit and eate meate vnder ſuch trees, yea, and to ſacrifice to their idols in ſuch places. As the thicke arbour by refraction of the Sunne-beames defendeth a man from the broiling heat of Summer, and refreſheth him with the coole ayre, and alſo protecteth him from the violence of tempeſtuous blaſts, mitigating the extremity of the one, and the rig
                     •
                  ur of the other, reducing both to the temper of mans body: ſo doth wiſedome in proſperity, and aduerſity defend a man, that neither the exceſſe of the one, nor extremitie

of the other ſhall ouerpower him, but he ſo moderateth both, as that he keepeth himſelfe cleare and free in ſome good meaſure from the temptations and predominance of them both. Sapiens dominabitur actus: The wiſe man ouerpowreth the ſtarres, and is armed againſt the weather. The heauieſt things by engines may be remoued, and done, which otherwiſe to plaine ſtrength are impoſſible, and by deuice of inſtruments the ſtrongeſt caſtles are battered downe, and thickeſt wals pierced through: ſo many things to common iudgement vnpoſſible, are done and auoided by wiſedome. And monie is a defence, or ſhadow. Theſe words ſeeme to be an anſwere to an obiection, thus: Wiſedome indeed is good, and a defence to a man, but monie alſo is needfull, and a preſent remedie. For by monie may a man readily obtaine his deſires, and ſpeedily auoid an euill. For what fauour can a man obtaine by wiſedome, that cannot as well be obtained by money. Et genus▪ &amp; formam, &amp;c. It maketh the baſe honourable, and the deformed beautifull, yea, in another acception of the words, it deſineth all things. Anſ. It is true, money is a defence alſo, and may preuaile much oft times, and moſt in a corrupt ſtate: Money maketh friends, and addeth ſtrength, whereas otherwiſe a man is left naked, and expoſed to many dangers and euils: But as I ſaid before, it cannot hold out in compariſon with wiſedome. For it is more excellent, in that it giueth life to the owners thereof. Money is but as drugges and lenitiue oyntments to mitigate the ſwellings and diſeaſes of the body, whoſe root, remaineth ſtill within, and pullulateth againe after the ſame, or ſome other manner: but wiſedome is a ſpirit incorporated into the radicall humour, giuing health, ſtrength, and life to the body to extirpate the rootes of all diſeaſes.
               The life of a man ſtandeth not in his riches, but wiſedome giueth life. By wiſedome is not meant worldly craftineſſe▪ and the deepe counſels of ſinners, which is nothing but execrable malice and follie, Eccl
                        •
                     ſ. 19. 22. but that which is ioyned with the feare of God. It is the knowledge of the law, and works of God, and the practiſe of his wiſedome is

prudence, by which a man is directed alwaies in the beſt, ſafeſt, and neereſt way to happineſſe▪ Monie is ordered by wiſedome: For without wiſedome, it is but a knife in a childes hand. For the proſperitie of fooles ſhall deſtroy them, Prou. 1. 23. The rich man truſted to riches, Luk. 12. 19. Diues truſted to riches, Luk. 16. The king of Tyrs truſted to riches, Ezech. 28. Haman truſted to his wealth, ſo did Craeſus King of Lydia, Nabuchadnezzar truſted to the ſtrength of Babilon, and Xerxes to the multitude of his ſould
                     •
                  ers, as did Senacherib alſo. But theſe defences were nothing: For riches auaileth not in the day of wrath, but righteouſneſſe deliuereth from death. The wicked in hell confeſſe too late, Wiſd. 5. 8. What hath pride profited vs, or the pompe of riches brought vs? If a man hath tooles, and want wiſedome to vſe them, what is he the better? Nabal was a rich foole, and his riches for want of wiſedome deſtroyed him. But thou wilt ſay, what can a wiſe man doe without riches? But wiſedome is good with an inheritance. Yea, and without an inheritance. For if a wiſe man deſire riches, he can by wiſedome obtaine riches, and honour▪ for out of the priſon-houſe commeth he to raigne, as Solomon ſaid before. If he deſire not temporall goods, he is rich already: For no man wanteth that which he deſireth not, nor yet deſireth that which hee needeth not. The wiſe man is rich in God, he hath therefore whatſoeuer is for his good, and more is but a ſuperfluity. If pouerty be the way to life, and riches the way to death, whether is the better way? Whether is the better defence, or ſhadow? Whether is the better that is brought lowe to riſe higher, as Iob was, or that riſeth high to fall, as Haman did? Wiſedome is a ſtrong Tower to the wiſe, but a rich man is a ſhippe toſſed on the waues. But a wiſe man with riches is better then a wiſe man without monie. I but tiches infatuate the heart of the wiſe, and are often a ſnare to him. For he that hath riches, commonly wanteth himſelfe, they are ſtrong tempters, and therefore wicked Mammon. Howſoeuer a man is more troubled to keepe a good conſcience with riches, then he that wanteth

them. Neither indeede can a wiſe man want▪ ſeeing that there is as much vſe of wiſedome, and the wiſe, as of wealth and the rich: For the world is gouerned by wiſedome, not by riches. Therefore wiſedome ſhall alwaies haue the preheminence, and riches attending on it.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 13. 
                  Conſider the worke of God: for who can make that ſtraight, which he hath made crooked?
               
               AS before he propounded, in generall, the profit and excellencie of wiſedome, to arme a man againſt impatience and all other vanities; ſo here he beginneth to expreſſe the benefit and vſe thereof more particularly, ſhewing what the practiſe of wiſedome is, and how it is a defence, comfort, and life to a man in this vale of miſery.
               Firſt, the practiſe of wiſdome ſtandeth in a right conſideration of the workes of God, verſe 13. The right conſideration of the workes of God is not to ſearch into the depth of his vnſearchable wiſedome, but to reſt contented in the worke of his ordinance. He doth all things after the counſell of his owne will. No man is his counſellour, his owne counſel muſt ſtand. Therfore conſider the worke of God. All things are ordered by the wiſedome of God, and it is thy wiſdome, not to coyne worlds, and policies, at thy pleaſure and will, by violence and turnings of deuices; but thou muſt reſt, and relie on God, and let him worke his owne worke, otherwiſe impatience ſhall carry thee headlong into ſinne againſt God, and againſt thy ſelfe. The reaſon of this practiſe is in the next words figured by a communication. For who can make that ſtraight, which he hath made crooked? If thou ſeeſt oppreſſion, and wrong▪ and peruerting of iuſtice, which may mooue thee to impatience, anger, reuenge, inſurrection, &amp;c. oppoſe not ſinne againſt ſinne, but feare God, and know that God is euen now in doing a worke of iuſtice on ſome by theſe, and afterward will doe a worke of iuſtice on theſe. If Ioſiah the beſt King that euer raigned,

will needes goe out to fight againſt Pharaoh, whom the Lord had ſent out for an executioner of iuſtice, he ſhall be ſlaine. The Lord maketh vſe of crooked things, for his glorie, which thou canſt neuer make ſtraight. Walke thou vprightly, and ſpeake thou vprightly, that they may know their crookedneſſe, if ſo be that God will reueale it to them, and returne to thy vprightneſſe, if God giue them power to lay it to heart, but let their crookedneſſe be their owne, and fall vpon their owne heads. Reſt thou on God, tarrie his leiſure, all times and workes are in his hands. They cannot be haſtened, nor ſlackned by the wit or ſtrength of man.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 14. 
                  In the day of proſperity be ioyfull, but in the day of aduerſitie conſider: God alſo hath ſet the one ouer againſt the other, to the end that man ſhould finde nothing after him.
               
               SEcondly, the practiſe of wiſedome ſtands in the right vſe of the times and ſeaſons, which are in Gods owne hands. Theſe ſeaſons are either of proſperity or aduerſity, of wealth or want, of peace or troubles. In the day of proſperity be ioyfull, when God giueth thee thy hearts deſire for the neceſſitie and comfort of thy body, receiue it thankefully, vſe it ioyfully, cheere thine heart therewith, and let others be partakers of thy ioy. For to what other purpoſe hath God ſent it? Make not a curſe of his bleſſing, nor his goodneſſe an occaſion of ſinne, either by depriuing thy ſelfe, or others of the vſe thereof, or by abuſing the ſame to the hurt of thy body, or miſchieuing of others. Glorifie God in peace and plenty, comfort thy ſelfe, glad the heart of thy neighbour, let him praiſe God in the feeling of his bleſſings with thee, and not enuy thy wicked proſperity. But in the day of aduerſity conſider. Fall not to vnprofitable murmuring, grudging, complaining, curſing, &amp;c. It is the worke of God whatſoeuer the meanes be. For nothing is without him. He vſeth crooked things to the accompliſhment of his will, as well as ſtraight. But the wiſedome of God in applying them to vnknowne ends, and good ends, excuſeth not mans

malice, and euill intents. Weigh the reaſon of aduerſity by wiſedome, and then reſt on God, as Iob did, and as Dauid did in Sauls perſecutions, in Abſolons rebellions, and Shimeis curſed raylings. Iob ſaid, The Lord giueth, and the Lord taketh away, and we muſt receiue euil (puniſhment and chaſtiſements) becauſe we are euill, as well as good of the Lord. The former are our deſerts, the later Gods mercy. Dauid ſaid of Shimei, Let him alone, peradu
                        •
                     nture the Lord hath bidden him curſe. So conſider that this is the worke of God. Therefore feare, blaſpheme not, neither fret, nor ſtriue. Thou canſt not alter the courſe of the heauens, nor change the weather, but thou in wiſedome applye
                     •
                  t all thy worldly buſineſſes to the times, and as the times will giue thee leaue. Anger, and contention is but vaine.
               This patient conſideration and contentation is inforced by a reaſon of the intent and end of Gods wiſedome herein; God hath alſo ſet the one againſt the other, &amp;c. So hath God tempered the life of man with the intercourſe of croſſes, and ſucceſſion of things contrary, exerciſing iudgement, iuſtice, and mercy in his ſecret counſell, that man might find nothing what to ſay, or doe, to imagine or deuiſe in any ſtate, of himſelfe. For Gods worke is moſt wiſe, ſecret, and firme, vnalterable by man, not to be preuented, nor amended by his erroneous counſels. But the muſt let the arrogant ſearch of cauſes paſſe, and glorifie God in aduerſity as well as in proſperity, as Iob did: yea, God ſendeth proſperity, and aduerſity, and other contrary accidents to trie vs, namely, that we may ſee and know the manifold hidden hypocriſies of our hearts, that by theſe occaſions ſhew forth themſelues in imaginations, affections, words, and workes, Deut. 8. To conclude, God doth this, that wee may know and confeſſe him to be all in all, and our ſelues to be but fooles, and beaſts of ourſelues.
            
            
               
               
                  Verſe 15. 
                  All things haue I ſeene in the dayes of my vanity: There is a iuſt man that periſheth in his righteouſneſſe, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedneſſe.
               
               A Confirmation of the former reaſon by the effects of Gods ſecret and wonderfull prouidence, ſeeming quite contrary to reaſon, and to be intollerable indignities, which he further confirmeth by the teſtimony of his owne experimentall knowledge. All things haue I ſeene. There is nothing that can be conceiued, and knowne by the vnderſtanding and reaſon of man, but I haue had the obſeruation and experience thereof. For from the prudent obſeruation, and experience of the workes of God, haue I gathered rules of wiſedome, for the inſtruction and direction of others. He addeth, In the dayes of my vanity; to ſignifie the fulneſſe of his experience of good and euill▪ of wiſedome and folly. He hath ſeene both in himſelfe, and obſerued in others the workes of God. This briefly of the teſtimony. The matter or ſubiect of the teſtimony, are two particular effects of Gods prouidence. The firſt is, There is a iuſt man that periſheth in his iuſtice; namely, for truth and righteouſneſſe ſake. So Abel was ſlaine by his brother Cain, becauſe his deedes were righteous, and his owne wicked; 1 Iohn 3. 12. Eſay ſaith, Chap. 59. 15. Hee that departeth from euill, maketh himſelfe a prey. Naboth was ſlaine for keeping a good conſcience. The Prophets, our Sauiour Chriſt, the Apoſtles and Martyrs, ſuffered death for the truth. Many are murthered, ſpoyled, vexed, rayled on by the wicked for righteouſneſſe ſake, and euen the laſt end of the righteous oft times ſeemeth to be without honour, as the wicked in hell confeſſe they erroneouſly iudged in time of their iouill life; Wiſd. 5. And this is a thing contrary to carnall reaſon, and hard to be vnderſtood; Pſal. 73. 16. 17. And therefore are many offended thereat, and take occaſion to depart from the way of truth. For they fully know not this point of wiſedome, namely,

to relie on the prouidence of God, contrary to humane reaſon, and that he is moſt honoured when we truſt him on his bare word.
               The ſecond effect is contrary to this. And there is a wicked man, that prolongeth his dayes in his wickedneſſe. Contrarily againe, ſome there be that neither feare God, nor reuerence man, without conſcience, without truth in words and deeds, ſwearers, blaſphemers, oppreſſours, deſpiſers of the good, mockers of grace, couetous, iniurious, and yet flouriſh in proſperity, haue the World at will, haue children at their deſire, build houſes, plant vineyards, purchaſe Lordſhips, yea, they are honoured of men, and praiſed for their wiſedome; they liue in health, and die without ſickneſſe; Iob 21. 13. Lazarus periſhed in hunger, Diues liued in pleaſure. Chriſt was ſoone cut downe; but Herod liued long, euen till he was foure-ſcore yeeres old. If a man iudge according to outward appearance, theſe things argue that there is no prouidence at all. But it argueth infidelity, and pride enough, when a man will beleeue nothing without ſo many reaſons and proofes, nor doe any thing at Gods command, till he ſee his wages; Mal. 3. 14 Righteous men die, and mercifull men are taken away; Eſay 57. 1. that they might not ſee nor feele the euils to come on the World, as Lot was taken from among the Sodomites: And wicked men liue to their further vengeance and ſorrow, as did Herod. The righteous are chaſtened with death, and the wicked liue to increaſe their damnation; 1 Cor. 11. 32. They are taken away, leſt wickedneſſe ſhould alter their vnderſtanding, and deceit beguile their minde; Wiſd. 4. 10. The wicked liue to defile their ſoules and bodies with all kinde of ſinne, to haue all their worldly deſires accompliſhed to ripeneſſe, as did the Canaanites. Let vs therefore turns our ſelues to the prouidence of God, and there reſt contented. For they that truſt in him, ſhall neuer be aſhamed, nor confounded.
            
            
               
               
                  Verſe 16. 
                  Be not righteous ouermuch, neither make thy ſelfe euer wiſe: why ſhouldeſt thou deſtroy thy ſelfe?
               
               THirdly, the practiſe of wiſedome conſiſteth, firſt in auoyding extremities, verſe 16. 17. Secondly, in keeping the meane, verſe 18. The extremities are exceſſe, or defect. The exceſſe is an errour on the right hand, when a man by pride abuſeth his wiſedome, in ſtretching it beyond the limits &amp; bounds of humane capacity, either in defining thereby what is iuſt, what vniuſt, or what is truth, what errour. Be not righteous ouer▪much. A man cannot be too righteous in reſpect of obedience to the Commandements▪ yet if he be ſo much addicted to one or ſome, as that hee deſpiſeth the reſt, he bewrayeth hypocriſie and folly, and may well be ſaid to be too iuſt. For a man is not to cull out what hee thinketh good, thereby to iuſtifie himſelfe, and to condemne others; but as Dauid ſaith, to haue reſpect to all the commandements, elſe ſhall hell limit his obedience, and ſerue God, or rather ſeeme to ſerue him according to his owne liking; but reſeruations and exceptions God abhorreth. But a man may make himſelfe too iuſt, when hee preſumptuouſly taketh vpon him beyond his apprehenſion, to define what is right, what not, in this confuſed diſorder of the World, and ſtate of frailety, wherein all things are full of difficulty. For no man muſt preſume aboue his gift, or ſtretch himſelfe beyond the line either of all mens capacity, or his owne. This is but to intrude a mans ſelfe into the roome of God, and to make himſelfe a Law-giuer, rather then an vnderſtander and doer of that which is already giuen, and ſo in the end become rather zealous of his owne Lawes, and fancies, then of Gods; as the Phariſees were, and Papiſts are, and other heretikes haue beene. Neither make thy ſelfe ouer-wiſe. As thou muſt not ſet vp▪ a iuſtice, or zeale of thine owne, ſo neither a wiſedome, or doctrine of thine owne. And this a man doth, when he will ſearch further into the wiſedome of God, then he hath reuealed in his Word. But ſith the moſt perfect hath

hardly attained to the fulneſſe of reuealed wiſedome, how ſhall a man pierce into that which is not reuealed?
               Surely, he that will needs behold the Sunne with open eyes in his glory, ſhal looſe his eye-ſight, and ſo ſhall he looſe his wits that will pry too deepely into the ſecrets of God. If a man will ſearch further then God hath reuealed to man, or beyond the meaſure of his gift, he cannot but fall into hereſies, and fooliſh fancies, which euen to common iudgement, ſhall be ridiculous or wicked. Therefore ſaith Solomon, why ſhouldſt thou be deſolate, or deſtroy thy ſelfe? Why ſhouldeſt thou prouoke God to anger, by proudly prying into him, and not rather honour him by humble obedience, admiring rather his wonderfull wiſedome in his workes, then ſeeking to comprehend his infiniteneſſe to pride thy ſelfe withall, or yet to limit him to thy reaſon, and ſeeking for ſatisfaction in things that cannot be had, rather then to do good workes, as many proud barren talkers do now a dayes. The foole ſeeketh wiſedome, and findeth it not. The Iewes will be righteous without Chriſt, they will haue a Church of their owne making, and a Chriſt of their owne forming: (So will the Browniſts and Anabaptiſts, &amp;c. The Greekes will be wiſer then Chriſt, both lew and Gentile will be wiſer and better then God. For whoſe doctrine was madneſſe, and life ſinfull, and end ſhamefull, if not Chriſts? whoſe lawes and traditions are preferred, inforced, and vrged more then Gods? But the one is wicked, the other fooliſh, both are both, and ſo are they deſolate. For God hath deſtroyed the Iuſtice of the one, or them for their Iuſtice and Goodneſſe, and the wiſedome of the other. And ſo ſhall the Popiſh celeſtiall, terreſtriall Hierarchies, their Iuſtice, and deuotions, proue wicked madneſſe. If a man interpret theſe words of righteouſneſſe in ciuill cauſes, as it is ſaid▪ 
                  ſummum ius ſumma in
                        •
                     uria, and as Cicero ſaith, Viuimus in faece Romuli, non in repub: Platonis, and of calumniations of the law, that is but a branch, for the words are to be taken in the generall ſence of all diuine and humane things.
            
            
               
               
                  Verſe 17. 
                  Be not ouermuch wicked, neither be thou fooliſh: why ſhouldeſt thou die before thy time?
               
               THe contrary defect is ſet downe in this verſe, which is an errour on the left hand. As ſome will be too iuſt, and too wiſe, ſo ſome againe will be too wicked and too fooliſh. Be not wicked ouer-much▪
                   &amp;c. As thou muſt not arrogate to thy ſelfe to define what is iuſt and right at thy pleaſure, as though thou haddeſt all knowledge, and all deſcerning, and the perfection or higheſt degrees of all, ſo neither muſt thou runne out into the other extremities of diſſoluteneſſe and wickedneſſe. For, becauſe thou canſt not ſatisfie thy irreligious curioſity on the one ſide, muſt thou therefore deny the prouidence of God on the other ſide, and deſpiſe his ordinance? Becauſe thou canſt not comprehend his vnreuealed wiſedome, wilt thou therefore caſt off all knowledge and diſcerning? Becauſe thou canſt not ſound the bottome of Gods wiſedome, and find out the vnknowne trackt of his pathes, neither canſt comprehend the reaſon of this or that, or why thou ſhouldeſt doe, or not doe this or that; wilt thou therefore caſt off the royall commandement, and walke in crooked turnings and by-wayes? Wilt thou not vnderſtand thoſe duties aright, whereby thou art to teſtifie thy humility, feare, and obedience, becauſe thou canſt not goe beyond that which is written, or beyond thy line? Wilt thou not reade the Scriptures at all, becauſe they are hard to be vnderſtood? What muſt thou needs haue the exact vnderſtanding of all, or elſe wilt thou vnderſtand none? This is indeed the common folly of Popiſh Ideots; They dare meddle with any thing, ſaue the Bible: For they beleeue as the Church beleeues, but what it beleeueth they know not, ſo they beleeue they know not what, and liue they know not how. They are too wicked, too fooliſh.
               If the Scriptures be hard, then muſt thou pray more earneſtly, and labour more diligently. But the Goſpell is hid to them that periſh, not to others. Becauſe there is, and all

wayes hath beene ſo much contention about the points of religion, and the chiefe articles of the faith; muſt thou therefore make thy ſelfe an Epicure? Muſt thou caſt off all care, and ſeed thy belly? Becauſe the Primitiue Church was peſtered with hereſies, muſt the Pope therefore take away all knowledge of God, claſping vp the Bible in an vnknowne tongue? And becauſe Saint Ierome complaineth of the abuſe of the common knowledge of the Scripture in the mouthes of ſome prophance vulgars, muſt all men, euen the whole Church therefore, be caſt out into vtter darkeneſſe, muſt there be neither preaching, catechizing, nor praying▪ Muſt the Booke of God be turned into pictures and idols, teachers of lies? Muſt Paſtors and Teachers be turned into idle Monkes and Fryers, and faith and true obedience the onely meanes to ſaluation into their regularities? As before the prophane made a common prattle of Scripture without reuerence, ſo now muſt they therefore be deuout in lies contrary to Scripture? A faire mends. Becauſe Monkes and Fryars, the Popes orders, had too much liuing, not onely Tithes, the Churches due by diuine right, but the beſt Temporall liuings, lands and houſes; muſt the Miniſters of Chriſt now be ſtript of all, and be plaine beggars▪ Yea, deſtitute of common meate, drinke, and lodging? Becauſe they had too much for nothing doing, muſt we haue nothing for ſore trauell? Becauſe they had more cloathes and gownes then needed, muſt we therefore by extreame need be driuen to weare but halfe gownes? And becauſe they were wolues, deuouring the flocke, muſt therefore the flocke now be greedy dogges worrying their ſhe pheards? Becauſe nothing was enough for thoſe Drones, ſhall therfore any thing be enough and good enough for diligent and faithfull Labourers? Stulti dum viuant vitia in ventraria currunt. The world is a foole, and a foole runneth euer out into extremities. Too iuſt or too wicked; too wiſe, or too fooliſh; too lauiſh, or too couetous, ſuperſtitious, or not religious at all, if not a Papiſt, then an Atheiſt. If not bringing gifts-ſuperfluouſly to the Tabernacle, then taking away all maintenance, as theſe

greedy ſwine, the ciuill pompous Epicures doe in theſe preſent dayes, wherein euery one is skilfull to rob the Church without remorſe, to maintaine greedy Bell, and proud Iezabel, to keepe the Miniſter vnder, that the deuill may be aloft and raigne, who 
                     •
                  ideth on their backs ſumptuouſly ſadled, and lodgeth in their bellies filled with the Church goods, Satans ſweeteſt bits.
               
                  Why ſhouldeſt thou dye before thy time? Why ſhouldeſt thou bring Gods heauy iudgements vpon thee for thy diſſoluteneſſe and contempt? The workes of the Lord are wonderfull, and to be ſought out of all that feare him, that hee may be glorified in them. For neither the dumbe creatures, nor the dead praiſe him here in earth. But he deſtroyeth them that diſpiſe the knowledge of him and his lawes. For wherefore hath the Lord giuen his word, but that we ſhould know it and doe it? As Dauid exerciſed himſelfe in the law day and night, and as the Bareans ſearched the Scriptures to try Pauls doctrine, for which they were commended of the holy Ghoſt; ſo muſt we alſo without curioſity ſearch out diligently the ſecrets of the Lord therein contained. For things written belong to vs, and to our children. And the diligent ſhall attaine to the ſubtilty of knowledge, and to vnderſtand the darke ſayings of the wiſe, Prou. 1. 4. 6. But the vngodly that caſteth his words behind him ſhall be reproued.

               THis verſe ſetteth downe the practiſe of wiſedome in keeping a meane betweene vaine curioſitie, and prophane diſſoluteneſſe, or contempt. It is good that thou ſhouldeſt, &amp;c▪ Hold the meane betweene theſe two extreames, turning neither to the right hand nor to the left, as the Lord hath commanded in the Law, but keepe an euen courſe, or godly mediocrity. It is good to ſearch into the depth of the word, and workes of God without curioſitie. For the Lord giueth wiſedome to thoſe that ſeeke her as gold and ſiluer, to know Iuſtice and iudgement, and equitie, to vnderſtand a Prouerbe, and the interpretation the words of the wiſe, and their darke ſayings, and a wiſe man wil heare, and increaſe counſell, and a man of vnderſtanding ſhall attaine to wiſe counſels. Pro. 1. Yea alſo from this withdraw not thine hand. His meaning is, not that we ſhould make a mixture of righteouſneſſe and wickedneſſe, of wiſedome and folly, which are things contrary, and haue no communion at all one with another. For what fellowſhip hath light with darkeneſſe, and Chriſt with Belial? There be many Atheiſticall belly-gods in theſe daies that will be compounding, and deuizing mediums, according to their owne fantaſies, and deuizing ſuch religions as may ſtand with their owne luſts, they will gather the dewe of ſweeteſt flowers with the Bee, and ſucke Pitch and Tarre; and Horſe-dung with the Waſpe and Hornet▪ and dunghill-Flye, and make a loathſome potion of Gall and Honey.

                  Bleſſed are the pure in ſpirit, notwithſtanding their imperfections and infirmities, but curſed are they that halt betweene two religions, ſeruing their luſts of both. But the meaning of the holy Ghoſt is, that we ſhould acknowledge our owne imperfections and weakeneſſe, both in regard of exact righteouſneſſe, and diſcerning of perfect Iuſtice in the intricate and difficult matters of the world, and of the depth of Gods ſecrets, and to teach vs modeſty. We cannot be too iuſt, nor too wiſe, ſo long as we containe our ſelues within the compaſſe of the written word, and withall goe not beyond our line, that is, preſume not aboue the gift that God hath giuen vs; Neither yet too wicked, nor too fooliſh, ſo long as we do but ſee and acknowledge our weakeneſſe in knowledge, and defectiueneſſe in diſcerning of Iuſtice and Iudgement, and diſability to attaine to the fulneſſe of euery gift, and therefore reſt our ſelues contented with that which we can attaine to, truſting in Gods mercy for the reſt (not enuying our betters, and of pride, ſtriuing to make all alike) as the Lord ſaith to Paul, My grace is ſufficient for thee. 2. Cor. 12 9. It was wickedneſſe and folly therefore in him that had but one talent, to goe bury it in the ground, and to ſit idle: But as it is an ordinary thing for a rich man to be couetous, and to ſeeke to be too rich, ſo it is for the meane or poore to be careleſſe, and prodigally to waſte that little which hee hath.
               
                  For he that ſeareth God, &amp;c. A reaſon of the former ſpeech, becauſe he that hath the feare of God planted in his heart, ſhall auoyde both curioſity and diſſolute ignorance: He that dreadeth the Maieſtie of God will not arrogantly and preſumptuouſly prie too farre into his ſecrets, nor limit his prouidence by his ſhort and ſhallow capacitie, nor yet contrarily depart away from the knowledge of him in his word, and workes, but exerciſe himſelfe in both, as Dauid did, and all the godly haue done.

This exhortation is included in the reaſon or confirmation thereof: For wiſedome hath more ſtrength, then ten men of power and might in a Citie, for the defence thereof.

For there is a time when the ſtrong is weake, and the weake ſtrong, and wiſedome findeth it out. Great buildings are raiſed by skill, or wiſedome of that kind, not by plaine ſtrength. The ſhip alſo is guided by wiſedome, and by wiſedome of that kind are the windes and floods, made ſeruiceable. Heſter by wiſedome deliuered the Church of God from their oppreſſours, and brought Haman to the gallowes that he had prepared for Mordecai. By the wiſedome of Iudeth was Bethulia deliuered, and the deuouring hoaſt of Olofernes diſperſt, and cropt vp with the ſword. And by wiſedome, Leonidas king of the Spartanes with ſixe hundred men diſperſed fiue hundreth thouſand of Xerxes hoaſt.

               FOurthly, the practiſe of wiſedome ſtandeth in a right conſideration of the condition of man ſince the fall. For there is not, &amp;c. The true and full vnderſtanding of this principle giueth great direction to the wiſe, both for the bridling of impatience, anger, reuenge, &amp;c. and alſo for euen and moderate carriage of himſelfe among all ſorts of men, and

in euery matter. Firſt, this is to be laid downe as an infallible ground, that no man is perfectly good, nor yet can attaine to perfect goodneſſe in this vaine life. Therefore is euery man full of imperfection and wants, whereupon commeth ſuch diſorder, croſſeneſſe, and difficulty of euery matter. Euery man then being fraile and ſinfull, doth often more or leſſe depart from this duty, partly of ignorance, partly of temptation, and who is hee that offendeth not in his tongue? There be many obſtacles to let euill deedes, and remorſe of conſcience ſetleth the heart before they be acted, beſides manifold occurrences: but the tongue is neere to the heart, and as it were the ſound of the heart, which is conueyed by the ayre of the breath, and qualified by the imagination of the minde, which followeth either the ſuggeſtions of Sathan, or the curſed humours in euill. I ſay curſed, becauſe the body is a maſſe of ſinne and death, by the curſe; Gen. 3. 17. Well, ſeeing that regeneration is but here begun, and not perfected, and that all men, partly of temptation, partly of infirmities are ſubiect to many falles in deedes, and words eſpecially, there ſhall, and muſt be occaſions of anger, diſcontent, reuenge, &amp;c.

                  Alſo take no heed vnto all words that are ſpoken; leſt thou heare thy ſeruant curſe thee.
               
               A Conſequent or concluſion of wiſedome, deducted neceſſarily from the former ground. If all men be ſubiect to offend often by deede and word, then muſt thou not giue thine heart and memory to all the words that are ſpoken. Let not all croſſe ſpeeches, angry, and idle words, ſettle in thine heart, and memory: But let them paſſe away as other vaine ſounds doe. For he that will examine euery word that men ſpeake, ſometimes of heat, ſometimes vnaduiſedly, &amp;c. ſhall neuer be charitable, but alwayes contentious, neuer quiet, but alwayes grieued, and ſuch ſeedes being receiued into the heart, will bring forth no good fruit, but corrupt the good ſeedes of grace, and make the ground barren. Euill

words are the ſeedes of many euill workes: Let the ſeedes die, and much euill ſhall be auoyded. When angry words are paſt, let euill thoughts paſſe away with them, and make them an occaſion of firmer friendſhip, reconciliation and charity, which was a cauſe of emnity. But let not the euill ſpirit bring in theſe thoughts againe, at leaſt giue them no entertainement, leſt the laſt errour be worſe then the firſt. Leſt thou heare thy ſeruant curſe thee, Aſher Lo tiſhmagn; id eſt, when as, becauſe thou ſhalt not, or oughteſt not to heare thy ſeruant ſpeaking euill, or reprouing thee. But in charity forbeare to examine his words and deedes too ſtrictly: And then is this concluſion or precept inforced by an argument of the Greater denyed, to denie the Leſſe, n theſe words. If thou oughteſt not alway to heare with griefe thy ſeruant reprouing thee, or his angry complaints, then much leſſe oughteſt thou to regard the angry ſpeeches or contumelies of others, &amp;c. If in wiſedome thou muſt turne away thine eare, and winke at many both words and deedes of thy ſeruant, who is maintained of thy Table and purſe, and oweth duty and reuerence to thee, then mayeſt thou much more paſſe-by the reproaches and petty, abuſes of others, that liue aequali iure vvith thee, that are free, as we, ſay, vnder God and the King. To conclude, if a man in charity muſt beare with the infirmities of his ſeruant, and thoſe that are obliged to him by any bond or duty, then muſt he much more be of charitable behauiour towards all men, by ſuppreſſing anger, impatience, reuenge, &amp;c.

               A Confirmation of the former inſtruction concerning the bridling of anger, reuenge, &amp;c. by the teſtimony of a mans owne conſcience, conuincing him by the Law of nature, which teacheth euery man to doe to other men as he would be done to. As thou wouldeſt haue them to beare with thine infirmities, ſo beare thou with theirs, and make another mans caſe and ſtate thine owne. For oftentimes alſo thine owne heart knoweth, &amp;c. Examine thine owne conſcience,

call thy ſelfe to account, and thou ſhalt find that thou haſt often deſpiſed, and reproached others. Therefore heare, and beare with patience that other whiles, which thou haſt impoſed on others, and hauing a feeling of this frailtie, and many more in thy ſelfe, be readier to pardon then to reuenge wrongs in words or deedes, And compare not thy common infirmities with other mens perſonall ſinnes, nor yet contrarily, that thou mayeſt be an indifferent Iudge betweene thy ſelfe and others. By perſonall ſinne, is meant that ſpeciall ſinne, which euery particular perſon for his part is moſt addicted vnto. And by ſpeciall, is meant a greater degree of this or that ſinne, in this or that particular man; otherwiſe all ſinne is in all men, but it is of a ſeuerall, of a differing conditure in ſeuerall men. If thou beeſt naturally more patient, and another cholerick, iuſtifie not thy ſelfe, nor yet condemn him by this compariſon. For thou ſhalt finde ſome vertue in him to match thy patience, and ſome vice in thee to match his choller. But if his anger be ſanctified, or but his infirmitie, and thy patience naturall or ciuill, he is a man, and thou art yet but a beaſt, yet in the fleſh, and among the fleſhly, thou haſt thy commendation, and that is thy portion, thy reward; Mathew 6. Weigh theſe things by wiſedome, and thy heart ſhall be armed againſt manifold vanities, to liue in reſt, quiet, and comfort, in ſome good meaſure, in this miſerable life, as theſe rules haue preſcribed.

               FRom this verſe to the end hee declareth the difficulty of wiſedome, to ſhew that curioſity is vaine on the one ſide, and that diligence to attaine to ſome good meaſure of wiſedome, is requiſite on the other ſide, and by conſequence the errour of man appeareth in the one, and imperfection in the other, and vanity in both. Now the obiect of wiſedome is either good or euill, things reaſonable or agreeable to good reaſon, or things wicked, which are either with reaſon

and ſubtlety, or meere madneſſe.
               The difficulty of the former hee declareth by his owne experience in this verſe. All theſe things haue I tryed by wiſedome, that is to ſay, that which I haue ſaid concerning the extremities and mediocrity for the eſtabliſhing of the heart in patience and comfort, I haue ſeene and tryed by the direction of wiſedome. Neither yet is a man moderate and wiſe enough, becauſe he is able to bridle impatience, but he muſt diligently bethinke himſelfe as well of that which is to come, as of that which is paſſed or preſent, whereupon the happy iſſue or euent of things preſent doe depend. For the experience of things paſt, and coniecture of that which is to come, or may happen, is the ground or direction of that which is to be done for the preſent, that the ſame may be to right and good purpoſe. For it is not enough that a thing be good in his kinde, but rightly applyed, and vſed to good purpoſe. And herein hath wiſedome her chiefeſt ſtroke. Therefore I hauing obtained knowledge, and the practiſe of knowledge, euen wiſedome, thought to attaine to the depth thereof, and ſaid within my ſelfe. I will be wiſe, but it was far from me. But how much I thought my ſelfe more meerely to haue attained to wiſedome, by ſo much the more was I further off. For where is wiſedome to be found? Where is the place of vnderſtanding? Iob 28. 12. Wiſedome is a protection againſt all euils to come, wiſedome directeth in iudgement and equity, wiſedome guideth in the right way, and guardeth from the incurſions of Sathan and the wicked, the wicked ſubtle, and the wicked mad or ſenſuall, both fooliſh, both beaſtly, and enemies to godly wiſedome.

               A Reaſon of the difficulty of good wiſedome, or of wiſedome exerciſed in that which is good. That which is farre off, or remoued farre away and out of ſight (an allegoricall

ſpeech) worne out or diſperſed away by ſucceſſion of times, which doe alter and eate vp all things, who can find out? For of innumerable things paſt, there is no knowledge at all, and of a few memorable things there is ſome generall conceit; but the condition, or conditure, or circumſtantiall exiſtence of the times, and things paſt, is vaniſhed, and that which was moſt common, is now become moſt difficult. And the learned is perplexed in ſearching out that which was once moſt triuiall. It is a difficult thing to calculate the whole figure or countenance of the heauens, in any one day of the moneth, ſixe hundred yeeres agoe, &amp;c. But it is more difficult to know the whole condition or ſtate of that generation then liuing, though we may gather much by thoſe that wrote in thoſe dayes. The Papiſts for want of this wiſedome are become ſophiſticall ſots in the interpretation of the Fathers, and Scripture. If this calculation were granted to vs, as it was to Moſes, and very much to Solomon, all the Scriptures and all Lawes ſhould be moſt plaine and moſt eaſie to be vnderſtood of him, whom the god of this World hath not blinded. And exceeding deepe, who can finde it? If things paſt be difficult, as the arrow or bird in the ayre vaniſhing out of ſight more and more, inſomuch that a man can onely ſay; Yonder is a Bird, but what kinde, what colour, and many more indiuiduall differences, he cannot tell, but gueſſe by coniecture as well as hee can; then are things to come much more difficult, being buried as it were in a darke dungeon, or pit, into which the eye can diue but very little. But all the deliberation of the wiſe proceedeth from the comparing of things paſt and to come, without which, a thing in it ſelfe good, ſhall not haue like effect, yea, it ſhall haue a contrary effect, and euent. The word of Gods prouidence is firme and ſure, and it is before vs, but it is ſeene of them to whom God reuealeth it more or leſſe. Man is not able to conceiue what is good for him, or right, it is the gift of God. But in his laſt end vpon reuiew of all things paſt, he ſhall ſee his manifold errours, vanities, madneſſes on the one ſide, and of Gods wiſedome, goodneſſe, iuſtice, and mercy on the

other ſide, if that iudicious, and gracious reuiew be giuen him. For many liue in darkeneſſe, and die in darkeneſſe, without obſeruation of Gods workes, like beaſts. This of the difficultie of wiſedome, in reſpect of the obiect of good, which is of God.

               AN explication of the infiniteneſſe of this wickedneſſe and folly, by an example of ſpeciall obſeruation of one kinde of folly, to wit, of the harlot. And I finde: The harlots diuelliſh ſubtilties he illuſtrateth, Firſt, by a compariſon of the Leſſe to the Greater, more bitter then death. Death is terrible, and the paines of death are grieuous. Yea, all creatures abhorre death as an enemie to nature, and a moſt grieuous euill, becauſe it is a deuourer, and a deſtroyer. But this is a ſmall thing in compariſon of the ſorrowes, calamities and miſerable deſtruction that the flickering harlot

bringeth a man vnto. For ſhe is Vorago, the death and deſtruction both of body and ſoule, goods, and good name. So that ſhee grindeth a man and his eſtate all to powder. Secondly, her ſubtile deuices are compared to ſnares &amp; nets. As the fowler and fiſher are skilfull to catch fowles &amp; fiſhes by their ſnares and nets, which otherwiſe are out of mans power and reach: ſo the harlot by her wilie deuiſes inſnareth the wiſe by inflaming luſt in them, which blindeth their vnderſtandings, &amp; bringeth their ſoules in the end into the bondage of the body, the Harlot, and the Deuil How ſhe maketh and ſetteth her ſnares, and nets, Solomon depainteth out by an hypotypoſis, or liuely deſcription, Pro. 7. 10. to the end. Her bates or ſongs are pleaſant, witty, and ſugred words. Pro. 5. 3. The lips of a ſtrange woman droppe as an home combe, and her mouth is ſmoother than oyle. She is ſubtle both by words and geſtures, to kindle luſt, to enamour and rauiſh the ſimple with the loue of her, ſhe maketh her ſelfe a beautifull and precious Iewelin his eyes, ſhe transformeth her ſelfe to delude the ſences, &amp; like a lugler draweth the imagination after her ſhewes to make him phantaſticate on her as an angell, whereupon ſhe ſeemeth to be an angell in his deluded eyes, when ſhe is indeed but an Empuſa, Lamia, Strix, a beaſtly whore, to be put to grinde in the houſe of correction, acommon pocky Iade.
               
                  And her hands are as bands. After that ſhe hath once entangled their affections, ſhe then bindeth them as priſoners are bound, as Delilah did Sampſon, and leadeth them to hell. She in effect ſaith, as Delilah did. The Philiſtims be vpon thee Sampſon, death and deſtruction be vpon thee my ſweet heart, Prou. 7. 27. Her houſe is the way to hell, going downe to the chambers of death. She kiſſeth, ſhee imbraceth the foole in her armes, ſhe ioyneth hand in hand, ſhe dallieth, ſhe mingleth now and then a diſcord with her laſciuious concords to whet the affections, but her armes are ropes wherewith the gentle louing beaſt is bound for the ſlaughter, and the feete of the ſpider inwrapping the bee or flie in her copwebs. Yet are theſe ſimple ones ſtrongeſt, and the wiſeſt alſo in their owne conceits, and ſo are they led as an Oxe to the ſlaughter, and

as a foole to the ſtocks, Prou. 7. 22. This of the illuſtration.
               
                  Who ſo pleaſeth God ſhall eſcape from her. Here he amplifieth her deuilliſh ſubtilties, by the power and force thereof in the perſons tempted. Firſt, negatiuely onely he that feareth God, as did Ioſeph, ſhall eſcape from her; or he that is good before God in his election, being taken by her ſhall eſcape from her though he be, through humane frailtie, for a time deluded by her. For the elect may fall, but neither wholly, nor finally. The ſeede of grace ſhall be of force in the end to ouer-power her force. Secondly, affirmatiuely, but the ſinner ſhall be taken by her. He whom God hath forſaken ſhall be ſurely taken by her, he ſhall neuer be able to ouercome the ſtrength of her temptations, but giue place to his fleſhly luſts, prouoked and inflamed by her. For ſhe is the rod of Gods indignation vpon the ſinner, and her houſe is the wide gate and broad way that leadeth to hell.

Her fingers are ſnakes, her words drops of poyſon, ſhe weepeth with the crocodile louingly and compaſſionately, her eyes ſtreame out the venime of the cokatrice, ſhe hath Hyaenaes voyce, and deuoureth as Leuiathan. For ſhe bringeth the foole into a paradiſe of pleaſure; but his out-gate at the laſt is the ſtocks, pocks, gallowes, hell. Saith the Preacher. A confirmation of the truth of this diſcourſe and obſeruation, concerning the infinite wickedneſſe of theſe ſubtle fooles &amp; made fooles, by the teſtimony of the perſon ſearching, diſcourſing, obſeruing: The Preacher, a man of age and experience, and exerciſed all his life in the ſtudies of wiſedome, and knowledge of all things good and euill.
               
                  One man of a thouſand haue I found. q. d. there is a poſſibility to find out the ſubtle deuices and turnings of men that are wiſe and wil-full in euill, though they giue themſelues ouer to delude, &amp; enſnare. For there is ſome curbe of reaſon, ſome ſmall remorſe, whereby their wayes are ſomething more plaine, they all deuiate not altogether from the principles of humanity into diabolicall falſhood, cruelty, and ſhameleſneſſe, and ſo ſome few of them may be found out and comprehended. But a woman among all thoſe haue I not found: there is not one of theſe witty wicked harlots can be found out, i. their infinite wayes and deuilliſh deuices to deceiue, circumuent, enſnare, yea, and to ſpoyle by ſubtlety and cruelty, is not to be comprehended by the reaſon of man, becauſe the wicked woman is reaſonleſſe, remorſeleſſe, ſenceleſſe, dead in ſinne, her proceedings, and ſudden enterpriſes

are vnnaturall, and voide of all reaſon; her ſpirit is buried and extinguiſhed in her luſts, and ſo hath Sathan more power ouer her, and more powerfully worketh by her. Therefore her ſtrange deuices, deceits, pleaſing allurements, yea, and her cruelties alſo are like the deuils. Though Ahab had ſold himſelfe to commit wickedneſſe, and was euen ſicke of his couetous deſire, yet ſuch a wicked and ſudden plot, whereby to obtaine his deſire, neuer entred into his minde, or if into his minde, yet not into his heart, to act it, without further prouocation, as that of Iezabels in murthering innocent Naboth.
               
            
            
               
                  Verſe 29. 
                  Loe, this onely haue I found, that God hath made man vpright: but they haue ſought out many inuentions.
               
               A Generall concluſion of the difficulty of wiſedome, concerning fooliſhneſſe and madneſſe, and of the infiniteneſſe thereof, illuſtrated by the contrary, namely the ſtate and condition of man in his creation. God made man vpright in his vnderſtanding, reaſon, will, affections, but they haue ſought out many inuentions, that is to ſay, the whole nature of man being corrupted, euill cogitations, ſtudies, and deuices proceed from him, partly through ignorance of God and his truth, partly of hardneſſe of heart, yea, his vnity with God being diſſolued, he is become a beaſt, his ſpirit being caſt downe into vtter darkeneſſe, euen the ſediment of concupiſcence, or the curſed fleſh. For all that is in this world, is the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes, and the pride of life. There is nothing but luſt. Therefore there is no truth but lies, and deceits in man, and they are partly brutiſh or fleſhly, and partly deuilliſh. For he is the Lord of the fleſh.
            
         
         
            
            CHAPTER VIII.
            
               
                  Verſe 1. 
                  Who is as the wiſe man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a mans wiſedome maketh his face to ſhine, and the boldneſſe of his face ſhall be changed.
               
               
                  
                     SOtomon in the former Chapter, hauing treated of wiſedome, the practiſe of wiſedome, and difficulty thereof, the ſcope whereof was that we ſhould reſt contented with theſe things that God for the preſent offereth vs, and alſo abſtaine from all weariſome and curious ſearching into the workes of God, and euill workes of men, wherein God hath a ruling, and ordering hand; he I ſay taking occaſion by this laſt inſtruction or remedy of wiſedome, proceedeth on forward to demonſtrate the vanity of worldly things, by the inſtable and vncertaine adminiſtration thereof, which is two-fold; the one of man in this Chapter, to the end of verſe 13. the o

                  r of God, from the verſe 14. to the end of Chapter 9. To which the former is ſubordinate, and both of them ſo variable and confuſed to mans reaſon, as that no certainty thereof can be defined by any man, but things are ſwayed no man V. Example of vanities obſerued in outward things, but the remedies of thoſe vanities are ſtill

                  end. And this is the fiſt example of vanities obſerued in outward things: For here he ſpeaketh of things according to their outward appearance to humane reaſon.
               Of this Chapter there be two parts. The firſt containeth the dutie of men in ciu
                     ••
                  ſtate, to the end of verſe 8. wherein the awfull ſtate it ſelfe the weth vanity, being cauſed through the corruption of mans crooked diſpoſition; and much more doth the tranſgreſſion of his duty herein, bring forth vanity and miſery. The ſecond part toucheth the tyrannicall abuſe of gouernment, from the verſe 8. to the end of the 13. verſe. But this he doth by way of inſtruction, as in

the former Chapter, ſhewing here alſo what the practiſe of wiſdome is in ciuill ſtate, to arme a man ſtill farther with this remedy againſt the miſeries and euils that in this regard alſo may befall him, that ſo he may obtaine ſome meaſurable ioy, contentation, and comfort in this life.
               This firſt verſe is an Eulogie, praiſe or commendation of wiſedome, and that by the excellence of wiſedome, and the effects thereof, The excellence is ſet forth by a compariſon of equals denyed, figured by a communication, and that againe by an exclamation, or Epiphonema, more ſignificantly or emphatically to expreſſe the worthineſſe of wiſedome Who is as the wiſe? What man of any eſtate, degree or quality may be compared to a man of wiſedome? None, Who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? An explication of his excellence, illuſtrated, and figured in like manner: Who hath vnderſtanding, iudgement &amp; diſcerning of things, perſons, places, times and ſeaſons, as hath beene already ſaid, &amp; is now to be further declared, who hath theſe, I ſay, but the wiſe? Who knoweth what to ſpeake, and when to ſpeake? Who knoweth when, and how to beginne a buſineſſe, to proceede, to ſurceaſe, to handle a buſineſſe, to tarry for occaſion, to take opportunity, but the wiſe?
               Moreouer wiſedome is ſet forth by the effects. A mans wiſedome maketh his face to ſhine, and the ſtrength of his countenance ſhall be changed. Theſe words haue relation to the former Chapter, verſe 2. 3. 4 5. 6. That is to ſay, whereas I ſaid before that a man was armed againſt the vanities of this life, by mourning, anger, ſorrow, ſadneſſe of heart, countenance, behauiour, &amp;c. and that was a point of wiſedome; ſo now contrarily in another caſe or reſpect, the ſame wiſedome maketh the countenance of the wiſe lightſome, amiable, ſerene, that no token of indignation, griefe, anger, diſpleaſure, may appeare therein, but the frowning ſeuerity, and ſadneſſe thereof is changed into the contrarie. The vnderſtanding of this point of wiſedome appeareth by that which followeth after.
            
            
               
               
                  Verſe 2. 
                  I counſell thee to keepe the kings commandement, and that in regard of the oath of God.
               
               THe principall propoſition of a mans duty towards the higher powers, wherein the practiſe of wiſedome conſiſteth. The words are an admonition or counſell. I counſell thee to obſerue the kings mouth, or word, or to keepe his commandements, according to the intent thereof, as it commeth from his mouth, and is maintained by his power, and that not ſo much for feare of his power, and puniſhment, as for the oath ſake, in faithfulneſſe and conſcience, whereby thou art bound to God, and to him vnder God. In old times ſome of the kings of Iuda cauſed the people to ſweare that they would ſerue the Lord, and cleaue to him, and renounce idolatry. This loyall obedience is ſubordinate to our obedience to God, and is our obedience to God, foraſmuch as rulers and gouernours are ordained of God, to which therefore we muſt ſubmit our ſelues vnder him, and to him in them, and to their lawes being agreeable to his lawes, and grounded on his lawes. For the lawes of God are generall for all nations, and generations of the world, and reſpect the conformitie of mans nature thereunto, and therefore continue the ſame for euer; but the lawes of Princes are alterable, and changeable, at their diſcretion, according to the condition of times and people, but yet by the direction of the lawes of God. This is godly wiſedome, godly policie. For the maine intendment, ſpirit, and life of mans law, is the preſeruation and keeping of Gods law, that thoſe that haue not an inward conſcience and feare, yea, loue wrought within them by the preaching of the word, or light of naturall principles before the word commeth, that thoſe may haue an outward conſcience, to which they ſhall be inforced by the power of the magiſtrate, to make brutiſh men ciuill, and ciuil men religious, if God giue grace, and religious men to continue religious.
               And therefore as Saint Paul termeth the Goſpell of Chriſt,

his Goſpel, which according to his wiſedome and diſcretion, hee propounded, vſed, and applyed to the beſt, for the planting and further building vp of the Church; ſo is Gods Law the Kings Law, and his word the Kings word, as he taketh it into his cuſtody to impoſe it, and to inforce the obedience thereof vnder God vpon all men, and to puniſh vnder God the breakers thereof. Eſt enim medicus reipub. Therefore muſt wee chearefully, readily, willingly, faithfully obey the ſame, as if wee had receiued it immediately from the mouth of God.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 3. 
                  Be not haſty to goe out of his ſight, ſtand not in an euill thing, for he doth whatſoeuer pleaſeth him.
               
               AN explication or illuſtration of the former generall inſtruction, by the contrary practiſe of folly, here forbidden. Be not haſty to goe out of his ſight. If any thing diſpleaſe thee, becauſe thou thinkeſt it not to be agreeable to iuſtice, and right, or ſome way inconuenient, or ſome damage thereof to enſue to thy ſelfe, &amp;c. take heede of pride, and choler, let it not appeare in thy words, countenance, or geſture, which are appearances of a rebellious diſpoſition, yea, ſeedes of future rebellion; when occaſions, and further prouocations ſhall come thereunto, ſhew no token of diſpleaſure at all, but in wiſedome humble and ſubmit thy ſelfe, and ſpeake as by good and lawfull leaue thou art permitted, that it may plainely appeare, that thy heart is for the Kings honour, and ſafety. Therefore doe not vnaduiſedly, or in diſcontent depart out of his preſence, nor in ſuch ſenſe or appearance refraine from his preſence, leſt the diſpoſition of thy heart be ſuſpected to be rather from him, then towards him. For that is the ſeede, or beginning of a diſeaſe, which doubtleſſe ſhall be purged, or with diſgrace curbed, or at leſt he ſhall alwayes haue a iealous eye ouer thee, and how doubtfull things may be interpreted in that caſe, conſider. For great euils may come vpon thee cauſeleſſe▪ but yet vnknowne; for he that is in an ill name, is halfe hanged. Howſoeuer, thou haſt giuen

aduantage to thine enemies, and laid a way open for them to come betweene him and thee.
               To conclude, boaſt not thy ſelfe before the King, neither arrogate any thing to thy ſelfe, be not too wiſe before him, as though thou wert an inſtructer or teacher, or haddeſt a reach beyond him; but let thy wiſedome and counſell be ſo couertly ingeſted, as that rather it may appeare to him to be his owne, thy words being as it were an occaſion to bring it to his minde, ſo ſhall he conceiue and vtter, and doe that which thou wouldeſt haue him, without any impeachment of his honour at all, ſeeing that that which was thine, is made his owne, and ſo is his owne counſell and will, not thine. Put not thy ſelfe forth before the King; Prou. 25. 6. Leſt thou carrie the ſhew of a corriuall, or part ſtake, but be modeſt, and humble. And herein Ioab did wiſely, when he ſent to Dauid to come and take Rabbah himſelfe, leſt the victory ſhould be imputed to him, but Saul vndeſeruedly enuyed Dauid, for the ſongs that the women ſang of his victory of Goliah. Stand not in an euill thing. Stand not in a thing proudly, though thou beeſt in the right, as it ſeemeth to thee, neither ſtand in an euill without pride. For pride marreth a good ſubſtance, and euill marreth a good circumſtance. If thou ſtand in an euill thing of errour, it ſhall bring preſent diſgrace, and if it be of pride, it ſhall bring preſent deſtruction. In this caſe therefore aske counſell of wiſedome, and ſhee ſhall giue thee true direction to come out of both, to auoid both. It is diſcredit enough to erre before a great man, to ſtand in an errour is diſgrace, for it betokeneth folly, but to ſtand in it in pride, is ſtubbornneſſe and madneſſe. For hee doth whatſoeuer pleaſeth him. A reaſon to inforce the former admonitions. It is in vaine, and a point of greateſt folly to contend with him that hath power in his owne hands, yea, who onely hath power, which cannot be oppoſed without iuſt puniſhment. For contention controuleth and rebuketh, and then is power no power, and the heart that prepareth it ſelfe to reſiſtance, intrudeth it ſelfe into his roome, who hath ſole command vnder God: an euill matter indeed may be reſiſted,

but neither the perſon, nor place. Well, concerning the cauſe, there is great wiſedome to be vſed, be not thou for thy part too iuſt, nor too wiſe, as was ſaid before, leſt thy cauſe be conſtrued to be but a pretence, and the beginning of a diſeaſe in the Common-wealth. For the King is the Common-wealths Phyſitian. By King, we may vnderſtand euery man in authority, by going out of his ſight, to depart from duty and obedience. It is an Hebrew phraſe. Ionah 1. &amp; 3.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 4. 
                  Where the word of a King is, there is power: And who may ſay vnto him, what doeſt thou.
               
               A Proſſyllogiſme or confirmation of the former reaſon, Where the word, &amp;c. The commandement of a King is with power to haue it done. He may doe very much, be it right or wrong, by the weight of his power, and who may ſay vnto him, what doeſt thou? What ſubiect can oppoſe himſelfe to power, to controule, or expoſtulate there with? Seeing that he ſuſtaineth the perſon of the whole Common-wealth vnder God, how can one or a few branches contend againſt the whole tree, or againſt the root, or body thereof? The ſtrength and power of all is put into his hands. What then is a priuate man, or a priuate cauſe, be what it will? A common and dangerous griefe indeed is equiualent, and eaſily perſwadeth a Prince, but it is enough for a priuate man to haue diſpleaſed, for who ſhall ſtand in for him?
            
            
               
                  Verſe 5. 
                  Who ſo keepeth the Commandement, ſhall ſeele none euill thing: and a wiſe mans heart diſcerneth both time and iudgement.
               
               A Reaſon inforcing the practiſe of the inſtruction, verſe 2. He that keepeth the commandement, &amp;c. He that ſheweth himſelfe modeſt, and obſequious to theſe, whom in duty he ought to obey, ſhall be free from many dangers, troubles, and incumbrances, and preuent ſuch calamities, as may not onely

for the preſent, but afterwards vpon diſpleaſure ariſe. Howſoeuer a great man will contend for his honour: And he that reſiſteth, ſhall make himſelfe a prey to euery man. But he that is dutifull and louing, ſhall auoid all. And a wiſe mans heart diſcerneth both time and iudgement. The wiſe in heart knoweth what is lawfull, what vnlawfull, and how farre. He diſcerneth when to obey, when to diſſemble, how to obey, how farre, and when to be ignorant, when to with-draw himſelfe, in what ſort, in what meaſure. The wiſe hath diſcerning of the prouidence of God, to which he giueth place, and therefore in all things he tryeth what is the good pleaſure of God. Theſe words I take to imply an anſwer to an obiection, thus. A man ſometimes for being too ready, obſequious, and haſty in obeying the commandement of a Prince, may procure to himſelfe and others great euils, as Doeg did. For Princes haue their errours, and are tempted to euill as well as other men; and oft times a ſmall errour at the firſt occaſioneth great euils, and who is he that ſaith or doth not ſometimes that, whereof he repenteth him not? Therefore may too quicke obedience diſpleaſe afterwards, as well as preſent ſlackneſſe. Againe, a Prince is not himſelfe, but all his ſubiects incluſiuely, euen the whole body or ſtate of the Kingdome: So that in a King there is not onely an vnion of body and ſpirit, as in all men, but alſo of his perſon, and the politike body or ſtate. Now if in commanding he ſwerue from this vnion, here is the difficulty of wiſedome.
               
                  Anſwer. All this is true. But the wiſe man in obeying obſerueth time and iudgement, and ſo in ſlackneſſe alſo. Opportunity calleth him forth, iudgement biddeth him ſpeake, and hold his peace. Doeg was deſtitute of vnderſtanding, both in his words and deedes; 1 Sam. 22. 9▪ 10. But the Kings Sergeants ſhewed wiſedome, verſe 17. Ioab anſwered wiſely, 1 Chro. 21. 3. but too harſhly; 2 Sam. 19. 5. 6.
            
            
               
               
                  Verſe 6. 
                  Becauſe to euery purpoſe there is a time, and iudgement: therefore the miſery of man is great vpon him.
               
               AN explication of the anſwereſhewing a reaſon, why that a wiſe man obſeruing time and iudgement, ſhall feele none euill, at leaſt ſo farre forth as by mans wiſedome can be auoyded. Becauſe to euery purpoſe, &amp;c. All things are in the hands of God, and the hearts of Kings alſo, and his purpoſe in the leaſt thing is vnchangeable. So that for euery thing there is a time prefined of God, together with a moſt wiſe, and right meanes and manner, wherevpon euery euent neceſſarily dependeth. Now he that obſerueth this worke of God, ſhall auoide all euils. A thing in his kinde good, may by euill vſage be made naught; and a good deede muſt be ordered by time and iudgement. If time be preuented, it ſhall be fruſtrate, yet afterwards, though otherwiſe effected. For God doth all in time and ſeaſon, and will haue them cloathed with his owne circumſtances alſo; but the vaine imaginations of man are innumerable, and hee is giuen to take too much vpon him, as though all things were in his hand. But God will make him know that hee is but vaine man. Therefore is the miſery of man great vpon him. A conſequence or collection of the manifold and great miſeries of man, applyed to the diſobedient, and ouer-wiſe: Becauſe there is a due time, and right meanes, and manner in the prouidence of God, for euery thing to his owne glory, which is the ground and guide of good wiſedome; therefore is there ſo much vanity in all counſels, wordes, and workes, and the endleſſe troubles and miſeries of preſumptuous man are occaſioned from hence.
            
            
               
               
                  Verſe 7. 
                  For he knoweth not that which ſhall be: for who can tell him, when it ſhall be?
               
               A Reaſon why that the vanitie and miſerie of man ſhould be increaſed by the moſt wiſe and good prouidence of God. For he knoweth not what ſhall be. The good wiſedome of God is not the cauſe of vanities in politicke ſtate, but an occaſion, and mans ignorance and malice is the cauſe. For being depriued of wiſedome and iuſtice through his owne malice, his imaginations are all fooliſh and vaine, and his follie is vpon him. The deliberation of the wiſe ſtandeth in comparing things paſt and to come, but the one is farre off, and the other is deepe, as was ſaid in the former chapter. But fooliſh men, impatient, and ouer-wiſe, are altogether ignorant of that which ſhall be, neither doe they regard whether it ſhall be, or no, in the prouidence of God, but they haue a prouidence of their owne, a falſe, coyned, or apiſh world, to which by their ſubtilty and violence they thinke to cauſe all things to incline, and to make Gods prouidence and wiſedome to ſtoupe downe to theirs, perſwading themſelues that that ſhall be which they haue purpoſed, and cloſely plotted, and deuiſed the meanes, and manner how it ſhall be effected. Here is vanity and miſery enough. If a man ſtand in oppoſition for a good thing, he cannot tell whether that good thing ſhall be or no. For there are many things good in our vnderſtanding, which are not ſo in the wiſe prouidence of God. But as it is good, ſo muſt it be well, and it cannot be well, but in Gods appointed time, with all circumſtances fitting. Who can tell when it ſhall be? Although this good to be effected, or euill to be reformed, is to be taken in hand becauſe it ſhall be done in the common iudgement and deſire of men, yet who can tell a man when it ſhall be done, and how it ſhall be done? If a King himſelfe would doe a thing, he muſt depend on Gods prouidence, and tarry till the appointed ſeaſon. For

God is the chiefe Pilate of the ſhip, and the Watch-man of the city. And if a thing ſhall be done by him, yet the time and manner is vncertaine. Hee muſt not ſtriue againſt God, neither muſt thou being a particular branch, of particular capacitie, ſtriue againſt the root that beareth thee and all the branches, whoſe generall good, firſt, and conſequently particulars in their kindes, it reſpecteth, as thou doeſt thine owne. Well, ſeeing that a man either knoweth not what ſhall be, or elſe knoweth not how and when it ſhall be, his contention intangleth himſelfe in great errours, troubles, and dangers, and his diſobedience, and contention ſhall be puniſhed, he ſhall not eſcape: He muſt depend vpon the prouidence of God, and opportunitie offered of God, and not ſtand in an euill thing, nor euilly in a good thing before the higher power.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 8. 
                  There is no man that hath power ouer the ſpirit to receiue the ſpirit, neither hath he power in the day of death: and there is no diſcharge in that warre, neither ſhall wickedneſſe deliuer thoſe that are giuen to it.
               
               AN expoſition of the miſeries that the fooliſh and rebellious runne into. There is no man hath power ouer the ſpirit to preſerue the ſpirit, &amp;c. Although that the man of ſtrength and ſubtiltie verily thinketh through his power, wealth, and ſubtle plots to effect his wicked deſignes, and to eſcape puniſhment, yet is this but fooliſhneſſe and imprudence, cauſed of hautineſſe of ſtomacke. For his life is not in his owne hands, neither hath he power to liue, or free himſelfe from death by any meanes or deuice, when the king requireth it as a iuſt reward of his wickedneſſe.
               
                  There is no diſcharge in that warre. There is no caſting of weapons then to ouer-power the kings power, which is to alter and change the ſtate of a kingdome, a great worke of Gods prouidence. For when the king in iuſtice exacteth his life, the whole burthen of the kingdome preſſeth him to

death. But if there be iniuſtice, or rigorous extremitie in the matter, who ſhall ſtand vp in defence for him againſt the king? Who ſhall take vp armes with him?
               
                  Neither ſhall wickedneſſe deliuer thoſe that are giuen to it. It is the cuſtome of the wicked to ſeek to auoid imminent dangers by euill meanes, as Caiaphas and Pilate did, but he that feareth the froſt, the ſnow ſhall fall vpon him: Many thinke to auoid pouerty with theft, vſurie, couetouſneſſe, but all in vaine. Neither ſhall violent nor craftie courſes preuaile or helpe a man. It is impoſſible to breake off the whole politicke body in him. If the king will be auenged of him that hath offended, who ſhall ſtand on his part to deliuer him? For who ſhall expoſtulate or examine the cauſe? Who ſhall bring the King into iudgement? If the caſe be all mens, and euery mans, there is indeede an equiualence in the matter, for the whole body matcheth the head, and the head is not for it ſelfe but for the body. Surely it is an hard caſe, that the head ſhould make all the body ſicke. For the diſvnion of the head and the body is lamentable. When the body of Iſrael tooke a new head to it, namely a king, God was diſpleaſed. God appointed them Iudges, but they had rather imitate the nations, then ſtand to Gods ordinance. Againe, afterward, when it tooke another head to it, Ieroboam the ſonne of Nebat, what was it the better? That was not the ſalue for their ſore. It is one thing to change a ſtate, or an head, and another thing to purge out a corruption, or in time to weare it out. Wickedneſſe can neuer deliuer thoſe that are giuen to it. Surely if one man, then all men in one body muſt abide the triall, and the rod of correction. For if they will needs auoid the ſcourge of God one way, they ſhall bring a ſcourge vpon themſelues more grieuous to be borne another way. Not the Senate of Rome, but the whole world executed Nero: For he was an enemie of mankinde, and defacer of the image of God, a reſolute diſſolute tyrant. Hee was no gouernour, but a deſtroyer, and put himſelfe out of office, and left the body of his dominions deſtitute,

and for his part expoſed it to diſſolution. So did not Saul, nor Rehoboam, nor Manaſſes, nor Amon, &amp;c. Wickedneſſe is not to be reformed by wickedneſſe in the ordinance of God, but euill is to be ouercome with goodnes ſaith the Apoſtle. This of the duties or practiſe of wiſedome in ciuill ſtate, whereby to auoid, at leaſt to mitigate the vanities, troubles, and vexations of this miſerable life. Whereupon wee may gather by neceſſarie conſequence what vanities or miſeries a man is ſubiect to in a politicke ſtate. And for a man to liue out of ſuch an eſtate is miſery it ſelfe: For men ſhould be, as in old times diſperſed people haue beene, more vile then beaſts, and better is the worſt common-wealth then none, and the worſt peace then the beſt warre. All which things argue the neceſſitie of vanity: And the practiſe of wiſedome, is to mitigate the ſame, by reducing mankinde to the beſt of miſerable eſtates, according to the prouidence and ordinance of God, and to abide an inconuenience to auoid a miſchiefe. So it is in the body, and ſo it is in the Common-wealth.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 9. 
                  All this haue I ſeene, and applyed my heart to euery worke that is done vnder the Sunne: There is a time wherein one man ruleth ouer another, to his owne hurt.
               
               THe ſecond part of the Chapter of tyrannicall abuſe of gouernment, or that which is done vainely, againſt law and right. All this haue I ſeene. A confirmation of the propoſition following by the teſtimony of his owne experience. All this that I haue ſpoken, and am to ſpeake of, of people and magiſtrates in ciuill gouernment, I haue ſeene, euen with mine eyes, and applyed my heart to euery worke that is done in the world. This is a confirmation of his obſeruation, by the meanes and diligence that hee vſed to obtaine the true and exact knowledge of things. For as a mans heart and diligence is, ſuch are his obſeruations.

The wiſe taketh the right courſe, and findeth out the truth. But the foole bringeth forth ſuperſtition, falſe rules, and like concluſions.
               
                  There is a time wherein one ruleth ouer another, to his owne hurt. The propoſition of this vanitie. Rule and ſoueraigntie is deſired of all. For herein the pompe and glory of man ſheweth forth it ſelfe moſt. And great ſtates are commonly counted happie. For in regard of ſuperiority, ſplendor, and adminiſtration of humane things they are tearmed gods. But ſometimes this title, ſtate, and power is turned into greateſt vanitie. It becommeth vaine, firſt in reſpect of thoſe that are gouerned, when a Prince ſeeketh rather the hurt then the good of the people, as when he falleth to couetouſneſſe, and oppreſſion, when he exalteth, deiecteth, graceth, diſgraceth, according to his owne luſt, not regarding the worthineſſe, or vnworthineſſe of the perſons, whereby vertue is put to rebuke and ſilence, and all manner of vice flouriſheth, as weeds in an vncleane or vntilled ſoyle. Secondly, in reſpect of the gouernours, whoſe wickedneſſe ſhall be puniſhed with euerlaſting ignominie. For as they are moſt eminent in place and degree, ſo ſhall the commendation of their vertues, or the ſhame of their follie be eminent alſo and memorable for after times. That a man ſhould raigne ouer others to his owne hurt, is but vanitie, and of other vanities the chiefe.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 10. 
                  And ſo I ſaw the wicked buryed, who had come and gone from the place of the Holy, and they were forgotten in the citie, where they had ſo done: This is alſo vanity.
               
               AN expoſition of the euils, or vanities, that follow tirannie, to wit, buriall and obliuion. And I ſaw the wicked buried. Their wickedneſſe profited them nothing, they were as gods, but they died like men, yea, they arrogating the glory of God to themſelues, liued like

beaſts, and were pitted like beaſts, tumbled into the graue, or depriued of the honour of the graue, as was Cononiah and Iezabel, and Ahabs bloud was lickt vp of dogges. There be many examples hereof of Emperours and Popes. Who had come, and gone from the place of the Holy. An illuſtration of their miſery by a compariſon or vnlikeneſſe of their place and dignity, and their end. They went and came with pompe and terrour, to the place of iudgement, they ſate in maieſtie vpon the ſeat of iudgement, which is the place of the moſt holy, they ſate on the throne of God, and forgetting themſelues to be but men, vſurped the glory of God, as Nabuchadnezzar, Senacherib, Antiochus, Herod, Antichriſt did. Therefore ſo much the more remarkeable was their latter buriall or latter end, the vanitie o
                     •
                   pompous tyrannie more euident, the pride of the wicked wiſe more deſpicable, and their end made a document to the liuing of mans madneſſe and miſerie. Howſoeuer they are couered with darkeneſſe, and returne to their duſt. Their ſhow, and ſtirre, and tumult in the world, is but the crackling of thornes vnder a pot, which maketh a noiſe for a while, and ſuddenly falleth into aſhes, which are caſt vpon the dunghill. This is their end. And they were forgotten in the Citie, where they had ſo done. A ſecond euill or vanitie of tyrants. Whereas in their life time they would be as gods, they died like men, and were ſoone forgotten as beaſts. As ſoone as they were put into the graue, ſo ſoone were they put out of minde and memorie. They were not worthy to be thought on, nor ſpoken of, but their names rather to be clipt and curtalled, as Ieconiahs, Ier. 22. 24. or caſt into the ground to rot and conſume with their corpſes, and to be made documents to the liuing to their euerlaſting ſhame and contempt. As Princes are the moſt eminent and excellent in their kinde, I meane of mankinde, ſo in their degenerating are they moſt vile, and as ſalt hauing loſt the ſauour, moſt

vaine and miſerable. For the earthly felicitie and glory of a Prince, is his honour, which being turned into ſhame is the greateſt miſerie. Vertuous Princes ſhine as ſtarres in the world, their names are alwaies freſh in memorie, their names are honoured and reuerenced in the hearts of men, as though they were yet liuing, and their workes here done in the fleſh, increaſe ſtill to the glory of God in the world. Their influence hath a perpetuall liuely operation. For their worthy acts, their counſels, wiſe ſentences, are rules of inſtructions and direction to all ages, and peoples. But it is quite contrary with wicked Princes. Therefore in life, in death, after death are they moſt vaine and miſerable.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 11. 
                  Becauſe ſentence againſt an euill worke is not executed ſpeedily, therefore the heart of the ſonnes of men is fully ſet in them to doe euill.
               
               A Concluſion of theſe vanities, containing a moſt heauy ſentence or iudgement, wherein: Firſt, he declareth the cauſe of wicked mens boldneſſe in ſinne, in this verſe. Secondly, he propoundeth the iudgement it ſelfe in the two next verſes. This verſe is an expoſition of the reaſon or cauſe, why that men, both Prince and people are ſo bold and feareleſſe in wickedneſſe. Their heart is fully ſet in them to doe euill. They are fully bent on miſchiefe, and will preſumptuouſly doe it, why? Becauſe God doth not preſently powre downe the fierceneſſe of his wrath vpon them. If God ſhould preſently ſend his hangman, the Deuill, to plucke the thiefe by the throat, and flye away to hell with him, hee would be afraid to ſteale. If he ſhould ſend his executioner to plucke out the tongue of the ſwearer, blaſphemer and ſcorner of his word, and ſo carrie him to hell in the ſight of all men, tearing out his bowels, and ſprinkling his

bloud in the ayre, he would be afraid to open his mouth, le
                     •
                  t he ſhould offend. Some ſinners of all ſorts God hath, and doth ſtrike ſuddenly, as Senacherib, Antiochus, the Sodomites, &amp;c. to be inſamples to the liuing. But ſo long as a ſinner hath eſcaped once, twice, &amp;c. and that he ſeeth others to liue long, and die in ſinne without puniſhment, or extraordinary vengeance, he is emboldened, and hopeth the beſt, thinking that God hath forgotten, or ſeeth not, or that his ſinnes are not ſo great, or that God will not puniſh him. And thus abuſing the patience and long-ſuffering of God, he continueth &amp; hardeneth himſelfe in ſinne without remorſe. And ſo will by no meanes be brought to confeſſe, and acknowledge his errours. But if he doe it, yet will he not amend his wayes, but hoping of pardon, rather adde drunkenneſſe to thirſt.
            
            
               Verſe 12.
               Though a ſinner doe euill an hundred times, and his dayes be prolonged; yet ſurely I know that it ſhall be well with them that feare God, which feare before him.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 13. 
                  But it ſhall not be well with the wicked, neither ſhall he prolong his dayes, which are as a ſhadow; becauſe he feareth not before God.
               
               AN expoſition of the iudgement it ſelfe in theſe two verſes, which ſtandeth of a denunciation of puniſhment on the ſinner, and a pronunciation of deliuerance and bleſſing on the good. Concerning the former. Firſt, it is illuſtrated by an argument of the diuerſe, which is figured by a prolepſis, whereof the obiection is the imagination of the preſumptuous ſinner, as before. The anſwer is expreſſed here. Though a ſinner doth euill continually, figured by a ſynecdoche of the ſpeciall, to wit, a finite number put for an infinite, an hundred times, amplified by a compariſon of the leſſe, to argue the greater, and his dayes be prolonged in euill, meaning many yeeres, figured by a Climax or gradation
                  
thus. Though a ſinner doth euill, and not onely ſo, but continually, and not onely continually, but long time doth euill, that liueth extraordinarily long to doe euill, yet ſhall he be puniſhed, figured by an hyperbole, to wit, a meiôſis, or liptote, yet ſhall it not be well with the ſinner, illuſtrated by a commoration, the wicked▪ neither ſhall he prolong his dayes, illuſtrated by a ſimilitude of a ſhadow; as Iob 8. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15.
               Secondly, this denunciation is explicated by the cauſe thereof, Becauſe he feareth not before God. The contrary is vnderſtood by anantapodoſis, but in hypocriſie before men, or for feare of the Sword.
               Concerning the later part, to wit, the pronunciation of deliuerance and bleſſing of the good. But it ſhall bee well with the good. Firſt, confirmed by the teſtimony of his owne knowledge. I know, which is further confirmed by the certainty and infallibility thereof, Surely. Which is ſpoken in oppoſition to the vaine imaginations of dreaming ſinners or ſlumberers, in the verſe afore-going, who imagine that they are good in doing euill, and in doing euill, hope well. Secondly, by the cauſe, That feare God. Which is illuſtrated by a diſtinction or difference of feare, that feare before him. To wit, not in ſhew, but in truth and deede, behauing themſelues alwayes godlily and reuerently, as in his preſence. The wicked haue a ſeruile feare, which cauſeth them to runne out of his preſence, as Adam did, and they labour to expell that feare alſo, to liue ſecurely in ſinne; but by the preaching of the Law, it is maintained, to bridle and compell them by outward force of the ciuill ſword. Thus farre of vanity increaſed by the inſtability and variableneſſe of humane things, in regard of ciuill gouernement.
            
            
               
               
                  Verſe 14. 
                  There is a vanity which is done vpon the earth, that there be iuſt men, vnto whom it happeneth according to the worke of the wicked; againe, there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the worke of the righteous: I ſaid, that this alſo is vanity.
               
               HEre Solomon beginneth to declare how vanity is increaſed, by the vncertainty and variableneſſe of the diuine adminiſtration of all things, as they appeare to carnall reaſon, or worldly wiſedome, which cannot comprehend the ſecrets of Gods infinite wiſedome, in the gouernment and diſpoſition of all things. For thoſe things are in meaſure reuealed onely to Gods ſecret ones. They that feare him, and keepe his Commandements, as Dauid ſaith, are wiſer then the experienſt aged, and worldly teachers. But Solomon ſpeaketh here of the vanities of all worldly things in ſtate of corruption, both within man, and without man, not of the gifts and graces of Gods children, to whom all things are ſanctified, and greateſt miſeries turned into comfort, and meanes to felicity, which to the naturall man are ſorrow, and beginnings of endleſſe ſorrow. For though euery carnall man ſtriue to worke a contentation, and felicity out of them, yet ſhall he neuer doe it, but trouble and ſorrow ſhall be his portion, when he hath ſtriuen with might and maine all his life, when he hath ſalued, and ſmeeted, and skinned ouer, and with what gentle deceitfull lenitiues he can, healed himſelfe; yet ſhall all be rotten within, and vanity ſhall breake out as filth out of an old feſtered ſore skinned ouer, or a rotten egge broken vnder the Hen, at the time of her hatching.
               
                  There is a vanitie which is done vpon earth. As if he ſhould ſay; when I conſidered th
                     •
                   condition of men in the world, both the good, and the bad, him that doth his duty in that ſtate of life wherein God had placed him, and him that doth it not, him that feareth before God, and him that caſteth

the feare of God; then I ſaw another thing contrary to mans reaſon, namely, that there were iuſt men, who deſerued praiſe and preferment, but they had the reward of the wicked, and there were wicked men who deſerued to be diſgraced and puniſhed, but they were countenanced in their wickedneſſe, and by wickedneſſe obtained preferment. Neither had the iuſt man a benefactor, nor the wicked man an auenger, the godly man oppreſſed had no deliuerer, nor the ſinner oppreſſing any that would curbe, and puniſh him. But contrarily, the vngodly man flouriſhed as a greene bay tree in fauour, proſperity, and honour; wealth and honour was heaped vpon him: on the other ſide, the godly was wounded with the tongue, deſpiſed, and ſuppreſſed, and ſubiect to many afflictions and miſeries; his goodneſſe was not regarded, his wiſedome ſet at naught, and both enuyed. But vice was ſet aloft, and the vicious exalted. In which caſe there ſeemed to be no prouidence of God in the World, but confuſion and chance rather, or a careleſſe ouer-ſight, things being carried topſie turuy, without all regard. And this was alſo vanity among many others before ſpecified.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 15: 
                  Then I commended mirth, becauſe a man hath no better thing vnder the Sunne, then to eate, and to drinke, and to be merrie: for that ſhall abide with him of his labour, the dayes of his life, which God giueth him vnder the Sunne.
               
               A Concluſion and conſequence of the right conſideration and vſe of worldly things. And I commended mirth, &amp;c. Seeing that there is ſuch confuſion and diſorder in all things, which no man can comprehend, nor redreſſe; I thought it beſt for a man to caſt off all vnprofitable and endleſſe curioſity, which is irkeſome and grieuous to the fleſh; and to cheere his body, and reioyce his heart with thoſe worldly goods, which God hath by honeſt labour

and trauell in a lawfull calling beſtowed on him, ſeeing that that is the fruit that onely ſhall abide with him, and for that end hath God giuen them, which vſe onely is to be made of them, and none other, all the dayes that a man liueth here vnder the Sunne.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 16.
                  When I applyed mine heart to know wiſedome, and to ſee the buſineſſe that is done vpon the earth: (for alſo there is that neither day nor night ſeeth ſleepe with his eyes.) 
                  Verſe 17. 
                  Then I beheld all the worke of God, that a man cannot find out the worke that is done vnder the Sunne, becauſe though a man labour to ſeeke it out; yea, further, though a wiſe man thinke to know it, yet ſhall he not be able to finde it.
               
               A Confirmation of the former conſequence, concerning the right conſideration &amp; vſe of worldly things, namely, that it is better to reioyce in that which God giueth for the preſent, then curiouſly to ſearch out the works of God for further contentment. The reaſon is drawne from the vnprofitableneſſe of ſuch kind of labour, becauſe it is endleſſe, and fruitleſſe, which he proueth. Firſt, by his owne endeauour, and other mens alſo, in this verſe. Secondly, by the iſſue or euent thereof, which is a knowledge of the impoſſibility of that which ſeemed poſſible, verſe 17.
               Concerning the firſt. In the time when I applied mine heart to know wiſedome: When I ſet mine heart with full reſolution to know by diligent ſearch, as God had giuen me extraordinarie gifts and meanes to ſeeke out this vnknowne wiſedome of God in the adminiſtration of things here below, and to ſee the buſineſſe that is done vpon the earth, to ſee the reaſon, and to finde out the good of mens great labours, and endleſſe toyle in all places and ages, which are full of ſtrife and contention about obtaining ſome great matter, which in a confuſed imagination

and hope they ayme at. For alſo there is that neither day nor night ſeeth ſleepe with his eyes. For there is that ſtriueth by all indeauour of body and minde, night and day; one labouring by practiſe to obtaine, another by the ſtudies of learning, and learned obſeruations to ſearch out that imagined good, and the right meanes to obtaine it, which are the ſecret wayes and pathes of God, whereof they imagine to themſelues a certaine poſſibilitie: Then I beh
                        •
                     ld all the worke of God, that a man cannot finde out the worke that is done vnder the Sunne. I ſaw that the way of diuine adminiſtration, by which all things, and euery thing is gouerned and ordered, exceeded all apprehenſion, and capacitie of man. This was the iſſue and euent of my labour, and exerciſe of my wiſedome in this buſineſſe, euen impoſſibilitie to finde it out. For, or becauſe though a man labour to ſeeke it out, yet ſhall he not finde it. A reaſon of the impoſſibilitie. Let a man labour, euen the beſt Emperike in this kinde, by manifold experience, and by greateſt contention, and extention of ſtrength and wit continually to ſeeke it out, yet ſhall his labour be all loſt. This reaſon is figured by a Reuocation, or Correction in the next words, Yea, further though a wiſe man thinke to know it, yet ſhall be not bee able to finde it. Euery man is an emperike in this kinde, but what ſhall I ſpeake of the vndergatherers, or aftergatherers, and ſhort witted ones? For let the learned man that hath gifts and meanes, and ſeperateth himſelfe to this diligent ſearch, who is able to comprehend in minde the whole frame of the world, both the conditure and vſe of this great engine, that comprehendeth at once the ſtate and courſe of times from the creation till this preſent, that can deſcend from the moſt vniuerſall nature to the moſt particular, and contrarily, this is the beſt reader and interpreter of the booke of nature, this is hee that thinketh and hopeth to finde out the workes of God; let this man I ſay, doe what he can, yet

ſhall he not be able to finde it, but be toſſed about in a Labyrinth, or as a way-faring man in an vnknowne deſart. If a man cannot define any thing becauſe the formes of things are vnknowne, if he know not the creatures themſelues, ab imo ad ſummum, neither ſhall he know the wiſedome of God in the vſe of them. The world is Gods engine by which he worketh, he that cannot know the engine, cannot know the worke that may be done with it. The wiſedome of God in the making and vſing of this engine, is infinite, conſtant, certaine, and vnchangeable, not to be comprehended of that which is finite, imperfect, and changeable. Therefore there is nothing better then to reioyce in that which God giueth, with contentment, in the feare of God. This hath hee giuen vs, the reſt hath he reſerued to himſelfe. It is enough for the ſeruant to doe his maſters will, to vnderſtand what hee reuealeth to him, and commandeth, not to inquire into his ſecrets, and demaund reaſons. For then ſhall hee be no longer a ſeruaut, but his maſters fellow, and equall. But God will haue no equals nor fellowes, neither can he.
            
         
         
            
            CHAPTER IX.
            
               
                  Verſe 1. 
                  For all this I conſidered in my heart, euen to declare all this, that the righteous, and the wiſe, and their workes are in the hand of God: no man knoweth either loue, or hatred, by all that is about him.
               
               
                  THis Chapter is an explication of the vanity aforeſaid, verſe 14. chap. 8. increaſed by the inſtabilitie, and variableneſſe of diuine adminiſtration, or aeconomie, as it ſeemeth to carnall reaſon, or outward appearance. And alſo of the conſequence of the right conſideration and vſe of worldly things, verſe 15. The maine ſubſtance and ſcope is, that the diuine gouernement both in ciuill and naturall policie, both of man and all things with man, is ſecret and vnknowne to man, that there ſeemeth to be nothing in the world but at axie and anomie, diſorder and confuſion, which plainely euinceth that no man can by any endeauour or wiſedome, worke or finde out any good to himſelfe by or in them. Which thing ſome men vainely labour to doe. Others againe, vpon this conſideration take occaſion to be diſſolute, and Epicuriſh beaſts. But the maine intent of the holy Ghoſt, is to teach men to quiet their hearts in contentment with their lot, and to ſeeke for the chiefe good elſewhere, euen in feare and obedience, chap. 12. 13. Of which good euery ſtate and condition of life is partaker (elſe could it not be the chiefe good) becauſe all worldly things are but ſubſeruant to this good, God hauing turned the curſe into a bleſſing to them that beleeue, and is therefore ſubſeruant to this good alſo. So that the pooreſt may enioy it as well as the richeſt, and the greateſt Monarch in the world.

This explication is made by an induction of particular examples in this chapter, The firſt is of the euent of all perſons, to the verſe 7. The ſecond is of the euent of the deedes and endeauours of men, verſe 7. 8. 9. 10. The third is of the euent of counſell and wiſedome, verſe 13. to the end.
               
                  For all this I conſidered in my heart, euen to declare all this. This is the firſt example of induction. For] is here a note of a concluſion. q. d. Whereas I ſaid before that to ſome iuſt men it happened according to the deedes of the wicked, and contrarily, which is confuſion, diſorder, and vanitie: And that therefore it is the beſt thing for a man to eate, drinke, and to be merry, which thing onely is certaine to him, becauſe no man can finde out the worke that is done vnder the Sunne, as I my ſelfe and many others alſo haue found by much ſtudy and experience; therefore euen for this cauſe haue I let that curious and vaine ſearch alone, and conſidered another thing in mine heart, to which euen by common obſeruation daily before mine eyes I was inforced, namely to vnderſtand all this perfectly, and manifeſtly to declare all this, as followeth, that the righteous, and the wiſe, and their workes, and whatſoeuer befalleth them, as alſo contrarily, the wicked, the fooliſh, and their wicked follies, &amp;c. Which words are vnderſtood by anantapodoſis, or ellipſis, are in the hand of God, ſet apart from the power, diſpoſition and will of man, and gouerned by a ſecret way, vnknowne to man, and by mans wiſedome vnſearcheable. No man knoweth loue or hatred of all that is before them. Henee it is that no man is able to determine of Gods loue or hatred by any thing ſubiect to man, whether good, or euill things, perfections or defects, whether naturall gifts of mind and body, or outward poſſeſſions, or any thing that occurreth to the ſenſes and minde of the naturall man. Therefore it muſt needes be a vaine labour, and fruitleſſe, ſtudie to ſeeke for any profit, contentation or happineſſe, in any

thing by the endeauour of mans wiſedome here vnder the Sunne. Yet is euery man of the earth thus vaine, neither can he be otherwiſe.

                  All things come alike to all: there is one euent to the righteous, and to the wicked, to the good, and to the cleane, and to the vncleane, to him that ſacrificeth, and to him that ſacrificeth not: as is the good, ſo is the ſinner; and he that ſweareth, as he that feareth an oath.

For all things come alike to all, that is to ſay▪ wit, and ſimplicity; beauty▪ &amp; deformity; health, and ſickneſſe; ſoundneſſe, and diſeaſes; wealth, and pouerty; ſtrength, and weakneſſe; abundance, and want; long life, and vntimely death; ioy, and ſorrow; honour, and ignominie: finally, all kindes of proſperities and aduerſities, happineſſes and miſeries in this World happen to all, as well to the iuſt as to the wicked, and contrarily. All men are ſubiect to the ſame things, both the good and the cleane, and the filthy that is polluted with all kindes of vices, hee that ſacrificeth (a Synecdoche of the ſpeciall) hee that worſhippeth God, and diligently exerciſeth himſelfe in all Chriſtian duties, and he that is a contemner of Religion, a ſcorner of deuotion, a mocker of the godly, and their liues; there is the ſame condition of life, and fruition of earthly things, both to the good man, and to the ſinner, to him that ſweareth without reuerence of God, and maketh no conſcience of periury, as to him that dreadeth to vſe lightly the name of God in his mouth, much more for to ſweare falſly, but maketh conſcience both of his deedes and words.

                  This is an euill among all things that are done vnder the Sunne, that there is one event vnto all: yea alſo the heart of the ſonnes of men is full of euill, and madneſſe is in their heart while they liue, and after that they go to the dead.
               
               AN amplification of the former vanitie by a compariſon of all other euills or vanities, figured by an Exclamation or Indignation. This is of all vanities the chiefeſt, and moſt grieuous to mans reaſon, yet not to be thought on with patience, that it ſhould be done to the wicked as to the good▪ that of men ſo much differing, as light from darkeneſſe, heauen from hell, there ſhould be made no difference in the diſpenſation of worldly things, as though there were neither wiſdome nor iuſtice in the world but plaine chance and blinde fortune ſeruing all alike. Yea alſo the heart of the ſonnes of men is full of euill, &amp;c. A continuation of the compariſon figured by a Climax or gradation. As it is a moſt vaine and grieuous thing, that the ſame euent ſhould be to all men, ſo doth this aggrauate their miſerie, that the hearts of men all the time of their life, are full of griefe, ſorrow, wrath, enuy, angu ſh,

                  For to him that is ioyned to all the liuing, there is hope: for a liuing Dogge is better then a dead Lion.
               
               A Reaſon, why that death augmenteth this grieuous vanitie. For to him that is ioyned to all the liuing▪
                   &amp;c. The Hebrew is, Ki mi a ſher jebuchar, quia vter ſit, qui eligatur,
                  
Firſt, becauſe whether of them he be that is choſen, that is to ſay, whether the iuſt or the vniuſt, he that maketh conſcience of his wayes, or he that liueth in his luſts be approued of thee, whoſe wayes and maner of life thou beſt likeſt, and moſt followeſt; when he is dead there is an end of all, and vſe of all both good and euill. But to him that is yet remayning amongſt the liuing, there is euer ſtill ſome pleaſing hope, and delightfull expectation of better things to the contentation of a mans minde. As he hath a preſent fruition of good things, ſo hath hee ſtill an hope of more, and if of euill things, as croſſes and troubles, dabit Deus his quoque finem, they ſhall haue an end, and the remembrance of euills paſt, ſhall affect the minde in time to come, I know not with what delight. The remembrance and relation of things paſt, euen of troubles and dangers delight the aged, as a deſire of hearing, ſeeing, and looking into the world tickleth the young that are vnexperienced. For the world promiſeth to the young man great matters, it putteth them in great and proude hopes, but it performeth I know not what. 
                     •
                  t beateth him home that will needes rauen and range. He therefore that hath euaded out of many dangers and euills, is better then he that knoweth not the difference. Therefore to the liuing there is ſtill a feeding hope of a better condition in this inexhauſt treaſurehouſe of the variable world repleniſhed with innumerable bleſſings and benefits of all ſorts.
               
                  For a liuing Dogge is better than a dead Lion. The former ſpeach is figured heere by a prouerbiall ſentence. He that is but poore and of meane eſtate, is better then the man of authoritie, ſtrength, wealth, and honour that is dead, who hath loſt the ſocietie of the liuing, the good things and pleaſures of this life (whatſoeuer they be, or howſoeuer mixed) and is cut off from all hopes, and ioyfull complacence in the fruition of things deſired.

                  For the liuing know that they ſhall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither haue they any more a reward; for the memorie of them is forgotten.
               
               A Reaſon why that the poore man liuing is better then the corpſe of the noble. For the liuing know that they ſhall die. They know that they cannot alwayes liue here, but while they liue, they enioy the bleſſings of God here, which all men do deſire, and in hope and poſſibilitie the poore man yet liuing enioyeth all things. For God ſheweth forth many examples of exalting and humbling, that the meaneſt may hope, and the greateſt may feare. For they riſe and fall by him, not by themſelues▪ The careleſſe oft times attaineth to great wealth, and the wreſtling niggard commeth to pouertie, but neither of them can deſcribe how. Likewiſe, the remembrance of death doth put them in mind of their end, and their account, to refraine from euill, and to prepare themſelues to die in ioy and comfort, by purging their hearts and conſciences more and more through daily renouation of faith and repentance. For which cauſe a man at the point of death deſireth to liue but one houre longer, thinking himſelfe for that, better then him that is dead alreadie; the lifting vp of his heart and hands once more, giueth great contentment to him: and if after that he is dead in the iudgement of his friends, he reuiue againe but to looke vp on them, and to ſpeake two or three words, it giueth them wonderfull ſatisfaction. But the dead is depriued of all. There is no knowledge of any thing in the graue, no more hope, no repentance.
               
                  Neither haue they any more a reward. They can adde nothing further to themſelues in any reſpect, neither can any good thing more be hoped for, being cut off from all poſſibilities. Againe, as the time of labour is here, ſo is the meanes of reward here: as he here worketh, ſo ſhall his reward be increaſed: as he ſoweth, ſo ſhall he reape in this world, and in the world to come.
               
                  
                  For the memorie of them is forgotten. Whatſoeuer they haue ſaid and done here, though they haue ſtriuen to draw all eyes and eares after them alone, yet now is there not any thought of them, but they are as though they had neuer bene borne into the world, in reſpect of the liuing. Both their future hopes, and their glorie paſt is vaniſhed away, as ſmoake in the aire, as the bodie into duſt, and duſt into the winde, which diſperſeth it all ouer the earth and the waters.

               AN amplification by an enumeration of ſome particulars. Alſo their loue and their hatred, &amp;c. Theſe words are to be taken actiuely, whether in the good or euill ſence, thus: Their loues, kindneſſes, liberalities one towards another, their feaſtings and reioycings one with another, &amp;c. for which they were praiſed and extolled of men here, is periſhed. Their hatred, oppoſition, contention, reuenge, their glorie in ouerthrowing and vanquiſhing their aduerſaries, which alſo is a bleſſing promiſed to the godly, though the godly glorie not herein carnally, as the wicked do, but as the wicked are enemies firſt to the Lord, and to them for the Lord. In this ſence the Saints in heauen reioyce at the vengeance of the wicked which perſecute he Church, and waite for the day of vengeance, as men reioyce when their grounds are purged of weeds and ſerpents; all this, I ſay, is now periſhed. Their enuie alſo, emulation and ambition, contention of honour and preferment, is now periſhed.
               
                  Neither haue they any more a portion for euer▪
                   &amp;c. They are now no longer partakers of earthly things, that are ſo much deſired and hoped of the liuing, no fruite of any facultie, or poſſeſſion redoundeth to them, they haue no part, no footing here any longer, but are ſwallowed vp of the graue, the pit hath ſhut her mouth vpon them; ſo that their paths

and wayes of life are cloſed vp as the paths of a ſhip in the waters and of a bird or arrow in the aire. The intent of the holy Ghoſt in all theſe things, is to ſhew the vanitie of life and death; to crucifie the world to vs, and vs to the world, that we might liue in the Lord, and not to giue way to diſſolute, careleſſe, epicuriſh liuing, as the wicked doe interprete all things according to their luſts, and vſe them to their damnation, which by words and deeds they call vnto them.

               THeſe next foure verſes are an explication of the conſequence, verſ. 15. chap. 8 by an enumeration or an hypotypôſis of the vſe of worldly things, by way of an exhortation or permiſſion of their comfortable and ioyfull vſe, whereof many make ſome doubt; as man is moſt apt to place a deuotion and conſcience in things indifferent, with neglect of that which is neceſſarie. Our owne things pleaſe vs beſt, but other mens we ſee a farre off, and are coldly affected. So we deale with God. But the kingdome of God ſtandeth not in meates, drinkes, wedlocks, &amp;c. which are worldly and tranſitorie things, but in a new creature. For no ordinance of God is to be diſanulled. But if we be renewed, all things ſhall become holy to vs. For to the pure, all things are pure and holy: otherwiſe, the beſt things are vncleane to vs, and defiled by vs. We are not vnder the bondage of any thing, but all things are ſubſeruant to vs, and lawfull, except in caſe of offence. Go thy way. The firſt particular is of the comfortable vſe of meates and drinkes. Giue ouer thy carefull and vnprofitable ſtudies, and idle ſpeculations, leaue ſecret things to the Lord; be content with that which he giueth by lawfull meanes in a lawfull calling; deſire not other mens labours, pled not in difficult, hard and vneuen by-paths with griefe and greedie deſire, but eate thy bread with ioy, liue comfortably of that

which thou haſt; caſt thy care vpon God. Drinke thy wine with a merrie heart: Let faith &amp; peace of conſcience expell the bitterneſſe of diſtruſt and feare; the arme of the Lord is not ſhortened, nor his hand emptied; thy care can neither adde nor diminiſh: the Lord is mercifull, not cruell to leaue his ſeruants; he is bountifull, not niggardly; if he tarrie long, it is but to trie thee. Though he kill thee, as Iob ſaith, yet beleeue in him. Hope in God, ſaith Dauid, doe good
                     •
                  , dwell in the land, and thou ſhalt be fed. Eate and drinke therefore with an hopefull heart, comfort thy bodie with thy goods, For God accepteth thy workes. Becauſe thou art not carefull, diſtruſtfull, fearfull, not leaning to thine owne wiſedome, not relying on thine owne prouidence, nor arrogating the gift of God to thy ſelfe, and bleſſing thy ſelfe as infidels doe, therefore doth God accept thy workes, for he accepteth thy perſon, and hath taken thee into his protection and wardſhip: therefore eate with ioy, drinke with mirth, liue in comfort. Obſerue here, that firſt we muſt pleaſe God by faith in him, which is his owne gift and worke. Secondly, when he is thus pleaſed, then doe our perſons pleaſe him, we are his, and accepted of him in his Sonne, in whom we beleeue. Thirdly, when he accepteth our perſons, then do our workes pleaſe him, both religious exerciſes, and externall workes, as eating, drinking, feaſting, reioycing, apparelling, marrying, &amp;c. For God is glorified in all things by his children. For they reſpect the glorie of God their maine end, not the ſatisfying of the fleſh in the affections and luſts thereof. The feaſts of Abraham and Iobs children were accepted of God: the royall attire of Solomon, Dauid, Heſter, pleaſed the Lord, becauſe their perſons pleaſed him. The Wedding dinner of the Iewes pleaſed Chriſt, Ioh. 2. 2. The labour of the husbandman and tradeſman: the honeſt care of euery houſholder, the worke of euery ſeruant pleaſeth him. Faith and a good conſcience remoueth away the curſe from vs, and then are all things bleſſed to vs.

As God hath crcated all things for the ſeruice and vſe of man, aſwel for ſatiety delight, and pleaſure, as for neceſſitie, not onely skinnes of beaſts, haire and wooll for cloathing, but alſo ſilkes, and fine linnen for elegance, and ornament, and hath giuen an vnderſtanding heart to man to find out the skill and knowledge of converting them to a mans comfortable vſe; he may alſo vſe the ſame according to the dignity of his perſon, yet in modeſtie and ſobrietie, in careleſſe comelineſſe, to ſhew forth reuerend gravitie, not contemptible leuitie, as phantaſticall apiſhneſſe is now in moſt people ridiculous, making themſelues ſpectacles of folly one to another, as though the ſoule were made for the apparrell, and the apparrell, to ſhew forth the luſt of the body, which is in theſe dayes like the fire of hell, deuouring vp all things, firing men and women of all ſorts out of their poſſeſſions, and bringing many into deſperation, their pompous ſhewes ending in ignominie, and making them by-words to the baſeſt people.

In thoſe countries there are many aromaticall plants, and much vſe of oyntments which are in thoſe places moſt precious, and delicious, vſed for the refreſhing of the ſpirits with the fragrant odours thereof.

               A Third particular, is of wedlocke, or houſe-keeping. Liue ioyfully, &amp;c. As heretofore he hath ſhewed, that wiſedome, in reſpect of worldly goods, is the gift of God to extenuate the miſeries of this vaine life, and that both in their getting and ſpending; and alſo, that fellowſhip and community of life in mutuall duties, is a great meanes alſo; ſo heere he ſheweth, that in aeconomie or wedlocke, coniugall loue and ſocietie is a means alſo, and the gift of God, Prouerbs 18. 22. whereby many miſeries in houſe-keeping, and vexations from without alſo, are auoyded or mittigated.
               
                  Liue ioyfully, &amp;c. This he ſpeaketh not as though euery thing in wedlocke were lawfull, ſeeing that it ſerueth ſpecialy for the procreation of children for the ſupply of Gods Church, and accompliſhment of the number of the Elect: and alſo to auoyd fornication, not for brutiſhneſſe, and laſciuiouſneſſe, after the manner of the heathen, and Epicures, who pamper their bodies by all meanes, and deuices for none other ends. To this end the Apoſtle, Rom. 13. 13. exhorts Chriſtians to liue honeſtly as in the day, not in gluttony and drunkenneſſe, nor yet in chambering and wantonneſſe, for marriage is honourable, Hebr. 13. 4. and the lawfull vſe of Matrimony in theſe words, and the bed vndefiled. Which words are oppoſed to whooredome, and adulterie, whether it be with another, or a mans owne wife, the affections &amp; imagination being fixed on anothers. To bee briefe, his meaning is, that the continuance of coniugall amity, or firſt vnion of affections, which is the inward bond of matrimony, is a great meanes to auoyde much vanity, which ariſeth of the violating of this vnion. This ioyfull liuing is maintained by giuing due beneuolence, 1, Corinth. 7. 3. and

                  Gen. 26. 8. which text let a man interprete as he pleaſeth, I thinke that in all things for mans vſe, there is not onely a meere neceſſitie giuen of God, but alſo a ſatietie permitted, not ſaturitie, which in this kind is ſalacitie and proteruious behauionr. For if we muſt marrie in the Lord, as the Apoſtle there teacheth, then we muſt liue in the Lord, euen keepe our bodies vndefiled members of Chriſts bodie, elſe we cannot glorifie him in bodie and ſpirit, 1. Cor. 6. 20. To conclude, to weigh this and all things moderately and indifferently by wiſedome, let vs note what the Apoſtle ſaith, 1. Cor. 10. 13. There hath no tentation taken you, but ſuch as appertaineth to man. Yet his meaning is withall, that we ſhould aime at perfection in all things. Though God beare with our frailties and imperſections, yet we muſt not make a ſtand for all that, much leſſe grow remiſſe, but rather receiue comfort thereby, and thereupon encouragement in the way to perfection.
               
                  Whom thou loueſt. Whom thou haſt and doeſt ſympathize and affect aboue all other women. Loue is the procreant and conſeruant cauſe of this comfortable liuing. What this loue is, the Apoſtle ſetteth forth by a compariſon of Chriſts loue towards his Church, which is alſo illuſtrated by the Equall, he loued his Church as himſelfe, euen ſo muſt men loue their wiues, viz. as their owne bodies, Eph. 5. 25. &amp;c. And this ſhalt thou doe, if thou delighteſt in her loue, (in the Lord) Prou. 5. 19. as the louing Hind and pleaſant Roe loue their mates, if thou beeſt faithfull in regard of bodie and goods, that is, if thou liueſt onely to her, and for her in the Lord; if thou prouideſt for her, and maintaineſt her without fraud, according to thy eſtate; if thou paſſeſt by her infirmities, honouring her as the weaker veſſell, and kindly entertaineſt her friends for her ſake.
               
                  All the dayes. q. d. Loue one another, and liue comfortably together as long as ye liue together, as well in old age as in the flower of youth, as well in the fading as freſhneſſe of beautie. In that he ſaith, All the dayes, it is euident, that he meanes not Epicuriſh loue (as ſome thinke

he ſpeakes all here in the perſon of the Epicure) which proceedeth from luſt onely, and is grounded on outward beautie and meere fleſhly allurements, and vaniſh away with beautie, and that with youth.
               
                  Of thy moſt vaine life. This he often repeateth to curbe and draw backe roauing fancies and groundleſſe imaginations of I know not what happie contentation in this life, which withhold a man from preſent duties, and preſent comfortable vſe of things, and conſtancie, tormenting himſelfe with diſcontentment and vnſetledneſſe, and ſo wants or fully enioyes not ſuch comforts or mitigations of vanitie, as here by ſobrietie of wiſedome may be had.
               
                  Which he hath giuen thee vnder the Sunne. That is, which wife God hath giuen thee. A good wife is the gift of God, and of worldly comforts the chiefeſt, Prou. 18.

                  For that is thy portion. An argument of confirmation. As he ſaid before, that the comfortable vſe of worldly goods gotten with great labour, was the gift of God, or remedie to cheere the bodie in the vanitie thereof, Chap. 3. 13 and 5. 18. ſo here he ſaith, that the ioyfull, cheerfull, and comfortable vſe of wedlocke in the feare of God, is a mans portion, euen the chiefeſt and beſt good of outward goods, which who ſo wants, he can haue no ioy in any thing. For if in ripeneſſe of age he want this coniugall comfort, he is but halfe himſelfe, ſolitarie and mournefull. But if he be fellowed with a wicked woman, then he is euen no man, and wearie of life.
               
                  In this life. Many men imagine to themſelues a more complete and full portion then this, whereof they make this to be but a part, but yet it is the principall part, and remaineth to man when other faile. For whether a man be

in proſperitie or aduerſitie, in ſickneſſe or health, this is a liuing comfort, euen a ſpeciall remedie, and vniuerſall remedie appliable to him in euery ſtate. The faithfulneſſe of Ouids wife was an onely and ſpeciall comfort to him in his baniſhment, though ſhe was at Rome, and he in Pontus, as diuers of his Epiſtles make manifeſt.
               
                  And in thy labour, which thou takeſt vnder the Sunne. He ſaith not, this is the fruite or end of thy labour, which is the practiſe or life of ſwiniſh Epicures, whoſe labours are onely for bodily pleaſures▪ and pleaſure their whole felicitie; but in thy labour, in all thy trauels, troubles, ſorrowes, ſufferings, this is a remedie, reliefe, ſuccour, when a man hath a prudent, faithfull, and louing fellow to compaſſionate and communicate with him in euery ſtate and condition of life.

                  Whatſoeuer thine hand findeth to do, do it with thy might: for there is no worke, nor deuice, nor knowledge, nor wiſedome in the graue, whither thou goeſt.
               
               A Fourth particular of reioycing, is ſedulitie or diligence in a mans vocation, both in the workes of our Chriſtian calling, and of our particular calling. Whatſoeuer thine hand findeth to do▪
                   &amp;c. God hath giuen a gift or talent to euery man to be exerciſed therein, God layeth ſome work or buſineſſe before euery one: worke is prouided for him againſt his comming into the world: Ars long a, vita breuis: Skill, knowledge or art is long or difficult, buſineſſe is great, but life is ſhort and ſickly, time haſteth, and is irreuocable. Therefore performe thy dutie towards God, towards thy neighbours, towards thy ſelfe, without delay, while time and opportunitie laſteth: for God hath appointed a conuenient ſeaſon for euery thing, euen the leaſt thing. Thou haſt the gift, the worke, the time, the opportunitie and ſeaſon from him, obſerue and do thereafter. Then ſhall euery thing go well with thee, thou ſhalt preuent manifold croſſes and hinderances, thou ſhalt haue a quiet and peaceable conſcience, and auoide this vanitie, euen the penaltie of idleneſſe, which is pouertie and ſorrow, and many

euills. For whereinſoeuer we ſinne, therein ſhall we be puniſhed; That is Gods vnchangeable decree. Therefore ſayth Salomon, the ſtrong man attayneth to riches, and ſo to what comforts riches may bring. Surely, whatſoeuer befalleth a man, if it be not through his owne idleneſſe and follie, it is not grieuous, but he taketh it as from the hand of God, and is well contented, being for his good ſome way, and for Gods glory, as the example of Iob teſtifieth. Doubtleſſe this was a great comfort to Iob in his extreamitie, euen the conſcience of his innocencie, ſinceritie and godly indeuors at all times. This ſuſtained him againſt the temptations of Satan, of his kinsfolkes, and his wife, for at this time he was throughly tried, his comfort was onely in God, and his good conſcience.
               
                  For there is no worke, nor deuice, &amp;c. A confirmation. The time of working is in this life, it ceaſeth in the graue. Heere may a man reioyce in his worke, but when the night cometh, a man leaueth working, and receiueth his wages; no man ſhall be benefited by thy workes, wiſedome, skill, or counſell, when thou art dead, neyther canſt thou praiſe God, nor glorifie him in the graue. For here is the time of vſing, and beſtowing thoſe gifts that God hath giuen for his glorie in this life. The ſoule muſt be rewarded according to her workes done in the body, and by the body; but when the body is dead, the ſoule can worke no more for a reward. For her inſtrument wherewith ſhe worketh, is taken away for euer. If the ſoule glorifie not God with the body and bodily things (heare this yee Church-robbers, Bels, Iezebels
                        •

                     •
                   ſhall neuer glorifie him in heauens, but deſcend to him that is Lord of the fleſh and death. For the prophane and vncleane can haue no fellowſhip with the Saints in glorie, becauſe they are no members of Chriſt his myſticall body, they are in their menſtruous cloth, in their bloud, Ezeoh. 16.

                  I returned and ſawe vnder the Sunne, that the race is not to the ſwift, nor the battell to the ſtrong, neither yet bread to the wiſe, nor yet riches to men of vnderstanding▪
                     
nor yet fauour to men of skill, but time and chance happeneth to them all.

                  . I returned.) whereas I ſaid before, that ſedulitie and diligence is a meanes to auoyde or mitigate many vanities and euills, whereby to obtaine ſome contentation of minde in this vaine life▪ it is not ſo to be vnderſtood as that a man can by his owne indeuour obtaine it, neyther yet is hee to place any confidence in his gift or diligence, for they ſhall be either fruitfull or fruitleſſe to him▪ as pleaſeth God. For this is certaine that there is no certainetie in any thing, that man might feare God, and onely depend on him, and know that whatſoeuer he is, or hath, it is Gods▪ and in Gods diſpoſing to his owne glorie, who will do with his veſſells what pleaſeth him, he formeth thee, and vſeth thee in his wiſedome according to his owne will; but the vaine imaginations of man are infinite. I returned and ſaw vnder the Sunne. A confirmation of that which followeth by the teſtimony of his owne obſeruation. That the race is not to the ſwift, &amp;c. This haue I conſidered, that the vſe of thoſe faculties of body and minde, which God hath beſtowed on man, eyther in his birth, or by his induſtry, is not in mans power. For the race is not to the ſwift, nor battell to the ſtrong Againe, if a man being indued with theſe faculties, doth alſo vſe them, and vſe them well; yet the profite and fruit thereof is not in the power of him that vſeth them rightly. For doe we not ſee that bread is ſometimes wanting to the wiſe, money, meate, drinke, and apparrell to the learned, wealth to the prudent and men of vnderſtanding fauour and grace to men of learning and skill? Therfore both the facultie and gift it ſelfe, the exerciſe of the gift and the benefit of the exerciſe is to be referred to God, who is the author and diſpoſer of all gifts and euents. Surely, this ſeemeth to be a great vanitie and grieuous to carnall reaſon, that the ſwift ſhould looſe the benefit of the race, and

another that ſitteth ſtill receiue it; that the ſtrong man. ſhould looſe the reward of the battel, and the wiſe man who procureth much good vnto others, ſhould want neceſſary foode and payment; that the prudent and man of counſell, by whom publique and priuate ſtates are ſettled, vpheld, and maintained, ſhould want riches, and that men of skill, ſhould want good will and fauour. Againe, the ſwifteſt man ſometimes in running, looſeth the race, the ſtrong armie looſeth the battell. So Abraham with his three hundred ſeruants put foure Kings to flight, Geneſ. 14. Gedeon with the found of Trumpets murdered the hoſte of the Madianites, Iudges 7. Dauid ſlew the Grant Goliah, 1. King. 17. Leonidas with ſixe hundred men maſſacred fiue hundred thouſand of Xerxes hoſte. Tomyris Queene of Scythia, deuouted vp the whole hoſte of Cyrus, whoſe force Babylon could not reſiſt. So Iudas Maccabeus cut downe his ſtrong enemies on euery ſide. What ſhould I ſpeake of the Prophets of Chriſt, and the Apoſtles the lights and life of the world? What was the reward of their wiſedome, their gifts and labours? And why? Becauſe dogges muſt haue meate howſoeuer, gluttons muſt ſurcharge their ſtomacks, whores muſt 
                     •
                  ide in coaches, and fare deliciouſly, and goe ſumptuouſly; ſcuballs, that doe nothing but deuiſe how to grace a luſtfull corps are thought worthy of any thing, of all they haue, be it neuer ſo much. But Chriſt in his Miniſters, as he was in his owne perſon, muſt be expoſed to deriſion and contempt; any thing is enough for a Prieſt, they muſt want neceſſaries in their greateſt labours, as the Iſraelites did in Egypt. But Bel▪
                   and Iezebel, &amp; lay Impropriators areſuperfluous enough; but wherein they ſinne, therein ſhall they be puniſhed, let all men obſerue how they proſper, or whether he depriue them of his grace, at leaſt of continuance of temporall bleſſings, as they with-hold his coate from him, and ſhare it among them. Let, I ſay, euery man of wiſdome note this, and then tell me how many eſcape vengeance. Miniſters muſt worke on the weeke day for neceſſary food (to make their title of Gentlemen ridiculous) &amp; earne with great pains the other halfe of their gowne, if they can, and

ſpend their ſtrength on the Sabbath day, while greedy Bel is all for his body, to make it fat and ſhining, and Iezebel for the ſhew: yet they ſit with bookes in their hands, as in Ezechiels time, they can reade and talke to pride in their wits, their talking is but the crackling of thornes vnder a pot. For the one taketh away the Miniſters food to giue it to dogs, and feed horſes, and for voluptuous liuing; and the other plucks off his coate, to further the beautifying of a carrion-Idoll. But if he will pleaſe Bel, and admire Iezebel, (for ſhe lookes about to ſee who lookes on her) then he ſhall be allowed ſomewhat, the crummes vnder their table, a dinner or a ſupper, to ſee and praiſe their fineneſſe, and to be blinded with Marthaes courteſie. Bel and Iezebel are the moderators and cenſurers of his Sermons, if the ſtyle and phraſe be right, (that is, nothing to the purpoſe) the good ſeruant ſhall enter into the ioy of his maiſter and miſtreſſe. Stat fixum, the corpſe is the Idoll that now muſt be adored and glorified. The Prieſt muſt ſtoupe and yeeld his necke: why? becauſe the Frier domineered. Is there no difference betweene ſtaring and ſtarke mad? Stulti dum vitant vitia in contraria currunt, &amp; tandem coincidunt. As good the Frier, as the Atheiſt: as good Baal ſtill, as the Calues of Bethel, and Bel: as good the better extreame, as the worſe, if we muſt needs be in extreames: as good and better Superſtition then Atheiſme. If we beate the diuell out at the fore doore, and let him in at the backe doore, what are we the better? There muſt be a Iudas and an Antichriſt, euen ſo muſt there be an Atheiſt that can vſe the Scripture politickly, or Turklike frame a religion and conſcience to himſelfe, according to his luſts out of all opinions. For that he will bee a Papiſt, for this a Puritan, for that a Browniſt, for this an Anabaptiſt, or Familiſt, &amp;c. and for all a foole and a beaſt.
               
                  But time and chance commeth to them all. The time of riſing, falling, aduancement, deiection, fauour, diſgrace, plentie, ſcarcitie, &amp;c come to all, euen to the wiſeſt and moſt prouident, according to the appointment of God in his prouidence, whoſe wayes and meanes of effecting his

workes are vnſearchable. The old world knew not their time of viſitation. Sodome knew not her time, Ieruſalem knew not her time, Babylon knew not her time, the Whore of Babylon knoweth not her time till ſhe be troden vnder foote as dung, neither ſhall the laſt end of the world know their time. And as it is in viſitations and indgements, ſo is it alſo in mercies and deliuerances, that men might hereby be taught to feare God, and depend wholly on him.
               
                  And chance commeth to them all. It is chance in reſpect of vs, who are ignorant of cauſes, and improuident; not in reſpect of God, who doth all his workes in wiſedome, according to the eternall counſell of his will, and from whom no ſecret is hid, himſelfe being the orderer euen of all euill ſecrets to his owne glory and good of his elect. Therefore to God there is nothing chancefull or ſudden, but to vs all things are vncertaine, and chance bringeth to paſſe ſuch effects, as by all our owne ſtrength and wiſedome could neuer haue bene effected; yea oft times what we by our ſilly wiſedome and inſufficient ſtrength are plodding about, chance notably effecteth. Yet are we not to deſpiſe the meanes and gifts of God, no more then the husbandman neglecteth the times, tooles and meanes of earing and reaping. But we are hereby taught, that although a man hath all gifts and meanes, yet he muſt commit the bleſſing and ſucceſſe thereof to God.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 12. 
                  For man alſo knoweth not his time, as the fiſhes that are taken in an euill net, and as the birds that are caught in the ſnares, ſo are the ſons of men ſnared in an euill time, when it falleth ſuddenly vpon them.
               
               A Confirmation or reaſon of the former example of induction. For man alſo knoweth not his time. Theſe words ſeeme to be a compariſon from the equals. Man is ſo farre from hauing any power or command of himſelfe in the things aforeſaid, that he knoweth not what ſhall happen to him in any time, day, or houre, no more then other creatures. This he illuſtrateth by a ſimilitude, the protaſis
                  
or propoſition whereof is double: As the fiſhes are taken in an euill net, and as the birds that are caught in the ſnare, the apodoſis or redition: So are the ſonnes of men ſnared in an euill time. The fiſhes in their kinds are wiſe and prouident, ſuſpitious and cautelous, dreading many euils, and auoiding many dangers. For as they are cunning to inſnare and deuoure one another, ſo are they ſubtill to preuent euils, and defend themſelues, and to prouide and gather foode for the preſeruation of their kinde. The like may bee alſo ſaide of birds. But whereas all things are vnder the power and dominion of man, created for his ſeruice, and therefore hath alſo vnderſtanding and knowledge giuen him to ſerue himſelfe of the creatures, though they be high in the aire aboue him, and deepe in the waters beneath him, and farre in the forreſt from him, all out of his reach, giuing him as it were the farewell, and bidding defiance to him, as being in their owne power, and hauing nothing to do with him, nor he with them, as they imagine; yet can they not eſcape his hand, nor auoide his power, becauſe the decrre muſt ſtand, Gen. 1. 28. Be fruitfull, and repleniſh the earth, and ſubdue it, and haue dominion ouer the fiſh of the ſea, and ouer the fowle of the aire, and ouer euery liuing thing that moueth on the earth. Therfore cannot that which is in the depth of the aire, nor in the height of the ſeas, nor in the far corners of the wilderneſſe, nor that buildeth in rockes and tops of trees, nor that is hidden in the thicke buſhes and hollow trees, nor that lurketh in dens and caues of the earth, nor which is bedded in the mud and rootes of flags, nothing can eſcape his nets, grins, hookes, bates, but they are taken vnawares, they know not how, nor by whom, they willingly runne their heads into the net, their feete into the ſnare, their iawes to the hooke; all which traps they either ſee or diſcerne not, or elſe they are ſo priuily layed and diſguiſed, that they ſee not. For man is wiſer then beaſts, he comprehendeth them, but they cannot comprehend him. As the ſoule of man exceedeth beaſts, ſo doth God exceed men: yet like beaſts, they thinke that they are far out of his ſight: hee is in the height of heauen, they are in the depth and lower parts of

the earth, they are couered with the clouds, as Adam was hid from him in the thickets of the garden▪ 
                  Gen. 3. 10. as at the day of iudgement they ſhall runne into caues and holes of the rockes to hide them, and vnder the bottomes of mountaines if it were poſſible; yea and they couer with a couering, hiding their counſels deepe from the Lord, and keeping cloſe their deuice in the bottome of their heart from the Lord. They neuer thinke of him, nor know him, though he walke in the midſt of them, no more then wilde beaſts, wilde foule and fiſhes know man their ſoueraigne, being alwayes among them, and in their ſight, but they diſcerne him not. For though the wittie wicked thinke himſelfe to be the wiſeſt, yet he is a foole, Pſal. 14▪ 1. and a beaſt. And of foule, beaſts and fiſhes there is a generoſitie and a ruſticitie, an innocencie and a crueltie, yet all is beaſt. God comprehendeth man, and all things, but he is infinite, and comprehended of nothing. The ſubtilty of the wicked is but fooliſhneſſe, he puts his foote into the trap, his heele into the grin, his necke into the ſnare, with prouidence and cunning, as the greedy fiſh and rauenous foule, that hee alone may ſwallow vp all the hooke into his throate, and be firſt taken. He diggeth vp a pit, and falleth into it himſelfe; he hideth his trap priuily, and his owne foote is taken. He imagineth that all things muſt giue way to his wiſedome and counſell, for God is not in all his thoughts: but when he leaſt ſuſpecteth, God that is greater then he, whoſe power, command, ſoueraigntie and glory he neuer regarded, ſtriketh him ſuddenly, and intangleth him in his owne nets and traps. Sennacherib, Antiochus, Nabuchadnezzar, Alexander, were become Behemoths and Leuiathans, Elephants and Whales, ſurpaſſing the common condition of men, Heroes, or Demi-gods; ſwords, ſtau
                     •
                  s, hookes, lines, ſnares, nets, were but ſticks and cobwebs: but in their greateſt rage and tumult he putteth his hooke into their noſes, and turneth them about with his bridle, Eſa. 
                  
                     •
                  7. 29. The wicked conceiue miſchiefe, and bring forth iniquitie, and their belly prepareth deceit, Iob 15. 35▪ as did Achitophel, Haman▪ Iudas, &amp;c. but they ſuddenly

periſh, and come to a fearefull end. For there is a ſnare in the proſperitie and hopes of the wicked. They are trap-makers and ſnare-ſetters for others, and others for them. For ſo are the wits of the wicked exerciſed all their dayes. They walke about with ſnares and nets, and walke among ſnares &amp; traps. Now are they takē ſuddenly in their owne, now ſuddenly in other mens. They are preuented by ſudden death, as the vnripe grape is ſhaken off, and the flower of the oliue with a ſtormie blaſt or nipping Eaſt winde, and their glorious verdure is withered in a moment, as the ioyous and luxurious graine is blaſted with lightning. Amnon periſhed when his heart was merry with wine, 2. Sam. 13. 29. Belteſhazzar periſhed ſuddenly in the night of a feſtiuall day, Dan. 6. 30. Nabuchadnezzar in the ſame houre that he exalted himſelfe aboue all power, was diſrobed of his royaltie, turned into a beaſt, and driuen out from amongſt men. The rich man, in the ſame night that he bleſſed himſelfe in the reuiew of his worldly poſſeſſions, was carried away to hell. The old world was ſwept all away with the floud, when they were eating, drinking, feaſting, marrying. So were the Sodomites in a morning, when they were ready to riſe from nightly venery to adorne their proud corpſe for meetings, to eating, drinking, gaming, to prouoke to luſt, and to make themſelues ſtrong for luſt. For they were rich, and deſpiſed the poore, they were farting full, and ſpuing full, proud beaſts, they regarded not the afflictions of Ioſeph, but were cruell, and mad againſt thoſe that reproued them, as their dealings and ſpeeches to Lot do teſtifie. We in this land are growing into this veine, to be crafty and proud donaughts, the child teaching the father, being it ſelfe reprobate to euery good worke.

The Preface as in this verſe; This wiſedome haue I ſeene alſo, &amp;c. This worke of Gods wiſedome doe I alſo obſerue, and it is a thing not vn-uſuall, but it is to mans reaſon ſtrange and wonderfull. Firſt, that a man of counſell and wiſedome ſhould be poore. Secondly, that the benefit and vſe of his wiſedome ſhould redound to the vnthankefull, who being protected and inriched by his wiſedome, ſhould notwithſtanding leaue him deſtitute, and let him liue in pouertie ſtill. Which thing is euery where now adayes verified in many worthy ſeruants of Chriſt, whoſe paines in the Goſpel is of great deſert, and the benefit thereof ineſtimable.

               There was a little Citie, and few men within it: and there came a great King against it, and beſieged it, and built great bulwarkes againſt it.

                  Now there was found in it a poore wiſe man, and he by his wiſedome deliuered the Citie, yet no man remembred that ſame poore man.
               
               THE Narration or Parable it ſelfe in theſe two verſes, There was a Citie; little in it ſelfe, and the inhabitants were few. It was neyther fortified with Towers, Caſtles, ſtrong Walls, nor Gates of ſtrength, nor yet prouided of men and munition for the battell. And a powerfull King came againſt it with a great army: hee layd ſiege to it, and built great bulwarkes againſt it, and made engines to batter it downe vpon them. Now amongeſt all the rich, the ſtrong, the honourable, there was found a man of a verie meane eſtate (as God beſtoweth his gifts as pleaſeth him on the poore, and the young, Iob 32. 8. 9.) but yet a man of

wiſedome, iudgement, and counſell, who by his wiſedome deliuered this Citie. Euery man tooke notice of him, for they were in great feare and deſpaire; and they were all partakers of this benefit. Their wiues and children, liues and goods were preſerued by the wiſedome of this poore man. But what was the euent of his gift, and practiſe of his gift? What fruit redounded thereby to himſelfe?
               
                  There was no man that remembred that poore man. Both they and all that euer they had were in his hands; they receiued life and goods of him, for by his counſell he pulled the City out of the jawes of the enemy, who was ready to ſwallow it vp at once, whereas he might haue eſcaped free himſelfe and left them deſolate. Yet for all this, as Nabal dealt with Dauid, they regarded him not. For hauing obtained what they deſired, they let him ſhift for himſelfe, as wicked hypocrites vſe to deale with their painfull teachers, as they doe with their emptied figge-frayles, they forgot him, and tooke no notice afterwards of him. So the Butler of Pharaoh, being ſet at liberty, forgot the affliction of his fellow priſoner Ioſeph. Dauid was ill rewarded by Saul, who of enuy, becauſe the women ſung Anthemes of that worthy and wonderfull conqueſt of Goliah, perſecuted him with a wicked eye. Chriſt was ill rewarded by the nine Lepers, who being cleanſed of that grieuous diſeaſe, would not returne to giue him ſo much as bare thankes, not ſo much as to acknowledge the benefit. But he was worſe rewarded by him that being afflicted with an infirmity thirty and eight yeres, Ioh. 5. who after that he was cured, diſcouered him to his enemies that ſought his life, verſe 15. For he fearing the cruelty of the Phariſies reprouing him, verſe 10. reſpected his owne ſafety, as it may ſeeme. And the Pillars of our peace, plenty, and ſecurity in this Land, I doe meane, godly, painefull and profitable teachers are of many little regarded.

               AN amplification of the Parable by a Conſectary, ſhewing the excellence of wiſedome, and vſe thereof, in whomſoeuer it is, though the common ſort reſpect perſons and outward appearances, and admiring the rich and the ſtrōg, deſpiſe the ſame, or haue it ſmall in account. Then ſaid I, when I ſaw that ſtrength, multitude, riches, nobility, had no power in them to benefit the owners thereof in their greateſt want, nor to deliuer them out of iminent danger, but a poore man deſtitute of theſe helpes did it by wiſedome; Then I ſawe, I gathered by good conſequence, and learned, and alſo teach others what the excellence and dignitie of wiſedome is, and how that it is to be ſought for, and imbraced aboue all other deſirable things.
               
                  Wiſedome is better then ſtrength. An illuſtration of the excellence of wiſedome by an argument of the Leſſe. Strength is a thing admired and deſired of all; the ſtrong man glorieth, and ſecureth himſelfe in his ſtrength, as did Goliah, but wiſedome is better and a ſtronger defence. Samſon was ſtrong, yet was hee ouercome by the ſubtilty of a woman. Abimelech was ſtrong, yet a woman vnawares ſlew him with a peece of a Mill-ſtone, Iudges 9. 53. and ſo deliuered the City. Cyrus was ſtrong, yet by the ſubtilty of a woman (as Stories report) was he and euery man of his great army ſlayne; and ſo was Holofernes alſo, and his murdering hoſte ſhorne vp. Ahab truſted more to his ſtrength then to the counſell of Micah, therefore he periſhed. Zedekiah and his Princes truſted to their ſtrength, and deſpiſed the counſell of Ieremie, therefore was he and his Princes ſlayne, Ieruſalem ſacked and ſet on fire. Nabuchadnezar refuſed the counſell of Daniel, and boaſted in the defence of Babylon, and

ſtrength of his ſouldiers; and ſo did Beltſhazzar alſo, and Xerxes, of whom I ſpake before, but their ſtrength helped them not, as Deuid ſaith.
               
                  Though the poore mans wiſedome be deſpiſed. Though the common ſort which is brutiſh, eſteeming ſtrength, beauty, wealth, apparell, &amp;c. the moſt deſirable things, becauſe they ſerue for the feeding and pampering of the fleſh, doe lightly regard, yea deſpiſe wiſedome, eſpecially in him that doth want theſe outward things, yet is he better then they, as appeareth by his example afore mentioned.
               
                  And his words be not heard. A baſe conditioned perſon is honoured for his riches and apparell ſake; and the ſpeech of a foole in the place of honour, is applauded. Externa perſonae dignit as conciliat dignitatem orationi. Haman was honoured, but not of Mordecai; and the mad common people dazled with the royall apparell of the foxe Herod, cryed, The voice of God, and not of man; but yet Chriſt gaue no ſuch teſtimony of him, but as he was a beaſt, ſo he eſteemed him. So dealt the Prophets alſo with the wicked; and S. Iohn termeth Antichriſt a Beaſt and a Dragon, to whom the wicked hypocrites attribute title of Lord God the Pope. S. Paul likened the High prieſt to a whited wall; and Dauid the wicked Princes to dogs and bulls▪ but all theſe had the ſpirit of propheſie and diſcerning.
               
                  But the wiſedome of a poore man is not heard. The rich doth wrong, and is not reproued, and vttereth folly and is praiſed: the poore man doth right and is not fauoured, he vttereth wiſedome, and they ſay, What fellow is this? When as Chriſt taught in the Temple, Ioh. 7. 14. 15. they ſay, How knoweth he the Scripture, ſeeing he neuer learned? Here is a miracle, a plaine euidence of diuine power and extra ordinary wiſedome, yet they lightly paſſe by it, for they iudged according to his outward appearance, verſ. 
                  
                     •
                  4. They knew whence he was, ſpeaking contemptibly, verſ. 27. So when he taught in a Synagogue, Mark. 6. 
                     •
                  . 3. whileſt their mindes were fixed on his ſpeeches▪ (for the no
                     •
                  elty of his doctrine wrought attention) they ſay, Whence hath he thoſe things? What wiſedome is this that is giuen him? But when his

pouerty, and meanneſſe of his education, trade, parents, kinsfolks come into their mindes, they are offended, they yeeld no honour, affoord no entertainment, they beleeue nothing, but turne about to their olde biaſſe. So Pauls Goſpell is deſpiſed of the flanting Preachers of Corinth, becauſe his bodily preſence was weake, and his Sermons without Philoſophy and 
                     ••
                  hetoricke. He was poore, humble, ſpirituall. So do our flanting badges now adayes, that ſuite themſelues to mens humours, admiring perſons for aduantage, and make themſelues as ſtrange to their brethren, as Ruffians do to the graue, wiſe and ancient. They ſhew what ſpirit they are of, and which way they came in.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 17. 
                  The words of wiſe men are heard in quiet, more then the crie of him that ruleth among fooles.
               
               ANother compariſon of the Leſſe, to illuſtrate the excellence of wiſedome, or dignitie of the wiſe mans ſpeeches, though his words cōmonly be not heard. For this verſe hath reference to the laſt words before. The loud noiſe &amp; thundering words of a proud and wrathful gouernour, among ſuch like as himſelfe, ignorant, fooliſh and paſſionate, are heard. For terrible and ſounding words moſt affect the rude and paſſionate. But the words of a wiſe man in quiet, namely of a poore or meane man that hath no commanding power, but is ſubmiſſe, humble, and ſpeaketh vnder correction, not proudly and peremptorily, are to be heard before him. For pride, ſtomachfulneſſe▪ headineſſe, wilfulneſſe and preſumptuous foole-hardineſſe auaile little; but things are rightly and eaſily effected by wiſedome: great weights are eaſily moued and remoued by the deuice of engines, which to plaine ſtrength are impoſſible. The great words, great ſtrength and power of Xerxes was nothing good to but to dig down mountains, to make nearer paſſages of riuers, and to drinke riuers dry, as it is recorded of his hoaſt▪ For Leonidas with few words, and no noiſe, and few men ſurpriſed him, as being a Whale on the ſands, and the ioyntleſſe beaſt Alce leaning to a tree almoſt

ſawne through; for theſe are taken by wiſedome, not by ſtrength. The ſubmiſſe words of a poore man ſpeaking with g ood vnderſtanding, are rather to be heard of gouernors and honorable men, then are the boiſterous words of the proud and fooliſh among fooles. For the matters of the world are ordered by the wiſedome of God, which he reuealeth to whom he will, without reſpect of perſons: for he reſpecteth his glory onely. Therefore 
                     •
                  he regardeth the lowlineſſe of the poore, and ſendeth the rich empty away. He deſpiſeth not the poore for his pouertie, nor accepteth the perſon of the rich to giue him wiſedome, &amp;c. becauſe of his riches, though the rich foole arrogateth all to himſelfe, tāquā proprio iure. All this is euident by the parable aforeſaid.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 18. 
                  Wiſedome is better then weapons of warre: but one ſinner deſtroyeth much good.
               
               A Third compariſon to illuſtrate the excellencie of wiſedome. Weapons and engines auaile much in warres, for no warre is made-without them: but let them be as good and as ſtrong as they can be, yet wiſedome is ſtronger. For where wiſedome is wanting, weapons are as ready to turne their points vpon their maiſters, as againſt the enemies, as the Madianites did, and as the Iewes in the laſt ſiege and vtter ouerthrow of Ieruſalem and their whole nation did. This is a thing confeſſed of euery good warrier, that weapons are nothing without wiſedome and counſell, and that wiſedome giueth the dead blow, as Tully ſaith, Parua ſunt ſoris arma, niſi eſt conſilium domi; and not Achilles▪
                   but Vlyſſes is termed Poliporthos, the ſacker of cities. One wiſe Commander is better then many fighting men. The Lion that is Leader or Captaine of Harts, is better then an Hart that is Captaine and Leader of Lions. Therefore the ſilence of wiſedome is better then the noiſe of ſtrength. If the ſhip be not gouerned by the skilfull Pilot, the rowers ſhall by their ſtrength but runne her on the rockes and into the ſands▪ 
                  
                     •
                  herefore 
                     •
                  e that ſitteth at the ſterne, and diſcerneth the coaſts, bringeth the ſhip to the hauen rather then

the mariners. And this was the glory of the Romanes, that they conquered the world by wiſedom, not by ſtrength. The Romanes were ciuill and prudent, other nations barbarous and ſtrong. If beaſts knew their ſtrength, they would beare rule ouer man, and bring him into ſubiection vnder them, to labour for them as they do for him, and would prey vpon him. If Abſolon had obeyed the counſell of Achitophel, 2. Sam. 17. 1. 2. 3. he had preuailed againſt Dauid; but being yong and heady, ſtrong and furious, ſuch like violent courſes beſt pleaſed him. For when Huſhai told him of an hoaſt like the ſands of the ſea ſhore for multitude, and that it ſhould fall on Dauid and his men like dew, not leauing a man aliue, and that they would draw downe cities with ropes into the riuer, not leauing one ſtone behinde them, he preferred this violent fury before the murdering counſell of Achitophel. For the Lord had appointed to defeate the good counſell of Achitophel, that he might turne Abſolons fooliſh ſtrength againſt himſelfe. If Rehoboam had followed the ſage counſell of the Ancients, and not taken the violent courſes of the yong men, he had not loſt ten parts of his kingdome.
               
                  And one ſinner deſtroyeth much good. The Hebrew is Vechotea, that is, one declining, diuerting, aberring from the right way or ſtraight courſe into by-wayes. The words may be taken as a confirmation of the former ſentence concerning the excellency &amp; neceſſity of wiſedome in warres. He that faileth but once in policy or counſell through neglect, ſhall weaken his hoaſt, and giue aduantage to the aduerſary, &amp; haply loſe all his former victories, as Hannibal and Attilius Regulus, and many more ſtout warriers haue done Or rather they are an explication or illuſtration of wiſedome, by a diſtinction of wiſedome and wiſe men. For there is wiſedome ioyned with the feare of God, commonly called good wiſedome; and there is worldly craſtineſſe, which Saint Iames termeth, earthly ſenſuall, and diuelliſh, Iam▪
                   3. 15. and the ſonne of Sirach termeth it, execrable malice. Such was the counſell of Achitophel and Herod. This wiſedome is ſerpentine and diabolicall, like that of the High

prieſt, princes, and Phariſes againſt Chriſt, and his ſpirituall kingdome. It is ſuggeſted of luſt, and ingeſted of Sathan.
               One ſinner deſtroyeth much good, as one wiſeman, fearing God, doth much good, as the Parable afore ſhewed, and the example of good Obadiah and Iob teſtifie; and of Huſhai alſo. So againe, one fraudulent, crafty guilefull perſon bringeth a curſe vpon a whole common-wealth, as Ieroboam did, whoſe execrable deuice, to ſtabliſh his kingdome; ſee 1. King. 12. 26. to the end▪ So Herod to ſtabliſh himſelfe in his kingdome, ſlew all the children in Bethlem, and the coaſts about, that were two yeares olde and vnder. Such were the plots of Abſolon againſt Dauid, of the high Prieſt, and princes of the Iewes againſt Chriſt. The one will get a kingdome by wicked wiſedome, and the other preſerue their kingdome by wicked wiſedome. But good is neither gotten nor preſerued by euill. For God wil be God, and glorified only, and man ſhall be a beaſt. The miſchiuous imaginations of the wicked ſhall not proſper. Such is the wiſedome of Antichriſt, and to conclude, of the Diuell and all his children. All euill proceedeth of them, and in the end falleth vpon them, as the dew that riſeth out of the ground, and falleth downe vpon the ground. Therefore, how profitable and wiſe ſoeuer the counſel of a wicked man ſeemeth to be, yet giue no eare vnto him, though our ſelues (being euill) are euer inclinable to the worſe part. For his counſells and doings (in the end) will marre all. He will but ſhew foorth witty folly, and bring deſolation, ſhame, and perpetuall ignominy. All ſhall be in the end but the crackling of thornes vnder a pot. For they do hatch Cockatrice egges, and weaue the Spiders web, Eſay 59. 5. They are crafty fooles, hindering what good they can, and doing euil, hurting many, and killing themſelues. There is nothing in them but ſelfe-loue, pride, hatred, and mocking of them that are good. The good wiſedome of God in his children which is humble and louing, they deſpiſe, and deride, exalting and preferring their owne ſerpentine ſuttlety. For they are of the Diuell, ſeeking their owne wils, luſts, and glory, not Gods, nor any mans good.
            
         
         
            
            CHAPTER X.
            
               
                  Verſe 1. 
                  Dead ſlies cauſe the oyntment of the Apothecarie to ſend foorth a ſtinking ſauour: ſo doth alittle follie him, that is in reputation for wiſedome and honour.
               
               
                  THis Chapter hath two parts. Firſt, an exhortation to perſeuerance in wiſdome, verſes 1. 2. 3. Secondly, a remedy againſt vanities in ciuill gouernement by the direction of wiſedome; from verſe 4. to the end. The Exhortation is inforced by an argument drawne ab incommodo, from the hurt, and inconuenience that ſhall follow vpon inconſtancie, negligence, or leuitie.
               A little folly ſtaineth or diſgraceth him that is in reputation for wiſedome. It is illuſtrated by a ſimilitude of dead flies infecting the Apothecaries ointment. As an oyntment made by th'art of the Apothecary is eſteemd moſt precious, &amp; deſired of euery one, yet is it corrupted with a few dead flies, and contrarily caſteth foorth a ſtinking ſauour that offendeth the ſence: euen ſo a man that hath beene highly eſteemed for his wiſedome, doth by a little errour, yet indiſcreetly committed, loſe his former grace and reputation. A blacke ſpot in a white ſheete is ſeene of euery one, that can hardly diſcerne other colours; and ſecret enuy that is put to ſilence by the common fame and grace, yea and carried backe with the ſway of the multitude, as the Shippe is with the Tide, breaketh foorth as waters when a ſmall gap or breach is opened. And this is alſo vanity. God is only good, only wiſe, and will be knowne to be ſo. If Salomon had not beene tempted to folly by his heatheniſh wiues, nor Ioſiah giuen the battell to Pharao, without asking counſell of the Lord, yet after-times ſhal bewray the ignorance and vanitie of man, ſeeing that that which ſeemeth to be both

wiſely and well done for the preſent to mans reaſon, hath a diuers and contrary euent for want of wiſe prouidence. Therefore is God onely wiſe, onely good. Man muſt not therefore be diſcouraged, but more carefully imitate him, and learne as children do of their parents, and as wiſedome hath taught vs, Mat. 5. 48. Be you perfect sv your heauenly father is perfect,
               
            
            
               
                  Verſe 2. 
                  A wiſe mans heart is at his right hand: but a fooles heart at his left.
               
               THis verſe ſetteth downe the meanes whereby to preuent and auoide the blemiſh of folly, and to maintaine ſtill the honourable reputation of wiſedome. The meanes is double, or hath two members. Firſt, the wiſe man is led and guided by vnderſtanding, according to the fundamentall truth, or the right ground▪ of things. Secondly, if he erre, he ſoone perceiueth it, and quickly recalleth and recouereth himſelfe. This is illuſtrated by the contrary, and both contraries by a ſimilitude of the right hand and the left. A wiſe mans heart is at his right hand. The right hand is more ſtrong, agile and operatiue then the left, therefore the artificer handleth his toole, and worketh with it, and ſo proceedeth well, and bringeth his worke to perfection: but if he giue but one ſtroke with the left hand▪ he marreth his work; for the left hand is but an helper or ſeruant attending on and gouerned by the right. Therefore the eye and minde of the worker, is euer at his right hand: ſo likewiſe ſound reaſon or good vnderſtanding is a mans right hand, and his affections are his left. The wiſe man is alwayes inclinable to good reaſon: his eye, mind, heart is altogether fixed on the ground of the truth, and thereafter he worketh and proceedeth; and his affections are but attendants and ſeruants to his wiſedome, which he hath at command: but if hee yeeld or giue place but once to them, P
                        •
                     ſſima ſuggerunt, they are brutall, he marreth all the ſplendour or grace of his worke, euen that one ſtroke ſhall be a great blemiſh and eye-ſore. Let not him alſo that can fundamentally and methodically carry his worke with him, intermingle a fooliſh

opinion or perſwaſion of another, leſt it be as brimſtone caſt into the lake or veſſell of the Alchymiſt among gold, whereby his worke is marred. Moreouer, a man is the right hand, woman is the left. For ſhe was created for an helper, an vpholder of the family, not an actor: (yet is ſome man left handed,) the prudent man oft times giuing place to a woman, is as gold mingled with brimſtone, or as one that holdeth his worke in the right hand, and worketh with the left. Adam, Solomon, Samſon, may be examples hereof; and if Iob had regarded his wiues counſell, all his innocencie had bene vtterly corrupted▪ and his vprightneſſe peruerted, but the heart of a wiſe man is at his right hand. The other member of the meanes is vnderſtood by anantapodoſis or ellipſis, and is gathered by the oppoſite, verſ. 3. This is illuſtrated by the contrary practiſe of the foole. The heart of a foole is at his left hand. The foole is carried with his affections, he is alwayes in clinable to folly, a wicked and a vaine thing ſoundeth beſt in his eares, wiſedome cannot enter into his head, wholeſome inſtruction he abhorreth. For he hath an euill heart, vnpurged, vnhallowed, and therefore is he euer inclined to the worſe part. His grounds are broken and confuſed, diſturbed, and ruled by his luſts, ſo are his proceedings diſorderly, and bring forth vanitie.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 3. 
                  Yea alſo when he that is a foole walketh by the way▪ his wiſedome faileth him, and he ſaith to euery one that he is a foole.
               
               THe ſecond member of contrary folly, ſeruing to illuſtrate the practiſe of wiſedome, or ſecond member of the meanes, whereby the reputation of a wiſe man is preſerued from blemiſh. Yea alſo when he that is a foole, &amp;c. When a wicked man is entred into the way that his filthy luſts haue drawne him into, then his heart faileth him, he conſidereth not whence he is ſwarued, nor whither he tendeth; but being proud and wilfull, he will neither reclaime himſelfe, nor be reclaimed by another, but ſaith to euery one

that he is a foole, he declareth his folly, and maintaineth his folly. He hath no delight in vnderſtanding, but that his heart may diſcouer it ſelfe, Prou. 18▪ 2. ſeeking out reaſons and excuſes for his folly, and giuing fooliſh anſwers to euery thing that is obiected againſt his folly, and alſo ſtrengthening himſelfe with the opinions and teſtimonies of ſuch like as himſelfe is. Whereas contrarily, the wiſe man preſently acknowledgeth, concealeth, and ſpeedily ſalueth his error, antequam in publicum exeat, before it breake forth, he killeth it in the hatching. But the foole neuer ceaſeth till he fall into vtter obloquy and contempt, and in the end becometh deſperate and ſhameleſſe, and as almoſt nothing offended at the reputation of a foole or wicked perſon, but oft times rather glorieth in it. Or, by way may be meant euery way wherin the foole walketh, &amp; place where he is, he babbleth and declares his folly to euery one where he commeth, ſo that all men may ſee his ignorance, wrathfulneſſe, and wilfulneſſe.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 4. 
                  If the ſpirit of the ruler riſe vp againſt thee, leaue not thy place: for yeelding pacifieth great offences.
               
               HEre beginneth the ſecond part of the Chapter, ſetting downe a remedy or rule to arme a man againſt vanities and miſeries incident to man in ciuill gouernment. The confuſions and diſorders thereof muſt be rightly conſidered by wiſedome to the pacifying of the mind, no
                     •
                   be oppoſed by contrary vanitie, ſeeing that there is a wiſedome of God in theſe vanities not vaine and vnreſiſtable. The ſcope hereof is to teach modeſt and ſubmiſſe behauiour in wiſedome towards Princes: for they are either the faithfull ſhepheards of God, or elſe the rods of his correction. If the ſpirit of the ruler, &amp;c. If the Ruler hath taken a diſpleaſure againſt thee, if his anger be kindled againſt thee, that hath authority and power ouer thee, leaue not thy place, oppoſe not diſpleaſure to diſpleaſure, though he be wrongfully diſpleaſed, go not out of his ſight in anger, nor moue thy ſelfe from place to place, nor vſe any geſture or countenance

as they doe that are angry. Neyther rebell, nor ſhew rebellious diſpoſition, but contrarily (vnderſtood by anantapodoſis or ellipſis, moſt frequent in the Scriptures) vſe what meanes thou canſt to ſaue thy ſelfe, by ſaluing the wound, or vexed ſpirit of the Ruler. For yeelding pacifieth great offences. Heb. marpeaci, that is, ſanctitie, lenitie, or healing ſhall make great ſinnes or offences to ceaſe.
               The precept is confirmed by three reaſons. The firſt is contained in theſe words drawne from the effect of ſubmiſſion. The ſecond from verſe 5. to verſe 12. The third, from verſe 12. to verſe 16. Concerning the firſt, yeelding is an acknowledging, ſubmiſſion and deprecation if a man be in an errour, or haue iuſtly offended; alſo patience and forbearance if a man be blameleſſe and innocent. For a Ruler er
                     •
                  ing is not to be conuicted of errour and reproued oppoſitiuely, which doth impayre his place and perſon, but vnder ſubiection and correction to be rightlier informed in the matter or buſineſſe. And this ſhall, in the end, giue great content, and bring thee into greater fauour then was the diſpleaſure. Whereas contrarily on the one ſide thou ſhouldeſt prouoke him to deuiſe euill againſt thee, whileſt that he contendeth for his honour, or to quiet his minde by reuenge; and on the other ſide, inwrappe thy ſelfe in endleſſe troubles by ſiniſter courſes. For hee is too high and heany for thee to contend againſt.
            
            
               
                  Verſ. 5. 
                  There is an euill which I haue ſeene vnder the Sunne as an errour, which proceedeth from the Ruler.
               
               A Second reaſon of the precept is, becauſe that by patient ſubmiſſion the princes ire ſhall not only be healed and retracted from reuenge, as was ſaid before, but alſo the ſubiect ſhall preuent and auoyde many euills, that through his ſiniſter courſes hee ſhould procure vnto himſelfe, to verſe 11. and afterwards be ineuitable, verſe 11. This reaſon, as I thinke is propounded by way of a complaint. Firſt, geuerally in theſe three next verſes, the anſwer wherof is illuſtrated by compariſons in the next foure

verſes after. There is an euill which I haue ſeene, &amp;c. There is a principall and ſpeciall euill to be ſeene in this diſordered world, as an errour which proceedeth from the Ruler: an illuſtration of this euill by a compariſon of the like. As the errour of the Prince is a publique euill redounding to the hurt of many, yea of the whole Common-wealth, as himſelfe is a publique perſon: ſo is this alſo an euill very grieuous, whereby great calamitie often enſueth to men both in reſpect of their perſons and eſtates. If any man vnderſtand this of the errour of Princes, Preferring vnworthy and vnfit perſons to the place of dignitie, and magiſtracie, which cauſeth much euill in the kingdome; I eaſily yeeld to it.

                  Follie is ſet in great dignitie, and the rich in lowe place.
               
               A Particular explication of the euill or diſorder before generally propounded, and illuſtrated in theſe two verſes; Follie is ſet in dignitie or height, and the rich in lowe place. Follie, a Metonymie of the Adiunct, for foole▪ By foole, is not meant him that is deſtitute of reaſon or vnderſtanding, but him eſpecially that hauing both, vſeth neither or abuſeth both. As the fruit of crackt or craſie reaſon is follie, ſo of corrupt or wicked reaſon alſo. There is more hope of a foole then of him that is wilfull in his wayes, corrupt or wicked wit is woorſe then a weake vnderſtanding. By Rich, is not meant wealthy, but rich in wiſedome, vnderſtanding, diſcretion and gifts to diſcharge the high calling of a Prince or Ruler, as it is ſaid, that God gaue to Saul another heart, 1. Sam. 10. 9. and which was figured by the holy Oyle, wherewith the Kings of Iſraell were annoynted at their coronation. This is the complaint of Salomon, that vnreaſonable, and reaſonleſſe men ſhould ſit on the Throne, and the Bench. That ſuch ſhould reigne and ſit in the place of Iudgement is the ſecret iudgement of God, either becauſe people deſpiſe the goodneſſe of God in his word, and ſo hee ſetteth euill princes or

children to rule ouer them, or elſe for their tryall, that their faith may be tried vnder a wicked Ruler. But it followeth not, as this complaint intimateth, that eyther wicked or childiſh Princes ſhould bee ſeditiouſly thruſt out of their place and office, as Childericke King of Fraunce is ſayd to haue beene by Pope Zacharie: For that is nothing elſe but to offer violence to God, to pull the ſcourge out of his hand, which with patience we muſt beare. But wee muſt rather looke to the cauſe thereof, our ſinnes and hypocriſies; wee muſt pray for pasience and repentance, and pardon, and ſo remoue euill with good, and not contend againſt God to increaſe our miſeries.

                  I haue ſeene ſeruants vpon horſes, and Princes walking as ſeruvnts vpon the earth.
               
               BY ſeruants is meant vnworthy perſons, of baſe ſpirit, and roguiſh conditions, ſuch as are enthralled to their Iuſts, ſuch as hate wiſedome, and inſtruction, deſpiſers and mockers of godlineſſe, and them that are good, which if they were but ſeperated from their riches and authoritie, and their cloth taken from them, would be moſt contemptible doe naughts of all other, Belialls, good for nothing at all. Vpon horſes. Aduanced to honours, ſitting on the ſeate of iudgement, and place of iuſtice, abounding in wealth, faring deliciouſly, apparelled gorgeouſly, dwelling in ſumptuous houſes, ſtored with coſtly furniture, enioying the pleaſures of the world, as Iob complayneth chapter 21. Dauid in Pſal 73. and Amos chap. 6. riding abroad on pleaſure, riding on ſtrong and ſhining horſes, riding in Coaches, hunting, and ſporting, intertayning and being intertayned ſumptuouſly.
               
                  And Princes walking as ſeruants on the earth. That is to ſay, men of learning, diſcretion, wiſedome, godlineſſe, grauitie, wanting ſemblable meate, drinke, apparell, building, houſhold▪ſtuffe, lodging, friendſhip, and for want of an horſe trauelling on foote, like to labouring men, and ſeruants, and working for want of neceſſary food and raiment, as the meaneſt men doe. If this were not in the

Church as well as in the Common-wealth, it were more tollerable. But better it is to walke on foote to heauen, then to ride on horſe-backe to hell with the foole.

               THE anſwer to this complaint is contayned in theſe next foure verſes, expreſſing the euill that a diſcontented, immodeſt, or rebellious ſubiect bringeth vpon himſelfe, not barely propounded, but illuſtrated by foure elegant ſimilitudes, whereof two are ſet downe in this verſe: He that diggeth a pit, ſhall fall into it. A prouerbiall ſentence taken from thoſe that make graues, or deepe pittes, which often vnawares fall into the ſame themſelues. In thoſe Countries they vſe to make pits lightly couered ouer with ſtraw, leaues, ſtickes and duſt to catch wilde beaſts in, and to catch me alſo in. It is applied to plotters and deuiſers of miſchiefe, which going about to harme other men, are caſt downe into the pit of their owne counſells, Pſal. 7. 15. 16. He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch, that he made, his miſchiefe ſhall returne vpon his owne head, and his violent dealing ſhall come downe vpon his owne pate. So Haman was hanged vpon the ſame gallowes, that he had prepared for Mordecai, Heſt 7. and Perillus was firſt broyled in the braſen Bull that hee made for the tyrant Phalaris to torment others in. Ioh ſayth, The Lord taketh the wiſe in their craftineſſe. This craftineſſe is the wiſedome of the world ſo much extolled. If a man be ſubtile and politike for his owne aduantage, though others be hindered and harmed thereby, and God diſhonoured, yet hee is prayſed, at leaſtwiſe he is highly conceited of himſelfe for his wiſedome. It is commonly ſayd, The beſt gameſters haue the worſt lucke, ſo theſe craftie foxes play often wilie beguile themſelues For the Lord will not let their wicked imaginations proſper, leſt they be too proude He that intendeth euill againſt the Ruler, is ſecret and deepe, but he firſt falleth into his owne pit. The ſauage Papiſts haue afforded

foorded vs many examples hereof in this Land▪ for God hath giuen them vp into a fooliſh and reprobate minde, to make ſnares, traps and pits for themſelues; it is all their practiſe, they do nothing but worke their owne woe. They ruſh againſt the rocke, and are ſplit in peeces.
               
                  And who ſo breaketh an hedge, a ſerpent ſhall bite him. He that goeth about to diſſolue the gouernment, or alter it at his pleaſure, which is compared to an hedge, ſhall be ſtung of the ſerpent, euill ſhall light on him vnawares, that imagineth euill againſt the Lords annointed. Therefore would not Dauid touch Saul▪
                   that wrongfully ſought his life. Thus was Achitophel taken in his owne wilineſſe; and Abſolon, 2. Sam. 18. 14. was ſtung with the darts of Ioab. And Pharao perſecuting the Iſraelites, or rather the Lord in his people, was ouer whelmed with the waters; and ſo it fared with Guido Fauks and his fellow-conſpirators.

               WHoſoeuer diggeth downe another mans wall to enter into his houſe, or remoueth land-markes, ſhall be puniſhed, either with misfortune in the euill doing, or by law. Or, the meaning is, he that diggeth ſtones out of the quarry or rocke, and lifteth them vp, or carrieth and recarrieth them, is in danger to be hurt; and he that cleaueth wood, is in danger to be hurt many wayes. He that goeth about to remoue a Ruler out of his place, and to deuide a ſettled gouernment that is at vnitie in it ſelfe, vndertaketh a dangerous peece of buſineſſe. As he vndertaketh a deſperate worke, ſuch ſhall his reward be. It is euill medling with edge tooles, and heauy ſtones, and trees are not for children to deale withall.

                  If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then muſt he put to more ſtrength: but wiſedome 
                        〈◊〉
                      profitable to direct.
               
               IF the edge of his axe or wedges be blunt, and vnfit for

ſuch workes, and he hath not whetted or prepared and fitted them according to the greatneſſe and knottineſſe of the tree, then muſt he adde to more ſtrength, and weary himſelfe, but effect nothing, vnleſſe the breaking of his tooles, and maiming of himſelfe: ſo he alſo that diggeth a pit without knowledge and skill, that raſhly breaketh vp an hedge, and remoueth ſtones without conſideration and art, and good aduice, ſhall effect nothing by ſtrength, but hurt himſelfe, for ſuch weights are not to be dealt withall by plaine ſtrength. But wiſedome is excellent to direct. Wiſedome prepareth a good toole to worke withall, wiſedome conſidereth the weight of the worke, and contriueth accordingly. For plaine ſtrength auaileth little in woodworkes, ſtoneworkes, ironworkes, which are done by art and fit engines and inſtruments. Well, as theſe things are not done with inconſiderate ſtrength, but by art and diligence; ſo neither can any man by wilfulnes, frowardnes, or fooliſh ſtrength preuaile againſt the Prince, nor appeaſe his anger or heauy diſpleaſure by any ſuch like oppoſite courſes. For this is an heauy matter or ſubiect to worke vpon, not to be enterpriſed without perfect skill, ſharpe tooles, and mature deliberation to contriue it. A ſhip is a weighty veſſell, and cannot be vſed at our pleaſure as a little boate or a diſh. A King counterpoiſeth the kingdome, and the ſtates of kingdomes are not often changed: he therefore that vndertaketh that worke is a foole, ſwimming in a pit ful of ſnakes to catch an eele. When God wil bring a generall iudgement or vtter deſtruction vpon a land, then ſhall he in wiſedome effect it as pleaſeth him. The Papiſts will needs make themſelues Gods actors, pretending his cauſe: they are the diuels ſollicitors and actors, and God giueth them the ouerthrow. For what ſpeciall reuelation or command haue they to ſtab and poyſon Princes? or to ſet vp a monarchy by bloudſhed? The Church was neither ſo planted nor augmented, as the Antichriſtian ſynagogue hath bene: for then ſhould Chriſt haue had need of Peters ſword; and then the Apoſtles ſhould haue killed, rather then haue bene killed, with a word, as Peter did Ananias and Saphira. Therefore the Papiſts dig

pits, and fall into them; they breake vp hedges, and are ſtung of ſerpents; they cleaue wood, and cut their owne legs, and trees
                     •
                  all on their necks, they remoue ſtones, and are bruiſed therewith, the whole quarry, the rocke grindeth them to powder. For wiſedome is excellent to direct: but they want the wiſedome which is of God, and commeth out from his throne, therefore are they taken in the wilineſſe that they haue imagined.

As it is a vaine thing for a man to handle a ſerpent, truſting either to his ſtrength, or hoping that the ſerpent will not bite; and as it is more vaine to begin his charme after that he is ſtung, for then both ſtrength, hope and charmes are all in vaine: ſo is he vpon whom the diſpleaſure of the Prince is fallen for his con

                  The words of a wiſe mans mouth are gracious: but the lips of a foole will ſwallow vp himſelfe.
               
               A Third reaſon of the precept, verſ 4. The words of him that ſpeaketh in wiſedome are acceptable, and procure him fauour and grace, as they proceed from a gracious heart. For he knoweth what is beſt pleaſing to God for him to ſpeake, and what is moſt acceptable for good men to heare, and what deſerueth to be accepted for faithfulnes and truth. For by his wiſe handling of the matter, the equitie thereof is found out, and fauoured by reaſon of his forcible and good arguments vſed in his defence. Alſo his milde and ſubmiſſe behauiour and patient ſpeech, worketh

vpon the Prince to pacifie his diſpleaſure, and mitigate his fierceneſſe; yea and he ſtirreth vp friends by his wiſe diſcourſe to ſtand in his defence, and to intercede for him, whereupon his cauſe beginneth not to be his owne, but other mens alſo, and ſo is the Ruler ſoone perſwaded. By Prince and Ruler is meant euery ſuperiour. But the lips of a foole will ſwallow him vp. An illuſtration of the reaſon by an antitheſis or oppoſition of the contrary. As the mouth or gracious and acceptable ſpeeches of the wiſe deliuereth him, and reconcileth the Ruler, and procureth him fauour: ſo contrarily the mouth of the foole deuoureth him, or deſtroyeth him. For the foole neither knoweth nor regardeth thoſe things, but vomiteth out peruerſe ſpeeches, ſuch as tend to rebellion, and ſhew forth a rebellious diſpoſition, an heart implacable and reuengefull, whenſoeuer opportunitie ſhall offer it ſelfe to do euill, contrary to the practiſe of Dauid. So Ioabs ruſtiei ſpeeches were but harſh, 2. Sam. 19. 5. if his good counſell had not qualified the rigour thereof, and at this time ſtrength was in his hands. His anſwer was better, 1. Chron. 21. 3. and he did wiſely, verſ. 4. in that he contended not againſt him in that doubtfull vnlawfull commandement. For he knew not the intent of the Kings heart, yet he vttered his ſuſpition in moſt wiſe ſort, with a ſecret implicite reproofe, verſ. 3. For it was not his duty to demand reaſons of his maiſter, becauſe he was but a ſeruant: and a ſeruant is but the hand, not the heart, the foote, not the head of his maiſter. That which a man knoweth to be contrary to Gods commandement, he may refuſe to do, yet wiſely, though he ſuffer perſecution for it. For then is God perſecuted, and not he, the cauſe is Gods. For euery maiſter is but a commander vnder God, as he is commanded of God, Nemo ſui iuris eſt praeter Deum. And euen things indifferent muſt not be enormous, but haue relation to things neceſſary, whence they are to be deducted by good conſequence. For God muſt haue no corriuall in the leaſt things. And we muſt not be the ſeruants of men, ſayth the Apoſtle, but ſubordinately vnder God. Whatſoeuer we are enforced to do, hath externum principium, their ſinne is

the greater, and ours the leſſe. Let our Rulers and all commanders therefore take heed, that they abuſe not their authoritie to perſecution: for they themſelues are but ſubſtitutes and ſeruants vnder God; and God ſhall be auenged on them righteouſly, that vexe his people wrongfully. For he alone is autexouſios &amp; aneuthunetos.

                  The beginning of the words of his mouth is fooleſhneſſe: and the end of his talke is miſchieuous madneſſe.
               
               THe next three verſes are an explication of the former words generally propounded, amplified by the degrees of his folly. The beginning of the words of his mouth is fooliſhneſſe. The foole hath not an vnderſtanding heart, he apprehendeth not the ground of a matter, he diſcerneth not the truth from errour to ſet himſelfe in the right way at firſt, but he imagineth and ſpeaketh alſo according to the ſuggeſtion of his luſt. He is an idiot, that well knoweth what he would haue, as all beaſts in their kinde doe; but what is right and fitting, he regardeth not. For God is not in all his thoughts, Pſalm. 10. As his ſpeeches are at the firſt vaine and friuolous, that a man cannot well vnderſtand him what he would, for he is double and confuſed, ſo is the end of his talke miſchieuous madneſſe, he ſetleth downe on his lees. In the end he plainly bewrayeth that wickedneſſe is in his mind, and madneſſe or violent wilfulnes in his heart, to procure much euill vnto others, and more vnto himſelfe.

                  A foole alſo is full of words: a man cannot tell what ſhall be; and what ſhall be after him, who can tell?
               
               SEcondly, he multiplieth vaine words for the excuſe and defence of his folly, his fooliſh enterpriſes, and wilfull proceedings, figured by aproſopopeia or mimeſis. As the fooles heart is not fixed on God, nor hath the loue of his

truth in it, for he hateth ſuch knowledge; ſo he is full of groundleſſe imaginations according to his variable luſts: and though his words be not alwayes ill, yet he neuer ſpeaketh well. For a prouerbe or wiſe ſentence is odious in a fooles mouth, he ſo polluteth it by miſapplying it.
               
                  A man cannot tell what ſhall be, and what ſhall be after him who can tell? Theſe are the ſentences of the wiſe, Chap. 6. 1
                     •
                  . Who can tell a man ſhall be after him vnder the Sunne? Chap. 8. 7. A man knoweth not that which ſhall be. The intent hereof, is to ſhew the vanities and miſeries of this life, but the foole applieth them to defend vanity and wickedneſſe, and to ſhew the poſſibility of his wilfull and witleſſe enterpriſes. So there are good words in the diuels mouth, Mat. 4. 6. but they are wickedly applied and vſed. The words are an argument of comfort to the children of God, drawne from their ſafe protection by the Angels of God: but Sathan diſtorteth the true intent thereof, to perſwade Chriſt to refuſe the ordinary meanes of Gods appointment to tempt God. If the Angels haue charge ouer thee, caſt thy ſelfe downe headlong. When we doe without warrant or command, we put our ſelues out of the Angels charge, for they are faithfull attendants on God, wholly depending on his will, not on our diſobedience and rebellion. To proceed, the foole hath not wit, but will, he will not be perſwaded nor diſſwaded by ſound reaſon; but what he willeth, he hopeth, and what he hopeth, ſhall not be to him impoſſible, for he maketh all things chance and lucke. And ſo deriding wiſedome, he dependeth on fortune. Whereas fortune is nothing but our ignorance and improuidence. The more wiſedome and prouidence, the leſſe fortune; but fooles terme thoſe things the fortunes of the wiſe, which they by wiſedome foreſaw, and by counſell and right meanes brought to paſſe. So the foole is wiſe, but for ill lucks and ill haps, which he ſaith none can be againſt. Who then ſhall perſwade him that he is a foole? who ſhall diſſwade him from his folly? For a foole hath examples pro &amp; contra, for his owne luſts, but the intendment and circumſtances he regardeth not, the differences and conueniences he diſcerneth not. If his

contrary and biaſſe courſes produce not ſuch effects as he ſeeth in the world, then it is ill lucke, but whether himſelfe be a wiſe man or a foole, that he diſcerneth not, whether his luſt and deſires be oppoſite to Gods prouidence or no, he knoweth no more then a beaſt; but ſome haue hap, and ſome ſticke in the gap; and giue a man lucke, and caſt him into the Sea.
               The foole is ſo hopefull and chancefull, that he careth not much what he ſaith, how hee ſpeaketh, to whom hee ſpeaketh, when he ſpeaketh, or doth any thing. How ſpake ſuch a one? How did ſuch a one? Why might not I ſay this, or doe that? (ſo Eſopes Aſſe immitated the Dogge, fawning and leaping on his maiſter) what can come on it? It is as it is taken, as it falleth out, who can tell vntill hee trie? What knew I whether this or that would haue followed? who can tell any thing? muſt not all be as God will? The foole indeede ſtands all vpon trialls according to his luſt, but what the reuealed will and commandement of God is, he regardeth not, he is an enemy to that knowledge. But the wiſe knoweth that there is a conuenient ſeaſon, and due time for all things in the appoynted time of God, that euery ſeaſon, and euery conditure or condition of time produceth his owne words, and deedes, ſilence, or ſurceaſing. But the foole obſerueth nothing, hee will ſay, as others ſay, I haue ſayd, and doe as others haue doone. That which in it owne time is wiſely ſpoken or done, is at an other time flat follie, and iniquitie. So the foole in his beſt moode neyther imagineth well, nor ſpeaketh well, nor doth any thing well. For, the good that is paſt he cannot apply well to the preſent. For Nabal is his name, and follie is with him.

               THirdly, the foole will neuer be wiſe, nor giue ouer his follie. He is ſo proudly conceited of himſelfe, and ſo wilfull, but wearieth himſelfe in his crooked and diſordered

wayes, and is wearied with the euils that his follies haue intangled him in. He is full of troubles, for as he wanteth wiſedome and the feare of God, ſo hee medleth in many matters that are aboue his reach, whereof he knoweth neither beginning nor ending. Why is the foole wearied in his manifold, crooked and preſumptuous buſineſſes? Becauſe he knoweth not to goe to the Citie. The plaine tract, and euen path of wiſedome, the Kings high way, the royall commandement▪

VVhat is meant by the wearineſſe of fooles, they themſelues doe interpret, Wiſed. 4. 5, 6, 7▪ 8. Wee haue wearied our ſelues in the way of wickedneſſe, and deſtruction, and we haue gone through dangerous wayes, (by▪wayes) but we haue not knowne the way of the Lord (that leades to the Citie.) What hath pride profited vs, and pompe of riches brought vs? Theſe fooles loued wearineſſe, and wearineſſe was their portion.

The Iewes expected ſuch a kinde of Meſsias or Redeemer that ſhould free them from the bondage of the Romans, and vexations of their enemies, amongſt whom they had beene diſperſed many yeares, and therefore they followed Chriſt in ſuch troupes and multitudes, and many offered themſelues to be his diſciples in ſuch worldly reſpects, ayming at the aduauncement of their perſons and eſtates in the world; and the diſciples being yet weake and rude, hoped as much, but Iudas eſpecially: therefore, when both he and the people ſaw that their expectation ſhould be fruſtrate, as himſelfe by many parables and plaine ſpeeches reclaimed them from ſuch vanitie, hee betrayed him, and they crucified him. For they were afraid leſt they ſhould not onely haue no profite by him, which they looked for, but alſo by his meanes procure the diſpleaſure of the Romans, and ſo loſe that ſmall freedome which they had. VVherein we may learne what the ſpirits of the vnſanctified common people are in ſuch complaints, and of thoſe chiefly that talke ſo much of the goodneſſe of the olde world. They falſly imagine that the Pope much eaſed them of the burthen of Princes, and Nobles, whereas they were both body and ſoule the Popes, and the Diuels vaſſalls, excepting the Elect. And that is a thing which the naturall man, who is filius gehennae, deſireth. To conclude▪ it is rebellion, not religion. They would faine enioy a carnall peace, contentation, and felicitie they care not how. The ſonnes of Adam would faine bee in an earthly Paradiſe againe, which thing Salomon reclaymeth them from in this booke, to cauſe them to looke for the true, ſpirituall, and euerlaſting peace and happineſſe, and to enter into the heauenly Paradiſe. Let vs therefore murmure at our ſinnes, and be diſcontented with our diſcontentedneſſe, and behold our wickedneſſe in our afflictions and troubles, which

are but the meaſurable puniſhments of our vnmeaſurable ſinnes, and ſet vp our reſt, peace, and comfort in him onely▪ and there onely, in whom, and where it is to befound, and had.
               
                  Wobe to thee▪ O Land, when thy King is a childe. This complaint in the verſes before, ſhewd forth indignatio, which being pacified with Salomons anſwer breakes foorth agayne after another maner, to wit, in an exclamation▪ commiſeration, or deſperation▪ which is further emphatically coloured with the figure apoſtrophe, to preſſe it more forcibly. The parts, in reſpect of the ſubiect or matter, are two. Firſt the childiſhnes, or inſufficiecy of the King to rule. Secēdly, the voluptuouſnes, or riotouſnes of the Nobles. Wo be to thee. This word alwayes importeth ſome great euill, as heere it ſignifieth the fooliſh prince to be the greateſt euill, and a ſure token of Gods anger it is indeed. Therefore the Lord threatned to ſet children to rule ouer the rebellious Iewes▪ vnder whom there ſhould be neither peace, nor iuſtice, but oppreſſion and wrong, euery man vexing and deuouring another. When thy King is a childe. By Childe, he meaneth not ſo much one that is young in yeares, as in vnderſtanding, and diſcretion. S

                     nex aetate, &amp; iuvenis moribus, old in yeares, but a childe in diſcretion, and contrarily, is a diſtinction well knowne. When Ioaſh was yong, he followed the counſell of Iehoiada the high prieſt, and the Land proſperd, and the Church floriſhed, but in his elder dayes, hee became a childe, being miſ-led by the wicked princes, 2▪

But contrarily, Rehoboam was forty yeares olde, when he ſhewed childiſhnes in refuſing the wiſe counſell of the Ancient▪ 1. Kin. 12. To conclude, that king is termed a child, when he is ignorant of the Law, &amp; without diſcretion, contrary to the commandement▪ 
                  Deu. 17. 18 19. 20. Secondly, when he is mindleſſe, &amp; forgetful of the cauſe of the poore, and of the righteous, which are alwaies oppreſſed▪ &amp; falſely accuſed by the rich, and the wicked. Thirdly, when

he that ſhould gouerne, is rather gouerned and led by others, giuing place to craftie and flattering perſwaſions, as Ioaſh did, after that Iehoiada was dead. Fourthly, when he committeth the gouernment and care of the kingdome to others, which at their pleaſure prey vpon the ſubiects, enriching themſelues by oppreſſion and robbery both of Church and commonwealth, whiles he followeth his pleaſures and vanities. Fiftly, when he is prouoked to wrath for trifles, but paſſeth by the great matters of the law, as the Phariſes did. Sixtly, when being addicted to licentiouſnes he cruſheth the Church, the godly and ancient, through the falſe ſuggeſtions of prophane Princes, as Ioaſh did, but openeth the mouthes, and ſtrengtheneth the armes of wicked flatterers, yea ſuppreſſeth the one, and countenanceth the other, as children loue to be pleaſed, and are kinde to deceitfull flatterers, but they hang downe their heads, and runne away from their true hearted friends and beſt counſellers. Briefly, when he ſeeketh not Gods glory in obedience to his word, but his owne glory, as Saul did. Therfore Samuel told him that he was become a foole.
               The ſecond part of the woe, is the riotouſneſſe of the Nobles and officers, which giue themſelues to pompe and prodigalitie, not regarding the welfare of the people, but their owne bellies, which is meant by eating in the morning. They meditate not, ſtudy not, conſult not in the morning, when wit and memory is freſh, for the welfare of the Church and commonaltie, but for couetouſneſſe, oppreſſion, pride and pleaſures, as it is ſaid of the idle ſhepheards▪ 
                  Eſay 56. 12. Yea rude Princes oppoſe themſelues to the feare of God and practiſe of religion, and contrarily giue countenance to rude libertines, left their rudeneſſe ſhould appeare to the commons, and ſo breed contempt, and ſhake off the yoke of obedience; whereas if they themſelues were godly and gracious, they ſhould be loued of the godly and be a terror to the wicked▪ as Iob was. They ſhould binde Kings with chaines, and Nobles with fetters of iron, much more the commons, ſuch honour haue all his Saints, Pſal. 149. 8. 9. And why ſhould not Kings be Saints? It is

no diſparagement to their royaltie, though wicked Amaziah bade Amos propheſie no more at Bethel, becauſe it was the Kings Chappell, and the Kings Court, Amos 7. 13. yet not many wiſe, not many noble, not many learned after the fleſh hath God called, 1. Cor. 1. And it is hard for the rich to enter into the kingdome of heauen, yet are all things poſſible with God that ſanctifieth. When Princes are not godly and gracious themſelues, their owne conſciences breed iealouſies and euill ſuſpitions in them, euen when there is no cauſe at all. For the wicked man flyeth, when none purſueth, when none oppoſeth, as Saul purſued Dauid, and grew at length into ſuch extremities as to ſlay the Lords prieſts, and to account them his enemies and worſt ſubiects that feared God moſt, and moſt lamented his caſe, whereas his cauilling clawbacks brought him to a miſerable end.

                  Bleſſed art thou, O Land, when thy King is the ſon of Nobles, and thy Princes eate in due ſeaſon, for ſtrength, and not for drunkenneſſe.
               
               AN illuſtration or aggrauation of the former griefe, by the antitheſis, or oppoſition of the contrary bleſſednes of the land that is gouerned by the royall hearted King, and truly noble Princes. Bleſſed art thou, &amp;c. By noble is not meant him onely that is of royall bloud or deſcent, for ſo was Iehoiakim, who is likened to an aſſe, Ier. 22. 19. or carrion, and Ieconiah, whoſe name was curtalled and cropt off in contempt, as the lappes of Dauids ſeruants were by the King of Ammon. verſ. 24. Neither by ſonne of Nobles is meant him that thinketh himſelfe glorious for his ambition, pompe, pride, crueltie, as Rehoboam did, and Sennacherib, Nabuchadnezzar, Antiochus, Herod, &amp;c. but he that was noble hearted, as was Dauid, who was borne of meane parentage, and Ioſiah, who was not giuen to pompe, pride, ambition, ſuperfluitie, but was content with a mediocritie, and delighted in purging the Church of Idolatry, in ſetting forth the glory of God, as Dauid did▪ He that is wiſe

and godly, is the truly aged, though he be a childe, and truly royall and noble, though he be poōre, as Salomon ſaid before, Chap. 4. 13. He that feareth God, and hath command ouer his owne luſts, and not captiuated to his owne will, is truly royall.
               
                  And thy Princes eate in due ſeaſon, &amp;c. That is, when thy Magiſtrates, Counſellers and officers are moderate and modeſt, not giuen to feaſting, banketting, prodigalitie, pride, glorifying one another in the fleſh, not to proud apparell, proud buildings, not to ſports and pleaſures, drunkenneſſe and venery, Prou. 31. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. For who is then graced, preferred, rewarded, but the vaſſals of their luſts? The Church and Churchmen go to wracke, wanting neceſſary meate, drinke, apparell, lodging, &amp;c. but rather to ſobrietie and parſimony, not to oppreſſion and robbery, but to liberalitie and bountifulneſſe; not to careleſſe waſting of the wealth of the land, but to preſerue and increaſe the ſame; not to rob and ſpoyle, but to enrich the Church and commonaltie: laſtly ſo to ſerue the body, that the body of the Church and commonwealth may be ſerued by it, and the Lord by both.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 18. 
                  By much ſlouthfulneſſe the building decayeth; and through idleneſſe of the hands the houſe droppeth through.
               
               AN expoſition or explication of the woe or miſerie, eſpecially of the former part thereof, verſ. 16. illuſtrated and inforced by a compariſon drawne from the euill, and diſorderly oeconomie or gouernement of a priuate houſe or family, which ſheweth forth it ſelfe in the euill vſage of the outward building. Theſe euils are ſlouthfulneſſe, and careleſneſſe, or idleneſſe. The former is a vice of the minde, the latter of the body. A careleſſe minde, an idle hand. Where thoſe vices reigne, the houſe not onely decayeth, but rotteth, and droppeth vpon the head of the improuident, ſlouthfull, vnthriſtie houſholder. A man in reſpect of his perſon is knowne by his apparell, countenance and gate what manner of one he is, as touching his

ethicks or morality, ſaith the ſonne of Sirach. Againe, he is knowne by his houſe, yard, grounds, cattell, ſeruants, and children, what manner of man he is, as touching his economie or husbandry, Prou. 24. 30. 31. The houſe of the ſlouthfull man is ruinous, and droppeth through, his yard is like a vaſte deſert, the fences and walls broken downe, as a vineyard layd waſte, his fields are ouergrowne with thiſtles and briers, his family is diſordered and idle, one contending and quarelling with another, girning one at another, all maiſters and vnruly. Thus it is in the houſe of prodigals, drinking ſlipthrifts, and Belials, do naughts. Thirdly, in reſpect of his politicks or magiſtracie he is knowne by his ſubiects. For as the houſholder is in his houſe or family, ſo is the magiſtrate in the citie, and the king in his dominions. An houſe is a part of a ſtreete, a ſtreete is a part of a citie, the citie is a part of the kindome. The king is the head, the kingdome is his body, conſiſting of members, whereof ſome are ſuperiour, as thoſe that are placed in gouernment vnder him, and are ſubordinate one to another, others are inferiour,
               Whereas the Prince feareth not God, but is either couetous or waſtfull, careleſſe and diſſolute, then the Church and common wealth go to wracke. The gouernours are rauening Harpies, and riotous, deuouring the commons, and feeding themſelues of the flocke, yea euery one after their examples preying one on another. The vngodly, flatterers, luſt-ſeruers are aduanced, and placed in offices for money or fauour, for there is no care nor feare of God in the ſuperiours, but euery one that feareth God is diſhearted, and he that ſpeaketh vprightly is hated in the gate, and he that rebuketh is abhorred, Amos 5. And amongſt thoſe wicked ones, there is nothing but enuie and contentions, euery one being giuen to oppreſſion, pride and ambition, and all enemies to God and godlineſſe. Whereupon it commeth in the end to be a vaſt deſert of wilde beaſts, and as a vineyard lying waſte, ſpoyled with foxes and wilde boares, like a field ouerrunne and cropt vp with cattell, and paſtures rooted vp with ſwine, and ouergrowne with thiſtles

and briers. Such deſolations doth the Lord threat vpon carnalitie and contempt of his word. All theſe things declare what the Prince is, and by what manner of ſpirit the commonwealth is inliued and moued. For as the ſpirit of a thing is, ſuch is the thing. If the ſpirit be weake, the body is ouergrowne, and ouercome with diſeaſes, as we ſee in plants, in beaſts, in men. Now the ſpirit of houſhold gouernment is pater familias, the good man of the houſe. The ſpirit of polity, or commonwealths gouernment, is the king. A prudent and valiant Prince hath a ſtrong conſtitution, and ſound body, his ſpirit worketh effectually in the finger, and all vtmoſt parts, as well as at the heart and inward parts, that there may be ſoundneſſe and ioy in all the body.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 19. 
                  A feaſt is made for laughter, and wine maketh merrie, but money anſwereth all things.
               
               AN explication of the complaint or woe, eſpecially of the latter part thereof, verſ. 16. which was this, Thy Princes eate in the morning, that is, ſpend their whole time, euen the morning it ſelfe, wherein nature it ſelfe bindeth vs to ſobrietie and ſolitary ſtudy, in eating, drinking, pleaſures, like to the Sodomites, and beaſtiall Princes of Iſrael. It is illuſtrated by the contrary, and right vſe of eating, drinking, and other expence. A feaſt is made for laughter. The vſe of meate, is the reparation▪ and conſeruation of the body in health and ſtrength, that a man may be enambled to diſcharge the duties of his calling, wherein God hath placed him. He muſt keepe his body in temperance, ſobriety and chaſtity, that the minde may be more cleare and free, of greater ſtrength and vigour in the functions thereof, both for deliberation and execution. As for a feaſt, that is made for laughter, for a recreation of the minde and body at certaine conuenient times, and to preſerue common ſocietie and neighbourhood, or rather to teſtifie friendſhip and loue one towards another, though particular buſineſſes and neceſſities haue diſtracted them, and drawne euery man ad
                  
                  ſua curanda, to care for his owne things▪ of the vſe whereof feaſting and co mmon meetings teſtifie a certaine communitie, ſuch as in this diſordered world, and miſerable condition of man can be had. But to be addicted to feaſting, to make a trade of pampering the body, as epicuriſhneſſe, and beaſtlineſſe. For beaſts regard nothing but the belly; they are all body, and to feede well, is their perfection.
               
                  And wine maketh merrie. Wine alſo hath the ſame vſe that is of meates. He that giueth himſelfe to drinking and companiſhip, is a drunkard, although he neuer be drunke. Therefore the Prophet Eſay denounceth a woe againſt them, that are able to drinke ſtrong drinke; Woe be to them, for they ſpend not onely the time of life idlely, and waſtefully, but alſo make others drunke, and glorie in euill. But wine is not for Kings, nor ſtrong drinke for Princes, Prou. 31. 4. but for the ſicke to recouer health, as Saint Paul ſaid vnto Timothie, Drinke a little wine for thy ſtomackes ſake and often infirmities; and wine is for the ſorrowfull to reuiue the ſpirits, and diſperſe the blood of the oppreſſed heart to forget his pouertie and miſerie.
               
                  And money anſwereth to all things. This vetſe may be interpreted thus. Their feaſt is made for laughter and prodigalitie, not for recreation, &amp;c. and their wine maketh them merry to caſt off all care, that they may more freely liue in pleaſure, Eſay 56. 12. and their money or abundance anſwereth to all theſe things, that is, to none other vſe, but to maintaine epicuriſh liuing, as is all ready ſayd. Or elſe they may haue dependence vpon the former verſe; The Building of them decayeth, and their houſes droppe through, who prepare feaſts for laughter, and wine for rioting, and Luxuriouſnes, and their money ſerueth to all theſe things, to none other vſe, but to prouide for feaſtings, drinking, and epicuriſh meetings. This interpretation may well ſtand. But to proceede in the former. Money anſwereth to all things. Hauing ſhewed the right vſe of eating, and drinking, hee now ſheweth the right vſe of money. Money ſerueth not for prouiding, and mayntaining of feaſts, delicious fare,

pompe, and pride, but for all things. For money is not as other mettalls, limited to certaine workes, veſſells, or inſtruments, but it hath in it, by humane conſtitution, the nature of all things, and is all things. So that hee which hath money wanteth nothing that the world can affoord. Therefore it is ſo loued and deſired of worldlings, yea euen of all men. If it were of a particular nature and vſe, it then ſhould be leſſe deſired, and of ſome not at all. It is made for change, and ready ſupply of euery mans neede, that euery one might be helped by other. Money therefore is all things, and for all things; not for feaſts and drinkings, but to be layd out to other vſes both diuine and humane; not to be hoorded vp from vſe, which is theft, becauſe no man is for himſelfe, but for others alſo, and others for him, which is the eſſence of Charitie. Hee that giueth money, giueth, meate, drinke, cloathing, and lodging. Hee that hoordeth it vp burieth all theſe neceſſary things in the ground, from God and the poore to his power: ſeeing that without money they can not be had; yet both money and all things vnder the Sunne, and the Sunne it ſelfe, ſerue for nothing but backe and belly. Mans body is the centre of all materiall things. And if the body be the temple of the holy Ghoſt, there is neyther money, nor any thing elſe, for the body, but all for God. If all men were for God, there ſhould be no ſuch hungring for money. It ſhould be the vileſt mettall of all other. For yron is better then ſiluer. If man were perfect in innocencie and holineſſe, he ſhould neede no money at all; it would be more trouble to him to carry money, then it is now to want money. The ſelfe-loue, hatred, and miſery of man appeareth in this, that hee which hath no money wanteth euery thing; and he which hath abuudance of mony wanteth nothing. Where abundance of money is, there is abundance of couetouſneſſe, oppreſſion, and all miſchiefe; euery rich thiefe ſtriuing who ſhall buy, nay wring and weary the poore out of all. Contrarily, when there is little money, there is greateſt contentation and loue amongeſt neighbours; but when money commeth in, it ſetteth all

on fire▪ and parteth friends. The diuell commeth in with it, for it in flameth the deſire; and the diuell bloweth the bellowes, and they that are in loue with it, are beaſts, Idolaters, the children of the Diuell. For it is his baite and his hooke, whereby hee catcheth them, and as it were hangeth them vp by the chappes.

                  Curſe not the King, no not in thy thought: and curſe not the rich in thy bed-chamber: for a bird of the ayre ſhall carry the voice, and that which hath wings ſhal tell the matter.
               
               THis laſt verſe is an anſwer to the complaint; It is propounded by way of an Admonition or Dehortation, which hath two parts anſwerable to the complaint, verſe 16. The firſt is; Curſe not the King, or, ſpeake not euill of the King: figured by an Epanorthóſis, or correction, no not in thy thought: or it is a Prolepſis anſwering to the common obiection, Thought is free. If thou haſt no euill thought, or euill diſpoſition of the heart, thou canſt not ſpeake euill (otherwiſe thou canſt not ſpeake well;) let this then be one of the things that thou canſt not doe, and thou ſhalt be ſafe, thy tongue ſhall not ſlippe. It belongeth to God onely to reprooue Kings by his word. For hee is the ſeruant of God, Gods vicegerent, and muſt not be lifted vp aboue his brethren, hee is ſubiect to the word of God, as well as any other, and hath ſpeciall commaundement to haue the Booke of the Law by him continually to be exerciſed therein, and he ſhall be puniſhed for his tranſgreſſions as well as any other. This denunciation is made by man from God, but the execution is in Gods owne hand. If a ſubiect tranſgreſſe, then he is puniſhed, becauſe the king is euſtos vtriuſque tabulae. Hee hath the Couenant in keeping; he muſt be true and faithfull to his maiſter in puniſhing, protecting, rewarding his fellow ſeruants, accōrding to his Lords appoyntment, not after his owne luſt, and pleaſure. Nemo ſui iuris eſt praeter Deum. And things indifferent, wherein they haue moſt power, muſt not bee

diſcordant from things neceſſary, but attendants and ornaments, not diſparagements thereto. No man is his owne, hee neyther ſtandeth nor falleth, liueth nor dieth to himſelfe, but all to God. All men are to be reprooued and puniſhed by the king, but the King by God alone: God denounceth iudgement by men, but executeth by himſelfe. If the Kingsmaners diſpleaſe thee, looke to thy ſelfe, and conſider the beame that is in thine owne eyes. For thou in thy ſtate and dealings, and to thy power ar
                     •
                   bad enough, and if honour and power were put vpon thy backe, what manner of man wouldeſt thou be? Magiſtratus indicat virum. What wouldeſt thou doe? Great matters ſurely. It may be ſomewhat for a while. If the burden of the whole kingdome were layde on thy backe, thou wouldeſt beare it luſtily. Euen as a child ſet vpon the back of a proude, ſtomackfull, vnruly horſe, would ride luſtily. Art thou in an office? Looke to thy ſelfe how thou execucuteſt that. Art thou rich? what good doeſt thou? How behaueſt thou thy ſelfe towards thy poore neighbours, and tenants and ſeruants? Thou art now a Scholler, what if thou wert a Schoolemaiſter? Doſt thou know what thou art? what thou wouldeſt be thou well knoweſt not. Something lyeth curbed and pind vp in a ſecret corner, as flies in winter, that the warme Sunne-ſhine of Authoritie and Honour would produce. If the handmaid were miſtreſſe, how gentle, kinde, and good would ſhee be to her fellow ſeruants and poore neighbours? Salomon ſaith, Prouerbs 30. 21. 22. 23. For three things the earth is diſquieted, and for foure which it can not beare▪ for a ſeruant when he reigneth, and a foole, when he is filled with meate, an odious or froward woman when ſhe is married, and an handmaid, when ſhe is beire to her mistreſſe, that is, her maiſters wife.
               
                  And curſe not the rich in thy bed-chamber. The ſecond part of the Admonition, anſwerable to the ſecond part of the complaint. By rich are meant Nobles, and higher powers. Speake not euill of the King and his peeres, otherwiſe then their dignity requireth. For they repreſent the perſon of the King, as he doth of God, and their authority

is his authority and power. Therefore ſpeake no euill of them, neither in publicke nor in priuate, not in the hearing of thy beſt friend, nor in thine owne hearing alone, as the manner of ſome is to talke to themſelues, vſe not that. For as they that talke in a dreame know it not; ſo if thou beeſt talkatiue in thy bed-chamber of ſuch things, it will out in another place ere thou be aware. And out of the aboundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh.
               
                  For a bird of the aire ſhall carry the voice. A reaſon inforcing the admonition. It ſhall not be kept ſecret, but reuealed; or thou ſhalt be puniſhed as if it were reuealed. Briefly, thou ſhalt ſurely be puniſhed. This certaintie of puniſhment is confirmed by the poſſibility of an impoſſibility in nature, to take away all manner of obiections. How ſhall my thought, and priuate or ſolitary ſpeech be known, none hearing of it? If it cannot otherwiſe be knowne, then the bird that flyeth ouer thy head, or is wandring aboue in the aire, ſhall perceiue thy thought, and heare thy voice, and relate the ſame to the King; ſo ſhalt thou be puniſhed. And if the King of Kings ſhall puniſh thee, who knoweth the ſecrets of thine heart, it is all one as if thy words were brought to the kings eare.
               
                  And that which hath wings ſhall tell the matter. An amplification of the reaſon by a commemoration to inculcate the ſame more deeply into the heart. The bird ſhall ſpeedily carry it, the Poſte ſhall not ride on horſebacke, but be caried on wings. Thou ſhalt not onely certainly, but ſpeedily be puniſhed. Wilfull murder and treaſon will out. For euery man is the image of God, and the King is next to him, his ſurrogate.

                        ōpalsionating of others. The former, in one terme may be called ſobriety, this charitie.after many dayes.
               
               
                  THis Chapter ſetteth down a ſoueraigne remedy againſt the vanities, Chap 9. that ſeeme to carnall reaſon to be in the diuine adminiſtration of the world, to arme the ſoule againſt deſpaire, diſtruſt in Gods prouidence, carnall ſecuritie, d ſſolute and careleſſe liuing, Epicuriſme, to take away the offence of the weake, who hearing that all things are caried hand ouer head in the gouernment of the world, may begin to be weary of well doing, and to giue themſelues ouer to carnalitie. Whereas contrarily, letting alone things that are aboue our reach, we muſt lay hold on the commandement that is before vs, in our eyes and eares, and be more carefull and diligent, working out our reward with feare and trembling, with all confidence in Gods prouidence and promiſes, howſoeuer things be caried and ruled aboue and againſt mans reaſon. It is enough for the ſeruant to do his maiſters will. And alſo to learne to vnderſtand and know the ſecret wayes of God out of his word in all theſe things, which the blinde world confound, and terme chance and fortune. As before he hath diuers times taught, that the good of worldly things conſiſted in the bodily vſe thereof, the ſuſtenance or comfortable maintenance of the body; ſo now he farther teacheth the ſpirituall vſe thereof, or good of the ſoule, which conſiſteth in the exerciſe of ſaith and charitie therewith. For in doing good, and communicating to others that need our helpe, we make our loue to God, and faith in Gods promiſes more certaine to our ſelues. In theſe times many ſearch into the ſecret counſell of God for their aſſurance, and are much perplexed

about predeſtination, but in the meane time are full of pride and couetouſneſſe, and worldly pompe, which in baptiſme they haue promiſed to forſake. Their ſpirit is full of guile. If they could by deep ſearch know their election, they would aſſuredly beleeue in him, and confidently rely on him, and cheere their fleſh in theſe tranſitory dayes. If they can attaine to this aſſurance, but ſome doubt ſtill perplexeth them, they will yet be ſure of one thing, to liue in pride, pompe, pleaſure here on earth. So that whether they be ſure, they will liue in pride and pleaſure, or not ſure, they will liue in pride and pleaſure. Whatſoeuer elſe they can attaine to be ſure of, this in the meane time they will be ſure of. But whiles they follow the pride, pompe, couetouſnes, eaſe and pleaſures of the world, as many doe, they ſhall be alwayes in perplexitie as many are. Shew me thy faith by thy workes of loue or charitie, ſayth Saint Iames to ſuch like Chriſtians in his dayes, and I will ſhew thee my faith by my workes; ſo ſhall we not deceiue our ſelues, nor be deceiued one of another. Men imagine many things, and talke of many things, but the worke done, ſheweth the reſolution of the ſpirit. The whole courſe or frame of life is the ſpirit. The condition of life ſheweth infallibly the conditure of the ſpirit. Simulations and diſſimulations are but friuolous couerings. Summer will ſhew it ſelfe to be Summer, whatſoeuer the weather be; ſo will Winter ſhew it ſelfe, let the weather be as faire as it will be. An hypocrite will ſhew himſelfe, do what he can to the contrary; and he that truly feareth God, cannot be hid with infirmities or ſlanders. The thick clouds cannot turne day into night, nor the brighteſt Moone, night into day. He that is dead to the world, and to the luſts thereof, and beleeueth in God, is mercifull and liberall: but faithleſſe worldlings will needs breake into Paradiſe againe without Chriſt, which Solomon in this book reclaimeth them from. The diuell and the fleſh are their deceiuers and helpers, and ſo their whole life is nothing but a Gigantomachie, the Giants battell againſt God, his word, his Miniſters, his people. They liue like pompous and proud beaſts, and die like filthy beaſts, their glory is to

their ſhame, that minde earthly things. To conclude, this Chapter hath two parts: firſt a Cataſcue, inſtruction or confirmation, to verſ. 7. Secondly, an Anaſcuè, deſtruction or refutation, from thence to the end.
               Concerning the firſt, it is an inſtruction or remedy propounded by way of exhortation. This remedy is liberality or bountifulneſſe, grounded on faith and confidence in God alone, and contrary to humane reaſon. If wee doe good to others, God cannot do ill to vs: and if we beleeue in him, his promiſes cannot faile. But why doth Solomon here aboue all other vertues bring this for a ſpeciall antidote againſt the former vanities and miſeries of this life? Go aske Saint Paul why he ſo extolleth charity aboue all gifts, 1. Cor. 13. Againe, what vertue more becommeth a Chriſtian then charity, which is to ſhew mercy as he hath receiued mercy, and to do good as he hath receiued good. He that receiueth good, and doth none, maketh God his ſeruant, and himſelfe a god, a god of this world, or diuell. Againe, God requireth the practiſe of this vertue of vs more ſtrictly, and inforceth the ſame, and imprinteth the ſame in the memory by his owne example, Ioh. 13. 4. to verſ. 17. here is the vertue of charity dramatically ſet forth before their eyes, and things ſeene cannot be forgotten. Alſo Ioh. 15. 12. Laſtly, we ſhall be iudged by the workes of charity at the laſt day, Math 25. Come yee bleſſed of my Father, &amp;c. but this is not meant of morall, or ethnicall workes, Phariſaicall, Popiſh workes. For ſinners are bountifull to ſinners, they giue and lend, and that freely ſometimes to ſuch like as themſelues in fleſhly reſpects. But Chriſt ſaith, Whatſoeuer ye did to the leaſt of my brethen, yee did to me.
               
               
                  Caſt thy bread vpon the waters. Euery word of this ſentence is emphaticall. Caſt, that is to ſay, giue with a good heart willingly, and readily, and freely, not being bound at all to the loue of earthly things, as Dauid ſaith, If riches increaſe, ſet not your heart vpon them, Pſal. 62. 10. and God loueth an open heart, or cheerfull giuer, that giueth confidently without feare, and freely without compulſion.

This goodneſſe of the heart in this reſpect conſiſteth of theſe particulars:
               I. Thankefulneſſe, when vpon conſideration of Gods mercy and bounty towards vs in Chriſt, we deuote in way of thankfulneſſe our goods, not onely to our owne vſe, but to the poore, and to the Church. 2. Cor. 8. 5. The Macedonians firſt gaue themſelues to the Lord, and after to the Apoſtles, and to the poore at their requeſt. And the citizens of Tyrus being conuerted, deuote their merchandize and gaines to the Lord, Eſay 23. 18. Her merchandize ſhall not be layd vp and kept in ſtore, but it ſhall be for them that dwel before the Lord, to eate ſufficiently &amp;c.
               II. Loue, 1. Cor. 13. 3. If a man giue all that he hath, and hath not loue, it is nothing. Many build Hoſpitals for the poore, and ſo do Turks alſo; but the Lords poore, the brethren of Chriſt, Math. 25. they know not: nay, they had rather take from ſuch poore.
               III. Compaſſion. We muſt reioyce with them that reioyce, and weepe with them that weepe: wee muſt relieue them that want, and make their caſe our owne. The wicked churle ſayth, do as they will, ſhift as they can, &amp;c. when he diſpoſſeſſeth a poore tenant for a little more rent; for one poore man will oppreſſe and diſpoſſeſſe another, and this is like the raging ſtorme that deſtroyeth all things. It is the voice of a beaſt, not of a man; euery beaſt careth onely for himſelfe, and when one is fallen, the other tread vpon him, and goare him, and ſo do beaſtly men.
               IIII. Simplicitie; and that is when we aime at neither profit nor praiſe, but intend to obey the commandement of God. Therefore ſayth Chriſt, Math 6. 3. Let not the left hand know what the right doth. Giue in vprightneſſe and ſinceritie of heart, whether in priuate or publicke; otherwiſe he that giueth, giueth not to God, but to himſelfe; that is the meaning of theſe words.
               V. Cheerfulneſſe. Rich men muſt diſtribute and communicate, for God loueth a cheerfull giuer. 1. Tim. 6 16 Solomon ſayth, Prou. 3. 28. Say not to thy neighbour, go, and come againe to morrow, and I will giue it thee, if thou haſt it now.
                  
                  Iob ſayth, that he reſtrained not the deſire of the poore, nor made the eie of the widdow to faile, Iob 31. 16.
               VI. Bountifulneſſe. He that ſoweth plentifully, ſhall reape plentifully, 2. Cor. 7.
               
                  Bread. A Synecdoche of the Speciall. By Bread he meaneth all kinde of ſuſtenance and maintenance, meate, drinke, apparrell, lodging, money, Matth. 25. 35. &amp;c. euen whatſoeuer our brethren ſtand in neede of, wherein wee are able to helpe them, their ſoules, bodies, ſtates. For we muſt not onely helpe a man when he is fallen, with our almes, but aſſiſt him before he fall with our reliefe, and ſuccour, both by giuing and lending. The deceitful hearts of hypocrites and churles is herein damnable. They will relieue or aſſiſt no man, but ſuffer him to fall, yea occaſion, and cauſe his fall to buy vp all that he hath, for neede maketh good penny worths. Then will they; nay, then muſt they relieue him on the common almes, wherin the churle for his part will beare the leaſt charge. And if for his great penny worth hee doth any thing of free will, hee thinketh that hee hath done a great worke, deſeruing great commendation, and reward at Gods hands. Theſe are the common good workes and almes of the deceitfull world. They are moſt commonly like vnto perſecuters and robbers that doe giue (ſometimes) to the poore part of their ſtollen goods. It is (indeede) nothing but the offering of a Dogs head, and Swines bloud in facrifice, yet they thinke to merit heauen therewith.
               
                  Thy bread. Therefore thou muſt giue thine owne, not as mercileſſe churles doe, guilefully; nor yet as their fellow thieues doe, which ſteale much from one, and giue alittle to another; or benefit one, and hurt many. The thiefe that robbeth by the highway giueth to the poore, that beggeth by the highway, and hee is counted a good maiſter, but hee ſhall be hanged for his goodneſſe, if hee be apprehended. Conſider this ye couetous perſons, extortioners, vſurers, and all vnlawfull getters, that enrich your ſelues by the hinderance of other men, God indeede may in mercie accept your repentance, but your gifts and great workes

are abhominable in the ſight of God without repentance, and deniall of all your deceitfull and falſe goodneſſe. For God is no receiuer of ſtollen goods. If yee bee contented with that which ye can lawfully get in a lawfull calling, and truſt in him, giuing a little of a little, yee ſhall pleaſe him better, then otherwiſe with thouſands. Be thou content, and let them do great workes into whoſe hands God hath put much wealth. If they will not, their damnation ſhalbe the greater, and God ſhall diſpoſe of their wealth as pleaſeth him, it may be, to thee, or thine. The widdowes mite ſhall be as great a gift, in the ſight of God, the rewarder of euery worke, as the great ſummes of Princes in the eyes of men. As for the gift of the couetous perſon, vſurer, extortioner, or oppreſſour, it is but the ſacrificing of a dogges head, and ſwines bloud, as I ſayd before, it is but a bribe to make God partaker of their theft and robberies, Amos 2. 8. vnleſſe it be in the way of reſtitution vpon vnfained repentance, as Zacheus did. Many, chiefly Popiſh worldlings will doe no good whiles they liue, but at their laſt end they thinke to merit heauen with a great funerall feaſt, or gift of money, of an houſe, or of ſome land out of their ſuperfluity. They haue indeed made many good bargaines in their life, and this is one of the beſt. The earneſt penny indeede is offered, if it will be receiued, but heauen cannot be ſo bought. A wiſe man goeth forth to his worke in the morning, he taketh the day before him; but this perſon will beginne at Sunne-ſet (if at all) when the gates of the Citty are ſhut. In the time of life I heard him ſay often, that all things may be done for mony, and with the bribe hath he procured himſelfe much fauour, and auoyded deſerued puniſhment, and the beaſt thinketh now to deale ſo with God. For I ſee no token of a penitent and contrite heart, nor ſorrow for ſinne, but iuſtifying of himſelfe, no reſtitution, but onely a gift giuen out of ſuperfluity; and ſometimes nothing at all.
               
                  Vpon the waters. An illuſtration of the right manner of giuing, by a ſimilitude of Seede or Bread ſowne or caſt vpon the Seas, ſignifying not only the ſincerity and freedome

of the heart in giuing, but alſo the perſons to whom it is giuen. The wiſe worldling thinketh that whatſoeuer is giuen is loſt; and if neither profit, nor praiſe of men, nor any thing redound at all to him againe, hee counteth it quite loſt. Therefore reſpecting himſelfe onely in euery thing, (neither can hee doe otherwiſe) hee counteth that which is giuen to the poore Miniſter, who is neareſt vnto God, cleerly caſt away, becauſe the worldling is either Popiſh or Turkiſh, either an hypocrite or plaine ethnicke, neither would he haue any man that feareth God to haue any thing. His ſpirit telleth him that he is of the world, and hath his portion in this life onely, therefore he claymeth the world as his owne right to himſelfe, and ſuch as are ſeruiceable and pleaſing to his fleſh. Their ſpirit, I ſay, ſayth as their father the diuell ſayd, Luc. 4. All is mine, and I giue it to whom I will. The children of God are not for the profit or praiſe of worldlings, therefore would they haue the world rid of them. They cry with open mouth, away with them.
               The perſons to whom we muſt giue, are the poore, ſuch as need our reliefe and almes, that is, ſuch as are not able to labour for liuing, by reaſon of ſickneſſe, age, &amp;c. Theſe poore are either good, or elſe prophane, idle, Belials, donaughts. The good are thoſe that liue honeſtly, and labour truly for their liuing as health and ſtrength will permit, and are thankfull to God and to their benefactors. Theſe are a fertile ſoyle, worth the coſt and labour, and plenty of good ſeed. For that which is done to them, is done to Chriſt himſelfe. He calleth them his brethren, Math. 25. 40. and his little ones. To theſe muſt we doe good eſpecially, or elſe it is a ſure token that the loue of God is not in vs. For he that ſeeth his brother haue need, and ſhutteth vp his compaſſion from him, how dwelleth the loue of God in him? Againe, the Law ſayth, Thou ſhalt loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe. The Macedonians were willing to their power, and beyond their power to relieue their poore brethren, 2. Cor. 8. 3. yet it is not meant that a man ſhould eaſe others and burthen himſelfe, as he that lendeth his money without increaſe to him

that is richer then himſelfe, and in the meane time wanteth neceſſaries, verſ. 13. but to make an equality in ſupplying one anothers want, verſ. 14. Neither is this meant to confound callings, for euery one muſt be content with his calling, as Paul ſayth of ſeruants, &amp;c. but to relieue mens wants in their callings, yea and friendly to helpe them forward; not to enuy and ſuppreſſe on euery ſide, that we our ſelues may be aloft alone, and haue all at our owne diſpoſing. Neither yet in wants is it meant of an Arithmeticall equality, but Geometricall, as the Philoſophers ſay, that reliefe be giuen according to the need and worthineſſe of the perſon. I ſay worthineſſe; for the houſhold of faith is ſpecially to be relieued, though our All-alikes can abide no difference, except in this, that as the world loueth his owne, ſo do they moſt affect their raſcals and claw-backs. Herein they make a difference, for to theſe are they very bountifull, when they will not beſtow a good looke vpon a poore Miniſter, nor honeſt poore man, theſe muſt licke their liuing of the thorne, and chew vpon the bridle. They will haue no difference at all of grace and morality, (this difference the Papiſt cannot abide) morality and flattery, infirmities and prophaneneſſe, but all muſt be alike. But when all is alike, that is to ſay, darkneſſe and carnality, (for that their ſpirit intendeth) then will their pride make diſtinctions and degrees enough. And this is nothing but to draw all from God, that they themſelues might be gods, cenſuring and iudging, iuſtifying and condemning, helping and forſaking men accordingly as they pleaſe, and as they are pleaſed.
               The other ſort of poore are neuer-goods or doenaughts, that haue liued idlely, and brought themſelues into want, and in want are ſtill idle and thankleſſe, abuſing themſelues euen in that litle which they haue, and is giuen them. Theſe are a barren ſoyle for a man to caſt his ſeede vpon. They are water that conſumeth and rotteth the ſeede or bread that is caſt into it; and ſo in reſpect of them it is loſt. For they are rather ready to ſpeake euill, and doe uill to thoſe that doe them good, and walke about with

lies; yet in their neceſſity and miſery muſt we help them, though they be naught, becauſe we our ſelues are good, euen the children of God, and followers of God, who cauſeth the raine to fall, and the Sunne to ſhine vpon all. Chriſt healed the nine vnthankefull Leapers, as well as the tenth, and he did good to vs when wee were his enemies. He prayed for his perſecuters, for he came to ſaue, not to deſtroy. And Salomon ſayth, Doe good for the commaundement ſake. Relieue the godly in loue, the euill in pittie: we may be ſure of this, that our gift to the euil in that ſenſe ſhall doe vs good, and him good alſo, and more happly then we are aware of; this being excepted, that wee miniſter not matter to his wickedneſſe. I meane, that our liberalitie be not meanes to maintayne his idleneſſe, drunkenneſſe, whooredome, &amp;c. to our knowledge. (Yet many are too wiſe, too circumſpect heerein; they proue naught in ſeeming to be too good.) In this caſe lend to the poore, and lend not) and if he be without grace or gouernment, put thy meate into his mouth, but let him not finger thy money, neyther be ſurety for ſuch, leſt the weight of his folly be layd on thy backe. For hee hath the plague, and would haue all alike with him. The prodigall loueth not parſimony. His nature is to vndoe all that deale with him, and follow his humours; neyther regarde his ſerpentine tongue, it is no ſlaunder. As his necke is, ſo let him chew ſuch a bit. For Salomon ſayth, That a wiſe man ordereth his affaires by diſcretion. Be not aſhamed, ſaith the ſonne of Syrach, to beate an ydle ſtubborne ſeruant to the blood. And Nature teacheth vs to caſt out vnprofitable Drones. But what Drone can be worſe then thoſe that curſe, murmure, and ſpeake euill of their Benefactors, when as they ſhould pray for them? Laſtly, the Law ſayth, Reſpect not the poore for his pouerty, giue righteous iudgement. By all this we learne what to do with an euill tongued Drone, and a ſturdy loynes, and what courſe to take with the wicked labouring man, that ſpendeth all, and ſpareth naught, becauſe the Pariſh muſt keepe his children. Some ſuch like poore there are. Laſtly, we muſt do good to ſtrangers

whom wee neuer ſawe, and are neuer like to ſee agayne; which are ſignified by waters alſo.
               
                  For thou ſhalt finde it after many dayes. A reaſon to enforce this duty. Thy benefit ſhall not be fruitleſſe, though it ſeeme to be caſt into the Sea, and vtterly loſt; yet it is in the hand of the Lord, who ſhall reſtore it to thee agayne with aduantage. The Seede that is ſeattered abroade vpon the ground, ſeemeth to be loſt; yet it groweth by little and little, and commeth in the end to a plentifull harueſt; ſo ſhall that doe which is ſowne on the waters. The poore are compared to ground, 2. Cor. 7. ready dreſſed and tilled to our hands, and our reliefe is ſeede caſt vpon it; and for our paynes and coſt in ſowing it, we are promiſed to reape the whole croppe our ſelues. For he ſaith Deuteron. 15. 10. The Lord thy God ſhall bleſſe thee in all thy workes, and in all that thou putteſt thine hand vnto, Prouer. 19. 17. He that hath pittie on the poore, lendeth to the Lord, and that which he hath giuen will he pay him againe. Alſo Math. 10. 42. He that giueth but a cuppe of colde water to one of theſe little ones, in the name of a Diſciple, ſhall not loſe his reward. A cuppe of colde water giuen in this ſence, is better then thouſands and millions in a carnall reſpect. For God reſpecteth the intent of the heart onely, as for the gift it ſelfe, that is Gods owne already; the whole world is his owne, he hath no neede of our gifts, it is his already, and he can giue it to whom hee will, hee maketh heires; therefore hee reſpecteth not the greatneſſe of the gift, but the ſinceritie of the giuer; hee needeth, I ſay, nothing from vs, who can feede his poore at his pleaſure, but we haue neede of faith and obedience, that he might be glorified in our ſaluation, whoſe glorie is not diminiſhed, though we were all damned. If God bleſſe and proſper a man in his perſon, familie, cattell Lands, he ſhall ſoone be rich, although his beginning be right little. For it is not to be regarded, how much a man hath, but how it proſpereth. Corne, hempe, flaxe, trees, hearbs grow in a ſhortſpace, but no man ſeeth how; ſo is it with him whom God proſpereth. For firſt, God giues him wiſdome, and a right forecaſt. Secondly, there is a bleſſing vppon it,

which is aboue all indeuours. Some man groweth rich, no man knoweth how, nor himſelfe neyther. Agayne, ſome becommeth poore, hee knoweth not how; neyther can any man well tell him. Moreouer, beſides the continuall ſucceſſe of his labours, God ſtirreth vp others to doe good to him after many dayes vpon long triall of his faith and conſtancie; and the Lord maketh heyres at his pleaſure, lands and goods are in his diſpoſing. But the wiſedome of the fleſh is quite contrary. The way to be rich, is to ſpend nothing, to giue nothing, to oppreſſe the poore, to detaine their wages &amp;c.
               There was in a certaine place, one that went among the neighbours to craue ſome beneuolence towards the Miniſters maintenance, three of the richeſt and wiſeſt (ſo reputed) gaue theſe anſwers. One ſaid; The more I do giue, the leſſe I haue. Another olde man ſaid; I ſee the fore-end of my life, but I ſee not my latter: I may come to want that which I now giue. The third ſaid; I know what I haue heere, but I am not ſure what reward I ſhall haue when I am dead. His meaning was, that if he had beene ſure that there were a Kingdome of glory, hee would haue giuen ſomewhat to haue purchaſed it. And a fourth olde man ſaid; That he was old, and paſt preaching, let his ſonne, if he would, giue to preaching. Yea and another aged man ſaid; That he knew how to beſtow his money better. Heere is fleſhly wiſedome, which is enmity to the Law of God But the word of God teacheth quite contrary. The former is mans wiſedome, ſenſuall and diuelliſh, but this following is Gods. He that will be rich, let him beſtow freely on the poore; he that will giue, ſhall get; it is better to giue then to take; he that will ſaue his life, ſhall loſe it; and contrarily, he that will keepe and ſaue his goodes, ſhall loſe them; and hee that will caſt them away, ſhall ſaue and encreaſe them, and that eyther by proſperitie, and continuall good ſucceſſe in innumerable ſmall partciulars thereof; or elſe afterward, as the Lord prouided for the faithfull widdow of Sarepta, when ſhe looked for nothing but death; yet of that little Meale and Oyle that was left, ſhee ſerued the Lords Prophet firſt: a worthy example of faith. And Abigael,
                  
for a ſmal preſent beſtowed on Dauid in his neceſſity, became a Queene, whereas churliſh Nabal was ſtrucken dead. So do theſe couetous wretches rake mony together for other men that neuer ſweat for it.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 2. 
                  Giue a portion to ſeuen, and alſo to eight: for thou knoweſt not what euill ſhall be vpon the earth.
               
               THis verſe ſetteth downe the extent of our liberality, ſhewing to how many we muſt giue. Giue a portion to ſeuen, and alſo to eight. A Synecdoche of the ſpeciall, a finite number being put for an infinite; as Chriſt anſwered to Peter, Forgiue not thy brother till ſeuen times, but till ſeuenty ſeuen times. This maner of ſpeech is vſed, Mica 5. 5. Then ſhall we raiſe againſt him ſeuen ſhepheards, and eight principall men: that is, ſo many ſhepheards, both teachers and rulers as ſhall ſufficiently feed the Church of Chriſt, and defend it from the enemies, and breake the power thereof. Therefore we muſt giue to all that need our helpe. Luke 6. Giue to euery one that asketh. As charity maketh a difference of perſons, ſo againe it reſpecteth euery mans neceſſity to giue to him according to his need. A gift beſtowed on a mans neceſſity, is not loſt, becauſe it is put into the hands of God, that is done for the commandement ſake, and of pity. For God regardeth the heart of the giuer, not the gift, nor ſo much the perſon to whom. A ſmall gift of a good heart is great; and contrarily.
               
                  For thou knoweſt not what euill ſhall be vpon the earth. How long thou ſhalt enioy thy goods, thou knoweſt not, and what need thou or thine may come to, thou knoweſt nor. Surely, with what meaſure a man meateth, to him it ſhall be meaſured againe. Bleſſed is he (ſayth Dauid) that prouideth for the ſicke and needy, the Lord ſhall deliuer him in time of trouble. Diues prouided for his owne belly, but nothing for the poore, but aft rward he ſtood in need of Lazarus helpe, but in vaine. So ſhall it be wi
                     •
                  h euery rich glutton that loueth himſelfe and hateth the poore, When the rich mans ſoule is in hell, then ſhall his goods be diſperſed on the earth, and his children vagabonds, begging

their bread, and ſometimes hanged for their leudneſſe. As the diuels fetched away the ſoule of the couetous rich man Luk. 12. ſo commonly do
                     •
                  vſurers, whores, and other miſcreants carry away their goods. Surely, if Diues could haue riſen from the dead, he would haue done good; but the Apoſtle ſayth, While we haue time, let vs do
                     •
                  good, while we are liuing, and haue goods to beſtow. For while we are liuing, they are ours, afterwards they are none of ours: we are now the ſtewards of them, let vs now make friends of the vnrighteous Mammon, let vs worke while we haue the inſtrument in our hands, and do good while God giueth power to do it. For riches are for the time our gift or talent, to be layd out and vſed for our Lords aduantage. It is a folly not to do good in time of life, but to deferre till death, as many brute heads do, ſeruing God as they liſt, and how and when they liſt, ſeruing themſelues firſt, and if ought leaue, then ſhall God haue ſomething; contrary to the practiſe of the faithfull widow of Sarepta, as though God were a begger that ſtood need at all times, and ſo nothing could come amiſſe, nor at any time amiſſe, and that he muſt depend on vs, and be thankfull to vs. Thou foole and mad man, God biddeth thee doe good in time of ſtrength, not at thy laſt end; he reſpecteth thy faith and obedience to his commandement, not thy gift, which is his owne, not thine. Haſt thou his grace at command? Thou that wilt not now do good, ſhalt not then. For he will cut thee off ſuddenly, thou ſhalt die in thy ſinne; nay in ſtead of doing good, thou ſhalt haply end thy dayes in curſing and blaſpheming God, and in fearfull deſperation. Againe, thou wilt giue to the poore at thy laſt end, &amp;c. How many are ſuddenly taken, as one arreſted by the Sergeant? and as thou haſt bene vnfaithfull to the poore, ſo may thy executors be to thee and them. But i
                     •
                   the poore be partakers thereof, that is no good to thee, but thy faith and obedience ſhould haue bene rewarded. The commandement is giuen to men liuing, not to men dying. Thou haſt alwayes bene a theefe, and art ſo ſtill, for this is but a ſmall part of that which thou haſt vniuſtly withheld from the poore, and

wrongfully gotten. Therefore thou art but as one going to the execution for theft, and reſtoring ſome ſmall part of his ſtollen goods to the poore as he goeth, which cannot free him from the gallowes, and leauing the reſt to his babes, which ſhall be taken, yea ſtollen from them againe, or wither away, they cannot tell how. For the curſe of the poore is vpon their patrimony, though themſelues be ſafe.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 3. 
                  If the clouds be full of raine, they emptie themſelues vpon the earth: and if the tree fall toward the South, or toward the North, in the place where the tree falleth, there it ſhall be.
               
               A Confirmation drawne from the creatures, or law of nature, whereof two are ſpecified; full clouds, and fruitfull trees. Or, they are an illuſtration of the rich mans duty or ſtewardſhip, and vſe of worldly goods, by the ſimilitudes or examples of clouds and trees, vegetables and meteors, euen all the creatures. As the clouds being full, doe not withhold their raine, but powre it downe vpon the earth; ſo the rich man muſt not hoord vp his treaſures or goods from others. When the merchants of Tyre repented, they left off to hoord vp riches and gaine, according to their old manner, and dedicated them to holy vſes. Our Sauiour ſayth, Giue almes, and lay vp treaſure in heauen. Thus did Iob, and the faithfull in the Primitiue Church ſold their poſſeſſions to communicate to the needy. Moreouer, the clouds do not raine vpon certaine mens grounds, certaine fields and woods, but vpon all places and all things where they are caried with the windes. So the truly mercifull, namely he that is receiued to mercy, ſheweth mercy on all, his compaſſion is extended to all; which generall extent is a print or ſtampe of Gods mercy ſet in his heart, to wit, that he is receiued to mercy, and is againe truly mercifull, a fruite of the former. Chriſt ſayth, Be yee mercifull, as your heauenly Father is mercifull. Now he ſheweth mercy on all, as Paul ſaith, He is the Sauiour of all men, eſpecially of them that beleeue. Rich mens houſes are Gods

ſtore-houſes. His gold, ſiluer, corne, wine, oyle, &amp;c. is not layd vp in euery houſe, nor the charge and diſpenſation thereof committed to euery one, but to certaine perſons and places, where it muſt not lye as a talent hid in the ground, but be diſperſed abroad among other men. For 
                     •
                  e that hath giuen power, right and a commandement to gather his frui es, hath alſo giuen a commandement how to diſpoſe them. As the clouds, ſo all creatures haue their fulneſſe, which is not for themſelues, but for the earth; and they enuy their raine to no man. The rich mansfulneſſe is not for himſelfe, but for all, and he muſt enuy the ſame to no man, for that is hatefull to God and man. For the earth is the Lords, with the fulneſſe thereof, and the creatures with the fulneſſe thereof; euery fulneſſe is for man, and euery man hath a fulneſſe to be rained vpon all, to be diſtributed and communicated▪ to all; and that is his gift or talent. All creatures haue not one kind of fulneſſe, nor all members one office, nor all men in a corporation one trade. But euery one diſtributeth his fulneſſe, and is ſerued of the fulneſſe of others, that there may be a ſupply of all neceſſaries to euery man, and an equality. He that retaineth his fulneſſe to rot within him; is worthily hated. For he is a drone and a theefe. Therefore Saint Iames threatneth iudgment, mourning, and woe to them, Iam. 5. 1. 2. 3. The rottenneſſe of their riches, the mothes of their garments, the canker and ruſt of their gold and ſiluer ſhall be a witneſſe againſt them, and eate vp their fleſh as fire.
               
                  And if the tree falleth, &amp;c. The trees bring forth fruite for man, ſo muſt man do for man. They are fruitfull on euery ſide, and where their fruite falleth, there it lyeth for all that need it: ſo muſt euery man be fruitfull of good workes, as he hath receiued the gift and the fulneſſe thereof. And in what place ſoeuer the tree groweth it fructifieth, ſo doth a good man out of the good treaſure of his heart bring forth good vnto all, whereſoeuer he is,
            
            
               
               
                  Verſe 4. 
                  He that obſerueth the winde, ſhall not ſow: and he that regardeth the clouds, ſhall not reape.
               
               THe former exhortation is figured by a double Prolepſis in this and the next verſe: wherein the anſwers are wholly ſet downe, figured by an allegory, but the obiections are vnderſtood. The firſt is concerning the time, and perſons. Firſt, for the time. They ſay, that now they are not prouided to giue, they haue rents to pay, they haue an hard Landlord, (it is becauſe thou art hard to the poore, Mat. 7. 2.) they haue a purchaſe to pay for. They haue layd all out vpon houſe, land, cattell, they will hereafter do ſomething. When they die, they will make a bequeſt to the poore. (Qui non eſt hodie, cràs minus aptus erit.) Mony is ſcant, (but grace is more ſcant,) they feare a dearth, (that is the churles deſire) therefore they cannot yet do good.
               Secondly, concerning the perſons. They alledge that they ſhould haue bene more prouident and painfull in former times, that they are vnworthy of any thing; that they are leud and wicked (like thy ſelfe) and will ſpend it naughtily (as thou getteſt it,) that all is loſt which is put into a riuen diſh (not in a cloſe chest,) they muſt not doe for euery one (that do all for themſelues,) and ſo out of their ſelfeloue, diſtruſt and infidelity, they pretend a thouſand excuſes and delayes, they find innumerable obſtacles to hinder them that they ſhall neuer do any good thing at all.
               The anſwer hereto, is illuſtrated by a ſimilitude of the ſower and the reaper. He that obſerueth the winde, ſhall not ſow. He that ſtands vpon winde and weather, calme and ſunſhine, ſhall neuer ſow his ſeed in the ſpring. Now it is rainy, now a driſling fog and claggie, now ſnow-like, now froſty and dry, now windy and ſtormy, &amp;c. no weather pleaſeth, he will tarry for a more conuenient ſeaſon, and that comes to be out of ſeaſon, and ſometimes, when earing time is paſt. It is colde, threfore the ſlouch will not plow, Prou. 20. 4. It raineth, the land will be too heauie; it driſ
                  
                     •
                  eth, that will rot the furniture: the windes are aloft, that

will blow his ſeed on heapes; it is ouermoiſt, that will cauſe weeds; it is ouerdrie and froſt-like, the ſeed will not come vp; it is a faire day and a conuenient ſeaſon, but there is a Lion in the way. So the wicked rich cannot ſow the ſeed of good workes, for want of a conuenient time and perſon. Either the weather or land is not in tune, becauſe himſelfe is out of tune. But the ſtrong man attaineth to riches, the good husbandman ouerpowreth the weather, and the ſtars: ſo a good heart of gracious diſpoſition can do good at all times, and to all perſons, hee is armed againſt all weathers.
               
                  And he that regardeth the clouds, ſhall not reape. Hee that will tarry for a conuenient ſeaſon of his owne deuiſing, ſhall reape his owne deuice, euen nothing. He that will not ſow till he ſee and be ſure of faire weather, ſhall haply neuer mow, but let his corne, rot on the ground, or be all eaten with beaſts and birds. We muſt take the time as it is, and reape the fruites as they are. As we ſerue others, ſo are we ſerued againe. Some man will do good when he is old, ſome when he dieth, ſome after death by his laſt will; ſome feare pouertie and want hereafter; ſome haue now no leiſure; ſome alledge the vnworthineſſe and vnthankfulneſſe of the poore: but none of theſe can finde a time when, nor a perſon to whom to do good, till death ſummon them to iudgement, and then come they with their talent tied vp in a napkin. Their reward ſhall be according to their workes.

                  As thou knoweſt not what is the way of the ſpirit, nor how the bones do grow in the wombe of her that is with child: euen ſo thou knoweſt not the workes of God who maketh all.
               
               AN anſwer to the ſecond obiection, concerning a mans ſelfe, ariſing from his diffidence in Gods prouidence, and deniall of his power. It is thus: I know not what need I may ſtand hereafter, for I ſee not my latter end, I muſt prouide alſo for my wife and children; the more that I lay vp the more ſhall they finde, this I am ſure of; and the more that I giue, the leſſe I haue, that I am as ſure of

I will not depend on chaunces, fortunes, and vaine hope, I will not make my ſelfe richer by other mens goodes, and hee that waiteth for olde mens ſhooes, may happily goe bare foote in the meane time; and a bird in the hand is far better then two in the wood: (but if ſhe die, and be turned into rottenneſſe in thine hand, or bee poyſon to thee when thou eateſt her, what art thou the better?) how, or which way ſhall God doe this or that for me, or mine? what will he doe for me? when will he doe it? While the graſſe groweth, the horſe dyeth in the meane time; I will firſt relie on mine owne prouidence, and on Gods afterward. I will doe for my ſelfe, (yea by ſtealing and lying amongeſt hands;) ſuch like were the diſtruſtfull and blaſphemous ſpeeches of the Iſraelites in the wilderneſſe, which are ſet forth as enſamples for our admonition. They alſo limited Gods power and prouidence. How ſhall we do for bread and water in this barren and thirſty deſert? Can God prepare a Table in the wilderneſſe? Wee are wearie of this Manna, can hee giue vs fleſh? would to God wee were in Aegypt agayne: (or in the bottome of the redde Sea with Pharaohs armie, if God ſhould deale with you according to your deſerts, but that hee reſpecteth his promiſe to Abraham, and glory of his name amongſt the heathen.)
               
               The anſwer is illuſtrated by a ſimilitude. As thou knoweſt not what is the way of the Spirit. Leane not to thine owne wiſedome, nor limite the power of God. Hee hath commaunded, thou muſt obey without reaſons. He hath promiſed, thou muſt beleeue without interrogatories; thou muſt not binde him to times and meanes. His ſecreſie is his glorie, none is of his counſell, neither is any worthy or able, for his wiſedome is infinite▪ his goodneſſe is to all, and his mercy is ouer all his workes, and on them that feare him throughout all generations. As thou knoweſt not the way of the winde, when it ſhall come, whence it commeth, or whither, or how it goeth: and as thou knoweſt not how the bones doe grow in the wombe, ſo neyther canſt thou know the workes of God, who maketh all by the word of his power, and gouernes all by the word of his prouidence;

he onely is all in all, ſhewing mercy and iuſtice on all. Feare and obey therefore, truſt not thine owne counterfeit imaginations, make not a world nor an eſtate to thy ſelfe after thine owne will, for all that ſhall be but as the cracking of thornes vnder a pot. Thy flame ſhall ſeeme great, thy noiſe loud, but both ſhall ſodainly vaniſh into light aſhes: without Gods bleſſing thy riches ſhall neuer doe thee good, thy prouiſion ſhall come to naught, none of thine for whome thou art ſo carefull ſhall be the better for it. For a curſe is vpon it. God bleſſeth his owne gifts, not thy gatherings, his owne ordinance, not thy deuice. The Manna gathered on the weeke day by Gods appoyntment, proſpered, but that which was gathered on the Sabaoths morning by the couetous, fearefull, and diſtruſtfull, was putrified and full of wormes; and they that were not content with Gods allowance, but would haue fleſh, had their deſire; but their deſire was wicked, therefore their fleſh brought a plague with it. Neither did the Manna nor the fleſh of their owne gathering and deſiring doe them good. For there was the man, but the meate was taken away; here was the meate, but the man was taken away. So it is now. Therefore, be thou contented, hope in him, bee doing good, and thou ſhalt haue good, and thy good ſhall be good to thee, and continue with thee. Be ſure of this, that of doing good there can come none euill, neyther can wickedneſſe proſper. If thou haſt goods in thine owne hands, and canſt looke vpon them, thou art joyfull; and if they be in the hand of God, not yet giuen thee, diſtruſt not. That which is in Gods hands, is (by faith) ſurer to thee then that which is in thine owne hands, if thou doeſt but looke vpon thy ſinnefull and polluted hands aſwell as vpon thy goods in them. Thy ſinnes ſhall take theſe from thee, and thy faith ſhall bring the other to thee. Note this worke of God in the world. There is many a rich heyre that can neuer be at eaſe till all his patrimony be ſpent. Againe, there is that cannot thriue till his foule inheritance be cleane waſhed away, or his hands cleanſed of that filth, and then afterwards he proſpereth and attaineth to riches. For the man that ſets

his heart to gather for his children, withdraweth himſelfe commonly from relieuing the poore, and ſo bringeth a curſe on his houſe and lands, the executioner whereof is the heyre for whom he laboured. Hee that hath grace to beleene, to truſt in God, to doe good, whether hee hath much or little, is heyre to all things, and ſhall want nothing that is for his good: and God knoweth what is for our good better then we; he is our father, the Ancient of daies, moſt wiſe, wee are but children, &amp;c. Therefore feare not, God ſhall bring it to paſſe, caſt thy care on him, onely be doing good. The good Counſellor ſhall want no Clients; the good Phyſition no patients; the good Tradeſman no cuſtome; the man that feareth God no friends and helpers. For the hearts of all men are in Gods hands, and his workes aboue reaſon, and beyond expectation are infinite; to conclude, limite not God, but conſidder how the Lord brought Ionas to Nineue; and by what meanes he aduanced Ioſeph, and prouided for Iacob with his ſonnes in the great and long famine of Canaan.

                  In the morning ſowe thy ſeede, and in the euening with-hold not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether ſhall proſper, eyther this or that, or whether they both both ſhall be alike good.
               
               A Concluſion of the exhortation, verſes 2. 3. 4. 5. with the anſwers to the obiections, verſes 4. 5. figured by an Allegorie. Therefore, in the morning ſowe thy ſeede, and in the euening, &amp;c. Lay out thy goods bountifully, and that with a good and free heart in the morning, and let the day care for it ſelfe. Doe good all the day vntill the euening, and then alſo▪ and thus doe from day to day. Then ſhalt thou reſt in peace, and ſleepe in ſafetie, when thou haſt repoſed thy ſelfe on God. Doe good in thy young age, and mortifie the luſts of youth, and cares of middle age, and continue in well doing till olde age, and be then weary of life, but not of well doing; neither weary of life to do well. And in thy laſt end, finiſh thy good life well, and doe ſome good worke after thou haſt taken thy leaue of the world,

and turned thy backe, as the laſt word after a farewell for a memoriall and good enſample to the liuing. While a mans name is in memorie, and his works in fight, he is not dead, but liuing.
               
                  For thou knoweſt not whether ſhall proſper, either this, or that, &amp;c. A confirmation drawn from the vncertainty of the ſucceſſe of morning &amp; euening ſowing, whether ſhall bring a better harueſt, or both alike, thou canſt not tell. Therefore do good, worke at all times, from morning till night; from youth till olde age, and as at all times, ſo to all men, good and bad, knowne and vnknowne. For neither doeſt thou know which ſhall be moſt fruitfull, nor which God will moſt reward. A word in due time is like Apples of golde with pictures of ſiluer; and ſo is a good deede, which can neuer be out of due time. A gift of ſmall valew oft times doth great good to a man, and procureth great good to thy ſelfe, for God will heare the prayer of the poore for thy ſake, and reward thee, when thou haſt forgotten and knoweſt wherefore it is. Euen as God doth puniſh age for the ſinnes of youth, elſe would not Dauid haue prayed, Pſal. 25. 7. Remember not the ſinnes of my youth: ſo doth he reward the good workes of youth in olde age. For hee that giueth in youth, laith vp for age: becauſe, whatſoeuer he ſeemeth to caſt on the waters to his preſent hinderance, ſhalbe paid him agayne with aduantage. What then? wilt thou giue becauſe of aduantage? That is vſurie, which God hateth. Giue freely, of a faithfull and obedient heart, looking for nothing againe at all. But thou wilt ſay, many receiue no ſuch reward. I anſwer, God knoweth the heart of the giuer, and thou muſt remember the reſurrection of the Iuſt, as well as preſent things. God hath a better thing in ſtore for thee, let not the trifles of this nonage diſcourage thee. This is a ſure ground, well doing ſhalbe rewarded. If thou ſeeſt not ſuch a reward heere, thou art more bleſſed becauſe more aſſured of the reward hereafter. For the wicked alſo receiue temporall rewards of externall, and hertleſſe good workes. Doe good therefore continually, and to all; ſaue not thy meate, and loſe thy life as Nabal did. Shall I giue

my meate, drinke, money I know not to whom? So the foole reaſoned. But Abraham and Lot, by ſhewing kindneſſe to euery one, entertayned Angels vnawares. If they had beene as wiſe as Nabal thought himſelfe, they might haue periſhed in the fiery deluge of Sodom, as Nabal ſhould haue periſhed by the ſword. But bountifull Abigail could not periſh, no more then Lot; for the Lord deliuereth the mercifull and libetall in time of trouble, and plenteouſly rewardeth the proude doer.

               THE ſecond part of the chapter, or anaſcoue, maintaining the former precepts by a confutation or deſtruction of the corrupt and luſtfull imaginations of mans worldly heart. It is figured by a double Prolepſis; the former whereof is generall. The obiection is figured by a Proſopopeia, which is figured againe by an Allegorie in this verſe. The anſwer is giuen in the next; Truely the light is ſweete, &amp;c. By Light is meant worldly proſperitie, Eſay 58. 8. Then ſhall thy light breake foorth as the morning. By the Sunne is meant an happy outward eſtate, excelling all other, ſplendide and pompous, whereof the worldly heart is enamoured, as the onely felicitie, Iob 31. 26. If I beheld the Sunne when it ſhined, or the Moone walking in her brightneſle. That is, if mine heart was enamoured on my flouriſhing eſtate, if I bleſſed my ſelfe for my wealth, power, and honour. To proceed, wheras Solomon hath before recalled men from coueting earthly things, and ſelfe-loue to charitie, and good workes, that he might more firmely ſettle this grace in their hearts; hee now rooteth vp the weedes of fleſhly pleaſures, and worldly delights, by bringing in the careall man objecting or replying againſt him for himſelfe, or rather, vpon his good admonitions to retract him cloſely, clinging to his dirty god Mammon, as Crabbes cleaue to the rocke, and one to an other when they are pulled away.
               Ah! but for all that, a goodly inheritance is a ſweeto

thing: it is a pleaſant thing to be well ſeated in a fertile ſoile, in an wholeſome aire, neare to the riuer, not farre from the citie or market, to be free from all troubles and cares that pouertie bringeth. What an heauenly life it is when a man need do nothing, but walke about his grounds for his pleaſure, ouerſee his workmen, looke on his cattell, &amp;c. (as the couetous rich man did, Luk 12.) when hee is prouided of the beſt houſholdſtuffe and lodgings, and withall able to make his friend welcome, to entertaine a gentleman, to keepe gentlemen companie, to keepe a couple of men and a good gelding, to ride with credit, and to change the faſhion with the better ſort, and to haue mony alwayes in his purſe, to be able to pleaſure a friend or a gentleman at his requeſt in his need, to be able to maintaine his wife in the gentlewomans faſhion, and to bring vp his children in learning for greater preferment. Ah, this is a louely and deſireable eſtate aboue all things, ſay what they will. I will go labour, and ſpare all that I can, and caſt about euery way, that I may haue as ſuch a one hath, and liue as he doth, or might do if he were wiſe. Ah, what good could I doe, if I had as he hath, or had bene ſo well left? He dwelleth in a ſweete ſeate, what goodly and ſweete grounds hath he adioyning to his houſe? what ſweete fields of wheate? what goodly paſtures? what a goodly roote of wood? what pleaſant groues? ſome ſay, it will be ſolde ere long. He proſpereth not, he is indebted; who but a foole and a beaſt would make away ſuch a goodly thing? Ah, would to God I had money to buy it, I would neuer part from it; well, I will haue mony if I liue, I will make all cracke elſe. I ſhall liue in pleaſure and comfort hereafter when I am old, and my ſonne ſhall be a fine yong gentleman, of good account among gentlemens ſonnes, well accepted of the beſt ſort, and ſhall eaſily attaine to greater dignitie, as I meane to bring him vp, and place him in mariage. [What a zealous man is this! how his bowels yerne with pitie on the poore, and poore Miniſter! how he firſt of all ſeeketh the kingdome of God and his righteouſneſſe!] He meaneth to be firſt, a couetous beaſt, to rake mony together by all meanes, quo iure, quaque iniuria,
                  
from Church and poore, and to leaue his ſubſtance to his heire; but when the diuels fetch him away, and his heire roguiſhly waſteth all, and is at laſt hanged, then ſhall his folly and madneſſe appeare. In the meane time nothing plagueth him, but preciſe Preachers, they are his tomentors.

                  But if a man liue many yeares, and reioyce in them all: yet let him remember the dayes of darkneſſe, for they ſhall be many. All that commeth is vanitie.
               
               AN anſwer to the reply, proponnded by way of admonition. The argument is drawne from the contrary adiunct. Youth and proſperitie are ſubiect to age and death, which beginneth in age, and formeth him from the graue. Whereupon he inferreth the common concluſion, to take away this and all other replies, All that commeth is vanitie. But if a man liue many yeares, &amp;c. Put the caſe (Dato, non conceſſo) that a man enioyed that conceited happineſſe, confiſting in a free worldly proſperitie, that earthly men ſo dreame of, and aime at in all their courſes. Say that he liue long, which is a thing deſired of all men, chiefly the rich, and that he reioyce as freely as it is poſſible for a man to do in this confuſed and diſordered world; yet let him remember that which he cannot alway forget, nor altogether forget in his freeſt iollitie, namely that he is mortall, that his flower fadeth, his leafe withereth, his verdure vaniſheth teſtie and tedious old age haſteneth, light ſhall be turned into darkneſſe, pleaſure into paine, delights into weariſomneſſe, and the darke dayes of olde age and death exceed in number the lightſome dayes of life; I ſay, the darke dayes of old age and death, becauſe old age is the infancie or childhood of death, as the ſun ſetting to vs is the ſun riſing to the Antipodes? For theſe pleaſant ſunſhine dayes, wherewith thou art ſo rauiſhed, are but a worme gleame, and momentanie glance; but contrarily, the dayes wherein the body muſt lie in the darke graue, are many. Theſe laſt words are a meioſis or liptote, which are a kinde of hyperbole, to wit, of defect.

                  Many, is put for innumerable, endleſſe, eternall. It may alſo be a ſynecdoche of the ſpeciall. Let a man remember all this, and it will abate his luſtfull courage, it will take downe the pride of his fleſh, it will mitigate the eagerneſſe of his deſires, and the luſhiouſneſſe, lothſomneſſe of his worldly zeale, and make him more out of loue with his tender darling, his body, it will gather home his wilde diſperſed fancies, and his rouing thoughts into their hold, and hang them on their right hinge, and bring backe the prodigall vagabond home, laſtly it will recouer his wits, and reſtore him to his right mind. Therefore be ſatisfied with this, be admoniſhed hereby to contentation in things preſent, ſtriue not for an imaginary happineſſe, but exerciſe thy ſelfe in workes of charitie, rather doe good, which bringeth the true good, then ſeeke for it in goods which cannot affoord it. For all that commeth to man in this life as concerning the outward, man, is vanitie, ſeeing that old age commeth, and death followeth after, and that is eternall. To conclude, eate, drinke, reioyce in the workes of thine hands, but remember thine end, exerciſe thy ſelfe to good works, that as thou liueſt ioyfully with Gods gifts, ſo thou mayeſt die happily, and enter into euerlaſting ioy. That light is ſweete, that Sunne pleaſant. For we eate to liue, and liue to do good; we liue ioyfully to put away tediouſneſſe, that we may ſerue God more cheerfully.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 9. 
                  Reioyce O yong man in thy youth, and let thy heart cheere thee in the dayes of thy youth▪ and walke in the wayes of thine heart, and in the ſight of thine eyes: but know thou that for all theſe things God will bring thee to iudgement.
               
               THis verſe is an anſwer to the ſecond obiection, or reply, which is more particular, to wit, concerning the yong man, for whom there is ſome colour of reaſon pretended by the wicked ciuill. The reply is directed againſt the former anſwer, but it is not here expreſſed, but vnderſtood by the context of the words. I grant indeed, that when a

man is full growne, and growne full, elder and richer, hee ſhould be helpfull to the poore, and letting all youthfull tricks paſſe, haue a care of his family, and follow his huſbandrie, that the poore may be relieued, and his children well prouided for. But youth will be youth, youth muſt not be abridged of libertie, yong men muſt be borne withall, if they be not too leud. But indeed if they beginne to fall to whoredome, and vnthriftineſſe eſpecially, they muſt be bridled, elſe ſhall they loſe their good name, and ſpend that which their friends haue left them, which is worſt of all. Againe, when a man growes into age, he muſt beginne to thinke of his end (it is time I thinke) and come to Church duly to ſerue God (after that the diuell is firſt ſerued) and at his laſt end haue a chiefe care to ſet all right and ſtraight. For when things are rawly left, I ſee oft times that variance growes among his children
                     •
                  , and much heart-burne, and vaine expence, the Lawyer getteth all in the end, and they all become beggars. That is the very fruite of thy wiſedom and workes, it is Gods iuſt iudgement vpon the worldly wiſe, which ſeeke not Gods kingdome, deſire not his grace, nor teach their children the feare of the Lord, but aime all at worldly wealth and credit, euen that imaginary happineſſe which Solomon here confuteth.
               The anſwer to this obiection, is directed to the vaine imaginations of the yong man. Firſt it is propounded, and figure by an ironicall conceſſion, and after rendered in plaine words, by way of correction and threatning. Secondly, it is amplified by a milder, but graue exhortation.
               
                  Reioyce, O yong man, &amp;c. Concerning the imaginations of the yong mans heart, which Solomon here meeteth with, they are three.
               1. Some yong men imagine the time of this life to be but a market of buying and ſelling, to heape vp treaſure, and to ſet themſelues into a couetous courſe, and ſo fall into innumerable ſinnes of that kind.
               2. Some imagine it to be but a play. Theſe enter into an Epicuriſh courſe of life, and innumerable ſins of that kind. Yet of theſe contrary liues, there are ſundrie degrees and

faſhions, and the latter ſort are moſt incident to youth, the other to age.
               3. Some hold a meane, Ne quid nimis, they participate of both theſe extremes, and thoſe are the moderate, wiſe, ciuill, and orderly wicked. The other two are madneſſe, and this is folly. For in man there is no true wiſedome, nor true goodneſſe. As one holds on couetouſueſſe, the other on voluptuouſneſſe, ſo the third on pride and worldly pomp, wherein ſoeuer it ſtandeth. He is meanely couetous which he calleth parſimonie, and meanly prodigall which he termeth liberalitie; but extremely vainglorious and proud, and as reprobate to euery truly good worke as the other. This we haue from our mother Eue, a deſire to be as gods. Parſimony, and liberalitie, and all other vertues are ſplendide ſinnes (as Auſtine ſayth) attending on vainglorie.
               To all theſe Solomon ſh
                     •
                  peth this anſwer by way of mockage and deriſion, ſeeming to yeeld vnto their reaſons and excuſes, becauſe yong men, whether yong in yeares, or yong in diſcretion, are proud, wilfull, ſelfe conceited, impatient of admonition and reproofe, but in the end he leaueth a ſting in their conſciences at his farewell, to be a ſowre ſawce to their dainties, to ſtay their appetites from ſurfetting. Thou art wiſe, yong man, and valiant hearted, thou needeſt no counſeller, it is a diſcredite to be taught, conſult with thy ſelfe, and be like thy ſelfe, liue in pleaſure, and▪ follow after delights, cheere thy body in the vſe of thoſe things that thy heart luſteth after, enioy the fancies and pleaſures of thine eyes, thou art yet yong enough, thou haſt a long time to liue, now be merry and Ionill (louis filius) thou haſt nothing to care for, put vp no wrongs, auenge thy quarrell, braue it with the proudeſt, maintaine thy credite, trie thy valour, follow the faſhion, court it brauely, a word and a blow, ſtand to it ſtoutly, make them ſtoope to thee, put vp no abuſe, ſpend thy bloud before thou put vp diſgrace, neuer yeeld, for fleſh and bloud cannot endure it, ſpend frankly among thy companions, part with thy mony freely, ſit not out for a little, ſhew thy ſelfe right bred, take thy liquor with thee, &amp;c. Let baſe fellowes go, auoide preciſe companie

for ſtaining thy reputation among the generous, it is neither for thy profite nor preferment to regard Sermons, Miniſters are but maiſters, they are no gentlemen (yet is thy tongue too bad a clout to wipe their ſhooes whom thou moſt deſpiſeſt.) Well ſirra, feed on your fancies, and reioyce with your fleſhly and lecherous companions, and corrupt ye one another with your wicked blaſphemies, put away all remorſe of conſcience, and the day of euill, and make a league with death and hell; but know this for certaine, that God will bring you to iudgement, you muſt be ſummoned to appeare before his tribunall ſeate, neither your wit, nor your valour, nor your bloud ſhall be regarded there. You muſt giue vp a iuſt account of all your words and deeds, as well of your youth, as of your age, and as well of thoſe things that you haue forgotten, as thoſe▪ groſſe ſinnes that ye remember, neither do ye know how ſoone. It is but your folly to put the day of death farre from you, death commeth often like a lightning or thunderbolt, it blaſteth the greene corne, and conſumeth the new and ſtrong building. As for thoſe that you ſo ſcorne, and baſely eſteeme as but prieſts, preciſe perſons, clownes, what if you ſee them your Iudges appearing in glorie, and your ſelues as baſe miſcreants and theeues holding vp your hands at the barre among your other fellow diuels?
               Wil you needs be wealthy? remember the rich foole, Luk. 12. Will you needs liue in pleaſure on earth, with contempt of all that feare God? remember the Sodomites. Will you be glorious and pompous ſpectacles? remember Diues. Do you approue of any thing except Religion and the feare of God? Heare what your brethren and companions ſay, that are gone to yours and their home before you: heare what they ſaid when they were aliue as you are now, Wild. 2. throughout. And againe, heare what they ſay now being dead, as you ſhall be, Chap. 5. 4. 5. 6. &amp;c. And you proud, oppreſſing, pompous mockers, what aduantage is your wit, your wealth, your pride, and pompe to you, when your riches are vaniſhed? when your idols your bodies are rotten? when your children are begging, and come to fearfull ends?

and when your ſoules are in hell? Remember this thou yong man, to moderate thy fleſhly ioy, pleaſures, delights, to pacifie thy wrath, to mollifie thy rigor, to teach thee wiſedome and humilitie, and aboue all things to ſeeke the kingdome of God.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 10. 
                  Therefore remoue ſorrow from thine heart, and put away euill from thy fleſh: for childhood and youth are vanitie.
               
               A Concluſion with an exhortation, which is twofold. The firſt is deſtructiue or negatiue, teaching mortification, in this verſe. The other is aſtructiue or affirmatiue, teaching viuification, Chap. 12. by which meanes the heauie iudgements of God are auoided, and true happineſſe is attained. Therefore put ſorrow from thy heart, and put away euill from thy fleſh, to wit, inordinate affections and luſts. Put away moodineſſe, anger, impatience, carnall loue, worldly zeale, hatred, enuie, griefe, ſorrow, &amp;c. And put away all inordinate and inſatiable deſires, and luſting after worldly things, riches, honours, pleaſures, vainglorie, pompe, gluttonie, voluptuous liuing, pride, venerie, epicuriſme, euen all diſordered affections and luſts. For childhood and youth are vanitie. A reaſon to enforce the exhortation. As childhood ſoone vaniſheth away, ſo doth youth or middle age; as morning is ſoone ſpent, ſo is the mid day, and old age haſteneth, as the Sunne to his going downe. The pleaſure of youth is vaine and momentanie, it is like the fading flower in the Spring, whoſe verdure and beautie ſoone vaniſheth, the blaſt of the Eaſt winde, and the ſcorching beames of the Weſterne Sunne cauſe it to wither in a moment. As the time of youth is fleeting and tranſitorie, ſo is the ſtate thereof ſinfull and dangerous. Sinfull becauſe the plaſme or veſſell of the ſoule is now ſtrongeſt in her temptatious; dangerous, becauſe the diuell and the world are now moſt buſie to imprint folly in the hearr of the yong man. He is now in winning or loſing. The way of a yong man is like a ſerpent vpon a ſtone, a bird in the aire, a ſhip on the ſea; which way theſe will turne, no man certainly knoweth.
            
         
         
            
            CHAPTER XII.
            
               
                  Verſe 1. 
                  Remember now thy Creator in the dayes of thy youth, while the euill dayes come not, nor the yeares draw nigh, when thou ſhalt ſay, I haue no pleaſure in them.
               
               
                  As the ſecond degree of felicitie conſiſted in the works of charitie: ſo the third and laſt in the practiſe of pietie. 
                  THis Chapter hath two parts; an exhortation, and a concluſion. The exhortation is contained in the firſt ſeuen verſes. It is the aſtructiue or affirmatiue part of the concluſion. Chap. 11. 10. exhorting to Chriſtian or godly life, ſpecially duties of pietie, conſiſting in faith and obedience; as in the former Chapter he exhorted to duties of charitie.
               
                  Remember. This word is oppoſed to forgetfulneſſe, the common corruption and vanitie of youth. For youth being violently carried with headſtrong paſſions and vnbridled luſts, is moſt apt to forget God, to deſpiſe inſtruction and hate correction. Remembrance is hiſtoricall, or practicke and effectuall. The former is the bare vnderſtanding and bearing in mind of a thing paſt, as not pertaining to vs, but the wiſe man maketh vſe of euery thing. The latter is the vnderſtanding remembrance of that which pertaineth to vs to do, or a dutie to be performed. It is particular or generall. Particular, is of euery mans dutie in that calling wherein God hath placed him. Generall, is of Chriſtian duties to be performed of all. Particular callings and duties, are ſanctified by the generall, and comprehended vnder it. Therefore this remembrance is holy and generall; holy, becauſe it is a remembrance of God, and his glorie; generall, becauſe it extendeth to the whole man, inward and outward. Therefore he ſaith, Remember thy Creator that made thee in his image, and all things for thee. Remembrance therefore is to direct all faith, hope, loue, feare, obedience, euery action of life, and cogitation of the mind to God onely, euen to his praiſe

and glorie. Contrarily to forget, is to be vnthankefull and diſobedient, Deuteron. 8. 11. Beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God, not keeping his commandements, and his lawes, and his ordinances, &amp;c. 14. Then thine heart be lifted vp, and thou forget the Lord thy God, &amp;c▪ Therefore this word Remember, implieth continuall obedience in euery thing, or perpetuall thankefulneſſe.
               
                  Thy Creatour. This is not an ampl fication, but an argument of confirmation. Remember God, f
                     •
                  r hee hath made thee an
                     •
                   that in his owne image, therefore art thou bound to him in pe petuall duety and ſeruice.
               
                  Now. Hee ſpeak in of the time preſent, as the Apoſtle doth, Hebr. 3. 13. Exhort one another daily while it is called to day A d what is this but to remember God, while we haue our being, as Dauid ſayth? Let euery thing that hath breath praiſe the Lord; euen whiles it hath breath. Then muſt we needs remember him from the comming in, ti
                     •
                  l the going forth of the breath. And, ſo often as we drawe our breath, l
                     •
                  t vs remember that wee drawe life, and all things for life, from him. And as we ſend forth our breath, ſo muſt we returne all in thankefull obedience to him. We draw the allnouriſhing ayre into our bodies, and ſend it out of our bodies; euen ſo what we haue receiued from God, let vs returne it againe to God with aduantage. This is the practike or effectuall remembrance here ſpoken of.
               
                  In the dayes of thy youth. Hee ſayth not, whiles thou arte young, or in time of youth, but maketh mention of dayes, to intimate, that euery particular day of this life, is to bee conſecrated to the Lord, that is, not the bare time, as ſome giue the Sabaoth to God, but all our thoughts, words, and workes in the day, and not ſome, but all. For wee are not our owne, but the Lords, as Saint Paul ſayth to Seruants; Serue the Lord, not men. And to ſpeake as the thing is, the whole time of life is a Sabbath. The Sabbath was ordained for the reliefe and helpe of our infirmitie, and alſo to ſhew forth our conſociation and fellowſhippe with our fellowmembers, and fellow-ſeruants in the Church triumphant, as farre foorth as the neceſſities of our bodies heere below

will permit. For eternall life is heere begunne. Therefore wee owe nothing to the fleſh, not one minute of time, nor one thought of the heart. We are the Spouſe of Chriſt, as Paul ſayth, he preſented the Corinthians a pure Virgine to Chriſt. Wee muſt be chaſte, as the Angells are beautified with all chaſtitie. Concerning olde age there is no doubt made. For euery one thinketh that a man muſt then beginne to draw neare vnto God, but they imagine yong age to be a time of libertie. But heerein theſe indifferent minded men are like the ſacrilegious Iewes, Malach. 1. 13. 14. They offer, the torne, the lame, the ſicke, the corrupt, the leane, as Caine did. Therefore are they accurſed, verſe 8. Goe offer it to thy Prince, will hee be content, and accept thy perſon? It is the offering of an olde Dogge. Men commonly offer health, ſtrength, beauty: Youth to their luſts, to the world, and to Satan; but ſickeneſſe, weakeneſſe, deform tie, olde age to God. When they can ſerue the world no longer, then come they to God, the adulterer, and the olde whoore The world is an harlot, when her louer is quite ſpent, ſhe caſteth him off, then commeth he to God with his olde carkaſſe. Thoſe things that the world contemneth, or little regardeth, muſt God haue; but howſoeuer, the world muſt haue the firſt offer. Pouertie and baſeneſſe we can be content to giue to God, but riches and honour to our ſelues, and the diuell. For he ſaith indeede, All is mine. Luke 4. 6. God must be ſerued of Lazarus: Diues is too great, too good; therefore hee muſt not abaſe himſelfe to ſtoupe ſo lowe, but rather honourably deuote himſelfe to his belly, and to the Diuell the lord of the belly. The virginitie of the tender beautifull woman, is too good to be conſecrated to the Lord, to liue chaſtly, ſo the lewd lourdaine thinketh. So Nabal thought any morſell of his meate, or bottle of his drinke, too good for Dauid, but nothing was enough, nor good enough for himſelfe. So the Churle can ſpare nothing to the poore Miniſter, nor giue one houre of the weeke to God. But the olde whoore, the olde thiefe, the olde adulterer, the olde Nabal, &amp;c. that are ſodden, and rotten in their luſts, can be well content to giue

their carkaſſes vnto God. And when they haue at their laſt end diſpoſed their goods to their children, and their rich friends and kinsfolkes, they will happly ſend for the Miniſter to inſtruct them, and to pray for them, but they will not yet remember the afflictions of Ioſeph. And wherefore to pray? that God would now accept that carrion-idoll, and receiue it into the kingdome of glorie, and company of the Angells of Light. Theſe wicked beaſts thinke that they owe no more ſeruice to God all their life but this. But dogges, whoores, whooremongers, gluttons, liars and couetous perſons ſhall be without, and caſt downe into the fierie Lake among their fellow diuels, for whom is reſerued the blackeneſſe of darkeneſſe for euer, Reu. 22. 18. Solomon teacheth here a contrary leſſon. And ſo doth Dauid, Pſal. 119. 9. Wherewithall ſhall a young man redreſſe his way? Euen by taking heede thereto according to thy word. Heere is both rudeneſſe, ignorance, and ethnicall ciuilitie excluded. A young man muſt redreſſe his foule wayes, and purge out his menſtruous or naturall filth by the word of God, that both mortifieth, and quickeneth, killeth, and maketh aliue. The young man muſt be offered in ſacrifice with Iſaac, and grow in grace as he growes in yeares. Yong children were to be taught the meaning of the Paſſeouer; and ſo is the word to be preached to children, the grounds of Religion are to be ſettled in them.
               But let vs examine and inſiſt vpon the words of Dauid alittle, or whoſoeuer was the Authour. Wherein, heb. bammeh, that is, In what thing principally, or in what thing alone. The words doe imply an excellencie or ſingularitie. Young man. heb. nagnar, that is, rude, precipitant, inconſiderate, paſſionate; it properly ſignifieth a confuſion or mixture of things caſt out of the lappe, without regarde of order. Redreſſe his way. heb. iezakkeh, in the con ugation piel, that is, wholly, and all together, and alſo alway and continually. For the firſt, there are no excuſes, delayes or alleadgements for young men, they are t

                  e

                   to ſobrietie as well as olde, though euery mans infirmitie be to be borne withall. Young men are raſh and heedleſſe; olde men are

peeuiſh, and rigorous, &amp;c. Saint Paul ſayth, Tit. 2. 6. Exhort young men that they be ſober minded; graec. ſophronein: id eſt, temperantes eſſe. Now temperancie is a vertue ouerruling all luſts, and inordinate appetites, ſubdewing them to the Lawe of God, or godly reaſon. The partes thereof are ſhamefaſtneſſe, honeſty, abſtinence, ſobrietie, chaſtitie, continence, humilitie, modeſtie, ſeueritie, parſimonie, innocencie.
               The Apoſtles will is, that the faith of young men and women be exerciſed in theſe vertues. Againe, verſe 10. Seruants muſt adorne the doctrine of God in all things; and they are moſt commonly young, and eſpecially arrogate rudeneſſe, and libertie, as it were by their owne right. Moreouer, Epheſ. 6. 4. Children muſt be brought vp in inſtruction, and information in the Lord. graec. en paid
                        •
                     ia, cai noutheſia. Inſtruction ſtands in incouragement to vertue, and in correction, and reproofe. Concerning the former he ſaith, Prouoke not your children to anger, to grow into ſtubborne reſolutions, but cheerefully to obey you with loue and delight. Concerning the ſecond, Prou. 22. 15. Fooliſhneſſe is bound in the heart of a childe, but the rodde of correction fetcheth it out. Information ſtandeth in doctrine or catechizing, and in precepts of good manners.
               For the ſecond ſignification, he muſt redreſſe his way alwayes and continually, euen in childhood. Firſt, becauſe, as in the time of the Law the firſt-fruits were offered to the Lord, Deuter. 26▪ 2 and euery male firſt borne was giuen to God: So men muſt conſecrate their children vnto the Lord; and young men muſt offer themſelues to the Lord. To which offering Saint Paul alludeth, Rom. 12. 1▪ ſpecially the young man, 1. Corinth. 7. 34. In the Law, God commanded young men to be taught the meaning of the Paſſeouer; and to rehearſe his Lawes to their children; according to which precepts Timothie was brought vp, and Obadiah 1. Kings 18. 12. Abrahams and Cornelius families, and 2. Iohn 4. I reioyced greatly that I found thy children walking (not in ethnicall ciuilitie) in the truth. This condemnes all

vncleane beaſts. Againe, yong men haue promiſed in baptiſme, and ſet their ſeale, that they will forſake the world, the fleſh and the diuell. For baptiſme is the reſtipulation or repromiſſion of a good conſcience. It is the badge of our pro, ſeſſion, which is to conſecrate our ſelues wholly to Chriſt, into whoſe name we are baptized. Now we are conſecrated to God, when we die to ſinne, ſlaine with the ſacrifice, crucified with Chriſt, yea riſen out of the graue of ſinne, and glorified or ſanctified with him, Gal▪
                   2. 20. Yong men are to remember their promiſe or vow in baptiſme, and not like careleſſe dingthrifts to throw the debt on their ſureties, as Eſau that preferred a meſſe of pottage before his birthright.

The Spring produceth all things out of the earth, that were buried in Winter; euen ſo what lyeth buried in childhood, ſheweth forth it ſelfe in youth. Corruption muſt not ſhew it ſelfe forth now, but

the practiſe of inſtructions and godly informations formerly taught, euen grace wrought in childhood by theſe good meanes. The Summer ripeneth what the Spring brought forth; let middle age bring to maturitie and perfection that which hath bene taught vs in our yong age. The old in euill dieth in euill, a thouſand to one.
               Now that the conſideration of old age may take the déeper impreſſion in the heart of the yong, he depainteth it out by an allegoricall hypotypoſis, or liuely deſcription, firſt generally in theſe words, and after particularly in the next ſix verſes.
               
                  While the euill dayes come not. By euill dayes in generall is meant pouertie, weakneſſe, ſickneſſe, lameneſſe, blindnes, and other afflictions of body and ſtate, whereby a man is diſabled from the actuall performance of ſuch duties as hee is called vnto. Whatſoeuer abilitie or gift a man hath, that is his talent. And in all affaires and workes of this life, men take the appointed ſea on, and vſe the time with diligence; night letteth, raine letteth, winde and tempeſt letteth, theſe lets men redeeme with diligence, (and ſome with double diligence) and reſerue ſome workes for letting dayes, that euery moment of time may be ſupplied; ſo they will neuer be idle, that meane to be wealthy. So it muſt be with vs in our Chriſtian calling. We muſt worke with the Oare while we haue ſtrength, and after ſit at the ſterne. Let euery man do good while he is able. Let him take grace when it is offered and vſe it whē he is bidden. The Law ſaith, yea the heart and whole drift of the Law is this, Loue the Lord thy God with all thy heart, minde, ſoule, ſtrength, ſoule and body, ſuperiour and inferiour powers, euen while thou haſt an heart, which firſt liueth, and laſt dieth, while thou haſt a minde and a memory, while thou haſt ſtrength, while thou haſt health, while thou haſt wealth. Suffer no gift to be vnfruitfull. Euery talent muſt fructifie. Secondly, by euill dayes more ſpecially is meant the diſeaſe of olde age. For olde age is a diſeaſe, it is the conſumption of the whole body, whereby a man is diſabled from doing any thing. It is grieuous and weariſome. The lame is paſt labour, and the ſicke paſt

ſtudy. Theſe words, the euill dayes, as I thinke, haue relation to the body, and the next to the mind.
               
                  Nor the yeares draw nigh, wherein thou ſhalt ſay, I haue no pleaſure in them. An amplification figured by a Proſopopeia, whereby hee ſetteth the future age, perſon, words of the yong man before himſelfe. Men draw forth as liuely as they can, the pictures of their yong age, that in old age they may ſee their youth before their eyes, this is but a vanitie; yet may good vſe be made hereof. So contrarily, Solomon draweth out the picture of olde age, that men in time of youth may ſee and looke vpon, and remember their olde age, and death which followeth, and their account which followeth that. This is an inſtigation to workes of charitie and pietie. Better it is for a yong man to haue the picture of death before him, then for an old man to haue the picture of youth in his eyes. An old dotard is odious, and an old babbler hatefull.
               
                  I haue no pleaſure in them. Theſe words haue reference to the minde of the olde man, when the body is pained, the minde is grieued. When the bones are full of ach
                     •
                   it is paſt worke, and ſuffereth not the mind to be exerciſed in ſtudy, meditation, counſell, aduice, direction, &amp;c. Euery thing is tedious and irkſome to the wearie, he delighteth in nothing, but in 
                     •
                  eſting, ſleepe is ſweete to him, and ſo is death to the aged. The marriner ſpeaketh of the windes, the ſhepheard of his flocke, the plow-man of his grounds and cattell and the old man of his diſeaſes, infirmities, aches. His relations of things paſt are conciſe, independent, confuſe; he cannot manage and vſe his experiments and obſeruations to profit withal: yea his former practiſes are but ſpeculations to himſelfe, much more to another, therefore he hath no liſt to ſpeake, all things are quite altered the world is new, it ſurpaſſeth his skill. And thus it is with euery old man throughout all generations of the world, inſomuch that if they which haue bene long dead ſhould riſe againe as but out of an hundred yeares ſleepe, they could not know the world nor the way of it, and might as well cauſe the Sunne to go backward, as to reduce it to the former ſtate; and though it

ſhould be the ſame, and continue like it ſelfe, yet ſhould a man be vnlike himſelfe; and ſo ſhould the world one and the ſame in it ſelfe, appeare in new and ſtrange formes to him. As for example; All things are full of vanitie, miſery and griefe to the afflicted, and to him vpon whom God turneth his backe; whereas contrarily at the ſame time it is a paradiſe of pleaſure to an other. It is now an heauen, but if God inſtantly forſake a man vtterly, it is an hell. And as Diues deſired to be out of hell, ſo would he deſire to be out of the world; whatſoeuer his eſtate ſhould be heereafter, he had rather ſtand to the hazard then liue. If health, ſtrength, wealth &amp; honor could, at an inſtant, be put vpon the poore, ſicke, lame, blind beggar, the world ſhould be a new world, and ſuch a world as hee neuer imagined, the other dayes world ſhould be paſſed as in a dreame, and as but a dreame. And ſo doth olde age wonder at the change of the world, hee longeth after the former generation, and deſires to be dead. All is vanity, vexation and wearineſſe. But the yong generation thinketh not ſo. Their endeuors▪ expectations, and hopes are ſtrong and poſſible; but the aged deſpaireth, and ſorroweth, and is vexed to ſee vanities, and fooliſh preſumptions. To conclude, that which to his youth was a pleaſure, is to his age a paine; that which was a delight, is a wearineſſe and anger, and the Pallace is but a priſon houſe.

And this he doth allegorically, by manifold ſimilitudes drawne from common and vſuall things continually obuious to the eies and eares, the more firmely to fixe it in the memorie; to the end that conſidering the ſhortneſſe of time, and weakeneſſe

                  In the day when the keepers of the houſe ſhall tremble, and the ſtrong men ſhall bow themſelues, and the grinders ceaſe▪ becauſe they are few, and thoſe that looke out of the windowes be darkened.
               
               By the Keepers of the houſe are meant the hands: The

hand (ſayth Ariſtotle) is the organ of organes, or inſtrument of inſtruments. For whereas other members haue their ſeuerall offices, the office of the hand is manifold, and generall, ſeruing all the reſt. The body is an houſe, or city, or kingdome in it ſelfe; the king or chiefe ruler is the head, the hands are the keepers or guard. Euery creature hath his weapons for defence; man hath his hands, his hands are all weapons, euen as he is a little world. What all particular creatures can doe with their weapons, that can hee doe with his hands; yea what ſuttleties or meanes of getting foode is in them, all is in him, humano more. When the keepers of the houſe ſhall tremble. that is, with the palſie, cauſed of cold binding, or of heate conſuming, or of humors ſtopping the ſinewes.
               
                  And the ſtrong men ſhall bow themſelues. When the thighs ſhalbe weake, ſtanding looſe in the baſes, or ſockets of the knees, the ſpirit languiſhing, the ſinews withring, the bloud ſetling, and thickning in the veines as riuers in the drought of ſummer. For ſtrength is attributed to the bones, thighs, or legges Pſal. 147. 10. He delighteth not in the ſtrength of an horſe, he taketh not pleaſure in the legges of a man. Old mens knees buckle or bend forward, like an elbowe, through the weakeneſſe of their joynts and ſinewes; as drunkards goe ſtaggeringly when they are top-heauy, nimio ſolutus Iaccho; and their ſinewes diſſolued, and heat euaporated with loud talking, vehement contending, and much drinke. And the grinders ceaſe: that is, when the t

And thoſe that looke out at the windowes be darkened. That is, the eyes which are as ones head looking out at an hole, or window; the body is an houſe or tower; the eye-holes are windowes, through which the ſoule looketh out into the Cittie of the world.

The eyes of the aged are like an olde duſtie window.

                  And the doores ſhall be ſhut in the ſtreetes, when the ſound of the grinding is low, and hee ſhall riſe vp at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of muſicke ſhall be brought low.
               
               BY doores is meant the lips. The wind-pipe is the entry, the mouth is the doore-gate, the lips are the two-leafed doore of the heart or ſoule, as our Sauiour ſaith, Out of the aboundance of the heart, the mouth ſpeaketh. Euill thoughts come out of the heart, paſſing by the entry of the throate through the doore. The lips of old people are often pendulons, and tremulous, they keep them ſhut, to ſtay the daily diſtillation of rheume; neither haue they what to ſpeake among ſtrong men, becauſe their vnderſtanding and memory faileth them; they are teſtie, moroſe, cholericke and paſſionate, their voice is weake, and breath ſhort, and the ſtate of all things is ſo altered ſince they were yong, that they cannot tell what to thinke or ſay. Children and olde men are neither Counſellours nor Actors; the one committeth both theſe to the elder, 1. King. 3. 7. 9. the other to the yonger, 2. Sam. 19. 35. 37. The ſtrength of the one is to come, the other is gone.
               
                  When the ſound of the grinding is low; becauſe the teeth ſtand thin, or looſe, or moskerd at the roote, or that they are fallen out, and he cheweth with his gummes, and the grinding▪ cannot be heard.
               
                  And he ſhall riſe vp at the noiſe of the bird. The fulneſſe of humors, corpus ſucciplenum, is the aliment or food of ſleepe, as is to be ſeene in children and yong folkes; but the humors of old men are dried vp, as the ſtalkes of plants, and the corne in harueſt, and their skinne rough, withered and wrinkled as old trees. Hence it is that they cannot ſleepe ſoundly, but the crowing of the cocke, the noiſe of little birds, the whimpering of mice, euery ſmall ſtirrage w

                  And all the daughters of muſicke ſhall be brought low. An Hebrew phraſe of ſpeech, as 2. Sam. 12. 5. He that hath done this, is the child of death. By daughters of muſicke is meant the naturall organes or inſtruments of the voice or ſong, as the lungs, the wind-pipe, the teeth, the lips, whereof ſome ſhall be weake, ſome wanting, as in old vntuneable inſtruments. Or, by daughters of muſicke, may be meant the eares. As old men are dimme of eye-ſight, ſo dull of hearing, they diſcerne not the harmonie or diſtinction of ſounds, neither are affected with muſicke, as Barzillai to Dauid, I am this day foureſcore yeares olde, and can I diſcerne betweene good and euill? can thy ſeruant taſte what I eate, or what I drinke? can I heare any more the voice of ſinging-men and ſinging-women? 2. Sam. 19. 35.

                  Alſo when they ſhall be afraid of that which is high, and feares ſhall be in the way, and the Almond tree ſhall flouriſh, and the graſhopper ſhall be a burden, and deſire ſhall faile: becauſe man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the ſtreetes.
               
               BY that which is high, is meant knobbie hillocks, or ſmall extuberances in the way, little ſtones or clods, which old men feare to ſtumble on. And feares ſhall be in the way. As children going abroad feare many things, ſo doe olde men, becauſe they are vnwealdie, and vnable to auoide dangers; a little fall or turning aſide hurteth them, and they ariſe vp againe with difficultie and paine; they are afraid of dogs ſuddenly ruſhing out and croſſing the ſtreetes at euery noiſe; they feare the thronging of people, ſome on foote, ſome on horſebacke, ſome running and haſting about buſineſſe, others bearing burdens, whereof many are raſh and heedleſſe, hurting children, and thruſting olde people againſt the walls.
               
                  And the Almond tree ſhall flouriſh. A Synecdoche of the ſpeciall, for all trees. The Almond tree hath white flowers, it flouriſheth betimes in the Spring afore other trees; it is therefore of ſpeciall note, and a welcome fore-runner of

Summer,

                  ut the old man little regardeth, his couch, and the warme fire, and multitude of clothes, and therein keeping himſelfe warme at an euen ſtay, doth moſt comfort him. For the hot Sunne ſoone enfeebleth him, the coole Northerne and Eaſterne aire offendeth him. For though the Sunne be hot in Summer, yet the aire is variable as in Winter, and the influence of the ſtarres haue a compoſition, but not a mixture in the aire. So that though the Sun be hot, and ſcorcheth the face of the beholder, yet is the aire froſtie, and nippeth the necke. He that beſtirreth himſelfe in labour, ſweateth and panteth, but the wateriſh cold or froſtie cold ſuddenly pierceth through the powers of his bodie, and diſtempereth his bloud. Summer and Winter are all one, excepting the Sunnes reuolution. Yong men perceiue not thoſe differences of middle weathers, but onely extremities of heate and colde, ſtrong windes and ſtormy blaſts, &amp;c. but olde men feele euery change of the aire, yea when the ſtarres begin their buſineſſe, and are preparing their worke. They feele it before it come, and are therefore ſaide to carry their Almanacke in their bones, whereas yong men feele but the height and extremitie thereof, and beare it off without hurt, by reaſon of heate and fulneſſe of humours.
               
                  And the Graſhopper ſhall be a burden. A Synecdoche, as before, for the whiſtling and ſinging of all Birds. As the Almond tree in the Spring, ſo the Graſhopper in Summer or latter end of the Spring, Nuntia aeſtatis, affecteth not old age with any delightfull fancies, Cant. 2. 13. The melody of graſhoppers is more pleaſant in Summer, becauſe the aire is more cleare and pure, and therefore more ſiluer ſounding, but both naturall and artificiall muſicke to olde age is no more then the cr

                  raming of a new axeltree, for the noiſe ouerpowreth their feeble ſpirit, and youthfull fancies are vaniſhed away through coldneſſe, drineſſe and earthlineſſe of the dull dreggie humours; the fiery humour, alme aire, ſpirit of life is feeble, and is little

quickened with the warbling of melodious ayre. And deſire ſhall faile. All deſire and delight in ſuch things ſhall vaniſh, wherewith youth is moſt affected. Concupiſcence, and feminine appetite ſhall be extinguiſhed; no obiects affect the dull and dying ſences, but are rather grieuous as the Sunne and Raine are to olde ſtumpes, and trees, rather rotting and haſtening putrefaction, then quickening them. All things, but death, are tedious to the olde man.
               
                  Becauſe man goeth to his long home, and the mourners &amp;c. A reaſon of the tediouſneſſe and irkeſomneſſe of all things to old age; becauſe the old and decrepite is paſt the world, and neare to death, his time is ſpent. his pilgrimage is finiſhed, hee hath no more buſineſſe heere to doe, in this ſtrange Country, he is weary of the world, and the world is weary of him; he is but as an obſtacle in the way, an hinderer of buſie workers, not an helper. Mothers and Nurces haue pleaſure in Infants, and Parents in Children, and euery one affecteth yong people, whether free or bond, but olde people are burthenſome to all, neyther their talke nor company is acceptable. Therefore ſeeing himſelfe deſpiſed, or little regarded, and a burden; yea himſelfe a burden to himſelfe, he is deſirous to be at home, he would be out of trouble and at reſt. For here is nothing but vanity and miſery, all is winter both to the body and minde of olde age; well were he if hee were at reſt. And the mourners go about in the ſtreetes. His friends and neighbours are preparing themſelues againſt his funerall, and the widowes to make lamentation. As the Midwiues bring them into the world with joy; ſo the widowes (as it was a cuſtome among the Iewes) bewaile their death with mourning. This kinde of ſymphonie, heauy, and dead-ſounding flattes is moſt befitting querulous and mournfull olde age. The hoarſe Graſhopper, and the warbling Harpe, the whiſtling Bird, and the Flute, with all winde inſtruments, inſtrumentall and vocall conſents, as Barzillai ſaid to Dauid, are more fit for Chimham, 2. Sam. 19. 37. then for aged Barzillai, whoſe deſire is to turne backe, that hee may die in his owne Cittie, and be buried in the graue of his father, and of his mother.

                  Or euer the ſiluer cord be looſed, or the golden bowle be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountaine, or the wheele broken at the Cisterne.
               
               BY ſiluer coard is meant the marrow in the backe, which is incloſed in a bright ſmoothe skinne like to ſiluer, it is more properly called of the Arabians the Nuche of the backe, whereof this word Eunuch is compounded. For marrow is but the ſuperfluity of nutriment ariſing from the bloud for the moiſtening and nouriſhment of the bones. But the Nuche is of the nature of the braine, engendred of ſeede, created for ſence and motion; to wit, to procreate the ſinewes. For from the braine, and the Nuche, proceed diuers combinations or couples of ſinewes, ſeruing for the ſences, as hearing, ſeeing, feeling and motion of the members. For many ſinewes are deriued, thirty couples as the Anitomiſts write, are ſprung of this cord, and deriued from the knuckles or turning-joynts of the chine or backe bone into all the body ſeruing for bodily motion; from which againe, ſmall haires or threeds, like thoſe of the rootes of trees and leaues are diſperſed. When this cord is looſed, the backe bendeth, motion is ſlowe, and feeling faileth.
               
                  Or the golden bowle be broken, This golden bowle is the thinne membrane, or ſinewie skinne of yellow colour, called Pia mater, compaſſing the braine like a ſwathing cloth, or inner thinde of a tree, and entring within the diuers infoldings of the braine, and as it were cloathing the ſides of the three ventricles, or hollowes wherein the imagination, reaſon, &amp; memory are formed. It ſerues not only to inuolue and keep the braine whole and ſolide, in his place, as the ſhel or skin next the ſhell doth the egges: but alſo to containe, to gather together and ſuſtaine the veins and arteries which are deriued from thence like ſmall ramified channells, or pipes, or like a net. All the braine within, and without, is enwrapped and incompaſſed with this veiny and arteriall, or ſinewy net. The veines feede and nouriſh the braine with bloud, the arteries bring heate and ſpirit to it from

the heart, to giue the ſence of feeling vnto it. For though it impart ſence to all other parts, yet it hath none of it ſelfe, namely the narrowie white ſubſtance, but conuerteth or digeſteth the vitall ſpirits of the heart (attracted by this ſinewie pia mater or golden bowle) into animall or ſenſible ſpirits. In like caſe the ſperme hath foture and ſuſtenance in the matri

                  Or the pitcher be broken at the fountaine. By the pitcher he meaneth the veines, by the fountaine the liuer. For the liuer is the ſhop of bloud, conuerting the white chile which commeth of the meate digeſted in the ſtomacke into bloud. The ſubſtance thereof is red, and like clottered or curded bloud, aſſimulating the chile to the qualitie of it ſelfe. In the neather hollow part thereof is the portall veine, called the great carrying veine, which hath many branches (venae meſaraicae) like the ſmall and threddie rootes of a tree, by which the chile or iuyce of mea
                     •
                   concocted in the ſtomach, is tranſported frō the ſtomach to the liuer. And the portal vein hath iſſuing from it many ſmall veines like a net throughout the whole body of the liuer, that the chile being diſtributed into ſmall parcels, might be more perfectly concocted and conuerted into bloud. And the bloud is ingendered and purified in the middle of the liuer, which containeth the maſſe of the foure humours. Now it being here purified and boyled, the more heauie ſuperfluitie, which is ſeculent or dreggie, ſettleth to the bottome, and is carried by a veine into the ſpleene. It is the earthly ſowre or tart part of the chile, and is called blacke choler, or melancholy. Againe, the lighter ſuperfluitie boyleth vpward, which is the fiery, bitter or ſharpe part of the chile called yellow choler, which is caried by a veine into the gall. Vnderſtand by melancholy and yellow choler, not the pureſt thereof, which is mixed with the bloud, but the ſeparate ſuperfluitie or impuritie thereof. Thirdly, the wateriſh ſuperfluitie is caried to the kidneys and paſſages of the vrine. In the convexitie or vpper bowing part of the liuer is the hollow veine or bloudgate, whoſe branches receiue the bloud purified in the middle of the liuer, from the branches of the portall-veine. From

the bloudgate are innumerable veines ramified throughout all the body. For as the bulke of a tree receiuing ſap from the roote, as that againe doth from the ſmall ſpires, is ramified into all the branches, ſo doth the hollow veine, being the greateſt in all the body, (vehiculum alimenti) diſtribute the bloud throughout the body by his other veines, and firſt into the right ventricle of the heart, to receiue his vital heate for the nutrition of the whole body.
               
                  Or the wheele be broken at the ciſterre. By wheele is meant the head, by ciſterne the heart, from whence the vitall ſpirits are conueyed to the braine, and there conuerted into animall, to giue ſence and motion to the body. When the braine is weake, the ſinewes looſed, and the head hanging downe, the wheele beginneth to breake.

                  Then ſhall the duſt returne to the earth, as it was: and the ſpirit ſhall returne to God who gaue it.
               
               AS before he hath ſhewed the vnaptneſſe and diſabilitie of old age to performe ſuch ſeruice as the Lord requireh to be performed of man, hauing liuelily depainted it ſorth before his eyes, to the end that euery one may be ſtirred vp in youth and middle age to doe good workes, euen with all diligence to practiſe the duties of pietie and charitie: ſo here he putteth them in minde alſo of death, and their account that they muſt make before their Iudge.
               
                  And the duſt returne to the earth as it was. By duſt he meaneth the corpſe made of the duſt, by a metonymie of the matter. By earth he meaneth the elements whereof the body is compounded. As the body was created of the earth, ſo ſhall it returne thither againe, euen into the firſt and ſimpleſt matter.
               
                  And the ſpirit ſhall returne to God that gaue it. By ſpirit he meaneth the ſoule, which is compared to winde or aire, as the body is to duſt or earth. Becauſe winde or aire being an inuiſible ſubſtance, is the fitteſt thing in nature to vnderſtand the nature of the ſoule by. For whiles we are in the fleſh, we vnderſtand and conceiue of inuiſible, ſpiritual, eternall

things, humano more, by the phantaſie, per ſimilitudines &amp; locos, as Tully ſaith, and that either affirmatiuely or negatilely.
               
                  To God that gaue it. Hee doth not here define, whither the ſpirit ſhall go, but to whom, namely to his Iudge, who ſhall require a iuſt account of all the workes done in the fleſh good or euill, and ſhall accordingly giue ſentence vpon it. 2.

                  Verſe 8. 
                  Vanitie of vanities, ſaith the Preacher, all is vanitie.
               
               A Concluſion which is twofold; particular, of this treatiſe of mortification, to the 13. verſe. Generall of all Chriſtian doctrine, from thence to the end. Vanitie of vanities. He concludeth the proſſyllogiſme propounded in the beginning in the ſame words, to intimate both his mature deliberation, and the certaine truth thereof. For hauing ſeriouſly conſidered, and by long experience found out the condition of man, and ſtate of all things, he could conclude no otherwiſe then at the firſt he propounded, namely, that all things are vanitie, moſt vaine. All things are vncertaine, full of corruption, and matter of griefe. There is nothing whereon to truſt, nothing that affoordeth happie contentment. Euery ſtate of life is miſerable, both the contemplatiue, the ſenſuall, and the royall, both the priuate and the publicke, both the ciuill and alſo diuine gouernment to humane reaſon is nothing but confuſion and diſorder. And euen thoſe things that ſeeme to be in our power, haue their euents contrary to our intention and expectation. Now all this is to bring vs to the deniall of our ſelues, to reſtraine our greedy deſires, worldly vaine hopes, and vnprofitable endeuours, to truſt in the liuing God, who only is moſt wiſe, moſt good, and giueth all at his pleaſure, and in his owne time.
            
            
               
               
                  Verſe 9. 
                  And moreouer, becauſe the Preacher was wiſe, he ſtill taught the people knowledge: yea hee gaue good heede, and ſought out, and ſet in order many prouerbes.
               
               AN amplification of the concluſion, by an admonition begun here digreſſiuely, figured by a Prolepſis, the obiection whereof is vnderſtood, and is ſuch like; we are not bound to giue credence to all things contained in this treatiſe, ſeeing that no man is ſo perfect in this life, but that he may erre, and is defectiue and weake in the truth it ſelfe. Beſides that, the inordinate life of thoſe that write, to inſtruct and admoniſh others, is a meanes to diminiſh their authoritie, and to make their labours fruitleſſe. The anſwer is, verſ. 9. 10. 11. wherein he procureth authoritie to his doctrine, by ſundry arguments.
               
                  Becauſe the Preacher. The firſt argument is drawne from his perſon or office. He is not now Solomon ſeduced by his idolatrous wiues and flickering concubines, he is not Solomon giuing the reins to inordinate deſires, not Solomon enamoured with the glory of the world and worldly delights; but Solomon aged, experienced, prudent, repenting, mortified, reconciled to the Church of God, neare to death, neare to iudgement. Therefore is he the fitteſt, and moſt able to admoniſh others by reaſon of his knowledge and much experience in all things.
               
                  Was wiſe. The ſecond argument drawne from his extraordinary wiſedome. He was wiſe, yea the moſt wiſe, therefore are his admonitions to be regarded and followed.
               
                  He ſtill taught the people knowledge. A confirmation of the admonition, by the end and vſe of his wiſedome, which was the godly gouernment of his people, not meerly politicke for his owne tranquillity and pleaſure, and vainglory of his owne perſon, but diuine and religious, that the people might be contained in obedience, euen in the religious feare of God, rather then either by plaine force or other beguiling deuices, without care or loue of Religion, which come to naught. 1. King 3 7. what the intent of Solomons prayer

there is, and his meaning here, is euident, Deut. 17. 19. 20. by the charge of Moſes; the King muſt be continually exerciſed in the booke of God, that he may learne to feare the Lord and obey his word, without arrogating libertie to himſelfe to decline either to the right hand or to the left, that his hart be not lifted vp aboue his brethren to tyrannize and rule in his owne name, but to ioyne in the worſhip and ſeruice of God with them, yea to be a patterne and example of vertuous and godly life vnto them.
               
                  Yea he gaue good heed. The third argument is drawne from his carefull obſeruation and experience. He was wholly and continually attentiue to heare, to ſee, to diſcerne, to iudge, as the Hebrew word aizzen of the coniugation piel ſignifieth.
               
                  And ſought out. As he was attentiue and heedfull, ſo was he induſtrious and painfull to know much by liuely and ſelfexperience; this is the fourth argument.
               
                  And ſet in order many prouerbes. A confirmation of his knowledge, attentiueneſſe and induſtry, by the effect or fruite thereof, as 1. King. 4. 31. 32. 33. 34. He was wiſer then all men, then Ethan, Heman, Chalcol or Darda; he ſpake three thouſand prouerbes, and his ſongs were an hundred and fiue▪ he ſpake of all the creatures, and there came of all people to heare his wiſedome. By all theſe arguments we learne what the calling, gifts, and duties of true teachers are. Curſed therefore are theſe Popiſh ignorants, and our Atheiſticall politicians. They are both alike enemies to knowledge and the true feare of God.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 10. 
                  The Preacher ſought to finde out acceptable words▪ and that which was written was vpright, euen the words of truth.
               
               A Fifth argument drawne from the profitableneſſe of his doctrine. The Preacher ſought to find out words of delight, or acceptation, not vain ſpeculations▪ carnall inuentions, vnprofitable fables, curious and fruitles fancies, vain ianglings; but wholſome doctrine profitable for edification in faith and

obedience to the word of God, as S. Paul ſaith, 2. Tim. 3. 16. The Scripture is giuen by inſpiratiō of God for doctrine, &amp; reproofe, for correction &amp; inſtruction, that we might know the truth, and by the truth deſtroy lies and errours. And that we might be mortified and dead to ſinne, and quickened and renewed into holineſſe and righteouſneſſe. The ſetting forth of truth and righteouſneſſe, and the deſtruction of lying errours, and vice, is all that the Scripture aimeth at, that the man of God might bee perfected to all good workes of piety and charity. This is the drift of the Holy-Ghoſt in the Pen-men of the Scriptures, and of Solomon heere, and ſo of euery teacher ſent of God.
               
                  And that which was written, was vpright, &amp;c. A ſixt Argument. As they were profitable writings or delightfull to them that loued trueth and righteouſneſſe, ſo were they vpright and true, not deceitfull, flattering, men-pleaſing, but the true wholeſome foode of the ſoule. Solomon, in vttering the words of this Treatiſe, had the infallible aſſiſtance of the Spirit.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 11. 
                  The words of the wiſe are as goads, and as nailes faſtened by the maiſters of Aſſemblies, which are giuen from one Shepheard.
               
               AN explication of thoſe acceptable, and vpright words of truth, taught by the truely wiſe, that are inſpired of God, by the effect or vſe thereof, which is illuſtrated by a twofold ſimilitude of goads, and nailes. The words of the wiſe are as goads. The heauy and idle Oxe, minding no other thing, of himſelfe, but eating and ſleeping, is rouzed vp, and cauſed to doe profitable ſeruice to his owner, by the prickes of the goad, as the horſe is by the ſpurre▪ and 
                     •
                  he whippe: euen ſo by the reproofes and checkes of the wiſe, are the drowſie and ſluggiſh carnalls ſtirred vp to duties of pietie and charitie, which of themſelues are but ſelfe louing lumpes of ſinne, vnwilling, vnapt, dull and blockiſh to learne or practiſe any workes, eyther of worſhip or ſeruice. Pride, couetouſneſſe, gluttonie and venery make them like

oxen, horſes and ſwine, ſpirituall ſluggards, drunkards and bedlums; yea, as vnprofitable drones and vermine, ſuch as are for waſt, deſtruction and euill. Theſe droſſie ones are moued, rouzed, awaked, and prouoked to ſome good duties by th
                     •
                   pricking, ſharpe, or ſmart words of the wiſe, chaſing and rubbing theſe dead ſleepers in ſinne, and mollifying, yea ſcarifying their rough, cruſted, barked conſciences that cannot bleede, ſtirring vp the idle worme to her worke, with the tarte vinegar of Gods iudgements and plagues denounced againſt them in the Lawe. This is the effect and vſe of words ſpoken by the wiſe, inſpired of God. But contrarily, ſuch as ſpeake of themſelues, making merchandiſe of the word, are flatterers and claw-backes, ſowing pillowes vnder the elbowes of ſleepers, to make them ſleepe out their eyes, and to make fooles runne ſtarke madde. They winke at proude carnalls, but doe not mortifie them, that they might deuote themſelues to good workes; yea they doe rather glorifie them, and admire their perſons becauſe of aduantage, and ſo both fall downe into the ſame condemnation.
               This hath beene alwayes the practiſe of falſe prophets, falſe apoſtles, and ſhepheards of olde, and is now at this preſent. And the proude, couetous, oppreſſing carnalls preferre and countenance ſuch teachers, they dignifie them and honour them to be flattered by them, and partake with them in their ſinnes. But their madneſſe ſhall in the end be manifeſted, and the patient abiding of the meeke ſhall not alway be forgotten Paul ſaith, Let him not be a yong Scholler, &amp;c. But who is now ſo fit as a yong Scholler, proude and talkatiue, a faſhionable foole, ciuill, ethnically ciuil and courtier like? The fineſt Gentleman, the beſt Miniſter. But a fine Gentleman, and a Romiſh reader, will prooue all one in the end, I feare; yet is the Reader better then the proude Corinthian Preacher.
               
                  And as nayles faſtened by the maiſters of Aſſemblies. Euen as nailes being driuen into pales, doe faſten them to their 
                     •
                  a les; ſo the godly and graue ſentences of teachers which are the maiſters of Aſſemblies, or congregations gathered

together to be inſtructed in the knowledge of God and their duties, do pierce into their hearts to vnite them vnto God and one to another, and to containe them for euer in that holy vnion of faith and communion of loue, which is the true coporation of the Saints or inuiſible Church. Contrarily, falſe teachers and ſchiſmatickes breake this vnion of faith, and diſſolue this bond of loue, bringing in erroneous doctrines and opinions, to corrupt the mindes and manners of men, whereby they fall from the godly purity and plainneſſe of the Goſpell, to contentions and proud ianglings, but in the meane ſpace liue according to their luſts, yea without all ſenſe of Religion, and are to euery good worke reprobate, yea enemies to the truth of that which outwardly in hypocriſie they profeſſe, as they do which ſtand vp at the Creed, but fight againſt the Goſpell; which make a leg at the name of Ieſus, but hate his commandement of faith and loue; which receiue the ſigne of the croſſe, but fight vnder the diuels banner againſt Chriſt and his kingdome. This is the miſerable condition of Papiſts, Libertines, Atheiſts, Epicures, whoſe hearts are not brawny but ſtony, that neither goades nor nailes can pierce into them. Woe be to them, for they are full of enuy and hatred as Cain, they are mockers as Iſmael, deuoted to their bellies as Eſau. They are as they that ſtriue with the Prieſt, Amos 5. 10. Woe be vnto them, for they are falſe accuſers of their brethren, and ſtir vp hatred againſt their brethren that are better then they. Woe be vnto them for they are dogs▪ and wolues in ſheepes cloathing, thirſting for the bloud of the Saints; they preſent themſelues among the people of God, as Satan did, to cauill, Iob 2. and take all occaſions to diſgrace the truth, and to bring the feare of God into ſlander. Wo be to thoſe reuolting Pagans, which oppoſe Princes lawes againſt the kingdome of Ieſus Chriſt, whereof they are the guard and protectors. Theſe as the firſt begotten of the diuell, oppoſe the letter of the law againſt the intent, equitie and conſcience thereof, ſaying that they are for law, not for conſcience.
               
                  Which are giuen from one Shepheard. An amplification of thoſe acceptable and vpright words of the wiſe, by the efficient

cauſe or author thereof, namely God in Chriſt, termed a Shepheard, or chiefe Shepheard, becauſe he gathereth together and feedeth his people with the ſpirituall bread and waters of life, as ſhepheards do their flockes.

               A Regreſſion to the admonition interrupted, ver 9. 10. 11. This verſe containeth firſt the admonition it ſelfe▪ ſecondly the reaſons. The admonition is in the former words, wherein are to be conſidered, firſt the ſubiect of it, namely the perſons to whom it is directed, euery faithfull Reader, and therefore he ſpeaketh to all vnder the name of one, and that out of loue as a father to his child; and that euery one might hearken to him as a louing and dutifnll childe to his father, he calleth him his ſonne. Secondly, the matter it ſelfe. By theſe be admoniſhed. An exhortation is a prouocation or incitement to embrace and follow that which is good: an admonition is an inducement of a cautelous conſideration, or practicke remembrance of that which is hurtfull and euill to auoide it. It is enforced by deſtructiue arguments, tending to deterre and auert the party admoniſhed from an error, to embrace and follow the contrary good. Exhortation and admonition are of a thing already proued and granted; bnt perſwaſion and diſſwaſion are of a thing doubtfull and probable. Be admoniſhed by theſe arguments euidently euicting the vanity of worldly things, and auoid the vnprofitable courſes of worldly minded men, who ſeeking for an happy ſtate in the ſtate of corruption and miſery, find nothing, but rather loſe the true felicity. Contrarily, lay hold on theſe precepts of wiſedome, charity and piety, and reſt thy ſelfe on God, who ſhall without thy carking and thoughtfull caring adminiſter all things needfull for thee and thine. For thou canſ
                     •
                   not adde one cubite to thy ſtature, nor make one haire white or blacke, but euery plans

which God hath not planted ſhall bee rooted vp. Let this therefore that hath beene ſaid, be ſufficient to ſettle and ſtabliſh thine heart and minde in the right path, that I haue ſhewed thee. Rejoyee in that which God ſendeth, ſtrife, and vaine feares neyther make nor mend; be content with thy ſtate, doe good alway to thy abilitie, and there ſet vp thy reſt. If this will not yet ſatisfie, then remember Lots wife. Remember Diues. Remember the couetous rich man, Luke 12.
               
                  Of making Bookes there is no end, &amp;c. A two▪fold reaſon inforcing the admonition vpon the Reader. The firſt is drawne from the vnprofitableneſſe of many words and writings of men, which are diſcordant and diſtractiue of mens mindes, which falleth out whereas the infallibilitie or direction of the ſpirit is wanting▪ which gift was promiſed to Solomon, 1▪ 
                  Kings 3. 12. and he was aſſured thereof; and therefore, without vaine preſumption, may iuſtly retract the Reader from other warbling, erroneous, imperfect diſcourſes, and treatiſes of men, wherewith doubtleſſe hee was acquainted, as in his Booke hee intimateth plainely enough to this diuine-inſpired Treatiſe of his owne concerning the chiefe good. So that all writings, except thoſe that are warrantable by, and grounded on theſe ſpeciall pen men of the Holy-Ghoſt, are vnprofitable, and to little purpoſe, affoording no tranquillitie, peace, durable joy, comfort to the heart and conſcience. For they can not impart that to others which they altogether want themſelues. For they being in darkeneſſe ſeeke onely for it, where it cannot be found, ſeeing that God hath ſubdewed man, and all things to vanitie, which can neuer be the mother or fountaine of felicitie. And the earthly paradiſe is deſtroyed. This text maketh litle for thoſe that being ſo eagerly and ſeruently deuoted to their worldly and fleſhly luſts thinke, and ſay, that ſo much preaching and writing is neceeleſſe. For Solomon taxeth not the holy and great Labours of the Lords Miniſters, who keepe themſelues within the compaſſe of his written word, but he taxeth theſe ſlouthfull ones, ſleepie, and ſpirituall drunken ones, ignorants, and fooles that

euen weary the Meſſengers o

                  e, and yet will they not be awaked; they are heauy-hearted▪ dulleared, pore-blind, long about alittle, and that little is quickely forgotten. If the Preacher be but ſilent a while▪ they are ready to daunce about the golden Calfe, and beginne to thinke and talke of Egypt agayne. They are like the ſtone of Siſiphus▪
                   or heauy logges pulled vp the ſide of a ſtiepe hill, which luſh downe agayne, when a man letteth his hold go. Againe on the contrary ſide, this taxeth thoſe, that are quick of hearing, but heauy footed, ripe in the top, dead at the roote, nimble▪chapt, and ſlowe handed. There is none end of their hearing, new inſtruments, new voyces, new tunes, new formes, new ſtiles, they are all for nouelties, full of the itch▪ full of curioſitie, but their heart goeth after their pride, after their couetouſneſſe. Theſe extreames are at length coincident. There is none end of ſpeaking and writing to the ſluggiſh and curious. They are both a great burden to their teachers, they will neuer be pleaſed. Solomon therefore in theſe words willeth them to be doers, and diligent practiſers, the one ſort to humble themſelues, the other to rouze themſelues to obedience, that they may haue experience, and feeling in themſelues of the grace and wiſedome of God; (manus eſt cauſa ſapientiae) and then ſhall they comfort, not weary to death their teachers, as many doe. But thoſe greedy eares, proude and couetous, that are ſo zealous to heare, and yet their teachers but figge-frailes, and themſelues ſucking ſpiders, caſting them out when they haue ſuckt them as they doe their oyſter ſhells, are but gadding carnalls and bloud-ſuckers. When they would be ridde of their teacher, then will they put him out of breath; and when he cannot preach twice a day, hee may ſit vnder the Iuniper tree with Elias, to be fedde with Rauens. I ſpeake not this to ſet dogges on barking, to whom all things are alike; but the God of order hateth confuſion) which take vp all occaſions of euill ſpeaking, but rather to ſtoppe their mouthes, by putting a difference betweene the truely religious, and truely deuoted, and gadding talkers, whoſe

backs and eyes are full of pride and adultery. But our Allalikes are not for differences, but confuſion. But when they haue once made a confuſion of good and euill, ſowre and ſweete, light and darkneſſe, then in the fleſh will they make differences, they cannot abide confuſion, euery one ſtriueth for ſuperiority and preheminence, euery one preferreth him ſelfe before other▪ and glorieth in his riches, in his learning, in his knowledge, in his skill, in his friends, in his ſtrength, and men acknowledge ſuch differences; but of light and darkneſſe, carnall and ſpirituall, precious and vile, they will admit no difference: all muſt be alike; and the more carnall the more acceptable. The ciuill and orderly vicious, the beſt garniſher of vice in vertues robes and colours, is the moſt wiſe, and moſt commended.
               
                  And much ſtudy is a wearineſſe to the fleſh. Hee ſpeakes not this of the paines of the holy writer, nor of the reader, that ought to exerciſe himſelfe day and night in the Scriptures, and that with delight, but of thoſe erraticall extreame perſons, of whom I ſpake before, both writers and readers. Dauid exerciſed himſelfe continually in the Law, Pſal. 1. 2. but he got wiſedome by doing it, Pſal. 119. 98. 99. 100. And Plato ſaith. Manus eſt cauſa ſapientiae. When a man hath diſquieted and tormented himſelfe long about predeſtination, &amp;c. yet ſhall the ioyfull and cheerfull practiſe of Chriſtianitie ſuſtain him, and faith in Gods mercy towards him ſhall be his onely comfort in life and death. For all our felicity is in Gods acceptation: and he putteth none away that conſtantly ſeeke him with their whole heart, that is, ſincerely, not guilefully, Pſal. 32. 2. Neither doth he forſake any that do not firſt forſake him. The vnderſtanding of this may we ſee in Iudas the guilefull diſciple, and the eleuen true diſciples. Know thy maiſters mind, heare what he ſaith to thee, and apply thy ſelfe to do his wil without ſeaching into his ſecrets, and thou ſhalt neuer loſe his fauour, nor be turned out of his ſeruice. For he is not ſo eaſily diſpleaſed, but beareth with innumerable imperfections and infirmities in his children, whom he meaſurably chaſteneth, and deliuereth not ouer to death. He is moſt wiſe, moſt good, moſt mercifull, if thou doeſt not

account his mercy greater then thy ſinnes, thou doeſt limit him who is infinite. To know thy ſinnes, to acknowledge and confeſſe them, and to deſpaire of righteouſneſſe and ſaluation in thy ſelfe and by thy ſelfe, is that which he requireth: for then thou wilt flie to him, truſt in him, rely on him, and be euer thankfull to him. Surely, when thou art none of thine owne, then art thou his. Much reading and ſtudying is indeed a wearineſſe, but it is a delightfull thing to do the commandements. Experimentall knowledge is full, delightfull and comfortable. A litle that one eateth, is better then all that a man can heare of, reade of, ſtudy of, dreame of. Greedy ſpeculatiſts and hearers, are but dreamers, they are neuer ſatiſfied, but ſoone weary of well doing: but God will be heard of vs, ſeene of vs, and ſerued of vs as if he were a King in bodily preſence. This is the fulneſſe of ſound faith, feare and obedience, not fantaſtick dreaming, as they that would ſeem to be as deuout as Mary, and yet are as proud as Iezebel; as zealous as Dauid, but as couetous as Nabal▪
                   A meere deluſiō.

                  Let vs heare the concluſion of the whole matter: Feare God, and keepe his commandements, for this is the whole dutie of man.
               
               THe generall concluſion of the whole ſcope of all Chriſtian doctrine and exhortation. For all is but the mortification of the old man, and the quickning or renewing of the inner man, and both theſe are one▪ They are one motion, and differ but in reſpect of the termes, à quo, &amp; ad quem. For what is that which mortifieth but life? The ſpirit of mortification enliueth, and the ſpirit of life mortifieth at one and the ſame inſtant, vno actu. The concluſion is inferred by way of exhortation, to moue attention, to print in the memory the ſubſtance of all, and the maine end of all writings, which whoſoeuer hath not rooted in his heart, he can neither vnderſtand rightly, nor do truly, but is a lyer, euen a very hypocrite in his beſt ſpeechss and beſt actions. Thomas ſayd to Chriſt, Ioh. 14. 5. We know not whither thou goeſt, and how can we know the way? The knowledge of the place goeth before

the knowledge of the way; and the maine end and drift of euery inſtruction and action, is firſt to be weighed. What is the end of all writings, but to feare God and keepe his commandements? He that doth not this, knoweth nothing, and is but a dreamer.
               
                  Feare God and keepe his commandements. This is the ſubſtance of the concluſion, conſiſting of two precepts; the one whereof concerneth the inward man, or the affection; the other concerneth the outward man or the action; the one the heart, the other the life. Concerning the firſt; by feare is meant a reuerent awe of Gods maieſtie, proceeding from faith, whereby through the feeling of his loue, as well as the weight of his diſpleaſure, we are afraid to offend him. Feare is put for the whole worſhip of God, by the figure Synecdoche. It is the principall part of Gods worſhip, and keepeth all the other in their duties, all euill being committed where it is wanting. Therefore ſayth the Scripture, Bleſſed is the man that feareth alway. It is the beginning of wiſedome, true and ſauing wiſedome, Prou. 14. 16. and the perfection of piety. For the better vnderſtanding hereof, I wil inſiſt a litle vpō it.
               There are ſundry ſorts of feare.
               
                  Firſt, Dabolicall, Iam. 2. 19. The diuels beleeue and tremble.
               Second▪ 
                  Naturall. It is an affection or paſſion of the heart, whereby we feare not onely death or diſſolution, but dangers and euils that are deſtructiue of our good eſtate or welfare. This feare is by naturall inſtinct in all ſenſible creatures as well as in man, and in the godly as they are men, and in Chriſt as he was man, ſubiect to our infirmities, not to ſin. This feare of it ſelfe is not a ſinne, for Chriſt could not ſin, but in vs it is ſin, by reaſon of our corruption, becauſe we do not order it according to the law of God; but Chriſt in fearing death did alſo ſubmit himſelfe to the decree of his Father, according to the commandement, Thou ſhalt loue the Lord thy God with all thine heart, &amp;c. So feare was ouercome of loue, or rightly ordered by loue. So the godly after the example of Chriſt, though they feare death, yet they humble themſelues to death and to all croſſes, becauſe the loue of God taketh away or extenuateth feare.
               
                  
Third, Worldly feare. This is the corruption of naturall feare, when as men do forſake or deny God and Chriſt, in what meaſure ſoeuer, that they might not loſe their goods, good name, pleaſures, preferments, &amp;c. The worldly, iealous, zealous, deuout, are full of this feare. Their feare is great and continual; but it is a pernicious and damnable feare: and all that they feare, be they neuer ſo ſubtil and prouident, ſhal fall vpon them. Math. 10. 28. Feare not them which kill the body, &amp;c. Ioh. 12. 42. many beleeued on Chriſt, but durſt not confeſſe him, leſt they ſhould be put out of the Synagogue, and incurre the diſpleaſure of great ones. This was Nicodemus his infirmity, Ioh 3. 2. The Princes, Prieſts and Phariſes were drunke with this feare, Ioh. 11 48.
               Fourth, Seruile feare. It is proper to the wicked. For their conſcience being guilty of ſin, they feare the wrath of God, both temporall and eternall, Prou. 28. 1. The wicked flie, when no man purſueth. The wicked are like a raging ſea, Eſay 57. 20. It hath two effects: Firſt, it reſtraineth from groſſe crimes, and conſtraineth to outward duties, at leaſtwiſe it mitigateth the extremities of ſinners, as doth alſo the ſword of the magiſtrates, which curbeth thoſe that are ſenſleſſe, or haue but a dogs conſcience. Hence the Poet ſayth:

                     Oderunt peccare boni virtutis amore,
                     Oderunt peccare mali virtutis amore.
                  
When as Paul diſputed of righteouſneſſe, temperance, and the iudgement to come, Felix trembled, Acts 24. 25. Secondly, it worketh hardnes of heart and deſperation in ſome, when it groweth to an height of wicked reſolution, all hope being vtterly quenched.
               Fifth, Filiall or ſonlike feare. This is proper to the regenerate, who by this feare are moued to auoide ſinne and to liue godlily and righteouſly. It ariſeth from the knowledge of God and out ſelues, and from the feeling of his acceptation &amp; loue of vs, wrought in our hearts by the holy Ghoſt. Of this Solomon ſaith▪ 
                  Prou, 1, 17▪ and Pſal, 111. 10. The feare of the Lord is the beginning of wiſedome, a good vnderſtanding haue all they that do his commandements. Iob 28. 28. The feare of the Lord is wiſedome, and to depart from euill is vnderſtanding.
                  
More plainely, this feare is thus begotten.
               1. When a man heareth the Lawe, what is there commaunded and forbidden, the Holy-Ghoſt commeth and taketh away the vaile of naturall blindneſſe, and ſlumbering, cauſing him to ſee his ſinne, and to beholde the wrath of God vpon him euen to lay them both to his hard heart, whereupon feare troubleth the conſcience, and breaketh the hard heart.
               2. When a men in this caſe heareth the Goſpel, the Holy-Ghoſt inlightneth his minde to vnderſtand, and beleeue, and to apply the promiſes to himſelfe, whereupon hee beginneth to feele quietneſſe, and peace of conſcience, being more and more perſwaded that hee is beloued of God. Now on this perſwaſion ariſeth the loue of God for his loue, grace, and mercie in Chriſt▪ On this loue ariſeth a new feare, namely, to diſpleaſe God ſo louing and mercifull, Pſal. 130. 4. There is mercie with thee that thou mayeſt be feared.
               
               Of this filiall feare there be foure degrees expreſſed by the feare of children toward their parents, whereof there are foure degrees.
               Firſt, a childe loueth his parents, and flieth to them as his chiefe refuge, yet is he held in obedience with threatthreatnings, and feare of the rodde. Secondly, partly by reaſon, partly by the rodde. Thirdly, leſſe by the rodde, and more by reaſon. Fourthly, by reaſon alone without the rodde. Now to apply this.
               Firſt, children haue a ſincere loue to their parents, and a generall diſpoſition to be conformable to them in al things; yet being left to themſelues, they are carried by their childiſh fancies and vaine deſires, both vnprofitable to themſelues and to their parents for want of reaſon. Hence Solomon ſayth, Follie groweth in the heart of a childe, but the rodde of correction fercheth it out. So the regenerate newly conuerted haue a ſincere, though weake loue of God, and a generall diſpoſition and right motions to obey God in all things; yet without the conſideration of Gods iuſtice, and feare of puniſhment, or rather corrections, they are apt to

be carried and ouercome with the luſts of the fleſh, allurements of the world, and baites of Sathan. Therefore Dauid ſayd; It is good for me that I haue beene in trouble. And Paul 1. Corinth. 11. 32. When we are iudged, we are chaſtened of the Lord, that we might not be condemned of the world.
               
               Secondly, parents inſtruct their children in what is to be done, and what to be eſchewed, and that with threatnings of puniſhment. And for feare of the rodde more then vpon conſideration of their owne good, they obey, becauſe reaſon is yet weake, and they haue but ſmal diſcerning of good and euill: So likewiſe, God teacheth vs what we ought to beleeue, what to doe to his glorie, and our owne good; with threatnings of temporall puniſhments, and croſſes of ſundry kindes▪ by which we are held in awe▪ and contained in duty till we come to more perfection and diſcerning.
               Thirdly, when a childe, by reaſon of age, is riper in vnderſtanding and reaſon, hee beginnes to know his parents, and his duty towards them, and what is for his owne good. Therefore he is held in obedience, not for feare of the rod, but inſtruction and exhortation preuaileth moſt. So wee, growing more perfect in the knowledge of God our father in Chriſt, what his loue hath beene towards vs, what hee hath done for vs, and will doe for vs, are mooued to obey him, not ſo much for feare of puniſhments, as by inſtruction, which we deſire, and exhortation vnto which wee yeelde with delight. And as faith and loue growe ſtronger, ſo doth the Lawe with the threatnings and curſes thereof growe the weaker. The Lawe is our Schoolemaſter in our nonage, but when the fulneſſe of yeares are come, wee are our owne inſtructers, and able to gouerne our ſelues by our owne reaſon.
               Fourthly, when the childe commeth to perfect reaſon and diſcretion, the feare of the rod goeth away. For, hauing now the perfect knowledge of the loue, care, and benefits of his father towards him, and alſo of his duety towards him againe, he performeth obedience with willingneſſe, delight, ioyfulneſſe, fearing to diſpleaſe and offend him, and is aſhamed of childiſh follies: So wee growing

ſtronger in faith, and perfect men in Chriſt, doe willingly, cheerefully, and with delight worſhip and ſerue God, fearing to diſpleaſe him vpon conſideration of his greatneſſe, goodneſſe, mercy, and benefites towards vs, Galat, 3. 25. After that faith is come, wee are no longer vnder a Schoolemaiſter, that is, the ceremonies and threatnings of the Law, childiſh rudiments and feares, Rom. 8. 15. Yee haue not receiued the ſpirit of bondage to feare againe, but the ſpirit of adoption, &amp;c. He is called the ſpirit of bondage, when he worketh weakely in vs, as in babes and younglings, whom the Lawe terrifieth from ſinne, and compelleth to obedience. He is called the ſpirit of adoption, when he worketh more ſtrongly in vs, or hath brought vs to a greater perfection of the degrees of faith, hope, loue, whereupon we are termed perfect men in Chriſt. The Magiſtrate is not terrible to the innocent, nor the rodde to the man of age, Romans 12. 3. Wilt thou be without feare of the power▪ doe well▪ and thou ſhalt haue praiſe: So likewiſe, wilt thou be without feare of the curſe, of wrath, of hell? be ſtrong in faith▪ hope, loue, and thou ſhalt delight, in God, in his word, Miniſters, and children. His word ſhall be thy delight and joy. 
                     •
                  . Iohn 3. 21. Beloued if our hearts condemne vs not, we haue boldneſſe with God. Chap. 4. 18. There is no feare in loue, for perfect loue caſteth out feare: For feare hath painefulneſſe, hee that feareth is not perfect in loue. Thus much of feare.
               
                  And keepe his Commandements. This is the effect of true feare, The roote is faith, the ſappe or iuyce is feare, the fruit is obedience. As is the inward man, ſo is the outward man, the heart is deceitfull▪ but the hypocrit cannot be hid, for the tree ſhall be knowne by his fruite, not by the ſight, or outward ſhew thereof, for the wilding maketh a fairer ſhew then many a good apple, but by the taſte. Who is he that in ſincerity keepeth the Commaundements? Hee that ſetteth God alway before his face. Moreouer, obedience is Legall, or Euangelicall: of the latter Solomon here ſpeaketh. For both the curſe, and rigorous exaction of the Lawe is remoued away from them that beleeue, which are the ingenuous and free borne ſonnes of God. In theſe times there

are many maiſters, but few doers; therefore ſhall they receiue the greater condemnation. They would haue good done, ſo that they themſelues haue no hand in it. Here is no feare of God, but a deceitfull and wicked ſpirit▪ For how much a man doth, ſo much he feareth. He that doth the commandements is true, the reſt are babblers. Neither haue there bene ſo many tongue-tied Chriſtians in times of Popery, as there ſhall be phantaſticall babblers and deceitfull Sataniſts in theſe laſt times, whoſe words and deeds are all falſhoods and lies: yet it is but that multitude of malignants, who wil either be idolaters, or Atheiſts, of a falſe religion, or of no religion.
               
                  For this is the whole dutie of man. A reaſon drawne from the end of creation and redemption, which is nothing elſe but to feare God▪ and keepe his commandements, which who ſo doth not, is a ſon of perdition. Eph. 1. 4. He hath choſen vs in Chriſt, that we ſhould be holy, and blameleſſe before him in loue. Tit. 2. 14. He gaue himſelfe for vs, that he might redeem vs from all iniquitie, and purifie vs vnto himſelfe, a peculiar people, zealous of good workes. By zeale he meaneth not the bare pulpit zeale, but deuotion. Many can counterfeit zeale, as vpon a ſtage, but when they are out of the pulpit, they are of a quite contrary faſhion, gallants, proud, ſtately. But the Frier ſhall riſe vp in iudgement againſt them. To conclude, to feare God and keep his commandements, is the adequate, obiect or ſubiect of the whole man inward &amp; outward. To this one thing muſt a man haue reſpect in euery thing. Hither muſt he refer all his ſtudies and labours, if he will be partaker of true felicitie. This onely is true profite, and all exccept this is vanitie, though the blind world ſeek for felicitie and meanes of bliſſe in any thing, and in euery thing beſides this.
            
            
               
                  Verſe 14. 
                  For God ſhall bring euery worke into iudgement, with euery ſecret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be euill.
               
               AN argument of confirmation, drawn from the laſt iudgment, whether the generall or the particular, tending to terrifie the wicked▪ and comfort the godly▪ 
                  For God ſhal bring into iudgement▪
                   The Iudge is God, moſt mightie, not to be

reſiſted by ſtrength; moſt iuſt, not to be corrupted with bribes; moſt wiſe, not to be blinded with cauils, Euery worke with euery ſecret thing. A declaration of the iudgement by the obiects, viz. things knowne, whether words or workes, publicke or priuate; and things vnknowne, not onely done and ſpoken in ſecret, but the thoughts and imaginations of the heart, with the affections and diſpoſitions thereof. All which are amplified by a diuiſion in reſpect of their qualities, good or euill. As euery perſon ſince the creation till the laſt conſummation ſhall be ſummoned, and not one eſcape; ſo ſhall euery deed, word &amp; thought be iudged, not one ſhal eſcape. For the bookes ſhall be opened, and euery ſecret thing ſhall be reuealed, the booke of Gods omniſcience, and the booke of mans conſcience. That which is now forgotten as a thing in ſleepe, ſhall then be brought to remembrance as a thing to a man awaked, which is as freſh in memory, and more freſh then it was before. As the roote lying buried in the earth in Winter, ſheweth forth it ſelfe in the Spring; ſo ſhall all things now buried in forgetfulneſſe, be then made manifeſt vnto vs, as if they were layd before our eyes. All hearts ſhall be layd open, to the diſcouery and terror of the wicked, and to the manifeſtation of the godly, whoſe faith and truth ſhall now appeare, and theſe ſhall enter into euerlaſting reſt and ioy, but the other ſhall go into euerlaſting fire.
