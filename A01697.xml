            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

                  Helpe now ye faythfull Wyues, to wayle this faythfull Wyfe:
                  Whoſe flowynge Vertues were not hyd, whyle ſhe enioyed lyfe,
                  As well to Frende as Foe, her Curteſie was knowne:
                  But now the Goddes haue thought it good, to clayme agayne their owne.
                  
                     LVCINA hath forgot her Chardge, the fatall Fates haue don:
                  
                     CLOTHO hath left the Rocke of lyfe: and LACHAS longe hath ſpon.
                  Theſe werie of their wonted toyle, at mightie IOVES Decree:
                  To whom the Heauens the Earth and Sea: and all thynges Subiect bee.
                  The Siſter dire, fearce ATROPOS, with ſchortchyng cuttynge Knyfe,
                  Hath ſhred the Threede that longe dyd holde, this Godly Ladies lyfe.
                  Whoſe loſſe deare Dames bewayle: and weepe with many a teare:
                  For you ſhall miſſe a Matrone graue, in daunger you to cheare.
                  Whoſe Counſell in their neede, her Neighbours could not want:
                  Her Helpe vnto the Comfortleſſe, could neuer yet bee ſcant.
                  Vnto the poore oppreſt, with Sickeneſſe, griefe and payne:
                  To miniſter and giue reliefe: her Hart was euer fayne.
                  The Poore haue loſt a Nurſe, to helpe their nedie ſtate:
                  The Ritche ſhall want a perfecte Frende: as they can well relate.
                  Thus Ritche and Poore ſhall want, her Aide at euerie neede,
                  For both Eſtates in daunger deepe: ſhe laboured to feede.
                  The Ritche with Counſelles ſwete, to cheariſh ſtyll ſhe thought:
                  The Poore by Almes and lyberall Giftes: to tender longe ſhe ſought.
                  But who ſhall haue the greateſt loſſe: I knowe is not vnknowen,
                  Her beſt beloued: the Wight whom ſhee, accompted for her owne.
                  The Lorde MAIOR whiche nowe doth rule: in LONDON noble Citie:
                  Shall want her ſight, (the greater griefe, to miſſe a Mate ſo wittie
                  A Phenyx rare, a Turtell true, ſo conſtant in her loue:
                  That Nature nedes muſt ſhowe her Force, her Huſbandes Teares to moue
                  Who for the loſſe of ſuche a Wyfe: can ſobbyng Sighes refrayne?
                  In whom ſo many Vertues dyd, continue and remayne.
                  You Damſelles deare Domeſticall, whiche in her Houſe abyde:
                  Haue cauſe to wayle, for you haue loſt a good and godly Guide.
                  Whoſe Lenytie and gentell Hart, you all haue knowen and felt:
                  For vnto you in Courteous ſorte, her Giftes ſhe euer dealt.
                  You Officers that dayly ſerue, her Lorde at euery neede:
                  Can teſtifie that you haue loſt, a Ladie kynde in deede.
                  So gentell, graue, demure and wiſe: as ye your ſelues expreſſe:
                  That needes ye muſt guſh foorth your Teares: and weepe with bytterneſſe
                  In fyne, both Ritche and Poore, haue iuſt cauſe giuen to wayle:
                  The Ritch in Counſell lacke a Frende, the Poore their Comfort fayle.
                  The Troupe of maryed Dames, whiche ſhall her Vertues knowe:
                  Haue offered cauſe, in bytter Teares, ſome tyme for to beſtowe.
                  But ſith it is the Goddes Decree, to whom all Fleſh muſt bende:
                  To take this Ladie from the earth, and bringe her dayes to ende.
                  Who can withholde that they wyll haue? who dare their wyll withſtande?
                  To vayne it were for mortall men, the cauſe to take in hande
                  Her Vertues were ſo great, that they haue thought it meete:
                  To take from hence vnto the Heauens, her Chriſtall Soule ſo ſweete.
                  Which now incloſed is, with Aungelles rownde aboute:
                  Suche hoape we haue, no other cauſe, is giuen vs for to doubt.
                  Her Corps ſhall ſhrowde in Claye, the Earth her right doth craue:
                  This Ladie yeldes her Parent too: her Tombe, her Cell and Graue.
                  From whence, no Kynge nor Keyſar can, nor Ruler bearynge ſwaye:
                  For all their Force and Puiſſaunce, once ſtarte or go awaye.
                  All Fleſſhe ſhall haue an ende: as Goddes do graunt and wyll:
                  And reape rewarde as they deſerue, hap good, or hap it yll.
                  But thoughe that Death haue done his worſte, this Dame to take awaye:
                  In ſpite of Death, her Vertues ſhall endure and laſt for aye.
                  ¶ Farewell (O Ladye Deare) the Heauens haue choſen thee
                  Receyue this VALE, I haue done: thou getteſt no more of mee.
                  Poſt Funera viuit virtus.
                  Quoth Iohn Phillip.
