            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

at Mawe, to be obſerued in fulfilling the
due orders of the Game.
               
               1. IF you chaunge hands, it is the loſſe of the Set,
               2. If you renounce, it is the loſſe of the Set.
               3. If you leade when your Mate ſhoulde, it is the loſſe of
that game and vied cardes.
               4. If you loſe dealing, it is the loſſe of fower cardes, but if the loſer of
the dealing deale not againe, you acquite the fower, and no gaine
to either of both parties.
               5. If you looke either on ye aſked carde, or the bottome carde, it is the
loſſe of that game and vied cardes, in whom the fault is found.
               6. If you roub (not hauing the Ace) you loſe fower, &amp; al the vied cards
although you lay downe the ſame carde which you tooke vp.
               7. If you make out the carde when your Mate rubbeth it is the loſſe
of fower, for the roubber muſt make out the carde himſelfe.
               8. If you turne vp the Ace of Hartes you gaine fower thereby.
               9. If you turne vp the Ace of Hartes, and thereby make either partie
aboue xxvi. the contrary part muſt haue Liuings, but if the contrary
parte bee xxv. by meanes whereof Liuings ſets them out,
then is he who turned vp the Ace of Hartes to make for the Set,
ſo that he make not one Game nor the firſt Tricke, without the
conſent of both parties.
               10. The partie that aſketh a carde, may not vie any carde, before the
firſt tricke be played.
               11. You may not vie it after your card is led, but the cōtrary part may.
               12. Three cardes croſſed, no carde by any meanes giuen backe.
               13. Neither partie may giue backe his owne vied card, though none be
croſſed.
               14. You may not aſke a carde to ſet the contrary parte or your ſelfe at
Liuings or out.
               15. Prouided alwaies, that if the contrary parte bee xxiii. or aboue, by
reaſon that fower ſets the other partie behinde the Liuinges, it
ſhalbe lawfull for the partie which is behinde to aſke a carde, although
the carde ſo aſked put the other to Liuings.
               16. Prouided alſo that if you meane to lead a helpe, you may vie it vpon
your owne aſked carde, ſo as it be done before the helpe be out of
your hand, the contrary part may pledge you a card after he ſeeth
your helpe vpon the boord, ſo as it be done before his owne card
be played.
