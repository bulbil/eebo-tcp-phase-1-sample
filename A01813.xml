            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

A BRIEFE TREATISE TOVching the preſervation of the eie-ſight, conſiſting partly in good order of diet, and partly in vſe of medicines. The ſixte Edition.

               Occaſioned thorough certain ſpeeches had with ſome of mine Honourable good friendes, to write mine opinion of meanes to preſerue the ſighte in good integrity, I haue performed the ſame in this little pamphlet, wherein I haue directed my pen rather to leaue rules for thoſe, vvhich haue not in themſelues ſufficient knowledge, thē to ſatisfie the learned: vvho I knowe can deviſe much better meanes &amp; remedies. And my intent beeing only to ſet downe

ſome order, as may be fitteſt for all ſortes of men to continue in perfection their ſighte, I thought not good to inſert any diſcourſe of the diſeaſes of the eies, which will require a long treatiſe, and cannot well be executed, but by men which haue skill in the arte of phyſicke. Therefore it ſeemed meete vnto me at this time to omit that part, and to leaue the reader for the knowledge &amp; cure of ſuch diſeaſes to the profeſſors thereof, by whoſe helpes they may receiue remedy of all infirmities and affectes, vvhich ſhall happen to the eies: purpoſing in this little treatiſe onely to declare, how the ſight might bee

long continued in his integrity, by ſuch common order as may of all men in their trade of life bee reaſonably followed, leaving all other harder matters to a farther direction of the learned And now following the laudable cuſtome begun in ancient time, and continued in theſe our daies of preſenting friendes with new-yeares gifts, for lacke of other things of greater price, I offer vnto you this little pamphlet, as a ſignification of my good wil, wiſhing that the ſame may be a tokē of many good &amp; proſperous yeares, which God the giver of all goodnes, ſend vnto you.
         
      
      
         
            
            
            A breefe Treatiſe concerning the preſervation of the eie ſight.
            
            
               THe preſeruation of the ſight doth cō
               ſiſt, partly in good order of diet, partly in vſe of medicines.
            Concerning diet: Diet ſome thinges hurtful are to be eſchued, &amp; ſome things comfortable to the ſight are to be vſed: wherefore they, which may choſe their habitations, in this reſpect, may make election of aire cleare, declining to Aire moderate heate &amp; dryneſſe: cold &amp; moyſt aire, &amp; thicke, miſty, and rayny weather is hurtfull: it is beſt therefore to abide in drie places, frō moory, mariſh, &amp; watriſh groūds &amp; ſpecially to provide, that the ſite of the dwelling be not betweene the wet places and the ſun: ſoutherne windes do hurt the Windes. Duſt Smoke. Meates. ſight: ſo do low roomes: places full of duſt and ſmoakie are noyſome.
            Meates are beſt which are eaſie to bee digeſted, &amp; which doe not ſtay long in the

ſtomacke: amongeſt ſuch a young henne is greatly commended: ſo is Partridge and Pheaſant, Raſis praiſeth the young ſtarue, &amp; the quaile: ſo doe all writers the Doue both tame and wyld, but chiefly the wyld Doue, which (as Zoar writeth) hath eſpeciall vertue againſt the weakeneſſe of the ſight, which commeth by defect of ſpirites, and the rather, if the ſame be ſod with rape rootes, and turnep rootes: for it is accorded by all writers, that the turnep hath greate facultie to doe good to the eies, and to preſerue the ſight. Groſſe and ſlimy meates, and all water-foule are diſpraiſed. Of ſmall birdes, the martin, the ſwallow, the iay and pie, the witwall, the ſpecht are noted very hurtfull to the ſight: and albeit theſe birds are ſeldome, or not at all vſed of the better ſort, yet common people happyly may be compelled to eate them. No fiſh is accompted good: yet ſome fiſhes, which doe Fiſh. skoure in grauely places, being ſauery ſodden with white wine, fenel, eiebright, ſage, perſl

            Of ſauces, veriuice, viniger of wine, and Sauces. the iuice of limonds, are accompted beſt; Pomgranats, not ſo good.
            Of ſpices, cinnamon is commended by Spices. 
               Avicenna, as ſpeciall good for the webbe of the eie, and for dimneſſe of the ſight: ſo is ſaffron; ginger, both inwardly taken, and outwardly applyed, doth ſingularly cleare the ſight: cloues, mace, and nutmegs, and all three kindes of peppers, may bee vſed. Suger is convenient to condite things, but Suger. Honie. Oile Butter. honie is better: no oile is good, ſaue pile oliue called ſallet oile, and that is better thē butter.

for ſallets are commended, except fenell, eie-bright, young ſage, terragone, which are very good: yet theſe are to be avoided as moſt hurtfull, namely lettis, coleworts, cabbages, beets, ſpinage, purſlane, buddes of dill, garlike, chibbols, onions, skallions, &amp;c. Capers may be eaten: Oliues not ſo good: radiſh rootes, perſnep rootes, are Capers. Oliues Rootes. greatly diſpraiſed: carrot rootes, the buds of aſperage may bee eaten, but the turnup or rape roote, and the navew roote are aboue The Rape &amp; Turnep. all other noted for excellencie to preſerue the ſight, and to that purpoſe many doe preſerue with ſugar theſe rootes, &amp; eate them as ſucket.
            The moſt kindes of fruits are hurtfull to the ſight: yet peares and the better kindes Fruites. Peares. Apples. of apples, may bee eaten with the powder of eiebright, or with fenell ſeeds thinly incruſted with fine ſugar: figs are very good, not only for the ſight, but alſo to open, Figges. ſcoure, and to clenſe the breſt, liuer, ſtomacke and kidneies: ſo are raiſons, which Raiſons. haue a ſpeciall propertie to ſtrengthen the liuer: nuts are very evil, for that they do fill Nuts. the head: the walnut more tollerable then the haſell nut, cheſtnuts are very windie,

better friendes for Venus, then for the eies: dates are not commended, nor mulberies. Dates Confects.
            
            Cōfectes made with fine ſugar &amp; thinly incruſted about with turnep ſeedes, &amp; navew ſeeds, fenil ſeeds, aniſe ſeeds almonds, pine aple kernels, ginger, cinamon, the powder of eiebright, &amp;c. are reputed as very good meanes to continue the ſight: likewiſe in the preſervation of the ſight, amongſt other things, ſuch drinkes, as are in common vſe and accuſtomed, are to be allowed: Drinkes. therfore he that hath vſed to drink beer, may not forſake the ſame &amp; ſo of ale. Beere.
            
            And in this reſpect it is not amis at meat to drinke wine, for them which haue been Wine. accuſtomed to the ſame: although wine in ſome affectes of the eies is forbidden, yet to preſerue the ſighte, wine is not inconvenient, for the vapours of wine are drying, cleare abſterſiue, &amp; ſo do conſume and extenuate groſſe and thick humours, ſo it bee moderately takē. In this place I do greatly commend their counſels, which do prepare medicinable drinkes with eiebright, Medicinal drinkes. &amp; other thinges comfortable for the ſight, to be vſed in the morning, and at meates, if the pacient can well endure ſo to drinke

the ſame: our authors herein are very ingenious, ſome addreſſing drinkes vvith one thing, and ſome with another.
            The ſimpleſt and moſt vvritten of, is Drinke made with ciebright. vvith the herbe called of the Arabians Adhill, in Latine Euphragia, in Engliſh Eiebright, of vvhoſe miraculous vertues in preſervation of the ſight: Arnoldus de villa 
               Arnoldus de villa noua. 
               noua hath vvritten in theſe vvordes: Eie-bright is good any vvay taken, either with meat, drinke or medicine, greene and dry, The praiſe of eie-bright for the ſight. againſt all impediments of the ſight, wherby the clearenes of the ſame may be obſcured. And hee vvriteth thus of vvine made vvith eiebright, vvhich hee calleth Uinum 
               Eiebright VVine. 
               euphragiatum This vvine (ſaith he) is made by putting the herbe in the muſte or newe vvine, vntill the ſame wine become cleare to be dronke. By the vſe of this wine, olde mens ſightes are made young, it taketh away the impedimentes of the ſight in all men, of all ages, eſpecially in fat men, and ſuch, which do abound with phlegme.
            One (ſaith he) which was blind, and did ſee nothing in long time, by vſing this wine one yeare, vvas reſtored to his fight. The herbe is hot and drie, and hath by propertie

of ſubſtance, to remove affectes of the ſight. And ſo the powder of the herbe taken Eiebright taken in an egge. in an egge, or dronken in wine, doth vvonderfully performe the ſame. And there are yet aliue (ſaith he) vvitneſſes of good credite, vvhich haue made proofe heereof in themſelues, vvhich could not reade vvithout ſpectacles, by vſe heereof haue recovered their ſight to reade ſmall letters. And ſo Arnoldus concludeth, that nothing to doe good to the ſight, is to bee compared with wine made with eiebrright. If the wine be too ſtrong, hee counſelleth to alay the ſame vvith fenell water, and to that intention, you may alſo adde ſugar.
            In countries vvhich for their common drinkes do vſe wine and water, they alway do mingle things for the ſight in wine, and not in water: for wine in truth is a fitter liquor to receiue the qualities and to carie the ſame to the eies, then water: vvhich thinges they do put in the muſte, and ſo let it ſtand, vntill the wine be ripe, and ready Eiebrigh may bee vſed in beere, in ale, or meade. to be dronken, and ſo doe vſe it.
            Notvvithſtanding in other countries vvhich haue other vſuall drinkes, the ſame things may be put in their common drinks.

So ſome haue put them in ale, ſome in beere, and ſome in meade, and no doubt but all theſe meanes are very good according to the vſage and diſpoſition of the partie. So even in this our countrie, they which either by vſe or by conſtitution of body, may wel beare the drinking of wine, may well compound the ſame with things good for the ſight: others of hot complexions and drie, not greatly accuſtomed to wine, may of ale, beere, and meade make ſuch drinkes, becauſe in the North countries, ale and beere are the vſuall and common drinkes, and in ſome places, meade alſo is much vſed: therefore in mine opinion it is convenient for moſt men, to make theſe drinkes with ale, beere, and meade, rather then with wine: and meade aſſuredly is a very convenient thinge for them which can well away with hony.
            Touching the direction of thoſe which How eie-bright wine may be vſed haue bin accuſtomed to drinke wine, I do nothing doubt, but that they may without offence beare ſuch drinks for the ſight, compounded with wine, to take a draught in the morning, eſpecially if they alay the ſame with the diſtilled water of fenell, according

to Arnoldus counſell. And for this purpoſe, choyſe may bee made of verie good white wine, and the thinges may be mingled in the countries where the wine doth growe, notwithſtanding in that our The vſe of eiebright ale, and of eiebright beere. moſt vſed drinke with meat is ale, or beere, theſe are very convenient to receiue theſe thinges for the ſight, and abſolutely better then wine, if yee like to drinke the ſame with meate: as our authors doe counſell. Which ale I thinke better to be made with Ale made with grout. grout according to the olde order of brewing. And ſo the thinges for the ſight may be ſodden in the grout, or other way put How to make eie-bright ale and beere. in the drinke, when it is newly clenſed, &amp; put into the veſſell in vvhich ſit is tunned to be kept, that in the working of the drink in the veſſell, the vertues and qualities of the thinges may bee drawen and receiued into the ſame. VVhen theſe thinges are Eiebright meade. compounded in meade, then the ſame are ſodden with the honie, in ſuch order as other herbes are ſodden, when they make methegline.
            I thinke it beſt to begin with the ſimpleſt order to compound ale or beere to ech mans beſt liking with eiebright onely,

taking to every gallon of the drink a great handfull of the herbe, and bind it togither, The quantitie of eie-bright to the drinke or put it in raw and thinne tinſell of ſilke, and ſo tie the ſame by a ſtring to the tap of the veſſell, that the herbe may hang in the middeſt of the drinke, not too low in the grownd, neither to high in the barme, being put into the drinke vvhen it is nevvlie clenſed: let all vvorke togither vntill the drinke be cleare and ripe, to bee dronken according to the common vſe, and then ye may drinke of it at pleaſure in the morning faſting, and at meate alſo if you will, and can vvell like thereof; and moſt men may like to drinke it, becauſe this herbe doeth yeelde no vngratefull taſte, but rather with a pleaſant ſapour doth commende the drinke. It were not amiſſe to avoide windines, to every handfull of the herbe, to adde two drammes of fenell ſeeds, well Fenell ſeedes. duſted, and a little bruiſed. As I do put this for more proportion to beginne vvith-all, that the ſtomacke be not at the firſt offended with the ſtrangenes: So after a time, yee may increaſe the quantitie, and put to every gallon of the drinke, tvvo handfuls of the herbe, vvherein yee may beſt be directed

by the taſte, that the herbe ſhall yeelde into the drinke. In the winter ſeaſon Spices may be added. yee may alſo adde ſome ſpices, as ginger, vvhole mace, a few cloues, nutmegs, cinnamon, and make as it were bragget ale: vvhich drinke beſides that it doth preſerue and cleere the ſight, will alſo helpe digeſtion, clenſe and cut phlegme, and breake winde.
            I can witnes, that many by this ſimple The effect confirmed by examples. compoſition of eiebright and fenell ſeeds, haue found great good for their ſight, not onelie to continue in good eſtate, but alſo that ſome haue found remedie againſt the dimnes &amp; other impediments, growing in their ſight. In truth once I met an old man in Shropſhire called M. Hoorde, aboue the age of 84. yeares, who had at that time perfit ſight, and did read ſmall letters very wel without ſpectacles: he tolde me that about the age of 40. yeares, finding his ſighte to decay, he did vſe eiebright in ale for his drinke and did alſo eare the powder thereof in an egge three daies in a weeke, being ſo taught of his father, who by the like order continued his ſight in good integrity to a very long age. I haue heard the ſame

confirmed by many old mē. Rowland Sherlooke an Iriſh man, Phiſition to Queene Marie, did affirme for trueth, that a Biſhop in Ireland perceiuing his ſight to wax dimme, about his age of fifty yeares, by the vſe of eiebright takē in powder in an egge, did liue to the age of 80 yeares, with good integrity of ſight.
            VVe do reade of many prinkes to preſerue Drinkes more compounded for the ſight. the ſight, compounded not of eie-bright onely, but many moe thinges added: ſo ſome put to it ſage, ſome veruaine ſome celendine, and fenell ſeedes, aniſe feeds, &amp; the forenamed ſpices: others elecampane rootes, iris, galengale &amp; cubebs, and in truth all theſe are greatly commended to preſerue the ſight, and may very aptly be put in drinkes for the ſight: notwithſtanding, for that we are now to deliver a drinke for the ſight, which may bee pleaſing, and allowed with meates, mine opinion is, that the ſame ought to be made as ſimple as may be. For if Gallen in his 6. booke de ſanitate tuenda, doth preferre the compoſition of the medicine termed diatrio
