            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            A TRVE DISCOVRSE of the present estate of Virginia, and the successe of the affaires there till the 18 of Iune. 1614.

conuersion of those Infidels, and the honour of our King and country (which by right may claime at the least their superfluities, from those whom God hath in this world made his dispensors and purse-bearers) might be a sufficient spurre to resolued Christians, especially the state and condition of our collonie, so standing when I left it, and I assure my selfe in this time growne more mature, that an honest hart would euen relent, and mourne to thinke how poorely, I dare not say vnworthily it is prosecuted. It being true that now after fiue yeeres intestine warre with the reuengefull implacable Indians, a firme peace (not againe easily to be broken) hath bin lately concluded, not onely with the nighbour, and bordering Indidians, as on Pataomecke, Topahanah, and other Riuers, but euen with that subtill old reuengefull Powhatan and all the people vnder his subiection, for all whom Powhatan himselfe stands firmely ingaged, by which meanes we shall not onely be furnished with what commodities their countrie yeeldeth, and haue all the helpes they may afforde vsin our indeuours (as they are easily taught, and may by lenitie and faire vsage, as Sir Thomas Dale now principall commander there, and most worthy the honour he houlds, is well experienced in their dispositions, and accordingly makes vse of them) be brought, being naturally though ingenious, yet idlely giuē, to be no lesse industrious, nay to exceede our English, especially those which we hitherto and as yet are furnished with, who for the most part no more sensible then beasts, would rather starue in idlenesse (witnesse their former proceedings) then feast in labour, did not the law compell them thereunto, but also which will be most for our benefit, our owne men may without hazard, I might say with security (by selfe-experience) follow their feuerall labours, whereby twentie shall now

bee able to performe more then heretofore hath bin fortie.

and then it should be at his choice, whether he would establish peace, or continue enemies with vs. This answere as it seemed, pleased him not very wel, for we heard no more from him till in March last, when with Captaine Argalls Shippe, and some other Vessells belonging to the Colony, Sir Thomas Dale with an hundred and fifty men well appointed, went vp into his owne Riuer, where his chiefest habitations were, and carried with vs his daughter, either to moue them to fight for her, if such were their courage and boldnesse, as hath been reported, or to restore the residue of our demands, which were our peeces, swords, tooles. Some of the same men which he returned (as they promised) ran to him again, and because he had put vs to the trouble to fetch them fiue hundred bushels of Corne: A great brauado all the way as we went vp the Riuer they made, demaunding the cause of our comming thither, which wee tould them was to deliuer Pocahuntas, whom purposely we had brought with vs, and to receiue our Armes, men, &amp; corn, or else to fight with them, burn their howses, take away their Canoas, breake downe their fishing Weares, and doe, them what other damages we could: Some of them to set a good face on the matter, replied, that if wee came to fight with them? we were welcome, for they were prouided for vs, councelling vs rather to retire (if wee loued our safeties) then proceed, bragging, as well they might, that wee had euer had the worst of them in that Riuer, instancing by Capt: Ratliefe (not worthy remembring, but to his dishonor) who, with most of his company they betrayed and murthered: we told them since they durst remember vs of that mischief, vnlesse they made the better and more speedy agreement, we would now reuenge that trechery, and with this discourse by the way as we went, we proceeded,

Captaine Argall tould them, that now since they had intreated peace and promised their loue and friendship, hee was sent vnto them from the great Weroance to conclude the same, all former iniuries on both sides, set apart and forgotten, which he would doe vpon these conditions.

            Thirdly, they should at all times be ready and willing to furnish vs with three or foure hundred bowmen to aide vs against the Spaniards, whose name is odious amongst them, for Powhatans father was driuen by them from the west-Indies into those parts, or against any other Indians which should, contrary to the established peace of

            If I knew yet any further impediments which might seeme to giue discouragement to aduenture thither, I should as easily remoue them.
            Obiect that pleaseth the want of cloathes, so long as there are wilde beasts there, and the beasts haue skinnes on their backes (if the necessity were such) why should not we as doe the naturals, cloath our

selues therewith, it is no worse then our fore-fathers haue worne before vs, and such as will saue vs from the colde in winter, and heate in summer: but admit there▪ were no skinnes or being there, our people disdaine to weare them. If there be any man that hath beene so ill an husband here that he cannot furnish himselfe with a yeeres prouision of apparrell; if I might counsell he should not be suffered to goe thither, for that country is not for him, as for others who can prouide apparrell for the first yeere, I holde him a worse husband then the former, that shall at any time after be worse cloathed then he went ouer: the valuable commoditie of Tobacco of such esteeme in England (if there were nothing else) which euery man may plant, and with the least part of his labour, tend and care will returne him both cloathes and other necessaries. For the goodnesse whereof, answerable to west-Indie Trinidado or Craeus (admit there hath no such bin returned) let no man doubt. Into the discourse wherof, since I am obuiously entred, I may not forget the gentleman, worthie of much commendations, which first tooke the pains to to make triall thereof, his name Mr Iohn Rolfe, Anno Domini 1612. partly for the loue he hath a long time borne vnto it, and partly to raise commodity to the aduenturers, in whose behalfe I witnesse and vouchsafe to holde my testimony in beleef

to his knowledge in the end of my treatise to insert the true coppie of his letter, written to Sir Thomas Dale to acquaint him with his proceedings, and purpose therein, the rather to giue testimony to the misconstruing and ill censuring multitude of his integritie, in the vndertaking a matter of so great a consequent, who in my hearing haue not spared to speak their pleasures; his owne letter hits them home, and the better sort, who know to censure iudiciously cannot but highly commend and approue so worthy an vndertaking.
            Thus farre I haue applied my selfe to incourage personall Aduenturers: I would gladly now by worthy motiues, allure the heauie vndertakers to persist with alacritie and cheerefulnesse, both for their owne reputations, the honour of God, and their King and Country. The worthier sort, J meane those Nobles and others of that honourable counsell interessed therein, neede no spurre, their owne innate vertues driues them a pace. The Merchant onely wants some feeling and present returne of those commodities which he is perswaded the country affordeth: to them therefore I will addresse my speech, and if I may perswade them to be constant in their proceedings some small time longer, the benefit will be the greater and the more welcome when it commeth.
            It is not for nothing Sir Thomas Dale, so noblie without respect to his liuing, to his Lady here in England, past the prefixed time of his resolued returne, yet remaineth there; I am sure if he pleased he might returne with as much honour as any man from thence, I say not more.
            I shall little neede, and indeede it were but wast and Idle for me to repeate and mention the commodities, which with onely labour may bee there procured: many Treatises hath them at full. Samples

haue beene sent home, and no man disputeth the goodnes, or the quantitie there to be had: take therefore double courage to yourselues, and let these two yeeres neglect be restored by a cheerefull and new onset, and for your incouragement reade yet a little further, and view the face of the Colony, euen superficially portraide: see what effects these three ye

            In May 1611 Sir Thomas Dale, with a prosperous passage, not full eight weekes arriued there, with him about three hundred people, such as for the present speede, and dispatch could then be prouided, of worse condition then those formerly there, who I sorrow to speake it, were not so prouident, though once before bitten with hunger and pennury, as to put corne into the gound for their winters bread, but trusted to the store, then furnished but with eight months prouisiō. His first care therfore was to imploy al hands about se

            This businesse taken order for, and the care and trust of it committed to his vnder officers, to Iames Towne he hastened, where the most company were, and their daily and vsuall workes, bowling in the streetes, these he imployed about necessary workes, as felling of Timber, repairing their houses ready to fall vpon their heads, and prouiding pales, post and railes to impaile his pu

               posed new Towne, which by reason of his ignorance in those parts, but newly arriued there, he had not resolued where to seate. For his better knowledge therefore of those parts, himselfe with an hundreth men, spent some time in discouery, first Nansamund Riuer, which in dispight of the Indians, then our enemies, he discouered to the

head, after that, our owne Riuer, to the fals, wherevpon a high land inuironed with the mayn Riuer, som sixteene or twentie miles, from the head of the Fals, neere to an Indian Towne called Arsahattocke, he resolued to plant his new Towne, and so did, whereof in his due place I shall make a briefe relation.
            It was no meane trouble to him, to reduce his people, so timely to good order, being of so il a condition as may well witnesse his seuere and strict imprinted booke of Articles, then needefull with all seuerity and extremity to be executed, now much mitigated, for more deserued death in those daies, then do now the least punishment, so as if the law should not haue restrained by execution, I see not how the vtter subuersion and ruine of the Colony should haue bin preuented, witnesse Webbes and Prises designe the first yeere, since that Abbots and others more daungerous then the former, and euen this summer, Coles and Kitchins Plot, with three more, bending their course towards the Southward, to a Spanish Plantation, reported to be there, who had trauelled (it being now a time of peace) some fiue daies iorney to Ocanahoe

                  , there cut off by certaine Indians, hired by vs to hunt them home to receiue their deserts. So as Sir Thomas Dale hath not bin tyranous, nor seuere at all; Indeede the offences haue bin capitall, and the offenders dangerous, incurable members, for no vse so fit as to make examples to others, but the manner of their death may some obiect, hath bin cruell, vnusuall and barbarous, which indeede they haue not bin, witnesse France, and other Countries for lesse offences: what if they haue bin more seuere then vsuall in England, there was iust cause for it, we were rather to haue regard to those whom we would haue terrified, and made fearefull to commit the like offences, then to the offenders iustly condemned, It being

amongst those people (who for the most part are sencible onely of the bodies torment) the feare of a cruell, painefull and vnusuall, death, more restrains them then death it selfe.
            Thus much obuiously, I proceede in his indeuours vntill Sir Thomas Gates his happie arriuall, which was onely in preparing timber, pales, posts and railes for the present impaling this new Towne to secure himselfe and men from the mallice and trechery of the Indians, in the midst and hart of whom, he was resolued to set downe, but before he could make himselfe ready for that businesse, Sir Thomas Gates though his passage more long then vsuall, to second him herein, happily arriued about the second of August, with sixe good Shippes, men, prouisions and cattle, whom as yet not fully discouered, we supposed to be a Spanish fleete, thus induced the rather to beleeue, because in company with him were three Caruals, vessels which neuer before had bin sent thither, and now onely for the transportation of the Cattle. It did mee much good, and gaue great courage to the whole company to see the resolution of Sir Thomas Dale, now wholy busied (our land fortifications to weake to withstand a forraigne Enemy) in lading our prouisions aboard the two good Shippes, the Starre and Prosperous, and our own Deliuerance, then riding before Iames town, aboarde which Shippes, he had resolued to encounter the supposed Enemy, animating his people, not onely with the hope of victory if they readily obeied his direction, but also assuring them that if by these meanes God had ordained to set a period to their liues, they could neuer be sacrificed in a more acceptable seruice, himselfe promising, rather to fire the Spanish Shippes with his owne, then either basely to yeelde, or to be taken: and in nothing he seemed so much discontent as that we could not possibly lade aboarde

all our prouisions before (the winde being then very faire) they might haue bin with vs, whilest therefore the rest were labouring their vtmost to lade aboarde our prouisions, hee caused a small shallop to be manned with thirty readie and good shot to discouer directly what Shippes they might be, and withall speede to returne him certaine word, which within three houres they did, assuring him that is was an English

            The worthies being met, after salutation and welcome giuen, and receiued, Sir Thomas Dale acquainted Sir Thomas Gates both with such businesses as he had affected since his arriuall, and also of his resolution to builde a new Towne, at the Fales, which designe and purpose of his, Sir Thomas Gates then principall Gouernour in Virginia, well approuing, furnished him with three hundred and fiftie men, such as himselfe made choise of, and the beginning of September 1611 he set from Iames town, and in a day &amp; a halfe, landed at a place where he purposed to seate &amp; builde, where he had not bin ten daies before he had very strongly impaled seuen English Acres of ground for a towne, which in honour of the noble Prince Henrie (of euer happie and blessed memory, whose royall heart was euer strongly affected to that action) he called by the name of Henrico. No sooner was he thus fenced, and in a manner secured from the Indians, but his next worke (without respect to his owne health or particular welfare) was building at each corner of the towne, very strong and high commanders or watchtowers, a faire and handsome Church, and storehouses,

which finished he began to thinke vpon conuenient houses, and lodgings for himselfe and men, which with as much speede as was possible, were more strongly and more handsome then any formerly in Virginia, contriued and finished, and euen in foure moneths space, he had made Henrico much better and of more worth then all the worke euer since the Colonie began, therein done.
            I should be to tedious if I should giue vp the accompt of euery daies labour, which therefore I purposly omit, and will onely describe the towne, in the very state and perfection wich I left it, and first for the situation, it stan

            For the further enlargement yet of this Town, on the other side of the Riuer, by impaling likewise: for we make no other fence, is secured to our vse, especially

In this Plantation next to Sir Thomas Dale is principal, in the Commaund, Captaine Georg Yardley, Sir Thomas Gates his lieftenaunt, who se endeauours haue euer deserued worthy commendations in that imployment. Rochdale Hundred by a crosse pale, well nigh foure miles long, is also already impaled, with bordering houses all along the pale, in which Hundred our hogges, and other cattell haue twenty miles circuit to graze in securely. The vndertaking of the chiefe Citty deferred till their Haruest be in, which once reaped, all hands shall be imployed theron, which Sir Thomas Dale purposeth, and he may with some labour effect his designes, to make an impregnable retreat, against any forraign inuasion, how powrefull so euer.

                was lately establishd the principall Commander.
            
               It hath been our greatest care, and labour hitherto, and yet but these three yeers, the former foure meerely mispent, to compasse these businesses, which being thus setled, and brought to such perfection, as I haue described, now doth the time approch, that commodity may be expected, and if meanes bee sent ouer, will assuredly be returned. What honest spirit, hauing hitherto laboured herein, would at the vpshot (as I may so term it) be discouraged or desist? I hope none, rather more will be animated, (if need require) to put too their helping hands and purses.
            And euen thus I haue shaddowed I hope, without the guilt of tedious, or prolix discourses (as I haue been able) the trne condition (though many circumstances omitted) of Virginia, what may the substance be, when the externall shew is so forward, so glorious.
            I haue purposely omitted the relation of the Contry commodities, which euery former treatise hath abundantly, the hope of the better mines, the more base, as Iron, Allom, and such like, Perfectly discouered, and made triall off, and surely of these things I cannot make so ample relation, as others, who in the discouery of those affaires, haue bin, then my selfe more often conuersant, onely of the hopefull, and marchantable commodities of tobacco, silke grasse, and silke wormes: I dare thus much affirme, and first of Tobacco, whose goodnesse mine own experience and triall induces me to be such, that no country vnder the Sunne, may, or doth affoord more pleasant, sweet, and strong Tobacco, then I haue tasted there, euen of mine owne planting, which, howsoeuer being then the first yeer of our triall thereof, wee had not the knowledge to cure, and make vp, yet are ther some now resident there, out of the last yeers well obserued experience, which both know, and I doubt

            The silke wormes sent thither from England, in seeds the last winter, came foorth many of them the beginning of March, others in Aprill, Maye, and Iune, thousands of them grown to great bignesse, and a spinning, and the rest well thriuing of their increase, and commodity well knowne to be reaped by them, we haue all most assurance (since sure I am) no Country affoordeth more store of Mulbery trees, or a kind with whose leafe they more delight, or thriue better.
            It may be heere happily expected, that I should giue vp the relation of Captaine Argalls particular voyages and indeauours, and euen as in a Plat, demonstrate his Norward discoueries, from which businesse I desire to be excused, partly, because himselfe is best able to make his owne relations, and partly, because my home imployments would not permit me leisure to accompany him, though my selfe desirous, in any of his voyages, whose indeauours, if I should indeauour to make knowne, and publish, could receiue no honour at all by my commendations, or descriptions: much might they be impaired, through my ignorance, or vnskillfullnes to set them foorth: yet cannot I omit to publish to the world, what present reliefe he hath don to the Colony, furnishing

I replied that I knew his greatnesse and power to be such, that if he pleased heerein to gratifie his Brother hee might, restoring the Roanoake without the imputation of Iniustice, take hoame his daughter againe, the rather because she was not full twelue yeeres old, and therefore not marriageable: assuring him beside the band of peace, so much the firmer he should haue treble the prise of his daughter, in beades, Copper, Hatch

You haue euer giuen me encouragements to perseuer in this religious Warfare, vntill your last Letters; not for that you are now lesse well affected thereunto: but because you see the Action to bee in danger by many of their non performances who vnder tooke the businesse. I haue vndertaken, and haue as faithfully, &amp; with all my might indeauored the prosecution with all allacrity, as God that knoweth the heart, can beare me record, what recompence, or what rewards, by whom, or when I know not where to expect; but from him in whose vineyard I labor, whose Church with greedy appetite I desire to erect.

had loued her, he would not value her lesse then olde swords, peeces, or axes: wherefore she would stil dwel with the English men, who loued her. At last came one from Powhatan, who tould vs, that Simons was run away, to Nonsowhaticond, which was a truth, as

                     fterwards appeared, but that the other English man was dead, that proued a lie: for since, Mr. Hamor, whom I employed to Powhatan brought him to me, our peeces, swords, and tooles within fifteen daies, should be sent to Iames towne, with some corne, and that his daughter should be my childe, and euer dwell vvith mee, desiring to be euer friends, and named such of his people, and neighbour Kings, as he desired to be included, and haue the benefit of the peace, promising if any of our men came to him, vvithout leaue from me, he would send them back: and that if any of his men stole from vs, or killed our cattel, he vvould send them to vs to bee punished as vve thought fit. With these conditions we returned, and vvithin the time limited, part of our Arms vvere sent, and 20. men vvith corne, and promised more, vvhich he hath also sent. Opachankano desired I vvould call him friend, and that he might call me so, saying he vvas a great Captaine, and did alwaies fight: that I vvas also a great Captaine, and therefore he loued mee; and that my friends should be his friends. So the bargain vvas made, and euery eight or ten daies, I haue messages and presents from him, vvith many apparances that he much desireth to continue friendshippe.
                  Novv may you iudge Sir, if the God of battailes haue not a helping hand in this, that hauing our

swords dravvn, killing their men, burning their houses, and taking their corne▪ yet they tendred vs peace, and striue vvith all allacrity to keep vs in good oppinion of them; by vvhich many benefits arise vnto vs. First, part of our Armes, disgracefully lost long agoe, (kept by the Sauages as Monuments and Trophies of our shames) redeliuered, some repaire to our honor. Our catle to increase, without danger of destroying, our men at liberty, to hunt freely for venison, to fish, to doe any thing else, or goe any vvhither, without danger; to follovv the husbanding of their corne securely, vvhereof vve haue aboue fiue hundred Acres set, and God be praised, in more forwardnesse, then any of the Indians, that I haue seene, or heard off this yeere, roots, and hearbs vve haue in abundanue; all doubt of want is by Gods blessing quite vanished, and much plenty expected. And vvhich is not the least materiall, vve may by this peace, come to discouer the countrey better, both by our own trauells, and by the relation of the Sauages, as vve grovv infamiliarity vvith them,
                  
                     Powhatans daughter I caused to be carefully instructed in Christian Religion, vvho after shee had made some good progresse therein, renounced publickly her countrey Idolatry, openly confessed her Christian faith, vvas, as she desired, baptised, and is since married to an English Gentleman of good vnderstanding, (as by his letter vnto me, coutaining the reasons for his marriage of her you may perceiue) an other knot to binde this peace the stronger. Her Father and friends gaue approbation to it, and her Vncle gaue

her to him in the Church: she liues ciuilly and louingly with him and I trust will increase in goodnesse, as the knowledge of God increaseth in her. She will goe into England with me, and were it but the gayning of this one soule, I will thinke my time, toile, and present stay vvell spent.

                        To my verie deere and louing Cosen M. G. Minister of the B. F. in London.
                     
                  
                  SIr the Colony here is much better. Sir Thomas Dale our religious and valiant Geuernour, hath now brought that to passe, which neuer before could be effected. For by vvarre vpon our enemies, and kinde vsage of our friends, he hath brought them to seeke for peace of vs, vvhich is made, and they dare not breake. But that vvhich is best, one Pocahuntas or Matoa the daughter of Powhatan, is married to an honest and discreete English Gentleman Maister Rolfe, and that after she had openly

renounced her countrey Idolatry, confessed the faith of Iesus Christ, and vvas baptised; vvhich thing Sir Thomas Dale had laboured along time to ground in her.
                  Yet notvvithstanding, are the vertuous deeds of this vvorthy Knight, much debased, by the letters vvhich some vvicked men have vvritten from hence, and especially by one C.
                           •
                        . If you heare any condemne this noble Knight, or doe feare to come hither, for those slaunderous letters, you may vpon my vvord bouldly reproue them. You knovv that no malefactors can abide the face of the Iudge, but themselues scorning to be reproued, doe prosecute vvithall haired; all those that labour their amendment. I maruaile much that any men of honest life, should feare the sword of the magistrate, which is vnsheathed onely in their defence.
                  But I

                      muse, that so fevv of our English Ministers that vvere so hot against the Surplis and subscription: come hither vvhere neither spoken of. Doe they not either vvilfully hide their Tallents, or keepe themselves at home for feare of loosing a fevv pleasures? Be there not any amongst them of Moses his minde, and of the Apostles, that for sooke all to follovv Christ? But I referre them to the Iudge of all hearts, and to the King that shall reward euery one according to the gaine of his Tallent. But you my cosen, holde fast that vvhich you:

here vntill I be lawfully called from hence. And so betaking vs all vnto the mercies of God in Christ Iesus, I rest for euer.

It is a matter of no small moment, concerning my own particular which here I impart vnto you, and vvhich toucheth mee so neerely, as the tendernesse of my saluation. Howbeit I freely subiect my selfe to your graue and mature iudgement, deliberation, approbation and determination; assuring my selfe of your zealous admonitions, and godly comforts, either perswading me to desist, or incouraging me to persist ther in, with a religious feare and godly care, for which (from the very instant, that this began to roote it selfe, vvithin the secret bosome of my brest) my daily and earnest praiers haue bin, still are, and euer shall bee proed

                     Thus when I had thought I had obtained my peace and quietnesse, beholde another, but more gracious tentation hath made breaches into my holiest and strongest meditations; with which I haue bin put to a new triall, in a straighter manner then the former: for besides the many passions and sufferings, vvhich I haue daily, hourely, yea and in my sleepe in

                     ured, euen awaking mee to astonishment, taxing me with remisnesse, and carelesnesse, refusing and neglecting to performe the duetie of a good Christian, pulling me by the eare, and crying: why dost not thou indeuour to make her a Christian? And these haue happened to my greater wonder, euen when she hath bin furthest seperated from me, which in common reason (were it not an vndoubted worke of God) might breede forgetfulnesse of a farre more worthie creature. Besides, I say the holy spirit of God hath often demaunded of me, why I was created? If not for transitory pleasures and worldly vanities, but to labour in the Lords vineyard, there to sow and plant, to nourish and increase the fruites thereof, daily adding with the good husband in the Gospell, somewhat to the tallent, that in the end the fruites may be reaped, to the comfort of the laborer in this life, and his saluation in the world to come?

                     ands, and wilfully despiseth to worke with them. Likewise, adding hereunto her great apparance

                  What should I doe? 
                        •
                     hall I be of so vntoward a disposition, as to refuse to leade the blind into the right way? Shall I be so vnnaturall, as not to giue bread to the hungrie? or vncharitable, as not to couer the naked? Shall I despise to actuate these pious dueties of a Christian? Shall the base feare of displeasing the world, ouerpower and with-holde mee from reucaling vnto man these spirituall workes of the Lord, which in my meditations and praiers, I haue daily made knowne vnto him? God forbid. I assuredly trust hee hath thus delt with me for my eternall felicitie, and for his glorie: and I hope so to be guided by his heauenly grace, that in the end by my faithfull paines, and christianlike labour, I shall atteine to that blessed promise, Pronounced by that holy Prophet Daniell vnto the righteous that bring many vnto the knowledge of God. Namely, that they shall shine like the starres foreuer and euer. A sweeter comfort cannot be to a true Christian, nor a greater incouragement for him to labour all the daies of his life, in the performance thereof, nor a greater game of consolation, to be desired at the hower of death, and in the day of iudgement.

                  Now if the vulgar sort, who square all mens actions by the base rule of their own filthinesse, shall taxe or taunt me in this my godly labour: let them know, it is not any hungry appetite, to gorge my selfe vvith incontinency; sure (if I would, and were so sensually incliued) I might satisfie such desire, though not vvithout a seared conscience, yet vvith Christians more pleasing to the eie, and lesse fearefull in the offence vnlawfully committed. Nor am I in so desperate an estate, that I regard not what becommeth of mee; nor am I out of hope but one day to see my Country, nor so void of friends, nor mean in birth, but there to obtain a mach to my great content:

nor haue I ignorantly passed ouer my hopes there, or regardlesly seek to loose the loue of my friends, by taking this course: I know them all, and haue not rashly ouerslipped any.
                  But shal it please God thus to dispose of me (which I earnestly desire to fullfill my ends before sette down) I vvill heartely accept of it as a goaly taxe appointed me, and I will neuer cease, (God assisting me) vntill I haue accomplished, &amp; brought to perfection so holy a vvorke, in which I vvill daily pray God to blesse me, to mine, and her eternall happines.

               VIrginia therefore standing now in such a goodly proportion, and faire forwardnesse of thriuing, as it was neuer yet hitherto seen in, since it began to be first planted: cannot but soone come to perfection, to the exceeding great comfort of all well affected

Christians, and no small profit of the planters, and aduenturers: if it be well seconded and supplyed, with a good number of able men: Wherefore, let none bee heerafter vnwilling all they may to further this most honourable Action, and be forward to vphold and support it from falling, by their speech, and countenance, and freely aduenturing thither, both in their persons, &amp; also by their purses, as God hath inabled them. To conclude, as Azariah sayd once to King Azah, Iuda, and Beniamin, so say I vnto all. Bee yee strong threfore, and let not your hands be weake: for your worke shall haue a reward. And as the holy Apostle said to the Corinthians, Be ye therefore stedfast, vnmoueable, abundant alwaies in the vvorkes of the Lord, for as much as ye know your labour is not in vaine in the Lord, let vs not therefore bee vvearie of vvelldoing: for in due season, vvee shall reape, if wee faint not as the Apostle tolde the Galatians. Farewell.
