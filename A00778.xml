            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

               O how ſweete are thy words vnto my throte, yea ſweeter than honie vnto my mouth.
            
            AT LONDON, Printed by Thomas Orwin for Thomas Charde. 1588.
         
         
            
            
            TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, HIS VERY ſingular good Lord, Henry Earle of Penbrooke, Lord Harbert of Cardiff, Marnion and S. Quintine, Lord Preſident of Wales and the Marches thereof, and of the moſt Honorable Order of the Garter Knight, and to the Right Honorable and vertuous Ladie the Counteſſe his wife, G.B. wiſheth all mercie and comfort in Chriſt Ieſus, both here now, and for euer.
            
               COnſider the olde generatiōs of mē ye children, ſayd that wiſe Sonne of Sirach (Right Honorable and my very ſingular good Lord) in his tyme, &amp; marke them well.
                  Eccleſiaſt. 2.11.
                VVas there euer any confounded, that put his truſt in the Lord? Or who hath continued

in his feare, and was forſaken? Or whom did he euer deſpiſe, that called vpon him? Agreeably truely to all Scriptures, and experiences euer, if they were ſearched. For ſuch a thing is it to cleaue vnto the Lorde with a faithfull heart, that the Bride may forget to trim her ſelfe the day ſhe is maried, and the mother her Jnfant ſhe bare of her bodie, and eſteemeth full deere, before the Lord of heauen can forget ſuch. The Lorde knoweth the daies of the vpright men, &amp; their inheritance ſhalbe perpetual. They ſhall not be confounded in the perillous tyme,
                  Pſal. 37.
                and in the daies of famine they ſhall haue enough. Though he fall he ſhall not bee caſt

of, for the Lord putteth vnder his hand. The Lord ſhall exalt them, as themſelues ſhall ſee, and their ende, ſayth the Prophet, ſhall bee peace. Thouſands of comforts hath the word mo, &amp; yet theſe are both many and great ones, if we marke thē. Gayne is not godlineſſe, ſaith the Apostle,
                  1. Timoth. 6.4.5. chap. 4.8.
                but godlineſſe is great gayne, and hath the promiſe both of this life &amp; that to come. VVherfore (Right Honorable) more ioye in this, than in all the earth, if it might be your owne. For the earth muſt periſh, and all the glistring glorie of it paſſe away as a tale that is tolde, burnt, and conſumed, &amp; melted with heate, but the feare of the Lord ſhall ſet her ſeruants

before the higheſt, for euer &amp; euer. Now did the Apostle ſay to King Agrippa before ſo many, O King Agrippa J knowe thou beleeueſt? Surely I may ſay it before as many, I knowe (Right Honorable) your L. beleeueth, both Prophets and Apostles, and whatſoeuer the childe of God is bound to beleeue vnto ſaluatiō. I ſay I know it, and yet know I it not alone, but others with me, aſwell as J, attending your L. both in like, and other places. And if we ſhould all denye it, yet would the world ſteppe in and ſay, it knewe what we denied. God haue the glorie, to whō it is due, of his free election manifeſted both to your ſelf and others by a true calling

vnto ſanctification. And it remaineth (Right H.) that with a ſpirit flaming with thankefull loue to ſo gracious a God, you let your light ſhine further &amp; further to a greater glory to the Lord, &amp; a fuller cōfort to your owne ſoule. Performe your ſelfe therefore in all truth of hart, before the iudging eyes of a mightie God ſtill more &amp; more, as you do alreadie, an honorable maintainer and furtherer of his truth. A ſhield and defence to all the godly in their griefes and diſtreſſes. Carefull to haue both your ſelfe and your familie gouerned by the precious and holy word of God, maintayning and countenancing to that end, as moſt honorably

you do, both at home, and abroade, the Lords poore ſeruants appoynted to that miniſterie. Be a rare example ſtil, both worthy honoring and following of carefull beſtowing of thoſe liuings whereof God hath made your Lordſhip Patrone. Multiplie, as the Lord ſhall aſſiſt, thoſe your Honors zealous prayers, which ſome can witneſſe: for the peace of Hieruſalem, that her rightuouſnes may breake forth as the light, &amp; ſaluation as a burning lampe. And ſtil ſay with the Prophet Dauid, we wiſh you good lucke ye that be of the houſe of the Lord. Your Honorable ſeruices for a moſt gracious Soueraine as euer the earth had any, and for your

deere Countrey, let them ſtill, as they are, be moſt ſweete and ioyful to you. In your Honorable place and gouernment carie your zeale as your L. doth, euen more &amp; more agaynſt the incorrigible aduerſaries of Judah and Beniamin, to note their doings, to obſerue their drifts, and to ouerthrowe their plots. Cut off ſtill with your ſword of holy Iuſtice, as with exceeding trauell your Lordſhip moſt honorably doth, thoſe contentions, diſorders, and offences that corruption both breedeth and feedeth ouer much. And finally as the Apostle ſayth, if there be any vertue, if there be any praiſe, to God, or to Prince, to Countrey, or to any,

Right Ho. thinke of that. For ſo ſhall your L. eſtabliſh your ſelfe both in earth and in heauen, both here and for euer. Yea your ſelf &amp; your ſeede, as the former promiſes haue giuen aſſurance. And ſo ſhall you, to your God and your ſelf, &amp; as many as knowe your vertues, ſtand approued euer, whatſoeuer either ignorance or vnkindneſſe may effect in ſome. VVithout this courſe &amp; care in a meaſure as the Lord ſhall giue, well may a worlde continue a while flattring &amp; fauning with many delights, God being patient and forbearing long, but the end is deſtruction, death and confuſion, God being iuſt and paying at laſt. Your ſelf Madame

ſtill more and more, as your Ladiſhip doth, partake with your owne, what your place permitteth in theſe Honorable actions, &amp; make them alſo your owne. Let it ſtill be your honorable iuſt &amp; true praiſe, that you feare the Lord, that you loue his truth, fauour his followers and abhorre his foes. For there is no praiſe ſhall continue as this, there is no wiſedome that may bee compared to it. The feare of God is the beginning of wiſedome, a good vnderstanding haue all they that do thereafter, the praiſe of it indureth for euer. Againe, let this be your wiſedome,
                  Deutro. 4.
                ſayd the Lorde of heauen to that people once, euen to heare my wordes, and to worke

my will with a carefull hart. For then ſhall all Nations ſay, you only are wiſe, and you onely haue knowledge of the beſt courſe. Let it be your Poſie, (Right Honorable) as pleaſant as euer it was: And now Lorde what is my hope,
                  Pſal. 39.
                truely my hope is euen in thee: Though the Lorde ſhould kill mee, yet will I put my truſt in him.
                  Iob. 13.15.
                And let that plaine Prophet ſtrengthen your Ladiſhip ſtill by his words to King Aſa &amp; all Judah: The Lord is with you, while ye be with him, and if you ſeeke him hee will bee found of you,
                  2. Chron. 15.2
                but if you forſake him he will forſake you. The like hath dying Dauid to his deere ſonne to be left behinde him: And

thou Salomon my ſonne, know the God of thy father, and ſerue him,
                  1. Chron. 28.9
                with a perfit hart, and a willing minde. For the Lord ſearcheth all harts, and vnderstandeth all the imaginations of thoughts. Jf thou ſeeke him, he will be found of thee, but if thou forſake him he wil caſt thee away for euer. But what ſpēd J ſpeech, where many giuen graces ſay ſpare thy ſpeech, J know it wel. Then ſtay J ſo, &amp; to you both (Right H.) J adde but this, that as duetie bindeth, and many great and honorable fauours both to me and mine require and charge me, I reſt before my God in praier, that goeth out of vnfained lips, that it may bee thus with your H. both,

thus ſtil I ſay, and thus more, thus more agayne, and thus ſtill, and thus both ſtill &amp; more continually during life. That thoſe wordes of endleſſe comfort may reach vnto you in iudging day: Come ye bleſſed of my father, and poſseſſe eternall ioy. If this poore trauell of mine may auayle any thing to this effect, it is your Honors own, proceeded from your owne, moſt deeply bound for euer to be your owne, and therefore bold to preſent it in this ſort, becauſe he is your owne. It was begun in your Honors hearing, being that part of the Catechiſme that then fell to my courſe, both the lawe and faith hauing bene expounded before, the one by

my ſelfe, the other by my fellowe that followed: &amp; becauſe it could not at that time be gone forwarde withall, J haue ſince, as J could, layd it downe in this ſort, if it pleaſe the Lord for the good of mo. VVho all ſhall welcome it by thus much more (as they did the other) by how much it bringeth countenance from your Honors both vnto them, and is a gift deriued euen from your ſelues vnto them. The Christian Reader els whoſoeuer, I ſhould wrong too much, if I ſhould not comfortably hope, he will accept it well, ſince alreadie he hath ſhewed his loue in the like reſpect. Therefore moſt humbly beſeeching you both (Right Honorable) to

accept my dutie, to weigh my hart, and to pardon my boldneſſe, J beſeech the Lord againe and againe to multiplie his mercies towardes you both, giuing honor here, and honor euer in his happie kingdome of eternal comfort.

            A PROFITABLE EXPOSITION of the Lords Prayer: by way of Queſtions and Anſwers.
            ¶Of Prayer in generalitie.
            
               
                  MAny things are ſpoken by many men of Prayer in generalitie, and gladly would I heare what you think conuenient of the ſame. Yet would I not preſcribe by any queſtions, for feare my want of iudgement in aſking, might procure in you any needleſſe anſwering?
            
            Your care is very good, yet ſpare not to ſpeake, if I omit any thing whereof you would willingly heare. Trueth it is, that much is ſpoken, and much may bee

ſpoken of this matter at large, but a fewe things may ſuffice vs at this time, hauing fuller diſcourſes to goe to when we will.
            
               
                  Praier natural, but to pray rightly, of God, Rom. 16.
               Firſt then let vs conſider, that Prayer hath a foundation euen in our nature as we are men, and is ſo taught vs by the very inſtinct and teſtimonie of reaſon and conſcience, that looke what or whomſoeuer we acknowledge and thinke to bee God, that and the ſame wee alſo willingly confeſſe ought to be prayed vnto. For a perſwaſion of Godhead ſtandeth not without a confeſſion of Prayer done to the ſame. So wee ſee in the 14. Pſalme,
               
                  Verſ. 1.
                where with the deniall of God, which the foole maketh in his hart, is ioyned an vtter want of prayer and inuocation. Contrariwiſe in the 139. Pſal. with the confeſſion of God,
                  Verſ. 9.
                an earneſt, hartie, and often calling vpon his name. So that a neceſſarie conſequence the Spirit of GOD maketh it vppon the confeſſion of a God euen by the inſtinct of nature to vſe prayer to the ſame.
                  Verſ. 13.
                And contrariwiſe if we ſhould neuer pray, then neceſſarily muſt we be euen in the number of thoſe fooles, which ſay in their harts there is no God. Which if it were duely and effectually conſidered

of vs, it would rowze vs aſſuredly out of our dead and damnable negligence in this behalfe, if there were any ſpirite of life and feeling in vs, and cauſe vs to acquaint our ſoules more often and earneſtly with this heauenly exerciſe. Fearing euen with a great feare,
                  Ingratitude to God.
                the vengeance of ingratitude towards God for innumerable benefites,
                  Atheiſme.
                the plagues in hell due to Atheiſts and ſuch as denie GOD, and the ſame amongſt men that of force muſt fall vppon vs, when being men yet we abhorre from the very nature of man.
                  Declination from nature.
                All which three greeuous conditions the want of Prayer forcibly prooueth vpon vs, as now wee ſee. Againe, the Apoſtle Saint Paule in his Epiſtle to the Romanes,
               
                  Rom 2.14.15.
                teaching how the Gentils doing by nature the thinges contayned in the lawe, ſhewe the effect of the lawe written in their harts, is a witneſſe in ſteade of many moe, ſufficient and ſtrong, that to pray to God, being a thing compriſed in the lawe, was then, is now, and euer ſhall bee whilſt man hath mans nature, a thing ingrafted and planted of God in the ſame nature. And many other reaſons might be brought, but theſe ſuffice.
            
               
               
                  Prayer is neceſſary.
               Secondly, let vs conſider the neceſſitie of this Chriſtian exerciſe of Prayer: which wee ſhall euidently ſee, if either we reſpect the Lord, our ſelues, or our brethren. For vnto the Lord wee knowe is due, euer, and eternally,
                  In reſpect of the Lord here.
                here, and in the worlde to come, praiſe and thankſgiuing, &amp; that is Prayer. Praiſe the Lorde all ye people,
               
                  Pſal. 147.148. &amp;c. Pſal. 136.1.2.3. Pſal. 150.6. Pſal. 146.1.
                
               for it is a good thing to ſing praiſes vnto our God. O giue thankes vnto the Lord, for he is gracious. O thanke the Lord of all Lordes, &amp;c. Yea, let euery thing that hath breath praiſe the Lorde. And, as long as I haue any being, I wil ſing praiſes vnto my God. In the world to come, ſee the Scriptures.
                  Apoc. 4.8.
                
               Holy, holy, Lord God almightie, which was, and which is, and which is to come.
               
                  ver. 11.
                
               Thou art worthie O Lord to receiue glory, and honor, &amp; power:
               
                  In the world to come.
                
               for thou haſt created al things, and for thy will ſake they are, and haue bene created. Beſide many other places. Vnto the Lorde is due worſhip and ſeruice of all them that looke for a place in his kingdom:
                  Luke. 1.74.75 Oſe. 14.3.
                of which worſhip and ſeruice, Prayer is a notable part, and therefore neceſſary.
            Vnto the Lorde is due obedience to his

Commaundements, if we bee the Lordes, for they are holy and iuſt. But this is one, that we ſhould pray vnto him: and therfore in reſpect of God Prayer is neceſſary. Call vpon me in the day of trouble,
               
                  Pſal. 50.15.
                
               and I wil heare thee, &amp; thou ſhalt glorifie me, ſaith the Lorde. And in an other place, I haue ſworne by my ſelf, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteouſneſſe, &amp; ſhall not returne, that euery knee ſhall bowe vnto me, &amp;c.
            In reſpect of our ſelues Prayer is neceſſarie,
                  Prayer neceſſary in reſpect of our ſelues.
                if either wee conſider the manifold woes and ſorrowes, which at times ſhall nippe our harts, lying there and euen grating and grinding our inwards to pouder by day and by night, till we haue eaſed our ſelues by Prayer, and powred them into the lappe of the Lorde, with ſuite for comfort and redreſſe, or the infinite neceſſities of this wretched life: which albeit the Lord is mercifull and readie to giue, euen before wee doe aſke, yet good reaſon wee ſhould aſke them, and euer bound to that gracious God, that vpon aſking will vouchſafe to giue them.
                  Pſal. 42.
                What helliſh gripes of wringing woe do we thinke the ſeruant of God

               Dauid felt, when ouer and ouer he mentioneth the ſadneſſe of his ſoule?
                  Chap. 6.
                What Iob, when the arrowes of the Almightie did ſtick in him, the venome wherof did drinke vp his ſpirit, and when the terrors of God did fight againſt him? when he ſhriked out with mournfull voyce, what my ſhrinking hande doth ſhake to pen: O that I might haue my deſire, and that GOD would graunt me the thing that I long for. And what was that? O fearefull! It followeth, that GOD would deſtroy me, that he would let his hand goe, and cut me off. What the perſecuted Prophet,
                  1. Kings 19.
                when hee would ſo gladly dye?
                  Ionas. 2.
                What Ionas in the bellie of hell, as he calleth it? &amp; what thouſands, &amp; ten thouſands of Gods children, euer, &amp; daily, &amp; whileſt the world indureth? And how haue they bene eaſed? doe we not ſee? Euen by throwing themſelues at the feete of the Lord, &amp; powring out by Praier their greeuous complaints into the boſome of their gracious GOD, whoſe eare harkened, whoſe heart pitied, and whoſe hande euer in his good time eaſed their ſhoulders from the burthen, to their comfort. Therefore Prayer in this reſpect wee

ſee moſt neceſſary. For the other, we know the Scriptures alſo:
                  Mat. 7.7.
                
               Aſke (ſaith God) and you ſhall haue. If hauing then be neceſſarie in reſpects of wants, neceſſarie is alſo aſking: that is, praying in reſpect of hauing. So looke we at woes, or looke we at wants, neceſſary in reſpect of our ſelues is Prayer.
            Goe we laſtly to our Brethren,
                  Praier neceſſary in reſpect of our brethren.
                and wee are commaunded to let our light ſhine before them, to their example and confirmation. Of which light this is a notable parte and braunch, our often, zealous, and religious Prayer, and therefore euen in reſpect of them alſo neceſſarie.
            Thirdly, the vtilitie and profite of it would very duely, and earneſtly,
                  Prayer is profitable.
                of Gods children be conſidered: wherein the ſaying may haue fit and proper place.
            
               Aeque pauperibus prodeſt, locupletibus aeque
               Aeque neglectum pueris, ſenibuſ
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   nocebit.
            
            That is:

                  It gayneth good to poore and rich,
                  if vſe thereof be free:
                  And hurteth youth aſwell as age
                  neglected if it bee.
               
            
            
               The Scripture woonderfully layeth downe the benefite of this holy exerciſe, not in one, or two reſpects, but euen in euerie thing, that may befall the childe of God in this life. In afflictions, as partly hath bene ſhewed, it eaſeth the hart; it ſtaieth our ſteps ſtill readie to ſlide into impatience; it perſwadeth the Lord; it winneth his mercy, and bringeth his gotten comfort at time appoynted, to the panting ſoule, all breathleſſe almoſt in the ſcortching heate of ſuch triall, as pleaſeth God to ſend. And therefore pray (ſaith our Sauiour Chriſt) continually,
               
                  Luc. 21.36.
                
               that ye may be coūted worthy to eſcape al theſe things, that ſhal come to paſſe, &amp; that ye may ſtand before the ſonne of man. But what things are they? O reade and conſider that ſingular Chapter, &amp; ſee the fruit of Prayer. Falſe Chriſts ſhall come, and deceiue, to their endleſſe woe,
                  verſ. 8.
                thouſands and thouſands, but pray wee to God againſt this fearefull fall, and wee ſhall eſcape▪ Warres and ſeditions ſhall bee heard of, and ſeene, dreadfull and terrible,
                  9.
                but pray to God and they ſhall not hurt vs, no not once make vs iuſtly afraid. Though it be nation againſt nation,
                  10.
                kingdome

againſt kingdome:
                  11.
                though the earth ſhake, and tremble in diuers places, and we ſee hunger, and peſtilence, and fearefull things, and great ſignes in heauen aboue vs, yet pray wee to GOD our guide and ſtrength, and we ſhall eſcape. If hands be layd vpon vs, perſecuted and taken,
                  12.
                and deliuered vp to the Sinagogues, and Priſons, and brought before Kings and Rulers for the Lord Ieſus ſake, pray wee to the ſame our gracious God, and his word is paſt,
                  13.
                theſe ſhall all turne vnto vs for a teſtimoniall, and not hurt vs. If we want learning, knowledge, or vtterance:
                  14.
                ſo that we feare of a truth any weake defence, pray we to him, that in weakneſſe is ſtrong, and the power he hath promiſed, both of ſpeach and knowledge, ſhall binde the very deuill, that he cannot ſtirre,
                  15.
                and with the head the members, with the Captaine the Souldiours, with their life all the limmes, ſo that not all the kingdome of perdition, if their force could bee ioyned againſt the pooreſt man or woman of vs, that euer ſhall profeſſe Ieſus, ſhall bee able to reſiſt or ſpeake againſt vs. Let our deare Parents that brought vs into this world,
                  16.
                ſeeke by cruell

vyolence in hatred againſt a truth to throw vs out of the ſame againe, and our owne brethren, kinſmen and friends betray vs, and kill vs, if it pleaſe God, wee being hated euen of all men for the Lorde Ieſus ſake,
                  17.
                pray we ſtill ſtedfaſtly vnto our God, and if he bee the Lorde that hath made the heauen and earth, whoſe word is truth, and abideth for euer, there ſhal not one heare of our heads periſh,
                  18.
                
               
                  19.
                but in patience comfortablie we may poſſeſſe our ſoules.
                  20.
                Let Hieruſalem bee beſieged, that is, our natiue land and countrie, our townes and houſes in which we dwell, a token that deſolation is neere:
                  23.
                let the heauie woman ſo great with childe begin to ſigh for her ſelfe, and weepe with woe for her deare birth within her, with ſhiuering ſhrinkes, to thinke of bloudie Speare to ſpit her ſprauling babe vpon, let our nation and people diſobeying the Lord in the time of peace, fall vpon the edge of the ſword, and be caried captiue into all Countries,
                  24.
                and our ſtately Cities, Caſtles and Towers be troden vnto duſt, yea let the Sunne,
                  25.
                and the Moone, and all the Starres of Heauen threaten by their fearefull ſignes, the approching dreadfull

wrath of God to men, trouble and perplexitie bee vpon earth, the Sea and the waters rore, and mens hearts faile them for feare,
                  26.
                looking after thoſe things that ſhall come vpon the worlde, the very powers of heauen being ſhaken, and the Sonne of man appearing in the Cloudes with mightie power and glorie,
                  27·
                yet let vs pray with a chearefull voyce, and ſend out our faith to the Lord of life, as we are euer bidden, and amidſt all theſe feares and terrors, otherwiſe to bee trembled at day and night, wee ſhall haue no cauſe at all to feare, but euen contrariwiſe,
                  28.
                to lift vp our heads towards heauen, as men and women behoulding with eyes their eternall deliuerance, euerlaſting comfort, and vnſpeakable ioy drawing neere vnto them, to remaine with them, and they in it for euer. O prayer then auaileable with GOD, and profitable to men. There needeth no more to declare the fruite of it; and yet much more remayneth to bee ſpoken. For when in theſe dreadfull times many ſhall haue their harts oppreſſed with ſurfeting and dronkenneſſe,
                  34.
                and the cares of this life, and ſo that day of death &amp; dome come vpon them vnawares,

Prayer in watching ſhall preſerue Gods choſen, that they ſhall bee counted worthie to eſcape all theſe things, and not onely ſo, but as followeth, with comfort, euen to ſtand before the Sonne of man, that is, in cheare, in ioy, in ſpirituall motions of hart, not to bee expreſſed by man, to enter into the heauenly and euerlaſting tabernacles. Lord then for thy mercie, teach vs to pray, that theſe bleſſings promiſed to the ſame may light vpon vs. I ſtay the courſe that I might goe on in, for the profites of Prayer are innumerable. It ſanctifieth our mirth, it ſanctifieth our meates, and they are neither of them holy,
                  Iam. 5.13. 1. Tim. 4.5.
                but in this. We wake and we worke,Pſal. 4.8. we ſleepe and we reſt in peace, if we faithfully pray. If we pray with Iacob,
               
                  Gen. 28.20.
                we proſper with Iacob in our iourney: If we pray with Dauid, we haue our heads couered with Dauid in the day of battaile.
                  Pſal. 140.7.
                If we pray with the father, wée haue our ſonne healed:
                  Mar 9.25.
                If wee pray with the mother,
                  Math. 15.28.
                we haue our daughter healed: If we pray with the maiſter, wée haue our ſeruaunt healed.
                  Math. 8.13.
                And what ſhould I ſay? Cornelius praying, hath Peter ſent vnto him,
                  Act. 10.
                and the holy Ghoſt powred vpon him:

               Anna praying, hath a childe giuen her:
                  1. Sam. 1.10.
                and to conclude, there is no ende of the tale, nor meaſure of Gods mercies, if wee ſpeake of the fruites of Prayer. This knew well the godly Father S. Chriſoſtome,
               
                  Homil. 1. of praying to God.
                and therefore he ſayth: if thou deſireſt to liue ſingle, or in holy Matrimonie to Gods content, pray: if thou deſireſt to bridle anger, and with meekneſſe to be familiar, pray: if thou deſireſt to bee free from the fret of enuie, or to doe any thing that belongeth to a godly life, pray, and pray hartely, pray,
                  It is no ſmall commendation of prayer that the Spirit teacheth it. Rom. 8.26.
                and pray often, pray, and pray faithfully, &amp; the Lord ſhall graunt thy prayer. For it is armatura inexpugnabilis, an armour of proofe againſt all and euery aſſaulting darte of the deuill or his members and meanes whatſoeuer. So profitable is Prayer we ſee. The Lord in mercie giue vs ſpirites.
            
               Amen I beſeech him. Yet ſee the poyſon of Satan in his members againſt this fruitfull exerciſe: for there want not wittes in this wicked worlde, that dare diſpute againſt it, and aſke how it may bee that we ſhould fitly aſke of the Lord by prayer any thing, ſince without aſking, and before aſking, he knoweth

what wee want and would haue, yea ſo fully knoweth he all things, that he needeth no remembrauncer to put him in minde of any thing: and therefore why ſhould wee aſke or euer pray, but leaue the Lord to himſelfe to giue what pleaſeth him.
            
            Trueth it is that thus they reaſon, but I truſt you ſee the impietie of their ſpeech, and the blindneſſe of their harts: for it is an olde rule and a true, that Subordinata non pugnant inter ſe. Things that are compriſed one in an other are not contrary one to the other: and ſuch are Gods fore-knowledge of all things, and our aſking notwithſtanding by prayer what we want. For in his owne perſon expreſſely in his worde he hath commaunded, notwithſtanding all this his diuine knowledge of euery mans eſtate, which he knewe himſelfe to knowe as well as wee, yet neuertheleſſe that we ſhould pray to him in our needes, and aſke if we would receiue at his hands. And therefore you ſee this is a meruaile by the witneſſe euident of the Lord himſelfe,
                  Math. 7.7. Iohn. 4.2.
                and our Prayer is not taken away in any reſpect by the Lords knowledge, but they

implyed one vnder the other, ſtand and agree well both together. Then if you looke  at the practiſe of Gods children, you may plainly ſee the ſame.
                  Pſal. 139.
                For Dauid confeſſing of the Lord, that he did not only know his wants, but his very thoughts, and that long before. Yet neuertheleſſe for all this knowledge in God, vſeth his owne duetie commaunded, and prayeth for his wants. Yea our ſauiour Chriſt (which may ſtand for many proofes) in the ſame chapter,
                  Math. 6.11.
                biddeth vs call vpon our heauenly father by Prayer for our daylie bread, that is, for all neceſſities, and yet telleth vs, that he knoweth alreadie and before that we haue need of theſe things.
                  Verſ. 32.
                
               Elias the Prophet promiſed Achab rayne, not raſhly vpon his own head, but as priuie to the Lords purpoſe,
                  1. Kings. 18.42.
                and certified of his will, and yet for all that, moſt earneſtly prayed he, crouching to the earth, and his face betwixt his knees, and ſeauen times ſent his ſeruant towarde the Sea for it. Therefore let vs knowe, and ſo conclude, although the Lorde vnderſtande moſt fullie and perfectly, what wee would haue, before wee pray, yet hath himſelfe appoynted this meanes to obtaine

at his handes, notwithſtanding that his knowledge, and therefore wee muſt vſe it euer notwithſtanding the ſame, knowing that what his wiſedome hath ioyned as ſtanding &amp; agreeing together, thoſe, mans wiſedome, nay mans folly, or Satans malice may not ſeperate, as diſagreeing, and one fruſtrating the vſe or profite of the other. And againe, that is no ende of our Prayer at any time, to admoniſh God of  any eſtate of ours vnknowne vnto him, but we pray, notwithſtanding he knoweth alreadie what wee want, to perfourme our obedience to his commaundement, and appoynted meane to giue glory to him as the fountaine of all good, to teſtifie to the world our faith and truſt in him, and his promiſes, to exerciſe our patience in ſtill yet expecting and aſking, and for ſondrie ſuch cauſes allowed and godly, and not to put him in minde, as one that knoweth not our deſire. Fond therefore I truſt you ſee this reaſon is againſt the vſe of Prayer.
            
               Trueth it is, I thanke GOD, and ſo let it fall. Yet giue me leaue to propound an other to the ſame purpoſe, but I truſt of no greater force. They ſay

thoſe things are not to bee aſked euen of a man, much leſſe of the Lord, which he willingly and of his owne accorde is purpoſed to giue: for that were not to honor, but rather to diſhonor, by granting where no neede is.
               
                  Eſa 65.24. Pſal. 21.4.
                
               But whatſoeuer we want the Lord is readie to giue, and therefore we ſhould aſke nothing.
            
            In deede of no greater force at all. For it offendeth euen as the other did, in reaſoning of thinges ſubordinate one vnder the other, and agreeing well together as of things contrary to themſelues, and therefore taking away one an other. The willingneſſe of God to graunt our deſires taketh not away our Prayer, but ſtrengthneth our faith to aſke chéerefully, and therfore euen then when he ſaith you ſhal haue,
                  Math. 7.
                he ſaith alſo aſke by Prayer: then when he ſaith I will heare,
                  Pſal. 50.
                he ſaith alſo call vppon me: and euen then when he promiſeth to be néere, yet he mentioneth to whom,
                  Pſal. 145. Ioel. 2.32. Pſal. 34.16.
                namely to ſuch as pray vnto him. And the eyes of the Lord are vpon the iuſt, and his eares are open to their Prayers. Therfore euen the Lord himſelfe being iudge, his purpoſe to graunt taketh not away our obedience

to aſke: his readie willingnes to giue, euen before we aſke, croſſeth not at all his commaundement neuertheleſſe to aſke, and ſo neither our bounden duetie to perfourme the ſame continually. But by all thoſe places of his fatherly readines, and moſt mercifull willingnes to doe vs good, as I haue alreadie ſaide, our faith is ſtrengthned, our harts incouraged, his goodneſſe ſhewed, and our obedience in 
                  〈…〉
                Prayer confirmed greatly, not any way ſubuerted or taken away.
            
               Well then, ſee nowe an other deuiſe of Satan againſt this holy exerciſe. If we cannot take it away out of the vſe of mē by theſe concluſions, let vs trie another way to make it vaine, and not onely ſo to our ſelues, but euen hatefull and abhominable to the Lorde. Let vs aſcribe vnto it merite of remiſsion of ſinnes, iuſtification with God, many marueilous vertues aboue the dignitie allowed in the word, and finally to ſaluation. And to this ende let vs alleage all the places of Scripture wherein Prayer is commended highly,
               
                  Mark. 9.29. Pſal. 55.17. &amp;c.
                
               as if they meant thus highly.
            
            
               Indeede you ſay very true, ſuch there are, and thus Satan perſwadeth. But alas what ſhould wee ſtande vpon it. It is one thing to be a meanes and an other thing to be a cauſe of ſaluation and mercie. Gods children acknowledge no cauſe of their life with God,
                  1. Cor. 1.31.
                but Chriſt Ieſus only in whom freely the Lord hath loued vs: but meanes many, as hearing, reading, faſting,
                  2. Cor. 5.18.
                &amp; what we ſpeake of praying. Our prayers are acceptable to our GOD, but neuer for them ſelues, but for Chriſt. They are auaileable alſo with God, but by &amp; for faith in Chriſt, whereof earneſt Prayer ioyned with faſting is a token. And therfore if we obtaine of God neuer ſo great matters by Prayer, our Prayer yet is no cauſe of that, but only a meanes. So then a fooliſh and falſe argument it is to cut it off, that thus reaſoneth of a cauſe that is not a cauſe indeede.
            
               I ſee well then the foundation of Prayer, euen in nature. I ſee the neceſsitie of it in reſpect of God, our ſelues, and our brethren: I ſee the marueilous and exceeding profite of it, and laſtly the malice of Satan againſt it in both extremities, either ſeeking to deface it

as not required: or if he cannot that do, in aſcribing vnto it aboue that which is lawfull, thereby to make it fruitleſſe with God. Will you now adioyne any more?
            
            It ſhall not bee amiſſe alſo for vs to conſider thoſe other poynts which bee vſually conſidered in theſe treatiſes, and compriſed for memorie in an olde verſe, to wit: Affectus, cauſae, quis, per quem, quidque petendum. That is:

                  With what affection we muſt pray.
                  For what cauſes.
                  To whome.
                  Through whome.
                  For what.
               
            
            And concerning the firſt, the Scripture teacheth vs that wee muſt pray with a zealous ſpirit,
                  Affection required in prayer.
                with hart, with ſoule, and with all the power within vs, not with colde affection and lippe labour. The Apoſtles ſpeach of the Spirit may giue this rule of Praier in it euer to be obſerued,
                  Rom. 12.
                
               be feruent in Praier. The Lord himſelfe by his Prophet complayneth that the people cried not in their hearts vnto him,
                  Hoſe. 7.14.
                that is, with this affection that we ſpeake of. And the auncient

Ceremonies of lifting vp of handes remembreth vs thereof. The ſpirit of God witneſſeth it of his children, as of Anna, ſhe prayed and wept ſore,
                  1. Sam. 1.10.13.
                troubled in her minde that her lippes ſhooke withall, albeit ſhe ſpake in her heart. Of Moſes that he cryed vnto the Lord, and yet he ſpake neuer a word,
                  Exo. 14.15.
                but ſo vehement was his ſpirite and ſo feruent his inwarde powers of Soule and heart, that it was like a ſhrill ſhrike in the eares of the Lord. This heate of heart, it is glorious before the Lord and profitable to vs: but it is not at our commaundement, we cannot haue it when wee will, the Lord hath reſerued it to himſelfe to giue, when, and where, and to whome, and in what meaſure it pleaſeth him. As it is witneſſed vnto vs by the Apoſtle ſaying: The Spirit helpeth our infirmities: for wee knowe not what to pray as wee ought:
               
                  Rom. 8 26.
                
               but the Spirit it ſelfe maketh requeſt for vs with ſighes, which cannot be expreſſed. That is, wee are not able of our ſelues to pray with that feruentneſſe of ſpirite, that heate of hart, ſuch motion of minde, ſuch truſt, ſuch faith, ſuch ſighes, ſuch power, ſuch affection, in a word, euery

way as is conuenient to the Maieſtie of God, vnleſſe we be inabled by his Spirite: and therefore in mercie he ſupplieth with the ſame as pleaſeth him. Neuertheleſſe, meanes there are in the word noted vnto vs, which worke vnder the bleſſing of this Spirite to this effect in meaſure in vs: and therefore if this affection bée required in vs they be alſo neceſſary as helpers to ye ſame.
            
               
                  Helpes of affection.
               The firſt is a true conſideration of our owne vnworthineſſe and indignitie, ſuch and ſo great as that there is no mercie due vnto vs: Such as maketh vs with the Publican not to will to lift vp our eyes to heauen,
                  Luc. 18.13.
                but to knocke our breaſt and crye in humble ſorte, Good Lord be mercifull to me a ſinner. Such as maketh vs with the Centurion to ſay, Lord I am not worthie that thou ſhouldeſt come vnder my roofe,
               
                  Math. 8.8.
                
               and therefore ſay but the worde and my ſeruant ſhall bee well. Such againe as maketh vs with Daniell to ſay in ſmarting woe,
                  Dan. 9.18.
                
               O Lord wee doe not preſent our ſupplications before thee for our owne righteouſneſſe, but for thy great tender mercies.
               
                  Pſal. 133.2.
                With Dauid, O Lorde enter not into iudgement with

thy ſeruants, for no fleſh liuing ſhall bee iuſtified in thy ſight. With Eſay:
               
                  Eſay. 64.6.
                
               Wee haue all bene as an vncleane thing, &amp; all our righteouſneſſe is as filthie cloutes, and we all doe fade like a leafe, and our iniquities like the winde haue taken vs away. With Ieremy:
               
                  Iere. 14.7.
                
               O Lord though our iniquities teſtifie againſt vs, deale with vs according to thy name, for our rebellions are many, and wee haue ſinned againſt thee. And finally, ſuch as may iuſtly make our ſoules vexed within vs when we thinke of it, our bodies to bowe downe and goe crookedly, and our eyes to faile,
                  Baruch. 2.18.
                as he ſpeaketh. This low conceipt, but true conceipt of our ſelues, marueilouſly quickneth vp our ſpirites, and therefore is euer to bée vſed, and our ſoules prepared therevnto by ſome fit meditation of it before Prayer. This wanted the proud Phariſie, &amp; therefore his prayer ſheweth no zeale nor heate, as the humble hart that commeth creeping to the Lord in humilitie, confeſſing greefe for ſinne, and ſpeaketh as one doth to him that hath no cauſe to giue, but great and many to withholde. Euer therefore bée carefull of this, to kéepe vppon your ſoule,

as vpon a trée that you would haue growe broade and large, but not high, a weight of her owne true vnworthineſſe, and certainely you ſhall finde the power of it, in quickening affection when you pray, great.
            
                The ſeconde meanes is a true conſideration of the things that we aſke for, how profitable, expedient, and good for vs they are, howe bad wee are without them, &amp;c. By which thinges there ſhall growe in our hartes an heate and prayer for them more earneſt, and if this be wanting, wée pray in an order and a forme, but zeale is away, foraſmuch as wee knowe no great hurte if we ſpéede not, and if ou
                  •
                wordes be more vehement than the true and ſimple deſire of the thinges prayed for doth procure, it is mockerie, ſuch as the Lorde will puniſh. And therefore let this be an other Chriſtian meanes, carefullie vſed euer as we may in our prayers, to worke a right affection in vs, euen ſo much as euer wée can, to conſider of the things we want and aſke, before we aſke them.
            
                Then when we ſée theſe two, to wit, our vnworthineſſe to receiue, and the benefite of the gift, let the thirde be a true

viewe of the want of any vnder meanes in this worlde to compaſſe our deſire by, or if we haue any, as friendes, riches, and ſuch like, yet the great inabilitie that is in them all, vnleſſe the Lorde ſay Amen, giue his bleſſing to their labours, and proſper their indeuours for vs. For thus againe will growe a feruentneſſe in our affections, and a right godly zeale in our prayers. Yea the more emptie that we come before the Lord in this reſpect, the more life hath our Prayers alwaies. For he that in truth doubteth his helpe at home to bee ſufficient, his ſuite for reliefe abroad will be more earneſt. He that ſecretly ſhrinketh to the conceipt of the power of any ſecond cauſe whatſoeuer to giue him any good by, and cleaueth not only to the Lord, in a Chriſtian renounciation of all the meanes in the world, further then hee will vouchſafe to bleſſe them, his Prayer ſhall be colde, and more froſen, as reſting vpon other matters aſwell as vpon his prayer, and if he ſpeede, neuer ſo thankfull to the Lord neither. Therefore you ſee a third care of the childe of God, if he will haue his prayer pithie, euen to emptie his hart of al ſuch earthly bondage as we haue

ſpoken of, to goe to his knees, either without them in déede, or without any truſt and confidence in them, further then the Lorde ſhall ſtrengthen them to him and for him.
            A fourth, is an eye to the ſweete promiſes  of God, concerning the ſutes of his children to him, which are ſo manie, and ſo intire, as no heart, if it be not flint or ſtéele, but muſt receiue comforte and courage to ſpeake vnto ſuch a Lord.
                  Math. 7.

               Come vnto me and I will refreſh you: Whoſoeuer ſhall call vpon the Lord ſhall be ſaued. And a thouſand ſuch like. Muſe vpon them till the fire kindle within you, and then ſpeake with a ſpirit to ſo ſweet a God as ſo cheareth his children to pray hartely. And remember it often what once was ſaide:
                  Pſal. 5.7.
                
               I will come into thy houſe euen vpon the multitude of thy mercie, and in thy feare will I worſhippe toward thy holy temple. The multitude of Gods mercies make a ſweete entraunce into the

houſe of Prayer: yea, ſay you with Dauid ioyfully and comfortably, In Gods worde will I reioyce,
               
                  Pſal. 156.10.
                
               in the Lords worde will I comfort my ſelfe, in God haue I put my truſt, I will not feare what man can doe vnto me.
            
            Other meaner helpes alſo there be of affection not to bee contemned of the godly, as to ſpeake and pronounce our Prayers with words: for ſometimes our weakneſſe is great and our minds begin to ſtray from our Prayer conceiued in ſilence, and then it ſhall bee good to ſpeake out, yea euen to cry out that which wée but thought before, to the ende that ſo wee may ſtay a ſtarting minde and bring it to the ſounde of the tongue. This hath bene a wiſedome of the godly euer, and a meanes as wee reade to helpe them. The Profite Dauid ſaith. I cried to the Lorde with my voice,
               
                  Pſal. 142.1.
                
               and I ſaide,
               
                  verſ. 6.
                
               thou art my hope and my portion in the lande of the liuing. So that he vſeth the pronountiation of worde, and happelie euen for this cauſe that wée ſpeake of. Saint Auguſtine ſayeth Deuotio noſtra voce excitatur, our deuotion and affection is ſtirred vppe and and quickened

by the voyce. And experience ſerueth for longer proofe in this matter. The geſtures of body, as knéeling, lying proſtrate vpon the earth, knocking of the breaſt, and couering the face, or turning to the wall, lifting vp the eies, and ſuch like, they are helpes alſo of affection. Yea then are they lawfull, and right in deede, when they ſerue to this purpoſe in ſinceritie, and not to any outward ſhewe in hypocriſie. And thus much of them.
            Now on the other ſide, as theſe be helps vnder God to quicken vp our Spirites in prayer, if we bee dull, and to make vs pray zealouſly and earneſtly: ſo are there impediments alſo that hinder vs and make vs that wee cannot pray with ſuch affection as we ought. As the contraries of theſe that I haue ſpoken of, A proude hart puft with conceit of merit, an ignorance, or at leſt not a through conſideration of the thing, or thinges we begge, a leaning to ſecond cauſes ouermuch, a dulnes in the ſeeking of Gods promiſes, &amp; ſuch like, which I may not nowe ouer againe folow at large. One great let only will I touch, and ſo conclude this poynt, &amp; that is ignorāce of the ſpeech

or tongue wherein we pray: Which I call euen a great let, becauſe it not onely hindereth our affection and zeale, but otherwiſe dangerouſly hurteth vs by keeping from vs a ſingular fruite of our prayer as will appeare.
            This great folly then of many in ye world that delight to pray in a ſtraunge tongue, &amp; not onely ſo, but boldly (to ſay no worſe of them) defende that they can pray with as right an affection thus, as otherwiſe, hath firſt God againſt it in his word moſt plainly by the voyce of Saint Paul the Apoſtle,
                  1. Cor. 14.
                who ſaith flatly, no man heareth their prayers that are ſo made,
                  Verſ. 2.
                no man heareth them I ſay and marke the wordes well. The Apoſtle meant not but that the ſound of that vnknowne voyce entred into their eares, but becauſe it entred without vnderſtanding, therfore it was in truth then, is now, and euer ſhalbe no hearing in deede, that is no good hearing, no profitable hearing, no commanded or alowed hearing. And therefore if it bee a duetie inioyned of God that his people ſhoulde bee made partakers of common prayers by hearing what is ſayd, then is it alſo euident that they ought not to

be in a ſtrange tongue, foraſmuch as in this place the Spirit of trueth telleth vs, ſuch prayers are not heard at all in déede, as are not vnderſtood when they are heard.
            Secondly if the pipe or harpe bee not 
                  reason 2 vnderſtood for want of diſtinction in the ſoundes, the hearer is without benefite of that ſound, and the inſtrument is not vſed as it ought to bee, euen ſo, if the tongue wherein prayers are powred foorth to the Lord be not vnderſtood, the hearer of that ſound is without profite, and that ſounde is not well vſed in that order. The Trumpet alſo vſed to ſignifie vnto ſouldiers when &amp; howe to prepare themſelues to the battaile if it giue an vncertaine ſounde there is no preparation made: euen ſo againe is the tongue or ſpeech which we vſe in prayer the meanes to ſtirre vs vp to that ſpirituall exerciſe and to performe the ſame, and therefore if it bee not vnderſtoode, it leaueth vs wronged as did the other, and the dutie required of vs is not done. Vnleſſe we can ſay that ſouldiers that heare the trumpet &amp; not vnderſtanding what it meaneth, runne euery man his way from his felow,
                  verſ. 9.
                do wel.
            
               
                  reason 3 Thirdly the holy prayers of the Church

ought not to be ſpoken into the winde that is in vayn. But ſo they are (ſaith the Lord) if they bee made in a tongue that is not vnderſtood, and therefore they ought not to be ſo.
            Fourthly, neither ſhould the miniſter be 
                  reason 4 a Barbarian to his people in the houſe of God and dutie of prayer, that is, one that is not vnderſtood, and therfore might aſwell hold his peace as ſpeake, neither ought any man or woman priuately be ſo to themſelues,
                  verſ. 11.
                But except we knowe the power of the voyce, ſayth the Scripture, that is, except we vnderſtand what is prayed, that is ſo, namely both hee a Barbarian to vs and we to our ſelues: therfore the tongue ſhould not be vnknowen to vs.
            Fifthly, if wee pray in a ſtrange tongue 
                  reason 5 our vnderſtanding is without profite and fruite ſaith the Apoſtle,
                  verſ. 14.
                and that ought not to bee ſo.
                  verſ. 15.
                But when we pray we ought to pray with our Spirit and with our vnderſtanding alſo wee ought to ſing with our Spirite and with our vnderſtanding alſo. Therefore wee may not pray in a ſtraunge tongue.
            Sixtly our prayers ought to be ſo made 
                  reason 6
               
that all the company may anſwere Amen, but if they be in a ſtrange tongue ſayth the ſame Scripture againe, hee that occupieth the place of the vnlearned can not ſo anſwere,
                  Verſ. 16.
                becauſe hee knoweth not what thou ſayeſt, Therefore they ought not to bee ſo.
            
               
                  reason 7 Seuenthly, the Apoſtle propoundeth him ſelfe for an example and ſayth that notwithſtanding hee was able to ſpeake more languages then they all,
                  Verſ. 10.
                yet had hee rather in the Church ſpeake fiue words with his vnderſtanding that hee might alſo inſtruct others, then ten thouſand words in a ſtrange tongue. And what care thinke we ſhall be in vs to folow his practiſe? Shall he be the déere one of the Lord in ſo doing, and we ſo alſo in hauing no ſuch care nor conſcience, but euen flat contrary, to ſpeake rather ten thouſand wordes that we do not know, neither profit others by, than fiue that do both? Let vs conſider it, and ſetting aſide all froward wilfulnes and damnable preiudice of a trueth, take héede betimes. Prayer is a ſweete obedience to the Lord if it be aright, make it not a diſobedience to his will your ſelfe by doing it wrong. Many are the bleſſings promiſed to it, turne not thoſe bleſſings

into a curſe by a ſtubborne heart that will not be inſtructed.
                  verſ. 8.
                Laſtly we edyfie not our ſelues by ſuch vnknowne prayers, which yet wee ought to doe, aſwell in our priuat exerciſes, as the publicke miniſter his whole people in a publique place, all thinges being commanded of God priuatly and openly to be done to edifying,
                  vers. 26.
                and the reaſon being all one, namely our benefite &amp; theirs before the Lord, therefore we ſhould not vſe them.
            Thus is the Lord againſt it, &amp; his word. Let vs nowe conſider men, and in them either their practiſe or their iudgement, and ſee if this kinde of praying may be warranted that way. Concerning the firſt then,
                  The practiſe of the godly againſt this error.
                may we find any Patriarke or Prophet, any ſeruant of God whatſoeuer, either in the olde Teſtament, or newe, that vſed thus to pray in a ſtrange tongue? No, no, it is well knowne that from the very creation of mā, till the corruption of Rome infected the Church, there is not one to bee produced, that either being a miniſter of common prayer, made it in a tongue that the people knewe not, or being a priuat man, prayed priuatly hee wiſt not what? Not one Prophet,

not one Apoſtle not one man or woman of holy memorie in the booke of God, that euer vſed it. And yet they prayed as often, as much, as Zealouſly, as fruitefully, and as commendably, as we I trowe, yea happy we, if we were like them. And is it nothing to leaue the example of all theſe Saynts, and to go a courſe that not one of them euer practiſed? Is there like comfort in a thing neuer vſed, and euer vſed of gods choſen? Howe then are ſumme bewitched in ſmall matters to relye vpon examples, and euer to bee ſpying and prying into the wayes &amp; workes of weaker men ten thouſand parts, and yet in this matter ſo weightie and great, to caſt behind them the practiſe of ſuch great ones, and neuer to regard it?
                  Their iudgements againſt it.
                for the publique prayers of the Church it hath euer moued mee ſince I knewe it, what I ſee recorded, by indifferent men in this behalfe:
                  Cap. 13. ad finem.
                Saint Hierom ſpeaking of the Pompe of Paulaes funerall in his Epitaphe he made of her, and ſhewing what cō
               curſe was to it of people of diuers languages, playnely layeth it downe, that euery one had the tongue they vnderſtood in their common prayers, and not a ſtraunge one.

And yet none of thē was neither Hebrew, Greeke, nor Latine, which ſome count only holy, but the Syriacke.

                Saint Auguſtine willing the Prieſts to apply their ſtudies to correct the errors of their Latine ſpeech in thoſe dayes, addeth this reaſon: vt populos ad id quod planè intelligit dicat, Amen: That the people to that which they fully vnderſtand may anſwere Amen. Note the cuſtome of the Church then, and the faithfull care of this godly father for the people, that no let might be to their vnderſtanding of the common prayers. The ſame Father againe in an other place ſaying that wee neede not any vtterance of words alwayes to pray vnto God,
                  De Magistro, in principio.
                becauſe the Sacrifice of Iuſtice is ſanctified in the Temple of the mind and in the ſecret chambers of the hart, by and by obiecteth to him ſelfe, wherefore then doth the Prieſt lift vp his voyce, and pray aloude in the open aſſemblie in the Church, and then anſwereth to the ſame thus: Not that God, but that men may heare him, and that the people by the ſounde of his voyce and vnderſtanding of his meaning, may be put in minde, and by conſent ioyned together, and lift vp to

God.

What profite is there in ſpeech be it neuer ſo perfect, if the vnderſtanding of the hearer cannot attaine it. For there is no cauſe why wee ſhould ſpeake at all, if they vnderſtand not what we ſpeake, for whoſe ſake wee ſpeake that they may vnderſtande vs. Againe, Mens mea ſine fructu eſt,

And again, Si intellectum mentis remoueas, nemo aedificatur audiendo quod non intelligit. Set apart the vnderſtanding of the mind, and no man hath fruite or profite of the thing that hee peeceiueth not. Quid opus eſt iubilare &amp; non intelligere iubilationem,

               vt vox noſtra ſola iubilet &amp; cor non iubilet. Sonus enim cordis intellectus eſt. What needeth vs to ſing if we vnderſtand not what wee ſing, to ſing with our voyce and not with our heart. For vnderſtanding is the ſounde or voyce of the heart. Theſe

are moſt playne teſtimonies, and worthy conſideration, if we deſire a truth.
            
               Origen againe very plainely ſayth of ſuch things as are read in the Church. Non fuiſſet neceſſarium legi haec in eccleſia, niſi ex his aedificatio aliqua audientibus praeberetur? It ſhould neuer need to reade them vnleſſe ſome edification ſhoulde come by them to the hearers. But without vnderſtanding we know not what edification is, &amp; therfore Origens iudgement is openly this, that if Scriptures and prayers ſhoulde bee in a ſtrange tongue then it were as good that there were neuer any at all of either of thē. O marke it. Cyprian next as flatly again, Not the ſound of the voyce, but the mind &amp; vnderſtanding muſt pray vnto the Lorde with pure intention.
                  In Leuit. cap. 7
                  
                But my vnderſtanding to pray &amp; the language to be ſtraunge to me that I pray in, is impoſſible, therfore farre was Cyprian from this folly. Saint Chriſoſtome againe the like,
                  De orat Dom.
                and many mo, that I ſpare to name in this briefe treatiſe. The fauorers of Rome in latter dayes ſawe this trueth, and yelded their teſtimonies plainely for it. Lyra and Thomas of Aquin ſpare not to auouch it, that the common

ſeruice in the Primatiue Church was euer in the common vulgar tongue, that the people did vnderſtande. That earneſt &amp; as ſome thinke, ſtrong defender of the contrary to this, by the power of a trueth is drawen to theſe very woordes: that in the Primatiue Church the prayers were made in a commō tongue knowne to the people,

                for cauſe of their further inſtruction, and it was ſo neceſſary to be: and againe in an other place: It were good the people hauing humble and reuerent heartes vnderſtoode the ſeruice,
                  Diuiſio. 31.
                  
                I deny it not. And whereas they ſay they can as heartily, as earneſtly, and with as vehement an affection pray, although they knowe not what they ſay, may they not ſee their owne Doctor ſay the contrary flatly, and a man of no common learning?
                  Lyra in 1. Cor. 14.
                  
                
               Si populus intelligit orationem Sacerdotis, melius reducitur ad Deū, &amp; deuotius reſpondet, Amen. that is, If the people vnderſtand the prayer of the Prieſt, they are the better brought vnto God, &amp; with more deuotion farre, anſwer, Amen. Now there is the ſame reaſon of their deuotion openly, and of our owne priuatly. May they not ſee it playnely affirmed.
                  Aug. prefat. in Pſal.
                
               Quo modo poteſt

debitè Deo pſallere qui non intelligit quid pſallit? How can he rightly ſing vnto God that vnderſtandeth not himſelfe what hee ſingeth? as if hee ſhould ſay it cannot bee, it is impoſſible, and not to be hoped for. Laſt of all is it not an olde ſaying grounded vppon true reaſon, Jgnoti nulla eſt cupido: there is no deſire of the thing that wee knowe not? and no deſire I thinke is a very colde affection. Let vs ende then this poynt of the practiſe and iudgement of men with that decree of Pope Innocent the third in the Councel of Laterane, about the yeere of our Lorde 1200. that in ſuch Cities as ſhould bee concurſe of people of diuers nations, the Biſhop ſhoulde take order that euery people ſhould haue a Paſtor of their owne language, which might ſerue them, and miniſter vnto them in the ſame. A thing very worthy obſeruing, that euen with the Pope himſelfe the trueth of this cauſe, that prayers ought to be vnderſtood, ſhould preuaile.
            We haue ſeene then God, and wee haue ſeene men againſt this great corruption and hinderance of our prayer, and men both in practiſe and iudgement. What if

we ioyne nowe for concluſion of all verie open reaſon againſt it? It may doe good. For truely euen this ſtriketh ſo deepe in in this behalfe, as any Chriſtian heart may feare euer to come before the Lorde with prayer in this order. For it is not one, and a verie ſingular vſe of our prayers, to ſtrengthen and frame our faith by the experience of mercies aſked and receiued at our God his handes. It working euer in vs a truſt, an hope, yea, an vnſpeakeable comfort, that he will be as he hath beene, being no changeling in himſelfe, and that whome he hath heard ſo graciouſly, ſo readely, and ſo often, with graunt of their deſires, thoſe hee will euer heare, and ſtill heare in their right and lawfull prayers, to the prayſe of his mercie, and the ioye of them his ſeruauntes in their diſtreſſes? Now this ſingular vſe and profite as I ſay of prayer are they depriued of, that vſe to pray in a ſtraunge tongue, for if any particular benefite be giuen them, they knowe not whether it hath come at their intreaty, or no, becauſe they know not what they haue prayed for, and ſo receiue they no ſure and certaine teſtimonie of the Lords helpe

and goodneſſe to them, to the comfort of their hartes at all times when they ſhall néede againe to call vpon him. And therefore if this be a bleſſing to haue true experience, nay thouſands of experiences of the Lordes ſwéete fauour to vs, then muſt it needes be a daungerous thing to our faith, that robbeth vs of all and euery tryall of our God. Therefore let but euen reaſon ſpeak in this cauſe, and it will conclude vnto our conſciences thus, that foraſmuch as petitions knowen of vs to bee made by vs to the Lorde, and of him graunted to vs, (which is done when we vnderſtande our prayers) doe ſtrengthen our faith in comfort euer to reſt vpon the Lord, and the contrarie (which is when we pray in a ſtrange tongue) doth weaken the ſame, and rob vs of that comfort that groweth by experience, therefore it is profitable to pray in the one, and moſt dangerous to praie in the other. Againe, is not the remembraunce of Caligulaes fact in this reſpect moſt fit, and preſſeth anie honeſt mind in the world with ſight of fruitleſſe labour in ſuch kindes of praiers? Caligula the Emperour ſet golden leaues before his gueſtes, and all other

ſeruices in forme of meats of beaten gold, &amp; bad them eate. But their dainties were too hard, &amp; for all yt glorious ſhew they roſe an hungered. And doth not this Romiſh practiſe in very like ſort ſet before the people of God, whoſe ſouls are déere to ye Lord that made them, a gliſtering ſeruice of Hebrew, Greeke, &amp; Latine, &amp; bid them feed? But alas what ſhould they feed vpon? A goodly ſhew there is to ſtir vp wonder &amp; aſtoniſhment in the people, but to receiue or taſt of, either to moue thē to repentāce, or to cōfort &amp; quiet their conſcience they haue nothing. And how paſſing well ſpeaketh Auſten in like caſe, Quid prodest clauis aurea, ſi aperire quod volumus nō poteſt?
               
                  De doctrinae Christiana. lib. 4. cap. 11.
                  
                
               aut quid obeſt lignea, ſi hoc poteſt: quando nihil quarimus niſi patere, quod clauſū erat? What auaileth a golden key, if it cannot open yt we woulde haue opened? Or what hurteth a woodden key, if it be able to opē? ſeeing we deſire nothing but that yt thing that is ſhut may be opened? The wrong is apparant to the church of God, though I ſay no more, but it paſſeth a frenſie for men &amp; women in their priuate praiers to deale thus wt thēſelues. For I truſt to refreſh their hungrie bodies

they would ſet no ſuch hard meate as gold before thēſelues: and ſkilleth it not how it feedeth the ſoule that ſhould feed it, ſo it be glorious to the ſhew? O conſider it, &amp; whoſoeuer ſeeke to ſtarue vs, let vs not be guilty of our own ſpiritual death our ſelues. Again, if ye brute beaſts or birds diſcouer this follie let vs not refuſe them. If they could ſpeak, as Democritus ye philoſopher ſomtime thought, &amp; as Lactantius a Chriſtian writer ſemeth partly to ſay, they do: yet being birdes &amp; beaſtes &amp; voide of reaſon, they wold not ſpeak they know not what. The very ſenſe of nature therfore is againſt this folly. But let their ſoūd be a ſound without ſenſe &amp; vnderſtanding, as Plinies rauē that could ſaie Aue Caeſar Imperator, All haile Emperor Caeſar, or the Cardinals Popiniay that could pronounce diſtinctlie all the Articles of the Créed, &amp; yet knew not what they ſayd: ſhame we not to be like them? Hauing the gift of reaſon giuen vs of God aboue all the creatures that he made, to diſtinguiſh vs from them in the rule of all our actions? Let the olde Father Saint Auguſtine ſpeak both for the cauſe and for this reaſon.

               Quid hoc ſit quod precati ſumus,

intelligere debemus, vt humana ratione, non quaſiauium voce cantemus. Nam et meruli, et pſitaci, et corui, et picae, et huiuſmodi volucres, ſaepe ab hominibus docentur ſonare, quod neſciunt. Scienter autem cantare naturae hominis diuina voluntate conceſſum est. What this is that wee haue praied, wee muſt vnderſtande, that wee may ſing with reaſon agréeable to a man, and not chatter with voice as birds doe. For Owſels, and Popiniayes, and Rauens, and Pies, and ſuch like birdes are often taught of men to pronounce that which they doe not vnderſtand. But to ſing with knowledge is giuen by God to mans nature. What teſtimonie plainer, or reproofe more waightie may there be. But I forget my ſelfe, and purpoſing but to touch matters, make too long abode in this thing. Conclude we thē with an effectuall thought in our hearts as men &amp; women that are not ſworne againſt the Lord, and paſt all recouerie, whether euer anie perſon in this world dared, or wée our ſelues durſt ſpeake to an earthly man for a ſute of waight belonging vnto this bodie in this world, and know not what we ſaie? O our care in the one, and careleſnes

in the other, our feare in the one euen ouer tittles and ſillables, and our want o
                  •
                féeling in the other in large ſpeech, what a witneſſe will it beare againſt our ſoules before the Lord in that dreadfull daie if wee take not warning, and leauing betimes the waie that God condemneth, man miſliketh, reaſon reproueth, and very nature abhorreth, make choice of the other which in all theſe reſpects is commended, and by no meanes can euer doe harme. To day if we heare the truth let vs harden no heartes againſt it.
                  Syrac. 5. verſ. 6.
                  
                Saie not God is mercifull and I hope the beſt, for as he hath mercie ſo commeth wrath from him when we are wilful. Woe to the eare that will not heare, ſayth the Lord often. Larger diſcourſes may be liked of, if neede be, this ſerueth for a taſte of truth in a ſhort treatiſe.
            
               Yea Sir, but God vnderſtandeth what ſoeuer we ſaie, in what tongue ſo euer we ſpeake, and that is ſufficient.
            
            No indeede. For can you affirme that praier was ordained for God alone, or for vs, to make our mone to God by alſo? If it were ſo, and is ſo, then ought we as well to vnderſtande our ſelues, as the Lorde to

vnderſtande vs. And is there no matter what we ſpeake or how we ſpeake, ſo that God vnderſtand vs? Could we ſo content our ſelues towarde a man? Let the one teach vs in the other, and let deſperate concluſions haue deſerued confuſions before our eyes euer. We may as well reaſon agaynſt ſpéech of tongue, becauſe God knoweth our hearts, as againſt vnderſtanding of our praiers, becauſe God vnderſtandeth them. But inough is ſaid.
            
               Goe you then to the cauſes of our prayers, which is next in order of our verſe.
            
            Theſe haue in effecte alſo ſufficientlie bene touched alreadie in this that hath ben ſpoken. For wee haue hearde cauſes in reſpect of God, in reſpect of our ſelues, and in reſpect of our brethren. Which you maye turne backe vnto again, if you will, and peruſe all cauſes vrgent and weightie of our prayers,
                  Pſal. 50. Iohn. 14.14. Pſal. 14. Luke 17.5. Math 6.13. verſ. 11. Pſal. 18.1.
                that are. God hath commaunded vs to pray, God hath promiſed to heare vs if we pray, threatens to puniſh vs if we doo not: our faith is then confirmed by it, our dangers preuented, our wantes reléeued, our loue to the Lorde increaſed, &amp; our liues

ordred to the example of Gods choſen, euer with ſuch like, and theſe are great cauſes to vſe it.
            
               What ſay you then of the third point concerning the perſons to bee prayed vnto?
            
            I anſwere that onely God and none but God is to be praied vnto, or as the wordes of our faith and Créede hath, one GOD in Trinitie, and Trinitie in vnitie is to bee worſhipped. Which anſwere implying to things as you ſee, to wit, that God is to be prayed vnto, and onely to bee prayed vnto. Let vs ſee the truth of them both out of the word. Firſt then for the former it is mencioned vs in the law.
                  Deutro. 6.13.
                
               Thou ſhalt feare the Lord thy God &amp; ſerue him, &amp; ſwere by his name. And in another place,
                  Chap. 10.20.
                
               Thou ſhalt feare the Lord thy God and ſerue him, and thou ſhalt cleaue vnto him &amp; ſwere by his name. With a number other proofes in euerie place where the word of ſeruing the Lord, by a figure noteth al duties due vnto him in general, &amp; ſo implieth this duty of prayer to him in ſpecial. Euen as Dauid expoūdeth it in his Pſalme, ſaying, I will worſhippe towardes thy holy

Temple, &amp; then expreſſeth what one thing he meaneth by that worſhip. I will praiſe thy name becauſe of thy louing kindneſſe &amp; truth, that is, by prayer of thankſgiuing and praiſe I will doe my dutie. So than this is plaine, and more plain I truſt, than that it ſhould need proofe, that God is to be prayed vnto. If anie would haue reaſon as well as teſtimonies, the Apoſtle giueth vs a ſtrong one of contraries, when he toucheth the Galathians with it as a fault no leſſe than Idolatry, that they did ſeruice vnto them which by nature were no Gods. For it inferreth plainly our not offending, but moſt right doing, when we doe ſeruice vnto him that is by nature God. But praier is a ſeruice and a great ſeruice, therefore due and moſt due to the Lord for euer. But it is not this that anie man doubteth of, and therefore as I ſayde, not to bee ſtoode vpon. It is the other that is a queſtion, to wit, whether God onely is to be praied vnto or no, and therefore let vs looke to that rather and ſee the truth.
            Concerning this then, is not the Scripture as plaine, if wee will not wilfully bee blinde, as in the other? And doth not our

Sauiour Chriſt put it quite out of doubt when he ſaith: him only ſhalt thou ſerue?
               
                  Math. 4.10
                Onely to God, auouched by Chriſt, ſhould ſtand againſt, not only to God, affirmed by tenne thouſand worldes, if there were ſo many to doe it.
                  Eſay. 42.8.
                But the Lorde affirmeth further, that he will not giue his glorie to any other: and it is a parte of Gods glorie in any Chriſtian iudgemēt I hope to praie vnto him, and to make him the fountaine and welſpring of all our good. For, Call vppon me (ſaith the Lorde) in the day of thy trouble, and I will heare thee,
               
                  Pſal. 50.
                
               and thou ſhalt glorifie me. The lawe of God ſaith, Thou ſhalt haue no other Gods but me: which is an excluſion of all creatures in heauen and earth, from partaking with the Lord in any worſhip we owe vnto him as our God. The 17. Chapter of the ſecond booke of Kings is a notable teſtimonie of the Lordes abhorring any partners in this behalfe. For there we may ſee, and heare him witneſſe it vnto our ſoules, who muſt one day come to iudge them in glorie, dreadfull if wee haue not harkned, that not to feare him onely, is not to feare him at all, and not onely to doe after his

lawes and commaundements, is not at all to doe after them. For our additions to the wil of him ouerthroweth vtterly that which wee doe thereof, becauſe it is not as wee ſhould doe it, that is, onely. My couenant and charge with the Iſraelites, ſaith the Lord there, was euer this that they ſhould feare no other Gods, nor bowe themſelues to them, nor ſerue them, nor ſacrifice to them, but onely mee, which brought them out of the land of Egipt with great power and a ſtretched out arme. And marke the emphaſis, Him feare. That is, as we may ſee plainly, him onely, him euer, and none but him. And therefore ouer and ouer he ſaith it there, no other, no other, and againe the third time, no other. Which is proofe ſufficient, if wee bee the Lordes: yet is the Scripture fuller, and teacheth vs plainly that they euer were and euer ſhall. bee blaſphemous Idolaters,
                  Exod. 20. Pſal. 97.7. Pſal. 115.3. Iere. 2.28. Act. 7.42. Deut. 4. Philip. 2.10.
                iniurious to the Lord that call vppon any in their prayer but the ſame Lord alone, whether it be in heauen, or in earth, or in the waters vnder the earth, whether it bee of golde, ſiluer, or whatſoeuer. The places are knowne and you may reade them. It teacheth vs alſo that God

hath made vs in his great mercie Lordes of all his creatures here,
                  Gen. 1.26. Pſal. 8. Hebru. 1.7.
                and euen the Angels in heauen miniſtring Spirits to our good as ſhall pleaſe him to appoynt. But whatſoeuer we pray vnto, we make it ſuperiour to vs, and hauing rule and power ouer vs: and therefore if it bee a creature we offende greeuouſly, peruerting the Lordes appoynted courſe, and ſeruilely ſubmitting our ſelues to that which he in mercie hath put vnder vs, not ouer vs in his maner and order. Againe,
                  Rom. 10.14.
                that we cannot pray to any thing without beleefe in the ſame, but beleefe muſt onely be in God: and therefore prayer to no other. Wherefore it ſtandeth true by the Iudge of trueth, the eternall worde of God wee now well ſee, that both God with his worſhip of prayer is to bée ſerued and honored, and onely God alſo, with excluſion for euer of all others whatſoeuer they may bee: and ſo wee ende this queſtion.
            
               Your next is, through whome or by whome wee muſt preſent and offer our Prayers to God.
            
            It is ſo: And it may bee that in the former queſtion you expected ſome fuller

ſpéech of Angels and Saints that be dead, which many are of opinion may bee called vppon, that yet greatly miſlike that other folly or rather madneſſe of praying to inferiour creatures. And if you did, it ſhal now be ſupplied, God willing: for I did referre it of purpoſe hether, becauſe no man iuſtifieth it amongſt vs, if he haue any cunning, that they are ſimply to bee praied vnto as helpers themſelues of themſelues, but as mediatours to him that is able to helpe, that is, God the Lorde. Let vs ſee then this, if euen but thus much may bee giuen vnto them.
            And to begin at the beginning, we know it true that betwixt God and vs a mediatour muſt needes bee. For ſo ſayth the Scripture.
                  Ihon. 14.6. 1. Tim. 2.5. Heb. 9.6.9.14.19.
                
               No man commeth to the father but by me: And as there is a God, ſo there is a mediatour betwixt God and man. The high Prieſt in the lawe by God aſſigned, a figure and ſhadowe of Chriſt, euen in his office taught the ſame. And conſcience in vs of our owne vnworthines to appeare before God, in our ſelues and for our ſelues, driuing vs away from his preſence, inferreth it neceſſarily with it, that

there muſt bee a Mediatour for vs. But who this, is and euer was through the malice of Satan working in his members, is become a queſtion. We ſay with the truth and his due glorie, Chriſt Ieſus our Lord, and he onely. The Papiſtes ſay Chriſt, but not Chriſt onely. Our warrants bee many, and ſtrong againſt them. Firſt expreſſe words: There is one God,
               
                  1. Timoth. 2.3
                
               and one Mediatour betwixt God and man, the man Chriſt Ieſus. Marke the place well, and ſee how firſt he determineth the number, and ſaith there is but one: Secondly the perſon, who that one is, euen the man Chriſt Ieſus: Thirdly, why there is but one, and no moe: namely, becauſe there is but one God, and no moe. Which is a ſingular proofe, euery one bluſhing to denye the one, and yet daring to auouch the other. So then by this place it is got, that one GOD and but one Mediatour, and that Chriſt alſo: but mo mediatours, mo Gods of neceſſitie: which they will not teach I hope plainly. Secondly,
                  Ihon. 19.13. Ihon 16.4. &amp;c.
                all thoſe places that appoynt vs to praie in Chriſt his name, making euer mention of him, and onely of him, without any addition of any

other, doe they not with a mightie ſtrength vphold our ſoules in this faith? For wanted the Lorde either power or will to adde further trueth, if there had bene any ſuch? Or is he that ſaith he will honor them that honor him,
                  1. Sam. 2.
                become enuious towarde his Saints, and will not ſpeake of their lawful honor, if this were it, to pray to them?
            
               
                  3.
               Thirdly, can any man bee our mediator with God,
                  1. Ihon. 2.1.
                but he that is iuſt himſelfe fully and perfectly before God? And was there euer any ſuch or can be to the worlds ende, but only Chriſt? Is not any thing whatſoeuer it bee that commeth not of faith ſinne? And commeth faith any way but from the word? Then either ſome porofe out of the word againſt Chriſt only, and for others aſwell as Chriſt, or to beleeue it is ſinne and a death for euer, without repentance. Dare we of our owne heades take the honour of Chriſt aſcribed to him ſo expreſſely in his worde, and giue it to others equally with him, without a warrant? It is written Gloriam meam alteri non dabo, I will not giue my glory to an other, and hee that writ it ſhall iudge vs for breaking it, vnleſſe wee can ſhew his diſpenſation. Sanctos defunctos

pro nobis orare, ex nulla ſcriptura Canonica edocemur. That the Saintes departed pray for vs, it appeareth not in any Canonicall Scripture. Et quamuis id faterer, non tamen ex eo ſequeretur, nos oportere ſanctos defunctos inuocare. And although that it ſhould be granted, yet follow therevpon it would not, that we ſhould pray vnto them: for aſſured by the word of God we cannot be that they heare our prayers. And without that aſſurance, what comfort can we pray withal vnto them. Wherfore moſt grieuouſly doe they offende both againſt Chriſt and religion, that make mediators beſide him. We are plainely tolde that hee maketh interceſſion for vs, but wee are not tolde of any others.
                  1. Ihon. 2.1.
                
               I write vnto you litle children ſayth Saint Iohn, that you ſin not, and if any man do ſinne we haue an aduocate with the Father, Ieſus Chriſt the righteous, and he is the propitiatiō for our ſinnes. In which place of Scripture Saint Auſten noteth two thinges. Firſt howe the Apoſtle doeth not ſay yee haue an aduocate,
                  Contra parmenian. lib. 2. cap. 8.
                  
                but we haue an aduocate teaching vs thereby that there was neuer any ſo holy but that he had neede of Chriſt

to be his mediator aſwell as others, and therefore he did not ſeparate himſelfe from others in that reſpect, ſecondly that hee did not ſay ye haue me an aduocate with the father, but yee haue Ieſus Chriſt the righteous: ne
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   ego exoro pro peccatis veſtris: neither is it I that intreat for the pardon of your ſins, but Chriſt. For had the Apoſtle Iohn ſayde otherwiſe quis 
                     •
                  um ferret bonorum atque ſidelium Chriſtianorum? what good and faithfull Chriſtian coulde haue abidden it? Quis ſicut Apoſtolum Chriſti, &amp; non ſicut Antichriſtum intueretur? Yea who woulde haue looked vpon him as vpon an Apoſtle of Chriſt, and not as vpon a very Antichriſt. What a notable teſtimonie is this againſt other mediators beſide Chriſt? and how hapneth it that our Papiſts ſee it not, or thinke better not of it, if they ſee it? But I pray you heare the ſame Father againe in an other place. Quem inuenirem qui me reconciliaret tibi?

with the ill Angell, tranſforming himſelfe into an Angell of light. Verax ergo mediator Chriſtus, the true mediator therefore is Chriſt Ieſus. And much more in thoſe two good Chapters to this purpoſe. Theſe proofes may ſuffice in this briefe treatiſe, yet are there many moe. Themſelues haue had, euen by the mightie power of an able God to giue his trueth paſſage, a true féeling of the ſafetie of the one, and the danger of the other, &amp; their witnes of it ſhould truely work both with them and vs. With them to drawe them to a ſweete trueth, and with vs to ſtrengthen vs where wee ſtand, ſince the Lord hath made his enemies confeſſe the ſoundnes of our fayth. Caſſander ſayde it of his owne practiſe, Ego in meis precibus non ſoleo Sanctos inuocare, ſed inuocationem dirigo ad Deum ipſum, idque in nomine Chriſti: Hoc enim tutius exiſtimo. I, ſayth he, do not vſe to pray to any of the Saints my ſelfe, but I direct my prayers to God himſelfe, and that in the name of Chriſt: for that I iudge more ſafe. An other of them againe: Tutius &amp; iucundius loquor ad meum Ieſum, quàm ad aliquem Sanctorum ſpirituum. Both with more ſafetie and

comfort doe I ſpeake vnto my Ieſus, than to any of the holy ſpirites. Is not this ſtrange that our enemies ſhoulde confeſſe our maner of praying to God alone by the mediation of his beloued ſonne both more ſafe and more comfortable, and for the ſame cauſes vſe it ſo themſelues, and yet teach others otherwiſe. Should faithful teachers ſeeke to ſaue themſelues and make no conſcience to kill others. And is this to deale faithfully with the Lordes inheritance, the price of his ſonnes blood, to teach them to do, what not onely by knowledge in iudgement, but by inward feeling of conſcience, they find neither ſo ſafe nor comfortable, as the way we vſe, &amp; themſelues alſo, is? Wo and woe againe muſt needes be to ſuch, as euen agninſt their owne feeling, direct the people committed to them. And what madnes is this in vs if wee ſuffer our ſelues by any ſubtill perſwaſions to bee led vnto that which our teachers themſelues refuſe for their owne partes to ioyne with vs as in a courſe that is neither comfortable nor ſafe. Let vs hearken rather to the Apoſtle, truely aduertiſing vs to ſuffer none ſuch as theſe,
                  Coloſſ. 2.18.
                neither any man liuing at his pleaſure to

beare rule ouer vs by 
                  For theſe angell worſhippers blamed ſuch of pride as would goe ſtreight to, God, and vſe no other vndermeanes beſide Chriſt, and ſayd the other was humblenes of mind. But ſuch humilitie the Apoſtle condemneth.
                humblenes of mind, and worſhipping of Angels, aduauncing himſelfe in theſe thinges which hee neuer ſaw, raſhly puft vp with his fleſhly minde, and holdeth not the head &amp;c. For aſſuredly if the conſciences of all thē were examined ye delight in other mediators beſide Chriſt, to offer vp their prayers to GOD and to ſpeake for them, and true confeſſion made of what they finde, it would appeare to vs all that this ſinne ſpringeth of none other roote than of a perſuaſion that Chriſt is not ſo pitifull and mercifull, and willing to bée ſpoken vnto as other Saints and creatures be. Which how blaſphemous it is againſt him, to giue his creatures preeminence aboue him in any goodneſſe, let euery feeling hart diſcerne and iudge. Farre was the godly father from ſuch opinion of our Sauiour, when he made him all in all and with truth ſayd of him what all true Chriſtians firmely beleeue and holde:
                  Ambroſe. de Iſaac &amp; anima, lib.
                
               Ipſe os noſtrum eſt, per quod patri loquimur, oculus noſter per quem patrem videmus, dextra noſtra, per quam nos patri offerimus. He is our mouth wherewith wee ſpeake vnto God, our eye wherewith wee ſee GOD, and

our right hande wherewith wee offer our ſelues vnto GOD. Quo niſi intercedente nec nobis nec Sanctis omnibus quicquam cū deo eſt. But by whoſe interceſſion neyther we nor all the Saints in heauen haue any thing to do with the Lord. And yt there remaine no ſcruple of feare in vs to goe to this gratious mediator euer when we pray, conſider it in the Scriptures, and conſider it earneſtly, that that gliſtering reaſon which they vſe of our indignitie to goe to him at the firſt (for ſo I call it becauſe it ſeemeth ſo faire at the firſt vewe) neuer diſcoraged any of the godly mencioned in the worde euer, but euen then when they haue ſeene and thought of their vnworthynes moſt, they haue yet gone vnto God and to no others for helpe. Dauid when hee ſawe that multitude of offences in him and himſelfe ſo horribly defiled as that there remained almoſt nothing of olde Dauid in him, that is of a good ſeruant of God, neuer yet cried to Abraham, Iſaac and Iacob, nor to any of all the godly departed,
                  Pſal. 51. Math. 3.
                or Angels in heauen, but Miſerere mei deus, haue mercy vpon me O God, and according to the multitude of thy mercies do away mine

iniquitie. Iohn Baptiſt, though hee ſawe himſelfe vnworthy to looſe the very latchet of Chriſt his ſhoone, yet taught he no other Mediatour to God, neither had any other himſelf, but only him. The good Centuriō, that in ſo true feeling both of himſelfe, and Chriſt, confeſſed he was not worthie, vnder whoſe roofe the Lord ſhould come, yet with all that vnworthineſſe was not feared from him to aſke his helpe, euen for his ſeruaunt. The poore Publican vnworthie in his owne eies to looke vpon the heauens, yet feareth not to loke vpon his God, and to ſay, God be mercifull vnto me a ſinner, when he might haue called vppon Saints and Angels for mercie, if it had béene as good or better, as theſe mad men affirme. And ſo farre was this his doing from preſumption, diſpleaſaunt to God, and vnſéeming an vnworthie ſinner, as that ſentence is giuen by the Lord himſelfe of it, it was pleaſant &amp; acceptable to God, and he iuſtified more than the other. Finally, the Prodigall Sonne with the ſame mouth that confeſſeth his indignitie euer to be counted a Sonne any more, yet calleth vpon his Father for pittie, and not vpon

any of his Fathers ſeruaunts. Wherfore let vs open our eyes and ſée the truth, let vs not harden our hartes, to day when we heare his voyce, the mediator betwixt God and man is thr man Chriſt Ieſus,
                  1. Timoth 2.5.
                &amp; none but he:
                  Ro. 8.32.
                it is he that ſitteth on the right hand of God and maketh interceſſion for vs,
                  1. Ihon. 2.
                and there is no other. And if any man ſinne wee haue him our aduocate and wee muſt know no other.
            
               Yea Sir, but you knowe their anſwere in this matter, if they bee charged, they doe not denie they ſaie, but Chriſt and onely Chriſt is mediatour of redemption, but not of interceſſion, and that which they aſcribe to holy ſpirites, it is onely to make interceſſion for them.
            
            Indeede they ſo anſwere, but alaſſe in vaine. For it is but a ſhifte deuiſed of Satan to deceiue our ſoules by, if wee receiue it, and that may appeare both to them and vs, if we haue care to ſee the truth. For hath it firſt anie warrant in the worde? If it haue let them produce it, if not, let them knowe that euen for this cauſe it faulteth, and we reiect it. For if this bee graunted that men may frame diſtinctions at theyr

pleaſures, there is not the truth to bee named but it may be ouerthrowen. Wherefore this is one reaſon agaynſt it, it hath no warrant in the worde. Secondly, was not the high Prieſt in the lawe mediator in figure, both of expiation by ſacrifices, and of interceſſion by prayers? That is, more plainly, did not he both offer the ſacrifice &amp; make prayer? And what was this but in ſhadow to ſhew that ſo in the new Teſtament both theſe things ſhould bee conioyned in one man alſo, euen the man Chriſt Ieſus, &amp; he that was mediator of redemption, ſhould alſo be mediatour of interceſſion. To diuide theſe thē, is to make the bodie not anſwere to the ſhadowe, neither the truth to the figure, which may not be. For looke whatſoeuer was typically ſhewed Chriſt ſhould do, that hath he truelie done and performed, and to affirme otherwiſe is great impietie. Thirdly, theſe two are both duties of the mediatour, and in truth none can be a mediator, vnleſſe he performe both theſe things, namely both redemption and interceſſion. Now of two duties or partes of the office of a mediatour, ſhall we make two ſorts of mediators. Truely it is euen

all one, as if becauſe man conſiſteth of bodie and ſoule, as of two partes that make but one whole, we ſhould ſay there are two ſortes of men, one conſiſting of bodie, another of ſoule, which were a trimme ſpeech. Or agayne, becauſe the Prince hath power ouer body and goods, and they both are incident to the prerogatiue of his kinglie office, therfore of two things belonging to one perſon, we ſhould make a diſtinction of perſons, &amp; ſay, there are two ſorts of Princes, one hauing power ouer body, and an other hauing authoritie ouer goods. For euen ſo it is in this matter of a mediator, whoſe office conſiſteth in both theſe duties, as parts of the ſame, to redeeme the people and to make interceſſion for them. Remember alſo in the ſcripture before named, how vtterly Saint Auſten diſliked that Parmenian yt heriticke, who in a certaine place made the Biſhoppe a mediator betwixt God and the people, and how he ſayd that if Saint Iohn ſhould haue done ſo, no man would haue abid him, neither haue looked vpon him as vpon an Apoſtle of Chriſt, but as vpon a very Antichriſt, Truely Parmenian neuer thought the Biſhop was a mediator

of redemption or ſaluation, and therfore euen there, by that learned father Auguſtine, is moſt plainely ouerthrowne this fooliſh diſtinction which we ſpeak of. Laſtly conſider the Scriptures of God, &amp; tremble to reſiſt a trueth maliciouſly when it is playne. Doth not the Apoſtle ſay, we haue boldnes,
               
                  Epheſ. 3.12.
                
               and entrance with confidence by faith in him. If in any place it can bee truely ſhewed that wee haue ſuch entrance by any other, finde it out, if not, thinke of it. Conſider aduiſedly of the 7. and 9. Chapters to the Hebrewes,
                  Hebre. 7. &amp; 9.
                and ſee how ſtrongly it is prooued that theſe two offices of redemption and interceſſion are ioyned, and ſo that the dignitie, power, and efficacie of Chriſtes interceſſion dependeth vpon the merits of his redemption.
                  Chap. 7.25.
                Marke howe he ſayth it of Chriſt, that hee euer liueth to make interceſſion for his. Find you where Saints or Angels liue to make interceſſion for vs. Againe,
                  Hebre. 9.24.
                that Chriſt is entred into the very heauens, to appeare now in the ſight of God for vs: ſhewe you the like of other mediators.
                  Hebre. 7.28.
                That Chriſt by the very oth of God is appoynted to this office for his children. Shew you where God by oth

hath ioyned others in commiſſion with him Conſider with your ſelfe how comfortable a promiſe it is of Chriſt,
                  Ihon. 16.
                that whatſoeuer we aſke the father in his name we ſhal haue it. Surely if other were fellowes with him in mediation of interceſſion, we ſhould haue like promiſe, that whatſoeuer we aſke in their names we ſhould receiue it, but this is not ſo, and therefore a great difference betwixt our comfort that aſke in Chriſtes name, and theirs that aſke in other names. I am the doore,
               
                  Ihon. 10.
                ſaith our Sauiour Chriſt, by me if any man enter in, he ſhalbe ſaued, and ſhall go in, and go out, and find place, I am the way, the trueth and the life,
               
                  Ihon. 14.
                
               No man commeth to the Father, but by me. Which were meerely falſe, if there were many mediators of interceſſion. For then ſo many mediators, ſo many meanes to come vnto God. Finally conſider it euen with your heart, that in the very place where hee ſayth, there is one mediator,
               
                  1. Tim. 2. verſ. 1. &amp; 5.
                
               and that Chriſt, hee ſpeaketh of prayer, ſupplication and interceſſion, and therefore moſt fully ſatiſfieth any Chriſtian conſcience that euen of that there is but one contrary to this vayne and fooliſh diſtinction.

Wherefore let the fruit of all this bee a reformed iudgement, foraſmuch as prayer to God alone by Chriſt hath warrant &amp; comfort, and the other hath none, but when God ſhal awake vs, moſt fearefull diſcomfort, being a plaine and dreadful robbery of God of his true and due honor. If you can finde as playne proofes and proppes to your conſcience that others bee ioyned in this authoritie and office with Chriſt to make interceſſion for vs, as nowe you haue ſeene that Chriſt is, then hearken to them, but if not, thinke vpon your God that ſhed his precious blood for you, and he that hath ſo loued you, and done ſo much for you, grudge him not his due glory, neither match his creatures with him cheeke by cheeke, without good warrant, for hee is a iealous God of his honour, and hath plainly told vs that his glory he will not giue to another. Think vpon your owne poore ſoule the greateſt iewell that euer God committed to you, ſpill it not, kill it not by pulling it from the life of all ſoules Chriſt Ieſus. And bee you euen fully reſolued, that if the Angels or Saintes appearing or liuing in this world would neuer ſuffer their felowe

ſeruants to pray vnto them,
                  Apoc. 19.10.
                ſurely now in heauen they like it not, but would haue you only cleaue to Chriſt.
            For what things may we pray.
            
               
                  1. Timo. 2.1.
               
               I exhort, ſaith the Apoſtle, that ſupplications,
               
                  Iam. 5.13.16.
                
               prayer, interceſſions, and giuing of thankes bee made for all men.
               
                  Math. 5.44.
                
               For kings, and for all that are in authoritie, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godlines and honeſtie,
               
                  Ro. 12.14.
                
               for this is good and acceptable in the ſight of God our Sauiour. And againe, whatſoeuer ye ſhall do in word or deede, doe all in the name of the Lorde Ieſus, giuing thanks to God, euen the father by him, with many other places.
                  Iuſtinus. Tertul. Clemens. Auguſtin. &amp;c.
                
               Chriſoſtome in his Liturgie and others haue prayers then vſually of the Church publiquely made, for ſeaſonable weather, fertilitie of the groūd, peace and quietnes, for ſuch as traueiled by land or by water, for them that were ſicke, priſoners, or captiues, for Biſhops and people, for infidels and heretiques, and ſuch like. In concluſion, wee are warranted to call vpon the Lord our moſt mercifull God for whatſoeuer is requiſite either to body or ſoule,
                  1. Tim. 4.8.
                this life, or the eſtate to come.

Which being more particularly laid down by Chriſt himſelfe in this prayer folowing, neede not nowe ſo much to bee ſtood vpon.
            Something alſo of the place of prayer, if you will.
            As prayer it ſelfe either is priuate or publique, ſo is the place, both alowed and commended in the word: of the firſt our Sauiour ſpeaketh, when he ſayth: be not as the hypocrites,
               
                  Math. 6.5
                
               for they loue to ſtand in the Synagogues, and in the corners of the ſtreetes, becauſe they would be ſeene of men. Verely I ſay vnto you they haue their reward. But when thou prayeſt, enter into thy chamber, and when thou haſt ſhut thy doore, pray to thy Father which is in ſecret, and thy father which ſeeth in ſecret ſhall reward thee openly. Here by chamber are ment al priuat places whatſoeuer, which the godly drawe themſelues into: to make their priuat prayer, It being nowe lawfull to pray euery where &amp; in all places, lifting vp pure handes without wrath or doubting, and no need to ſeeke out Temples,
                  1. Tim. 2.8.
                Churches or Chappels halowed by men, as though no prayer were good but there. Whether we bee at home

or abroad, in the Citie or in the Countrey, in our ſhops working, or in our beds lying, whither we bee ſitting, ſtanding walking, by day or by night, earely or late God is preſent and heareth, and accepteth the prayers of any faithfully made, and in mercy he hath made and conſecrated our bodies temples for the holy ghoſt. A great mercy and litle thought of, yt we are not tied to any places. For then might our ſtreits haue bene ſuch that we could not come at them, and ſo conſequently not haue bene able to pray to God his liking, whereas now it is not, but whereſoeuer we are, we maydoe it if we neede, in bed ſicke, in priſon bound, in perſecution feared, and driuen into holes, ſo that wee cannot come at the publique places, we may pray and comfortably pray, aſſured that euen in all theſe places and others, whatſoeuer our prayers made in faith, come before the Lord as incenſe, and the lifting vp of our handes is as an euening ſacrifice. Of publique place and praiers,
                  Pſal. 14.1.
                all thoſe appoyntments of God of aſſemblies both in the lawe and the Goſpell, and his childrens carefull and diligent kéeping of the ſame.

                  Eſay. 56.7. Ihon. 2.16.
                and the houſe of prayer. And the old father is not afrayde to ſay thus of them. Non aequè exoras,

               cùm ſolus Dom. obſecras, atque cum fratribus tuis. Eſt enim in hoc plus aliquid, videlicet, concordia, conſpiratio, copula aemoris &amp; charitatis, &amp; Sacerdotum clamores. Praeſunt enim ob eam rem ſacerdotes, vt populi orationes, quae infirmiores per ſe ſunt, validiores illas complexae ſimul in coelos euehantur. Thou doeſt not ſo ſoone obtaine thy deſire when thou prayeſt alone vnto the Lord, as when thou prayeſt with thy brethren. For herein there is ſomewhat more, the concorde, the conſent, the ioyning of loue and charitie, &amp; the crye of the Prieſts. For to that end the Prieſtes are made ouerſeers, that they being the ſtronger ſort, may take with them the weake prayers of the people, and carie them vp into heauen. Againe,
                  Chryſoſt. in 2. Theſſ. Hom. 4.
                  
                
               Quod quis apud ſe ipſum precatus accipere non poterit, hoc cum multitudine precatus accipiet. quare? quia etiam ſi non propria virtus, tamen concordia multum poteſt. The thing that ae man can not obtaine praying by himſelfe alone, praying together with the multitud he ſhall obtaine. And why ſo? for although

not his owne worthines, yet the concorde &amp; vnitie preuaileth much. This concorde and vnitie in prayer is a goodly thing, and make a ſhrill ſhrike in the Lordes eare. S. Hierom did liken it to a thunderclap, Baſil to the roaring of the Sea. And by playne experience we knowe, that if one ſtring of an inſtrument make a ſounde, many ſtringes make a greater ſound, if one ſticke make a fire, many ſtickes make a greater, and an hoater fire. This true and good conſideration made euer the godly haue a ſpeciall care to frequent the publique places of prayer: that if themſelues were dull, yet euen the company of others might ſtirre them vp, and they in common place might receyue the bleſſing of common prayer. Peter and Iohn went together into the Temple to pray.
                  Act. 3.1.
                And Dauid remembring howe hee had wont to lead the people to the houſe of God,
                  Pſal. 42.
                and haue a multitude followe by his good example, when he was baniſhed from that comfort, and wanted that helpe ſo good againſt wants, he ſayd his heart was ready to breake within him, and the griefe was very great. A moſt notable place for al men to thinke of, to ſtirre them vp to frequent

places of prayer, and eſpecially for great men, whoſe examples preuaile ſo mightily either to good or euill. The companies wil aſſemble, if they come, &amp; folow them carefully. As they did Dauid: and that obedience of many ſhalbe their crowne and true comfort, euen as it was Dauids: What thinke you, if in his exile ſo grieuous &amp; bitter, Dauids cōſcience had cried alſo againſt him, and ſaid, Thou neuer when thou hadſt peace and libertie caredſt for publique méetings at prayer and Sacraments, thou neuer gaueſt any good example this way to the multitude that watched what thou diddeſt and depended vpon thée, but if thou diddeſt pray, it was ſecrete by thy ſelfe when thou ſhouldeſt haue beene with the congregation, and therefore ſince God gat no honour by thee, nor obedience of his people by thy zealous forwardnes to goe before them and to leade them to the houſe of praier, therfore now the Lord hath layd thy honour in the duſt and rayſed vp euill againſt thee. Doe you thinke it woulde not nippe? yes truely more then all his wo beſide, for there is no torment to a conſcience iuſtly accuſing. Wherefore nowe it ſhoulde bee

thought of by all nobles and gentlemen &amp; women, the markes that ignoraunt people frame themſelues vnto, that if euer the Lord ſhould do with vs, as with Dauid, or caſt vs in the bed of ſicknes, or any way let vs that we could not go, yet with Dauid wee might teſtifie with great comfort what had bene, although then grieued as he, that it was not ſo ſtill.
                  Confeſſ. 19.13.
                  
                
               Auſten was rauiſhed with the ſongs of the Church and congregation met together, and euen wept in ſpirituall comfort conceiued by that ſweete conſent and heauenly matter, ſo ioyntly, and with ſuch order and power made and vttered to God in publique meetings. And who hath not felt his heart moued in a congregation? Wherefore once againe let theſe thinges work to a great regard of publique Church aſſemblies at times appoynted. For the ſanctifying of the Sabboth requireth it, if there were no more. And take heede of exceptions, for they are moſt dangerous againſt a thing ſo renowmed in the woorde and ſo carefully obſerued euer of the godly. It is eaſie to deceiue our ſelues with a ſhew of truth, if there be not euen a conſcience to ſuſpect a plea before that is made againſt

the trueth. Many thinges might bee here touched, but who is wiſe will conſider what is openly touched, and beware.
            
               Yet one thing more I pray you aunſwer me in this matter, and that is concerning the dead: may they bee prayed for of vs after they are departed?
            
            No in deede, vnleſſe we will preſume in zeale and affection aboue any warrant of the worde of God, and ſo pull vpon vs (as wee haue heard before) both ſinne and the rewarde therof. For we haue no commandement any where to doe it, being yet expreſſely commanded to pray for the liuing, and to doe ſuch dueties alſo for the dead as are fit and allowable, as to burie them, to mourne moderatly for them, and ſo as may become men and women that haue hope of their reſurrection and life eternall, to bee faithfull performers of their laſt willes, and ſuch like: Wee haue no example of any in the Canonicall Scripture that euer did it: wee haue no promiſe to be heard if we doe it: no puniſhment threatned if wee doe it not. And is not this a great nakedneſſe of an action to haue none of all theſe: yea ſuch a nakedneſſe as ſhould touch and preſſe any

man or woman liuing that deſire to pleaſe God by true and right obedience? Truely it is. And we are not able to name any one thing that God hath in good liking to haue his children doe, but it either hath all or the moſt of theſe. It hath a commaundement, it hath a promiſe, it hath example, it hath puniſhment threatned if not done, &amp;c. Wherefore let vs conſider it, and not be caried away with vayne ſhiftes. We vſe to ſay, we doe it for good will, and if it doe them no good it doth them no harme. But is there any true goodwill which is not allowed by God? Should not his liking and allowance bee the rule and guide of vs and all our doings? If then we can finde where hee biddeth vs ſhewe our goodwill in this ſorte, vſe it and feare not: if we cannot, neuer thinke that is goodwill which wanteth the Lordes ſtampe vpon it, vnleſſe you will affirme that GOD condemneth good dueties to our Brethren, which God forbid. Then conſider againe, that albeit it neither hurt nor profite them, yet in truth it hurteth vs that doe it, both becauſe it is an action without warrant, and therefore not of faith, and ſo ſinne: and

becauſe alſo it confirmeth and proppeth vp that lewd opinion of Purgatorie, ſo derogatorie to the truth of God &amp; the comfort of his children. Therefore if we will ſhewe goodwill to our friendes departed, let vs ſpeake of them as men and women in the hands of God, and in ſuch comfort as that they neede not any prayers of vs, departed in a true faith, and therfore now poſſeſſors of the promiſe, euen of ſuch ioyes as no eye hath ſeene, no eare hath heard, neither any hart bene able to conceiue of. For thus to hope of them is like friendes to hope of them, and thus to ſpeake hurteth not our ſelues. Our phraſes may be as eaſely, God hath had mercie on him I truſt, as GOD haue mercie on him, he is with GOD I hope, he is at reſt from his labours, he hath finiſhed his courſe: or any ſuch like. If wee will a little at firſt labour to forget a bad cuſtome when it ſeeketh to come vpon our tongues ſo readily: Then for the place in the Machabees,
               
                  2. Machab. 12.44.
                our anſwer firſt toucheth the books, and then the matter. The bookes we except againſt, as not Canonicall, that is, of authoritie to build our faith and obedience vpon: and the reaſons of our ſo doing,

are ſuch, as neuer haue, neither can bée truely anſwered by any aduerſarie. I pray you let it not greeue you both to heare thē, and very diligently to marke them. Firſt the holy Ghoſt neuer vſeth to epitomiſe, contract, and prophane mens workes and writings, but is able of himſelfe to write and lay downe whatſoeuer may be profitable for his Church, and ſo hath euer done. But ye ſecond booke of Machabees,
               
                  2. Machab. 2.29.
                whence this place for Prayer for the dead is taken, is an abridgement wholly out of the fiue bookes of Iaſon the Cirenian, as the author himſelfe confeſſeth: and therefore not a writing or booke of the holy Ghoſt.
                  2. Machab. 15.39.
                Secondly, the Author of this booke craueth pardon for his wants, and ſaith it is aſwell as he was able to doe: but thus neuer the holy Ghoſt at any mans hands. For how ſhould God craue pardon of man, and ſay it is as well as he was able to doe? Therefore this moſt mightely and euidently, vnleſſe we ſhut our eyes and ſtoppe our eares againſt the truth, telleth vs, this booke is not as the reſt of the Scriptures, whereon we ſafely ſtay our ſelues. Thirdly, in the writings of the holy Ghoſt there are no

contrarieties euer, but in theſe bookes there are: and therefore no Scripture by inſpiration from the holy Ghoſt.
                  Machab. 9.18. An. 152.
                Wil you thinke of ſome of them. In the firſt booke it is ſaid of Iudas that hee was ſlaine of Bacchides his armie, and that Ionathas and Simon his brethren buried him in his fathers Sepulcher in the Citie of Modin,
               
                  An. 188. 2. Maca. 1.10.
                and all the Iſraelites wept for him, &amp;c. In the ſecond booke he is aliue againe, and writeth letters 36. yeeres after he was dead. Can both theſe be true? If not, then marke the credite of this booke. Not vnlike to this is that which is written of Antiochus his death. In the firſt booke it is ſayd,
                  1. Maca. 6.8.
                he laide him downe vppon his bed ſicke, and there dyed: with ſuch circumſtances of the matter as there you may reade and ſee your ſelfe. In the ſecond booke and firſt Chapter it is ſayd, that he entring the temple of Nanea,
               
                  verſ. 16.
                the Prieſtes opened a priuie doore of the Vaute and caſt downe ſtones like Thunder vpon him and his companie, and bruſed them in peeces, cut off their heades and threw them out to the reſt of their companie that were without. In the 9. Chapter of the ſame booke it is ſayd, he dyed a

miſerable death among the mountaines. Theſe be greater contrarieties thā I truſt any man, that feareth GOD, will thinke may be in bookes whereof the holy Ghoſt is author. And therefore you ſee wee doe not without great cauſe refuſe to learne our faith out of theſe Bookes. If mens iudgements bee regarded of vs, we heare and ſee what the Fathers thought. Hierom, Epiphan, Athanaſius, and Cyprian reiect theſe bookes in this ſorte, as not to be rules of faith. Yea, the Biſhop of Rome himſelfe Gregorie 200. yeeres after Auſten reiecteth them as not Canonicall:
                  Greg. in Iob. lib. 19. cap 16.
                and if other men be of ſmall regard with them, yet would GOD the Papiſtes would reſpect their owne Biſhop. But Auſten, they ſay, affirmeth them Canonicall. O why ſhould not loue of truth baniſh all cauilles? Auſten doth ſo: and in the very ſame place that they alleage, ſayth the contrary. How then is Auſten contrary to himſelfe? No, their owne eyes ſee as well as we, if they will, that when he calleth them not Canonicall, he taketh the worde ſtrictly and properly, and meaneth they are no groundes and rules for our faith: when hee calleth

them Canonical, he taketh the word largely, and meaneth they are ſuch as may bee read in the Churches for examples of the great and marueilous paſſions and perſecutions of the Martyrs. Beleeue not me, but heare himſelfe. Firſt, that they are not Canonicall. In Machabaeorum libris, &amp;c. Although there may ſome thing bee found in the bookes of the Machabees meete for this order of writing, and worthie to bee ioyned with the number of miracles, yet hereof wee will haue no care: for that wee haue intended only to touch a ſhort rehearſall of the miracles contayned in the bookes of holy Canon. See how he ſaith, they are not Canonicall, and therefore hée will not accept of the miracles in them. Againe, Haec ſupputatio non in ſcripturis ſanctis, quae appellantur Canonicae, ſed in alijs inuenitur, in quibus ſunt &amp; Machabaeorum libri. This reckoning is not founde in the holie Scriptures that are called Canonicall, but in certaine other bookes, among which are the bookes of the Machabees. Many ſuch teſtimonies might bee alleadged out of this Father, but theſe ſuffice in this treatiſe. Now that they are Canonicall,

heare himſelfe againe. Libros Machabaeorum eccleſia habet pro canonicis, propter quorundam Martyrum paſſiones vehementes atque mirabiles. The Church accompteth the bookes of the Machabees as canonicall, (not for the aucthoritie and weight of trueth) but for the great and meruailous paſſions, and perſecutions of Martyrs therein contained. And againe, that ſcripture that beareth the name of the Machabees, is receiued not vnprofitably of the Church, ſo that it be read and heard with ſobrietie, ſpecially becauſe of thoſe Machabées that ſuffered ſo cruell torments for the law of God. Wherfore by his owne words now on both ſides repeated, Auguſtines minde is playne, namely that theſe bookes alleadged in proofe of faith, they are not Canonicall, but to be read vnto the people in the Church for example of life, in this ſence ſaith hee, they are Canonicall, and may be thus read, ſo that they be read ſoberlie. And what is this, but that which other Fathers haue alſo ſaide, as Ierome. The Church readeth the ſtorie of Iudith, the booke of Tobie, and the bookes of the Machabees, but ye ſame Church receiueth

not theſe bookes as the Canonicall Scriptures. Cyprian, Haec omnia legi quidem in eccleſijs voluerunt, nō tamen proferri ad authoritatem ex his fidei confirmandam.
                All theſe writings our Fathers haue allowed to be reade in the Church, yet not to be aleadged for authoritie, to confirme the doctrine of our faith. Wherefore to goe no further, in this you ſee our reaſons, why wee allow not any proof of doctrine out of thoſe bookes, and therefore not of prayer for the deade. Other reaſons moe are aleadged by the godlie learned, and 
                  •
               ight by mee now, but that theſe ſuffice here.
            Next, our anſwere toucheth the matter it ſelfe, and we ſay that prayer for the dead, ſought to be proued out of this place of the Machabees, is contrarie to the reſt of the Scriptures, and therefore we dare not allowe it. For no trueth and lawfull thing is contrarie to any Scripture, but agreeable, as receiuing warrant, and lawfulnes thence. Secondlie, that though Iudas had ſo done (which is not likelie he did, howſoeuer this place hath béene corrupted to that ende, becauſe it is contrarie to the cuſtome of the Iewes, euen to this day, to pray for

the deade) yet this particular example is not ſufficient to eſtabliſh a doctrine, no more then Zipporalis was to prooue, that women may adminiſter the Sacraments, or the example of Razis, that one might kill himſelfe, whome this author ſo much commendeth. And therefore concluding, ſince neyther by this place, nor by anye Scripture, this prepoſterous loue to the dead, to pray for them, can finde ſure warrant, wee deſire that it may hartelie bee thought of, how ill it becommeth any that profeſſe a deſire to pleaſe God, which commaunded obedience, and not with traditions of men, or deuices any whatſoeuer, either of their owne heades, or of any others. And thus much of it.
            
               Sufficient then beeing ſayde of theſe circumſtaunces of Praier, will you now proceed to the forme it ſelfe preſcribed of our Sauiour.
            
            
               
                  A great goodnes of God to teach vs a forme of prayer.
               Content. And firſt conſider what a gracious goodneſſe this was in the Lorde our God, to laie downe a forme for vs. That we not able to ſee the bottom of our wants our ſelues, neyther in what wee doe ſee, to take ſuch courſe as becommeth ſpeakers to

ſo great a GOD, by his owne mouth wee might be directed both in the one and the other, to our great comfort and aſſuraunce, that keping our ſelues within the compaſſe of this forme, our prayer ſhoulde bee to the Lordes good liking, and therefore wee obtaine what we aſke, according to his will. Without a forme we might haue wandred to our greate harme, aſking many times things hurtfull, &amp; if not ſo, yet things lawful, not in forme lawful, which alſo had ben euill. And if Heathens ſaw the nakedneſſe of men for want of ſuch direction, lette vs Chriſtians ſee Gods mercie and our owne great good by this directiō. Plato we know eſpying the ignoraunce of men in making their prayers to God, for that many times they ſought, what graunted woulde hurt them, ſayd this was a good fourme:
                  What forme ſome heathēs vſed.
                
               O Iupiter Rex, optima nobis et vouentibus, et non vouentibus, tribuae. Mala autem poſcentibus quo
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   abeſſe iube. That is▪ O Iupiter king, giue vnto vs the beſt things, whether wee aſke them or no. And all euill things command awaie from vs, though we aſke them. Wherein we may ſee howe daungerouſly they groped in a great darkneſſe for

want of a forme, and were faine for ſafetie to praie thus generally, whereas we nowe plainly are taught how to praie more particularly, and yet ſtill truly. Wherfore ſee, I ſay, 
                  ••
               rſt Gods great mercie, &amp; our great good, by hauing this forme layed down vnto vs. Then touching the forme it ſelfe which our Sauiour hath layed downe,
                  The Lords prayer hath three parts.
                it conſiſteth of three principall partes. Firſt of a preface, ſecondly of the petitions themſelues, and laſtly of a concluſion. The preface in theſe wordes: Our Father which art in heauen. The petitions in order after. The concluſion thus, for thine is the kingdome, the power and the glory, for euer &amp; euer, Amen. The firſt part which is the Preface, ſhort in wordes, but plentifull in matter, is ſo layd downe by the wiſdom of the Lord Ieſus, as that euery word carryeth his waight,
                  A father by
                  
                     
                        Creation.
                     
                     
                        Redē
                           ption.
                     
                     
                        Sāctificatiō
                        
                     
                  
                  The vſe of the word father to our Soules.
                and bringeth to vs in vſe thereof moſt ſingular profite. The firſt is, Father, by which name we are taught to ſpeake vnto our God when wee pray vnto him: and ſee the vſe. There is no prayer as we well know, and before hath bene declared, that can pearce the eares of the almightie God, vnleſſe it be made both in affection

and faith. Affection hath his want great &amp; too great often in our corruption, &amp; therefore in mercy of a gracious GOD, helpes and meanes prouided for it. This is one euermore to conſider to whome I pray, and to whome I ſpeak, namely, not to a ſeuere and ſower Iudge, not to a cruell and mercileſſe tyrant, not to a ſtranger that knoweth me not, or hath no aliance with me, but to a Father, yea in Ieſus Chriſt nowe my Father, a kinde, a louing, a good, a tender Father, who looketh vpon me with bowels of mercy and pittie, ſigheth for me before I come, runneth out when I doe come, meeteth me, embraceth mee, falleth about my necke with his armes, wéepeth vpon me in melting motions of louing kindneſſe, heareth me ſpeake, weigheth my ſute, whether it may be my good, &amp; can as ſone in concluſion ceaſe to be God as denie me any thing yt may be my benefite. And O then ye affection yt we may pray with, if we cōſider this name of Father. My ſoule may thirſt, my heart may long, yea burne and burſt as it were within me, wt deſire euer to come to my Father, for he is euer a Father, &amp; hath euer the nature of his name, though I bee

vile. And therfore let vs take the vſe intended by the Lord in this giuen title, &amp; praie cheerefully with ſweete comfort in the conceit of whome wee ſpeake vnto euermore. When affection then is thus kindled and ſtirred vp, looke at faith in the next place, which alſo muſt concurre with it, or elſe in vaine we praie and obtaine nothing. This knew our Sauiour well,
                  The ſecond vſe of the woord father.
                and therfore euen to this end alſo hath taught vs to ſaie, and praie in the name of Father. Whereby ariſeth in vs, and ought euermore an aſſurance of his willingneſſe and readineſſe to help vs. For what will a Father denie vnto his begging childe that may doe him good, pater quid negabit filijs, qui iam dedit, quod pater eſt. What will that Father denie to ſonnes, which hath alreadie granted this, to be their Father. Yea, ſuch a father as being not our father, hath redeemed vs to him, his vtter enimies, with no leſſe price than the precious bloud of his owne and onely deere beloued ſonne?
                  Rom. 8.32.
                O how ſhall he with him not giue vs al things alſo.
                  Math. 7.11.
                If we which are euil, yet in the nature of fathers, giue good giftes to our children, how much more ſhall our Father which is in heauen

giue good things to them that aſke him. Can a woman forget her child, and not haue compaſsion of the ſonne of her wombe? Though it coulde bee,
               
                  Eſay. 49.15.
                
               yet will not I forget thee.
               
                  verſ. 16.
                
               Behold I haue gtauen thee vpon the palmes of my handes, thy walles are euer in my ſight. Iudge then the willingneſſe of the Lorde euermore, to grant our profitable praiers, and be ſtrengthened in fayth by this word Father.
               
                  Ambroſ. lib 50. de Sacram. cap. 4.
                  
                
               Primus ſermo quantae ſit gratiae vide, et ſuauitatis, O homo: faciem tuam nō audebas ad coelum attollere, oculos tuos in terram dirigebas, et ſubitò accepisti gratiam Chriſti, ex malo ſeruo factus es bonus filius. Non ergo hîc arrogantia eſt, ſed fides. Praedicare quod acceperis, non eſt ſuperbia, ſed deuotio. The firſt worde of Prayer, of what grace and ſweetneſſe it is, O man ſee and conſider. Thou durſt not lift thy face to heauen, but threw thine eyes downe to the earth, and ſodeinly thou receiuedſt mercie in Chriſte of an euill ſeruant to be made a good ſonne. Heere is no arrogancie, but faith. And to publiſh abroade what thou haſt receiued, is no pride, but deuotion, ſayde the godly Father Ambroſe.
            
            
               
               
                  A third vſe of the word father.
               A third vſe of this worde Father is, to put vs in mind alſo of the dutie of children, for we may not thinke, that we calling him daily by this tender name of mercy and fauour, and expecting at his hands the fruits of ſuch nature as his name importeth, wee in the meane time looſely and lewdly may behaue our ſelues, and neyther before God nor man, walking as children yet fooliſhlie feede our ſelues with the hope of childrens benefites from their Father. There is no ſuch matter if we take that courſe, but euen as often as we open our mouths and praie this prayer, ſo often euen of our owne mouthes the Lord ſhall iudge vs that wee calling him Father, yet liue not, nor deſire to liue in the duties of his children. O fearefull chaunge of a ſweete name to a dreadfull witneſſe of woe vnto vs. Saie then O Father, but doe or indeauour to do the office of a childe. For it is paſſed from him, and lyeth before vs to ſtand till heauen and earth periſh, he expecteth it, and we are commaunded it:
                  Malach. 1.
                
               If I bee your Father where is my honor: if I be your maiſter where is my feare. And therefore wel ſaid the godly Father,
                  Cypria.
                
               Quemadmodum nobii

placemus de Deo patre, ſic ſibi placeat et Deus de nobis. As we take pleaſure of GOD to be our Father, ſo let vs doe, as he alſo may take pleaſure of vs to be his children. Yea, well ſayth the worde which wee muſt neuer forget,
                  1. Peter. 1.13.
                
               Gird vp the loynes of your minde, bee ſober, and truſt perfectlie on the grace that is brought vnto you by the reuelation of Ieſus Chriſt, as obedient children,
               
                  14.
                
               not faſhioning your ſelues vnder the former luſt of your ignorāce,
               
                  15.
                
               but as hee which hath called you is holie,
               
                  17.
                
               ſo be you holy in all manner of conuerſatiō. And if he cal him father, which without reſpect of perſons iudgeth according to euery mans worke, paſſe the time of your dwelling here in feare, &amp; ſo forth to the end of the chapter. And the Apoſtle Paule in lyke maner.
                  Epheſ. 4.1.
                
               I therfore being priſoner in the Lord praie you that ye walke worthy of the vocation whervnto ye are called. With many other ſuch places. And certainly it is true, our ſinfull ſoules ſhall one daie rew the proofe of it, if it be not warned:
                  Ihon 9.31.
                
               God heareth not ſinners, but if a man bee a worſhipper of God, and doth his will, him heareth he.
               
Yea, therefore marke it with a minde and a conſcience carefull to performe the lyke euermore. How both Dauid perſwadeth ye Lord to heare him, and ſtrengtheneth himſelf in aſſurāce to be heard by performance of the dutie of a childe to him whom he calleth in his praier his Father,
                  Pſal. 119.
                eyther before or after. Before in theſe places: Saue me for I haue ſought thy precepts.
               
                  94.
                And againe,
                  173.
                
               Let thy hand ſaue mee, for I haue choſen thy precepts. And in the laſt verſe of that Pſalme, Seeke thy ſeruaunt, for I doo not forget thy commaundements. With ſuch lyke ſpeeches many. Afterwarde as appeareth in the 145. verſe. Heare me O Lord, and I will keepe thy ſtatutes. By which practiſe of the Saint of GOD wee may make this aſſured, but dreadful concluſion, that Father in mouth, and Sonne without ſenſe in lyfe,
                  Note.
                maketh him of a Father a Iudge, and tourneth his fauour into furie, his pittie into plagues, and our hoped health in heauen, into aſſured woe in hell for euermore. Therefore againe and againe, let vs take this profit of this word Father, euen to reforme vs daily as the Lord ſhal ſtrengthen into the obedience

of children. So ſhall wee ſaie in comfort with Saint Iohn:
               
                  1. Iohn. 3.22.
                
               Whatſoeuer wee aske we receiue of him, becauſe we kepe his commaundementes, and doo thoſe things which are pleaſing in his ſight. Yet doe we no waie ſtrengthen the errour of merite heereby, but teſtifying hereby our ſelues in truth, not in a lying name and ſhew only, the children of God, both pleaſe the Lorde with the obedience of faith, and comfort our ſelues in truth of promiſes altogether free, made by a good Father vnto the ſame.
            A fourth fruite agayne may be of this worde Father in this beginning,
                  The fourth vſe of the word father.
                euen to proue vnto the conſciences of the whole world the ſufficiencie and perfection of the worke of Chriſt for vs. For by which God is ſo fully pacified and pleaſed; ſo contented and ſatiſfied, as that of a Iudge to puniſh, he becommeth a Father to fauour, and we of enimies, ſonnes and fellow heires with Chriſt, that is abſolute, perfect and euerie waie full. But by the worke of Chriſt for vs this is done, and wee in the knowledge thereof bee ſo euen by the ſame Chriſte commaunded, not in the ſpirit of feare, but

of faith and comfort boldly to call him Father. Therefore the worke of Chriſt for vs moſt perfect,
                  The perfection of the worke of Chriſt for vs prooued.
                glorious, and abſolute. This giueth faith for feare, this giueth hope of ſafetie from the power of all foes. From the ſtrength of the lawe, from the ſting of death, from the victorie of the graue, and from the maineſt might of al the kingdome of hell that can be rayſed agaynſt vs. For we are iuſtified, yea, fully iuſtified, and who or what can nowe condemne vs, wee are ſonnes, and who can make vs agayne ſeruants, we are friends, and who can agayne make vs foes, it is nowe my Father and your Father, my God and your God, and what ſtrength of hels ten thouſande canne chaunge this courſe. O worde of comfort then commaunded me by Chriſt to pray in the name of Father. Deere God and ſwéet God, let our ſoules feele it. It is finiſhed, and why are wee feared. Were our ſinnes as Crimſin, as Skarlet, as bloud, they are waſhed, they are wiped, they are gone. Were my wants the wantes of the whole world, they are pardoned, they are forgiuē, God is pleaſed and is now my Father. O Sauiour ſweete, make my thankes many.

Let my tongue, my voyce, my heart, my ſoule, my whole man inward and outward reſound thy laſting praiſe.
                  The wickednes of the Maſſe.
                See ſee theyr ſinne that deuiſe a dayly ſacrifice for ſinne, eyther adding vnto this moſt perfecte redemption as if it wanted, or elſe vainly doing by a worke of will what alreadie is fully done by preſcript of God. Be it that we payed a debt, and yet are troubled for it diuerſe times and wayes againe, muſt we ſo often paie the debt agayne as we are troubled? No, we know it ſufficeth well to recurre euer to the payment once made, and making proofe thereof, we ſtill eſcape ſuch vexing wrongfull action. So it is in this. The vertue, power, and efficacie of this ſacrifice is perpetuall, being once made, and néedeth but by faith to be taken hold of and applied, whenſoeuer we are troubled. The debt is paide, make but the proofe and end this action. For, once hath he entered by his owne bloud vnto the holy place,
               
                  Hebre. 9.12.
                
               &amp; obtained eternall redemption for vs. And with one offering hath hee conſecrated for euer them that are ſanctified.
               
                  10.14.
               
            
            
               Why doe we ſay our Father, and not

my Father.
            
            This worde againe, hath his great reaſon, and profite to vs in this preface. For firſt it teacheth vs Charitie towardes our brethren in generall,
                  1. Charitie.
                whereſoeuer, &amp; whoſoeuer they be, and a care aſwell of their good, as of our own. Which in this great corruption of our nature is hard to be had, vnleſſe we ſhould by ſuch admonitions as this, be drawē vnto it. We rather as borne for our ſelues, liue and care for our ſelues, in ſuch a ſelfe loue, as God and man abhorreth.
                  We muſt neuer pray for our ſelues with ſuch a priuat hart, but that wee wiſh the like mercy to all that haue the like neede. Epheſ. 1 23 Epheſ. 4, 4.
                Wherefore the Lord Ieſus heere commaundeth in this word of community, that we ſhould neuer thinke of our ſelues, neuer pray for our ſelues, but alſo together with our ſelues, for all others, euen the whole Church of God in Earth. For it is the fulneſſe of the body of Chriſt, and therfore by that meanes déere vnto vs, if he be déere. It is that one body whereof we are all members. And the bonde of members ſo ſtrict, that we ſhould feele one an others griefes,
                  Gal. 6.1.
                beare one an others burdens, remember one an others bondes, euen as though we were bounde with them, and them that are in affliction,
                  Hebr. 13.3.
                as if wee were

alſo afflicted in the bodie: yea we are taught in this loue,
                  1. Peter. 4.10.
                euery man as he hath receiued ye gift, to miniſter the ſame one to another, as good diſpoſers of the manifolde graces of God, and by name, to praie one for another.
                  Iam. 5.16. 1. Cor. 13.5.
                For loue neuer ſeeketh her owne things onely. This wee forget too often, and therefore wee fearefully pray without profite. Our hearts are narrow &amp; ſtraight, onely looking at our ſelues &amp; our own, our children and friends: and the deere Saints of GOD, members alſo with vs, are not thought vpon. Alas we iudge it folly to be tolde vs that we ſhould thinke vpon them. And ſinke or ſwim, as we ſay, the Church of God, we care not ſo we be well. This is farre from Our Father, that is, this is far frō that affection that in this word we are taught to all men, and therefore certainelie theſe prayers thus made of vs moſt vſually without remembraunce, care, and deſire of good to all Gods Church as to our ſelues, is no ſweete meat before the Lord, but euen a filthie ſmoake rather that he flyeth from.
                  August. Confeſſ.
                Therefore let vs remember this vſe of this word, if we wiſh to praie aright, and thinking of others in Chriſtian loue

as of our ſelues, intreate the Lord for them as for our ſelues. Beatus qui amat te, et amicum in te, et inimicum propter te. Bleſſed is he that loueth thée, &amp; his friend in thee, &amp; his enimie for thee, ſaith the Father. That is, bleſſed euer he or ſhe yt reach out affection as they ought paſt thēſelues to others. For,
                  Chryſost. in Cor.
                
               Dilectionis flammas Satan ferre non poteſt. The flames of Chriſtian loue &amp; charitie Satan the enimie of our bleſſedneſſe cannot abide. But, Dilectio donum Dei. This loue is the gift of God, &amp; that Lorde then graunt it to vs for euer.
            
               
                  2. Vnitie.
               Secondly, this worde teacheth vs vnitie with our brethren, conſent &amp; agreement of minde in faith and doctrine, and euerie good thing. For how elſe can wee call him Our Father,
               
                  The great danger of ſchiſme.
                wee beeing diuided from the Church and members thereof, by hereſie or ſchiſme. The worde ſhall importe a communion with them in one father, common to all, and our wicked wayward ſeparation of our ſelues from them ſhall denie ye ſame.
                  Math. 5.24. Math. 6.15.
                Therfore be reconciled euer firſt to thy brother, ſaith the ſcripture, before thou pray, or els thy praier doth witnes againſt thy ſelfe.
                  Epheſ. 4.
                
               
                  62.
                And let not the Sunne go downe

vpō thy wrath, if thou mean to pleaſe god.
            Thirdly humilitie is learned by it, not to exalt our ſelues aboue our brethren,
                  3. Humilitie.
                paſt that which is meete, foraſmuch as we haue all one father and ſuch an one as is no reſpecter of perſons. But tenderly minded to all his children. He careth not for the puffes of this worlde, birth, beautie, welth or wit, nor for all the glorie wherewith commonly proud fleſh ſwelleth, but he careth for thoſe that feare him and work righteouſnes, how meane ſoeuer they be. And when the fading faſhion of a tranſitorie condition is cut off by death, the determiner of ſuch pride,
                  Act. 10.
                then they as we with God accepted, as honorable, as wealthy, as beautifull in heauen, where this traſh is trodden vnder foote,
                  Note.
                yea euen more peraduenture honored, as they that haue more honoured him in this life, where wee with our pleaſures played the wantons and vaynely boaſted of a paynted ſheath. There is neither Iewe nor Grecian, there is neither bond nor free,
               
                  Galat. 3.28.
                
               there is neither male nor female but we are al one in Chriſt Ieſus. It is Our Father to the comfort of all hearts that feare his maieſtie. Omnes Chriſtiani fideles diuerſas in

terris habent patres,
               
                  Aug. Ser. 135.
                
               alij nobiles, alij ignobiles: vnum vero patrem inuocant, qui eſt in caelis. Sub iſto Patre ſunt dominus &amp; ſeruus, imperator &amp; miles, diues &amp; pauper. All faithfull Chriſtians here in earth ſayth S. Auſten haue diuers fathers, ſome noble, ſome vnnoble, but they make their prayers but to one father in heauen, and vnder this father is Maſter and ſeruant, Emperour and Souldier, rich and poore. Trueth it is, and ſweete it is to vs poore wretches in this world, vpon whom the magnificous of this earth looke ſo bigge, as if wee neuer ſhoulde bee worthy to wipe their ſhooes, much leſſe accepted as their fellowes, yea peraduēture before them, in a place of greater honor than this ſea of glaſſe here can euer bee. Wherefore let vs ioy in it and remember it to ſchoole our ſelues in our places, euery one to ſhew fauour fit, &amp; due regarde to euery man in this preſent world: the prince to the ſubiect, the Maſter to ſeruant, &amp; euery man &amp; womā, one to another. If I did contemne the iudgement of my ſeruant,
               
                  Iob. 31.
                
               
                  13.
                ſayth holy Iob, or of my mayde when they did contend with mee,
               
                  14.
                
               what then ſhall I doe when God ſtandeth vp,

and when he ſhall viſite me,
               
                  15.
                
               what ſhall I anſwer? He that made me in the womb, hath he not made him? hath not hee alone faſhioned vs in the womb? And receiue him now, ſayth the Apoſtle Paul, not as a ſeruant, but aboue a ſeruant, euen as a brother beloued, &amp; ſo forth. Thus we ſée the chriſtian humility towards al our brethren in this world, yt is noted vnto vs as a thing fit for vs euer, in this word, Our father.
            
            
               But it ſeemeth by this forme that we may not at any time ſay in our prayers. My God or my father, neither yet pray particularly either for our ſelues or any other. But in common euer.
            
            No? you miſtake it. For as this communitie of affection is taught vs, &amp; this prayer that extendeth the deſire to the good of others, ſo is the Scripture full of warrants, alſo for both the particular application of God vnto a mans ſelfe by the terme of my God, and Lord, and Father, and alſo for particular praier for our ſelues and others, Our ſauiour ſayth, my father, the Apoſtle, my God,
               
                  Math. 26.
                the Prophet Dauid in euery Pſalme almoſt,
                  Philem.
                and the prayers of Gods children for themſelues priuatly are extant,

               Dauids, Pauls, Annaes, with many moe. But the matter is this, we ſhould not, neither euer did any of theſe ſo particularly pray for themſelues, or any, but that there was euer in them, although not expreſſed, an eye, to commit by the fruit of their action that thing, either tending to the inabling of thē better to ſerue in gods church, which is a common good, or els as willingly wiſhed, though not in words, yet in truth of meaning to all, to whome it may ſtande in like ſteed, and for as much vſe and good. So are wee but ſpoyled of all filthy ſelfe-loue without care for others, not forbidden to regard our ſelues with like wiſh to others.
            
               Why ſay we next, which art in heauen.
               
            
            Two things in God, our fayth ought euer to be aſſured of, or els we pray not wel, to wit, will to helpe vs, and power. The one hath beene ſufficiently declared in the word Father, the other now in theſe is confirmed vnto vs.
                  His being in Heauen what Spirituall vſe it hath to our ſoules.
                For by his being in heauen appeareth his maieſtie, might and power, his rule &amp; dominion ouer all things whereby he is able to goe through with the purpoſe of his good will towardes vs, that in

nothing our hope of being hearde may bee hindered. I haue ſworne by my ſelfe:
               
                  Eſay. 45.23.
                
               the worde is gone out of my mouth in righteouſnes and ſhall not returne, that euery knee ſhall bow vnto mee, and euery tongue ſhall ſweare by mee. This Lorde of ours reigneth, let the people tremble, hee ſitteth betwixt the Cherubins, let the earth bee moued. This Lorde is great in Sion,
               
                  Pſal. 99.1.
                
               and he is high aboue al people. Let the kinges of the earth band themſelues and the Princes aſſemble together againſt this Lorde, and againſt his anoynted, Let them purpoſe to breake his bands aſunder, and to caſt away his coards from them. Hee that dwelleth in the heauens ſhall laugh them to ſcorne and this powrefull Lord of ours ſhall haue them in deriſion.
                  2.
                When hee purpoſed to doe his Church and children good, who or what could euer reſiſt yt will. Bleſſe he or curſe, proſper or puniſh, giue he or take, whatſoeuer he will, that doth he in heauen &amp; earth and none can let him. His power is almightie, and therefore able euer to performe his will. This is one, the doctrine deliuered vs in theſe words and the vſe of it is great.

For many are the aſſultes of this life, the troubles of the fleſh, and the griefes of our minds, dangerous are the darts of Satan againſt vs often, and wee haue no way to win reliefe, but from the Lorde by prayer: then ſteppeth in the greatnes of the matter, the multitude of enemies againſt it,
                  Note.
                the weakenes of our ſelues in faith, in friendes, in Counſell and meanes, and in concluſion a very impoſſibilitie as it were in reaſon of the thing appeareth. But oh feare auant, &amp; fayth bee ſtrong, for what will wantes in a tender father, or what power to him that dwelleth in the heauens. And wee are purpoſely by Chriſt remembred of both thoſe in this prayer that wee might neuer doubt of either, he is our father and hee is in heauen, that is, he is moſt willing and euer able, thē feare away. This comforted Chriſt in the pride of power againſt him, that euen then his father was able,
                  Math. 26.
                if it pleaſed him, to giue him more then twelue legions of Angels to fight for him againſt them.
                  53.
                And this is written for vs whileſt the world indureth to be our comfort.
                  What God euer would doe, he euer could doe.
                God would deliuer Ioſeph his innocent ſeruant, and hee could doe it, though the credit of falſe report

in reſpect of the accuſer were neuer ſo great. God woulde defend his Daniel and he could doe it againſt all the ſpite of man, and power of roaring beaſtes, ſo great and terrible. God would giue paſſage through the mayne ſea on foote, and hee could in the moment of time performe his will. What ſhould we ſay? Many haue beene the troubles of the righteous and euer the Lorde able to deliuer them out of all. Hee is the ſame yeaſterday and to day, and for euer. And therefore whatſoeuer befalleth vs in this world pray in the comfort of this ſweet conceit, that hee is in heauen, that is, God and Lorde of all, able as willing, and willing as able, &amp; euer both to do vs any good, if we pray: for, feare not the deuill nor death, nor hell, nor man, nor matter euer in this earth, but looke to the power of thy God to defend thee, to helpe and ſuccour thee in all diſtreſſes, and that power ioyned with the will of a Father, whoſe bowelles melt vpon his childe. O God and father ſweete and ſtrong, increaſe our faith, increaſe our feeling, and inlarge our heartes and ſoules to receiue the vſe of theſe things, that aſſured of wil and aſſured of power our praiers

in fayth may pearce thy dwelling place, &amp; win our good on Chriſt for euermore. Amen.
            
               
                  The ſecond vſe of our fathers being in Heauen.
               Secondly theſe words ſerue to lift vp our hearts and minds from all earthly baſe and lowe conceites of the Lorde. Yea euen to ſet vs as it were out of our ſelues and beyonde all remembraunce either of body or ſoule, in our heauenly eleuation of inward powers to that throne ſo high &amp; glorious, the ſeat of that mightie God we pray vnto. And cōſequently to make vs aſke nothing of him that might bee vnſeeming ſo imperiall a maieſtie to deale in and care for. But euer to remember that hee being in heauen, and wee in earth, hee holy and we vnholy, hee glory and we ſhame, hee God, and wee men, it is true that the Prophet ſayth, his thoughts are not our thoughtes, his wayes our wayes.
                  Eſay. 55.
                But as the heauens are mightier then the earth,
                  8.
                ſo are his wayes higher then our wayes,
                  6.
                and his thoughts aboue our thoughtes. To which end it ſerued alſo in the Church of olde as Cyprian witneſſeth, that the Paſtor being about to make publique prayers ſhould cry to thee people Surſum corda. Lift vp your

hearts. And the people did anſwere Habemus ad Dominum. Wee lift them vp vnto the Lorde, thereby declaring that they thought of no baſe and earthly &amp; lowe matters, but of the Lorde and the Lorde in heauen, euen as wee do and are euer taught to do by theſe wordes, Which is in heauen.
            
            Thirdly they ſerue to ſtrike vs not a litle,
                  The third vſe.
                but euer thorow and thorow with a reuerence of his maieſtie whom wee pray vnto. For heauen and the height of heauen is his dwelling place, and we ought moſt earneſtly euer to thinke of it, that wee may come humbly to him. This cauſed the ſeruants of God not only to crouche their bodyes, but to bowe their heartes when they came before him, euen the knees of their hearts, as thinking neuer their reuerence great inough towarde ſo mightie a God. Heauen is his, earth is his, hell is his,
                  Pſal. 50. Pſal. 60.
                al is his. Deuouring fire goeth before his face and mightie tempeſtes are ſtirred vp about him.
                  4.
               
               
                  8.
                He rideth vpon the heauens as it were vpon an horſe,
                  17.
                yea the earth ſhaketh &amp; the heauens drop at the preſence of him. His charets are twentie thouſande, euen thouſands of Angels. It is he that commaundeth

the waters,
               
                  Pſal. 29.3. &amp;c.
                
               it is this glorious God that maketh the thunder. It is hee that ruleth the ſea, it is his voyce that is mightie in operation, yea and a glorious voyce: Such a voyce as breaketh the Cedar trees, yea the Cedars of Libanus: ſuch a voyce as deuideth the flames of fire, and ſhaketh the wildernes, euen the wildernes of Cades. Let vs make haſt therefore with the great ſeruant of God Moſes,
               
                  Exod. 34.8.
                and bow our ſelues to the earth and worſhip, yea let vs in the true conceit and reuerence of this mightie maieſtie, couer as it were our faces with our mantels when we pray vnto him. So ſhall we come before him rightly, and ſhew the vſe of his glorious dwelling in the heauens,
                  A foule fault of many in the Church and elſwhere.
                noted vnto vs. But alas where is it with thouſands thouſands, that yet take thēſelues to be great Chriſtians. We clap our ſelues downe to pray, and we thinke of any thing rather then of the mightie maieſtie of him before whom wee are come, and and therefore we gaze here, and gaze there, wee note this man and that woman, their geſture, their apparell, yea the leaſt toy (eſpecially ſtrange about them.
                  Note.
                And yet wee pray well, we huddle and tumble vp in haſt

the labour of lippes without touch of hart, and the faſter the better, wee long to haue done, for feare dinner bee marred, and yet we pray well. Wee gape and wee yawne, we hem and we hawke, not for neceſſitie of nature which is allowed, but in the drowſines of our Spirits, and to ſhew our authoritie, we are chiefe men in the Church &amp;c. and yet we pray well.
                  A right coming before God to pray.
                But O we ſenceleſſe wretches in this behalfe, for then come we rightly before the Lorde, as we learne here when remembring that hee is in heauen, that is of ſuch glory, maieſtie, and power as hath bene declared, wee throwe downe our ſoules and bodies in al reuerence and comly feare before him, ſpeaking to him as duſt and aſhes to the immortall king of heauen and earth, humbly, euen with a reuerent trembling as it were and affection of al our partes, leaſurely, carefully, heartily,
                  Marke it.
                and with all true properties and teſtimonies of a mind conſidering the puiſſance, the might the glory and imperiall maieſtie of him to whom wee ſpeake. Which whether theſe things that I named declare in vs or no let all chriſtian hearts be iudges. It is too true they conuince vs of the contrary, and therefore

euen in dread of their witneſſe to our wo at the day of doome, let vs leaue them and vſe the place of prayer as we ſhould, in all humble, lowly, and poſſible reuerence. We are ſo willed, and by Chriſt himſelfe, that ſhall iudge vs if wee doe not. To this end wee ſay it, euer thinke of it, which art in heauen.
            
            
               
                  Ihon. 4.
               Laſtly, this notation of the place where our God dwelleth, teacheth vs that our Prayers are not tyed to any certaine place as in olde times, neither bettered by any place, be it this mountaine, or Ieruſalem, or whatſoeuer: But the hower commeth, yea now is,
                  The vſe of Churches not ouerthrown by libertie of place to praye in, vnder the Goſpel
                that the true worſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father in ſpirit and truth, and in euery place haue libertie and leaue to lift vp pure handes to his maieſtie, in euery place, he ſayth, and marke it. And why ſo? For our God is in heauen, and heareth euery where without reſpect of place now. I meane without reſpect of place as then, touching any commaundement from him of particular place, but not hereby to ouerthrowe any ciuill order, for better meeting together in appoynted Churches of Gods people. Yet euen herein beware Superſtition

againe a freſh in reſpect of place more than elſwhere, when true warrant beareth me out as wel there then, as in the Church at other times to make my prayer. But of Churches, and publique meetings there, enough hath bene ſayd before. Where it may be read againe if you will.
            
               Great is the vſe I ſee well of this ſhort preface, ſo often ſaid &amp; ſo little thought of: but now I pray you let mee aſke a queſtion: doth not this inuocation of God by the name of Father, exclude both the other perſons, Sonne, and holie Ghoſt, from both our ſpeech and meaning.
               
                  The name father agreeth to Sonne and holy ghoſt.
               
            
            No indeede: for the name of Father being oppoſed to creatures is taken eſſentially, not perſonally, and agreeth rightly to all the three perſons in Trinitie, being in eſſence, nature and ſubſtance one, and ſo is it here. But if it bee put and ioyned with any other perſon of the Trinitie, then is it not taken eſſentially but perſonally, and agreeth to that perſon onely, and ſo is it not here: for you ſee here in this prayer there is no mention either of Sonne or holy Ghoſt together with this word of Father: which

if there were, then ſhould it bee a name of perſon and not of eſſence: but here is onely mention of Father graunting, and creatures aſking: and therefore Father a name of eſſence comprehending Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt. As it doth diuers times in Scripture.
                  verſ. 6.
                
               Eſay the 9. Chapter calleth Chriſt the euerlaſting Father. The Apoſtle ſayth,
                  1. Cor. 8.6.
                
               Though there be that are called Gods, whether in heauē or in earth, as there bee many Gods, and many Lords, yet vnto vs there is but one God which is that father of whome are all things and wee in him.
               
                  The name father ſet downe becauſe it is principium deitatis, the beginning of the Deitie.
                In which place the name Father includeth Sonne and holy Ghoſt. But the name Father is put downe, becauſe it is the beginning of the Deitie. So in the 14. of Iohn, &amp; elſwhere. Wherefore though wee are taught in this forme of Prayer to ſay Our Father, yet do wee pray to all the three perſons without exception of any, becauſe ſo the name Father includeth.
            
               But the Scripture calleth Chriſt our brother, how is he then our Father?
            
            Very well by diſtinction of two natures: for he his our Father in reſpect of his Godhead,

and hee is our brother by reaſon of manhood.
            
               Yet am I not ſatiſfied. For thus me thinke is reaſon againſt you. He that receiueth vs into fauour for Chriſt, and graunteth our petitions for Chriſt, that is not Chriſt himſelfe. For there is a manifeſt diſtinction of perſons implyed in it: but this father here whom we call father in this Lords Prayer, receiueth vs &amp; heareth vs, and helpeth vs for Chriſt: and therefore this father in this place cannot be Chriſt.
            
            You trouble your ſelfe in an eaſie matter, and you doe not diſtinguiſh as wee needes muſt doe to keepe a truth in theſe cauſes. I tolde you before there are two natures in Chriſt, &amp; diuers ſeuerall things in that one perſon in reſpect of thoſe ſeuerall natures. Now you muſt conſider againe, that in Chriſt there is a nature of Godhead, and an office of a mediatour betwixt God and man, he and his office are ſeuerall things, yet he one Chriſt. Then concerning your maior propoſition, true it is that he that receiueth vs into fauour and heareth and helpeth vs for Chriſt is not

Chriſt himſelfe in that one reſpect, but in an other he is. For Chriſt as mediatour is hee for whome wee are receiued, heard and helped: but as GOD it is he alſo that receiueth, heareth, and helpeth. So doth diſtinction of things ſeuerally to bee conſidered aunſwer your doubt, and leaue Chriſt included in this word and name of Father in this Prayer, aſwell as any other perſon.
            
               Then this nomination of him to bee in heauen, how agreeth it to him that is in euerie place? Dooth it not reſtraine that vbiquitie of his?
               
                  Vbiquitie.
               
            
            No indeede, no more than other ſpeeches in Scripture doth, which yet at the firſt bluſhe ſeeme to doe it, as this dooth. Wherefore that we may vnderſtand both this and them, lette vs remember, that not onely in this Prayer God is ſayd to bee in heauen,
                  Pſal. 103.19 Eſay. 66.1. Num. 14.
                but the Prophet alſo ſaith he hath prepared his ſeate in heauen, &amp; many other places the lyke. Then agayne it is ſayde:
                  42.
                
               Doe not goe vp for the Lorde is not with you. Thirdly, If any man loue me, I and my Father will come to him, &amp;c. which comming &amp; going ſhould ſéeme

to infringe his vbiquitie. But concerning the firſt, we are to know that in theſe or any other places, God is not meant to bee in heauen either circumſcriptiuely as men limitted by place heere and not elſe where for that time, either definitiuely as Angels by proprietie of their ſubſtaunce, but (that we may ſo ſpeak) repletiuely, becauſe with his abſence he repleniſheth and filleth heauen and earth, and all places, as the Prophet ſayth. Againe, becauſe there, as in his throne and place of greateſt dignitie,
                  Iere· 23.24.
                hee ſheweth his power, his wiſdome, his goodneſſe and maieſtie more than in other places of the worlde, and therehence more reuealeth and declareth the ſame than from anie other place. The heauens declare the glorie of God,
               
                  Pſal. 19.2.
                
               and the firmament ſheweth his handie worke.
               
                  Hoſe. 2.24.
                The Lord heareth the heauens, and the heauens the earth, the earth the corne, and the corne the people. From heauen the wrath of GOD is reuealed againſt all vngodlyneſſe.
               
                  Rom. 118.
                From heauen he ſendeth his Angels, from heauen the ſonne of man deſcendeth, from heauen the holy ſpirite commeth, and from heauen ſhal he come to iudge the quick and

the dead.
                  Eſay. 66.1.
                Wherefore in theſe reſpects and a number like, heauen is called his throne, and he is ſayd there to bee more than in all other places, and we when we pray, lifting our eyes &amp; mindes vp to this chiefe throne of his maieſtie when it pleaſeth him to communicate, life, motion, light, and all goodneſſe to his ſeruaunts, ſaie, Our Father which art in heauen.
            
            And remember with your ſelfe that euen in the ſame place where heauen is called his Throne, the earth alſo is called his Footeſtoole, as noting his preſence, notwithſtāding euery where, though his ſeate be prepared in heauen, and what place will you build vnto mee, ſayth the Lord, that is, how may I be apprehēded of anie one place, that am infinite, and fill all places. Nothing therefore this clauſe in our Praier infringeth his vbiquitie. Touching the ſecond thing, that God is ſayd in the Scripture not to bee with ſome men ſometimes, wee muſt vnderſtande it is not meant of his eſſence, as though that were not in ſome places, but of his efficacie and working by his holy ſpirite, and by his ſtrength to ſaue and deliuer ſometimes.

Thus is not the Lorde in the reprobate and wicked. For what is it to be in a place rightly and fully, but as in his own proper place there to rule and raigne, &amp; to exerciſe his power to the good of the place: which the Lord doth not in the wicked. Thus was it tolde the people,
                  Num. 14.
                that God was not with thē, &amp; therfore they ſhould not go vp: namely, not to fight on their parte, not to ſaue them and deliuer them by his power and ſtrength, otherwiſe by his eſſence hee was with them and hee is euerie where. This well conſidered giueth a light to diuerſe places of Scripturs, where it is ſaid, the Lord is neere or far of, telling vs they are meant not of his eſſence, but of his grace, which grace when it is mercifullie offered to men and women by the worde preached vnto them, by bleſſings and comforts beſtowed vpon them able to moue a heart of ſteele to thinke of a gracious God that giueth ſuch giftes,
                  How God is ſayd to be nere or farre of.
                then is the Lorde ſayde to be neere, and when vnkindly (notwithſtanding al his goodneſſe) he hath ben reiected, deſpiſed, and refuſed, and therevppon ceaſeth to offer vs anie more fauour,
                  Eſay. 55.
                but ſhutteth vp his compaſſion towardes

vs, then is he ſayd to be farre of. Thus is it meant in the Prophet,
                  Eſay. 55.
                
               Call vppon him while hee is neere, that is, I haue nowe ſhewed whileſt his arme is ſtretched out to you, and his mercie offered in ſuch ſorte as it is.
                  How God is ſayd to be more in one man or place than in an other.
                This alſo conſidered, teacheth vs how God may bee ſayd to bee more in one man than another, and more in one place than in another, namely, ſtill not in reſpect of eſſence which is equally in all places, and wholy in all places, but in reſpecte of more or leſſe after the gifte of his grace to one perſon than another, or to one place than another. Of which it may bee true that Gregorie ſayd: Deus qui omnia tangit, non aequaliter omnia tangit.
               
                  Tom. 2. In Ezek hom. 8. pag. 130.
                  
                God that toucheth all things, yet toucheth not all things alike. By this may the third thing partly be vnderſtood, to wit, how GOD is ſayde in Scripture to come and goe awaie, and yet no breach made of his vbiquitie,
                  How God is ſayd to goe and come.
                namely, becauſe ſuch ſpeeches are neuer to bee meant of his eſſence, or mutation of place, (for ſo departeth hee from none) but of inward or outward effects of his holie ſpirit, according to which giuen or taken awaie, the Lord is ſaid to come or to go from men

and places, as hee departed from Dauid when hee lefte him iuſtly for his grieuous ſinnes, deſtitute of the peace of his conſcience, of the chéerefulneſſe of his minde, the cleanneſſe of his heart, the quietneſſe of his affections, and other giftes of his holy ſpirite which before Dauid had in great meaſure. Wherevpon he was forced to crie, O Lord create a cleane heart within mee,
               
                  Pſal 51.
                
               and renue a right ſpirit, O Lord giue me the comfort of thy ſpirite againe, &amp; let the bones which thou haſt broken reioyce. On the other ſide hee is ſayde to come, when againe he beginneth to worke by his holy ſpirit, and to ſtirre vp faith, repentance, loue, hatred of ſinne, &amp; ſuch like. Thus meant our Sauiour when he ſayde, I and my Father will come vnto him &amp; dwell with him. And this of inward graces. Outwardly alſo the Lord is ſayde to come, ergo when either by outward croſſes he ſo humbleth vs as though he had forſaken vs, and departed in anger from vs, ſo that we are conſtrained with Dauid to ſay, My God why haſt thou forſaken me,
               
                  Pſal. 22.2.
                or when hee ſo defendeth vs, comforteth vs, and bleſſeth vs, that the world that ſeeth it

is driuen to ſaie and ſee as Saul did of Dauid,
               
                  1. Sam. 18.28·
                that the Lord is with vs. So his abſence is the abſence of his effects in vs, and for vs, and his preſence or comming is the preſence and gift of them either inward or outward. Wherefore to goe no further, I hope it is playne inough now, that though we ſaie our Father is in heauen, yet wee are farre from denying therein or therby his diuine vbiquitie and preſence euerie wher. But euen as the ſoule of man which is wholie in the whole and in euerie parte, yet is ſayde to be in the head or heart more than elſe where, becauſe there more than elſwhere it exerciſeth his power &amp; effects: So God though by eſſence euery where &amp; in all places wholy, yet by action, operation, &amp; communication of grace &amp; gifts not equally in all partes, but in heauen more than in earth, in the godly more than the wicked, and in one of his childrē, more than an other: in the Saincts in heauen, more than in the Saints in earth, and in the humane nature of Chriſte, more than in anie creature eyther in heauen or earth, as in whome the fulneſſe of grace &amp; ſpirite without meaſure was. Howbeit yet in a more

excellent maner God dwelt in Chriſt than by fulneſſe of grace and giftes, or by manifeſtation of his vertue and power, as might be ſhewed if the place required it. But thus much of this matter.
            
               Now if you thinke good, to the petitions themſelues.
               
                  WIth a good will. And herein for more plainnes of ſpéech,
                     Three things conſidered.
                   let vs generally obſerue the diuiſion or number of theſe petitiōs, the order of them, and the matter and meaning of them. Touching the diuiſion of thē I will not curiouſly ſtand vpon it. S. Auſten, and many after him by his example make 7. diuiding the laſt into two: but their reaſons are very inſufficient,
                     Enchiridion. Chap. 116.
                   as may bee ſeene. And Auſten himſelf contrary to him ſelfe confeſſeth that thoſe words But deliuer vs from euill, are an explication of the former, Leade vs not into temptation. And therfore by conſequence vnfitly made a petition of it ſelfe: for in ſo ſhort a ſumme of ſo fewe petitions, one to be confounded

with an other, &amp; to be all one, is not probable. Others make ſixe, and they rather are to be followed.
               For the order of them this is to be obſerued,
                     The petitions concerning Gods glory firſt.
                   that 3. of them reſpecting immediatly and chiefly Gods glorie: other 3. our neceſſities &amp; wants: thoſe that cōcerne the Lord are placed before the other, euen as in the lawe of God thoſe 4. commandements that containe mans dutie to God are ſet before the other 6. that containe his duetie to his neighbour. Which being done of purpoſe in the depth of his vnſearchable wiſedome, that layd this forme downe for vs, Chriſt Ieſus, contayneth in it a leſſon of great regard to a minde poſſeſſed with the feare of God and care of bounden duetie. Namely, that the honor of God ought to be more deere vnto vs than either bodie or goods, or any benefite of ours whatſoeuer in this world, yea which is farre more then the very ſoules within vs, &amp; the ſaluation of them in the world to come. For ſo both the Lord God himſelf, the compoſer of this Prayer, and the giuer of bodie, goods and ſoule and all, teacheth in the ſixt of Mathew. And the power of his holy ſpirite in

the practiſe of his ſeruants confirmeth and ſheweth euidently. For principally and aboue all, ſayth the Lord Ieſus,
                     Math. 6.33.
                   
                  ſeeke the kingdome of God and the righteouſneſſe thereof, and all theſe other things ſhalbe caſt vpon you. Which wordes, if a man would demaunde a reaſon of the order of theſe 3. petitions before the other of our Sauiour, contayned, as you ſee, euen a full aunſwer, to wit, Gods glorie is more chiefe, &amp; therfore ought to be firſt: but theſe 3. petitions immediatly reſpect that,
                     Exod. 32.32.
                   and therfore ought to be firſt. The power then of Gods ſpirite in the practiſe of the godly wee ſee alſo in Moſes the great ſeruant of almightie God, and in Paule his elect veſſell, to beare his name vnto the Gentiles,
                  
                     Rom. 9.3.
                   who both of them in the flaming heate of a burning zeale to the glorie of the name of God wiſhed the ſame, wt the raſing of them ſelues out of the booke of life, &amp; curſe of his wrath to ye wo eternal of their owne ſoules for euer in ye place of perditiō &amp; death,
                     Gods glory more to be cared for, than our owne ſaluation, if they ſhould come in compariſon together.
                   as is laid doune vnto vs. A fruit in thē of a mightie working ſpirit, &amp; cōmended to vs in the world for euer, to tell vs what ought to be.
               See then euen at our beginning, when

we pray like Saincts and ſonnes of God, like duetifull children affected rightly to their father, euen then when we fall before him with harts &amp; mindes, nothing ſo carefull to gaine our owne good, as to winne the glorie and honor of his name, and the content of his holy bleſſed and moſt good will. And therfore looke into our petitions earneſtly how and which way they ſerue to that before we make them, and then begge them ſpecially for that end. And euen then I ſay whē we do féele in the ſecret teſtimony of an inward cōſcience ſuch a flame of loue wrought by a gracious ſpirite beyond power of ſinful nature to our God in vs,
                     Note.
                   as that if any preferment of ours, benefite and good in the courſe of this world ſhoulde be found of vs to fight againſt his glory, by &amp; by we find content, nay not a content only, but euen a reſtles poſting haſt, and burning heat to renounce it, to defie it, and to ſpit at it: yea were it ſuch glory of vs in this world as euer Prince inioyed, and not onely ſo againe, but euen a moſt willing minde together with the want of that worldly glory or good whatſoeuer, to wit alſo as hath beene ſhewed eternall glory, and good in

heauen, ſo that our God and Father might thereby bee honoured. But O where are we? where are we in this affection? Woe to our weakenes, and alas our want. Yet let vs ſee what ſhoulde bee, let vs confeſſe what is not, and God for his Chriſtes ſake graunt vs mercy. Something is ſomething and euer comfortable, nothing is ſinfull and euer damnable. This loue to the Lorde and zeale to his glory, it is his gift and where hee will, hee giueth it. Though we be weake, hee is ſtrong, and there is no fleſh but he can aide it, neither anie heart but he can change it, onely let vs ſee our want, and ſeeke our good, and certainly we ſhal finde ye ſame with him. This world endeth and God knoweth how ſoone,
                     Luke▪
                     
                   and euē this night before the next may my ſoule be taken from me, and then all my care for the cauſes of this world where is it, or whoſe is it? it cannot goe with me, it ſhall not followe after me, but ſtraungers perhappes ſhall enter vpon my labours, and my cares ſhall make them mightie that will ioy in the lacke and loſſe of me. If I haue followed then this and neglected the other, woe is begun and it ſhall neuer end with me. But

if I haue cared but competently for this with the other, and euer in the power of giuen grace more for the other thā for this, be it vnto me an end when it pleaſeth God his mercie ſhall driue my labours to the good of thoſe that I heere loued, and that my loue of him and zeale to his glory ſhall folow me, remayne with me and weare the crowne of Gods mercy for euer more in heauen. Thus is it a bleſſed thing, to loue Gods glory, and to ſeeke his kingdome with conſcience of duetie and feeling of a future ſtate: and it is as curſed a thing, only to ſeeke our ſelues, and care for euer a kingdome in this world if it were we could get it, much leſſe for farre inferior preferments, and ſo whereby with the loue of thē to be deuoured &amp; eaten vp, as that all ſpéech and talke, and thoughts of the other is very odious to vs, and a mockery with vs. You ſee the world, the daies and times, and you knowe my meaning. Remember the place of theſe three petitions before the other, and remember God in Samuel, They that honour me,
                  
                     1. Sam. 2.
                   
                  them wil I honor, and they that deſpiſe me, they ſhalbe deſpiſed: &amp; I end with them. Ieſus Chriſt in the

benefite of his bloud giue vs care and feeling.
               
                  The diuiſion then of them and number, as alſo the order of theſe three before the other, you thus obſerue: now for the matter and meaning of this firſt, if you will, Halowed be thy name.
                  
               
               This ſhall wee then vnderſtande when wee knowe what is compriſed and meant by the two wordes in it, Name and Halowed. And therefore concerning the firſt wee are to bee aduertiſed, that although no one name wherewith the Lorde is called in the Scripture as Iehouah, Eloim, Shaddai or ſuch like, ſhould either in mind bee conceyued and thought, or in voyce with woordes expreſſed and ſpoken without moſt high reuerence as duetie is, yet are none of thoſe names in this place meant, and much leſſe any Iudaicall or Popiſh ſuperſtition in any of them confirmed. The Iewes for their Iehouah, this is no warraunt. But the name of GOD ſignifieth here that maieſtie of GOD, power and infinite vertue that ſhyneth, ſheweth it ſelfe in euery thing ſo wonderfully. Euen as it is vſually taken

in the Scriptures, and for the moſt parte ſignifieth. In the Prophet, when he ſaith: From the riſing of the Sunne vnto the going downe of the ſame,
                  
                     Malach. 1.11.
                   
                  my name is great amongſt the Gentiles, and in euerie place incenſe ſhall bee offered vnto my name, and a pure offering: for my name is great among the Heathen, ſaith the Lord of hoſts.
                  
                     Ihon. 12.28. Math. 28.
                   And, Father glorifie thy name. And, Baptize in the name of the Father, the ſonne, and the holie Ghoſt. Whereas, I ſaie, the worde ſignifieth not any letters or ſillables in this tongue or that, but that power and vertue of God that ſhineth in all things. So againe in the name of Chriſte the Apoſtles caſt forth diuells,
                     Mar. 16.17.
                   that is, in the power and ſtrength and vertue of Chriſt: for ſo Saint Peter expoundeth in the Actes,
                     Act. 3.12. &amp;. 16.
                   when he ſayth, it was not theyr power and godlyneſſe that had made the man go, but it was the name of that holy one and iuſt, whom they had betraied, that is, his power and godlyneſſe, his ſtrength and vertue, not theirs.
                     Philip. 2.10.
                   So, at the name of Ieſus ſhall euery knee bowe, that is, not when the word is pronounced wee ſhall make a curteſie,

but we ſhall all and euery creature bée ſubiect to his power,
                     verſ. 11.
                   authoritie and dominion: for by name there of Ieſus is meant Dominatio &amp; potestas, dominion and power: &amp;, genuflectionis vocabulo exprimitur ſubiectio, by bowing there is expreſſed and meant ſubiection to that dominion and power. But perhaps with more plainnes it may be noted, that the name of God heere reſpecteth three things chiefly, to wit.
               
                  Himſelfe,
                  His workes.
                  His word.
               
               If we conſider the Lord himſelfe,
                     The name of God what it is.
                   then we ſee in him euer maieſtie and holyneſſe. And this is his name. If we conſider his workes, we ſee iuſtice, mercie, and power in them. And this is his name. And if wee conſider his word, there is euer truth, wiſdome, and goodneſſe in it, and this alſo his name. So that we may conclude this place euen as he that ſayd it, Nomen Dei dicitur omne id quod de illo praedicatur. By the name of God is here meant whatſoeuer it is that truely of him may bee affirmed, as that he is good, iuſt, gracious, &amp;c. And this ſhall haue warrant euident and plaine

euen from the Lord himſelfe in that manifeſtation of himſelfe to his ſeruant Moſes,
                  
                     Exod. 33.
                   were he ſayth he will make all his good go before him,
                     19·
                   and proclayme the name of the Lord before him, and doing ſo in deede, his name is neyther this word nor that as, Iehouah, Tetragrammaton, or ſuch like, either in Hebrew or Greeke, this tongue or that,
                     Exod. 34.5. &amp;c.
                   but it is this: The Lord, the Lorde ſtrong, mercifull, and gracious, ſlowe to anger, and abundant in goodneſſe and truth, reſeruing mercie for thouſandes, forgiuing iniquitie, tranſgreſſion and ſinne, and not making the wicked innocent, viſiting the iniquity of the Fathers vppon the children vnto the third and fourth generation. See then the greate and glorious name of GOD what it is.
               
                  
                     Of the greeke article Danaeus pag. 108.
                  
                  And what is meant I pray you, by Hallowing of that name?
               
               To hallow or to ſanctifie ſignifieth two  things. Either to make holy that which before was not ſo, but polluted &amp; vncleane. In which ſorte our Sauiour Chriſt dooth hallowe and ſanctifie vs, making vs of the ſinful ſonnes of Adam, the righteous ſons

of God in himſelfe. Either elſe that which of it ſelfe and in it ſelfe is alreadie holie, ſo to repute and take ſo, with all reuerence to acknowledge and confeſſe, and ſo euer to vſe and to ſpeake of. In which ſenſe again, wiſedome that of her ſelfe is moſt iuſt, is ſayd to be iuſtified of her children, that is to be ſo eſteemed, iudged, and taken. And in the third of Iohn,
                  
                     Ihon. 3.33.
                   
                  He that hath receiued his teſtimonie (ſaith he) hath ſealed that God is true. That is, nothing but this, doth cauſe and bring to paſſe, that God as he is in himſelf in déede true &amp; truth it ſelf, ſo hee is acknowledged of others to bee. Now in his latter ſignification is it taken heere. And therfore thus expounded by the learned Sanctificari hîc eſt reuelari, obſeruari, glorificari, honorari, verè agnoſci. To bée hallowed here, is to be reuealed, obſerued, glorified, honoured, and truely acknowledged. And againe,
                     What halowing the name of God is.
                   
                  Sanctificari Dei nomen dicitur, cum ſacrum, venerabile, purum, auguſtum eſſe a nobis agnoſcitur, et praedicatur, et nullo modo contemptim, aut irreuerenter, cogitetur aut ſumatur. The name of God is ſaid to be hallowed, when it is confeſſed &amp; publiſhed as holy, reuerend, pure,

and high, and ſuch as by no meanes is eyther thought of, or taken of vs contemptibly or vnreuerently. So that in plaine ſpeech this petition is thus much: O Lord let that maieſtie and holineſſe that is in thy ſelfe, that iuſtice, mercie, and power, which thou ſheweſt in thy works, and that truth, wiſedome, and goodneſſe which is in thy word, with all thy vertue generally whatſoeuer comprehended in thy nature, and fit for the knowledge and vſe of man bee more and more dayly knowen of man, and receiued amōg vs with that dread &amp; honor, and reuerence that is fitte for ſuch a name, both in word and worke, thought &amp; deede, and euery way.
               
                  A notable requeſt ſure, and well beſeeming the ſonnes of God, deſirous of their Fathers glorie. But thus me think you doe not reſtraine it only to man: ſo that in man only this glory of his name is to appeare.
               
               No in deede, neither ought I. But know it as a fault in Tertullian and Cyprian ſo to doe. For ſo large is the reach of this petition, as that it toucheth not onelie men godly and vngodly, reprobate or elect,

but euen all things in this world whatſoeuer, than to be ordayned of the Lorde. For in the verie leaſt thing appeareth ſome maieſtie, power, eternitie, and vertue of him, which in this petition wee deſire as well may appeare and bee ſeene and celebrated to the praiſe of him, as thoſe greater matters that are in man. And therefore cryeth the Prophet of God in his Pſalme, to all creatures to praiſe the Lord:
                     Pſal. 148.
                   Sunne and Moone, and ſtarres, and light, heauen and earth, dragons, deeps, fire and water, haile and ſnowe, winde and vapours, ſtormes and tempeſts, mountaines and hils, trees, beaſts, cattell, wormes, and all feathered foules, and in concluſion, euery thing to exalt, hallowe, and ſanctifie the name of the Lord. For his name onely is excellent &amp; his praiſe aboue heauen and earth.
                  
                     verſ. 12.
                   And to the ſame end is the 104. Pſalme, a verie notable ſong of Dauid alſo,
                     Pſal. 104. Rom. 1.20.
                   teaching vs plainly, that in all the workes of the Lord there is a portion of this his name, that is, of his maieſtie, power, wiſedome and goodneſſe, which in this petition and by theſe wordes we ought to begge of him, which may appeare, be ſeene, noted, marked, and

obſerued, &amp; celebrated in this world, to his glorie more and more. So that you ſee prayer dooth not meane onely man, but all things, in that order that I haue declared. Euery thing as it is better and better knowen contayning matter and argument of Gods praiſe, either in reſpect of workmanſhip, vſe, nature, all, or ſome.
               
                  Yet it reſpecteth man chieflie, as the worke of God, wherein he hath ſhewed himſelfe moſt, and layed downe largeſt arguments to the glorie of his name.
               
               It doth ſo, and therefore ſo let vs think of it. And firſt ſee howe it beggeth for vs knowledge and vnderſtanding ſtill more and more of his name and nature, becauſe knowledge goeth before obedience. Which requeſt of knowledge carieth with it an induſtrie and endeuour in vs in all diligence, euer to obſerue the Lord in his workes, to marke the power, the wiſedome, the goodneſſe of him in creating them, and in giuing ſuch nature, vſe, and operation to them, in diſpoſing them in ſuch an order, in continuing them in ſuch a courſe, and ſo foorth, and condemneth the too too common and damnable dulneſſe of the world in ſo continuall

vſe and ſo little a regarde of theſe things, being the maine cauſe of grieuous vnthankfulneſſe, and not ſanctifying of the name of God in vs.
               Secondly, we begge in it, as one ſaith, Non modò vt nomen Dei in intellectu pe
                        •
                      fidem et noticiam Dei, verumetiam ore, corpore, vita
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      tota ſanctificetur et glorificetur. Not onely that the name of GOD in our vnderſtanding by faith and knowledge of GOD, but alſo in mouth, bodie, and our whole life may bee ſanctified and glorified. Of which hallowing of the name of God ſpeaketh the Lord himſelfe by his Prophet ſaying:
                     Ezek. 36.23.
                   
                  I will ſanctifie my greate name which was polluted among the Heathen, &amp;c. How will he do it, or what is this ſanctification? Marke how it followeth,
                     verſ. 25.
                   
                  I will powre cleane water vpon you, and you ſhall bee cleane: yea,
                  
                     26.
                   
                  from all your filthineſſe, and from all your Idols will I cleanſe you. A new heart alſo will I giue you, and a newe ſpirit will I put within you, and I will take away the ſtonie hart out of your body, &amp; giue you an hart of fleſh. And I wil put my ſpirit within you, &amp; cauſe you to walke in my ſtatutes,
                  
                     27
                   
                  &amp;



you ſhall keepe my iudgements, and do them. So that then is the greate name of the Lord ſanctified you ſee and hallowed, when we doe not onely knowe, but doe the things that redound vnto his praiſe. For then they that ſee our good workes are thereby cauſed to glorifie God in the daie of the viſitation.
                     1. Peter. 2.12. Math. 5.16.
                   And euen contrariwiſe agayne if we do not, we pollute the name of the Lorde in cauſing it to ſounde euill amongſt the wicked, and the ſinne is grieuous. Of which complayneth the Lord by his Prophet Eſaie,
                  
                     Eſay. 52.
                   when he ſaith, his name all the daie continuallie is blaſphemed:
                     5.
                   and by his Apoſtle to ye Romanes,
                     Rom. 2.24. 1. Timoth.
                   &amp; in diuers other places. And the ſame Apoſtle charging ſeruaunts that are vnder the yoake to account their maiſters worthy of all honor,
                     6.1.
                   maketh this the reaſon why, Leaſt the name of God and his doctrine bee euill ſpoken of.
                  
                     Thirdly what we praye againſt in this petition.
                   And therefore thirdly, as wee ſeeke the one, ſo wee deſire to bee able to ſhun the other in this petition, beſeeching him in the ſenſe of theſe wordes, that all thoſe things may be remoued,
                     Pſal. 104.
                   ouerturned, and taken awaie,
                     35.
                   which prophane, blemiſh, or blot that glorie of his, either in himſelfe,

or in his workes, or in his worde and doctrine. Such as are theſe damnable Atheiſts of theſe latter dayes,
                     Atheiſts.
                   which with theyr ieaſts, ſcoffes, and mockes deriding all goodneſſe, do not onely diſcouer the name of God, but to their euerlaſting woe in the flames of the burning bottomeleſſe pit, affirming it flatlie in their hearts, that there is no God at all. Such are they that with their cenſures will correcte the workes of God, and ſpeake euill of them,
                     Libertines.
                   complayne of his prouidence, &amp; murmure at his iudgmentes, carpe and cauill at his worde, allure vnto looſeneſſe, and dayly worke diſdaine of commaunded obedience, which al, if they be not reformed, are prayed agaynſt throughout the world by all the children of God dayly in this petition, to the vnſpeakable terrour of them, if they had grace to thinke of it. For how certayne is that vengeaunce which hee that ſendeth it,
                     Marke it and thinke of it.
                   biddeth aſke: and how dreadfull muſt it needes be, and euen importable when it commeth, which is ſo often, ſo earneſtlie, and by ſuch a number as the whole Church of God on earth is, in ſo many places aſked, begged, and cried for? O woe not once thought

vpon, and yet to be trembled at, ſhall it not be remembred in deede? Shall theſe painted dayes ſo poyſon vs quite with the loue of this world, and the fading follyes of a moſt vncertayne eſtate, that all grace and goodneſſe ſhall be contemned of vs. And whereas the Prophet of God ſayde,
                     Pſal. 
                           •

                  One daie in the courtes of the Lordes houſe is better than a thouſand. Wee ſaie the contrarie, that but one houre there is too much, though it be but once a weeke, nay once in many weekes, and one daie in the courſe of this worlde, to the which yet the Apoſtle ſayth,
                     Rom. 12.
                   
                  Faſhion not your ſelues, is better and ſweeter, and more beſeeming a man, eſpeciallie a greate man, than a thouſand in the other: Is it likely that euer we wil wiſh our ſelues with that Prophet,
                     Pſal 84. verſ. 11.
                   rather doore kéepers in this houſe of GOD, than to dwel in great renowm in the tents of the vngodlie; when wee either loure or laugh to be tolde, we ſhould come in? Can it be hoped, that eyther now we doe thinke (God often puniſhing ſuch great contempt with laſting blindnes) that they are bleſſed that dwell in the houſe of the Lord, beeing euer praiſing of God, yea, that the verie

Swallowes and Sparows that are there, are as it were happie and bleſſed? O it is to be feared no. And therefore not Dauids prayer, not Dauids ſpirite, neither conſequently that election to life whereof that ſpirit is a certaine pledge. Which is terririble inough, if God were in vs.
                     That the names of all fayned gods being vtterly abolyſhed the onely diuine name and maieſtie of God the heauenly father be had in honor and called vpon with pure mindes by men of all ages, countries and parts of the world.
                   Thinke of it, and thinke of this agayne with it, that al the Church of God through the worlde, as I haue ſayd, praie againſt vs when wee are thus irreligious and prophane, ſaying, Halowed be thy name, that is, O Lord confound with ſpeedie curſe of death and woe eternal, all thoſe that not liuing in the laws of thy will, cauſe thy name to heare euil, and to be blaſphemed in this world. Let them periſh O Lord, let them periſh in the luſts of their own hearts, and giue thy name his glorie. Which if hell haue not alreadie taken poſſeſſion of vs, will pearce vs, and make vs think of reformatiō of our ſelues: the Lord in mercy grant it.
               
                  Amen. Amen. And if it do not,

                  tyme paſſeth and tyme commeth, the which two times ſhal differ, as mercy &amp; iudgement differ, fauour and fury, loue and loathing. And the worde of the Lorde

ſhall not deceiue vs,
                  
                     Rom. 12.
                   
                  ſaying vengeaunce is myne, and J wil repay, but how ſoone that knowe not we.

                  But well we knowe, the Lord is not ſlacke concerning his promiſe as ſome men count ſlackenes, but he is patient toward vs, and would haue all men come to repentance, and one day is with the Lord as a thouſand yeeres, and a thouſand yeres as one day, and this day will come.

                  But now I pray you let me moue a doubt or two vnto you. And firſt why the Church of God ſhould pray that the Lords name may bee halowed which is already, euer was, and ſhalbe moſt holy, pure and glorious?
               
               Becauſe we do not pray it, in reſpect of him, but of our ſelues and others, ſuch as we are: for the Lord in deed is holy, neither can any thing be added to that holines or glory of him to make it more, but wee doe not know it, ſo much as we ſhould do, neither ſpeak of it, and imitate it as we ought: and therfore we pray that as he is in déede, ſo more and more it may appeare and ſhine out to the world, all lettes and hinderances being taken away, that his due prayſe may bee giuen vnto him of vs, that is, wee pray

not in this petition,
                     He ſanctifieth vs by making vs holy, we him by confeſſing him holy, &amp;c.
                   that any holynes may bee added to his name, that already it hath not, but that as it is in it ſelfe in deede and euer, ſo we may haue grace to ſee and confeſſe, and more and more dayly may be reueiled, and manifeſted to this worlde. For the Lord is ſayde to ſanctifie vs, either inwardly or outwardly. Inwardly by his ſpirit, outwardly by his word, and this againe either by ſeperating vs from our ſinnes, quickning vs by his holy Spirit, or continuance of them both.
               
                  An other doubt is,
                  
                     Apoc. 22.11.
                   
                  why it ſhoulde be ſayd in that place. And he that is vniuſt, let him be vniuſt ſtill: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy ſtill. Seeing here we are taught to pray, and all men, that our liues may be holy and pure euer, to the end his glorious name may haue prayſe thereby.
               
               That place you meane is not ſo ſpoken,
                     Permiſſiue.
                   as that wee ſhoulde continue and delight in filthynes or vnrighteouſneſſe. But it is a declaration of the courſe that the wicked will take, and withall a ſecret confirmation of the godly, notwithſtanding the ſame. As if he ſhoulde haue ſayd, be not you troubled

or hindred in your moſt godly courſe of obedience to me, either by the continuance and euer increaſing of the wicked in their wickednes, or by my toleraunce and long forbearing to ſmite them. But folowe you me and my commandements, ſtagger not, looke not backe, giue not ouer and as for the wicked, he that is vniuſt, let him be vniuſt ſtill, and he that is filthy, let him be filthy ſtill: their puniſhment they ſhall bee ſure of in their time: and for you, goe ye on without ſtop: let them bee as they are to their woe.
               
                  The prayer.
                  
                     O Mightie GOD, looke vppon vs woormes and wretches, here at thy feete lying and begging mercy. Let vs obtaine of thy fatherly goodnes, what thou haſt ſo louingly taught vs to aſke: that thy name may bee halowed. Let our eyes and the eyes of all men lightned by thy grace, behold that maieſtie and holynes that is in thy ſelfe more and more, that Iuſtice, mercy and power, which thou ſheweſt in thy works

and that truth, wiſedome, and goodnes which is in thy worde, more and more, with all thy vertues generally whatſoeuer comprehended in thy nature and fit for the knowledge and vſe of man, let them be more and more dayly knowne vnto vs. And when in mercy thou haſt beſtowed as it may ſeeme good to thine owne wiſedome, this knowledge vpon vs. O heauenly father let it not be in vs a bare knowledge, but ioyne to our knowledge that dread and honour, that regard and reuerence in our obedience that is fit for ſuch a name, both in word and worke, thought and deede, and euery way. Make vs O Lorde euer more and more to auoyde and ſhunne what polluteth thy name, &amp; cauſeth thy truth to heare euill of the wicked. Remoue and ouerturne alſo good Lorde all thoſe thinges in thy good tyme, which prophane, blemiſh, and blot this glory of thine ſhining either in thy ſelfe, in thy word, or in thy works. Such as are theſe irreligious Atheiſts of our ſinfull dayes, which with their mockes, and ſcoffes, tants, and ieſts, deride all goodnes, outface

all conſcience and care to pleaſe thee, and dayly woorke diſdayne where they may haue hearing of obedience to thy bleſſed will. O thou mightie God, remoue their ſeats out of kingdomes &amp; countryes. Out of Cities and townes, and out of priuate houſes and families. Awake Lorde in thy power, and thinke of thy holy name, let not theſe inchaunters and charmers preuaile againſt thee, and glorye that they haue baniſhed out of ſo many places the feare of thy name. They are vnholy and they woulde haue all ſuch, they are vncleane and they infect where they come, they are grieuous rockes of no ſmall offence, and good Lorde remoue them from thy choſen. Leſſen alſo for thy holy name ſake the cōplayners of thy prouidence, the murmurers at thy iudgements, carpers and cauillers at thy word, allurers to looſenes of life, and behauiour, and al that polluting thy holy name, yet hate to be reformed. Finally deere father, let not the ſhames of vngodlines dayly before our faces cary vs away. Neither theſe deepe waterfloods drowne our ſoules,

the lewde and looſe examples wee beholde with griefe, let them neuer preuayle againſt vs to peruert vs, but if thy iuſt wrath haue ſealed their confuſion they being vniuſt, let thē bee vniuſt ſtill, they being filthy, let them be filthy ſtill to their owne wo, not to our ſtoppe or hinderance to do our dueties, in ſeeking to knowe thy glorious name more and more, and to ſanctifie and hallow it according to that true knowledge more and more. And deereſt God begin not only obedience in vs, but confirme thy fauour to vs euermore: ſtrengthen and eſtabliſh vs in all goodnes: make ſtrong our inward man againſt all aſſaults and theſe ſeely ſoules pend vp in ſinfull priſon during life, by welcome change receyue when tyme ſhall bee with thee to liue, till thy day of doome, and then receyuing their mates againe, but immortal and incorruptible, with them to liue conioyned againe for euermore in ioye and comfort. But not this for our ſakes O mightie Lorde, but for Ieſus Chriſt our onely life and Sauiour. Amen.
               
            
            
               
               
                  The ſecond Petition. Thy kingdome come.
               
                  HAuing beſought the Lord in the former petition,
                     The order.
                   that his name might be hallowed, that is, as then was ſayde, that that maieſtie and holineſſe which is in himſelfe, that iuſtice, mercie, and power which hee ſheweth in his workes, and that truth, wiſdome, and goodneſſe which is in his worde, with all other vertues generallie whatſoeuer comprehended in his nature, and fit for the knowledge and vſe of man, might be more and more dayly knowen of men, and receiue amongſt vs that dreade, honour, and reuerence that is fit for ſuch a name both in word and worke, thought and deede, and euerie waie: it fitly followeth in the ſecond place, to beſeech the ſame Lorde to graunt waie and meanes, whereby that ſame ſhall be effected and brought to paſſe, namelie, that his kingdome may come. For if the Lord rule and raigne in vs and ouer vs, it ſhal be ſo. And if he do not, it ſhal not be ſo.

No, we ſhal be ſo far from ſanctifying his name, that for wāt of his kingdome in vs, Satan ſhall erect his kingdome in vs, the effects wherof ſhall be great and grieuous pollutions of his name. Wherfore the order is moſt conuenient and good.
               The wordes of the petition are few and eaſily vnderſtoode, if we marke them. For the kingdome of GOD is the ruling and raigning of GOD in the heartes of men, and the comming of this kingdome, is the beginning, increaſing, and continuing of it in vs. So thy kingdome come, is in effect thus much, as if we ſhould ſaie: O Lorde, erect and begin, O Lord increaſe and propagate, O Lord eſtabliſh and euer continue in our hearts thy rule and gouernment, to the death of ſinne and life of righteouſnes, the true effects of thy ruling euer. Which yet is not ſo plaine as it will be, when wee haue conſidered of the ſeuerall members implied in theſe wordes. For we muſt vnderſtand, that when we are taught to praie for this kingdome of God, all the meanes whereby it is effected in vs, are included to be prayed for, as alſo all ſtops and lets, enimies, &amp; hinderaunces whatſoeuer withſtanding

this kingdome, prayed agaynſt, that they may bee remooued and taken awaie.
                     
                        
                           Regnum Potentiae.
                        
                        
                           Regnum Gratiae.
                        
                        
                           Regnum Gloriae.
                        
                     
                   To bee then as plaine as I can, the kingdome of God is ſayde to bee of three ſortes, to witte, of power, of grace, and of glorie. The kingdome of power is that ſoueraigntie which the Lord hath ouer al the things in this worlde, directing, guiding, ruling, and diſpoſing of euery one of them as his good pleaſure is, and cauſing all the creatures in the worlde, yea, all the worldes, workes, and thoughts of men, to ſerue to his glorie, wiſedome and will, whatſoeuer is intended by man, or anie meanes to the contrarie, which the Heathens haue called deſtiny, or ineuitable neceſſity. This kingdome is not here meant, when wee praie,
                     Fatum.
                   
                  Thy kingdome come. For the Lord neuer hath, neyther euer will looſe this kingdome, yt is, as I ſay, this authoritie, and power ouer al things, to make them ſerue to his pleaſure, and to bring to paſſe what he wil haue, whereby we ſhould neede to praie for it, that it may come. Of this kingdome may it bee ſayd,
                     Pſal. 135.6.
                   that is in the Pſalme: Whatſoeuer pleaſed the Lord, that did he, in heauen &amp; in earth, in the ſea, and in all deapths. For it ſubiecteth,

as you ſee, to the Lord, al theſe, &amp; al their works whatſoeuer. And then what is exempted out of this kingdom of power, if heauen, earth, ſea and deeps be ruled by it? Yet ſtayeth not the Prophet ſo, but proueth by examples what hee hath ſayd, and affirmeth it of ye Lorde, that he bringeth vp the Clowdes from the endes of the earth, and maketh the Lightning with the raine: that he draweth foorth the windes out of his treaſures: that he ſmiteth the firſt borne of Egipt both of man and beaſt: that it is he that ſendeth tokens and wonders, &amp;c. Of this Kingdome may it bee meant that is ſayd by the Apoſtle: for of him,
                  
                     Rom. 11.36.
                   
                  and for him, and through him are all things: with a number ſuch like places ſpeaking of the prouidence of God.
                     Epheſ. 11.
                   And to this kingdome of God it may bee applyed that the wiſeman ſayth: Non eſt conſilium, non eſt prudentia, non eſt fortitudo aduerſus Dominum. There is no councell, there is no wiſdome, there is no ſtrength againſt ye Lord. For he hath ruled euer, hee doth rule, and will rule for euer al things, let al the world conſpire againſt it what they can. Againe, the Lord worketh al things after the counſell

of his owne will: He giueth raine vppon the earth,
                  
                     Iob. 5.10.
                   
                  and powreth water vpon the ſtreates: he ſetteth vp on high them that be lowe, that the ſorowfull may be exalted to ſaluation: hee ſcattereth the deuiſes of the craftie, ſo that their hāds cannot accompliſh that which they doe enterpriſe: He taketh the wiſe in their craftineſſe,
                  
                     Iob· 9.5.
                   
                  and the counſell of the wicked is made fooliſh. He remoueth the mountaines and they feele not when he ouerthroweth them in his wrath. He remoueth the earth out of her place, that the pillers thereof doe ſhake. He commaundeth the Sunne, and it riſeth not, he cloſeth vp the Starres as vnder a ſignet. He himſelf alone ſpreadeth out the heauens, and walketh vpon the height of the ſea.
                  
                     verſ. 2.
                   All theſe are ſayd of this kingdome. Reade Syrach the 17. to the 20. verſe, and ſee what a kingdome of power acknowledged ouer al the beaſtes &amp; foules, men and matters whatſoeuer. Notable is the 4. of Exodus. verſ. 11.
                  
                     Exod. 4.11.
                   For thoſe ſéeme caſuall in the mothers bellie, whereof they muſt needes be vnderſtood, man being not created ſo at the firſt. The kingdome of

grace ſhall much better bee vnderſtoode, if we conſider how we were created, how by ſinne corrupted, and how now in mercie daylie by grace renewed. The creation of man you know is layd downe to haue bene according to the Image and likeneſſe of God himſelfe. For God created man (ſaith the booke of wiſedome without corruption at the firſt,
                     Creation.
                   and made him after the Image of his owne likenes. And he clothed them with ſtrength, ſayth Sirach, as they haue neede,
                     Syrac. 17.3.
                   and made them according to his Image. Which Image of God maketh not, GOD like vnto men with legges, armes, hands, a gray head, and ſo forth, as not onely other heretikes but euen our holy papiſts haue imagined, and by ſo paynting him in their Churches &amp; windowes, made ye ignorant beléeue it: but it maketh man like vnto God, in holynes, righteouſnes, wiſedome and ſo forth. For ſo expoūdeth the Apoſtle, theſe words to the Epheſians, and there might all Papiſtes haue ſeene it, if they would. Putte on the new man, ſayeth he,
                     Epheſ. 4.
                   
                  which after God (that is after the Image of God) is created vnto righteouſnes and true holynes, meaning by theſe two

words all perfection, as wiſedome, will to doe good, truth, innocency, loue of God, power, and ſuch like. See what the Image of God is. Now then being thus created and made, who ruled in man, or what kingdome,
                     Corruption.
                   was he ſubiect vnto? The Lord you ſee ruled in him, and to his Kingdome was he ſubiect. But alas the time, this happie eſtate was quickly loſt. The Serpent deceiued the woman, the woman the man: Sinne entred, GOD was offended: and a fearefull change from al weale to wo, in a little time, and brought to paſſe. So that now looke on man agayne and his copie is changed. Satan ruleth, ſinne is entred, death foloweth,
                     Rom. 5.12.
                   and this bleſſed Kingdome of God in man and ouer man is loſt, gone, and deſtroyed. Yea to ſpeake playner, and not ſo generally, familiaritie with GOD is turned into a fearefull flying off from God, for they hide themſelues from the preſence of the Lorde among the trees of the garden.
                     Gen. 38. verſ. 7.
                   Wiſedome is turned into folly, and they thinke with a fewe Figge leaues to couer their ſhame. Yea ſuch is our wiſedome now, as Rom. 8.7. Truth is turned into lyes, and they deale not

plainly with the Lord. The ſerpent deceiued me, the woman deceiued mee:
                  
                     verſ. 12.
                   and there is not plainly, wee haue ſinned, O Lord forgiue vs. Now is it ſayd of man,
                     verſ. 13▪
                     
                   that all the imaginatiōs of the thoughts of his hart is onely euill continually,
                     Gen. 6.5.
                   that we are all become as an vncleane thing,
                     Eſay. 64.
                   and that all our righteouſneſſe is as filthie cloutes, that wee all doe fade like a leafe, and our iniquities like a winde doe take vs away.
                     Rom. 7.14.
                   Now is it ſayd of vs that wee are carnall, ſolde vnder ſinne,
                     19.
                   that we doe not the good which wee would,
                     21.
                   but the euill which wee would not, that doe wee: that when we would doe good we are thus yoked, that euill is preſent with vs:
                     23.
                   that there is an other lawe in our members rebelling againſt the lawe of our minde, and leading vs captiue vnto the lawe of ſinne which is in our members. That the naturall man perceiueth not the things of the Spirite,
                     1. Cor. 2.
                   for they are fooliſhneſſe vnto him, neither can he knowe them. Now is it ſayd of vs,
                     Epheſ. 2.
                   that by nature we are the childrē of wrath, dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes, walking in them according to the courſe of this world, and after the Prince that ruleth in the ayre,

euen the Spirite that worketh in vs the children of diſobedience. Now is it ſayd of man that was ſo excellent,
                     Pſal. 57.
                   
                  Verely euery man liuing is altogether vanitie. Now cryeth the Prophet of men, that his ſoule is amongſt Lyons, that their teeth are ſpeares,
                     Pſal. 14.
                   and arrowes, and their tongue a ſharpe ſword. That they are corrupt and become abhominable, that there is none that doth good, no not one. And where ruleth all this euill that wee haue thus purchaſed to our woe?
                     What is corrupted in vs by our fall.
                   O further griefe! our bodies, our ſoules, our mindes, our willes, our harts our hands, our feete, and our whole man is corrupted, ſinne hath entered ouer all, and by ſinne Satan as Lord and King ruleth ouer all, till this other kingdome come that here wee pray for. For, eratis tenebrae, ſayth the Apoſtle, Ye were darkneſſe,
                  
                     Epheſ. 5.
                   
                  but now are ye light in the Lord. And more plainly before, hauing their vnderſtāding darkned, &amp; being ſtrāgers frō the life of God through that ignorāce that is in them,
                  
                     Gen. 6.
                   &amp;c. Therefore you ſee the minde corrupted. Of the hart and will it was ſayd before that the imaginations of the thoughts thereof are

onely euill continually. And out of the hart (now ſayth our Sauiour) proceede euill thoughts, murders, adulteries,
                  
                     Math. 15.16.
                   
                  fornications, theftes, falſe witneſſe, ſclaunders, and this is ſtuffe that defileth the man. With a thouſand places moe crying out of the waywardneſſe of mans hart and will, the crookedneſſe, ſtifneſſe and ſtubbornneſſe of it againſt the Lord &amp; all good.
                     Rom. 7.18. Rom. 3.13. &amp;c.
                   Of the whole man, ſayth the Apoſtle, Noui quod in me, hoc eſt in carne mea, non eſt bonum: I know that in me, that is, in my fleſh there is no good.
                   Our mouth, our feete, our throte, our eyes, and all are charged with their faultes in the worde of the Lord. That free will that was in man to doe good, it is gone ſayth Sainct Auſten, and, homo malè vtens libero arbitrio, &amp; ſe perdidit &amp; arbitrium. Man abuſing his free will, loſt both himſelfe and it. And now is it true that wee are not able to thinke a good thought as of our ſelues, but both to will and to performe is of the Lord. Now is it true that our Sauiour ſayd, ſine me nihil potestis facere: without me you can doe nothing. Non dixit ſine me difficulter aliquid potestis, aut ſine me non poteſtis aliquid

magni facere, ſed nihil potestis, &amp;c. He did not ſay (ſayth S. Auſten) without me you can hardly doe any thing, or you can not doe any great matter, but ſimply and flatly you can doe nothing. Meaning in ſpirituall matters: for herein, quid habes, quod non accepisti? what haſt thou that thou haſt not receiued?

                   whatſoeuer it be if it be good. And to goe no further in this ſorte, now muſt man and woman, bee they neuer ſo righteous, crie out vppon their vnrighteouſneſſe, and hide their faces from the iudgement of the Lord, if he ſhould out of the comfort prouided for them, ſeeke to iudge them. Dauid the deere one of the Lord and a man according to his owne hart, yet muſt confeſſe of himſelfe with woe.

without end, now are few &amp; full of wo: for life we haue got death: for pleaſure payne: for good euill: for heauen hell: &amp; for endleſſe ioye eternall woe. O dreadfull fall. Thus created then innocent, God ruled: but thus fallen from that innocencie, Satan ruleth: and wee are, as hath bene ſayd, by nature the children of wrath, walking after the Prince that ruleth in the ayre, that is the Deuill. But the Lord is gracious and his mercy indureth for euer:
                     Regeneration.
                   there remaineth therefore hope by a reſtitution or regeneration, which the Scripture teacheth vs thus much of: namely,
               That whereas Satan abuſeth that corrupt nature of ours through the great power which hee hath ouer vs for our ſinnes, and driueth vs from the worde and all religion, into all blindneſſe, ignorance, and errors; thruſteth vs into diuers miſeries and calamities, &amp; in the end into eternal death, there being where he ruleth, no true loue of God or any grace but ſinning, without ſting, touch, or feeling: the Lorde our God in a contrary courſe of loue, where it pleaſeth him, beginneth with that corruption of nature, wherby Satan before was ſtrong,

and taketh it away by litle and litle, begetting vs anew to a better life, and reſtoring that Image of his in vs againe, whereunto we were firſt created, and which ſo fearfully we were fallen from. Our minde hee illuminateth with ſome heauenly light whereby it beginneth to know aright God, &amp; grace, our will receiueth a new ſtrength to imbrace the worde, to reſt in it,
                     Rom. 6.13.
                   and to incline it ſelfe to the teſtimonies of the Lord. Our heart is purged and loueth the Lorde, and all the members of the body, before the weapons of vnrighteouſneſſe vnto ſinne becomme by meaſure, the weapons of righteouſneſſe vnto God. So ſinne dyeth, grace liueth, and wee loue him, feare him, truſt in him pray to him often, and in all our wants, with ſuch like. This is nowe the kingdome of grace, &amp; this is that wee pray for here immediatly. The kingdom of glory is that happy and eternall eſtate which followeth in heauen after this life,
                     The Kingdom of glorie.
                   which we alſo pray for here, but mediatly as wee ſay, that is, when the kingdome of grace in this world is ended.
               Thus much being ſayd then for plainenes of theſe three kingdomes, the kingdom

of power, of grace, and of glory, as alſo of which of them the petition is meant. So now what we pray in plaine words: namely thus much, O Lord ſubdue vnto thy maieſtie all power of Satan in vs by any meanes: ſubdue our ſinfull fleſh and all the wicked luſts therof, to the inlarging of thy kingdome here vpon earth,
                     The ſenſe of the petition brefely.
                   and grant that all the powers of body and ſoule may be inabled by thy holy Spirite to worke acceptably in thy ſight, that thou mayeſt dwell in vs, and wee in thee for euer, and all thyne &amp; our enemies vtterly troden downe, thou mayſt gloriouſly reigne and triumph ouer all, and wee by Chriſt may finally as thy children and heires be made partakers of thy euerlaſting kingdome.
               Now is not this brought to paſſe but by meanes, and therefore as we pray for the thing that the Lord would graunt it, ſo pray we alſo incluſiuely for the meanes that in mercy they may bee giuen to the effecting of it. The meanes are theſe: firſt the word, euen this heauenly and bleſſed woorde of God, ſo finally accompted of in the worlde, and not onely ſo, but euen hated, deſpiſed, and reiected of numbers. For ſo ſayth the

Apoſtle, it is the power of God vnto ſaluation, to euery one that beleeueth, to the Iew firſt, &amp; alſo to the Grecian:
                  
                     Rom. 1.16.
                   that is, it is the mightie inſtrument of GOD, without which men are damned and caſt away. Yea ſuch an inſtrument it is of power and force, wher it pleaſeth the Lord,
                     The meanes whereby this Kingdome of God ariſeth in vs.
                   that it hath greater ſtrength and authoritie than all the eloquence, than all the wiſedome, than all the learning, than all the pollicie &amp; power of the worlde. Let the dayes before vs witnes to this truth, I meane thoſe primitiue times when the Lorde began to powre his mercy on mankind for Chriſt by the miniſterie of his Chriſt and of his diſciples, wherein notwithſtanding this diuine word of his was reſiſted by all the worldly gifts and powers which I named, yet had it marueilous ſucceſſe, and did wonderfully increaſe. Demoſthenes and Cicero for their eloquence, Solon and Ariſtides, for their wiſedome, Plato and Ariſtotle for their learning, Alexander and Pompey, for their manhood, were of power, of fame, and in the world, when they liued, able by theſe gifts to doe much: Yet the beſt of all theſe had much to do, euen a fewe yeres, to

keepe their owne Citizens, their owne countreymen, their owne ſubiects in obedience, and to cauſe them to giue place to good and wholſome Counſel, and to obey lawes prouided for their owne profit. Yea euerie one of them almoſt to their owne confuſion, prooued of howe ſmall force, their wiſedome, their eloquence, their power was, and with the ende of their liues, left their common weales welneere vtterly decayed and vndone. But cōtrarywiſe the Apoſtles, not learned, but poore fiſhermen, not with any inticing words of mans wiſedome,
                     The Apoſtles powrefull miniſtrie by the word.
                   not commended or ſet forth with thoſe giftes &amp; ornaments that men ſo greatly do eſteem, went foorth into the worlde preaching the diſdayned Goſpell of Chriſt crucified, and by the ſimple doctrine thereof, did in fewe yeres for the ſtate of religion chaunge the face of the whole worlde, notwithſtanding that the Empire of Rome, and other mightie principalities did to the vttermoſt of their power reſiſt it, and the reformation that by the Apoſtles in this maner was begun, continued and ſpred it ſelfe mightily, and marueilouſly, euen againſt the aſſaults of moſt cruel and tyrannicall perſecutions,

vnder Nero, Domitian, Traian, Adrian, Anthony, Diocleſian, and many mo. A force farre paſſing the power of man, that in the midſt of al ſuch bloody deaths &amp; moſt exquiſite torments, yet was able dayly to get children to the kingdome of Chriſt, yea and that ſo plentifully that well were they that might runne and profeſſe themſelues Chriſtians, that they might dye the death for it continually. It is a very notable ſtorie that is written of ſuch as this worde of the Lord had begotten to Chriſt in Edeſſa a citie in Meſopotamia, who being,
                     Ruffin. lib. 2. cap. 5. Marke this hiſtorie.
                     
                   as it is ſayd, baniſhed out of all Churches by the decree of the Emperour made their meetings in ye fileds. Which eſpied of the Emperour, in a very great rage hee ſtrooke his chiefe captaine with his fiſt, and aſked why therehence alſo they were not remoued according as he had commanded. The Captaine the next day determineth to diſpatch them, but yet in pitie to them although himſelfe a Pagan, by ſecret meanes letteth it go abroad that the next day he would deſtroy al that were found at thoſe méetings, hoping thereby to warne them to abſteine, and ſo to ſaue themſelues. But ſée ye power

of this word in the harts of men. The next day the Chriſtians, although thus admoniſhed, yet flocke thither in more plentiful ſort than at other times, yet runne headlong as it were and in great haſt, as men affraide to come to late to dye. Amongſt all, the Captaines noted a certaine woman, ſo haſtely and with ſuch ſpeede to runne out of her houſe, as that ſhee ſtayed not either to ſhut the doore of her houſe, or to put on her clothes as womanhoode woulde, and in her armes a litle infant. When hee ſawe it, he commanded to call her to him, and being come, aſked her whither ſhe made all that haſt. Into the field, ſaith ſhe, wher the chriſtians meet. And haſt thou not heard, ſayth he, that the chief Captaine is going thither, to put to the ſworde all hee findeth there. Yes, ſaith ſhe, I haue heard it, and therfore I make haſt that I may be there when hee commeth. And what wilt thou do with this yong babe, ſayth he. Take it with me alſo, ſayth ſhee, that if the Lord will, it may be vouchſafed martyrdome alſo. When the Captayne heard this, he ſtayed his courſe, commanded his charet to turne, and to the Emperour preſently he goeth, told him, if it

pleaſed his maieſtie to cōmand him death, he was ready, but to do what he commaunded he could not: for thus and thus had hee ſeene it, and ſo declared vnto the Emperor all this ſtorie. Who by and by was appeaſed, ſtayed his hande, and reſtrayned his intended euill to ſuch zealous louers of their God.
                     Rom. 1.16.
                   See nowe how true it is that the Apoſtle ſayth, it is the power of God, that is, potens inſtrumentum, the mightie inſtrument of God to get men and keepe men to the Lorde.
                     Act. 17.6.
                   They were accompted the men that troubled all the worlde, yet were they not diſcouraged.
                     De ciuit. Dei. 22.
                     
                   
                  Ligabantur, include bantur, cedebātur, torquebantur, &amp; tamen multiplicabantur. They were bound, ſayth S. Auſten, they were tormented and racked, and yet for all this they multiplied and increaſed. So was it euē in theſe latter daies of ours, when all pitie and truth was buried as it were in the bottome of the Sea, &amp; Antichriſt of Rome in his ruffe, power and ſtrength exalting himſelfe aboue all that was called God, and made Princes and Emperours to kiſſe his feete, yea when it was death almoſt to thinke of the reſtoring of true religion, euen then I ſay did this

word of the Lord in the mouth of one ſimple man at the firſt againſt the clamors of Monkes and Friers, againſt the ſcorning of Biſhops, againſt the power of the Pope, againſt the aſſiſtance of temporal Princes againſt all torments by fire, by fagot, by ſword, by impriſonment: light ſuch a candel as now ſhineth to all the Countrey of Europe, and by the power of man it cannot be put out.
                     2. Cor. 10.4. &amp;c.
                   Wherefore iudge whether the Apoſtle ſayd not true, when ſpeaking of this word, he ſayd it was a weapon not carnall, but mightie, through God to caſt downe holds, caſting downe the imaginations &amp; euery high thing that is exalted againſt the knowledge of God, and bringing into captiuitie euery thought to the obedience of Chriſt &amp;c. Wherefore we ſee by this, firſt proofe playne enough that a meanes and a moſt mightie ſtrong and powreful meanes to erect this kingdom of God in our harts, which here we pray for, is the word of God. For there is no wiſedome, no Counſell, no ſtrength againſt it. But though all the heathen rage moſt horribly, and the people imagine continually, yet it is but a vayne thing. Though Kings and Princes and all

the powers of this earth bande themſelues againſt it, yet will it not ſerue. For hee that dwelleth in the heauen ſhall laugh them to ſcorne, &amp; this word of his preuaileth where he will, to whom he will, when he will, and as long as he will. Other playne proofes, yt this is a meanes to erect this kingdome, are theſe, firſt Saint Iames, where it is ſayd: Of his owne wil he begat vs with the word of truth, that we ſhould be as the firſt fruites of his creatures. The authour of all good, ſayth Saint Iames in generall,
                     Iam. 1.18.
                   and of this good in ſpeciall, namely our newe birth, is the Lorde, and the meanes is the word euen the word of truth.
                     Ihon. 17.
                   So ſayth our Sauiour himſelfe in the Goſpel, Sanctifie them O Father with thy trueth, and what is that, thy word is truth. So ſayth Saint Paul,
                  
                     1. Cor. 4.15.
                   Though ye haue ten thouſand inſtructers in Chriſt, yet haue yee not many Fathers: for in Chriſt Ieſus I haue begotten you. (And by what meanes) through the Goſpel. And againe,
                     Philemon. 1

                        . Galat. 4.19. Galat. 3.2.
                   I beſeech thee for my ſonne Oneſimus whom I haue begottē in my bonds, to wit, by the word. And againe, this one thing woulde I learne of you, O fooliſh Galathians, receyued ye the Spirit

by the works of the lawe, or by the hearing of fayth preached vnto you? Likewiſe S. Peter, Being borne anew, not of mortall ſeed but immortal,
                  
                     Peter. 1.23.
                   
                  by the word of god. And laſtly father Abraham from heauen, They haue Moſes and the Prophetes,
                     Luk. 16 31.
                   let them heare them, &amp;c. as if hee ſhoulde haue ſayde if thou wouldſt haue thy brethren begotten to the Lord, that he ruling in them, they may rule heere with him, and eſcape that place of torment where thou now iuſtly art, the meanes truely is Moſes and the Prophets, that is the worde of God, for if that erect not the kingdome of GOD, in them it ſhall not be erected by any dead, if they ſhould riſe and be ſent vnto them. For that is the meanes which the Lorde hath ordayned, and which to this day hath had power to beget to him ſo many as he would haue.
                     Eſay 55.1.
                   Wherefore when the Lord will promiſe a bleſſing to a kingdome, Countrey, and people, that ſhall bee in deede a great bleſſing, he promiſeth this word, and this word in plentifull meaſure, and when hee will threaten a plague,
                     Amos. 8.
                   and a grieuous plague, then ſayth hee beholde the dayes come that I will ſend a famine in the land,

not a famine of breade, nor a thirſt for water, but of hearing the worde of the Lorde. And they ſhall wander from Sea to Sea, and from the North euen vnto the Eaſt ſhall they runne too and fro, to ſeeke the woorde of the Lorde, and ſhall not finde it. So then ſee wee that this woorde of our God is his mightie meanes to rayſe vp this kingdome of his grace in vs, this day when we haue it giuing ſomething, &amp; ſo as it were laying one ſtone to this ſpirituall building, the next day giuing more, and ſo laying as it were an other ſtone, and ſo on to a perfite man, and vnto the meaſure of the age of the fulnes of Chriſt,
                     Epheſ. 4.13.
                   that is till he haue wrought his wil in vs in this world and meaneth to tranſlate vs to an other. Wherefore as wee pray that the Lorde in mercy woulde erect this kingdome in vs:
                     The meanes prayed for aſwell as the thing.
                   when we pray, Thy kingdome come, ſo do we beſeech the Lorde in this petition to graunt vs all the meanes appoynted and ordeyned of him to this building, and by name this mightie meanes &amp; mercy great of his holy worde, that wee may haue it amongſt vs ſtil, and enioy it in peace, if it be his will, to the rayſing vp of theſe ſpiritual

walles of a ſpirituall houſe of God within vs dayly more and more, till it be fully finiſhed to the pleaſure of his maieſtie here, &amp; our eternall comfort heere and elſewhere for euer with him in his other kingdome of glory. And the God of heauen and all mercy grant this to vs, and make vs thankful for it.
               
                  
                     The word of God is either read or preached.
                  Now beloued, is this worde either read vnto vs, or of vs, without any preaching, or preached vnto vs? For by theſe two meanes buildeth it in vs, and not by lying in our houſes, bound in ſiluer or golde, or any coſtly ſort whatſoeuer. No, mor then the Phiſitions preſcription confected by the Apothecarie and brought vnto vs, profiteth our diſeaſe by ſtanding in the windowe, and not further touched. And therefore as I haue ſayd that it was a meanes, and proued it to you out of the ſame word, ſo let me ſay a little to you of the vſing of this meanes alſo.
               
                  
                  Of reading the word.
                  
                     TWo extremities there are,
                        Two dangerous extremities to be auoyded of all men.
                      which of all Gods choſen are to be eſchewed: the one is an eſtimation of reading ſo great, as that being had wee feele no want, neither thinke it a want, neuer or ſeldome to haue any preaching. The other is, ſo farre to extoll preaching, as that wee vtterly contemne reading, yea exclude it from all power in the bleſſing of God to worke faith in vs, or any. The meane betwixt both which is a right and true conceipt both of reading and preaching. Know we therfore that in the word they are both commended, yea commanded and ordained of the Lord, as meanes to erect this kingdome of his in our hearts, for which wee pray, and of which wee now ſpeake. And firſt for reading to name but a fewe places of a number, marke what the Lord in his law layd downe for all his people.
                        Deut. 31.9.
                      
                     Euery ſeuenth yeere when the yeere of freedome ſhall be in the feaſt of the tabernacles, when all Iſrael ſhall come to appeare before

the Lord thy God in the place which he ſhall chooſe, thou ſhalt reade this Lawe before all Iſrael, that they may heare it. Garher the people together, men, women, and children, and thy ſtraunger that is within thy gates, that they may heare, and that they may learne, &amp; feare the Lord your God, and keepe and obſerue all the words of the Law. &amp;c. See a direct commandement to reade the ſcriptures to the people as well as to preach them, and not onely that, but euen a mention alſo of profite that ſhall come thereby, namely, learning, and fearing, and keeping of the waies of the Lord. And therefore reading is not without all bleſſing. The 13. of the Acts telleth vs it was the cuſtome of the Church then to haue the Law and the Prophets read vnto the people. For,
                        Act. 13.15.
                      
                     after the lecture of the Lawe and Prophets (ſaith the text) the rulers of the Synagogue ſent vnto them, ſaying: ye men and brethren, if ye haue any word of exhortation for the people, ſay on. This godly cuſtome our Sauiour was ſo farre from miſliking,
                        Luc. 4.
                      
                     
                        16.
                      as that himſelfe willingly vſed it. In the 15. of the Acts it is

ſayd,
                        Act. 15.21.
                      that Moſes of old time hath in euerie citie them that preach him, ſeeing he is read in the Synagogue euery Sabboth day. In the 36. of Ieremy wee reade and ſee how Baruch was commaunded by Ieremy to write at his mouth,
                        Iere. 36.6.
                      or as he did indite, and tell him all the words of the Lord which hee had ſpoken vnto him vppon a rowle or booke, and then to take that rowle and to goe into the houſe of the Lord, and to reade it in the audience of all the people. In hope that by that reading vppon the booke to them in the abſence of Ieremy, who was now ſhut vp, the people might be mooued to pray before the Lord, and euery one to returne from his euill way. And Baruch did ſo twiſe. See now and marke both the warrant of reading, and a profite hoped for by it of the godly. So farre were they euer from either contemning this meanes, or frō denying it power in Gods bleſſing to worke faith and repentaunce in the hearers.
                  
                     Bullinger goeth further then I now do
                        Bullingers iudgement of the miniſters reading.
                      vpon theſe words (for I alleage them only to ſhewe the warrant of this our vſe in our Churches here in England of reading the

Scriptures to the people) and ſayth he: Ne pigeat nos laborum, ne pudeat recitationis ex libro, ſi ea deſtituamur vi memoriae, qua ſine libro memoriter verbum Domini libere annuntiemus. Nemo reieciſſe aut aduerſatus eſſe Baruchum legitur propter recitatos ex libro manuſcripto ſermones Domini. Cur ergo tu fidelem miniſtrum reijceres &amp; audire dedignareris, qui fideliter ea praelegit quae reuelata ſunt a Domino? Non dico haec, quod non niſi recitari velim ex ſcripto ſermones ad populū, ſed ſi magna neceſſitas, &amp; idoneorum miniſtrorum raritas ita flagitet, ne faſtidiant verbum dei auditores. That is: Let vs not be wearie of our labours: let vs not bee aſhamed to reade vpon the booke the worde of the Lord, if wee want memorie fully to declare it by hart or without the booke. Wee doe not reade here that any man reiected or refuſed Baruch for his reading vpon the written booke the words of God, why therefore ſhouldeſt thou reiect or diſdayne to heare a faithfull Miniſter, which faithfully readeth thoſe things that the Lord hath reueiled to him.
                        A faithfull miniſter.
                      This ſpeake I not, becauſe I would haue nothing but reading of Sermons written vnto the

people, but that if great neceſſitie cōſtraine or a want of fit Miniſters ſo require, that the hearers may not lothe the worde of God. Thus farre was he from the extremitie I ſpeake of, and his wiſedome, grauitie and deepe iudgement is knowne ſufficiently to all the learned.
                  
                     Socrates in his ſtorie reporteth thus of Atticus Biſhop of Conſtantinople,

Firſt when he obtayned the degree of a Miniſter, his ſermons that with great ſtudie and diligence he had made, worde by worde he learned without booke, and then recited them in the Church. Afterward with often vſe and diligence, he attained to greater audacitie, and began to preach ex tempore, and followed a more plaine way of teaching. Yet doe we neuer reade that the Church then diſdayned this meaſure, neither refuſed to heare him, much leſſe exclaymed againſt his miniſterie

as to him vnlawfull to vſe, and to all others to acknowledge and receiue. I lay not downe what Theodoret writeth of Flauianus,

                      When vnder the colour of deſire of perfection we can tolerate &amp; beare with no imperfection &amp; want, either in the bodie, or in the members of the Church, then doth the deuill puffe vs vp with pride, and ſeduce vs with hypocriſie, that he may pricke vs forwarde to forſake the flocke of Chriſt, wel knowing that he ſhall haue the victorie, if he can ſo doe. For when as no where els either remiſſion of ſinnes or ſaluation is to bee had, although wee make a ſhewe of a life more then Angel like, yet if with ſuch boldneſſe we ſeperate our ſelues from a Chriſtian congregation, wee become deuils.
                  
                     Iuſtine Martyr ſayth, that in his time the manner was, on the Sabboth daie,
                        Apol. pro chriſtianis.
                      when the people were gathered together, to haue the Scriptures read in the publike congregation, and in the time of publyke prayer, for the ſpace of one whole houre. And how common are theſe ſpeeches with Auſten: Ye heard when the Goſpell was

read, ye heard ere while when it was read, if ye gaue eare to the reading: deerely beloued, wee haue heard in the leſſon that hath bene read vs, &amp;c. And for the profit of reading, the Fathers and learned with one conſent haue euer ſayde that it is greate. That we feede our faith thereby,
                        The profite of the Scriptures read.
                      rayſe vp our affiance, faſten our hope, growe experte in the Scriptures, ſo that we cannot ſo eaſilie be deceiued by falſe teachers, that wee are made acquainted with the phraſe, and whereas by a preacher one booke cannot be gone ouer in diuerſe yeres, by this profitable and godly vſe of reading the Scriptures, euen all the bookes of God are gone ouer many times in one yeere, to the great inſtructiō of people, if they wil themſelues. Let no hardening therefore in the name of al blaſphemous Papiſts call reading of the Scriptures to the people in the Church a ſpirituall dumbneſſe,
                        Papiſts call reading a ſpiritual dumbnes.
                      and a thing vnprofitable, but let vs with ye choſen of the Lord euer reuerence the good of it, &amp; bleſſe God for our libertie. For it had neuer ben written in letters to this daie, it had neuer ben tranſlated into ſundrie tongues by the gift from heauen of the knowledge of tongues,

neither euer had it bene commanded by the Lord to be read to the people, if it had not bin a ſanctified meanes by him to the great good of his people and Church. Wherefore to go no further, ſince we ſee it plainly to bee of the Lord both commanded and bleſſed, let vs ſee a little, if it be not alſo ſo for the people themſelues to reade it, if they haue the abilitie. Surelie it is. For the wordes are playne:
                        Ihon. 5.
                      
                     Search the Scriptures. And they cannot with truth bee reſtrayned from giuing a warrant of reading to all men. Bleſſed is the man that meditateth in the law of God day &amp; night.
                     
                        Pſal. 1.

                     Wherewithall ſhall a young man cleanſe his waie? euen by ruling himſelf after thy worde. Are young men then boūd to rule themſelues after Gods booke, and yet no man ſuffered to looke within the leaues? A thouſand ſuch places there are, which I neede not to note. Timothie was brought vp in the reading and knowledge of Scriptures from his childhood, and the Lord hath commended it. The Beraeans tooke theyr Bibles,
                        Act. 17.
                      &amp; turned to the proues of Paulē
                      when he preached, and they are

highly commended. The Eunuch had his booke in the Chariot, and the Lord looked on him.
                        Coloſſ. 3.16.
                      The worde of GOD muſt dwell plentiouſly amongſt vs, &amp;c. as is there written, and therefore wee may reade it. We muſt take the ſwoorde of the ſpirite,
                        Epheſ. 6.16.
                      which is the worde of God, as well as eyther helmet or breaſt plate, or anie other part of our ſpirituall armour: and therefore we may reade it. Wherefore well ſayde Saint Auſten: Nec ſolùm ſufficiat quod in eccleſia diuinas lectiones auditis, ſed etiam in domibus vestris, aut ipſi legite, aut alios legentes requirite. Let it not content you to heare the holy Scripture read vnto you in the Church onely,
                        Auguſtine requireth reading of the word at home in our houſes.
                      but in your houſes alſo at home, eyther reade them your ſelues, or cauſe others to reade them. Well decreed that firſt Councell of Nice, that no houſe ſhould be without eyther a Bible, or at leaſt a new Teſtament. Well crieth Origen, 
                           Ʋtinam omnes faceremus quod ſcriptum eſt: ſcrutamini ſcripturas, Woulde God we did all as it is written, Search the Scriptures.

                     Si faciat pro nobis, that is, if he be a Papiſt, yea, and the mo wee haue in our cloſets and chambers of ſuch bookes, the holier Catholiques wee: but the Lordes booke that is able to make vs wiſe vnto ſaluation,

                      and is ſweeter than the honie, we may not touch it, we may not haue it, or reade it. For if we doe, we ſhall be heretiques. So mans worke ſhall make vs Saintes, and Gods worke diuells, Popiſh writings Catholikes, and heauenly writing heretiks, if they be read. O dreadfull blaſphemie and doctrine of death. Greate is the patience of the Lorde that putteth vp this, and beareth it daylie, when with great iuſtice heauen and earth might agree together to flaſhe out fire to conſume ſuch teachers, &amp; the other to rend in peeces and ſwallow vp the aſhes, when they art burnt of ſuch blaſphemers. Is not this to ſhutte vp the kingdome of God before men,
                        Math. 23.
                      and neyther to enter in themſelues, nor to ſuffer others that woulde enter? And Woe to ſuch, ſayth the Lorde there. Hoc non eſt ſanantium, nec viuificantium,

ſed magis grauantium et angentium.

This is not the parte of them that would heale or giue life, but rather of them that augment the burthen, and increaſe ignorance. And herein is the lawe wel verified: Curſed is he that leadeth the blinde out of the waie. What is this, but with the amazed ones in the Prophet to ſaïe: Tace, et ne recorderis nominis Domini.
                     
                        Amos. 6.10.
                      
                     Holde thy peace, and neuer thinke vpon the name of the Lord. Theſe men be the right ſucceſſours of Antiochus and Maximinus, who for lyke pollicie burnt the bookes of God, leaſt the people ſhoulde reade them. Whereas the godly and firſt chriſtened Emperor Conſtantine cauſed the Bible to be written out, and to bee ſent abroade into all Kingdomes, Countries, and Cities of his dominion. And king Adelſtane heere in England cauſed it to bee tranſlated into the Engliſh tongue that all might reade it. Of Iulian the wicked Emperour, who charged the Chriſtians with it as an high fault, that their women were ſo ſkilfull in the Scriptures. Forgetting

what Saint Hierome writeth, that all the maidens about Lady Paula were ſet dayly to learne the Scriptures. Let vs remember how many ſaued ſoules are nowe with the Lorde in reſt, that beeing able to reade neuer a word vpon the booke themſelues, yet by hearing others reade vnto thē, haue receiued bleſſing from the Lord thereof, euen to acknowledge, to reſiſt the enimy, &amp; to a ſtrength, with their blouds to ſeale the truth of that they heard, &amp; by hearing learned: beſide all other Churches, the Monuments of this our Church will affoord vs many. What manner of men and women would theſe haue beene, if they could haue read themſelues? Let vs remember what Saint Auſten confeſſeth of himſelfe,
                        Confeſſ. lib. 8. cap. 12.
                      that beeing inclined to the hereſie of the Manichees, he heard a voyce, ſaying, Tolle et lege, Take vp and reade, meaning the booke of God, which hee preſently did, and ſo by reading was conuerted. And concerning reading of the Scriptures eyther vnto the people in the Church by the Miniſters, or anie other appoynted to that ſeruice, or by the people themſelues priuatly at home in theyr houſes in a tongue that they vnderſtand.

Let vs conclude vpon playne recited proues, that it is a means of the Lord appoynted, commaunded, ſanctified, and bleſſed, to the rayſing, building, and creating this kingdome of the Lord in the harts of men, for which we praie, when we ſaie, Thy kingdome come: and to deny eyther of theſe members that now we haue ſtood of, or to ſay that they haue no bleſſing promiſed and graunted to them, but that preaching is all in all, and reading is nothing, not profitable, not able to worke faith, &amp;c. is to auouch a greate vntruth, and of ſuch deniall we may ſaie as he ſayde: Archangeli neſciunt,
                     
                        Hylarie de vnitate Patris et filij.
                      
                     Angeli nō audiuerunt, Propheta non ſenſit, filius ipſe non aedidit: The Archangels know it not, the Angels haue not heard, the Prophet hath not felt it, the ſonne of God himſelfe hath reuealed to vs no ſuch thing.
                  
                     What then, doe you match reading with preaching, or do you ſay, the people, if they hearde the Scriptures read vnto them, though they had no preaching ſuſtayne no want, neyther neede to care for preaching, or once to take anie paines to go where it is orderly, if i

be not at home?
                  No, no,
                        Preaching aboue reading.
                      for this is the other extremitie I tolde you of, euen now when I ſaid wée muſt auoyd two. Let them both therefore not onely ſtande, but ſtand with theyr iuſte and due commendations. Reading is protable, but preaching doth profite more than reading doth, becauſe it is more apt for the ignoraunt and vnlearned, expreſſing more plainly the meaning of the Scripture: and applying the ſame to their conſciences as is thought fit. Wherefore with verie fatherlie care hath the Lord in his worde appoynted, that this meanes alſo ſhoulde bee vſed to his people, to the erecting of this his kingdome in them: and telleth vs what greate bleſſing hee hath beſtowed vppon it from time to time.
                        Epheſ. 4.11.12.13.

And, go and teach all nations,

                     and holy Ghoſt, teaching them to obſerue all things whatſoeuer I haue commaunded you, &amp;c. In another place, The harueſt is great, the labourers few,
                     
                        Luc. 4.18.19. Luc. 24.27. Act. 2. Act. 8. Act. 10. Act. 13.
                      
                     praie therefore to the Lorde of the harueſt, that he would ſend forth labourers into his harueſt. Our Sauiour himſelfe of this meanes ſaith: The ſpirite of the Lord is vpon mee, becauſe hee hath annoynted me, that I ſhould preach the Goſpell to the poore, he hath ſent mee that I ſhould heale the broken hearted, that I ſhould preach deliuerance to the captiues, and recouering of ſight to the blinde, that I ſhould ſet at libertie them that are bruſed, &amp; that I ſhoulde preach the acceptable yeere of the Lord. And as he went towardes Emaus with the two that went thether, hee preached vnto them to theyr good. Peter preached the worde, and there were added to the Church about three thouſand ſoules. Philip preached to the Eunuch, he beleeued. Peter preached to Cornelius and his companie, and they receiued the holie Ghoſt, and beleeued. Paule preached to Sergius Paulus a prudent mā,

and the Lord gaue it a bleſſing, to confuſion of the Sorcerer, the ouerthrowe of Satan, and the erection of this his kingdome, of which now we ſpeake, in his heart. So did he to Lydia, and to the Iaylour, and to a number moe. By this excellent meanes of preaching he opened theyr heartes, and brought them to his folde, that he in them might raigne ouer whome Satan ſo long had ruled before, and ſo begging this his kingdome in them in this life, might aſſure them of his eternall kingdome with him in the lyfe to come. And for this ſingular profite that this meanes hath to this purpoſe, it hath as you haue ſeene from time to time bene moſt carefullie prouided by the Lorde for his people.
                        Similitudes expreſſing the profitte of preaching.
                      The ſpice when it is whole ſmelleth ſweetly, but if it bee broken and bruſed by the hande of the Apothecarie, it ſmelleth a greate deale more. So is the word read of vs, or to vs, ſweete as the honie, and bringeth the light of life to manie. But if the ſpirituall Apothecarie breake it and bruſe it, cut it &amp; diuide it, as the Lord hath appoynted by preaching, then reacheth the ſauour of ſuch heauenly ſweete to many mo, in a fuller meaſure, by reaſon of the bleſſing of this meanes, as hath beene

ſayde. If the loafe bee whole, the children get not euer ſo full morſells as when it is cut and broken vnto them: preaching parteth the bread, and maketh vs feede in this fuller meaſure, through the gracious bleſſing of our God. If the fire be couered with anie aſhes, the heate breaketh not out ſo greatlie as it would if the aſhes were awaie: euen ſo, if in the word of God, when we reade it, any one thing we vnderſtande not, as we wiſh to do, this meanes of preaching vncouereth that heauenly fire vnto vs, that earſt wee felte not ſo much, and the Lorde beſtowing his grace vppon his owne appoyntment, the fire flaſheth into our ſoules, and we, as men and women rauiſhed with ſuch heauenly good, perceyue and ſee the power of preaching. Thus did it to the Eunuch whom wee named before. What hee read at the firſt, hee vnderſtoode not: but when Philip preached vnto him, the fire brake out to his laſting good, and he vehemently cryed to be baptized. And ſo to the reſt whome ſo lately wee noted. O powreful meanes therfore of ye Lord to the erecting of this kingdome in vs, the true and plaine preaching of the word. Reading

profiteth, but preaching more: and reading therefore is good, but preaching is better. This bleſſing pray for euer amongſt vs: this bleſſing vſe, if the Lord vouchſafe it. Conſider what hath bene ſayd, and not only ſayd, but proued, that the Lorde hath appoynted this meanes as the moſt notableſt of al others to the erection of his kingdom in vs, whereof wee ſpeake that it hath had this bliſſing to thouſands and ten thouſand thouſands that haue hearkened thereunto: that the contempt of it is death, and that eternal both of body and ſoule: &amp; then waigh with thy ſelf what thou dayly doeſt. If thou wāt it, whither thou ſeeke it. If thou haue it, whither thou vſeſt it, and ſhake to thinke of thy ſhutting out of this kingdome here and for euer: for the contempt of the meanes whereby wee are brought into it all of vs. Let neither ignoraunce of ſo great a good withhold thee any longer, neither the deadly ſuggeſtions of that tempting ſo induce thee in pride to make fearefull exceptions againſt the Lordes ordynance, to ſaue thy ſoule.
                        Fearfull exceptions againſt hearing the word preached.
                      Either for that the man liketh thee not, or his meaſure, or manner, or whatſoeuer. For truely if he bring the glad tidings

of the Goſpell his feete are beautifull. If he ſpeake from the Lord he muſt be heard. And if he be the appointed meanes betwixt the Lorde and thee, I meane thine owne Paſtor and teacher, thinke whileſt it is to day of the ſtrength in deede of thy exceptions to heare him, and feare the iudgments, ſhrinke at the wrath, tremble at the vengeaunce moſt aſſured to thee without repentance: if they bee to weake. They haue not caſt thee away, but they haue caſt me away, ſaid the Lord to his Prophet then, and weigh it well, whether the Lord truly may not ſay it of thee now to thy death, refuſing the meanes appoynted by him for thy life, vpō ſuch grounds as Satan hath ſuggeſted, corruption nouriſheth, and the triumphant trueth of the Lorde will conſume in iudging day, to eternall wo. It was well ſayde of that worthy inſtrument in Gods Church vpon like occaſion. Agnoſcant Anabaptiſtae,

whereſoeuer there is a miniſter duely placed, and doth his duetie faithfully and carefully, there euery one that will bee accompted a Chriſtian muſt cleaue vnto him, and with the reſt of the flocke and congregation vſe his miniſterie. But what do they? as many of vs as will not follow their errors, although wee neuer ſo purely preach the word of God, yet do they take vs for rauening wolues, and they ſo abhorre vs, as that they thinke they ſhould commit an offence worthy death if they ſhould bee preſent but at one ſermon of ours. Then do they make ſuddenly miniſters of their owne, and they being ſo made, in a moment then doe they drawe the people and make contrary congregations of their owne, to the renting of the Church aſunder, that the name of God cannot be called vpon with that one conſent and concord that it ought to bee. Meditate many times, ere the Lord ſtrike thee, what Saint Iames ſayth: My brethren,

                     haue not the faith of our glorious Lord Ieſus Chriſt in reſpect of perſons. Faith in that place includeth the preached word, which if thou thus regard, remember the ſtripes that they ſhall haue that know their maſter his

will, and refuſe to doe it: remember whoſe head the blood is vpon, when the watchmā hath warned.

                      becauſe the Lord hath determined to deſtroy them: yet ſay I to my brethren that am the meaneſt of them all, let vs worke the worke of our calling faithfully: throwe the ſeede of the Lord into his field according to the hande that hee hath giuen, carefully: giue attendance to reading paynfully, though we neuer take degree in Vniuerſitie, paſſe with a

worthie Apoſtle through good report, and euill report, and if any man, wee thus doing, refuſe the Lords letters becauſe wee bring them, the Lords meſſage becauſe we deliuer it, the Lordes golde becauſe wee deale it, let vs comfort our ſelues with the ſame Apoſtle, that we are vnto God a ſwéet ſauour of Chriſt in them that periſh.
                  
                     
                        2. Cor. 2.15.
                     But my brethren, if wee doe it not, but giue our ſelues to eaſe and to the waies of this worlde, faſhioning our ſelues daylie more and more in an vnlawfull ſort according to the ſame, then remember, that preaching being meanes, yea ye chiefeſt meanes to erect this kingdome of the Lord in this world,
                        Rom. 10.
                      we neglecting it, we neglect alſo the effect of it, namely, the kingdome of God ouer and in his people, and ſo ſuffring as much as lyeth in vs the Lorde to loſe his people and the people to loſe their God, wee fearefully purchaſe to our ſelues that dreadfull woe that is pronounced to all them that preach not the Goſpell.
                        1. Cor. 9.16.
                      
                     Aaron ſounded wee know when he miniſtred, by his golden belles in thoſe daies,
                        Exod. 28.35.
                      and therefore he ſhall not dye,
                        Euery man in his meaſure.
                      ſayth the Lord: if wee ſound not when we miniſter by the golden

gifts giuen of the Lord, ſhal not we dye?
                  
                     And is then all that we aske concerning this matter, namely, that GOD would beſtowe his worde vpon vs, that we may reade it and heare it, and haue it preached vnto vs, to the building vp of this his kingdome in vs?
                  
                  No in deede. But foraſmuch as neither our reading nor hearing is able to profite vs anie thing vnto ſaluation, excepte the Lorde by his holie ſpirite make it fruitfull to vs, and giue it a bleſſing, therefore wee praie alſo mightilie theſe wordes, for that heauenly power of his grace, that what we reade, or heare read or preached vnto vs out of his heauenly booke by the miniſtery of men,
                        1. Cor.
                      may by him bee made a ſauour of lyfe vnto lyfe vnto vs. For though Paule preach and Appollo water, yet neyther Paule nor Apollo, but onely the Lorde giueth increaſe.
                        Num. 22.31.
                      Except the Lorde open Balams eyes hee ſeeth not the Angell of the Lorde in the way with his ſwoord drawen in his hand, that is, neyther anger nor loue perceiue we euer, except the Lord work it in vs. How came it to paſſe that the Iewiſh people ſo ſeeing dayly the wonderfull

workes of God for them, the proofes of his power, mercie and goodneſſe, aboue all the nations of the world, yet perſiſted vnfaithfull, ſtubburne, and wayward to ſo good a God?
                        Deut. 29.4.
                      O ſayth Moſes, theſe things being done for you, yet hath the Lorde giuen you an heart to perceiue, and eyes to ſee, and eares to heare vnto this daie, teaching vs playnly, that ſuch hart, ſuch eyes and eares are onely the Lords to giue, and without ſuch gift we profite nothing, no not by the verie euident extraordinarie mercies of God.
                        Chap. 30.6.
                      In another place agayne: The Lord thy God will circumciſe thine heart, &amp; the heart of thy ſeede, that thou mayeſt loue the Lord thy GOD with all thine heart, and with all thy ſoule, that thou mayeſt liue. As if hee ſhoulde ſaie, neuer thinke of anie loue of GOD faythfull and true, as poſſible to be within thee, and conſequently no obedience, loue being the root of all, excepte the Lorde circumciſe thine heart, that is, purge all thy wicked affections, &amp; giue hearing &amp; reading a bleſſing, which thing is not in thine owne power to doe.
                        Eſay. 57.
                      It is I, ſayth the Lord by the prophet Eſaie,
                     
                        15.
                      that receiue the ſpirite of the

humble and giue lyfe to them that are of a contrite heart. If the Lorde worke in one he worketh in all: the ſpirites of men are ruled and gouerned vnto good, onelie by him. If he touch vs we are touched, if hee turne vs, wee are turned, and if hee reuiue not and giue life, we ſinke in all our ſinnes, as vnfeeling wretches, and abide in death. How playnly ſayth it agayne the Prophet Ezekiel:
                     
                        Ezek. 36.26.27.
                      
                     I wil giue you a newe heart and I will put a newe Spirit within you, and will take away the ſtony heart out of your body &amp; giue you an heart of fleſh. And I will put my ſpirit within you, and and cauſe you to walke in my ſtatutes &amp;c. O ſee and marke howe all lets bee remooued, and all grace giuen by the Lorde alone in mercy, ſeeking our ſaluation. And therefore knowe it true as the truth is true that neither hearing nor reading, preaching or priuat ſpeaking auaileth euer to doe vs good except the guiding grace of the Lorde direct vs to it by a bleſſing giuen to them all or any when they are vſed. And therefore as for the word, ſo for the bleſſing of it by the Spirit of God do we euer pray when we ſay theſe words, Thy kingdom

come. Then opened he their vnderſtanding,
                     
                        Luc. 24.45.
                      ſayth the Goſpell of our Sauiour Chriſt, that they might vnderſtand the Scripture.
                     
                        Act. 16.14.
                      
                     And Lydia attended to thoſe thinges which Paul ſpake, becauſe the Lord opened her heart. So that neither one nor other, Lydia nor the diſciples of Chriſt ſee, heare, or vnderſtand, except the Lorde giue the eye, the eare, and the heart. It is the holy Spirit that teacheth &amp; teacheth into all trueth,
                        Ihon. 16.13.
                      and without whome ſtill ſtill all meanes remaine vnprofitable. There is an oyntment ſayth Saint Iohn from him that is holy,
                        1. Ihon. 2.20.27.
                      and that anoynting teacheth you all things, that is, the grace of the holy ghoſt.
                        Epheſ. 1.16.
                      
                     Wherefore I ceaſe not to make mencion of you in my prayers ſayth the holy Apoſtle and to bowe my knees vnto the Father of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, that he would giue vnto you the Spirit of wiſedome and reuelation, through the knowledge of him, that the eyes of your vnderſtanding may bee lightned, that we may knowe what the hope of his calling and what the riches of his glorious inheritaunce is in the Saints,
                     
                        Chap. 3.14.15. &amp;c.
                      &amp;c. And that yee may bee ſtrengthened

by his Spirit in the inner man, that Chriſt may dwell in your hearts by fayth, and yee may bee able to comprehend with all Saynts what is the bredth and length, and depth and height, &amp;c. See Pauls refuge for profitte to his preaching, &amp; for life and light for theſe Epheſians, euen to the Lorde for his holy Spirite to ſoften and ſupple their ſtony heartes, to illuminate and lighten their darke mindes, and to make that ſweete to them that is ſower to many, and fruitefull to them by his mightie power that is neuer ſo to any without the ſame.
                        verſ. 20.
                      Wherefore to goe no further, knowe it for concluſion, that wee praying for Gods kingdome to come vnto vs in this petition by the hearing and preaching of his worde, the meanes appoynted of him to erect the ſame, and ſeeing well by all this that hath bene ſaid, that neither one nor other of theſe meanes cā preuaile with vs any thing vnleſſe the Lorde alſo with them giue the power of his Spirit and the bleſſing of his grace in our hearts by them: therefore there is included herein alſo euen praier for this grace, and the petition being vnderſtoode of vs is thus much with the

Lord as we ſhould in playne termes ſay, O Lord giue vs not onely thy worde to reade and heare, but the heauenly grace of thy holy Spirit alſo to ſanctifie, bleſſe, and make fruitefull to vs, both our reading and hearing, that ſo reading and ſo hearing thy kingdome may come vnto vs, and thou ruling, and wee ruled, wee may liue for euer with thee according to thy promiſe. See then ſtill further matter of this petition.
                  
                     
                        Pſal. 119.
                     And ſince the Lord hath taught vs thus to pray for the helpe of his hande and the bleſſing of his grace to all the meanes of good vnto vs, and ſo guided the tongues of his children euer before this forme was layde downe vnto them though in other wordes, Let vs brethren looke vpon this occaſion into our corruption, for truely the Lorde reueileth a ſecret vnto vs of our natures, that thouſands ſée not when hee thus teacheth vs that without his Spirite no meanes profite vs. We truſt to our witts, to our ſkill, to our yeres and youth, and I know not what, and wee thinke wee haue wings of nature aboue our fellowes many of vs, to flye aloft, and to ſée the ſecretes of the Lord, but truely it is not ſo, we haue all

ſinned, and ſinne hath cut our wings, that wee cannot flye aboue, wee haue all in our firſt parentes tranſgreſſed and that tranſgreſſion hath dazeled and darkened our eyes, cloſed our eares, and benummed our heartes that we can neither ſee, heare, nor feele, except it bee giuen vs from aboue as wee haue now fully bene taught. As naturall men we perceyue not the thinges that are of GOD, we are not able to thinke a thought that is good, but all our ſufficiencie is of God, and by his grace only we are what we are that good is: if any trueth bee opened to vs, the Lord hath done it, and cō
                     cerning life eternall, fleſh and blood reueileth nothing to vs but the father in heauen: reade without this ſpirit, and the booke is ſealed to vs, heare without this Spirite,
                        Eſay 49. Ezek. 33.32.
                      and it is a pleaſant ſong that ſinketh not, but paſſeth with the time: pray without this Spirit, and we pray wee knowe not what, for it is the Spirit that helpeth our infirmities,
                     
                        Rom. 8.26.27
                      
                     and that maketh requeſt for vs with ſighs which cannot bee expreſſed. And he that ſearcheth the hearts knoweth what is ye meaning of the ſpirit, for hee maketh requeſt for the Saintes according

to the will of God. Haue not this ſpirit,
                        verſ. 9.14.15.16.
                      and be none of Chriſtes, for as many as are led by the Spirite of God, they are the ſonnes of God. Want this Spirit &amp; feare againe the ſeuere threatning of the Lawe, but haue it and cry in comfort Abba Father, the ſame Spirite bearing witneſſe with our Spirits that we are the children of God, ſealing our adoptiō in our minds, and therefore opening our mouthes. This bleſſed Spirite and ſweete grace is that heauenly water that our ſauiour ſpeaketh of in his dialogue with the woman of Samaria,
                     
                        Ihon. 4.
                      when ſitting vpon the wel with her, hee ſayde, whoſoeuer drinke of this water ſhall thirſt againe, but the water that I ſhal giue him ſhall bee in him a well of water ſpringing vp into euerlaſting life. And O my brethren how differeth all earthly water from this, if wee marke it, let a man thirſt for the honors, titles, pleaſures, places and dignities of this paynted world, and if he inioy thē euen in great meaſure, do they quench his thirſt? No truely, but if this other water bee away, I meane this moderating grace of Gods bleſſed Spirit whereof we ſpeake, they increaſe his thirſt

a thouſand fold, &amp; of a ſound man before he inioyed ſuch heapes, hee is ſtriken into a loathſome and deadly diſeaſe, euen a ſpirituall dropſie, that the more hee drinketh the more drye he is, and neuer ſatiſfied. Playing dayly and hourely the parte of Achſah in ſeeking ſprings of water to her South countrey,
                        Ioſua. 15.19.
                      that is more to much and ſtill ſomething elſe to that that is had already. But this water of Gods holy ſpirit ſpringing not out of the veynes of the earth, but from the higheſt heauens runneth about our hearts continually with a diuine vertue, moſt comfortably cooling al our Spiritual heats, refreſhing vs againſt all burning temptations, quenching the firy dartes of Satan, and finally quickning vs to eternall life. This water therefore let vs make accompt of, &amp; pray for a true faith: for he that beleeueth in me,
                     
                        Ioel. 2. 1. Theſſ. 5. Epheſ. 4.30.
                      
                     out of his belly ſhall flowe riuers of water of life, ſayth the Scripture. Quench not this Spirit then, neither grieue him by whome we are ſealed vnto the day of redemption. But remember the good that commeth by him to this wretched frame of our ſinnefull harts: the ground is hard if this dewe drop

not, and vtterly vnfruitefull if this grace bleſſe not. Lende mee therefore not thy tongue and lips only,
                        Pſal. 51.
                      but thy ſoule &amp; heart chiefly to pray with mee to the throne of mercy for our ſelues, and all O Lorde. O Lord create a cleane heart &amp; renew a right Spirit within vs euermore. Caſt vs not away from thy preſence, neither take thy holy Spirit from vs. Giue vs the comfort of thy helpe for euer, and eſtabliſh vs with thy free Spirit. Amen.
                  
                     What elſe is concluded in this prayer?
                  
                  
                     
                        The good Magiſtrate a great meanes to rayſe vp gods Kingdome. 1. Timoth. 2.
                     Another good meanes to further this kingdome, is a godly, zealous, and carefull Magiſtrate, and therefore we praie for him alſo, and the bleſſing of his ſeruice. This teacheth the Lord vs when hée biddeth vs praie for kings, and all that are in authoritie,
                        2.
                      that we may leade a quiet and a peaceable life in all godlineſſe and honeſtie. They are the means, the Lord giues the bleſſing. The lyke doth the Apoſtle when he telleth vs,
                        Rom. 13.
                      
                     
                        3.
                      that Princes are not to bee feared for good workes, but for euill. And therefore if we will bee without feare of the power that we muſt doe wel, and ſo ſhall we haue

praiſe of the ſame.
                        4.
                      For hee is the miniſter of God for our wealth. But if we do euill, that then we muſt feare, for he beareth not the ſword for naught, but is the miniſter of God to take vengeance on him that doth euill. Charging vs as well for theſe good vſes of him, as alſo for the author of his office and authoritie, which is the Lord, (for there is no power ſayth he, but of GOD, and the powers yt are be ordained of God) that euery ſoule of vs be ſubiect to the higher powers, and that we reſiſt not, for if wee doe we reſiſt the ordinance of God, &amp; they that ſo reſiſt, receiue to themſelues damnation. This benefite of a magiſtrate to the increaſe of Gods kingdome, appeared in Aſa,
                     
                        1. Kings. 15.12.
                      who tooke awaie the Sodomites out of the land, and put away all the Idols his Father had made, diſplaced his mother for her idolatrie, and deſtroyed her idolls. The like appeared in Ezekiah, Ioſiah, and all the reſt. Read what they did, &amp; ſée what authoritie may do, nay ought to doe. Vertue flouriſheth by iuſt incouragements, vice flieth, and dieth by iuſt puniſhmentes, if the magiſtrate bee good: and then ruleth God, when this is ſo.
                        Ezek. 10.17.
                      
                     Bleſſed therefore wel may

be ſaid, is the lande when the king is the ſonne of Nobles, and when the Princes eate in time, for ſtrength, and not for dronkenneſſe. That is, when the higher and lower, and all powers in a land are famous for vertue and wiſedome, and with the giftes of God. And why ſo? Surely becauſe theſe being thus, the Lord is king in ſuch a place, and his heauenly power is more and more dayly ſpread ouer and into the heartes of men by theſe meanes. Contrariwiſe,
                        16.
                      
                     Woe to the land whē the king is a childe, and the Princes eate in the morning, that is, when the chiefe of all wanteth wiſedome and counſayle, and the inferiors are giuen to their luſts and pleaſures. And why ſo agayne, ſurely becauſe then, for want of ſo forcible a meanes as carefull magiſtracie is to repreſſe it, Vice floweth, vertue flieth, and God ruleth not. Finally therefore doe we praie here in this petition, and aſke of the Lorde as a greate mercie, that he would giue vs godly, carefull, and zealous Magiſtrates, to the better ſetting vp of his bleſſed kingdome amōgſt vs.
                        Loue due to▪ Magiſtrates.
                      And truly beloued, would God the iuſt &amp; often conſideration of theſe might worke

in vs a faithful loue to thē for their pains, and a flaming thankfulneſſe to the Lorde for them when we haue them. O that wee would meditate of it vpon our beddes, and and thinke vppon it when wee are waking what Moſes felt when he ſayd: How can I beare your comberance, your charge,
                     
                        Deutro. 1.21.
                      
                     and your ſtrife alone. Or what hee felte that ſayde to his regall Crowne or Scepter, that he which knew the carke and care, the woes and griefes, the toyles and labours, and the infinit perils and feares that are incident to it, would not take it vp if he found it in the ſtreete. Then woulde wee feele what it is to gouerne and to be alofte. Then aſſuredly would wee honour Magiſtrates more, loue them more, obey them more, and contend agaynſt them leſſe, in a verie true cōſcience to deale vnkindly with a meanes ordayned in heauen of ſo much good to man. God giue vs eyes, God giue vs hearts, and God giue vs the bleſſing we ſpeake of ſtill.
                  
                     Will you goe anie further in this Petition?
                  
                  No in deede, this may ſuffice for my briefe purpoſe I hope, and therefore this

onely will I adde that which I told you of in the beginning, that as we praie for theſe mercies when we ſaie theſe words, ſo pray we as effectually in ſenſe agaynſt the contraries of them. For if Gods kingdome come,
                        All contrary things to gods Kingdome prayed againſt in this petitiō. Amos. 8.
                      then muſt bee done awaie whatſoeuer lette eyther hindereth or obſcureth the ſame: Contrarie to the vſe of the wordes that fearefull famine the Prophet ſpeaketh of, contrarie to godly and profitable reading is barbariſme, ignoraunce, and contempt or neglect of good letters, contrarie to carefull hearing is that adderlike ſtopping of our eares agaynſt the charmer, contrarie to the ſweete melting motions of Gods holy ſpirite in vs, hardneſſe, dulneſſe, deadneſſe, and vnfeelingneſſe of hart, prophaneneſſe, and whatſoeuer is the propertie of bad groūd,
                        Math. 13.
                      contrary to preaching, dumbneſſe, to playne preaching, vnprofitable curioſitie, to painfull and often, neglygent and rare preaching. Contrarie to a magiſtracie is auaricie, to a godly, a wicked, to a good a bad, and to a faythfull and carefull, a neglygent and an Idoll Magiſtrate. And to conclude, contrarie to the kingdome of God in anie of vs, is the diuel

and all his workes, the vaine pompe and glorie of the world, with all couetous deſires of the ſame,
                        Rom. 8.12.
                      and the carnall deſires of the fleſh, to follow and be lead by them. All theſe therefore we pray as heartely &amp; truly againſt, as we 
                        〈◊〉
                      for the other, whē we ſay, Thy kingdom come. And let al that heare me conſider of it what we ſee to day, namely, thus much, that if we feele no true teſtimonies in our ſoules that wee are the children of this kingdome, but enimies to it,
                        A fearefull thing if we thinke of it.
                      hinderers, letters, &amp; obſcurers of it by our workes, wordes, and thoughts, our owne tongues, and hearts, and all the tongues &amp; heartes vnder heauen, praying this prayer, riſe vp agaynſt vs, and if we will not be reformed, deſire of the Lorde that hee will take vs away, confound vs and deſtroy vs by his iudgemēts, that his kingdome may increaſe and riſe. And what fearefull thing is this? To our owne lippes the Lord wil grant the confuſion of our ſelues, the prayer of one ſhall bee heard, of two or three by faithfull promiſe, but the prayer of thouſands and ten thouſand thouſands, euen of all the Churches and choſen throughout the worlde, yea, of whatſoeuer millions in

them that praie this prayer, what a ſhrike maketh it in the heauens to the Lorde, and how will hee ruſhe vp in his iuſt conceiued anger, and accompliſhe what they aſke. Therefore with ſhaking hearts at ſo great a perill,
                        Miniſters thinke of it.
                      let vs conſider of it. Wee feeders and Fathers ſpirituall of the Lordes people, let vs thinke vpon it, and enter into accountes how wee doe, further we or hinder we this kingdome of the Lord, ſpeake wee or ſpare we, ſound we or ſinne wee, labour we or loyter wee, for Gods ſake, what doe we? Wo to vs if we do not worke, &amp; bleſſed is that ſeruant whō when his maiſter commeth he ſhall finde ſo doing.
                        Magiſtrates thinke of it.
                      Magiſtrates and powers conſider of it, put you forward or put you backward Gods kingdome, ſleep you or wake you, are you nurſes or none to the Church of Chriſt, to vertue and pietie, &amp; deſtroyers diligent of ſin and wickedneſſe, iudge you the cauſe of the afflicted and poore that you may proſper, or doe you contrarie, that you may periſh, what doe you?
                        Priuat perſons thinke of it.
                      Priuate men iudge, and euerie particular perſon one by one conſider of it. What do you? ruleth GOD in you by his holy ſpirite working faith to

God and loue to men, with daily and ſundrie fruites of them both? Doe you ſet vp in your owne houſes, places, &amp; charges this holy kingdome as much as lyeth in you by priuate admonitions, by vertuous examples, and by ſuch meanes as you may, or do you plucke and pull downe, hinder and let by the contraries greatly? As you loue your ſelues thinke of it, and then ſhall wee eache of vs ſee whether wee praie for our ſelues or agaynſt our ſelues, when we ſaie this praier, and what hope we may haue of the reſt whatſoeuer throughout this earth. Thy kingdome come is ſayd often and in many places,
                        A Communion of good by prayer.
                      if it bee well with vs for our meaſure in our ſeuerall places, then ſo often is the Lorde ſollicited to be good vnto vs, and there is a communion of good vnto the godly by theyr praiers, if it bee otherwiſe, alas the time, we periſh as we liue, if we change not ſpeedilie, and in ſome fearefull ſort to the teſtimonie of Gods iuſtice: for the prayer of his choſen, ſo many, ſo often making it, and with ſuch ſpirite of deſire muſt be heard at laſt. Thus praie wee for the kingdome of God, and for all the meanes that it ariſeth by in the heartes of

men, &amp; thus praie we agaynſt whatſoeuer hindereth or withholdeth the ſame when we ſaie this petition: and in ſtead of much more that might be ſaide, lette this ſuffice. The iniquitie of our times and the feareful looſeneſſe of theſe daies, if it be conſidered, will tell al Chriſtian hearts how ne

                     A Prayer.
                     
                        O Diuine Maieſtie &amp; moſt mightie GOD, heare vs we beſeech thee, thy hū
                        ble ſeruants heere gathered together, and in that mercie that hath no meaſure, ſubdue all power of Satan &amp; ſin in vs ſtill more and more, and rule thou euer ouer bodie and ſoule, ouer hart and minde, ouer word and worke, for Chriſt his ſake: and not onely ouer vs, but ouer many moe, euen that number that thou haſt appointed to eternall lyfe. To this ende giue thee meanes appoynted

by thee, thy holy, bleſſed, and eternall word. Make vs carefull readers of it and carefull hearers of it read vnto vs, and giue thy bleſſing as thou haſt done of olde to this indeauour. Make vs bleſſed with them that meditate in thy lawe, faythful beleeuers, as that Eunuch that had his Bible in the Chariot with him, and read in it as he trauayled. Profiting ſearchers with thoſe good Beraeans. Feede our faith, rayſe vp our affiance, faſten our hope, &amp; increaſe godly knowledge in vs, as thou haſt done by this meanes in thy children euer. Increaſe the number of able teachers to thy Church, O gracious GOD, and bleſſe their labors, a more mightie meanes to inlarge thy kingdome than reading is. Adde to thy Church by them thouſands &amp; thouſands. Caſt downe by thy mightie power all holdes, and imaginations. and euerie thing that is exalted agaynſt the knowledge of thee, and bring into captiuitie euerie thought to the obedience of thee. Strengthen thy people that they neuer deſpiſe thy appointed meanes to ſaue theyr ſoules, but that

thankfull to thy maieſtie for the thing, they may hate the perſons in ſingular, loue for their work ſake, obeying them, and ſubmitting themſelues to them, as their appointed ouerſeers of them, that they may giue their accountes with ioy and not with griefe. If it fall out otherwiſe, thy iuſt purpoſe being to ſlay thoſe diſobedient ſcorners. O Lord, O Lorde make ſtrong thy ſeruants to indure this griefe, and not fearing the face of anie whoſe harts feare nothing, nor weighing the godleſſe loue of them that loue not the cheerfulneſſe to go on through all pikes of worldly vnthankfulneſſe through good report and ill report, and all ſnubbes, knowing in a ſweet feeling that they are vnto thee a ſweete ſauour of Chriſt in them that periſh, as well as in them that are ſaued. And let it neuer be ſaid of vs, O heauenly Father, as once it was of others, that theſe things beeing done for vs, and we profeſſors of thy great mercyes, yet thou haſt not giuen vs an heart to perceiue, and eyes to ſee, and eares to heare vnto this daie, but giue vs heart▪ eyes, &amp; eares, for thy mercie

ſake. Circumciſe our hearts and the harts of our ſeed, that we may loue thee much our Lord and God, and liue with thee for euer. Reuiue the ſpirites of the humble, and giue lyfe to them that are of a contrite hart: Take awaie our ſtony harts out of our bodies, &amp; giue vs harts of fleſh. Open our vnderſtāding, as thou didſt thy diſciples, that wee may vnderſtand both by reading and preaching to our cōfort. Giue vs merciful father, that heauēly ſpirit that leadeth into al truth, that happy annointing that teacheth al things that ſpirit of wiſdōe &amp; reuelatiō that the eies of our minds may be lightned, that wee may know what ye
                         hope of our calling is, &amp; the riches of that glorious inheritāce prepared for thy Saints. That wee may bee ſtrengthened by thy Spirite in the inner man, that Chriſt thy ſonne may dwell in our hearts by fayth, &amp; we able in ſome meaſure to comprehend thy louing kindneſſe to all penitent, weeping, and wayling ſinners. For O Father we haue ſinned, and darkneſſe hath entred to rule both bodie and ſoule, if thou helpe not. Lord in that mercie that hath no meaſure looke vppon

vs, &amp; let not his malice deſtroy the workes that thy mercie hath made. His kingdom is death, thy kingdom is life &amp; ioy for euermore. O heauenly God thē let thy kingdome come, that wee ruled here by that ſauing hand of thine, may taſt and feele, inioy, and haue for euer the reward that foloweth ſuch ſubiectiō in thy glorious kingdome, not for our ſakes, but for Ieſus Chriſt his ſake, with thee and the holy ſpirite, one maieſtie, mightie and glorious, euer bleſſed and praiſed, from generation to generation eternally, Amen.
                  
               
            
            
               The third Petition. Thy will be done, &amp;c. why followeth this next.
               
                  THE order, if we marke it, is moſt fit and good: for in the former we prayed that the Lord might rule in vs, but that cannot he do if we euer remaine vnwilling, ſtirring and wreſting againſt him and his will (inter inuitos enim &amp; reluctantes nemo commodè regnare poteſt) therefore very

rightly doe wee pray now in the next place that his will may be done. And truely very duetie bindeth al children to frame their life according to the will of their fathers, and not contrariwiſe the parents to conforme themſelues to the will of their children. In the volume of thy booke, ſayth Dauid,
                  
                     Pſal. 40.8.
                   
                  it is written of me that I ſhould doe thy will. So is it of vs all: for this is a matter that concerneth not Dauid only, but euery man that hopeth and looketh for the place that Dauid now hath, and therefore with Dauid we muſt all and euery one ſay moſt hartely, O my God I am content to doe it, yea, thy law is within my hart: that is not ordinarily or ſuperficially thought vpon by me, but it is euen my earneſt and vehement meditation and deſire continually. I ſeeke not mine owne will,
                  
                     Ihon 5.30.
                   ſayth our Sauiour Chriſt, but the will of the father who hath ſent me. And let vs thinke that if he did thus that was ſubiect to no ſinne, but had receiued all power of God, and himſelfe was Lord of all, what excuſe may we haue before his gloriouſe face in that high Court of his, at the latter day, if called into the Kingdom of God, and

receiued into the adoption of the Sonnes of God, we doe not as good children, the will of our father, but as rebellious wretches euery one his owne will? Agayne I came downe from heauen not to doe mine owne will,
                  
                     Ihon 6 38.
                   
                  but his will which hath ſent me. Thus did he as a ſonne to his father, and thus muſt we doe if we be ſonnes with him. And therfore pray we euer, and pray we hartely to our heauenly father as here wee are taught Thy will be done. For not euery one that ſaith vnto me Lord,
                  
                     Math. 7.21.
                   
                  Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdome of heauen, but he that doth the will of my father which is in heauen.
               
               Why pray wee that Gods will may bee done, and not ours may be done?
               
                  
                     Gen. 6.
                           •
                        .
                  Becauſe our wickedneſſe is ſtill great in the earth, and all the imaginations of the thoughts of our harts by nature are onely euill continually. And becauſe the natural man (as ſaith the Apoſtle) perceiueth not the things of the ſpirit of God.
                  
                     1. Cor. 2.14.
                   For they are fooliſhneſſe vnto him, neither can hee knowe them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned. That is, becauſe in truth we are

ſo fallen by our firſt ſinne, and our will ſo corrupted thereby, that of our ſelues wee cannot will the thing that is good, no not thinke it, but both the will and deede, if it be good, yea and all our ſufficiencie is of him. But on the other ſide, the Lords will is all holie and euer holie: yea holineſſe it ſelfe and the rule of right for euer. Wherfore by good reaſon we pray as we do, Thy will bee done. And this being the true ground in deede of our doing, let vs by the way conſider whether euen this petition aſſureth not our conſciences of their error that ſay it, and of our truth that deny it, that in vs or any is left by nature a free will to doe good.
                     The error of freewill is agaynſt this petition.
                   For are wee not there taught to pray that his will may bee done and not ours? We ſee it. And may we contrary to this order pray that our will may bee done, that is, our owne proper and naturall will? Who will ſay it? But I will ſay it, that if I were by nature and of my ſelfe able to will the thing that is good, then might I lawfully and rightly pray that my will might be done. Wherefore we ſee and the world may ſee how euen this prayer, if there were no further proofe, yet ſatiſfieth

the conſciences of men as touching this loſſe in vs, namely, of freewill to do or wiſh good of our ſelues, till the Lord renew vs, and then is it not I, but the grace of God in me, ſayth the Apoſtle: but this doctrine hath bene ſufficiently touched before.
               
                  What will of God is here meant: for I haue heard that it is diuerſly propoū
                     ded vnto vs, though one and the ſame ſimple vnto him or in reſpect of him?
               
               You haue heard right, and to make this ſpeech as plaine as I can,
                     Oculta, reuela
                        
                           ••
                        .
                   you muſt vnderſtand that the will of God is ſayd to bee of two ſorts, to wit, hidden and reueiled. The firſt, for that it is ſo, is in Scripture reſembled to a depth, and it is vnſearchable of man. Wee cry out of it with the Apoſtle: O the deepnes of the riches both of the wiſedome and knowledge of God,
                  
                     Deutr. 29.29.
                   
                  how vnſearchable are his iudgements, &amp; his waies paſt finding out. And with the Prophet Dauid,
                  
                     Pſal. 36.6.
                   
                  Thy rightuouſneſſe is like the mightie mountaines, Thy iudgments are like the great deepe.
                  
                     Rom. 11.33.
                   We ſay of it, That no man preſume herein to vnderſtand aboue that which is meete to vnderſtand,
                  
                     Rom. 12.3.
                   
                  but that he vnderſtand according

to ſobrietie. For curioſitie in this behalfe the Lord miſliketh, we plainly ſee. When his Apoſtles aſked him of the reſtoring of the kingdome of Iſrael,
                     Act. 1.6.
                   when he would doe it, then or no, wée know he ſmot them for this entring into the hidden will of God, and tolde them that it was not for them to know the times and ſeaſons which the father hath put in his owne power. When Peter aſked the Lord of that other diſciple, hic autem quid?
                  
                     Ihon. 21.21.
                   
                  Lord what ſhall this man doe? Remember how the Lord anſwered this curioſitie of defence to know this hidden will, and tolde him that if hee would haue him tarie till he came, what was that to him, let him doe that which he knew to be done. So that this will of God is not to bee pried into, in a buſie and curious impietie of minde, as many wicked ones doe, &amp; that by moſt horrible meanes, euen by ſpirits and deuilles, ſeeking to pull out of heauen, and wreſt from the Lord, as they thinke, his ſecretes before the time. Forgetting quite what the great ſeruant of the Lorde Moſes ſayde touching this thing: namely,
                     Deutro. 29.29
                   that the ſecret matters belong to the Lorde our GOD, but the

things reueiled belong to vs, and to our children for euer, that we may do them. This wil of God is called ſecret or hidden, for two cauſes. Firſt, becauſe it is ſo in déed to all men, till ſuch time as God manifeſt by euents, what he hath appoynted to euery one. In reſpect whereof S. Iames willeth euery man to put in this condition, if the Lord will, and if wee liue to doe this or that. Secondly, becauſe the reaſon of the Lords will thus or thus,
                     Rom 9. Math. 11.25.
                   when it is manifeſted, for the moſt part is not comprehended of man, but hidden in himſelf. As why he choſe Iacob &amp; refuſed Eſau: why he put Saule away from the kingdome for one offence, and not Dauid for many with ſuch like. Onely this we knowe with the Apoſtle, that he hath mercie on whom hee will haue mercie, and whom he will he hardeneth. And this his will is our ſtay.
               What then is mans duetie in reſpect of this will.
               Surely as hath bene ſayd, non eſt curioſè inueſtiganda,
                  
                     Mans dutie in reſpect of the hidden will of God.
                   
                  ſed adoranda, it is not to bee ſifted, but highly reuerenced, and t
                     •
                  ll the tyme come that ye Lord reueile it by effects in generall thus to be diſpoſed in my ſelfe,

that whatſoeuer this hidden will of the Lord be concerning me, whether to liue or dye, to be poore or rich, to bee high or lowe in this worlde, in the ſame I reſt and am contented, let the Lord that made mee doe with me and diſpoſe of me at his pleaſure. And then afterwarde when the Lorde ſhall reueile it by effects, much more to reſt in it, and giue him thankes howeſoeuer it is, taking with good Iob euen euill thinges at the Lords hands aſwell as good,
                     Iob. 2.
                   that is ſowre as well as ſweete, and lowring lots as well as ſmiling dayes. Bleſſing the name of the Lord that hath taken what before hee gaue, and yet dealeth with vs but in mercy euer.
               
                  Doe wee pray that this will may bee done?
               
               No. For this is euer done and ſhall bee whileſt the world indureth, neither can any creature or power reſiſt it. So ſayth the Prophet. My counſell ſhall ſtande,
                  
                     Eſay. 46.10. 2. Chron. 20.6.
                   
                  and I will do what I will doe. So confeſſed Iehoſophat King of Iudah. When he ſayde, O Lorde GOD of our Fathers art not thou God in heauen, and reigneſt not thou ouer al the kingdomes of the heathen?

and in thy hande is power and might, and none is able to withſtande thee. And ſo notably confeſſed that wretched Balam when he ſayd, If Balac would giue me his houſe ful of ſiluer and gold, I cannot paſſe the commaundement of the Lorde, to doe either good or bad of myne owne mind, &amp;c. So confeſſed the deuill, when he aſked leaue to touch Iob, not able elſe of himſelfe to goe againſt Gods will, and all thoſe deuils that could not enter into the ſwyne, ſent by the will of God, and all the actions of man and beaſt euer bridled and ruled, and diſpoſed by the power of his will. No reſiſtaunce therefore can there be againſt this will, and therefore no neede that we ſhoulde pray that it may bee done. No Annas nor Caiphas, no Herod nor Pilat,
                  
                     Act. 4.28. no Iewes nor deuils coulde haue wrought the death of our Sauiour Chriſt except the hand of the Lord &amp; his counſell had determined before that it ſhoulde bee done.
               But do not you nowe ſay that GOD willeth euill to be done, and ſo make him the author of euill.
               God forbid we ſhould make God an author

of euill. Yet ſay we in deede that God willeth many things that in ſome reſpects are euill, and to ſome perſons, as this death of his own ſonne named laſt, and ſuch like. But as he willeth thē they are neuer euill, neither to ſuch as he directeth a good to by them, being not done by them, as in the example named appeareth. But ſurely ſome larger ſpeech to drawe vs to a right knowledge herein is not amiſſe, and therefore a litle I pray you heare.
                     Mans wil hath two obiects to witte good and euell.
                   Will therfore hath two obiects, to witte, good and euill, ſometime, it willing the one, ſometimes the other. And good thinges, (beſide the Lorde which is the chiefe good of all) are ſayde to be of 3. ſortes, naturall, morall, and diuine. The firſt belong, ad vitā animatam, the ſeſond, ad humanam, the third, ad coeleſtem &amp; diuinam. All theſe the Lorde willeth there is no controuerſie, and not onely ſo, but is alſo euen the fountaine and giuer, as S. Iames ſaith:
                     Iam. 1.17.
                   
                  for euery good giuing &amp; euery perfect gift is frō aboue, and commeth frō the father of lights with whō is no variablenes, neither ſhadowing by turning. So hath euil alſo his diſtinction,
                     
                        
                           Malū Culpae.
                        
                        
                           Malū Poenae.
                        
                     
                   whileſt ſome is the euill, ſome the puniſhmēt

of the euil. The diſtinction is Tertullians againſt Martion, and receiued vſually.
                     lib. 2. cap. 180.
                   That euill which is called the puniſhment of euill, there is no queſtion neither, but God willeth, and is the author of it, he being ye iudge, of whoſe warrant it is done▪ and the puniſhment it ſelfe, being a worke of iuſtice againſt ſinne, being alſo good. The queſtion is de malo culpae, of that euill that is the euill it ſelfe, howe God willeth it or not. And concerning this matter ſee firſt on the one ſide what is truth, thou art not a God,
                     Pſal. 5.4. Hebr. 1.9. Hoſe. 13.9. Ihon. 8.44. Zach. 8.17. Rom. 9.14. 1. Ihon. 2.16.
                   ſayth the Prophet Dauid, that loueſt wickednes, neither ſhall any euil dwel with thee. No, thou loueſt righteouſneſſe &amp; hateſt iniquitie, Perditio tua ex te Iſrael et auxilium a me: thy deſtruction Iſrael is by thy ſelfe, and of thy ſelfe: and in mee is thy helpe. When the deuill ſpeaketh a lye hee ſpeaketh of his owne, for hee is a lyar and the father thereof. Sée then the true author of euill, not God, but Satan. Furthermore if God be all good, how can hee will the thing that is euill, euery thing willing but that which is agreeable to the nature thereof. This ſtriueth therefore with his goodnes. It is contrary alſo to his power,

for what good that hee will is not hee able to bring to paſſe without the meanes of euill? and if he be,
                     How contrary to God it is to will euell.
                   then needeth not he to wil any euil, to the end to compaſſe ſome good by it, that otherwiſe he could not. It is cō
                  trary to his mercy, which extendeth it ſelf vpon them that haue done euill. It is contrary to his iuſtice, which promiſeth it in others. And playnely wee ſee then that the Lord doth not will any euil. Which Saint Auſten acknowledged when he ſaid, Deus non eſt author vllius rei,
                  
                     Tom. 4. quaest. 83.
                     
                   
                  qua homo fit deterior. God is neuer author of any thing wherby man may be made the worſe.
                     Exod. 9.7. Rom. 1.28. 2. Theſſ. 2.11. 1. Kings. 22.21.22.23.
                   Now on the otherſide heare againe what is truth alſo. The Lorde hardened Pharohs heart. The Lord deliuereth men vp into a reprobate mind to do thoſe things which are not conuenient, the Lorde ſendeth men ſtrong deluſions to beleeue lies, the Lorde ſent a ſpirit to ſeduce Achab, and put him in the mouth of all Achabs Prophets, with many ſuch things teſtified of the Lorde in the word, which in vs were euill, and ſéeme ſo to be in the Lord alſo, if our knowledge be not better to diſtinguiſh and to cleare him, in whom there can be no vnrighteouſneſſe

euer. Hereupon ſwell the Libertines in blaſphemy againſt the Lord, and excuſing themſelues, charge him with their wicked wayes. Hereat alſo ſtumbled the Manichees, and therfore made duo principia, two originals or firſt cauſes of actions, the one moſt good from whence came al goodnes, the other moſt euill from whence came all euill, and the puniſhment of all euill. And hereat alſo ſticke many, ſaying God ſuffereth theſe thinges to bee done, but no further. But I pray you let vs aſke them whether God ſuffer them willingly or againſt his will. If they ſay willingly, then confeſſe they that God hath a part in the action, and that is more than ſuffring: if they ſay vnwillingly, then make they him not omnipotent, for cannot he let any thing that he wil not? we know he can, and there is none that can reſiſt his will, ſayth the Apoſtle.
                     Rom. 9.19.
                   Wherfore to helpe this matter, and to anſwere with truth, we muſt vnderſtand a fewe thinges, and I pray you hearken. We muſt diſtinguiſh of ſinne, and we muſt diſtinguiſh of will.
                     Malum culpae.
                   Sinne hath two diſtinctions fit for this purpoſe to bee knowne, For either it is conſidered ſimply in it ſelfe

and by it ſelfe,
                     Vti peceatum, vti cauſa ſubſequentis peccandi, vti poena praecedentis.
                   as a thing contrary to the law of God, or it is conſidered as a cauſe of ſinne and euill folowing, or thirdly as a iuſt puniſhment of ſinne that went before. The firſt GOD neuer willeth neither can will: the ſecond ſo alſo. But in the third reſpect God is ſayde to will euill, to wit, not as it is euil but as it is poena peccati, the puniſhment of euill. Which in deede is a iuſt thing of the Lord. So doth hee puniſh ſinne with ſinne, as in the place before named hee puniſhed the Gentiles with deliuery vp to a reprobate minde to worke euil,
                     1. Rom 24.28.
                   becauſe when they knewe God they glorified him not as God, neither were thankfull.
                     verſ. 21.28.
                   
                  
                     1. Ihon. 3.4. Act. 17.28.
                   The ſecond diſtinction is this, in ſinne and all euill there is the action, and the deformitie or euill of and in the action. The firſt God may well for he is in deede the very firſt efficient cauſe of euery action according to that ſaying, in him we liue, moue &amp; haue our being, and, deus operatur in omnibus. 1. Cor. 12.16. and of him, &amp; for him,
                  
                     Voluntas tantùm est boni, vel veri, vel apparentis. Arist. Eth. 3. cap. 4.
                     
                   &amp;c. omnia. Rom. 11.16. Touching the ſecond we muſt vnderſtand that will is either proper or improper. Proper when wee will a thing for it ſelfe, either as a good thing in

deede, or at leaſt ſo iudged of vs improper when we will a thing not for it ſelfe as good of it ſelfe, but for ſome other good, that ſhal folow it. And thus may we will that thing that is euill, as a man willeth the cutting of ſome member, for the ſafety of all ye reſt. So God willeth euill things, not becauſe he alloweth them, or loueth that which is properly to will, but ſeeth in his mercy, hee ſo diſpoſing them, ſome good ſhall followe of them, which as I ſay is to wil improperly, and herein we ſée howe ſtill the obiect of will is good in the Lord. To apply then all this to God ſo farre as our queſtion requireth, let vs vnderſtand, that that euil which is a puniſhment inflicted by God for ſome former euill we may ſay that God willeth. For ſo teacheth vs the ſame God himſelfe by his Prophet ſaying:
                     Eſay. 45.7.
                   I forme the light and create the darkenes, I make peace and create euill, I the Lord do al theſe things. Marke howe the Lorde ſayth, hee createth euill. That is, the euill that is a iuſt puniſhment of ſome former euil or ſinne. The like againe by the Prophet Amos:
                     Amos. 3.6. Lament 3.38.
                   ſhall a trumpet be blowne in a Citie, and the Lord hath not done it? Out of the mouth of the moſt

high proceedeth, not euill and good? Is it not a knowne trueth in diuinitie that the Lorde puniſheth often ſinne with ſinne. Now all ſinne we knowe is euill, if we reſpect it ſelfe, but if we reſpect it as it commeth from God to puniſh ſinne withal, then is in that reſpect not euill but a iuſt, right and good thing. The hardning of Pharohs hart in Pharoh was euill,
                     Exod. 9. 1. Kings. 22.
                   in God it was a iuſt puniſhment of his ſinne. The deceyuing of Achab with a lye in it ſelfe conſidered was euill, but as God did it for a puniſhment of his ſinne it was not euill, but iuſt. That ſtrong deluſion whereof Paul ſpeaketh in it ſelfe is euill, but if we marke it, inflicted by God as a puniſhment for want of loue to the trueth,
                     Rom. 1.
                   ſo it is a iuſt thing, and not euill. So the deliuering of the Gentiles into a reprobate mind, and all ſuch examples in the woorde. Tertullian againſt Marcian,
                  
                     lib. 2. pag. 180. Tom. 7. lib. 5. cap. 3.
                   and Auguſtine againſt Iulian handle this matter, and may further bee read of it. This ſufficeth to ſhewe that although wee ſay that God willeth often that thing that in it ſelfe conſidered is euil, yet as it proceedeth from him that it ſhould be ſo, and conſequētly he the author of euil,

it followeth not. For many times euill is the puniſhment of euill, &amp; that is iuſt with the Lord euer.
               
                  
                     God may be author of the action, and yet not of the euill in the action.
                  Concerning the ſecond diſtinction how God may bee the author of the action, and yet not of the euill any way in the action, ſée by theſe ſimilitudes. The Sunne lighting with his hote beames vppon a dead carcaſſe cauſeth a ſtrong and loathſome ſauour, yet is not the Sunne either vnſwéete it ſelf, or the cauſe of that vnſwéetenes, but the carion it ſelfe. For if the Sunne were the cauſe, then euer the like cauſe, the like effect, but wee ſee it is not ſo, but contrary, when it lighteth vppon ſweete hearbes and odoriferous flowers, it draweth out of them great ſweetenes and pleaſaunt ſmels. Againe the earth wee all knowe with her ſap and moyſture, feedeth and nouriſheth al the trees, plantes, and rootes that are, yet is not that earth cauſe why this tree bringeth a bitter fruite, and that hearbe or roote a bad taſt, but the nature ſeuerall of ye things themſelues is the cauſe of that. Thirdly the pure worde of the Lorde is preached or read, and one ſauoureth and gathereth to life, an other to death and deſtruction, is

now ye word cauſe of thoſe ſeuerall effects, or the creatures themſelues bleſſed or not bleſſed with Gods holy Spirit. Thus may the Lorde then bee author of an action and yet not of the euill in the action, and ſo hee ſéemeth to will euill, when yet in trueth he doeth not.
               What is now his reueiled will?
               All that which in the holy booke of his worde hee hath layd downe and declared to be the duetie which he will haue performed of vs towards him.
               
                  And is this that will which here we pray may be done?
               
               Yea this is it, and therefore if wee will vnderſtand this petition, let vs looke what is required of vs in this worde, and all that we begge of the Lord, ſtrength and abilitie to doe.
                     Ro. 8.5.7. &amp;c.
                   We beſeech him that whereas the mindes of earthly men burning with luſtes, are commonly caried to deſire and to doe thoſe things that moſt diſpleaſe God: hee of his mercie will with the mouing of his holy Spirit ſo chaunge and faſhion all the willes of vs all to that will of his maieſtie, that we may will and wiſh nothing that his diuine will miſliketh. Praecamur

&amp; optamus, vt non tantum faciat Deus quod vult, ſed nos fac
                        •
                     re poſſimus quod vult. We pray that not onely God would doe his will, but that wee may doe what is his will, ſayth Cyprian. To runne ouer all the dueties of a Chriſtian required in the word were too long: let vs therefore not ſo doe, but for example ſake of all the reſt conſider theſe three. Firſt we knowe it is the Lords will that wee ſhould beleeue in Ieſus Chriſt whome he hath ſent, and that by faith in his name wee and all the worlde ſhould obtayne remiſſion of our ſinnes and eternall life.
                     Ihon 3.16. Ihon 6.29.
                   
                  So God loued the worlde that he gaue his onely begotten ſonne, that whoſoeuer beleueth in him ſhould not periſh, but haue euerlaſting life. And againe, This is the worke of God (that is the worke that God requireth of you) that ye beleeue in him whome he hath ſent. Wherefore in this petition wee beſeech him that that will of his may be done in vs, that is, that we may receiue grace ſo to doe, and neuer to looke for ſaluation in any other. Secondly, we knowe it is the Lordes will that wee ſhould in a true faith leade a holy and cleane life: for ſo ſayth the

Apoſtle: haec eſt voluntas dei,

                  ſanctificatio vestra. This is the wil of God euen your ſanctification, and that ye ſhould abſteyne from fornication, that euery one of you ſhould know how to poſſeſſe his veſſell in holineſſe and honour, and not in the luſt of concupiſcence, as the Gentils which know not God.
                   What do we then in this petition, but beſeech the Lord that that will may be daylie done of vs, and we daylie chaunged by the renewing grace of his bleſſed ſpirite into ſuch men and women as he deſireth &amp; delighteth in, namely, into holy creatures, walking not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit, and ſo conſequently ſauouring not the things of the fleſh,

                   but of the ſpirit. That we may be holy as he is holy. That our light may ſo ſhine before men as they may ſee our good workes and glorifie our father which is in heauen: that wee may keepe iudgement and doe iuſtice in our callings: that being buried with Chriſt by baptiſme into his death, as he is riſen frō the dead to the glory of the father, ſo we alſo might walke in newnes of life. That ſinne may not rule in our mortall bodies, that we ſhould obey it in the luſts

thereof, or giue our members as weapons of vnrightiouſnes vnto ſin.
                     Epheſ. 5.3.
                   That fornication and al vncleannes or couetouſnes may not once be named amongſt vs, as becommeth Saynts.
                     Coloſſ. 3.12.
                   That we may putte on as the elect of GOD holy and beloued the bowells of mercy, kindnes, humblenes of mind, mekenes, long ſuffring, forbearing one another, if any man haue a quarrell to an other, and forgiuing euen as Chriſt hath forgiuen vs,
                     1. Theſſ. 5.23.
                   and what ſhould I ſaie? We beſeche the Lord euen that very GOD of peace to ſanctifie vs throughout, that our whole Spirit and ſoule and body may be kept blameleſſe vnto the comming of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And with Dauid we ſaie in effect,
                     Pſal. 139.23.
                   
                  Looke if there bee any way of wickedneſſe in mee, and leade mee in the way euerlaſting. Thus ſaith Cyprian, Voluntas Dei (quam ſtabiliri &amp; fieri precamur) eſt quam Christus fecit &amp; docuit: humilitas in conuerſatione, ſtabilitas in fide, verecundia in verbis, infactis iuſtitia, in operibus miſericordia, in moribus diſciplina.
                   The will of God which wee pray to bee eſtabliſhed and done, is that which Chriſt both did and taught, humilitie in life, ſtabilitie

in faith, ſhamefaſtnes in words, iuſtice in deedes, mercie in workes, diſcipline in manners. And doe we thus pray then to be holy? O my beloued, what ſhall we anſwer the Lorde then? I ſay not for our vnholineſſe, but euen for our ſecuritie, dulneſſe, deadneſſe, and conceiued hartie pleaſure in vnholineſſe? Was it euer counted better than a mockerie to ſeeme to aſke a thing and yet to doe againſt it? To deſire a Phiſition to helpe vnto health, &amp; in the meane while our ſelues with al our might to féede vpon the foes of that wiſhed good? Conſider then our caſes and the caſes of thouſands that happely thinke not of it as they ought: we open our lippes vnto the Lorde of heauen, and pray that we may bee holie, we would bee thought by him &amp; the whole world to meane good faith, and yet what is holy we euen hate to be drawne to, miſliking none more, neither wiſhing any cōpanie leſſe thā theirs yt either perſwade vs to it, or ſeeme to expect it at our hands, and what is vnholy we wallowe in, we tumble in, we ioy in, and wee euen wiſh to liue and grow olde in.
                     Thinke of this.
                   Wee pamper the fleſh both with foode and rayment aboue all Chriſtian

licence, ſo cheriſhing, ſo coying, ſo lulling and lapping, yea ſo bathing in pleaſure and eaſe, in ſoftneſſe and tenderneſſe, in mildnes and wantonneſſe that matter of earth and wormes meate, as if wee neither thought there were corruption to rot it, heauen to receiue it, or hell to burne it. The minde wee robbe of all meditation that is holy, and feede it with matter of all helliſh impuritie.
                     Vile bookes are the deuills banners.
                   The Lords booke is layd in a corner, and the deuils banners are diſplayd in euery windowe. Our tongues cannot taſt the teſtimonies of God ſweeter than honey or the honey combe, but they can diſcourſe the delights of ſinfull fleſh that ſhall ſende to hell. Our chéekes are red to talke of Chriſt as wee goe to Emaus, and wee bluſh apace to ſeeme ſo holy, but the Morian bluſheth as faſt as we,
                     Note.
                   when fearfully and foully we ſinne againſt the Lord. We loue the wicked, wee lothe the godly, we freeze in loue, wee boyle in malice, wee ſell vertue, we buy ſinne, wee refuſe Chriſt and chooſe Barrabas, we lay away life and play with death: but O pleaſureles play in the ende!

there is no trueth, nor mercie, nor knowledge of God in the land. That by ſwearing, and lying, and killing, and ſtealing, and whoring, we breake out, and bloud toucheth bloud. And is this holineſſe? is this to pray Thy will be done?

                         your hart.
                   For Gods ſake thinke of it, and knowe with me now in time what I would be loath you ſhould know paſt time, that you may euen aſwell ſpit vppon Chriſt Ieſus, buffet him, and beate him with a Reede, kneele before him and ſay, Hayle King of the Iewes, with thoſe curſed mockers, as kneele in this Church or any where, &amp; ſay, Thy will be done, and yet neuer care how you doe it in a holy life. For it is horrible mockerie this, horrible hypocriſie, and the ende will bee euill. You muſt with prayer to bee holie ioyne care to be ſo: to bee faithfull and feruent, you muſt indeuour it, and you muſt performe it in ſome meaſure, as truely as begge it, or els as truely you periſh for euer. The Lord wil not be mocked alwaies, the Lord will not haue ſuch ſeeming prayers made, and ſuch ſinning liues retayned ſtill. Of our owne mouthes ſhall he iudge vs: therefore once againe as you loue the

Lord thinke of it, and to day harden not your hearts againſt that you heare. You heare the will of God is that we ſhould bée holy, and wee pray that this will may bee done. Prayer accepted of God may not bée without earneſt care that it may bee done, care to bee holie caſteth away the loue of looſenes, caſt away then what ſhall caſt away you if you doe not, and care for that which ſhall cauſe a comfort for euer and euer. Let not that Father ſpeake it of vs: Ad Deum omnes ire volunt, poſt deū pauci. to God would all goe, but after God will fewe goe. To liue in heauen together is better than to liue in Wilton together, and parting will bee payne, if wee part in that day. Be moued then now, that you be not ouermuch moued then, euen to crye to the mountaynes to fall vppon you, and to the hilles to couer you. Alas why ſhould I bee a miniſter of death vnto you, that ſo truely wiſh your life? or a ſweete ſmelling ſauour to my God in your deſtruction, becauſe I haue done my duetie, when I crye to the Lord yt I may be crowned with you, and neuer looſe you. As then hereafter you care to bee what in this petition you pray

to be, ſo loue you GOD, ſo loue you your ſelues, ſo loue you me, ſo loue you heauen,
                     So loue you God as you care to be, what you pray to be.
                   ſo feare you hell, and the GOD of mercie giue my ſpeech a bleſſing to vs all.
               
                  Amen, I beſeech him, now in time before the doore bee ſhut, and the bridegroome come. For in vain did the fooliſh virgins knocke when the time was paſt. But what duties elſe wil you name that God requireth, and we praie for in this petition.
               
               One moe, and that is this. It is the Lordes will that in this world we ſhoulde take vp our croſſe and followe him, as many as will be his Diſciples,
                     Math. 16.24. Act. 14.22. 2. Timoth. 3.12. Hebre. 12. 1. Cor. 11.
                   that through many tribulations we ſhould enter into the kingdome of heauen, and that all that will liue godlie in Chriſt Ieſus ſhoulde ſuffer perſecution, that if we be ſonnes we ſhould not be without correction, but now and thē chaſtned of our God, that wee may not bee condemned with the world. This will we beſeech the Lord may be done in vs, and we inabled by his holy ſpirite ſtill more and more, whatſoeuer we perceiue to betide in this life, by his good pleaſure to receiue it, and ſuffer it not onely with contented, but

alſo with gladſome hearts. And this is a chiefe vſe of this prayer, for truely it is a ſmall thing in compariſon, beloued, during the time of proſperitie and comfort, to ſaie Thy will be done O Lord, but if in aduerſitie when the world lowreth, the ſtorme ariſeth, Princes perſecute, and our owne houſes are diuided,
                     To ſaye with content vnder the Croſſe, thy will be done is a great grace.
                   our Fathers betraying vs, our children forſaking vs, &amp; our friends defying vs for the cauſe of God, if wee can then ſaie both with content and ioy, Thy wil be done, this is a ſtrength and a grace of God aboue all treaſure to be honoured. If it bee not ſo high a matter, but loſſe of goods by ſome occaſion, loſſe of friendes, want of health, and weary times by bittrr paine in bodie, or ſoking ſorrowe in minde, yet if we can herein ſay it with true content &amp; comfort, truely it is a meaſure that noteth a childe of heauen, and happie we. But O hard hard, yet not ſo hard, but God is able. For behold examples before our eyes: Old Eli in the booke of Samuel, when hee had receiued from the Lord of heauen an heauy meſſage by his young waiter little Samuel, to wit, that the Lorde woulde iudge his houſe, &amp; that the wickedneſſe therof ſhould

not be purged with ſacrifice nor offering, but vtterly deſtroied for euer, what ſaid he, but euen what here we pray, for our parts, we may be able to ſaie in our aduerſitie, It is the Lord,
                  
                     1. Sam. 3.18.
                   
                  let him doe what ſeemeth him good. That is, it is my God and my Lord, wherefore with me and mine let him doe his pleaſure, for we are his. See therfore this giuen grace, when the Lorde wil, though it be hard. The lyke did Dauid in his great extremitie when Abſolom was in field agaynſt him, and the Arke brought forth by the Prophets to bee carried with him.
                     2. Sam. 15.25.26.
                   
                  Haue the Arke of God (ſayth he) into the Citie againe: if I ſhal finde fauour in the eyes of the Lord, he will bring me againe, and ſhew me both it and the tabernacle thereof. But if he thus ſay, I haue no delight in thee, behold here am I, let him doe to me as ſeemeth good in his eyes: therfore not impoſſible we ſée, for the Lord to worke in whom he wil, though to our vile corruptiō, a hard matter in déed, Our Sauiour Chriſt in our fleſhe ſayde it with a true content, Yet not my will,
                  
                     Math. 26.
                   
                  but thy wil be done, O Father. And in vs can he worke it by his painfull ſpirit if it pleaſe

him. Good meanes to help vs are the ſundrie comfortable ſpeeches in the word concerning the Lords care ouer vs euer, and eſpecially when we haue moſt need of him, by reaſon of any woe that we are wrapped in. Our times are in the hand of the Lord, and he, not man ſhall diſpoſe of our daies. Our haires are numbered, and our teares are put in his bottell. What are haires and teares to bodie and ſoule, and other matters of ours more waightie? He careth for the rauens, lions, and birds of the aire, how much more for vs? Are we not more worth than many ſparrows,
                     Apoc. 12.
                   O we of little faith? If the Dragon would deuour vs, hee is able in a moment to giue vs wings to flie into the wilderneſſe, and to eſcape him. If he wil not, but a trial muſt be had of vs, heare and marke you, lift vp your harts and reioyce with me. Fidelis eſt Dominus. The Lord is faithfull,
                  
                  
                     1. Cor. 10. More comfort in this promiſe then can be expreſſed.
                   
                  and will not ſuffer vs to be tempted aboue that we are able, but will euen giue the iſſue with the tentation that we may be able to beare it. O ſweete, O more than ſweete, and the vnſpeakable comfort of my fraile fleſh, and all ſuch as I am. For let me doe my duetie, feare the

Lord, and make much of his lawes, cutte a peeces dayly as he will inable mee the cord of ſinne, cleaue to that which is good, and abhorre that which is euill, with a ſingle ſoule and heart, that hath no holes, if this life cauſe any worldly woe, though Satan and his friendes enuie at it, or if the Lorde pleaſe, for anie cauſe to his maieſtie knowen, to make anie trial of me, feare not, muſe not, ſigh not, ſhrinke not, my God hath giuen his word, as he is faythfull, which euer was, and euer will bee, there ſhall no more be layde vpon me, than hee, hee I ſaie that hath no meaſure of might, will make mee able to beare. Onelie doe the thing that I ought in my life nowe,
                     A moſt ſweete promiſe
                   as neere as giuen grace inableth me, and truſt to him for that day. Care awaie then, my beloued, for the croſſe, euer in the power of the Lord let vs ſaie, and ſince we haue ſuch a promiſe, lette the remembrance of it as a mightie means ſerue to work this in vs, in al aduerſitie to ſubmit our wils to his, and with true content to ſaie, Thy will be done O Lord, for euer with vs. Full is the Scripture of other comforts to ſtrengthen vs in this,
                     In the dialogue btewixt faith and frailitie.
                   but elſe where I haue noted them, and therfore

I ſpare my ſelfe as you heare. Remember then nowe, that though it be a harder matter in woe then well, to praie this prayer, yet is it not ſo harde, but the Lord hath giuen it, and can giue it at his pleaſure to his weaklinges, and make his power knowen in our weakneſſe,
                     2. Cor. 12.
                   to his glorie &amp; our good, if wee aſke. O ſwéete God, then we aſke it, and beſeech thee for the red bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, that in youth and age, health &amp; ſickneſſe, proſperitie and aduerſitie, weale and woe, thy wil may be ours, and we contented euer, Amen, Amen.
               
                  What meane the next words, Sicut in coelo, as it is in heauen? Are wee able to performe ſuch ſeruice to God?
               
               
                  
                     Aug. de tempore 136.
                     
                  Heare you what Auguſtine ſayth: Fiat voluntas tua ſicut in coelo et in terra. Quid hoc? Vt quomodo tibi ſeruiunt Angeli in coelo, et nos tibi ſeruiamus in terra. Angeli ipſius ſancti obediunt illi, non illum offendunt, faciūt iuſſa, amando illum. Haec ergo oramus vt et nos praeceptū Dei charitate faciamus. Thy will bee done in earth as it is in heauen, what is this? Surely that as the Angells ſerue thee in heauen, ſo we may ſerue thee in earth: his holy Angelles obey him,

and offend him not, but in loue do his commandements. Theſe things therefore doe we praie for, that we alſo euen of loue may doe his will. Heare you alſo what Sainct Hierome ſayth: Petimus vt imitetur Angelos humana fragilitas,
                  
                     lib. 3. contra Pelagianos.
                   
                  et voluntas Domini competatur in terra. We deſire of the Lord, that mannes frailtie may imitate the Angels, &amp; the will of ye Lord may be done in earth fullie. And in deede ſo it is, for wee doe not in this petition deſire that ſome parte of his will may bee done, For it becommeth vs to fulfil all righteouſneſſe. Matth. 3.15. but that all euen fullie and wholy may be performed: and a halfe righteouſneſſe or obedience is neither righteouſneſſe nor obedience,
                     Iam. 2.10.
                     
                   as Saint Iames teacheth vs. Non ſufficit Chriſtiano ſi vnam partem iuſticiae impleat, cui vtraque praecipitur. It ſufficeth not,
                     Ad Gelatium.
                   ſayth Saint Hierom, that a Chriſtian fulfill ye one part of righteouſneſſe, when as both are inioyned him. For, 
                     Ʋera et plena fides vniuerſa praecepta complectitur.
                  
                     Benard epist. 77.
                     
                   True and full faith comprehendeth all the commaundements, ſayth another. Yea further we are not only by duetie bound to doe all, but with all

affection alſo, with all our heart, with all our ſoule, and with all our ſtrength. For, Nec leproſa obedientia, nec canina patientia commendatur, nam velint nolint, nō modò homines, ſed etiam daemones et faciunt, et patiūtur, quod prouidentia ſumma diſpoſuit. Qui inſcij &amp; neſcientes Dei voluntatem faciunt, eorum et leproſa, &amp; 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      obedientia. Qui vero ſcientes eam, ſed reluctantes &amp; murmurantes faciunt, eorū eſt canina patientia: neutrum ergo in nobis probatur, ſed et ſcientes et volentes. Neither a leprous obedience, nor a doggiſh patience is commē
                  ded: for wil they nil they, not only men, but alſo deuils both do &amp; ſuffer whatſoeuer the diuine prouidence hath appoynted. Thoſe that vnwittingly &amp; not knowing it, doe the will of GOD, theyr obedience is leprous. Thoſe yt doe Gods will, knowing of it, but yet ſtriuing agaynſt it, &amp; murmuring, ſuch mens patiēce perforce is doggiſh. Neither of theſe is alowed, but ſuch as do Gods wil both wittingly &amp; willingly. Which perfect obedience of ours as oftē as the Scripture ſpeaketh of, it vſeth to cal vs to that coeleſte 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ,
                     Epheſ. 1.3. Philip. 3.20. Coloſſ. 3.2.
                   that heauenly regimēt, wherin perfectlie and faythfullie the Lorde is obeyed.

So doth our Sauiour teach vs, and therefore addeth heere theſe wordes, Sicut in coelo, as it is in heauen.
                   You ſee then the reaſon of them, and why they be added, euē to teach vs the meaſure of obedience that wee are to deſire and thirſt after and praie for, not halt, not lame, nor maymed, but all full whole and perfect, ſuch as is in heauen. That looke with what ſpirite, meaſure, affection and will:
                     Apoc. 7.11. Chap. 19.10.22.9.
                   with what readineſſe and alacritie the heauenly Angels and bleſſed ſpirites, Sunne, Moone, and Starres obey God, euen with the ſame we may do it alſo, that as in heauen ſo in earth there bee no rebellion nor repining agaynſt his holie will. The obedience of all thoſe heauenlie creatures I need not to deſcribe, looke but at the Angelles and you ſhall ſee three properties of their obedience, ſuch as ought to be in ours. They obey God lubentiſſime, citiſſime, and fideliſſme, moſt willingly, moſt readilie or ſpeedely, and moſt faithfullie.
                     Hebre. 1.4.
                   If they be ſent to performe anie ſeruice, they neuer murmure, but doe it: and therefore ſée their willingnes. If to execute iudgement vpon the enimies, in one night one of them diſpatcheth an hundred foure ſcore and fiue

thouſand of them, and then ſee their ſpeede: Yea they ſpare no creature, neyther giue ouer euer till the Lorde ſaie, it is ſufficient, ſtaie thy hand, and therefore faithful. They are not lyke Saul, to ſaue eyther king or fatlings: no, there is no meanes to corrupt them in their ſeruice, ſuch willingnes then, ſuch readie ſpeede, and ſuch faithfull obedience, wee are taught to deſire and praie for by addition of theſe words, As it is in heauen. For theſe Angels we know are there. And this obedience of theirs with the circumſtances, hath the Prophet Dauid layd downe, if you marke it. Pſalme. 103.20.
                  
                     Pſal. 103.20.
                  
               
               
                  Why but ſtill I ſaie, can we performe ſuch obedience as this in this life?
               
               
                  
                     1. Cor. 13.
                  No in deede. Whileſt here we liue, both knowledge and obedience are in part. And the moſt regenerate that euer was muſt praie, Forgiue vs our treſpaſſes. It is Anabaptiſticall to dreame of a perfection heere. Yet for all that, ſo perfect wee ought to be, and ſo deſirous of Gods greater and greater pleaſure in vs, and glorie by our ſeruice, as that we ſhould neuer ſtick down our ſtaffe as hauing obtayned inough, tyll

this be brought to paſſe in vs.
                     How we pray for this meaſure.
                   Therefore then praie wee for it, not as accounting to get it in this world, but as profeſſing our deſire to haue it, and our diſcontent with our obedience whatſoeuer it bee, till it bee ſuch. And if anie man will conclude anie thing vpon this forme of ſpeech, lette him conclude, that ſuch perfection wee ſhoulde performe, not that ſuch heere wee euer can performe. And if we ought to performe it as dutie due from vs, then may we pray for it, that it may be ſuch ſtill ſtil, till it be ſuch, and our prayer becommeth vs well.
               
                  What more then will you ſay touching this petition?
               
               You muſt remember how we haue ſaid that in euery petition are required of God as well the meanes ordayned of GOD to worke ſuch things as the things thēſelues that we aſke. For, Expetito fine expetuntur etiā &amp; quae ad finē. The end being deſired, thoſe things are alſo deſired which belong to the end. Wherefore vnderſtanding now what we aſke in this petition,
                     The meanes alſo aſked here.
                   euen abilitie to performe that reuealed will of our heauenly Father in his word wholy and fully, after the example of his heauēly creatures,

we muſt conſider the meanes wherby this is had, and knowe that in theſe wordes we beſeech his Maieſtie likewiſe for them to be giuen to vs.
               And what are they.
               They are chiefely two, the knowledge of his will,
                     Cognitio voluntatis, Impreſsio Spiritus. 2. Cor. 36.14. Galat 3.15.17. Deutro. 4.2.
                     
                   and the ſtrength of his grace, or direction of his ſpirit. The firſt hath relation to his word, for therehence onely is his will to bee learned, and therefore it hath pleaſed him to giue it the name of his teſtament or laſt will, and moſt ſtraitely charged that nothing bee added to it, or taken from it. The ſecond is that whereby the firſt is profitable, and ſanctified to our good. For illumination without ſanctification auayleth not, but is euen in the reprobate. And they that knowe their maſters will and doe it not, ſhall their knowledge ſaue them? Had not Iudas knowledge? there is no queſtiō, but of Chriſt hee had learned many miſteries: had not the Scribes and the Phariſées the knowledge of the lawe? Yes they were able to teach many trueths out of the ſame vnto others, and whileſt they ſate in Moſes chayre,
                     Math. 23.
                   that is, whileſt they deliuered truely the doctrine of Moſes they were

to be heard, by the commandemēt of our ſauiour, and to bee followed alſo in that they ſayd. But becauſe this Spirit of the Lorde did not ſanctifie their knowledge to them and make it powrefull in them to the death of ſinne, and the life of righteouſneſſe, but that they knew and did not, therefore for all their knowledge they periſhed: a man may ſpeake with the tongues of men &amp; Angels, and not periſh, a man may haue the gift of Prophecie, and knowe all ſecretes and all knowledge, and yet bee no body in Gods eyes. 1. Cor. 12.1, 2. Spiritus eſt qui foecundat animos.
                   It is the ſpirit of the Lord that maketh our minds fruitefull. Yea that maketh our heartes good earth to receiue the good ſéede of the worde to our comfort, that bleſſeth our knowledge to vs, to crucifie vs to the world and ſinne, and to renewe vs to the Lorde in dayly obedience more &amp; more. This Spirit alſo inſpireth our mindes to will and after giueth the effect and execution of that inſpired will.
                     Philip. 2.13.
                   
                  Deus enim ille est qui in nobis operatur &amp; velle &amp; perficere, pro gratuita ſua beneuolentia. The Lorde is hee that worketh in vs both the wil and the deede, (to wit by his holy ſpirite) euen

of this good pleaſure. And it is the God of peace, ſayth the Apoſtle, that brought againe from the dead,
                  
                     Hebre. 13.21.
                   
                  our Lorde Ieſus the great ſhephearde of the ſheepe, through the blood of the euerlaſting couenant, that maketh mē perfect in all good workes to do his will, working in them that which is pleaſant in his ſight through Ieſus Chriſt. Wherunto agreeth that of Cyprian. Vt fiat a nobis dei voluntas opus eſt dei voluntate, quia nemo ſuis viribus potens est.
                   That is, to doe the will of God, we haue neede of the will of God (to wit his aſſiſtance and ſtrength) for by his owne power no man is able. Wherefore ſince knowledge to vnderſtand Gods will out of his word,
                     Knowledge of Gods will and a bleſſing thereof to ſanctification are here prayed for as meanes.
                   and the grace of his ſpirite to bleſſe that knowledge to vs are meanes to make vs able to performe this petition and to doe his will, therefore wee pray alſo herein for theſe meanes, and the woordes are with the Lord as if wee ſhoulde euen in playne tearmes ſay: O Lorde giue vs the knowledge ſtil dayly more and more of thy will out of thy word, and giue vs the grace of thy Spirite to that knowledge, that we inabled by theſe meanes may woorke thy

will in this life as we ought.
               What elſe do we aſke in it?
               Againe, as we pray for all theſe things, ſo do we as I told you before, and muſt ſtil tel you in euery petition pray againſt their contraries.
                     The contraries prayd againſt
                   For if the one be confirmed the other muſt be ouerthrowne. Now the contraries of theſe things may be ſayd to be of two ſorts, to wit, either ſuch as doe vtterly and wholly and euer reſiſt his holy will, or ſuch as are but certaine impedimentes whereby wee do it not ſo readyly as either we ought or happely would do, if they were not. Of the firſt ſort is Satan, Sinne, and the effects of ſinne whatſoeuer, the fleſh or the old man &amp; his concupiſence, the world and ſuch like.
                     Math. 6.24.
                   For no man can ſerue two maſters, eſpecially contrary maſters,
                     Coloſſ. 38.10.
                   ſuch as God and Satan are, the Spirit of God and the fleſh, the new and the old man. Of the ſecond ſort are ouermuch care for worldly matters, feare of men, and a number of things that like weightes or burdens vpon our backes preſſe vs, or like fetters about our feete hinder vs that wee go not on altogether ſo readyly and ſo fully in this way of doing the will of God as wee in deede

ought and would, if theſe lets were not. Whatſoeuer they bee then, and of whether ſort ſo euer they be, foraſmuch as they are againſt that obedience that we pray for in this petition, therefore we deſire of the Lorde that they may bee remembred, and that no let or leaſt impediment may be to hinder that in vs which both in reſpect of his goodneſſe to vs, and our duties to him ought with all perfection both of will and worke be perfourmed. And thus might we end this petition, ſauing that ſome profitable collections or obſeruations may bee made of the words as they are layd downe here by our Sauiour.
               I pray you then adde thoſe alſo.
               
                  
                     How we fell and now may riſe.
                  The firſt may be this. Wee may obſerue and ſee here both the beginning of mans miſery, as alſo the way to draw nere againe to that olde and former innocency. Mans miſery ſprang by diſobedience to the will of God, as we all knowe, and the waie to returne to that good eſtate againe wherein we were, is obedience to that wil, as here we learne when wee are taught to praie, Thy will be done. For we pray for the reſtitutiō of thoſe graces in ſome meaſure,

which in our firſt parents were moſt perfectly. And looke then howe much wee performe to the Lord obedience, &amp; ſo much drawe we neere to an happie eſtate again. Wherefore the Lorde ſayde it,
                     Math. 12.50.
                   
                  Not euerie one that ſayth vnto me Lord, Lord, ſhal enter into the kingdome of heauen, but he that doth the wil of my father which is in heauen. And agayne, Whoſoeuer ſhall do my Fathers will which is in heauen, the ſame is my mother, ſiſter, and brother, Obedience then to his holie will is that which will ſette vs in good place agayne. And therefore trie beloued, what meaſure of this is in you, and ſo lyke or diſlyke of your ſelues.
                     A profitable examination of our ſelues.
                   Trie with what loue you heare the word, with what care you are filled to doe therafter, what conſcience you make of ſinne, what name ſo euer it haue: what ioy you haue in the workes of righteouſneſſe, what griefe if frayltie c
                     •
                  uſe a fall. If you find theſe in ſome meaſure, ſo much bee glad, if in greate meaſure, much more bee glad, for trulie ſo much haue wee lefte the waie of death, into which we are fallen all by our firſt parents, and ſo farre haue profited in the waie of lyfe, which is true

obedience. But if our conſciences accuſe vs in this trial, that we haue no deſire to know Gods will out of his word, although it bee with many mercifull circumſtances offered vnto vs, no care to liue holily, no conſcience of ſin, but ſome little ſeruile feare for dread of puniſhment, no ſpirituall ioy in well doing, no inward ſorrow for euill doing, then tremble we and feare we before the Lorde of heauen and earth, for as yet we are in the waie of diſobedience, which is the waie of death, whereinto our firſt parents fell: we are buried in our corruption, and dead in ſin, not riſen with Chriſt, wee are heapers vp of wrath againſt our ſoules in the daie of wrath, &amp; contemners of the word, which in ſuch ſorte hath beene preached vnto vs, for which cauſe that ſame worde ſhal iudge vs in the laſt day, and we ſhal periſh. Trye then I ſay, and ſo lyke or diſlyke.
               
                  
                     Ihon. 12.48. Merit ouerthrowne.
                  Secondly, learning by theſe wordes, (As it is in heauen,) that our obedience ought not to be lame or maymed, but euen ſuch both for will and worke, as that of the heauenly ſpirites, we are notablie taught what colde comfort there is for vs in our ſelues, and how farre it is off, that we, or anie

liuing ſhould be ſaued by theyr works.
                     Much leſſe workes of ſupererogation.
                   For dare any of vs ſaie we obey the Lords will in earth, as it is obeyed in heauen, and that there is no imperfection in vs more heere than there? If wee dare not, if wee cannot, then you ſee wee haue not done all that is commaunded, and therefore farre from being iuſtified by that meanes when we haue not done our dutie. Cleaue wee therefore faſt vnto our true ſafetie Ieſus Chriſt the righteous, and awaie with ſuch dreames.
               Thirdly, doe we not ſee that this prayer wholie, called the Lordes prayer, and this petition particularly, is preſcribed by the Lord vnto al Chriſtians, men and women, of what degree, eſtate and calling ſo euer they be, and none exempted? We ſee it playnly, for to all it is ſayde in the Diſciples, that haue bene, are,
                     No eſtate of perſons priueledged more than other from doing Gods will.
                   and ſhall be to the worlds end, whē you pray, pray thus. We ſee it then by conſequence agayne, that all degrees, eſtates, and callings are bound to performe vnto the Lord ſuch perfect obedience as heere is noted, and not Monkes, Friers, Nunnes, or ſome certaine ſorte of this order or that onely, which yet hath ben

taught vs, and that others taking ſome more libertie, might find mercie with God for theyr prayers, and ſtrict obſeruation in truth, not of Gods will, but of ſome ceremonies of theyr own deuiſing.
                     Popiſh error.
                   But it hath mightely ben ſhewed to the world, and our eyes al, that euery plant which the heauenly Father hath not planted, ſhal be plucked vp, and therefore let vs beleeue no ſuch follies. If we be the Lords, we acknowledge our ſelues bound to performe as full obedience as is performed in heauen, and that is as much as anie of theſe deuiſed orders could performe, and a litle more to I trow. And therefore no immunitie to vs, neither further yoake to them, that I know of, if this petition ſtand.
               
                  
                     The cauſe of all euill.
                  Fourthly, we may here verie wel learne the true cauſe of all ſuch hurlie burlies in ye worlde, of warres, of ſchiſmes, of hereſies, of ſtrifes amongſt neighbours, and finallie of all calamities, euen this: Quod neglecta voluntate Dei, ſuo quiſ
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      ſenſu rapitur: that euery man ſetting aſide ye will of God (which aboue al ſhould be regarded) is carried with his owne liking and will in all things. Wherefore as one ſayth, Oremus

Deum, vt ſpiritum filiorum det nobis, &amp;c. Let vs beſeech the Lord to giue vs the ſpirites of ſonnes and children, that renouncing our owne will, we may readily &amp; hartely ſubmit our ſelues to his will, and not with lippes, but life, ſhew that wee praie it earneſtly, Fiat voluntas tua. Thy will bee done.
                  
               
               Fiftly, praying that his will may be done in earth, wee acknowledge euen in this worlde alſo a place wherein God ought to rule, and not onely in heauen. And therfore are iuſtly occaſioned as oftē as we ſay this prayer, to gro
                     •
                  e in our ſpirites, and ſighe with right ſorrowful hearts to ſee yet how farre that is of. To ſee what diſobedience there is in euery degrée, yea, what ſtubborn rebelliō and defiance, as it were, with this will of God where it is knowen, but much more to ſee what thouſandes and millions there be that knowe it not, what whole nations, kingdomes, and Countries. And if they knowe it not, ill can they doe it. But where are theſe grones and ſighs? Where is that plentie of water that guſhed out of Dauids eies for like cauſe? Aſſuredly, beloued, if we had ſent forth theſe meſſengers

to the Lorde, and deliuered theſe tokens of inward zeale for his glorie and our bretherens good, ere this day long, they had perced the heauens, and the Lorde of the vineyard had ſent foorth labourers to breede knowledge, knowledge had diſplaced ignorance &amp; rebellion, and wrought true ſubmiſſion in many thouſandes of ſoules to this heauenly will that here we ſpeak of.
               Sixtly, if we did not ſee this rebellion of the world agaynſt the Lord plaine inough, yet doth this verie petition ſo teach it, that we cannot denie it. For why ſhould we be taught to praie that his wil may be done, if it were done, and that he may be obeyed in thoughtes, wordes, and deedes, if he were not fearefully diſobeyed in them all. If then both one and other ſheweth it,
                     A profitable meditation to wake vs and weyne vs from the loue of this world.
                   alaſſe what cauſe haue we to delight heere to liue and dwell as we do? Nay what true matter herehence may we gather to defie it and to weane our ſoules frō it as the Lord wil ſtrengthen. It is a place of rebelliō againſt our God, a ſink of ſin, a cage (ye Lord knoweth it) of vncleane birds, a ſepulchre, though outwardly faire &amp; painted, yet full of rottē bones, yea rottē bodies, and defiled ſoules,

with horrible pollutions. Mundus totus in maligno poſitus, in hoc virtus et pietas patiuntur, in hoc mille technae ad fallendū, quocun
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      reſpicitis impurus eſt totus, et ſordeſci

                      indies magis magiſqúe, &amp;c. This worlde is wholy ſet on miſchiefe, in it vertue and godlineſſe ſuffer, in it are a thouſand ſubtilties to deceiue, which way ſo euer thou lookeſt in it, altogether impure is it, and the impuritie of it ſtill daily more and more increaſeth, ſometimes tyrantes diſturbe the publique peace, ſometimes heretiques oppugne the truth, ſometimes priuate perils moleſt and grieue, and what euer comfort yeeldeth it, that is true and permanent? He that had the moſt proofe of the pleaſure of it that had euer anie, and by proofe might ſpeake what hee founde in them, hath thus deliuered to al eares for euer,
                     Ecleſ. 1.
                   that they are vanities all and vexation of Spirite. The worlde will promiſe her ſeauen yeeres ſeruants faire and wiſhed Rachael,
                  
                     The world kepeth not promiſe.
                   but when performance ſhould be, thē commeth Leah with her ſore eyes, that is, a ſubtill ſleight to diſappoynt thy paine, &amp; a worſe reward than thou ſerueſt in hope of. It will promiſe promotion high and lofty to prodigalitie,

but it wil pay the contempt bitter and grieuous for thy beggery, when al is ſpent in hope of that promotion. By mariage it promiſeth many comforts, but howe often payeth it many cares with ſops of ſorrow, that ſoke full deepe. The world is full of falſe Prophets that will keep Achab from good Micheas councell: full of falſe marchants that will ſhew foorth the better end of the peece, and ſaie the reſt is like, when it is farre otherwiſe: ful of cunning fiſhers, that vnder pleaſaunt baites haue hidden hookes to deſtroy vs if we bite: full of ſuch golden ſtrumpettes as that of Babylon, which in cups of gold giue drinke that killeth euen to hell: full of ſmooth alluring Iahels, which ſtand in their tent doores &amp; ſaie to men,
                     Iug. 4.18.
                   
                  Turne in my Lord, turne in vnto me, and feare not, but if in they come and fall to ſleepe, the nayle and the hammer walke, to theyr wofull ende and fall: full of flattering Ioabs that can ſaie with a ſmiling face, how doeſt thou my brother Amaſa, and ſtab him in that he ſhall not anſwer: ful of trecherous Iudaſes, that with a kiſſe betray theyr deereſt maiſter. And alaſſe what place is this? Runne ouer the greateſt

things that here we haue, or can haue, and ſee what is linked to them. If a man haue riches,
                     Note.
                   what feares and cares hath he with them? If honours, what burthens and feares againe of a fall? If a man haue friends, what a do to keepe them? Our bodies haue diſeaſes, our mindes haue paſſions, neighbors be comfortable, and to liue ſole is ſolitarie: yet ſee diſcōforts, one toutheth our goods by law, another our name by ſlander, this hateth vs, that enuieth vs, another flattereth, another deceiueth, another beareth falſe witneſſe againſt vs: with a thouſand ſuch.
                     One croſſe counteruaileth a thouſand comforts.
                   And if we be diſcontented and croſſed but in one thing (ſee the miſery of this wretched world) though we inioy a thouſand contentes, yet grindeth that daie and night vpon vs, and al our contents are as nothing to vs, becauſe of that one diſcontent. The triall was had of that wicked Haman, who though he had many &amp; great preferments to reioyce in, yet felt hee them all eclipſed, and as it were taken from him by this one griefe, the life of Mardocheus before his face. And what ſhoulde I ſaie? Would God wee did it often with profite, what wee may doe euer with griefe, to the

better weaning our ſelues from this world of woes, euen ſearch and ſee into the manners of it in euery place, in euerie age, and in euery ſort of perſons. Shall we not ſee of all the things that are accounted of, nothing ſo little accounted of as ſinne? Shal we not ſee iuſtice ſolde, veritie wreaſted, ſhame loſt, and equitie deſpiſed? Shall we not ſée the guilty quitte, and the halter put ouer the innocents head? Shall we not ſee the wicked aduanced; and the godly depreſſed, wreaked and wronged, and troad vppon? Surely we ſhall ſee fooles bid ſpeak, and wiſe men bid peace. Yea, we ſhall ſee euery mans mouth ouer foule with looſeneſſe, and fewe mens liues gouerned with vertue. Alaſſe then againe, what a place is this? Shall the ſinnes of himſelfe make the Apoſtle crie, Cupio diſſolui, I deſire to bee looſed, and to be with Chriſt. And ſhall not all the ſinnes of ſo ſinfull a world together with our own, make vs deſire it? What pleaſure had the good prophet, who for the very ſinne that he ſawe, hee deſired death.
                     1. Kings. 19.
                   Did not our Sauiour ſay it when time was, Non rog
                        •
                      pro mundo, I pray not for the world?
                   And ſhall wee ioy in the

place ſo fearefully excepted in the prayer of Chriſt. If wee thinke heauen to bee our home, are we not ſo long from home as we are heere? If to depart here hence be to go to lyfe, is not to tarrie heere to abide in death? If that life be freedome, is not this bondage? Finally, if to bee with God bee our true felicitie, to be abſent from GOD is it not our ſure miſerie?
                     2. Cor. 5.
                           •
                        .
                   But whileſt we are at home in the bodie, we are abſent from God, ſayth the Apoſtle, and therfore think of it. What may you now think you beloued, to ſtaie you from a true and Chriſtian lothing of this wretched life in ſo vil
                     •
                   a world. Truely I knowe not, excepte you ſhould vnwiſely ſaie, there be few that doe it, and many that doe it not. Which if you ſhould ſaie, then muſt I anſwere you as he did that ſaid it. Neque minor erit gloria tua ſi foelix eris cum paucis, ne
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      poena leuior ſi miſer eris cum ſtultis. Neither ſhal thy glory be leſſe if thou be happie with fewe, neyther thy puniſhment lighter, if thou be miſerable with many. But I hope you are far from being holden in euill with ſo bad arguments, and therfore I pray you let vs all remember what is ſayde vnto vs: Loue

not this world,
                     
                        
                           •
                        . Ihon 2.
                   neither any thing that is in the world. For if wee loue the world, the loue of the father is not in vs. And the Lord ſtrengthen vs.
               Seuenthly, we ſee heere by this petition and forme of praier, the verie true nature of a childe of God, namely to deſire, &amp; pray heartely, that both in himſelfe and others, Gods wil may be knowen and done. Yea, ſo heartely and earneſtly doth he wiſh this, that to ſee the contrarie, is a vexation to his ſoule very vehement and great. And he deliuered iuſt lot,
                  
                     2. Petr. 2.7.
                   ſayth Sainct Peter. vexed with the vncleanly conuerſation of the wicked. And, I ſaw the tranſgreſſours, ſayth Dauid, and was grieued becauſe they kept not thy word,
                  
                     Pſal. 119.15.
                   
                  yea, mine eyes guſh out with teares for this cauſe. But of this ſome thing was ſayde before.
                     Laughing at other mens▪ faults.
                   The Lorde enter not into iudgement with vs euer, for the want of this ſorrow to ſee other men doe euill, ſaying nothing of our ſelues, &amp; our owne euill. For how may we anſwer, not our ſorrowing, but our laughing, euen as wee were tickled, to ſee dronkards, to heare rimers and railers, and idle counterfaiters, tearing their tongues againſt

theyr teeth, to the diſhonour of God, the gauling or ſlaunder of others, and the death of their owne ſoules for euer without repētance, which in many of them God may worke: but it is ſmally to bee hoped of as yet. God that ſhall iudge vs knoweth it, and telleth vs now whilſt we haue time to leaue it, that wee cannot anſwer it. The Lord therefore chaunge vs, and wee ſhall be chaunged, and make the breach of his will to touch vs deepely both in our ſelues and others.
               Laſtly wee may note here, if there were no other Scriptures to ſhewe vs, what an acceptable thing to the Lord the readie and carefull doing of his wil is, by this that our Sauiour placeth this petition amongſt the firſt and chiefe deſires of his children: wee may ſee our dulnes that muſt be taught to pray for this obedience, and wee may ſee Gods rich &amp; great goodneſſe that wil giue vs ſtrength to obey him, and then crowne vs for ſo doing with an immortall crowne, as if wee had done all of our ſelues. The Lord giue vs feeling. And let thus much ſuffice of this petition.
               
                  
                  A Prayer.
                  
                     O Sweete and gracious Father, how deere both is &amp; ought to be to a good child the goodwill of his earthly Father? And if ſo, how much more deere to thy child the iuſt and euer holy will of thee his heauenly father. In deede hee ſhould pray with hart &amp; ſoule that it may be done. And therefore feeling our onely ſweete comfort this, that wee are thy children, wee againe and againe beſeech thy maieſtie that it may ſo be. Concerning thy ſecret will reſerued to thy ſelfe, O Lord let vs neuer curiouſly bee ſearchers and ſeekers to knowe aboue that which is meete for vs to knowe. Much leſſe let vs giue our ſelues by ſpirites and deuilles and vile meanes to wring out as it were by force from thee the knowledge of tymes and ſeaſons, and matters reſerued in thy power: but let vs euer concerning this, bee thus diſpoſed by thy grace in our ſelues, that whatſoeuer this hidden will of thine ſhal be concerning

vs, whether to liue or dye, to bee poore or rich, to be high or low in this world, with the ſame and in the ſame wee reſt and be contented: ſaying in our harts as obedient children, let my God and Father do with mee and diſpoſe of mee at his pleaſure. And when it ſhall appeare and be reueiled to vs, then euen more, if more may bee, to be contented, giuing true and hartie thankes to thy maieſtie as well for wo as well, for little as much, for lowe degree as high degree, if ſo thy pleaſure be, taking well in worth as thy ſeruant Iob at thy hands euill things as good things, ſower as well as ſweet, and lowring nightes as well as Sunneſhine mornings. Deere GOD make vs euer bleſſe thy name with a ſingle hart when we knowe thy will, and till thou ſheweſt it, leaue it to thy ſelfe. Concerning next thy reueiled will, that is, all that which in thy worde thou haſt layd downe and declared to bee the duetie which thou wilt haue performed of vs toward thee, O Lord of mercie wee beſeech thee that whereas our mindes burning with luſts are commonly caried to deſire and to

doe thoſe things that moſt diſpleaſe thee, thou of thy gracious goodneſſe wouldeſt vouchſafe ſo to chaunge vs by the power of thy bleſſed Spirite, that we may wil and wiſh nothing but what thy holy will alloweth. Giue vs faith firme and ſtedfaſt in thy Sonne our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt. And to this faith ioyne in mercie a pure and cleane life, graunting vs grace to poſſeſſe theſe veſſels in holineſſe and honour, and not in the luſt of concupiſcence, as the vngodly doe. O pardon herein, for the bloud of Ieſus, both words and workes ſtraying from thy will. To name them it is vnpoſsible, for we cannot thinke of them: yet thou knoweſt them, and with thee is mercie euen for ſecret faults. Giue vs of thy ſtrength alſo, O bleſſed Lord God, that wee may beare and ſuffer all croſſes, diſeaſes, pouertie, cōtempts, perſecutions, and aduerſities, with al the changes and chaunces of this mortall life, not onely with cōtēted, but with gladſome harts, knowing that it is thy will that wee ſhould crucifie and mortifie our willes. And when that appoynted paſſing hower

ſhall come, that earth to earth and aſhes to aſhes is to returne, O Lorde make vs ſtrong to welcome in this alſo thy will. And finally what obedience we owe to thy maieſty, giue it vs good God that as thy Angelles and heauenly creatures moſt willingly without grudging, moſt ſpeedily without delaies, and moſt faithfully without affection and partialitie doe their dueties, ſo wee may performe and doe it, to our liues ende and euer, as it ſhall pleaſe thee to inable vs, for his ſake whome thou loueſt, Chriſt Ieſus thy ſonne and our moſt deere and bleſſed Sauiour. Amen.
               
            
            
               
                  The 4. Petition. Giue vs this day our daily bread.
               
                  Two thinges I haue to aſke you heere touching the order before you come to the words themſelues. Firſt, why theſe three Petitions concerning our neceſsities followe vppon the other which concerned Gods glorie. Secondly, why of the three this is firſt, ſeeing the other two concerne better things?
               
               
                  
                  
                     Math. 6.
                  To the firſt, I anſwer you, that being warranted by the Lord after the ſeeking of his kingdome and the rightuouſnes thereof, which ought to bee firſt, to ſeeke alſo at his hands whatſoeuer we haue neede of to the maintenance and good of this life, wee hauing done the former in the petitions before, fitly followeth the other now in theſe three.
                     Pſal. 4.6.8.
                   And this is the order that Dauid vſeth in his Pſalme: firſt crauing the light of the Lords countenaunce to bee lifted vp vpon him, and then aſſuring himſelfe next of peace and ſafetie, the benefites of this earthly life.
               
                  Yea ſir, but doth not our Sauiour ſaie expreſſely:
                  
                     Math. 6.
                   
                  Bee not carefull for your life, what ye ſhall eate, or what ye ſhall drinke, nor yet for your bodie what ye ſhall put on, but ſeeke ye firſt the kingdome of God and the rightuouſneſſe therof, and all theſe things ſhall be ministred vnto you: for your heauenly father knoweth that ye haue need of theſe things? Why then ſhould wee expreſſely pray for that, which both he knoweth wee want, and hath in mercie promiſed vs?
                  
               
               Although our Sauiour ſay, they ſhalbe

miniſtred vnto vs, in that place, yet doth himſelfe bid vs pray for them expreſſely in this place: and therefore well we knowe by thoſe words there he meant not to exclude this meanes heere. The examples alſo of his childrē which haue done it, and the manifold promiſes made to all them that ſhall doe it, which will appeare to vs hereafter, tell vs the ſame. If you will know the reaſon why, vnderſtande you, not for that he would not otherwiſe giue them to his children that ſéeke his kingdome chiefly, except they were by name aſked, or for that he giueth them for their aſking (which in deede he giueth fréely) or for that he hath néede to bee remembred, but in deede that by ſuch prayer wee might witneſſe vnto the world that wee acknowledge the Lorde the very fountayne &amp; ſpring head of all theſe things alſo that concerne either bodie or minde, that we might thus learne to depend vpon him fully and wholly and in all things,
                     Iam. 1.17 Pſal. 37.5.7.
                   and whatſoeuer is wanting to vs to flye to him, not to truſt in our ſelues, or in man, or in any arme of fleſh whatſoeuer.
               What ſaie you to my ſeconde demaund?
               
                  To your ſeconde demaund I aunſwer thus, that albeit the things that are contayned in the next petitions bee of more price than thoſe that are contayned in this, yet hath the Lorde ſet this before them not without cauſe, euen to releeue thereby our infirmitie, which doe not ſo eaſely &amp; quickly perceiue or pray for heauenly things as earthly things. The fift petition beggeth remiſſion of ſinnes: the ſixt, an inuincible conſtancie and holy fortitude in temptatiō: theſe are great matters concerning our heauenly life, and therefore not ſo neere to our dull conceipts and knowledge. The matters of this petition are more eaſie and better felt of vs, and therefore in a moſt mercifull wiſedome our Sauiour beginneth with the eaſier, and ſo draweth vs to the harder by degrees, that hauing had tryall of his goodneſſe in the one, wee might nothing doubt of his mercie in the other. Hauing felt him friendly in matters of leſſer good, wee might full accompt of fauour in things of greater good to vs.
               Yet muſt I needs obiect vnto you the prayer of Agur, which proceedeth not in this order, but firſt deſiring

that God would remoue farre from him vanitie and lies (matter belonging to the mind) in the ſecond and latter place aſketh foode conuenient concerning the body.Prou. 30.8.
               
               And I haue already anſwered your obiection ſufficiently, if you marked it. For I haue ſayde in reſpect of the matters themſelues things belonging to the mind are to go before things belonging to the body,
                     This order reregardeth our infirmitie, not the nature of the things.
                   &amp; ſo no doubt woulde our Sauiour haue ſet them, if he had regarded that onely. But looking from that to our infirmitie &amp; dulnes, he hath placed that firſt that was beſt knowne to vs, and ſo from the more known draweth vs to the leſſe knowne: from the eaſier to the harder, and from the earthly to the heauenly. Like a good teacher that wiſhing the profitte of his ſchollers, deliuereth to them the lighter leſſons firſt, and milke before meate, that is ſtrong for men.
               You ſatiſfie me well, proceede therfore now, if you pleaſe, to the words themſelues, this is inough concerning the order.
               Content, if this be noted in a worde before: that although wee bee nowe come to

matters that concerne our ſelues and our owne profit and haue paſſed ouer thoſe that concerne Gods glory, yet may wee not thinke that wee haue nowe done with the Lord and his honor quite, but this onely is the difference, that then wee reſpected the Lorde onely wholly and immediatly, now wee regarde our ſelues and our neceſſities with him, and him, as we vſe to ſpeake, mediatly. For otherwiſe euen all the thinges we wiſh and do, muſt regard the Lorde and his holy honour, according to the Apoſtle, ſaying,
                     1. Cor. 10.31.
                   
                  Whether yee eate or drinke, or whatſoeuer ye do, do all to the glory of God. And according to the confeſſion of Saint Auſten, Sufficiētia vitae rectè appetitur,
                  
                  
                     Aug. epist. 121. ad Probam.
                   
                  non propter ſe ipſam quidem, ſed vt eam habētes commodius Deo ſeruiamus. Things fit for this life are rightly requeſted, but not for themſelues, but that hauing them we may better ſerue God. The true knowledge of this putteth a notable bitte in the mouth of our vntamed deſires, and draweth them euer in theſe worldly commodities to that meaſure and maner that may ſtand with the Lords honour. Whereas otherwiſe when it is forgotten or not known

there is no meaſure in our coueting, no honeſtie in our vſing, no credit in our leauing them.
               
                  Panem.
                  Nowe come wee to the woorde, and the firſt as you ſee is this word Bread. Which both in Scripture and in godly writers is taken diuerſly. In the ſixt of Iohn it ſignifieth Chriſt himſelf,
                        Ihon. 6.48.51.
                      becauſe as breade and fleſh, meat and drinke are to the vſe of this tranſitorie life, ſo is Chriſt ſent from the Father to vs, for the getting and keeping of euerlaſting life. Ioſua ſayde,
                        Num. 14.9 Ecleſ. 11.1. Rom. 9.17.
                      
                     feare not the people of the Land, for they are but bread for vs, that is a thing that wee ſhall ouercome and deuoure. The preacher ſaith Caſt thy breade vpon the waters, that is, be liberall to the poore. Stolne waters are ſweete ſayth the harlot in the Prouerbes, and hid bread is pleaſant. By bread there meaning adulterie &amp; pollution of the fleſh. In the Prophet Eſay,
                     
                        Eſay 30.20 1. Kings 22
                      it is called the breade of aduerſity, in an other place breade of affliction. Sometimes againe it ſignifieth the benefites of Chriſt, as when he ſayde, It is not lawfull to take the childrens bread, and to giue it to dogges,
                     
                        Math. 15.
                      that is

the benefites principally appoynted for the Iewes, which are children, &amp; to giue them to you Gentiles which be dogges.

                      Sometymes it ſignifieth doctrine and inſtruction out of the worde whereby our ſoules are nouriſhed as with ſpirituall bread, no leſſe than our bodies with materiall breade, and thereupon the want of the word called a famine, as you haue heard. With many moe ſundry ſignifications if it needed to repeate them, but let theſe ſuffice. Here in this petition it is taken in his owne proper ſence and ſignification, for ſuch bread as we eate and are nouriſhed withall. Yet figuratiuely it ſtretcheth it ſelf further than to bread only, and includeth whatſoeuer is neceſſary to the ſuſtentation of this life. So ſayth Saint Auſten, Neceſſariam corporis exhibitionem petimus aperte in pane, ſignificantes quicquid eſt nobis neceſſarium. All needfull maintenance of the body wee aſke in this petition playnly in the word bread,
                        For this cauſe ſome haue thought panem to come of the Greeke word 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                      ſignifiing whatſoeuer is neceſſary. Nay, ſo ſaith the ſcripture in many places, ſhewing this largeneſſe of the word. Jn ſudore vultus tui veſceris pane tuo. In the ſweate of thy browes ſhalt thou eat thy bread.
                      That

is, whatſoeuer thou inioyeſt in this worlde of theſe earthly things, thou ſhalt come by it by labour and trauell, and not by breade onely.
                        2 Kings. 6.2.
                      When Elizeus bad the king ſet breade before them, you ſee what the king did, hee made them very good intertaynement. All Iobs kinred came to eate breade with him, that is,
                        Iob. laſt. 11.
                      to reioyce and be mery in all good ſort with him:
                        Gen. 11.
                      when Abraham prayed the Angels to ſtay and hee woulde ſet a morſell of bread before them, he meant by bread more than bare breade. When Dauid ſayd, he that did eat of his bread,
                        Pſal. 141.10.
                      lift vp his heele againſt him, he meant by bread familiaritie, truſt and credite, and a very neere coniunction of friendſhip. So was it vſuall you ſee with the Hebrewes, in this word to cōprehend all neceſſary ſuſtenance of the life.
                  And why thinke you?
                  Happely becauſe bread is moſt vſual and moſt neceſſary. For many haue bread that haue no meat, and they that haue both may yet better ſpare the one than the other, although neither well. As I remember the Duke of Saxonie Frederike, is ſayde to haue cauſed his people to ſée, when going

                      and ſéeing his ſeruants ſo careleſly and badly to ride ouer the corne and to ſpoyle it, when hee came home, commaunded that their meate ſhoulde bee ſet before them as plentifully as euer, yea and better if it might bee, but neuer a morſell of bread all that day. The ſeruice being ſtraunge, and no man knowing the cauſe, at laſt the good Duke ſent them woorde that if they ſawe any vſe of breade to their comfort, let them learne to take more care of corne hereafter, and not for any pleaſure or paſtime to ride ouer it, and ſpoyle it as they had done that day. A worthy example ſure for all Princes and Nobles to follow, euer making conſcience of the Lords bleſſings to ſpoyle them for any vayne delight and paſtime. Some other reaſon may be giuen alſo of frugalitie, as that we are thus admoniſhed to be content with a litle, and to ſay with the Apoſtle cheerefully and heartely:
                        Philip. 4.11.

                     I can bee abaſed, and I can abound, euery where, in all thinges I am inſtructed, both to bee full and to bee

hungry, and to abound &amp; to haue want. I am able to doe all things through the helpe of Chriſt which ſtrengthneth me.

                      or for great liuings and honours, but for bread, bread, and that but for the day, and therefore a ſtint made aſſuredly of our immoderate deſires. If the Lord giue more, be thankefull and vſe it well, but if he giue but bread, that is a litle bee very hartely well content euen with that alſo, for therfore is it only named here to teach vs ſo. Sit oratio, quae pro temporalibus eſt, circa ſolas neceſſitates reſtricta. Let thy prayer which thou makeſt for temporall matters be reſtrained euer to things neceſſary, ſaith Bernard. For he yt would ſay in his prayer, for example, ſayth Auguſtine. Doie multiplica diuitias meas,

And they that wil be rich fall into temptation and ſnares, &amp; into many fooliſh and noyſome luſtes, which drowne men in perdition and deſtruction: for the deſire of money is the roote of al euil, which while ſome luſted after, they erred from the faith, and perced them-ſelues through with many ſorowes. And moſt ſwéetly in ye Epiſtle to the Hebrewes.

                     Let your conuerſation be without couetouſnes, and bee content with thoſe things that ye haue, for hee hath ſayd: I will not fayle thee, neither forſake thee, So that we may boldly ſay. The Lorde is my helper, neither will I feare what man can do vnto me.
                     
                        Rom 13.14.
                      Finally take no thought for the fleſh, ſayth the word againe to fulfil the luſts of it. Thus do you ſée then very fitly may we learne by the Lords naming of bread only, barely by it ſelfe, and neither of gold nor ſiluer, nor other ſtatelynes, to be content with any litle that the ſame Lorde ſhall thinke good to giue vs euer:
                        O thinke of this, and God giue ſtrength.
                      and not greedely to wiſh for any wanton aboundance. Pray this prayer

then beloued with your heart, and thinke of this note. For the Lorde knoweth howe fraile fleſh miſliketh litle, &amp; ſéeketh much: that walowing in wealth, it might walow in woe an other day: rechleſſely ouertaken with the pleaſures of this life, through abilitie to haue them, further than GOD wil warrant, when he falleth to recken.
                  Why Sir is it not lawfull to pray for wealth and riches?
                  You haue hearde before that whatſoeuer is needefull to the life of man is included in this word bread, and prayed for here.
                        Some men may pray for more than others may.
                      And you muſt know alſo that this needefull is meaſured according to mens ſeuerall callings &amp; charges, for great men haue néede of more than meane men, and of both ſorts they that haue more charge either of children or other neceſſary ſeruants about thē, haue neede alſo of more. Wherefore if their neceſſaries be great abundance,
                        Rich Craſſus ſayd, to be rich was to be able to nourriſh an army yearly.
                      euen that great abundance is lawfully prayed for by warrant both of this petition and much other Scripture. But if we go from neceſſaries, to ſuperfluities, (as in deede the deſire of man is) to the ende hee might bathe himſelfe in pleaſures, that fleſh feedeth vpon

moſt greedely,
                        Luc. 16.19.
                      be clothed in purple and fine linnen, and fare moſt deliciouſly euery day, though wofully he cry when that folly is faded, for one drop of water to coole his tongue in the burning lake: then muſt wee remember that a wiſe man prayed not ſo, but euen flat contrary,
                        Prou. 30.8.
                      ſaying Lorde giue me not riches (hee meaneth ſuperfluitie aboue neede) and addeth this reaſon, leaſt I bee full and deny thee, and ſay who is the Lord. Which reaſon the more we meditate vpon, the more ſtrong ſhall we ſée it: this vſually being a fruite of wanton ſuperfluitie,
                        O fearefull frute.
                      to forget our God. Beholde ſayth the Lord to his people Iſrael, I will bring thee into a good lande,
                     
                        Deut. 8.7. &amp;c.
                      
                     a lande in the which are riuers of water, &amp; fountaines, and depths that ſpring out of valleyes and mountaines. A lande of wheate and barley, and of vineyardes and figgetrees and pomgranats, a lande of oyle oliue, and hony: A lande wherein thou ſhalt eat bread without ſcarſety, neither ſhalt thou lacke any thing therein, a lande whoſe ſtones are yron, &amp; out of whoſe mountains thou ſhalt digge braſſe.
                     
                        Here is the danger.
                      
                     But beware, leaſt when thou haſt eaten and

filled thy ſelfe, and haſt built goodly houſes and dwelt therin, and thy beaſts and thy ſheepe are increaſed, and thy ſiluer and gold is multiplied, and all that thou haſt increaſed, (beware I ſay againe) leſt then thy hart bee lifted vp, &amp; thou forget the Lorde thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the houſe of bondage &amp;c. Beware leaſt thou ſay in thyne heart, My power and the ſtrength of myne owne hande hath gotten me this abundance, but remember the Lorde thy God. For it is he which giueth the power to get ſubſtāce &amp;c. You ſee what a daunger the holy Ghoſt hath here diſcouered in abundance of earthly things to lift our heele againſt the Lord, what a vehement caueat he hath giuen, and as ſure as wee liue,
                        Pſal. 49.
                      it is a thouſand to one we do it. If riches increaſe ſayth he againe by his Prophet, ſet not thy heart vppon them: as if he ſhoulde ſay thy nature is to do it. And charge thē that be rich in this world,

                        A great example.
                      
                     that I haue built for the houſe of the kingdome by the might of my power, and for the honor of my maieſtie. And by and by the hande of the Lord was vpon him, reade it, &amp; reade many times it is a great example. What a damnable dreame was proude Haman in by reaſon of his grace in Court,

Can our ſoules wiſh a better example to tell vs the danger of earthly greatnes, if the Lorde aſſiſt not ſlyding nature? But theſe were ſtraungers all from God, you wil ſay, and therefore no proofes but that wee which knowe more,

may doe better, though we ſwim neuer ſo much in all abundance? well ſée you then the fault of better,

                      Whereupon Iob glorieth of it as of a ſpeciall grace vpon him beyond the courſe of any whom the Lord aſſiſteth not, that hee neuer made gold his hope, neither ſaid to the wedge of gold, thou art my confidence: that he neuer reioyced becauſe his ſubſtance was great, and ſo forth. The heathen knewe the danger, and therefore vſually handled it as a tryed trueth, that proſperitie is hardlier wel indured thā aduerſitie. Saint Auſten ſayde it,
                        Three good Mothers bring forth three bad children: truth hatred, familiaritie contempt, and riches pride.
                      and knewe it true Diuitiarum morbus ſuperbia. The diſeaſe of riches is pride, and would God we knewe not to much experience to inferre agaynſt all denyals this wofull concluſion in our dayes. And to tell vs all, that honors, and eaſe, and abilitie, to haue what either wanton will can wiſh, or our owne, or other wild heads deuiſe, baniſheth too often religion, and all his exerciſes,
                        Too true though too bad.
                      priuate or publique,

cooleth and quencheth all heauenly heates, forceth away, as too melancholike fooes, all ſweete meditations of Spiritual cauſes, and giueth the bridle to all damnable pleaſure and dreadfull ſecuritie. But they ſhal know one day, and let vs ſée now, that if the Lorde giue vs but dayly breade that is thinges needefull, not needeleſſe, a moderate, a competent, or ſufficient portion to paſſe this life along withall, aſſuredly he hee doth that which is ſafeſt for vs, in reſpect of our great propenſion to abuſe his plentie: and good cauſe we ſhould without any muttering for more, be contented with it. Yet ſhould greater plentie cauſe greater pietie, greater zeale, greater thankfulnes and all good,
                        Iob. 1.9.10.
                      but alas it is not ſo. The very deuill coulde ſay that it was no maruell if Iob feared God, ſéeing that God had made an hedge about him, and about his houſe, and about all that he had on euery ſide, and had bleſſed the worke of his hands, and his ſubſtance was increaſed in the land, and yet are not many of vs able to reaſon thus to the ſtirring vp of our obedience to the Lord for his graces to vs, albeit wee woulde bee iudged great Chriſtians. The Lorde quicken

vs. For aſſuredly to whome the Lorde hath giuen much, of them hee will require much, and they ſhall anſwere him.
                  It needeth not that wee runne ouer all particulars, ſeeing thus much now is ſaid, that in the word bread is contained all that wee may haue any way neede of to this life?
                  It were an infinite matter ſo to do, and in deede not needefull, therefore let vs conſider that we aſke herein, foode and raymēt and whatſoeuer we want. Houſes to dwell in, Pſal. 107.36.

For honeſt name and fame, credit and fauour with men as ſhalbe good for vs, and a thouſande thinges moe that this life hath neede of.

                        •
                      of the particulars of this generall word bread.
                     I ſee here their doubt is plainly diſſolued, that make a queſtion whether a Chriſtian may pray for the outward thinges of this worlde, becauſe the Church muſt bee ſubiect here to perſecution?
It is very true: for here is a ſhort commandement

to do it,
                        Math. 7.7. Pſal. 55. Mar.10.29.
                      
                     Giue vs this day our daylie bread: beſides other generall charges in the word. Secondly, wee haue his promiſes many and mercifull concerning theſe things, and what he promiſeth to giue we may be bolde to aſke. Thirdly,
                        Gen. 28.20.
                      we haue the examples of his children, as of Iacob when hee went to Padan Aram, ſaying: If God wil be with me, and will keepe me in this iourney which I go, and will giue me bread to eate and clothes to put on, ſo that I come againe vnto my fathers houſe in ſafetie, then ſhall the Lord bee my God.
                     
                        Prou. 30.7.
                      Of Salomon that prayed for foode conuenient, and neither for riches nor pouertie. Of Leapers that prayed to bee clenſed: of blinde men that prayed for ſight: of men and women many in the Goſpell that prayed for their diuers diſeaſes and infirmities, and were healed of our Sauiour without any rebuke euer for their ſo doing. Fourthly, becauſe the Lord muſt euer haue a Church, but that cannot be without food, gouernment, peace, health, and ſuch like: therefore it is lawfull to aſke them. Laſtly, becauſe the aſking and expectation of theſe thinges is a notable exerciſe of our faith,

hope and truſt in Gods promiſes. For we cannot aſſure our ſelues of theſe corporall goods, neither aſke them, except we bee in Gods fauour, and feele in our ſelues good comfort of his good will towards vs. By aſking therefore wee exerciſe our faith to beleeue the Lord to be our good God: from which goodneſſe of his wee looke for theſe things, ſo farre as they may be good for vs. Otherwiſe the Lord might ſay to vs, you are none of that number that I promiſed theſe things vnto.
                        Earthly and outward things are lawfully prayed for, but euer with a condition.
                      But yet this euer muſt we note concerning the maner of our prayer, namely, that it be cum conditione voluntatis, with condition of his good pleaſure, will and liking: and, in hunc finem vt ſeruiamus Deo, &amp; proximo: for this ende that we may ſerue God, and our neighbour, by them, and with them. For who thus begge thē not, are not heard: that is, theſe things are not giuen them to their good: but although they receiue them according to their deſire, yet is God offended with them, and they receiue them to their iudgement. But ſpirituall things wee may aſke ſimply and without condition, becauſe GOD ſo hath promiſed them, and they euer profite vs: as

wee may ſimply deſire the holy Ghoſt, becauſe the Lorde hath ſimply and expreſſely promiſed him to them that aſke him, and ſo of other matters, whereas theſe earthly things now are good, and now euill for vs: and therfore left to the pleaſure of him that knoweth what is beſt.
                  
                     What is the reaſon of the next word Our, and why is it called Our bread?
                  
                  Not of merite or of due debt, but in reſpect of our neceſſitie which cannot be with out it. And ſee then I pray you, what great Gods we are become by our firſt parents eating of the forbidden fruite,
                        We be goodly Gods that cannot giue our ſelues a peece of bread.
                      ſurely euen ſuch as are not able to liue, &amp; haue our being in this world without a peece of bread to ſupport &amp; hold vp, which peece of bread wee are not able to giue our ſelues, if wee periſhed ten thouſand times for want of it, but we muſt haue it giuē to vs by him that is good in deede. This is the truth of that Serpents ſaying. You ſhall not die at al:
                     
                        Gen. 3.4 5.
                      
                     but God dooth knowe that when yee ſhall eate thereof your eies ſhall be opened, and you ſhall be as Gods, knowing good and euill. Yet cannot this and many thouſand of lies moe, make mee leaue

hearkening to his hiſſing. Secondly, it is called our Bread, to teach vs to be content with that portion which he vouchſafeth to giue vs, and not to bereaue anie others of that which is theirs. Either our neighbors of their liuings, our ſeruāts of their wages, o6ur workmen of their hire, or any one what ſoeuer of his owne. For that is not ours that is another mans, and therfore we cannot make this petition to the Lord, but our owne tongues ſhall bee our accuſers to the Lord. For we ſhall in wordes aſke but ſo much as may truly bee counted our owne, (as being got by ſuch meanes as he alloweth) and yet in deede are not ſo contented, but rake and rob, and pull from many men that which is theirs,
                        Conſider this.
                      and not ours: How this toucheth many a man, I wiſhe verie hartely may be concluded by priuie feeling of ſecret guilt, &amp; not in any broder tearmes layde open by mee. Surely beloued, it is a grieuous matter to diſable my ſelfe to pray the Lords prayer or anie part of it: but ſo doe all they that are not content with ſo much bread as is their owne, of which they may trulie ſaie, it is ours, and therefore beware. Thirdly, this worde Our, truly confirmeth

the property of goods, wiues, children, ſeruants, and ſuch like amongſt Chriſtians, contrary to all prophane and brutiſh community, either by Anabaptiſts or other heretikes whatſoeuer ſought to be eſtablyſhed. A long and a large matter if it needed a confirmation, or a confutation.
                  
                     And why doe we ſaie Dayly Bread, or bread for the day?
                  
                  The Lord hath pleaſed ſo to call it, firſt, to note out vnto vs our mortalitie and fading eſtate, if he ſhould not euen dayly feed vs. Secondly, to teach vs, that it is our dutie dayly to aſke what dayly we neede, and not to make our praier at once for a yeres, or many yeeres prouiſion, becauſe wee woulde take our libertie to praie no more. Thirdly, that thus hee might bridle ſomewhat our raging hearts, and our endleſſe greedie, and inſatiable deſires. For many of vs are neuer ſatiſfied, neuer pleaſed with any meaſure of bleſſing giuen vs by the Lorde, but euer crauing and crying, more, more. This immoderate humour and ſinfull vaine the Lord ſeeketh heere to helpe, teaching vs to bee ſo farre from wiſhing heaps or any wanton delicates, that we are

content with dayly bread, that is, with ſo much as ſerueth for that daie, and as ſhall be fit to preſerue life honeſtly, not wantonly. Knowing it and feeling in the faith of a childe of God: that a ſmall thing vnto the iuſt man is better than greate riches to the wicked and mightie:
                     
                        Pſal. 87.16.
                      
                     and againe, if nothing wanteth to them that feare the Lord, that is, no profitable and neceſſarie thing.
                        Pſal. 34.9.
                      The wiſe man ſayth it: The Lord will not famiſh the ſoule of the righteous, but he caſteth away the ſubſtaunce of the wicked. The King and Prophet ſayth, I haue bene young, &amp;c. Cyprian ſaith, Quum Dei ſint omnia, habenti Deum nihil deerit, ſi Deo non deſit. And Fides famem non timet. That is, ſince all things bee Gods, howe ſhall hee that hath God want any thing, except God be wanting to himſelfe. Faith feares no famine. Laſtly, to aſſure vs that ſo well our wants are knowen to the Lorde, as that for euerie daie he can tell what is ſufficient, and what we haue neede of. Therefore when it is ſayde in the Goſpell,
                        Math. 6.32.
                      
                     Your heauenly Father knoweth what yee haue neede of. We may adde euerie houre, euery day, and

doe it by warrant of this worde in this petition. A moſt comfortable thing truly to euerie one, and eſpecially to them that haue any great carke vpon their hands, eyther of children or otherwiſe. For it aſſureth thē that theyr God is priuie to their eſtate, yea ſo priuie, that he knoweth for euerie day in the weeke, and for euery day in their liues what they haue neede of, both for themſelues and their charges, and euen for that cauſe, namely, that they ſhould knowe it to be ſo, he hath cauſed them to praie but for theyr dayly bread, not naming anie quantitie, but leauing that to himſelfe, who knoweth better than themſelues what will ſerue the turne, and will moſt aſſuredlie euer ſend it them. I praie you then thinke of it, and ſo earneſtly thinke of it, as the knowledge and remembrance of it may euer keepe vs from diſtruſt in ſuch a God, and from the effects of diſtruſt, namely, the vſe of anie badde meanes to releeue theyr wāts by. For the Lord knoweth our néed, and euerie dayes neede, yea, euerie houres neede, and his word is paſt, that he wil not onely knowe it, but releeue it, as ſhall bee beſt. I will care for thee, I will not fayle

thee, neyther forſake thee, ſayth the Lorde. And therefore caſt thy care in comfort vppon me.
                        1. Peter 5.7. Hebre. 13.5.
                      What an incouragement alſo may this be euer to vs, to goe to our knees, and to call vpon our God by prayer, when wee heare how priuie he is to our eſtate. If we haue a petition to a man, our ſpeeding often lyeth vpon our vtteraunce: if we ſpeake well we ſpeede well, but if either for feare, or baſhfulneſſe our tongues fayle to tel our caſe in ſuch full ſort as is needfull it ſhould be knowen to the winning of releefe for it, then fayle we alſo often either of all or part of that wee ſeeke. But (O happie we) it is not ſo with GOD. If we cannot vtter a word, oppreſſed with ſome woe, or otherwiſe hindered, if we but ſigh, he heareth, he ſeeth, knoweth, and knoweth more fully, than wee coulde tell him our ſelues in anie wordes if wee did ſpeake. With what a cheere then may we fall before him for any thing we want, and ſaie, Lord thou knoweſt what I would haue, though my tongue foulter, my want ſpeaketh: looke vpon me in thy mercie.
                  
                     It ſeemeth by this, that laying vp is vnlawfull.
                  
                  
                     You iudge amiſſe, for Ioſeph in the cheape yeeres layde vp for deere, and ſo ſaued his owne, his maſters, and many liues moe, and the Lord directed him to this prouidence. The Diſciples of Antioch ſent theyr abilitie to the brethren in Iudaea, and it was reſerued and layde vp till the famine came that Agabus had propheſied of. Act. 11.28. Chriſt badde gather vp the broken meate, and let none of it bee loſt, the holie Ghoſt ſayth, the children lay not vp for the Fathers, but the Fathers for the children, warranting as you ſee, a laying vp: &amp; much more proofe if it needed is there. Wherefore by praying for daily bread, or bread for the daie, we are taught to bee content if the Lorde giue no more, but wee are not forbidden to reſerue it, if the Lord doe giue more, for the Lordes giftes may not be caſt awaie by anie negligence coloured from this place? Yet muſt our reſeruation bee voyde of couetouſneſſe, made onely in the reuerence of the Lords giftes, to lawfull endes, and not to truſt in anie ſtore, and to robbe the poore and needie when want is.
                  
                     What ſhall wee anſwere then to thoſe

wordes of Chriſt, Care not for to morowe, for the morowe ſhall care for it ſelfe, &amp;c.
                  
                  We muſt aunſwere thus, and aunſwere trulie, that our Sauiour there forbiddeth vs to thinke of the morowe with diſtruſtfulneſſe, but not with prayers and labours.
                  
                     How can rich men pray this prayer that haue bread for many dayes and yeeres.
                  
                  Becauſe all vſe and comfort and ſafetie of thoſe riches commeth from the Lorde. Which except the Lorde giue, eyther they looſe by ſome accident their goods, or hauing them they haue no power to vſe them, or vſing them, they nouriſh not, as after is proued.
                  
                     But if it be Our bread, why ſhould we pray the Lord to giue it, the vſe beeing to aſke that which is not ours?
                  
                  If it were ours by duetie, you might be thought to ſaie ſome thing, but if it be ours but by mercie, as you haue bene tolde, you ſaie nothing, for thinges in mercie giuen muſt in a feeling of miſerie be aſked: &amp; that it is mercy, let Iacob tell vs, that great ſeruant

of the Lordes, who yet confeſſed that he was not worthie of the leaſt of all the mercies that GOD had giuen him, much leſſe are wee. See you further and I praie you marke them, what profitable things this word may teach vs. Firſt, it teacheth vs, that God is the author and verie ſpring head of all good, be it ſpirituall or corporal that commeth vnto vs. And conſequentlie we are admoniſhed of our miſerie, that are not of our ſelues woorth a peece of bread, but made beggers of it at his handes that onely dooth and can giue it. If we bee not worth ſo much, ſurely wee are not woorth the kingdome of heauen and euerlaſting life. This, little thinke they that like brute beaſts ſit downe to eate their giuen bread, and riſe agayne when they are filled, not once eyther in heart or voice, remēbring the giuer of it. Let ſuch remember what the Apoſtle teacheth, that the creatures of God are not ſanctified vnto vs, ſo that wee may vſe them with a good conſcience,
                        1. Tim. 4. Aues prius dulce melos fundunt, quàm granula quaerunt.
                        
                      but by the word and by praier. Let them looke vpon the little birdes, which ſing ſo ſweetlie in their kind, before they ſeeke for meat in the morning. It teacheth vs agayne euer ſo to

get our wealth and riches in this life, as we may truely ſaie and comfortably feele that the Lord hath giuen them. Which we cannot, if ſtealth be the means, or vſurie, or oppreſſion, or any condemned way whatſoeuer. For then the deuill helpeth vs, and when anie loſſe happeneth of them there is a double griefe, one at the looſing, and another at the ſecrete thought of the iudgement of God ouer thinges not well come by. When as if the meanes be good, as right inheritaunce, or true labour with Iacob, to our maſters or ſuch like, then are our gettings the gift of God, the bleſſings of his mercy vpon our labours, and inioying it euer with a good conſcience we looſe it alſo, if ſo the Lord wil, with a quiet mind, ſaying with Iob in a Chriſtiā comfort,

                     the Lord gaue, and the Lorde hath taken away: bleſſed bee the name of the Lord. Fourthly in ſaying, Giue, wee are taught that albeit we labour neuer ſo much, being ſo commanded to do,
                        Gen. 3.17. Pſal. 128.2. 2. Theſſ. 3.10. Ecleſ. 7.7. Prou. 14.23. Act. 20.34.
                      yet except the Lorde beſtow the bleſſing, our labours cannot attaine to any thing, according to the Prophet, except the Lord keepe the citie the watchman waketh but in vayne, yea in

vayne do we riſe vp earely, and goe late to bed, eating the bread of ſorowe, except the Lord beſtow a mercie vpon our paynes and trauell. With the Lord we haue al things,
                        Pſal. 127.
                      and without him wee haue nothing. If the earth fructifie, it is not tilled without God. Pſal. 108.33. Mich. 6.15. Agge. 1.6.

faciunt, eos non ſuſtinent hoſtes. Ye knowe that neither multitude nor ſtrength getteth victorie in battell, but if any ſtoutly aſſayle their enemies, God ſetting to his helping hand, ſuch aſſault is not euer to be abidden. So haue heathens acknowledged what here Chriſtians are taught, that labour auaileth not to get any bread, except GOD giue it, and giue it dayly. It comfortably aſſureth vs againe of God his readynes to giue, for otherwiſe hee woulde neuer haue commanded vs to aſke, and ſay, giue. Laſt of all we meaning in this petition not only that God ſhould giue vs bare bread, but the healthfull nouriſhment alſo of it, and the ſtrength of it, and not onely goods and liuing according to our places and needes but the godly &amp; honeſt vſe alſo of the ſame, wee learne by this worde, giue, that aſwell this alſo commeth from God, as the other, a thing either not knowne or fowly forgotten of a number. And therefore they robbe GOD of his glory, and aſcribe to the creatures, that which is the power of the creator, and to the meanes, that which they can not haue, except the Lorde bleſſe them as meanes, I meane to nouriſh vs, and to ſuſtayne

vs healthfully and well. For marke you what the Lorde ſayth to his people Iſraell:
                        Leuit. 26.26.
                      
                     When I ſhall breake the ſtaffe of your bread, then ten women ſhall bake their bread in one ouen, and they ſhall deliuer your bread againe by weight, &amp; you ſhall eate, but not be ſatiſfied. The ſtaffe of bread is the ſtrength and power to nouriſh, which you heare the Lord himſelfe ſay is giuen and taken away by him. If hee take it away, the dainties and delicacie of Princes feede them not, but they pyne away in the midſt of them all, and if hee giue this ſtaffe to it, the pulſe &amp; water that Daniel fed vpon maketh a fayrer face, and giueth a better liking than any portion of the Kinges meate. See this in rich and poore mens children alſo playnely, the one fully and coſtly fed, yet proſpereth not, the other ſeldome fully and euer courſely fed, and yet both fat and fayre, and healthy: Such is the gift of God that now we ſpeake of, and herein pray for, yea ſo farre may it be from nouriſhing vs, that it may choke vs, if the Lord giue not gift vnto gift, and mercy to mercy, for ſo did the flye Adrian the 4. and an haire an other. The Lord was able to make

his Prophet Eliah to walke fortie dayes &amp; fortie nightes in the ſtrength of a courſe cake,
                        1. Kings. 19.8.
                      baked on the coales, &amp; of a pot of water: and the Lord was able to nouriſh Moſes as long in the mount without any meat at all,
                        Exod. 34.23. Math. 4.
                      to tell vs that man liueth not by bread onely, but by euery worde that commeth out of the mouth of God. I ſaid alſo, the vſe of riches came of the Lord, and ſee your ſelues if it be not ſo. Doth not the Preacher ſay that he had beheld an euill vnder the ſunne, and it was a great one, &amp; much amongſt men,
                        Cap. 6.1.
                      
                     euē a man to whom God hath giuen riches and treaſures, &amp; honour, and hee wanteth nothing for his ſoule of all that it deſireth, but God giueth him not power to eat therof, but a ſtraunge man ſhall eate it vp. Sée you and marke it, howe God is not onely the giuer of riches, but euen of the vſe alſo &amp; power to eat of them, which gift he beſtoweth and withholdeth at his pleaſure. The rich man layd vp for many yeeres, but the Lord would not haue him to liue and inioy then the things he had:
                        Luc. 12.
                      the vſe hee had not, longer then God gaue it. But euen when hee leaſt thought, his ſoule was called for,

and then like a foole he had heaped too much vp for other men. This is that which the wiſe Syrach ſayth:
                        chap. 11.18.19.
                      
                     Some man is rich by his care and nigardſhip, and this is the portion of his wages (meaning his reward is to haue them but not to vſe them) for when he ſhould beginne to eate of them, the time draweth neere that hee muſt leaue al theſe things vnto other men, and dye him ſelfe. Wherefore I ſay, praying in this petition not onely for the things, but euen alſo for the vſe &amp; comfort. Whē we ſay, giue, wee are taught that euen the vſe alſo is of the Lord. And thus do you ſee what great profite this one worde hath in this petition and what we may learne by it.
                  Why do wee ſay, giue vs, and not giue me?
                  Firſt, to teach vs to remember our brethren as well as our ſelues, to bee carefull for them, and to wiſh them all needfull things as to our ſelues:
                        1. Cor. 13.5.
                      according to the true nature of Chriſtian charitie, which ſeeketh not her owne things onely, but euen other mens alſo as well.
                        Conſider this ye couetouſe.
                      Which when it is conſidered, what (O Lord) may thoſe men ſay for the quiet of their conſciences,

that haue neuer enough themſelues, but euen as if God and all his bleſſing belonged only to them, and that they only ſhould dwell in the world alone, rake and ſcrape to themſelues with might and mayne, but of their brethren they neuer thinke. No, ſo farre are they from praying for them, that God would giue them their daylie bread, as that if they haue any part or portion of it, they are hartely deſirous to haue it from them, yea ſicke vpon their beddes often, as was wicked Achab, till they haue gotten Naboths vineyard &amp; inheritance: do theſe men pray, Da nobis, Giue vs
                      good Lorde our daylie bread? that is, giue my brethren as well as to my owne ſoule, what is néedfull to them, &amp; giue al thy children as to me their daylie wants. No no, if they might ſay it for ſhame, they would ſay, giue mée all, and let the reſt receiue of me if they will haue ought.
                        Couetouſe men had rather pray giue me then giue vs.
                      But what, they ſhame to ſay they ſhame not to wiſh: and therefore as often as they ſay this prayer they abuſe the Lord, and it is his mercie that preſently hée ſtriketh not ſo great hypocriſie, as to ſay vs with lippes, as if they meant many, and mee with heart, meaning but themſelues.

Learne therefore (beloued) by a common word to haue a common hart. It liketh the Lord that wee loue our brethren, and it liketh him not that we loue only our ſelues. We ſay not, giue me, but giue vs: and let vs doe thereafter, euen ioyne them in prayer with our ſelues, and wiſh them bread as to our ſelues, that is, all neceſſaries.
                        The ſecond vſe of the word vs.
                      Secondly, wee are by this maner of ſpeaking taught the true vſe of ſuch portion as God giueth vs, namely, ſo to haue it as that others haue part with vs. For wee are but Stewards of the Lords gifts. And, non tibi ſoli datur quod habes, ſed per te dat Deus alijs. It is not giuen what thou haſt to thy ſelfe alone, but by thee GOD giueth the ſame to others. His minde being that thou ſhouldeſt ſo impart them. Thy meate is giuen to comfort others as thou mayſt, and a ioy it will be if thou canſt ſay with Iob:
                     
                        Chap. 31.17.
                      
                     I haue not eaten my morſels alone, but the fatherleſſe hath eaten with me. Thy wooll is giuen thée to clothe the naked,
                        verſ. 19.
                      and a comfort great it is when a man may ſay with Iob againe: I haue ſeene none periſh for want of clothing, neither any poore without a couering, but their

loynes haue bleſſed me, becauſe they were clothed with ye 
                     fliece of my ſheepe. Iob had lodging,
                        32.
                      and he thought it giuen to releeue the ſtraunger:
                        21.
                      he had authoritie, and he thought it giuen to helpe the poore in iudgement, not to oppreſſe them. And ſo euer haue others of Gods children poſſeſſed for others, &amp; not onely for themſelues, what the Lorde beſtowed vppon them. Wherefore if no other mouth ſhould euer iudge thē, their owne mouthes ſufficiently charge all miſerable wretches and wretched miſers of this earth, as often as they pray this prayer, becauſe they ſay, giue vs, in the plurall number, and yet where they haue receiued they vſe it ſcarce in the ſingular number,
                        Note.
                      being ſo farre from releeuing others with any comfort they haue, as that they little may finde in their harts often to reléeue themſelues. Let vs be warned before wee ſmart for wretchedneſſe. Wee pray not for our ſelues alone, but for others: we receiue not for our ſelues alone, but for others: and therefore let vs impart the Lords giuen graces both to our ſelues and to others. So ſhal we ſhew our ſelues children of our heauenly father, who is

bountifull to all, and hard to none, dealing his gifts in ſuch fauour and fulneſſe euer, that all tongues may ſpeake of his praiſe, and all harts conceiue of his mercie. That God and Father make vs like him in this and all our dueties. Amen.
               
               
                  The Prayer.
                  
                     MIghtie GOD &amp; moſt louing Lorde, after thinges concerning thy glorie, it is thy gracious fauour to vs frayle wretches, that we ſhould boldly aſke what concerneth our neceſsities and wants, promiſing euen therein alſo to be merciful vnto vs, and to heare our prayers. Wherefore both in obedience to thy commaundement, and faith in thy promiſes, wee throw downe our ſelues here before thee, &amp; beſeech thee to giue vs this day our daily bread: that is, good Lord, as thou haſt taught vs, all things needfull to the maintenance of this life. Giue vs meate, drinke and clothing

for our bodies. Giue vs of the dew of heauen and fatneſſe of the earth as thy bleſſed pleaſure ſhall vouchſafe vs to our good. If it pleaſe thee to giue more, O Lorde make vs thankfull, and faithful ſtewards to diſpoſe thy mercies to our brethren that ſhall haue neede. If it pleaſe thee to giue leſſe, &amp; chaunging thy hand to bring vs with thy ſeruaunt Moſes out of the Court to keepe a flock of ſheepe, and with Dauid from high fauours, to many feares, O God and father mercifull, euen with that portion of bread make vs wel content, &amp; thankfull alſo euer to thee for it. Remēbring well with our ſelues how thou caredſt for theſe thy ſeruants and others many in their eſtate, &amp; haſt euen by this word bread, taught vs to bee content with a little. Thy mercies, O Lord, we beſeech thee giue vs according to our charges, thou knoweſt our number, and our needes, and thou feedeſt the very Rauens that call vpon thee. The eyes of all things wayt vpon thee, O God, &amp; thou giueſt them meate in due ſeaſon. Thou openeſt thy hande and filleſt all things

liuing with plenteouſneſſe. To theſe fauours, O Lord, graunt peace and quietneſſe, priuate at home, and publique abroade. Let there bee no going out, no leading into captiuitie, nor any complayning in our ſtreates. Peace be within the walles of Hieruſalem, O Lord, to thy good pleaſure, and plenteouſneſſe in her Palaces, that is, to thy Church mercie and fauour, we beſeech thee. To this end giue vs, O heauenly father, the bleſsing of prudent and godly gouernours. Confirme their harts in zeale and loue to thee, and make them euer carefull of thy glorie. Confirme our obedience and truth agayne to them in thee, and both one and other make vs thankfull greatly for thy preſent mercy in this behalfe vpon vs. If euer people found fauour at thy maieſties hands, O Lord our portion hath bene great, muſt wee ſay, and this daylie bread with a liberall hande aboue other nations now many yeeres giuen vnto vs. O deare father touch vs with the feeling of it, and make vs thankfull, and continue this mercie and louing kindneſſe ſtill vppon

vs, giuing vs ſtill theſe cōforts of thine. What wee haue neede of, denie vs not, and what wee haue, with thy fauour, O Lord, and to our good let vs euer haue it, not to our harme and iudgement. So we that be thy people and ſheepe of thy paſture, ſhall giue thee thankes for euer. Heare vs O Lord, O God &amp; father gracious, not for our ſakes, but for Ieſus Chriſt his ſake, our onely Lord and Sauiour, Amen.
               
            
            
               
                  The fifth petition. And forgiue vs our treſpaſſes, &amp;c.
               
               
                  Now are you come to a petition (as our eſtate ſtandeth) moſt ſweete &amp; comfortable, moſt neceſſary and profitable, wherefore I pray you, euen as fully as you ſhall thinke conuenient, ſpeake of it, and firſt of the order as you haue done in the former.
               
               Touching the order of it, Tertullian ſaith very well: Quid alimenta proderunt, ſi illis reputamur re vera quaſi taurus ad victimam, what will any nouriſhments in this

life profit vs, if with them we be accompted as Oxen to the ſlaughter, Cyprian more playnely: Poſt ſubſidium cibi,
                  
                     The order of this petition.
                   
                  petitur &amp; venia delicti, vt qui a deo paſcitur, in deo viuat, nec tantum praeſenti et temporali vitae, ſed &amp; aeternae conſulatur: ad quam veniri poteſt, ſi peccata dimittātur: after the ayd of meat is begged pardon of offence; that he which of God is fed, in God may liue, and care had aſwell of eternall life as of temporall, vnto which eternall life then is the way open, when all ſins be forgiuen. Wherefore ſince in the former we haue craued of the Lorde what concerneth this life, in theſe two latter we begge what concerneth that hereafter. In the former deſiring him to forgiue what is paſt, &amp; in the latter to ſtrengthen againſt what is to come. Both which our requeſts haue grounde vpon his owne promiſe, and are directed thereby. For the Lorde in the couenaunt which it pleaſed him to make with his Church hath promiſed both,
                     Iere. 31.34. &amp; 33.
                   ſaying, their iniquitie will I forgiue, and remember their ſinnes no more: which is the thing we now begge. And I will put my lawe in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and will be their God,

and they ſhalbe my people, &amp;c. that is I will aſſiſt them with a newe power of Spirit, &amp; confirme them with a further ſtrength to ſtand hereafter, which is the matter of our next queſtion.
               It might ſeeme to ſome, by the order of the former petition, and this, that the remiſſion of our ſinnes were a matter leſſe to be cared for than our dayly breade, becauſe it is ſet after in this prayer.
               If it had not bene ſayd before in the beginning of the former petition that this order is obſerued of the Lord in regard of our rudenes, that he might lead vs from a matter better known, to a matter leſſe known: yet truely ſhould they bee very rawe in religion that would thinke thinges onely reſpecting this life to bee preferred before things touching life eternall. God forbid therefore but this order of theſe petitions notwithſtanding, euery Chriſtian man and woman ſhould make it their chiefe care to finde mercy with the Lorde for their tranſgreſſions, rather then to inioye ten thouſande worlds with all the glory that might be in them, for what would al theſe worlds

profite them when they had loſt their owne ſoules,
                     Math. 16 26.
                   in them all not able to finde what to giue for the recompence of the ſame again? But without remiſſion of ſinne there can be no ſaluation, God not ſo much as hearing ſinners, much leſſe ſauing them. And therfore iuſtly our chiefe care to haue ſinne pardoned that we may be ſaued.
               If you would conclude any thing of the order of this petition following,
                     Religion is not cauſe of want, but ſinne.
                   the other conclude this, and that you may doe both truely and profitably, namely that true religion is not the cauſe of want of daily bread, but our ſinnes. And therefore preſently after requeſt to the Lord for that,
                     Deutro. 32.14.
                   we adioyne the other as the true ſtoppe and let of the former, if it be not taken away by his mercy: as if wee ſhoulde ſay, we requeſt Lord the comforts of this life, the fruites of the ground, and the fruites of our Cattell, butter of Kyne, and milke of ſheepe, with fat of Lambes and Rammes fed in Baſhan, the bleſſing of wheate, and the red licour of the grape, but neither theſe nor any ſuch may we looke for, except in mercy thou take away our ſinne, the very ſtay of all thy goodnes from vs, if thou deale in iuſtice. And

therefore Lord forgiue vs our trepaſſes. Let no man then accuſe religion for dearth and ſcarſetie, for famine and hunger, but conſider his owne deſertes, and the deſertes of thouſandes more, and remember euer both howe theſe petitions lye, and what alſo for more playnnes the Lorde himſelfe hath ſpoken by his Prophet Ieremy ſaying: Your iniquities haue turned away theſe earthly bleſſings from you,
                  
                     Iere. 5.
                   
                  as rayne both earely and late in due ſeaſon, with a pleaſant harueſt &amp; ſuch like: yea your ſinnes haue hindred good things from you. Againe by Eſay: Behold the Lordes hād is not ſhortned,
                  
                     Eſay. 49.1. &amp;c.
                   
                  that it cannot ſaue, neither is his eare heauy that it cannot heare: but your iniquities haue ſeparated betwixt you and your God, and your ſinnes haue hid his face from you, that he will not heare. For your handes are defiled with bloud, and your fingers with iniquitie, &amp;c.
               Nowe then to the wordes themſelues if you thinke good and of them in order: for that is playne.
               
                  The firſt word is Forgiue, of it ſelfe ſo playne that it needeth not any explication,
                     The hole petition teacheth two things, quid petamus &amp; quid facero debeamus, Petitio: remit
                              ••
                            nobis, &amp;c.
                     
                   and therefore not ſtanding in that ſort vpon it, let vs conſider the concluſions that ariſe thereof to a Chriſtian mind that carefully weigheth what GOD hath ſpoken. Firſt then it containeth a playne confeſſion of our miſerable eſtate vnto the Lorde, and ſo teacheth vs that before pardon and forgiuenes, ought to goe a true, faithfull, and vnfayned acknowledging of our euill whatſoeuer. For why ſhoulde God vouchſafe to pardon, what we, not able in truth to hyde from him, as being God, yet in the ſtrong corruption of our vntamed hearts indeuor to cloke, and doe not lay open in woe and godly ſorrow before him.
                     Confeſſion to God.
                   Very mortal mā looketh for confeſſion of a faulte, and wee vſe to ſay that halfe the amendes is made when it is ſo done, yet may we couer from man very great offences, howe much more may the Lord our God iuſtly require that being notable to blind him, we ſeeke not to do it, but in al reuerence of his maieſty and all vehement diſlike of our ſelues and our ſinnes, we lay them at his foote and begge his mercy. It is a notable place in the

Pſame of Dauid teacheth vs this. When he ſayth: Whilſt I helde my tongue my bones conſumed,

                  for thy hand is heauy vpon me day and night, and my moyſture is turned into the drought of Summer, then I acknowledged my ſinne, neither hid I mine iniquitie, For I thought I wil confeſſe againſt my ſelfe my wickednes vnto the Lord, and thou forgaueſt the puniſhment of my ſinne. See howe before he confeſſed he found no comfort,
                     Num. 5.7.
                   and after confeſſion howe hee found no puniſhment. Looke in the Law of the Lord, and marke theſe wordes to Moſes: When a man or woman ſhall commit any ſinne that mē commit, and tranſgreſſe againſt the Lord, when that perſon ſhall treſpaſſe, then they ſhall confeſſe their ſin which they haue done, and ſhall reſtore the damage, &amp;c. Confeſſion God required and confeſſion they performed.

                   not a iuſt proud Phariſie, but a poore ſinnefull and wretched Publicane. Wee are here iuſtly, ſayd the thiefe on the croſſe, &amp; wee receiue things worthie of yt 
                  wee haue done, but this mā hath done nothing amiſſe: a very plaine confeſſion of a féeling hart. Whē 
                  Paul had preached againſt coniuring and ſorcery,
                     Act. 19.18.
                   as we read in that place: what was the fruite of his ſpeaking, &amp; their hearing, but this?
                     Math. 3.6
                   
                  Many that beleeued came, and confeſſed, &amp; ſhewed their workes. Iohn alſo baptized in the wildernes, but whom? ſuch as confeſſed their ſinnes againſt the Lorde. Euer therefore before pardon muſt goe confeſſion, for ſo euer hath it done as by all theſe proofes is now plaine. Priuat to God, if the ſinne be priuat, Publique to the Church if the ſinne bee ſuch as ſhall more appeare hereafter in an other place.

Wherefore let vs end this note vpon this firſt word, Forgiue, and knowe it euer that wee are taught, if wee ſeeke mercy, not to hide ſinne. For the Lords pardon requireth the ſinners confeſſion. Couers and clokes, they do but couer the light of Gods countenance, that it ſhyne not vpon vs, and yet do what we can, wee can couer nothing in deede from his eyes. Wee ſhewe our will and wee want our wiſh: ſinne vnto ſinne, we grieuouſly adde, and we deale with our ſoules as ſome ſory ones with their bodies,
                     Note.
                   concealing their ſore till the time bee paſt, &amp; the body periſhed. Wherfore euen as often as we ſhal euer hereafter ſay this prayer, let vs adde this confeſſion to it: O Lord our grieuous treſpaſſes, our many &amp; great tranſgreſſions, this blot of our bodies, or ſpot of our ſoules whatſoeuer it is in that mercy that hath no meaſure: forgiue it, daſh it, and waſh it out, that it neuer appeare againe before thee.
               What Secondly?
               Secondly it teacheth vs the long ſuffering of the Lord, wonderfull and vnſpeakable towards mankind. Whereby hee beareth, and beareth with vs wretched creatures,

and although we daily and hourely, euer and continually ſinne againſt him, yet caſteth hee not away ſo vnprofitable ſeruants, but deferreth his anger, ſpareth his iudgements, and if we turne to him, he turneth moſt mercifully to vs, and forgiueth heapes of vggly ſinne againſt him. If we wormes and duſt ſhould be vſed of any, as he is vſed of many, we would ſhew our corruption quickly, and recken vp the faultes committed and pardoned by vs, thinking we had ſhewed great fauour, &amp; done much for our brethren, if wee had twiſe or thriſe bene intreated by them to forgiue them, we would deny at the laſt and ſay playnely to them, we might not euer forgiue, if they ſo euer would offende.
                     The Lords great mercy and our great corruption.
                   Yet what are we? as bad as they. If not to them, yet to others, and therefore no ſuch cauſe we ſhould be ſo ſtrickt in meaſure. When often our ſelues muſt neede the ſame curteſie, and requeſt a fauourable hand to ſtrike but ſoftly. But ſée the Lorde. His puritie blotteth both Sunne and Moone, the heauen &amp; the earth and all the creatures in them both, he offendeth neuer, neither needeth that any ſhould forgiue him, and yet is he more fauourable

to his very enemies, than we are to our liked and loued friends. For he ſpareth the woorſt more than we the beſt, and though they ſinne often, yet forgiueth he ſtil. They aſke and he graunteth, they knocke and he openeth, they cry &amp; hee ſpareth, yea though they haue cryed it ten thouſand times forgiue vs our treſpaſſes, and hee euer hath forgiuen very great and grieuous ones, yet is he not weary when we cry agayne, and caſteth vs of,
                     2. Petr. 3.9
                   but he is patient toward vs, ſayth Saint Peter, and woulde haue no man periſh, but al to come to repentance, and to be ſaued. O deereſt GOD what fauour is this, what goodnes is this to ſo great offenders? Yea marke it here howe we are commaunded whileſt we liue and breath to pray this prayer, forgiue vs Lord, and therefore playnely taught that euen ſo long there is mercy with GOD without wearynes, a gracious open eare to a ſinfull ſuter, and pardon for that ſinne that frailtie hath fallen into, and nowe ſeeketh in a better grace to haue done away. This is great patience that indureth till death being ſo often prouoked to deny ſuch fauour &amp; with rauiſhed harts for the ſwéetnes

of it may wee heare and learne it, yet let vs not abuſe it, as ſome haue done, but remember wel what the Apoſtle ſayd when it was obiected:
                     Rom. 6.1
                   
                  ſhal wee ſinne that grace may abound: God forbid. Howe ſhall wee which are deade to ſinne, liue yet therein, and ſo forth, as followeth there at large.
                     Rom. 2.5
                   
                  The riches of his bountifulnes &amp; patience, and long ſufferaunce leadeth to repentance, ſayth the ſame Apoſtle. If to repentance, then not to preſumption, if to amendment, then not to continuance in the euill, and therefore take heede. Punit Deus ſerò quidem, ſed duriter. Long doeth the Lord ſtay ere he ſmite, but hee ſmiteth home when hee doth ſmite. Conclude wee then with wiſe Syrach: Say not, I haue ſinned,
                  
                     Eccleſ. 5.4. &amp;c.
                   
                  and what euill hath come vnto mee. For the almightie is a patient rewarder, but hee will not leaue thee vnpuniſhed. Becauſe thy ſinne is forgiuen be not without feare, to heape ſinne vpon ſinne. And ſay not, the mercy of God is great, hee will forgiue me my manifold ſinnes: for mercy and wrath come from him, and his indignation commeth downe vpon ſinners. Make no

tarying to turne vnto the Lord and put not off from day to day. For ſuddenly ſhal the wrath of the Lord break forth, and in thy ſecuritie thou ſhalt bee deſtroyed, and thou ſhalt periſh in time of vengeance. That houre that the wicked hope for is often denyed, and ſuddenly they periſh without repentance. Therefore preſume not.
               Thirdly what?
               Thirdly, wee learne by this firſt worde that the remiſſion of our ſinnes is of meere mercie and fauour, not for any merite of ours. For marke I pray you how wee are taught to ſay, not as the debtor ſayd in the Goſpel, Lord refrayne thine anger toward vs, and wee will pay thee all: but abſolutely and plainly, Lord forgiue, that is quite raſed out, and pardon without any recompence or ſatiſfaction from vs or by vs.
                     Grace proued and ſatiſfactiō improued.
                   So that euen this petition, if there were no more Scripture, aſſureth the truth of that doctrine to vs, that by grace wee liue and are ſaued. Mercie pardoneth, mercie healeth, and mercy doth whatſoeuer God doth for vs. Merite dare not péepe to ſpeake vnto the Lord. Iuſt as the Apoſtle ſayth: We

are iuſtified freely by his grace, not of works, nay, if of grace, therefore not of works,
                  
                     Rom. 3.14.
                   
                  els were grace no grace. Againe, wee haue the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes according to his rich grace.
                  
                     9.11.
                   
                  
                     11.6.
                   And againe: By grace are ye ſaued through faith, &amp; that not of your ſelues,
                  
                     Epheſ. 17.2.8
                   
                  it is the gift of God: with a number ſuch like places. Iuſt alſo as the Father ſayd, Meritum meum miſeratio Domini: My merite is the onely and free mercie of God: and ſo long aboūd I with merits as he aboundeth with mercies: but take the one from him, and take the other from me. For my merite, I ſay, is his meere mercie. Wherfore moſt greeuouſly doth that doctrine of Poperie robbe the Lord of his true and due honour, when it teacheth ſatiſfaction by man to God for his ſinne. For who can ſatiſfie GOD, but his onely Sonne, in whom only he is pleaſed. And of whom flatly it is ſayd, that he is the propitiation, that is, the full, whole, perfite, and all the ſatiſfaction that GOD requireth or can like of in this ſenſe. Mary knewe no other, the Publican knewe no other, Peter knewe no other, nor the olde father when he ſayd of Peter, Lachrimas lego,

ſatiſfactionem non lego. Peters teares I read of,
                     Chryſost,
                   but of any ſatiſfaction that hee made himſelf to purge his ſinne &amp; to pleaſe God with I reade of none: but of this alſo more in his proper place, if God will. Let vs ſee the truth, ſtand in the truth, thanke the God of heauen for it, and deteſt theſe Popiſh blaſphemies againſt the Lord and his deare Sonne. In that precious bloud is the father pleaſed and ſatiſfied for al our ſinnes, if wee lay holde of it: and for our workes they carie greater corruption in their bones and bowels, than that ſo pure a God ſhould bee pleaſed with them, or ſo vggly ſinnes euer purged by them.
               Why is it ſaid, forgiue vs, and not forgiue me.
               To teach vs that which wee are dull to learne, namely, not to beſtowe our whole loue and care vpon our ſelues, but to deuide it alſo to our brethren, and euen as hartely and earneſtly to beſeech the Lorde to blot out all their offences as our owne, and to be mercifull to thē as to our ſelues. But alas beloued, where is this affection amongſt vs? where is this care of the ſpirituall good of our neighbours? Truely it

is moſt rare, yea much more rare than can ſtand with right and true profeſſion of Ieſus Chriſt.
                     A great corruption in vs.
                   If wee doe thinke of our brethren at any time, &amp; wiſh them well, ſurely that reacheth but to earthly bleſſings, to riches, to honors, to fauour and friends in this ſinfull worlde, and ſo wee might ſee them magnified and exalted in this reſpect, our deſire were anſwered and wee fully contented. The pardon of their ſinnes, and fauour with God by his beloued Sonne, their future ioye in a place of ioye endleſſe and eternall, alas we thinke not of, we care not for, God knoweth we ſeldome (if euer) pray for. Yet is this all in all: for how ſodenly fadeth all worldly pompe, if it be obtayned, and how often fayle we, and neuer do obtayne it. Wherefore euen in this and euery petition of this daylie prayer, the Lord hath quickned our earthly mindes to loue in a better ſorte our neighbours and brethren: and I pray you let vs learne it. Remember how vehemently Moſes felt the miſerie of the Iewes, if God forgaue them not their committed euill, and how earneſtly hee prayed for that forgiueneſſe.
                     Exod. 32.31.
                   
                  Oh (ſayth he) this people haue ſinned a

great ſinne, and haue made them Gods of gold. Therefore now if thou pardon their ſinne, thy mercie ſhal appeare, but if thou wilt not, I pray thee raſe me out of the booke which thou haſt written. Remember the words of the Apoſtle Paul to the like effect: I ſay the truth in Chriſt,
                  
                     Rom. 9.1.
                   
                  I lye not, my conſcience bearing mee witneſſe in the holy Ghoſt, that I haue great heauineſſe and continuall ſorowe in my hart. For I would wiſh my ſelfe to be ſeparate from Chriſt, for my brethrē that are my kinſmen according to the fleſh. See beloued and marke wherein the beſt loue of man to man conſiſteth and is ſhewed, namely, by wiſhing his ſpirituall good, the good of his ſoule, the forgiueneſſe of his ſinnes:
                     Pſal. 4.
                   and as the Prophet Dauid ſayth, the lifting vp of ye light of the Lords countenance vpon him. O patternes of loue in this behalfe to their brethren, Moſes and Paule, inimitable of vs, vnleſſe the Lord aſſiſt. For where is this heauineſſe of hart and continuall ſorrowe to ſee our brethren ſinne, and by ſinne to indaunger themſelues here and for euer?
                     Pſal. 119.
                   Where are thoſe flouds of teares which Dauid ſayd

guſhed out of his eyes, becauſe men kept not Gods commaundements. Alas how ſtrange a tale is this to vs! Well, it ſhould not be ſtraunge. Neither Moſes nor Paule
would haue wiſhed themſelues accurſed of God, to haue gayned to their brethren ten thouſande worldes, or any worldly good whatſoeuer, but to gayne them ſpirituall good they did it: and therefore much more are wee to care for the ſaluation of our brethren than for their glorie in this earth, if we will imitate them. Dauid would neuer haue guſhed out teares to ſee them want wealth, but to ſee them want grace he did. Wherefore let vs learne how to loue our brethren wel: let vs learne what moſt pleaſeth and diſpleaſeth God: what moſt profiteth and hurteth our neighbours, and more hartely pray for the remiſſiō of their ſinnes than for any worldly good. It is good loue to wiſh God &amp; his comforts to our frends, and to bee greatly touched with their miſdoings toward God. It was for ſinne and the effects of ſinne that Ieremy ſaw in the people,
                     Iere. 9.1
                   and readie to fall vpon them, that made him wiſh his head full of water and his eyes a fountaine of teares, and that he

had a cottage in the wilderneſſe to ſit and ſorrowe in. Therefore much doe wee ſeeke for our brethren, when we ſeeke the pardon of their ſinnes at Gods hande for them. Now beloued,
                     If we be bound to beſeche God to forgiue our brethren their ſinnes, are not we our ſelues bound to forgiue them?
                   if wee bee bound to beſeech God to forgiue them their ſinnes agaynſt him, iudge your ſelues if we bee not bound to forgiue them our ſelues their ſinnes agaynſt vs. And agayne, what their caſe is that will euery day ſay this prayer with their tongues, and deſire God to forgiue both them and their brethren their ſinnes, and by and by both goe themſelues &amp; with many flattring baytes, earneſt alluremēts, &amp; euen almoſt violent conſtraynts pull the ſame their brethren to ſinne agayne without remorſe and feeling. Can wee both bee mediators for pardon, and tempters to miſchiefe, with God his good liking. Fearefully therefore doe thouſands offende and thinke not of it. If we will pray for remiſſion for our ſelues &amp; others, we muſt keepe our ſelues and others, as the Lorde will ſtrengthen, from ſuch euill agayne when we are pardoned.
                     Alurers of others to ſinne.
                   Away then with this good fellowſhip that tempteth vnto ſinne: and if any allure you my brethren, if other denyals

will not ſerue, aſke them whether they haue ſayd any prayers that day or not if they haue not, iudge if that be good companie to go withall or no: if they haue, aſke them if they haue not therin beſought God to pardon both their owne ſinnes and other mens: if they haue, how may they then with one breath ſend foorth good and euill, pray for good, prouoke to euill: aſke pardon, and doe the thing agayne. So ſhall Satan flye from you.
               
                  The next word is Our, &amp; what doth that note vnto vs.
               
               
                  
                     A lamentable exchange made.
                  It ſheweth vs what is the qualitie of our riches and wealth, for wee haue playde the merchantes, and tranſſigned with an outlandiſh rouer called the deuil, and with him we haue dealt by exchaunge. Our barke was fraighted with knowledge, with loue, with humilitie, with ioy, with peace, with long ſuffering, with gentleneſſe, with goodnes, with faith, with méekneſſe, with temperance, and to go no further, with all grace and innocencie. So that wee might ſaie of theſe iewells, that they were ours: but now we haue vnladed the bark by ſubtill perſwaſion, and freight it a newe with

this rouers wares, with ignoraunce, with hatred, with pride, with ſorrowes, with adulterie, with fornication, with vncleanneſſe, with wantonnes, Idolatry, witchcraft, debate, emulations, wrath, contentions, ſeditions, hereſies, enuie, murther, dronkenneſſe, gluttonie, and ſuch like, yea, with all want of grace and impuritie. So that nowe wee muſt ſaie the former were ours, and theſe are ours.
                     What is ours now.
                   This is our lading nowe, and this haue wee profited by this rouer now. Now we muſt ſaie, Forgiue vs our treſpaſſes, then might we ſaie continue thy graces: thē was grace our lading, now are we freight til we ſink again with ſinnes and treſpaſſes. Alaſſe that this word Ours ſhould be applied to theſe. But thus are we fallen, and of vs it is nowe ſayde, that all the imaginations of the thoughts of our hearts are onely euill continually,
                     Gen 6.5 Pſal. 51.5.
                   that we are borne in iniquitie and conceiued in ſinne, and that wee are not able ſo much as to think a good thought of our ſelues. Wherefore as I ſaie, this word in our petition, telleth vs the quality of our wealth, and that our gardens haue growing too much rue in them, and too litle

hearbe of grace.
                     Our gardens now haue too much rue, and to little hearbe of grace. Ambro. de ſacram. lib. 5. cap. 4.
                   Treſpaſſes bee ours nowe, but no treſpaſſes were ours once. This thought Sainct Ambroſe of when he ſayd, Diues eras, ad imaginem et ſimilitudinem Dei factus, perdidiſti quod habebas, perdi diſti pecuniam, accepiſti a diabolo debitum quod non erat neceſſarium &amp;c. What is our debt but ſinne? Thou waſt rich, and made to the image and ſimilitude of God, but thou haſt loſt what thou hadſt, thou haſt loſt thy money, and taken of the deuill a debt that was not neceſſarie. The beſt waie for vs, is to vnlade agayne this bad merchaundiſe that we haue got of this rouing merchant, by humble prayer to the Lord to forgiue vs our treſpaſſes, and to drowne them in the botome of the Sea, that they neuer more may be ſeene, aiding vs, ſtrengthening vs, and confirming vs againſt our greate and grieuous weakeneſſe: which the Lorde for his mercie ſake doe.
               
                  If you will proceed in order, the word Treſpaſſes is next.

that he will not giue ouer whileſt hee hath to ſpend. For this feeling heart of another mans harme, this loue and lenity, this tender compaſſion and care for them that haue not grace to care for themſelues, is precious before the Lord. And he often rewardeth loſſe in this reſpect ſuſtayned, with better meaſure than lawe woulde haue giuen either coſts or damages. Finallie, forgette not alſo euen many times to reaſon with your ſelfe thus, I ſee the fatherleſſe &amp; widowe many times oppreſſed for want of helpe, and weakneſſe go to the wall for want of countenance, yea, I ſee ſinne born out, and vertue borne downe many times, to the greate diſhonour of GOD, and offence of his Church, and I am not touched thereat, or at leaſt I ſpend not a penie, neither a dayes trauayle to helpe therein, but now that my ſelf am touched, and my tranſitorie ſubſtaunce endangered, I am ready to goe to lawe, and to ſpende much, ſurelie this may I do, but that other ſhould I not leaue vndone. Yet howe am I more forward for riches than for vertue, for euerie cauſe of mine owne, than for anie of my neighbours. Thus I ſaie, to reaſon with

your ſelfe is moſt profitable, and wil greatly direct a good minde in this matter wee ſpeake of, namely, how hee may vſe lawe. Nowe then I truſt you ſee a bridle put in our mouthes from haſting to lawe, as wee do for euerie occaſion, troubling our ſelues and whole Countries with the vnquietneſſe of our natures, and vngodlyneſſe of our hearts. Theſe conditions and ſuch other obſerued, let vs knowe our libertie to vſe the Lordes good ordinaunce for the maintenance of peace, &amp; right, and for the due puniſhment of oppugners of eyther of them, or of them both. But let vs not abuſe to our owne reuenge, what to thoſe endes in Gods mercie to man is ſo graciouſly ordayned.
               
                  God make this coole the vnregenerate humours of a number, and I thank you for it. Now to proceed, I pray you how may we bee ſayd to forgiue to our brethren their treſpaſſes, ſeeing none forgiueth ſinne but God onely.
               
               You muſt conſider that in ſinne there be two things. Firſt, the euill of the action, &amp; ſecondly the detrimēt that ariſeth to man. The euill of the action, is that impuritie

and fouleneſſe wherewith the law of God, agaynſt which it is contrarie, chargeth it. And this concerneth the Lord,
                     Man doth not forgiue the euill or vice of the action but the detriment ariſing by it to man.
                   becauſe béeing by him prohibited, the committing of it, is alſo agaynſt him. This properlie is ſinne, and the remiſſion of it onely is in the Lord himſelfe. No man is able to doe it. But the ſeconde which is the detriment or hurt that ariſeth by that treſpaſſe to a mā, either in fame or bodie, or goods, as it is agaynſt man, ſo man may remit and pardon it without anie impeachment of the Lords glorie. Thus therefore doe wee forgiue treſpaſſes, when wee forgiue the harme that hath ariſen to vs by them, together with all conceiued anger, ſwelling, indignation, &amp; wrath for the ſame. The Lordes forgiueneſſe is a raſing out of the ſinne it ſelfe, I meane a full remiſſion of the tranſgreſſion of his law by that treſpaſſe whatſoeuer. Let that man of ſinne therefore looke about him, and all his adherents wel conſider it, how their pardons may runne with remiſſion both a poena et culpa, from puniſhment and guilt.
                     The Popes pardons. A poena eſt culpa blaſphemous.
                   They are in theſe daies of light, when the Lords mercy hath made the Sunne of vnderſtanding ſhine

vpon his Church, and the daie ſtarre ariſe in his childrens harts, compelled to excuſe theyr Pope, by affirming, that hee remitteth but onely the puniſhment, which by law is due to ſuch offence, and medleth not with the ſinne, as it concerneth God. But let them looke if they ſaie true, when his pardons be extāt in this forme that I haue named, releaſing for money both poenam, the puniſhment, and culpam, the fault. Iwis they wil ſée it, if ye Lord be ſo gracious to thē, a pride prophecied as a note of Antichriſt. And neuer did the Iewes more wrongfully miſlike our Sauiour beeing God as well as man, than we may rightly abhorre this monſter, being onely man, &amp; a moſt miſerable man in many reſpects, for yt he preſumeth to forgiue ſins,
                     Eſay. 43.23.
                   which none cā forgiue but god alone. For, it is I, it is I, ſayth the Lord, that put away iniquitie, and forgiue ſinnes. And, the Lord hath done awaie thy ſinne, ſayth Nathan to Dauid, not I, nor any man. And this might wee learne euen by this forme of prayer, if there were no other Scripture. For vnto whome doth the Lorde teach vs to ſaie, Forgiue vs our treſpaſſes, but onely

to God? Surely if any man or woman, Sainct or Angell coulde forgiue vs, then were it &amp; ſhould be lawful for vs to pray to thē to forgiue vs, &amp; ſo to chāge this prayer frō 
                  Pater to Mater, or Frater, frō 
                  our Father, to our mother, our brother, to holy Peter, holy Paul, or ſuch like. But how ſpend I words in a playne matter? it is inough.
               
                  Are all men and women to pray this prayer, or but onely ſome?
               
               Surely you remember me of that which is worthie noting, as well as anie thing that hath bene ſayd, namely, how our Sauiour Chriſt hath ſayd vnto all the world, that there is iuſt cauſe to acknowledge thē ſelues ſinners, and to pray for the pardon of their ſinnes. For whoſoeuer haue néede to beg anie thing at God his handes, thus he teacheth them to pray, but the whole world ſtandeth in neede to begge at Gods hande, all therefore the whole worlde muſt praie thus, Both Iewes and Gentiles,

Deſtruction and calamitie are in their wayes, and the way of peace haue they not known, the feare of God is not before theyr eyes.
                  
                     verſ. 23. Galat. 3.22.
                   Agayne in the ſame Chapter, All haue ſinned, and are depriued of the glorie of God. And to the Galathians, The Scripture hath cō
                     cluded all vnder ſinne. And if anie man ſaie he hath no ſinne, he deceiueth him ſelfe, &amp; there is no truth in him. With a number ſuch lyke places. Enter not into iudgement with thy ſeruant O Lord, ſayth the prophet Dauid, for no fleſh ſhal be iuſtified in thy ſight. Wherefore it is not for modeſtie that wee muſt praie to the Lord to forgiue vs our ſinne,
                     The error of the Pelagians.
                   as moſt wickedly the Pelagians affirmed, but for conſcience and truth, and as Hierome ſayth, Ex humanae fragilitatis, et noſtrae miſeriae conſcientia: Vppon true feeling and feare

of mans frailtie, and miſery, and the iudgements of God due to it. For a prayer conceiued for modeſtie onely, ſhoulde bee a lie and a fained humilitie. And as Auſten pretilie ſpeaketh, Humilitas ſtatuta in parte falſitatis, perderet praemium veritatis. Falſe humilitie ſhould looſe ye bleſſing that truth ſhould haue. Non ergo debemus ſic laudare creatorem, vt cogamur dicere, imo verò conuincamur dicere ſuperfluum ſaluatorèm. We muſt not ſo prayſe our creator, as we be compelled, yea, conuinced to ſaie, that ſuperfluous is a Sauiour. And agayne, Quia nos creauit, ita ſimus grati, vt non ſimus quia ſanat, ingrati.
                  
                     Cathary &amp;c. Anabap.
                   Let vs ſo be thankfull to the Lord for creating vs, as wee bée not vnthankfull to him for healing vs. With many ſuch like ſentēces, noting our too true corruption,
                     Some in the ſcripture are called iuſt and vp right: but this is to be vnderſtode before God: or as Aug ſayeth▪ 
                        Affectu, non effectu by deſire not by deede.
                   and their moſt highe pride that think they haue attained to ſuch holyneſſe as yt they neede not ſaie, Remitte nobis debita noſtra, Forgiue vs O Lorde our treſpaſſes.
                   Is there anie man now a dayes better than the Diſciples? Yet the Lord teacheth thē we ſée to pray this prayer. And ſurely as our garments though dayly bruſhed, yet dayly and ſtill need bruſhing

agayne, becauſe euer when they are bruſhed, newe duſt and fouleneſſe lighteth vppon them: euen ſo our ſoules and bodies, though many times altered by a gracious pardon from God in Chriſt, yet daily and ſtill ſo gathering duſt agayne, as that dayly and ſtill they neede to bee cleered. And therefore euer muſt all men praie this praier.
               Furthermore euen here alſo haue the Nouatian heretiques a playne fall with their moſt vncomfortable aſſertion or hereſie,
                     Sinne after baptiſme pardoned.
                   thinking and auouching that there is no pardon for any that after he is baptized committeth any publique ſinne. For doth our Sauiour here make any diſtinction of publique or priuat offences, of men baptized or vnbaptized, of tymes before or after. No, no, to our great comfort he doth not as hath before bene ſhewed, but al men hee biddeth pray thus, at all tymes he biddeth pray thus, and for all offences hee biddeth pray thus indefinitly. And except wee ſhall make a mocker of the Lord, what hee biddeth aſke he is ready to giue, and a ſure comfort by his commaundement to pray, may be drawen to my ſoule that I ſhal obtayne.

And therefore litle children theſe things I write, that yee ſinne not.
                     1. Iohn. 2.
                   But if any man doe ſinne wee haue an aduocate with the Father, Ieſus Chriſt the righteous and he is the propitiation for our ſins, &amp; not for ours onely, but alſo for the ſinnes of the whole world. Yea let vs adde to his wordes, but not to his meaning, for ſinnes both before and after baptiſme.
               Nowe do you put me in mind of a queſtion which I only alſo will aſke you. Namely what comfort there is for a frayle creature that after repentance and purpoſe neuer to offende ſo any more, yet ſhall fall againe, euen into the ſame fault, of frayltie, not of malice?
               Surely you name a very notable teſtimony of our moſt vile corruption, that ſolemnely profeſſing our repentance for any bad behauiour, and vowing to the Lorde, and with our ſelues, that no more wee will do ſo, yet contrary both to promiſe and purpoſe, we fall againe into the ſelfeſame offence and ſinne. And if the Lord ſhould neuer receyue vs againe after ſuch a tranſgreſſion, we had but what iuſtly and greatly

wee deſerued. Yet is this mercy more, not to imbolden to ſo great impietie, but to comfort grieued ones with ſo great frailtie. Wherefore with deſire to ſtand, and al poſſible indeuour againſt ſuch ſecond fals, let vs heare yet what the Lorde ſayth, if in our great weakenes wee doe fall, I meane into the ſame offence againe after repentance. For we ſee the Prophets in euerie place exhort men to repentance, not which had once offended, but which with an obſtinate contempt of God had not ſtayed to runne into all kind of wickednes, &amp; which after a ſhewe of repentaunce, yet returned to their ſinnefull courſe agayne, the Prophet Ieremy of all other is full of places, if you liſt to read any, Agayne the Lorde in his law would haue dayly ſacrifices offred ſometime in the name of the whole people, ſometimes in the name of a priuat perſon, aſwell for offences committed by ignorance, as for voluntary tranſgreſſions and falles, which aſſuredly ſhoulde not haue bene done, except there had bene mercy euen for ſecond faults. For the Lord would not deceiue his people with vaine figures.
                     Pſal. 78.
                   Thirdly in the Pſalme we very playnely

ſée that God was intreated to forgiue moſt hypocriticall and obſtinate ſinnes▪ And nowe in the tyme of his Goſpell his goodnes is not ſtreyted or diminiſhed, but euen nowe alſo more playnely it is proclaymed to the worlde, that at what tyme ſoeuer a ſinner ſoroweth from his heart, there is pardon with the Lorde, without exception againſt often committing of the ſame offence. When the Lord inioyneth vs to forgiue our brethren ſeuentie times ſeuen times, doth he meane newe offences only, ſuch as they neuer committed agaynſt vs before, or hee meaneth all, whatſoeuer, or how often ſoeuer fallen into by their frailtie? And if ſo, doth he require more mercy of man than he the God of mercy wil ſhew? or ſhall the creature excell the creator in any goodnes? God forbid. Sée it therefore and be with comfort moſt aſſured of it, that if wee ſinne not ſeuen times, but ſeuentie times ſeuen times againſt his maieſty, and euen in the ſame thing, and ſo often with weeping eyes and ſobbing ſoule fall at his feete for mercy to ſo great frailtie, there is mercy with him and pardon to true repentance.
                     Beware preſumption.
                   But take heede wee turne not the

grace of God into wantonnes &amp; preſumption. For if I ſucke the libertie out of this doctrine, be ſure, I ſauoure it to death, and not to life, and what knew I whether euer I ſhall haue grace truely to repent, what ſo bouldly and preſumptuouſly I haue dared to commit. When the Apoſtle ſayth, If any man ſinne wee haue an aduocate with the Father Ieſus Chriſt the righteous, and he is the propitiation for our ſinnes. Doe you thinke wee may tye this to onely ſuch ſinnes as were neuer committed before without a very playne and great iniury to that place of ſcripture? No, no, we cannot, &amp; therefore a true ground of comfort euen for ſins often fallen into, ſo yt frailtie and not looſenes bee the cauſe, and read the 9. of Daniel,
                  
                     Dan. 9.6.
                   and ſee if hee confeſſe not ſinne often committed, and as it were in a continued courſe, and yet diſpaireth not of mercy? What meaneth that article of our fayth, I beleeue the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes? ſhall we gloſe vpon it thus, that is of ſuch ſins as I neuer cōmitted but once. Surely if wee doe, it muſt bee ſayd, curſed be the gloſe that corrupteth the text. For that article compriſeth al ſinne, before baptiſme,

&amp; after baptiſme, before repentance, &amp; after repentance, euer through the courſe of my life in this worlde, whatſoeuer it is, howe often ſo euer I haue ſlyded into it, through frailtie, yet God giuing mee true repentance for it, Credo remiſſionem.
                  
                     O ſweete.
                   I beleeue the forgiuenes of it. Yea it is the cō
                  fort ſpirituall, that cannot bee ſpoken of, that God woulde haue his children ſo ſure of the pardon of their ſinnes, euen of all their ſinnes, without exception, whereof hee giueth them a diſlike &amp; true abhorring, as that he would haue it an article of their fayth ſo that they ſhould not be ſound chriſtians if they beleeued it not. Laſtly euen this petition of the Lordes prayer, crauing dayly forgiuenes of dayly treſpaſſes, dare you reſtrayne it to treſpaſſes committed onely before repentance, and exempt all ſecond falles after ſuch repentance and purpoſe to amend? the Lord forbid. And therefore take it alſo with the former as a ſure proofe of pardon alſo for theſe offences. So doe you ſee what anſwere your queſtion hath out of Gods booke, onely therefore beware preſumption, beware looſenes, beware negligence, and due care to auoyd

theſe ſeconde falles, ſay not God is mercifull, and therefore I will ſinne. For as hee is gratious to a ſorowfull ſinner: ſo is hee dreadfull to a preſumptuous offender, and frailtie ſhall finde mercy, when boldnes ſhall find iudgement and wrath for euer.
               Surely I ſee it is a great comfort to a Chriſtian conſcience, that the Lord hath put into our daylie prayer this petition, and it mightely aſſureth vs of his mercie.
               In deede it is ſo, but yet this appeareth nothing ſo much as it would if our eyes ſawe, or our harts felt what loathſomneſſe lodged in vs, and what iuſt matter of eternall confuſion wee haue both in bodie and ſoule, if mercy were not. For this is it that giueth a feeling of the ſweetneſſe of this prayer, when the Lorde ſhall graunt vs a true ſight of our owne eſtate, and pearcing eyes into our inwarde deepes. When the Lorde ſhall inable vs truely to ſee what a maſſe of corruption wee are, how vile, how miſerable, how polluted in our thoughtes, workes and deedes, in bodie and ſoule, in hart and minde, within and without and all ouer, how filthie, how loathſome, and how

abhominable wee are, and when hee ſhall ioyne vnto this ſight a terrour, and a trembling at the true view of Gods moſt fearefull iudgement due vnto this eſtate, and moſt firmely tyed vnto it, euen as God is iuſt. And I ſay when the Lord granteth it, for moſt aſſuredly wee haue it not of our ſelues, nay wee flatter and deceiue euery man his owne hart in this point, we thinke all is well with vs, and wee knowe not our ſelues. But what are we? O my beloued, my heart vnderſtandeth not the ſinnes of man, and therefore my tongue cannot lay them open before you. I ſay with Dauid, myne owne ſinnes are ſecret vnto me, and therefore much more all your ſinnes, and moſt of all the ſinnes of all mankinde. Yet ſomewhat heare you of the meditation of my hart, to the better opening of the neceſſitie and goodneſſe of this petition, and learne by this little to thinke of more, and to wade your ſelues into the deepes that you knowe and I knowe not, when I haue led you the way as farre as I doe knowe.
               I haue before in this petition ſhewed you the Herauld of heauen blazeth our armes, and expreſſeth our colours, namely, that

we are all become abhominable, and there is none yt 
                  doth good, no not one. That no fleſh liuing is able to bee iuſtified in his ſight: that none can ſay my hart is cleane, I am pure from ſinne. That the very imaginations of our harts are euill, euen from our youth: that we are not able to thinke a good thought of our ſelues: with a number ſuch. All which places are not ſo to bee taken, as if they charged any of vs with a little euill, or fewe ſinnes, and ſmall, but they conuince vs of huge and great ſinne, and of generall corruption, euen in our wayes, which will verie well appeare if alyke wee compare our ſelues with the Lordes choyce children commended to vs in the word. Stand before me then I pray thee, whoſe hart quaketh not for any ſinne you knowe in your ſelues, and tell mee whether you dare, eyther with your tongues ſay, or with your hearts thinke that you are in as great a meaſure ſanctified, as Dauid was? If you dare not, conſider well then what Dauid notwithſtanding his greate graces giuen him, ſayth of himſelfe in his Pſalmes,
                     Pſal. 38.
                   
                  There is no reſt in my bones becauſe of my ſinne: for

mine iniquitie is gone ouer mine head, and as a waightie burthen, they are too heauie for me to beare. Had Dauid no reſt in his bones for his ſin, and haue you reſt in your ſelfe, and yet dare not compare with him in ſanctification? How commeth this to paſſe, but becauſe you neyther ſee nor feele what is in your ſelfe as hee did? Innumerable troubles, ſayth he agayne,
                     Pſal. 40.12.
                   
                  haue compaſſed mee about, my ſinnes haue taken ſuch holde on me, that I am not able to looke vp, yea, they are mo in number than the haires of my head, and my heart hath failed me. O the dulneſſe of our feeling, howe ſhoulde I laie it before vs better than by ſuch examples? If Dauids ſinnes were mo than his haires, how many are ours thinke you? Surely moe than the ſand of the ſea: if they had taken holde on him, what haue ours done on vs? If he could not for them looke vp, how may we looke downe? And finally, if his heart began to ſhake, how Lorde may ours but ſhake and quake, if wee knew our ſelues? Iudge euen your ſelfe anie one that is here, if it be not ſo, ſeeing you grant me you dare not compare with Dauid.
                  
Wounded then are wee euen to many deaths, and yet we knowe it not. Ponder it with your ſelfe alſo what that great ſeruant of God Ezra ſayth of himſelfe in this caſe. O my GOD, ſayth he, I am confounded and aſhamed to lifte vp mine eyes vnto thee my God,
                  
                     Ezra. 9.6.
                   
                  for our iniquities are increaſed ouer our head, &amp; our treſpaſſes are growen vp to the heauen, and wee cannot ſtande before thee, becauſe of our ſinne. And Daniel againe, We haue ſinned: wee haue committed iniquitie: we haue done wickedly, yea, wee haue rebelled agaynſt thee, and departed from thy precepts. See how no words can contēt him to expreſſe his guilt withall. Therfore I ſaie, when the Scripture chargeth vs with ſinne, it is no ſmall ſinne that we muſt dreame of, but monſterous corruption and horrible before the Lord, if we could ſee it all. Yet doth euery one deceiue his owne heart, and being in this moſt dreadfull and deſperate caſe, feeleth it not, but thinketh all is wel, till euen the laſt houre ouertake vs, &amp; then Satan chargeth vs to the full, &amp; we deſpaire. But trulie if we learn to charge our ſelues now

in the time of health, our burthen ſhall not be ſo great in the time of ſickneſſe. And therefore I praie you do it, either by many times comparing your liues with theſe great Saintes of God, or by viewing the commandements, or by any meanes what ſouer, that may bee good and profitable to this effect. And thinke with your ſelues, that if theſe choſē veſſels, notwithſtanding ſo greate graces giuen them, yet groaned vnder ſuch waight of deadly ſinnes, alaſſe what may wee doe that want many thouſand degrees of theyr goodneſſe, ſaue onely that we feele not, through a deadneſſe of heart, the burthen of iniquitie that is vpon vs. By theyr feeling then, iudge what you ought to feele: by theyr confeſſions, what you ſhould confeſſe, and by theyr ſhiuering feares, what you may many millions of times more iuſtly feare. Think alſo of the puniſhment temporall and of the death eternal, in that flaming lake of dreadful wo, due and aſſured to all ſinfull creatures for euermore.
                     Dei dicere est facere.
                   And ſee then if it be not ſweete to heare of remiſſion of all this euill. See if this petition be not thrice needfull to cō
                  ſciences crying, our Lord is great. O deereſt

God, that woulde bidde vs aſke, teach vs and tell vs, yea, will and commaunde vs euerie daie and houre to praie for pardon for iniquitie. For thus do we ſee thy willingneſſe to giue, neuer vſing to bidde vs aſke, but what thou art ready to grant euen before we aſke. Thus do we ſee our pardon is readie, and though worthie wee bee neuer once to feele anie inwarde ioy, or outward comfort, yet in thy mercie wee ſhall finde both, by thy gracious forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes. And Lorde of mercie make vs thankfull.
               
                  The Prayer.
                  
                     O Lord and Father ſweete &amp; mercifull, we fall down in our heartes heere before thy maieſtie, &amp; beg thy mercie. For we haue ſinned, O Lord, wee haue ſinned &amp; done wickedly, &amp; our conſciences crieth, thy wrath is due, if we find not mercy. Our thoughtes, our words, and workes haue bene againſt thy bleſſed

will and commaundement, and ſtil ſtill our moſt grieuous corruption pulleth vs from thy wayes. We may bee aſhamed and confounded to lifte vp our eyes to thee, ſo increaſed ouer our heads are our iniquities, and our ſinnes ſo grieuous euen to the heauens. But with thee there is mercie, and therfore thou ſhalt bee feared. O LORDE in that mercie lifte vp the light of thy countenance vpon vs, and ſaue vs. Let that precious bloud of Ieſus Chriſt daſh and waſh out al our offences, for we flie vnto it, and with the armes of our faith claſping faſt that deere Sauiour, wee ſet him before thee as our attonement, peace, and propitiation for euer auaileable with thee. For his ſake, not for ours. O Lord heare, O Lord forgiue, O Lord conſider, and doo it, deferre not for thy mercie ſake. Comfort our conſciences with that ſweet and dropping dew of mercie and grace, for they ſhake &amp; tremble at thy iudgementes. Strengthen our ſteppes heereafter for Ieſus Chriſt his ſake more &amp; more, that they may be ſtreighter, and we poſſeſſe theſe

veſſels of ours in more cleanneſſe, holineſſe, and righteouſneſſe, than we haue done. And foraſmuch as it is all repugnant and contrarie to our ſinful nature and rebelling bloud, to forgiue other mē theyr treſpaſſes committed againſt vs without reuenge, and to loue them that hate vs, to praie for them that perſecute vs, as thou haſt willed, deere Father we beſeech thee helpe vs therein, and by thy working power within vs make our hearts ſo meeke and gentle, that we may gladly &amp; vnfainedly, heartely &amp; wholy forgiue all men that haue hated or hurted vs by word or deed, &amp; that wee may behaue our ſelues vnto al men, friends and foes, with ſuch mercy, gentleneſſe, and kindneſſe, as we would deſire, not only that they, but alſo that thou, good Lord, ſhouldeſt vſe vnto vs. Finally, deere Father, in life haue mercie, in death haue mercy, and euermore haue mercie vppon vs, in that bleſſed kingdome of thine, for Ieſus Chriſt his ſake our bleſſed Lord &amp; Sauiour, Amen.
               
            
            
               
               
                  The ſixt and laſt petition: Leade vs not into temptation. &amp;c.
               
               
                  We drawe now neere an end of this labour, and are come to the laſt requeſt in this prayer, wherein proceeding as you haue done in the former, I praie you firſt ſhew the order of it.
               
               
                  THE order is meruailous fit, that after we haue in a ſtinging wo for them, begged of the Lorde our God moſt heartely and earneſtly the forgiueneſſe of all our ſinnes and treſpaſſes alreadie paſt and done, we ſhould next as obedient children, not agayne to grieue ſo déere &amp; good a Father, beſeeche him for his mercies ſake to aide and ſtrengthen vs againſt that which is to come, that wee may not offend and fault as wee haue done, but by an happie new birth and ſpirite of power vouchſafed from his heauēly grace vnto vs, be able to fight agaynſt all ſinfull corruption daylie

and euer vexing vs, more and more. For in this order ſpeaketh the Lord ſtill ſtill in his word,
                     Iohn. 5.14. Iohn. 8.11. Tit. 2.11.12.
                   that if we be made whole wee ſhould ſinne no more. That if the grace of God that bringeth ſaluation vnto al men hath appeared, we ſhould thereby learne to denie vngodlynes and worldly luſts, and that wee ſhould liue ſoberly &amp; righteouſly &amp; godly in this preſent world.
                  
                     Cantic. 5.3.
                   And in this order reaſoneth euen the ſpouſe her ſelf, I haue waſhed my feet, and therefore how ſhould I foule them agayne? Wherefore I ſay as concerning order, after pardon begged for paſſed ſin, moſt fitly doe wee aſke next the power of his grace againſt what is to come.
               Surely it is not onely fit in regard of order, but moſt neceſſary alſo in reſpect of the thing.
               In deed it is, and that for theſe cauſes: firſt in reſpect of our owne corruption and vileneſſe, of whome the ſpirit of God hath ſayd by Iob, that man is abhominable and filthie,
                  
                     Iob. 15.16.
                   
                  drinking iniquitie lyke water, that is, euen ſo deſiring to ſinne, as hée that is thirſtie to drinke. Secondly, in reſpect of the infinite allurementes and delights

that ſin hath to pull vs on to it from God, which we are ſo far from repulſing &amp; gayne ſtanding, that wee readily and moſt willingly yeelde to them, except the Lorde aſſiſt vs, and inable vs by his ſpirite. Yet are thoſe delicates our death both in bodie and ſoule for euer, if we followe them. For it is true of al men which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the widow,
                     1. Tim. 5.6.
                   that ſhe liuing in pleaſure is dead whileſt ſhe liueth ſo. And agayn, If ye liue after the fleſh, ye ſhal die. Of theſe alluremēts and delights in ſinne ſpake the holy Ghoſt when he called them the pleaſures of ſinne.
                     Hebre. 11.25.
                   And Dauid when hee ſayde, Incline not my heart to euill,
                  
                     Pſal. 141.4. Math. 13.22. Cantic. 2.15. Hebre. 3.13.
                   
                  that I ſhoulde commit wicked workes with men that worke iniquitie, and let mee not eate of their delicates. There is alſo a ſubtiltie in ſinne to deceiue vs, a deceitfulneſſe in riches to choke vs, and therfore moſt needfull this prayer, that we be not hindered through the deceitfulneſſe of ſinne. Thirdly, in reſpect of the power of the enimie which is verie greate. For we wreſtle not agaynſt fleſh and bloud,
                  
                     Epheſ. 6.12.
                   
                  but againſt principalities and powers, and agaynſt worldly gouernours, the

Princes of darkneſſe of this worlde, agaynſt ſpirituall wickedneſſe, which are in the high places, and which farre excéed vs in ſtrength, &amp; therfore great neede haue wee to beſeech the Lord to ſtand with vs, in this battayle to helpe vs. Which we do in this petition. For Quicquid humana fragilitas cauere aut vitare non praeualet, hîc a nobis ab illo propitio conferri petimus, Whatſoeuer (ſayth Auſten) mans frailtie is not able to take heed of or auoid,

                   that do we beſeech the Lorde heere may bee giuen vs in his mercie. Laſtly, the diligence and indeauour of our aduerſarie to winne, and his crueltie if he do winne, is ſo great, that we haue neede and need agayne to vſe this petition:
                     1. Pet. 5.8.
                   
                  Bee ſober and watch (ſayth the Apoſtle) for your aduerſarie the deuill goeth about like a roring Lyon, ſeeking whom he may deuour. His continuall walking ſheweth his diligence, and his blody deuouring noteth his cruelty. Thus haue we the equitie of this prayer, yea, the neceſſitie of it euer, whileſt we liue in this wretched vale of theſe aſſaultes and daungers. In reſpecte of which neceſſitie, no doubt both our Sauiour firſt taught it,

and alſo in his worde ſo often repeateth it. Watch ye and pray ye,
                  
                     Marc. 14.38. 1. Theſſ 3.5. 1. Timoth. 6.9 1 Cor. 10.13.
                   
                  that ye enter not into temptation. The ſpirit in deede is willing, but the fleſh is fraile. With ſuch lyke places. And very truely ſayeth Hierome, Non eſt noſtrarum virium cum hoſtibus noſtris ſpiritualibus congredi, &amp; eos vincere, ſed Dei. It is not our ſtrength that may ioyne with our ſpirituall foes, and ouercome them, but the Lord muſt do it.
               Is all this 
                     〈◊〉
                   one Petition?
               They that make ſeauen petitions in this Lords prayer do deuide this laſt into two, to make vp their number, of which ſort is Thomas of Aquine, Lyra and others. But the better iudgement is theirs that make but ſixe petitions in al, and but one of this. Of which ſort againe are Auſten and Cyprian, who make this later, as in deede it is, but an expoſition of the former, as if hee ſhould haue ſayd, to that ende that we may bee deliuered from euill, O Lord leade vs not into temptation. And this whole laſt petition may fitly be deuided thus, into the petition it ſelfe, Ne nos inducas in tentationem, and into the expoſition or interpretation

of the ſame, ſed libera nos à malo.
               
               But men do not agree in reading this petition. For ſome ſay Leade vs not, and others ſay, Let vs not be led.
               
               In deede it is true. Some are afrayde and haue bin, that if they ſhould ſay Leade vs not into temptation, they ſhould fall into that foule errour of the Manichees, that God might be the author of euill. And therefore to auoyd that, they haue thought rather good to ſay, Let vs not be led. But both the beſt and auncienteſt tranſlation and reading is the firſt, and ſo tranſlated and read it many a yeere agoe Tertullian and others of the elder fathers.
               And doth not, thinke you, that reading giue ſome aduantage to the enemie, that wee make God the author of ſinne?
               Not a whit iuſtly. For as you haue heard before in this booke, it is one thing to bee author of a matter, &amp; an other thing to be author of ye forme: in playner termes, to bee author of an action, and of the euill in the action,
                     Act· 17.28.
                   or of the action. When the Apoſtle ſayth, in him we liue, and moue, and haue our being: what meaneth hee but

that God is author of all our actions in reſpect of matter, as wee ſpeake, that is, the motion, power, and ſtrength of body, to go hether or thether, and to doe this or that is of God: for without his helpe we could not ſtirre: but as for forme, if it be euill, that is, as for the corruption, fault and euill of our actions, that is of our ſelues, and not of God as author and worker, though euen of that alſo he is the guider and gouernour that it ſhall not paſſe the limits that he liketh. As in Ioſephs brethren and many other examples are playne. Wherefore wee may not for want of true vnderſtanding how to take them, alter the phraſes, and conſequently the truth of GOD. You ſee how the Spirite ſpeaketh:
                     Exod. 4.21.
                   
                  God hardned the hart of Pharaoh: God gaue them vp to vile affections,
                  
                     Ro. 1.26.28.
                   
                  and deliuered them vp into a reprobate minde. The Lorde mingled among them the ſpirit of error:
                  
                     Eſa. 19.14.
                   
                  
                     2. Theſ. 2.
                   
                  God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſions: and a number ſuch. He doth not ſay, God ſuffred Pharaohs hart to be hardned,
                     Eſay. 63.17.
                   God ſuffred them to be giuen to vile affections, or to a reprobate mind, &amp;c.
                     Eſay. 42.24.
                   But God hardened, &amp; gaue, and deliuered,
                     1. Sam. 16.24.
                   and mingled,

and ſent. Theſe are all as much as to ſay, Leade vs not into temptation. And therefore if theſe may be vſed without making the Lord any author of euil,
                     If God ſuffer, then doth he it either againſt his will or with his wil if againſt his will, then is he not omnipotent: if with his will, then may we aſwell ſay he doth it as he ſuffreth it, vnderſtanding it rightly.
                   then may this petition alſo no doubt in this order▪ and if in theſe places wee neede not to chaunge the text and to ſay, God let Pharaoh be hardened, or God let them be giuen ouer, &amp;c. No more neede wee here to tranſlate or interpret this petition thus, Let vs not be lead into temptation. But to remember euer that though the Lord doe, and bee ſayd to leade into temptation, yet is there neuer any euill in him, but either iuſtice to ſome to puniſh ſinne with ſinne, or mercie to others to trye them and exerciſe them, that after they haue ſhewed patience and faith, obedience, humilitie, loue and comfort in their tryalles, he may ſet a Crowne of great glorie vpon their heads, to their euerlaſting life in a glorious kingdome. And in the meane time by thoſe their vertues glorifie his name amongſt men here,
                     Se alſo the Tom. pag. 38. &amp;c· Petr. Martir. in 2. Sam. 24.
                   and incite others to tread the ſteps of ſo happie a courſe. So that what the Lord doth is euer good: and for further treatiſe of this thing, turne backe agayne to that

which hath bene ſayd before.

                     Yet it ſeemeth wee croſſe S. Iames by this reading, who ſayth, If any man bee tempted, let him not euer ſay hee is tempted of GOD, for GOD cannot bee tempted of euill, neither tempteth he any man. But euery man is tempted when he is drawne away by his owne concupiſcence, and is entiſed, &amp;c.
                  
Nothing at all truely, if you marke things well. For S. Iames there deſcending from outwarde temptations, to wit, afflictions whereby God tryeth vs, to inward, that is, to thoſe luſtes whereby wee are ſtirred vp to do euill, ſheweth that euery man is author of thoſe temptations to himſelfe, and not God, foraſmuch as wee beare about in our boſomes that wicked corruption, which taketh occaſions by what meanes ſoeuer to ſtirre vp euill motions in vs, whenceout at length proceede wicked doings, and in concluſion followeth death the iuſt reward of them. All which is no other than the very ſame that hath bene ſaid. For wee euer confeſſe, that although God tempt and leade into temptation, yet neuer tempteth he any man to euill. And why?

S. Iames giueth the reaſon, for God can not be tempted with euill, neither tēpteth he any man (to witte, vnto euill) that is, he deſireth not euill, and therefore he can not be the author of euill doing in vs. Non de exploratione, ſed de incitatione ad peccandum loquitur Jacobus. S Sames ſpeaketh not of the temptations of tryall,
                     Vrſi
                           •
                        .
                   but of ſtirrings vp vnto euill, ſayth an interpreter. And it is apparant enough.
               Nowe of the next worde if you will, to wit, temptation.
               
               It is a woorde that will miniſter much matter profitable for the Lords children to bee ſtil better and better acquainted withall whilſt they liue. And I coulde happely wiſh to ſpeake ſo of it, as moſt of this company might moſt bee benefited, and euery man, at one time, or an other, in one thing or an other, feele mee in his boſome. But ſuch grace is the Lordes to giue, and not mine nor any mans to take, and therefore with humble commending both my ſpéech and your profitte to his moſt mercifull direction, let vs ſet vpon this treatiſe. It is therefore ſayd of the learned, that tentatio eſt opus diaboli, qua homines pios vel per inſtillationem

cogitationum malarum, aut per obiectorum occaſionem, vel per vitioſae naturae inclinationem &amp; affectus, vel per res ſecundas aut aduerſas ſolicitat, &amp; impellit ad peccata &amp; calamitates, deo permittente, vt aut certo iudicio propter peccata puniantur, aut explorata &amp; probata fide eorum &amp; conſtantia coronam vitae accipiant. That is, temptation is a worke of the deuil,
                     What temptation is.
                   whereby he ſoliciteth, and driueth men vnto ſins and miſeries either by infuſion of vile thoughtes into them, or by meanes of obiects layd before them, or by inclination of their corrupt nature and affections, GOD ſuffering him, either that their ſinnes by iuſt iudgements may haue their due puniſhments, or elſe their fayth and conſtancie a due crowne of life after that it hath bene tried &amp; made manifeſt. This diſtinction, or deſcription rather, will fully by all his partes appeare either by the ſtory of Iob, of Dauid,
                  
                     Iob. 1. 2. Kings. 24.1.
                   or by diuers others in this treatiſe, if you marke it. Agayne it is ſayd of them alſo that temptations bee of two ſorts generally, Tentatio probationis, tentatio perditionis. The temptation of tryall, and the temptation of perdition, according

to which diuiſion Cyprian may be thought to haue ſpoken, when he ſayd: Poteſtas dupliciter Satanae aduerſus nos datur, vel ad poenam cùm delinquimus, vel ad gloriam cum probamur. Power is giuen to Satan againſt vs after two ſorts, to wit, either for puniſhment when wee offend, or for glory when wee are tryed. But deſiring altogether a very great playnnes in this matter for diuers cauſes I chooſe rather an other diuiſion obſerued alſo of ſ

                           God.

                   to ſay, that temptations are of three ſortes, to wit, either of God, of man, or of Satan. For all theſe are ſayd to tempt. And according to theſe ſeuerall authors as it were of temptations, the word is diuerſly and in ſeuerall ſignifications taken. When God in the Scripture is ſayd to tempt, then is the word taken and commonly tranſlated in Engliſh to prooue or to trye, becauſe that the drift of the Lord is thereby not to hurt by leading to euill, for ſo GOD tempteth not. Iam. 1. but to make open &amp; knowne by tryall, either to our ſelues, or to the world, or to both, either our corruption and malice againſt him, or elſe our faith and patience, and many vertues. Thus is it ſayd of

Abraham in Geneſis. After theſe things God did prooue Abraham, &amp;c.
                     Gen. 22.1.
                   What was this proouing or tempting of Abraham, but a mercifull opening both to Abraham himſelfe, and to all other, euen to vs at this day, what a wonderfull meaſure of fayth, loue and zeale to his God he had vouchſafed vnto Abraham. So that both he ſawe then, and we ſee now, what neith
                     •
                  r we, nor happely he himſelfe knew till after this tryal or temptation had had his place. This reade we againe in the lawe. Then ſayd the Lorde to Moſes,
                  
                     Exod. 16.4.
                   
                  Beholde I will cauſe breade to rayne from heauen to you, and the people ſhal go out and gather that that is ſufficiēt for euery day, that I may proue them, whether they will walke in my lawe or no. That is, that it may appeare both to themſelues and others, whether receiuing but that which is ſufficient only for one day at once, they will patiently depend vpon my prouidence from day to day. Probat enim Deus homines, nō quaſi ipſe experimento indigeat, ſed quò magis ſeipſos norint, &amp; poſita omni arrogantia &amp; inani perſuaſione, humiliter ſe in poſterum Deo ſubmittāt. For God proueth

not, ſayth one, as though he had need of any tryall to knowe any of vs all, but that men may themſelues thereby knowe better what is in them, and laying aſide al arrogancie and vayne perſwaſion, humbly ſubmit themſelues afterwarde to God.
                     Exod. 20.20.
                   Againe, when at the giuing of the lawe the people ſawe the thunders, and lightnings, the ſounde of the trumpet, the mountayne ſmoking, and for feare thereof fled &amp;c. then Moſes ſayd to the people, Feare not, for God is come to proue you, and that his feare may be before you, that yee ſinne not.
                  
                     Deutro. 8.2.
                   Again in Deutronomy. Thou ſhalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God lead thee this fortie yeeres in the wildernes, for to humble thee, and to proue thee to know what was in thy heart, whether thou wouldeſt keepe his commaundements or no. For in affliction either by patiently abyding or by vngodly grudging and repyning, wee ſhewe what was in vs, though hiddē before. Moſt playnely agayne in the thirteenth chapter: If there ariſe among you a Prophet,
                  
                     Deutro. 13.1
                   
                  a dreamer of dreams, &amp; giue thee a ſigne or wonder, and the ſigne or the wonder

come to paſſe which he hath told thee, ſaying, let vs go after other Gods which thou haſt not knowne, and let vs ſerue them: Thou ſhalt not hearken vnto the woordes of the Prophet, or vnto that dreamer of dreames, for the Lord your God proueth you, to know whether ye loue the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your ſoule.
                  
                     Iudg. 2.22.
                   Laſt of all in the booke of Iudges, I will no more ſayth the Lord, caſt out before them any of the nations which Ioſhua left when he dyed, and why? it followeth in the next verſe: That through them I may proue Iſrael, whether they will keepe the way of the Lorde, to walke therein, as their fathers kept it, or not. Thus doe we ſee then howe the Lord is ſayd to tempt man, namely when by ſuch meanes as pleaſeth him, hee tryeth and prooueth man, not to winne any knowledge to himſelfe that hee had not before, for how ſhould he that made the heart bee ignorant of any thing in the heart, no, hee vnderſtandeth the thoughtes long before, but to the end that the parties themſelues, that are thus proued, &amp; others alſo by them, and in them, may ſee what

before was not ſeene, either of good vnto prayſe, or euill vnto puniſhment and example to beware. And thus much of this for a while.
               Your next member is howe man tempteth.
               
                  
                     How man tempteth.
                  Man is alſo ſayde to tempt ſometymes man, and ſometimes God. His tempting of man is alſo ſometime in the better part, ſometime in the worſe. In the better when he doth but proue and try whether further he may truſt,
                     Cicero.
                   as it is wiſedome alwaies to do to our friendes. For vtendum amicis tanquam praetentatis aquis, aptae ſint vado, an non. We muſt vſe friends, ſayd that wiſe heathen once, as waters that we haue tryed before, whether they may ſafely be aduentured vpon, or no to paſſe ouer. Alſo when the Father or maſter leaueth ſome looſe money to ſee whether his childe or ſeruant will ſteale or no, this is a kinde of tempting or trying, yet but in good part, with a number ſuch like, that men to men muſt and may,
                     1. King. 10.1.
                   as they ſhal ſee occaſion, vſe. To this kind may be referred the Queene of the South, who hearing the fame of Solomon, concerning the name of ye Lord,

came to tempt him or proue him with hard queſtions. In the worſe part man doeth tempt man either by queſtions or actions. By queſtions when they deale as the Phariſees did about ye tribute with Chriſt,
                     Math. 22. Luc. 20.20.
                   ſeeke to ſnare and catch their brethren to deſtroy or hurt them. Such tempters and temptations were thoſe dayes of perſecution full of vnder Queene Mary, when no ſooner was any apprehended and cōuented before them, but their interrogatories inferred either death of ſoule by denying a trueth, or death of body by affirming the ſame. Neither doth yet this world want theſe tempters by queſtions, where true religion and knowledge of God ruleth not tongue and heart, and all. Whereupon many innocent ſoules are trapped ere they wit, and harmleſſe hearts not ſpying hidden driftes, put the collar about their owne neckes to deſtroy themſelues, that is, ſpeake or do ſimply, what is wrinched to a vantage they neuer feared, nor thought of againſt thēſelues. Thriſe needefull therefore with the ſimplicitie of the doue is the wiſedome of the ſerpent. By actions man tempteth whē either by woordes or deedes of bad example

they alure other to ſinne and euill.
                     Gen. 3. Iob. 2. Tobiae. 2.
                   Thus tempted Eue her huſbande to eate of the apple, Iobs wife her huſband to curſe God and dye, Tobias wife her huſbande to bee weary of well doing, Putiphars wife her ſeruant to filthines, &amp; thoſe wicked Prieſts that ſayd,
                     Iere. 18.
                   
                  Come let vs imagine a deuiſe againſt Ieremy, with many ſuch in the Scriptures: of which tempters and temptations that wiſe Salomon warneth when he ſaith: My ſonne, if ſinners intiſe thee, conſent not vnto thē,
                  
                     Prou. 1.10. wiſd. 2.
                   
                  if they ſay, come with vs, we will lay wayte for blood, and lye priuily for the innocent without a cauſe, caſt thy lot in amongſt vs, we will haue one purſe,
                  
                     Pſal. 1.
                   &amp;c. And truely bleſſed is that man and woman that walketh not in thoſe counſels of the vngodly, ſtandeth not in the way of theſe aluring ſinners, nor ſitteth not in the ſeates of thoſe reprobate ſcorners.
               And how tempteth Satan?
               Satan tempteth when hee moueth vs to leaue God and that obedience that wee owe vnto him any way, and to do euil, and therefore looke how many branches of well doing are in the lawe of God implied, euen

ſo many contrary wayes doeth this enemy aſſault and tempt vs Of this temptation doeth the holy Ghoſt ſpeake when he ſaith, Then was Ieſus led aſide of the ſpirit into the wildernes to bee tempted of the deuill. And Peter, when he ſayd,
                     Math. 4.

                  Ananias why hath Satan filled thine heart that thou ſhouldeſt lye vnto the holy Ghoſt. And Paul when he ſayth,
                     1. Cor. 7.5.
                   
                  let man &amp; wife come againe together that Satan tempt them not for incontinencie. Again,

                   In which aſſaultes of his hee vſeth our owne corruption and concupiſcence, the worlde, the wicked and many meanes, but the Lord is ſtronger than they al, if we cleaue to him, either wholy to kéep vs yt we fall not at all, if it ſo pleaſe him, as others do, or elſe to rayſe vs vp againe, when they haue vs downe vnder their feete, &amp; to giue vs victorie.

For firſt as concerning Gods temptations which more properly may bee called trials, we beſeech his maieſtie in this prayer that he would deale in mercy and fauour with vs euermore, and neuer lay more vpon vs than hee will make vs able to indure, but that he would giue iſſue with the temptation, and helpe vs. Thus farre do we pray euen againſt theſe, as ſhall further bee declared when we come to the ſecond part of this petition.
                     How againſt mans.
                   Touching mans tryals or temptations we likewiſe herein begge of his mercy that for any queſtions moued to vs he would tender his owne glory and neuer ſuffer our wants to make anſwere to preiudice his trueth with the vnbeleeuers, but that hee woulde helpe in time of neede and either keepe vs from appoſings aboue our power to ſatiſfie, or elſe giue a mouth and vtterance, that no haters of his glorie may be able to reſiſt, that in our weakenes he being ſtrōg, ye glory may be his, as it is due euer, and we that bee the ſheepe of his paſture may giue him prayſe for euer.
                     How againſt Satans.
                   The third ſort which is Satans temptations, it is our meaning, that the great mercy of

our gracious God would ſo farre ſupport vs, that we may neuer be vanquiſhed and ouercome of any of them, but deliuered and ſaued by him from all euill. And thus you ſee howe we pray againſt them all in this order, as we ſhall further ſhew (I ſay) hereafter. Yet is this laſt chiefly meant, to wit, that foraſmuch as our whole nature is corrupt and giuen to ſinne,
                     Gen. 
                           •
                        .
                   if the Lord forſake vs we are headdely caried to what alurements and prouocations ſoeuer we ſée before vs, the Lord in mercy woulde deliuer vs from this promptnes and aptnes of our natures to admit of ſinne, and by his grace deliuer vs from euill.
               Let vs not now leaue theſe things thus, but euen yet further thinke of them. And to begin with the firſt, to witte Gods temptations or tryals,1. Cor. 6.1. and of thoſe, firſt with thoſe that are of the right hande, alas howe fewe conſider thus much in proſperitie, that thereby the Lorde tryeth them, and ſearcheth out what they are, and how they will ſhew themſelues to him for all thoſe bleſſings.
               Moſt true it is, the more pitie. And yet

doth the Lorde ſo in deede, whenſoeuer he powreth his mercies vpon man or woman in this world.
                     Needfull meditations in proſperitie.
                   For as with a gager he gageth them by thoſe bleſſings, openeth and reueyleth what maner of ſtuffe they are within, thankfull or vnthankfull, kinde or vnkinde, humble or proude, carefull or careleſſe to pleaſe the giuer: finally, whether good or bad, he maketh it ſeene. Wherfore a little to helpe vs in this tryall, it is good to conſider many times of theſe poyntes. Firſt, how in truth I come by the bleſſings that I inioy: ſecondly, to what manner of perſons the continuance of them is promiſed: thirdly, the true ende and right vſe of them: and laſtly, the fearefull examples of abuſe. Theſe things will profite vs if wee knowe them well. Concerning the firſt therfore, it is too common with both great and ſmall, to ſticke in ſecond cauſes, and to light ſhort of the chiefe fountayne and well head in deed. Why we haue health, welth, friendes, mariages, honor, credit, offices, children, and a thouſand of Gods comfortable fauours in this life, we can alleage many reaſons that I wil not ſtand to repeat. But the reaſon of reaſons, either wee alleage

not euer, or it pearceth no further within the teeth than the tip of the tongue is, The Lorde hath giuen.
                  
                     Iob. 1.
                   Whereas in deede the whole courſe of Scripture teacheth, that this is the head, and roote of all our ioyfull daies and dealings, and euer was, and onely is and can bée, either for our good, if we vſe them well, or for our plague if we do the contrary. Ioſeph a poore mans childe came to a great place in the lande of Aegipt,
                  
                     Gen. 41.40. &amp;c.
                   if we marke it well when the King ſayd to him, onely in the Kings throne will I be aboue thee. When he was ouer all the Kings Court, and ouer all the land, when the King commaunded al his people to bee armed at his worde, tooke his owne ring of his owne finger and put it vpon his hand, arayed him in garments then of the richeſt with a chayne of golde about his necke, ſet him vpon the beſt Charret he had ſaue one, and all the people cryed before him as he ridde, for honor ſake vppon their knees, tender Father. Ioſeph was alſo wiſe and full of the ſpirit of God.
                     verſ. 38.
                   Yet leaſt wee ſhould prattle prophanely of Fortune and lucke, or dote vndutifully vppon his gifts, and ſo robbe the Lorde of his due honor,

it is expreſſely ſayde,
                     Gen. 39.2.3
                   that the Lorde was with Ioſeph, and made all that hee did to proſper in his hand. The Lorde therefore author of all his proſperitie and aduauncement whatſoeuer. Dauid the yongeſt brother that little ruddie cheeked Shepheard, from his hooke and his cloake his Sling and Scrip, came to the famous kingdome of Iſrael, and therein ruled with great honor and princely maieſtie for his time, yet neither by wiſedome nor pollicie of himſelf or his frends, but the Lord tooke him from following the Ewes great with young, and made him ruler of his people. And Dauid proſpered and grewe, for the Lord God of Hoſtes was with him,
                     Pſal. 2. Sam. 5.10. 1. Chron. 17.8
                   ſayth the text. So that God was the fountayne of all his good. Which as a true childe, and thankfull to his God, the ſame Dauid afterwarde remēbred to his ſonne Salomon, when hee tolde him that hee ſhould build a houſe for the Lord,
                     1. Chron. 22.
                   and ſhould therfore proſper becauſe the Lord ſhould bee with him. Salomon againe confeſſed it, when he ſayd that euerie man eateth and drinketh &amp; ſeeth the commoditie of his labor,
                  
                     Eccleſ· 3.13. chap. 2.24. Ioel. 2.19.
                   
                  this is the gift of God. Beholde I will ſende

you corne and wine and oyle, and you ſhall be ſatiſfied therewith, and I will no more make you a reproche among the Heathen, ſayth the Lord. And againe by another Prophet, The ſeede ſhal be proſperous, the vine ſhall giue her fruit,
                  
                     Zach. 8.12.
                   
                  and the ground ſhall giue her increaſe, and the heauens ſhall giue their dew, and I will cauſe the remnant of this people to poſſeſſe all things. So euer it is the note that the Scripture keepeth, that all proſperitte and well doing in this world is the gift of God, and cannot be attayned agaynſt his will. Which lykewiſe might be ſhewed in anie particular that can bee named, if we wold take that courſe. Al which we note not nowe ſo much to teach a thing vnknowen, as to remember a thing not thought of, or at the leaſt not ſo duely, and often, and earneſtly thought of as it ſhould be. I ſpeake what I knowe, and what hidden conſciences muſt needes confeſſe to be too true. For coulde it be if wee did thus thinke, that there ſhould bee ſo little care of ſuch a GOD in many, as there is, whoſe backes be laden, yea, and euen preſſed, as it were, downe to the ground, with the hope

of God his mercies? Whoſe tables richly hee hath deckte in deſpight of their foes, whoſe head with balme he hath refreſhed,
                     Pſal. 23.
                   whoſe cuppes doe ouerflow? No, no. But if our wretches hearts did feele it, and that with a power, as theſe motiōs vſe to heaue in Gods Saincts. O my ſweete God and deere Father, this is thy dooing for thy wretche, and all theſe things that I inioye (goe to particulars) they are thy giftes, who mighteſt haue ſette mee at the doore with my pitcher to begge my foode, and farre otherwiſe haue dealt with me, if thou wouldeſt, I tell you it would wring foorth other loue and fruits to ſuch a God again, than appeare in many. And therefore aſſuredly wee thinke not of the fountaine and giuer of theſe things as we ſhould. Amend then what is amiſſe, and giue the Lord his due. It is he that hath lifted out of ye mire, and ſet any with the Princes, euen with the Princes of the people. It is hee that bleſſeth the baſket and the dow, it is he that hath giuen whatſoeuer good thing wee inioy, and curſed we if we denie it, or careleſly neglect the ſweete meditation of it euer. But to what end now hath he done all

theſe thinges? Truely euen to proue mee and trye me what I wil do to him againe, and that it may appeare to the world, and to mine owne eyes, what maner of man or woman I am within and in déede; one that will bee puft vp and forget both God and my ſelfe in proſperitie, or one that will euen weepe water of myne eyes in ye zeale of my ſoule to pleaſe ſuch a father, &amp; grieue that I cannot, as I wiſh, and moſt hartely would. And if I bee the former, that the Lordes iuſtice may bee warranted, if hee change my copie: if the later, that my ſoule may feele comfort in ſo ſweete a God, not onely heaping his mercies vpon me greatly, but giuing mee further a childes heart withall to loue my kind father ſo much the more, which is aboue al.
                     The effect that proſperitie ſhould worke in vs.
                   And which in déed is the very end of Gods mercies and bleſſings, Let Dauid ſpeake, that man according to the Lordes owne heart. What did Gods kindnes worke in him whilſt the ſpirit preuailed? O my God, what ſhall I render againe vnto thee for al the mercies that thou haſt beſtowed vpon me. What I ſay ſhall I render, render againe as if he ſhould ſay, I know theſe bleſſings

require a duetie of mee, a loue, a zeale, a heart, a ſoule, a mind, a life to the glory and prayſe of ſuch a God. And in trueth it is ſo. For we our ſelues for our petite benefites require men to be ours in all lawfull ſort faithfully, firmely, with tongue, and heart, and hand, with body and goods and al. And what compariſon with the Lord? O louing God what can man do for vs like thee, and yet howe care we to pleaſe them, and forget thee? O Lorde awake. Remember alſo what the Prophet complaineth of, ſaying. But this people hath an vnfaythful and rebellious heart,
                  
                     Iere. 5.23.24.
                   
                  they are departed and gone. And why? for they ſay not in their heart, let vs nowe feare the Lorde our God, that giueth rayne both earely &amp; late in due ſeaſon, hee reſerueth vnto vs the appoynted weekes of the harueſt. As if he ſhould haue ſayd this effect ſhoulde Gods bleſſings vpon them haue, euen earneſtly and hartely to make them ſeeke the Lorde and ſerue him, and with many a feruent motion to thinke of ſo good a GOD as in mercy poureth ſo many comforts vppon vnworthy wretches. And eſpecially marke it that becauſe they did not thus,

therefore he ſaith they had rebellious harts and were gone away. A fearefull ſentence of a true iudge concerning all vnthankfull vſers of proſperitie. Againe the ſame Prophet in an other place,
                     Iere. 31.12.
                   
                  They ſhal come &amp; reioyce in the light of Sion, &amp; ſhal come to the bountifulnes of the Lord (why?) euen for the wheate, and for the wyne, and for the oyle, and for the increaſe of ſheepe and bullockes, and their ſoule ſhall be as a watered garden, &amp;c. Sée ſtill what Gods mercies ſhould woorke in vs, euen a reioyſing in ſo deare a Father, and not a going, but a running to his ſeruice &amp; worſhip that is ſo kind vnto vs. Knoweſt thou not ſaith the Apoſtle,
                     Rom. 2.4.
                   
                  that the riches of his bountifulnes and patience: and long ſuffering leadeth thee vnto repentance. In effect, knoweſt thou not that if God be thy deare, ſweete, and tender Father, that thou againe art bound to bee his louing, carefull, and obedient childe? In trueth it ſhould be ſo. And if the Lord were not in his goodneſſe paſt the reach of any mortall braine, he might ſay alſo his benefites had caught a goodly reward or catch of my goodnes, for alas what are wee? or

what is our loue? yet ſince it is his mercy vnmeaſurable and vnſearchable to ſtande ſo contented, and to ſeeke no more, pardoning in his deare Ieſus, all imperfections, O my bleloued fathers, and brethren what ſoeuer that vouchſafe your eyes to reade theſe papers, let vs not deny him, what if he were not ſuch a God as he is, were not worth hauing when wee gaue it, namely our poore hearts, our weake loue, our harty obedience, our care and diligence to bee what with ſo many mighty mercies receiued we are bound to bee. For truely if giuing man muſt haue of all honeſt receiuers not the words onely of mouth, but the ſincere affection of the ſoule, our giuing God muſt haue the very ſoule of our ſoule and all that is within vs for his goodnes to vs. And bleſſed is that man and woman that loued of the Lord aboue all meaſure, by his giuen grace loue him againe in their meaſure as they can. Truely to ſuch ſhall be euen a continuance of mercy as ſhalbe good. For then ſhalt thou proſper,

                     Pſal. 84.11.
                   
                  yea I will mary thee vnto me, in righteouſnes, in iudgement, in mercy, &amp; compaſſion.
                  
                     Hoſe. 2.19 20.21.22.
                   
                  I will euen mary thee vnto me in faithfulnes, and thou ſhalt know the Lord, and I will heare the heauens, and they ſhall heare the earth, and the earth ſhall heare the corne, and the wyne, &amp; the oyle, and they ſhall heare Iſrael, &amp;c. But if proſperitie and the Lords bleſſings

haue not this effect in vs, then are they the Lordes gagers to diſcouer worſe matter than happely either the worlde or wee our ſelues did thinke before to bee in vs, or at leaſt ſo much to bee in vs, as pride, enuye, diſdayne, ſpite, malice, crueltie, vnthankefulnes, wantonnes, vncleannes, with a number ſuch. So that ſtill our groundworke ſtandeth faſt, that proſperitie is one of Gods temptations, that is one of Gods tryers and teachers of man what he is and will be that way.

Others in their tymes knewe it, and therefore wrote diuers thinges this way: Faelicitas &amp; moderatio diuiduum contubernium habent. Proſperitie and moderation dwell in two houſes. His meaning is, hardly they are founde dwelling together. Raro bona fortuna bonaque mēs homini datur. Seldome is good fortune (that is proſperitie) and a good heart giuen to a mā together. Magnae faelicitatis eſt a felicitate non vinci. It is a great felicitie not to be ouercome of felicitie. With a number ſuch like ſayings. Wherefore to go no further, we ſee how the Lord tempteth vs, trieth vs by proſperitie, to the diſcouering &amp; opening of our hidden ſecrets either good

or euil, and for the Lords ſake thinking ſeriouſly of it, let euery man and woman particularly view what breaketh out of them for al the mercies that are vpon them. And I ſay no more.

                     Chap. 3.10.
                   Againe, Becauſe thou haſt kept the word of my

patience, therefore I will deliuer thee from the houre of tentation, which will come vppon all the world, to trie them that are on the earth. Which places with many mo that might be alleaged, teach vs euidently, that thus the Lorde trieth his children, when it pleaſeth him, euen in the furnace of aduerſitie, cauſing them therby, not vnto him, who knoweth all things before, but vnto themſelues and the world, to diſcouer and open what before was not ſo knowne, namely, either patience or grudging againſt the Lords viſitation: as in examples plainly wee may ſee. Abraham wayted a long time for his wiſhed childe, and that delay of the Lords was his great triall. What opened it in Abraham, but a moſt ſingular faith, before not ſo well knowen to men,
                     Rom. 4.18.
                   that euen aboue hope hee beleeued vnder hope, that hee ſhould haue what was promiſed, &amp; not weake in faith, conſidered neither his own bodie, which was now dead, being almoſt an hundred yeres old, neither the deadnes of Saraes wōbe: but without doubting reſted fully aſſured, that what the Lord had ſayd he was able to do. Iacob
                  
wōderfully toſſed with the waues of much bitter aduerſitie by his wiues, by his children, by his friends, and euery day almoſt by one thing or other, yet euer ſhewed forth a patient hart, a beleeuing hart, and many great vertues, of all Gods children to bee many times thought of. And ſo was affliction a diſcouerer of his good graces to the praiſe of God the giuer, the true commendation of himſelfe the receiuer, and all our examples that conſider them. How did aduerſitie manifeſt in Ioſeph againe ye gifts of God? What a faith did affliction in her daughter bewray and lay open to all men in the woman of Canaan,
                  
                     Math. 15.
                   when the Lord Ieſus gaue this teſtimonie of her, O woman great is thy faith, be it vnto thee as thou wilt? So that you ſee where the Lord had wrought any good, there this trier and gager of the Lords aduerſitie opened it, and reueiled it to his glorie. Now looke at other ſome, and you ſhal ſee an other courſe or other effects of this temptation. The childrē of Iſraels caſe in Aegipt is knowne vnto vs, how greeuous and euen marueilous their bondage was, as alſo how the Lorde ſent Moſes and Aaron to deliuer

them. Who at their firſt comming were welcommed and reuerenced of all the Elders greatly, they then expecting by them a releaſe from thoſe woes.
                     Gen. 5.
                   But after a while when the King increaſed their affliction, and charged the taſkmaiſters to deliuer them no more ſtraw, and yet to require the whole number of bricke, vpon ſharpe puniſhment, if they performed it not, what then bewrayed this tryall in them? O ſee and conſider. They flye vpon the Lords Miniſters and meſſengers with an open mouth, with raging paſſions, &amp; the Lord looke vpon you, and iudge you, ſay they. For you haue made our ſauour ſtincke before Pharoh, and before his ſeruants, in that ye haue put a ſword in his hande to ſlay vs.
                  
                     Gen. 14. Chap. 15.24. Chap. 16.3.
                   When they were in feare of Pharaohs hoſt purſuing them after they were deliuered, they did the like: when they wanted water they did the like: when they wanted victuals they did the like, and their murmurings, grudgings, and curſed ſpeakings are euen fearefull when wee reade them. So that we ſée now in theſe how aduerſitie bewrayed corruption, incredulitie, impatiencie, and many foule faults, hidden

before from men, and happely euen from their owne eyes. The like might be ſhewed in many moe. Euen the Apoſtles themſelues declared their weakneſſe when they were thus tried by the apprehēſion of their maiſter and they fled away. Peter more than all the reſt, when a poore mayde made him denye, and euery queſtion redenye, and forſweare. Euery way therefore aduerſitie is a tell tale. And being ſent in the wiſedome of the mightie GOD to any man or woman with commiſſion to examine them and to diſcouer them, it doth in deede effectually, and quickly ſhewe what is within. If faith, patience, hope, humilitie, loue of God, and ſuch like vertues bee there, ſo he ſheweth by and by: and if not, ſo he ſheweth alſo without partialitie, and maketh euen a world often witneſſe of it.
                     Syrach. 27.5. Prou. 17.3.
                   Truely therefore, ſayth Ieſus Syrach, The fornace trieth the potters veſſell, and affliction trieth the iuſt and godly. And Salomon, as ſiluer and golde is tried by fire, ſo doth God proue and trie the harts of men. Your fathers (ſaith Iudith) were tempted, that they might bee tried and proued,

                  whether they truely from their heart worſhipped

GOD. The want of the true knowledge hereof maketh many haſtie Iudges &amp; iudgements in the worlde, men by and by entring into ſome euill conceipt of their eſtate with GOD, whom they ſee in this caſe.
               Truely it is too true.Eſay. 53.3.

                   For euen as the Prophet ſayth of the head, ſo is it found in the members, they are iudged as plagued and ſmitten of God, wee hide as it were our faces from them, they are deſpiſed and wee eſteeme them not.
               A very greeuous fault in whoſoeuer doe ſo, and checked with the practiſe euer of the liuing God vppon his children, and many ſweete and true comforts out of the worde. For, what ſonne is it, ſayth he,

                     Hebr. 12.5.
                   
                  My ſonne deſpiſe not the chaſtining of the Lord, neither faint when thou art rebuked of him. For whome the Lord loueth he chaſtineth, and hee ſcourgeth euery ſonne that hee receiueth.
                  
                     Iam. 1.12.
                   And Iames againe moſt comfortably: Bleſſed is the man that indureth temptation, for when he is tried he ſhall receiue the crowne of life which the Lorde hath promiſed to them that loue him.
                  
                     In the conference of fayth and frailtie.
                   But my purpoſe is not to enter into this common place now, I haue done it elſwhere, and there is ſcarce a leafe of the whole ſcripture that ſtayeth not our harts againſt this helliſh conceipt, that aduerſitie, affliction, and theſe croſſing tryalles, or trying croſſes ſhould import an angrie God towards vs euer. God forbid. The truth is otherwiſe, as I ſay.
               And I alſo very willingly confeſſe it. But yet giue mee leaue I pray you a little. This generalitie in my opiniō contenteth not euery man: for oftentimes

when a man confeſſeth the generall, namely, that the Lorde by aduerſitie proueth his children, yet fayleth he in the particular, &amp; looking at his owne eſtate entreth into ſome feare, yt yet not in ſuch &amp; ſuch a ſort hee dealeth with any but whō he hath caſt off. And therfore in my opinion it ſhould not bee amiſſe to deriue the generall into particulars, and to ſhewe ſome ſeuerall tryalls of this kinde, with their comfortes or examples out of the word of God.
               Let it be ſo ſince that contenteth you.
                     Afflictions inward or outward.
                   And then taking this courſe let vs remember that theſe things are eyther inward in the ſoule and conſcience, or outward in bodie, goods, children, friendes, fame, &amp; ſuch like. Of the inward ſpeaketh with no litle vehemencie Iob, when hee ſayth: The arrows of the almightie are in me,
                  
                     Iob. 6 4.
                   
                  the venome whereof doth drinke vp my ſpirite, and the terrours of God fight againſt me. For heereby hee declareth that hee was not onely afflicted in bodie, but wounded in conſcience, which is the greateſt battaile the faithful can haue. Now of

inward conflicts,
                     How to knowe our election if we be tempted with any doubt of it.
                   the greate maine one is, when a man or woman falleth into feare, and faintings concerning election, doubting in themſelues after ſome ſorte, leaſt they belong not thervnto, and therefore let vs make this our beginning, yet ſpeaking but briefly of it, becauſe many haue handled the point right well. Knowe wee then our comfort herein if the Lorde euer pleaſe to trie vs thus. Election is a thing reuealed by ſteps, and whoſoeuer wil ſurely and ſafely find it out muſt keepe the ſame. For as it were a madneſſe if I deſired to climb a ladder, to ſeeke to ſet my foote at firſt vppon the higheſt ſtep, ſo ſhall it be if I ſeeke out my election firſt before I looke vnto other things. And as there the higheſt ſtep is truly troad vppon at the laſt, if I begin at the loweſt, and ſo goe vpward: ſo is election certainly found if we keepe the like order. This ſpirituall ladder then ſtandeth thus. Whome the Lord electeth before all time, them doth he euer call in time, either at the morning, at the ninth houre, or eleuenth houre, or ſome houre. Then Whom he calleth,
                  
                     Election.
                   
                  them doth he iuſtifie, that is, whome hee effectually calleth

                  Whome he iuſtifieth them doth he ſanctifie, and whome hee ſanctifieth, them doth he glorifie.
                  
                     Vocation. Iuſtification. Santification.
                   So now then I would come to my election, and conſequently my glorification which is the higheſt ſtep, and is in heauen with GOD, then muſt I begin at the loweſt ſteppe, to wit. Sanctification, which is in my ſelf, and aſcend thus: If I be ſanctified, then iuſtified, if iuſtified, then called, if called, thē elected, and ſo ſure to be glorified. Our ſanctification euerie one of vs knoweth, feeleth, and findeth, &amp; how truly it carieth with it a note of Gods childe, choſen in time to inherite heauen. Marke the Scriptures. As the braunch (ſaith our Sauiour Chriſt) cannot beare fruit of it ſelfe,
                  
                     Ihon. 15.
                   
                  excepte it abide in the vine,
                  
                     4.
                   
                  no more can ye except ye abide in me. I am the vine, ye are the branches, he that abideth in me and I in him,
                  
                     5.
                   
                  the ſame bringeth foorth much fruite, for without me ye can doe nothing. Heere you ſee a coniunction comfortable, namely, of holy fruites and Chriſt, of fruitfull braunches and the vine, ſo that if the Lord haue wrought this bleſſed worke in vs, that we are dead to ſinne and aliue to righteouſnes,

then are we in him and he in vs, yea, euen ſo ſurely as it is certaine that the bearing bough is not brokē from the tree, which if it were, it could not beare. It is a meruaylous proofe to vs of this good, and therefore marke it well. The Apoſtle againe ſayth, There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Ieſus.
                  
                     Ro. 8.1.
                   Yea, but who bee thoſe? See what followeth. Which walke not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirite. So then if I would know whether I bee in Chriſt Ieſus or no, I muſt looke how I walke, that is, ſtill how I am ſanctified. And if I finde that the God of mercie by his perpetual ſpirit hath wrought in me a chaunge, that whereas once I walked after the fleſh, that is, was ruled, guided, and gouerned by my corrupt nature, now it is not ſo, but the holy Ghoſt leadeth me into a feruent loue of God, and a true hatred of euill, then is the concluſion inferred by the very ſpirit of truth himſelfe, I am in Chriſt Ieſus, and there is no condemnation to me, nor for me. So that Sanctification, the loweſt ſtep leadeth mée ſurely to election, the higheſt of the ladder. Giue rather diligence,
                  
                     2. Petr. 18.
                   ſayth Saint Peter,

my brethren, to make your calling and election ſure. Yea, but how (might they ſay) ſhal we do it? Peter telleth them, If yee doo theſe things you ſhall neuer fall. And what be thoſe things? Hee alſo ſheweth them, namely,
                     verſ. 5.
                   
                  If you ioyne vertue with your faith, and with vertue knowledge, and with knowledge temperance, and with temperance patience, with patience godlyneſſe, with godlyneſſe brotherly kindnes, and with brotherly kindnes loue, &amp;c. Now what is al this but ſanctification of life. So that ſtill our rule is proued, that if wee woulde know whether we be elected to liue in heauen, we muſt euer looke how we leade our liues in earth. And if there the Lorde hath chaunged vs from careleſſe to careful men and women, to pleaſe him in holyneſſe and righteouſneſſe all the daies of our life, then is this Sanctification a note of Iuſtification, Iuſtification of Vocation, Vocation of Election, and ſo heauen is ours. But now take heed that in this ſearch for holyneſſe of life, we bee not carryed away with outward ſhewes. For ſuch holyneſſe holdeth not either in promiſſes or concluſion

of our former argument. The Lorde abhorreth approching lippes and reproching hearts.

                     Note.
                   O beloued, conſider then of this earneſtly, and think with your ſelues, if there be no comfort to be had in our heartes that we are the Lordes, appointed to life and bliſſe in the worlde to come, but onely by a true eſpiall of ſanctification of life in our ſelues, how carefull

ſhould we bee by hearing of the worde, by praying, by reading, and by all appoynted good meanes to haue this change wrought in vs, that our light ſhining forth, may not onely make others glorifie our heauenlie Father for his graces in vs, but euen vnto our ſelues as Saint Peter ſayth:
                     2. Pet. 1.18. verſ. 18.
                   Make our election and future ſtate in the glorious kingdome of God ſure? Truly there ſhould be no cares greater than this, neyther anie diligence as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh more faythfull whileſt we liue. And ſee with your ſelues in your ſecrete meditations often, this difference of holyneſſe and vnholynes, of ſanctification and prophaneneſſe, the one proueth vnto me my euerlaſting ioy with GOD, when this courſe is ended, and the other my aſſured woe with the deuill and his Angels in the blackneſſe of darkneſſe for euer. O what are the pleaſures of ſinne then for a ſeaſon, when ſwéet meate ſhall haue ſo ſoure a ſauce? Could the Lord with a more pearcing argument pricke vs forwarde to holy life, or with a ſharper knife cut in ſunder the cords of vanitie, iniquitie, and ſinne, wherewith thouſandes of vs are ſo fettered and tempered,

than to teach vs that the one aſſureth vs of laſting life, and the other of laſting death in the world to come. Truly he could not. And therefore euerie one laie his hand vppon his ſoule betimes. Beleeue the Lorde and we ſhall not be confounded. Had I wiſt, ſayth the olde Prouerbe, commeth euer too late. Nowe liue like a Chriſtian amongſt men, and euer liue like a Saint among the Angels of heauen. For the Lord hath ſpoken it. But now ſoake in ſin with the bit in thy teeth vnreſtrainable, and then rot in the reward of it, an euerlaſting curſe from God and all his ioyes, for the Lorde hath alſo ſayd it. And if this ſanctification beloued, may not be in ſhew onely, as hath bene ſaid, but in truth and veritie, how deſperate, how woful, how wretched and miſerable is the eſtate of that man and woman, that hath not ſo much as a ſhew? If there bee no comfort gotte by a gliſtering outward appearaunce, what comfort may be in the ſoule, if the Lord awake to thinke of it, where euen this alſo vtterly wanteth, and the contrarie, to wit, all libertie, looſeneſſe, and ſinne aboundeth meruailouſlie? Shall we forget the curſe of our Sauiour

Chriſt in the Goſpell vppon the figge trée that yet had goodly leaues freſh &amp; greene, becauſe alſo with ye leaues it had no fruit. If ſo fearefull a curſe light vpon that, O curſes of curſes, how many of them ſhalbe vpon thoſe trees that haue not ſo much as leaues, no not one greene leafe, but are altogether withered, twice dead, and plucked vp by ye rootes. Wherfore I pray you euen again, as you loue your life wt god another day, &amp; deſire any aſſurāce of it to your ſoule in this worlde,
                     Ro. 12.1.
                   
                  Giue your bodies dayly a liuing ſacrifice, holy, &amp; acceptable vnto God, which is your reaſonable ſeruing of God.

                  And faſhion not your ſelues like vnto this world, but be you chaunged by the renuing of your minde, that you may proue what that good and acceptable, and perfect will of GOD is. And, Whatſoeuer things are true, whatſoeuer thinges are honeſt, whatſoeuer things are iuſt, whatſoeuer things are pure, whatſoeuer thinges are worthie loue, whatſoeuer things are of good report, if there be anie vertue, or if there be any praiſe, thinke of theſe things. For as you haue hearde and ſeene trulie

proued, theſe thinges ſhall aſſure vs, that we are the Lordes, cared for here, and choſen elſe where to be with him for euer and euer. And the want of this reformation preacheth nothing vnto vs, but that as yet we knowe no intereſt we haue to thoſe laſting ioyes, and that heauenly father. The Lord ſtrengthen vs, and the Lord change vs that we may be changed, Amen.
               
                  You ſay this Sanctification muſt bee true and right, or elſe it doth not proue vnto vs our election, I praie you therefore how may this be knowen, namely when it is true and right, and when not?
               
               
                  
                     Matter.
                  To knowe this we muſt euer looke at the matter and manner of our actions, whereby we worſhip God.
                     Manner.
                   For if either of theſe be wrong, then is it not that holines which the Lord alloweth. Concerning the matter, wee muſt looke that the thinges wherewith we ſerue God bee commanded of GOD, and not inuented and deuiſed by our ſelues or any man elſe.
                     Math. 15.9.
                   For, in vaine ſayth the Lorde Ieſus, doo you ſeeke to worſhippe mee, teaching for doctrines mens precepts. Which one thing ſticketh

to the verie hart a thouſand will worſhips in Poperie neuer commaunded of GOD, but brought in of ſinfull man for aduauntage ſake, as Maſſes, Pilgrimages, holie water, holy bread, cenſings, creepings, and ſuch lyke.
                     Manner.
                   Then though the matter bee good, yet if the manner be euill, wee fayle to pleaſe God. And therefore euen thoſe ſacrifices and ceremonies that the Lorde himſelfe ordayned, hee often teacheth hee doth abhorre, for want of a right maner of doing them. What haue I to doo (ſayth hee) with the multitude of your ſacrifices.

                     Math. 6.
                   
                  When you ſtretch out your handes I will hide mine eyes, and though you make many prayers, I will not heare. An example we ſee in the Scribes and Phareſies almes, and long prayers reiected. Alaſſe Lorde, and why ſo, might the Iewes ſaie. Surely would he anſwere, becauſe though you doe theſe things rightly in reſpect of matter,

becauſe I commaunded them, yet doe you not rightly in reſpect of maner, &amp; that alſo I ſeeke of all men.
               I pray you then what is the right manner that God alloweth.
               This muſt wée learne by diligent hearing and reading of the word. For therein hath the Lorde layde downe both what we ſhall doe, and how we ſhall doe. Generally thus much nowe conſider and take with you,
                     Hebr. 11.6.
                   that without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, and therefore concerning manner, no action can pleaſe GOD, though it were neuer ſo glorious, except it proceed frō an hart purified by faith. Cain and Abel offered both ſacrifices, the one pleaſed, the other not. And why? But for this thing, becauſe Abel had true faith in his hart, from whence that action flowed: and Cain had none but onely did the outward worke for faſhion ſake and order. So thouſands mo then in thoſe daies, and now in ours, that one day ſhall knowe with wo what it is to haue outward ſhew without inward faith. Then is it required concerning maner, that all our works be done in humilitie and lowlineſſe of minde, we euer

confeſſing truly, that we notwithſtanding all our workes are vnprofitable ſeruants. The want of this made the Phareſies actions abhorred,
                     Luke. 17.10.
                   which otherwiſe in reſpect of matter were well. For who doth not acknowledge yt not to be an extortioner,
                     Luc. 18.11.
                   vniuſt, an adulterer, to faſt, to giue tithe truly of all we haue, are good things, but to doe theſe in pride and conceit, with boaſting and bragging, and without humilitie, alas the Lord abhorreth it, and ſendeth vs away like proud praters, not like Chriſtian praiers to his heauenly maieſtie. Thirdly, it is required that we haue hope. For although we ought to be humble, yet not ſo throwen downe muſt we be, but that ſtill we reſt aſſured of acceptāce with God for Chriſt, although not for the worthyneſſe of our worke: and in that hope offer cheerefullie our obedience to the Lord. Thus teacheth Peter when he ſayth:
                     1. Pet 2.5.
                   
                  Yee alſo as liuely ſons be made a ſpiritual houſe, an holy Prieſthod, to offer vp ſpiritual ſacrifices acceptable to God by Ieſus Chriſte. Marke theſe words (acceptable to God by Ieſus Chriſt) vpon which words our hope is euer ſurely built, which nowe I ſpeake

of. Fourthly our actions muſt bee done in loue both to God and man. For if we could ſpeake with tongues of men and Angels, if we haue no loue we are but as ſounding braſſe, and tinckling Cymballes. Yea though wee feede the poore with all our goods and giue our bodies to bee burned, hauing no loue, it ſhall profit vs nothing. Laſtly, all our works words and thoughts ſhould reſpect the Lords glory, and not our owne. For if wee do any thing to bee ſeene of men, verely ſayth our Sauiour they haue their reward.
                  
                     Math. 6.5.
                   And thus doe you ſee nowe which is true ſanctification and holynes of life, ſuch as will truely moue to vs our election and future glorification with Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt in the kingdome of heauen. Euen woordes, deedes, and ſecret thoughtes thus warranted both for matter and manner as hath bene ſhewed. Thinke of theſe rules and examine your ſelues by them.
               My heart conſenteth to all theſe properties of a true Sanctification, and right obedience, but yet giue mee leaue to queſtion for my moſt comfort. What now if theſe things be in

a man or a woman with great imperfection, ſhall therefore their woorke be reiected, and yeld no comfort cō
                  cerning their election?
               God forbid. And therefore thus much take with you further yt exerciſing your ſelf in things commanded, &amp; doing thē in this maner as hath bene ſayd, ſo nere as ye Lord inableth you, wreſtling according to ye meaſure of your fayth euery day to bee leſſe ſinfull and more righteous, though yt perfect righteouſnes which ye law requireth be not found in you by reaſon of your weakenes, yet are you counted in the ſight of GOD Sanctified, holy and acceptable in Chriſt Ieſus, and ſo Sealed vp to the day of redemption. And that I may not ſay it to you, but proue it, conſider I pray you the example of S. Paul himſelfe, who though hee were ſo ſanctified and borne a newe as that thereupon hee might ſafely and ſurely conclude his election for euer, to inherite heauen by Chriſt, yet felt he and found hee very many imperfections in himſelfe, and ſayth playnely:
                     Rom. 7.15.
                   
                  I alow not that which I do. For what I would, that do I not, but what I hate that doe I. Againe when I

would do good, I am thus yoked, that euill is preſent with me. Againe, In my minde I ſerue the lawe of God, but in my fleſh the lawe of ſinne. O wretched man that I am therfore, who ſhall deliuer me from the body of his death: with ſundry other ſpeeches to the ſame ende in that place. Whereby I ſay wee are playnely taught that humane imperfection is farre from prouing any thing againſt our true ſanctification. Yea this is the true perfection of of them that are borne anewe, to confeſſe with the Apoſtle that they are imperfect. And to our great comfort let vs note it, that this Apoſtle, ſanctified thus imperfectly, &amp; groning vnder the griefe of ſundry wants and weakeneſſes, yet ſo aſſured himſelfe of his election, by ſo much as hee had, that in the next chapter he is not afrayd to breake out thus, I am perſwaded that neither death nor life,
                  
                     Ro. 8.38.
                   
                  Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor thinges preſent, nor thinges to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature ſhall bee able to ſeparate vs from the loue of God which is in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord. See then, and neuer forget it, that ſanctification

though but in part and with much want, yet is accepted with God &amp; man, and ought yeld that man and woman that hath it ſuch a comfortable perſwaſion as this, namely, that nothing ſhall be able to ſeparate them from their God. So that they be not negligent in harty hungring ſtill after more. Which euer is to be ſearched for carefully in our ſelues. For euen ſo did this Apoſtle if you marke it. I delight ſayth he, in the lawe of God concerning the inner man.
                  
                     verſ. 22.
                   And as long as he found ſome meaſure of grace, and an heart that ſtill wiſhed more, and ſighed for more, and delighted in good, ſo long was hee cheerefull touching his eſtate with God,
                     verſ. 23.
                   albeit till his dying day he ſawe another lawe in his members rebelling againſt the lawe of his minde, and leading him captiue to the law of ſinne, which was in his members. This example then is notable to this end, and let vs not forget it. Would God alſo the contrarie were more earneſtly conſidered than it is, namely, that if ſome meaſure of holy conuerſation, together with a mind moſt feruently wiſhing more, and euen grieued for want of more, yeld mēs ſoules

comfort, that neyther lyfe nor death, nor anie thing ſhall ſeparate thē from the Lord, what will, neither any meaſure at all, neyther any deſire of any, nor anie griefe for want of any, or for huge flouds of vngodlyneſſe that ouerflowe vs both bodie and ſoule, our words, our works, our thoughts or lookes, and all things wee doe: I ſaie what will this yeelde to the conſcience one daie, but euen a dreadfull blow, that as the other neuer, ſo we euer are appoynted and red to be ſeparate from Chriſt Ieſus. O then take heede betimes, and cutting off euery day by the ſwoorde of Gods giuen grace, iniquitie, and ſinne, lette vs hunger and thirſt to ſerue GOD in holyneſſe and righteouſneſſe before him all the dayes of our lyfe, and by fruites of a true new birth to make, as Saint Peter hath tolde vs, our election ſure.
                  
                     2. Cor. 12.
                   Another proofe to your queſtion, that imperfections in our newe birth and ſanctificatiō may not diſcourage vs, is the ſame Apoſtle againe, troubled in another place ſo grieuouſly with his owne concupiſcence that pricked in the fleſhe the meſſenger of Satan, that he beſought the Lorde thrice that it might departe from

him. The Lordes aunſwere as we know was this, that his grace was ſufficient for him. For through weakneſſe his power was made perfect. Playnly teaching vs &amp; graciouſly chéering vs, that for our imperfections he will not reiect vs. It is one thing to haue ſinne raigning in vs, and an other thing to haue it dwelling in vs. The one we are forbidden, the other we ſhall be ſubiect to whileſt wee liue. For,
                     Rom. 6.12. Rom. 7.18.
                   
                  I knowe that in mee, that is, in my fleſh dwelleth no good thing, confeſſing with griefe that ſinne dwelleth in him, though to his comfort, through grace it raigned not in him. Full is the Scripture of ſtrength agaynſt this feare of imperfections, but I truſt this ſufficeth.
O, but the children of God are ſubiect many times to ſuch a dulneſſe and deadneſſe in compariſon of ſweete rauiſhing motions that they haue felt, that Satan catching and watching his opportunities is readie to perſwade that ſurely nowe they are fallen away, and GOD hath giuen them ouer.
Moſt true it is, and yet all for the beſt.

For ſurely, if we had not ſuch alterations and chaunges, we ſhould thinke that grace were nature in vs, wee ſhould not eſtéeme of that ſweete power of the ſpirite as wee doe, when after a dulneſſe it returneth agayne, neyther any way bee thankfull as now we are. But to be too much caſt down with ſuch tumblings, &amp; to enter into ſuch deſperate feares, truly the Lord woulde it not.
                     Pſal. 51.
                   For what change thinke you felt Dauid when hee cryed, O let mee feele the comfort of thy ſpirite agayne, and when ſo often he cryeth,
                     119.
                   
                  O quicken me as thou waſt wont, quicken mee, quicken me. Yet was not Dauid caſt awaie, though for his ſinne or tryall, or Gods glorie, or others example, hee was thus many times troubled by a grieuous dulneſſe &amp; many tempting feares. Alaſſe it is the courſe we muſt euer account of, for our better wakening, and which Gods choſen haue euer taſted yet without reiection. The mother after ſhe hath felte her childe moue, hopeth the beſt, though euer it moue not, and when weakly it ſtirreth, ſhee cheerefully hopeth of greater ſtrength in time, &amp; ſo muſt wee. This ſweete ſpirite is not alwayes alike,

that difference may teach vs, it is greate mercie to haue much, and make vs thankfull. The Sunne ſhining ſo fayre is often couered with miſtie cloudes from vs, yea, and euerie daie ſetteth, and as it were taketh his leaue. But wee ſée thoſe cloudes vaniſh awaie in time, and the cheerefull riſing followeth after his heauie ſetting. It is not euer Winter, nor euer Summer, but after a fayre daie commeth a foule, and backe agayne. The tree is not alwayes greene and flouriſhing with his cheerefull leaues. Yet liueth it in the root when outward ſhew is gone. And truly ſo doe wee, (let vs in comfort knowe it) in our Chriſt rooted remayne aliue ſafe and ſure, when bluſtering ſtormes of ſhrewd temptations haue ſhaken off our leaues, that is, our cheerefull thoughtes, wordes, and countenaunces, and for our better ſchooling, the Lord a litle hath left vs to our ſelues. The foundation of our hope ſtandeth faſt, whō he loueth, to the end he loueth them. And I am perſwaded that hee that hath begun this good worke in you,
                  
                     Iohn. 13.1. Philip. 1.6. Ro. 11.29.
                   
                  will perfourme it vntil the daie of Ieſus Chriſt. For the giftes and calling of GOD are

without repentaunce, with a number of ſuch. So that though the ſadneſſe of ſoule come vpon vs, and great diſquietneſſe bee within our breaſt, yet muſt we lyke faythfull children as the Lorde ſhall inable, ſaie, Still truſt in God my ſoule, for I will yet giue him thankes,
                  
                     Pſal. 42.
                   &amp;c. O tarrie thou the Lordes leaſure, bee ſtrong, and hee ſhall comfort thy heart, and put thou thy truſt in the Lord. Many times reade that 77. Pſalme,
                     Pſal. 27.
                   &amp; ſee the downe falls of Gods children, and how agayne they catch hold and ſcramble vp, confeſſing it to bee their infirmitie, as in deede it is. And the Lord of comfort worke our comfort.
               
                  Will God then accept ſome obedience?
               
               Yet again do you aſke mee that? Was it not proued euen now that ſanctification with imperfection, is neuertheleſſe true ſanctification and accepted. But you ſhew a paſſion ſtill following the godly minde, that what it wiſheth to haue, it feareth to want, and therefore neuer is wearie of proofe to haue what heart deſireth. Therfore euen agayne I aunſwere you that hée doth. And be iudge your ſelf. Whē the Father

cried wt wéeping eyes, Lord I beleue,
                  
                     Marc. 9.24.
                   
                  helpe my beleefe. Did the Lord anſwer him roughly, ſirra, I accept no imperfecte faith. No, no, he moſt gratiouſly accepted his ſome faith, and helped his childe.
                     1. King. 15.13
                   Doe we not reade it to our great comfort what the Lorde badde the Prophet aunſwere to Ieroboams wife, that came diſguiſed to aſke concerning her ſicke ſonne, namelie, that he onely of Ieroboam ſhould come to the graue, becauſe in him there was ſome goodneſſe toward the Lorde of God of Iſrael? Therefore euen ſome goodneſſe, ſome grace, ſome faith, ſome loue,
                     Sweete.
                   ſome obedience you ſee is not ouerlooked of our moſt mercifull father, though it be but little. For it is not the quantitie but the qualitie, that is, not how much, but how true,
                     Note.
                   that the Lorde regardeth. All thoſe eies that looked vpon the braſen Serpent were not alyke great, and yet the leaſt eie receyued health by that looking. So are not all mens faith alike. For the Lorde giueth at his owne good pleaſure in greate diuerſitie, and yet the leaſt being true looketh vppon the true ſalue of our ſtings reſembled by the braſen Serpent Chriſt Ieſus to eeternall

life, as wel as ye greateſt. Though our father chidde them for their little faith, yet did he neuer reiect them that had anie. Euery poore beggars hand is not alike, and yet the leaſt ſerueth him to take a penie as well as the greateſt. So ſhall our hande of faith do I warrant you, and therfore reach it out with cheere, feare not.
               And what if euen in that little obedience there be alſo ſome imperfection mingled?
               Bee it neuer ſo little, if it come from vs, be you ſure it will haue his dregs and impuritie. For euen all our righteouſneſſe is lyke a ſtayned cloth. But what then? O ſweete God. What did he when the midwiues with a good action intermingled a lie? Did hee refuſe their good for their euill? No, no, hee receiued their obedience though thus ſtayned, and mercifully hee turned away his face from the other, as a deere father, that hath an Eagles eie to ſpy any thing well in his child, and euen no eie to ſee what hee woulde not ſee, beeing the frailties of his choſen children, whereof they ſigh to bee diſburthened. And it is a heaten truth and knowen to vs, that if hee

looked not awaie from imperfections and wrath, yea, euen winowed as it were his childrens actions, keeping the grayne, and blowing awaye the chaffe with a breath of mercie in Chriſt, hee ſhoulde neuer accept any obedience in this world at anie mans hand.
               Alaſſe then why ſhould wee feare ſo often and much as we doo, and faint, ſince all things are thus comfortable to the Lords children?
               O ſir,
                     Iere. 4.4.
                   theſe feares and wreaſtlings and ſpirituall ſtruglings that the godly are euer ſubiect vnto, are as the Lordes plowe to breake vp the fallowe grounde of our heartes, and to teare them that otherwiſe would bee whole lumpes, vnfit to receyue ſeede into fine ſmall earth, ſofte, and mellowe, and fruitfull, that no ſooner the ſeede may be throwē in, but it ſinketh &amp; is couered, and ſetteth it ſelfe to fructifie, when otherwiſe it would not, nor could not vpon whole ground, but lying onely vppon the outwarde face, and not ſinking, the foules would deuour it,
                     Math. 13.4.
                   or at leaſt it take no rooting. And therefore thrice neceſſarie and profitable are theſe ſpirituall buffets nowe

and then to worke in vs that broken and contrite heart which the Lorde ſhall neuer deſpiſe.

Let them bee then as the Lorde pleaſeth, eſpeally when hee hath giuen vs ſo ſweete a promiſe, that hee will neuer lay more vpon vs than hee will make able to beare. Lette him plowe vs, and bruſe vs, and breake vs at his pleaſure, it is the Lord, lette him doe what ſeemeth him beſt, hee knoweth our mould, and his mercie helpe vs in all our feares, Amen.
               And Amen ſaie I againe to this prayer, leauing you now to your libertie to go forwards with other temptations as you will.
               
                  
                     Not to haue our prayer heard by and by.
                  It is a ſpirituall tryall many tymes to Gods children to crie and pray, and as they thinke, not to be heard, becauſe their petitions are not by and by graunted. But they forget then other deere ones of the Lord and the Lords often practiſe. For Dauid in many Pſalmes ſayth, I crye and thou heareſt not. Iob ſayth, When I cry vnto thee thou doeſt not heare mee,

But good beloued let vs bee wiſe as the Lorde would haue vs, and that is thus, not to meditate of ſinne, but ſtill with an eye to the ſalue of ſinne Chriſt Ieſus, and then though it be neuer ſo terrible by his foule ſhape, &amp; ſeeme neuer ſo ſtrong to giue vs a fearefull fall, yet ſhall it bee founde too weake, and wee receiue after a mazing feare, true comfort agaynſt it, and the deadly ſting thereof.

Dauids adulterie and murder were great ſinnes, yet repentance found mercie, and they were pardoned. Peters denyals were great ſinnes, yet in Chriſt raſed out, when he wept bitterly for them. Paules perſecuting and making hauocke of the congregation was no ſmal offence, yet a wounded hart found a forgiuing God, when opened eyes ſawe what was done.
                     Exod. 17.
                   Thoſe murmuring Iewes after ſo many ſtrange workes and wonders wrought of the Lord for their deliuerance, making a queſtion whether he were amongſt them or no, did they lightly offend? Or doth not the Scripture euery where ſpeake of it as a moſt horrible and dreadfull offence? Yet was there mercie with God and pardon to repentance. But this courſe might bee long if I ſhould note all particulars. Let vs ſtay therefore with thoſe murdring Iewes, not of a malefactor but of a iuſt one, not of the ſonne of a man,

but of the ſonne of God Chriſt Ieſus, and conſider well whether the earth hath yeelded ſince her firſt creation a greater indignitie, or whether the heauens haue behelde a more vggly tranſgreſſion? Surely no: neither any whit comparable:
                     Act. 2. and 3.
                   yet in Chriſt was this pardonable, and euen then when their handes were red with the innocent bloud of Chriſt Ieſus, &amp; the ſpeare ſcarſe waſhed that pearced his holy heart, euen then I ſay, preached Peter pardon to repentance, and as many as repented had mercie. To the greatneſſe of their ſinne adde the vnfeelingneſſe of their heart that had no remorſe for any thing they had done. And then conſider, will the Lord offer mercie before it be ſought, and ſhut vp mercie when it is ſought? Will he ſo graciouſly ſeeke to drawe men to repentance, and ſhewe no pitie when we repent? Will the Lorde forgiue the death of his deere ſonne to the bloudie murderers of him, and neuer be intreated for ſinnes (though greeuous) yet not comparable. O God forbid that after this example of mercie to theſe crucifiers of the Sonne of GOD, Satan ſhould euer ſhake our faith by feare of any

ſinne to be vnpardonable, which with wai

                  ing harts wee lament that euer wee committed agaynſt our deare God. Therefore take faſt holde of it, and print it deepely in your memorie. I omit Iacobs children, I omit Manaſſes, I omit many that might be named, peruſe their ſinnes, and beholde with ioye in a gracious God their full remiſſion. When the Spirit of truth ſayth, were thy ſinnes as red as ſcarlet, doth he meane to comfort agaynſt ſmall and fewe offences, or againſt great and many? Truly euen againſt all, muſt you needes confeſſe. And if you will not, S. Iohn will reprooue you, who ſayth,
                     1. Iohn. 1.
                   
                  that bloud ſhall cleanſe vs from all ſinne, making no diſtinction of fewe or many, great or little. Some, not all. And if the Lord diſtinguiſh not, that muſt ſhewe mee mercie, I defie a diſtinguiſhing deuill, of whom I ſeeke no mercie. Conſider it often, that the ſame Apoſtle ſaith,
                     1 Iohn. 1.
                   
                  If we acknowledge our ſinne God is faithfull to forgiue vs. Making the aſſurance of pardon to a confeſſing ſinner, no leſſe ſure than it is that GOD is faithfull. O beloued, can God bee vnfaithfull? if he can, then feare: if not, be of good

comfort, for ſo certaine is mercie to a bleeding hart, as he is faithfull that can bee no other. O ſweete foundation of our wiſhed ioy, the eſſence of our God. Agayne, is it not an article of our faith that our ſinnes ſhalbe pardoned?
                     Comfotable.
                   Will you ſay little ſins? God forbid, reſtrayne not Gods mercie, deny not your faith, and then muſt you bée comfortable. Remember agayne what the Lord Ieſus ſayth:
                     Ihon. 6.37.
                   
                  All that the Father giueth me ſhall come to me, and him that commeth to me I caſt not away. What a ſpeech is this, if wee marke it? And what a comfort and ioy is there in it, if wee haue but euen a peece of an heart to receiue it? For to let paſſe the former part, ſo plainly taking away diſtinction of Iewe or Gentill, of bond or free, in affirming that al that the father giueth him ſhall come to Chriſt, what nation or language ſoeuer they bée of, how ſweet is the ſecond part to a ſinfull ſoule groaning and ſighing vnder the burden of iniquitie, ſore laden and euen preſſed downe with thoughts, words, and deedes in the ſight of the Lorde damnable? For what might be your caſe, looke at your ſelf: Haue you read in the lawe, that if God enter

into iudgement with you, ſinne is ſo great, that you are but gone? Doe your tranſgreſſions pricke you, and looſe courſe of life begin to ſting you? What then? are you dead, and wil you not liue? are you ill, and will you be no better? Smarteth your ſoule within through the deepe wounde of ſinne, and will you haue no eaſe? O yes full faine, ſay you, but my ſinnes, my ſinnes are ſo out of meaſure, great and horrible, that I feare the Lord hath caſt me off, and hath no mercie for me? Ah deuell auant. Doth my Sauiour ſay here, he that commeth to me, and is not a very great ſinner, I caſt not away. No, no Satan, my God and Lord, my Chriſt and ioy ſpeaketh indefinitely of any man, of any woman, in any caſe, he that commeth vnto mee, bee he Iewe, be he Gentill, be he bond, be he frée, Greeke or Barbarian, and what ſinne or ſinnes ſo euer hee bee troubled for, how weake and fraile ſo euer, how poore &amp; vile ſo euer, yea be his ſinnes mo than ye heares of his head, mo than the ſand of the ſea, ſo that his heart fayle him with Dauid for them, yet if he come to him, he is welcome, he is accepted, and hee will not caſt him away.

O ſoule awake then, be of good cheare within me, caſt away the mourning wéede, and hearken to thy moſt gracious GOD, may you ſay. Sorrowing and ſighing for that which is paſt, as my duetie is to him will I go, knowing that he is the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for euer. His pitie decreaſeth not, his mercie fadeth not, others haue found it, and why ſhould I doubt of it? Neuer came ſinner with ſorrowe and faith but hee was accepted, and his owne mouth in this place ſayth it, No man that commeth to me will I caſt away. Nay ſee further comfort here by theſe wordes. Were it ſo that my heart were as it were cloſed vp for a time (the Lords will being in this ſort to exerciſe me, humble mée, and trie me) that I could not beléeue, nor pray, nor ſorrowe nor feele any comfort, yet if euer there was a time wherein I could doo theſe things, and did them in and with a feeling of ſweet aſſurance of Gods fauour in Chriſt to my poore ſoule, that time doth tell mee that the Father hath giuen me to Chriſt, and that I did come to him then, and nowe I heare that he that commeth to him hée caſteth not awaye neuer, neuer.

Therefore bee of good comfort, his ſpirite is not gone, it is but hidden, and with-held for a time, as fire couered with aſhes, it wil come agayne doubled and increaſed. For hee that is once giuen to Chriſte of his father is neuer caſt away finally, but reuiueth agayne though many times humbled very greatly for a ſeaſon.

                   You haue had examples before. And thus in the Lordes helpe and bleſſing may this aſſaulte of the greatneſſe of ſinne bee ſalued. Much and much agayn is the ſtrength in Gods word that may be brought to lay in this breache if I intended volumes. But by this example goe further your ſelfe as you neede. Theſe are large fields to walke in, bleſſed be God for his comforts.
               Sometimes agayne I know the Lord humbleth his deere ones with this cogitation beating in their inwards,

                   ſurely I ſhal not continue, I ſhall haue a fall, I do but flatter my ſelfe with a perſwaſion of Gods fauour. For albeit I nowe doe well, heare the word, read it, pray, and ſo forth, yet in deede I am not ſetled and grounded in the feare of God, for theſe things will away. Many haue had as much as I for a tyme,

and yet haue fallen away, and ſo I feare me ſhall I. Truely a dangerous temptation,

                     Pſal. 51.
                   
                  Lord increaſe our fayth, and that of Dauid, giue mee the comfort of thy helpe and eſtabliſh me, eſtabliſh me with thy ſpirit Then thoſe places following with ſuch like which you may find by your owne reading, and partly haue bene quoted before, when this temptation almoſt was in ſpeech.
                     Philip. 1.
                   
                  I am perſwaded ſayth the Apoſtle of this ſame thing, that hee that hath begun this good woorke in you will perfourme it vntil the day of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Cōſider wel of the place, and of the Spirit that directed Paul
to ſay it, the ſpirite of God, and ſee what a powrefull comfort this may bee, that that Spirit ſhould ſet it downe, that where the graces of God and fruites of righteouſnes once appeare in truth, that is, without fayning in man or woman, there is an immoueable aſſurance of continuance in the ſame, the meanes being vſed. Why ſhould

we rather then beleeue the father of lyes, ſaying we ſhall continue? Or why ſhoulde we more bee throwne downe with the one than lifted vp with the other? Yet ſee more comfort. For what newe thing is ſpoken here that is not often beat vpon elſewhere alſo.
                     1. Sam. 18.17.
                   When Saul told Dauid hee was but a boye and therefore not able, or meete to ioyne with that great Goliah ſo ſtrong a giant, howe did hee ouerthrowe this bone caſt againſt his fayth, and eſtabliſh his hart againſt that temptation: was not his ſtrength this? I haue O King found God heretofore my deliuerer, when I was in danger, and therefore I doubt him not but he will euen nowe alſo be to me as he hath bene. And what if Satan ſhould haue whiſpered in his eare, Dauid thou deceiueſt thy ſelf by thinking that if God once do for thee, he will euer do for thee, it is no good argument. Would Dauid haue beleeued him?
                     1. Sam. 17.3
                           •
                        .
                   No out of doubt hee woulde haue bidden him, auant Satan, my argument is good. For a very chiefe ende of Gods benefites to man is to make him ſtill in aſſured truſt to hang vppon his gouernement and prouidence. And therefore

as I haue founde him, ſo will I take him, my deliuerer hath he bene from the Beare and the Lion, and my deliuerer will he be, I feare not, from this vncircumciſed Philiſtine. Againe when the Apoſtles began to thinke that Chriſt was angry becauſe they had forgotten to bring bread with thē,
                     Math. 16.
                   what ſayth Chriſt. O ye of litle fayth do ye not remember the fiue loaues when there were 5000. men, howe many baſkets full tooke ye vp? teaching them and al the world that the conſideratiō of Gods goodnes already ſhewed ſhoulde mightily aſſure vs for the time to come euer. For as he hath bene, ſo will hee be, if wee beléeue him. This was one cauſe alſo why hee inſtituted the Sacrament of his Supper to keepe his former goodnes in continual remembrance with vs, Becauſe that ſuch remembrance is &amp; ought to be moſt effectual euer to eſtabliſh our fayth as touching the continuance of his fauour towards vs ſtill. Marke therfore &amp; meditate of this drift of the Lord often, and think with your ſelfe yt if a mortal man looke for his benefits, that I ſhould accompt him not my fickle, but my firme friend, that as he hath bene, ſo he

wil be, O how much more may the God of heauen looke for it at my handes, and if my doubting of an earthly friends conſtancie, who hath by many teſtimonies giuen me notice of his loue be in trueth a foule fault in me, how infecteth it heauen &amp; earth with noiſome ſauour to miſtruſt a mighty God, nay a merciful God, a kinde God, &amp; deare &amp; louing father, that with milions of mercies teſtified his loue and fauour without deſert in me, and to make him as a fickle &amp; changing man: farre be it therfore from vs euer, but let paſſed grace aſſure our ſoules of future goodnes, for ſo would he haue it, &amp; ſo in truth ſhould it. I cannot omit it,
                     Pſal. 78.11.
                   &amp; I pray you marke it with me: How whē 
                  Dauid ſheweth yt the Iſraelites forſooke God and his wayes, he addeth for a reaſon as it were of ſuch a fall, They forgat his actes and his wonderfull workes that he had ſhewed them. As if hee ſhould haue ſayde, had they looked backe ſtil to receiued mercy, and kept that diligently in minde they would neuer haue fallen. Nowe this could bee no reaſon if this were not a certaine courſe with our liuing God, that where he beginneth there he continueth, if the fault

be not ours. Looke therefore at this thing, and be of good comfort,
                     Ezek. 18.23. Ihon. 13.1. Rom. 11.
                   your God hath no ioy in changing, he hath ſworne hee would not our fall, his worde is paſt, that whome he loueth to the end he loueth them, that his gifts and calling are without repentance, that is without change, Dauid thus reaſoned, Paul thus reaſoned, Chriſt thus reaſoned, that paſſed mercy ſhould aſſure vs future mercy euer, and therfore you ſhal continue if you continue to pray, to beleeue, to obey and to ſerue him. Let all the feends in hell goe ſhake their eares. Humblings are good for the Lords choſen, and he knoweth what is beſt for euery ſonne or daughter.
                     Iam. 1.12.
                   Welcome his ſchoolings when he ſendeth them, indure them patiently, tary the Lordes leaſure, for your lightning. Yet euer know his word what it aſſureth: Hee that commeth vnto mee I neuer caſt away, the Lord ſupport our weaknes. Thus might I in this treatiſe of inward aduerſities, touches &amp; trials run a great courſe, for the field is wonderful wide, but I muſt content my ſelfe. Theſe may ſerue to ſhew that the worde is a ſalue for our grieuous ſores, and to lead ſuch as ſhall be deſirous

of further Phiſike into the greene paſtures where is plentie of helpe. Sée and gather, apply, and vſe, the Lord will bleſſe his holy ordinance euer as ſhalbe beſt.
               Your order leadeth you next to particular aduerſities outward.
               And if I or any man ſhoulde ſpeake of them as we might, when or where ſhould we find an end?
                     Pſal. 34.
                   For howe many are the troubles of the righteous? Yet the Lord deliuereth them out of all. For myne owne part I haue found in two righteous men ſo much as iuſtly maketh me to thinke that the troubles of all Gods children bee in déed very many. I meane Iob &amp; Dauid, whoſe troubles and tryals if they be peruſed, carefully obſerued, and often thought vppon, they may ſtrengthen and comfort moſt men euen in their particulars. For what might it be that the Lord layeth vpon vs which he layed not vpon theſe his deere ones before, and may be found in them, beſides numbers mo, both in Scripture and other hiſtories recorded to vs. Many will ſay, O my life is vncomfortable and full of ſorrow and heauines, griefe and vexation one after an other. When as others haue

their pleaſures and heartes eaſe and more ioy in a day than I haue in a yeere. And what if it pleaſe God ſo, doth hee deale any otherwiſe with you than he doth with thoſe whome hee loueth truely,
                     Ioh. 30.16.
                   and euen to the ende? doeth not Iob complayne that his ſoule was euen powred out vpon him, and the dayes of affliction had taken holde of him. That ſorowe pearced his very bones in the night, and his ſinewes tooke no reſt, that for the great vehemency his very garmēt was changed &amp;c.
                     verſ. 31.
                   That his harpe was turned to mourning, and his Organs into the voyce of them that wept. Yet I hope you know God hated not his ſeruant Iob for all this.
                     Pſal. 102.
                   I pray you alſo remember Dauid with heauy heart and mournfull voyce making his mone to his ſweeteſt God in theſe words: O Lord heare my prayer, &amp; let my cry come vnto thee. Hide not thy face from mee in the tyme of my trouble, incline thine eares vnto mee when I cal, make haſt to heare me. Why Dauid, what is the matter, or what doeth vrge this wofull crye? O Lorde my dayes are conſumed like ſmoke &amp; my bones are burnt like an hearth. Myne heart is

ſmitten and withereth like graſſe, becauſe I forget to eate my bread, for the voyce of my groning my bones doe cleaue to my ſkin. Surely I haue eaten aſhes as breade and haue mingled my drinke with weeping. And ſo forth,
                     verſ. 9.
                   reade more of the Pſalme your ſelfe. And remē
                  ber euer Dauid was a man according to Gods own hart, for al this humiliatiō layd vppon him at tymes. Forget it not alſo when you ſit, and ſay litle, what was anſwered to that pamperling of the worlde, when he was in it. Sonne remember that thou in thy life time receyuedſt thy pleaſures, and likewiſe Lazarus paynes,
                  
                     Luc. 16.25.
                   
                  nowe therefore is hee comforted and thou art tormented. It is not the beſt meat euer that hath ſo ſowre a ſawce commonly.

                   what ſweeter ſpeech can my ſoule wiſh to

bee my comfort, if my life bee not ſo comfortable. Had I rather nowe laugh &amp; hereafter weepe, then nowe weepe &amp; hereafter laugh, not for dayes or yeeres, but for euer and euer. I will let the Phiſition of my body a ſinfull man mingle my cup as beſt pleaſeth him,
                     Note.
                   for my health, and drink that ſowre ſup in hope of eaſe thereafter, but my God and father, my Chriſt and Sauiuiour, the life of my ſoule, ſhall not doe ſo for the good thereof, but full wantonly I will make my choyſe my ſelfe, and ſweete, ſweete all muſt bee, or elſe I will weepe to drinke it,
                     Math. 20.22.
                   Alas this is not well. Be it vnto vs as he will. And great is his fauour euer when wee drinke of no worſe cup than his owne ſelfe hath begun of to vs.
                     Iob. 21.
                   If you read the 21. of Iob you ſhall ſee yt this floriſhing eſtate in this world that ſo many wiſh, and ſome in weakenes and ignorance wayle to want, is not ſo comfortable to the conſcience deſiring hope of future good, as that we ſhould be ſo greedy of it. And therefore if the Lord deale otherwiſe with vs, reſt vppon his wiſedome, vpon his loue, teſtified by the greateſt gift that euer was giuen, the death of his onely and deare Sonne

Chriſt Ieſus, vppon his practiſe with his children euer, and be content. Chriſt dipped the ſoppe that he gaue to Iudas, and did  loue him therefore.
                     Reuel. 3.
                   God giue vs dry breade with his fauour, rather then dipped, and daintie ſoppes with his yre. As many as hee loueth, he rebuketh and chaſtiſeth, and loued Lazarus had neuer a ſop at all, but would haue bene glad of the crummes that fell from the rich mans table.
                     Contempt a bitter temptation.
                   Some againe are diſdayned &amp; contemned in their places where they liue, dwell, or ſerue, and they cannot beare it. Contempt is bitter, and ſoking themſelues in this ſowre meditation, they thinke, O Lord why ſhoulde I be thus vſed more than others? what do I, or ſay I, that ought not, or might not receiue as fauorable face as other men find? ſurely the Lord loueth me not &amp;c. But god forbid ſay I to this concluſion. For it followeth not vpon the premiſſes, and therefore the argument a ſubtill deuils, and not a true Gods. And I prooue it to my comfort by theſe two ſeruants of God agayne Iob and Dauid. The firſt complayning that they that were yonger than hee mocked him,
                     Iob. 30.1.9. Iob. 19.18.
                   yea they whoſe fathers he refuſed

to ſet with the dogges of his flockes,
                     verſ. 10. Iob. 7.6.
                   that is to bee his ſhepheardes, or to keepe his dogges. They abhorred him, fled far from him, and ſpared not to ſpit in his face. Yea ſayth he I am their byword, and as it were a Tabret before them. Surely a great contempt, and greater I thinke than you can ſhewe me any, whoſoeuer you are that cō
                  playne of contempt, and yet Iob was Iob ſtill before his God for all theſe abuſes in a wretched world, that is, beloued, accepted, regarded, and in the end, when the Lordes good pleaſure was finiſhed, honoured and exalted, that theſe mocking mates couched and hid their foule faces for ſhame. And ſhall I not intreate you to conſider it? Againe the other, what ſayth hee. I am a worme and no man, O Lorde, a ſhame of men, and the contempt of the people.

                  Al they that ſee me haue mee in deriſion, they make a mowe at mee and nod their heads. What vile contempt is this. Yet muſt not Dauid giue vp the ioy of his life for it. But paſſe on his courſe in his troubleſome Sea, and ſayle cheerfully towards the Hauen where hee would bee, breaking theſe waues and ſurges by a true

fayth &amp; knowledge of the Lords dealings with his moſt deere choſen. Imagine you ſee Herod, and that ruſhing route,
                     Luc. 22.11.
                   hoyſing their heades like forehorſes ouer our deere Sauiour, when Pilate ſent him thither and looking ouer him, and vnder him, and on eche ſide him, but not vppon him, for feare his baſenes ſhould hurt their ſiluer ſights. O deere Sauiour, ſhall he bee contemned, and diſdayned, excepted, and reiected as a ſeely man, a ſimple man, one that hath no great ſtuffe in him to win him grace with the paynted Peacocks of this worlde, and ſhall any man or woman take it to hart to folow him with this croſſe (if it be a croſſe and not rather a true and great bleſſing in ſome reſpects to vs) vpon his backe? Fie, fie of this deſire to pleaſe men ouermuch in this world, it is not good. Thinke again you ſee through the caſement of her windowe the payre of eyes that mocking Michol ſo ſcornfully caſt vpon her owne Lord and huſband king Dauid, when ſhee ſawe him come daūcing before the arke of God. Remember her reprochfull ſpeech to him, and what was Dauid worſe for all this? See and reade agayne and agayne,

courage he tooke to himſelf for al this contempt of ſo neere a friend, and how hee anſwered her, and let it bee your example and comfort euer. Michol was the worſe that diſdained, Dauid not a whit the worſe that was diſdained. She plagued with barrenneſſe for euer, Dauid bleſſed for his true heart and zeale to God. And it is inough.
               
                  
                     Alteration of theyr minds whome we tooke for frends a ſharpe Temptation.
                  Others obſerue themſelues forſaken dayly of ſuch as they tooke to bee theyr friends, and to haue beene faſter knit in affection to them than as that they woulde haue ſo ſlunke awaie. They ſee a chaunge in their faces that haue fawned, in theyr wordes, in theyr deedes, and in all circumſtaunces. And this grieueth them, they wonder at it, and thinke what haue they done to deſerue this alteration. Forgetting quite that euen this alſo is one of the Lordes exerciſes that hee trayneth vp his children in, till they grow to a true knowledge, how fickle and tickle this world and all his ſhewes be, and that it hath bene laid vpon his choſen in greate meaſure. For what a pittifull complaynt maketh Iob of this matter,
                     Iob. 19.13. &amp;c
                   if you mark it. The Lord hath remooued (ſayth hee) my brethren farre

from mee, and alſo, myne acquaintance were ſtrangers vnto me. My neighbours haue forſaken mee, and my familiars haue forgotten me. They that dwell in my houſe, and my maydes tooke mee for a ſtranger in their ſight, I called my ſeruant, but hee woulde not anſwere, though I prayed him with my mouth. Yea my breath was ſtraunge, to myne owne wife, though I prayed her for the childrens ſake of myne owne body. All my ſecret friends abhorred mee,
                  
                     verſ. 19.
                   
                  and they whome I loued are turned againſt mee. Hath any man taſted of a greater change than this man did, Or may a man taſt of a greater? Surely this was a great one, and it ſhould be a ſure prop to hold vp our ſliding feete for any alteration of men from vs. Dauid complayned of the like, that the Lord had hid his acquaintance out of his ſight,
                     Pſal. 31.11.
                   that they that did ſee him without in the ſtreetes conueyed themſelues from him. And what then? Such hath bene the world, ſuch is it, &amp; for ſuch take it, if you be wiſe. To day a friend, to morow none, to day in my boſome with ſugred wordes, to morow in my face with ſharp arrowes.

                  Ioſephs owne brethren changed vpon him with a great change, when he leaſt thought it, and leſſe maruell if his maſter ſo changed for no iuſt cauſe, Putiphar I meane that made ſo much of him. Moſes &amp; Aaron found great alterations of mens minds,

Of theſe experiences the world is full, and the word of God hath ſtore: caſt them together for your ſtay, when you read them, and take the world, and all the faces and fawnes of the ſame as they are, and euer haue bene, that is for fickle and moſt ſlippery. Your maſter Chriſt, and your fellow ſeruants haue found it ſo, and for Gods ſake ſeeke not to bee ſingular your ſelfe, it is inough for the ſeruant to be like his maſter, ſeeke not to be aboue him. If Iob find his owne wife changed, ſhall hee wonder at others? No, no▪

dayntines vnfit for a Chriſtian, to be able to beare no backbiters. Some will to the deuell, for their priuie pratling to the hurt of their neighbours, though we ſweare the contrary, and heartily wiſh the contrary. There is no helpe for them. Onely ſtande you out of their way, that the faſter they runne, the ſooner they may come thither, and the worlde bee rid of them, for ſurely they are in haſt a number, and they ſeeme to feare nothing more, than that hell gates ſhould be ſhut, and the play begunne before they come. The Lord will be glorified by their death, and the Lord make vs glorifie him by our patience, and by our carefull ſhunning of all iuſt cauſe of any euill report. That ſuffring this bitter poyſon of Aſpes that is vnder their tongues, &amp; vppon their tongues,

                     To be rewarded euell for good tempteth many.
                   and they fret at it ſore, to haue true good will and many honeſt teſtimonies of a friendly minde ſo badly, ſo vnkindly, yea ſo vildly requited. And in

deede it is true that ſuch vndeſerued vnkindnes pearceth deepe, and hath preuailed with ſome, euen to the breaking of their hearts, and the ending of their dayes. But alas it ſhould not bee ſo hote in vs, if God gaue gouernement ouer frayle fleſh, according to true reaſon. For if falſe man turne his backe vpon GOD, that hath in ſuch wonderfull and vnſearchable fauour vſed him,
                     Conſider this often.
                   and with ſuch an incomprehenſible &amp; vnmeaſurable heape of mercies filled his cuppe from his cradle, and before, what maruell though hee turne vppon one of vs (whoſe fauours, though great, yet cannot be like theſe) both backe, and heart, and tongue, and teeth, and all the powers hee hath any way? Truely this onely ſhoulde content vs, when we finde ſuch meaſure in the worlde. But we haue beſide, the company in this croſſe of ſuch great and deere ones to the Lorde, that we ſhould be euen glad we may go along with them and partake with them in no worſe thing, than the Lord thought good to lay vpon them. Dauid complaineth: they rewarded me euill for good, to the great diſcomfort of my ſoule, neuertheleſſe when they were

But in mine aduerſitie (marke it) they reioyced and gathered themſelues together, yea the very abiects came together againſt me vnawares, making mowes at mee, and ceaſed not. We haue Iacob a companion in this croſſe with vs, who was ill rewarded both by affection and action of Laban and his children, we haue Ioſeph with vs, Moſes and Aaron with vs, all the Prophets and Apoſtles with vs, and Chriſt our maſter with vs, whoſe loue was loſt to thouſāds, except a crucifige be a kinde requitall, and againſt whom hee that ſate at his table lift vp his heele &amp; betrayed him. O weigh it not much, but be content, and poſſeſſe your ſoule in patience. For it is euen one of the moſt common ſinnes of this world,

faire in this end of the world, ſaith the Apoſtle. And what man or woman almoſt liueth, that hath not drunke of this cuppe, to bee vnkindly requited for their true good will, and to haue the backes of them towardes them, whoſe faces by good right they ſhould haue, and their mouthes filled with many louing thankes. If then company bee comfortable as the ſaying is, let vs plucke vp our heartes, and bee content, eſpecially hauing ſuch company in this croſſe as I haue nowe named.
               This courſe would be long if I ſhould follow it fully you ſee by this, and I purpoſed neuer treatiſes, but touches onely of theſe matters. What ſhoulde I ſay? ſome the Lord exerciſeth with diſeaſes and ſicknes of themſelues and their owne bodies,

                  but the Lorde deliuereth them out of all. By this example whoſoeuer readeth the ſcriptures may find out mo, obſerue and marke them, and gather comfort by them, if the Lord ſhal pleaſe ſo to deale with them. And to that further trauell I referre vs all, not following this courſe nowe any further, onely this I adde that if you can find no example of your caſe fully in the Scripture, and therupon Satan

would be buſie and ſay, ſee, thou art an odde perſon from all others, I warrant thee God neuer dealt ſo with any of his &amp;c. then beleeue Peter rather than him, and tel him hee lyeth like a falſe deuill. For you are taught there, that the ſame afflictions are accompliſhed in your brethren which are in the world, although you knowe them not. 1. Pet. 5.9. And therefore you are no odde one, neither chaſtiſed any otherwiſe, than with the rod of the righteous, whoſe ſaluation is ſure, and they the Lords.
               O, but you muſt needes giue mee leaue to remember yet one thing ere you make an end, and that is this. Theſe examples are comfortable, I heartely confeſſe, and ſweete when wee finde them in our ſeuerall tryals, but yet Satan hath an other tricke to trouble many mindes with all, and that is, with the meaſure of our trouble. He will, till wee find an example, ſay none are ſo dealt with all that God loueth, but when wee haue founde one, then hee ſhifteth his foote, and ſuggeſteth, not in that meaſure, and ſo grieuouſly and greatly as wee are.

Nowe what ſhoulde wee ſay to this?
               
                  
                     The meaſure of aduerſitie a

                        ill temptation.
                  Truely euen ſtill ſearch the ſcriptures. And as wee haue founde there matter, ſo ſhal we find meaſure, I warrāt you, greater than wee beare any. And to this ende marke what Iob ſayth in his 16. chapter. His archers compaſſe me round about,
                  
                     Iob. 16.13.14.
                   
                  hee cutteth my reynes, and doeth not ſpare, and powreth my gaul vppon the ground. Hee hath broken me with one breaking vppon an other, and runneth vpon me like a Gyant. Here you ſee not onely aduerſitie and affliction, but euen a marueilous meaſure, &amp; yet the man deere to the Lords heart that indured it. Euery woorde hath a power to expreſſe a great temptation, if you marke them. Compaſſed round about, his reynes cut, not ſpared, his very gaull as it were powred out, one breaking vpon an other, and runne vppon with the Lorde as with a Gyant. Are you able to ſay you haue ſuch meaſure of woe vpon you? you cannot if you will ſpeake trueth. And yet was Iob for all this meaſure, as I ſay, the Lordes choſen. In the 19. chapter marke againe his phraſe: His armies ſayth he came together,
                  
                     Iob. 19.12.
                   
                  &amp; made

their way vpon me, and camped about my tabernacle. Before he ſayd, the Lords archers, now he ſayth, the Lordes armies, ſtill noting both great number, and great ſtrength. What can you or I ſay? Happely wee may ſay the Lorde hath ſhot one headleſſe arrowe at vs, to quicken vs, &amp; awake vs out of earthly &amp; worldly ſecuritie, happely an arrowe with a heade, that hath ſomewhat pearced, let it be two or three, or twentie, alas this is not the number of the Lordes archers, this is not to feele the armies of the Lord and his battels, euen all his battels ioyned together againſt vs. I pray you therefore ſtill marke Iobs meaſure, and your meaſure, and yet Iob loued. In his 30. chapter. Thou turneſt thy ſelfe cruelly againſt me, and art enemy vnto me with the ſtrength of thy hand. Thou takeſt me vp and cauſeſt me to ride vppon the wind, and makeſt my ſtrength to fayle. When hee ſayth cruelly, his meaning is not to accuſe God, but to declare the vehemency of his affliction, wherby he was caried beſide himſelfe. And by the word, wind, he compareth his afflictions to a tempeſt or whirlewinde. Therefore ſtill

note the meaſure. We may ſafely acknowledge the Lords rod vpon vs, but yet may we not ſay, it is all his rod, when it is but a twigge. And I aſſure my ſelfe, if we looke at Iobs meaſure, ours is ſkarſe a twigge. Howe then ſhould Satan whiſper any diſcomfort to vs for our meaſure, whatſoeuer it is, when it is not comparable to his, whom wee knowe notwithſtanding loued. Was Dauid lightly humbled whē he ſaid: there is no whole part in my body by reaſon of my ſin: when he cried, Why art thou ſo ſad my ſoule, and why art thou ſo diſquieted within mee? ſtill truſt in God &amp;c. Was it a litle meaſure that Abraham and Iſaac ſo wandred, toſſed from pillar to poſt (as we ſay) in perils &amp; feares and many afflictions, and yet contayned not the promiſe? Was it a litle meaſure that Iacob ſuſteyned, firſt to haue his owne and onely brother ſweare his death as it were, then to leaue Father and Mother, houſe and home, Countrey and friendes, and to ſeeke for a worlde abroade, to ſerue paynefully his owne vncle, and in the ende to be vnkindly requited with an other than hee wiſhed: to beginne other ſeuen yeres againe,

or elſe looſe his deſire: to be pinched in his wages, enuyed and maliced by his owne fleſh, driuen to depart without any farewel, purſued after, vexed with wrongfull accuſations and charges, to haue the wife whome hee loued, not altogether vpright in iudgement of religion, his bed defiled by his eldeſt ſonne, his daughter rauiſhed and taken away, a horrible murder committed by Simeon and Leui vpon that quarell, Ioſeph ſolde, but as hee thought, murdered by a wilde beaſt, with many mo very bitter and ſmarting temptations, if you marke the ſtory? Thus may you then go ouer the Scriptures, and ſee the meaſure of others many: compare it with yours and be truely comforted, if God ſo wil. For certainely wee are not tried and humbled like theſe men,
                     1. Cor. 10.
                   your owne conſcience muſt acknowledge it, and reaſon will euict it, whether you will or no. For if God lay no more vpon any, than according to his abilitie to beare: and our fayth, when the greateſt, yet is inferiour to thoſe, then aſſuredly our tryals are inferiour alſo. And ſo their examples our true comfort againſt this aſſault drawen from the meaſure that wee

indure. Folow then this courſe, and as you reade, marke not only matter of affliction, but meaſure, and I warrant you this lying deuil wil hide his head, conuinced with a trueth.
               Your order now leadeth you to reuewe howe man tempteth or trieth man. But that hauing in my opinion ſufficiently bene touched before, it will not bee amiſſe if you goe to the laſt poynt, namely howe Satan tempteth vs.
               
                  
                     The ſame temptation may come from God Satan in diuers reſpects.
                  And I altogether put my ſelfe vppon your direction, yet with this note by the way, that the ſelfe ſame temptations may bee ſayde to proceede from Satan, that otherwiſe haue beene ſayde to come from God. From Satan in malice, from God in mercy. From Satan, as they vrge and perſwade vs to any euill contrary to the worde. From the Lorde as they open to vs our weakenes in fayth, and ſundry corruptions, driuing vs to his ſelfe, as to our true ſtrength and ſupport in all our weaknes. Which being remembred, then ſay we concerning this diuiſion, that the temptations of Satan are infinite, and cannot bee

named of any man, albeit felt of all men, as the Lord will giue him leaue to ſhewe his malice, of ſome more, of ſome leſſe, and of euery one ſomewhat.

The errors and hereſies that haue bene of old, what an heape are they, if I ſhould take this courſe, or who can tell what euen yet dayly he worketh in this behalfe throughout the worlde, ſtuffing mens heades, and filling their hearts with great vntruths.
               Some hee hath perſwaded heretofore and ſtill no doubt will perſwade,
                     The firſt temptation concerning the Church.
                   if God permit him, that an eſtate of the true Church heere on earth is to bee expected more perfit and holy than in deede is true. And he telleth them, that if any Church be ſo ſeparated from the world, that therein in deede and trueth all mens liues be framed according to the woorde of God, that is a true Church, and if any Church bee not ſo ſeparated from the world, but that in it are found ſome without repentance which liue not according to the worde of God, but haue their blots and ſpots, both in fayth to

God, and loue to mā, that is a falſe church, from which the children of God muſt ſeparate themſelues, leaſt they ſhould bee partakers of other mens ſinnes. So that the imperfections of a Church, and the faults of ſome in the Church, not remoued by &amp; by from the ſame, ſhall vtterly take away both name and nature of a Church from that place. A great and grieuous vntrueth ſurely, and ſuch as we may ſay of with S. Hilarie: Archangeli neſciunt, angeli non audiuerunt, prophaeta non ſenſit, filius ipſe non edidit.
                   The Archangels knowe it not, the Angels haue not heard it, the prophet hath not felt it, the ſonne of God himſelfe hath reueiled no ſuch thing to vs. For was not Iudas a wicked theefe in the company of the Apoſtles, and yet they for all that the flocke of Chriſt? Hath not the Lorde deſcribed the eſtate of this true Church militant here on earth by the ſimilitudes of a drawe net caſt into the ſea,
                     Matt 13.47.
                   that incloſeth &amp; compaſſeth fiſh of al ſorts, yea ſtickes &amp; ſtones, ſlime and mudde, without any ſeparation till it come to the ſhore? Of a field, wherin with the good wheate ſowen by the huſbandman come vp tares ſowen by the enuious

man, and ſo intermingled that no cleere ſeperation can bee made, but with daunger of plucking vp the wheate alſo, till the harueſt come? Of a floore whereon lyeth much good wheate,
                     Math. 3.12.
                   but couered almoſt and hid in an heape of chaffe intermingled with it, till the fanner come with his fanne in his hande to purge the ſame, and make cleane his flowre? Of a great wedding,
                     Math. 22.1.
                   whereunto as good and bad are bidden; ſo come there ſome and take their places, that yet haue no wedding garments, ſitting with the beſt till the King come in to ſée the gueſtes, &amp; diſplace them? And are not theſe plaine proofes what maner of Church we muſt content our ſelues withall here on earth, till the day of perfection come, namely, euen with ſuch an one, as though conſidered in Chriſt,
                     Ephe. 5.26.
                   it be cleane and without ſpot and wrincle: yet conſidered in it ſelfe it is not ſo, before it come to the marke it ſhooteth at, but in this life runneth in a race, and after two ſortes is ſtayned and impure. Firſt, with the manifolde imperfections, frailties and wants which her very beſt children are burdened withall euer, feeling with the Apoſtle that

in their fleſh dwelleth no good thing, that they are yoked as he was and farre worſe that when they would do good,
                     Rom. 7.18.21
                   euill is preſent with them: and ſecondly with a greeuous mixture of many falſe hipocrites and counterfet pratlers amongſt her true children, whom though ſhe ſigh to be deliuered of, and doe by her authoritie, as ſhe may, diſburden her ſelfe of them, yet can ſhe neuer doe it ſo cleane, but that many vilde weedes will remayne till the harueſt, to be then plucked vp, and till then in patience to be indured.
               Let vs conſider the Church from her very cradle, and wee ſhall finde the ſtate of it after this ſorte. Adam in his familie had Caine, with his wicked behauiour, and yet a Church. Noah had Cham, and yet a Church.
                     Gala. 4.29.
                   
                  Abraham had Iſmael, a mocker and derider of Gods promiſes, a mā borne after the fleſh, that is, after the common courſe of nature, and perſecuting him that was borne after the Spirit, that is, by the vertue of Gods promiſe, and after a ſpirituall maner, and yet a Church. Iſaac had Eſau,
                  
                     Gen. 49.
                   and yet a Church. Iacob had great miſdemeanours committed ſtill in his fa
                     •
                  milie,

by all his ſonnes enuying and malicing, and moſt vnbrotherly vſing Ioſeph: By Ruben defiling his bed, by Simeon and Leui brethren in euill, inſtruments of crueltie, and in their wrath ſtaying ſo many, by Dinah his daughter, by Rachel his wife ſtealing her fathers Idols,
                     Calu. vpon the place.
                   and but ouer much deceiued with them, and by many other meanes, if we fully peruſe the ſtorie, and yet a Church. Neither did euer either Adam or Noah, or Abraham or the reſt forſake theſe Churches in their ſeuerall families, or refuſe to pray, and to doe all other dueties inioyned thē of the Lord, for any vnworthie ones among them. Thē when it came into Egipt, was it without wrincles? When it was deliuered therehence, remember wee not, what falles and faults, what blots and blemiſhes ſtill ſtill and euer appeared in that choſen companie out of all the Nations of the world? Néede I to repeate their murmurings, their reuilings, their faintings, their many and great impieties mentioned in the ſtorie vnder Moſes, vnder Ioſua, &amp; vnder Iudges? Step to the Kings and to the Prophets, what a ſtate is mentioned of this Church

militant vnder them alſo euer? Were all things holy and perfect then? Let Eſay, Ieremy, Ioel, Abacuc and the reſt ſpeake. In the Prieſtes, in the Magiſtrates, in the people al things were then ſo corrupt, that the Prophet Eſay is not afraid to compare Hieruſalem to Sodome and Gomorrha. Religion was thē partly contemned, partly defiled,
                     Eſay. 1.2. reade the Chapter.
                   and many greeuous enormities in manners abounded, ſo that from the ſole of the foote to the top of the head there was nothing whole, but woundes, and ſwellings, and ſores, full of corruptions, ſayth the Prophet. Yet for all this neuer did the Prophets, all, or any of them, erect newe Churches for themſelues, wherein they might haue their ſeperated ſacrifices from the reſt, offred vpon any newe Altars, builded to that ende as more holy. But what maner of men ſoeuer they were,
                     In m
                           •
                        dio imp
                           •
                        orum coetu puras manus extendebant, &amp; cum populo iniquo &amp; peruerſo conueniebant Calu.
                   becauſe the word was there, and a courſe of ſeruice warranted in the thicke of the wicked and in the middeſt of miſdoers, they lifted vp pure hands to the Lord, and came together euen with the wicked to pray, to ſacrifice, to heare the word, and to doe their dueties in the place appoynted. Truely wee muſt

thinke this of thoſe holy Prophets, that if they had iudged other mens ſinnes could haue defiled their holy dueties, or that any infection and contagion might haue come to thē by meeting in thoſe places of Gods ſeruice with the wicked, they would haue dyed an hundred times, rather than haue ſuffered themſelues to bée drawne thether. But they knewe it could not, and hauing a ſingular care of peace and vnitie in the Church, they therefore abhorred to make any ſchiſme in the ſame, by ſeperating them ſelues from the Church. Now, if thoſe worthies of the Lorde, for ſo many and ſo great euilles, not of one or two men, but euen almoſt of the whole people made a conſcience yet not to eſtraunge themſelues from the Church, ſhall not you and I arrogate too much to our ſelues, if wee preſume to doe it in theſe daies? Will not that ſaying of S. Auſten be layd vpon vs, ſpoken to the Donatiſtes vpon like occaſion: Finxerunt ſe nimis iuſtos, cùm totum vellent perturbare. They made themſelues too holy, when they would thus trouble all? Therefore a ſweéee moderation of all good deſires according to theſe true preſidents

and holy examples aſſuredly would bee moſt acceptable to the Lord himſelfe, as it was in theſe.
               Come wee from the Prophets to our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe, that if any man make leſſe accompt of the former than hee ſhould, this later may moue him and ſatiſfie him further. What maner of Church was then, the Goſpell teacheth at large, and wee are not ignorant, when Chriſt liued and preached among the Iewes. A moſt corrupt eſtate it was and ful of ſores, that Chriſt ſharply reproued in his times. Yet neither that deſperate impietie of the Phariſies, nor that looſe libertie that ouerflowed as it were the Church then, could hinder Chriſt either from vſing the ſame forme of ſeruing God with the people, or from comming into the ſame temple with the multitude to the publique exerciſes of Religion there appoynted. But he would bee circumciſed with the reſt and preſented in the temple as others were when the time came,
                     Luc. 1.21.22.
                   and doe all things with them appoynted by the lawe for him to doe. If any man doubt of it, let him conſider the Scripture well that ſayth:
                     Galat. 4.4.
                   
                  When the fulnes

of time was come, God ſent foorth his ſonne made of a woman, and made vnder the lawe, that hee might redeeme thē which were vnder the lawe, that we might receiue the adoption of ſonnes. Hee ſpeaketh of the Ceremoniall lawe by name, and therfore no queſtion but he performed whatſoeuer therein was commanded, and of man, whom he was to redéeme, ought to be performed. Let him conſider alſo Chriſtes owne wordes when he ſayd, Wee worſhip what wee knowe, ioyning himſelfe not with a fewe picked and choyſe Chriſtians, but with the whole multitude of the people of the Iewes, and adding a reaſon that proueth ſo much, for ſaluation commeth from the Iewes. Which is as much, as if he ſhould haue ſayd, for the Religion (not of ſome certaine) but of the whole people or bodie of the Iewes is a ſeruice that pleaſeth God for his owne appoyntment of it, and therefore I communicate with them therein my ſelfe, and we worſhip what we knowe together.
                     Muſc. in Iohn pag. 102.
                   
                  Muſculus conſidering aſmuch, therefore noteth by our Sauiours example what care and conſcience ought to bee in euery Chriſtian

to obſerue the forme of his owne nation in ſeruing God, if it may be warranted. And it is not vnnoted of many others,
                     He entred ſtill into their Synagogue
                           •
                         and preached and prayed, &amp;c. on the Saboth daies.
                   that our Sauiour notwithſtanding the great corruptions of that Church, communicated with it in all holy exerciſes, and made not an other Church by himſelfe of ſome certayne better people, and yet there wanted not ſuch euen in thoſe euil daies, diuers, as Zachary, Elizabeth, Mary, Simeon and others beſides his diſciples. So that our Sauiours example is playne againſt this deceiuing error that we ſpeake of, namely, that any man communicating in the publique exerciſes of religion according to the word of God appoynted, with the wicked, ſhould by their companie there bee polluted, he himſelfe hauing a good conſcience, and doing his duetie as he ought.
               From our Sauiour Chriſt let vs next come to his diſciples tyme, and ſee if they followed not the very ſame courſe, and trod not in the very ſame ſteps of their maſters practiſe. Let vs remember the Church of Corinth,
                  
                     1. Cor. 1.2.
                   which the Apoſtle in the Spirite of trueth calleth the Church of God, ſanctified, beloued, and abounding with the

gifts of God. And yet in it were many imperfections and ſundry great and foule enormities. There was enuying,
                     Chap. 3.3.
                   and ſtrife and diuiſions, one holding of Paul, an other of Apollos, an other of Cephas, in ſo much that the Apoſtle telleth them they are carnall, and he could not ſpeake vnto them as vnto ſpirituall men, but as vnto carnall. There was puffing, and ſwelling,
                     1. Cor. 4.18. &amp; chap. 5.2.21.
                   &amp; pride in ſuch order, that the Apoſtle aſketh, ſhall I come vnto you with a rod, or in loue. There was fornication,
                     1. Cor. 5.1.
                   and euen ſuch as is not named among the Gentiles, one had his Fathers wife, and they that ſawe it and knewe it were puffed vp, and ſorowed not, neither puniſhed as they ought ſo foule a wickednes.
                     Chap. 6.
                   There was quarelling &amp; brabling, and buſie going to lawe one with an other, and that vnder infidels. Men and women that were maried together made ſeparations and diuorſes of themſelues one from an other, of their owne authorities;
                     7.5.13.
                   and when themſelues liſted, without word and warrant, without right and conſcience which the Apoſtle rebuketh and telleth them might not be ſo.
                     1. Cor. 6. 1. Cor. 10.
                   There was going to the prophane bankets of the Gentiles, and

eating of thinges ſacrificed to Idols,
                     1. Cor. 11. 1. Cor. 12.
                   with great offence to the weake. The v
                     •
                  ry Sacrament of the Lords Supper was greatly prophaned, Thoſe Spirituall giftes which the Lorde gaue them they abuſed, bragging ambitiouſly of them, and ſo robbing God of his prayſe for them, hauing no conſideration of their brethren to edifie thē by an humble mind ſubmitting it ſelfe to the capacitie of the weakeſt. On the other ſide they that were inferiors in gifts enuyed the ſuperiors and went about to make a departure, ſo that all that body was as it were ſkattered and rent in pieces.
                     Chap. 14.
                   That notable gift of tongues and languages they greatly abuſed neglecting prophecie. And what ſhould I ſay, the very reſurrection, that great Article of a chriſtians faith was called in queſtion in that Church, and yet for all that and al theſe that I haue thus named,
                     1. Cor. 15.
                   it ceaſed not to bee a Church, and the Church of God, and Sanctified and beloued and bleſſed, and made rich with many graces, neither for theſe blots might any man haue bene iuſtified then to haue giuen it the blacke ſtone of condemnation, and to haue ſeparated himſelfe from it as

from no Church. Let vs remember the Galathiās,
                  
                     Galat. 1.6.
                   of whom the Apoſtle complaineth,
                     3.1.
                   that they were ſo ſoone remoued away vnto an other Goſpell,
                     4.9.
                   from him that had called them in the grace of Chriſt, that they were bewitched, not to obey the trueth, but to turne againe vnto impotent and beggerly rudiments, ſeeking to be in bondage to them againe as at the beginning, that they obſerued dayes, moneths, tymes, and yeres and ſo foorth, euery of which was a great blot and ſpot, and all together a very great declyning from a right courſe, yet neuertheleſſe doth the Apoſtle in the Spirit of trueth ſalute them as the Church of God, and ſo nameth them,
                     Chap. 1.2.
                   and ſo taketh them. To the playne prouing of this truth, that imperfections in a Church, where the worde is preached truely, and the Sacraments adminiſtred according to the inſtitution of Chriſt, taketh not away the name of a Church. And marke it in Paul, becauſe we ſeeke not nowe other examples, howe notwithſtanding theſe great blemiſhes in Corinth, Galatia, and other places that he came to, yet he euer without any ſcruple 
                     •
                  ntered into their Churches, into ye Iewes

Synagogues, and into all places, to pray, and to interpret the Scriptures. Yea hee made no doubt to exhibite himſelfe in the Temple to call vpon God, and to vſe other lawfull ceremonies, together with others that vſed them, although the wickednes &amp; impietie of the Scribes &amp; Phariſes which were there then, was exceeding foule and great. Neither doth he euer perſwade any of the better ſort, when hee ſpeaketh of the faults either in Corinth or Galatia, or other Churches, to forbeare all communion with thoſe Churches till thinges were better reformed, but onely exhorteth them to beware the vices and euils he ſpeaketh of, and neuer mencioneth any ſeparation. Which aſſuredly he would haue done, if it had bene, as ſatan by this temptation that now we handle ſeeketh to perſwade. Therfore I pray you let vs all note it and thinke of it. And as hee did not forbid others ſuch communion, ſo himſelf did not breake that felowſhip, as already hath appeared and more may if wee marke his practiſe. For hee ſayth to the Philippians,
                  
                     Philip. 2.21.
                   that he had no body like Timotheus, but al did ſéeke their own and not that which is Ieſus Chriſts▪
                  
Yet neuer do we find that he ſeparated him ſelfe from their company for feare of partaking with their ſinnes. And diuers ſuch other places there are. What might be added of thoſe famous Churches in the Reuelation, Epheſus, Pergamus, Thyatira, and others? Doth not the Spirit of God lay downe their blemiſhes, and ſheweth what he had againſt them, and thoſe no litle things ſome of them, and yet yeldeth them the names and titles of Churches and calleth their miniſters angels. What then if a man in thoſe dayes ſhoulde haue taken offence at theſe wants of theſe Churches, &amp; weakeneſſes of men, and haue ſayde they haue preaching,
                     Preaching without reformation.
                   but they are not reformed as they ſhould be, and therefore I will cut my ſelfe from them, and communicate no longer with them? would it haue bene alowed? Conſider the Lord Ieſus his preaching, with more holynes and power than euer any elſe could or ſhall.
                     Mar. 9.9.
                   Were all reformed that heard him, nay were his owne diſciples reformed wholy? How then were they ſo often rebuked of the Lorde and that iuſtly.
                     Eſai. 6.9. Ezek. 3.7.
                   Conſider the Prophets that were hidden propheſie, and did it carefully, and

yet were told that the people would not obey them. Conſider the Apoſtle that ſayth we are a ſweete ſauour to God in ſome that periſh. Conſider that hee which willeth Paul to plant, and Apollo to water, reſerueth the gift of increaſe to himſelfe, and giueth it, where, when, and ſo farre as he pleaſeth. So that if the Lords miniſters in very great heauines and continuall ſorow of heart would wiſh themſelues euen ſeparated from Chriſt for their brethrens winning, yet ſhall no moe come to the father than Chriſt will drawe, and this happy change muſt bee at his good pleaſure, not at their deſire. How then may we ſafely fall out with the preaching, and preacher, and with the Church and her children for want of that which onely GOD muſt giue, and the beſt preachers haue fayled to obtaine, though faithfully doing their dueties, namely a full reformation as wee would. Shall that holy worde not reforme me becauſe it reformeth not others? ſhall it not be a ſauour to me of life, to life becauſe to others it is a ſauour of death to death? If hee offer mee a penny ſhall I bid him keepe it, except hee will giue others as

much at my direction? May not the Lorde doe with his owne as it pleaſeth him for mee? or ſhall I grudge to the Spirite his blowing where he liſteth? O fearefull falling out with the Lord and his offred goodnes, if it bee conſidered earneſtly. Wee ſhould remember againe when wee looke ſo after the fruites of amendment in a Church,
                     Note.
                   and ſtumble ſo dangerouſly for wāt of what we wiſh, that Phariſees make greater ſhewes to ſome mens eyes than poore Publicanes doe, and yet the one iuſtified more than the other with a righteous God. We ſhould remember that Elias was deceyued when hee thought that there were no mo that were reformed but himſelfe. Our eyes cannot ſee all men, neither can we euer know the worke of the worde preached. Inward graces are often where we thought not, and outwarde carie, more then we know. Some iudged lead proues fined golde, and gliſtring gold that ſeemed to bee, proues droſſie lead. A tender conſcience, ſweete, feeling an hope in Chriſt and his promiſes, inward cryings by faythfull prayer, holy thoughtes and meditations, ſweete prickes and melting motions, remorſe

for ſinne, and ſpirituall fights, humilitie of heart, and peace of mind, patience, ioy, and a number ſuch, they bee ſecret graces not alwayes knowne and diſcerned of euery man where in truth they are, at leaſt not in ſuch meaſure as in deede they are. And therefore ſince we cannot knowe all, either people, or graces, wrought by the worde preached, and there may bee a want aſwell in our not ſeeing all with Elias, as in mens miſdoings, greatly ſhould we feare to condemne and iudge the Churches of GOD, for not anſwering their teaching with any reformation. It is an earneſt charge,
                     Matth. 18.9.
                   and of a mightie God. See that ye deſpiſe not one of theſe litle ones. For I ſay vnto you that in heauen their Angels alwayes behold the face of my Father which is in heauen. What greater contempt, than to thinke that Publicane is not like me. I am reformed, I am ſanctified, I haue receyued the holy Ghoſt, others haue not, and theſe by name haue not ſo. O take heede. Iudge not thus raſhly an other mans ſeruant. All is not gold that gliſtereth, neither all bowers of their knees to Baal that are yet ſo thought to be, euen of

a Prophet. Laſtly wee ſhould lift vp our heads and open our eyes in a louing heart a little wider, that we may ſee the profites of the worde, and the gracious mercies of the Lorde to any Church euer, and with as hungrie a heart delight to diſcerne the graces of men, as the faults of men. Yea much more.
                     The reformation of many Churches, ye
                           •
                         iudged not reformed at all.
                   And if wee ſee many ſuperſtitions baniſhed, many abuſes amended, many ſnared conſciences and fettered ſoules inlarged, true loue of diuers good things, and true hatred of diuers euil things wrought: Ougly and often othes in many decayed, knowledge both in youth and age increaſed, the hearing of the word with Prayers and Sacraments diligently frequented, priuate regarde of families in the gouernours of them greatly amended, diet and apparell tempred, the poore reléeued, Princes obeyed, peace maintayned, &amp;c. to confeſſe then to the due glorie of a gracious God that this is ſomething, and this meaſure ſome, although not all. Loue ſpieth any good wher it loueth, &amp; loue couereth many things that are not well. Surely it doth not for wants denie the good, neither for ſome, condemne all. And thus if we would

looke at Churches &amp; children of the Churches, no doubt, no doubt Satans combe would be cut touching this temptation. If any man will ſay, ſhewe me theſe reformed ones and good ones in a Church: what anſwereth a learned father. Quid hac re opus eſt? Annon ſatis eſt eos in eccleſia eſſe. Quā
                     obrem cùm ipſa communionem habetote, manete in eccleſia, &amp; ad ſacros coetus &amp; ſacramenta, quemadmodum oportet, accedite. Etiamſi enim multi impuri &amp; publici peccatores non mundati in ea ſint, tamen vos ab illis non polluemini, non magis quam Apoſtolos Iudaei polluerunt. Quin potiùs videte ne à vobis ipſis polluamini, propterea quòd multum vobis tribuitis, iudicatis omnes, &amp; plurimum vobis placetis. Itaque ſpiritualis ſuperbia &amp; contemptus nimium veſtris animis inſidet. That is: What needeth this? Sufficeth it not yt they are in the Church? Wherefore with the Church do you communicate, abide ye in her, and come ye as you ought vnto the aſſemblies and Sacraments. For although there bee many impure ones, and publique offenders not reformed in the ſame, yet ſhall not you bée defiled by them, no more than the Apoſtles

were defiled of the Iewes. Rather take you heede that ye bee not defiled of your ſelues, becauſe ye attribut ſo much to your ſelues: ye iudge all men, and very much pleaſe your ſelues. Therefore ſpirituall pride and contempt ouermuch reſteth in your mindes. Thus doe we ſee the worde of God againſt this temptation teaching ſtrength. If I ſhould adioyne the witneſſes of this truth frō time to time, I might be long. A little let mée doe it, though not much, becauſe I haue bene ſo long alreadie. Cyprian ſpake thus in his time full earneſtly. Et ſi videntur in eccleſia zizania. &amp;c.
                  
                     Lib. 3. Epiſt. 5.
                   Although there be tares ſeene in the Church, and impure veſſels of diſhonor: yet is there no cauſe why wee ſhould depart from the Church: onely let vs indeuour that we may be wheate our ſelues, &amp; veſſels of golde or ſiluer vnto honor. And as for the earthen veſſels, it is the Lordes proper office and prerogatiue to breake them, that hath only the non barre, neither may any man chalenge to himſelfe that which is peculiar to the Sonne onely, namely to be able to make cleane the floore, and to purge away the chaffe, and all tares

by mans iudgement. For proude is this obſtinacie, and ſacrilegious is this preſumption, which wicked madnes taketh to it ſelfe.

                  Auſten in his time thus. There were many good men in the olde Church before Chriſt. Dic mihi, quis tunc iuſtorum ſeparauit ſibi altare? Tell me, what one of all theſe iuſt men in thoſe daies made a ſeperated Altar for himſelfe from the reſt. Yet, multa ſcelera admittebat iniquus populus ille. Many wicked things committed then that wicked people. They ſacrificed to Idols, they killed the Prophets, &amp; nemo tamen iustorum receſſit ab vnitate, and yet none of the godly departed from the vnitie. Vno templo miſcebantur, ſed mixti non erant corde. They were mingled or ioyned together in one temple, but they were not of one minde: meaning, they approued not any euill that was done. Si hoc eſt conſentire malefacientibus, eſſe cum eis in eccleſia, conſentiebat etiam ipſe, &amp;c. If this bee to conſent to euill, to bee with euill men in the Church,
                     2. Cor. 11.26.
                   then conſented he to falſe brethrē, that ſayth, he was with them in perill of them,
                     Philip. 1.16.
                   and that ſuffred thoſe impure preachers amongſt the Philippians. Zizania

ergo vel paleam Catholicae ſegetis nobiſcum copioſiſſimè accuſent, ſed nobiſcum ferre patientiſſime non recuſent. Wherfore let them with vs find fault with the tares &amp; chaffe, as they pleaſe, fréely, but thē let them with vs agayne indure them patiently. Et propter malos filios non ſeparemur a matre. And for other euill ſonnes let vs not ſhake of and ſay farewell to our mother. For we do not for the chaffe forſake the Lords floore,
                     Epiſt. 48.
                   we doe not breake out of the Lords Nette for any bad fiſh incloſed therein with vs, wee doe not runne away from the Lordes flock, for the Gotes that are there to be ſeperated in the ende: finally we doe not goe out of ye houſe of God for the veſſels therein made vnto diſhonor. And a number ſuch like ſayings hath Auſten in theſe bookes, and diuers other places of his workes, if this were my purpoſed courſe: but they neede not. Conſider what Maiſter Caluin ſayth, and let both you and me marke his iudgement. Let vs learne, ſayth he, to giue this honour to the worde of God and his holy Sacraments, that whereſoeuer wee ſee thē, there we acknowledge a Church. And let both theſe poynts remayne eſtabliſhed

as moſt certaine truths:
                     Caluin aduerſus Anabap.
                   firſt that he is without all iuſt excuſe that willingly forſaketh the outwarde Communion of the Church where the worde of God is preached, and the Sacraments adminiſtred. Secondly,
                     Inſtitut. 4.1.19.
                   that the faults neither of fewe, nor many, can any whit hinder vs from teſtifying our faith rightly by vſe of ſuch ceremonies as God hath ordayned. Becauſe that by no other mans vnworthines, whether he bee Paſtor or priuate man, a godly conſcience can be hurt, neither are the holy miſteries leſſe pure or profitable to a godly man, becauſe together with him the wicked alſo handle them. Finally, if all things in the Church be not ſo wel as they ſhould bee concerning correction of faults,
                     4. Book. 12.11
                   yet let neither priuate men therefore departe by and by from the Church, nor the Paſtors themſelues, if they cannot according to their harts deſire purge al things that néed amendment, therefore throwe away their miniſterie, or with vnwonted rigorouſnes trouble the whole Church. Many other places hath this man to this end very worthie reading, if I might both note all and be briefe too. But it cannot be, and therfore

I followe him no further. Only I requeſt that wee may diligently obſerue it, how Satan hath euer tempted the children of God to receiue this error, and how faithfull teachers withſtood it ſtill. And if euer he deceiue any, what holdeth them in, and hindreth their reformation? Surely, quia vanam gloriam hominum attendunt, &amp; inſenſatorum non contemnunt opprobrium,

                     Hebr. 10.22. and read all.
                   And with that heauenly counſell of the ſpirit of God I conclude this matter: Let vs not forſake that fellowſhip that we haue one with an other, as the maner of ſome is. The Lord make it ſinke in eiery mans hart to his good.

grace, and ſaluation: the miniſters is only the outwarde action and miniſterie. In which reſpect they are called the diſpoſers of Gods myſteries. If the diſpoſer bee euil, God is good that ſo vouchſafeth, man is not worſe that ſo receyueth. They are the Lords meſſengers, and the truth of the meſſage neuer hangeth vpon the bearers qualitie.

word, or any man be alowed for the faultes of the miniſter to haue reiected and refuſed the Lords myſteries. There raigned at this preſent amongſt this order many grieuous iniquities, as inſatiable auarice, turning al Religion to lucre and gayne, intollerable ambition and pride, ſhameleſſe hypocriſie, groſſe interpretations of the word of God, and what not? They ſayde and did not:
                        Rom. 7.18. Iam. 3.2. 1. Iohn. 1.8. Math. 6.12. Pſal. 143.2.
                      a moſt grieuous thing in a miniſter, further than humane frayltie forceth, whereof all are ful, and the very greateſt haue complained: yet would not the Lorde haue the offence of all theſe to make vile his holy woorde, that is euer precious, or to hinder the hearing of it euen at their mouthes.

Hee ſayth you may receyue their words and bee cleere of their deedes, let vs not ſay, wee cannot receyue their wordes except we approue their euell, and bee partakers of their ſinnes. This is not reuerence to God, nor obedience to his trueth. Were it not groſſe madnes, if traueling

                      and ſhewed by ſome that wee went the very right way to our iourneies ende, yet we would go out of the ſame, becauſe he that ſhewed vs, goeth not with vs, but goeth an other way? No earthly iourney may bee matched with our ſpirituall iourney to heauen. For the places we go to, the good we get, if we keepe the way, the daungers if we doe not, doe all greatly differ. And therfore if his example that hath truely told vs a way on earth to an earthly good, ſhoulde not cary vs out of the ſame, much leſſe ſhoulde his that hath told vs the way to heauen an euerlaſting good, doe the ſame. Let him goe his owne courſe at his owne perill, if he haue truely to

The Magiſtrate hath a further authoritie in his hande, euen ſharply to puniſh ſuch offence giuen by them that ſay and do not. Againe were it not as groſſe to reiect the foode of our bodies, and to dye for hunger, becauſe he that ſetteth good meate before vs, will eate none with vs himſelfe? To refuſe

good gold becauſe the ground is bad wherhence it was digged? Iudge then what madneſſe for the wants of man, to refuſe farre greater matters than all theſe? Remember furthermore what our Sauiour Chriſt ſayth in the 6. of Iohn. Haue not I choſen you twelue,

                     e as it ought to be, that he baptizeth with. Neither would Chriſt (ſaith he) haue refuſed to be baptized of the Phariſees, if they had vſed to baptize: for when he was cirumciſed, Iohn was not ſought for, neither refuſed hee that temple that was a d
                        •
                     nne of theeues. Quapropter ſiue a fideli, ſiue a perfido diſpenſatore ſacramentū baptiſmi quiſque percipiat, ſpes ei omnis in Chriſto ſit, ne ſit maledictus qui ſpem ponit in homine. Wherefore whether of a faythfull, or vnfaythfull,

or vnfaythfull ſteward, a man receiue the ſacrament of baptiſme, let his hope be ſtedfaſtly fixed vpon Chriſt, leaſt it be ſayde: Curſed bee hee that truſteth in man. If he depend vpon the goodneſſe of the miniſter, againſt Creſconius thus. Baptizant, quantum attinet ad viſibile ministerium, &amp; boni, &amp; mali. Inuiſibiliter autem per eos baptizat, cuius est viſibile captiſma, &amp; inuiſibilis gratia. Here baptize, in reſpect of the viſible miniſterie, both good and bad. But inuiſibly by them baptiſeth he, whoſe is both the viſible baptiſme and the inuiſible grace. Afterward againe in the third booke: but thou wilt aſke me, ſayth he, whether is better, a good miniſter, or a bad. And I muſt needes anſwere thee, that in reſpect of example to the people, that depend ſo much theron, that without it they thinke euery thing painfull and hard that God commaundeth, a good miniſter is beſt. But in reſpect of the baptiſme and ſacrament it ſelfe: Si tantò est melius quod accipitur, quantò eſt melior per quem traditur: tanta eſt in accipientibus baptiſmorum varietas, quāta in ministris diuerſitas meritorum: If that ſhould be ſo much

better by how much he was better that miniſtred it, then muſt there be as great differences betwixt mens baptiſmes as betwixt their giftes, graces, and qualities that did baptize, which were horrible to affirm. Paul was better than Apollos in reſpect of grace giuen. Was therefore his baptiſme better? God forbid. Per miniſtros enim diſpares, dei munus aequale eſt, quia non illorum, ſed Dei eſt. For by miniſters farre vnlike, the giuen gift of God is like, becauſe it is his, not theirs, concludeth Auſten truely. Els wo was to them that Iudas baptized. And they had need to lament ſuch baptiſme.
                  Remember maſter Caluins iudgement and ſimilitude. As it is (ſayth he) amongeſt men, if a letter be ſent, ſo the hand and ſeal be knowen, it ſkilleth not what qualities he was of that brought it: ſo muſt it ſuffice vs in the ſacraments, to acknowledge the hand and ſeale of our God, what manner of man ſoeuer the bearer be that deliuereth them. For it hurt the Iewes nothing that they were circumciſed of thoſe impure Prieſtes and Apoſtataes, that then were, neither needed they to be circumciſed

againe. For indeede (ſaith an other) the Sacramentes take not their excellencie and worthineſſe of him yt miniſtreth them, though he be neuer ſo holy, neither be they diſgraced or weakened, thogh the miniſter be wicked and euill. The hand of the receiuer being without fayth, maketh the Sacraments, that of themſelues be good, to be vnto him of no force, becauſe of his vnbeleefe, but a wicked miniſter cannot in any wiſe make fruſtrate, or deceiue the faith of the vngodly receiuer. Our Sauiour Chriſt baptized none whilſte he was vpon earth, but onely preached and his diſciples baptized,
                        Iohn. 4.2.
                      ſayth the Goſpell. And S. Paul continuing in Corinth a yeere and ſixe moneths, where God ſayd vnto him in the night by a viſiō he had much people,
                        Act. 18.11.
                      taught the worde of God among them, and preached, but baptized none, ſauing Criſpus, &amp; Gaius, and the houſeholde of Stephanus, and thanketh God that he had not when he ſaw what diuiſion fell out,
                        1. Cor. 1.14.
                      one ſaying I am Pauls, another, I am Apollos &amp;c. And Muſculus with others agree with Ambroſe that Peter baptized not Cornelius and his company,
                        Petrus cornelij domum, non ipſe, baptizauit, cum coram eſſet, ſed iuſſe
                              •
                            baptizari. Muſc. in Iohn. 4.2.
                        
                      but commaunded

them to be baptized. Nowe none of all theſe woulde haue thus done, wee muſt needes thinke, if better miniſters had made better Sacraments to the receiuers. But euen the contrary, with all indeuour and paine, in a zeale to the Lordes people, that they might haue that holy ordinance with greateſt good. Howe ſhoulde Paul haue thanked God with a conſcience that hee baptized no mo,
                        Aug. Epiſt. 48. pag. 188.
                        
                      when it ſhould haue bin a very greeuous ſin in him not to haue done it, if his excellency aboue other miniſters could haue giuen grace to the Lordes ſacrament? Therefore this very one thing if there were no mo, ſetleth vs fully and firmly touching this poynt. Yet in deede it is a great deale more, that our Sauiour baptized neuer an one, who was of all miniſters the beſt without compariſon, &amp; moſt kindly and carefully addicted to mans good euery way. For why was it, may we with moſt great probabilitie thinke, but leaſt his moſt excellent dignitie aboue all men ſhould worke in the receiuers of that baptiſme, ſome conceit of their baptiſme aboue others baptized by farre inferiour miniſters, and ſo cauſe diſſention in the

Church among them. Wherefore we ſee euen in this omiſſiō of our ſauiour Chriſt, his diuine wiſdome foreſeeing the venom of this error, to meaſure the word and ſacraments by the worthineſſe of the miniſter, and carefully cutting the throte of it in his time. It was truly euer a wrong to the Lord, and his holy myſteries, euer condemned of the Church of God, and wee muſt abhorre it. Si malus ſacerdos, deponendus erat, ſi nō poſſit deponi, tolerandus intra rete. If the miniſter be naught, ſayth S. Auſten, he ſhould be diſplaced, if he cannot be diſplaced, he muſt be indured within the n

                     t. For vpon our diſlikings of men, to refuſe the Lord and the meanes of our ſaluation, it is a more fearful impietie, than yt it needeth amplification. The very thought of it ſtriketh a terror into my ſoule, that I duſt and wormes ſhould except againſt the graces of my creator, vnleſſe the officer of them to me from him be qualified to my liking. For, as wee liue, the Lord wil bee a ſwift iudge, and euen a very conſuming fire one day againſt this hainouſe contempt of himſelfe and his mercies, and the hauing of them in reſpect of perſons. O

beloued our time is now to be wiſe &amp; learned, and to kiſſe the Sonne in his graces, leaſt he be angry, and wee periſh off from the earth. If we doe not, mercie paſſeth, iudgement commeth, and warned people muſt both dye in their ſinne and cary their bloud themſelues for euer.
               
               
                  The third temptation concerning Communicants.
                  
                     SOme againe are tempted and troubled with ſcruples and doubtes, concerning ſuch as are admitted to the Lordes table, and whome ſatan cannot otherwiſe win to deſpiſe that holy Sacrament, by this meanes hee moſt mightily vndermineth and cauſeth them to forbeare, both their great comfort &amp; bounden duetie. For wherſoeuer ſayth hee to them the vncleane are not put apart, and the euill ſeparated from the good by eccleſiaſticall cenſure, there if a Chriſtian communicate, hee is defiled with other mens ſinnes. And therefore to the ende yee may not be polluted with the company of ſuch,

you muſt forbeare, nay refuſe and vtterly abhorre al receyuing of the Supper of the Lord but with a choyce company of ſelect and holy ones. But is this true nowe that other mens ſinnes neuer conſented to by me do defile mee, if I receyue with them? God forbid. The flat contrary is a ruled caſe in diuinitie &amp; was ere wee were borne amongſt the learned and godly of al times. And as it were with one voyce they haue affirmed it in this and ſuch like ſort: That a Chriſtian man ſhould be ſory and grieued if he ſee that moſt holy Sacrament abuſed of any wicked and bad ones which are admitted vnto it, and indeuour as much as in him lieth, yt if may not be ſo, but yet may he not himſelfe depriue himſelfe of the Sacrament, nor withdrawe himſelfe from the Church, but both take it for a true Church notwithſtanding this blemiſh, and continue in her ſocietie and felowſhippe ſo long as the worde is preached, and the Sacraments adminiſtred therein, without any ſeparation from it for this cauſe. And the proofes hereof haue partly beene aledged before in the examples of the godly Patriarches, Prophetes, Apoſtles, and Chriſt

himſelfe. In the Church of Corinth, Galatia, Epheſus and others, wherein though there were great blemiſhes, as hath beene ſhewed, yet were they neuer commaunded one to auoyd an others company at thoſe exerciſes that the Lorde in common inioyned all, and left not to their libertie to vſe or not vſe: They ſeparated themſelues carefully from thoſe crimes and faultes that they rebuked and diſliked in others, but from their Churches and holy exerciſes, they ſeparated not themſelues, but entred into their Synagogues at al times, whereſoeuer they came, and when they were at prayers, prayed with them, preached to them, and partaked with them in commaunded dueties, neither were they once hurt by their ſo doing. Then further may we adde in this matter of communicants that which truly we ſhould not lightly weigh or conſider, but very earneſtly thinke of. Namely that wee are bidden to examine our ſelues when we come to that table. If the Lord had pleaſed,
                        1. Cor. 11.
                      he could as eaſily haue bidden vs examine one on other, or euery man the whole Church. And certainly he would haue done it, if other mens

ſinnes might haue defiled vs, and the company of the vnworthy ones haue polluted them that come with the very beſt preparation of themſelues vnto it. Yea and with what diligence in deede ought wee all to doe it, if this doctrine were true. Surely my conſcience coulde neuer receiue that Sacrament in peace except I knewe all men as well as my ſelfe, ſince their euell may as well hurt mee as myne owne.
                        Caluin inſtitut. 4. booke 1.15. reade it all.
                      But nowe that he requireth only of euery man the proofe of themſelues, he teacheth therby playnely that it nothing hurteth vs if any vnworthy doe thruſt themſelues in amongeſt vs, ſo that wee bee prepared, the ſame do theſe other wordes alſo. Sibi iudicium manducat.

                      Hee eateth and drinketh his owne damnation. Sibi non tibi. His owne damnation, not thyne, ſaith Auſten. Ergo tolera malos bonus, vt venias ad praemia bonorum, ne mittaris in penam malorum.
                      Therefore thou being good, indure the euell, that thou mayeſt come to the rewards of the good, and not be ſent vnto the puniſhment of the euell.

                     Caluin thought this a ſtrong place againſt this temptation, therefore he vrgeth both theſe members

againſt it fully. In theſe wordes of Saint Paul, ſayth he, two things are to be noted. Firſt that to eate the bread of the Lord vnworthyly, is not to communicate in their company that are vnworthy, but not rightly to prepare our ſelues, and to weigh our owne faith and repentance. Secondly that when we will receyue this Sacrament we beginne not with others, and fall in examining them, but that we trye our ſelues, &amp; ſet our eyes that way. For truely if all things bee conſidered well, they that haue ſo much leaſure to examine others, in them ſelues they are moſt negligent and forgetfull. For vppon mine owne experience, ſayth hee, I know one yet aliue, that caried headlong with this nicenes that hee would not receyue with vs for ſome mens faults that pleaſed him not, he ſeparated himſelfe quite from our company. And yet in the meane tyme had them in his owne houſe of moſt lewde behauiour. When I knewe it, I got one to admoniſh him (for of my ſelfe ſayth Maſter Caluin hee woulde take nothing) and to aſke what he meant to be ſo ſtrict in the Church, a houſe not in his gouernement, and ſo faultie in his owne

houſe where hee had gouernement. Muſt hee needes bee defiled in the Church by vnworthy communicants, and cleere at home from ſo neere euill. And it pleaſed God to worke with him, ſayth he, that he ſawe his folly, and afterwarde reconciled himſelfe both to the Church and mee, confeſſing at laſt, that our chiefe and firſt care muſt bee of our ſelues and our familie, next and ſecondly of others. And howe? Not for diſlike of thē, or hatred, becauſe they do not ſo well as they ought, to ſeparate our ſelues from the Church, but to correct them and amend them, and to bring them into the way, or according to our places to procure their remouing if they will not. Or if wee cannot effect that, then to leaue all to the Lord to performe and make better. Thus farre Maſter Caluin, not vnworthy our earneſt noting, though it be very long. And truely marke it againe, that in ſaying his owne damnation, he tyeth the harme that commeth by his vnworthy receyuing to himſelfe, and ſtretcheth it not to others, which yet needes he muſt haue done, if the company of any at that table did defile the godly. Hee muſt haue ſayd, hee eateth and

drinketh to his owne damnation, and all others that receiue with him &amp; knowe him. But God forbid. Then, was euer the Sacrament more holy &amp; purely adminiſtred, than Chriſt Ieſus him-ſelfe did with his diſciples? Yet euen there and then,
                        Bullingers reaſons of his preſence. cōtrae Anabap. pag. 230.
                      ſayth Ambroſe, Chryſoſtome, Auſten &amp; others was wicked Iudas. For the Euangeliſtes ſay, he ſate downe with the twelue, and Luke maketh mention that Chriſt admoniſhed him partly before, and partly after Supper, which the Lord Ieſus would neuer haue ſuffered, if his company might haue defiled the other worthy receyuers there preſent. And concerning Iudas, I pray you conſider what the ſcripture ſaith. Firſt it was ſayde of him before the Supper, that he was a thiefe and caried the bag, and for that cauſe grudged the expence of the oyntment,
                        Iohn. 1

                           .
                      and ſayd it might haue bene ſold and giuen to the poore, not in deede &amp; trueth caring for the poore. In regarde wherof Auſten ſayth,
                        Aug in Iohn tract. 50.
                        
                      
                     Iudas was not then firſt euell when hee made his match to betray him for ſo much money, but before euen from the firſt beginning, neuer folowing Chriſt corde, ſed corpore, with heart, but

with body.
                  Secondly, it is teſtified in Luke, that before the Supper the Deuill was entred into him,
                        Luc. 22.3.
                      and that hee had beene with the high Prieſtes and Captaines, and made his matche with them, communing with them howe hee might betray Chriſte vnto them.
                        Math. 26.23. &amp;c.
                      Thirdly, euen to the Diſciples them-ſelues openly at table was manifeſted by giuing of a ſoppe that hee was a Traytor, and ſhould ſhewe it vpon his owne maſter. Therefore it was not altogether hid what manner of man Iudas was. Yet (ſaith S. Auſten) Talis Iudas cū ſanctis diſcipulis vndecim intrabat, &amp; exibat: ad ipſam dominicā coenā pariter acceſſit: de vno pane &amp; Petrus &amp; Iudas accepit.
                      Such a Iudas went in and came out with the eleuen, came to the ſame ſupper of the Lord with them, and of the one breade receiued both Peter and Iudas. Quid ergo voluit Dominus noſter Ieſus Chriſtus (fratres mei) admonere eccleſiam ſuam, quando vnum perditum inter duodecim habere voluit, niſi vt malos toleremus, ne corpus Christi diuidamus.
                      What therefore would the Lord Ieſus Chriſt (my Brethren) admoniſh

and teach his Church, when amongſt his twelue he would haue one loſt and bad one, but that in the Church militant heere we muſt indure ſome euil ones, leaſt in not doing it, wee ſhould rent aſunder and deuide the body of Chriſte. Conuerſari enim cum eis potuit Judas, eos inquinare non potuit: For, be in theyr company Iudas might, but defile them he coulde not. Wee ſee therefore this fathers iudgement touching this matter plainly, and to it may be added this queſtion,
                        1. Cor. 7.13.
                      howe the faythfull wife may abide with an vnfaythfull huſband all the dayes of her life, and not bee the worſe: and we may not come to Gods table, or to prayers for an hower, in ye company of vnreformed ones, but their ſinnes ſhal cleaue to vs. The companyings together differeth moſt greatly, if wee marke the ſeuerall circumſtances, of a wife with her huſband, and of two men in the church together. How then may we be warranted to refrayne that moſt holy &amp; comfortable ſacrament, for their ſakes, who thogh they be treſpaſſers, yet aſk they mercy at Gods hands, Et hoc testantur, eo ipſo quod accedunt ad coenā. And teſtify as much euen by

their very comming and offering themſelues to the Lordes table. To iudge rightly of our Brethren, our corruption aſſuredly is great, and we ſhould often thinke of it, and feare it greatly. By nature we are full of ſuſpition, and aſwell where no cauſe in trueth is, as where cauſe is. Wee beleeue euill too faſt, and good too ſlowly. We amplify things, and make ſmal matters great matters, iudging men many times worſe through our corruption, than indeede they are before God by their tranſgreſſion. And how dangerous a rule then is this, to meaſure them by, that muſt bee alowed to the Lords table, if we receiue with them. Whē this temptation was ſtrong in the minds of the Anabaptiſtes, remember how crookedly this line guided them in the choyſe of worthy receiuers. If any man (ſayth Bullinger) hang down his head,
                        Lib. 6. cap. 9. Anabap.
                      and counterfet humilitie, although in minde hee bee moſt polluted, filthy, and foule, and deſpiſe the word, yet ſhall he bee accounted a moſt holy and good one, and worthy to receiue the ſacrament. But if he be more open and mery, and ſubiect to the common faults of humane frayltie, yet farre from any diſſimulation,

truſting in his heart and ſoule firmely to the Lords mercy, ſingle and ſincere towardes God, that that he is, confeſſing his ſinnes: ſuch an one, foraſmuch as hee hath not yet ſatiſfied the Anabaptiſtes for his faults, neither is alowed of them, &amp; thought as yet worthy ynough, ſhal bee ſeperated from the Lords table. And yet the ſinful publican ſmiting his breſt,
                        Luc. 18.
                      was better alowed of the Lord Ieſus, than the iuſt Phariſie with all his righteouſnes. When many vncleane did eate of the paſſeouer which Ezekias the king cauſed to be kept,
                        2. Chron. 30.
                      did their Brethren refuſe to eate becauſe they did eat alſo, or did their company pollute them that were clean any thing? Conſider it wel, and ſee if you can finde either: yet the parties themſelues that were not ſanctified and cleanſed, faulted, and were prayed for. Wherefore we may ſay with Saint Auſten, Non propter malos bonos deſeramus, ſed propter bonos malos ſufferamus.
                      Let vs not forſake the good for the euil, but let vs indure the euill for the good. Yet muſt we thinke Saint Auſten and all good men wiſheth their ſeperation as farre as may be without plucking vp the wheat

alſo, &amp; renting a ſunder the body of Chriſt. And ſo playnely ſhewe thoſe woordes. Si non poſſunt excludi, excludantur vel de corde. If they cannot bee excluded, exclude them at leaſt in thy heart: that is, approue not in heart and iudgement their fault. Cyprianus &amp; alia frumenta dominica cum auaris &amp; rapacibus, cum his qui regnū Dei non poſſidebunt, non laicis, vel quibuſcunque clericis, ſed &amp; ipſis epiſcopis panem Domini manducabant. Cyprian
                      and others of the Lordes wheate did eate the breade of the Lord, and drinke his cuppe with the couetous and raueners, with them that ſhal not poſſeſſe Gods kingdome, not lay men, or common Clergie men, but euen with the Biſhops themſelues. And it ſufficed them to bee ſeparated from ſuch in heart, in life, and manners, in a great regarde to keepe peace and vnitie for the good of the weake, leaſt they ſhould teare the members of the body of Chriſt by ſacrilegious ſchiſmes. Caluin writeth to Farellus in an Epiſtle, that being aſked this queſtion whether it was lawfull to receiue the communion at a bad miniſters handes, and with bad company admitted thereunto, hee anſwered to

both in effect as followeth. Tantum debere inter Chriſtianos eſſe odium ſchiſmatis, vt ſemper, quoad licet, refugiant. Tantam miniſterij ac ſacramentorum reuerentiam eſſe oportere, vt vbicunque extare haec cernant, eccleſiam eſſe cenſeant, &amp;c. That there ought to be in Chriſtians ſuch a deteſtation of Schiſme, that as neere as they may, they euer flye it. Again, that there ought to bee ſuch a reuerence of the miniſterie and of the ſacraments, that where ſo euer they ſee theſe extant, there they acknowledge the Church to bee. For as much therefore as by Gods permiſſion the Church is gouerned by theſe men, what manner of perſons ſoeuer they bee, if they ſee the notes of the Church there, it ſhall bee better not to ſeparate themſelues from the communion. Neither hurteth it, that ſome vntrue doctrine is there deliuered. For there is hardly any Church that hath not ſome reliques of ignorance. It ſufficeth vs if the doctrine wheron the Church is founded haue his place, and be kept. Neither ſtoppe wee at this, that hee cannot bee accompted a lawefull Paſtour, which hath not onely crept, but moſt wickedly broken

into the place of a true miniſter. For it is not fit that euery priuate man ſhould trouble himſelfe with theſe ſcruples. Sacramenta cum eccleſia communicant. The Sacraments they receiue with the Church. Per eorum manus ſibi diſpenſari ſuſtinent. Only by their handes they indure them to be deliuered. For, whō they ſee to haue the places, whether lawfully or vnlawfully they haue them (although the matter ſomwhat appertayne to them) yet may they ſuſpend their iudgement thereof till a full knowledge bee had.
                        Note.
                      Therefore if they vſe their miniſterie, yet is there no daunger, leaſt they ſhoulde ſeeme either to acknowledge or allowe, or confirme the ſame for good. But by this meanes they giue a teſtimonie of their patience, whilſt they are content to indure thoſe, whom they iudge worthy of condemnation euen by a ſolemne iudgement. Thus farre maſter Caluin. Somewhat long, but truely very materiall to the poynt wee nowe ſpeake of, if humilitie woorke a reuerence of other mens iudgments, eſpecially that haue abounded with the great graces of God, to the profiting of the Church, and puffing pride doth

not dangerouſly perſwade vs that no man ſeeth the trueth of GOD but our ſelues, which God forbid. Bullinger agayne deliuered it boldly to the people of God in his time, and after that, qui ſaepe admonitus dolo vtitur, non eccleſiam, Dominum, aut miniſtrum decipit, ſed ſe ipſum, &amp; ipſi iudicium manducat. Whoſoeuer admoniſhed often, yet diſſembleth and vſeth guile, hee deceyueth not the Church, hee deceyueth not the Lorde, nor the miniſter, but hee deceyueth himſelfe, and to his owne damnation hee eateth. Meaning that none could bee hurt by the company of any that communicate with them, themſelues being right. And therefore meaning to proſecute this queſtion no further, in a comfortable hope I neede not. I conclude both with the iudgement and very wordes of Maſter Caluin in his inſtitutions remembred before. Fixum igitur vtrumque iſtorum maneat:
                        Calu. inſtitut. lib. 4. cap. 1. ſect. 19.
                        
                      Therfore let both theſe thinges remaine firmely fixed: firſt, that he hath no excuſe, that of his owne will forſaketh the outward communion of the Church, where the worde of God is preached and the Sacraments adminiſtred: then, that the faultes of a few or

many, are no hinderance, but that we may therein rightly profeſſe our fayth by the ceremonies inſtituted by God. Becauſe a godly conſcience is not hurt by the vnworthynes of any other, either Paſtor or priuat man, and the myſteries are to a holy &amp; vpright man, neuertheles pure and holeſome, though they bee together handled of vncleane men.
               
               
                  The fourth temptation concerning compulſion to good.
                  
                     LAſtly, there haue bin, and to this day are, that thinke men ſhoulde not bee compelled to fayth and religion. The Donatiſtes, Pelagians, and Anabaptiſtes in their ſeuerall times, the Papiſts ſtill dayly in their printed pamphlets. But as the reſt, ſo is this alſo, a ſubtile ſleight of a tempting deuill, to animate men vnto euill boldly. An vntrueth, in the word plainly refelled, and of the Church and Children of God truely inſtructed,
                        2. Chro. 14.4. chap. 15.13.34.32.
                      euer abhorred. The noble kings Aſa and Ioſia did conſtrayne and compell the people by ſeueritie of their Lawes &amp;

puniſhments to ſerue the Lorde. For, whoſoeuer will not ſeeke the God of Iſrael ſhall be ſlain, whether he be ſmal or great, man or woman, ſaith the text. Nebuchadnezzar made a decree that euery people,
                        Dan. 3.29.
                      nation and language, which ſpake any blaſphemy againſt the God of Sydrach, Myſach and Abednago, ſhould be drawne in peeces, and their houſes put to the moſt baſe vſe that might be. A very ſharpe law, I trowe, we will confeſſe to compell men to a dutie iuſt and godly. And if this heathen king, moued by Gods ſpirite did this, and might doe it, may not they that profeſſe religion do it? Nay, ſhall they not, as their knowledge and charge is greater, ſo ſuffer double puniſhment, if they do it not? Surely the trueth is playne, they ſhall. King Darius did the like in the ſame Prophet.
                        Dan. 6.26.
                      And I make a decree (ſayth he) that in all the dominion of my kingdome, men tremble and feare before the God of Daniel. For hee is the liuing God, and remaineth for euer, and his kingdome ſhall not periſh &amp;c. The King of Niniueh againe forced by his authoritie all men in the City to humble them ſelues before God: yea,
                        Ionas. 3.7.8.
                     
                     
(ſayth he) Let man and beaſt put on ſackcloth, and cry mightely vnto God. Which example Auſten vrged in his time againſt the Donatiſts,
                        Epiſt. 48.
                      and ſayth, the King of Niniuie did God good ſeruice by compelling the whole Citie to ſerue God. In the Goſpel the maſter ſayd to the ſeruant:
                        Luk. 14.23.
                      
                     Go out into the high wayes and hedges, &amp; compell thē to come in, that my houſe may be filled: Ne
                              
                                 
                              
                              que
                            abſque cauſa ſic loquitur Dominus. Quia enim diuerſi hominum mores, ingenia item diuerſa ſunt, non eadem docendi aut praedicandi ratio omnibus conuenit, Sunt enim quibus ſimplicem institutionem &amp; doctrinam adhibuiſſe ſufficit, aliis admonitione ſeueriore, multis adhortatione, imo correptione &amp; obiurgatione acriore opus eſt. Et ideo ſuprà, verbi miniſtros exactorum ſimiles dixit.
                      Neither did the Lord without good cauſe (ſayth a learned interpreter) ſpeake after this ſort.
                        Maiſter Gualter in Math. 22.
                      For diuers men being of diuers manners and diſpoſitions, one and the ſame way of preaching agreeeth not to them all. Some it ſufficeth to haue doctrine plainely deliuered to them, others muſt haue earneſt admonition alſo, &amp; many muſt haue exhortation, yea, ſharpe

rebukes and chidinges, or elſe they profite not. And therefore the Miniſters of God were compared before to Stewardes or Baylifes, that ſharply and roughly require their maſters rent for his Vineyarde, if it be wanting. Fit etiam ſaepenumero vt magiſtratus ſuam authoritatem interponere oporteat, quando multorum peruicacia tanta est, vt aliter vinci non poſſit. And many times it commeth to paſſe that the Magiſtrate muſt put in his authoritie,
                        Compulſion.
                      many mens ſtubbernnes beeing ſuch, &amp; ſo great, that it cannot otherwiſe be ouercome. See then how euen this place afordeth the doctrine which we ſpeak of moſt truly, namely, that the Magiſtrate may compel, whom the Preacher can not perſwade to ſerue God. What thought S. Auſten of this place? Heare and you ſhall ſee.
                        Epiſt. 48.
                      
                     Putas neminem debere cogi ad iuſticiam, cum legas patrem familias dixiſſe ſeruis, Quoſcunque inueneritis, cogite intrare? Doeſt thou think ſayth hee, (Vincentius) that no man may be compelled to goodneſſe, when as thou heareſt the maſter ſaying to his ſeruant, go forth, and compell them to come in, wherſoeuer ye finde? Againe, in his 50 Epiſtle,

                     204 epiſtle, and in diuerſe other places he gathereth out of this text this doctrine. Al other interpreters doe the like, olde and new, as occaſion ſerueth them. But faith, you wil ſay, cannot be forced. For it is the gift of God,
                        Ihon. 6.
                      &amp; no man commeth to Chriſte except the father drawe him. And what then? Therefore no man may be compelled to come to the preaching of the worde, and to frequent commaunded exerciſes? Let Schollers make that argument to their maſter, and ſay learning is the gift of God, and cannot be had except he giue it, therefore they may not be beaten, if they learne not. Let ſeruants alleage, that ability to do their duties commeth from God, and therfore they may not bee looked to. Let the theefe ſay, to bee a true man is a gift that God giueth, therefore he may not bee hanged, if he ſteale. Shall they eſcape by theſe reaſons? I trowe not. Therefore wee anſwere, it followeth not. For although faith be the gift of God, yet doth the Lorde vſe meanes. And although the will can not be forced, yet may it be contained within dutie, that it doe not any thing with offence contrary to religion. And as we ſee in other

things, that they that are giuen to theft, drunkenneſſe, and other filthy pollutions of the body or ſoule, cannot bee compelled by mans power to change their inward mindes, &amp; to eſteeme of thoſe things according to their nature, and yet many by lawes be reſtreyned from outward facts: ſo though by mans might no minde can be indewed with fayth, yet may open behauiour be reſtrayned, amended, and reformed, and wicked contemners bee compelled to hear ſermons, to come to prayers, &amp; to frequent ye publike aſſēblies at times appointed. Which outward forced obediēce, may, (God pleaſe,) work inwarde willing obedience in time. For it hath done it often, as thouſands of experiences proue. But if it do not, through the incurable obſtinacie of ſome, which ſay as Auſten noteth: ſic volo errare, ſic volo perire,
                     
                        Epiſt. 204.
                      yet may not ſo ſoueraigne a ſalue be omitted, by them that ought to apply it,
                        Epiſt. 48.
                      as ye ſame father alſo noteth. It was ſayd to Peter, Whether I go thou cāſt not follow me now, but thou ſhalt follow me afterward.
                     
                        Ihon. 13.36.
                      And ſo may it be with others, by the Lordes bleſſing of meanes, that what coulde not bee in one

time, may be in other to the good and comfort of many. For as the light of doctrine auayleth to rid away error from iudgement, ſo doth feare of puniſhmēt, in many, helpe to reforme the practiſe of life againſt good order.
                        Epiſt 48. pag. 174.
                      
                     Mea primitus ſententia erat &amp;c. My ſelfe was once of this mind (ſayth S. Auſten) that I thought no man ought to be forced to Chriſtian vnity, but that we ſhould deale by perſwaſion, ſtriue by diſputing, conquer by reaſoning, leaſte they prooued diſſembling Catholiques, whome we know profeſſed heretikes. But this opinion of mine was ouerthrowne not with wordes of gaineſaying, but with examples of euident proofe. And firſt mine own Citie was obiected againſt me, which beeing wholy ouer-runne with the hereſie of Donatiſme, was reclaymed and brought againe to the trueth with the feare of good imperiall lawes in that caſe prouided. &amp;c. Many others alſo were layd before me in like ſorte reformed by good lawes. So that I ſawe it true, that by feare of that which he would be loath to ſuffer, a man may bee brought either to relinquiſh that former ſtifneſſe that hindred him, or to acknowledge an vnknowne truth before, &amp;c. Terror

enim temporalium potestatum, quando veritatem oppugnat, iustis fortibus glorioſa probatio eſt, infirmis periculoſa tentatio: quandò autem veritatem praedicat errantibus &amp; diſcordantibus, cordatis vtilis admonitio eſt, &amp; inſenſatis inutilis afflictio. The feare of temporall power when it oppugneth truth, is to the iuſt that are ſtrong a glorious tryall, and to the weake a daungerous temptation: but when it preacheth truth to them that are in error and do diſagree, to the wiſe it is a profitable admonition, and to the fooliſh an vnprofitable affliction. Yet is there no power but of God, and he that reſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the ordinance of God. Whilſt men be mad in the ſtrength of their vngodly humour, they rayle of al compulſion to the contrarie, but hauing got vnderſtanding, and ſeeing from what euilles they are deliuered by thē that firſt forced them, they reioyce that euer ſo well to their great good they were chaſtiſed, and that wholeſome vyolence that before with bitter wordes they inueighed againſt, they then commend and praiſe vnfaynedly. Foris igitur inueniatur neceſſitas, naſcitur intus voluntas. Without therefore

let there bee compulſion, willingneſſe groweth within. That is, ſpare not hardly ſometimes to compell men to doe vnwillingly, what by ſuch force they ſhall happely better looke into, and then performe with all willingneſſe. If no man may bée compelled to goodneſſe, why doth the wiſeman ſo often ſpeake of correction, ſaying: he that ſpareth the rodde hateth his childe, and hee that beateth him ſaueth his ſoule.
                  
                     
                        The ſecond obiection.
                     Yea, but whom compelled Chriſt euer, ſay they. He preached and taught, and went no further. Did he ſo, ſaith Auſten. Haue they not Paule an example of the contrarie? Agnoſcant in eo prius cogentem Chriſtum, &amp; poſtea docentem, prius ferientem, &amp; postea conſolantem. Let them there ſee Chriſt, firſt compelling, and afterwarde teaching, firſt ſtriking and then comforting. And he that entred into the Goſpell conſtrayned with bodily puniſhment, labored more than al thoſe that were called only by mouth.
                  But men may not be compelled againſt their conſcience.
                        The third obiection.
                      A pretie ground of all Libertiniſme, and an high way to ouerthrow all eſtates vnder heauen. For what good

can bee commaunded or what euill forbidden, that this excuſe may not bee layd agaynſt. The Apoſtle ſayth, the Magiſtrate beareth not the ſword for naught: but ſure if an erronious and deceiued conſcience, liking or diſliking may bee a iuſt warrant to doe or not doe, the Magiſtrate may put vp his ſword, and let it there continue, for any vſe he ſhall haue of it, euery thing being auoyded with this, my conſcience is ſo, and I may not be forced againſt my conſcience. But let vs not be deceiued. The Lord will ſurely ſmite euery ſeruant that doth not his will, whether he knowe or knowe not,
                        Luc. 12.
                      becauſe his ignoraunce is not of creation, but from Adam by fall, neither ſhall any good meaning erroniouſly had, excuſe any man, more than it did the Iewes, which ignorantly crucifying Chriſt, and perſecuting the Apoſtles, were perſwaded they did God great ſeruice. And as God doth thus, ſo doth he require of the Magiſtrates hand, to whom in deede he hath committed the ſword not in vayne, that (after the procuring of ſuch meanes for their inſtruction by publique preaching and priuat perſwaſions, as our Sauiour hath appoynted for

the calling of men from their errors to the knowledge of his truth) they forbeare not, either to require godly duetie, or to puniſh the want, as the offence ſhall deſerue, not fearing the ſpeeches of men, for the glorie of God, neither diſpleaſing him to pleaſe them. If they crye, as they do, it is crueltie, crueltie, and enough to driue men to diſpayre. Wee can but wiſh them the beſt, ſtill houlding a truth our ſelues, and doing in moderation and mercie what ſhall make vs diſpayre if wee doe not: God requiring it of vs at our perill. And at their owne peril muſt it be if they take darknes for light, and light for darknes. Surely their bloud is vpon themſelues, becauſe they haue bin warned and had the meanes. S. Auſten will tell them, the Donatiſtes ſlew themſelues rather then they would change their hereſie: yet did not ſuch their feareful madneſſe terrifie godly Princes from condigne chaſtiſements of ſo great impietie. And thus much may ſuffice of this temptation. If any liſt to be further ſatiſ

                     aunder, which in deede would neuer be ſo vntruely made if men would not fooliſhly thinke, pro eccleſia Dei facere quicquid inquieta temeritate faciūt, that euery thing is done in the cauſe of the Church that is done by their owne vnquiet raſhneſſe and headineſſe. For the matter it ſelfe it hath bene anſwered, &amp; it truly may be anſwered, that euery one that ſpareth is not a friend, neither euery one that beateth a foe. But better are the wounds of a friend than the voluntarie kiſſes of an enemie. Melius eſt cum ſeueritate diligere, quàm cum lenitate decipere. Better it is with ſeueritie to loue, than with lenitie to deceiue. Can man loue man more than God loueth him? Yet in the loue of GOD there is often correction, and often

chaſtiſement, and the ſame, though neuer ioyous for the preſent,
                        Heb. 12.11.
                      but greeuous, yet after bringeth the quiet fruit of righteouſneſſe, vnto them which are thereby exerciſed, and they ſay with the Prophet: It is good for them that they haue bene chaſtiſed. Why then muſt mans compulſion euer be perſecution? Cùm boni &amp; mali eadem faciunt, eademque patiuntur, non factis &amp; poenis, ſed cauſis vtique diſcernendi ſunt. When the good and euill either doe, or ſuffer the ſame things, they muſt be diſcerned and diſtinguiſhed, not by puniſhments, but by cauſes. Pharoh was ſharpe in ſundrie actions to the Iſraelites, and what was Moſes when he made them drinke vp the aſhes of their golden calfe,
                        Exod. 32.
                      and three thouſand of them to bee ſlayne with the ſworde ſpeedely: When his anger ſeemed fearce agaynſt Aaron himſelfe, and the people quaked as it were vnder him. Similia fecerunt, ſed non ſimiliter prodeſſe voluerunt. The things they did after a ſort were like, for they were both ſharpe, but their minds were not alike to profite. And therefore what Pharoh did was tyrannicall perſecution, what Moſes did lawful, and liked puniſhment

of a greeuous fault. Ieſabel ſlew ſome Prophets, and Eliah ſlew ſome Prophets. Sed diuerſa merita facientium, diuerſa paſſorum. But diuers was the merit both of the doers and ſufferers. Ieſabel ſlew true Prophets, and it was a bloudie perſecution. Eliah ſlew falſe Prophets, and it was no perſecution, as we ſpeake of the word in euill part. In the death of Chriſt God had his work, and man had his work. Yet was God pure, &amp; man guiltie. How? Niſi quia in re vna quam fecerunt, cauſa nō erat vna ob quam fecerunt. But becauſe in one thing which they did, there was not one cauſe for which they did it. There were three croſſes at our Sauiours death: vpon one the theefe to bee ſaued, vpon an other the theefe to bee damned, in the middle Chriſt. Quid ſimilius istis crucibus, quid diſſimilius istis pendentibus? Quos paſſio iungebant, cauſa ſeparabat. What more like than theſe croſſes? What more vnlike than theſe that hanged vpō them. Whom a like puniſhment conioyned, a farre vnlike cauſe diſioyned. Paule was deliuered to the Iayler, to be impriſoned:
                        Act. 16.
                      
                     
                        1. Cor. 5.
                      
                     Paule him ſelfe would the inceſtuous to bee deliuered

to Satan to bee reformed. The one is a greater matter than the other, and yet the leſſer a wicked perſecution, the greater none. Diſcamus igitur, frater. Let vs therefore learne brother, ſaith S. Auſten, in like doings to diſcerne vnlike mindes of the doers, neither let vs with cloſed eyes ſclaunder, and accuſe well willers, as euil hurters of vs. If it were euer ſo glorious as ſome would make it, to be puniſhed, and to ſuſtayne correction, the Lord might haue ſayd, bleſſed are they that are ſo vſed, and neuer haue added propter iustitiam, for righteouſneſſe ſake. Wherefore an euident truth it is, that they are not Martyrs that ſuffer puniſhment for euill doing, &amp; propter Christianae vtilitatis impiam diuiſionem, and for a wicked diuiſion of Chriſtian vnitie, but they yt ſuffer for well doing, and for righteouſneſſe ſake. Agar was puniſhed of Sara, yet ſhe that puniſhed was blameleſſe, &amp; ſhe that was puniſhed blameworthie. Therefore doth the Prophet ſay, Iudica me Deus, &amp; diſcerne cauſam: non dixit poenam, ſed cauſam. Iudge mee, O Lord,

                     they perſecuted me without a cauſe, but the Lord was my helper. His cōfort and glorie is not that hee was perſecuted, but that in deede and truth it was without a a cauſe. Dauid himſelfe purſued his enemies, tooke them, and conſumed them.

Yet no perſecutor more than all other Kings and Princes, both in the word, and out, renowned for due and zealous puniſhing of offences. In his enim omnibus quid attenditur, niſi quis eorum pro veritate, quis pro iniquitate, quis nocendi cauſa, quis emendandi. For in all men that puniſh &amp; execute lawes vpon any, what is to bee conſidered, but which of them doth it for the maintenance of truth, which of them for the maintenance of euill, which of them with a mind to hurt, which of them with a minde to refourme.

And let this ſuffice for ſome ſatiſfaction to a cauſeleſſe cry and moſt vnworthy complaint, when ſo euer it is made.
                  I very well ſee, theſe temptations in iudgement are many, and therefore your ſpeech might bee long, if you would followe them, but theſe may ſuffice for a taſt of Satans malice in reſpect, and you may nowe, if your ſelfe will proceede to his temptations in life and behauiour.
                  They alſo, as hath bene ſaid, are in number moe, and in nature more vnknowne, than that of any one man, they may bee either named, or vnderſtood. For there is no

commandement, the breaches whereof in euery branch hee tempteth not ſome vnto, and what a field were this to runne a very long courſe in? Hee tempteth to adulterie, fornication, vncleannes, wantonnes, Idolatrie, witchcraft, hatred, debate, emulations, wrath, contentions, ſeditions, enuy, murthers, drunkennes, gluttony, and ten thouſand ſuch like. So that to followe the temptations in life and behauiour, and to lay downe what might bee ſayde, eyther in deſcription of their manner, or as helpe againſt their ſtrength and venom, were to take in hand to write many volumes. This is certaine, he is our enemy,
                        1. Pet. 5.
                      and ſo firme a friend as he is a fo, were worth much gold, euen of the gold of Ophir. In which enmitie, and immortall malice of his,
                        verſ. 9.
                      hee goeth about like a roaring Lion, ſeeking whome he may deuoure. But if wee reſiſt him ſtedfaſt in fayth, he flyeth from vs. With which ſhield of fayth together with the ſworde of the ſpirite, the word of God,
                        Epheſ. 6.
                      we ſhal quench al his fierie darts, and become conquerors. And the beſt meanes to helpe vs in theſe many thouſand ſpirituall onſettes, and to ſtrengthen body and ſoule againſt the killing

poyſon of them, after auoyding of all occaſions, ſo much as euer we may, ſtil truly diſcharging our ſeuerall places, both towards God &amp; man, is to print in our harts, and ſinke into our ſoules, a true, an often, and earneſt meditation of the ende of the thing or thinges, whatſoeuer that we ſhall in this reſpect be tempted &amp; ſolicited vnto. For the wiſe Syrach vpō deepe experience hath ſayd it. Whatſoeuer thou takeſt in hand,
                     
                        Eccleſ. 7.36.
                      
                     remember the end, &amp; thou ſhalt neuer do amiſſe. The end of ſin is death, the reward of ſinne is death, death of body many a tyme by a ſhamefull ende in this world, and death of both body and ſoule in a bottomeleſſe pit for euer, where is weeping, and wayling, and gnaſhing of teeth. Sweete meate will haue a ſower ſawſe ſayde the prouerbe then, and ſweete ſinne bringeth ſmarting payne, ſayth the trueth now. What wo to themſelues, and to their ſeede for euer brought that faire fruit with pleaſure eaten, when time was, of our firſt parents. Would God, no poſteritie might rue the falles of them whome they loued. Surely if the end preuailed in the thought, before ſinne preuailed in act, they ſhoulde

rue them leſſe. O deed done, howe bitterly biteth it when it is done, that was thought full ſweete before it was done, and nowe ſore lamented that euer done, or that again it cannot bee vndone. But had I knowne commeth euer behind, too late to comfort, too ſoone to wring, and euer ſinne rubbeth vppon the rawe. Before theſe our parents ſhould ſinne, honour, preferment, glory and ioy were brought by a helliſh ſerpent to muſter themſelues before their eyes: and Gods ſhall you be, if you will do this. But O woful Gods, when the deede was done. Then muſtred as faſt before their minde, death, hell, damnation, the wrath of God, and all terrour and torture. And ſo is it euer: that deuill that pleadeth all mercie and goodnes, patience, and long ſuffering in the Lord towardes ſinners before they offend, vpon boldnes thereof, to make them offende, that deuill as faſt thundreth damnation and death, iuſtice and wrath in the ſame Lorde, when once we haue offended. Eſpecially if wee begin to ſlacke our diligent ſeruing of his filthy humor. O Dauid ſpeake and inſtruct a litle.
                        2. Sam. 24.2.
                      What thoughteſt thou when Ioab muſt go number

all Iſrael and Iudah? Of wiſedome &amp; pollicie to know my power. What felteſt thou when the deede was done? Securitie for a time, and all was well. But when God awaked, what? O aſke mee not that: For the remembrance of it as yet is grieuous vnto me. But if you wil needs know. I was ſmitten,
                        verſ. 10.
                      I was bittē, I was wounded and wroung with the very furies of hel. My fleſh quaked, my heart aked, and my ſoule admitted feares vppon feares. My conſcience cried, my Spirit groned, and the worlde knewe not what I felt within. Were mine eyes open, or were they ſhut, the eyes of my minde ſtill ſawe my ſinne, and the face of Iuſtice in a mightie God againſt it. The reſt I found was to accuſe my ſelfe, and with ſobbing ſighes, and briniſh teares, to vtter my fall as I could for woe in words, of griefe to a gracious God, I haue ſinned,
                        verſ. 10.
                      I haue ſinned, O my God and deere, in that I haue done, exceedingly, nowe Lorde I beſeech thee take away the treſpaſſe of thy ſeruaunt, for I haue done very fooliſhly. And what ſhoulde I ſay? the end was mercie, yet mingled with Iuſtice, I was brought into a wonderfull

ſtreyt, by an offer that was made. And whoſoeuer ſinneth, ſtreyt in the ende, either leſſe or more, as God appoynteth, is the flower that bloweth vpon ſuch a ſtalke, and ſo I leaue you. Well then wee heare, what we were better to heare, then euer to feele as hee felt it. For his heart ſmote him,
                        verſ. 10.
                      ſmote him, ſayth the text, and the woorde importeth a twitching ſmart. Dauid felt the fruites of other falles alſo, if we remē
                     ber them, and preacheth vnto vs to take heede of the pleaſures of ſinne for a ſeaſon. But I ſpeake not of all. And what leaſt is ſpoken, yet let it not leaſt bee thought of. For who ſo is wiſe will conſider theſe thinges, it is a ſaying often repeated in Scripture. Do wee thinke Manaſſes felt when hee was firſt moued to ſinne, what he felt in a ſtrength when God reclaimed? Peruſe his repentance and prayer, &amp; iudge your ſelfe, if he had found ſinne firſt, as hee founde it laſt, whether euer hee woulde ſo greatly haue folowed the cauſe of his woe. Did that thriftleſſe youth find all as faire when his bag was ſpent, &amp; a lewde courſe runne, as when hee firſt receiued it, and began to ſinne. No, no, his pleaſure had paine

both without, and within, and a ſhort vagare beyond the liſts of the Lords good liking, layde a grinding, a griefe vpon his conſcience during life. Peter felt not when hee denied, what hee felt when hee wept for woe, and that moſt bitterly, that euer hee had denied. The Iewes felt not when they crucified Chriſt, what they felt ful ſharpe when they were pricked in their hearts.
                        Act. 2.37.
                      Neuer, neuer, ſhall we bee without ſmart in the end, bee the beginning or proceſſe neuer ſo ſweete. And the Lord knoweth the meaſure. For circumſtances of action may pull greater and greater meaſure of plagues from a iuſt God, that hateth impuritie. Happy is the ſoule that ſinneth leaſt, next, that returneth ſooneſt, and moſt dreadfull is the eſtate of them that both for qualitie and time are left to the deuils malice and their owne corruption. One droppe of water to coole my tongue, was a wofull cry, and beware the like. All temptations of this kinde, bring vs moſt readily to this perplexitie. Thinke not you ſhall when you will, if you will not when you may. Herod and Pilate had their warnings with many mo. Herod and Pilate
                     
woulde not bee warned with many moe. Therefore Herod and Pilate were truely plagued with many moe. The longer you let your ſhip leake, when once ſhe leaketh, the greater danger, and the hardlier emptied. The ruinous houſe doth ſhewe the like. The further the nayle of ſinne, and ſome vile delight is driuen in with the deuils hammer, the hardlier got out with ye Lords aduiſe, which yet not profiting, killeth, becauſe it was not ſuffered to plucke it out. The Poet alſo ſayde it well. If thou beeſt ſicke, preuent the worſt, and ſeeke for remedy at the firſt, for when a ſickenes hath taken roote, if thou take phiſicke, it wil not boote. Thus thinke you then of all temptations in life together, and their ende conſidered they ſhal bee weake, through God that helpeth.
                  Nowe I pray you, what meane theſe wordes, But deliuer vs from euill?
                  
                  It is an explication, as hath bin ſaid of the former, &amp; the firſt word (Deliuer) teacheth vs playnly that we are the ſeruantes of ſinne, and euen ſold vnder ſinne, as the Apoſtle ſayth. The fall of our firſt parēts hath ſo made vs,
                        Rom 7.14.
                      and humilitie of heart euer

ſo confeſſeth it. Secondly that our deliuerance therehence commeth not from our ſelfe, or the power of any will or might in vs, but onely and euer from this God, that we pray to, from his power, from his goodneſſe and mercy, that hath no meaſure.
                        Epheſ. 2.1.
                      We are dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes of our ſelues, and wee can no more helpe our ſelues from ſinne, than from death. If that ſonne ſhall make you free (ſayth the Goſpel) then ſhall you be free indeede.
                        Iohn. 8.36.
                      By the ſecond word (Euill) ſome vnderſtande Satan, ſome ſinne, ſome death, but the beſt is to comprehende in it all euilles, both of crime and paine, whether they bee preſent or to come. Cyprian ſo expoundeth it in theſe wordes: In the laſt place wee put, but deliuer vs from euill, comprehending all kindes of aduerſities, which the enimy worketh againſt vs in this world. Auguſtin ſo expoundeth it ſaying:
                        Aug. ad Probā 
                           
                              •
                           iduam.
                      
                     When we ſay Deliuer vs from euill, we admoniſh to conſider that wee are not as yet in that good caſe where we ſhall ſuffer no euill, and this which is laſt placed in the Lordes Prayer, is extended ſo farre, and ſo playnely, that a Chriſtian man

mooued with any kind of tribulation,
                     
                        With any kinde of tribulatiō marke it.
                      may in this petition ſigh, in this ſhed his teares, beginne heerein, continue heerein, and end his prayer heerein. Bucer, Muſculus, Vrſinus &amp; many mo thus expounde it. If any man will vnderſtand in it, cheefely, or by a principalitie, as it were the deuil, let him ſo do. 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         
                      For in deede he is the greateſt euill, and moſt peſtilent euill that wee neede to pray to be deliuered from. Therfore ſay ſome, when we deſire yt God will deliuer vs from euill, we deſire that he wil ſend no euill on vs, but deliuer vs from all euils, preſent and to come, both of crime &amp; paine. Secondly, that if he ſend on vs any eulles, yet that he would mitigate them in this life, and turne them vnto our ſaluation, that they may bee good and profitable vnto vs. Thirdly, that he will at length in the life to come, fully and perfectly deliuer vs, and wipe away euery teare from our eyes. Others ſay, we begge of the Lorde, that he would in mercie renewe vs dayly, that is, powre into our hearts more and more, a moſt true liking and longing after all righteouſneſſe, and a moſt vnfained hatred of all euill, by what name ſoeuer it

may be tearmed. And in the ſame vpholde vs ſtil, that we may increaſe, and neuer go backwarde. Sweete therefore euery way is this, as all elſe that hath bene ſayde before, and beſeeming well the mouth, heart, and ſoule of euery man and woman deſirouſe to pleaſe God. Deliuer vs, O bleſſed God, from all euill. For if thou turne thy face away,
                        Pſal. 30.
                      we ſhall be troubled, yea, ſore troubled, diſmayde, and feared, though but euen now wee ſayd, tuſh, this wealth ſhall neuer decay.
                  The Lord ſtand with vs, &amp; giue vs faith in our ſeuerall dangers to cleaue vnto him. For what hee biddeth aske, we may well aſſure our ſelues we ſhal receiue, if we aſke, and that is a great comfort. Thus much contenteth me nowe of this prayer. The Concluſion onelie remaineth, which if you will a little open, your labour is ended to my good, and the Lord repay it.
                  The concluſion is this, For thine is the kingdome, the power, and glory for euer and euer. Which being expreſſed of Mathew, though of others it bee omitted, yet muſt it carry his place with vs, as many

mo things doe, which one Euangeliſt noteth, and not another. The thing it ſelfe yeeldeth very great ſtrength to our fayth, as touching the receiuing of that we aſke, conteining in it three notable reaſons to that effect. The firſt is drawne from the duety of a King, which is, to heare his ſubiectes, to defende and preſerue them. And therefore, thine is the kindome, is as much as if we ſhould ſay, O Lorde, graunt our petitions, ſince thou art King, and haſt all thinges vnder thy rule, euen all euill, to ſuppreſſe it, and all good, to giue it, ſo farre as with thy good liking it may be for our good: &amp; ſince we are thy ſubiects, whō it hath pleaſed thee to take care of, euen ſince we hanged vpō our mothers breaſts. The ſecond reaſon is drawne from his power, which as it is infinite, ſo is it able to giue vs whatſoeuer we want. There is nothing too hard, nothing to great, which he cannot giue. Thine is the power, euen all power, might, and ſtrength, ioyned with goodneſſe, and therefore I faint not. The third reaſon is taken from the end or final cauſe. For thine is the glorie: that is, wee deſire theſe things for thy glory.
                        Vrſinus.
                      Of thée alone,

the true God and ſoueraine King, we deſire and expect all good thinges, and ſo we yeelde vnto thee this thy glory, and this thine honour, and profeſſe thee to bee the honour and fountain of al good things. And verily, becauſe this glory is due vnto thee, therefore doe wee deſire them of thee. Heare vs therefore, for thy glory, and eſpecially becauſe thou wilt alſo for thy glory ſake, giue thoſe thinges which we deſire. For what thinges ſerue for thy glory, the ſame wilt thou performe and do, but thoſe things which we deſire, ſerue for thy glory, therefore thou wilt giue them vs. Giue vs therefore theſe thinges that we deſire, and the glory ſhall returne and redounde vnto thee, if thou deliuer vs. For ſo ſhall thy kingdome, and power, and glory be manifeſted. See then beloued a ſweete comfort. If your requeſt that you make to your God may be good for you to receiue,

                      aſwell may the Lord looſe his kingdome, looſe his power, and looſe his glorie, as you fayle of your fruite and harts deſire. For ſo teacheth this concluſion as you ſee. And if it bee not good for you to haue, in the wiſedome of a mightie God, ſo knowne, who

can better tel than you your ſelf what is fit for you, would you haue it? God forbid. Strengthen your harts then in your prayers alwaies with this. There is no King can bee like minded to his ſubiect as the Lord is to you: there is no power like the Lords, and his glorie euer was and euer ſhall be deare vnto him. And therfore what may be his glorie to giue and your good to receiue, his power can reach it, his loue ſhall graunt it, and you ſhall neuer want it. For no good thing ſhal he withhold frō his Children, ſayth the Prophet Dauid.
                     
                        Pſal. 84.
                      Stockes and ſtones cannot do this, Idols and Images cannot doe this: no, the Angels of heauen cannot doe this: much leſſe inferiour creatures, &amp; therfore know what it is to leaue the right &amp; to take the wrong, to diſhonor your GOD, and to hurt your ſelues by praying to theſe things. The word Amen is added, not as a part of the Prayer, but as a particle noting our wiſh of hart, to be heard and to obtayne. As if we ſhould ſay, O Lord thus be it vnto me, what my tongue or ſoule hath begged: ſo be it, Amen, Amen, ſo Lord, ſo Lord, and then euen in a ſweete reſt of hart and content

of minde that I haue vttered my ſelfe to my God, I riſe vp and go my way, leauing all to him. And thus much of this heauenly Prayer, the patterne of all Prayers, according as the Lord hath inabled me. Bleſſed be the name of the Lord from this time foorth for euermore. Amen.
               
               
                  A Prayer.
                  
                     O Moſt tender GOD, and deere father, looke vpon vs, heare vs, and hearken to vs, in that mercie of thine that hath no meaſure, &amp; when euer it ſhall pleaſe thyne owne ſelfe to trie vs by any temptation, doe it in mercie according to our ſtrength and for our good. And ſuffer vs neuer to be tempted aboue our power,1. Cor. 10.13. but giue the iſſue with the temptation, that we may be able to beare it. Let it open vnto vs our want and weaknes, to reforme vs, but neuer cauſe feare aboue faith to ouercome vs. Come wel,

come woe, either outwarde or inwarde, make vs contented, and ſtrengthen our ſteps in both eſtates to thy bleſſed liking, that proſperitie puffe not vp, nor aduerſitie plucke vs downe aboue that is fit for thy true children. If men aſſault vs and tempt vs vnto euill, O Lord giue wiſedome to diſcerne them, feare to followe them, and zeale to defie them. And let not the pleaſures of ſinne for a ſeaſon preuayle aboue thy fauour, and our eternall good. That helliſh feend ſo raging and roaring, and euer ſo greedie to deuour vs, deere father, let him want his will, and all his temptations come to naught. Increaſe our knowledge to bewray his ſleights, and ſupport our faith to quench his darts. Let ſinne appeare ſinne, and euer damnable: let it neuer ſeeme good and very tollerable. But plucke off thoſe maſkes, O heauenly God, that it often commeth diſguiſed withall, and let our eyes through thy mercie bewray both nature &amp; ende of ſuch delicates as thy ſeruant Dauid prayed he might neuer taſte of.Pſal. 141.4. O bleſſed father helpe vs agaynſt our owne

corruption, our owne concupiſcence and ſinne. Our fleſh, our fleſh, O Lord let it not preuayle to the working of our woe, and euerlaſting fall. The Spirit is willing but the fleſh is frayle, full of gaynſayings, ſtriuings, and ſtruglings againſt thy wil. And we know with thine Apoſtle that in vs, that is, in our fleſh dwelleth no good thing. So that vnleſſe thou helpe, moſt deere father, it will rebell, and wee ſhall dye. Deliuer vs from euill, euen from all euill, eternall God, as if we ſhould name them one by one, ſo farre as may ſtand with thy bleſſed pleaſure, and our obedience to thee. And finally, deere God, though we bee vnworthie to goe vpon this ground, becauſe it is thy obedient creature more than wee, much leſſe to lift vp our eyes to heauen where thou dwelleſt, and to receiue any comfort that wee aſke: yet for that red
