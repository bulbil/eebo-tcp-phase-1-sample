            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

them, but by exceſſe of their owne malyce worke their owne confuſion, ſome confirmacion, whereof incontinentlye folowed, as I ſhal trulye tell, wherof I haue witnes lyuyng, I minded ſome ſonday of that lent, to preache at Paules croſſe, as I had ben yeres before accuſtomed, and vpon the fyrſte ſaturday in lent, going to Lambehith there to be occupied all that daye, I deuiſed with my chaplein that he ſhould go that daye, and know who ſhuld occupy the croſſe that lent, and to ſpeake for a place for me on one of the ſondayes, not meanynge the ſondaye, that ſhuld be on the morowe, for I hadde in my mynde more reuerence to that audyence, then wythoute ſome conuenient premeditaciō, to ſhew my ſelfe there. Neuertheleſſe my chapleine, repayrynge to knowe, howe the ſondayes were appoynted,

and vnderſtandyng that Barnes ſhulde preache the fyrſte ſondaye (whiche was the morowe) thought in his mynde, rather to take that daye for me then any other, ſpecyally becauſe he thought I wolde ſpeake that was good, and Barnes ſhulde be diſapoynted to vtter that was noughte. And ſo when I had doone my buſines at Lambehith (which ended not afore fyue of the clocke that ſaturday) my chaplein thē waiting for me tolde me he had ben ſo bold ouer me, to appoynt me to preache the next day at Poules croſſe, adding howe he thoughte better to diſapoynt Barnes on the morowe then ſome other catholyque man, appointed on other ſondayes. Whervpon I gathered my wittes to me, called for grace, and determined to declare the goſpell of that ſondaye, conteynynge the deuyls

M.D.xxxix. to be applyed to the tyme, and good occaſiō, to note the abuſe of ſcripture amonge ſome, as the deuyll abuſed it to chriſt, which matter in dede, I touched ſomwhat plainlye, and in my iudgement truelye. And alludinge to the temptation of the deuyll to chriſt, to caſt him ſelfe downeward, allegyng ſcripture that he ſhoulde take no hurt. I ſaide nowe a dayes, the deuyll tempteth the worlde, and byddeth them caſt them ſelfe backewarde. There is no forward in the newe teachinge, but al backward. Now the deuyll teacheth, come ba

and where we ſayde, forgyue vs our debtes, as we forgyue oure debters, now it is, as thou forgiueſt our debtes, ſo I wyll forgyue my debters, and ſo God muſt forgeue fyrſt, and all I ſayde is turned backewarde. And amonges other thynges noted the deuylles craft, what ſhifte he vſeth to deceyue man whoſe felicitie he enuieth, and therfore coueteth to haue man idle, and voyde of good workes, &amp; to be ledde in that idelnes, with a wanne hope, to liue merely and at his pleaſure here, and yet haue heuen at ye laſt: And for that purpoſe, procured oure pardons from Rome, wherein heauen was ſold for a litle money, &amp; for to retayle that marchaundiſe, the deuyll vſed freres for his miniſters: nowe they be gone with all theyr tromperye, but the deuyll is not yet gonne. And now he perceaueth

it can no lenger be borne to bye &amp; ſell heauen (both the marchaundiſe is abhorred, and the miniſters alſo, we can not away with freres, ne canne abyde the name) The deuyll hath excogitate, to offre heuen without workes for it, ſo frelye that men ſhal not nede for heauen to worke at all, what ſo euer opportunite they haue to worke, mary if they wyll haue an higher place in heauen, god wyl leaue no worke vnrewarded, but as to be in heauen, nedes no workes at all, but onelye belefe, onelye, onelye, nothynge els. And to ſet forth this the deuylles craft, there were (I ſayde) mynyſters, but no mo fryers, fye on the name and the garment, but nowe they be called, by an Englyſſhe name, bretherne, and go apparelled lyke other mē, amonges whyche be ſome of thoſe that were freres, and ſerued the

deuyll in retaylynge of heauen in pardons, for they can ſkyll of the deuyls ſeruyce. But yf the kynges maieſtie as he hath banyſhed freres by the Frenche name, wold alſo banyſhe theſe that cal them ſelfe brethren in Englyſhe, the deuyll ſhulde be greatly diſcomforted in his enterpriſe, and idelnes therby banyſhed, whiche the deuyll wyll elles perſwade by myſunderſtandinge of ſcriptures, as he dyd in thaduauncemente of pardons. This my ſermon was thought to ſome very plaine, and Barnes (as he confeſſed after, and as appeared by that he dyd) coulde not digeſte it, but was perſwaded and comforted to handle me ſomwhat rudely, which he dyd the ſondaye fourtnyght after, in ye ſame place, where he toke to intreat the ſame text of the goſpell, that I had declared, and left the ſcripture of the

ſonday he preached on, which had not ben ſene in that place before.Barnes preachinge at Pauls croſſe the thyrde ſōday in lent An. M.D.xxxix. There he began to call for me, to cōme forth to aunſwer him, he termed me to be a fyghtynge cocke, and he was an other, and one of ye game, he ſaid I had no ſpoores, and that he wold ſhewe.This glorye endured but tyl the friday after, by whiche tyme he hadde for gotten al: on the ſaturday choſe his ſcolemaiſter: and the monday came to ſcoole like a good chylde. And after he had pleaſed him ſelfe in thallegory of a cockefight, then vpon a foolyſh concluſion, he caſt me openly his gloue, and not content therwith, he called me forth by my name gardener, and oppoſed me in my grammer rules, and ſayde: If I had aunſwered him in the ſcoole, as I had there preached at the croſſe, he wold haue gyuen me ſyxe ſtripes, and raged after ſuche a ſorte, as the lyke hath not ben herde doone in a pulpete (ordered to declare the word of god in, and not to touche any particuler man) as he rayled of me, by name alludynge

to my name Gardener, what euyll herbes I ſette, in the garden of ſcripture, ſo farre beyonde the termes of honeſtye, as all men wondered at it, to heare a Bylſhop of the realme as I was, ſo reuyled, and by ſuche one openlye. So as my frendes enforced me to complaine vnto the kinges maieſtie and for maintenaūce of common order, not to paſſe▪ it ouer vnſpoken of. Wherevpon I complayned carynge more for the peruerſe doctryne he wente aboute to eſtablyſhe in deprauing of me, then for anye diſpleaſure, coulde come vnto me by his raylynge. Howe graciouſelye the kynges maieſtie herde the complaynte, and howe indifferentlye his maieſtie after his accuſtomed goodnes, ordered thexamynation of it, all good men might haue cauſe to reioyſe, and Barnes no

cauſe of greefe but cauſe of comforte, in the kinges maieſties mercye, yf he wolde haue erneſtly enbraced it. For what ſo euer folowed worthely by iuſtice,If Barne
                     •
                   had not extremely abuſed the kynges maieſties goodnes for a little vaine glory among ſuche as magnified hym for their owne purpoſe, he had eſcaped all puniſhment▪
                the kynges maieſtye offred Barnes as muche mercye, as euer dyd prince any offendour, declarynge howe his highnes, was deſyrouſe of concorde in the truth, rather then the punyſſhemente of any man that wolde from erroure be reduced to the truth: And one notable thyng was done, in the hearynge of that matter, by the kynges maieſtie, when Barnes offred to yelde to his hyghneſſe in hys opynyon: the kynges grace ſyttinge ſecretly in his cloſet, and hauinge with hym the late Erle of Southampton (whoſe ſoule God pardon) the mayſter of the horſe that nowe is, Me, Barnes, mayſter doctoure Cockes, and doctoure Robinſon.

The kinges highnes,A behauour and ſpeache of the kinges maieſtie, ſecretly done, &amp; worthye, an open knowledge and eternall memory. at that offre of Barnes, ſayd, I am (ꝙ his maieſtie) a mortall man, and therwith ryſyng, &amp; turning to the ſacramēt, and puttinge of his bonet ſayde: Yonder is the maiſter of vs all, author of truth, yelde in truth to hym, and I ſhall (ſaith the kinges maieſtie) defende that truth. And otherwyſe Barnes (ꝙ the kynges maieſtie) yelde not to me. Muche more there was notably ſpoken by the kinges highnes, to refourme Barnes foly, in his maner &amp; alſo lernynge, which I touch not becauſe I ſhuld rather empayre and diminiſhe that was in deed ſayde, then tell it fullye. But to the purpoſe I tell this ſtory for, I deſyred the kinges maieſty, that Barnes and I myght commen togither of the matter, out of his highnes preſence, in the hearing of certayne, to be appointed by his highnes

as indifferent to make report of our diſpitions, and then Barnes ſhoulde haue no cauſe to excuſe hym ſelfe yf he could not conuince me, as he dydde in the pulpete, onely touchinge the truth of hys doctrine diſprouynge myne. For as for his rebukes, I clearly remytted and forgaue them, and wolde common as quyetlye with hym as yf he had vſed no ſuche language of me, which my peticion, the kinges maieſtie graunted, and appoynted mayſter doctoure Cockes, and mayſter doctoure Robynſon with two other to be indifferent hearers bytwene Barnes and me, and onely to heare vs talke togyther, and make report to his highnes. Wherevpon that nyghte (whiche was the frydaye. after Barnes hadde preached ſo outragiouſlye of me) Barnes, I, and the hearers, were aparte,

where none other myghte heare vs. And for entry of diſputation, betwene Barnes and me, I tolde hym I beganne with forgyuynge all was paſt, that myght touche me, I beganne in frendſhyp with hym, onelye intendynge to trye the truthe of the doctrine in controuerſye betwene hym and me, and therein I offered hym choyſe, whether he wolde haue me aunſwere hym, or he to aunſwere me. He chaſe to aunſwere me, wherevpon I prepared my ſelfe to faſhyon certayne argumentes to hym of the ſcryptures,

Whervpon the kinges hyghneſſe aduertiſed of the concluſion of the matter betwene Barnes and me, was content that Barnes ſhoulde repayre to my houſe at London the mondaye folowynge, whiche he dyd with a ſcole felowe with hym, neither Ierarde nor Iherome, but an other

When mayſter Barnes had gone to ſcoole two dayes, he waxed werye of that humilitie, and came the thirde daye, and ſignified to me that yf I wolde take hym as one that came to conferre, he wold come ſtyl, but els he wold no more come, I perceyued from whenſe the chaunge came, &amp; tolde hym,Such is th

Herevpon they began to ſpreade abrode an enuious rumour of me that I wolde be ſcoole mayſter to all the realme, and many good morowes, and ſo was I rydde of my waywarde ſcoler, and neuer medled wt hym after.At the ſolēne eaſter ſermō.

But whē Barnes right ſolemplye and formally had made his recantacion in the formour part of his ſermon, at thende of that: he cryed out to me, &amp; aſked me forgeuenes with a maruaylous circumſtaunce, as though the worlde ſhulde thinke I had hadde nede of ſuche a publyque obteſtacion, and nedes I muſt holde vp my hande in token

                YOur entry to ye matter, is fyt for your proceſſe. For neither dyd I euer write ſuche articles: ne Barnes was burnt for preaching

onely faith iuſtifieth. I was by Barnes choyce (as is aforeſaide) his ſcolemayſter, at which time we entreated tharticle of onely faith iuſtifieth, as ſhal hereafter appere
            
               
                  Ioye. 
               
               By theſe his articles, Wincheſter wold proue that workes muſt iuſtifie, that is to ſay, with our workes we muſt merite the remiſſiō of our ſynnes, which doctrine, as it is contrary to gods worde: ſo is it infuriouſe to Chriſtes bloude, whoſe godly name is one alone, for all ſufficiēt, euen that ſame precyous hyd treaſour in ye goſpel: in whome (ſayth Paule) are all ye treaſours of wyſdome and knowledge hidden, for in hym dwelleth the mooſt perfitte fulneſſe, of god verely, and in hym are we complete euen perfitly iuſtified without any inweyuinge of Wincheſters workes. This thyng do I tell you (ſayth Paule) leaſt any man (as nowe wolde Wincheſter) deceyue you with his apparaunt popyſſhe perſuaſyons. This full iuſtification by onely fayth Paule expreſſeth clerely in theſe wordes alſo. This our euerlaſtyng lyuynge prieſt, and interceſſour Chriſte abydeth for euer vnto this ende, euen abſolutly,

fully and perfytly without any lacke or breth to ſaue all them, that through hym by fayth come to god the father. Here are we taught Chriſte to haue an euerlaſtynge preeſthode to ſaue perfytlye, and ſufficientlye through our faith onely, and that he euer lyueth vnto the ſame ende, wherfore for the defence of our ſo plentuouſe and perfyt redemption, and for the ryche fauoure &amp; mercy of our heuenly father, and free forgyuenes, in Chriſtes paſſion through our fayth onely, and that the glorye of his grace, whereby he hath made vs his dearely beloued choſen chyldrē, throughe his beloued ſonne, ſhoulde be prayſed, by whome we haue redemption through his blood, euen the remyſſyon of ſynnes, accordynge to the ryches of his ſo plentuouſe grace, vnable to be myniſſhed. To defende this my lorde gods glorye (I ſaye) and to warne the ſymple vnlerned that they be not deceyued by ſuch blaſphemouſe Byſhoppes articles, I ſhal by gods helpe, iuſtlye by his worde, clerely confute them, although he yet teache &amp; preache them, into his owne dampnation, and deceyuyng of as many as beleue hym.
            
            
               
               
                  Vvinton̄ 
                IT is of lyke truth that ye affirme of me, that I wolde by theſe articles proue, that workes muſt iuſtifie. I neuer wente about to proue that: Howe ſo euer it liketh you to report of me. I neuer wrote ſo, I neuer preached ſo, I neuer affyrmed ſo, ne enterpriſed to teach Barnes ſo, at the time he was my ſcooler. As for youre (that is to ſay, with oure workes we muſte merite the remiſſion of our ſynnes) I wold not be a ferde to vſe that ſpeache, yf you and other had not to the worlde diffamed and ſclaundered the worde (meryte) but nowe ſeinge ye haue beaten it into the eares of youre hearers and readers, that merite is as muche to ſaye, as worthely, fully, and holly to deſerue, none otherwiſe then a workeman deſerueth his wages, for his laboure and trauayle, (the worlde by your

preachynge takynge the worde in that ſence) it were in dede an occaſion of offence and ſclaunder to ſuche ſort of men, and in the fyrſt apparaunce, conteyned blaſphemye agaynſt the paſſyon of chriſt, which in the ſyght of god, is only ſufficient ſacrifice for the ſynne of all the worlde, ſo full and perfyt as it nedeth not anye addicion or ſupplement of any mans deſerte to the appeaſynge of gods iuſte wrath agaynſt man for ſinne. And therfore ye ſhal not nede to ſpeake of halfe ſauiours, or patched ſauyours, or els brynge in your allegations to proue chriſt a onely redemer. It is the fyrſte letter of oure croſſe rowe. It is the foundacion of our faith. Only Chryſte is oure mediatour. Chriſtes onelye paſſion is our redemption, iuſtice, and ſatiſfaction. And when Barnes went to ſcoole with me (as his

ſcoolefelowe can report) this article was fyrſt without any varyaunce agreed on,

                  th with ſuch explication as ſcriptures do teſtifie, that only Chriſt is our hope, only chryſt is our life, only chriſt is our way, only chriſt our ſauiour, holly, throughly, perfitly, abſolutely, totally, entierly, fully, and herein no tongue can expreſſe ſo much as the matter truly conteyneth, ne there was euer any ſo mad as to bryng this truth in queſtion, wher by to ſhake the foūdacion of oure faith, &amp; to bryng in doubt that is ſo playne and euident, as ye wold beare the people in hand men did, when lerned men, impugne your frantique vnderſtandyng of this truth. The contētion is not of the preciouſnes, validitie &amp; effecte of chriſtes paſſiō, but of the vſe of it. And where your doctrine ſhoulde onelye implye that it is ſufficient,

to thynke &amp; talke of chriſtes paſſion, we ſay it is alſo neceſſarye to ſome, to taſte and fele of chriſtes paſſion, and alſo to drynke of it, as Chryſte ſayde. Poteſtis bibere calicem, quem ego bibiturus ſum? Can ye drynke the cuppe that I ſhall drynke? And we wyth the grace of God doynge the workes of penaunce, taſte and feele the paſſyon of Chriſte, and as good men haue called it meryting and deſeruynge, to vſe the benefytes of chryſtes paſſyon, and by ſtrengthe thereof to do penaunce for ſynne, whyche hathe ben called lykewyſe ſatiſfaction, as wherein man ſatiſfieth (that is to ſaye) contenteth God, who ſayeth: he wylleth not the death of a ſynner, but that he ſhoulde turne to hym and lyue. And in this ſpeach, meriting and deſeruynge, ſygnyfyeth the due vſynge of the benefyte offred,

after whiche ſorte we ſaye alſo: He is worthy loue and fauour, that wyll leke for it, and do his dutye to atteine it. And in this wiſe the hole churche prayeth. Omnipotēs ſempiterne deus da nobis fidei, ſpei, &amp; charitatis augmentum, &amp; ut mereamur aſſequi quod promit tis, fac nos amare quod precipis. and in this ſence we ſpeake of the merites of our Ladye and other ſayntes who vſed the benefites of God, to his pleaſure and honour. And albeit the wordes haue longe continued in this ſence, and in all tongues, yet ſuch as you be, haue maliciouſlye impugned them, and cauſed them to ſounde, as though there were ment derogacion to the benefite of chriſtes paſſion by thē, where in deede they do ſette forth thexcellencie of the ſame, as by vertue of whiche paſſion, men in ſtate of grace, purchaſed by chriſtes

mediacion, doo the workes of iuſtice, and ſynners be called to grace to do the workes of penaūce whereby to recouer the fauour of god, with remiſſion and forgeuenes of their ſynne. You wyll percaſe, fynde matter of raylyng, that I brynge in the wordes of the cō
               mon prayer of the churche, for to ſhewe the vſe of the ſpeache, in the worde (merite) and call it papiſticall ſcripture. But I dydde it not for want, but vpon that occaſion to touche the matter. And now I adde this gathered out of ſcrypture, that lyke as in other actions or qualities beynge in God eſſentiall, we be called by participaciō, by the names attributed to god, &amp; for ſo muche, as we do participate haue alſo the thynge in dede. And therefore as God is goodnes it ſelf, we by participaciō frō him, be good. As god is lyght it ſelfe, we

by participaciō frō hym, be light. As god is wiſedome it ſelfe, we by participacion from him, be wyſe: So as chriſt merited and deſerued throughly: we by participacion in vſyng his gyftes, merite &amp; deſerue. And as chriſte ſatyſfied fullye, ſo by participacion we alſo ſatiſfy. And as our goodnes light and wyſedome by participacion, is no addition, or derogacion to goddes goodnes, lyght, or wyſedome, in eſſence or being, no more is our merityng, deſeruyng, or ſatiſfaction: a derogacion or ſupplement to the merites of chriſtes paſſyon, but onely a due vſynge of them, by the gyfte of his grace. Nowe how this participacion is wrought, and by goddes goodnes deryued to man: herein the worlde is troubled, but the ſpeach with this ſence hath no abſurdite, and out of this ſence it hathe not

ben ſpoken in the common prayer of the churche. But I dydde neuer vtter this propoſicion, in theſe termes, to ſaye: that man muſt meryte remyſſyon of ſynne, nor I haue not (as I remembre) redde it ſpoken in this fourme, tyll you haue ſo termed it, onely to make matter to talke of, by occaſiō wherof, ye tell a longe tale of hereſies as foloweth.
            
               
                  Ioye. 
               
               In Paules tyme there ſtrayed about a certayne ydle ſorte and ſecte of heretykes, called Nazares or Minei, the moſt ſubtyll kynde of men, in paynting and perſwadynge theyr falſe doctrine. Theſe heretikes troubled and peruerted the churches, well inſtituted of the apoſtels, eſpecyally the Galathiens, Antiochens, and Romaynes, agaynſte whoſe hereſyes Paule dyd wryte ſo myghtely and erneſtly, cōfutyng them. Theſe phariſees laboured in the ſame hereſie, in which Wincheſter now teacheth &amp; writeth myxing thobſeruaūce of the lawe, with the grace of the goſpell, euen workes with fayth to iuſtyfye.

Theſe Nazares confeſſed Chriſt to be god &amp; man, that he dyed, roſe agayne &amp;c. but vnto hym onely, through oure fayth, they attributed not all our hole iuſtification, but part therof (as nowe doth Wincheſter) to the workes of the lawe, as vnto our owne merites &amp; part to his paſſyon, makynge Chriſt a ſauyour to halues. But is Chriſte deuided (ſayth Paule)?

Theſe Nazaries were Iues borne, but in name they wold be called Chriſtiās, and yet nothyng holdynge the benefite of grace by Chryſte, confoundynge the lawe with the goſpell, merites myxte with grace, free forgyuenes, with deſeruynge by workes, contendynge no man to be ſaued by Chriſt, except he beynge cyrcumciſed, kepte the lawe of Moyſes, agaynſt whom Paule with ſo great labour, farre otherwyſe inſtituted his churches, preachyng &amp; wrytyng conſtantly, our ſynnes to be knowen &amp; ſhewed vs by the lawe, and not therby to be taken awaye onely the grace of fayth through Chriſte to iuſtify all nations. Happy it was that theſe heretiques

ſpronge vp in his dayes, whoſe epyſtels we haue yet ſo myghtlye and clearely confutyng and preſſyng downe theſe hereſyes, nowe crepte vp agayne by Wincheſter. The chiefe articles of the chriſten religion, vpon the whiche all other are ſtayed and grounded, is that in Chriſt Ieſu is al ſufficiēcie and perfection of forgyueneſſe of ſynnes, &amp; ſaluacyon, of whoſe fulnes we receyue grace for grace, as ſayth Ihon̄. Wherfore as many as be iuſtified, are iuſtified by thonely fayth in hym, and by nothyng els, as by any ſubſidiary, atteynement (as Wincheſter wold haue his helpyng wylworkes) vnto his full iuſtification in Chriſte the perfection of the lawe. This is the ſūme of the hole Goſpell. This is the ſtation of ye cauſe, the argument▪ and material of all Paules piſtels, euen the tredſ

And now ſyth this Byſſhop ſterith vp afreſſhe theſe olde hereſies, we can haue no better armoure &amp; argumentes, then Paule made agaynſt hym, fyrſte warnynge vs of ſuch ſedicious ſecte ſowers, ſayeng: There are many runners abrode, of

whome I warned you often, but nowe with wepynge teares I warne you agayne, euen of the enemyes of Chriſtes croſſe, whoſe ende is dampnatiō, whoſe belly is theyr god, and theyr glory ſhall ende with ſhame, whoſe care and ſtudy is ſet vpon earthly thynges. I can not maruayle ynough at this Byſſhoppe, fyghtyng ſo earneſtly for good workes to iuſtify, that he doth none hym ſelf, but perſecuteth Chriſtes church ſo cruelly, pryſon pitiouſly, and deſtroye the poore innocent lambes of God, chriſtes owne blode, I paſſe ouer his luciferine pryde, ambytion, arrogancye, viciouſe lyuynge &amp;c. aboue Nero, Iulian, Traiane, Herod, or any ſofte Sardanapale, By lyke he beleueth not his owne articles: for yf he dyd, he wolde do better workes for his owne iuſtification. The frutes of Paules fayth, beynge ones a Phariſaie, of Winch. opinion, were the perſecution of Chriſtes churche, aboue meaſure, as hym ſelfe teſtifieth. And as all lyke phariſees haue euer done and do yet ſtyll vnto this day. God cōuerte them ones, as he dyd Paule. So be it. We therfore with Paule and Chriſte affirme our onely one alone ſauioure Chriſte, for his owne merites and oure fayth into hym through the fauour of his father appeaſed in hym to iuſtifye

(that is) to abſolue vs, from our ſynnes, and to gyue vs lyfe eternall. This our onely ſauyour, we preache &amp; write, to be the only rightwyſnes, wiſedome, holy maker, redemptiō and ſatiſfactiō, ſufficient for all that beleue in hym. And yf there be any that thynke Chriſtes rightwyſenes his ſatiſfaction, his merites, &amp; redemptiō, made for vs of his father not a ſufficiēt iuſtificaciō &amp; forgyuenes of theyr ſynnes, but that they muſt ſet theyr own workes, checkmate wt his paſſyon &amp; redemption, to helpe furth vnto the atteynement of this effecte of Chriſtes paſſyon, (well) lette them couple and wrappe in theyr owne workes to, for theyr iuſtification, and then in ſo doynge, ſhall they procure theyr owne dampnatiō. For al our good workes or ryghtwyſenes (ſayth I ſay) are ryght fylthy and nought, &amp; ſo much the worſe then nought, for that they be ſet in ſo hygh a place, e

Iſay prophecyed of Chriſte that when he ſhould come, he ſhould not be darke and dyfficyle or harde in his doctryne. Nowe ſpeakeſt thou playnely (ſaid his diſciples). And Paule reioyced greatly that he hadde ſo ſyncerelye and frelye preached the goſpell: Chriſt toulde his that they ſhoulde be the lyghte of the worlde purely and clearely to teache, eſpecially the chief principilles of the chriſten relygion of whiche the pſalme hath: Manifeſt and cleare are thy wordes (oh lorde) they illumyne and gyue vnderſtandyng to the lytle ones.

                YE reherſe here two propoſicions, or ſpeches which ye call myne article. The fyrſt propoſicion is. The effecte of chriſtes paſſion hath a condicion. Whē I trauailed to inſtruct doctour Barnes, I declared this propoſicion vnto hym

neyther darkely nor confuſely. And whye ye ſhulde call it ſo, I ſe not, for both ye matter is certayne, and the wordes commonly vſed and vnderſtanded. Theffecte of Chryſtes paſſyon, is the worke therein intended (that is to ſay) to reconcyle man to god and brynge him to ſaluaciō, wherein, I aſked Barnes, whether he toke the effecte of chriſtes paſſion to be abſolute to man, or with a condicion on mans behalfe. If it be abſolute and without condicion, then ſhal all men be reconciled and ſaued. For ſeinge Chriſte dyed for all: if nothinge elles were required on mans behalfe, it ſhoulde extend to all men, and then ſhulde no man be dampned, but all ſaued at the laſt, as the Origeniſtes ſaid. Here vnto Barnes fyrſt aunſwered, as ye ſaye nowe, that he knewe no condicion, but yf a man beleued. I

aſked hym then: whether he wolde graunt there was that one condicion? He ſaid yea, he wolde graun
                  •
                that, for els he muſt haue agreed to an inconuenience, that all men ſhall be ſaued, whether they beleued or no. And herevppon the firſte propoſicion that ye nowe cal darke, was agreed vnto, that the effecte of chryſtes paſſion had a condycyon. I aſked Barnes then, whether the fulfillyng of the condicion, dydde dymynyſſhe the glory of Chriſtes paſſion? that is to ſaye: Whether the paſſyon of Chriſt were more gloriouſe to redeme man, whether he beleued or no? and ſo doynge nothynge? or els when man by gods gyfte wrought the worke of belefe in ye ſame? Whervnto he ſaid that mās belefe dyd nothyng diminiſhe the glory of chriſtes paſſion. And becauſe he hadde before graunted,

that belefe was a condiciō, which decerned them that ſhall enioye the fruyte of Chryſtes paſſion, and them that ſhall not: thus we termed that propoſicion, that the fulfyllynge of the condicion, required in man: dydde nothynge diminiſſhe the glorye of Chriſtes paſſyon. And thus farre we agreed, I only diſſentinge from hym, that where he ſayde, he knewe but one condicion, that is to ſaye beleuynge, as you do nowe. I ſayde becauſe he came to me as a ſcoler, I wolde lerne him mo condicions required in man, and amonge manye other, tolde hym of this▪ wherin he had in his open ſermon inueyed agaynſte me. To forgyue his neyghbour or els he ſhuld not be forgyuen. And concluded vpō that he had graunted before that the fulfilling of this condiciō was not the diminution of the glory of

Chriſtes paſſion. And ſo likewiſe of any other condicion required in ſcripture of man, either in his incorporation into chriſt by baptiſme, or returninge to chriſte by penaunce, with perſeueraunce in vertue, for the atcheuyng of eternall lyfe. And after this ſorte we diſcuſſed this matter in earneſte with ſuche reſpecte to the honour of the paſſyon of Chriſt, as we eſtemed it moſt abhominable ſacrilege, to diminyſſhe any part of the frute and effect thereof. But it foloweth in your booke. But playe on yet a gods name Wyncheſter.

wyl be iuſtified by his condicion ere thou cōmeſt. Here might I aſke Wine. whether workes (which are his condiciō) be before faith, or faith before his workes? By his proceſſe, workes go before faith, and ſo muſt his workes be ſinne &amp; diſpleaſure to god. For what ſo euer is not of faith (ſaith Paule) is ſin. And without faith, it is impoſſible to pleaſe God. If faith goeth before workes then muſt fayth only iuſtifye, or els it is no faith, as I ſhal nowe proue by Paul, which giuing to faith her eſſentiall diffinition, ioyneth it immediately &amp; eſſentially vnto thinges inuiſible aſſured vs by hope, ſaieng, faith is a ſubſtā
                  cial aſſured perſuaſiō, of thinges hoped for, with a ſure hope &amp; confidence, euen the certeinte of thinges inuiſible. God inuiſible ſo entierly ioyneth him ſelf to faith, that in the faithful he dwelleth, &amp; they in him. Faith therfore alwaies inſeperably is ioyned to gods mercy, his grace, remiſſion of ſinnes, to ſaluaciō, &amp; lyfe eternall through Chriſt, which all are inuiſible thynges hoped for. But Wincheſter dreaming vs forth, his new fained faith, coupleth her to an externe knowledge of what maner a viſible fulfylling I cā not tel you, nor yet of what a fond confuſe condicion, nor yet of hym ſelfe expreſſed. Ioyne yu thy faith to an

outward viſible bodely thinge, and ſo it is neither faith nor hope. Bleſſed are they that beleue &amp; ſe not, Nowe muſte Wyn. proue his condition, with the fulfylling and knowledge thereof, to be thinges inuiſible, hoped for as eternall life. &amp;c. or elles his faith ſhal not be that fayth, whiche Paule diffineth, &amp; chriſte ſo often mencioneth in his goſpell.

                IT may appeare in you euidently, howe malyce maketh you blynd, whē reherſyng my wordes, yet ye aſke me whether fayth goeth before workes? For when I ſaye as you reherſe, that the fulfyllynge of the condicion, requireth fyrſt knowledge what the condicion is, and then that this knowledge is attayned by fayth, do not I geue faith the fyrſt place? as the meane of knowledge what is the condicion, which muſt nedes go before the fulfyllynge, &amp; the fulfyllyng before thatteyning of the effecte? In this place who

is firſt ſaye you? by myne owne wordes, fayth or workes? And yet ye ſaye by my proces workes go before, when my wordes reherſed hitherto declare the contrary. But ye were ſo pleaſaunt in ſcoffinge, that ye forgate the matter. And theſe be the frutes of the ſpirite that vexeth you. This is ye milde, meke, ſobrenes of your profeſſion of chriſtiane charitie, I wyll aſke you a queſtion wakynge. Is not all oure certeine knoweledge of gods wyl and pleaſure by faith?

ſence can ſignify an externe knowledge which is only by the ſenſes. And where dydde I talke in my dreame of viſible thinges ſpeakynge of god and his wyll, which be all inuiſible, and in gods wyll is cōteyned the condiciō I ſpeake of, whiche after knowledge thereof, as I ſaide, muſte be fulfylled, and without knoweledge before, can not be fulfilled. As for your mangled argument, to conferme the proufe ye promyſſe, ſhall be more commodiouſly entreated afterwarde. In this parte I ſhewe only, howe ye wrangle with me, &amp; take vpon you to improue that ye vnderſtand not, as by the reherſal of my next article ſhal appeare more plainly.

               This faith ſo farre of flytted frome the inuiſible iuſtyfycatyon whether it be the gyfte of God, and profytable to Wyncheſter I doubte it, but this I am ſure of, by Chriſtes owne wordes, that when Wyncheſter hathe done all that God commaunded hym (whyche I dare ſaye he ſhall neuer do) and ſo neuer fulfyll his condicion, yet is he but a ſeruaūt (if he be not a lord) vnprofitable. I wolde aſke Wyncheſter when he loketh and conſidereth fyrſte theffecte of chriſtes paſſion, whether he beleued it or no? If he did not beleue, ſo was he then an infidell. If he beleued it (ſeinge it is the promyſed forgyuenes of ſynnes in Chriſtes bloud) whether beleued he it to be effectuouſe to hym ſelfe, or only to other men? If to other, and not to hym ſelfe, ſo is his faythe and the deuylles faythe all one. If he beleued his owne ſynnes, to be forgyuen thereby, ſo was he iuſtified by faith onelye, ere any other condicion was knowen or ſpoken of, or elles he muſte make chriſt a lyer, which ſayeth: As thou beleueſt ſo come it to the. Whē Iairus deſyred Chriſt, to come &amp; helpe his doughter, and in Chriſtes commynge Iairus his ſeruaunt mette him ſaienge: Deſeaſe not Chriſte out mayſter no further, for your doughter is

deade. What ſayde Chriſt? Sayde he not to hym, feare not? Beleue only and ſhe ſhall be ſafe. Theſe ſame wordes (onely beleue) ſtande bothe in Marke and Luke. What condicion elles then fayth onely in Chriſtes promyſſe, can Wyncheſter fynde, to enioye the effecte of Chriſtes paſſion? Chriſt (all condicions elles ſet a ſyde) only faith mencioned, ſaide: Thy fayth hath ſaued the. What condicion elles then faith dydde Chryſte requyre of the chyldes father, prayenge hym to caſte the euyll ſpyryte oute of his ſonne? Added he any thynge elles then faithe, ſayenge: If thou canſte beleue all thynges are poſſible to the beleuer. Awaye Wyncheſter with your confuſe comberouſe condycyon, fonde fulfyllynges and your craftie knowledge, and abuſe not the preciouſe gyfte of fayth, to ſerue your ſynful affectes, to proue your blaſphemouſe cōcluſion: But yet perchaūce Wyncheſter wyll aunſwere to my former queſtyon, that when he beholdeth the forgyuenes of his ſynnes, in Chriſtes paſſyon, he ſeeth alſo therwith his condicion, well be it ſo. Then aſke I hym, whether the forgyueneſſe of his ſynnes there beholden, and hym ſelfe hearynge Chryſte callynge and cryeng: Comme vnto me Wyncheſter, laden

with ſynnes and I ſhall eaſe the, whether (I ſaye) it is moore profitable for hym by fayth to ſette holde▪ of the forgyuenes of his ſynnes, nowe offered hym by chriſt, that can not lye, or to tarye and ſende him worde, that he wyll fyrſte knowe and fulfyll his condicion? A wyſe man wolde thynke it mooſt profitable, to ſette holde firſte, by faith vpon his iuſtificacion frely now offered hym, and to take the thynge certeyne and preſent, rather then ſo precyous a gyfte neglected, to labour in an vncertayne condycyon.

For they haue no thinge in them, but that myght be ſpoken of one that wold mainteine your owne opinion. Neyther Barnes, ne his ſcoolefelowe, dyd euer varye with me in them. For they be principilles ſo true and euident, as they can haue no contradiction of hym, that is not vnſhamefaſt. And when I ſay, this fayth commeth of God, do I not make god auctoure of fayth wher by is aſſured knowledge of gods wyll and pleaſure, conteynynge the condicion of oure eſtate, required to enioy theffecte of chriſtes paſſion, whiche is the ſumme of that I ſaid hitherto, Nowe when ye reherſe for mine article as foloweth. This faith is a good gyft, it is good and profitable to me. It is good

and profitable to me to do well, and exercyſe this fayth. Ye note me to haue ſpoken a ſorte of good wordes, but ſuche as I ſpake not in dede, &amp; be in dede nothynge to the purpoſe. And it had ben a coold ſpeache to ſay, fayth is a good gifte, &amp; it is good and profitable, &amp; it is profitable to me to do well. I that had called faith the gyfte of god, &amp; neceſſaryly before all requyred for knowledge, it had ben worſhip fully ſpoken afterwarde, to ſaye, fayth is a good gyfte by laken, as though any gyfte of god, coulde be otherwyſe then good.

               cluſyon, that ye reherſe afterward ergo by the gyft of god, I may do well before I am iuſtified. And yt was in dede the mater proponed

betwene vs. whether a mā myght haue grace to do well before he were iuſtified. For maiſter Barns had affirmed yt albeit god ſaith: we muſt forgyue our neyghbour, to obteyne forgyuenes of god, yet he ſaid that god muſt forgyue vs firſt, before we forgiue our neighbour. For elles to forgyue oure neyghbour were ſynne, by ye texte that ye brynge in: All that is not of fayth is ſynne. A true ſayeng, but brought in, to ſubuerte truth, as ye deuyll dyd ſcripture. And in this dreame was Barnes, that folowyng the newe ſcoole of extremites, he denyed al degrees of grace, as you do, &amp; ſaid: A man could do nothyng good or acceptable before the grace of iuſtificatiō. For cōfutation wherof I agreed fyrſt with hym and he with me, of the former propoſicions, and came to this that we muſt haue fayth firſte of

all, to knowe what we ſhulde beleue. After this I aſked him, if a gentile felte him ſelf moued, to go heare a preachynge, or rede ſome parte of ſcripture, whether wolde he cal it wel done of him to go to ye ſermō &amp; rede ye ſcripture, or were it ſynne becauſe it was before faith? He ſaid it was good: And then I ſaid it muſt nedes be ſo, for it was of God &amp; profitable to hym. And thereupon folowed the concluſion that ye laughe at, ergo a man may do good before his iuſtification. Barnes was not contente in dede with the concluſion. And whē he ſawe that he coulde improue none of the partes wherof it folowed: Then began he to ſaye, that ſuche a gentyle ſo moued, to go to the ſermon, or to rede ſcripture, was then iuſtified of god in that mocion: And then I replied, Ergo men be iuſtified before fayth, and

ſo were it by Barnes falſe, that onely faith iuſtifieth, for this man was iuſtified without faith. For howe ſhulde he haue faith, before he hadde harde, when faith is of hearinge, as ſaint Paule ſayth. But to defend and maintaine his firſt fonde ſaieng, that a man can do no good thinge, before he be iuſtified, he was faine to maynteyne that a man is iuſtified, before he heareth and before he beleueth and ſo confounded he the degrees of gods workynge in time in vs. Fyrſt to call vs, and then to iuſtifie vs, as ſaint Paule declareth it. Thoſe he hath knowen, he hath predeſtinate, and thoſe he hath predeſtinate, he hath called, and thoſe he hath called, he hath iuſtified, and thoſe he hath iuſtified, he hath glorified. So as callynge (whiche god doth by many meanes) is before iuſtification, at

the leſt in ordre, or els if we conſidre no prioritie in gods workinge in time in vs, we muſt aſwell ſay, god hath glorified vs, when he doth iuſtifie vs, as that he hath iuſtified vs,

                  arnes had preached. at the callynge of vs. And in dede one of Barnes companions had preached, that God had iuſtified vs, before the beginninge of the worlde, puttynge no difference, betwene iuſtificatiō in time, and predeſtination and election that God worketh aboue tyme, and ſuch a cōfuſion ariſeth, where men will take vpon them, to affirme that they vnderſtande not. And becauſe they neyther done mind to do, anye good dedes, they wold perſwade to ye world, ye we cā do no maner of good dedes tyll we haue no nede of them for our ſaluacion, that is to ſay, til we be iuſtified, and clerely in goddes perfyt fauour, and aſſured by our

                  fuſelye of workes of iuſtice and workes of penaunce together, whiche they, do not diſtincte, as appereth by Ioye in the laſte article, but for doctrine I ſaye with ſaynte Auſtine, that bona opera (iuſticie) ſequuntur iuſtificationem and opera penitencie precedunt. and as though we ſhulde ſaye to god: Giue me my wages aforehande and make me ſure that I ſhal haue heauen, and then I profeſſe I wil forgeue my neighbour. Then I wil faſt the true faſt from ſynne. Then I wil pray. Then I wyll do almoſe. Then I wil loue mine enemy. For then I can do it. And before ye, al our dedes, al our thoughtes be ſynne. Ne man can haue grace, to do any of theſe, before iuſtification. And ſo if belefe be requyred before iuſtification, there aryſeth then a maruelouſe perplexytye, howe I ſhuld worke well the worke of beleefe before I am iuſtified. But as we ſay my ſynnes be forgiuen becauſe I beleue, ſo bycauſe my ſynnes were forgyuen, I dydde beleue. And for defence hereof, they enter into a darker matter of goddes

priuie counſayl of predeſtinacion, and make predeſtination the next and immediate cauſe to our ſaluacion.Predeſtinacion. And then as all the worlde hath almoſt lefte doynge, ſo they ſhulde leaue talkynge of workes, yea and faith alſo, and ſaye that men be ſaued by predeſtination. For god hath ſo appoynted, whoſe wyll in them that be predeſtinate ſhalbe fulfylled, and in them that be reprobate, can not be withſtanded. Voluntati enim eius quis reſiſtit? And ſo when men haue ſo longe ſtryuen to atteyne knoweledge of the truth, and babled of faith and workes, without atteynynge eyther of both: then as men do, that be wery of all together, they reſort to the ydle reaſonynge, as the Grekes cal it. That ſhalbe, ſhalbe. And as god hath appointed ſo muſt it be, and god knoweth who be his, and he wyll loſe none

of them. And al beleued that were preordinate to euerlaſtynge lyfe, and they that be indurate, can not heare or ſe, for god hath blynded them, finally all thinges come to paſſe by an abſolute neceſſite, and ſo mannes lyfe, death, manours, behauour, ſtate, condicion, and euery thinge is fixed, and faſtened in his place appoynted,No concluſiō is by Luther more ſtoutly affirmed thē this▪

ſelfe abiecte from goddes fauour, ſo all the Iewes myght be ſaued, to whome God hadde ſhewed ſo manye prerogatyues: He aunſwered then, as it were to the obiectyon of a murmurynge Iewe, that wolde impute the falle of the Iewes to the chaunge of goddes pleaſure, meaninge (as it were (blaſphemouſlye, that God hadde fayled of his worde and promyſſe.

                   capacite. how farre gods iudgementes and choyſes excede our capacite, ſheweth howe god without al difference to be atteyned by mans iudgement, dyd choſe Iacob and reproue Eſau, hauynge both one father, one mother, in one tyme begotten, neyther of thē yet borne, neither hauyng done any worke why to be preferred the other, not onlye hereby hidinge from vs the cauſe of ſuche election, and preferment

of the yonger to the elder, but alſo takynge away all coniecture of cauſes, to the intente all ſuche wayes, of ſearche and diuinacion of goddes ſecrete doinges ſhuld be taken away from the curioſite of mans wyt. And where any thinge altereth otherwiſe thē man loketh for: there for to confeſſe that god is all truth, and all wiſedome, and we without gods gyftes, be all foly and faultie,Gods wyl is cauſe of all cauſes, but not cauſe immediate of al thynge. ſo as we ought to worſhyppe gods wyll, as cauſe of all cauſes, directinge all thinge in equitte and iuſtice, numbre and meaſure, the perticuler diſcuſſion whereof,Man can nether comprehende god n
                     •

declaration of Abrahams ſeede and poſteritie, laye before the murmuringe Iewe, his ignoraunce in the vnderſtandynge of goddes promyſſe: So doth he in openynge of gods election of Iacob and Eſau,God hideth his ſecretes from vs, teache by this occaſion all the worlde, howe goddes determinacions be hydden frome vs, and euery wyndowe ſhyt vp, where we myghte pere into them. And yet man can not let this matter alone. And the more ſecret it is the more buſye we be to knowe. And therefore ſaynte Paule in the perſonne of a murmurer, deuiſeth this encountrynge with god. What ſhall we ſaye? Is iniquitie with god? mary god forbid. And yet I ſe that god preferreth ye yonger to thelder. And I can not fyſſhe out any cauſe or cōiecture, to call the dede equitie in mans reaſon, but rather becauſe the yonger

is preferred there appereth to mans reaſon a cauſe of iniquitie. Wherfore we be lerned by ſaynte Paule, that we muſt in ſuch wiſe, ſubdue our vnderſtandynge to fayth, that beleuyng, vndoubtedlye god is all iuſtice, we may not eſteme any thinge, certainly affirmed to be done by him to be vniuſte. For as ſaynte Chriſoſtome ſayeth. God ſeeth with other eyes then we do. And as the carpenter choſeth a peece of timbre,we can not atteyne the reaſon of goddes wo

of our iudgement be impoſſible to be ſette together. For ſo dydde Abraham beleue god in his promyſſe of the multiplication of his ſeede by Iſaac, and beleued god alſo, when he badde him go offre vp Iſaac in ſacrifice, and yet if Abraham vpon the cōmaundement of the offrynge of his ſonne, had debated with him ſelfe, howe the former promyſſe and the laſt commaundement, myght haue agreed together he ſhould not haue foūd howe to haue ioyned them in one truth. Whiche Abraham dyd not, but without ſtay (as the ſcripture reaporteth the ſtorye) went about, that he was commaunded to do, and leauyng the curioſitie of reaſonyng, beleued in hope agaynſte hope. And therefore lykewyſe where ſcripture ſignifieth to me gods prouidence &amp; predeſtinatiō, whiche ſhoulde ſeeme to take awaye,

and be repugnaunt to the free choice of man, foraſmuche as the ſcriptures be neuertheleſſe in that matter of fre choyce, alſo euident, I muſte beleue both to be true, as Abraham dyd, although I can not ſet them together. But lette vs returne to ſaynte Paule, who reiectyng ſuch blaſphemy of god, as to ſay that god hath iniquitie, doth not go about to proue that god hath no iniquitie, for we maye not require the profe therof, but as it is moſt true, ſo muſt we moſte certeynlye beleue it.A buſy witt

the golden calf, which aūſwer of god was, that god wold haue compaſſion of thē that he thought good to pardon, and ſhewe mercy to ſuche as it pleaſed him, wherby appeared, that amonge a multitude that offended a lyke to mans iudgement, god in miniſtracion of mercy vſed the pleaſure of his wil makynge a difference, in diſtribucion of his mercy, where mannes reaſon coulde perceiue no difference in the offence. So as neyther mans wyllynge or runnyng, atteyneth the effecte, but by the mercye of God. And after thys ſaynt Paule bringeth in the ſcripture of Pharao, whome God ſtirred vp to ſhew his vertue in him, and to ſhewe forth gods name, in the hole earth, in which Pharao, the withdrawynge of gods mercy which he obſtinatelye withſtode, notwithſtandyng ſo many myracles

wrought by goddes powre to call him to mercye, the ſaide Pharaos induracion, grewe and folowed in ſuch ſorte as mans reaſon wyll thereof gather and conclude whom ſo euer god wyll haue mercy on, he miniſtreth it vnto hym, and whoſe hart god wil harden, he hardeneth. And then it foloweth yt if this be ſo, god hath no cauſe to complayne of man, as the murmerer ſayth, who is faſhioned and placed after gods wyll which no man can reſiſte.Preyde by boldnes encreſith, and ſtayeth not til it come to the higheſt. Wherein ſaynte Paule learneth vs, to what iſſue the preſumptuouſe ſearchynge of goddes ſecrete iudgementes commethe vnto, whereby manne ſtudyeth to impute hys faulte to goddes ordenaunce, to arrecte all the blame to God, and excuſe our ſelf. And further ſaynt Paule teacheth vs, howe to repreſſe ſuche mennes arrogante temeritie,

So as in this paſſe of ſaynt Paule, ſaynt Chriſoſtome is very diligent to note and conferme vnto vs, that ſaint Paule myndeth not to empayre the true doctryne of mannes free choyce, gyuen of God, to be the cauſe of his owne dampnacion, by refuſynge goddes gyfte of grace, whereby he myghte be ſaued, and that the induracion of Pharao grew of his owne malyce, only by goddes ſufferaunce and permiſſion, and this doctrine hath euer ben in Chriſtes churche from the begynnyng,Symon Magus the fyrſte auctor of mere neceſſite. which Symon Magus dyd fyrſte impugne and was the fyrſte auctour of the hereſie of mere neceſſitie, whyche hereſie hath ben in ſundry ages renued,

as it hath ben of late by luther &amp; other, and not yet extinct. But let vs returne again to ſaynt Paule, who after he hath ſtopped the vnſhamefaſt mouth of the murmuringe Iewe, that wolde unpute the reiection of the Iues, to gods ordenaunce. Saynt Paule entendynge to declare where the cauſe of the Iewes fall, is to be ſought and founde, after certayne textes broughte oute of the prophetes Oſee and Iſaye, ſygnyfyenge before ſuche a reiection to be of the Iewes, Saynte Paule aſketh what ſhall we ſaye then, yf if be not to be attributed to goddes faulte or iniquytye? whyche is ouer greate blaſphemye, that the Iewes were caſte oute and the ientyles receyued. Quid dicemus? what ſhall we ſaye? where ſhall we fynde the cauſe of theyr reiection? Wherunto it is aunſwered

and a cauſe declared as foloweth, that the ientyles, not folowynge the iuſtyee of workes, embraced the very iuſtice by faith. And the Iſraelites folowinge the lawe of iuſtice, atteyned it not, becauſe they wente about to obteine it by workes and not by faith. So as finallye this leſſon we muſte learne, wherof ſaynt Paule ſpake in the begynnynge of the epiſtle. Deus uerax eſt, &amp; omnis homo mendax. And we muſte worſhyp gods truth, and accuſe our owne iniquitie.The cauſe

Thoſe

that be dampned muſte lamente their owne miſerie. Thoſe that be ſaued muſte glorye in god, who hath predeſtinate them, called thē, iuſtified them, and glorified them. And therfore death is a due ſould for ſynne, and lyfe euerlaſtynge due by the grace of god. What ſhall I ſaye nowe? haue I lerned you what is predeſtinatiō throughly? nay for ſothe. Nor I haue taken that vpon me. But thus much I know, that predeſtination doth not impugne the free choyſe of man, ne reſtrayneth the goodnes of god with acception of perſons, or diminiſſheth that ſentence of ſaynt Paule. Deus uult omnes homines ſaluos fieri, &amp; ad agnitionē ueritatis uenire. God wylleth all men to be ſaued and come to the knowledge of the truth. And chriſt bad preach the goſpell to all creatures. And god ſpeaketh by Ezechiell,

that if a ſynner to whome god had ſayde he ſhulde dye, lefte his wickednes and turned to him, he ſhalbe ſaued. And when ſoeuer a ſynner wayleth his ſynnes, he ſhall lyue: Now theſe defendours of mere neceſſitie, whyche they do myſvnderſtandynge predeſtinacion, they handell all theſe general places of ſcrypture, as though the ſpeache of God were lyke the common prouerbe, when the ſkye fall we ſhall haue larkes. Vnderſtandynge all ſuche condycyons as impoſſyble. So as when he that is neceſſitate to be dampned turneth to God, he ſhalbe ſaued. But ſuche one ſhall neuer turne, as the ſkye ſhall not fall. And ſo the textes I haue broughte in, ſuche as ſpeake generallye, be in theyr iudgementes to no purpoſe. And in deade they them ſelfes be ouerturned in their owne iudgement.

For and their opinion were true, there neded no preachynge,The inconuenience of mere neceſſitie. prayer, miniſtracion of ſacramentes, or any memory or remēbraūce of chriſt, but as the Turkes do, ones in a weke tell the people out of the ſtepyll, ye that are predeſtinate, ſhalbe of neceſſitie ſaued, ye that are not predeſtinate, ſhalbe of neceſſitie dampned. And ſo an ende of al other ſerche in that matter whiche hath no alteracion, after theyr fanſy, that dreame of neceſſitie. Here agayne, I am lyke to here ſomwhat that I ſpeake thus lyghtely of predeſtination.

as a great miſterie, the circumſtance wherof our capacities can not comprehende. And yet men haue reuerently traueled in the conſideracion of it. Saynt Auguſtine hath written a treatice, de predeſtinatione ſanctorum. And howe ſo euer men wold wreſt him to conferme their opinion of neceſſitie,Neceſſitie

You mayſter Ioye percace waxe wery of my bablynge (as ye wyll terme it) &amp; wyll aſke me what I meane? and interrogate me homely, what I wold ſay of predeſtination, and I coulde ſpeake? Surely to this tendeth that I haue ſpokē, that I

wolde predeſtinacion were honored as it ſhulde be, leſſe talked of,Predeſtinacion to be honoured. and better vnderſtanded, ſo much therof, as it hath pleaſed god to reuele to his churche. And for my ſelfe I note that ſaynt Auguſtine expoundyng the ſayenge of chriſt. Nemo uenit ad me niſi pater meus traxerit eum, in thexpoſicion thereof ſaieth. Si non traheris, ora ut traharis. Quem trahat, et quem non trahat, noli querere, ſi non uis errare. No man commeth to me (ſayeth Chriſte) onles my father draweth hym. In the expoſition whereof ſaynt Auguſtine ſaith: If thou beeſt not drawen, praye that thou mayeſt be drawen, but whome god draweth, and whome he draweth not, aſke not yf thou wylte not erre.An argumēt of mans reaſon in predeſtinacion, Nowe thus wyll mans reaſon tumble in this matter. If god hath decreed alreadye whom he wyll drawe, and whome

he wyl not drawe, then it is to late to praye to be drawen, or not nedefull, for god wil drawe as he hath determined, and none otherwyſe. And this reaſon extendeth to all maner of exhortacions, eyther to be not effectuall, as to late after predeſtination, or not nedefull, as I haue already ſaid. Out of this combre I rydde my ſelf eaſely, wt ſuche diſcuſſion, as I haue redde and learned of men exerciſed in ſcriptures, whiche is that when we ſpeake of God, with diſtinction of tyme, of anye worke done by god out of time, we ſpeake improperlye. Of that god worketh in time, we maye conuenientlye diſtinct the time. we may ſaye: God hath ſent his ſonne into ye world to redeme man, for it was in tyme (as ſcripture ſaieth) when the fulnes of tyme was. But when we ſaye god hath predeſtinate and

choſen vs before the begynnynge of the worlde, the ſpeache is not hable to expreſſe the matter, and ſemeth to ſignifie a tyme paſte where in deede there is none paſt. For there is no tyme paſte, where was no tyme, ſo as we muſte acknowledge thimperfitnes of our ſpeache, wherin the hollye gooſt ſpeaketh to imperfitte men. And therefore the pretertens rather declareth a perfection in thacte, then the paſſing ouer of the time in the acte. Like as (in hath glorified and hath iuſtified in them that be not yet borne) we vnderſtand not iuſtificacion &amp; glorificacion as an acte paſt, becauſe it is written in the pretertenſe, for then both in iuſtifieng and glorifieng, we muſt ſay, all is done before the begynnynge of the worlde, for the verbes expreſſynge the actes of iuſtificacion, and gloryfycatyon,

be put in the pretertenſe, that predeſtinaciō is written in. And ſo it we ſhoulde deduce oure argumentes from the tyme, we muſte ſaye that god hath iuſtified and glorified them at ones, with predeſtinacion, whiche were a playne abſurdite. And yet our imperfitte ſpeache ſo ſoundeth, as thoughe glorificacion were done with predeſtinacion. And albeit the pretertence ſignifieth in ſcripture the tyme to comme, as appereth in many places, yet in this place, quos iuſtificauit glorificauit, the futurtence can not fully expreſſe that is ſignified, for it is done vs to vnderſtande, that God whoſe workes be hydden in ſecrete, and who worketh continually, hath from the begynnynge fauoured man, and accordyng to his knowledge, hath before all tyme elected and predeſtinate, that is to ſay, before

the begynnynge of the world, and in tyme hath called, doth cal, and ſhall call, hath iuſtified, doth iuſtifie, and ſhal iuſtify, hath glorified, doth glorify, and ſhall glorifie, his electe and predeſtinate, in ſuche meaſure as his pleaſure hath appoynted. I do not here go about (good reader) blaſphemouſlye to depraue the ſcripture,The phraſe of ſcripture, conceyued by the holy goſt and to fynde fault at that whiche can not be better ſpoken, beinge the penne as we truely and certenlye beleue, directed by the holy gooſt, but to note vnto the howe the holye gooſt hath expreſſed the workynge of god in our ſaluacion in ſuche a part of ſpeache, as mighte ſignifie in ye ſame ſpeache a thing mooſt aſſured, whiche is the pretertence, for to our vnderſtāding, that is mooſt aſſured to be, that is paſt, and yet with god that ſhal be, is in like aſſurednes, as that is

alredy done. And therefore when we go aboute to deſcant in ſcripture, tyme, whych was not by that ſcripture ſygnyfyed vnto vs, we then fall ſtreighte in errour. As when we rede wrytten of god the father, that he hath begotten his ſonne, the ſeconde perſon in trinitie, if we ſhall in that verbe (genuit) hath begotten, cōſider tyme, as we do in an other ſcrypture (Abraham genuit Iſaac) Abrahā hath begotton Iſaac, we ſhoulde ſaye (whiche were folyſſhe) that god the father was before God the ſonne, as Abraham was before Iſaac, but in one place, the verbe ſignifieth the acte without tyme, when we ſpeake of god, and in the other, the acte with tyme. So as when the ſcripture telleth vs: God hath choſen, god hath predeſtinate, god hath forſeen al, god hath knowen all, before the

begynnynge of the worlde: here theſe verbes, hath choſen, hathe predeſtinate, hath ſene, hath knowen, do declare theſe actes in god, to be moſt perfyt, but not any ſuch time to paſſe as man dreameth of, for theſe actes in god, be without tyme, and aboue tyme, and ſo is ſygnified vnto vs, by thoſe wordes before the begynnynge of the worlde, when was no tyme, which wordes neuertheleſſe, mans curiouſe wyt vſed to an other ſignificatiō, to gather of them that thoſe actes be paſt in god, as done before the begynnynge of ye world, where as in deede, albeit thoſe actes of prouydence, election, and predeſtinacion, were in god moſt perfytte then, before the begynnynge of the world, yet they were not in God paſt then, for (paſt) ſignifieth an effluxiō of tyme, whiche is not in god who is eternall.

The vnlerned arrogant reader wyl here waxe angry that I ſhuld go about,An obiection by ſophiſtry (as he wold call it) to entangle plaine wordes, and to make hym beleue that before the begynnynge of the world is not yet paſt, &amp; then he wyll go luſtly forth to proue me a foole, yf the begynnynge of the worlde be not yet paſt, then the worlde is yet to begyn. And then you maiſter Ioye wil percaſe extende the matter further and ſay: If I be let alone, I wyll proue by ſophiſtrye and iuggelynge, that nothinge is paſt, and in dede if the begynning of the worlde be not paſt, nothing to vs is paſt, for in the worlde we be comprehended. But I ſay and affirme, the begynnynge of the world is paſt. Then wyll you reaſon thus: That whiche is before yt is paſt, that is much more paſte. As yf noon be paſt, much more the

mornynge of that daye is paſte. But I graunt that the beginning of the worlde, is paſt, ergo all that was before it, is much more paſt. And then further ye wyl reaſon thus. The electiō of god was before ye beginninge of the world, as faynt Paule ſayth, ergo the election of god is more then paſt, as done before the beginning of the world which is paſt.An aunſwer To this I aunſwer, that whē ye go about to meaſure gods workes with our wordes, ye come ſhorte, for oure ſpeache can not expreſſe, ne oure thought cōprehend the cirūſtance of gods worke, nether in tyme nor place. And Gregory Nazianzene wyſely noteth and alſo deuoutly, that if god coulde be throughlye comprehended of man, either in his thought or vnderſtandyng, god were not ſuperior to man. For what ſo euer is comprehended, is

leſſe then that comprehendeth it, &amp; therefore we muſt confeſſe truly that god comprehendeth all, and is in no wyſe holly comprehended. So much as ſcripture telleth vs of god, and his workes, wroughte in tyme, or aboue all time, ſo much we knowe illuminate by faythe, but when we wyll, by our conſideration, after the meaſure of oure owne vnderſtandynge, by thinges within the compaſſe of oure creacion (whiche in dede paſſe in tyme) eſteme goddes doynges before tyme, and call them paſt alſo becauſe they be before the beginning of the worlde: we deceyue our ſelfe as muche as if in conſyderatyon of place, we ſhoulde ſpeake of god as we ſpeake of men, that becauſe God is here he is not there, whyche no man is ſo madde to ſaye, becauſe God is euery where. And as man by participation of

goddes gyft, may in his thoughte and memorye, repreſente thinges paſte, with them that be preſente, withoute diſtaunce of tyme. And a man with his eye, withoute dyſtaunce of place or tyme in the action of ſeynge, conioyne together at ones, thynges whyche in them ſelfe be one farre frome an other, as I maye ſee houſes ſtandynge one .v. or .x. myle beyond an other, and ſhyppes ſaylynge one before, and one behynde an other a great dyſtaunce, and yet they be all together at ones, in the action of my ſyghte. So god who hath giuen man theſe giftes, beinge of hym ſelfe, in his knowledge and actions, moſt excellent, doth with his eye ſe, that is in the worlde, before and after, wythoute anye before or after, in his knowledge, and lykewyſe worketh wythoute tyme (that is to ſaye) choſeth and

predeſtinateth without anye (before or after, paſte or to come) whiche be onely diſtinctions of tyme. And yet we maye not gather hereof in goddes workes a confuſion,

And lerne this leſſon of humilitie, that gods ſecrete workes excede our capacitie, and may not therefore be meaſured by our language. For as the gentile philoſopher ſaied, of whome Gregorye Nazianzene ſpeaketh, in his worke. 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               . It is hard (he ſaid) to knowe god throughly, but impoſſible to expreſſe god in language. Wherein he noteth the colorable ſpeache of the philoſopher, to hyde his owne ignoraunce, as though he knewe more of god, then he could expreſſe where in god and his workes, the

tongue and harte be bothe imperfyt, and neyther ſufficient in that behalfe, and ſpecyally the tongue, and therefore we maye in no wyſe vnderſtande the ſpeach in the explycacyon of goddes actes, as of men, and thynke becauſe it is wrytten: God hath choſen, and hath predeſtinate, that therefore his choyſe and predeſtination be paſte, wherevpon to ground our argumentes, of (before and after paſt and to come) wherewith to deceiue our ſelf. Mary when ſo euer in ſcripture god knytteth tyme to his workynge, that worke muſte nedes paſſe with the time, as whē we rede howe god hath create the worlde, hath deſtroyed Sodome and Gomor, hath ouerwhelmed ye worlde with water, hath made promyſſe to Abraham, hath caſt Adam out of paradyſe, and ſuche infinite actes dome in tyme, thoſe

actes be called paſt by ſucceſſe of tyme. But when god putteth no tyme to his workynge, but declareth his workynges, to be withoute the compaſſe of tyme: it is the faulte of oure curyoſytye, to compaſſe ſuche an acte of God with the termes of (paſt or to come before or after) whiche be dyſtinctions of tyme, wherein we ſhould only confeſſe that god vndoubtedlye doth the acte, whiche ſcrypture affyrmeth god to do, and to profeſſe oure ignoraunce, of the circumſtaunces, howe it is done, and to be content with the ſence of ſcripture, without reaſonynge of the wordes,The election

when god offreth his gyftes vnto vs, we came to late, becauſe god in our fanſie, hath determyned his pleaſure alredy, that can not be chaunged: For the conſideration of tyme, whiche in our vnderſtandynge, paſſeth ouer, compared with the acte of god, beynge in dede withoute any tyme, encombreth our wyttes and vnderſtandynges in the conceiuyng of the matter, where as the tyme beynge diſſeuered in our vnderſtandynge, from gods acte, which tyme maketh to vs a thoughte of (before &amp; after) we be deliuered of the repugnaunce,Note this. that tyme dyd engendre, and oure argumentes taken away from naturall wytte, which were groūded al vpō time, wherby we be dryuen from reaſonynge to a ſilence, meruelynge and worſhyppyng as we ſhuld do alwayes the hyghe myſteries of

god, farre excedynge our capacite. And in this wyſe ſome haue learnedly &amp; reuerently entreated this matter, not with preſumption to diſcuſſe it abſolutely, but with an humble and reuerent meke ſpirite, to note that myght be truely conſidered in the ſame, and finally to lerne vs, that in dede, we knowe not, ne can not knowe this high matter thoroughly, becauſe the meanes of oure knowledge be taken away, and ſo the thynges hidden from vs, wherin we may not do as arrogant artificers, be accuſtomed to do, who when they perceyue not in dede the counſayle of hym that deuyſed fyrſt any platte, they take vpon thē neuertheleſſe, to ſet the frame together, &amp; marre ſome principal poſtes, or caſt them out as vaine, becauſe they can not tell howe to ioyne thē with the reſt whom ſuch mē folow, who becauſe

they can not tell howe to frame gods choiſe, &amp; mans choiſe togither, they mangle and denye mans choiſe, and caſt it away as vayne, beinge a principall parte to be beleued in our religion. Thus much as I haue redde and lerned, I vtter it wherby to teach you ſoberly, as muche knowledge as I haue (that is to ſay) ignoraunce, in this matter. In this ye mayſter Ioye wyll agree with me, that I haue toulde you ignoraunce, and call it meere ygnoraunce, and ſay I haue ſhewed my ſelfe, in toſſynge and ſyftynge of wordes to exercyſe the crafte of ignoraunce, not to teache but to blynd, not to giue lyghte but to darken, ſo as albeit ye rude men can not aunſwere, to the ſophiſtry of the argumentes, yet the matter in the vnderſtandynge (as ye wyll ſaye) remaineth as it dyd, for in what ſo euer wordes

we ſhuld ſpeake it, or though we want wordes to ſpeake it, the thing is thus in your opinion as foloweth. Fyrſt god is before man was. Ante

                   Abraham fieret ego ſum, Chriſt ſayd. And whether before ſignifieth tyme or no tyme, whereof your playne ſcolers wyll ſay they can no ſkyll, before is before and not after, and why call we it the prouidence of god, but becauſe it is a foreſight, and none after ſyght, ne withſight, &amp; predeſtination lykewiſe a former decre, &amp; preſcience, a former knowledge. And to charge me further, you mayſter Ioye, wyll note to youre ſcolers, that I my ſelf ſpeake ſomtyme after the ſame ſorte, and ſay, god choſeth vs fyrſt, &amp; god preuē
               teth vs with his grace, and what is preuenteth, but cōmeth before, and god prepareth mans wil, that is to ſaye, maketh ready before.

And god calleth, before he iuſtifieth, and god iuſtifieth before he glorifieth. And when ſcripture ſpeaketh of this ſort, &amp; I my ſelfe alſo, then (ye wyll ſaye) I make a trouble in the conſideration of tyme, and cauſe my tyme in wryting and yours in readynge, to paſſe ouer without fruit. For whē ye rede me, ye fynd your ſelfe perplexed, &amp; entangled with wordes, but whē ye haue wound your ſelf frō thoſe thorny wordes, the thing is in youre mynde as it was before. Hereunto I wil ſay ſomwhat that if ye like your ſelfe, in youre owne fanſy, ſo well as whatſoeuer ye conceiue for truth, is euer alſo to you true, in the ſorte ye comprehēd it: I marueile not though my wordes be not frutefull to you, for I go aboute to teache you ignoraūce, &amp; you be ſo aſotted and dotyng vpon the falſe perſuaſion of

knoweledge, that ye can not abide to haue your pleaſaunt opinion remoued and taken from you, As he that in his franſye thought all that he ſawe to be his owne, was ſorye, when he was healed of his franſye, thinkyng him ſelf to haue loſte a greate loſſe, to ſe hym ſelfe then ſo poore. For els, yf ye lyſt to make this foundacion, that man ſeeth no more of God then God hath ſhewed and reueled by his ſcriptures, and that all the ſcrypture is ſo vniforme in ſenſe, as it is al but one worde, which admitteth no repugnance or contrariete, and therewith remēbre, that wordes of ſcripture, althoughe in reſpecte of the matter they conteine, they be in dede &amp; be called holly, &amp; ſo to be reuerenced, and honoured, as an ymage repreſentynge gods wyll vnto vs, and therefore at the ſpeakinge of them, in preſence of

the multitude, do put of our cappe &amp; bowe,Englyſſhe ſpeache latelye made by englyſſh men (as we now ſpeake it) placed to expres god, or any godly thing, may be honored not with godly honor, but with reuerent behauiour without daunger of idolatry. yet thoſe wordes as wordes, be in dede wordes of our common language in Englyſſhe, and ſuche as diſſeuered and remoued a part from that hollymatter, men put to other prophane vſes, by reaſon whereof we may eaſlye deceiue our ſelues in them, and be daylye deceyued. And moreouer yf we coulde conſidre, that it is a more ſhame, cōfuſion and rebuke to vs, to be noted in an error, of bluſterynge knowledge, then to be accompted in the numbre of ſymple ignorauntes. And finally that in conſideration of god and his workes, after knowledge by faythe, that god certainly is, we ſhuld rather ſtudy to knowe, howe muche we knowe not of god, then to preſume to knowe all. He that were thus inſtructed, and prepared by gods grace, he wolde as diligently

lerne to condempne his owne knoweledge with his ignoraūce, as to auaūce his vnderſtanding, to that may be atteyned. And to ſuche one yf he conſidre, that is before written, I ſhall be ſeene, not only to haue touched the wordes, but alſo the matter, which I ſpecially entended, wherin I laboured to declare that ſcripture, whiche reueleth god vnto vs by faith, doth not in the wordes alwaies fully ſignify, that we gather of thē, but be written ſometime to do vs vnderſtand the thing to be in god, or wrought by him withoute cyrcumſtaunce of the meaſure of tyme, as we conceyue it. For when chriſt ſayd. Before Abraham was, I am, the tyme in this ſpeache, is not after our meaſure, for the preſente Tens, in God, is placed in the ſpeache before the pretertens in man, whiche in oure accompte

is contrarye. And as for prouydence, predeſtinacion, and preſcyence, that we take to ſignify with the actes tyme, ſignifieth perfection abſolute in God in thoſe actes, who in contemplacion of hym ſelfe, ſeeth and knoweth perfytelye and abſolutelye all his workes, choſeth alſo and predeſtinateth after his wyll, whyche is mooſte iuſte, and hathe no neede of anye admyny
                  •
               te or helpe of the cyrcumſtaunce of the thynge, or to abyde the beynge of it, and therefore ſcrypture ſayeth. God dothe it before all tyme, wythoute all place (that is to ſaye) before the begynnynge of the worlde, when there was neyther tyme nor place. But here ye wyll ſnappe at me, and leauynge tyme and place a part yet ye ſay ye may gether. Ergo it is done. Leaue (ꝙ you) the wordes, and ſpeake of

the thyng. If the election and predeſtinacion of god were done before the begynnynge of the world, they be not vndone nowe, and eyther the acte of election and predeſtinacion in God muſte be done, vndone, or doynge. For mans vnderſtandynge, concludeth it muſte be one of thoſe three. And ſurelye for ſo muche ye tell me trueth, for mans vnderſtandynge can go no further. And yf ye could proue me therewith that mans vnderſtandynge maye penetrate throughly al goddes ſecretes, and then haue language to vtter it, ye had ſayde then the hole matter, or elles yf ye can not do that (as ye can not in dede) ye muſte to ye foreſayd three (done, vndone, or doynge) putte a fourte, that is to ſaye, or elles ye can not tell, what to ſaye in it, and in that fourte, I wolde yelde vnto you. For that is the verye leſſō
               
I wolde lerne you, to ſay, you could not tel. For yf you ſhal come to your thre (done, vndone, or doing) conteyned within the capacitie of mans wytte, and peruſynge them in ordre, thinke of election &amp; predeſtination in god, as done, in ſuch wyſe as done ſoundeth to vs an act paſt, and frame theſe principall poſtes of election and predeſtination, in that ioynt, and pleaſe your ſelf in it, as wel ſet together, ye ſhal fall to the abhomination of mere neceſſitie, &amp; marre the two principall poſtes, whiche god hath ordered to be ſette vp in the frame of our ſaluaciō, fre wil, and fre choyſe. And if fleyng from that inconuenience, whiche muſte nedes be fled, we ſhall go about to frame theſe poſtes of election and predeſtination, with the ioynte of (vndone) and becauſe ye dare not call them done, call them vndone.

that were euen as wyſely done of vs, as if a man wolde frame a tenaunt without a morteſſe. For we can not ſaye election and predeſtination in god, as vndone, whiche were as muche to ſaye as they be not, and then ſcripture ſayth the contrary▪ And yf we ſhulde ſaye, the election and predeſtinacion of god is doyng, whiche is the thyrd mortes of that we can geſſe at, it ſhulde ſignifie an imperfection in ye which were blaſphemy to thinke in god, for goddes workes be perfit, as him ſelfe is mooſt perfytte. In man who by participacion of god, hath excellent gyftes, we may ſe, that he that is cunnyng, doth at ones conceyue, and perfitly cōprehend either ſuche matter as he wil vtter in ſpeach to the eare, or in any corporall demonſtracion to the eye. The carpenter for example as he excelleth in cunnynge ſo dothe

he conceyue ſo muche the more ſodenly, &amp; with a ſmal ſhort thought repreſent to hym ſelfe all the hole frame of that he wyll worke perfitely, which hath a longer tyme in vtterynge of it, and hath a dyſtaunce of doinge whiles the carpenter draweth it in paper, and afterwarde a longer doyng, whyles he ſetteth it forth in ye matter. But the abſolute acte in the craftes man, which was in the mathematicall repreſentation, that is to ſaye, deuyded from corporall matter, that act in the vnderſtandynge hadde no doynge in anye perceptible diſtance, but was paſt doynge and perfytted in a momente, in a very connynge exerciſed man. Wherefore if we maye thus thinke of an excellēt craftes man in his doynges, and ioyne to the acte a perfection in a momēt, it were an abſurdite to thinke

of god leſſe excellencie and cal his acte yet doinge, whoſe actes be perfited with leſſe then a thought, and can not be, but incontinētly perfit, in him that is all perfitnes it ſelf. Here I looke ye wyll ſay thus, yf we agree herein we muſt ſay further, ye man can not thynke the election and predeſtinacion in god perfit, onleſſe he thynketh thē done, for that is perfit ye is done, or els if it be not done it is not perfyte. And afore I ſayde, we may not thinke of them as done, ſo as by the ſame reaſon, we may not thynke of them as perfytte. Note well (reader) that I ſhall now ſay, and conſidre,

                  ds ſecretetes. howe muche goddes actes excede mans vnderſtanding in al actiōs of man, wether we cal them done or perfyt, though they haue but an inſtante or a moment, for the doinge and perfection of them: yet there is in them all of

thoſe that be done, by the leſte and ſhorteſt thought,The leſte thought of man hathe thre partes. thre thinges to be conſidered. A beginnynge of thacte, an ende of it, &amp; a mouynge from the begynninge to thende. As for example, In the connynge craftes man, in conceyuynge of the matter, he wyl ſpeake or make in plat, or in a muſician, that deuiſeth with a maruelouſe celeritie, the deſcant that he playeth vpon his inſtrument, which is a wonderfull ſwiftnes and agilite of the powers of the ſoule, in theſe actions there is none ſo ſhort, ſo ſwift &amp; fyne, but there is a begynnyng, and from ye ende of begynnynge, a mouyng to thende of perfection, by which thre cōſiderations, we iudge of our actes as done and perfit. Nowe of god, we be lerned to ſaye trulye, that before ye world there is no begynnynge, as we vnderſtand begynnyng, and ſo

not the begynnynge ende of anye acte. In god alſo there is no mouynge at all, for what ſo euer moueth is iudged thereby imperfyt, for mouynge declareth a want of that wherevnto it mouethe, whyche in god can not be. In god alſo there is no ende at al. So as thoſe thre, whereby we conſider done, vndone, doyng, and perfit among men, be clerelye taken away from our conſideration in God, and yet for wāt of more perfit knowledge and more perfytte ſpeache, we be bolde to ſpeake of god, with ſuche wordes as we haue in our tonge, whereby we may not take further boldenes to go through, and meaſure goddes actes either by oure wordes or ymaginacion to be like ours. For in the begynnynge of the goſpell of ſaynt Iohn̄ where ſaynt Iohn̄ ſayeth of the ſeconde perſon the very worde of god (In

the begynnynge was the worde) yf a man ſhulde haue the ſame ymagination of a begynnyng ſpoken of god as he hath of a begynnynge, when he ſpeaketh of the begynnyng of ſaynt Iohn̄s goſpell, and becauſe the goſpell hathe an ende to begynne at, that god hath alſo an ende to begynne at, for ſo hath euery thinge that begynneth as man conceyueth it, or els there is not in oure ymaginacion a begynnynge, we ſhoulde gather by ſaynt Iohn̄ that god is not eternall, becauſe he was in the beginnynge as the wordes of ſaynte Iohn̄ ſpeake playnly to our ymaginacion, ſuch as our reaſon conceyueth, fanſyenge an ende to euerye begynnynge whyche ende when we can not fynde, we ſaye that thinge hath no begynnyng, as a rounde cyrcle in conſideratiō of it ſelfe hathe no begynnynge,

becauſe it hath no diſtinction in one place more then other to begynne at. And yet ſpeakynge of god without end, we vſe the word (beginnynge) for we haue none other worde to ſpeake, and ſo lykewyſe of goddes knowledge, election, and predeſtination, we ſpeake by ſuche wordes as we haue, ſignifienge them vnto vs as done and perfyt, and ſo be they in dede, but not as our actes be done and perfit, and therefore to be called paſte and perfytte whereby there ſhulde be in thaction a mouinge from the begynnynge to the ende, but they be done, as god worketh without tyme, where is not paſte and perfyt, as god worketh moſt perfytely, that is to ſaye, in ſuche wyſedome and perfection as mās reaſon can not comprehend, ne cā therefore ſkyll to frame the doing of them, with mans free wyll, and

free choiſe to be the cauſe of eche mans owne dampnacion without iuſt murmure of the want of goddes election. And therefore if mās buſye preſumptuous wit could be cōtent to let alone that is not lerned hym to knowe, but onelye to worſhyppe and occupye hym ſelf, in that he is commaunded to do, he ſhulde no more trouble him ſelf herewith, then amonge maſons, the hewers and ſquarers of ſtone trouble theyr mayſter maſon, to queſtion with hym howe ſuch and ſuche a molde appoynted them to worke after, aunſwereth in the tracynge, and wyll agree in the worke, amonge whome, becauſe they haue conceyued a reuerente opinion of the mayſter maſon, cō
               feſſynge their ignoraunce not to atteyne his highe knoweledge, euery man as is preſcrybed hym worketh in ſilence ſomewhat leyſurly

(men ſay of maſons) for their own eaſe, but yet they worke. God whoſe wyſedome is incomprehenſible, whoſe knowledge is aboue all knowledge, and connynge aboue all connyng, hath traced the plat of the building of his church, and hath for a mould where after to ſquare the ſtones, ſent our ſauiour chriſt into the world whom he hath willed vs to heare and folowe, beynge his very ymage and the manifeſtacion of his wil, commaundynge all his ſtones to be ſquared after that moulde, wherwith becauſe god for oure comfort telleth vs, that he hath care of the ſquarynge of the ſtones, and therfore hath before the begynnynge of the worlde choſen and predeſtinate thoſe that ſhalbe ſquare ſtones, we leaue workyng and ſquarynge after the mould deliuered vnto vs whiche is commaunded,

and fall to queſtionyng and muſynge, howe god worketh him ſelf his ſecrete worke of election and predeſtination, without excluſion of our worke in free choyce and free wyll, the inquiſicion whereof is forbiddē, as aboue our capacite. And therefore ſaynt Auguſtyne ſayde: Searche not who is drawen if thou wylt not erre, and byddeth euery man praye that he maye be drawen, whiche implyeth in his iudgemente, howe that man maye be yet choſen and be yet predeſtinate, as we can ſpeake of it, or elles why ſhulde he bydde him pray to be drawen. And when we exhorte men by examples in the ſcripture to vertue, our ſpeach conteyneth the ſame. And when ſaynte Paule ſayeth, he ſuffreth for the electes that they myght be ſalued, and ſaynt Peter exhorting men to make theyr election certayne

by good workes, both theſe greate apoſtels do the churche of god to vnderſtande (in the buyldynge wherof they haue ben two principall ſtones) that goddes election is ſo done by him, as it importeth no neceſſitie in man but requireth a conformite in vs agreable for the ſame, which conformite we can not haue but of god and yet not hauynge that, we can not be called truly choſen and predeſtinate. Saynte Paule to the Colloſſen. wryteth in this wyſe. You that were ſometyme abalienate and enemies in mynd in euyl workes, nowe god hath reconciled you, in the body of his fleſſhe, by his death, that he ſhulde bring you fourth holy without reproche &amp; without blame, in his ſighte, ſo that you continue grounded and ſtable in fayth, ne be not moued from the hope of the goſpel. Conſyder

this texte of the apoſtell which doth men reconciled, to vnderſtand, that they muſt perſeuer, continue, &amp; not be remoued frome the hope of the goſpell, ſignifieng that the reconciliacion of god, implyeth no neceſſite of cōtinuaunce, but they maye ſwarue, they maye fall, and therefore doth admoniſh them there of. Wherefore he wanted not depe knowledge, that ſaid as ſcrypture doth vs vnderſtand, that Thomas predeſtinatus, ioynynge thoſe two wordes in the matter truly together, non poteſt damnari, for the deuyll can not take out of goddes hande that is his, and yet neuertheleſſe diſſeuer the worde with the matter of predeſtinatus, from Thomas, and ſpeakynge of the ſame Thomas we maye ſaye by ſcripture. Thomas poteſt damnari. For goddes predeſtinacion as a ſuperioure

cauſe doth not violentlye worke to the compulſion of the inferior cauſe. And god doth ſo worke in his knowledge, election, and predeſtinacion, and with ſuch ſecrecie, as we can not take anye ſuch knowledge of thactes of election and predeſtinaciō applied to any man whereby to diſproue his ſayenge to any man perticularly. Thou mayeſt be damned by thine owne ſynne, and lykewyſe to euery perticuler man. Thou maieſt be ſaued by goddes mercy, be the one neuer ſo vertuouſe, at the tyme of my ſpeakynge, or the other, neuer ſo muche a ſynner. But to whome ſo euer we maye trulye ioyne. predeſtinatus, we muſt ſaye of that man non poteſt damnari. And albeit I ſhalbe iudged of ſome to entangle this matter more then neadeth, yet wrytyng to learned and vnlearned I

had rather abyde that checke then to pretermytte any thynge, that I thynke myght ſerue to the clearynge of ſuche notes as haue ben made of the ſcryptures by ſome of ſymplicitie, &amp; ſome of crafte &amp; miſcheif, wherwith to encombre the truth of ye catholique fayth, wherin to comprehend ſuche perſuaſiō of god (as though he wrought in election and predeſtinacion neceſſarily) is a maruelouſe ſubuerſion of the hole, as I haue before ſaid, and yet the wordes of ſcripture be marked to ſound ſo, as when ſcripture ſpeaketh of the lytle flocke to be by god ſpeciallye preſerued, and howe the electes can not peryſſhe and God preſerueth his electe, wyth the induracion of Pharao, the reprouynge of noughtye men, which truthes be mooſt certaynlye true. For Deus uerax eſt, and yet bicauſe it is euen as true,

that omnis homo mendax, therfore as god can not fayle in his promyſſe, ſo man maye fayle in the receyuinge and reteynynge of that is promiſed,Note that I ſay not eche manſhal, but 
                     •
                  ay. and alſo eche man may. And therfore the admonitions and exhortacions in ſcripture to eſchewe fallyng, and to ariſe agayne, be fruitfullye made to the electe, not ſo as thoughe Thomas electe, myght be dampned, for that is impoſſible, but ſo as (Thomas) ſpeakynge of the ſame (Thomas) may be dampned. Onely god worketh election and predeſtinacion, and onely god can ioyne thē truely with Thomas or Iohn̄, mary Thomas and Iohn̄ may preſume, and that waye play the foole, to ioyne them ſelues, by ſuche newe belefe as the deuyll by his poſtelles frameth now a daies to election and predeſtinaciō, and ſaye as one hath ſayde to me, I

know my ſelf predeſtinate. I meruayle where he had learned that leſſon beyng yet quycke and quethynge and ſuche one as myghte fall. S. Auſten although he knew the leſſon very harde and wolde we ſhulde not ſearche, whome god draweth and whome he draweth not, yet in his worke (de predeſtinatione) he ſemeth to giue a forme, to lerne predeſtinacion, ſayenge. Diſce excurſu predeſtínacíonem. &amp;c. So as they that flye vyce, and choſe vertue, and runne in vertue gladlye, and aſcend frome vertue to vertue they may well be aſſured, that the profyt in vertue is by goddes helpe and grace, and when they are in payment of the generall tribute (for ſynne) which is corporall death,The leſſō o

of the leſſon of predeſtination and acknowledge the election of god in them, with a certayne hope and expectation of that is prepared for goddes electe, but whiles men be wauerynge in the ſee of this worlde before they be arryued in the hauen, of paſſage from this lyfe, ſuche talkers and reaſoners of goddes election and predeſtinacion, to perſuade neceſſite, do it not for any godly fruite, but for a worldely lewde pollicie, to exclude from ſinne, both ſhame and blame to the worlde, which twoo amonges manye, let and hyndre many carnall pleaſures, and where neceſſitie is perſuaded, can not in dede haue place. For who is to be blamed, for that he can not eſchue▪ or who ſhulde be a ſhamed of that he can not auoyde? Wherefore ſhulde ſaynt Paule excommunicate the Corrinthian and blame

hym for his fornicacion? or ſaynt Peter againſt Ananie and Saphira his wyfe, gyue a ſentence of ſuch efficacie, as wherevpon ſhuld folowe corporall death for lyenge, wherein they myght haue pleded, if neceſſitie had ben by the lerning of theſe two chiefe apoſtelles approued, that they did as they were ordered and walked as perſonnes not choſen but indurate, whether neceſſitie ledde them by god appoynted. But the true teachynge of chriſtes churche abhorreth neceſſitie, and yet worſhyppeth for mooſt certayne truthes, goddes prouidence, election, and predeſtinacion, whereby we be taughte that god is auctor of al our helth, welth and ſaluacion, the cyrcumſtaunce of which workyng in god in his election and predeſtinaciō, althoughe it be as impoſſible for mans wit to frame wt our choyſe

and free wyll, as to deuiſe howe a camell ſhulde paſſe through the eye of an nedle, withoute makyng ye nedles eye bygger or the camell leſſe, yet yt is impoſſible for man, is not impoſſible for god, And in that belefe we ought to acquite our ſelfe, and not be aſhamed to lerne and confeſſe ignoraunce in theſe high miſteries, wherein an arrogante proude curiouſe wit ſhould clerely be put to ſilence, &amp; yet neuertheleſſe a ſobre humble ſpirite by a deuout ſearche and conſideracion may lerne ſomewhat, wherewith to repreſſe and ſubdue the temptaciōs of carnall reaſon euer murmuringe to the contrarie. For which purpoſe all the holy fathers of ye greke church and beſides ſaynt Auſten, other of the latten alſo, haue reuerentlye ſpoken ſomewhat of lyght in the matter of election and predeſtinacion

by diſtincting goddes knowledge, from his election, as the cauſe from the effect, and thus cō
               ſidered of god. That god in his hye counſayle determining to create man, he ſawe and knew mans fall, whiche knoweledge coulde be no cauſe of thalteration of his decree to create man, for then we ſhulde graunte in god mutabilitie of his decree by his knowledge but there with god decreed to repare and reſtore that falle in man, and by the aboundaunce of his goodnes, and by the renouacion of man in his redemption, to encreaſe mans felicitie. In which renouacion of man, god choſeth as he ſeeth in his diuine prouidence thoſe that ſhall receyue and vſe his gyftes accordynge to his wyl, and reproueth them that he ſeeth before wyl refuſe them and worke theyr owne confuſion, and ſo predeſtinateth

ſuch as he hath choſē, by whiche ordre gods knowledge is the cauſe of his election, goddes election the cauſe of his predeſtination, predeſtinacion the cauſe of callynge. &amp;c. After which declaration mans reaſon coulde not gather, that gods knowledge of that is to come, ſhulde more be ye cauſe of that he knoweth before to come after, then mannes knowledge, to be the cauſe of that is paſt, whiche by gods gyft man knoweth with god. Herein god is not compared with man, but aunſwer is made to the carnall reaſon, whiche men make amyſſe of god. Gods knowledge they ſaye is infallible in all thinges that ſhalbe, and that is mooſt true, but the infallibilitie is no kynde of cauſe, of the thynge thereby ſo to be cauſed, to be, but onelye an aſſuraunce that the thynge as it is knowen of God▪
               
ſhall ſo be. God is the cauſe of all cauſes, and in the creacion of all natures and recreacion of mans nature, by grace, hathe ordered thinges to moue and worke by theyr immediate ſpeciall cauſes, not all neceſſarilye, but ſome with interruption and ſome caſuallye and principallye aboue all, man by fre choyſe of that is offred him, by whiche excellent gift man differeth from other creatures. Now as god hath ordred the worlde, ſo he moſt perfytely knoweth it, that is to ſaye, that is neceſſary, euen ſo neceſſary, that is caſual, caſual, that is of mannes free choyſe, as wroughte by mannes free choiſe. And euery thing as it is wrought, God knoweth it wroughte, knowynge them as doone by the inferioure cauſes, not orderynge them ſo to be done by his prouydence or infallible knowledge.

Here reaſon ſpoorneth and ſayth, god myght haue chaūged it, when he ſawe it ſhoulde ſo be, and not haue made man inclineable to fal, when he ſawe he wolde fall before he made hym. Here is a homelye talke of god. And hitherto men come, when they forget their reuerence, and dutye to God, to be ſo perte with god as to controll his workes. Nowe men be ſuffred to loke on gods ſecrecies, they wyll begyn to tell hym howe he myght haue done better. But yet he that thus replieth muſt fyrſt confeſſe, yt the knowledge of god although it be infallible, yet it is not the cauſe of all that is knowen, for in knowledge, god onely ſeeth mooſt perfitly the workes of al natures, as they be, and mannes reaſon that wolde fynde faulte, can not conſidre goddes knowledge to be in prioritie to goddes decre, to create

man, wherby that knowledge as it folowed, and was no cauſe of it, ſo it coulde be no cauſe whye to alter it, and then carnall reaſon muſte be aunſwered as in the lyke a carnall man wold iudge. A carpenter that determineth to make a houſe, and therein a doore, yf he hadde therewith the gyfte of prophecie to knowe thynges to come, and ſo to ſe, that theues ſhoulde after go in at that dore, and robbe the houſe, wolde ye call in mans reaſon the carpenter the cauſe of the robbery, becauſe he made the houſe with a dore at whiche dore he ſawe the theues ſhulde entre? If the carpenter were charged in reaſon therewith, and with his knowledge before, he wolde for him ſelf ſay: I made a houſe whiche of conuenience to be a houſe, required a doore, and therefore I made the doore, not for the theues

thabuſe it, which I ſawe wold folowe, but for the owner to well vſe it, and then if the carpenter did therewith before, bydde the owner take hede of the daunger, lyke to folowe, what canne be ſayde further to the carpenter? who myghte reaſonablye alledge yf he ſhoulde haue made no dore at al, he ſhulde not haue made a cōuenient houſe, for withoute a doore, it hadde not ben perfitelye a houſe. Can anye man further replye to this carpenter, onleſſe a man wolde ſaye, that the carpenter was alſo after, the thefe hym ſelfe, as men wyll not feare to ſaye of god blaſphemouſlye, that he is the auctoure of euyll. Nowe if carnall reaſon muſte nedes admytte this in the carpenter: whye ſhoulde the ſame reaſon ſpurne agaynſte God to make hym the cauſe, becauſe when he ſawe howe man wolde abuſe

free wyll which he gaue hym, that yet god gaue it hym where the deuyll entred, as at the doore, and robbed him. God gaue man that excellente gyfte of free wyll for an ornamente and a conuenient vſe, and admonyſſhed man to beware of the miſuſynge of it to diſobedience, gyuynge a lawe to be obſerued, as matter wherin to exercyſe his free wyll. If God hadde made man withoute free wyl and immutable, he hadde not ben then properly man, hauynge mutabilitie to good and euyll as a difference from god, a body corporall to differre from aungels, and free wyll and free choyce, to differre from other beaſtes vnreaſonable. And is not he a ioylye workeman that wolde deuyſe to haue God doone, otherwyſe then he hathe, or elles becauſe malyce haue wrought in mā malyce, wold take

god for immediate cauſe of all ye is done, which were abhominable blaſphemouſe abhominatiō withoute all reaſon, and agaynſte all lerninge? God is ye ſuperior cauſe, without which nothinge worketh,

conſidre what they ſayd or graunted as they gaue thereby none aduauntage to the aduerſarie who ſtudieth onely to inuade and violate the truthe. Saynt Auſten in contencion with the Maniches was very precyſe for free wyll whiche they impugned, and with the Pelagians was preciſe in defence of grace, whiche they impugned, and for defence of the truth, whiche he ſawe brought in daunger, fought with ſcriptures lyke a ſtoute champion, as Dauyd with his ſtones to ouerthrowe Golias, wherin howe ſo euer ſaynt Auſten diſſented from the reſt, it is not to be accōpted as a diſagremente in any truth neceſſarye for our edification, but as the feate of a wyſe warriar for defence of truth to eſchue ſuch occaſion as noughtie men wold gather for ye ſubuerſion of ye truth. And in this wyſe good

men learned, maye humblye diſagre with a deuoute intente to defende the truth, whyche we ought not ſo peruerſly to take as though all ſuche good mens labours and trauailes in thexpoſicion of ſcriptures were to be contempned, and as though eche man by hym ſelfe alone coulde vnderſtande and expound ſcriptures in the true ſenſe, whiche aſſeueracion howe true it is the prodigiouſe and monſtruouſe opinions whiche haue ben, and be at this daye, gathered of ſcryptures do declare, wherein as god dyd in the buyldynge of the towre of Babylon, to depreſſe that arrogant enterpryſe, confounde the vnderſtandynge in one tunge,Confuſiō of

And therfore we muſt remembre, althoughe ſcrypture be the foundacion and grounde of al truth, yet it is darke and obſcure to ſenſes vnexercyſed, and god geueth not all, the ſpirite of prophecye, and yet god hath geuen it in his church to many who haue left it teſtified in their labours, not ſo as ſometyme they ſhewe not them ſelfes as men, and to ſpeake of thē ſelfe (and therefore muſte be ſo warelye and yet reuerently redde) but ſo as their conſonaunce and agremente togyther in the matter of doctryne where they agree,

Of whom togither with the ſcryptures I haue learned, to ſpeake of predeſtinatiō as I haue written, and of iuſtification thus: That god only iuſtifieth man, accordyng to the ſcripture before alleged, Quos uocauit, iuſtificauit, and in an other place, Deus iuſtificat. And herein the worlde maketh no controuerſy. A controuerſie there is, howe God worketh this iuſtification in man, whether to iuſtifie man, he giueth hym one gyfte of fayth or two gyftes of

faith &amp; charitie. And in this cōtrouerſie, one thing is very peruerſe, that thoſe which ſaye that god iuſtifieth man, with one gift of faith onelye, wyll be ſeene more to extol god in his fauour vnto man, then they that ſaye God geueth three gyftes in the iuſtificacion of man. And becauſe the worde (onely) that hath and doth meynteyne muche bablynge, hath ben ioyned by thē: to fayth, to ſay that onely fayth iuſtifieth, to defende yt, they trouble the people with a fyne diſtinction of offices, &amp; ſay that in iuſtificacion of man, it is ye onely office of fayth to iuſtifie, &amp; charitie and hope, there waytynge without office whiles the man be iuſtified.A prety ſhif

And fyrſt ye bryng in that if Wincheſter hath done al that god hath commaunded hym, he is but a ſeruaunt vnprofitable. And this text of ſcripture ye bringe in to dimynyſhe the eſtimacion of good workes. And thus gods holly ſcrypture is prophaned by you, ye wold be ſene to vtter onely that the ſpirite of god telleth you, with ſuche a mere ſincerite, yt it hath nether hony nor waxe.An expoſitiō of the ſcripture, that we be ſeruaūtes vnprofitable For this text of ſcripture is wrytten to admoniſhe vs what a good lord we ſerue of god, who hauyng no cōmoditie or profyt by our ſcruyce, doth neuertheleſſe alowe and commend our ſeruice.

So differeth the ſeruice of god and the deuyll, the ſeruyce of god from the ſeruice of man. For the ſtate of a ſeruaunte amonge men is to do their maiſters profit, and not their owne, forſomuch as they be ſeruauntes. And therefore to an euyl ſeruaunt it is ſaid commonly as a rebuke. Thou arte a leude ſeruaunt, thou ſekeſt thyne owne gaine and not thy mayſters. But in the ſeruice of god, ſuch as be ſeruauntes profeſſe openly, and truly affyrme, that they be vnprofitable to theyr lorde god, as the text by you broughte in teſtifieth, who nedeth no ſeruyce of vs, ne can not be increaſed or diminiſhed by profyt or lacke of oure ſeruice. And yet he hathe ſo muche care of our welth, that albeit oure ſeruyce is not profitable to him, yet he cō
               mendeth it becauſe it is profitable to vs, and therfore ſaith to a good

ſeruaunt, Euge. Well ſayde ſeruaunt that art good and faythful, becauſe thou arte faythfull in a fewe, I ſhall appoynte the, ouer more. And moreouer declarynge howe our ſeruice is profitable to our ſelfe he byddeth vs, yf we wyll entre into lyfe, to kepe the commaundementes. And ſo that ſcripture that is wrytten to teache vs one thynge ye bringe it in for an other. Bycauſe god putteth vs in remēbraunce of the nature of our ſeruice to him that he hath no profyt by it, whereby we ſhuld knowledge his gratuitie and goodnes to be ſo much the more towardes vs, ye wolde we ſhoulde take it, that god careth not for oure workes in his ſeruice, and yet we be delyuered (as the prophete ſayeth) from the handes of enemies, to ſerue him in ſantite and holynes all dayes of our lyfe.

And after this ſorte the ſcriptures be broughte in by you, and other of your ſect, al out of purpoſe they were written for. And yet when ſome ſo do, then they boſte moſte, that they bring nothing but ſcripture, and the word of god, and the mere truth, playne ſpeache, ſimple language without iugglynge, ſophiſtrie or mannes tradicions. And when al commeth to al, for ſo muche they bryng a truth in dede, but to a wronge purpoſe, as is a hatchet to open y• locke, which can do but burſt it, and yet can not be denied but it is a good hatchet, &amp;

good to cleue wood. And ſomtyme againe the ſcripture they brynge in is euen as dull (to the purpoſe it is brought in for) as is a keye to cleue woode. After which ſort predeſtinacion, beynge ſignified vnto vs, for our comforte, to declare what care god hath of vs, whereby we ſhoulde be more encouraged to worke hauynge god to our helpe, the ſame is vſed as an hatchet to open the locke, wherby the leſſe to care for our workes, vpon pretenſe that god hath done all. And lykewyſe in many other places of ſcripture, yf I wolde tarye to reherſe thē. But nowe I wil return to you maiſter Ioye, &amp; where ye appoſe me whether when I cō

beleued it was and is effectuall to me in my baptiſme, wherein I obteyned remiſſion of ſynnes, and renouacion of lyfe. I haue beleued, and beleue it alſo effectuall vnto me, in the ſacrament of penaunce, whereby to recouer the ſtate of grace, from whiche ſyth the tyme of my baptiſme, I haue dyuers times fallen by ſynne. And lykewiſe I haue beleued and beleue that in the vſe of all the other ſacramentes, as it hath pleaſed god to ordeyne them, Chriſtes paſſion is effectuall by worke of God in thē, to conferre grace vnto vs. And generallye I haue and do beleue the paſſion of chriſt to be effectual vnto me, when ſo euer and as often as I by the grace of god, purchaſed by the ſame paſſion, do vſe my ſelfe in fulfyllynge of gods wyll, as the ſcriptures and the true vnderſtanding of them, teach me, the

obſeruacion of whiche teachynge, ye may call and it pleaſe you (and ye wyll nedes make me thauthor whiche I haue not hitherto taken vpon me) Wincheſters condicion.

is as ſcripture enfourmeth me, that he that is called, muſte do ſo muche as goo, when he is called, with the helpe of the caller, withoute whych he can not goo. And this is alſo one of Wyncheſters workes. And when God ſayeth, beleue, I muſte beleue. And this is a nother of Wyncheſters workes. And when God ſayeth, loue, and gyueth the gyfte of it: I muſt loue, or elles remayne in deathe. And this is a nother of Wyncheſters workes. And al theſe workes whyche ſeme a greate heape of workes, be conteyned in the condycyon that muſte be fulfylled for obteynynge the effecte of Chryſtes paſſyon, beynge remiſſion of ſynne, and a newe ſtate of lyfe.

And thus I taughte Barnes, and otherwyſe then thus (whiche is the catholyque belefe) I thanke God I haue not beleued, nor I dare not be ſo boulde (as ye be) to frame my ſelfe anye other pryuate beleue, vppon confydence of the texte of ſcrypture ye brynge, whyche is lyke a keye to cleaue a logge:Scriptur

Eche man muſt do after the tyme of his callyng, as the parable teacheth. And he that is called at .viii. of the clocke, may not ſtande ydle tyll eleuen, and fall to worke then, to make a

ſhorte ende, as ſome do, that faſſhion them ſelfe to vſe the pleaſures of the worlde ſo longe as their bodies may ſuſteyne, with mynde to ſerue god when they can not tel elles what to do. Such mē ſearch ſcripture to knowe who hath done leſt, that they may do as lytle as he. And if they that be gyuen to ſtelynge, wolde ſtudye in ſcripture the mercye ſhewed to the thefe hanginge on the croſſe, to thintent they might haue leſſe care for their lyfe in the meane ſeaſon: were not ſuche learnynge fruteles and perniciouſe to the commō welth? And after this like ſort doth Ioye handle ye ſcriptures, and goeth aboute with his hatchet to open the locke, and with his key to cleue logges.

And in a nother place, to hope, as Spe ſalui ſumus, we be ſaued by hope. And we muſte omit no parte of the truthe, but ſo vnderſtande one, as all may be comprehended. And here I note vnto the (reader) this maner of ſpeache in ſcripture. Thy fayth hath ſaued the, without mencion of Chriſtes paſſion, and without mention of god, as though a man might arrogantlye

ſaye: I haue ſaued my ſelf, my fayth hath ſaued me, wher by euery man myght be noted his owne ſauiour. But this were blaſphemouſe ſophiſtrie, euen ſuch as men vſe nowe a dayes, when they wyll impugne ſuche deuout ſpeaches as hath ben vſed in ye church, when eche man exhorteth other to ſaue his owne ſoule, or deſyreth an other to ſaue his neighbors ſoule, or els moueth hys frende by almeſſe, prayer, faſtynge, and good deades, to worke the welth of his ſoule.

ye ſe playnelye into what confuſyon he bringith hym ſelfe, and what it is to reaſon by his own witte withoute any worde of ſcrypture. Wolde God the papyſtes hadde no wyſer diuines to defende theyr falſe relygyon, ſelden are theſe popyſhe lawers good deuines. He ſaith he maye do well, and I ſaye he maye do euyll to. It becōmeth a lerned mā ſo to cōferre the ſcriptures trewly vnderſtāden that▪ he be fewer &amp; certayn of his concluſyon.

The lorde amende hym before Maye, or elles take hym ſhortly awaye. Amen. Bycauſe Win. hath no ſcripture to proue his concluſyon, I wyll helpe hym, but yet I commende Standiſh agenſt Doctor Barnes, for he layd on ſcriptures wryten &amp; vnwryten, englyſhed and vnenglyſhed as thicke as hayle, and vnderſtode not one word what he ſayd, euen the very doctours paynted of Paule to haue erred frome the true faith and loue, and are ſwaruen vnto vayne lyes, whiche wolde be ſene Doctours of the lawe and yet vnderſtande

they not what they ſaye nor of what thynge they affirme. But to Wyn. concluſion, Thou knoweſte good reader, that in ſcripture there is mencioned a dead fayth and a fayned or falſe fayth. And alſo there is a rightwyſenes of the law or our rightwiſenes and alſo a lyke iuſtification, one of faith before god, and an other of workes before men. When Paule had myghtelye proued onely fayth to haue iuſtified before God, the Iewe not beyng content with this concluſion obiected ſayeng. What then ſhall we ſaye of our father Abraham? Gote he no iuſtification by his workes? he was a good father and dyd many goodes dedes. It is trweth ſaith Paule, but yet hath he not to reioyce therof before god, but onely before men. Nowe let vs ſet vp my Lorde Gardiner in his Veluets and Satyn alofte vpon his mule trapped with veluet with gilden ſterups and bridle. &amp;c. with his ientle men bare head chayned with golde, before and after hym. Who wyll not ſaye but there rideth a pryncely prelate a gloriouſe Byſhop to orne and honor an hole realme? See what a clenly ſorte of tall men he hath aboute hym, what coſtely liueries geueth he, what a many of idle belies dayly fedeth he. Hath not Winch. lo, wherof to glorye before

men? is not this a ioylye iuſtification? Nowe foloweth his concluſion of him ſelfe ſayenge, ergo by the gyfte of god, that is by theſe worldely gyftes I may do well before worldlye men of fleſhely iudgement before I be iuſtified before God, yet iuſtified gloriouſly (in which I reioyce) before men. This is his Iewyſſhe iuſtification wherof the Phariſaies ſo highly reioyced, in ſo muche that Chriſt tolde them that he came not to call ſuche iuſte men, but ſynners to repentaunce, warnynge the people that excepte theyr rightwyſnes abounded aboue the Phariſais good dedes, they ſhulde neuer come to heuen. And Paule ſayth that men ignorant of the ryghtwiſnes or rightwiſe makynge of god, and ſekynge to ſet faſt (as nowe dothe Wyncheſter) their owne rigthwiſenes, they be neuer ſubiect to ye rightwiſnes of god. Wyncheſter yet knoweth not the office of the lawe, to ſhewe vs our ſynnes, to worke wrath, to make ſynne the more to abound as Paul proueth it to the Romayns, ſo farre of muſt it be to iuſtify. Neither yet knoweth he thoffice &amp; proper place of faith nor yet what thynge fayth is, but conceyueth a certayne fantaſticall opinion therof as doth euery ſpeculatyue phariſay and idle hypocrite. And a man ſhulde ſpeke

after the very order of nature and of the tyme, he muſte nedes ſette faith before workes, as is the tree before it blometh and the blomes before the fruyte. The ſead is caſt into the erth before it groweth and fructifieth. The ſeade is the worde of god ſaith Chriſte. And nyghe vnto the is the worde of fayth euen in thyne herte and mouth. Fayth is effectuouſe and worketh by loue. And the ende of the precept is loue out of a pure harte (by fayth hartes are made pure ſayeth Peter) and a good conſcience and of faith vnfayned. I thinke Winc. is not ſo ignoraunte in his Gramer as to englyſſhe this texte of Paule. Fides que operatur per dilectionem, as dydde Iohn fyſher the byſhoppe of Rocheſter in hys ſermon at Paules croſſe and afterwarde prynted, thus englyſſhed, fayth which is wrought by charitie: ſo ſettynge the carte before the horſe and lyke an vngodlye gardener to peruerte and turne the rotes of his plantes and herbes vpwarde, of whyche I harde as it were an olde prophecye .xl. yeres agoo that ſuch an Antechriſt ſhuld come to peruerte the iuſtificacion of faythe and turne Chryſtes relygyon vpſedowne. I am ſewre he wyll not ſette workes before fayth, no not in the yong baptyzed infantes, nor yet in Paule at

his conuerſion, nor in the thefe hanging by Chryſte crucified. It is truth that workes being the frutes of fayth ſtandynge in theyr owne place procedynge oute of fayth iuſtyfyenge dymynyſſhe not the effecte of Chryſtes paſſyon. For we are made in Chryſte Ieſu to do the good workes whyche God hath prepared that we ſhoulde walke in them. We are ſaued frelye by faythe ſayeth Paule, yea and that not of workes, for it is the gyfte of god, that we be ſaued by fayth, and not for oure workes leſte anye man ſhoulde reioyce in his owne dedes. But yf Wynch. put his workes in the place and office of fayth, as the condicion withoute the whyche no man is iuſtyfyed, ſo dymynyſſheth he, yea he is iniuriouſe and blaſphemous vnto the effecte of Chryſtes paſſyon, for by this doctryne his diminute imperfecte and wycked workes ſhulde deſerue vs forgeuenes of ſynnes as though Chryſtes bloude and ſo plentuouſe a redempcyon in Chryſte were not ſuffycyente. If by the lawe ſayeth Paule men be made ryghtwyſe, ſo is Chryſte deade in vayne. Loue muſt fulfyll the condycyon (ſayth he) ergo the workes of the lawe are his condicion. Roma. 13. Now let vs ſee what loue god aſketh of vs, for yf we haue not that loue, we ſhall

neuer fulfyll Wynch. condicion. God commaundeth vs to loue him with our hole hartes, myndes, ſoules, and wyth all our ſtrengthe, and oure neyghbours, ye and oure ennemyes to, as our ſelues, ye and that euen as Chriſte loued vs, whiche dyed for vs beynge his ennemyes. He byddeth vs to be perfyte and holy as hym ſelfe is, not to be ſo angry with oure brother as to prouoke hym with any euyll worde to anger, nor to deſyre anye other mans good, ſeruaunt, wyfe. &amp;c. no not to loue oure owne lyues in his cauſe, but to hate our fleſſhe and dye for his ſake. Nowe tell me Wyncheſter yf anye one man hath this loue, and ſo fulfylled your condicion? or els dare your ſelfe affyrme to haue fulfylled it? yf ye haue not, ergo by youre owne wordes ye ſhall neuer enioye the effect of Chriſtes paſſion (and yet ſpeke I not of the perfytte fayth and hope yt euery man, in God is bounde to haue) beware therfore Wyn. howe ye ſet your ſaluacyon vppon ſo harde a condicion, leſte ye come to ſhorte of the gates ſhuttynge with your .v. folyſh virgens. If you hadde once fulfylled (as you neuer ſhal your condicion, and ſo perſeuering, you nede not to praye. Father forgeue me my dettes, nor neuer to ſay your Pater noſter. For ye owe no loue neyther

vnto God nor man, ye haue payed all. And yet ſayth Paule, owe ye nothynge to any man but mutuall loue, ſhewynge loue to be a dette euer in payenge and neuer full payed. We ſhall aunſwer for euery ydle worde ſayth Chriſte. But yf Wyncheſter had accomplyſſhed his cō
                  dicion, ſo myght he go playe and iuſtle in iudgement with Chriſt for his ſaluacion, hauynge no nede of Chriſtes paſſion, then myghte he clayme heauen of dewtye and make grace no grace, whiche is a mere free gyfte vndeſerued of any man and thus were he one of thoſe iuſte prelates whome Chryſte ſayde he came not to cal. Is not he a proud foole to whome when god geueth a free iuſtification in chriſt, yet wyll he refuſe to take it but vpon a condicion, that he deſerue it with ſuche workes as hym ſelf is neuer able to perfourme? what arrogant foole wolde thus condicion hym ſelfe agenſte gods wyll? Peter conſideringe this importable condicion ſayde, by faith god purifieth theyr hertes, and wherefore then do ye nowe tempte god ſo much layenge ſuch a yoke vpon mens necks which nether our fathers nor we be able to bere? By the grace of our lord Ieſu chriſt we beleue vs to be ſaued as were our fathers. If we ſhuld ſaye that we haue no ſynne in vs, ſo are

we lyers. Wherfore the ſcriptures conclude euery man to be a ſynner and infidele, that of all men God moughte haue mercy. And that the promyſe oute of fayth in Ieſu chriſte ſhoulde be geuen to the beleuers. Only Chriſt fulfylled the lawe. And yf Wyncheſter wolde mok out Paule, ſayenge that when he concluded ſo ofte man to be frely iuſtified by fayth onelye without the workes of the lawe: that he mente by the workes of the lawe but cyrcumcyſyon and the other ceremonies nowe abrogated, and not the lawe of the commaundementes. Then let him heare Paule expownynge hym ſelfe of what lawe he mente aunſwerynge to ſuche obiections. By the lawe ſayth he, cometh the knowledge of ſynne, and I hadde not knowen concupyſcence to haue ben ſynne hadde not the lawe ſayde: Thou ſhalt not haue any concupiſcens or luſt. And then when he wrote his pyſ
                     •
                  les, circumciſion and the rytes and ceremonyes were abrogated amonge the chriſten Iewes, and the Gentyles neuer were bounde to them as was Abraham iuſtyfyed by fayth onelye ere the lawe was wrytten and before he was cyrcumcyſed. And Peter ſayd that this ſame lawe whyche Paule excludethe from iuſtificacion and Wynch. calleth

his condiciō, is a yoke importable whiche proueth it not to be circumcyſion nor anye of their ceremonyes of Moſes lawe, for theſe were lyght enoughe to beare, lyghter and eaſyer then to not luſte or deſyre any thynge agaynſt goddes wyll or for a ryche man to forſake all and gyue it to the pore, or for Wyncheſter to caſte of his pride his biſſhopryke with all his vaynglorye and to become the humble poore pure perſecuted preacher of goddes worde. It is redde that therewas one man that by ſuffring doynge and fulfyllynge the lawe of the commaundementes came to heuen, euen chriſte onelye, In Math. we reade of a nother yonge man that wolde go to heuen by doynge ſome good workes, aſkynge Chryſte, Good Mayſter what dedes ſhall I do to haue lyfe eternall? whoſe mynde Chryſte ſeynge, dydde ſet hym but certayne of the eaſyeſte commaundementes to fulfyll them. And he ſayde, as for theſe I haue done them alredye, wel then ſayd chryſt, or rather ſo thought, If ye wyll nedes go to heauen by doyng: I ſhall ſet you to do ſuch dedes as I knowe well ye wyll neuer do, yea they be impoſſible for you to do thē, euen to ſell his ſubſtance and to geue it to ye poore and ſo to folow hym now goyng forth to Ieruſalem to ſuffer death.

What dydde this man I praye you? howe farre went he with Chriſt thinke you? went he not his waye heuyly from chriſt? And yet wyll Wyncheſter go to heauen by doynge and fulfyllynge his harde condicion, I dare ſaye he wolde ſkratche his head twiſe (as dydde this ryche man) ere he ſolde his byſſhoprike and hadde gyuen it to the poore. And therefore chriſte pronounced that it is impoſſible for ſuch riche men to come to heauen. God therfore truſted vs ſo litle with the fulfyllynge of the lawe and ſo by this condicion to come to heauen, that he toke it out of our handes &amp; layd it vppon his ſonne chriſtes backe to be fulfilled. For yf he had left our ſaluacion in our owne handes to be deſerued by our workes we had ben al dampned.

                Your hādeling of this my concluſion, declareth plain yt ye vnderſtād not what ye ſay, nor of what thing ye affirme, and that I leaue to ye iudgement of ye reader, with remēbraūce of that I haue before written. For ye fondely improue a concluſion which myght ſtand &amp; be true, wt your fonde paradox

of only fayth iuſtifieth, onleſſe in teaching ye wyl ſo handel the matter as Barnes did, that a mā is iuſtified before he beleueth. For and if beleue go before iuſtification, as a cauſe doth theffecte, then ſeing in ſcripture, belefe is called a dede, and proceding from the gift of god, muſt nedes be a good dede, it foloweth neceſſarily. Ergo I may by gods gift, do a good deede before I am iuſtified. But I moued Barnes, of a deede before belefe, that is that lerning to beleue by hearing ſermons or reading, wherin the grace of god prepareth mans wyll as ſcripture ſayth, (So truly do you ſaye whē ye cal me pelagian) I aſked Barnes of that deede whether it were good or no? and proued it good. And then bicauſe it is done before iuſtification, I brought the concluſion aforeſayde, wherof ye take

occaſion to be ioyful in the mery moneth of May. All which your ieſtinges I can ſo wel digeſt, as I am not aſhamed to cauſe thē to be reherſed in this boke, bicauſe the buddes of your fruteful lerning may appeare, to conſidre what frute we may loke for of thē. As for the matter of iuſtificatiō by faith and workes, was not ment betwene Barnes and me, to be ſpoken of in this concluſion, and ſo therin ye ſtriue not wt me but wt your ſelf, &amp; beat your owne ſhadow in ſtead of an aduerſary. Where ye thinke I am not ſo ignoraūt in my grāmer as to englyſhe the text of ſaynt Paule. Fides que per dilectionem operatur.

God iuſtifieth no man without the gyftes of fayth and loue, this ye graunt, whiche when man receyueth, he receiueth by thē iuſtification, wherin I call mans deſerte and merite onely the vſing of the benefites offred of faith and loue. And other deſerte and merite

man can not haue. For what hath any man good that he hath not receyued. And therefore the commaundemente of loue with oure hole hartes. &amp;c. is not ſo extreme as ye make it to a chriſten man, whoſe faythe ſpeakethe to God boldely. Da quod iubes, as ſaynt Auſten ſayth: Gyue that thou cō
               maundeſte, by reaſon whereof the yoke of the lawe, impoſſible to be borne, is in chriſte eaſye throughe the gyfte of God, by Chriſte, in whome we maye do all. Neyther loue ne fayth, can be in man perfit and they nede both continuall encreace, but he that knoweth oure infyrmities, taketh in good parte oure imperfection for oure ſauyoure Chryſtes ſake, vpon whome our ſaluacion is grounded, &amp; neyther vpon workes, ne fayth,workes ſtriue not with faith, as Ioye and his, ſuppoſe with youre diuiſion wherof, ye deceaue the ſimple people, as though workes

required of a chriſten man; wherein to vſe the gyftes purchaſed for man by chriſt▪ were at contention and ſtryfe with fayth, lyke the workes of Moiſes lawe. And herein ye moch pleaſe your ſelf, and thinke other groſſe, that be ſo madde to grounde their ſaluacion vpon workes, beinge impoſſible, and leaue the ſaluacion by fayth, whiche is ſure and certeyne. And ſome talke of fayth, wherewith to apprehende goddes mercy, as though fayth had hādes to take and holde faſt, and loue none, and they graunt that no man is iuſtified without charitie, but yet properlye they ſay faith apprehendeth the iuſtificacion, wherof how properly they ſpeake, I ſhall ſpeake hereafter at large. Nowe I wyll a litle note your fondenes mayſter Ioy, ſo to dally in ſo great a matter▪ ye aſke me,

whether I haue fulfylled the condicion of the iuſtification, and yet ye can not tell what condycyon Barnes and I ſpake of, and ſo ye aſke ye wote not what, and come in wt a free iuſtificatiō, as though I deuiſed our iuſtification to be bonde. Theſe be mere franſies. I euer affirmed that we be frelye iuſtified, and frely ſaued, &amp; yet god in giuinge vs this fredome, for chriſte, worketh ſo in ordre, and ſo wylleth vs to obſerue it, which I call the condycyon, as for wante thereof we ſhal eyther not atteyne fredome, or looſe oure fredom, whē we haue atteyned it. For ones made free frome ſynne, we muſte walke in the pathe of iuſtice, and lyue in this worlde ſoberly, iuſtly and godly, and alſo to atteine this fredome, do as god hath ordayned in vſynge hys ſacramentes worthelye, with conuerſyon alſo of

               Nowe declareth he by his well doynge for the attaynement of his iuſtification to be iuſtified by workes. Here is his condicion declared to be workes. Here he ſheweth hym ſelfe to be arrogantlye bolder then Dauyd or iuſt Iob, whiche both feared their workes and deſyred god not to entre into iudgement with them, for then ſhoulde there no man be iuſtified in his ſight, and again ſayeth Dauyd, Lorde yf thou ſhouldes obſerue oure inyquytyes, who ſhall ſtande before the in iudgemente vncondempned? But Wynch. may do well in the moneth of May, before men, ere he be iuſtified before god, and ſo reioyſe of his owne ioyly iuſtificacion ridinge vpon his horſe or mule. He wolde fayne here wrap in his workes with his faith both together into one bedde to warme and win his iuſtificatiō, that he myght be ſure by both together (for the mo the better) to be iuſtified. Sed pallium ambos

operire non poteſt (ſayth Iſai) but the couerlet is to narowe and to ſhorte to couer them both, one of thē therefore is lyke to lye bare ars and a colde. For god to whome we be maried by faythe and mercye is a ielouſe god, and wyll not that any of his ſpouſes ſhulde lye with a nother to diuide their fayth frō hym to workes to be iuſtified by them, nor to ſeparate forgyuenes of ſynnes from his bloud. Is Chriſt deuided? And therefore if this iuſticiarye by his may well doynge, before he be iuſtified, towarde thattaynement therof ſo procede towarde his entent, he maye be (as the fryers and monkes were wont to ſaye) in via perdicionis, perfectionis I wold ſay, but vnto the very iuſtification ſhal he neuer come, euen men of a corrupte mynde caried awaye of diuers luſtes, euer lernynge and neuer commen vnto the knoweledge of the truth: for ſuche deceyuers ſhall goo forthe worſe and worſe, tyll theyr wyckednes be rype, leadynge other into errours, theyr ſelues beynge blynde and farre oute of the waye, turned vnto vayne ſpeache and falſe doctrine, wyllynge to be ſeene doctours and yet vnderſtonde they not what they ſaye nor of what thynges they make actes, artycles, and inſtitutyons.

For as ye care not what ſenſe ye make of ſcripture, ſo it lyketh you, no more care ye what ye report of any mans writinges or ſayenges, ſo it lyke you, whereby ye declare throughly your generation. Whē I hadde proued to Barnes, that it was vnaduiſedly ſayde of hym, that man myghte not do well by goddes grace, before iuſtification. I dydde fyrſt improue that fonde ſayenge, whereby he confounded the ordre of iuſtification. And whē I had declared that (as I haue before touched) then I tolde him howe it foloweth alſo, that by the gyfte of God man myght do good

towardes the atteynment of iuſtification. And nowe ye ſaye I declare how man is iuſtified by workes, and thervpon ye dally, howe fayth and workes can not lye in one bedde, and one couerlet can not couer them both, and Chriſt is not deuided. Wherevnto herken a lyttle, here howe wyſely ye ſpeake, In youre iuſtification by onelye fayth, this I aſke, who beleueth, god, or man? I thynke ye wyl ſay man by goddes gift. And ſo God gyueth the gyfte of faythe, and man receyueth it, do not here concurre in two workes, god and mā? whiche lye both in one bedde? and be couered with one couerlet? to thaccomplyſhment of iuſtificatiō? And is god ſo ielouſe then, that he wyl not haue it ſpoken when he worketh, and man alſo worketh wt him by his gift &amp; help? Be not we called in ſcrypture cooperatores

dei? Dyd not one couerlet couer god &amp; Gedeō (if we ſhall ſpeake in your allegory) &amp; was not Gedeon taught to ioyne him ſelfe to god &amp; to teach his ſoudiers, ſo to crye in the diſtruction of ye Madianites? the ſword of god &amp; of Gedeon? and Domino et Gedeoni? After which ſort, knowlegyng that god vſeth the mēbres of his church, in ye miniſtery of his workes wt mutuall prayer, one to helpe an other, we ſay god &amp; our lady help vs, wherin god giueth the helpe &amp; our Lady prayeth for it, whiche is a helpe to obtayn helpe, &amp; ſo in the honour of god &amp; our lady: God giueth not his glory from him. Therin he is ielouſe, but god doth cōmunicate his glory in glorifieng of his ſaintes which then redoūdeth to him. And yt we may acknowlege in our ſpeach. And we englyſhe men to whome god hath giuen many victories

vnder the banner of ſaynte George, may not we as well ſaye: God &amp; ſaint George, as they ſayd vnder Gedeon Domino et Gedeoni? Goddes honour is nothynge diminiſhed, by addicion of his ſeruaunt to waite vpō him, &amp; for our teaching therin. Gedeō was learned to ſay, Gladius domini et Gedeonis. And in this cōmon ſpeach, whē men ſay, I thanke god &amp; the king. Trow ye god is angry wt the ſpeach, as though it were to homely to ioyne ye kyng wt god? or hath god the leſſe thanke that ye kynge is ioyned in thākes wt him? where in dede the kyng hath no thanke, but by god, and for god, and god is thāked as author, and the king as gods ſeruaūt. And in this ſence the ſpeache was conceyued. Mary amonge ye rude people, by myſvnderſtāding there hath growē ſuperſticiō, which is a fault annexed to

ye multitude, to do either to much, or to lytle, &amp; the reformaciō therin hath ben expedient, but the yonge boye that in thentrie to lerne his letters, was taught to ſaye, Chriſtes croſſe, me ſpede and ſaynt Nicholas, was for ſo muche taught, no errour at all, but ſaynt Nicholas wel named, as one by chriſtes croſſe auaūced here, to lerning &amp; vertue, and nowe by power of the ſame croſſe, placed in felicite, wher he may praye for other, to be holpen as he was, And god helpeth by giuinge of helpe, and ſaynt Nicholas helpeth by prayenge for the ſame helpe, In confeſſion whereof, we ſet forth the honour of god, and magnifie it, euen as god wolde haue it magnified, who ſo hath exalted his miniſters as to be one with him, not by diuiſion, as ye peruerſly terme it, not as checkemate, as ye odiouſly name

it, but as beinge participate and enioyinge his glory and his honoure which is not leſſed thereby or diminiſſhed, but amonges vs, more ſet fourth and ſpred abrode. And therefore churches and aulters, be named with ſayntes names, not that any ſaynte, is author of any churche, for god is onely author, ne there can be anye ſacrifice, and ſo none aulter, but to god onely, and yet for memorie of thoſe ſaintes, in whom god is honoured we haue done &amp; maye dedicate churches and aulters, in the honour of God and this or that ſaint, wherein the ſaint is remembred, as an honorable ſeruaunte. And ſo when we ſaye, In the honour of god &amp; ſaint George. God is named as author of all honoure, and ſaint George as called to the participation of that honour, by god, accordynge to the

wordes of Chriſt, If any man honour me, my father ſhall honoure him▪ in heauen, wherein god ſpendeth not his honour and hath the leſſe him ſelfe, as they wolde perſuade, that wold not haue ſaintes named with god in honoure, for ſparyng of gods honour, but god ſo ſpredeth his honour abrode, and is thereby magnified amonge vs▪ The catholique doctrine teacheth god holly wt his ſeruaūtes, Chriſt, hollye with his preceptes. You be the onely deuyders of Chriſt, who can not abide the teachyng of hole Chriſte, whiche conſiſteth in the due receyuing the benefites of his paſſion and folowynge hys example. This haulfe of Chriſte, ye talke of, that he hath ſuffered for our ſynne, payde oure raunſome, ſatyſfyed for vs, but the other haulfe, that Chriſte ſuffered for our example, to worke after him,

Ye ſaye alſo ye loue Chriſte, but ye deuyde hym from his ſeruauntes, his ſayntes departed, vnder a wronge pretence of the preſeruation of his hole honour. Chriſte him ſelfe, ye call life, but ye cal his ſeruauntes the ſaintes departed, deade men, and for ſpite cutte of their eares, and ſaye they can not heare, bicauſe they want their bodies. Thus do you deuyde chriſt, and make ſtrife betwene his gyftes alſo, with youre only faith, where with to put charitie out of office in iuſtification. And ye be verelye they of whome the text of ſaynt Paule to Timo. may be verified which ye bring in agaynſt me.

But to this purpoſe, this ſpeache ſerued, we ſpake of turnyng to god, wherin I ſayd, that as god gaue man, by fayth, knoweledge to come to hym: So he gaue charitie to loue him. So as whē god calleth man, to hym, there, in the turnynge of man, and goynge to god, god addeth to fayth, loue, accordynge as ſaynt Auſten ſayth. Credere in deum eſt amando in eum ire. To beleue in god, is by louynge to goo vnto hym. And therefore ye ſhall not take that aduauntage of my (there) which worde (there) placed as it was then ſpoken to Barnes, had an other ſignification ſpecial, then ye by allowynge of it wolde haue it ſignify.

To thattaynment of iuſtificacion, is required fayth and charitie.
            
            
               
                  Ioye. 
               
               Fayth onelye (ſayeth Chriſte and Paule) is requyred to thattaynemente of the iuſtificacion whiche is of God, nether is charitie excluded from fayth, but from the efficacye effecte and office to iuſtifie. For to this effecte and offyce is fayth alone ſufficient effectuouſly. As from fyer or from the ſonne we exclude not heate nor bryghtnes, but yet haue heate and brightnes their ſondrye effectes and offices, for the heat warmeth and with his brightneſſe the ſonne ſhyneth and gyueth lyghte. Charitie hath many fayer effectes and, offyces attributed onely vnto her ſelfe as proper, and is hyghlye commended for them, as is faythe extolled of Paule for her offyces in the Hebrewes. And I dare ſaye charytye is contente with her owne workes, called benygne pacyente. &amp;c. ſo that ſhe deſyreth not to put

her elder ſyſter faythe oute of her cheif offyce nor yet to vſurpe any parte therof, whoſe offyce pryncipall is alone to iuſtifie, but and yf Wyncheſter wyl defraude faythe of her effecte and imparte it vnto charytye, he ſhall offende both charitie and fayth. This is certayne that yf charite had had any ſuch an excellente effecte and offyce as to iuſtifie, Paule wold not haue omytted it, but wolde haue geuen her the glorye thereof ſettynge it forthe before al ſayenge. Charitie iuſtifieth, charitie is benygne, pacyente, &amp;c. I wolde Wyncheſter wolde ones ſhewe vs where he fyndeth this texte in ſcripture. Charite iuſtyfyeth. It is wrytten in many places fayth iuſtifieth, by faythe god teſtifyed our fathers to be iuſtified, yea and that wythoute the workes of the lawe. Frelye doubteles are men iuſtified by grace (ſayth Paule) throughe the raunſome and redemption made by the anoynted ſauyoure whom god the father hathe ſet forth to be the free mercifull gyfte or ſeat of mercy therevpon to be appeaſed through faith in his bloud ſet forth (I ſaye) to declare hym ſelfe faythfull and true of hys promyſſe concernynge the forgeuenes of ſynnes hytherto commytted and paſte, whiche ſynnes God the father had not anon puniſſhed

but paciently ſuffred them to declare his longe ſuffringe and hym ſelfe to be true of his promiſe at this preſent time when hym ſelfe wolde be knowen and declared faythfull and iuſte in that he iuſtifieth who ſoeuer beleueth and lyueth in Ieſu by faithe. Where is then thy gloriouſe boſtynge oh Wyncheſter? It is playnlye excluded and ſhut out of dores. By what reaſon? by the reaſon of vertue &amp; workes? No no, but by the reaſon of faith, we conclude therfore (ſaith Paule) that by faith a man is iuſtified wtout the workes of the law. Lo here is all gloriaciō of workes blowen downe, layde flat in the duſt by reaſon and power of fayth: for as fayth humbleth &amp; geueth all glorye to god, ſo do workes puffe vp man and aſcribe glorye vnto men. If the effecte of Chriſtes paſſyon ſhulde depende of the condicion of oure workes, we ſhuld neuer be ſure and certayne of our iuſtificacion, for all oure workes are vnperfytte and fowle as the ſycke womans clothes. Paule hym ſelfe dydde his office ſo truely that his conſcience coulde not accuſe hym of anye faut, and yet he ſayde, Non tamen in hoc iuſtificatus ſum, yet for ſo doynge am I not iuſtified.

                I Sayd to thattaynement of iuſtificaciō, is required fayth &amp; charite. You ſaye yt Chriſte and ſaynt Paule ſayth fayth onelye, and yet ye ſayde euen nowe, &amp; ſo ye ſay a lytle after, yt charitie is ioyned, with the fayth ye ſpeake of, and you your ſelf, take fayth and charitie for twoo ſiſters, but ye make fayth thelder ſiſter, and affirme, yt in iuſtificacion, charitie that ye cal the yonger ſiſter, is not excluded. Theſe be your wordes, wherin ye ſaye, the ſame I ſay, as a playne ſymple man wold wene, ſuch as ye take vpon you, to teach in englyſhe. For I ſay both the ſyſters (as ye call them) be there, &amp; ye ſay they be there alſo. Where is the variaunce then, betwene you and me? Forſoth in two poyntes. One is that ye ſaye, faythe and charitie, be both in iuſtification, and yet ye ſay, Saint Paule

and Chriſt, ſay, fayth onely, wherby ye declare your ſelfe, how much ye regarde their ſayenges, and that what ſoeuer they ſay, ye dare (if it lyke you) ſaye the contrarye. Now for my part I ſay, fayth and charite be both in iuſtificacion, becauſe Chriſt and ſaynt Paule ſay the ſame. An other varyaunce betwene you and me is, ye ſaye, albeit both ſyſters, faythe and charytye, be in iuſtyfycation, yet charytye, the yonger ſyſter (as ye terme it) ſtandeth ſtyll ydle, and onelye waiteth vpō her elder ſiſter, faith, whiche faith ye ſay, is only in efficacie, effecte and office in iuſtificacion, but not onely in company, for fayth (ye ſaye) is accompanyed wyth charitie in iuſtificacion, and yet fayth as the elder ſyſter worketh al. I ſay they be both not only in company in iuſtificacion, but alſo in office, &amp; efficacy, ſo as al the

cōtrouerſie, in iuſtificaciō, is come now to this fyne, ſubtyl, narowe iſſue whether charite in iuſtificatiō, worketh or is ydle?The iſſue of the cōtrouerſy in iuſtifica

                And is not (trowe you) the diſcuſſion of this poynt, a worthye matter, wherewt to trauel the ſimple vnexerciſed wyttes of the worlde. And ſurelye, al the diſputacyon, in this artycle of iuſtificacion, is deduced by diſcuſſion thus farre, that for all the only &amp; onely, with ſo many onlyes which they haue added to faythe, to make ye ſpeach litigiouſe, there now is none foūde amonge lerned men, but that ſaye (as ye mayſter Ioye ſay) that charite is not excluded from faith in iuſtificacion, but that there is in the iuſtificacion of man, fayth and charitie. But the newe ſecte (whiche ye profeſſe) to mayntayne the aduerbe (onelye) ſaye the offyce of fayth is onely to iuſtifie, and yet charitie is preſent,

but is not effectuouſe therein. So as fayth and charitie beynge two giftes of God gyuen both together, the one (yt is to ſaye) fayth, worketh iuſtification onelye, as ye ſaye, and that other, charitie for the tyme ſtandeth ydle, tyll iuſtificatiō be paſt. And to induce men, to ſe this euen aſwell as you do your ſelfe, ye vſe a ſimilitude of the ſonne and fyre, which manner of teaching Chriſt vſed muche by thynges corporall and viſible, to make ſome explication of thynges inuiſible and incorporall, and ſo to induce men to the vnderſtandyng of them, whiche for my part I much allowe, and onelye fynde this faulte in ſome of your ſorte, that albeit in you,Similitudes be neceſſarye to plaine teachynge. they allowe and approue ſimilitudes, for corroboracion of your doctrine, yet when your doctrine ſhuld be impugned, they can not abyde ſimilitudes,

but they ſay ſtreight as they here of them, fye on them: Blynde not me (ſayth he) by ſimilitudes but comme to the playne matter, and yet ſomtyme ye matter is ſo darke, as it can not be perceiued without the ſpectacles of a ſimilitude, or parable, and anon the ſimilitude well conſidered, the matter that was darke, is ſene by and by. For a ſimilitude, is as it were a ſpeach of the wordes &amp; thinge togither for bothe ye thing reſembled, and the wordes alſo ſpeaketh at ones. But nowe to your ſimilitude, whereby ye entende to make men perceyue, howe it might be, that two thinges conioyned together, may haue dyuerſe effectes, and ſo eche one of them, to worke his effecte apart, without confuſiō. For ſo ye ſay, doth fayth and charitie. The ſonne and fyre ye ſaye, haue eche one of them heate &amp; brightnes,

and the heate warmethe and the brightnes ſhyneth. So as by this ſimilitude, we maye vnderſtande, that from god, whome ye ſignifie by the ſonne or fyre, is gyuen to man before he be iuſtified, two vertues, fayth and charitie, whereof fayth ſhyneth, and charitie warmeth. And in dede the effect of fayth, is properly, to illuminate the vnderſtanding, and of charitie to warme and kyndle mans colde and earthly affection. Nowe if the iuſtification of man implied onely the expulſion of darkenes, frome mannes vnderſtanding, theffecte of fayth, wolde ſuffice, but ſeinge god in iuſtificaciō, moueth mans hart, and kindleth loue in it, whye may not theſe two vertues, with their two effectes, by goddes workyng, concurre in mans iuſtification? your ſimilitude letteth it not, but rather confirmeth it. As for

ſaynt Paul declareth plainly, that albeit he ſpeaketh ſometyme of faith without mencion of charite, yet he meaneth not faith as a bare foundacion, but fayth with charitie. And as euery foundacyon corporall, is fyrſt in prioritie of tyme. So is euery foundacion intellectuall, fyrſt in prioritie of nature. And therfore becauſe nomā loueth yt he knoweth not before, fayth yt bringeth knowlege muſt nedes p̄
               cede, and fayth that hath not charitie is dead, ſo as by theſe .ii. vertues god reſuſcitating man in iuſtificacion from the death of ſinne to lyfe,Iuſtificati
                     •
                  
                gyuethe the gyftes of knoweledge and loue (that is to ſaye) faythe and charytye, beinge god onely the officer him ſelfe that iuſtifieth, and to hym ye maye put (onely) and (onely) for he is the iuſtifier and requireth (only) of man (mary that he wyll haue done) to

receyue and vſe theſe vertues, as he giueth them. And this is the plain teaching, and agreable with ſcriptures, whiche muſt be ſo vnderſtanded, as one parte, may be conſonante to the other, withoute ſuche hackynge as ye make of it. God gaue Abraham fayth wherewith to beleue hym, and charitie wherewith to loue him, and Abraham as he beleued god ſo he loued him both together. And if I ſhuld returne to your ſimilitude, when mē ſay, that they ſhuld plant their vines, where the ſonne may ſhyne on them, do they affirme that the brightnes and lyght of the ſonne, giueth the comfort to the vynes? or rather the heat? The ſpeach is of the brightnes, as a parte may ſignifie, the hole, but in the heat is theffect. Ye dalye in the matter, to triumphe ouer me, &amp; take vpō you ye parte of a mediatour, betwene ye
               
two ſiſters faith and charitie, and ye commende charitie, for manye good properties forſothe, but ye ſay the elder ſiſter faith, hath ye iuſtification by ſcripture. Is not this properly handled, in ſo ſerious a matter? But ye requyre ſcripture of me whiles ye daly, &amp; talke your ſelfe, without ſcripture. As for ſcripture this I ſaye to you, that and ye note ſcripture, ye ſhal fynde in the true ſenſe of it, that as the promyſſe of god is knit to fayth, ſo it is knyt to loue, as lyfe is promiſed to men beleuynge, ſo it is promyſed to men louynge. And as often as ſaynt Paule nameth fayth, not ſpeakinge of loue, ſo often and oftener, doth ſaynt Iohn̄ in his epiſtles ſpeake of charytye without mencion of fayth, and declareth plainly, that he that loueth not, is in death, and he that loueth not, knoweth not god. And as

ſaint Paule ſayth to the Hebrues, he that commeth to god muſt beleue. So Chriſt ſaid in the goſpell of ſaynt Ihon̄, No man he ſayth, commeth to me, without my father draweth him, the ſenſe wherof is, but by loue, wherewith ſaynt Auſtine ſaith, god draweth vs accordynge as god by Moiſes ſignified to vs, that he ſheweth his mercye, to them that loue hym. It is true, we can not loue god onles he prepareth our harte, and geue vs that grace, no more can we beleue god, onleſſe he giueth vs the gyfte of belefe. And ſo god is the author of all our welth, and our helper, that we may worke with him, and he is the only iuſtifier,God the on

                   iuſtifier. the only ſauiour and onely mediatour. And as for the ſpeache of (onely faythe iuſtifieth) the ſcripture hath not, &amp; yet hath ben ſpoken by ſome lerned men to exclude the workes of

Moyſes lawe, wherein S. Paule laboured in his epiſtle to the Romaynes, where S. Paule ſpeaketh not of the aduerbe (onelye) nor he hathe not this faſſhyon of ſpeach, faith iuſtifieth, but in this wiſe, we be iuſtified by faith, and attributeth the act of iuſtification to god. And S. Auguſtine ſayth plainly, that for the more playne vnderſtandinge of S. Paule, god inſpired S. Iames to write his epyſtle. And further ſaint Auſten ſaith, that S. Paule ſpeakyng of fayth, dyd euer meane ſuch a faith as had the gift of charite with it, wherof he ſpake, to ye Galathiās. Ne

                     que
                   prepuciū eſt aliquid, ſed fides que per dilectionem operatur. And to the Corrinthians, he that hath not charite is nothing. And therefore as ſcripture teſtifieth yt god maketh his promyſe to thē that beleue in him

ſo it teſtifieth that god maketh his promyſe to them that loue him, as ſaynt Iames writeth. And by the wyſe man god ſayeth, I loue them that loue me. Saynt Iohn̄ affirmeth, he yt loueth not god, knoweth not god, ſo as without I loue I can not frutefully beleue, no not the belefe of knowledge, as ſaynte Ihon̄ declareth whereby appeareth, that the yonger ſiſter charite, for ſo ye ſpeake of her, hath office to helpe her elder ſiſter faith, in iuſtification. But ye nowe preſſe me to ſhewe you ſcrypture, in this forme of ſillables, Charitie iuſtifieth. And yet ye haue no ſcripture ſo framed, for faith, as to ſay, faith iuſtifieth, neuertheleſſe to aūſwere you according to your folyſſhnes, and to ſtoppe your mouth, who begynne to appoſe me, as chyldren were wōt eche one another in their primers, to aſke, where they found

For quicquid predicatur de ſubiecto, predicatur de predicato. And ſo if deus predicatur de iuſtificare, to ſaye, deus iuſtificat, and then charitas predicatur de deo, deus eſt charitas, the ſcripture that ſayth, deus iuſtificat, ſayth alſo charitas iuſtificat. And thus I gyue you wordes for wordes, who deſerue none other. For els I knowe that charitas que de deo predicatur, eſt increata, and ſo differeth, a charitate qua iuſtificamur. Thus for my recreacion, I aunſwer you, as you be worthye, who from ſeriouſe diſcuſſion of the true ſenſe, wyl bring the matter to ſillables, and yet in dede, ye haue no ſuche ſyllables, for fayth, what ſo euer ye ſaye, as

you wolde haue me fynde, to ſerue for charitie: for ſcripture hath neither fides iuſtificat, nor charitas iuſtificat, in ſyllables, but the ſenſe of both is conteined in ſcripture, as before is declared. As for workes of the lawe ſerue you only, for matter to talke on. As for frenes in iuſtification, I affyrme al to be of gyft, and there is nothing freer then gyfte. I ſpeake of no glorye, but only of gods glory in whome we ſhulde glorye as ſaynt Paule teacheth vs. Nowe where ye ſaye, that if the effecte of chriſtes paſſion, ſhoulde depende, of the condiciō of our workes we ſhuld neuer be ſure, and certayne of our iuſtification, for all our workes are vnperfite, and foule. Thus I aūſwer you, that what ſurenes ye wolde haue I can not tell, but of this I am ſure, that god hath thus ordeyned that baptyſme is neceſſary,

to attayne ſaluacion, and yet all chyldren, be not ſure to be baptiſed. And this doth ſcripture tell me aſſuredly, that a mā muſt perſeuer in good doing, to thende, or elles he ſhall not be ſaued, and that he that ſtandeth in vertue, may fal, and be caſt oute. I am aſſured by ſaynt Paules admonition in his epiſtle to the Romaynes byddynge the gentyle, take hede that he fal not. And ſaynt Auſten ſayth, If we continue in goodnes, we may be aſſured of god, that he wyl not fayle, but whether we ſhal continue, no man knoweth. And therfore ſuche aſſuraunce as ye ſpeake of, without regarde of the condicion, and obſeruing of it alſo, I haue not redde. Thus haue I lerned in ſcriptures, yf we turn, when god turneth to vs, If we beleue, when god illuminateth vs. If we loue, as god kyndleth vs.

If we be baptiſed as God commaundeth vs we ſhalbe iuſtified,Conditions required in ſcripture of man for his ſaluacion. If we walke in iuſtification, as god by chriſt hath taught vs, and therein perſeuere, we ſhalbe ſaued and glorified. And I knowe none other englyſhe for ſo many iffes, but to call them condicions, and workes alſo to be done by vs, whiche workes, be vnperfite in vs, that be our ſelfe vnperfite, and as touchinge vnperfitenes, faythe therein differeth not from charite, for they nede both daylye increaſe of perfection, and therefore Iob ſayde. Verebar omnia opera mea, whiche maye comprehende fayth alſo. But al oure imperfitnes, is ſupplied in chriſtes perfitnes, and ſo chriſt ſupplyeth vs, and we ſupply not chriſt, We ſhulde do all as chriſte dyd, for he is our example to folowe, but we can not, for we haue the dregges of ſynne, and be

compaſſed about with infirmities as punyſhmēt for the ſynne of our father Adam. So as the powers of oure ſoule, vpon occaſion of the worlde, and the fleſſh, and ſuggeſtion of the deuell, be ready to rebellion, And herein aſwel ye power of the ſoule, ye properly receyueth fayth, to diffidence, and doubt agaynſt ye certaynte of godly fayth, as alſo the power of the ſoule, that receyueth charitie to contempte or negligence towardes the obſeruation of gods pleaſure, with ſome confuſion in hope alſo, as aduerſities encombre vs, or pleaſures make vs wanton. For althoughe the gylte of oryginall ſynne, be taken awaye in baptyſme, yet the ſcarre of it &amp; (as it were) ye matter of it, doth remayne, whiche as it troubleth, and letteth mans perfection in vertue, and therby is maynteyned a continual ſtrife and

debate, ſo is it not to be accompted our ſynne tyll we conceyue it, by enbracyng &amp; agreynge to ſuch carnall motions. And therefore ſaint Iames ſayeth, that concupiſcence, when it conceyueth, bringeth forth ſynne. And lyke as in euery kinde, the female is commenlye barren, onleſſe it conceyueth of the male: ſo is concupyſcence barren and voyde of ſynne, onleſſe it conceyue of man the agreymente of his free wyll, conſentynge to the euyll motion. And bycauſe no man hath ben ſo perfytte, but hath in the contynuall fyghte yelded, althoughe men myght be by grace, wythoute ſynne, yet bycauſe no man hathe (excepte oure Ladye as ſaynte Auguſtyne ſayeth who is alwayes to be excepted) yf we ſhoulde ſaye we hadde no ſynne, we were lyars, as ſaynte Iohn̄ ſayeth, and therefore after ſaynte

Auſtens mynde, do not onelye for humilite, but alſo for trueth, praye in oure common prayer dayly for remiſſion of our ſynnes, And ſo mayſter Ioye to returne to oure matter, yf ye wolde for policie, flee frō the worke of loue, to the worke of fayth, becauſe ye wolde be aſſured, ye be no more aſſured, in reſpect of your owne worke, by faith, then ye be by charitie, but all oure aſſuraunce, is in goddes promyſe. For, deus uerax, et omnis homo mendax, and therefore howe ſo euer ye and yours wyll Ieſte at it.

of auncientie, to baniſhe in Germany, although it repugneth and diſproueth their teachynge in this matter. Wherefore as the ſūme of our helth beginneth, continueth, &amp; is accomplyſſhed by gods mercy. Quia ne

                   currentis, ſed miſerentis eſt dei: ſo the aſſuraunce of our helth, dependeth vpon goddes promyſe: Mary (ꝙ you) and that is truthe, and here ye wyll clap your handes, and extolle the ſtrength of truth, that breſteth out, although we phariſais (as ye ſaduces call vs) wolde oppreſſe it. The promiſe of god is all, Et ideo, ex fide (ſay you) and theſe wordes ſcrypture hath, ut firma ſit promiſſio.
               A conſideration of the argument, how fayth apprehendeth the promyſe: And nowe ye wyll percaſe bringe in Melanctōs correlatiues whereof ye make mention in the ende of your booke of fayth and of promyſe: And that the cauſe whye we be iuſtified by

faith (ſayth he) &amp; not by charitie, is becauſe promiſe can not be receaued, but by fayth. And in this poynt / they meruayl of ye groſſenes of our wit, that vnderſtande not the nature of correlatiues, and ſe not howe a promiſe, can onely be apprehēded by fayth, and that is the grounde, that moueth them to ſaye, Onely faithe iuſtifieth. And thus they reaſon, Seinge our ſaluatiō dependeth vpō goddes promiſe, &amp; a promiſe can not be apprehended, but by faith onely, we muſt nedes ſaye, only faith iuſtifieth, And to make the matter playne they brynge in a ſimilytude. If one man promiſeth an other .xx.li. howe can he, to whome the promiſe is made, apprehende the promiſe but onely by beleuynge him that promiſeth. And this is the newe ſcoole of Germany, where ſophiſtry is not baniſhed

but hath a newe garmente and is clothed with a pretence of ſimplicitie. For in this teachynge, is a meruelouſe apparaunce of playnnes, and throughlye conſidered, conteynethe a meere deceyte. And note well reader, that thou mayeſt perceyue this iuggelinge ſophiſtrye, where it deceyueth the. It is not denyed, but onely faythe apprehendeth the promyſe, therin is no controuerſy, but marke well this, when god iuſtifieth man, god miniſtreth mercy to vs, which was the thing god promiſed to giue vs (as ye prophet zacharie prophecied god wold giue him ſelf) who is all mercy, whervpon is groūded oure ſaluation, wherin we muſt cōſidre diſtinctly &amp; a parte the promyſe of god, and the thynge by hym promyſed, whiche is mercy. The promiſe is one, ye thinge conteined in ye promiſe is an other. As in their

exāple (for I dare make no newe) when one frēd promiſeth an other.Goddes promyſe of mercy, ſheweth the promyſe to be the bōd
                     •
                   &amp; mercye the thinge promiſed. xx.li. the promiſe is the bonde, the thing promyſed is the .xx.li. In which example, though I graunt, that I apprehend my frendes promiſe, with beleuing him, yet I apprehende not, yt is conteined in my frendes promiſe, wt beleuing him, for I apprehēd that wt my hādes, yf it be payed me. And ſo although we apprehend gods promiſe, with our belefe, yet the exhibicion of the mercy of god, which is the thinge cōprehended in gods promyſe, we apprehend that with all ſuch partes of vs, of bodye and ſoule, as be comforted and healed, by that mercye. And in the workynge of chryſtes myracles, the promyſſe of helthe, in body and ſoule, was receaued by fayth, in the vnderſtandynge lyghtened by God, but the healthe was receaued, in all the

partes healed of body and ſoule. Nowe if he wyll yet wrangle and ſaye, that the promyſe of god, is mercye, and god wyll ſurely fulfil his promyſe. So as he that apprehendeth, the promyſe, apprehendeth alſo mercye. I wyll not vary with him therein to ſaye that the promyſe is for the certaine hope of the thing promiſed, mercy. For as our Ladye ſayde in the ſpirite of prophecy. Suſcepit Iſraell puerum ſuū, recordatus miſericordiae ſuae. God hath taken to him Iſrael, his ſeruaunt, remembryng his mercy, yt is to ſay, according to his mercifull promiſe, which the nexte verſe declareth. Sicut locutus eſt. &amp;c. yet ye ſhall note here a diſtinction in degre of mercye betwene ye mercy in the mercyfull promiſe, when our Lady ſayth recordatus miſeri cordiae ſuae, &amp; the very receyuyng of Iſrael to his ſeruice which god

doth in iuſtification of man, for then he taketh Iſrael the beleuer that ſeeth god to his ſeruaūt, whiche is a further mercy and the very mercy promyſed. So as Iſrael apprehendeth the mercifull promyſe by faith, but beynge taken to ſeruyce, receiueth ye further mercy ꝓmiſed, in receauing a newe hart, a new ſpirit, which god createth in man, wt the gift of charite, &amp; reſuſcitateth in man lyfe, beyng al lyfe and charite hym ſelfe. Wherefore we may not properly ſaye we apprehende iuſtification by faythe, whiche is the exhibition of mercy promyſed by god, to iuſtifie man, onleſſe, we wolde call the promiſe of god, and the exhibition of the thinge promyſed all one. God wyl do aſſuredly, that he promyſeth, &amp; yet his promyſe, &amp; the thynge promyſed be diſtincte, &amp; the promiſe &amp; the exhibitiō of ye promiſe diſtinct,

but aſſuredly knit together, without fayling, for god can not faile, &amp; yet diſſeuered, in conſideration of the ſcripture. And herein is the ſophiſtry, in this newe ſcoole, ſlythly to paſſe ouer and iuggle, as this man ſpeaketh of vnder bord, from the promiſe to the exhibition of the thing promiſed, which their ſleight is not of the rude, eaſelye eſpied, bicauſe in common ſpeach, we vſe ſometime, to ſignify, by the worde (promyſe) the thynge promyſed, and ſo we do, when we ſaye we be ſaued by gods promiſſe meaninge his mercy promyſed, and yet be the promyſſe, and mercy promyſed, diuers in cōſideration of the thinge, as afore. As ſoone as man beleueth, God procedeth to the fulfillynge of his promyſe, for his part, and giueth vs a newe ſpirite, and a newe harte, and ſo iuſtifieth vs, if we receiue it, and aſſente by our

free choice vnto it, and worke with it, which is the effectual receiuyng and the worthynes on our parte, whereby we be iuſtified. And note wel this that there muſt be on our parte a worthynes, and therefore, howe ſo euer ye wyll ſmyle at it,The churc

                  nes. it is a good prayer, Ora pro nobis ſancta dei genitrix, ut digni efficia mur promiſſionibus chriſti. In this prayer we call vpon our Ladye as a lyuely membre of chriſtes miſticall body, to praye to god, for vs and with vs, that we maye be made worthy, ye promiſes of chriſt. In which prayer we acknowledge and truely profeſſe, that the promiſes of god, require in vs a worthynes. For the promyſes of god be not to all men, withoute condition abſolute for then all ſhulde be ſaued, but onelye to ſuche as be worthy, to enioye thē. And of this worthynes the ſcripture ſpeaketh

the thyrde chapiter in the booke of wiſedome,

                  ye her. ſayenge, god hath tēpted them, and founde them worthy him. And Centurio in the goſpell, when he humblye, wold haue auoyded the comminge of Chriſt into his houſe, ſayde. Lorde, I am not worthye, that thou ſhouldeſte entre into my houſe. Nowe if we ſhall ſo preſſe the ſignification of this worde (worthy) as we meane ſomtime when we ſay. Dignus eſt operarius mercede ſua, no man can be founde worthy, the mercy of god, but if we can be content in the vnderſtandynge, to abſteyne from the extremite, and take worthynes for metenes after gods acceptation, then all ſuch, may be accompted worthy as cōforme them ſelfe to goddes pleaſure, and vſe ſuche giftes of god, as whereby god maketh vs worthy, both the gyftes receaued and other more.

So as the ſenſe of the prayer, that we may be made worthy, is that we may be conformable, to the fulfillynge of goddes wyll. And it is to be noted, that we praye that we maye be made worthy (for we can not make oure ſelfe worthye) but muſt receaue all of god, of whome is all worthynes, and of our ſelfe vnworthynes, and yet in the atteining of worthines, we be workers with god, by his grace as before is declared. And thus much I ſpeake hereof how this praier, which many wold depraue is agreable, with the ſenſe of ſcripture, bicauſe it is neceſſary, we be put in remēbraūce that the promiſes of god, require the condition of worthines on our behalfe, wherein is required oure endeuour. Ye bringe in at the laſt a text of ſaint Paule, lyke a keye to cleue a logge. For ſaint Paules ſpeakynge in that place, nothinge

perteyneth to the iuſtification we ſpeake of, as ye know wel ynough but only vſe it becauſe ye delite in copy. Then foloweth that ye call my .viii. article.

                YE reherce mine article right, tyl ye come to the latter word where in ſteade of the worde

(compulſion) ye put in the worde (prouocation) I wolde neuer haue gyuen Barnes and his ſcolefelow ſuch a cauſe of prouocatiō to haue ieſted of me,Howe Ioye here prouoketh me to call hym by his name. as to ſay as ye reherſe For not onely vice, beſides the inſtigation of the deuyl, hath a material cauſe of prouocatiō to vice, but alſo vertue, beſydes the callynge of God, hathe a materyal cauſe of prouocation to vertue. In prouocation of vertue and vice this differethe, that a man maye playe the deuylles parte, and tempte hym ſelfe, and ſo exercyſe the materiall cauſe of vice, but man can not playe goddes parte, and of hym ſelfe put in worke, the materiall cauſe of vertue, vertuouſly, for al goodnes cō
               meth frō aboue. But wt Barnes it came in by ye way, to ſpeake of mās fre working, either in ſinne or vertue, or any other action indifferēt.

This maxime, I tolde him that euery thinge is to be eſtemed of the begynnyng. For if the begynnyng hath no compulſion, the acte is to be called free, yf the begynnynge hath force and compulſion, al that foloweth hath the nature of neceſſitie. We diſcuſſed this in many ſpecialties, and amongeſte other, in ye ſtate of preiſtes, whether they that lyued vnmaryed, ſuche as wold nowe marrye, I meane ſuche as thoſe be, whether they maye, complayne of wante of fredome, to vſe ye world at libertye, as god hath permitted? And herein bicauſe the beginninge of that ſtate of preiſthode, hath no cauſe of compulſiō, for no man is compelled to be a preiſte, and yet there be many cauſes of prouocation, ſo as eche man hath ones in his lyfe lybertie and choice whether he wyll entre the ſtate of preiſthode or no.

After anye man hath entred that ſtate, yf he lyketh it not, he maye well lament his owne folye in the choyſe of it, but he hath no cauſe to complayne of the ſtate, wherevnto he was neuer compelled, but myght haue choſen whether he wolde haue entred it or no. And therefore to euerye man that murmurethe at ye preſente condition of his lyfe, it is obiected in common reaſon thus. Ye might haue choſen. Wherevnto yf any man could truelye replye, and ſaye I coulde not chooſe, euerye man lamenteth the ſtate of hym, that ſayeth and declareth, he coulde not chooſe, and condempneth the complaynte of hym, that myght haue choſen. So as theſe two commē ſpeaches, I could not choſe, and might haue choſen, be worthelye allowed amonge vs, whereby to excuſe or blame all oure doynges, To our

frende that is offended with oure doinge, we ſay I praye you blame me not, for in good fayth I coulde not choſe. If you coulde not choſe (ſayeth the frende) I am not ſo fonde, to fall out with you, I wyll neuer blame a man (ſaieth he) for that he coulde not choſe. Nowe on the other parte, he that leueth his occupation, to be a ſeruynge man, or ſelleth his lande, bicauſe he lyketh better redy mony, or marieth for his luſt, without godly conſideration, if that man can alledge nothynge, that ſhulde haue enforced his ſo doing &amp; yet wyl grudge at his fortune accomptynge hym ſelfe miſerable, he is put to ſilence with theſe fewe wordes. Ye might haue choſen. It ſhalbe ſaide to me percaſe, that here is a longe talke withoute ſcripture of, I myghte choſe, and, I coulde not choſe. And ſome ſhall call it wylye wyt, and

ſome ianglynge ſophiſtrie, &amp; ſome haly water reaſons,The deuil deuiſeth to depraue euerye thinge with prety termes. for with ſuche pretie wordes, the deuyll chereth his geſtes, whome he feeſteth with talkynge and ianglynge abrode in the worlde, wherewith to ouerwhelme the verye truth. To the matter I ſay thus, that this peace of truth, of mans free choyſe, to do good or euyll, confirmed in the ſcriptures, becauſe it hathe ben truely planted and roted in oure common ſpeache, I haue thought good, to ſtirre vp the remēbraunce of it, by diſcuſſinge the commen ſpeche to the intent when it appereth to agre with ſcripture, it may be more regarded, not bicauſe it is a commen ſpeche, but bycauſe it is the truth of ſcripture, wherby the better to reſiſt, ſuche peruerſe doctrine, as ſome wold perſuade to be in ſcripture of mere neceſſitie, vpō their wronge cōſideratiō, of gods

prouidence, election and predeſtination. Goddes ſecret iudgementes, I leaue vntouched, and god worketh after the purpoſe of his will. Whiche is mooſt iuſt. He calleth ſome in the morning, ſome latter, and at diuerſe houres of the day, as the parable ſheweth, But to vs whom he calleth at the tyme of workinge, whiles it is daye, and hath endued vs with the giftes of reaſon &amp; vnderſtanding: If a ſynner myght ſaye to god for defence of his actuall ſynne, I coulde not choſe but do as I dyd (whiche no ſuch man can do) it were an excuſe for his ſynne. But bycauſe god may truely ſaye to the ſynner. Thou mighteſt haue choſen, therein is the confuſion, in euery ſynners conſcience. This ſpeach ſhal percaſe offende many. And ſome wil ſay, may not the infant, that periſſheth in ye mothers

wombe, vnchriſtened, ſay to god, I coulde not chooſe? May not the childe borne, that dieth afore baptiſme, ſay, I coulde not choſe? And thoſe in ſuch countries as heare not of Chriſtes goſpell, may not they ſay, they could not choſe? and then ſhall we allow (ꝙ they) this lawiers diuinite of (I maye not choſe) for mannes allegacion to god, and graūt that all theſe be vpon this concluſiō ſaued? Herevnto I ſay, yt I do not take vpon me, to laye before you, the platte of al goddes ſecrete workes, but as (ſaynt Iohn̄ ſayth) that we haue ſene and hard, we teſtifie, and that god hath not opened let vs worſhip it, in ſilence. I intreate not in this place the ſtate of infantes, ne of other, who in reſpecte of choyce be lyke vnto them. Note of what ſort of men I ſpeake, and aſke not of other, of whom I talke not. He

In good fayth, I wyll make ſuche an aunſwere, as I wolde a greate meany (whē they myght truely) wold alſo plainly make. I can not tell (that is to ſay) in ſuch matters as mans capacitie can not go through. And note here reader, what I adde here to, I ſay not, I can not tel, bicauſe I knowe nothinge in the matter, but bicauſe, albeit there be ſome lyght, in thentry of ye matter, yet it is darke wtin, &amp; the ſpeach of it maketh not to our edification, but only to noriſh the curioſite of our deſire, to know that we can not comprehend.

Scripture is euidente, yt he that is not baptyzed ſhall not entre into heuen. Whereby I may ſay of their ſtate, they be not ſaued But then to other queſtions that maye ariſe, howe ſtande that with this or that, whereby to ſhewe the reaſon of gods ſecret iudgemētes. I can not tell. And herein the true confeſſiō of mans weaknes of capacitie, to comprehend gods ſecrecies, with cōfeſſing his ignoraūce and the aunſwere (I can not tell) doth muche ſette furth our reuerence to his maieſtye. And in this tyme of vaineglory in knowledge, it ſhall be as neceſſarie, to teache ignoraunce, for thexcluſion of arrogancye and preſumption, and plantyng of humilite, as hath ben in time of extreme darkenes, expediente, to ſette forthe knowledge to thincreaſe of gods glory. Both the extremities haue lyke inconuenience.

This ſaieng ſhall haue a ſkof that byſſhops wolde teache ignoraunce, for they teache men none other leſſon (ſome wyl ſaye) But when ſuch one hath wel pleaſed hym ſelfe in his ſkof, and ieſt, he ſhall finde that I ſay true, and him ſelfe to haue nede to lerne his ignoraunce in this point. But to the matter, I ſpeake in this place, of fre choice of ſuch, as to whome god offreth his gyftes beynge endued with grace, and maturitie of iudgement to diſcerne thē, of ſuch I am lerned by ſcriptures to ſaye that neceſſitie or cōpulſion to miſchief, were their excuſe (yf there were anye) and their fredome of choice, their only confuſiō to their condemnacion. And ſo S. Paule teſtifieth in the .ix. chapter of his epiſtel to the Romanes, where he ſheweth that the Iewes were reiected, bicauſe they ſtūbled at the

ſtumblyng ſtone, meaning chriſte. And god ſaid by his prophet To

                  a die expandi manus meas, ad populum non credentem &amp; cōtradicē
                  tem, I haue (ſaith god) ſpredde abrode my handes the hole daye, to a people not beleuing, &amp; gaineſaienge. So as god offringe his help which is ſignified, by the ſpredyng abrode of his handes, if that people had choſen rather to be in the houſe of their lorde god, then to dwel in ye tentis of ſynners, they had ben receyued to ſaluacion,An obiectiō
                we rede neuertheleſſe, that chriſt ſayd to his apoſtels, ye haue not choſen me but I haue choſē you. In whiche ſpeache it is to be noted that in comparynge together the doynge of god, with the cooperation of man, nothinge is to be attributed to man in the ſpeache, but all applyed to god, not becauſe mans doynge is nothynge, but bycauſe

it is nothinge in reſpecte of god. And whē ſoeuer man, in the glory of goddes giftes, is compared fondely to god, all that man hath, vadeth and wanneth away, as the lyght of a cādell, is not ſene, in the great lyght of a brighte ſonne. And therefore ſcripture ſayth. Non uos eſtis qui loquimini, ſed ſpiritus patris ueſtri qui loquitur in uobis, whiche denyeth not, but they ſpake, but theffectuouſe and chefe doer in the ſpeach was the holy ghoſt. And this alſo, may be commenly obſerued, that the fyrſt and principall thinge occupieth the name of the hole. And therfore bicauſe god choſeth vs fyrſt, and we can not chooſe god, before he choſeth vs, and offreth vs grace to come to him, Chriſt in his ſpech trulye affirmed his choiſe, whiche was chief, principall, and formeſt, and denied our choiſe, which depē
               deth

of it. And yet man beinge called to grace, and hauynge by reaſon therof the waye of lyfe offred him whiche no man is compelled to receiue, he maye in the receyuynge of it ſaye with the prophet Viam ueritatis elegi. The grekes call this choſynge of man (
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ) whiche taken away, they ſay man differeth not, frō a beaſt. And therfore the holly men of our religion, ſuche as haue traueyled in thexpoūding of ſcripture, do ſpecially note, that no ſcripture, may be thought ryght vnderſtāded wherby to take away mās fre choyce, &amp; therby to confirme compulſion or abſolute neceſſite, which both repugne thervnto. And this facultie to choſe, implieth alſo a diſcerning of good frō euyll, with a facultie to accept either this or that. Here mannes frowarde reaſon, hath deuiſed this ſophiſticall argument?

Can man choſe heauen? euen as wyſely ſpoken (ſayeth a good felowe) as to ſay a man can choſe to flye. And here commeth in ſcripture. The carnall man vnderſtandeth not, anye thinge of god, and howe ſhoulde ſuch one choſe heauen? Brother (ꝙ this godly reaſoner) ſeeſt not howe wit trauaileth to drowne gods word, and blynde it with wittie deuiſes? I pray the note this (ſaith he) After the lyght of goddes worde hath putte out their free wyll: nowe come they about the buſſhe agayne, with the name of free choice, and all is not worth a greane cheaſe.

               tion, Loke Paul to the Epheſians and there ſhalte thou fynde, that god hath choſen man before the begynnynge of the world. Kepe this in thy breſt what ſo euer they ſay, I vnderſtande this englyſſhe, as

wel as the beſt byſſhop of them of all. And after this ſorte ſome (I wolde they were a leſſer ſome) do handle this matter abrode, whom I wolde gladlye ſatiſfye, and I truſt could alſo, if they were indifferent, to haue the very truth haue place, rather then that they wolde haue truth. But to the matter, mā can not of him ſelf in dede, flye, no more then he can, withoute gods gyft clyme to heauen. And yet ſcripture ſaith. Quis dabit michi pennas ſicut columbe, et uolabo et requieſcam? who ſhall gyue me fethers, as it were of a doue and I ſhal flye and reſte me? Thus Dauyd enſpired by god, deſyred fethers to flye, which whē they were offred him, then Dauid mighte choſe whether he wolde vſe them or no. Dauid knewe withoute fethers he coulde not flye, and alſo, when he had obteyned thē, might

choſe whether he wold flye or no, but marke that I ſay further in ye parable of diſtribucion of Talentes, he yt had but one talent &amp; layde it vp, myght haue vſed it, as thother dyd, but he myſuſed his iudgement &amp; laide it vp idelly. So as when thaccōpt was aſked of him, of that he had receiued, and vpon knoweledge that it was laide vp idle, was aſked, why he dydde not giue the mony to vſury? His aunſwere was not that he laide it vp, bycauſe he coulde not chooſe, but he declared the reaſons by him deuiſed and excogitate which he ſaid moued him, to laye it vp, wherby appeareth, that as they, that had fyue Talentes, and myght haue layed them vp, did choſe to be induſtriouſe and faythfull, and encreaſe their talentes, by exercyſe, &amp; were of theyr lord conſidered therafter, in lykewyſe he that was

ſlouthfull and dyd choſe, to laye his talent vp idle, was of his lord ſo taken and vſed accordingelye. And here note wel reader and thou ſhalte perceyue the craftye ſophiſtry, of the deuyll, in the perſon of hym, that pretendeth ſymplycitie. In the parable aforeſaide, theſe men to whome Talentes were gyuen could not choſe to haue the Talentes gyuen vnto them, for that was in the pleaſure of hym, that was lorde of the Talentes, hereunto all muſt agree wherein is reſembled goddes choice. But when the owner of the Talentes, beynge at lybertye, to diſtribute or not dyſtrybute hys Talentes, hadde thought good and ſo choſen, to diſtrybute the Talentes of his owne mere clemencye, to one moo, and an other leſſe, Then the receyuers of theſe Talentes, myghte lykewyſe chooſe (as it

appeareth they dydde) whether they wolde vſe them or no. For ſome of them dydde vſe them, and ſome dydde not. And here thou mayeſt ſee playnly a reſemblaūce of gods choice that the ſely ſoule ſpake of, and of our choice, whiche I haue entended here to intreate. God choſeth to geue vnto vs his giftes,God choſeth and man choſeth. and in that part we haue no choyce, and thē we chooſe, whether we wyll vſe the gyftes or no, and in this part we haue fre choyſe, as appeareth, in declaration of this parable. For in oure inclynatyon to good or euyll, there is neyther neceſſitie nor compulſion:fre wil in the ful ſignificacion, ſhulde implye free choyce. Bytwene free wyll and free choice, I put no differēce, but in the termes of free choice, whiche expreſſeth the greke and latin wordes, Liberum arbitrium, and 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , the matter may be more clerely opened in my iudgement. For albeit free

wyll and free choice, were ment to ſignifie one thynge, yet they that be more fine, in their conſideracions, by abuſe of the wordes, from their ful ſignification, haue deuyſed, howe to graunt free wyll, becauſe they ſawe the world, ſo much abhorre the deniall of it, and yet therewith, to defende ſtyll, theyr abhominable dreame, of mere neceſſitie, which mere neceſſitie, can in no wyſe ſtande,Neceſſite cannot ſtande with free choyſe. with mannes fre choice, For neceſſitie ſignifieth one poynt and no mo, whereunto any thinge is directed. Nowe euerye choice muſt be of twoo, at the leaſt, for one hath no choiſe, ſo as he that is neceſſitate to be dāpned hath no choice, ne he that is neceſſitate, to be ſaued, hath any choice,A man may wyll that is neceſſary, i

                     •
                   any ſenſe▪
                and both theſe ſortes of men, haue no free choice at al. But as for fre wyl, as we take it onely for a deſirouſe appetite, which is not the ful

ſignification of free wyl, may ſtād with neceſſitie, as in example a mā beinge neceſſitate to dye (as euery man is) may alſo gladly, willinglye and deſirouſlye, dye, as many haue done for chriſtes ſake, many for glorye, manye for werines of their lyfe, And muche more, if men were neceſſitate to be ſaued, they ſhulde gladly, willingly, and deſirouſlye, do the workes of ſaluacion. And ſo the Captaines of the ſecte haue, ſtudied oute a deuyſe howe deceyuyng men, in the ſignification of fre wyll, as thoughe it ſignified no choice at all but only a deſirouſe appetite, they haue graunted that man hath free wyll to his ſaluacion, whiche they call a wyl newe create of god, to be deſirous of ſaluacion, and therewith defende ſtyll their mere neceſſitie, &amp; there withall ſay this alſo, that a good man doth neceſſarilye wel, &amp;

alſo frely well, and an euyll man, doth neceſſarily euyll, and frelye nought. They ſaye alſo, that god doth compell no man, for compulſion (ſaye they) is contrary to free wyl, But not neceſſite, and for this they alledge the ethnyke philoſopher Ariſtotell, bicauſe he maye helpe forwarde, who conſidering,Ariſtotell ſpeaketh of the 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , which is commen to man &amp; beaſte, and ſo is not volūtas nor arbitrium. the naturall partes of the ſoule ſayth that uiolentum opponitur voluntati, non neceſſitas. And yet Ariſtotell vſeth ſuch a word in the ſteade of uoluntas, as ſignifiethe Lubentiam or libidinem, that is commen to man and beaſt and not uoluntatem whiche is propre to man, and yet thus they ſhyft in the wordes, to deceiue ye ſimple, whom they wold ſeme to deſire, to teache goddes truth, and vnder pretence therof, do ſowe abrode the deuyls falſhed. But Ariſtotel their author ſaith, that abſolute neceſſite which

is properly neceſſitie, is contrarye to fre choice, which man muſt haue or he is no man. And what a Sophiſme is this to ſay, that a good man doth neceſſarilie well, and an euyll man doth neceſſarilie euyll, and therewith ſay alſo that man is not compelled by god, to good or euyll. For euerye meere neceſſitie that can not be eſchued, and is o
                  •
                it ſelf a neceſſitie, doth enforce and compell all the meane cauſes, to do hym ſeruice, for meere neceſſitie wyl be by no meanes diſapointed▪ And it is ſaid therefore,Nothinge more violent thē neceſſite. that there is nothynge more violente, then neceſſitie abſolute. And marke we
                  •
                theſe teachers, for in doctrine they conclude eche mannes ſaluacion or dampnacion vnder mere neceſſitie, and yet they ſay, god compelleth no man. And then becauſe th
                  •
                philoſopher ſayth, that compulſion onelye is contrarye, to fre wyll

not neceſſitie, they ſay a good man doth frelye and neceſſarilye good, and an euyll man frely and neceſſaryly euyll. And as they do in the wordes of free wyll ſo they play in the worde (neceſſitie) whiche is taken two wayes.Neceſſitie, is taken twoo wayes. For there is a mere and abſolute neceſſitie, that the lerned men call neceſſitatem conſequentis and a condicionall neceſſitie, whiche the lerned men, cal neceſſitatem conſequentie. As in this example, when I tell one he ſhall dye the corporall death. I tell hym a mere neceſſitie, for he ſhall nedes dye, and it dependeth neither of iffes, ner andes, ne can not be auoided, but that neceſſite of death cōpelleth al meane cauſes to ſerue it neceſſarylye, to the accomplyſhment of it. Therefore I maye ſay, It is merelye and abſolutelye neceſſary that thou ſhalte dye. And this is neceſſitas conſequentis,
               
For the thinge is ordered preciſly ſo to be. But if I ſay
                  •
                thus, Forbearyng thy foode, thou muſt neceſſarily die or it be longe this neceſſite is no mere neceſſite but dependeth vpon the condycyon, of the forbearyng thy foode marye auoyde not the condicion but lette that ſtande true, &amp; then ye neceſſitie foloweth. And of this ſorte of neceſſitie ye gentyles, ſuche as hadde clearer vnderſtanding reputed that they called deſtine, fatum. As put thy fynger in ye fyer▪ and it wyll neceſſarylye burne hauinge the natural cauſe, no le
                  •
                of operacion. Nowe if it were aſked, whether thy fynger ſhoulde neceſſarilye burne, I muſt ſaye no, meanynge of a preciſe, abſolute and mere neceſſytye, for thou neadeſte not put thy fynger in the fyre, and ſo the burnynge ſhall be auoyded. But and yf thou putteſ
                  •
               
               
thy fynger in the fyer, then of a cō
               dicionall neceſſitie, it muſt neades burne. Nowe marke the ſophiſtry of this ſect,The ſophiſtry of ſuch as defende mere neceſſitie. A good man (they ſay) doth neceſſarilye good, and that is true, in a condicionall neceſſite. For if he be a good man he muſte neades do well, for as ſone as he ceaſſeth to do good he is no lenger a good man, and ſo in an euyll man, he doth neceſſarylye euyll, for yf he dydde well he were no more an euyll man. And thys neceſſytye hathe in deede no compulſyon, becauſe the former parte of the ſpeache, is at lybertie withoute neceſſytie or compulſyon, and the latter parte is made neceſſarye, by the maynetenaunce of the trueth in the fyrſte parte. And therfore this ſpeach is true. Thomas beynge a good man dothe neceſſarylye well and Iohn̄ an euyll man doth neceſſarylye euyll:

But this is not true, ye Thomas, ſpeakyng of ye ſame Thomas doth neceſſarily wel, or Iohn̄ ſpeaking of the ſame Iohn̄, doth neceſſarily euyll. For there is no neceſſitie at al, in the matter, but vpon vpholdynge the truth of the condicion, whiche in theſe latter ſpeaches is lefte out, And thus I haue declared the difference of neceſſities, the one mere and abſolute, and the other condicionall, and I haue ſhewed howe the ſymple people not hauinge their ſenſes exerciſed be deceyued by ſuche as be the deuyls apoſtels to ſeduce the worlde with intricatiō of ſpeach, and like falſe marchauntes, ſhiftynge the wordes whiche be markes, from the ſignification of one thyng to an other, by ſuch colors mainteine diſcorde &amp; diſagremente in thoſe thinges wherin it were moſt expedient, men ſhuld agre. This matter

of free choice hath muche troubled the church, by reaſon of ſuch, as wold preſume, to haue through knoweledge of all thynge after their diſcuſſion, and ſo entangling them ſelfe, with goddes high miſteries, haue ben authors of ſuche opinions, of mere neceſſitie, as not onlye impugne the hole proceſſe, of ſcripture, but alſo ſubuerteth al ſtaye of good direction, and endeuoure, eyther to godlye exercyſe, or polytyque behauoure. It is the extremite of al miſcheif, to ſay that man can not choſe whether he wyl vſe gods giftes or no, when they be offered hym, whiche is the time of mans choice (as afore) for we muſt be perſuaded that as god giueth to man his giftes frely without neceſſitie or compulſion: ſo mā receiueth them frely without neceſſitie or compulſion to vſe them. As for the high diuinite ye ſpeake

of (mayſter Ioye) I wyll not enquyre ye further of it, but wold wiſſhe that diuinite were ordered godlye, ſpoken of reuerentlye and ſemely, with feare of errour, with humble meke ſpirites, not arrogantly, not preſūptuouſly, not by way of ieſting, not by way of raylyng, not out of ſeaſon, nor amonges other paſtimes, to ſupply other communicacion. Gregorye Nazianzene a noble clercke of the greke church, ſcolemaſter to ſaynt Ierome, in whoſe tyme there were certayne called Eunomians, who affirmed there was no waye to heauen, but one, to talke of god, and diſpute of goddes workes.

he noteth them how they troubled, all good aſſembles, with theyr talkes in ſcrypture. And that talke waxed ſo common, that women alſo troubled their nourſeries therewith, and by occaſiō of their talke, loſte as he ſayth, the floure of their ſhamefaſtnes, For whoſe reformacion at that tyme, he ſheweth that of God, neyther al ſhuld be diſputed that myght be ſpoken, nor all men ſhulde ſpeake of hym, nor to all men, nor in all tymes, In ſpeakynge of God, he wolde mens capacitie, ſhulde be conſidered. For the time (he ſayth) we ſhulde not mingle the talke of God, at the time of other triflinge pleaſures. As for ye audience, he wold it were ſuche as the ſpeakynge of God myght edyfie, For them that ſhuld talke, he wolde wyſſhe them either perfytelye clenſed in their lyfe, or at the leaſte ſuche as endeuoured

them ſelfe to amende in theyr lyfe, leſt beinge fylthy and corrupt in liuinge, they ſhulde hurte them ſelfe, as he that hath ſore eyes is hurte by ſight of the ſonne. This was the mynde of this good man at that tyme, and when he had ſaid thus muche, he was afrayde they wolde haue miſreported him, that he forbad them to thinke of God alwayes. For in ſuche wyſe euyll diſpoſed people, are wont to make miſreport, of good aduertiſement. And therfore (he ſaith) I wold they ſhuld thinke of god, as oft as they breath, but I ſpeake (ꝙ he) of talkynge, reaſonynge and diſputing of god, whiche he calleth in one worde (
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ) And yet I do not (ꝙ he) improue that, but the vntymelynes of it, and the exceſſe of it, And al thinge (ꝙ he) hathe his tyme, as Salamon ſayeth. And good is not good (as Gregorye

Nazianzene there ſayeth) yf it be not well done. It is ſemely (ꝙ he) for a woman to were a mans garment? And after in the ſame worke do not ſaint Paule ſaye, that all be not apoſtels? ne all prophetes, and finally concludeth the matter that yf the ytche of mens tongues can not otherwiſe be healed, but they muſt nedes talke, he byddeth them talke of ſuche matters, as wherein an errour is withoute all daunger. Thus in effecte, ſayeth Gregory Nazianzene, who, amonges ſome, yf he were here, myghte percaſe heare that he wolde be ſorye for, and yet he for his highe learninge in diuinitie, hath ben honoured and celebrate by the name of Theologus, as exceading al other in knowledge of diuínite.

               Yet dare not he expreſſe his condiciō, ſayenge playnly: Faith aſſewreth me of the promyſe of god (if I fulfyll the lawe) but Win. nor none elles, but onely chryſte, fulfylled the lawe ergo neyther Winch. nor any els ſtandynge this condicion, ſhall neuer be aſſured of the promyſe of God. Paule argueth a nother wayes excludyng the condicion that men myghte be the ſuerer and certayner of the promyſe. For yf the promyſe ſhulde ſtande of an vncertayne, yea impoſſible condicion: who ſhall be certayne and aſſured of the promyſe? Thus argueth Paule. By the workes

of the law came not the promyſe to Abrahā or to his ſeade, hym to be thayer of the worlde, but by the rightwiſe makyng by fayth. For yf they that wyl be iuſtified by ye workes be therfore made thayers, ſo is faith and beleue in vayne and the promiſe voyde &amp; fruſtrate. For the law worketh but wrath, ergo it worketh no good workes to thattaynement of iuſtification. It worketh wrath for that it is impoſſible to be perfourmed &amp; accōplyſhed of man which is fleſſhe, as Paule conſtantly affirmeth, &amp; therfore it wrappeth all the workers therof to be iuſtified thereby vnder the curſe. For as many as ſtande vppon the workes of the lawe to this ende euen for theyr iuſtificaciō are yoked vnder exetracion and tyed to the curſe Gala. iii. For where is no law there is no tranſgreſſyon. Wherfore (Paule nowe concludeth agaynſte Wincheſter ſayenge) out of faythe is the herytage geuen, lyke as oute of grace, that the promiſe myghte be the more ferme and ſewerer vnto all the ſeade, not to it that is onely out of the lawe, but alſo to it whiche is oute of the faythe of Abraham. Paule in ſpirite dydde ſe before this Wincheſters condycion to fruſtrate the promyſe, and therfore he confuteth it here ſo clearely. And agayne vnto

the Galathens, If anye wolde obiecte ſayinge, ergo the lawe is agenſte the promyſes. God forbyd ſaith Paule, but if there had ben a lawe geuen whyche myghte haue geuen lyfe, then no doute iuſtification myghte haue commen by the lawe. But the ſcripture concluded all vnder ſynne that the promyſe, the promyſe (I ſaye) out of the faith of Ieſu Chriſte ſhoulde be geuen and not deſerued to the beleuers. Thus ye ſe how with ſo many wordes Paule excludeth Wynch. impoſſible condicion, to make faſt the promiſe in Chriſt that our faith myght be the ſewrer ſtayed and cleaue to it. If onely vnbelefe dampneth, why ſhulde not onelye faith iuſtifie? it is a good argument of contrary. But yet becauſe Win. wyndeth in his condicion ſo harde for the attaynement of his iuſtificacion by workes. I wolde fayne ſe ſome one of his good workes ſo perfyt, pure without any carnall affecte annexed, either of vayneglorye or of loue to hym ſelfe or for feare of payne not done nor for hope of reward, or any lucre, promocion or to receyue a better thinge for the doinge thereof, out of ſo pure an herte that it be not done of any affeccion to the perſon, put onely of fayth and zeale for the glorye of god &amp; profit of his neighbour, or onely to mortify

his owne affectes and to ſet naught by hym ſelfe, to abnegate and renounce his eſtimacion and glory, to be renewed in ſpirite and to folowe chriſte mekelye to death. Paul acknowlegeth hym ſelfe and complayneth in his moſt perfection not to be able to do that good which he wolde do, but to do that euyll whiche he wolde not do. He durſte not call in, this condicion to atteine his iuſtificacion thereby, but conſtantlye affirmed as many as ſtande vpon the workes of the lawe to fulfyl them, thereby to be iuſtified, are yoked vnto the curſe of the law ſayenge. Curſed is euery man that abydeth not in all thinges written in the booke of the lawe to perfourme them. I wonder therefore that Wyncheſter dare ſtand vpon his condicion to be fulfylled to attayne any part of his iuſtificacion therby. Dare he claime (thinke ye) any part of his iuſtificacion for burning of Doctor Barnes and his felows for preaching agenſt theſe wykedly armed artycles? Tel vs Wynche. dyddeſt thou burne them ſo cruelly of loue and not of hatred or enuye? trwelye loue burneth no man▪ for preachynge ye truth charitie enuyeth not. &amp;c. Abi igitur poſt Chriſtum ſatana. Come bak deuyl after chriſte, thou arte ſclaunderous to his croſſe, for beinge maried to thyne own

wytte, thou ſauourſt not the heauenlye and godly iuſtification, but ſuche one as naturall reaſon perſwadeth amonge men, euen one good turne for a nother to be done, and ſo to deſerue thy iuſtification. But be it in caſe, that Wynche. thus condicioninge with god hath in his owne opinion done ſome good dede whereby he dare clayme his iuſtification, yet ſhall not that ſame deede ſerue hym to the attaynement of that effecte. For were it neuer ſo good, yet dothe his falſe opynyon in his deede make it dampnable. But lette vs ſpeake of a good deede abſolutelye, excluded from all carnall affectes (yf any man maye do ſuch one) this deede is not our dede, but the dede of God workynge it in vs, for what deede ſoeuer procedeth out of oure corrupte nature is naughte. It is god ſayeth Paule that worketh in you accordynge to hys good mynde bothe to wyll well, and alſo to perfourme your worke: Neyther are we apte and able to thynke ſo muche as a good thoughte out of our owne ſelues, but al oure ablenes commeth frome God.

Nowe make an ende Wyn. and conclude your arrogant articles.

                AS for your talke in ye lawe, it is not worth an hawe, for it is beſides ye matter, and before aūſwered, my ſayenges ye can not improue, ſauynge that ye ſaye, I may not adde to gods word, whervnto I wyll aunſwer, that I adde

not but only marke and note what gods worde conteineth. And when I ſe ſo many tymes, yf, required of vs, I knowe none other englyſſhe name, to ſignifie what that is,A diſcuſſio
                     •
                   what is adding to god
                     •
                   worde but a condicion: And here let vs dyſcuſſe, what we ſhall cal addyng to gods worde. If ye cal thinuencion of a newe worde whereby to diſcerne what is written in ſcripture, as I or you vnderſtand it, an addicion to gods worde: then do you and all your ſecte, offende in deuyſynge the wordes (office and correlatiue) to ſignify what fayth doth, and howe it apprehendeth the promyſe, whiche I thynke the ſpirite wold not ſuffre you to do, if it were addynge to goddes worde. Moreouer I thynke ye call not addyng to goddes worde thaddynge of an other language wherein to expres gods worde, by other ſyllables thē it was firſt ſpokē in. For then were

ye world on both partes, in a great offence, being gods worde tranſlate into ſo many tōgues, nothing like the original tongues of greke or Hebrue. Whereby appeareth, that beynge the true ſenſe kepte hole, and entier, the letters and ſillables maye be altered withoute daunger, as the language requyreth, &amp; without any contradiction of this texte, for not addynge to goddes worde. Furthermore yf thexplayninge and openinge of ſcripture, with mo wordes in the ſame language with ſimilitudes alſo, to giue more light to the true ſenſe, ye meane to declare, were adding to gods worde, I am ſure ye wolde not haue trauailed ſo much in thexpoſicions of ſcriptures, as ye haue doone in youre ſundrye bokes, And ſpeciallye, where ye make a drinking of chriſtes holly ſupper, ne haue vſed the ſimilitude

ye haue done, of the ſonne and fier, for declaration of the ſecrete workynge of fayth alone, yf ye had taken that for addynge to goddes word. When ye rayle of me vncharitablye and deuyſe for your purpoſe, that is not true, we can not cal that adding to gods word, that is all beſides it and contrarye to goddes word. When I ſaye to you that it is pitie to ſee, the giftes of learnynge in you and many other ſo abuſed and abhominacion moſt deteſtable, to ſe the pretēce of gods worde, to couer ſo many deuelyſhe and deteſtable wordes of ſclaūder malice, myſchief and hereſy, wyll you ſaye that I adde to goddes word herein bicauſe it is not there directlye ſpoken of you? ye can not truely. For albeit, it be not ſpecially wrytten of you, yet becauſe of a generall warraunt of ſcripture, that we maye ſaye and wryte,

that is truth, and edyfieth, ye can not ſay I adde herein vnto gods worde, but accordynge to goddes worde ſaye truthe. And ſo likewiſe in euery other iuſte honeſt and holy thynge. Who then doth adde to goddes worde? Only he that calleth ſcripture whiche is not ſcripture, or reporteth the ſence of gods ſcripture amiſſe. For ſuch one frameth hym ſelfe an ydol in his own fanſy, and worſhippeth it for gods truth falſely. Suche men adde to gods worde and reporte not god truely, and therefore (as the texte ſayth) ſhall be condempned as lyers. And this is the true vnderſtandynge of this texte broughte in by you. Adde not to goddes worde. Whyche I haue harde manye tymes vſed, lyke a keye to cleue logges, and therfore haue diſcourſed thunderſtandynge of it. As for the ſayeng of ſaint Ambroſe, maketh

nothing agaynſt myne article, For in the begynnynge when the contention was betwene chriſte &amp; Moyſes lawe, by faith was ſignified hole chriſt, and by workes the lawe of Moyſes, and in this ſtrife where fayth and workes ſtoode in contencion one againſt a nother, the ſpeache onely fayth, was ſpoken of that good faith, only to exclude Moyſes lawe, with the receyuynge or not receyuyng, wherof chriſtendome was troubled. For els onely did neuer exclude the familiar companye of faythe with charitie that ſtode of the ſame ſide that faith doth. And ſo you youre ſelfe vnderſtande it, that charitie is there and not excluded. And the precyſe wordes (wtout any worke) exclude onelye the workes of the lawe, for the workes of receyuynge and vſynge the giftes of fayth, &amp; loue, muſt nedes be there

as is before declared. And nowe to the article that foloweth in youre boke, whiche article ye call myne, and I am very glad ſo to take it, it foloweth thus.

                  A man beynge in deadly ſynne, maye haue grace to do ye workes of penaūce, whereby he maye attayne to his iuſtification.
            
            
               
                  Ioye. 
               
               And I ſay the contrarye. That a man beynge in deedly ſynne maye haue no grace to do the workes of penaunce, as I feare me it wyll be verified of Win. hym ſelfe. But the Lorde conuerte him ones, ſo that all men maye ſe his open frutes of repentaunce for his greuous perſecution of Chryſtes membres and heare hym openly with teares recanting his falſe doctrine wherby he hath ſeduced many a ſymple ſoule. This is lo, his doctrine, A man muſt do the workes of penaunce before he be iuſtified, and ſo by ſuche workes merite and deſerue his iuſtification and forgyuenes of ſynnes. Here thou ſeeſt (chriſten reader) that ſuche a man hath no nede of Chriſtes death, but for ſuch men (ſayth Paule) Chriſt is deade in vayne. Thus

ye ſe the concluſyon of his articles to be. That he maye do well before he be iuſtified. But (as I ſayd before) it behoueth a learned diuine to cōclude what ought to be done, &amp; what god wylleth to be beleued by his manifeſt word, and not what Winch. may do by his owne blynde reaſonyng without gods word. He maye do well by the gyfte of God (ſayth he) whiche is faythe, ergo his fayth goeth before his well doyng and his iuſtification, and his good workes muſt be thruſt betwixt both (if the place be not to narow for them) ſo that he hauynge his faith and his good workes, is not as yet iuſtified neyther by his faith nor by his good workes, for they muſte ſerue him but toward the attainment to his iuſtificacion. Paule &amp; chriſt ioyned faith &amp; iuſtificaciō euer inſeparably together: but this ſciſmatike iewiſh Hieroboam and deuilliſh deuider of al chriſtē vnite wil thruſt his good works betwixt thē, not ſuffring fayth to cleue to immediatly her owne obiecte, euen the mercye of God promyſynge remyſſyon of ſynnes in Chryſtes deathe. He wolde thruſte in here the workes of penaunce before iuſtyfycacyon whyche thinge howe folyſſhe it is ye ſhall ſe. Fyrſte, ye knowe that penaunce muſte go before her workes as is the tree

before her frutes. Penaunce is a turninge to god, whereby of the ſyncere feare of god a man humbled acknowelegeth his ſinne, and ſo al his whol life he maketh newe. Who turneth to god, but he fyrſte beleue and knoweth god for chriſtes ſake to be ſo mercyfull vnto hym that at his turnynge to hym he receyueth him and forgeueth hym hys ſynnes? whiche faithe and knoweledge what els is it then his iuſtification, god the father ſo affirmynge it in his prophet Iſai ſayeng. In the knowledge of hym this euen my ſeruant ſhal iuſtifye many. Here ye ſe yt this knowledge and faithe iuſtifieth before the workes of penaunce are done. For God is kn

                TO this article your aunſwer is peremptorye, and ye trauerſe the matter ſo plainlye after the lawiers pleding, as you haue faſhioned it mete to be remitted

vnto ye coūtry. And herein I ſhall ſpeake to you againe, ſomewhat lyke a lawier. Ye handle me in youre aunſwer lyke one of youre ſecte, and do the worlde vnderſtād hereby, whervnto this vnreuerēte reaſonynge, diſputynge, and talkynge of goddes truth wyll come to at the laſt, that is to ſaye, to diuiſion, debate, hatred and ſtryfe, when in that all ſhulde ſaye one, eche ſhal aunſwere other, as ye do nowe me, with, I ſaye the contrarye. And ſo learnynge is all paſte, and the matter reſteth vpon twelue men, wherein ye labour the countre as faſte as ye maye. And ye flatter the world with lycentiouſe doctrine, and offer them to pull from theyr neckes, all ſuche yokes as ye thinke dyd at any tyme let or impeche them either in thought or dede, Ye promiſe them libertie of al thynge. And then to rydde

them out of dette, ye tranſlate ſaint Paule thus, that we owe nothyng to no man but loue. Ye flatter the couetouſe maiſter with pullynge away holy dayes, yt he maye haue the more worke done hym for hys yeres wages. Ye flatter again the ſeruaunt with pullynge awaye al opiniō of faſt by abſtinēce frō any meat either in lēt or otherwiſe. Ye offer prieſtes wyues to wyt &amp; they can winne them to you. Ye rydde all of confeſſion, and wepinge for ſynne. Ye take awaye diſtiction &amp; difference of apparel, days, times, and places. Ye take away ceremonies whiche in dede do muche let good chere in aſſēblies of good felowes. Ye gyue women courage and libertie to talke at their pleaſure ſo it be of gods worde, and to make the huſbande amendes for that encombrye, ye teache men ſecretly (and ſo as you may denye it

agayne if nede be, tyll it be time to come abrode) that they maye haue as lawfully two wiues at ones, as one, ſo they wyll finde them bothe, I do not herein fame or lye, for I knowe they haue not written in any matter more ſeriouſlye ne more fondelye (but yet maliciouſly and vntruly) then to proue it lawfull for a man to haue two wyues at ones though the firſt be neuer ſo chaſt. And ſo whē women be ſo erneſt to ſet forth youre enterpryſe, they be ſuffred of god for punyſſhmēt to worke there owne confuſiō. And after ye ſame ſort by other intiſemētes lerned mē, to depraue lerning, &amp; preſtes to trauel to deſtroy pryſthode. And in this wiſe for puniſhmēt of our ſinne, eche part laboureth by a meane to ſcourge &amp; trouble their owne aſtate. And in the meane time your ſecte hopeth to winne the countrey, and therefore

Ye haue a great while awayted to haue the panel returned, but the kinges moſt excellent maieſtye who hath the highe ſhiriffes office in his hande vnder god, coulde neuer yet be induced to retourne the Iurye as ye wolde haue it. And therfore

I haue ſeene you often tymes fall in a non ſute, and lyen ſtyll in wayte, as they yt haue euel tytles to landes to haue the ſhirif for your purpoſe. How ſaye you now, haue I not commened with you lyke a lawier? and truely declared the councelles of your ſecte,Thenglyſſh of this lati

I wold lawiers had alwaies their tales tolde them of their clientes ſo truly as I haue tolde this, and then the worlde ſhulde not be troubled with ſo many longe ſutes as it nowe is. But now to your contraryenge of me whiche ye faſhyon thus, And I ſaye the contrary. If I were lyke you I ſhoulde ſaye agayne, Mary and I ſaye the contrarye to you. And then thicker, you lye and you lye, and I can tel as well as you, and I as well as you. And ſhall this fruyte growe

of goddes worde? and ſo you wyll haue this broughte againe of the prymatyue churche, that our hearers and readers of oure bookes ſhall ſay I beleue Ioye, and I beleue Wyncheſter. Ego Cephe, Ego pauli, but yet to auoyde ſome parte of that inconuenience, men haue deuiſed to ſay, now I beleue not Luther, nor Melancton, nor Bewcer, nor Suinglius, nor Ioye nor Turnor. And call them (for the tyme) knaues, for Maledictus qui confid

                  t in homine, but I beleue (ꝙ he) goddes holy wordes which can not lye as men do. And ſhall I not beleue the wordes of the byble?

                wyll aſke me. And is not this well

ſaide? Verelye if man were neuer deceyued, in the true ſence of gods worde, and were aſſured that god in dede taught him by his holye ſpirite the aunſwere were graue, but when ſo many errours are arriſen in the ſence of goddes holy worde, and the deuyll maye and hath tranſformed him ſelfe into the aungell of lyght, ſuche ſpeach in communycacyon is beſydes the purpoſe. For men doute not whether goddes holye worde is to be beleued, but what is ye ſence of goddes holye worde. And the maner of ſpeache aforeſaide, beinge ſo preciſe ſerueth rather, as aſhes, to couer fier, to kepe an error cloſe, then with ſobre communication eche man miſtruſtinge his owne learninge, to trye out what other men whoſe ſpirite is commē
               ded vnto vs, haue by one conſent lefte written and teſtified what

they vnderſtande in the matter. Mary you maiſter Ioye, I praye you pardonne me, for yf god hath ſo made you of his ſecrete counſel, that ye can tel what chriſt thought (as ye haue before arrogantly affyrmed) ye may ſpeake for ſo much with more aucthorytie, then anye other. But let vs conſidre ones agayne your (And I ſay the contrary) for albeit ye ſaye ſo in ſumme yet when ye declare your ſelfe afterwarde, ſome wolde conſter ye ſayde otherwyſe, and that whether ye wyll or no ye agree with me. For when ye call penaunce a turnynge to God, youre ſayenge implyeth, that before ſuche a man as turneth by penaunce dydde by goddes callynge turne, that man was out of gods fauour not iuſtified but turned from God, and after that by grace turneth, whyche ye call penaunce. So as if ye

maye be ſo vnderſtanded, ye ſaye that a man beynge a ſynner maye haue grace to turne. The differēce yf we vnderſtande you thus, betwene you and me is, that you expreſſe the worke of penaunce, whyche ye call turnynge, And I ſpeake of the worke of penaunce in general, and yet I haue not contended with you, what be the workes of penaūce. And for ought I here of you in the workes of penaunce, I ſhall not contende with you muche but agre with you for all this bablynge, that turninge to god is the worke of penaunce, ſo it be a hole turne, whereof ſcripture ſpeaketh, with a mannes hole harte in faſtinge, wepynge, and waylynge, and as the church hath declared our turnynge ſhuld be, and not halfe a turne, as ſome of your ſcole teache and amonges all, your turnyng Turnor, whom

god turne into the right waye. But afterwarde ye handle your turninge otherwyſe &amp; wyll ſo vnderſtande your turninge, as a ſynner ſhulde be iuſtified, before he doth turne, wherein you turne the matter ſo aboute, as it is inexplicable, for by you a ſinner turneth not, as your ſpeache purporteth, but a man that was a ſynner now beleuing and iuſtified hauing his ſynnes forgeuē turneth, and ſo, he that is turned all ready in iuſtificacion, &amp; yet remaynyng thā turneth agayn in penaunce, and then the ſeconde turninge ſhulde be from god, yf ye turninge in iuſtificacion were to god, as it muſte neads be, for in remyſſyon of ſynne and iuſtificacion god turneth man to him. And ſo the playne man, whom ye take vpon you to teache playnly, wolde vnderſtand it. For when ye ſay that

a ſinner before his turnyng by penaunce beleueth and is iuſtified, that is one turne, where he was before from god, now to be towardes hym. And then if there be yet after a turnynge againe in penaunce, that turnynge muſt nedes be from god. For a ſeconde turne muſte nedes be contrarye to the fyrſte, as a ſimple man aunſwered when one told him the world was turned. Then (ꝙ he) all is well, for I harde my graundfather ſaye in his tyme, the worlde was turned, And then the worlde was nought. And therfore by the ſeconde turne he concludeth, it ſhulde be good. For in two turnes one ſuccedinge a nother, yf the firſt be one waye, the ſeconde is a nother. And yet you wolde haue a ſynner fyrſt iuſtified by fayth wherein he is turned to god, and then turne by penaunce. If ye wolde call me nowe

Pelagian, bycauſe I ſhuld ſpeake as thoughe man myghte turne of him ſelfe withoute belefe, then I wolde ſaye ye ſpake as beſemethe the perſon ye mainteyne, I haue learned and therafter ſpeake, that a ſinner can not turne without the grace of god, which god dyſtributeth by degrees, as ye ſōne ſheweth her ſelfe in the morninge, in whom there is encreaſe by ſucceſſe tyl the ſonne come to the higheſt at noon. Men fall ſodenly downe the hyll from god, but they be drawen vp the hyll to hym by degrees. And the degrees of helth be ſignified in the miracle of chriſt, of the blynde man, to whome chriſt reſtored not his perfit ſyghte at ones, but by degrees. We preache to mē to riſe in the morníng, orto iam ſole for Vanum eſt ante lucem ſurgere, and ye bydde men lye ſtyll, whyle it be noon, that the ſonne be at the

higheſt, &amp; this cauſeth your fonde ſtoicall ſcoole of extremities, whiche admytteth no meane. I haue bene ſomewhat mery with you for my owne relefe, beinge vexed and weried with your fond talke, whiche is ſuche as maketh onely a cō
               fuſion of that ye ſpeake of without frute or edifienge. And yet I can not pretermytte, to note ſomewhat in your iuſtification, which ye declare thus.
            
               
                  Ioye. 
               
               Now let vs ſe the order of our iuſtification before god accordynge to the ſcriptures. Firſte (ſayth Paule) we are choſen of god in Chryſt before the foundacion of the worlde was layde. And when we be borne anewe of the ſpirite we are called to receyue fayth Ioan. i. and .i. Ioan. v. which gyfte of faith certifyeth vs of our election, geuynge vs the knowlege of god the father, in, and by Chriſte. Whiche knowledge, as nothynge can be ſayd breiflyer ſo is there nothynge more excellent, ſweter, more full and perfit, holſomer, more comfortable and ioyouſe. For when I knowe

god the father in Chriſte, by the holy goſt, I knowe theſe .iii. perſons to be the onely one God, the moſt hygh goodnes hauynge his beinge of him ſelf and all other creatures to haue their being, lyfe, and mouynge of hym, euen that one alone my very lyuynge God for me and for all ſufficient, mercyful, benygne louyng, almyghty to me, my delyuerer, defender, and keper, longe ſuffring, iuſt, true, my preſente ſauyoure and forgeuer of my ſynnes, gyuynge me frelye for Chriſtes ſake eternall lyfe and beatitude. In this knoweledge of my celeſtial father am I fermly perſuaded, Chriſt Ieſu his onelye ſonne both god and mā to be ſente for my ſake into this worlde to be the annoynted Meſſyas, kynge and preiſte, to be my gouerner, delyuerer, auenger, defender, my heade, redemer by hys paſſyon, medyatoure, my clenſinge ſacrifyce, once for me and for all faythfull for euer offred vp on the croſſe, my onelye interceſſoure nowe into heuen aſcended, my holynes, myne expiacion, my rightwiſenes, helth, way lyfe, and ſatyſfaccyon ſatiſfyinge my fathers iuſtice for my ſinnes neuer to be imputed to me for my onelye faythes ſake daylye iuſtifienge and abſoluinge me, contynuallye reuyuynge me wyth his holy ſpyryte, anoyntyng me wyth

the grace of the holye gooſte: ſo that nowe I by hys mercye and grace being in chriſte his electe, might walke dayly in good workes, pleaſynge my celeſtiall father vnto this knowledge and beleef, he calleth all his choſen for whome he hath forſeene, predeſtined, and choſen, them hath he called by his worde and creacyon of this world, vnto this faith and knoweledge, and whome he thus called, the ſame hathe he iuſtyfyed, and whome he hath iuſtyfyed, them hath he glorified.

                IN the proceſſe of your iuſtification fyrſt ye ſay ſaint Paule ſayth, we be choſen of God in Chryſte, before the foundacyon of the worlde was layde, whyche be the wordes of the appoſtle. And here ye make a true entrye, Then ye ſaye that in the fyrſt chapter of ſaynt Iohn̄s goſpell, and the fyrſt epyſtle the fyfte chapter of ſaynte Iohn̄, it is conteyned, that when we be borne anewe of the ſpyryte we are called to receyue

faith. If you can iuſtifie this to be true I wyll not further impugne youre iuſtification, But your allegation of this ſcripture, is lyke the ſpellynge of a yonge ſtrypelynge, I ones went about to teach to reade, He wolde neades ſpell backewarde, (A.b.) he ſpelled it Ba. and (B.A.) Ab. The ſcripture ye allege, ſaith. He that beleueth is borne of god, &amp; ye ſay, we be borne of god to receiue beleefe. Scripture placeth fayth in ordre before the byrthe, not in prioritye of tyme, but in natural order. And ye place it after, as it were alſo in the diſtaunce of tyme. The wordes of the ſcrypture in the goſpell of ſaynte Iohn̄ be, that ſo manye as receyue Chryſte haue power gyuen them, to be the ſonnes of god ſuche as beleue in his name, who be not borne of the bloodes, nor the wyll of man, but be borne of

god. By this texte, to be the ſonne of god, faith muſte neades go before. The wordes of the epyſtle be theſe. Euerye man that beleuethe that Ieſus is Chriſte, is borne of god, Is not faith placed here, in ye order of the text, before the birth, as a declaration whereby to know what is ſignified by this to be borne of god, that is to ſaye, to beleue that Ieſus is chriſt? Not to beleue in tongue, as ſaynt Iohn̄ ſayth, but to beleue in workinge that is beleued: Chriſte teachinge Nichodemus oure regeneration &amp; ſeconde natiuitie of god ſayeth: Niſi quis renatus fuerit ex aqua &amp; ſpiritu ſancto, non poteſt introire in regnum dei, Whiche natiuitie is miniſtred in the ſacrament of baptiſme, And in thactes of thappoſtles, when the Enuche deſired to be partaker of this regeneration &amp; to be borne of god and ſayde,

Here is water what letteth me to be baptiſed? Phillyppe ſayde to the Enuche, If thou beleueſt with all thy hart thou maieſt. And thenuche aunſwered, I beleue Ieſus Chriſte to be the ſonne of god. And ſo was thenuche baptiſed, whiche forme of baptiſme the church obſerueth ſtyl, in ye chriſteninge of Infants offred to chriſt in the fayth catholique &amp; of their parentes. And accordinge to this declaration the wordes of ſaynt Iohn̄s epiſtle be that eche man who beleueth yt Ieſus is Chriſt, is borne of god not excludinge the ſacrament of baptiſme, but declaringe, that the foundacion of our regeneracion, is this fayth, where ſaynt Iohn̄ in a fewe wordes reuerentlye foldeth vp the hole miſterye of oure fayth. By your interpretacion, ye wold haue men firſte borne the chyldren o

But Philyp expoundeth it, that we receiue fayth to be borne the childrē of god, &amp; therfore requireth it before the regeneracion, &amp; ſemblable in other matters, ſcripture preacheth penaunce to obteine remiſſiō of ſinne, and ye teache remiſſion of ſinne wherby to come to penaunce. Scripture ſaith, &amp; we do not forgiue our neighbour, god will not forgiue vs. You teach yt god muſt fyrſte forgiue vs, &amp; then we to forgiue our neighbour. Chriſt calleth vs to him to be vnburdened of our ſynne, And ye teach that we be vnburdened of our ſynne or we come at him. And ſo throughly ye teach chriſt backward: Scripture neuer taught him after that ſort, &amp; yet ye call vpon other for ſcripture, and then ye wyll haue ſcripture playne as it is written, to be vnderſtāded ſtreight of al men at the fyrſt readynge,

whiche bearyng in hande of playnnes, with a deſyre that mans curiouſe nature hathe to knowledge, or for wante therof to be ſeen to haue knowlege, the nū

And yf ſuche one can ſay, onely fayth iuſtifieth, and a prieſte is a knaue, the maſſe is not in ſcripture, and an Image is an idole, ye prayſe ſo much the lorde in hym, and reioyſe ſo muche as in a proſelite, that ye make hym runne, through the ſcripture, in thicke and thinne euen tyll he commeth to predeſtination, and further to gods prouidence, that ſome be ſo blynded at ye laſt, as they call al in doubte.

and body. Let vs returne agayn to ye ſcripture ye haue brought in, which (ye ſay) ſignifieth, that whē we be borne a new of the ſpirit, we be called to receyue faith, The wordes of the ſcripture be.

                bycauſe (natus eſt) is written in the preterperfitence, and (credit) is writen in the preſentence, and thervpon fanſy, that (natus eſt) muſt be before (credit) I muſt aunſwer you agayn by grāmer, that the preterperfitens, in laten ſignifieth the preſentens as wel as the pretertēs, for philophers affirme, by reaſon of the cōtinuall mouing &amp; that tyme euer paſſeth, nothing is properly preſēt, but only god And for declaraciō that the pretertence, ſignifieth ye preſēt, euery verbe paſſiue and deponēte, boroweth

in his preterperfittens, of the verbe ſubſtantiue, to ioyne with his participle, both (eſt) and (fuit) ſo as (natus eſt) is properly, the preſent perfittens and (natus fuit) the preterperfittens. Now if the tranſlation had been (natus fuit) then the grammer wold ſomwhat haue holpe, to wrangle with al, And I wold then, haue reſorted only, to the declaracion of Philippe to the Enuche, which Philip was no papiſte, nor lawer: as I wolde haue reſorted alſo, to chriſtes wordes, Qui crediderit, &amp; baptizatus fuerit, which placeth faith, before baptiſme the ſacrament of byrth of the ſpirite, as ye ſpeake, in newe englyſſh, and of the holly gooſt as the olde engliſſhe turned it, and of god, as the ſcripture by you broughte in ſpeakethe it, And I doubte not but Chriſt thoughte in theſe wordes, euen as he ſpake,

bycauſe ye meddle with chriſtes thoughtes, and accordynge thereunto, with the ſame ordre inſtructed Philippe to baptiſe thenuche. And yet ones againe to your ſcripture, yt alloweth not your reporte, of it. The ſcripture is, Euerye man that beleueth Ieſus is chryſte, is borne of god. This hath the ſame ſence that ſaint Paule ſpake, in other wordes. No man can ſay or ſpeake our lorde Ieſu chriſte, but in the holly ghoſt, when ſaint Peter alſo confeſſed chriſt, to be the ſonne of god. Chriſte ſaide, that fleſſhe and bloude, had not reueled that vnto him, but his father, that is in heauen. And ſo in this place, Euerye man that beleueth Ieſus to be chriſt, hath yt beleue of god, which hauing of god, is ſpokē in the termes of byrth of god. He is borne of god, to ſignifie the ſacramēt of baptiſme, wherin we be regenerate

of water and the holy ghoſt after chriſtes teachinge, whome God badde vs heare, and therewith beware of you, that teache chriſte not as ye haue learned in ſcripture, but after your owne ymaginations.

As in this text, when ye reade, he that beleueth Ieſus is Chryſte is borne of god, ye cauſe the rude man to note fyrſte a byrthe of god, and then a beleuynge and ſomewhat lyke therevnto, We in common ſpeache ſaye, (he that foloweth me, is my ſeruaunte).

And when the vnlearned, by you be ledde into this errour, then the pryde of a preſumptuouſe knoweledge makethe them obſtinatelye to defende it, and call all other knoweledge, whereby they ſhoulde be rydde of theyr erroure, iugglynge and ſophiſtrye, mannes inuentions, and ſuche other peuyſſhe wordes, as men be encombred to heare, onleſſe they wolde make gods worde, the matter of the deuylles ſtryfe. Thinke me not tediouſe (good reader) that I tarye, in this matter, to open and ſhewe, howe one faſhyon of ſpeache in englyſſhe, receyueth diuerſe

interpretacion, by reaſon of the ordre of the matter, that is knytte togither. For when I ſaye (he that foloweth me is my ſeruaunt) the ſpeache importeth that he was my ſeruaunt before he folowed me. But in an other matter knytte in the ſame faſſhyon of ſpeache when I ſaye (he that couenaunteth to ſerue me is my ſeruaunt) this ſpeach ſignifieth not, that he was before my ſeruaunte, and then couenaūted, but that by this couenaunt, he is made nowe my ſeruaunt, and was not before. In the other ſpeache, he was my ſeruaunte, or he folowed me, and in this laſte ſpeache, we muſt vnderſtande, that he dydde couenaunte, or he were my ſeruaunte. And what reaſon of dyuerſitie in theſe two? Marye in the fyrſte ſpeache, I ioyne that is oute of all kinde of cauſes, to theffecte, as

to folowe me is no cauſe to be my ſeruaunte, but rather enſueth of ſeruyce. But in the ſeconde I ioyne a kynde of cauſe with the effecte, And then I maye not ſaye the effecte was before the cauſe, and therefore in aſmuche as a couenaunt, is of the kind of cauſes, to make hym my ſeruaunte: I maye not by the lyke faſſhion of ſpeache deceaue my ſelfe, and ſay, bycauſe in the one ſpeache, it was not true, where I ſayde (he that folowethe me is my ſeruaunte) that he was my ſeruaunte, before he folowed me: I muſte therefore in this ſpeache (he that couenaunteth to ſerue me, is my ſeruaunte) ſaye alſo, that he was my ſeruaunte, before he couenaunted with me. Nowe bycauſe in the ſpeache of ſcrypture, whiche is. Eche man yt beleueth Ieſus to be chriſt, is borne of god, there is ioyned,

of the kinde of cauſes, that is to ſaye (to beleue) with the effecte, whyche is, to be borne of god, I may not ſaye we be borne of god, or we beleue, but that we beleue, or we be borne of god. And this reſembleth that englyſhe ſpeache, before declared. He that couenaū
               teth to ſerue me is my ſeruaunte, But if the ſcripture were thus, He that ſhalbe ſaued, is borne of god, the vnderſtandynge muſte needes be, that we be borne of god or we be ſaued. For this is like the other ſpeache in englyſſhe, (he that foloweth me is my ſeruaunt) whiche implieth that he was my ſeruaunt or he folowed me, whiche diuerſe conſideration arriſeth vppon the diuerſitie of placynge theffecte before the cauſe, or the cauſe before the effecte. And he that dothe not marke this maye eaſelye ſaye, an horſemyll, for a mylhorſe, and in

the myſtakynge of the ſence of the ſcryptures, all hereſyes be grounded, &amp; they that be in that darkenes, ſubuerted in theyr iudgement can not abyde the lyghte of the truthe, and meanes to dyſcerne it, but be learned to abhorre, that ſhoulde cleare the matter, and call their darkenes, lyght, and the verye lyght, darkenes. But (good reader) conſydre agayne and againe, what Ioye gathereth of the ſcrypture, howe vntruelye he gathereth it, and by what ſleyght he conueieth it, into the heades of the ignoraunte, that take hym for a greate mayſter. He ſayeth, we be borne of god, and ſo called to receyue beleefe, where in deede we be called to receiue belefe, wherwith, but not with it alone, but with it as foundacion to be borne of god, For he that is borne of god, we ſhall not ſaye, he is called to receyue

faith, but in his byrthe of god, hath receyued it all readye, wythoute whyche, he is not borne of God. For fide purificat deus corda

                  , as ſaynte Paule ſaith, and yet you wolde teache, that mens hartes were purified by byrth in god or they receyued faith. For if a mā, be borne of god, olde Adam, is caſt away, ye weight of ſynne is vnladen, mans ſtate is recreate and renued. Et quod natum eſt ex ſpiritu, ſpiritus eſt, and yet by you man is broughte to this ſtate, or he knoweth god, for hitherto he is but called to receiue faith, by your teachinge, whereby he commeth to lyght of knowledge, if we will giue credit vnto you, who declare your ſelf herein, a maiſter of errour, perniciouſlye to ſeduce the people, from the true teaching of the catholique church vſynge the ſcriptures, as boyes

do in grammer ſcoole. Quid eſt latinum propter, for their excuſe, and then iangle after in englyſſh, as longe as they lyſte. Ye crye ſcripture, ſcripture, and in deade ſpeake nothinge but the idole of your owne imaginacion. And bycauſe you haue ſo peruerſlye and vntruly recited the ſenſe of the ſcripture. Io. i. and .i. Io. v. as I haue declared, &amp; yet ye make that vntruthe for a pryncypall parte of youre matter to declare youre iuſtyficatyon, and incontínentlye after a truth, chop in a lye: I wyll not paſſe it ouer, but here make a ſtaye, &amp; deſire the reader, to marke that here ye go oute of the highewaye of the truth, and therfore, in that ye foloweth, breake vp hedges and leape ouer diches, trauailing, in a roughe and an vnleueled matter, for want of the playnnes and ſmothenes of the truth. How

ſtandeth it I pray you together, yu a man is borne of god, to be called to faythe, and yet hathe forgyuenes of ſynne imputed vnto hym, for only faythes ſake? ſeing the byrth of god implyeth forgiuenes of ſynne, which byrth, ye ſaye is wrought before faith receyued: Note this (reader) I pray the, and alſo this that he ſaith, ſinnes be not imputed, for onelye faithes ſake, Are ye come to this nowe, to encourage your beleuers, that only faith, hath worthynes, for the owne ſake, to obteyne remiſſion of ſynnes? It is an other matter to ſay, by belefe onlye, men obtayne remiſſion of ſynne, as your ſecte ſayeth, then to ſpeake as you do, for onelye faithes ſake, after whiche ſorte, they neyther ſpake ne ment, that put meritum de congruo, et de condigno, whiche ye wyll ieſt at although ye vnderſtande

it not, and ſo muche the ſoner, bycauſe ye knowe not what it meaneth. Chryſt (by you) deuydeth his glorye in remyſſyon of ſynne, with beleuers, ſo as belefe for the owne ſake, ſhall obteine remyſſion of ſynne, but workers be abiected, ne charitie ſhal chalenge any ſuche prerogatiue. What ſo euer ye lyke to ſay, there is nether faithe ne workes, hathe anye ſuch reſpecte of only ſake, as ye ſpeake it, but onely chriſte, for whoſe onelye ſake, our faith, our charitie, beynge gyuen vnto vs of god, be accepted and rewarded, by the goodnes of god. And ſo heare I note that lyke a ſhyppe without anker holde or rother, ye wander as the variable wynde toſſeth you, and ſo make yawes in and oute, withoute anye ryghte courſe, which no man can kepe beinge ſwarued frō the truthe. Nowe this I wolde

knowe of you, where is your ſcripture to proue that faith certifieth eche man of his election, and ſo declareth and openeth vnto hym, the boke of predeſtinacion that eche man by faith myghte ſaye, In capite libri ſcriptum eſt de me, The knoweledge of ſcripture aſſureth and certifieth eche man, ye couetous mē glottons, fornicatours, and ſuche as fall from that truth they haue receyued, ſhalbe damned.

God ſheweth muche to his familiars, ſuche as haue by his ſingler plenteous giftes, and their hole endeuour, of their hart and mind, with a feruent deſire, to be continually with chriſt, hauynge their conuerſacion, in heauen, and not vpon the earth, to ſuche god hath reueled as hath pleaſed hym, where vpon they haue of thē ſelf (taught by the holly good) ſpoken, as by ſpeciall reuelatiō hath ben ſhewed them of their aſſuraunce, as ſaynt Paule ſayde, Certus ſum, and certaine other martires. But lette vs be contente with goddes generall reuelation in ſcripture, and beynge expedient for vs, by feare

of fallynge to encreace our ſtudy▪ to exerciſe goddes giftes, applye oure ſelfe to do as is ordered, and commaunded withoute curioſitie to ſearche that aſſuraūce ye ſpeake of, whiche is frutefullye hydden from vs, In whiche matter the Germaines fyrſt authors of the dreame of ſuche aſſuraunce and mooſt certayne certaynte by faith haue in their agrement at the diet of Ratiſbone yelded in that fondnes, and graūt that godly men beynge in fayth be troubled with the doubt of their aſtate.

But god, he commendeth his loue towarde vs, in that when we were ſynners chriſt wolde dye for vs, muche more therefore nowe we beinge iuſtified in his bloude, ſhall be preſerued by hym from wrath. What faithfull herte towched with this incomparable loue out of fayth &amp; knoweledge, is not humbled with feare and confeſſion of his ſynnes to god, and is not heuye and repentaunte deteſting his ſynnes, ſaieng? Shall I any more commyt that thinge whiche hath broughte this my ſo louynge a ſauyour to ſo ſhamefull and paynefull a paſſion. This is oure faith which cleaueth to the mooſte certayne promyſe of god, and not to Wynch. waueryng vnſtable condicion. This is our faith and ſubſtaunciall certitude the moſt ferme perſuaſion, without any wauerynge, of the merciable free forgeuenes and gracyous abſolucyon of oure

ſinnes by the promyſe of our father celeſtial in chriſtes bloud: &amp; hath her own proper correlatiue the promyſe of god euer correſpondent, and not Win. knowledge of the fulfillynge of his condiciō. This is the forme of oure iuſtification by fayth onely whiche attributeth all glorye to god as dyd Abraham and his chylderne and as many as haue vnfaynedly receyued chriſtes goſpell. But let Wyn. worke on ſtyll his wycked workes vnto thattaynement of his phariſaicall iuſtification before men vntyll the axe nowe bent vnto his rotis, he be ſodenly ſmiten downe of god. For Paſſur muſt be turned (as Ieremy ſayth) into Pauor, his arrogant vpclymyng &amp; extollynge of him ſelfe aboue god muſt haue a ſhamefull ſoden fearfull fall. Theſe arrogant articles, maye be well called the falſe articles of Wincheſters falſe faith, and not of chriſts faith. For Chriſt confirmed his articles euermore with the law and prophetes, but Win. bringeth not one worde of god for him to proue his. Wherfore let them be his owne articles armed wyth his owne proud autoritie. For we may not beleue hym thus exaltynge hym ſelfe aboue Chriſte whiche euer alleged the ſcryptures for his doctrine to be confyrmed, we may not beleue my Lorde vicare generall

for his high lordely ſupercilious phariſaicall lookes. Wherefore if this Gardiner will ſeme to be learned, lette him aunſwer now with goddes worde and not diſpute with poore men in his fetters and preſons with his fumiſſhe threates, fyery fagottes, preſonyng and perſecutyng the pore innocent membres of chriſt for weldoinge, purely, frelye, &amp; faithfullye preachinge goddes worde, caſtinge of his blodhoundes into euery citie and towne to hunt out the chriſten ſimple ſely flocke of chriſt, as he of late made Wyllyam Caſtelyn Gouerner of the marchaunt aduenteres at Anwerpe cheiflye to hunt out ſuch as purely and frely write and ſet forth bookes vnto the glory of god edifienge of chriſtes churche, and to warne men of Wynch. falſe doctrine. For this Gouerner of other men, whiche coulde neuer wel gouerne hym ſelfe, is more mete to rowe in a galey, or to holde the plough, then to gouerne ſo worſhiple and honeſte a company. But the lorde is a lyue and heareth of theſe Moabites pride and blode thirſtinge, he ſeeth their ſecrete wiked counſels and heareth their boſtinge proude crakes, their ſupercilyous arrogancy is well knowne vnto me ſayth the Lorde: but yet for all their luciferine pride, promotyng and extolling

them ſelues and one an other to ſerue their traitourouſe turnes and mutuall miſcheif, yet ſhall they neuer bringe about their wicked enforcementes. For it is God that depoſeth ſuch myghtye miſcheuouſe from their ſeates and exalteth the humble. It is the lorde that ſkatereth their wiked counſels &amp; trappeth them in theyr owne pride &amp; blodye cogitacions. But let all chriſten kinges and Prynces beware howe they geue their ſwerde into ſuche popiſſhe prelates handes leſt the innocent bloude be-required of god at their handes, to whome be praiſe for euer. Amen.
            
            
               Truth it is, that he whiche knoweth nether the father nor chriſt ſhall neuer beleue Chriſt to be an hole perfyt and ſufficient ſauyour and forgeuer of ſynnes, but he ſhall wynde in this croked condicion of Wyn. and deuyde his iuſtificacion part (if he geue not all) to workes, and part to god, as did the Iewes and nowe the Turkes and ſuche like heithen miſcreauntes whiche neuer knew god the father in, &amp; by chriſt. yea they ſhall deuyſe and imagyn in their own opinions (for true faith haue they none) ſuch workes for goddes honour as thē ſelues thinke to make moſt for a great kynges honour, as to be accompanied with many men, &amp; fetched in

with many torches &amp; candels at none daye lyghted to hym whiche is the very lyght it ſelfe. Theſe blinde worſhippers wyll make god an image thereby to worſhip him, whiche idollatrye the ſeconde commaundement vtterlye forbyddeth. They wyll worſhyp him with golde perle, precious ſtones, veluete clothe of golde. &amp;c. They ſence ſynge &amp; rynge hym in with belles as they were wont to do the biſhops. They pipe hym vp with orgaynes, &amp; all the coſtly pleaſaunt externe rites and ceremonies (as ſencinge proceſſions) that can be deuyſed for to pleaſe great men: they vſe the ſame to worſhyppe god withall, when Chriſt ſayde God my father is a ſpirite and in ſpirite and truth wyl he be worſhipped▪ yea theſe wordly wicked blind Biſſhops are ſo farre caſte away &amp; for their wickednes turned vp of god into their owne hertes luſtes, and into a reprobate dampned mynde that they know not god fro man mortal. Oh good god what mynde may this be. Verelye Paule expreſſeth it and the cauſe whye god worthelye thus caſteth them vp, ſayenge. What ſo euer men oughte to know of god, the ſame hath god ſhewed them, as his almyghtye power &amp; godbeade: yea &amp; that by the creacion &amp; creatures of the worlde if they wolde diligently

and humblye loke vpon and expend them, ſo that they be without any excuſe of anye ignoraunce. But when god had geuen Wynche. this knoweledge of hym, then yet he worſhypped nor glorified hym not as god, but as he wolde worſhyppe anye other worldlye prince with outwarde rites and ceremonies, neither doth he geue him thankes, but ſheweth his owne vaine curioſite and curiouſe vanite in his owne reaſonynge and diſputinge for goddes mooſt glorious honour, in ſo much that he hath nowe blindened his owne ignorant herte, and wherein he thought to haue done mooſt wiſely for gods worſhyp and glorye, there doth he mooſte folyſhlye and cruellye, ſhewynge hym ſelfe a very foole (as Paule ſaith) turnynge vp the worſhyppe of god incorruptible through his owne imaginacions to worſhyppe hym after his owne fonde deuiſes. And for this cauſe hath god thus caſt him vp through his owne hertes luſtes into al maner prodigious and beaſtlye fylthynes receiuinge into hym ſelfe the worthye rewarde of his owne erroure. And forbicauſe (ſayeth Paule) he doth ſette at naughte ſo preſente knoweledge of god nowe opened vnto hym and to all other that wyll embrace chriſt and his word, therefore

doth God turne him vp into this deteſtable opinion of his owne falſe iuſtification &amp; into ſo lothelye and abhominable reprobate bloudye mynde, that in priſoninge, perſecuting, fagottyng, burnynge, and ſlayeng the true profeſſours and preachers of goddes holy word, he ſhall (as Chriſt ſayth) ſeme to hym ſelf and ſuche lyke, to do god high worſhyp and by the fulfillynge of ſuche wyked workes euen his owne condicion, to attayne to his owne iuſtificacion before the deuyll the prince of this world, his antechriſten Pope of Rome, Cardinals, preiſtes. &amp;c. whoſe vicare generall worthely and iuſtly he yet playeth vp and downe. And all this (ſaith Chriſt) ſhall this vicare generall do to you becauſe he knoweth nether my father nor me. This is that reprobate mynd into whiche this Gardener is nowe turned vp of god whiche dampned mynde he declareth ſayenge. Woo be to them that ſaye that thinge to be euyll which they knowe to be good, and that to be good which they know to be euyl. The lorde preſerue his chirche from ſuche a vicare generall. Chriſte kepe euery Dioceſe from ſuche a Byſſhop. The holye Goſte teache al chriſten Prynces to beware of ſuche a counſeller.
            
            
               So be it.
            
            
               
               
                  Vvinton̄ 
                WHen ye haue iumbled vp the matter, with a meany of wordes (as it were) put in a ſacke, truthes and vntruthes togyther: Nowe ye ſay that out of iuſtificacion, ſpryngeth repentaunce, For here the ſynner prayeth God to conuerte hym, ſayenge with Ieremye. Lorde conuerte me, and I ſhall be conuerted, for thou lorde arte my god, and anone as thou ſhalt conuerte me, I ſhall ſmyte my hande vppon my hyppe. Hereuppon ye aſke me who is thauthor of repentaunce? And ye aſke me as though I had not playnelye ſayd in that ye call my laſt article, that man may haue grace of god, to doo the workes of penaunce, whereby to atteyne iuſtificacion. The ſcrypture of Ieremie confirmeth that a ſynner is called to penaunce, and conuerted by goddes grace, but the variaunce betwene

you and me is, whether it be before iuſtificacyō or no? and to that purpoſe, for your parte, ye brynge in no ſcripture, but onely your by talke, after ye haue named ſcripture, &amp; occupied the ſymple mans witte, with a ſtraunge phraſe of the prophette. I ſhall ſtryke my hande vppon my hyppe. And whyles the vnlearned man thinketh of that, he forgetteth the iſſue of the mater, and calleth you a noble clerke, beynge ſo full of ſcripture, as ye could talke of it from morne to nyghte, &amp; nede were, and thynketh I were ſuche one, as ye do paynt me. But to the matter you ſaye, faythe iuſtyfyenge bryngethe forthe penaunce, and afore ye haue tolde, that faythe iuſtyfyenge for the owne ſake, obteynethe remyſſyon of ſynne▪ So ye teache that after remiſſion of ſynne, ſpringeth penaūce, whiche your teachyng, the

hole trade of the ſcripture, in the newe teſtamente impugneth and condemneth. For as ſaynte Iohn̄ came before chriſte, ſo penaunce goeth before remiſſion of ſynne,Penaunce goeth befor
                     •
                   remyſſion o
                     •
                   ſynne. Saynte Paule ſayeth. Iohannes baptizabat, baptiſmo penitentiae, dicens in eum qui uenturus eſset. And Chryſte ſayde. Iohannes baptizauit aqua, uos autem baptizabimini ſpiritu ſancto. Saynte Peter taughte after this ſorte, when ſuche as harde hym preache, were moued and aſked what they ſhoulde do? Do penaunce (ſayeth he) and be eche of you baptiſed in the name of Ieſu Chriſte, to obteyne remyſſyon of ſynne. When Chryſte expounded the ſcriptures, in the myddes of his diſcyples, after his reſurrectyon, he ſayde it was behouefull, chriſte ſhuld ſuffer and riſe frō death the thyrde daye, and to be preached in

his name, penaunce and remiſſion of ſinne for all people. S. Peter alſo preacheth thus, Do penaunce and turne, that your ſynnes maye be taken awaye. The prophet Ezechiell ſpeaketh after this ſorte, If a wycked man doth penaunce. And you applye penaunce onelye to them that be iuſtified. In all theſe places, no man hath ben ſo madde to ſaye that a ſynner, that is ſo blynded with ſinne, as he can not ſee god, can of him ſelfe, turne as he ſhulde do, to god frutefully without the lyghte and grace of god. Who can wake out of ſinne, without god call him and ſaith. Exurge qui dormis. Ryſe vp that ſlepeſt, And onles god hath giuen him eares, to heare this voyce of god, ſayenge: Surge &amp; illuminare Ieruſalem. Howe is any man beynge lame with ſinne, able to take vp his couche and walke, onleſſe

god ſayth. Tolle grabatum tuum &amp; ambula? Chriſte ſaide he came not to call men that boſted theyr iuſtice, but to call ſynners to penaunce. That god calleth man, for chriſtes ſake, who by his glorious paſſion, hath merited fully the reconciliacion of man, no man contendeth, and that god doth miniſtre ſpeciall grace, and helpe man to turne to god from ſynne, it is agreed on with you. Moreouer that mā can not knowe god, but by faith, all muſt agree, and that it is impoſſible, to pleaſe god without faith, and that who commeth to god, muſte haue faith.The poynte of variance in teachynge of penaunce Hitherto we agree, but herein ye only differre from the fayth catholique, and catholyque teachynge, that ye wyll haue man iuſtified, with remiſſion of ſynne, ſtreight incontinently afore his faith be any thynge warmed, with ſuche

an vnderſtandynge, as though remiſſion of ſynne, ſhuld go before penaunce, contrarye to the ordre of true doctrine. And all this wranglyng on your behallfe is, bicauſe ye wolde not alowe▪ any good worke, before remiſſion of ſynne. And ye are fayne to turne all the ſcripture vpſidowne, for the mayntenaunce of it. And when al is done it will not be. We be taught to pray for forgiuenes of our ſynnes, And by your doctrine, we be forgiuē, or we begynne to praye, ſeynge without faith iuſtifienge (as ye ſaye) I can not worthely praye. I pray god, ſend you a better mynd, truely inſtructed with his doctrine, and grace to turne to him, from the vayne glory of the world, wherin ye reigne, &amp; with the tyrannye of your tongue, perſecute other mens name and fame, moſt cruelly, with a

counterfet forged ſworde, of authorite, vnder pretenſe of gods worde, wherewith ye take vpon you, to be cōptrollers of ye worlde: Al ſuche armour of witte, lernyng and vnderſtanding, as god hath gyuen you, to help, to maintayne the ſemely ſtate of Chriſten religion, to thincreace of gods honour, loue, quiet and tranquillite, amonges vs: ye conuert all, to the confuſion of it, &amp; handle the matter ſo, as though god had nede of your lyes, as Iob ſaith. Nunquid eget deus mēdatio, ut loquamini pro eo dolos? Fynde you anye example in the prophetes or the appoſtles, that they wolde ſclaunder men wittynglye, for auauncement of their purpoſe? As for my ſelfe, I haue vſed your enemite ſo, as I haue greate good by it, I thanke almyghtye God, Ye haue ben to me, occaſion of ſtudye and dilygence,

to ſpend ſuch houres as I myght haue at libertie, to thincreace of knowlege, yt I might be ye abler, to maintayne ſuch truthe, as I haue lerned, in gods ſcriptures, wherin percace I ſhulde elles haue ben more negligent. And althoughe I haue facioned, my ſelf outwardly, in the world, not to cōtente your eyes, but haue, ſhewed my ſelf not diſmaied, with your controlementes, yet I confeſſe, I haue by your occaſion, at ſome time called for grace, to refrayne worldly tentacions, Your cauſe, I iudge extremely nought, to thextinction of goddes honour and ſubuerſion of the worlde, and therfore the more ye miſlyke me, and the wurſe ye ſpeake of me, the more cauſe haue I to thanke god, to ſuffer ſo eaſely for his ſake, as your malyce and enuye, ſhuld engendre me an honeſt reputacion in

the world in honeſt mens hartes, to be noted aduerſary to you. And as I lerne, in the ſcriptures, and ſuche holy men, as haue expounded them, whereby to iudge your enterpriſe abhominable: So the malicious rayling of you; that be the maiſters, and the ſpitefull hatred without cauſe, of them that be your ſcolers, daily more and more confermeth vnto me, the deteſtable noughtynes of that ye intend. The falſehed ye teache, in the vnderſtandynge of ſcriptures, corrupteth all other truthes, in you, and tranſformeth them into lyes. Your learning can not be of god, that preache ſo lyke the deuyll. How ſo euer ye diffame me of crueltie, I knowe it is not my faulte, and yet I am a ſynner, and haue many other faultes. I neuer enterpriſed, to defende the truth, but in my place of ordre, where the

kynges mooſt excellent maieſtie hath placed me, farre aboue my deſerte and expectation. You triumphe out of your place, &amp; make your ſelf, high iudge of ye realme, whereunto god hathe not called you. Can ye fynd in your hart, to do ſo much iniury to ye kinges maieſty as to thinke, the ſtate of this realme, to be directed, not by his high wiſdom, to whom god hath cōmytted it, but as I &amp; ſuch other for our purpoſe (as ye note) wolde haue it gouerned? And if ye thinke therin otherwiſe then ye ſaye, (as for the mutual intelligence, in the fraternite, ye can not in your abſence, but knowe, howe publique thinges go) is this the charitable diuiſe in the brotherhed, to choſe out me for a raylynge ſtocke, and in ieſtinge at your pleaſure of me, brynge to the kynges maieſtees

knowledge, that ye wold he ſhuld here ſpoken of you? Suppoſe ye, the kinges maieſtie, can not vnderſtand, what ye meane by Wincheſter? when ye attribute all the faſhion of the ſtate of the realme, to Wyncheſter? call the actes that myſlyke you Wyncheſters? all ſtatutes Wyncheſters? all iuſt puniſhmentes (howe ſo euer ye cal them) Wincheſters? and charge al vpon Wyncheſter, that in ſo doynge ye name Wincheſter, not for Wyncheſter, but vſe the name of Wyn. in ſtede of that ye dare not name and ſpeake oute. Ye abuſe herein to muche, the kynges maieſties mooſt excellent giftes, &amp; I am aſhamed, that any part of his maieſtees glorye, in defenſe of religion frō your corruption, ſhulde be deriued vnto me, by any meane who haue deſerued no part of it. And ſo ſhall it appeare in thende,

howe ſoeuer ye ſclaunder it, in the meane ſeaſon. I wyll no further aunſwer to your raylinges in the concluſion of your boke, but exhorte you, to call for grace, that ye maye turne, as Ieremie ſaith, and clappe your ſelfe on the hyppe, &amp; remembre with repentaunce, how many mens conſciences, ye haue perplexed, with your controuerſie in religion, and labour as ye can, to refourme what ye may. Ye haue ſcourged vs ſharpely with youre owne torment in the meane ſeaſō. If I delited in your puniſhmente (as ye wolde it were perſuaded of me) I coulde not wyſſhe you a more myſerable ſtate then thus, to here you rore and crye oute lyke beaſtes, &amp; by exceſſe of malyce, to ſpeake ye wote not what, Priſon &amp; bodelye death be not eſtemed of al men alyke, and ye haue vſed them for a tyme, as falſe wytnes, to conferme

youre falſehod for truthe, with ſclaunder of the iuſte mynyſters therof, Nowe that hath for a whyle ceaſed and ye by lurkinge, be at libertie in talke, ye haue ſo diſgorged your abhominacion, yt laye hydden in your breſte, as no man lenger nede doubte what ye be. We coulde neuer get ſo muche by examinacion, as ye confeſſe in bookes and profeſſe. Ye ſhulde by iuſtice haue died, with opinion of ſymplycite, amonge ſome, &amp; nowe ye lyue with a manifeſt declaracion what ye haue euer ment and intended. Ye ſette your ſelfe in pryſon of an encombred conſcience, &amp; dye dayly, yet liuing, in proſecutynge youre miſcheuouſe enterpriſe. But returne you vnto God, returne to youre ſoueraine lordes obeyſaunce, returne to be a good chriſten man, and an engliſh man. For what ſo euer our faultie workes

haue ben, they nothing ſerue to the iuſtificacion of youre doctryne. Let vs all praye together, for mercye, mercye, mercye, nowe mooſte neceſſarye vnto vs. The name and workes of god, haue ben ſo familiar in our talke, that the reuerent feare of his maieſtie is almoſt extinct amonges many. Vnhappy be we, in whoſe tyme learnynge ſhulde be miniſtred, to ſuche effectes. God graunte vs to knowe hym truely and according to his wyll, ſo to worſhyp and honoure him, in bodye and ſoule togither, as all contencions, debates, malice and hatred, clearely extirpate and pulled out, we maye lyue here lyke chriſten men, with chriſten men, and englyſhe men, with engliſh men, which of a good ſeaſon, hath ben by diſſention of opinions, ſomwhat letted and hindred, whereof thoſe haue mooſte

cauſe to be ſory, to whom any part of the faulte may be aſcribed, And yet all muſt be ſorye, for that is amyſſe, &amp; eche man for his part, begyn to amende, &amp; with the prayer of the churche, continually praye, Deus qui errantibus, ut in uiam ueritatis poſſint redire, ueritatis tuae lumen oſtendis, da cunctis qui profeſſione chriſtiana cenſentur, illa reſpuere, quae huic inimica ſunt nomini, &amp; quae ſunt apta ſectari. Per chriſtum dominum noſtrum. Amen.
