            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

            The Translator to the Reader.
            THere is (gentle Reader) nothing (the word of God onely set apart) which so much beautifieth and adorneth the soule and minde of mā, as doth the knowledge of good artes and sciences: as the knowledge of naturall and morall Philosophie. The one setteth before our eyes, the creatures of God, both in the heauens aboue, and in the earth beneath: in which as in a glasse, we beholde the exceding maiestie and wisedome of God, in adorning and beautifying them as we see: in geuing vnto them such wonderfull and manifolde proprieties, and naturall workinges, and that so diuersly and in such varietie: farther in maintaining and conseruing them continually, whereby to praise and adore him, as by S. Paule we are taught. The other teacheth vs rules and preceptes of vertue, how, in common life amongest men, we ought to walke vprightly: what dueties pertaine to our selues, what pertaine to the gouernment or good order both of an housholde, and also of a citie or common wealth. The reading likewise of histories, conduceth not a litle, to the adorning of the soule &amp; minde of man, a studie of all men cōmended: by it are seene and knowen the artes and doinges of infinite wise men gone before vs. In histories are contained infinite examples of heroicall vertues to be of vs followed, and horrible examples of vices to be of vs eschewed. Many other artes also there are which beautifie the minde of man: but of all other none do more garnishe &amp; beautifie it, then those artes which are called Mathematicall. Vnto the knowledge of which no man can attaine, without the perfecte knowledge and instruction of the principles, groundes, and Elementes of Geometrie. But perfectly

to be instructed in them, requireth diligent studie and reading of olde auncient authors. Amongest which, none for a beginner is to be preferred before the most auncient Philosopher Euclide of Megara. For of all others he hath in a true methode and iuste order, gathered together whatsoeuer any before him had of these Elementes written: inuenting also and adding many thinges of his owne: wherby he hath in due forme accomplished the arte: first geuing definitions, principles, &amp; groundes, wherof he deduceth his Propositions or conclusions, in such wonderfull wise, that that which goeth before, is of necessitie required to the proufe of that which followeth. So that without the diligent studie of Euclides Elementes, it is impossible to attaine vnto the perfecte knowledge of Geometrie, and consequently of any of the other Mathematicall sciences. Wherefore considering the want &amp; lacke of such good authors hitherto in our Englishe tounge, lamenting also the negligence, and lacke of zeale to their countrey in those of our nation, to whom God hath geuen both knowledge, &amp; also abilitie to translate into our tounge, and to publishe abroad such good authors, and bookes (the chiefe instrumentes of all learninges): seing moreouer that many good wittes both of gentlemen and of others of all degrees, much desirous and studious of these artes, and seeking for them as much as they can, sparing no paines, and yet frustrate of their intent, by no meanes attaining to that which they seeke: I haue for their sakes, with some charge &amp; great trauaile, faithfully translated into our vulgare toūge, &amp; set abroad in Print, this booke of Euclide. Whereunto I haue added easie and plaine declarations and examples by figures, of the definitions. In which booke also ye shall in due place finde manifolde additions, Scholies, Annotations, and Inuentions: which I haue gathered out of many of the most famous &amp; chiefe Mathematicies, both of old time, and in our age: as by diligent reading it in course, ye shall

well perceaue. The fruite and gaine which I require for these my paines and trauaile, shall be nothing els, but onely that thou gentle reader, will gratefully accept the same: and that thou mayest thereby receaue some profite: and moreouer to excite and stirre vp others learned, to do the like, &amp; to take paines in that behalfe. By meanes wherof, our Englishe tounge shall no lesse be enriched with good Authors, then are other straunge tounges: as the Dutch, French, Italian, and Spanishe: in which are red all good authors in a manner, found amongest the Grekes or Latines. Which is the chiefest cause, that amongest thē do florishe so many cunning and skilfull men, in the inuentions of straunge and wonderfull thinges, as in these our daies we see there do. Which fruite and gaine if I attaine vnto, it shall encourage me hereafter, in such like sort to translate, and set abroad some other good authors, both pertaining to religion (as partly I haue already done) and also pertaining to the Mathematicall Artes. Thus gentle reader farewell.
         
         
            
            
            TO THE VNFAINED LOVERS of truthe, and constant Studentes of Noble Sciences, IOHN DEE of London, hartily wisheth grace from heauen, and most prosperous successe in all their honest attemptes and exercises.
            DIuine Plato, the great Master of many worthy Philosophers, and the constant auoucher, and pithy perswader of Vnum, Bonum, and Ens: in his Schole and Academie, sundry times (besides his ordinary Scholers) was visited of a certaine kinde of men, allured by the noble fame of Plato, and the great commendation of hys profound and profitable doctrine. But when such Hearers, after long harkening to him, perceaued, that the drift of his discourses issued out, to conclude, this Vnum, Bonum, and Ens, to be Spirituall, Infinite, AEternall, Omnipotent, &amp;c. Nothyng beyng alledged or expressed, How, worldly goods: how, worldly dignitie: how, health, Strēgth or Iustines of body: nor yet the meanes, how a merue

                  •
               hem visited. Which thing, his Scholer, Aristotle, narrowly cōsidering, founde the cause therof, to be, For that they had no forwarnyng and information, in generall, whereto his doctrine tended. For, so, might they haue had occasion, either to haue forborne his schole hauntyng: (if they, then, had misliked his Scope and purpose) or constantly to haue continued therin: to their full satisfaction: if such finall scope &amp; intent, had ben to their desire.
Wherfore, Aristotle, euer, after that, vsed in brief, to forewarne his owne Scholers and hearers, both of what matter, and also to what ende, he tooke in hand to speake, or teach. While I consider the diuerse trades of these two excellent Philosophers (and am most sure, both, that Plato right well, otherwise could teach:
and that Aristotle mought boldely, with his hearers, haue dealt in like sorte as Plato did) I am in no little pang of perplexitie: Bycause, that, which I mislike, is most easy for me to performe (and to haue Plato for my exāple.) And that, which I know to be most commendable: and (in this first bringyng, into common handling, the Artes Mathematicall) to be most necessary: is full of great difficultie and sundry daungers. Yet

               Wherfore, seyng I finde great occasion (for the causes alleged, and farder, in respect of my Art Mathematike generall) to vse a certaine forewarnyng and Praeface, whose content shalbe, that mighty, most plesaunt, and frutefull Mathematicall Tree, with his chief armes and second (grifted) braunches:
                     The intent of this Preface.
                   Both, what euery one is, and also, what commodity, in generall, is to be looked for, aswell of griff as stocke: And forasmuch as this enterprise is so great, that, to this our tyme, it neuer was (to my knowledge) by any achieued: And also it is most hard, in these our drery dayes, to such rare and straunge Artes, to wyn due and common credit:
Neuertheles, if, for my sincere endeuour to satisfie your honest expectation, you will but lend me your thākefull mynde a while: and, to such matter as, for this time, my penne (with spede) is hable to deliuer, apply your eye or eare attentifely: perchaunce, at once, and for the first salutyng, this Preface you will finde a lesson long enough. And either you will, for a second (by this) be made much the apter: or shortly become, well hable your selues, of the lyons claw, to coniecture his royall symmetrie, and farder propertie. Now then, gentle, my frendes, and countrey men, Turne your eyes, and bend your myndes to that doctrine, which for our present purpose, my simple talent is hable to yeld you.
            All thinges which are, &amp; haue beyng, are found vnder a triple diuersitie generall.
            For, either, they are demed Supernaturall, Naturall, or, of a third being. Thinges Supernaturall, are immateriall, simple, indiuisible, incorruptible, &amp; vnchangeable. Things Naturall, are materiall, compounded, diuisible, corruptible, and chaungeable. Thinges Supernaturall, are, of the minde onely, comprehended: Things Naturall, of the sense exterior, ar hable to be perceiued. In thinges Naturall, probabilitie and coniecture hath place: But in things Supernaturall, chief demōstration, &amp; most sure Science is to be had. By which properties &amp; comparasons of these two, more easily may be described, the state, condition, nature and property of those thinges, which, we before termed of a third being: which, by a peculier name also, are called Thynges Mathematicall. For, these, beyng (in a maner) middle, betwene thinges supernaturall and naturall: are not so absolute and excellent, as thinges supernatural: Nor yet so base and grosse, as things naturall: But are thinges immateriall: and neuerthelesse, by materiall things hable somewhat to be signified. And though their particular Images, by Art, are agg
                  •
               egable and diuisible: yet the generall Formes, notwithstandyng, are constant, vnchaungeable, vntrāsformable, and incorruptible. Neither of the sense, can they, at any tyme, be perceiued or iudged. Nor yet for all that, in the royall mynde of man, first conceiued. But, surmountyng the imperfectiō of coniecture, weenyng and opinion: and commyng short of high intellectuall cō
               ceptiō, are the Mercurial fruite of Dianoeticall discourse, in perfect imagination subsistyng. A meruaylous newtralitie haue these thinges Mathematicall. and also a straunge participatiō betwene thinges supernaturall, immortall, intellectual, simple and indiuisible: and thynges naturall, mortall, sensible, compounded and diuisible. Probabilitie and sensible profe, may well serue in thinges naturall: and is commendable: In Mathematicall reasoninges, a probable Argument, is nothyng regarded: nor yet the testimony of sense, any whit credited: But onely a perfect demonstration, of truthes certaine, necessary, and inuincible: vniuersally and necessaryly concluded:

is allowed as sufficient for an Argument exactly and purely Mathematical."
            Of Mathematicall thinges, are two principall kinde

               de, or is counted One, may resonably be called One. We account an Vnit, a thing Mathematicall, though it be no Number, and also indiuisible
                  •
                because, of it, materially, Number doth consist
                  •
                which, principally, is a thing Mathematicall. Magnitude is a thing Mathematicall,
               
                  Magnitude.
                by participation of some likenes of whose nature, any thing is iudged long, broade, or thicke. A thicke Magnitude we call a Solide, or a Body. What Magnitude so euer, is Solide or" Thicke, is also broade, &amp; long. A broade magnitude, we call a Superficies or a Plaine. Euery playne magnitude, hath also length. A long magnitude, we terme a Line. A Line is neither thicke nor broade, but onely long: Euery certayne Line, hath two endes: The endes of a line, are Pointes called.
                  A point.
                A Point, is a thing Mathematicall, indiuisible, which may haue a certayne determined situation. If a Poynt moue from a" determined situation, the way wherein it moued, is also a Line: mathematically produced. whereupon, of the auncient Mathematiciens, a Line is called the race or course of a Point.
               
                  A Line.
                A Poynt we define, by the name of a thing Mathematicall: though it be no Magnitude, and indiuisible: because it is the propre ende, and bound of a Line: which is a true Magnitude.
               
                  Magnitude.
                And Magnitude we may define to be that thing Mathematicall, which is diuisible for euer, in partes diuisible, long, broade or thicke. Therefore though a Poynt be no Magnitude, yet Terminatiuely we recken it a thing Mathematicall (as I sayd) by reason it is properly the end, and bound of a line.
            Neither Number, nor Magnitude, haue any Materialitie. First, we will consider of Number, and of the Science Mathe

Nor yet the puritie and simplenes of Substance Spirituall or Angelicall, will be found propre enough thereto.

                mortall and

immortall, Corporall and Spirituall. Part of this profound and diuine Science, had Ioachim the Prophesier atteyned vnto: by Numbers Formall, Naturall, and Rationall, forseyng, concludyng, and forshewyng great particular euents, long before their comming. His bookes yet remainyng, hereof, are good profe: And the noble Earle of Mirandula, (besides that,) a sufficient witnesse: that Ioachim, in his prophesies, proceded by no other way, then by Numbers Formall. And this Earle hym selfe, in Rome, 
                  Ano. 1488. set vp 900. Conclusions, in all kinde of Sciences, openly to be disputed of: and among the rest, in his Conclusions Mathematicall, (in the eleuenth Conclusion) hath in Latin, this English sentence. By Numbers, a way is had, to the searchyng out, aud vnderstandyng of euery thyng, hable to be knowen. For the verifying of which Conclusion, I promise to aunswere to the 74. Quaestions, vnder written, by the way of Numbers. Which Cō
               clusions, I omit here to rehearse: aswell auoidyng superfluous prolixitie: as, bycause Ioannes Picus, workes, are commonly had. But, in any case, I would wish that those Conclusions were red diligently, and perceiued of such, as are earnest Obseruers and Considerers of the constant law of nūbers: which is planted in thyngs Naturall and Supernaturall: and is prescribed to all Creatures, inuiolably to be kept. For, so, besides many other thinges, in those Conclusions to be marked, it would apeare, how sincerely, &amp; within my boundes, I disclose the wonderfull mysteries, by numbers, to be atteyned vnto.
            Of my former wordes, easy it is to be gathered, that Number hath a treble state: One, in the Creator: an other in euery Creature (in respect of his complete constitution:) and the third, in Spirituall and Angelicall Myndes, and in the Soule of mā. In the first and third state, Number, is termed Number Numbryng. But in all Creatures, otherwise, Number, is termed Nūber Numbred. And in our Soule, Nūber beareth such a swaye, and hath such an affinitie therwith: that some of the old Philosophers taught, Mans Soule, to be a Number mouyng it selfe. And in dede, in vs, though it be a very Accident: yet such an Accident it is, that before all Creatures it had perfect beyng, in the Creator, Sempiternally. Number Numbryng therfore, is the discretion discerning, and distincting of thinges. But in God the Creator, This discretion, in the beginnyng, produced orderly and distinctly all thinges. For his Numbryng, then, was his Creatyng of all thinges. And his Continuall Numbryng, of all thinges, is the Conseruation of them in being: And, where and when he will lacke an Vnit: there and then, that particular thyng shalbe Discreated. Here I stay. But our Seuerallyng, distinctyng, and Numbryng, createth nothyng
                  •
                but of Multitude considered, maketh certaine and distinct determination. And albeit these thynges be waighty and truthes of great importance, yet (by the infinite goodnes of the Almighty Ternarie,) Artificiall Methods and easy wayes are made, by which the zelous Philosopher, may wyn nere this Riuerish Ida
               
                  •
                this Mountayne of Contemplation: and more then Contemplation. And also, though Number, be a thyng so Immateriall, so diuine, and aeternall: yet by degrees, by litle and litle, stretchyng forth, and applying some likenes of it, as first, to thinges Spirituall: and then, bryngyng it lower, to thynges sensibly perceiued: as of a momentanye sounde iterated: then to the least thynges that may be seen, numerable: And at length, (most grossely,) to a multitude of any corporall thynges seen, or felt: and so, of these grosse and sensible thynges, we are trayned to learne a certaine Image or likenes of numbers: and to vse Arte in them to our pleasure and proffit. So grosse is our conuersation, and dull is our apprehension: while mortall Sense, in vs, ruleth the common wealth of our litle world. Hereby we say, Three Lyons, are three: or a Ternarie. Three Egles, are three, or a Ternarie. Which☞ 
               Ternaries, are eche, the Vnion, knot, and Vniformitie, of three discrete and distinct Vnits. That is, we may in eche Ternarie, thrise, seuerally pointe, and shew a part, One, One, and One. Where, in Numbryng, we say One, two,

Three. But how farre, these visible Ones, do differre from our Indiuisible Vnits (in pure Arithmetike, principally considered) no man is ignorant. Yet from these grosse and materiall thynges, may we be led vpward, by degrees, so, informyng our rude Imagination, toward the coceiuyng of Numbers, absolutely (Not supposing, nor admixtyng any thyng created, Corporall or Spirituall, to support, conteyne, or represent those Numbers imagined:) that at length, we may be hable, to finde the number of our owne name, gloriously exemplified and registred in the booke of the Trinitie most blessed and aeternall.
            But farder vnderstand, that vulgar Practisers, haue Numbers, otherwise, in sundry Considerations: and extend their name farder, then to Numbers, whose least part is an Vnit. For the common Logist, Reckenmaster, or Arithmeticien, in hys vsing of Numbers: of an Vnit, imagineth lesse partes
                  •
                and calleth them Fractions. As of an Vnit, he maketh an halfe, and thus noteth it, ½ and so of other, (infinitely diuerse) partes of an Vnit, Yea and farder, hath, Fractions of Fractions. &amp;c. And, forasmuch, as, Addition, Substraction, Multiplication, Diuision and Extraction of Rotes, are the chief, and sufficient partes of Arithmetike:
               
                  Arithmetike.
                which is, the Science that demonstrateth the properties, of Numbers, and all operatiōs, in numbers to be performed.
               How often, therfore,
                     Note.
                   these fiue sundry sortes of Operations, do, for the most part, of their execution, differre from the fiue operations of like generall property and name, in our Whole numbers practisable, So often, (for a more distinct doctrine) we, vulgarly account and name it, an other kynde of Arithmetike.
               
And by this reason: the Consideration, doctrine, and working, in whole numbers onely: where, of an Vnit, is no lesse part to be allowed: is named (as it were) an Ari

In lyke sorte, the necessary, wonderfull and Secret doctrine of Proportion, and proportionalytie hath purchased vnto it selfe a peculier  maner of handlyng and workyng: and so may seme an other forme of Arithmetike. Moreouer, the Astronomers, for spede and more commodious calculation, haue deuised  a peculier maner of orderyng nūbers, about theyr circular motions, by Sexagenes, and Sexagesmes. By Signes, Degrees and Minutes &amp;c. which commonly is called the Arithmetike of Astronomical or Phisicall Fractions. That, haue I briefly noted, by the name of Arithmetike Circular. By cause it is also vsed in circles, not Astronomicall. &amp;c.

                which other while, are Rationall: though they haue the Signe of a Rote before

them, which, Arithmetike of whole Numbers most vsuall, would say they had no such Roote: and so account them Surd Numbers: which generally spokē, is vntrue: as Euclides tenth booke may teach you. Therfore to call them, generally, Radicall Numbers, (by reason of the signe √. prefixed,) is a sure way: and a sufficient generall distinction from all other ordryng and vsing of Numbers: And yet (beside all this) Consider: the infinite desire of knowledge, and incredible power of mans Search and Capacitye: how, they, ioyntly haue waded farder (by mixtyng of speculation and practise) and haue found out, and atteyned to the very chief perfection (almost) of Numbers Practicall vse. Which thing, is well to be perceiued in that great Arithmeticall Arte of AEquation: commonly called the Rule of Coss. or Algebra. The Latines termed it, Regulam Rei &amp; Census, that is, the Rule of the thyng and his value. With an apt name: comprehendyng the first and last pointes of the worke. And the vulgar names, both in Italian, Frenche and Spanish, depend (in namyng it,) vpon the signification of the Latin word, Res: A thing: vnleast they vse the name of Algebra. And therin (commonly) is a dubble error. The one, of them, which thinke it to be of Geber his inuentyng: the other of such as call it Algebra. For, first, though Geber for his great skill in Numbers, Geometry, Astronomy, and other maruailous Artes, mought haue semed hable to haue first deuised the sayd Rule: and also the name carryeth with it a very nere likenes of Geber his name: yet true it is, that a Greke Philosopher and Mathematicien, named Diophantus, before Geber his tyme, wrote 13. bookes therof (of which, six are yet extant: and I had them to

Scientia faciendi Algiebar &amp; Almachabel. i. Scientia inueniendi numerum ignotum, per additionem Numeri, &amp; diuisionem &amp; aequationem. Which is to say: The Science of workyng Algiebar and Almachabel, that is, the Science of findyng an vnknowen number, by Addyng of a Number, &amp; Diuision &amp; aequation. Here haue you the name: and also the principall partes of the Rule, touched. To name it, The rule, or Art of AEquation, doth signi

               ie the middle part and the State of the Rule. This Rule, hath his peculier Characters:  and the principal partes of Arithmetike, to it appertayning, do differe from the other Arithmeticall operations. This Arithmetike, hath Nūbers Simple, Cōpound, Mixt: and Fractions, accordingly. This Rule, and Arithmetike of Algiebar, is so profound, so generall and so (in maner) conteyneth the whole power of Numbers Application practicall: that mans witt, can deale with nothyng

                  R. B.
                by a Countreyman of ours (aboue 200 yeares ago) inuented. And forasmuch as I am vncertaine, who hath the same: or when that litle Latin treatise, (as the Author writ it,) shall come to be Printed: (Both to declare the desire I haue to pleasure my Countrey, wherin I may: and also, for very good profe of Numbers vse, in this most subtile and frutefull, Philosophicall Conclusion,) I entend in the meane while, most briefly, and with my farder helpe, to communicate the pith therof vnto you.
            First describe a circle: whose diameter let be an inch. Diuide the Circumference into foure equall partes. Frō the Center, by those 4. sections, extend 4. right lines: eche of 4. inches and a halfe long: or of as many as you liste, aboue 4. without the circumference of the circle: So that they shall be of 4. inches long (at the lea
                  •
               t) without the Circle
                  •
                Make good euident markes, at euery inches end. If you list, you may subdiuide the inches againe into 10. or 12. smaller partes, equall. At the endes of the lines, write the names of the 4. principall elementall Qualities. Hote and Cold
                     •
                  , one against the other. And likewise Moyst and Dry, one against the other. And in the Circle write Temperate. Which Temperature hath a good Latitude: as appeareth by the Complexion of man. And therefore we haue allowed vnto it, the foresayd Circle: and not a point Mathematicall or Physicall.
            Now, when you haue two thinges Miscible, whose degrees are

                Of necessitie, either they are of one Quantitie and waight, or of diuerse. If they be of one Quantitie and waight: whether their formes, be Contrary Qualities, or of one kinde (but of diuerse intentions and degrees) or a Temperate, and a Contrary, The form
                     •
                   resulting of their Mixture, is in the Middle betwene the degrees of

the formes mixt. As for example, let A, be Moist in the first degree: and B, Dry in the third degree. Adde 1. and 3. that maketh 4: the halfe or middle of 4. is 2. This 2. is the middle, equally distant from A and B (for the

               Temperament is counted none. And for it, you must put a Ciphre, if at any time, it be in mixture).

Counting then from B, 2. degrees, toward A: you finde it to be Dry in the first degree: So is the Forme resulting of the Mixture of A, and B, in our example, I will geue you an other example. Suppose, you haue two thinges, as C, and D
               
                  •
                and of C, the Heate to be in the 4. degree: and of D, the Colde, to be remisse, euen vnto the Temperament. Now, for C, you take 4
                  •
                and for D, you take a Ciphre: which, added vnto 4, yeldeth onely 4. The middle, or halfe, whereof, is 2. Wherefore the Forme resulting of C, and D, is Hote in the second degree: for 2. degrees, accounted from C, toward D, ende iuste in the 2. degree of heate.

Now by the rule of Algiebar, haue I deuised a very

               aste, briefe, and generall maner of working in this case. Let vs first, suppose that Middle Forme resulting, to be 1

                  •
                to the difference betwene 1

               : and for the second, I set 1

               —3. And, now againe, I say, as 1. is to 2. so is 4—1

                to 1
                  •
               —3. Wherfore, of these foure proportionall numbers, the first and the fourth Multiplied, one by the other, do make as much, as the second and the third Multiplied the one by

For, what proportion, 100 hath to 75: the same hath 17 1/7 to 12 6/7: Which is Sesquitertia: that is, as 4, to 3. which make 7. Wonderfull many places, in the Ciuile law, require an expert Arithmeticien, to vnderstand the deepe Iudgemēt, &amp; Iust determinatiō of the Auncient Romaine Lawmakers. But much more expert ought he to be, who should be hable, to decide with aequitie, the infinite varietie of Cases, which do, or may happen, vnder euery one of those lawes and ordinances Ciuile. Hereby, easely, ye may now coniecture: that in the Canon law: and in the lawes of the Realme (which with vs, beare the chief Authoritie), Iustice and equity might be greately preferred, and skilfully executed, through due skill of Arithmetike, and proportions appertainyng. The worthy Philosophers, and prudent lawmakers (who haue written many bookes De Republica: How the best state of Common wealthes might be procured and mainteined,) haue very well determined of Iustice: (which, not onely, is the Base and foundacion of Common weales:
but also the totall perfection of all our workes, words, and thoughtes:) defining it, to be that vertue,
                     Iustice.
                   by which, to euery one, is rendred, that to him appertaineth. God challengeth this at our handes, to be honored as God:
to beloued, as a father: to be feared as a Lord &amp; master. Our neighbours proportiō, is also prescribed of the Almighty lawmaker: which is, to do to other, euen as we would be done vnto. These proportions, are in Iustice necessary

               Hydrographie, deliuereth to our knowledge, on Globe or in Plaine, the perfect Analogicall description of the Ocean Sea coastes, through the whole world

                  les and chiefe

particular places of daungers, conteyned within the boundes, and Sea coastes described: as, of Quicksandes, Bankes, Pittes, Rockes, Races, Countertides, Whorlepooles. &amp;c.
This, dealeth with the Element of the water chiefly: as Geographie did principally take the Element of the Earthes description (with his appertenances) to taske. And besides thys, Hydrographie, requireth a particular Register of certaine Landmarkes (where markes may be had) from the sea, well hable to be skried, in what point of the Seacumpase they appeare, and what apparent forme, Situation, and bignes they haue, in respecte of any daungerous place in the sea, or nere vnto it, assigned: And in all Coastes, what Mone, maketh full Sea: and what way, the Tides and Ebbes, come and go, the Hydrographer ought to recorde. The Soundinges likewise: and the Chanels wayes: their number, and depthes ordinarily, at ebbe and flud, ought the Hydrographer, by obseruation and diligence of Measuring, to haue certainly knowen. And many other pointes, are belonging to perfecte Hydrographie, and for to make a Rutter, by: of which, I nede not here speake: as of the describing, in any place, vpon Globe or Plaine, the 32. pointes of the Compase, truely: (wherof, scarsly foure, in England, haue right knowledge: bycause, the lines therof, are no straight lines, nor Circles.) Of making due proiection of a Sphere in plaine. Of the Variacion of the Compas, from true Northe: And such like matters (of great importance, all) I leaue to speake of, in this place: bycause, I may seame (al ready) to haue enlarged the boundes, and duety of an Hydographer, much more, then any man (to this day) hath noted, or prescribed. Yet am I well hable to proue, all these thinges, to appertaine, and also to be proper to the Hydrographer. The chief vse and ende of this Art, is the Art of Nauigation; but it hath other diuerse vses: euen by them to be enioyed, that neuer lacke sight of land.
            Stratarithmetrie, is the Skill, (appertainyng to the warre,) by which a man can set in figure, analogicall to any Geometricall figure appointed, any certaine number or summe of men: of such a figure capable: (by reason of the vsuall spaces betwene Souldiers allowed: and for that, of men, can be made no Fractions. Yet, neuertheles, he can order the giuen summe of men, for the greatest such figure, that of them, cā be ordred) and certifie, of the ouerplus: (if any be) and of the next certaine summe, which, with the ouerplus, will admit a figure exactly proportionall to the figure assigned. By which Skill, also, of any army or company of men: (the figure &amp; sides of whose orderly standing, or array, is knowen) he is able to expresse the iust number of men, within that figure conteined: or (orderly) able to be conteined. 
                  Note.
                And this figure, and sides therof, he is hable to know: either beyng by, and at hand: or a farre of.
Thus farre, stretcheth the description and property of Stratarithmetrie: sufficient for this tyme and place. It differreth from the Feate Tacticall, De acic

                   there, is necessary the wisedome and foresight, to what purpose he so ordreth the men: and Skillfull hability, also, for any occasion, or purpose, to deuise and vse the aptest and most necessary order, array and figure of his Company and Summe of men. By figure, I meane: as, either of a Perfect Square, Triangle, Circle, Ouale, long square, (of the Grekes it is called Eteromekes) Rhombe, Rhomboïd, Lunular, Ryng, Serpentine, and such other Geometricall figures:
Which, in warres, haue ben, and are to be vsed: for commodiousnes, necessity, and auauntage &amp;c. And no small skill ought he to haue, that should make true report, or nere the truth, of the numbers and Summes, of footemen or horsemen, in the Enemyes ordring. A farre of, to make an estimate, betwene nere termes of More and Lesse, is not a thyng very rife, among those that gladly would

do it. Great pollicy may be vsed of the Capitaines,

He may wonderfully helpe him selfe, by perspectiue Glasses. In which, (I trust) our posterity will proue more skillfull and expert, and to greater purposes, then in these dayes, can (almost) be credited to be possible.
            Thus haue I lightly passed ouer the Artificiall Feates, chiefly dependyng vpon vulgar Geometrie: &amp; commonly and generally reckened vnder the name of Geometrie. But there are other (very many) Methodicall Artes, which, declyning from the purity, simplicitie, and Immateriality, of our Principall Science of Magnitudes: do yet neuertheles vse the great ayde, direction, and Method of the sayd principall Science, and haue propre names, and distinct: both from the Science of Geometrie, (from which they are deriued) and one from the other. As Perspectiue, Astronomie, Musike, Cosmographie, Astrologie, Statike, Anthropographie, Trochilike, Helicosophie, Pneumatithmie, Menadrie, Hypogeiodie, Hydragogie, Horometrie, Zographie, Architecture, Nauigation, Thaumaturgike and Archemastrie. I thinke it necessary, orderly, of these to giue some peculier descriptions: and withall, to touch some of their commodious vses, and so to make this Preface, to be a little swete, pleasant Nosegaye for you: to comfort your Spirites, beyng almost out of courage, and in despayre, (through brutish brute) Weenyng that Geometrie, had but serued for buildyng of an house, or a curious bridge, or the roufe of Westminster hall, or some witty pretty deuise, or engyn, appropriate to a Carpenter, or a Ioyner &amp;c. That the thing is farre otherwise, then the world, (commonly) to this day, hath demed, by worde and worke, good profe wilbe made.
            Among these Artes, by good reason, Perspectiue ought to be had, ere of Astronomicall Apparences, perfect knowledge can be atteyned. And bycause of the prerogatiue of Light, beyng the first of Gods Creatures: and the eye, the light of our body, and his Sense most mighty, and his organ most Artificiall and Geometricall: At Perspectiue, we will begyn therfore. Perspectiue, is an Art Mathematicall, which demonstrateth the maner, and properties, of all Radiations Direct, Broken, and Reflected. This Description, or Notation, is brief

                but it reacheth so farre, as the world is wyde. It concerneth all Creatures, all Actions, and passions, by Emanation of beames perfourmed. Beames, or naturall lines, (here) I meane, not of light onely, or of colour (though they, to eye, giue shew, witnes, and profe, wherby to ground the Arte vpon) but also of other Formes, both Substantiall, and Accidentall, the certaine and determined actiue Radiall em

               ght seen; &amp; of other: which by like order of Lightes Radiations, worke and produce their effectes. We may be ashamed to be ignorant of the cause, why so sundry wayes our eye is deceiued, and abused: as, while the eye weeneth a roūd Globe or Sphere (beyng farre of) to be a flat and plaine Circle, and so likewise iudgeth

a plaine Square, to be roūd: supposeth walles parallels, to approche, a farre of: rofe and floure parallels, the one to bend downward, the other to rise vpward, at a little distance from you. Againe, of thinges being in like swiftnes of mouing, to thinke the nerer, to moue faster: and the farder, much slower. Nay, of two thinges, wherof the one (incomparably) doth moue swifter then the other, to deme the slower to moue very swift, &amp; the other to stand: what an error is this, of our eye? Of the Raynbow, both of his Colours, of the order of the colours, of the bignes of it, the place and heith of it, (&amp;c) to know the causes demonstratiue, is it not pleasant, is it not necessary? of two or three Sonnes appearing: of Blasing Sterres: and such like thinges: by naturall causes, brought to passe, (and yet neuertheles, of farder matter, Significatiue) is it not commodious for man to know the very true cause, &amp; occasion Naturall? Yea, rather, is it not, greatly, against the Souerainty of Mans nature, to be so ouershot and abused, with thinges (at hand) before his eyes? as with a Pecockes tayle, and a Doues necke: or a whole ore, in water, holden, to seme broken. Thynges, farre of, to seeme nere: and nere, to seme farre of. Small thinges, to seme great: and great, to seme small. One man, to seme an Army. Or a man to be curstly affrayed of his owne shaddow. Yea, so much, to feare, that, if you, being (alone) nere a certaine glasse, and proffer, with dagger or sword, to foyne at the glasse, you shall suddenly be moued to giue backe (in maner) by reason of an Image,

                appearing in the ayre, betwene you &amp; the glasse, with like hand, sword or dagger, &amp; with like quicknes, foyning at your very eye, likewise as you do at the Glasse. Straunge, this is, to heare of: but more meruailous to behold, then these my wordes can signifie. And neuerthelesse by demonstration Opticall, the order and cause therof, is certified: euen so, as the effect is consequent. Yea, thus much more, dare I take vpon me, toward the satisfying of the noble courrage, that longeth ardently for the wisedome of Causes Naturall: as to let him vnderstand, that, in London, he may wish his owne eyes, haue profe of that, which I haue sayd herein. A Gentleman, (which, for his good seruice,
                  S.W.P.

Ye may easily gesse, what I meane. This Art of Perspectiue, is of that excellency, and may be led, to the certifying, and executing of such thinges, as no man would easily beleue: without Actuall profe perceiued. I speake nothing of Naturall Philosophie, which, without Perspectiue, can not be fully vnderstanded, nor perfectly atteined vnto. Nor, of Astronomie: which, without Perspectiue, can not well be grounded: Nor Astrologie, naturally Verified, and auouched. That part hereof, which dealeth with Glasses (which name, Glasse, is a generall name, in this Arte, for any thing, from which, a Beame reboundeth) is called Catoptrike and hath so many vses, both merueilous, and proffitable: that, both, it would hold me to long, to no

Democritus and Theophrastus affirmed, that, by Musike, griefes and diseases of the Minde, and body might be cured, or inferred. And we finde in Recorde, that Terpander, Arion, Ismenias, Orpheus, Amphion, Dauid, Pythagoras, Empedocles, Asclepiades and Timotheus, by Harmonicall Consonācy, haue done, and brought to pas, thinges, more then meruailous, to here of. Of them then, making no farder discourse, in this place: Sure I am, that Common Musike, commonly vsed, is found to the Musiciens and Hearers, to be so Commodious and pleasant, That if I would say and dispute, but thus much: That it were to be otherwise vsed, then it is, I should finde more repreeuers, then I could finde priuy, or skilfull of my meaning. In thinges therfore euident, and better knowen, then I can expresse: and so allowed and liked of, (as I would wish, some other thinges, had the like hap) I will spare to enlarge my lines any farder, but consequently follow my purpose.
            Of Cosmographie, I appointed briefly in this place, to geue you some intelligence. Cosmographie, is the whole and perfect description of the heauenly, and also elementall parte of the world, and their homologall application, and mutuall collation necessarie. This Art, requireth Astronomie, Geographie, Hydrographie and Musike. Therfore, it is no small Arte, nor so simple, as in common practise, it is (slightly) considered.

                not by new deuise, but by good reason and authoritie: for, Astrologie, is an Arte Mathematicall, which reasonably demonstrateth the operations and effectes, of the naturall beames, of light, and secrete influence: of the Sterres and Planets: in euery element and elementall body:

at all times, in any Horizon assigned. This Arte is furnished with many other great Artes and experiences: As with perfecte Perspectiue, Astronomie, Cosmographie, Naturall Philosophie of the 4. Elementes, the Arte of Graduation, and some good vnderstāding in Musike: and yet moreouer, with an other great Arte, hereafter following, though I, here, set this before, for some considerations me mouing. Sufficient (you see) is the stuffe, to make this rare and secrete Arte, of: and hard enough to frame to the Conclusion Syllogisticall. Yet both the manifolde and continuall trauailes of the most auncient and wise Philosophers, for the atteyning of this Arte: and by examples of effectes, to confirme the same: hath left vnto vs sufficient proufe and witnesse: and we, also, daily may perceaue, That mans body, and all other Elementall bodies, are altered, disposed, ordred, pleasured, and displeasured, by the Influentiall working of the Sunne, Mone, and the other Starres and Planets. And therfore, sayth Aristotle, in the first of his Meteorologicall bookes, in the second Chapter: Est autem necessariò Mundus iste, supernis lationibus ferè continuus. Vt, inde, vis eius vniuersa regatur. Ea siquidem Causa prima putanda omnibus est, vnde motus principium existit. That is: This [Elementall] World is of necessitie, almost, next adioyning, to the heauenly motions: That, from thence, all his vertue or force may be gouerned. For, that is to be thought the first Cause vnto all: from which, the beginning of motion, is. And againe, in the tenth Chapter. Op

And finally, the Elementes, and all thinges of the Elementes composed, do geue Testimonie (as Aristotle sayd) that theyr Whole Dispositions, vertues, and naturall motions, depend of the Actiuitie of the heauenly motions and Influences. Whereby, beside the specificall order and forme, due to euery seede: and beside the Nature, propre to the Indiuiduall Matrix, of the thing produced: What shall be the heauenly Impression, the perfect and circumspecte Astrologien hath to Conclude.

If you now find the waight of your Cube, to be to the waight of the Sphaere, as 21. is to 11: Then you see, how the Mechanicien and Experimenter, without Geometrie and Demonstration, are (as nerely in effect) tought the proportion of the Cube to the Sphere: as I haue demonstrated it, in the end of the twelfth boke of Euclide. Often, try with the same Cube and Sphaere. Then, chaunge, your Sphaere and Cube, to an other matter: or to an other bignes: till you haue made a perfect vniuersall Experience of it. Possible it is, that you shall wynne to nerer termes, in the proportion.
            When you haue found this one certaine Drop of Naturall veritie, procede on, to Inferre, and duely to make assay, of matter depending. As, bycause it is well demonstrated, that a Cylinder, whose heith, and Diameter of his base, is aequall to the Diameter of the Sphaere, is Sesquialter to the same Sphaere (that is, as 3. to 2:) To the number of the waight of the Sphaere, adde halfe so much, as it is: and so haue you the number of the waight of that Cylinder. Which is also Comprehended of our former Cube: So, that the base of that Cylinder, is a Circle described in the Square, which is the base of our Cube. But the Cube and the Cylinder, being both of one heith, haue their Bases in the same proportion, in the which, they are, one to an other, in their Massines or Soliditie. But, before, we haue two numbers, expressing their Massines, Solidities, and Quantities, by waight: wherfore, we haue

                by the way. That we may Square the Circle, without hauing knowledge of the proportion, of the Circumference to the Diameter: as you haue here perceiued. And otherwayes also, I can demonstrate it. So that, many haue cumberd them selues superfluously, by trauailing in that point first, which was not of necessitie, first: and also very intricate. And easily, you may, (and that diuersly) come to the knowledge of the Circumference: the Circles Quantitie, being first knowen.

wayes you may conclude your purpose: it is to wete, either by numbers or lines. By numbers: as, if you diuide the side of your Fundamentall Cube into so many aequall partes, as it is capable of, conueniently, with your ease, and precisenes of the diuision. For, as the number of your first and lesse line (in your hollow Pyramis or Cone,) is to the second or greater (both being counted from the vertex) so shall the number of the side of your Fundamentall Cube, be to the nūber belonging to the Radicall side, of the Cube, dubble to your Fundamentall Cube: Which being multiplied Cubik wise, will sone shew it selfe, whether it be dubble or no, to the Cubik number of your Fundamentall Cube. By lines, thus: As your lesse and first line, (in your hollow Pyramis or Cone,) is to the second or greater, so let the Radical side of your Fundamētall Cube, be to a fourth proportionall line, by the 12. proposition, of the sixth boke of Euclide. Which fourth line, shall be the Rote Cubik, or Radicall side of the Cube, dubble to your Fundamentall Cube: which is the thing we desired.

Without all preparing of your Fundamentall Cubes: you may (alike) worke this Conclusion. For, that, was rather a kinde of Experimentall demōstration, then the shortest way:

and all, vpon one Mathematicall Demonstration depending.
Take water (as much as conueniently will serue your turne: as I warned before of your Fundamentall Cubes bignes) Way it precisely. Put that water, into your Pyramis or Cone. Of the same kinde of water, then take againe, the same waight you had before: put that likewise into the Pyramis or Cone. For, in eche time, your marking of the lines, how the Water doth cut them, shall geue you the proportion betwen the Radicall sides, of any two Cubes, wherof the one is Double to the other: working as before I haue taught you:

Frō the bottome of that Parallelipipedon, raise vp, many perpendiculars, in euery of his fower sides. Now if any proportion be assigned you, in right lines:
Cut one of your perpendiculars (or a line equall to it, or lesse then it) likewise: by the 10. of the sixth of Euclide. And those two partes, set in two sundry lines of those perpendiculars (or you may set them both, in one line) making their beginninges, to be, at the base: and so their lengthes to extend vpward. Now, set your hollow Parallelipipedon, vpright, perpendicularly, steadie. Poure in water, handsomly, to the heith of your shorter line. Poure that water, into the hollow Pyramis or Cone.

Wherefore, if to the first, and second lines, found in your hollow Pyramis or Cone, you ioyne a third and a fourth, in continuall proportion: that fourth line, shall be to the first, as the greater Pyramis or Cone, is to the lesse: by the 33

But, as our first line, is to the second, so is the Radicall side of our Fundamentall Cube, to the Radicall side of the Cube to be made, or to be doubled: and therefore, to those twaine also, a third and a fourth line, in continuall proportion, ioyned: will geue the fourth line in that proportion to the first, as our fourth Pyramidall, or Conike line, was to his first: but that was double, or treble, &amp;c. as the Pyramids or Cones were, one to an other (as we haue proued) therfore, this fourth, shalbe also double or treble to the first, as the Pyramids or Cones were one to an other: But our made Cube, is described of the second in proportion, of the fower proportionall lines: therfore

And of the Parallelipipedō, it is euidēt, that the water Solide Parallelipipedons, are one to the other, as their heithes are, seing they haue one base. Wherfore the Pyramids or Cones, made of those water Parallelipipedons, are one to the other, as the lines are (one to the other) betwene which, our proportion was assigned. But the Cubes made of lines, after the proportiō of the Pyramidal or Conik homologall lines, are one to the other, as the Pyramides or Cones are, one to the other (as we before did proue) therfore, the Cubes made, shalbe one to the other, as the lines assigned, are one to the other: Which was to be demonstrated. Note.
                  Note this Corollary.
               This, my Demonstratiō is more generall, then onely in Square Pyramis or Cone: Consider well. Thus, haue I, both Mathematically and Mechanically, ben very long in wordes: yet (I trust) nothing tedious to them, who, to these thinges, are well a

               fected. And verily I am forced (auoiding prolixitie) to omit sundry such things, easie to be practised: which to the Mathematicien, would be a great Threasure: and to the Mechanicien, no small gaine. 
                  The great Commodities following of these new Inuentions.
                Now may you, Betwene two lines giuen, finde two middle proportionals, in Continuall proportion: by the hollow Parallelipipedon, and the hollow Pyramis, or Cone. Now, any Parallelipipedon rectangle being giuen: thre right lines may be found, proportionall in any proportion assigned, of which, shal be produced a Parallelipipedon, aequall to the Parallelipipedon giuen. Hereof, I noted somwhat, vpon the 36. proposition, of the 11. boke of Euclide. Now, all those thinges, which Vitruuius in his Architecture, specified hable to be done, by dubbling of the Cube
                  •
                Or, by finding of two middle proportionall lines, betwene two lines giuen, may easely be performed. Now, that Probleme, which I noted vnto you, in the end of my Addition, vpon the 34. of the 11. boke of Euclide, is proued possible. Now may any regular body, be Transformed into an other, &amp;c. Now, any regular body: any Sphere, yea any Mixt Solid: and (that more is) Irregular Solides, may be made (in any proportiō assigned) like vnto the body, first giuen. Thus, of a Manneken, (as the Dutch Painters terme it) in the same Symmetrie, may a Giant be made: and that, with any gesture, by the Manneken vsed: and contrarywise. Now, may you, of any Mould, or Modell of a Ship, make one, of the same Mould (in any assigned proportion) bigger or lesser.

            Trochilike, is that Art Mathematicall, which demonstrateth the properties of all Circular motions, Simple and Compounde. And bycause the frute hereof, vulgarly receiued, is in Wheles, it hath the name of Trochilike: as a man would say, Whele Art. By this art, a Whele may be geuen which shall moue ones about, in any tyme assigned. Two Wheles may be giuen, whose turnynges about in one and the same tyme, (or equall tymes), shall haue, one to the other, any proportion appointed. By Wheles, may a straight line be described: Likewise, a Spirall line in plaine, Conicall Section lines, and other Irregular lines, at pleasure, may be drawen. These, and such like, are principall Conclusions of this Arte: and helpe forward many pleasant and profitable Mechanicall workes: As Milles,
                  Saw Milles.
                to Saw great and very long Deale bordes, no man being by. Such haue I seene in Germany: and in the Citie of Prage: in the kingdome of Bohemia: Coyning Milles, Hand Milles for Corne grinding: And all maner of Milles, and Whele worke: By Winde, Smoke, Water, Waight, Spring, Man or Beast, moued. Take in your hand, Agricola

By Wheles, straunge workes and incredible, are done as will, in other Artes hereafter, appeare. A wonderfull example of farther possibilitie, and present commoditie, was sene in my time, in a certaine Instrument: which by the Inuenter and Artificer (before) was solde for xx. Talentes of Golde: and then had (by misfortune) receaued some iniurie and hurt: And one Ianellus of Cremona did mend the same, and presented it vnto the Emperour Charles the fifth. Hieronymus Cardanus, can be my witnesse, that therein, was one Whele, which moued, and that, in such rate, that, in 7000. yeares onely, his owne periode should be finished. A thing almost incredible: But how farre, I keepe me within my boundes: very many men (yet aliue) can tell.
            Helicosophie, is nere Sister to Trochilike: and is, An Arte Mathematicall, which demonstrateth the designing of all Spirall lines in Plaine, on Cylinder, Cone, Sphaere, Conoid, and Sphaeroid, and their properties appertayning. The vse hereof, in Architecture, and diuerse Instrumentes and Engines, is most necessary. For, in many thinges, the Skrue worketh the feate, which, els, could not be performed. By helpe hereof, it is

and as they are ioyned to the Elementes next them. This Arte, to the Naturall Philosopher, is very proffitable: to proue, that Vacuum, or Emptines is not in the world. And that, all Nature, abhorreth it so much: that, contrary to ordinary law, the Elementes will moue or stand. As, Water to ascend: rather then betwene him and Ayre, Spac

The like, is of Fire and Ayre: they will descend: when, either, their Cōtinuitie should be dissolued: or their next Element forced from them. And as they will not be extended, to discontinuitie: So, will they not, nor yet of mans force, can be prest or pent, in space, not sufficient and aunswerable to their bodily substance. Great force and violence will they vse, to enioy their naturall right and libertie.

Very much is this Art furdred by other Artes as, in some pointes, by Perspectiue: in some, by Statike: in some, by Trochilike: and in other, by Helicosophie: and Pneumatithmie. By this Art, all Granes, Gybbettes, &amp; Ingines to lift vp, or to force any thing, any maner way, are ordred: and the certaine cause of their force

                Which, from an English man, had the occasion and order of first inuenting: though in an other land, and by other men, it was first executed. And they that should see the record, where the occasion and order generall, of Gunning, is first discoursed of, would thinke: that, small thinges, flight, and cōmon: comming to wise mens consideration, and industrious mens handling, may grow to be of force incredible.
            
            Hypogeiodie, is an Arte Mathematicall, demonstratyng, how, vnder the Sphaericall Superficies of the earth, at any depth, to any perpendicular line assigned (whose distance from the perpendicular of the entrance: and the Azimuth, likewise, in respect of the said entrance, is knowen) certaine way may be praescribed and gone: And how, any way aboue the Superficies of the earth designed, may vnder earth, at any depth limited, be kept: goyng alwayes, perpendicularly, vnder the way, on earth designed: And, contrarywise, Any way, (straight or croked,) vnder the earth, beyng giuen: vppon the vtface, or Superficies of the earth, to Lyne out the same: So, as, from the Centre of the earth, perpendiculars drawen to the Sphaericall Superficies of the earth, shall precisely fall in the Correspondent pointes of those two wayes.

Then, after that, by Sand running, were howers measured: Then, by Trochilike with waight: And of late time, by Trochilike with Spring: without waight. All these,

by Sunne or Sterres direction (in certaine time) require ouersight and reformation, according to the heauenly AEquinoctiall Motion: besides the inaequalitie of their owne Operation. There remayneth (without parabolicall meaning herein) among the Philosophers,

This Mechanicall Zographer (commonly called the Painter) is meruailous in his skill: and seemeth to haue a certaine diuine power: As, of frendes absent, to make a frendly, present comfort: yea, and of frendes dead, to giue a continuall, silent presence: not onely with vs, but with our posteritie, for many Ages.

Likewise, by Perspectiue, the Lightes of the heauen, are well led, in the buildinges: from certaine quarters of the world. By Arithmetike, the charges of Buildinges are summed together: the measures are expressed, and the hard questions of Symmetries, are by Geometricall Meanes and Methods discoursed on. &amp;c.

For in their courses, leadinges about, in the leuell ground, and in the mountinges, the naturall Spirites or breathes are ingendred diuers wayes: The hindrances, which they cause, no man can helpe, but he, which out of Philosophie, hath learned the originall causes of thinges.

               But I will appoint the Architect to be that man, who hath the skill, (by a certaine and meruailous meanes and way,) both in minde and Imagination to determine: and also in worke to finish:
what workes so euer, by motion of waight, and cuppling and framyng together of bodyes, may most aptly be Commodious for the worthiest. Vses of Man. And that he may be able to performe these thinges, he hath nede of atteynyng and knowledge of the best, and most worthy thynges. &amp;c.
               The whole Feate of Architecture in buildyng, confisteth in Lineamentes, and in Framyng.

And it is the property of Lineamentes, to prescribe vnto buildynges, and euery part of them, an apt place, &amp; certaine nūber: a worthy maner, and a semely order: that, so, ye whole

               We thanke you Master Baptist, that you haue so aptly brought your Arte, and phrase therof, to haue some Mathematicall perfection:
                     Note.

                     •
                  , is of the principalitie, which this Science hath, aboue all other Artes. And Plato affirmeth, the Architect to be Master ouer all, that make any worke. Wherupon, he is neither Smith, not Builder: nor, separately, any Artificer: but the

Hed, the Prouost, the Directer, and Iudge of all Artificiall workes, and all Artificers. For, the true Architect, is hable to teach, Demonstrate, distribute, des
                  •
               ribe, and Iudge all workes wrought. And he, onely, searcheth out the causes and reasons of all Artificiall thynges. Thus excellent, is Architecture: though few (in our dayes) atteyne: 
                  •
               ereto: yet may not the Arte, be otherwise thought on, then in very dede it is worthy. Nor we may not, of auncient Artes, make new and imperfect Definitions in our dayes: for scarsitie of Artificers: No more, than we may pynche in, the Definitions of Wisedome, or Honestie, or of Frendeshyp or of Iustice. No more will I consent, to Diminish any whit, of the perfection and dignitie, (by iust cause) allowed to absolute Architecture. Vnder the Direction of this Arte, are thre principall, necessary Mechanicall Artes. Namely, Howsing, Fortification, and Naupegie. Howsing, I vnderstand, both for Diuine Seruice, and Mans common vsage: publike, and priuate. Of Fortification and Naupegie, straunge matter might be told you: But perchaunce, some will be tyred, with this Bederoll, all ready rehearsed: and other some, w

Lyfe is short, and vncertaine: Tymes are perilouse: &amp;c. And still the Printer awayting, for my pen staying: All these thinges, with farder matter of Ingratefulnes, giue me occasion to passe away, to the other Artes remainyng, with all spede possible.
            THe Arte of Nauigation, demonstrateth how, by the shortest good way, by the aptest Directiō, &amp; in the shortest time, a sufficient Ship, betwene any two places (in passage Nauigable,) assigned: may be cōducted: and in all stormes, &amp; naturall disturbances chauncyng, how, to vse the best possible meanes, whereby to recouer the place first assigned. What nede, the Master Pilote, hath of other Artes, here before recited, it is easie to know: as, of Hydrographie, Astronomie, Astrologie, and Horometrie. Presupposing continually, the common Base, and foundacion of all: namely Arithmetike and Geometrie. So that, he be hable to vnderstand, and Iudge his own necessary Instrumentes, and furniture Necessary: Whether they be perfectly made or no: and also can, (if nede be) make them, hym selfe.

And also, be hable to Calculate the Planetes places for all tymes.

Surely (for my part, somewhat to say herein) I haue not learned to make so brutish, and so wicked a Bargaine. Should I, for my xx. or xxv. yeares Studie: for two or three thousand Markes spending: seuen or eight thousand Miles going and trauailing, onely for good learninges sake: And that, in all maner of wethers: in all maner of waies and passages: both early and late: in daunger of violence by man: in daunger of destruction by wilde beastes: in hunger: in thirst: in perilous heates by day, with toyle on foote: in daungerous dampes of colde, by night, almost bereuing life: (as God knoweth): with lodginges, oft times, to small ease: and somtime to lesse securitie. And for much more (then all this) done &amp; suffred, for Learning and attaining of Wisedome: Should I (I pray you) for all this, no otherwise, nor more warily: or (by Gods mercifulnes) no more luckily, haue fished, with so large, and costly, a Nette, so long time in drawing (and that with the helpe and aduise of Lady Philosophie, &amp; Queene Theologie): but at length, to haue catched, and drawen vp,

                a Frog? Nay, a Deuill? For, so, doth the Common peuish Pratler Imagine and Iangle: And, so, doth the Malicious skorner, secretly wishe, &amp; brauely and boldly face down, behinde my backe. Ah, what a miserable thing, is this kinde of Men? How great is the blindnes &amp; boldnes, of the Multitude, in thinges aboue their Capacitie? What a Land: what a People: what Maners: what Times are these? Are they become Deuils, themselues: and, by false witnesse bearing against their Neighbour, would they also, become Murderers? Doth God, so long geue them respite, to reclaime them selues in, from this horrible slaundering of the giltlesse: contrary to their owne Consciences: and yet will they not cease? Doth the Innocent, forbeare the calling of them, Iuridically to aunswere him, according to the rigour of the Lawes: and will they despise his Charitable pacience? As they, against him, by name, do forge, fable, rage, and raise slaunder, by Worde &amp; Print: Will they prouoke him, by worde and Print, likewise, to Note their Names to the World: with their particular deuises, fables, beastly Imaginations, and vnchristenlike slaunders? Well: Well. O (you such) my vnkinde Countrey men. O vnnaturall Countrey men. O vnthankfull Countrey men. O Brainsicke, Rashe, Spitefull, and Disdainfull Countrey men. Why oppresse you me, thus violently, with your slaundering of me: Contrary to Veritie: and contrary to your owne Consciences? And I, to this hower, neither by worde, deede, or thought, haue bene, any way, hurtfull, damageable, or iniurious to you, or yours? Haue I, so long, so dearly, so farre, so carefully, so painfully, so daungerously sought &amp; trauailed for the learning of Wisedome, &amp; atteyning of Vertue: And in the end (in your iudgemēt) am I become, worse, then when I begā? Worse, thē a Mad man? A dangerous Member in the Common Wealth: and no Member of the Church of Christ? Call you this, to be Learned? Call you this, to be a Philosopher? and a louer of Wisedome? To forsake the straight heauenly way: and to wallow in the broad way of

damnation? To forsake the light of heauenly Wisedome: and to lurke in the dungeon of the Prince of darkenesse? To forsake the Veritie of God, &amp; his Creatures: and to fawne vpon the Impudent, Craftie, Obstinate Lier, and continuall disgracer of Gods Veritie, to the vttermost of his power? To forsake the Life &amp; Blisse AEternall: and to cleaue vnto the Author of Death euerlasting? that Murderous Tyrant, most gredily awaiting the Pray of Mans Soule? Well: I thanke God and our Lorde Iesus Christ, for the Comfort which I haue by the Examples of other men, before my time: To whom, neither in godlines of life, nor in perfection of learning, I am worthy to be compared: and yet, they sustained the very like Iniuries, that I do: or rather, greater. Pacient Socrates, his Apologie will testifie: Apuleius his Apologies, will declare the Brutishnesse of the Multitude. Ioannes Picus, Earle of Mirandula, his Apologie will teach you, of the Raging slaunder of the Malicious Ignorant against him. Ioannes Trithemius, his Apologie will specifie, how he had occasion to make publike Protestation: as well by reason of the Rude Simple: as also, in respect of such, as were counted to be of the wisest sort of men.
Many could I recite: But I deferre the precise and determined handling of this matter: being loth to detect the Folly &amp; Mallice of my Natiue Countrey men.☞ Who, so hardly, can disgest or like any extraordinary course of Philosophicall Studies: not falling within the Cumpasse of their Capacitie: or where they are not made priuie of the true and secrete cause, of such wonderfull Philosophicall Feates.
These men, are of fower sortes, chie
                  •
               ly. The first, I may name, Vaine pratling busie bodies: The second, Fond Frendes: The third, Imperfectly zelous: and the fourth, Malicious Ignorant. To eche of these (briefly, and in charitie) I will say a word  or two, and so returne to my Praeface. Vaine pratling busie bodies, vse your idle assemblies, and conferences, otherwise, then in talke of matter, either aboue your Capacities, for hardnesse: or contrary to your Consciences, in Veritie. Fonde  Frendes, leaue of, so to commend your vnacquainted frend, vpon blinde affection: As, because he knoweth more, then the common Student: that, therfore, he must needes be skilfull, and a doer, in such matter and maner, as you terme Coniuring. Weening, thereby, you aduaunce his fame: and that you make other men, great marueilers of your hap, to haue such a learned frend. Cease to ascribe Impietie, where you pretend Amitie. For, if your tounges were true, then were that your frend, Vntrue, both to God, and his Soueraigne. Such Frendes and Fondlinges, I shake of, and renounce you: Shake you of, your Folly. Imperfectly zelous, to you,  do I say: that (perhaps) well, do you Meane: But farre you misse the Marke: If a Lambe you will kill, to feede the flocke with his bloud. Sheepe, with Lambes bloud, haue no naturall sustenaunce: No more, is Christes flocke, with horrible slaunders, duely aedified. Nor your faire pretense, by such rashe ragged Rhetorike, any whit, well graced. But such, as so vse me, will finde a fowle Cracke in their Credite. Speake that you know: And know, as you ought: Know not, by Heare say, when life lieth in daunger. Search to the quicke, &amp; let Charitie be your guide. 
               Malicious Ignorant, what shall I say to thee? Prohibe linguam tuam a malo. A detractione parcite linguae. Cause thy toung to refraine frō euill. Refraine your toung from slaunder. Though your tounges be sharpned, Serpent like, &amp; Adders poyson lye in your lippes:
                  Psal. 140. yet take heede, and thinke, betimes, with your selfe, Vir linguosus non stabilietur in terra. Virum violentum venabitur malum, donec praecipitetur. For, sure I am, Quia faciet Dominus Iudicium afflicti: &amp; vindictam pauperum.
            
            Thus, I require you, my assured frendes, and Countrey men (you Mathematiciens, Mechaniciens, and Philosophers, Charitable and discrete) to deale in my

behalf, with the light &amp; vntrue tounged, my enuious Aduersaries, or Fond frends. And farther, I would wishe, that at leysor, you would consider, how Basilius Magnus, layeth Moses and Daniel, before the eyes of those, which count all such Studies Philosophicall (as mine hath bene) to be vngodly, or vnprofitable. Waye well S. Stephen his witnesse of Moses.

You see this Philosophicall Power &amp; Wisedome, which Moses had, to be nothing misliked of the Holy Ghost. Yet Plinius hath recorded, Moses to be a wicked Magicien. And that (of force) must be, either for this Philosophicall wisedome, learned, before his calling to the leading of the Children of Israel: or for those his wonders, wrought before King Pharao, after he had the conducting of the Israelites. As concerning the first, you perceaue, how S. Stephen, at his Martyrdome (being full of the Holy Ghost) in his Recapitulation of the olde Testament, hath made mention of Moses Philosophie: with good liking of it: And Basilius Magnus also, auoucheth it, to haue bene to Moses profitable (and therefore, I say, to the Church of God, necessary). But as cōcerning Moses wonders, done before King Pharao: God, him selfe, sayd: Vide vt omnia ostenta, quae posui in manutua, facias coram Pharaone. See that thou do all those wonders before Pharao, which I haue put in thy hand. Thus, you euidently perceaue, how rashly, Plinius hath slaundered Moses,

But, much more, ought they  to beware of forging, deuising, and imagining monstrous feates, and wonderfull workes, when and where, no such were done: no, not any sparke or likelihode, of such, as they, without all shame, do report. And (to conclude) most of all, let  them be ashamed of Man, and afraide of the dreadfull and Iuste Iudge: both Folishly or Maliciously to deuise: and then, deuilishly to father their new fond Monsters on me: Innocent, in hand and hart: for trespacing either against the lawe of God, or Man, in any my Studies or Exercises, Philosophicall, or Mathematicall: As in due time, I hope, will be more manifest.
            NOw end I, with Archemastrie. Which name, is not so new, as this Arte is rare. For an other Arte, vnder this, a degree (for skill and power) hath bene indued with this English name before. And yet, this, may serue for our purpose, sufficiently, at this present. This Arte, teacheth to bryng to actuall experience sensible, all worthy conclusions by all the Artes Mathematicall purposed, &amp; by true Naturall Philosophie concluded: &amp; both addeth to them a farder scope, in the termes of the same Artes, &amp; also by hys propre Method, and in peculier termes, procedeth, with helpe of the foresayd Artes, to the performance of complet Experiēces, which of no particular Art, are hable (Formally) to be challenged. If you remember, how we considered Architecture, in respect of all common handworkes: some light may you haue, therby, to vnderstand the Souerainty and propertie of this Science. Science I may call it, rather, then an Arte: for the excellency and Mastershyp it hath, ouer so many, and so mighty Artes and

Sciences. And bycause it procedeth by Experiences, and searcheth forth the causes of Conclusions, by Experiences: and also putteth the Conclusions them selues, in Experience, it is named of some, Scientia Experimentalis. The Experimentall Science. Nicolaus Cusanus termeth it so, in hys Experimentes Statikall, And an other Philosopher,
               
                  R. B.
                of this land Natiue (the floure of whose worthy fame, can neuer dye nor wither) did write therof largely, at the request of Clement the sixt. The Arte carrieth with it, a wonderfull Credit: By reason, it certefieth, sensibly, fully, and completely to the vtmost power of Nature, and Arte. This Arte, certifieth by Experience complete and absolute: and other Artes, with their Argumentes, and Demonstrations, persuade: and in wordes, proue very well their Conclusions. ☞ But wordes, and Argumentes, are no sensible certifying: nor the full and finall frute of Sciences practisable. And though some Artes, haue in them, Experiences, yet they are not complete, and brought to the vttermost, they may be stretched vnto, and applyed sensibly. As for example: the Naturall Philosopher disputeth and maketh goodly shew of reason: And the Astronomer, and the Optical Mechanicien, put some thynges in Experience: but neither, all, that they may: nor yet sufficiently, and to the vtmost, those, which they do, There, then, the Archemaster steppeth in, and leadeth forth on, the Experiences, by order of his doctrine Experimentall, to the chief and finall power of Naturall and Mathematicall Artes. Of two or three men, in whom, this Description of Archemastry was Experimentally, verified, I haue read and hard: and good record, is of their such perfection. So that, this Art, is no fantasticall Imagination: as some Sophister, might, Cum suis Insolubilibus, make a slorish: and dassell your Imagination: and dash your honest desire and Courage, from beleuing these thinges, so vnheard of, so meruaylous, &amp; of such Importance. Well: as you will. I haue forewarned you. I haue done the part of a frende: I haue discharged my Duety toward God: for my small Talent, at hys most mercyfull handes receiued. To this Science, doth the Science Alnirangiat, great Seruice. Muse nothyng of this name. I chaunge not the name, so vsed, and in Print published by other: beyng a name, propre to the Science. Vnder this, commeth Ars Sintrillia, by Artephius, briefly written. But the chief Science, of the Archemaster, (in this world) as yet knowen, is an other (as it were) OPTICAL Science: wherof, the name shall be told (God willyng) when I shall haue some, (more iust) occasion, therof, to Discourse.
            Here, I must end, thus abruptly (Gentle frende, and vnfayned louer of honest and necessary verities.) For, they, who haue (for your sake, and vertues cause) requested me, (an old forworne Mathematicien) to take pen in hand: (through the confidence they reposed in my long experience: and tryed sincerity) for the declaryng and reportyng somewhat, of the frute and commodity, by the Artes Mathematicall, to be atteyned vnto: euen they, Sore agaynst their willes, are forced, for sundry causes, to satiffie the workemans request, in endyng forthwith: He, so feareth this, so new an attempt, &amp; so costly: And in matter so slenderly (hetherto) among the common Sorte of Studentes, considered or estemed.
            And where I was willed, somewhat to alledge, why, in our vulgare Speche, this part of the Principall Science of Geometrie, called Euclides Geometricall Elementes, is published, to your handlyng: being vnlatined people, and not Vniuersitie Scholers: Verily, I thinke it nedelesse.

                     y partes, is called quantitie. But a point, although it pertayne to quantitie, and hath his beyng in quantitie, yet is it no quantitie, for that it cannot be deuided. Because (as the definition saith) it hath no partes into which it should be deuided. So that a pointe is the least thing that by minde and vnderstanding can be imagined and conceyued: then which, there can be nothing lesse, as the point A in the margent.

                      measured &amp; made known. There are also, according

to these three dimensions, three kyndes of continuall quantities: a lyne, a superficies, or plaine, and a body. The first kynde, namely, a line is here defined in these wordes, A lyne is length without breadth. A point, for that it is no quantitie nor hath any partes into which it may be deuided, but remaineth indiuisible, hath not, nor can haue any of these three dimensions. It neither hath length, breadth, nor thickenes. But to a line, which is the first kynde of quantitie, is attributed the first dimension, namely, length, and onely that, for it hath neither breadth nor thicknes, but is conceaued to be drawne in, length onely, and by it, it may be deuided into partes as many as ye list, equall, or vnequall. But as touching breadth it remaineth indiuisible. As the lyne AB, which is onely drawen in length, may be deuided in the pointe C equally, or in the

point D vnequally, and so into as many partes as ye list. There are also of diuers other geuen other definitions of a lyne; as these which follow.

                  For a line hath his beginning from a point, and likewise endeth in a point: so that by this also it is manifest, that pointes, for their simplicitie and lacke of composition, are neither quantitie, nor partes of quantitie, but only the termes and endes of quantitie. As the pointes A, B, are onely the endes of the line AB, and no partes thereof. And herein differeth a poynte in quantitie,

                        A poynt is no part of quantitie.
                      or of a lyne

                      neither is a lyne composed of pointes, as number is of vnities. For things indiuisible being neuer so many added together, can neuer make a thing diuisible, as an instant in time, is neither tyme, nor part of tyme, but only the beginning and end of time, and coupleth &amp; ioyneth partes of tyme together.
               
               
                  
                     
                        Definition of a right line.
                     
                     4 A right lyne is that which lieth equally betwene his pointes.
                  As the whole line AB lyeth straight and equally betwene the poyntes AB without any going vp or comming downe on eyther side.
                  
                     
                        Definition of a right line after Campanus.
                     Campanus and certain others, define a right line thus:

                  
                  
                     A right line is the shortest extension or draught, that is or may be from one poynt to an other. Archimedes defineth it thus.
                  
                     
                        Definitiō therof after Archimedes.
                     A right line is the shortest of all lines, which haue one and the self same limites or endes: which is in maner al one with the definitiō of Campanus. As of all these lines ABC, ADC, AEC, AFC, which are all drawen from the point A, to the

poynte 
                        ••
                      as Campanus speaketh, or which haue the self same limites or endes, as Archimedes speaketh, the lyne ABC, beyng a right line, is the shortest.
                  
                     
                        Definitiō therof after Plato.
                     Plato defineth a right line after this maner: A right line is that whose middle part shadoweth the ex
                           •

                        . As if you put any thyng in the middle of a right lyne, you shall not see from the one ende to the other, which thyng happeneth not in a crooked lyne. The Ecclipse of the Sunne (say Astronomers) then happeneth, when the Sunne, the Moone, &amp; our eye are in one right line. For the Moone then being in the midst betwene vs and the Sunne, causeth it to be darkened. Diuers other define a right line diuersly,
                        An other definition.
                      as followeth.
                  
                     A right lyne is that which standeth firme betwene his extremes.
                  
                  
                     
                        An other.
                     Agayne, A right line is that which with an other line of lyke forme cannot make a figure.
                  
                  
                     Agayne,
                        An other.
                      
                     A right lyne is that which hath not one part in a plaine superficies, and an other erected on high.
                  
                  Agayne,
                        An other.
                      
                     A right lyne is that, all whose partes agree together with all his other partes.
                  
                  Agayne,
                        An other.
                      
                     A right lyne is that, whose extremes abiding, cannot be altered.
                  
                  
                     Euclide doth not here define a crooked lyne,
                        VVhy Euclide here defineth not a crooked lyne.
                      for it neded not. It may easely be vnderstand by the definition of a right lyne, for euery contrary is well manifested &amp; set forth by hys contrary. One crooked lyne may be more crooked then an other, and from one poynt to an other may be drawen infinite crooked lynes: but one right lyne cannot be righter then an other, and therfore from one point to an other, there may be drawen but one tight lyne. As by figure aboue set, you may see.
               
               
                  
                     5 A superficies is that, which hath onely length and breadth.
                        Definition of a superficies.
                     
                  
                  A superficies is the second kinde of quantitie, and to it are attributed two 
                        •
                     imensions, namely length, and breadth.
                        A superficies may be deuided two wayes.
                      As in the superficies ABCD.
                     
whose length is taken by the lyne AB, or CD, and breadth by the lyne AC. or BD: and by reason of those two dimensions a superficies may be deuided two wayes, namely by his length, and by hys breadth, but not by thicknesse, for it hath none. For, that is attributed onely to a body, which is the third kynde of quantitie, and hath all three dimensions, length, breadth, and thicknes, and may be deuided according to any of them.
                  Others define a superficies thus:
                        An other definition of a superficies.
                      
                     A superficies is the terms or ende of a body. As a line is the ende and terme of a superficies.
               
               
                  
                     6 Extremes of a superficies, are lynes.
                        The extremes of a superficies.
                     
                  
                  As the endes, limites, or borders of a lyne, are pointes, inclosing the line: so are lines the limites, borders, and endes inclosing a superficies. As in the figure aforesayde you maye see the superficies inclosed with foure lynes. The extremes or limites of a bodye, are superficiesles. And therfore a superficies is of some thus defined:
                        Another definition of a superficies.
                      
                     A superficies is that, which endeth or inclose
                           •
                        h a body: as is to be sene in the sides of a die, or of any other body.
               
               
                  
                     7 A plaine superficies is that, which lieth equally betwene his lines.
                        Definition of a plaine superficies.
                     
                  
                  As the superficies ABCD lyeth equally and smoothe betwene

the two lines AB, and CD: or betwene the two lines AC, and BD: so that no part therof eyther swelleth vpward, or is depressed downward. And this definitiō much agreeth with the definition of a right line. A right line lieth equally betwene his points, and a plaine superficies lyeth equally betwene his lynes. Others define a plaine superficies after this maner:
                  
                     A plaine superficies is the shortest extension or dr
                           •
                        ught from one lyne to an other:
                     
                        Another definition of a playne superficies.
                      like as a right lyne is the shortest extension or draught from one point to an other.
                  
                     Euclide also leaueth out here to speake of a crooked and hollow superficies, because it may easely be vnderstand by the diffinition of a plaine superficies, being hys contrary. And euen as from one point to an other may be drawen infinite crooked lines, &amp; but one right line, which is the shortest: so from one lyne to an other may be drawen infinite croked superficiesses, &amp; but one plain superficies, which is the shortest. Here must you consider when there is in Geometry mention made of pointes,
                        NOTE.
                      lines, circles, triangles, or of any other figures, ye may not conceyue of them as they be in matter, as in woode, in mettall, in paper, or in any such lyke, for so is there no lyne, but hath some breadth, and may be deuided
                        •
                      nor points, but that shal haue some partes, and may also be deuided, and so of others. But you must conceiue them in mynde, plucking them by imagination from all matter so shall ye vnderstande them truely and perfectly, in their owne nature as they are defined. As a lyne to be long, and not broade: and a poynte to

be so little, that it shall haue no part at all.
                  
                     
                        Another definition of a playne superficies.
                     Others otherwyse define a playne superficies: A plaine superficies is that, which is firmly set betwene his extremes, as before was sayd of a right lyne.
                  
                     
                        An other definition.
                     Agayne, A plaine superficies is that, vnto all whose partes a right line may well be applied.
                  
                  
                     
                        An other definition.
                     Again, A plaine superficies is that, which is the shortest of al superficies, which haue one &amp; the self extremes: As a rig

                        An other definition.
                     Againe, A playne superficies is that, whose middle darkeneth the extremes, as was also sayd of a right lyne.
               
               
                  
                     
                        Definition of a playne angle.
                     
                     8 A plaine angle is an inclination or bowing of two lines the one to the other and the one touching the other, and not beyng directly ioyned together.
                  As the

two lines AB, &amp; BC, incline the one to the other, and touch the one the other in the point B, in which point by reason of the inclination of the sayd lines, is made the angle ABC. But if the two lines which touch the one the other, be without all inclination of the one to the other, and be drawne directly the one to the other, then make they not any angle at all, as the lines CD, and DE, touch the one the other in the point D, and yet as ye see they make no angle.

                     9 And if the lines which containe the angle be right lynes, then is it called a rightlyned angle.
                  As the angle ABC, in the former figures, is a rightlined angle, because it is contained of right lines: where note, that an angle is for the most part described by thre letters, of which the second or middle letter representeth the very angle, and therfore is set at the angle.
                  By the contrary, a crooked lyned angle, is that which is contained of crooked lines, which may be diuersly figured. Also a mixt angle is that which is caused of them both, namely, of a right line and a crooked, which may also be diuersly figured, as in the figures before set ye may see.

                        •
                      then either of those angles is a right angle. And the right lyne which standeth erected, is called a perpendiculer line to that vpon which it standeth.
                  As vpon the right line CD, suppose there do stand an other line

                     AB, in such sort, that it maketh the angles on either side therof equall: namely, the angle ABC on the one side equall to the angle ABD on the other side: then is eche of the two angles ABC, and ABD a right angle, and the line AB, which standeth erected vpon the line CD, without inclination to either part is a perpendicular line, commonly called among artificers a plumbe lyne.

                     11 An obtuse angle is that which is greater then a right angle.
                  
                     As the angle CBE in the example is an obtuse angle, for it is

greater then the angle ABC, which is a right angle, because it contayneth it, and containeth moreouer the angle ABE.

                  As the angle EBD in the figure before put is an acute angle, for that it is lesse then the angle ABD, which is a right angle, for the right angle containeth it, and moreouer the angle ABE.

                        The limite of any thing.
                     
                  
                  For as much as of thinges infinite (as Plato saith) there is no science,
                        No science of thinges infinite
                      therefore must magnitude or quantitie (wherof Geometry entreateth) be finite, and haue borders and limites to inclose it, which are here defined to be the endes therof. As a point is the limite or terme of a line, because it is thend therof: A line likewise is the limite &amp; terme of a superficies: and likewise a superficies is the limite and terme of a body, as is before declared.

                     15 A circle is a plaine figure, conteyned vnder one line, which is called a circumference,

                  As the figure here set is a plaine figure, that is a figure without grossenes or thicknes, and is also contayned vnder one line, namely, the crooked lyne

                     B CD, which is the circumference therof, it hath moreouer in the middle therof a point, namely, the point A, from which, all the lynes drawen to the superficies, are equal

                  For the more easy declaration, that all the lines drawen from the centre of the circle to the circumference, are equall, ye must note, that although a line

be not made of pointes: yet a point, by his motion or draught, describeth a line. Likewise a line drawen, or moued, describeth a superficies

Now thē imagine the line AB, (the point A being fixed) to be moued about in a plaine superficies, drawing the point B continually about the point A, till it returne to the place where it began first to moue: so shall the point B, by this motion, describe the circumference of the circle, and the point A being fixed, is the centre of the circle. Which in

all the time of the motion of the line, had like distance: from the circumference, namely, the length of the line AB. And for that al the lines drawn from the centre to the circumference are described of that line, they are also equal vnto it, &amp; betwene thēselues.

For if a line drawen by the centre, do not deuide a circle into two equall partes; all the lines drawen from the centre to the circumference should not be equall.

is greater then halfe a circle, and the figure ADC, is also a section of a circle, and is lesse then a semicircle. A section, portion, or part of a circle is all one, and signifieth such a part which is either more or lesse, then a semicircle: so that a semicircle is not here called a section or portion of a circle. A right lyne drawen from one side of the circumference of a circle to the other, not passyng by the centre, deuideth the circle into two vnequall partes, which are two sections, of which that which contayneth the centre is called th

                      an equilatre triangle is that, which hath three equall sides.
                  Triangles haue their differences partly of their sides, and

partly of their angles. As touching the differences of their sides, there are three kindes. For either all thre sides of the triangle are equall, or two onely are equall, &amp; the third vnequal: 
                        〈…〉
                      three are unequall the one to the other. The first kind of triangles, namely, that which hath three equall sides, is most simple, and easiest to be knowen: and is here first defined, and

is called an equilater triangle, as the triangle A in the example, all whose sides are of one length.

                  The second kinde of triangles

hath two sides of one length, but the third side is either longer or shorter thē the other two, as are the triangles here figured, B, C, D
                  
                  In the triangle B, the two sides AE and EF are equal the one to the other, and the side AE, is lō
                     ger then any of them both: Likewise in the triangle C the two sides GH and HK, are

                        •
                     
                     quall, and the side LN is shorter.

                     26. Scalenum is a triangle, whose three sides are all vnequall.
                  As are the triangles E, F, in which there is no

one side equall to any of the other. For in the triangle E, the side AC is greater then the side BC, and the side BC is greater thē the side AB. Likewise in the triangle F, the side DH, is greater thē the side DG, and the side DG, is greater then the side GH.

                     27. Againe of triangles, an Orthigonium or a rightangled triangle, is a triangle which hath a right angle.
                  As there are three kindes of triangles, by reason of the diuersitie

of the sides, so are there also three kindes of triangles, by reason of the varietie of the angles. For euery triangle either containeth one right angle, &amp; two acute angles: or one obtuse angle, &amp; two acute: or three acute angles: for it is impossible that one triangle should contain
                        •
                      two obtuse angles, or two right angles, or one obtuse angle, and the other a right angle. All which kindes are here defined. First a rightangled triangle whiche hath in it a right angle. As the triangle BCD, of which the angle BCD, is a right angle.

                     28. An ambligonium or an obtuse angled triangle, is a triangle which hath an obtuse angle.
                  As is the triangle B, whose angle AC

D, is an obtuse angle, and is also a Scalenon, hauing his three sides vnequall: the triangle E, is likewise an Ambligonion, whose angle FGH, is an obtuse angle, &amp; is an Isosceles, hauing two of his sides equall, namely FG and GH.
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        An Oxigonium triangle.
                     
                     29. An oxigonium or an acute angled triangle, is a triangle which hath all his three angles acute.
                  
                     As the triangles A, B, C, in the example, al

whose angles are acute: of which A is an equilater triangle, B, an Isosceles, and C a Scalenon. An equilater triangle is most simple, and hath one vniforme construction, and therfore all the angles of it are equall, and neuer hath in it either a right angle, or an obtuse: but the angles of an Isosceles or a Scalenon, may diuersly

vary. It is also to be noted that in comparison of any two sides of a triangle, the third is called a base. As of the triangle ABC in respect of the two lines AB and AC, the line BC, is the base: and in respect of the two sides AC and CB, the line AB, is the base, and likewyse in respect of the two sides CB &amp; BA, the line AC, is the base.

                      a quadrate or square is that, whose sydes are equall, and his angles right.
                  As triangles haue their difference and varietie by reason of their

sides and angles: so likewise do figures of foure sides, take their varietie and difference partly by reason of their sides, &amp; partly by reason of their angles, as appeareth by their definitions. The four sided figure ABCD is a square or a quadrate, because it is a right angled figure, al hys angles are right angles, and also all his four sides are equall.

                      or squarelike, or as some call it, a long square, is that which hath right angles, but hath not equall sydes.
                  This figure agreeth with a square touching his angles, in

that either of them hath right angles, and differeth from it onely by reason of his sides, in that the sides therof be not equall, as are the sides of a square. As in the example, the angles of the figure ABCD, are right angles, but the two sides thereof AB, and CD, are longer then the other two sides AC, &amp; BD.

lines, but differeth from it in that it hath not right angles, as hath the square. As of this figure, the foure lines AB, BC, CD, DA, be equall, but the angles therof are not right angles. For the two angles ABC and ADC, are obtuse angles, greater then right angles, &amp; the other two angles BAD and BCD, are two acute angles lesse then two right angles. And these foure angles are yet equall to foure right angles: for, as much as the acute angle wa

equall, but the two sides AB and CD, being opposite the one to the other, also the other two sides AC and BD, being also opposite, are equall the one to the other. Likewise the angles are not right angles, but the angles CAB, and CDB, are obtuse angles, and opposite and equall the one to the other. Likewyse the angles ABD, and ACD, are acute angles, and opposite, and also equall the one to the other.

                  Such are all figures, in which is obserued no equallitie of sides

nor angles: as the figures A and B, in the margēt, which haue neither equall sides, nor equal angles, but are described at all aduenture without obseruation of order, and therefore they are called irregular figures.

being in one and the selfe same superficies, and produced infinitely on both sydes, do neuer in any part concurre.
                  As are the lines AB, and CD, in the example.

                        What Peticions are.
                      which are certain general sentences, so plain, &amp; so perspicuous, that they are perceiued to be true as soone as they are vttered, &amp; no man that hath but common sence, can, nor will deny them. Of which, the first is that, which is here set. As from the point A, to the point B, who wil deny,

but easily graunt that a right line may be drawn? For two points howsoeuer they be set, are imagined to be in one and the selfe same plaine superficies, wherfore from the one to the other there is some shortest draught, whiche is a right line. Likewise any two right lines howsoeuer they be set, are imagined to be in one superficies, and therefore from any one line to any one line, may be drawen a superficies.

not graunt? For there is no magnitude so great, but that there may be a greter, nor any so litle, but that there may be a lesse. And

a line is a draught from one point to an other, therfore from the point B, which is the ende of the line AB, may be drawn a line to some other point, as to the point C, and from that to an other

As vpon the centre A, and vpon the space AB, ye may describe the circle BC, &amp; vpon the same centre, vpon the distance AD, ye may describe the circle DE, or vppon the same centre A, according to the distaunce AF, ye may describe the circle FG, and so infinitely extendyng your space.
               
               
                  
                     4 All right angles are equall the one to the other.
                  This peticion is most plaine, and offreth it selfe euen to the

                  It may euidently also be sene at the centre of a circle. For if

ye draw in a circle two diameters, the one cutting the other in the centre by right angles, ye shall deuide the circle into fowre equall partes, of which eche contayneth one right angle, so are all the foure right angles about the centre of the circle equall.

                  If the lines AB and AC, being right lines, should inclose

a superficies, they muste of necessitie bee ioyned together at both the endes, and the superficies must be betwene thē. Ioyne them on the one side together in the pointe A, and imagine the point B to be drawen to the point C, so shall the line AB, fall on the line AC, and couer it, and so be all one with it, and neuer inclose a space or superficies.

                        What common sentences are.
                     After definitions and petitions, now are set common sentences, which are the third and last kynd of principles. Which are certaine general propositiōs, commonly known of all men, of themselues most manifest &amp; cleare, &amp; therfore are called also dignities not able to be denied of any. Peticions also are very manifest, but not so fully as are the cō

                        Difference betwene peticions &amp; common sentences.
                      and therfore are required or desired to be graunted. Peticions also are more peculiar to the arte whereof they are: as those before put are proper to Geometry: but common sentences are generall to all things wherunto they can be applied. Agayne, peticions consist in actions or doing of somewhat most easy to be done: but common sentences consist in consideration of mynde, but yet of such thinges which are most easy to be vnderstanded, as is that before set.

                  SVppose that the right line geuen be AB. It is required vpon the line AB, to describe an equilater triangle, namely, a triangle of three equall sides.
                  
                     Construction.

other right line to the point B. And forasmuche as the point A is the centre of the circle CBD,
                  
                     Demonstration
                   
                  therfore (by the 15. definition) the line AC is equall to the line AB: Agayne forasmuch as the point B is the centre of the circle CAE, therfore (by the same definition) the line BC is equall to the line BA. And it is proued, that the line AC is equall to the line AB: wherfore either of these lines CA and CB, is equall to the line AB: but thinges which are equall to one and the same thing, are also equall the one to the other (by the first common sentence) wherfore the line CA, also is equall to the line CB. VVherfore these three right lines CA, AB, and BC are equal the one to the other. VVherfore the triāgle ABC is equilater. VVherfore vppon the line AB, is described an equilater triangle ABC. VVherfore vppon a line geuen not being infinite, there is described an equilater triangle, VVhich is the thing, which was required to be done.
               
               A triangle or any other rectilined figure is then said to be set or described vpon a line, when the line is one of the sides of the figure.
               This first proposition is a Probleme, because it requireth acte or doyng, namely, to describe a triangle. And this is to be noted, that euery Proposition, whether it be a Probleme, or a Theoreme, commonly containeth in it a thing geuen, and a thing required to be searched out: although it be not alwayes so. And the thing geuen,

                     The exposition.
                  The exposition is, Suppose that the right line geuen be AB, and this declareth onely the thing geuen. The determination is,

                  h to conclude that, which we first chiefly entend. And this kinde of demonstration vseth Euclide in his booke

               A demonstration a posteriori,
                  
                     Demonstration a posteriori, or resolution.
                   or resolution is, when contrariwise in reasoning, we passe from the last conclusion made by the premisses, and by the premisses of the premisses, continually ascending, til we come to the first principles and grounds, which are indemonstrable, and for theyr simplicity can suffer no farther resolution.
               A demonstration leadyng to an impossibilitie is that argument, whose cō
                  clusion is impossible:
                     Demonstration leading to an impossibility.

               Composition or the first kynde of demonstration, which passeth from the principles, may easely be sene in this first proposition of Euclide.
                     An example of composition in the first proposition.
                   The demonstration wherof beginneth thus. And forasmuch as the point A is the centre of the circle CBD, therfore the line AC, is equal to the line AB. This reason (you see) taketh his beginnyng of a principle, namely, of the definition of a circle. And this is the first reason.
                     First reason.
                   Agayne forasmuch as B is the centre of the circle CAE, therfore the line BC is equall to the lyne BA: which is the second reason.
                     Second reason.
                   And it was before proued that the lyne AC is equall to the line AB, wherfore either of these lines CA &amp; CB is equal to the lyne AB. And this is the third reasō.
                     Third reason.
                   But things which are equall to one &amp; the selfe same thyng, are also equall the one to the other. VVherfore the line CA is equal to the line CB. And this is the fourth argument.
                     Fourth reason.
                   VVherfore these three lines CA, AB, and BC are equall the one to the other which is the conclusion,
                     Conclusion.
                   and the thing to be proued.
               You may also in the same first Propositiō, easely take an exāple of Resolutiō:
                     Example of resolution in the first proposition.
                   vsing a contrary order passyng backward frō the last conclusiō of the former demonstration, til you come to the first principle or ground wheron it began. For the last argument or reason in composition, is the first in Resolution: &amp; the first in composition, is the last in resolution. Thus therfore must ye procede. The triangle ABC is contained of three equall right lines, namely, AB, AC, and BC, and therfore it is an equilater triangle by the definition of an equilater triangle: and this is the first reason.
                     First reason.
                   That the three lines be equall, is thus proued. The lines AC and CB are equall to the line AB, wherfore they are equall the one to the other: and this is the second reason.
                     Second reason.
                   That the lines AB
                     •
                   and BC, are equal is thus proued: The lines AB and AC, are drawen from the centre of the circle ACE, to the circumference of the same: wherfore they are equall by the definitiō of a circle; and this is the third reason.
                     Third reason.
                   Likewise that the lines AC and AB,

                   are

equall, is proued by the same reason. For the lines AC and AB are drawn from the centre of the circle BCD: wherfore they are equall by the same definition of a circle: this is the fourth reason or sillogisme. And thus is ended the whole resolution: for that you are come to a principle, which is indemōstrable, &amp; can not be resolued.

First for the describing of an Isosceles triangle produce the line AB on ether side,

Likewise making the centre the poynte B, describe a circle HDG, according to the quantitie of the line BD. Now thē these circles shall cut the one the other in two poyntes, which let be H, and G: And l

                     s of the line geuen be ioyned with one of the sayd sections by two right lines, which let be AG and BG. And forasmuche as these two lines AB and AD are drawen frō the centre of the circle CDE vnto the circumferēce therof, therfore ar they equal. Likewise the lines BA and BF, for that they are drawen from the centre of the circle EACF to the circumference therof, a
                        •
                     e equal. And forasmuch as ether of the lines AD and BF is equall to the line AB, therfore they are equal the one to the other. Wherfore putting the line AB cōmō to thē both, the whole line BD shalbe equall to the whole line AF. But BD is equal to BG, for they are both drawen frō the cētre of the circle HDG to the circumferēce therof. And likewise by the same reason the line AF is equal to the line AG. Wherfore by the cōmō sentēce the lines AG and BG are equal the one to the other, and either of them is greater then the line AB, for that either of the two lines BD and AF is greater then the line AB. Wherfore vpon the line geuen is described an Isosceles or triangle of two equall sides.

For let the poynte K be taken in the circumference of the circle HDG, and let it not be in any of the sections, neyther let the line DF concur with it, when it is produced continually and directly vnto the circumference therof. And draw these lines AK and BK, and the line AK shal cut the circumference of the circle HFG. Let it cut it in the poynte L: now then by the common sentence the line BK shalbe equal to the line AL, for (by the definition of a circle) the line BK is equall to the line BG, and the line AL is equall to the line AG which is equal to the line BG. Wherfore the line AK is greater then the line BK and by the same reason maye it be proued that the line BK is greater then the line AB.
                     
Wherfore the triangle ABK consisteth of three vnequal sides. And so haue ye vpon the line geuen, described all the kindes of triangles.

is required frō the point A, to drawe a right lyne equall to the line BC. Draw (by the first peticiō) from the point A to the poynte B a right line AB:

                  therfore (by the 15. definitiō) the line BC is equal to the line BG: and forasmuch as the poynt D is the centre of the circle GKL: therefore (by the same) the line DL is equall to the line DG: of which the line DA is equall to a line DB (by the propositiō going before) wherfore the residue, namely, the line AL is equal to the residue, namely, to the line BG (by the third common sentence) And it is proued that the line BC is equall to the line BG VVherfore eyther of these lines AL &amp; BC is equal to the line BG. But things which are equall to one and the same thing are also equall the one to the other (by the first commō sentence.) VVherfore the line AL is equal to the line BC. VVherfore from the poynt geuē, namely, A, is drawn a right line AL equall to the right line geuen BC: which was required to be done.
               
               Of Problemes and Theoremes
                     •
                   as we haue before noted, some haue no cases at all, which are those which haue onely one position and construction
                     •
                   and other some haue many and diuers cases: which are such propositions which haue diuers descriptions &amp; constructions, and chaunge their positions. Of which sorte is this second proposition, which is also a Probleme. This proposition hath two thinges geuen:
                     
                        Two thinges geuen in this proposition.
                     
                     
                        Power cases in this proposition.
                     
                   Namely, a pointe, and a line: the thing re
                     •
                  uired is, that from the pointe geuen wheresoeuer it be put, be drawen a line equall to the line geuen. Now this poynt geuen may haue diuers positiōs For it may be placed eyther without the right line geuen, or in some point in it. If it be without it, either it is on the side of it, so that the right line drawen from it to the ende of the right line geuen maketh an angle
                     •
                   or els it is put directly vnto it
                     •
                   so that the right line geuen being produced shall fall vpon the point geuen which is without. But if it be in the line geuen, then either it is in one of the endes or extreames thereof: or in some place betwene the extremes. So are there foure diuers positions of the poynt in respect of the line. Wherupon follow diuers delineations and constructions, and consequently varietie of cases.
               
                  
                     The first case.

                  The third case is easiest of all, namely, whē the poynt geuen is in one of the extreames. As for exāple, if it were in the point C, which

is one of the extreames of the line BC. Then

making the centre the poynt C, and the space CB describe a circle BLG: and from the centre C drawe a line vnto the circumference, which let the CL, which by the definition of a circle, shalbe equall to the line geuen, BC.

For opening the compasse to the quantitye of the line geuen, and setting on foote of it fixed in the poynt geuen and marking with the other another poynt whersoeuer it fall, &amp; so by the first peticion drawing a right line frō the one of those poyntes to the other, the sayd righte line shall be equall to the right line geuen: yet in deede is it no principle, for that it may by demonstration be proued: but principles can not be proued, as we haue before declared.

point A is the centre of ye circle DEF, therfore AE is equal to AD, but the line C is equal to the line AD. VVherfore either of these lines AE and C is equall to AD, wherfore the line AE is equall to the line C, wherfore two vnequall right lines being geuen, namely, AB and C, there is cut of from AB being ye greater, a right line AE equall to the lesse lyne, namely, to C: which was required to be done.

                   namely, two vnequall right lines: the thing required is, from the greater to cut of a line equal to the lesse. It hath also diuers cases. For the lines geuen either are distinct th'one from the other: or are ioyned together at one of their endes: or they cut the one the other, or the one cutteth the other in one of the extreames. VVhich may be two wayes. For ether the greater cutteth the lesse, or the lesse the greater. If they cut the one the other, either

                     The second case.
                  If they be ioyned together at one of their

ends, it is easie to do. For making the centre that end where they are ioyned together, &amp; the space the

               But if the one cut the other in one of the extremes.
                     The third case.
                   As for exāple: Suppose that the vnequall right lines geuen be AB and CD, of which let the line CD be the greater: And let the line CD cut the line AB in his extreame C. Then making the centre A and the space AB, describe a circle BE. And vpon the line AC describe an equilater triangle (by the

               But now let CD be lesse then AB, and let it cut AB

                     The fifth case.
                  Or it is lesse then the halfe: and then making the centre C &amp; the space CD describe a circle, which shall cut of from the line AB a line equal to the line CD.

                  Or it is greater then the half. And thē vnto the point A put the line AF equall to the line CD, by the second. And making the centre A &amp; the space AF describe a circle, which shall cut of from the line AB a line equall to the line AF, that is, vnto the line CD.
               
               
                  But if the line CD do not cut the line AB in

the midst:
                     The seuenth &amp; eight cases.
                   
                  CD shal either be the halfe of the line AB: or greater then the halfe, or lesse. If CD be the halfe of AB, or lesse then the half of AB, thē making the centre C, and the space CD describe a circle whi
                     •
                  he shall cut of from the line AB a line equal to the line CD.
               
               But if it be greater then the halfe,
                     The ninth case.
                   then againe vnto the point A put the line AF equal to the line CD (by the second propositiō:) &amp; making the centre A, and the space AF describe a circle which shall cut of from the line AB a line equall to the line AF, that is, to the line CD.
               
               But if they cut the one the other as the lines CD &amp; AB do.
                     The tenth case.
                   Thē making the cētre B &amp; the space BA describe a circle AF, &amp; draw a line from the point B to the point C, &amp; produce it to the point F. And forasmuch as the two right lines BF and CD are vnequall, and the line CD cutteth the line BF by one of his extreames, therefore it is possible to cut of from CD a line equall to the line BF. For how to do it we haue before declared, wherefore it is possible from the line CD to cut of a line equall to the line AB: or AB and BF are equall the one to the other.
               This is to be noted, that in all these cases,
                     In all these cases the construction and demō
                        stration of the first case will serue.
                   a man may both as touchyng construction and demonstration, procede as in the first case. For it is possible in any position to put to the ende of the greater lyne a line equall to the lesse lyne, and so makyng the centre the sayd ende, and the space the lesse line, to describe a circle, which shall cut of frō the greater lyne a lyne equall to the line put, namely, to the lesse line geuen, as it is manifest to see in the figures partly here vnder set, and partly in the beginning of the other side put.

and redily do this proposition, not regardyng demonstration, hee may extende his cō
                  passe accordyng to the quantitie of the lesse lyne geuen, &amp; so set on foote therof in one of the ends of the greater lyne geuen, and with the other foote marke a pointe in the said greater line, which shall cutte of from the greater line a line eq

                  all to the lesse. The easines of doing wherof may cause this proposition also to seeme vnto some to be rather a principle, then a proposition. But to that we haue before in the former proposition aunswered.
            
            
               The first Theoreme. The 4. Proposition. If there be two triangles, of which two sides of th'one be equal to two sides of the other, eche side to his correspondent side, and hauing also on angle of the one equal to one angle of the other, namely, that angle which is contayned vnder the equall right lines: the base also of the one shall be equall to the base of the other, and the one triangle shall be equal to the other triangle, and the other angles remayning shal be equall to the other angles remayning, the one to the other, vnder which are subtended equall sides.
               
                  
                  SVppose that there be two triangles ABC, &amp; DEF, hauing two sides of the one, namely AB, and AC, equall to two sides of the other, namely, to DE and DF, the one to the other, that is, AB to DE, and AC to DF: hauyng also the angle BAC, equall to the angle EDF. Then I say that the base also BC is equall to ye base EF: &amp; yt the triangle ABC, is equall to the triangle DEF: and yt the other angles remainyng are equall to the other angles remayning, the one to the other, vnder which are subtended equall sydes: that is, yt the angle ABC is equall to the angle DEF, and yt the angle ACB is equall to to the angle DFE.

                     ing to an absurditie. 
                  For the triangle ABC exactly

agreyng with the triangle DEF, and the point A being put vpō the point D, &amp; the right line AB vpon the right line DE, the pointe B also shall exactly agree with the pointe E: for that (by supposition) the line AB is equal to the line DE. And the line AB exactly agreeyng with the line DE, the right line also AC exactly agreeth with the right line DF, for that (by supposition) the angle BAC is equall to the angle EDF. And forasmuch as the right line AC is also (by supposition) equall to the right line DF, therfore the pointe C exactly agreeth with the pointe F. Againe forasmuch as the pointe C exactly agreeth with the poynte F, and the point B exactly agreeth with the point E: therefore the base BC shall exactly agree with the base EF. For if the point B do exactly agree with the point E, and the point C with the point F, and the base BC do not exactly agre wyth the base EF, then two right lines do include a superficies: which (by the 10. cōmon sentence) is impossible. VVherfore the base BC exactly agreeth wt the base EF, and therfore is equall vnto it. VVherfore the whole triangle ABC exactly agreeth with the whole triangle DEF, &amp; therfore (by the 8. common sentence) is equall vnto it. And (by the same) the other angles remayning exactly agree with the other angles remayning, and are equall the one to the other: that is, the angle ABC to the angle DEF, and the angle ACB to the angle DFE. If therfore there be two triangles, of which two sides of the one, be equall to two sydes of the other, eche to his correspondent side, and hauing also one angle of the one equall to one angle of the other, namely, that angle which is contayned vnder the equall right lines: the base also of the one shall be equall to the base of the other, and the one triangle shall be equall to the other triangle, and the other angles remainyng shall be equall to the other angles remayning, the one to the other, vnder which are subtended eqaull sydes: whiche thing was required to be demonstrated.

                     Three thinges required in it.
                   The equality of base to base: the equality of field to field: and the equality of the other angles of the one triangle to the other angles of the other triangle, vnder which are subtended equall sides.

                  VVhere as in this proposition is put this particle eche to his correspondent side, (instede wherof often times afterward is vsed this phrase the one to the other) it is of necessity so put. For otherwise two sydes of one triangle added together, may be equall to two sydes of an other triangle added together, and the angles also contayned vnder the equall sydes may be equall: and yet the two triangles may notwithstanding be vnequall.
                     How one triangle is equal to an other
                   VVhere note that a triangle is sayd to be equall to an other triangle, when the field or area of the one is equall to the area of the other. And the area of a triangle,
                     What the fielde or area of a triangle is, and so of any rectilined

                   is that space, which is contayned within the sydes of a triangle. And the circuite or compasse of a triangle is a line composed of all the sides of a triangle. And so may you think of all o

                         figure.
                   And now to proue that there may be two triangles, two sydes of one of which being added together, may be equall to two sydes o
                     •
                   the other added together, and the angles contayned vnder the equall sydes may be equall, and yet notwithstanding the two triangles vnequall. Suppose that there be two rectangle triangles: namely, ABC, and DEF, and let their right angles be BAC and EDF. And in the triangle ABC let the syde AB b
                     •
                   3. and the syde AC 4. which both added together make 7.
               And in the

triāgle DEF, let the side DE be 2. and the side DF be 5. whiche added together make also 7. &amp; so the sydes of the one triangle added together, are equall to the sides of the other triā
                  gle added together. Yet are both the triangles vnequall, and also their bases. For the area of the triangle ABC is 6 and his base is 5. And the area of the triangle DEF is 5: and his base 
                     •
                   29. So that to haue the areas of two triangles to be equall, it is requisite that all the sydes of the two triangles be equall, eche to hys correspondent syde. It happeneth also sometymes in triangles, that the areas of them beyng equall, their sydes added together shall be vnequall. And contrariwise,

their sides beyng equall, their areas be vnequall. As in these figures here put it is plaine to see. In the first

example the areas of the two triangles are equal, for they are eche 12. and the sides in ech added together are vnequall, for in the one triangle the sides added together make 18. and in the other they make 16. But in the second exāple the areas of the two triāgles are vnequal, for the one is 12. and th'other is 15. But the sides added together in eche are equall, for in eche they make 18.
               That angle is said to subtend a side of a triāgle,
                     How an angle is sayd to subtēd a side: and a side an angle.
                   which is placed directly opposite, &amp; against that side. That side also is sayd to subtend an angle, which is opposite to the angle. For euery angle of a triangle is contayned of two sydes of the triangle, and is subtended to the third side.
               This is the first Proposition in which is vsed a demonstration leading to an absurditi

                   VVhich is a demonstration that proueth not directly the thing entended, by principles, or by thinges before proued by these principles: but proueth the contrary therof to be impossible, &amp; so doth indirectly proue the thing entended.
            
            
               The 2. Theoreme. The 5. Proposition. An Isosceles, or triangle of two equal sides, hath his angles a

                   the base equall the one to the other. And those equal sides being produced, the angles which are vnder the base are also equall the one to the other.
               
                  SVppose that ABC be a triangle of two

equall sydes called Isosceles, hauing the syde AB equall to the side AC. And (by the second peticiō) produce the lines AB &amp; AC directly to ye points D &amp; E. Thē I say, that ye angle ABC is equal to the angle ACB: and ye ye angle CBD is equal to th' angle BCE. Take in the line BD a point at all aduentures,
                  
                     Construction.
                   
                  and let the

same be F, and (by the third proposition) from the greater line, namely, AE, cut of a line equall to AF being the lesse line, and

let the same be AG: and draw a right line frō the point F to the point C,

                  and an other from the point G to the point B. Now then for as muche as AF is equall to AG, and AB is equall to AC, therefore these two lines FA and AC are equall to these two lines GA and AB, the one to the other, and they containe a common angle, namely, that which is cō
                     tained vnder FAG: wherfore (by the fourth proposition) the base FC is equall to the base GB: and the triangle AFC is equall to the triangle AGB, and the other angles remaining, are equall to the other angles remaining the one to the other, vnder which are subtended equall sides: that is, the angle ACF is equall to the angle ABG, and the angle AFC is equall to the angle AGB. And forasmuch as the whole line AF is equall to the whole line AG, of which the line AB is equal to ye lyne AC, therfore the residue of the line AF, namely, the line BF, is equal to the residue of the line AG, namely, to the line CG (by the third common sentence) And it is proued that CF is equal to BG. Now therfore these two BF &amp; FC are equall to these two CG and GB the one to the other, and the angle BFC is equall to the angle CGB, and they haue one base, namely, BC, common to them both: wherfore (by the 4. proposition) the triangle BFC is equall to the triangle CGB, and the other angles remaynyng are equall to the other angles remaining eche to other, vnder which are subtended equall sides. VVherfore the angle FBC is equall to the angle GCB, and the angle BCF is equall to the angle CBG. Now forasmuch as the whole angle ABG is equall to the whole angle ACF (as it hath bene proued) of which the angle CBG is equal to the angle BCF. therfore the angle remayning: namely, ABC is equall to the angle remaining, namely, to ACB (by the third common sentence) And they ar the angles at the base of the triangle ABC. And it is proued that the angle FBC is equall to the angle GCB, and they are angles vnder the base. VVherfore a triangle of two equall sides hath his angles at the base equall the one to ye other. And those equall sides being produced, the angles which are vnder the base are also equall the one to the other: which was required to be proued.
               
               For that

this propositiō is some what hard to perceue by reason the

sides of the triangles AFC and AGB &amp; also the sydes of the triāgle BFC &amp; CGB run so one within an other, therfore I haue here put the distinctly, namely, the triangles FAC and BFC on o

               Suppose that ABC be an Isosceles triangle and in the line

                  AB take a point at all aduentures,

                   and let the same be D, And from the line AC out of a line equall to the line AD. Which let be AE. And draw these right lines BE, DC, and DE. Now forasmuch as in the triangles, ABE, and ACD, the side AB is equall to the side AC, by supposition, and the sides AD and AE are also equall by construction, and the angle at the poynt A is common to them both, therfore, by the fourth proposition, the base BE is equall to the base DC. And, by the same, the angles remayning of the one triangle are equall to the angles remayning of the other triangle. Wherefore the angle ABE is equal to the angle ACD. Againe forasmuch as in the triangles BDE, and CED the side DB is equall to the side EC, and the side BE to the side DC, and the angle DBE is equal to the angle ECD and the base DE being common to both triangles is equall to it selfe, therefore the angles remayning of the one triangle, are equall to the angles remayning of the other triangle. Wherfore the angle ED
                        •
                     
                   is equall to the angle DEC: &amp; the angle DEB is equal to the angle EDC. And forasmuch as the angle EDB is equal to the angle DEC, frō which are taken away equall angles DEB, &amp; EDC, therfore by the cō
                  mon sentence the angles remayning, namely, BDC and CEB are equall, And as it was before manifest the sides BD and DC are equall to the sides CE and EB the one to the other, that is, ech to his correspondent side: and the base BC is common to both the triangles: wherfore the angles remayning are equall to the angles remayning the one to the other, vnder which are subtēded equall sides. Wherfore the angle DBC is equall to the angle ECB. For the line DC subtendeth the angle DBC, and the line EB subtē
                  deth the angle ECB: which two lines are as we haue before proued equall. Wherfore in an Isosceles triangle, the angles at the base are equall, though the right lines be not produced.
               To proue this also, there is an other demonstration of Pappus much shorter which needeth no kind of addition of any thing at all: as followeth.
               Suppose that ABC be an Isosceles triangle,
                     An other demō

                   &amp; let the side

                  AB be equall to the side AC. Now then vnderstand this one triangle to be as it were two triangles. And thus reason. Forasmuch as in the two triangles ABC and ACB, AB is equal to AC &amp; AC to AB, therfore two sides of the one are equall to two sides of the other, ech to his correspondent side, &amp; the angle BAC is equall to the angle CAB, for it is one and the selfe same angle. Wherfore by the 4. proposition the base CB is equall to the base BC, and the triangle ABC is equall to the triangle ACB: and the angle ABC is equall to the angle ACB, and the angle ACB to the angle ABC for vnder them are subtended equall sides, namely, the lines AB &amp; AC. Wherfore in an Isosceles triangle, the angels at the base are equall.

                  SVppose that ABC be a triangle, hauing the angle ABC equall to the angle ACB. Then I say that the side AB is equall to the side AC. For if the side AB be not equal to the side AC, then one of them is greater. Let AB be the greater. And by the third proposition,

And the angle DBC is by supposytion equall to the angle ACB. VVherfore (by the 4 proposytion) the base DC is equall to the base AB: &amp; (by the same) the triangle DBC is equall to the triangle ACB: namely, the lesse triangle vnto the greater triāgle, which is impossible.

The chiefest and most proper kind of conuersion is, when that which was the thing supposed in the former proposition, is the conclusion of the conuerse and second proposition: and contrary wise that which was concluded in the first, is the thing supposed in the second As in the fifth proposition it was supposed the two sides of a triangle to be equal, the thing concluded is, that the two angles at the base are equall &amp; in this proposition, which is the conuerse therof is supposed that the angles at the base be equall. VVhich in the former proposition was the conclusion. And the conclusion is, that the two sydes subtending the two angles are equall, which in the former proposition was the supposition. This is the chiefest kind of conuersion vniforme and certayne.

VVhich happeneth in composed propositions, that is, in such, which haue mo suppositions then one, and passe from these suppositions to one conclusion. In the cōnuerses of such propositiōs, you passe from the conclusion of the first proposition, with one or mo of the suppositions of the same: &amp; conclude some other supposition of the selfe first proposition: of this kinde there are many in Euclide.

                   therfore these two lines BE &amp; BC, are equall to these two lines CF and CB the one to the other, &amp; the angle EBC is equall to the angle FCB by supposition. Wherfore (by the 4. proposition) the base of the one is equall to the base of the other, and the one triangle is equall to the other triangle, &amp; the other angles remayning are equal vnto the other angles remayning, the one to the other, vnder which are subtended equall sides

                   you may take it from the poynte A and

not from the poynt B. And yet though this supposition

also be put the selfe same absurdity will follow.
               For suppose that AC be equall to AD: and produce the line CA to the poynt E: and put the line AE equall to the line DB (by the third proposition) wherefore the whole line CE is equall to the whole line AB (by the second common sentēce) Draw a line from the poynt E to the point B. And forasmuch as the line AB is equall to the line EC, and the line BC is common to them both, and the angle ACB is supposed to be equall to the angle ABC: Wherfore (by the fourth proposition) the triangle EBC is equall to the triangle ABC, namelye, the whole to the part: which is impossible.

VVherfore the angle BCD is much lesse then the angle BDC. Againe forasmuch as BC is equall to BD, and therfore also the angle BCD is equall to the angle BDC.

                  An other demonstration after Campanus.
                  Suppose that there be a line AB, from whose ends A and B,
                     
let there be drawen two lines AC and BC on one side, which let concur in the poynt C. Then I say that on the same side there cannot be drawen two other lines, from the endes of the line AB, which shall concur at any other poynt, so that that which is drawē from the point A shall be equall to the line AC, and that which is drawen from the point B shalbe equall to the line BC. For if it be possible, let there be drawn two other lines on the selfe same side, which let concurre in the point D, and let the line AD be equall to the line AC, &amp; the line BD equall to the line BC.
                     
                        Diuers cases in this demonstration.
                      Wherfore the poynt D shall fall either within the triangle ABC, or without. For it cannot fall in one of the sides, for then a parte should be equall to his whole. If therfore it fall without
                        •
                      then either one of the lines AD and DB shall cut one of the lines AC and CB, or els neither shall cut neyther.
                        First case.
                      Firste let one cut the other and draw a right line from C to D. Now forasmuch as in the triangle ACD, the two sides AC and AD are equall, therfore the angle ACD is equall to the angle ADC, by the fifth propositiō: likewise forasmuch as in the triāgle BCD, the two sides BC and BD are equall, therfore by the same, the angles BCD &amp; BDC are also equall. And forasmuch as the angle BDC is greter thē the angle ADC,
                     
it followeth that the angle BCD is greater then the angle ACD, namely, the part greater then the whole: which is impossible.
                  But if the point D fal without the triangle ABC,
                     
                        Second case.
                      so that the lines cut not the one the other, draw a line from D to C. And produce the lines BD &amp; BC beyond the base CD, vnto the points E &amp; F. And forasmuch as the lines AC and AD are equall, the angles ACD and ADC shall also be equall, by the fifth proposition
                        •
                      likewise for asmuch as the lines BC and BD are equal, the angles vnder the base, namely, the angles FDC and ECD are equall, by the seconde part of the same proposition. And for as much as the angle ECD is lesse then the angle ACD: It followeth that the angle FDC is lesse thē the angle ADC: which is impossible: for that the angle ADC is a part of the angle FDC. And the same inconuenience will follow if the poynt D fall within the triangle ABC,

                   that the base of the one is equal to the base of th'other, is the supposition, or the thing geuē: which in the former propositiō was the conclusiō. And this, that two sides of

the one are equall to two sides of the other, is in this proposition also a supposition, like as it was in the former proposition: so that it is a thing geuen in either proposition. The conclusion of this proposition is that the angle enclosed of the two equall sides of the one triangle is equall to the angle enclosed of the two equall sides of the other triangle: which in the former proposition was one of the things geuen.
               Philo and his scholas demonstrate this proposition without the helpe of the former proposition, in this maner.
               Suppose that there be two triangles ABC and DEF, hauing two sydes of the one equall to two sydes of the other, namely, AB and AC equall to DE and DF,

                   the one to the other, &amp; the base BC equal to the base EF. And for that the base BC is equall to the base EF, therfore the one being applied to the other they agree. Place the two triāgles ABC &amp; DEF in one &amp; the self same plaine superficies, &amp; apply the base of the one to the base of the other: But yet so that the triāgle ABC be set one the other side of the right line EF, that the top of the one may be opposite to the top of the other. And in stead of the triangle ABC put the

triangle EFG as in the figure. And let DE be equall to EG, and DF to FG.
                  
                     After this demonstratiō thre cases in this proposition.
                   Nowe then by this meanes shall happen diuers cases. For the line FG may fall directly vpō the line DF, or it may so fall that it may make with the line DF an angle within the figure, or with out.
               First let it fall directlye.
                     The first case.
                   And forasmuche as the line DE is equall to the line EG, and DFG, is one righte line: therfore DEG is an Isosceles triāgle: and so, by the fifth proposition, the angle at the point D is equal to the angle at the poynt G: which was required to be proued.
               But if it fall not directly, but make with the line D

F an angle within the figure, drawe a line from D to G.
                     The second case.
                   Now forasmuch as ED and EG 
                     •
                  re equall, and the line DG is the base: therfore by the fifth propositiō, the angle EDG is equall to the angle EGD. Agayne forasmuch as DF is equall to FG, and DG is the base: therfore by the same, the angle FDG is equal to the FGD: and it was proued that the angle EDG is equall to the angle EGD
                     •
                   wherfore the whole angle EDF is equal to the whole angle FGE: whiche was required to be proued.
               But if the line FG make with the line DF an angle without the figure:
                     The third case.
                   draw a right line without the figure

from the poynt D to the poynt G. And forasmuch as DE and EG are equall, and DG is the base, therfore by the fifth proposition, the angles EDG and DGE are equall. Againe

forasmuch as DF is equall to FG, and DG is the base, therfore, by the same, the angle FDG is equall to the angle FGD. And it was proued that the whole angles EDG &amp; DGE are equall the one to the other: wherfore the angles remayning EDF &amp; EGF are equall the one to the other, which was required to be proued.

And (by the first proposition) vpon the line DE describe an equilater triangle and let the same be DFE, and (by the first peticion) drawe a right line from the poynte A to

the point F. Then I say that the angle BAC is by ye line AF deuided into two equal partes.

But (by the first proposition) the base DF is equall to the base EF: wherfore (by the 8. proposition) the angle DAF is equal to the angle FAE.

                     It is impossible to deuide an acute rectiline angle into three equall partes without the helpe of lines which are of a mixt nature.

                  or to deuide an acute angle into three equal partes, is (as saith Proclus) impossible: vnles it be by the helpe of other lines which are of a mixt nature. Which thing Nicomedes did by such lines which are called Concoide

And others did it by other meanes as by the helpe of quadrant lines inuented by Hippias &amp; Nicomedes. Others by Helices or Spiral lines inuented of Archimedes. But these are things of much difficulty and hardnes, and not here to be intreated of.
               Here against this proposition may of the aduersary be brought an 
                     An instance is an obiection or a doubt, wherby is letted or troubled the construction, or demonstration, &amp; contayneth an vnruth, and an impossibility: and therfore it must of necessity be answered vnto, and the falsehode thereof made manifest.
                   instance. For he may cauill that the hed of the equilater triangle shall not fall betwene the two right lines, but in one of them, or without them both. As for example.
               Suppose that the angle to be deuided into two

equall partes be BAC, and in the line BA take the poynt D, and vnto the line DA put the line AE equal (by the third proposition.) And draw a line frō 
                  D to E. And vpon the line DE describe (by the first) an equilater triangle, which let be DFE. Now then if it be possible that the point F do not fal betwene the lines AB &amp; AC, then it shal fal ether in the line AB or AC, or without them both. Suppose that the point F be fall vpon line AB, so that let DFE be an equilater triangle. Wherfore the line DF is equal to the line FE: &amp; the angles at the base are equall, namely, the angles EDF and DEF. Wherefore the whole angle DEC is greater then the angle EDF. Againe forasmuch as AD is equall to AE, therefore ADE is an Isosceles triangle. Wherefore (by the fifth proposition) the angles vnder the base are equall. Wherfore the angle DEC is equall to the angle EDB. But it was also greater: which is impossible. Wherfore the top of the equilater triangle cānot be in the right line AB. And in like sort also may we proue that it cānot be in the right line AC. Wherfore suppose that it be without them both, if it be possible. And forasmuch as DF is equal to FE, the angles at the base are equal, namely, the angles DEF &amp; EDF. Wherfore the angle DEF is greater then the angle EDF. Wherfore the angle DEC is much greater then the angle EDF. But it is also equal vnto it. For they are angles vnder the base DE of the Isosceles triangle ADE. Which is impossib
                     •

Again making the centre the poynt B &amp; the space BA describe an other circle: and from the cōmon sections draw the right line CD, which let cut the line AB in the poynt E. Then I say, that the right line CD deuideth the line AB into two equall partes in the point E. For draw these right lines DA, DBCA and CB. Which shal be equal the one to the other, for that they are drawne frō the centres to the circumferences of equall circles. And forasmuch as the lines CA &amp; AD are equall to the lines CB and BD, and the line CD is common to either of them: therefore, by the eight, the angle ACD is equall to the angle BCD. Again forasmuch as the line CE is common to the lines AC and CB, which are equall the one to the other, therfore these two lines AC and CE are equal to these two lines BC and CE, the one to the other, and they contayne equall angles, as it hath bene proued. Wherefore by the 4. proposition the base AE is equall to the base BE. Wherefore the line AB is deuided into two equall partes in the poynt E: which was required to be done.
               
                  By this way of deuiding a right line, into two

equall parts inuented by Apollonius, it is manifest, that if a man wil mechanically, or redely, not considering the demonstratiō, deuide the said rightline, and so any right line geuen whatsoeuer, into two equall: partes he nede onely to marke the poynts of the intersections of the circles, &amp; to draw a line frō the sayd intersections, which shall deuide the right line geuen into two equall partes: as in the figure here put.

And by the first proposition) vpon the line DE describe an equilater triangle FDE, &amp; draw a line frō F to C. Then I say that vnto the right line geuen AB, and from the poynte in it geuen, namely, C is raysed vp a perpendicular line FC. For forasmuch

as DC is equal to CE,

                  &amp; the line CF is cōmon to them both: therfore these two DC and CF, are equal to these two EC &amp; CF, the one to the other: and (by the first proposition) the base DF is equal to the base EF: wherefore (by the 8. proposition) the angle DCF is equall to the angle ECF: and they be side angles. But whē a right line standing vpon a right line doth make the two side angles equall the one to the other, ether of those equall angles is (by the. 10. definition) a right angle: &amp; the line standing vpon the right line is called a perpēdicular line. VVherfore the angle DCF, &amp; thangle FCE are right angles. VVherfore vnto the right line geuē AB, &amp; frō the poynt in it C, is raysed vp a perpendicular line CF: which was required to be done.
               
               Although the poynte geuen should be set in one of the endes of the righte line geuen, it is easy so do it as it was before. For producing the line in length from the poynt by the second peticion, you may worke as you did before. But if one require to erect a right line perpendicularly from the poynt at the end of the

lyne, without producing the rightlyne, that also may well bee done after thys maner.

And from the point D raise vp vnto the line CE a perpēdiculer line, DF, which let concurre with the line CF in the point F. And drawe a right line from F to A. Then I say that the angle at the point A is a right angle. For, forasmuch as DC is equall to CA,

Proposition) the line DF is equall to the line FA, and so the angle at the point A is equal to the angle at the point D. But the angle at the point D is a right angle. Wherfore also the angle at the point A is a right angle. Wherefore from the point A vnto the line AB, is raised vp a perpendiculer line AF, without producing the line AB. Which was required to be done.

And deuide the line DF into two equall partes in the poynt H. And draw these lines CD, CH and CF. And forasmuch as DH is equal to HF,

                   and CH is common to them both, and CD is equall to CF (by the 15. definition:) therfore the angles at the point H are equal the one to the other (by the 8. proposition:) &amp; they are side angles, wherefore they are right angles. Wherfore the line CH is a perpendiculer to the line DF. But if it happen so that the circle which is described do not cutte the lyne, but touche it, then takyng a point without the point E, namely, the point G, and making the centre the point C, and the space CG, describe a part of the circumference of a circle: which shall of necessitie cut the line AB: and so may you proceede as you did before. As you see in the second figure.

vpon the right line AB, making these angles AED, and DEB: therfore (by the same proposition) the angles AED, and DEB, are equall to two right angles: and it is proued, that the angles CEA, and AED, are also equall to two right angles. VVherfore the angles CEA, and AED, are equall to the angles AED, and DEB. Take away the angle AED, which is common to them both.

                   are apposite angles, caused of the intersection of two right lines: and are so called, because the heddes of the two angles are ioyned together in one pointe.

                     If fower right lines being drawen from one point, do make fower angles, of which the two opposite angles are equall: the two opposite lines shalbe drawen directly, and make one right line.
                  
                  Suppose that there be fower right lines AB, AC, AD, and AE, drawen from the poynt A, making fower angles at the point A: of which let the angle BAC be equall to the angle DAE, and the angle BAD to the angle CAE. Then I say, that BE and CD are onely two right lines: that is, the two right lines BA and AE are drawen directly,

and doo make one right line, and likewise the two right

lines CA and AD are drawen directly, and do make one right line. For otherwise if it be possible,

                      let EF be one right line, and likewise let CG be one right line. And forasmuch as the right line EA standeth vpon the right line CG, therefore the two angles EAC and EAG, are (by the 13 proposition) equall to two right angles. And forasmuch as the right line B A standeth vpon the right line EF: therefore (by the selfe same) the two angles EAG and FAG are also equal to two right angles. Wherefore taking away the angle EAG, which is common to them both, the angle EAC, shall (by the thirde common sentence) be equall to the angle FAG: but the angle EAC is supposed to be equall to the angle BAD. Wherefore the angle BAD is equall to the angle FAG, namely a part to the whole: which is impossible. And the sel

                     e same absurditie will follow, on what side soeuer the lines be drawen. Wherefore BE is one line, and CD also is oue line: which was required to be proued.
               
               
                  The same conuerse after Proclus.
                  
                     If vnto a right line, and to a point thereof be drawen two right lines, not on one and the same side, in such sort that they make the angles at the toppe equall:
                     
                        The same conuerse after Pelitarius, which is demonstrated directly.
                      
                     those right lines shalbe drawen directly one to the other, and shal make one right line.
                  
                  Suppose that there be a right line AB, and take a point in in C. And vnto the point in it C, draw these two right lines CD and CE vnto contrary sides, making the angles at the hed equal, namely, the angles ACD and BCE. Then I say, that the lines CD and CE are drawen directly, and do make one right line. For forasmuch as the right line CD standing vpō the right line AB, doth make the angles DCA and DCB equall to two right angles (by the 13 proposition:) and the angle DCA
                     
is equall to the angle BCE: therefore the angles DCB and BCE are equal to two right angles. And forasmuch as vnto a certayne right line BC, and to a point thereof C, are drawen two right lines not both on one and the same side, making the side angles equall to two right angles, therefore (by the 14 proposition) the lines CD and CE are drawen directly, &amp; do make one right line, which was required to be proued.
                  The same may also be demonstrated by an argument leading

to an absurditie.

the point D. Then I say, that the angle DBC is greater then either of the angles BAC and ACB. For forasmuch as the two lines AC and BC do concurre in the point C, and vpon them falleth the line AB: therefore (by the conuerse of the first peticion) the two inward angles on one and the selfe same side, are lesse

then two right angles. Wherefore the angles ABC and CAB are lesse then two right angles: but the angles ABC and DBC are (by the 13 proposition) equal to two right angles. Wherefore the two angles ABC and DBC are greater then the two angles ABC and BAC. Wherefore taking away the angle ABC, which is common to them both, there shall be left the angle DBC greater then the angle BAC. And by the same reason, forasmuch as the two lines BA and CA concurre in the point A, and vppon them falleth the right line CB, the two inward angles ABC and ACB are lesse then two right angles. But the angles ABC and DBC are equall to two right angles. Wherfore the two angles ABC and DBC, are greater then the two angles ABC &amp; ACB. Wherfore taking away the angle ABC, which is common to them both, there shal remaine the angle DBC greater then the angle ACB: which was required to be proued.

                        A Corrollary following of this proposition.
                     Of this Proposition followeth this Corrollary, that it is not possible that from one &amp; the selfe same point should be drawen to one and the selfe same right line, three equall right lines. For from one point, namely, A, if it be

possible, let there be drawen vnto the right line BD, these three equall right lines AB, AC, &amp; AD. And forasmuch as AB is equall to AC, the angles at the base are (by the fifth proposition) equall. Wherfore the angle ABC is equal to the angle ACB. Agayne forasmuch as AB is equall to AD, the angle ABD is (by the same) equall to the angle ADB: but the angle ABC was equall to the angle ACB. Wherefore the angle ACB is equall to the angle ADB: namely, the outward angle to the inwarde &amp; opposite angle: which is impossible. Wherfore from one and the selfe same point, can not be drawn to one &amp; the selfe same right line three equall right lynes: which was required to be proued.

                           ollowing also of the same.
                     By this Proposition also may this be demonstrated, that if a right line falling vpon two right lines, do make the outward angle equall to the inward and opposite angle, those right lines shall not make a triangle, neither shal they concurre. For otherwis

                      one &amp; the selfe same angle should be both greater, and also equal: which is impossible. As for example.
                  Suppose that there be two right lines AB and CD, and vpon them let the right line BE fall, making the angles ABD and CDE equall. Then I say, that the right lines AB and CD shall not concurre. For if they concurre, the foresaide angles abidyng equall, namely, the angles CDE and ABD: Then forasmuch as the angle CDE is the outward angle it is of necessitie greater then the inward and opposite angle, &amp; it is also equal vnto it: which is impossible. Wherfore if the said lines cōcurre, thē shal not the angles remayne equall, but the angle at the point D shall be encreased. For whether AB

But forasmuch as ABC is a triangle. therefore any two angles therof are (by this proposition) lesse then two right angles.

                     That which is spoken in this Proposition is to be vnderstanded in one and the selfe same triangle.
                   is to be vnderstanded in one and the self same triangle. For it is possible that one and the selfe same angle may be subtended of a greater line, and of a lesse line: and one and the selfe same right line may subtend a greater angle, and a lesse angle. As for example.
               Suppose that there be an Isosceles triangle ABC &amp;,

in the side AB take the point D at all aduentures: &amp; frō the line AC cut of (by the 3. proposition) the lyne AE equall to the line AD. And draw a right line from D to E. Wherfore the right lines DE and BC do subtend the angle at the point A, &amp; of them the one is greater, and the other lesse. And after the selfe same manner a man may put infinite right lines greater &amp; lesse, subtending the angle at the point A.
               
               Agayne suppose that ABC be an Isosceles triangle. And let BC be lesse then either of the lines BA and AC. And vpon BC describe (by the first) an equilater triangle BCD.

And it is also proued, that greater right lines &amp; lesse subtende one and the selfe same angle. But in

one and the selfe same triangle one right line subtendeth one angle, and the great right line euer subtendeth the great angle, and the lesse the lesse, as it was proued in the proposition.

                   Assumpt following.
               
                  If an angle of a triangle be deuided into two equall partes, and if the line which deuideth it being drawen to the base, do deuide the same into two vnequall partes: the sides which contayne that angle shalbe vnequall, and that shalbe the greater side, which falleth on the grater side of the base, and that the lesse which falleth on the lesse side of the base.
               
               Suppose ABC to be a triangle, and (by the 9. proposition) deuide the angle at the point A, into two equall partes, by the right line AD. And let the line AD deuide the base BC, into two vnequall partes, and let the part CD be greater then the parte BD. Then I say, that the side AC is greater then the side AB. Produce the line AD to the point E, and (by the third) put the line DE equall to the line DA. And forasmuch a
                     •
                   
                  DC is by supposition greater then DB, put (by the 3. proposition) DF equal to BD, and draw a line frō 
                  E to F, and produce it to the point G. Now forasmuch as AD is equall to ED and DB is equall to DF, therfore in the two triangles ABD, and EFD, two sides of the one are equall to two sides of the other, eche to his correspondent side. and (by the 15. proposition) they contayne equall angles, namely, the hed angles:

wherfore (by the fourth proposition)

the base BA is equall to the base BF: and the angle DEF is equall to the angle DAB. But the angle DAG is by construction equall to the same angle DAB: wherefore (by the first common sentence) the angles EAG and AEG are equall. Wherefore (by the 
                     ••
                   proposion) the side AG is equall to the side EG. Wherfore the side AC is greater then the side EG. Wherefore it is much greater then the side EF. But the side EF is equall to the side AB, as it hath bene proued. Wherefore the side AC is greater then the side AB: which was required to be proued.
               This assumpt being put, this Proposition is of Proclus thus demonstrated.
               Suppose ABC to be a triangle, hauing his angle at the point B greater then the angle at the point C.

                           •
                        .
                   Then I say that the side AC is greater then the side AB. Deuide the line BC into two equall partes in the point D, and draw a line from A to D. And produce the line AD to the point E: and put the line DE equall to the line AD, and draw a line from B to E. Now forasmuch as BD is equall to DC, and AD is equall to DE therefore in the two triangles ADC and BDE, two

sides of the one are equall to two sides of the other, ech to his correspondent side, and they containe equall angles (by the 15. proposition): wherefore (by the fourth proposition) the base BE is equall to the base AC, and the angle DBE is equal to the angle at the point C. Deuide also th'angle ABE into two equal parts by the line BF: wherfore the line EF is greater then the line FA. And forasmuch as in the triangle A
                        •
                     E, the angle at the point B is deuided into two equall partes by the right line BF, and the line EF is greater then the line AF
                  
                     •
                   therefore by the former Assumps the side RE is greater then the side BA: but the line BE is equall to the line AC. Wherfore the syde AC is greater then the side AB: which was required to be proued.

                  SVuppose that ABC be a

triangle. Then I say that two sides of the triangle ABC, which two sides soeuer be taken, are greater

side BC: and the sides AB and BC then the side AC: and the sides AC and BC then the side BA.

                  And forasmuch

as the line DA is equall to the line AC, therefore (by the 5. proposition) the angle ADC, is equall to the angle ACD. But the angle BCD is greater then the angle ACD, therefore the angle BCD is greater then the angle ADC. And forasmuch as DCB is a triangle, hauing the angle BCD greater then the angle ADC, but (by the 18. proposi
                        •
                     ion) vnder the greater angle is subtended the greater side: wherfore DB is greater then BC. But the line DB is equall to the lines AB and AC (for the line AD is equall to the line AC) wherfore the sides BA and AC, are greater then the side BC. And in like 
                        •
                     orte may we proue, that the sides AB and BC are greater then the side AC: &amp; that the sides BC and CA are greater then the side AB. VVherfore in euery triangle two sides, which two sides soeuer be taken, are greater then the side remayning

                      which was required to be demonstrated.

                  Suppose ABC to be triangle. Then I say, that the two sides AB and AC are greater then the side BC: deuide the angle at the point A (by the 9. proposition) into two equall partes by the right line AE. And forasmuch as in th
                     •
                   triangl ABE, the outward angle AEC is greater then the angle BAE (by

the 16 proposition), and the angle BAE is put to be equall to the angle EAC, therefore the side AC is greater then the side CE. And by the same reason the side AB is greater thé the side BE. For in the triangle A
                        •
                     C the outward angle AEB, is greater then the angle CAE, that is then the angle EAB
                  
                     •
                   Wherefore also the side AB is greater then the side BE. Wherfore the sides AB and AC are greater then the whole side BC. And after the same maner may you proue touching the other sides also.
               The same may yet also be demonstrated an other way.
               
                  
                     An other Demonstration.
                  Suppose ABC to be a triangle. Now if ABC be an

equilater triangle, then without doubt any, two sides thereof are greater then the third. For the three sides being equall any two sides of them are double to the third. But if it be an Isosceles triangle, either the base is lesse then either of the equall sides or it is greater. If the base be lesse, then againe two of them are greater then the thirde, but if the base be greater
                     •
                   let BC being the base of the Isosceles triangle ABC be greater thē either of the sides AB &amp; AC and from it 
                     •
                  ut of (by the 3. proposition)

a line equall to any one of the other sides, whiche let bee BE, and drawe a line from A to E. And forasmuch as in the triangle AEB, the angle AEC is an outward angle: therefore it is greater then the angle BAE (by the 16. proposition). And by the same reason, the angle AEB is greater then the angle CAE. Wherefore the angles at the point E are greater then the whole angle at the pointe A. But the angle BEA is equall to the angle BAE (by the 5. proposition) for AB is put to be equall to BE. Wherefore the angle remayning AEC is greater then the angle CAE. Wherefore also the side AC is greater then the side EC. But the side AB is equall to the side BE. Wherefore the sides AB and AC are greater then the side BC.
               
               But if the triangle ABC be a S
                     ••
                  lenum, let the side

                  AB be the greatest, and let AC be the meane, and BC the least. Wherefore the greatest side being added to any one of the two sides must 
                     •
                  edes be greater then the third. For of it selfe it is greater then any of them. But if AB being the greatest
                     •
                   you would proue the sides AC and CB to be greater then it. Then as you did in the Isoceles triangle, cut of from the greatest a line equall to one of them, and from the point C to the point of the intersection draw a right line, and reason as you did before by the outward angles of the triangle, and you shal haue your purpose.
               This proposition may yet moreouer be demonstrated by an argument leading to an absurditie, and that after this manner.
               Suppose ABC to be a triangle.

                   Then I say that the

sides AB and AC, are greater then the side BC. For if they be not greater, they are either equall or lesse. First let them be equall, and from the line BC cut of the line BE equall to the line AB (by the 3. proposition) wherfore the residue EC is equall to AC. Now forasmuch as AB is equall to BE they subtend equall angles. Likewise forasmuch as AC is equall to CE they subtend equal angles. Wherfore the angles which are at the point E are equall to the angles whiche are at the pointe A, which is impossible (by the 16. proposition).
               But now let the sides AB and AC be lesse then the

side BC, and from the line BC cut of (by the 3. proposition) the line BD equall to the line AB, and likewise frō the same line BC cut of the line CE equall to the line AC. And forasmuch as AB is equall to BD, the angle BDA also is equall to the angle BAD (by the fifth proposition). Againe forasmuch as AC is equall to CE, therefore (by the same) the angle CEA is equall to the angle EAC. Wherefore these two angles BDA and CEA are equall to these two angles BAD and EAC. Agayne forasmuch as the angle BDA is the outward angle of the triangle ADC, therefore it is greater then the angle EAC. For it is greater then the angle DAC (by the 16. proposition). And by the same reason, forasmuch as CEA is the the outward angle of the triangl
                     •
                   
                  ABE, therefore it is greater then the angle BAD (for it is greater then the angle BAE). Wherfore the angles BDA and CEA are greater then the two angles BAD and EAC. But they were also proued equall vnto them: which is impossible. Wherefore th
                     •
                   sides AB and AC are neither equall to the side BC, nor lesse then it, but greater. And so also may it be proued of the rest.
               
                  
                  
                     A briefe demonstration by the definition of a right line.
                  A man may also more briefely demonstrate this proposition by Campanus definition of a right line, which as we haue before declared is thus: A right line is the shortest extension or drawght that is or may be from one point to another. Wherfore any one side of a triangle, for that it is a right line drawen from some one point to some other one point, is of necessitie shorter then the other two sides drawen from and to the same pointes.
               
                  
                     Not all thinges manifest to the sese, are straight way manifest to reason and vnderstanding.
                  
                  Epicurus and such as followed him derided this proposition, not counting it worthy to be added in the number of propositions of Geometry for the easines thereof, for that it is manifest euen to the sense. But not all thinges manifest to sense, are straight wayes manifest to reason and vnderstanding. It pertayneth to one that is a teacher of sciences, by profe and demonstration to render a certayne and vndoubted reason, why it so appeareth to the sense

                   and in that onely consisteth science.
            
            
               The 14. Theoreme. The 21. Proposition. If from the endes of one of the sides of a triangle, be drawen to any point within the sayde triangle two right lines. those right lines so drawen, shalbe lesse then the two other sides of the triangle, but shall containe the greater angle.
               
                  SVppose that ABC be a

triangle: and frō the endes of the side BC, namely, frō the pointes B and C, let there be drawen within ye triangle two right lines BD and CD to ye point D. Then I say, that the lines BD and CD are lesse then the other sides of the triangle, namely, then the sides BA and AC: and that the angle which they contayne, namely, BDC, is greater then the angle BAC. Extend (by the second peticion) the line BD to the point E.
                  
                     Demonstration.
                   
                  And forasmuch as (by the 20. proposition) in euery triangle the two sides are greater then the side remayning, therefore the two sides of the triangle ABE, namely, the sides AB and AE, are greater then the side EB. Put the line EC common to them both. VVherefore the lines BA and AC, are greater then the lines BE and EC
                        •
                      Againe forasmuch as (by the same) in the triangle CED, the two sides CE and ED, are greater then ye side DC, put ye line DB common to them both
                        •
                      wherfore ye lines CE and ED, are greater then the lines CD and DB. But it is proued that the lines BA and AC, are greater then the lines BE and EC. VVherefore the lines BA and AC, are much greater then the lines BD and DC. Agayne forasmuch

as (by the 16. proposition) in euery triangle, the outward angle is greater then the inward and opposite angle, therefore the outward angle of the triangle CDE, namely, BDC, is greater then the angle CED. VVherefore also (by the same) the outward angle of the triangle ABE, namely, the angle CEB is greater then the angle BAC. But it is proued, that the angle BDC is greater then the angle CEB. VVherfore the angle BDC is much greater then the angle BAC. VVherefore if from the endes of one of the sides of a triangle, be drawen to any point within the sayde triangle two right lines: those right lines so drawn shalbe lesse then the two other sides of the triangle, but shall contayne the greater angle: which was required to be demonstrated.
               
               In this proposition is expressed, that the two right lines drawen within the triangle, haue their beginning at the extremes of the side of the triangle. For frō the one extreme of the side of the triangle, and from some one point of the same side, may be drawen two right lines within the triangle, which shall be longer thē the two outward lines: which is wonderfull and seemeth straunge, that two right lines drawen vpon a parte of a line, should be greater then two right lines drawen vpon the whole line. And agayne it is possible from the one extreme of the side of a triangle, and from some one point of the same side to drawe two right lynes within the triangle which shall containe an angle lesse then the angle contayned vnder the two outward lines.
               As touching the first part.
               Suppose ABC to be a rectangle

triangle, whose right angle let be at the point B. And in the side BC take a point at al aduentures, which let be D: and draw a right line frō

line AD take a point at al aduentures, which

let be E, &amp; draw a line from C to E. Now forasmuch as the line AB, is equal to the lyne BD, therfore (by the fift proposition) the angle BAD is equall to the angle BDA. And forasmuch as in the triangle EDC the angle EDB is an outwarde angle, therefore (by the 16. proposition) it is greater then the inward and opposite angle DEC. Wherefore the angle BAD is greater then the angle DEC. Wherfore the angle BAC is much greater then the angle DEC: and the angle BAC is contained of the outward right lines BA and AC, and the angle DEC is contayned of the inward right lines DE and EC: which was required to be proued.
               By meanes of this proposition

also is described that kynd of triangles, which contayneth fouresides. As for example, this figure ABC. For it is cōtained of fower sides BA, AC, CE, &amp; EB. But it hath onely three angles, one at the point B, an other at the point A, and the third at the point C. VVherefore this present figure ABC is a quadrilater triangle: which of olde philosophers hath euer bene counted wonderfull. And here is to be noted, that there is difference betwene a three sided figure, and a three angled figure. For not euery figure hauing three angles hath also onely three sides as it is plaine to see in this figure. Likewise it is not all on, a figure to haue lower sides, and fower angles. For a foure sided figure may haue onely thre angles, as in the former figure: and a foure angled figure may haue fiue sides, as in this figure folowing. And so of all other figures.

But it behoueth two of those lines, which two soeuer be taken, to be greater then the third. For that in euery triangle two sides, which two sides soeuer be taken, are

greater then the side remayning.
               SVppose that the three right

lines geuē be A, B, C: of which let two of them, which two soeuer be taken, be greater then the third, that is, let the lines A, B, be greater then the line C, and the lines A, C, then the line B, and the lines B, C, then the line A. It is required of three right lines equall to the right lines A, B, C, to make a triangle.Construction. Take a right line hauing an appointed ende on the side D, and being infinite on the side E. And (by the 3. proposition) put vnto the line A, an equall line DF, and put vnto the line B, an equall line FG, and vnto ye line C, an equall line GH. And making the centre F, and the space DF, describe (by the 3. peticiō) a circle DKL. Agayne making the centre G, and the space G H, describe (by the same) a circle HKL; and let the point of the intersection of the sayd circles be K, and (by the first peticion) draw a right line from the point K to ye point F, &amp; an other from the point K to the point G. Then I say, that of thre right lines equall to the lines A, B, C, is made a triangle KFG.Demonstration. For forasmuch as the point F is the centre of the circle DKL. therefore (by the 15. definition) the line FD is equall to the line FK. But the line A is equall to the line FD VVherfore (by the first common sentence) the line FK is equall to the line A.

But the line FG is by supposition equal to the line B wherefore these three right lines GF, FK, and KG, are equall to these three right lines A, B, C. VVherefore of three right lines, that is, KF, FG, and GK, which are equall to the thre right lines geuen, that is to A, B, C, is made a triangle KFG: which was required to be done.

And making the centre the point E, &amp; the space EG, describe a circle FG: likewise making the centre the point D, and the space DH, describe an other circle HF: which circles let cutte the one the other in the point F.

of the circle DK, therfore the line DF is equal to the line FN. And forasmuch as the point G, is the centre of the circle HL, therfore the line HG, is equall to the line GM. Wherefore these two lines DF, and GH, are equall to one line, namely, to FG. But they were put to be greater then it: for the lines DF, FG, and GH, were put to be equall to the lines A, B, C, euery two of which are supposed to be greater then the thirde: wherefore they are both greater, and also equall, which is impossible.

               The 15. Theoreme The 24. Proposition. If two triangles haue two sides of the one equall to two sides of the other, ech to his correspondent side, and if the angle cōtained vnder the equall sides of the one, be greater then the angle contayned vnder the equall sides of the other: the base also of the same, shalbe greater then the base of the other.
               
                  SVppose that there be two triangles ABC, and DEF, hauing two sides of the one, that is, AB, and AC, equall to two sides of the other, that is, to DE, and DF, ech to his correspondent side: that is, the side AB, to the side DE, and the side AC to the side DF: and suppose that the angle BAC be greater then the angle EDF. Then I saye that the base BC, is greater then the base EF. For forasmuch as the angle BAC is greater then the angle EDF,

the right line DE, and to the point in it geuē D, an angle EDG equall to the angle geuen BAC. And to one of these lines, that is, either to AC, or DF, put an equall line DG. And (by the first peticiō) draw a right line from the point G, to the point E, and an other from the point F,

                  to the point G. And forasmuch as the line AB is equall to the line DE, and the line AC to the line DG, the one to ye other, and the angle BAC is (by construction) equall to the angle EDG, therefore (by the 4. proposition) the base BC, is equall to the base EG. Agayne for as much as the line DG is equall to the line DF, ther

                      (by the 5. proposition) the angle DGF, is equall to the angle DFG. VVherefore the angle DFG is greater then the angle EGF. VVherefore the angle EFG is much greater then the angle EGF. And forasmuch as EFG is a triangle, hauing the angle EFG greater then the angle EGF, and (by the 18. pr
                        •

haue two sides of the one equall to two sides of the other, eche to his correspondent side, and if the angle contayned vnder the equall sides of the one, be greater then the angle contayned vnder the equall sides of the other: the base also of the same shalbe greater then the base of the other: which was required to be proued.
               
               In this Theoreme may be three cases.

                   For the angle EDG, being put equall to the angle BAC, and the line DG, being put equall to the line AC, and a line being drawen from E to G, the line EG shall either fall aboue the line GF, or vpon it, or vnder it. Euclides demonstration serueth,

                     Second case.
                   as in this figure here put.

Then forasmuch as the two lines AB and AC, are equal to the two lines DE and DG, the one to the other, and they contayne equall angles by construction: therefore (by the 4. proposition) the base BC, is equall to the base EG, but the base EG, is greater then the base EF: wherfore also the base BC, is greater then the base EF: which was required to be proued.
               But now let the line EG,
                  
                     Third case.
                   fall vnder the line E

F, as in the figure here put. And forasmuch as these two lines AB, and AC, are equall to these two lines DE and DG, the one to the other, and they contayne equall angles, therefore (by the 4. proposition) the base BC, is equal to the base EG. And forasmuch as within the triangle DEG, the two linnes DF and FE, are set vpon the side DE: therfore (by the 21. proposition) the lines DF and F
                        •
                     
                   are lesse then the outward lines DG and GE: but the line DG is equal to the line DF. Wherfore the line GE is greater then the line FE. But GE is equall to BC. Wherefore the line BC is greater the the line EF. Which was required to be proued.
               This third case may also another way be demonstrated.

                  K and H: and draw a line from F to G: wherefore (by the second part of the fifth proposition) the angles KFG and FGH, which are vnder the base FG

                        •
                     . Wherfore (by the 18 proposition) the sid

                  EG is greater then the side EF: but the base BC is equall vnto the base EG: Wherefore the base BC, is greater then the base EF

                   that Euclide should here in this proposition haue proued, that not onely the bases of the triangles are vnequall, but also that the areas of the same are vnequall: for so in the fourth proposition, after he had proued

the base to be equall, he proued also the areas to be equall. But hereto may be answered,
                     Why Euclide &amp;c.
                   that in equall angles and bases, and vnequall angles and bases, the consideration is not like. For the angles and bases being equall, the triangles also shall of necessitie be equall, but the angles and bases being vnequall, the areas shall not of necessitie be equall. For the triangles may both be equall and vnequall: and that may be the greater, whiche hathe the greater angle, and the greater base, and it may also be the lesse. And for that cause Euclide made no mencion of the comparison of the triangles. VVhereof this also mought be a cause, for that to the demonstration thereof are required certayne Propositions concerning parallel lines, which we are not as yet come vnto.

               The 16. Theoreme. The 25. Proposition. If two triangles haue two sides of the one equall to two sydes of the other, eche to his correspondent syde, and if the base of the one be greater then the base of the other: the angle also of the same cōtayned vnder the equall right lines

But the angle BAC is not equall to the angle EDF: for if it were equall, the base also BC should (by the 4. proposition) be equal to the base EF: but by supposition it is not. VVherfore the angle BAC is not equall to the angle EDF. Neither also is the angle BAC lesse then the angle EDF: for then should the base BC be lesse thē the base EF (by the former proposition) But by supposition it is not.

                   or vpon the line AB, or vpon the line AC. First let it fall vpon the angle A.
                  
                     First case.
                   And forasmuch as these two lines BG and BH are equall to these two lines EF and ED, the one to the other, and they contayne equall angles (by construction) namely, the angles GBH and DEF: therfore (by the 4. proposition) the base GH is equall to the DF, and the angle BHG to the angle EDF. Agayne forasmuch as the line BH is equall to the line BA (for the line AB is supposed to be equal to the line DE, vnto which line the line BH is put equal) therfore (by the 5. proposition) the angle BHA is equall to the angle BAH: wherfore also the angle EDF is equal to the angle BAH. But the angle BAC is greater then the angle BAH: wherfore also the angle BAC is greater then the angle EDF.

Agayne forasmuch as in the triangle BAH, the side BA is equal to the side BH, therfore (by the 5. proposition) the angle BAH is equal to the angle BHA. But the angle BHA is greater then the angle BHG. wherfore also the angle BAH is greater then the angle BHG. Wherfore the angle BAC is much greater then the angle BHG.

                   namely, in the point K. And agayne draw also a line from A to H. And forasmuch as BG is equall to EF, and BH, to ED, therefore these two lines BG and BH are equall to these two lines EF, and ED, the one to the other, and (by construction) they contayne equall angles, namely, the angles GBH and FED. Wherfore (by the fourth propositiō)

the base GH is equal to the base DF: &amp; th'angle

BHG is equall to th'angle EDF. And forasmuch as GH is equall to DF, and DF is equall to AC: therfore GH also is equall to AC. Wherfore HK is greater then AC, wherefore HK is much greater then AK. Wherfore (by the 18. proposition) the angle KAH is greater then the angle KHA. Agayne forasmuch as BH is equal to AB (for BH is put equall to DE, which is by supposition equal to AB) therfore (by the 5. proposition) the angle BHA is equall to the angle BAH. Wherfore the whole angle BHK is lesse then the whole angle BAK. But it hath bene pro

                  EF, produce EF to the point G, and put the line EG, equall to the line BC. Likewise produce the line DE to the point H, and put the line DH, equall to the line DF. Wherefore making the centre the point D, and the space DF, describe a circle, and it shall passe also by the point H. Let the same circle be FKH. And forasmuch as AC and AB are greater the BC (by the 20. propositiō) &amp; the lines AB &amp; AC, ar equal to the line EH, &amp; the line BC is equal to the line EG. Therefore the line EH is greater then the line EG. Wherefore making the centre the point E and the space EG describe a circle and it shall cut the line EH. Let the same circle be GK: and from the common sectiō of the circles, which let be the point K, draw these right lines KD and KE. And forasmuch as the point D is the centre of the circle HKF, therefore (by the 15. def

                  nition) the line DK, is equall to the line DH, that is vnto the line AC. Agayne forasmuch as E is the centre of the circle GK, therefore the line EK is equal to the line EG, that is, to the line BC. And forasmuch as these two lines AB and AC, are equall to these two lines DE and DK, and the base BC is equal to the base EK (for EK is equall to EG (by the 15. definition) &amp; EG is put to be equal to BC). Wherefore (by the 4. proposition) the angle BAC is equal to the angle EDK. But the angle EDK is greater then the angle EDF: wherefore also the angle BAC, i

For if the side AB be not equall to the side DE, the one of them is greater. Let the syde AB be greater: and (by the 3. proposition) vnto the line DE, put an equall line GB, and draw a right line from the point G, to the point C. Now forasmuch as the line GB,

VVherefore (by the 4. proposytion) the base GC is equall to the base DF, and the triangle GCB is equall to the triangle DEF, and the angles remay

                     ing are equall to the angles remayning vnder which are subtended equall sydes. VVherefore the angle GCB is equall to the angle DFE. But the angle DFE is supposed to be equall to the angle BCA. VVherefore (by the first common sentence) the angle BCG is equal to the angle BCA, the lesse angle to the greater: which is impossible. VVherefore the line AB is not vnequall to the line DE. VVherefore it is equall And the the line BC is equall to the line EF: now therefore there are two sydes AB and

BC equall to two sydes DE and EF, the one to the other, and the angle ABC, is equall to the angle DEF. VVherefore (by the 4. proposition) the base AC is equall to the base DF, and the angle remayning BAC is equall to the angle remayning EDF.
               
               
                  Agayne suppose that the sydes subtending the equall angles be equall the one to the other, let the syde I say AB be equall to the syde DE. Then agayne I say, that the other sydes of the one are equall to the other sydes of the other, ech to his correspondent syde, that is the syde AC to the syde DF, and the syde BC to the syde EF: and moreouer the angle remayning, namely, BAC, is equall to the angle remayning, that is, to the angle EDF. For if the syde BC be not equall to the syde EF, the one of them is greater: let the syde BC, if it be possible, be greater. And (by the third proposytion) vnto the line EF, put an equall line BH, and drawe a right line from the point A to the point H. And forasmuch as the line BH is equall to the line EF, and the line AB to the line DE, therefore these two sydes AB and BH, are equall to these two sydes DE and EF, the one to the other, and they containe

equall angles. VVherefore (by the 4. proposition) the base AH is equall to the base DF, and the triangle ABH, is equall to the triangle DEF, and the angles remayning are equall to the angle
                        •
                      remayning, vnder which ar subtēded equal sydes. VVherfore the angle BHA is equall to the angle EFD. But the angle EFD is equall to the angle BCA. VVherefore the angle BHA is equal to the angle BCA. VVherefore the outward angle of ye triangle AHC, namely, the angle BHA, is equall to the inward and opposite angle, namely, to the angle HCA, which (by the 16 proposition) is impossible. VVherfore the syde EF is not vnequall to the syde BC, wherefore it is equall. And the syde AB is equall to ye syde DE: wherefore these two sydes AB and BC, are equall to these two sydes DE and EF, the one to the other, and they contayne equall angles: VVherfore (by the 4. proposition) the base AC is equall to the base DF: and the triangle ABC, is equall to the triangle DEF, and the angle remayning, namely, the angle BAC is equall to the angle remayning, that is, to the angle EDF. If therefore two triangles haue two angles of the one equall to two angles of the other, ech to his correspondent angle, and haue also one syde of the one equall to o
                        •
                     e syde of the other, either that syde which lieth betwene the equall angles, or that which is subtended vnder one of the equall angles: the other sydes also of the one shalbe equall to the other sydes of the other, eche to his correspondent side, and the other angle of the one shalbe equall to the other angle of the other: which was required to be proued.
               
               VVhereas in this proposition it is sayde, that triangles are equall, which hauing two angles of the one equall to two angles of the other, the one to the other,

haue also one side of the one equall to one side of the other, either that side which lieth betwene the equall angles, or that side which subtendeth one of the equall angles: this is to be noted that without that caution touching the equall side, the proposition shall not alwayes be true. As for example.
               Suppose that there be a rectangle triangle ABC, whose right angle let be at the point B, &amp; let the side BC be greater thē the side BA: and produce the line AB, frō the point B to the point D. And vpō the right line

                  BC &amp; to the point in it C, make vnto the angle BAC an equal angle (by the 23. proposition), which let be BCD, &amp; let the lines BD &amp; CD, being produced cōcurre in the point D. Now thē there are two triangles ABC, and BCD, which haue two angles of the one equall to two angles of the other, the one to the other, namely, the angle ABC to the angle DBC (for they are both right angles), &amp; the angle BAC, to the angle BCD (by construction) and haue also one side of the one equall to one side of the other, namely, the side BC, which is cō
                  mon to them both. And yet notwithstanding the triangles are not equall: for the triangle BDC, is greater then the triangle ABC. For vpon the right line BC, and to the point in it C, describe an angle equall to the angle ACB: which let be FCB (by the 23. proposition). And forasmuch as the side BC was supposed to be greater then the side. AB, therefore (by the 18. proposition) the angle BAC is greater then the angle BCA, wherefore also the angle BCD is greater then the angle BCF. Wherefore the triangle BCD is greater then the triangle BCF. Agayne forasmuch as there are two triangles ABC and BCF; hauing two angles of the one equal to two angles of the other
                     •
                   the one to the other, namely, the angle ABC to the angle FBC (for they are both right angles) and the angle ACB to the angle FCB (by construction), and one side of the one is equall to one side of the other, namely, that side which lieth betwene the equall angles, that is, the side BC which is common to both triangles. Wherefore (by this proposition) the triangles ABC and FBC are equal. But the triangle DBC is greater thē the triangle FBC. Wherefore also the triangle DBC is greater then the triangle ABC. Wherefore the triangles ABC and DBC, are not equall: notwithstanding they haue two angles of the one equall to two angles of the other, the one to the other, and one side of the one equall to one side of the other.
               The reason wherof is, for that the equal side in one triangle, subtēdeth one of the equall angles, and in the other lieth betwene the equal angles. So that you see that it is of necessitie that the equall side do in both triangles, either subtend one of the equall angles, or lie betwene the equall angles.

               Suppose that there be two right lines AB and CD, and let a certayne right line EFGH cutte them in suche sorte, that

it make the angles BFG and FGD equall to two right angles. Then I say, that these right lines AB and CD are parallel lines, that is, they shall not concurre. For if it be possible, let the lines BF and GD being produced concurre in the pointe K. Nowe forasmuche as the right line EF standeth vppon the right line AB, therfore (by the 13. proposition) it maketh the angles AFE, and BFE equall to two right angles: likewise forasmuch as the line FG standeth vpō the line CD, therfore (by the same proposition) it maketh the angles CGF and DGF equall to two right angles. Wherfore the foure angles BFE, AFE, CGF, and DGF are equal to foure right angles: of which the two angles BFG and FGD are (by supposition) equall to two right angles, wherfore the angles remaining, namely, AFG and CGF are also equall to two right angles. If therfore the right lines FB and GD being produced (the inward angles being equall to two right angles) do concurre, then shall the lynes FA and GC being produced concurre. For the angles AFG and CGF are equall to two right angles. For either the right lines shall concurre on either side, or els on neither side. For that on either side the angles are equall to two right angles. Wherefore let the right lines FA and GC concurre in the point L. Wherefore the two right lines LAFK and LCGK do comprehend a space, which (by the 6. peticion) is impossible.

Wherfore it is not possible that the inward angles being equal to two right angles, the right lines should concurre. Wherefore they are parallels: which was required to be proued.

                   the one of them is greater. Let the angle AGH be greater. And forasmuch as the angle AGH is greater then the angle GHD, put the angle BGH commō to thē both. VVherfore ye angles AGH and BGH, are greater thē ye angles BGH &amp; GHD. But by ye 
                  13. propositiō ye angles AGH &amp; BGH are equall to two right angles, wherfore ye angles BGH &amp; GHD are lesse thē two right angles. But (by ye 
                  5. peticion) if vpō two right lines do fall a right line, making ye inward angles on one and ye same side, lesse thē two right angles, those right lines being infinitly produced must needes at ye length meete on the side wherin are the angles lesse thē two right angles. VVherfore the right lines AB and CD being infinitely produced will at ye length meete. But they cannot meete, because they are parallels (by supposition): wherfore the angle AGH is not vnequall to the angle GHD: wherfore it is equall.
               And the angle AGH is (by the 15. proposition) equall to the angle EGB.Second part. VVherfore (by the first common sentence) the angle EGB is equall to the angle GHD.
               Put the angle BGH common to them both: wherfore the angles EGB and BGH,Third part. are equall to the angles BGH and GHD. But the angles EGB

and BGH are (by the 13. proposition) equall to two right angles. VVherefore the angles BGH and GHD are also equall to two right angles. If a lyne therfore do fall vpō two parallel right lines: it maketh the alternate angles equal the one to the other: and also the outward angle equall to the inward and opposite angle on one and the same side: and moreouer the inward angles on one and the same syde equall to two right angles: whiche was required to be demonstrated.
               
                  This proposition is the conuerse of the two propositions next going before.

                  Suppose that there be two right lines AB and CB, which let cut two parallel lines DE and FG: and let AB cut the line DE in the point H: and let CB cut the line FG in the point K: &amp; let the lines AB &amp; CB, concurre betwene the two parallel lines DE &amp; FG in the point B: and let the angle DHB be equal

to the angle BKG: or let the angle AHD be equall to the angle BKF: or finally let the angles BHD and BKF be equal to two right angles.

                      and so shal be made the triangle BLK. Now then (by the first part of this 29. proposition) the angle DHB shalbe equal to the alternate angle GLB:
                        First part.
                      but (by supposition) the angle DHB is equall to the angle BKG. Wherefore the angle BLG is equall to the angle BKL, namely, the outward angle to the inwarde and opposite angle: which (by the 16. proposition) is impossible.
                  Moreouer (by the secōd part of this 29. propositiō) the angle AHD shalbe equal to the angle BLK,
                     
                        Second part.
                      namely, the outward angle to the inward and opposite angle on one and the same side. But the same angle AHD is supposed to be equall to the angle BKF: wherefore the angle BKF is equall to the angle BLK. Which (by the selfe same 16. proposition) is impossible.
                  Lastly forasmuch as the angles BHD and BKF are supposed to be equall to two right angles,
                        Third part.
                      &amp; the angles BHD &amp; BLK are also by the last part of this 29 proposition equal to two right angles, therefore the angle BKF shalbe equal to the angle BLK: which agayne by the selfe same 16. proposition is impossible.

AB and CD, be parallel lines to the right line EF. Then I say, that the line AB is a parallel line to CD.

                  Let there fall vpon these thre lines a right line GHK. And forasmuch as the right line GHK falleth vppon these parallell right lines AB and EF, therfore (by the proposition going before) the angle AGH is equall to the angle GHF. Agayne forasmuch as the right line GK falleth vppon these parallell right lines EF and CD, therefore (by the same) the angle GHF is equall to the angle GKD. Now then it proued that the angle AGH is equall to ye angle GHF, and yt the angle GKD is equall to the angle GHF. VVherfore the angle AGK is equall to the angle GKD. And they are alternate angles: wherfore AB is a parallel line to CD. Right lines therfore which are parallels to one and the selfe same right line, are also parallel lines the one to the other: which was required to be proued.
               
               Euclide in the demonstration of this proposition, setteth the two parallel lines which are compared to one, in the extremes, and the parallel to whome they are compared, he placeth in the middle, for the easier demonstration. It may also be proued euen by a principle onely. For if they shoulde concurre on any one side, they should concurre also with the middle line, and so should they not be parallels vnto it, which yet they are supposed to be.

parallels to the line EF: and let both the lines AB and CD, be aboue, and let the line EF be beneath, and not in the middest. Vpon which let the right line GHK fall. And forasmuch as either of the angles KHD and HGB is equall to the angle HKE, (for they ar alternate angles) therfore they are (by the first common sentence) equall the one to the other.

                     An obiection.
                  But here if a man will obiect that the lines EK and KF, are parallels vnto the line CD,
                     Answer.
                   and therefore are parallels the one to the other. VVe will answere that the lines EK and KF are partes of one parallel line, and are not two parallel

lines.
                     Parallel lines are vnderstanded to be produced infinitely.
                   For parallel lines ar vnderstanded to be produced infinitly But EK being produced falleth vpon KF. Wherefor
                     •
                   it is one and the selfe same with it, and not an other. Wherefore all the partes of a parrallel line are parallels, both to the right line vnto which the whole parallel line is a parallel, and also to al the parts of the same right line. As the line EK is a parallel vnto HD, and the line KE to the line CH. For if they be produced infinitly, they will neuer concurre.
               Howbeit there are some which like not, that two distinct parellel lines, should be taken and counted for one parallel line: for that the continuall quantity, namely, the line is cut asonder, and cesseth to be one. VVherefore they say, that there ought to be two distinct parallel lines compared to one. And therfore they adde to the proposition a correction, in this maner. Two lines being parallels to one line: are either parallels the one the other, or els the one is set directly againste the other, so that if they be produced they should make one right line. As for example.
               
               Suppose that the lines CD and EF be parallels to one and the selfe same line AB,
                  
and let them not be parallels the one to the other. Then I say, that the two lines CD &amp; EF, are directly set the one to the other. For for as much as they are not parallel lines, let them concurre in the point G, And from the point G draw a line cutting the line AB in the point H. Now by the former proposition the angles AHG &amp; HGC are equall to two right angles, but by the same propositiō, the angle AHG, is equall to the alternate angle HGE. Wherefore the angles HGC and HGF are equal to two right angles. Wherefore (by the 14 proposition) the lines CG and FG are drawen directly and make one right line. Wherfore also the lines CD and EF are set directly the one to the other: and being produced they will make one right line.

               SVppose that the point geuen be

A, and let the right line geuen be BC. It is required by the point geuen, namely A, to draw vuto the right line BC, a parallel line.Construction. Take in the line BC a point at all aduentures, and let the same be D. and (by the first peticiō) draw a right line from the point A, to the point D. And (by the 23. proposition) vpon the right line geuen AD, and to the point in it geuen A, make an angle DAE, equall to the angle geuen ADC. And (by the 14. proposition) put vnto the line AE the line AF directly, in such sorte that they

both make one right line. And forasmuch as the right line AD falling vpon the right lines BC and EF, doth make the alternate angles, namely, EAD, and ADC equall ye one to the other, therfore (by the 27. proposition) EF is a parallel line to BC. VVherfore by the point geuen, namely A, is drawne to the right line geuen BC a parallel line EAF: which was required to be done.
               
                  This proposition is to be vnderstanded of a point geuen without the line geuen, and in such sorte also, that the same line geuen being produced, doo not fall vppon the pointe geuen.
               
            
            
               The 22. Theoreme. The 32, Proposition. If one of the sydes of any triangle be produced: the outwarde angle that it maketh, is equal to the two inward and opposite angles. And the three inwarde angles of a triangle are equall to two right angles.
               
                  SVppose y• ABC be a triangle,

&amp; produce one of ye sides therof namely, CB to the pointe D. Then I say, that the outwarde angle ACD is equall to the two inwarde and opposite angles CAB &amp; ABC: and yt the three inwarde angles of the triangle, that is, the angles ABC, BCA, and CAB are equall to two right angles.
                  
                     Construction.
                   
                  For (by the proposition going before) rayse vp frō the point C, a parallel to the right line AB, and let the same be CE.
                  
                     Demonstration.
                   
                  And forasmuch as AB is a parallel to CE, and vpon them falleth the right line AC: therefore the alternate angles BAC and ACE are equall the one to the other. Agayne forasmuch as AB is a parallel vnto CE, and vpon them falleth the right line BD, therfore the outward angle ECD is (by the 29. proposition) equall to the inward and opposite angle ABC. And it is proued that the angle ACE is equal to the angle BAC: wherfore the whole outwarde angle ACD is equall to the two inward and opposite angles, that is, to the angles BAC and ABC. Put the angle ACB common to them both. VVherfore the angles ACD and ACB, are equall to these three angles ABC, BCA, and BAC. But the angles ACD &amp; ACB are equall to two right angles (by the 13. proposition): wherfore the angles ACB, CBA, and CAB are equall to two right angles. If therfore one of the sides of any triangle be produced, the outward angle that it maketh, is equall to the two inward and opposite angles. And the three inward angles of a triangle

are equall to two right angles: which was required to be demonstrated.
               
               Euclide demonstrateth either part of this composed Theoreme, by drawyng frō one angle of the triangle a parrallel line to one of the sides of the same triangle, without the triangle. Either part therof may also be proued without drawyng of a parallel line without the triangle, only chaunging the order of the thinges required or conclusions. For Euclide first proueth that the outwarde angle of a triangle (one of his sides beyng produced) is equall to the two inwarde and opposite angles: and by that he proueth the second part: namely, that the 3. inward angles of a triangle are equall to two right angles. But here it is contrariwise. For first is proued that the three inward angles of a triangle are equall to two right angles, and by that is proued the other part of the Theoreme, namely, that one side of a triāgle beyng produced, the outward angle is equal to the two inward and opposite angles. And that after this maner.
               Suppose that there be a triangle ABC

                     An other demonstration.
                   and produce the side BC to the point E. And take in the line BC a point at al auentures which let be F:

&amp; draw a line from A to F. And by the point F drawe vnto the line AB a parallel line (by the former proposition) which let be FD. Now forasmuch as FD is a parallell vnto AB, and vpon them falleth the right line AF, and also the right line BC, therfore the alternate angles are equall, and also the outward angle is equall to the inward angle. Wherefore the whole angle AFC is equall to the angles FAB and ABF. And by the same reason (if by the point F we draw a parallel line to the line AC) may we proue that the angle AFB is equall to the angles FAC, and ACF. Wherfore the two angles AFB &amp; AFC are equall to the three angles of the triangle ABC. But the two angles AFB &amp; AFC are (by the 13. proposition) equall to two right angles. Wherfore also the three angles of the triangle ABC are equall to two right angles.
               But the angles ACF and ACE are also (by the 13. proposition) equall to two right angles. Take away the angle ACF which is common, wherfore the angle remaining, namely, the outward angle ACE is equall to the two angles remaining, namely, to the two inwarde and opposite angles ABC and CAB: which was required to be proued.
               Eudemus affirmeth, that the latter part of this Theoreme, The three angles of a triangle are equall to two right angles, was first found out by Pithagoras,

                   whose demonstration thereof is thus.
               Suppose that there be a triangle ABC: and by point A, draw (by the former proposition) vnto the line BC, a parallel line, which let be DE. And forasmuch as the right lines BC and DE are parallels, and vpon them falleth

the right lines AB and AC, therefore (by the 29. proposition) the alternate angles are equall. Wherefore the angle DAB is equall to the angle ABC, and the angle EAC to the angle ACB. Adde the angle BAC common. Wherefore the angles DAB, BAC, CAE, that is, the angles DAB and BAE, namely, two angles equal to two right angles, are equal to the thre angles of the triangle ABC. Wherfore the thre angles of a triangle are equall to two right angles: which was required to be proued.
               
                  The conuerse of this proposition is thus.

                     and the line without the triangle, is drawen directly to the side of the triangle, &amp; maketh one right line with it. And if the thre inward angles of a rectiline figure be equal to two right angles, the same rectiline figure is a triangle.
                  
                  
                     
                        Demonstration of the first part of the conuerse.
                     Suppose that there be a triangle ABC: and let the outward angle ACD be equal to the two inward &amp; opposite angles ABC and CAB. Then

I say that the side BC is produced to the poynt D. And that BCD is one right line. For forasmuch as the angle ACD is equal to the two inward &amp; opposite angles, adde the angle ACB common. Wherefore the angles ACD and ACB are equal to the three angles of the triangle ABC. But the three angles of the triangle ABC are equall to two right angles Wherefore also the two angles ACD and ACB are equall to two right angles. But if vnto a right line, and to a point in the same line be drawen two right lines, not both on one and the same side, making the side angles equal to two right angles: those two right lines shal be drawē directly, and make one right line (by the 14. proposition.) Wherefore the right line BC is drawen directly to the line CD, and so is BCD one right line: which was required to be proued.
                  
                     
                        Demonstration of the second part of the conuerse.
                     Agayne suppose that there be a certayne rectiline figure ABC, hauing onely three ang

                     es, namely, at the pointes A, B, C: which angles let be equal to two right angles Then I say that ABC is a triangle. First AC is one right

line. For draw the line BD. And forasmuch as in either of the triangles ABD and DBC, the three angles are equal to two right angles, of which the angles at the points A, B, C, are equal to two right angles. Wherefore the angles remayning, namely, ADB and CDB are equall to two right angles. Wherefore (by the 14. proposition) the line DC is set directly to the line DA. Wherefore the side AC is one right line. And in like sort may we proue that the side AB is one right line, and also that the side BC is one right line. Wherefore the figure ABC is a triangle: which was required to be proued.
                  
                     
                        A Corrollary.
                     By the secōd part of this 29. propositiō, namely, three angles of a triangle are equall to two right angles, may easely be knowen, to how many right angles, the angles within any figure hauing right lines and many angles are equall. As are figures of fower angles, of fiue angles, of sixe angles, and so consequently: and infinitly, And this is to be noted, that euery right lined figure is resolued into triangle, For that a triangle is the first of all figures.
                        
                           Euery right lined figure is resolued in triangles.
                        
                        
                           A triangle is the first of all figures.
                        
                        
                           Into how many triangles a figure may be resolued.
                        
                      For two lines accomplish no figures VVher
                        •
                     ore how many sides the figure hath, into so many triangles may it be resolued, sauing two. As if the figure haue fower sides, it is resolued into two triangles, if it haue fiue sides, into 3. triangles: if 6 sides into 4. triangles, and so consequently, and infinitly. And it is proued that the three angles of euery triangle are equall to two right angles. VVherefore if you multiply the number of the triangles, into which the figure is resolued, by two, you shall haue the number of right angles, to which the angles of the figure are equall. So the angles of euery qua
                        •
                     rangled figure are equall to 4. right angles. For it is composed of two triangles. And the angles of a fiue angled figure are equal to 6. right angles, for it is composed of three triangles, and so forth in like order.
                  The rediest and aptest maner to reduce any rectiline figure into triangles, is

thus. From any one angle of the figure to euery other angle (of the same) beyng opposite vnto it, drawe a right line, so shall you haue all the triangles of that figure described.

In a quadrāgle, from one angle you can drawe but one lyne to the opposite angle, by which it is deuided into two triangles only. In a pentagon figure, from one angle you may draw lines to two opposite angles, and so you shal haue three triangles. In an Hexagon, you may from one angle draw lines to thre opposite angles, and so shall you haue 4. triangles. In an heptagon, from one angle may be drawne lines to foure opposite angles, and so shal there be fiue triangle. And so consequently of the rest. As you see in the figures here set.
                  This thing may also be thus expressed. In any figure of many sides,

                           quall.
                      the number of the angles of the figure doubled, is the nūber of the right angles to which the angles of the figure are equall, sauing foure, As for example.
                  Let there be an hexagon figure ABCDEF, and within it take a point at all

auentures, namely, G. And draw from the same point to euery one of the angles a right line, &amp; so shal there be comprehended in the figure so many triangles, as there are angles in the same. VVherefore by this 32. proposition all the angles of these triangles taken together, are equall to double so many right angles, as there be angles in the figure. VVherefore forasmuch as there are sixe triangles, there are twelue right angles. But all the angles at the point G are equall to 4. right angles by the 13. proposition. VVherefore take away foure out of twelue, and there rest eight. VVherfore the sixe angles in the Hexagon figure are equall to eight right angles.
                  By that which hath now bene declared,
                        Another expression of the former Corollary.
                      it foloweth that all the angles of any figure hauing many sides, takē together, are equal to twise so many right angles, as the figure is in the reaw or order of figures. A triāgle is the first figure in order,
                        A triangle the first figure in order.

                      his angles are equal to two right angles, which are twise one. A quadrangle is the second figure in order.
                        A quadrangle the second, and so consequently. How the order of figures is gathered.
                      VVherfore his angles are equal to fower right angles, which are twise two. The order of figures is gathered of the sides. For if you take two from the number of the sides of a figure, the number of the sides remayning, is the number of the order of the figure. As if you will know, how many in order is a figure of sixe sides: from six (which is the number of this sides) take a way two, and there will remaine foure. VVherfore a figure of sixe sides is the fourth figure

in the order of figures. Then double foure, so shall you haue eight. VVherefore the angles therof are equall to eight right angles. And so of all other figures.
                  
                     
                        An other Corrollary.
                     Hereby also it is manifest, that the outward angles of any figure of many sides taken together, are equall to foure right angles. For the inwarde angles together with the outward angles, are equall to twise so many right angles, as there be angles in the figure (by the 13. proposition) But the inward angles are equal to twise so many right angles, as there be angles in the figure, sauyng foure
                        •
                      as it was before declared. VVherfore the outward angles are always equal to foure right angles. As for example.
                  Suppose that there be a pentagon, ABCDE. And produce the fiue sides therof to the points F, G, H, K, L. Now (by the 13.

propositiō) the two angles at the point A shall be equal to two rightangles. And (by the same) the two angles at the pointe B shall be also equall to two right angles. And so taking euery two angles, they shall be in all equall to tenne right angles. VVherfore takyng away the inward angles, whiche (as hath before bene proued) are equall to sixe righte angles, the outward angles shall be equall to fower right angles. And so of all other figures
                        •
                     
                  
                  
                     
                        An other Corrollary.
                     It is also manifest, that euery pentagō, which is so described, that ech side therof deuideth two of the other sides, hath his fiue angles equall to two right angles.
                  For suppose that ABCDE: be such a pentagon as is there required so that let the side AC cut the side BE in the point G: &amp; let the side AD, cut

the same side BE in the point F. Now thē by this proposition the angle AFG shal be equall to the two angles at the point B and D: namely, the outward angle to the two inward and opposite angles. And by the same reason the angle FGA is equal to the angles at the points C and E which are in the triangle CEG. But the two angles AFG and FGA, together with the angle at the point A, are equall to two right angles (by this proposition). Wherefore the fower angles at the pointes, B, C, D, E, together with the angle at the point A, are equal to two right angles: which was required to be proued.
                  
                     
                        An other Corrollary.
                     By this proposition also it is manifest, that euery angle of an equilate triangle is two third partes of a right angle. And that in a triangle of two equall sides hauing a right angle at the toppe, either of the the two angles at the base is the halfe of a right angle. And in a triangle called Sealenum, such a Scalenū (I say) which is made by the drawght of a perpendicular line from any one of the angles of an equilater triāgle to the opposite side therof, one angle is a right angle, an other is two third parts of a right angle, namely, that angle which was also an angle of the equilater triangle, wherfore of necessity the angle remaining is one third part of a right angle. For the three angles of a triāgle must be equall to two right angles.
                  
                     
                        An other Corrallory.
                     Moreouer by this proposition it is manifest, that if there be two triangles, and if two angles of the one be equal to two angles of the other: the angle remaining

shall also be equall to the angle remayning. For forasmuch as three angles of any triangle are equal to three angles of any other triangle (for that in ech the three angles are equal to two right angles)
                        •
                      If from ech triangle be taken away the two equall angles, the angle remayning shall (by the 3. common sentence) be equall to the angle remayning.
                  And here I thinke it good to shew how to deuide a right angle into three equall partes, for that the demonstration thereof dependeth of this proposition.
                  Suppose that there be a right angle ABC, contayned of the right lines AB and BC:

Then I say that the right angle ABC is deuided into thre equal parts by the right lines BE and BF. For forasmuch as EBD is an equilater triangle, therfore as hath
                        •
                      before bene declared, the angle EBD is two thirde partes of a right angle. But the whole angle ABC, is a right angle. Wherfore the angle remaining, namely, ABE is one third part of a right angle. Again forasmuch as the angle EBD, is two third partes of a right angle, and it is deuided into two equall parts by the right line BF, therefore either of these two angles EBF &amp; FBD is one third part of a right angle. Wherefore the three angles ABE, EBF and FBD are equall the one to the other. Wherefore the right angle ABC is deuided into three equall partes by the right lines BE and BF: which was required to be done.
               
            
            
               The 23. Theoreme. The 33. Proposition. Two right lines ioyning together on one and the same side, two equall parallel lines: are also them selues equall the one to the other, and also parallels.

right lines equal, and parallels: and let these two right lines AC and BD ioyne thē together, the one on the one side, and the other on ye other side.

And forasmuch as AB is a parallel to CD, and vpō them falleth the right line BC, therfore the alternate angles ABC and BCD, are equall the one to the other (by the 29. proposition). And forasmuch as the line AB is equall to the line CD, and the line BC is common to them both,

therefore these two lines AB and BC, are equall to these two lines BC and CD, and the angle ABC is equall to the angle BCD. VVherfore (by the 4. proproposition) the base BD is equall to the base AC, and the triangle ABC, is equall to the triangle BCD, and the angles remayning are equall to the angles remayning the one to the other, vnder which are subtended equall sides, wherefore the angle ACB is equall to the angle CBD, and the angle BAC to the angle BDC. And forasmuch as vpon these right lines AC and BD falleth the right line BC making the alternate angles, that is the angles ACB and CBD, equall the one to the other, therefore (by the 27. proposition) the line AC is a parallel to the line BD. And it is proued that it is equall vnto it. VVherefore two right lines ioyning together on one and the same side two equall lines which are parallels, are also themselues equall the one to the other, and also parallels: which was required to be proued.
            
            
               The 24. Theoreme. The 34 Proposition. In parallelogrammes, the sides and angles which are opposite the one to the other, are equall the one to the other, and their diameter deuideth them into two equall partes.
               
                  SVppose that ABCD be a parallelogramme and let the diameter ther
                        •
                      of be BC. Then I say that the opposite sides and angles of the parallelogramme ACDB are equall the one to the other, and yt the diameter BC deuideth it into two equall partes.
                  
                     Demonstration
                   
                  For forasmuch

as AB is a parallel line vnto CD, and vpon them falleth a right line BC: therfore (by the 29. proposition) the alternate angles ABC and BCD are equall the one to the other. Agayne forasmuch as AC is a parallel line to BD, and vppon them falleth the right lyne BC: therfore (by the same) the alternate angles, that is, the angles ACB and CBD are equall the one to the other. Now therfore there are two triangles ABC and BCD, hauing two angles of the one, namely, the angles ABC and ACB equall to two angles of the other, that is, to the angles BCD and CBD, the one to the other, and one side of the one equal to one side of the other, namely, that syde that lieth betwene the equall angles, which syde is common to them both, namely, the side BC. VVherfore (by the 26. proposition) the other sides remaining are equall to the other sides remaining, the one to the other, and the angle remaining is equal to the angle remayning. VVherfore the side AB is equall to the side CD, and the side AC

to the side BD, &amp; the angle BAC is equal to the angle BDC. And for asmuch as the angle ABC is equal to the angle BCD, and the angle CBD to the angle ACB: therfore (by the second common sentence) the whole angle ABD is equall to the whole angle ACD. And it is proued that the angle BAC is equall to the angle CDB. VVherfore in parallelogrammes, the sides and angles which are opposite are equall the one to the other. I say also that the diameter therof deuideth it into two equall partes. For forasmuch as AB is equall to CD, and BC is common to them both, therfore these two AB and BC are equall to these two BC and CD, and the angle ABC is equal to the angle BCD. VVherfore (by the 4. proposition) the base AC is equall to the base BD, and the triangle ABC is equall to the triangle BCD. VVherfore the diameter BC deuideth the parallelogramme ABCD into two equall partes: which is all that was required to be proued.
               
               In this Theoreme

                   opposite sides are equall: that their opposite angles are equall: and that the diameter deuideth the parallelogramme into two equall partes. VVhich is true in all kindes of parallelogrammes. There are fower kindes of parallelogrammes,

                     •
                  oides or diamondlike figure. And here is to be noted, that in those parallelogrammes, all whose angles ar right angles (as is a square, and a figure on the one side longer) the diameters do not only deuide the figure into two equall partes, but also they are equal the one to the other. As for example.
               Suppose that ABCD be a square,

or a figure on the one side longer, and draw in it these diametres AD and BC. And forasmuch as the line AB is equall to the line CD (by the definitiō of a square, and of a figure on the also one side lōger) &amp; the line AC is common to the both: therfore two sides of the triangle ABC are equal to two sides of the triangle ACD, the one to the other, and the angles which they contayne are equall, namely, the angles BAC &amp; ACD, for they are rightangles. Wherefore the bases namely, the diameters AD and BC, are (by the 4. proposition) equal.
               But in those parallelogrames whose angles are not right angles, as is a Rhombus, and a 
                     •
                  homboides, the diameters be euer vnequall. As for example.
               Suppose that ABCD he

a Rhombus, or a Rhombaides and drawe in it these diameters AC and BD. And forasmuch as AB is equall to CD and BC is common to them both, &amp; the angle ABC is not equall to the angle BCD (by the definition of a Rhombus and also of a Rhombaides)

therefore (by the 24. proposition) the bases also are vnequall, namely, the diameters AC and BD.
               
               Agayne. In parallelogrammes of equall sides, as are a square, and a Rhombus, the diameters do not onely deuide the figures into two equall partes, but also they deuide the angles into two equall partes.
               For suppose that there be a square or Rhombus ABCD, and draw the diameter AD. And forasmuch as the sides AB and BD are equall

to the sides AC and CD (for the figures are equilater) and the angles ABD and ACD are equall (for they are opposite angles) and the base AD is common to both triangles. Therefore (by the fourth proposition) the angles BAD &amp; CAD are equall, and so also are the angles BDA and CDA equall. Wh

               For suppose ABCD to be a figure on the one

side longer or a Romboides. And draw the diameter AD. And now if the angles BAC and CDB, be deuided into two equall partes by the diameter AD, then forasmuch as the angle. CAD is (by the 29. proposition) equall to the angle ADB, the angle also BAD shal be equal to the angle ADB (by the first common sentence). Wherfore also the side AB is equall to the side BD (by the 6. propositiō). But the sayd sides are vnequal: which is impo

               For suppose that ABCD be such a figure, namely, which hath his opposite sides and angles equall. And let the diameter thereof be AD.
                  
Now forasmuch as the sides AB and BD are equall to to the sides DC and AC, and the angles which they cō
                  tayne are equall, and the base AD is common to ech triangle, therefore (by the 4. proposition) the angles remayning are equall to the angles remayning, vnder which are subtended equal sides. Wherfore the angle BAD is equal to the angle ADC, and the angle ADB to the angle CAD. Wherefore (by the 27. proposition) the line AB is a parallel to the line CD, and the line AC to the line BD. Wherefore the figure ABCD is a parallogramme: which was required to be proued.

Wherefore (by the 26. proposition) the triangles are equall. Wherefore the whole triangle EIG is greater then the triangle DIC. And forasmuch as the trapesium GBDC is supposed to be the halfe of the parrallelograme, and the halfe of the same parallelograme is the triangle EBD (by this proposition). From the trapesium GBDC and the triangle EBD which are equall, take away the trapesium GBDI which is common to them both, and the residue namely, the triangle DIC shalbe equall to the residue, namely, to the triāgle EIG: but it is also lesse (as hath before ben proued): which is impossible. Wherefore a right line deuiding a parallelogramme into two equall partes, shall not deuide the diameter thereof vnequally. Wherefore it shall deuide it equally: which was required to be proued.

                     to place a line equall to a line geuen, in such sorte, that it shall make with one of those lines an angle equall to an other angle geuen. Now it behoueth that the two angles geuen be lesse then two right angles.
                  
                  Suppose that there be two lines AB and AC, making an angle geuen BAC: and let them be infinite on that side where they open one from the other. And let the line geuen be D, and let the other angle geuen be E.
                     
And let the two angles A and E be lesse then two right angles (otherwise there coulde not be made a triangle, as it is manifest by the 17 proposition). It is required betwene the lines AB and AC to place a line equall to the line geuen D, which with one of them as for exāple with the line AC,

And produce the line FA on the other side of the point A to the point G: and let AG be equall to the line geuen D (by the 3. proposition). And by the point G, draw (by the 31. proposition) a parallel line to the line AC, which let be GH, and produce it vntil it concurre with the line AB: which concurse let be in the point H. And agayne by the point H draw the line HK parallel vnto the line GF: which let cut the line AC in the point K. Then I say that the line HK is placed betwene the lines AB &amp; AC &amp; is equall to the line D. And that the angle at the point K is equall to the angle geuen E.

                      For forasmuch as (by construction) AGHK is a parallelogramme the line KH is equall to the line AG (by this proposition). Wherefore also it is equall to the line D. And forasmuch as the line AK fall

CF do consist vpon one and the same base, that is, vppon BC, and in the selfe same parallel lines, that is AF, and BC. Then I say, that the parallelograme ABCD is equal to the parallelograme EBCF.
                  
                     Demonstration.
                   
                  For forasmuch as ABCD is a parallelogramme, therfore (by the 34. proposition) the side AD, is equall to the side BC, and by the same reason also the side EF is equall to the side BC, wherfore AD is equall to EF: and DE is common to them both. VVherfore the whole line AE is equall to the whole line DF. And the side AB is equall to ye side DC: wherfore these two EA and AB are equall to these two FD and DC, the one to the other: and ye angle FDC is equall to the angle EAB, namely, the outward angle to ye inward angle (by ye

VVherefore the residue, namely, the trapesium ABGD is equall to the residue, that is, to the trapesium EGCF. Put the triangle GBC commō to them both. VVherefore the whole parallelogramme ABCD is equall to the whole parallelogramme EBCF. VVherefore parallelogrammes consisting vpon one and the same base, and in the selfe same parallel lines, are equal the one to the other: which was required to be demonstrated.
               
               Parallelogrammes are sayde to be in the selfe same parallel lines, when their bases, and the opposite sides vnto them, are one and the selfe same lynes wyth the parallels.

                        The first case.
                     
                  In this proposition are three cases. For the line BE may cutte the line AF, either beyond the point D, or in the point D, or on this side the point D. When

it cutteth the line AF beyond the point D the demonstration before put serueth.
               But if the line BE do cutte the line AF in

the point D,
                     The second case.
                   then forasmuch as (by the former proposition) the triangle BCD or BCE is the halfe of either of these para
                     •
                  lelogrammes ABCD and EBCF (for in the parallelogramme ABCD the diameter BD maketh the triangle BDC the halfe of the same parallelogramme, and in the parallelogramme EBCF the diameter EC or DC maketh the selfe same triangle BDC the halfe of the parallelograme EBCF) therfore (by the 7. common sentence) the parallelogrammes ABCD and EBCF are equall.
               But if the liue BE do cutte the lyne AF
                  
on this side the point D,
                     The third case.
                   then forasmuch as eyther of the lines AD and EF is equall to the line BC, therefore by the first common sentence they are equall the one to the other. Wherefore taking away ED, which is common to both, the residue AE shalbe equall to the residue DF. Agayne forasmuch as (by the 34. propositiō) the line AB is equall to the line CD, and (by the 
                     •
                  7. proposition) the angle EAB is equal to the angle FDC: therfore (by the 4. proposition) the triangles EBA and FCD are equal. Adde the trapesium CDEB common to them both: and so (by the seconde common sentence) the two parallelogrammes ABCD and EBCF shalbe equall: which was required to be proued.
            
            
               The 26. Theoreme. The 36. Proposition. Parallelogrammes consisting vpon equall bases, and in the selfe same parallel lines, are equall the one to the other.
               
                  SVppose that these parallelogrammes ABCD and EFGH do consist vpon equall bases, that is, vpon BC and FG, and in the selfe same parallel lines, that is, AH and BG. Then I say, that the parallelogramme ABCD is equall to the parallelogramme EFGH.

                     Demonstration
                   
                  And forasmuch as BC is equall to FG, but FG is equall to EH, therfore BC also is equall to EH, and they are parallel lines, and the lines BE and CH ioyne them together: but two right lynes ioynyng together two equall right

lines being parallels, are themselues

also (by the 33 proposition) equall the one to the other, and parallels. VVherfore EBCH is a parallelogramme, and is equall to the parallelograme ABCD for they haue both one and ye same base, that is, BC. And are in ye selfe same parallel lines, that is, BC &amp; EH. And by ye same reason also the parallelograme EFGH is equal to the parallelograme EBCH. VVherfore the parallelograme ABCD is equal to the parallelograme EFGH. VVherfore parallelogrames consisting vppon equall bases, and in the selfe same parrallel lines, are equall the one to the oth

                  In this proposition also are three cases. For the equall bases may either be vtterly seperated a sonder: or they may touche a

                   one of the endes: or they may haue one part common to them both.
               
                  
                     The first case.
                  Euclides demonstration serueth when the bases be vtterly seperated a sonder. VVhich yet may happen seuen diuers wayes.
                     Euery case may happen seuen diuers wayes.
                   For the bases being seperated a sō
                  der, their opposite sides also may be vtterly seperated a sonder beyond the point D, as the sides AD and EH in the first figure.
               
                   Or they may touche together in one of the endes, and the whole side may be beyond the point D, as the sides AD and EH do in the second figure.
               
                   Or one part may be beyond the point D, and an other part common to them

                  
both, as in the third figure, the sides AD and EH haue the part ED common to them both.
               Or they may iustly agree the one with the other, that is, the pointes A and D  may fall vpon the pointes E and H: as in the fourth figure.
               Or the side AD being produced on this side the point A, part of the opposite  side vnto the base FG may be on this side the point A, and an other part may be common with the line AD, as in the fifth figure.

                  VVherefore EBCA.

and DBCF are parallelogrammes. And the parallelogramme EBCA, is (by the 35. proposition) equall to the parallelogramme DBCF. For they consist vppon one and the selfe same base, namely, BC, and are in the selfe same parallel lines, that is, BC and EF. But the triangle ABC is (by the 34. propositiō) the halfe of the parallelogramme EBCA, for the diameter AB deuideth it into two equall parts: &amp; (by the same) the triangle DBC is the halfe of the parallelogramme DBCF, for the diameter DC deuideth it into two equall parts: but the halues of thinges equall are also equall the one to the other (by the 7. common sentence), wherefore ehe triangle ABC is equall to the triangle DBC VVherefore triangles consisting vpon one and the selfe same base, and in the selfe same parallels: are equall the one to the other: which was required to be demonstrated.
               
               
                  Those triangles are saide to be contayned within the selfe same parallel lines,
                     How triangles are sayde to be in the selfe same parallel lines.
                   which hauing their bases in one of the parallel lines, haue their 
                     •
                  oppes in the other.
               Here as I promised will I shew out of Proclus the comparison of two triangles, which hauing their sides equall, haue the bases and angles at the toppe v
                     •
                  equall.
                     Comparison of two triangles whose sides being equal, their bases and angles at the toppe are vnequall.
                   And first I say that the vnequall angles at the toppe being equall to two right angles, the triangles shalbe equall. As for example.
               Suppose that these two triangles ABC and DEF haue two sides of the one, namely, AB and AC, equall to two sides of the other, namely, to DE and DF, eche to his correspondent side,
                     When the two angles at the toppes are equall to two right angles.
                   that is, AB to DE, and AC to DF, and let the base BC be greater then the base EF: and let the angle at the point A be greater then the angle at the point D. But let the sayde angles at the pointes A and D,

be equall to two right angles. Then I say that the triangles ABC and DEF are equall. For forasmuch as the angle BAC is greater then the angle EDF, vpon the line ED, and to the point D describe (by the 23. proposition) an angle equall to the angle BAC, which let be EDG: and put the line DG equall to the line AC: and draw a line from E to G, and an other from F to G: and produce the lines ED &amp; FD beyond the poynt D to the pointes H and K. Now forasmuch as the angle BAC is equall to the angle EDG, and the angles BAC and EDF are equall to two right angles, therefore the angles EDG and EDF are equall to two right angles. But the angles EDG and KDG, are also equal to two right angles: take away the angle FDG common to them both: wherefore the angle remayning EDF is equall to the angle remayning GDK. But the angle EDF is equall to the angle HDK (by the 15. proposition) for they are hed angles. Wherefore the angle GDK is equall to the angle HDK. And forasmuch as in the triangle GDF the outward angle GDH is (by the 32. proposition) equal to the two inward and opposite angles at the points G and F: which two angles also are (by the 5. proposition) equall the one to the other: for the line DG is by construction equall to the line AC, namely, to the line DF. Wherefore the angle GDH is double both to the angle at the point G, and to the angle at the point F. But the angle GDH is also double to the angle GDK (for the angle GDK is proued to be equall to the angle KDH) wherefore the angle at DGF is equall to the angle GDK: and they are alternate angles. Wherefore (by the 27. proposition) the line D
                     •
                   is a parallel to the line FG. Wherefore the triangles GDE and FDE are vppon one and the selfe same base, namely, DE, and in the selfe same parallel lines: DE and GF. Wherefore by this proposition they are equall. But the triangle GDE is by construction equall to the triangle ABC. Wherefore also the triangle DEF is equall to the triangle ABC: which was required to be proued.
               But now let the angles BAC and EDF be greater then two right angles:
                     When they are greater thē two right angles.
                   &amp; let the angle at the point A be greater then the angle at the point D, as it was before. Thē I say that the triangle ABC is le
                     •
                  se then the triangle DEF. Let the same construction be here that was in the former. And forasmuch as the angles BAC and EDF, that is, the angles EDG and EDF are greater then two right angles, but the angles EDG and GDK are equall to two right angles: take away the angle FDG which is common to them both. Wherefore the angle remayning, namely, EDF is greater thē the angle remayning, namely, then GDK: that is, the angle KDH (which by the 15. proposition is equall to the angle EDF) is greater then the angle GDK, wherefore the angle GDH is more then double to the angle GDK: but the angle GDH is double to the angle

                  DGF, as was before proued. Wherefore the

angle GDK is lesse then the angle DGF. Vnto the angle GDK put (by the 23. proposition) the angle DGL equall: and produce the line GL till it concurre with the line EF in the pointe L. And draw a line from D to L. Wherefore (by the 27. proposition) GL is a parallel line to DE, for that the alternate angles DGL and GDK are equal. Wherfore the triangles GDE and LDE are (by this proposition) equal (for they consist vpon one and the self same base, namely, DE, and are in the selfe same parallel lines, namely, ED and GL) But the triangle LDE is lesse then the triangle FDE, Wherfore also the triangle GDE is lesse the
                     •
                   the triangle FDE. But the triangle GDE is equal to the triangle ABC. Wherfore the triangle ABC is lesse then the triangle DEF: which was required to be proued.
               
                  
                     When they are lesse then two right angles.
                  But now let the angles BAC and EDF be lesse then two right angles: and agayne let the angle at the pointe A be greater then the angle at the point D. Then I say that the triāgle ABC is greater then the triangle DEF. Let the same constructiō be also here that was in the two former. And forasmuch as the angles BAC and EDF, that is, the angles EDG &amp; EDF, are lesse then two right angles, but the angles EDG and GDK are equal to two right angles, take away the angle FDG which is common to them both, wherefore the angle remayning, namely, EDF is lesse then the angle remayning, namely, then GDK: that is, the angle HDK (which by the 1
                     •
                  . proposition is equall to the angle EDF) is lesse then the angle GDK. Wherfore the whole angle GDH is lesse then double to the angle GDK. But it is double to the angle DGF (as before it was proued): wherfore the angle GDK is greater then the angle DGF. Put the angle DGL equall to the angle GDK (by the 23. proposition) and produce the line GL till it concurre with the line EF also produced
                     •
                   &amp; let the concurse be in the point L. And draw a line from D to L. And for as much as the angle DGL is equall to the angle GDK, and they are alternate angles, therefore the line GL is a parallel to DE (by the 27. proposition). Wherefore (by this proposition) the triangles GDE and LDE are equal: but the triangle LDE is greater then the triangle FDE, and the triangle GDE is equall to the triangle ABC. Wherefore the triangle ABC is greater then the triangle DEF: which was required to be proued.
            
            
               The 28. Theoreme. The 38. Proposition. Triangles which consist vppon equall bases, and in the selfe same parallel lines, are equall the one to the other.
               
                  SVppose that these triangles ABC and DEF do consist vpon equal bases, that is, vpon BC and EF, and in the selfe same parallel lines, that is BF and AD. Then I say that the triangle ABC is equall to the triangle

ABC is equall to the triangle DEF.
                  
                     Construction.
                   
                  Produce (by the second peticion) the line AD on eche side to the pointes G and H. And (by the 31. proposition) by the point B drawe vnto CA a parallel

line BG, and (by the same) by the pointe F drawe vnto DE a parallel line FH.
                  
                     Demonstration.
                   
                  VVherfore GBCA and DEFH are parallelogrammes. But the parallelograme GBCA is (by the 36 proposition) equal to the parallelogramme DEFH, for they consist vpon equall bases, that is, BC and EF, and are in the selfe same parallel lines, that is, BF and GH. But (by the 34. proposition) the triangle ABC is the halfe of the parallelogramme GBCA, for the diameter AB deuideth it into two equall partes: and the triangle DEF is (by the same) the halfe of the parallelogramme DEFH, for the diameter FD deuideth it into two equall partes. But the halues of thinges equall are (by the 7. common sentence) equall

                     he one to the other. VVherfore the triangle ABC is equall to the triangle DEF. VVherefore triangles which consist vppon equall bases, and in the selfe same parallel lines, are equall the one to the other: which was required to be proued.
               
               In this proposition are three cases.
                     Thre cases in this proposition.
                   For the bases of the triangles either haue one part common to them both or the base of the one toucheth the base of the other onely in a point: or their bases are vtterly seuered a sunder. And ech of these cases may also be diuersly,
                     Ech of these cases also may be diuersly.
                   as we before haue sene in parallelogrammes consisting on equall bases, and being in the selfe same parallel lines. So that he which diligently noteth the variety that was there put touching them, may also easely frame the same varietie to ech case in this proposition. VVherefore I thinke it nedeles here to repeate the same agayne: for how soeuer the bases be put, or the toppes, the manner of construction and demonstration here put by Euclide will serue: namely, to draw parallel lines to the sides.

equall partes be ABC.

                      Deuide one of the sides therof, namely, BC into two equall partes (by the 10. proposition) in the point D. And draw a line from the point D to the point A. Thē I say that the two triangles ABD &amp; ACD, are equal, which is easy to proue (by the 38. proposition) if by the point A we drawe vnto the line BC a paral
                        •
                     el line (by the 31. proposition), which let by HK: for so the triangles AB D and ADC, consisting vppon equal bases BD &amp; DC, and being in the selfe same parallel lines HK and BC are of necessitie equall. The selfe

same thing also wil happen if the side BA be deuided into two equall parts in the point E, and so be drawen a right line from the point E, to the point C. Or if the side AC be deuided into two equall partes in the point F, and so be drawen a right line from the point F to the point B: which is in like manner proued by drawing parallel lines by the pointes B, and C, to the lines BA and AC,

                     From any point geuen in one of the sides of a triangle, to draw a line which shal deuide the triangle into two equall partes.
                  
                  Let the triangle geuen be BCD: and let the point geuen in the side BC be A. It is required from the point A to draw a line which shal deuide the triangle BCD into two equall partes.
                        Construction.
                      Deuide the side BC into two equall partes in the point E. And drawe a right line from the point A to the point D. And (by the

31. proposition) by the point E draw vnto the line AD a parallel line EF: which let cutte the side DC in the point F. And draw a line from the point A to the point F. Then I say that the line AF deuideth the triangle BCD into two equall partes: namely, the trapesium ABDF is equall to the triangle ACF. For draw a line from E to D,
                     
                        Demonstration
                      cutting the line AF in the point G. Now then it is manifest (by the 38. proposition) that the two triangles BED and CED are equall (if we vnderstand a line to be drawen by the point D parallel to the line BC, for the bases BE and EC are equal). The two triangles also DEF and AEF are (by the 37. proposition) equall: for they consist vpon one and the selfe same base EF, and are in the selfe same parallel lines AD and EF. Wherefore taking away the triangle EFG which is cōmō to thē both, the triangle AEG shalbe equall to the triangle DFG: wherfore vnto either of thē adde the trapesiū 
                     CFGE, and the triangle ACF shalbe equal to the triangle DEC. But the triangle DEC is the halfe part of the whole triangle BCD wherefore the triangle ACF is the halfe part of the same triangle BCD. Wherfore the residue, namely, the trapesium ABFD is the other halfe of the same triangle. Wherefore the line AF deuideth the whole triangle BCD into two equall partes: which was required to be done.
               
            
            
               The 29. Theoreme. The 39. Proposition. Equall triangles consisting vpon one and the same base, and on one and the same side: are also in the selfe same parallel lines.
               
                  SVppose that these two equall triangles ABC and DBC do consist vppon one and the same base, namely, BC and on one and the same side. Thē I say that they are in the selfe same parallel lines. Drawe a right line from the point A to the point D. Now I say that AD is a parallel line to BC. For if not, then (by the 31. proposition) by the point A drawe vnto the right line BC a parallel line AE, and draw a right line from the point E to the

point C. VVherfore ye triangle EBC is

(by ye
                   37. propositiō) equal to the triangle ABC, for they consist vpon one and the selfe same base, namely, BC, and are in ye selfe same parallels, that is, AE and BC. But the triangle DBC is (by supposition) equall to the triangle ABC
                        •
                      VVherfore the triangle DBC is equal to the triangle EBC, the greater vnto the lesse: which is impossible. VVherefore the line AE, is not a parallel to the line BC. And in like sorte may it be proued that no other line besides AD is a parallel line to BC, wherefore AD is a parallel line to BC. VVherfore equall triangles consisting vpon one and the same base, and on one and the same side, are also in the selfe same parallel lines: which was required to be proued.
               
               This proposition is the conuerse of the 37. proposition.
                     This Theoreme the conuerse of the 37. proposition.
                   And here is to be noted that if by the point A, you draw vnto the line BC a parallel line, the same shal of necessitie either light vpō the point D, or vnder it, or aboue it. If it light vpō it, then is that manifest which is required: but if it light vnder it, then foloweth that absurditie which Euclide putteth, namely, that the greater triangle is equall to the lesse: which selfe same absurditie also will follow, if it fall aboue the point D. As for example.
               Suppose that these equall triangles ABC and DBC do consist vppon one and the selfe same base BC, and on one and the same side. Then I
                  
say, that they are in the selfe same parallel lines, and that a right line ioyning together their toppes is a parallel to the base BC. Draw a right line frō 
                  A to D. Now if this be not a parallel to the base BC, let AE be a parallel vnto it, and let AE fall without the line AD. And produce the line BD till it concurre with the line AE in the pointe E and draw a line from E to C. Wherfore the triangle ABC is equal to the triangle EBC: but the triangle ABC is equall to the triangle DBC: Wherfore the triangle EBC is equall to the triangle DBC. Namely, the whole to the part: which is impossible. Wherfore the parallel line falleth not without the line AD. And Euclide hath proued that it falleth not within. Wherfore the line AD is a parallel vnto the line BC. Wherfore equall triangles which are on the selfe same side, and on one and the selfe same base, are also in the selfe same parallel lines: which was required to be proued.

set eyther within or without, let the parallelograme

                     fore the parallelograme BF being equall to the parallelograme ABGE, the parte shall bee equal to the whole, which is absurde. The same inconuenience also will followe, if it fall without. VVherefore it can neither fall within nor without. VVherfore equall parallelogrames beyng vpon one and the selfe same base and on one and the same side, are also in the selfe same parallel lines.

                  Suppose that there be a triangle ABC: and let there bee a right lyne DE, which let deuide the two sides AB and BC into two equall partes in the pointes D and E Then I say, that the line DE is a parallel to the line A

C. Drawe these two lines AE and DC. Now then imagining a line to be drawne by the point E parallel to the line AB, the triangle BDE shall (by the 38. proposition) bee equall to the triangle DAE (for their two bases AD and DB are put to be equall) And by the same reason the triangle BDE is equall to the triangle CED. VVherfore (by the first common sentēce) the triangles EAD and ECD are equall, and they are erected on one and the sel

VVherefore (by the 39. proposition) they are in the selfe same parallel lines, and the line which ioyneth together their toppes is a parallel to their base. VVherfore the lynes DE and AC are paralles: which was required to be proued.

VVherfore the triangle DCE is equall to the triangle FCE, namely, the greater vnto the lesse, which is impossible. VVherfore AF is not a parallel line to BE. And in like sorte may we proue that no other line besides AD is a parallell line to BE. VVherfore AD is a parallel lyne to BE Equall triangles therfore consisting vppon equall bases, and in one and the same side: are also in the selfe same parallel lines: which was required to be proued.
               
                  This proposition is the conuerse of the 38. proposition.
                  This proposition is the conuerse of the 38. propositiōs. 
                  And in this as in the former proposition, if the parallel line drawen by the point A, should not passe by the point D, it must passe eyther beneath it, or aboue it. Euclide setteth forth onely the absurdity which should follow if it passe beneath it: but the selfe same absurditie also wil follow if it should passe aboue it: as it is not hard to see by the gathering thereof in the former proposition. And therefore here I omitte it.

ABCD and the triangle EBC haue one &amp; the same base, namely, BC, and let thē be in the selfe same parallel lines, namely, BC &amp; AE.

                  VVherfore (by the 37. proposition)

the triangle ABC is equall to

the triangle EBC
                        •
                      for they are vppon one and the selfe same base BC, and in the selfe same parallell lines BC and EA: but the parallelograme ABCD is double to the triangle ABC (by the 34. proposition) for the diameter thereof AC deuideth it into two equal parts: wherfore the parallelogramme ABCD is double to the triangle EBC. If therfore a parallelogramme and a triangle haue one and the selfe same base, and be in the selfe same parallels, the parallelograme shall be double to the triangle: which was required to be proued.
               
               
                  
                     Two cases in this proposition.
                  This proposition hath two cases. For the base beyng one, the triangle may haue his toppe without the parallelograme, or within. The first case is demonstrated of the author. The second case is thus.
               Suppose that there be a parallelograme ABCD, and let

the triangle be ECD, either of which let haue one and the selfe same base, namely, CD, and let them be in the selfe same parallel lines CD and AB, and let the toppe of the triangle ECD, namely, the point E, be within the parallelograme ABCD. Then I say that the parallelograme ABCD is double to the triangle ECD. Draw a right line frō the point A to the point D. Now forasmuch as the parallelograme ABCD is double to the triangle AD (by the 34. proposition): and the triangle ADC is equall to the triangle EDC (by the 37. proposition). Therfore the parallelogramme ABCD is double to the triangle ECD: which was required to be proued.
               
                  
                     A corollary.
                  By this proposition it is manifest that if the base be doubled, the triangle erected vppon it shalbe equall to the parallelogramme.
               
                  
                     The selfe same demonstration will serue if the triangle &amp; the parallelogramme be vpon equall bases.
                  And if the bases of the triangle and of the parallelogramme be equall, the sel
                     •
                  e same demonstration will serue if you drawe the diameter of the parallelograme. For the triangles being equal, the parallelogramme which is double to the one, shal also be double to the other. And the triangles must nedes be equall (by the 38. proposition) for that their bases are equal, and for that they are in the selfe same parallel lines.
               
                  The conuerse of this proposition is thus.
                  
                     If a parallelogramme and a triangle haue one and the selfe same base, or equall bases the one to the other, and be described on one and the same side of the base: 
                           •
                        f the parallelogramme be double to the triangle, they shalbe in the selfe same parallel lines.
                  
                  
                     
                        The conuerse of this proposition.
                     For if they be not, the whole shalbe equall to his parte. For then the toppe of the triangle must nedes fall either within the parallel lines or without. And

whether of both soeuer it do, one and the selfe same impossibilitie will follow, if by the toppe of the triangle be drawen vnto the base a parallel line.
               
               
                  An other conuerse of the same proposition.
                  
                     If a parallelogramme be the double of a triangle, being both within the selfe same parallel lines:
                     
                        An other conuerse of the same propositiō.
                      
                     then are they vpon one and the selfe same base, or vpon equall bases. For if in that case their bases should be vnequal, then might straight way be proued, that the whole is equall to his part: which is impossible.
                  A trapesium hauing two sides onely parallel lines,
                        Comparison of a triangle and a trapesium being vpon one &amp; the selfe same base, and in the selfe same parallel lines.
                      is eyther more then double, or lesse then double to a triangle contayned within the selfe same parallel lines, and hauing one and the selfe same base with the trapesium, or table. 
                        •
                     ust the double it cannot be, for then it should be a parallelogramme. A trapesium hauing two sides parallels hath of necessitie the one of them longer then the other: for if they were equall then should the other two sides enclosing them be also equall (by the 33. proposition.) If the greater side of the trapesium be the base of the triangle, then shal the trapesium be lesse then the double of the triangle And if the lesse side of the trapesium be the base of the triangle then shall the trapesium be greater then the triangle.
                  For suppose that ABCD be a trapesium,
                        When the greater side of the trapesium is the base of the triangle.
                      and let

two sides thereof, namely, AB and CD be parallel lines, and let the side AB be lesse then the side CD, &amp; produce the side AB infinitlye on the side B to the point F. And let the triangle ECD haue one and the selfe same base with the trapesium, namely, the line CD. Then I say that the trapesium ABCD is lesse thē the double of the triangle ECD. For put the line AF equall to the line CD (by the 3. propositiō) and draw a line from D to F. Wherefore ACDF is a parallelogramme (by the 33. proposition). Wherefore (by the 34 proposition) it is double to the triangle ECD. But the trapesium ABCD is a part of the parallelogramme ACDF. Wherefore the trapesium ABCD is lesse then the double of the triangle ECD: which was requi
                        •
                     ed to be proued.
                  Agayne let the triangle haue to his base the side

                     AB.
                     
                        When the lesse side is the base.
                      Then I say that the trapesium ABCD is greater then the double of the triangle AEB. For from the side CD cut of the line CF equall to the line AB (by the

                     . proposition). And draw a line from B to F. Wherfore (by the 33. proposition) ABCF is a parallelogramme: and therefore is (by the 34. proposition) double to the triangle AEB. Wherefore the trapesium ABCD is more then the double of the triangle AEB
                     
                        •

It is required that vnto the triangle ABC there be made a parallelograme equall, whose angle shal be equall to the rectiline angle geuen, namely,Construction. to the angle D. Deuide (by the 10. propositiō) the line BC into two equall partes in the pointe E. And (by the first peticion) draw a right line from the point A to the point E. And (by the 23. proposition) vpon the right line geuen EC, and to the point in it

geuen E, make the angle CEF equal to the angle D. And (by the 31. proposition) by the point A draw vnto the line EC a parallel line AH: and let the line EF cut the line AH in the point F. and (by the same) by the point C, drawe vnto the line EF a parallel line CG. VVherfore FECG is a parallelograme.Demonstration And forasmuche as BE is equall to EC, therfore (by the 38. proposition) the triangle ABE is equall to the triangle AEC, for they consist vpō equall bases that is BE and EC, and are in the selfe same parallel lines, namely, BC and AH. VVherfore the triangle ABC is double to the triangle AEC. And the parallelograme CEFG is also double to the triangle AEC: for they haue one &amp; the selfe same base, namely, EC: and are in the selfe same parallel lines, that is, EC and AH. VVherfore the parallelograme FECG is equall to the triangle ABC, and hath the angle CEF equall to the angle geuen D. VVherefore vnto the triangle geuen ABC is made an equall parallelograme, namely, FECG, whose angle CEF is equall to the angle geuen D: which was required to be done.

angle equal to the angle E. Vpon

               The 32. Theoreme. The 43. Proposition. In euery parallelograme, the supplementes of those parallelogrammes which are about the diameter, are equall the one to the other.
               
                  SVppose that ABCD be a parallelograme, and let the diameter therof be AC: and about the diameter AC let these parallelogrames EH and GF consist: and let the supplementes be BK and KD. Then I say that the supplement BK is equall to the supplement KD. For forasmuch as ABCD is a parallelograme

and the diameter therof is AC, therfore (by the 34. proposition) the triangle ABC is equall to the triangle ADC. Agayne forasmuch as AEKH is a parallelograme, and the diameter therof is AK, therfore (by the same) the triangle AEK is equall to the triangle AHK. And by the same reason also the triangle KFC is equall to the triangle KGC. And forasmuch as the triangle AEK is equall to the triangle AHK, and the triangle KFC to the triangle NGC, therfore the triangles AEK and KGC are equall to the triangles AHK and KFC: and the whole triangle ABC is equall to the whole triangle AD

C: wherfore the residue, namely, the supplement BK is (by the 3. common sentence) equall to the residue, namely, to the supplement KD. VVherefore in euery parallelogramme, the supplementes of those parallelogrammes whiche are about the diameter, are equall the one to the other: whiche was required to be proued.
               
               
                  
                     How parallelogrammes are sayde to consiste about a diameter.
                  Those parallelogrames are sayde to consist about a diameter which haue to their diameters part of the diameter of the whole and great parallelograme, as in the example of Euclide. And such parallelogrames

which haue not to their diameters part of the diameter of the greater parallelograme, are sayde not to consist about the diameter. For thē the diameter of the greater parallelograme cutteth the side of the lesse cōtayned wythin it. As in the parallelogramme AB, the diameter CD, cutteth the side EH of the parallelogramme CE. Wherefore the parallelogramme CE is not about one and the selfe same diameter with the parallelogramme CD.
               
               
                  
                     Supplements &amp; Complementes.
                  Supplementes or Complementes are those figures which with the two parallelogrammes accomplish the whole parallelogramme. Although Pel

                     Three cases in this Theoreme.
                  This theoreme hath three cases onely. For the parallelogrammes which consist about the diameter, eyther touch the one the other in a point: or by a certayne parte of the diameter are seuered the one from the other: or els they cutte the one the other.
                     The first case.
                   For the first case is the example of Euclide before set. The second case is thus.
               
                  
                     The second case.
                  Suppose that AB be a parallelograme
                     •
                  
                  
whose diameter let be CD: and aboute the same diameter let these parallelogrammes CK and DL consist: and betwene thē let there be a certayne part of the diameter, namely, LK. Then I say that the two supplementes AGLKE &amp; BFKLH are equall. For we may as before (by the 34. proposition) proue that the triangle ACD, is equall to the triangle BCD, and the triangle ECK to the triangle KCF, and also the triangle DGL to the triangle DHL. Wherfore the residue, namely, the fiue sided figure AGLKE is equall to the residue, namely, to the fiue sided figure, BFKLH: that is, the one supplement to the other
                     •
                   which was required to be proued.
               
                  
                     The third case.
                  But now suppose AB to be a parallelogramme, and let the diameter thereof be CD: and let the one of the parallelogrammes about it be ECFL, and let the other be

                  DGKH, of which let the one cut the other.

Then I say that the supplementes EG and EH are equall. For forasmuch as the whole triangle DGK is equal to the whole triangle DHK (by the 34. proposition), and part also of the one, namely, the triangle KLM is equall to part of the other, namely, to the triangle KLN (by the same), for LK is a parallelograme: therefore the residue, namely, the Trapesium DLNH is equall to the residue, namely, to the trapesiū 
                  DLMG: but the triangle ADC is equal to the triangle BCD, and in the parallelograme EF, the triangle FCL, is equall to the triangle ECL, and the trapesium DGML is (as it hath bene proued) equall to the trapesium DHNL. Wherefore the residue, namely, the quadrilater figure GF is equall to the residue, namely, to the quadrilater figure EH, that is, the one supplement to the other: which was required to be proued.
               This is to be noted that in 
                     ••
                  h of those three cases it may so happen, that the parallelogrammes aboute the diameter shall not haue one angle common wyth the whole parallelogramme, as they haue in the former figures. But yet though they haue not, the selfe same demonstration wil serue, as it is playne to see in the figures here vnderneath put. For alwayes, if from thinges equall be taken away thinges equall, the residue shalbe equall.
               
               This proposition P

                     This proposition called Gnomical and mistical.
                   for that of it (sayth he) spring infinite demonstrations, and vses in geometry. And he putteth the conuerse thereof after this manner.
               
                  If a parallelogramme be deuided into two equall supplementes,

                  and into two complements whatsoeuer: the diameter of the two complementes shall be set directly, and make one diameter of the whole parallelogramme.
               
               Here is to be noted as I before admonished that Pelitarius for distinction sake putteth a difference betwene supplementes and complementes, which difference, for that I haue before declared, I shall not neede here to repete agayne.
               Suppose that there be a parallelogramme ABCD, whose two equall supplements let be AEFG and FHDK, and let the two complementes thereof be GFCK and EBFH: whose diameters let be CF and FB. Then I say that CFB is one right line, and is the diameter of the whole parallelogramme ABCD: for if it be not, then is there an

other diameter of the whole parrallelogramme, which let

be CLB being drawen vnder the diameters CF and FB, and cutting the line GH in the in the point L. And (by the 31. proposition) by the point L, draw vnto the line AC a parallel line MLN. And so are there in the whole parallelogramme ABCD two supplements AMGL and LHND, which by this proposition shalbe equall the one to the other. For that they are about the diameter CLB. But the supplement AEFG is (by supposition) equall to the supplement FHDK: and forasmuch as FHDK is greater then LHDN, AEFG also shalbe greater then AMGL, namely, the part greater then the whole: which is impossible. And by the same reasō may it be proued, that the diameter cannot be drawen aboue the diameters CF and FB. Wherefore CFB is one diameter of the whole parallelogramme ABCD: which was required to be proued.

And extend the line FG beyond the point G to the poynte H. And (by the 31. proposition) by the point A drawe to either of these lines BG and EF a parallel line AH. And (by the first peticion) draw a right line from the point H to the point B. And forasmuch as vpon the parallel lines AH and EF falleth a certayne right line HF, therefore (by the

same side lesse then two right angles, those right lines being infinitly produced shall at the length mete on that side in which are the angles lesse then two right angles (by the 5. peticion). VVherfore the lines HB and FE being infinitly produced will at the length mete. Let them be produced, &amp; let them mete in the point K. And (by the 31 proposition) by the point K draw to either of these lines EA and FH a parallel line KL. And (by the 2. peticion) extend the lines HA and GB till they cōcurre with the line KL in the pointes L and M.
                  
                     Demonstration
                   
                  VVherefore HLKF is a parallelogramme, and the diameter thereof is HK: and about the diameter HK are the parallelogrammes AG and ME, and the supplementes are LB and BF: wherefore (by the 43. prop

                     sition) the supplement LB is equall to the supplement BF: but by construction the parallelograme BF is equall to the triangle C: wherefore also the parallelogramme LB is equall to the triangle C. And forasmuch as the line FH is a parallel to the line KL, and vpon them lighteth the line GM, therefore (by the 27. proposition) the angle FGB is equall to the angle BML. But the angle FGB is equall to the angle D, therfore the angle BML is equal to the angle D. VVherfore vpō the right line geuen AB is applied the parallelograme LB, equal to the triangle geuen C, and contayning the angle BML equal to the rectiline angle geuen D: which was required to be done.

                   A right line to which the application is made, which here must be the one side of the parallelogramme applied. A triangle whereunto the parallelogramme applied must bee equall: and an angle wherunto the angle of the parallelograme applied must be equall. And if the angle geuen be a right angle, thē shal the parallelograme applied be either a square, or a figure on the one side longer. But if the angle geuen be an obtuse or an acute angle, then shall the parallelograme applied be a Rhombus or diamond figure, or els a Rhomboides or diamondlike figure.

                  Suppose that the right line geuen be AB, and let the parallelograme geuen be CDEF, and let the angle geuen be G. It is required vpon the line AB to describe a triā
                     gle equall to the parallelograme CDEF, hauing an angle equall to the angle G. Drawe the diameter CF &amp; produce CD beyond the point D to the point H. And put the line

                     DH equall to the line CD. And

draw a line from F to H. Now thē (by the 41. proposition) the triā
                     gle CHF is equall to the parallelograme CDEF. And (by this proposition) vppon the line AB describe a parallelograme ABKL equall to the triangle CHF, hauing the angle ABL equal to the angle geuen G: and produce the line BL beyonde the pointe L to the point M. And put the line LM equall to the line BL, and draw a line from A to M. Then I say that vpon the line AB is described the triangle ABM, which is such a triangle as is required. For (by the 41. proposition) the triangle ABM is equal to the parallelogramme ABKL (for that they are betwene two parallel lines BM and AK, &amp; the base of the triangle is double to the base of the parallelogramme): but ABKL is by construction equall to the triangle CHF: and the triangle CHF is equall to the parallelograme CDEF. Wherfore (by the first common sentence) the triangle ABM is equall to the parallelograme geuen CDEF, and hath his angle ABM equal to the angle geuen G: which was required to be done.

                  SVppose that the rectiline figure geuen be ABCD, and let the rectiline angle geuē be E. It is required to describe a parallelograme equall to the rectiline figure geuen ABCD, and contayning an angle equal to the rectiline angle geuen E.
                  
                     Construction.
                   
                  Draw (by the first peticion) a right line frō the point D to the point B. And (by the 42. proposition) vnto the triangle ABD describe an equall parallelograme FH, hauing his angle FKH equall to the angle E. And (by the 4
                     •
                  . of the first) vpō the right

line GH apply the parallelogramme GM equal to the triangle DBC, hauing his angle GHM equall to the angle E.
                  
                     Demonstration.
                   
                  And forasmuch as eyther of those angles HKF and GHM is equall to the angle E: therefore the angle HKF is equall to the angle GHM: put the angle KHG common to them both, wherfore the angles FKH and KHG are equall to the angles KHG and GHM. but the angles FKH and KHG are (by the 29. proposition) equall to two right angles. VVherfore the angles KHG and GHM are equall to two

right angles. Now then vnto a right line GH, and to a point in the same H, are drawen two right lines KH and HM not both on one and the same side, making the side angles equall to two right angles. VVherfore (by the 14. proposition) the lines KH and HM make directly one right line. And forasmuch as vpon the parallel lines. KM and FG falleth the right line HG, therefore the alternate aagles MHG and HGF are (by the 29 proposition) equall the one to the other: put the angle HGL common to them both. VVherfore the angles MHG and HGL are equall to the angles HGF and HGL. But the angles MHG &amp; HGL are equall to two right angles (by ye
                   29. proposition). VVherfore also the angles HGF and HGL are equall to two right angles. VVherfore (by the 14. proposition) the lines FG and GL make directly one right line. And forasmuch as the line KF is (by the 34. proposition) equal to the lyne HG, and it is also parallel vnto it: and the line HG is (by the same) equall to the line ML, therfore (by the first common sentence) the line FK is equall to the lyne ML, and also a parallel vnto it (by the 30. proposition). But the right lynes KM and FL ioyne them together. VVherfore (by the 33. proposition) the lines KM and FL are equall the on to the other and parallel lines. VVherfore KFLM is a parallelograme. And forasmuch as the triangle ABD is eqnal to the parallelograme FH, and the triangle DBC to the parallelogramme GM
                        •
                      therfore the whole rectiline figure ABCD is equall to the whole parallelograme KFLM. VVherfore to the rectiline figure geuen ABCD is made an equall parallegrame KFLM, whose angle FKM is equal to the angle geuen, namely, to E: which was required to be done.

                   in the example of Euclide is a parallelograme. But if the rectiline figure be of many sides, as of 5.6. or mo, thē must you resolue the figure into his triangles, as hath bene before taught in the 32. proposition. And thē apply a parallelograme equal to euery triangle vpon a line geuē, as before in the example of the author. And the same kind of reasoning wil serue that was before, only by reasō of the multitude of triangles, you shall haue neede of oftener repeticiō of the 29. and 14. propositiōs to proue that the bases of al the parallelogrames made equall to all the triangles make one right line, and so also of the toppes of the said parallelogrames. Pelitarius addeth vnto this proposition this Probleme following.

               Suppose that

there be two vnequall rectiline superficieces A &amp; B of which let A be the greater. It is required to finde out the excesse of the superficies A aboue the superficieces B. Describe (by the 44.

proposition) the parallelograme CDEF equall to the rectiline figure A, contayning a right angle. And produce the line CD beyond the point D to the point G: &amp; put the line DG equall to the line CD. And againe (by the 44. proposition) vpon the line DG describe the parallelograme DGHK equall to the rectiline figure B, and hauyng the angle DGK a right angle. And produce the line KH beyond the point H, vntill it cutte the line CE in the point L. Then I say that HLEF, is the excesse of the rectiline figure A aboue the rectiline figure B. For first that CGKL is a parallelogramme it is manifest, neither nedeth it to be demonstrated. And forasmuch as the lines CD and DG are by supposition equal and either of them is a parallel to KL, therfore (by the 36, proposition) the two parallelogrames CH and DK are equall. And forasmuch as DK is supposed to be equall to the rectiline figure B, CH also shall be equall to the same rectiline figure B. Wherfore forasmuch as the whole parallelograme CF is equall to the rectiline figure A, and LF is the excesse of CF aboue DL or DK, it followeth that LF is the excesse of the rectiline figure A aboue the rectiline figure B: whiche was required to be done.
               
                  An other more redy way.
                  Let the parallelograme CDEF remayne equall to the rectiline figure A, &amp; produce the line CD beyond the point D to the pointe G. And vpon the line DG describe the parallelograme DGHK equall to the rectiline figure B. And produce the lines EC &amp; HK beyond the points C and K till they concurre in the point L. And by the pointe D draw the diameter

LDM, which let cutte the line HG beyng produced beyonde the pointe G in the point M, &amp; by the pointe M drawe vnto the line HL a parallel MN cuttyng the line EL in the pointe N: and by that meanes is HLMN a parallelograme. Then I say that NF is the evcesse of the rectiline figure A aboue the rectiline figure B. For forasmuch as the parallelograme HD is equall to the rectiline figure B, &amp; the supplementes HD and DN ar (by the 43. proposition) equall: therfore DN also is equall to the rectiline figure B, which rectiline figure DN being taken away frō the parallelograme CF (which is supposed to be equall to the rectiline figure A) the residue NF shall be the ezcesse of the rectiline figure A aboue the rectiline figure B: which was required to be done.
               
            
            
               The 14. Probleme. The 46. Proposition. Vppon a right line geuen, to describe a square.
               
                  SVppose that the right line geuen be AB. It is required vpō the right line AB, to describe a square. Vpon the right line AB, and from a point in it geuen, namely, A, rayse vp (by the 11 proposition) a perpendiculer line AC. And (by the 3. proposition) vnto AB put an equall line AD. And (by the 31. proposition) by the point D drawe vnto AB a parallel line DE. And (by the same) by the point B drawe vnto AD a parallel

line BE. VVherefore ADEB is a parallelogramme.

VVherefore the line AB is equall to the line DE, and the line AD to the line BE: but the line AB is equall to the line AD wherefore these fower lines BA, AD, DE, EB, are equall the one to the other. VVherefore the parallelogramme ADEB consisteth of equall sides. I say also that it is rectangle. For forasmuch as vpon the parallel lines AB and DE falleth a right line AD: therefore (by the 29. proposition) the angle: BAD and ADE are equal to two right angles: but the angle BAD is a right angle. VVherfore the angle ADE also is a right angle. But in parallelogrames the sides and angles which are opposite are equall the one to the other (by the 34 proposition). VVherefore the two opposite angles ABE and BED are ech of them a right angle. VVherefore the parallelograme ABED is rectangle: &amp; it is also proued that it is equilater. VVherfore it is a square, &amp; it is described vpon the right line geuen AB: which was required to be done.

For draw these right lines GB and HD. And for as much as the right lines AB and CD are equall, &amp; the lines AG and HC are also equall, and they contayne eqaul

angles, namely, right angles (by the definition of a square) therefore (by the 4. proposition) the base BG is equall to the base HD. And the triangle ABG is equall to the triangle CDH. Wherefore the doubles of the saide triangles are equall. Wherefore the square AE is equall to the square CF: which was required to be proued.

forasmuch as the angles are right angles, therfore also (by the 14. proposition) the right line FB is set directly to the right line BG. Drawe these right lines FC, AG, AF, and CG. Now for asmuch as the square AF is equal to the square CG, the triangle also AFB shalbe equall to the triangle CBG: put the triangle BCF cōmon to them both. Wherfore the whole triangle ACF is equall to the whole triangle CFG. Wherefore the line AG is a parallel vnto the line CF (by the 38. propositiō): for the triangles consist vpon one and the selfe same base, namely CF. Againe forasmuch as either of these angles AFG &amp; CBG is the halfe of a right angle, therfore (by the 17. proposition) the line AF is a parallel to the line CG. Wherfore the right line AF is equal to the right line CG (for the opposite sides of a parallelograme are equall). And forasmuch as there are two triangles ABF and BCG, whose alternate angles are equall, namely, the angle AFB to the angle BGC, and the angle BAF to the angle BCG, and one side of the one is equall to one side of the other, namely, the side which lieth betwene the equal angles, that is, the side AF to the side CG, therefore (by the 26. proposition) the side AB is equal to the side BC, and the side BF to the side BG. Wherefore it is proued that the squares of the lines AF and CG being equall, their sides also shalbe equall: which was required to be proued.

right lines AC and AG, not both on one and the same side, makyng the two side angles equall to two right angles: wherfore (by the 14. proposition) the lines AC and AG make directly one right line. And by the same reason the lines BA and AH make also directly one right line. And forasmuch as the angle DBC is equall to the angle FBA (for either of thē is a right angle) put the angle ABC common to them both: wherfore the whole angle DBA is equall to the whole angle FBC. And forasmuch as these two lines AB and BD are equal to these two lines BF and BC, the one to the other, and the angle DBA is equal to the angle FBC: therfore (by the 4. proposition) the base AD is equall to the base FC, and the triangle ABD is equall to the triangle FBC.

But the doubles of thinges equall, are (by the sixte common sentence) equall the one to the other. VVherfore the parallelograme BL is equall to the square GB. And in like sorte if (by the first peticion) there be drawen a right line from the point A to the point E, and an other from the point B to the point K, we may proue yt the parallelograme CL is equal to the square HC. VVherfore the whole square BDEC is equall to the two squares GB and HC. But the square BDEC is described vpon the line BC, and the squares GB and HC are described vppon the lines BA &amp; AC: wherfore the square of the side BC, is equal to the squares of the sides BA and AC.

Ioyne the two lines AB and AC at their endes in such sort that they make a right angle BAC. And draw a line from B to C. Then vppon the two endes B and C make two angles eche of which may be equal to halfe a right angle (This is done by erecting vpon the line BC perpē

lines, from the pointes B and C: and so (by the 9. proposition) deuiding

                     che of the right angles into two equall partes): and let the angles BCD and CBD be either of thē halfe of a right angle. And let the lines BD and CD concurre in the point D. Then I say that the two squares of the sides BD and CD, are equall to the two squares of the sides AB and AC. For (by the 6 proposition) the two sides DB and DC are equall, and the angle at the pointe D is (by the 32. proposition) a right angle. Wherefore the square of the side BC is equal to the squares of the two sides DB and DC (by the 47. proposition): but it is also equall to the squares of the two sides AB and AC (by the self same proposition) wherfore (by the common sentence) the squares of the two sides BD and DC are equall to the squares of the two sides AB and AC: which was required to be done.

                        An other aditiō of Pelitarius.
                     
                     If two right angled triangles haue equall bases. the squares of the two sides of the one are equall to the squares of the two sides of the other.
                  
                  This is manifest by the former construction and demonstration.

                        An other addition of Pelitarius.
                     
                     Two vnequall lines being geuen, to know how much the square of the one is greater then the square of the other.
                  
                  Suppose that there be two vnequal lines AB and BC: of which let AB be the greater. It is required to search out how much the square of AB excedeth the square of BC. That is I wil finde out the square, which with the square of the line BC shalbe equal to the square of the line AB. Put the lines A

B and BC directly, that they make both one right line: and making the centre the point B, and the space BA describe a circle ADE. And produce the line AC to the circumference, and let it concurre with it in the point E. And vpon the lyne AE and frō the point C erect (by the 11. proposition) a perpendiculer line CD, which produce till it concurre with the circumference in the point D: &amp; draw a line from B to D. Then I say, that the square of the line CD, is the excesse of the square of the line AB aboue the square of the line BC. For forasmuch as in the triangle BCD, the angle at the point C is a right angle, the square of the base BD is equall to the squares of the two sides BC and CD (by this 47. proposition). Wherefore also the square of the line AB is equall to the selfe same squares of the lines BC and CD. Wherefore the square of the line BC is so much lesse then the square of the line AB, as is the square of the line CD: which was required to search out.

                      The diameter of a square being geuen, to geue the square thereof.
                  This is easie to be done. For if vpon the two endes of the line be drawen two halfe right angles, and so be made perfect the triangle then shalbe described half of the square: the other halfe whereof also is after the same manner easie to be described.
                  
                     Hereby it is manifest, that the square of the diameter is double to that square whose diameter it is.

               The 34. Theoreme. The 48. Proposition. If the square which is made of one of the sides of a triangle, be equall to the squares which are made of the two other sides of the same triangle: the angle comprehended vnder those two other sides is a right angle.
               
                  SVppose that ABC be a triangle, and let the square which is made of one of the sides there, namely, of the side BC, be equall to the squares which are made of the sides BA and AC. Then I say that the angle BAC is a right angle. Rayse vp (by the 11. propositiō) from the point A vnto the right line AC a perpendicular line AD. And (by the thirde proposition) vnto the line AB put an equall line AD. And by the first peticion draw a right line from the point D to the poin

the line DA is equall to the line AB, the square which is made of the line DA is equall to the square whiche is made of the line AB Put the square of the line AC, common to them both. VVherefore the squares of the lines DA and AC are equal to the squares of the lines BA and AC. But (by the proposition going before) the square of the line DC is equal to ye squares of the lines. AD and AC. (For the angle DAC is a right angle) and the square of BC is (by supposition) equall to the squares of AB and AC. VVherefore the square of DC is equall to the square of BC: wherefore the side DC is equall to the side BC. And forasmuch as AB is equall to AD 
                        •
                     nd AC is common to them both, therefore these two sides DA and AC are equall to these two sides BA and AC, the one to the other, and the base DC is equall to the base BC
                        •
                      wherfore (by the 8. proposition) the angle DAC is equall to the angle BAC. But the angle DAC is a right angle, wherefore also the angle BAC is a right angle. If

therefore the square which is made of one of the sides of a triangle, be equall to the squares which are made of the two other sides of the same triangle, the angle comprehended vnder those two other sides is a right angle. which was required to be proued.

                        se of the former.
                  This proposition is the conuerse of the former, and is of Pelitarius demonstrated by an argument leading to an impossibilitie after this maner.
               
                  
                     An other Demonstration after Pelitarius.
                  Suppose that ABC be a triangle: &amp; let the square of the side AC, be equal to the squares of the two sides AB and BC. Then I say that the angle at the point B, which is opposite to the side AC, is a right angle. For if the angle at the point

                  B be not a right angle, then shal it be eyther greater or lesse thē a right angle. First let it be is greater. And let the angle DBC be a right angle, by erecting from the point B a perpendicular line vnto the line BC (by the 11. proposition) which let be BD: and put the line BD equall to the lyne AB (by the thirde proposition). And drawe a line from C to D. Now (by the former proposition) the square of the side CD shalbe equall to the squares of the two sides BD and BC: wherefore also to the squares of the two sides BA and BC. Wherefore the base CD shalbe equall to the base CA, when as their squares are equall: which is contrary to the 24. proposition. For forasmuch as the angle ABC is greater then the angle DBC, and the two sides AB and BC are equall to the two sides DB and BC, the one to the other, the base CA shall be greater then the base CD. It is also contrary to the 7. proposition, for from the two endes of one &amp; the same line, namely, frō the points B &amp; C should be drawn on one and the same side two lines BD and DC ending at the pointe D, equall to two other lines BA and AC drawen from the same endes and ending at an other point, namely, at A, which is impossible. By the same reason also may we proue that the whole angle at the pointe B is not lesse then a right angle. Wherfore it is a right angle: which was required to be proued.

                  The argument of the second booke.
                what is a Gnomō, and a right angled parallelogramme. Also in this booke are set forth the powers of lines, deuided euenly and vneuenly, and of lines added one to an other. The power of a line,
                  What is the power of a line.
                is the square of the same line: that is, a square, euery side of which is equall to the line. So that here are set forth the qualities and proprieties of the squares and right lined figures, which are made of lines &amp; of their parts.Many compē
                  dious rules of reckoning gathered one of this booke, and also many rules of Algebra. The Arithmetician also our of this booke gathereth many compendious rules of reckoning, and many rules also of Algebra, with the equatiōs therein vsed. The groundes also of those rules are for the most part by this second booke demonstrated.
                  Two wonderfull propositions in this booke.
                This booke moreouer contayneth two wonderfull propositions, one of an obtuse angled triangle, and the other of an acute: which with the ayde of the 47. proposition of the first booke of Euclide, which is of a rectangle triangle, of how great force and profite they are in matters of astronomy, they knowe which haue trauayled in that arte. VVherefore if this booke had none other profite be side, onely for these 2. propositions sake it were diligently to be embraced and studied.
            
               The definitions.
               
                  
                     1. Euery rectangled parallelogramme,
                        First definition.
                      is sayde to be contayned vnder two right lines comprehending a right angle.
                  A parallelogramme is a figure of fower sides,
                        What a parallelogramme is.
                      whose two opposite or contrary sides are equall the one to the other. There are of parallelogrammes fower kyndes,
                        Fower kindes of parallelogrammes.
                      a square, a figure of one side longer, a Rombus or diamond, and a Romboides or diamond like figure, as before was sayde in the 33. definition of the first booke. Of these fower sortes, the square and the figure of one side longer are onely right angled Parallelogrammes: for that all their angles are right angles. And either of them is contayned (according to this definition) vnder two right lynes whi
                        •
                     h concurre together, and cause the right angle, and containe the same. Of which two lines the one is the length of the figure, &amp; the other the breadth. The parallelogramme is imagined to be made by the draught or motion of one of the lines into the length of the other. As if two numbers shoulde be multiplied the one into the other. As the figure ABCD is a parallelograme, and is sayde to be contayned vnder the two right lines AB and AC, which contayne the right angle BAC, or vnder the two right lines AC and

CD, for they likewise contayne the right angle ACD: of which 2. lines the one, namely, AB is the length, and the other, namely, AC is the breadth. And if we imagine the line AC to be drawen or moued directly according to the lēgth

of the line AB, or contrary wise the line AB to be moued directly according to the length of the line AC, you shall produce the whole rectangle parallelogramme ABCD which is sayde to be contayned of them: euen as one number multiplied by an other produceth a plaine and righte angled superficiall number, as ye see in the figure here set, where the number of sixe

or sixe vnities, is multiplied by the number of fiue or by fiue vnities: of which multiplication are produced 30. which number being set downe and described by his vnities representeth a playne and a right angled number. VVherefore euen as equall numbers multipled by equal numbers produce numbers equall the one to the other: so rectangle parallelogrames which are comprehended vnder equal lines are equal the one to the other.

                     2. In euery parallelogramme, one of those parallelogrammes, which soeuer it be, which are about the diameter, together with the two supplementes, is called a Gnomon.
                  Those perticuler parallelogrames are sayde to be about the diameter of the parallelograme, which haue the same diameter which the whole parallelograme hath. And supplementes are such, which are without the diameter of the whole parallelograme. As of the parallelograme ABCD the partial or perticuler parallelogrames GKCF and EBKH are parallelogrames about the diameter, for that ech of them hath for his diameter a part of the diameter of the whole parallelogramme.

As CK and KB the perticuler diameters, are partes of the line CB, which is the diameter of the whole parallelogramme. And the two parallelogrammes AEGK and KHFD, are supplementes, because they are wythout the diameter of the whole parallelogramme, namely, CB. Now any one of those partiall parallelogrammes about the diameter together with the two supplementes make a gnomon. As the parallelograme EBKH, with the two supplementes AEGK and KHFD make the gnomon FGEH. Likewise the parallelogramme GKCF with the same two supplementes make the gnomon EHFG. And this diffinition of a gnomon extendeth it selfe, and is generall to all kyndes of parallelogrammes, whether they be squares or figures of one side longer or Rhombus or Romboides. To be shorte, if you take away from the whole parallelogramme one of the partiall parallelogrammes which are about the diameter

whether ye will, the rest of the figure is a gnomon.

                     e after the last proposition of the first booke addeth this propositiō.
                        A proposition added by Campane after the last proposition of the first booke.
                      
                     Two squares being geuen, to adioyne to one of them a Gnomon equall to the other square: which, for that as then it was not taught what a Gnomon is, I there omitted, thinking that it might more aptly be placed here. The doing and demonstration whereof, is thus.
                  Suppose that there be two squares AB and CD: vnto one of which, namely, vnto AB, it is required to adde a Gnomon equall to the other square, namely, to CD. Produce the side BF of the square AB directly

to the point E. and put the line FE equall to the side of the square CD. And draw a line from E to A. Now then forasmuch as EFA is a rectangle triangle, therefore (by the 47. of the first) the square of the line EA is equall to the squares of the lines EF &amp; FA. But the square of the line EF is equall to the square CD, &amp; the square of the side FA is the square AB. Wherefore the square of the line AE is equall to the two squares CD and AB. But the sides EF and FA are (by the 21. of the first) longer then the side AE, and the side FA is equall to the side FB. Wherfore the sides EF and FB are longer thē the side AE. Wherefore the whole line BE is longer then the line AE. From the line BE cut of a line equall to the line AE, which let be BC. And (by the 46. proposition) vpon the line BC describe a square, which let be BCGH: which shalbe equal to the square of the line AE, but the square of the line AE is equal to the two squares AB and DC. Wherefore the square BCGH is equal to the same squares. Wherfore forasmuch as the square BCGH is composed of the square AB and of the gnomon FGAH, the sayde gnomon shalbe equall vnto the square CD: which was required to be done.
                  
                     An other more redy way after Pelitarius.
                     Suppose that there be two squares, whose sides let be AB and BC. It is required vnto the square of the line AB, to adde a gnomon equall to the square of the line BC. Set the lines AB
                        
and BC in such sort that they make a right angle ABC. And draw a line frō 
                        A to C. And vpō the line AB describe a square which let be ABDE. And produce the line BA to the point F, and put the line BF equall to the line AC. And vpon the line BF describe a square which let be BFGH: which shalbe equal to the square of the line AC, whē as the lines BF and AC are equal: and therefore it is equal to the squares of the two lines AB and BC. Now forasmuch as the square BFGH is made complete by the square ABDE and by the gnomon FEGD, the gnomon FEGD shalbe equal to the square of the line BC: which was required to be done.
                  
               
            
            
               
               The 1. Theoreme. The 1. Proposition. If there be two right lines, and if the one of them be deuided into partes howe many soeuer: the rectangle figure comprehended vnder the two right lines, is equall to the rectangle figures whiche are comprehended vnder the line vndeuided, and vnder euery one of the partes of the other line.
               
                  SVppose that there be two right lynes A and BC and let one of them, namely, BC be deuided at all aduentures in the pointes D and E. Then I say that the rectangle figure comprehended vnder the lines A, and BC, is equall vnto the rectangle figure comprehended vnder the lines A, and BD, &amp; vnto the rectangle figure which is cōprehended vnder the lines A and DE, and also vnto the rectangle figure which is comprehended vnder the lines A and EC.
                  
                     Construction.
                   
                  For from the pointe Brayse vp (by the 11. of the first) vnto the right line BC a perpendiculer line BF, &amp; vnto the

line A (by the third of the first) put the line BG equall, and by the point G (by the 31. of the first) draw a parallel line vnto the right line BC and let the same be GM, and (by the selfe same) by ye points D, E, and C, draw vnto the line BG these parallel lines DK,
                  
                     Demonstratiō
                     
                   
                  EL and CH. Now then the parallelograme BH is equall to these parallelogrammes BK, DL, and EH. But the parallelograme BH is equall vnto that which is contayned vnder the lines A and BC. (For it is comprehēded vnder the lines GB &amp; BC, and the line GB is equall vnto the line A) And the parallelograme BK is equall to that which is contayned vnder the lines A and BD: (for it is comprehended vnder the line GB and BD, and BG is equall vnto A) And the parallelograme DL is equall to that which is contayned vnder the lines A and DE (for the line DK, that is, BG is equal vnto A) And moreouer likewise the parallelograme EH is equall to that which is contained vnder the lines A &amp; EC. VVherfore that which is comprehēded vnder ye lines A &amp; BC is equall to that which is comprehended vnder the lines A &amp; BD, &amp; vnto yt which is comprehēded vnder the lines A and DE, and moreouer vnto that which is comprehended vnder the lines A and EC. If therfore there be two right lines, and if the one of them be deuided into partes how many soeuer, the rectangle

figure comprehended vnder the two right lines, is equall to the rectangle figures which are comprehended vnder the line vndeuided and vnder euery one of the partes of the other line: which was required to be demonstrated.
               
               Because that all the Propositions of this second booke for the most part are true both in lines and in numbers, and may be declared by both: therefore haue I haue added to euery Proposition conuenient numbers for the manifestation of the same. And to the end the studious and diligent reader may the more fully perceaue and vnderstand the agrement of this art of Geometry with the science of Arithmetique, and how nere &amp; deare sisters they are together, so that the one cannot without great blemish be without the other, I haue here also ioyned a little booke of Arithmetique written by one Barlaam, a Greeke authour a man of greate knowledge. In whiche booke are by the authour demonstrated many of the selfe same proprieties and passions in number, which Euclide in this his second boke hath demonstrated in magnitude, namely, the first ten propositions as they follow in order. VVhich is vndoubtedly great pleasure to cō
                  sider, also great increase &amp; furniture of knowledge. VVhose Propositiōs are set orderly after the propositiōs of Euclide, euery one of Barlaam correspōdent to the same of Euclide. And doubtles it is wonderful to see how these two cōtrary kynds of quantity, quantity discrete or number, and quantity continual or magnitude (which are the subiectes or matter
                     •
                   of Arithmitique and Geometry) shoulde haue in them one and the same proprieties common to them both in very many points, and affections, although not in all. For a line may in such sort be deuided, that what proportion the whole hath to the greater parte the same shall the greater part haue to the lesse. But that can not be in number. For a number can not so be deuided, that the whole number to the greater part thereof, shall haue that proportion which the greater part hath to the lesse, as Iordane very playnely proueth in his booke of Arithmetike, which thynge Campane also (as we shall afterward in the 9. booke after the 15. proposition see) proueth. And as touching these tenne firste propositions of the seconde booke of Euclide, demonstrated by Barlaam in numbers, they are also demōstrated of Campane after the 15. proposition of the 9. booke, whose demonstrations I mynde by Gods helpe to set forth when I shal come to the place. They are also demō
                  strated of Iordane that excellet learned authour in the first booke of his Arithmetike. In the meane tyme I thought it not amisse here to set forth the demonstrations of Barlaam, for that they geue great light to the seconde booke of Euclide, besides the inestimable pleasure, which they bring to the studious considerer. And now to declare the first Proposition by numbers. I haue put this example following.
               Take two numbers the one vndeuided as 74. the other deuided into what partes and how many you list, as 37. deuided into 20. 10. 5. and 2
                     •
                   which altogether make the whole 37. Then if you multiply the number vndeuided, namely, 74, into all the partes of the number deuided as into 20. 10. 5. and 2. you shall produce 1480. 740. 370. 148. which added together make 2738: which self number is also produced if you multiplye the two numbers first geuen the one into the other. As you see in the example on the other side set.

                  The first Proposition.
                  
                     Two numbers beyng geuen, if the one of them be deuided into

any numbers how many soeuer:
                     
                        Barlaam.
                      
                     the playne or superficiall number which is produced of the multiplication of the two numbers first geuen the one into the other, shall be equall to the superficiall nū
                        bers which are produced of the multiplication of the number not deuided into euery part of the number deuided.
                  
                  Suppose that there be two numbers AB and C. And deuide the number AB into certayne other numbers how many soeuer, as into AD, DE, and EB. Then I say that the superficiall number which is produced of the multiplication of the number C into the number AB is equall to the superficiall numbers which are produced of the multiplication of the number C into the nū
                     ber AD, and of C into DE, and of C into EB. For let F be the superficiall number produced of the multiplication of the number C into the number AB, and let GH be the superficiall number produced of the multiplication of C into AD: And let HI be produced of the multiplication of C into DE: a
                        •
                     d finally of the multiplication of C into EB let there be produced the number

                     IK. Now forasmuch as AB multiplying the number C produced the number F: therefore the number C measureth the number F by the vnities which are in the number AB. And by the same reason may be proued that the number C doth also measure the number GH, by the vnities which are in the number AD, and that it doth measure the number HI by the vnities which are in the nūber DF and finally that it measureth the number IK by the vnities which are in the number EB. Wherefore the nū
                     ber C measureth the whole number GK by the vnities which are in the number AB. But it before measured the number F by the vnities which are in the number AB, wherfore either of these numbers F and GK is equemultiplex to the number C. But numbers which are equemultiplices to one &amp; the selfe same numbers are equall the one to the other (by the 6. definition). Wherfore the number F is equall to the number GK. But the number F is the superficiall number produced of the multiplication of the nū
                     ber C into the number AB: and the number GK is composed of the superficiall numbers produced of the multiplication of the nūber C not deuided into euery one of the numbers AD, DE, and EB. If therefore there be two numbers geuen and the one of them be deuided &amp;c. Which was required to be proued.
               
            
            
               The 2. Theoreme. The 2. Proposition. If a right line be deuided by chaunce, the rectangles figures which are comprehended vnder the whole and euery one of the partes, are equall to the square whiche is made of the whole.
               SVppose that the right line AB be by chaunse denided

in the point C. Then I say that the rectangle figure comprehended vnder AB and BC together with the rectangle comprehended vnder AB and AC is equall vnto the square made of AB.Construction. Describe (by the 46. of the first) vpon AB a square ADEB: and (by the 31 of the first) by the point C draw a line parallel vnto either of these lines AD a

                   Now is the parallelogramme AE equall to the parallelogrammes AF and CE, by the first of this booke. But AE is the square made of AB. And AF is the rectangle parallelogramme comprehended vnder the lines BA and AC: for it is comprehended vnder the lines DA and AC: but the line AD is equall vnto the line AB. And likewise the parrallelogramme CE is equall to that which is contayned vnder the lynes AB and BC: for the line BE is equal vnto the line AB. VVherfore that which is contayned vnder BA and AC together with that which is contayned vnder the lines AB and BC, is equall to the square made of the line AB. If therefore a right line be deuided by chaunce, the rectāgle figures which are comprehended vnder the whole, and euery one of the partes, are equall to the square which is made of the whole: which was required to be demonstrated.
               
                  An other demonstration of Campane.
                  
                     Suppose that the line AB be deuided into

the lines AC, CD, and DB. Then I say that the square of the whole line AB, which let be AEBF, is equal to the rectangle figures which are contayned vnder the whole and euery one of the partes: for take the line K, which let be equal to the line AB. Now then by the first proposition the rectangle figure contained vnder the lines AB and K, is equall to the rectangle figures contayned vnder the line K and al the partes of the line AB. But that which is contayned vnder the lines K and AB is equall to the square of the line AB, and the rectangle figures contayned vnder the line K and al the partes of AB, are equall to the rectangle figures contayned vnder the line AB and all the partes of the line AB: for the lines AB and K are equall: wherefore that is manifest which was required to be proued.
               
               
                  An example of this Proposition in numbers.
                  Take a number, as 11. and deuide it into two partes, namely, 7. and 4: and multiply 11. into 7, and then into 4. and there shalbe produced 77. and 44: both which numbers added together make 121. which is equall to the square number produced of the multiplication of the number 11. into himselfe, as you see in the example.

                     The second Proposition.
                     
                        
                           Barlaam.
                        
                        If a number geuen be deuided into two other numbers: the superficiall numbers, which are produced of the multiplication of the whole into either part, added together, are equall to the square number of the whole number geuen.
                     
                     Suppose that the number geuen be AB: and let it be deuided into two other numbers AC and CB. Then I say that the two superficiall numbers, which are produced of the multiplication of AB into AC, and of AB into BC, those two superficiall numbers (I say) beyng added together, shalbe equall to the square number produced of the multiplicatiō of the number AB into it selfe. For let the number AB multiplying it selfe produce the number D. Let the number AC also multiplying the number AB
                        
produce the number EF: agayne let the number CB multipliing

the selfe same number AB produce the number FG. Now forasmuch as the number AC multiplying the number AB produced the number EF: therefore the number AB measureth the number EF by the vnities which are in AC. Againe forasmuch as the number CB multiplied the number AB and produced the number FG: therfore the number AB measureth the number FG by the vnities which are in the number CB. But the same number AB before measured the number EF by the vnities which are in the number AC. Wherefore the number AB measureth the whole number 
                           
                              •
                           G by the vnities whcih are in AB. Farther forasmuch as the number AB multiplying it selfe produced the number D: therefore the number AB measureth the number D by the vnities which are in himselfe. Wherfore it measureth either of these numbers, namely, the number D, and the number EG, by the vnities which are in himselfe. Wherfore how multiplex the number D is to the number AB, so multiplex is the number EG to the same number AB. But numbers which are equemultiplices to one and the selfe same number
                           •
                         are equal the one to the other. Wherefore the number D is equall to the number EG. And the number D is the square number made of the number AB, and the number EG is composed of the two superficiall numbers produced of AB into BC, and of BA into AC. Wherefore the square number produced of the number AB is equall to the superficial numbers, produced of the number AB into the number BC, and of AB into AC, added together. If therefore a number be deuided into two other numbers &amp;c. which was required to be proued.

Then I say that the rectangle figure comprehēded vnder the lines AB and BC is equall vnto the rectangle figure comprehended vnder the lines AC and CB, and also vnto the square which is made of the line BC.Construction. Describe (by the 46. of the first) vpon the line BC

AE is equall vnto the parallelogrammes AD and CE.Demonstratiō
                   And AE is the rectangle figure comprehended vnder the lines AB and BC. For it is comprehended vnder the lines AB and BE,

which line BE is equall vnto the line BC. And the parallelograme AD is equall to that which is contayned vnder the lines AC and CB: for the line DC is equall vnto the line CB And DB is the square which is made of the lyne CB. VVherfore the rectangle figure comprehended vnder the lynes AB and BC is equall to the rectangle figure comprehended vnder the lines AC and CB &amp; also vnto the square which is made of the line BC. If therfore a right line be deuided by chaunce, the rectangle figure comprehended vnder the whole and one of the partes, is equall to the rectangle figure comprehended vnder the partes, and vnto the square which is made of the foresayd part: which was required to be proued.
               
                  An example of this Proposition in numbers.
                  Suppose a number, namely, 14. to be deuided into two partes 8. and 6. The whole number 14. multiplied into 8. one of his partes, produceth 112: the partes 8. &amp; 6. multiplied the one into the other produce 48, which added to 64 (which is the square of 8. the former part of the number) amounteth also to 112: whiche is equall to the former summe. As you see in the example.

                           Barlaam.
                        
                        If a number geuen be deuided into two numbers: the superficiall number which is produced of the multiplication of the whole into one of the partes, is equall to the superficiall number which is produced of the partes the one into the other, and to the square number produced of the foresayd part.
                     
                     Suppose that the number geuen be AB, which let be deuided into two numbers AC and CB. Then I say that the superficiall number whiche is produced of the multiplication of the number AB into the number BC, is equall to the superficiall number which is produced of the multiplication of the number AC into the number CB, and to the square number produced of the number CB. For let the number AB multiplieng the number CB produce the number D.

But the angle ADB is (by the 5. of the first) equall vnto the angle ABD: for the side BA is equall vnto the side AD (by the definition of a square). VVherfore the angle CGB is equall vnto the angle GBC: wherfore (by the 6. of the first) the side BC is equall vnto the side CG. But CB is equall vnto GK

                   and CG is equall vnto KB wherfore GK is equall vnto KB. VVherfore the figure CGKB consisteth of foure equall sides. I say also that it is a rectangle figure. For forasmuch as CG is a parallel vnto BK &amp; vpon thē falleth a right line CB, therfore (by ye 
                  29. of the 1.) the angles KBC, and GCB are equal vnto two right angles. But the angle KBC is a right angle, wherfore ye angle. BCG is also a right angle. VVherfore (by the 34. of the first) the angles opposite vnto them, namely, CGK, and GKB are right angles. VVherfore CGKB is a rectangle figure. And it was before proued that the sides are equall. VVherfore it is a square, and it is described vpon the line B

And AG is that which is contayned vnder AC and CB, for CG is equal vnto CB, wherfore GE is equall to that which is contained vnder AC and CB. VVherefore AG and GE are equall vnto that which is comprehended vnder AC and CB twise. And the squares HF and CK are made of the lines AC and CB.

as the line AB is equall vnto ye line AD, ye angle ABD is (by the 5. of the first) equall vnto the angle ADB. And forasmuch as the three angles of euery triangle are equal to two right angles (by the 32. of the first)
                        •
                      therefore ye three angles of the triangle ABD, namely, the angles ADB, DBA, and BAD, are equall to two right angles. But the angle BAD is a right angle, wherefore the angles remayning ABD, and ADB, are equall vnto one right angle: and they are equall ye one to the other, wherfore either of these

angles ABD, &amp; ADB, is the halfe of a right angle. And the angle BCG is a right angle, for it is equall vnto the opposite angle at the point A (by the 29. of the first). VVherefore the angle remayning CGB is the halfe of a right angle. VVherefore the angle CGB is equal vnto the angle CBG: wherefore also the side BC is equall vnto the side CG. But BC is equall vnto GK, and CG is equal vnto BK. VVherefore the figure CK consisteth of equall sides: and in it is a right angle CBK. VVherefore CK is a square, and is made of the line BC. And by the same reason HF is a square, and is equall vnto that square which is made of the line AC. VVherefore CK and HF are squares, and are equall to those squares which are made of the lines AC and CB. And forasmuch as AG is equall vnto EG: and AG is that which is contayned vnder AC and CB, for GC is equal vnto CB: wherefore EG also is equall to that which is cōprehended vnder AC and CB: wherefore AG and EG are equall vnto that rectangle figure which is comprehended vnder AC, and CB twise. And CK, and HF are equal vnto the squares which are made of AC, and CB: wherefore CK, HF, AG, and GE are equal vnto those squares which are made of AC, and CB, and vnto that rectangle figure which is comprehended vnder AC and CB twise. But CK, HF, AG, and GE are the whole square AE which is made of AB. VVherefore the square which is made of AB, is equall to the squares which are made of AC and CB, and vnto the rectangle figure which is comprehended vnder AC and CB twise: which was required to be demonstrated.
                  Hereby it is manifest that the parallelogrames which consist about the diameter of a square must needes be squares.A Corollary.

                  Suppose a number namely, 17. to be deuided into two partes 9. and 8. The whole number 17. multiplied into himselfe, produceth 289. The square numbers of 9. and 8. are 81. and 64: the numbers produced of the multiplication of the partes the one into the other twise are 72. and 72: which two numbers added to the square numbers of 9. and 8. namely, to 81. and 64. make also 289. which is equall to the square number of the whole number 17. As you see in the example.

                           Barlaam.
                        
                        If a number geuen be deuided into two numbers: the square number of the whole, is equall to the square numbers of the partes, and to the superficiall number which is produced of the multiplication of the partes the one into the other twise.
                     
                     Suppose that the number geuen be AB: which let be deuided into two numbers AC and CB. Then I say that the square number of the whole number AB, is equall to the squares of the partes, that is, to the squares of the numbers AC and CB, and to the superficiall number produced of the multiplication of the numbers AC and CB the one into the other twise. Let the square number produced of the multiplication of the whole number AB into himselfe be D. And let CA multiplied into himselfe produce the number EF: And CB multiplyed into it selfe let it produce GH: and finally of the multiplicatiō of the numbers AC and CB the one into the other twise let there be produced either of these superficiall numbers FG and HK. Now forasmuche as the number AC multiplying it self produced the number EF: therefore the number AC measureth the number EF by the vnities which are in it selfe. And forasmuch as the number CB multiplyed the number CA and produced the number FG: therefore

the number AC measureth the nūber FG by the vnities

whiche are in the number CB. But it before also measured the number EF by the vnities which are in it selfe. Wherefore the number AB multiplying the number AC produceth the number EG. And therefore the number EG is the superficiall number produced of the multiplication of the number BA into the number AC. And by the same reason may we proue that the number GK is the superficiall number produced of the multiplication of the number AB into the number BC. Farther the number D is the square of the number AB. But if a number be deuided into two numbers, the square of the whole number is equall to the two superficiall numbers which are produced of the multiplication of the whole into either the partes (by the 2. Theoreme.) Wherefore the square number D is equall to the superficiall number EK. But the number EK is composed of the squares of the numbers AC and CB, and of the superficial number which is produced of the multiplication of the nūber AC and CB the one into the other twise: &amp; the number D is the square of the whole number AB. Wherfore the square number produced of the multiplication of the number AB into himselfe, is equall to the square numbers of the partes, that is, to the square numbers of the nūbers AC and CB, and to the superficiall number produced of the multiplication of the numbers AC and CB, the one into the other twise. If therefore a number geuen be deuided into two numbers &amp;c. Which was required to be proued.
                  
               
            
            
               The 5. Theoreme. The 5. Proposition. If a right line be deuided into two equall partes, &amp; into two vnequall partes: the rectangle figures comprehended vnder the vnequall part

                   of the whole, together with the square of that which is betwene the sectiōs, is equal to the square which is made of the halfe.
               SVppose that the right line AB be deuided into two equall partes in the point C, and into two vnequall partes in the point D. Then I say that the rectangle figure comprehended vnder AD and DB together with the square which is made of CD, is equall to the square which is made of CB.Construction. Describe (by the 46. of the first)

vppon CB a square, and let the same be CEFB. And (by the first peticion) drawe a line from E to B. And by ye point D drawe (by the 3

                   and let the same be AK. And forasmuch as (by the 43. of the first) the supplement CH is equall to the supplemēt HF

                   put the figure DO cō
                  mon vnto them both. VVherefore the whole figure CO is equall to the whole figure DF. But the figure CO is equall vnto the figure AL, for ye line AC is equall vnto the line CB. VVherefore the figure AL also is equal vnto the figure DF. Put the figure CH common vnto them both. VVherfore the whole figure AH is equall vnto the figures DL and DF. But AH is equall to that which is cō
                  tayned vnder the lines AD and DB, for DH is equall vnto DB. And the figures FD &amp; DL are the Gnomon

MNX. VVherfore ye Gnomon MNX is equall to that which is contayned vnder AD and DB. Put the figure LG cō
                  mon vnto them both, which is equal to the square which is made of CD. VVherefore the Gnomō MNX and the figure LG are equall to the rectangle figure cō
                  prehended vnder AD and DB and vnto the square which is made of CD. But the Gnomon MNX, and the figure LG are the whole square CEFB, which is made of BC. VVherefore the rectangle figure comprehended vnder AD and DB, together with the square which is made of CD, is equall to the square which is made of CB. If therefore a right line be deuided into two equall parts, and into two vnequall partes, the rectangle figure comprehended vnder the vnequall partes of the whole, together with the square of that which is betwene the sections, is equall to the square which is made of the halfe: which was required to be proued.
               
                  This Proposition also is of greate vse in Algebra. By it is demonstrated that equation wherein the greatest and least karectes or numbers are equall to the middle.
               
               
                  An example of this proposition in numbers.
                  Take any number as 20: and deuide it into two equall partes 10. and 10. and then into two vnequall partes as 13. and 7. And take the differēce of the halfe to one of the vnequall partes which is 3. And multiply the vnequall partes, that is, 13 and 7. the one into the other, which make 91. take also the square of 3. which is 9. and adde it to the foresayde number 91: and so shall there be made 100. Then multiply the halfe of the whole number into himself, that is, take the square of 10. which is 100. which is equal to the number before produced of the multiplication of the vnequal parts the one into the other, &amp; of the difference into it selfe which is also 100. As you se in the example.

                     The fifth proposition.
                     
                        If an euen number be deuided into two equall partes, and againe also into two vnequall partes: the superfic
                              •
                           all number which is produced of the multiplication of the vnequall partes the one into the other, together with the square of the number set betwene the parts, is equal to the square of halfe the number.
                     
                     Suppose that AB be an euen number: which let be

deuided into two equall numbers AC and CB, and into two vnequall numbers AD and DB. Then I say, that the square number which is produced of the multiplication of the halfe number CB into it selfe, is equall to the superficiall number produced of the multiplication of the vnequall numbers AD and DB the one into the other, and to the square number produced of the number CD which is set betwene the sayde vnequall partes. Let the square number produced of the multiplication of the halfe number CB into it selfe be E. And let the superficiall number produced of the multiplication of the vnequal nūbers AD and DB the one into the other, be the number FG: and let the square of the number DC which is set betwene the partes be GH. Now forasmuch as the number BC is deuided into the numbers BD and DC, therfore the square of the number BC, that is, the number E, is equall to the squares of the numbers BD and DC, and to the superficiall number which is composed of the multiplication of the numbers BD and DC the one into the other twise, (by the 4. proposition of this boke) Let the square of the number BD be the number KL: &amp; let NX be the square of the number DC: and finally of

the multiplication of the numbers BD and DC the one into the other twi

                           •
                         And forasmuch as the number BD multiplying it selfe produced the number KL, therefor it measureth it by the vnities which are in it selfe. More ouer forasmuch as the number CD multiplying the number BD produced the number LM, therefore also DB measureth LM by the vnities which are in the number CD: but it before measured the number KL by the vnities which are in it selfe. Wherefore the number DB measureth the whole number KM by the vnities which are in CB. But the number CB is equall to the number CA. Wherefore the number DB measureth the number KM by the vnities which are in CA. Agayne forasmuch as the nū

Wherfore the number BD measureth the whole number KN by the vnities which are in the number AD. Wherefore the number FG

                           •
                         Wherefore also the number FH is equall to the number E. And the number FH is the superficial number produced of the multiplication of the numbers AD and DB the one into the other together with the square of the number DC. And the number E is the square of the number CB. Wherfore the superficiall number produced of the multiplication of the vnequal partes AD and DB the one into the other, together with the square of the nū
                        ber DC which is set betwene those vnequall partes, is equall to the square of the number CB, which is the halfe of the whole number AB. If therfore an euen number be deuided into two equall partes, &amp;c. which was required to be proued.
                  
               
            
            
               The 6. Theoreme. The 6. Proposition. If a right line be deuided into two equal partes, and if vnto it be added an other right line directly, the rectangle figure contayned vnder the whole line with that which is added, &amp; the line which is addedt, ogether with the square which is made of the halfe, is equall to the square which is made of the halfe line and of that which is added as of one line.
               SVppose that the righte

line AB be deuided into two equall partes in ye point C: &amp; let there added vnto it an other right line DB directly, that is to say, which being ioyned vnto AB make both one right line AD. Then I say, that the rectangle figure comprehended vnder AD and DB, together

with the square whiche is made of BC is equall to the square whiche, is made of DC. Describe (by the 46. of the 1.) vpon CD a square CEFD, and (by the first peticion) draw a line from D to E: and (by the 31. of the first) by ye point B draw a line parallel vnto either of these lines EC &amp; DF, cutting the diameter DE in the point H, and let the same be BG, &amp; (by the self same) by ye point H draw to either of these lines AD and EF a parallel line KM: and moreouer by the pointe A drawe a line parallel

to either of these lines CL and DM: and let the same be AK. And forasmuch as AC is equall vnto CB, therfore (by the 36. of the first) the figure AL is equal vnto the figure CH. But (by the 43. of the first) CH is equal vnthe figure HF, wherfore AL is equall vnto HF. Put the figure CM common to them both, wherfore the whole line AM is equal vnto the gnomon NXO. But AM is that which is contayned vnder AD and DB: for DM is equal vnto DB: wherfore the gnomon NXO, is equall vnto the rectangle figure contained vnder AD and DB. Put the figure LG common to them both, which is equall to the square which is made of CB. VVherefore the rectangle figure which is contayned vnder AD and DB together with the square which is made of CB is equall to the gnomon NXO, and vnto LG. But the gnomon NXO and LG are the whole square CEFD which is made of CD. VVherfore the rectangle figure contayned vnder AD and DB together with the square which is made of CB is equall to the square which is made of CD. If therfore a right line be deuided into two equall partes, and vnto it be added an other right line directly: the rectangle figure contayned vnder the whole line with that which is added, and the line which is added, together with the square which is made of the halfe, is equall to the square which is made of the halfe line and of that which is added as of one line: which was required to be demonstrated.
               
                  By this Proposition (besides many other vses) is in Algebra demonstrated that equation wherin the two lesse numbers be equall to the number of the greatest denomination.
               
               
                  An example of this proposition in numbers.
                  Take any euen number as 18. and adde vnto it any other number as 3. which make in all 21. And multiply 21. into the number added, namely, into 3. which maketh 63. Take also the halfe of the whole euen number, that is, of 18. which is 9. And multiply 9. into it self which maketh 81. which adde vnto 63. (the number produced of the whole euen number, and the number added into the number added) and you shal make 144.

Then adde 9. the halfe of the whole euen number vnto 3. the number added which maketh 12. And multiply 12. into it selfe, that is, take the square of 12. which is 144. which is equall to the number composed of the multiplication of the whole number and the number added into the number added, and of the square of the number added, which is also 144. As you see in the example.

If therfore a right line be deuided by chaunce: the square which is made of the whole together with the square which is made of one of the partes, is equall to the rectangle figure which is contayned vnder the whole and the sayd part twise, and to the square which is made of the other parte: whiche was required to be demonstrated.

                     The squares of two vnequall lines do exceede the rectangle figures contayned vnder the said lines by the square of the excesse wherby the greater lyne excedeth the lesse.
                  
                  For if the line AB be the greater, and the line BC the lesse, it is manifest that the squares of AB and BC are equall to the rectangle figure contayned vnder the lynes AB and BC twise, and moreouer to the square of the line AC, wherby the line AB excedeth the line BC.

                  An example of this proposition in numbers.
                  Take any number as 13. and deuide it into two partes as into 4. &amp; 9. Take the square of 13. which is 169. take also the square of 4. which is 16. and adde these two squares together which make 185. Then multiply the whole number 13. into 4. the foresayde part twise, and you shall produce 52. and 52
                        •
                      take also the square of the other part, that is, of 9. which is 81. And adde it to the productes of 13. into 4. twise, that is, vnto 52. and 52. and those three numbers added together shall make 185. whiche is equall to the number composed of the squares of the whole and of one of the partes, which is also 185. As you see in the example.

                  The seuenth proposition.
                  
                     If a number be deuided into two numbers: the square of the whole number together with the square of one of the partes, is equall to the superficiall number produced of the multiplication of the whole number into the foresaid part twise, together with the square of the other part.
                  
                  Suppose that the number AB be deuided into the numbers AC and CB. Then I
                     
say that the square numbers of the numbers BA and AC are equall to the superficiall number produced of the multiplicatiō of the number BA into the number AC twise, together with the square o
                        •
                      the number BC. For forasmuch as (by the 4. of this booke) the square of the number AB is equall to the squares of the numbers BC and CA, and to the superficiall number produced of the multiplication of the numbers BC and CA the one into the other twise: adde the square of the number AC common to them both. Wherfore the square of the number AB together with the square of the number AC is equall to two squares of the number AC and to one square of the number CB, and also to the superficiall number produced of the multiplication of the numbers BC and CA the one into the other twise. And forasmuch as the superficial number produced of the multiplication of the numbers BA and CA the one into the other once, is equall to the superficiall nūber produced of the multiplication of BC into CA once, and to the square of the number CA (by the third of this booke)
                        •
                      therfore the number produced of the multiplication of BA into AC twise is equall to the number produced of the multiplication of BC into CA twise, and also to two squares of the number CA. Adde the square number of BC common to them both. Wherfore two squares of the number AC and one square of the number CB together with the superficiall number produced

of the multiplication of BC into CA twise are equall to the superficiall number produced of the multiplication of the number BA into the number AC twise together with the square of the number CB. Wherfore the square of the number AB together with the square of the nūber AC is equal to the super

               The 8. Theoreme. The 8. Proposition. If a right line be deuided by chaūce, the rectangle figure comprehended vnder the whole and one of the partes foure times, together with the square which is made of the other parte, is equall to the square which is made of the whole and the foresaid part as of one line.
               SVppose that there be a certayne right line AB, and let it be deuided by chaunce in the point C. Then I say that the rectangle figure comprehended vnder AB and BC foure tymes, together with the square which is made of AC is equall to the square made of AB and BC as of one line. Extend the line AB (by the second peticion). And (by the third of the first) vnto CB put an equall lyne BD. And (by the 46. of the first) describe vppon AD a square AEFD. And describe a double figure. And forasmuch as CB is equall vnto BD, but CB is equall vnto GK (by the 34. of the first) and likewise BD

is equall vnto KN, wherefore GK also is equall vnto KN: and by the same reason also PR, is equall vnto RO. And forasmuch as BC is equall vnto BD, and GK vnto KN, therfore (by the 36. of the first) the figure CK is equall vnto the figure KD, and the

figure GR is equall vnto the figure RN. But (by ye 
                  43. of ye 
                  1.) the figure CK is equal vnto the figure RN: for they are the supplementes of the parallelograme CO. VVherfore the figure KD also is equall vnto the figure NR. VVherefore these figures DK, CK, GR, RN, are equall the one to the other. VVherefore those foure are quadruple to the figure CK. Agayne forasmuch as CB is equall vnto BD, but BD is equall vnto BK, that is, vnto CG. And CB is equall vnto GK that is vnto GP: therfore CG is equall vnto GP. And forasmuch as CG is equall vnto GP, and PR is equall vnto RO, therefore the figure AG is equall vnto the figure MP, and the figure PL is equall vnto the figure RF. But the figure MP is (by the 43. of the first) equall vnto the figure PL, for they are the supplementes of the parallelogramme ML: wherfore the figure also AG is equall vnto the figure RF. VVherfore these foure figures AG, MP, PL, and RF are equall the one to the other: wherfore those foure are quadruple to the figure AG. And it is proued, that these foure figures CK, KDGR, RN, are quadruple to the figure CK. VVherfore the eight figures which contayne the gnomon STV, are quadruple to the figure AK. And forasmuch as the figure AK, is that which is contayned vnder the lines AB and BD, for the line BK is equall vnto the line BD: therfore that whiche is contayned vnder the lines AB and BD foure tymes is quadruple vnto the figure AK. And it is proued that the gnomon STV is quadruple to AK
                     •
                   VVherfore that which is contayned vnder the lines AB and BD foure tymes is equall vnto the gnomō STV. Put the figure XH which is equall to the square made of AC common vnto them both. VVherfore the rectangle figure comprehended vnder the lines AB and BD foure tymes together with the square which is made of the line AC, is equall to the gnomon STV, and vnto the figure XH. But the gnomon STV: and the figure XH are the whole square AEFD, which is made of AD: wherfore that which is contayned vnder the lines AB and BD foure times together with the square which is made of AC, is equall to the square which is

made of AD. But BD is equall vnto BC. VVherfore the rectangle figure contayned foure tymes vnder AB and BC together with the square which is made of AC, is equall vnto the square which is made of AD, that is, vnto that whiche is made of AB and BC as of ou

If therefore a right lyne be deuided by chaunce, the rectangle figure comprehended vnder the whole and one of the partes foure tymes, together with the square which is made on the other part, is equall to the square which is made of the whole and the foresaid part, as of one line, which was required to be demonstrated.

                     Take any number as 17. and deuide it into two partes, as into 6. and 11. And multiply 17. into 6. namely one of the partes foure tymes, and

Then adde the whole number 17. to the foresaid part 6. which make 23. &amp; take the square of 23. which is 529. which is equall to the number composed of the whole into the sayd part foure tymes, aud of the square of the other part, which number composed is also 529.

                     If a number be deuided into two numbers, the superficiall number produced of the multiplication of the whole into one of the partes foure tymes, together with the square of the other parte, is equall to the square of the number composed of the whole number and the foresayd part.
                  
                  Suppose that the number AB be deuided into two numbers AC and CB. Then I say that the superficiall number produced of the multiplication of the number AB in to the number CB foure tymes together with the square of the number AC, is equall to the square of the number composed of the numbers AB &amp; CB. For vnto the number BC let the number BD be equall. Now forasmuch as the square of the

number AD is equal to the squares of the numbers AB and BD, &amp; to the superficiall number produced of the multiplication of the numbers AB &amp; BD the one into the other twise (by the 4. of this booke) And the number BD is equall to the number BC: therefore the square of the number AD is equall to the squares of the numbers AB and BC, and to the superficiall number produced of the multiplication of the numbers AB and BC the one into the other twise. But the squares of the numbers AB and BC are equall vnto the superficiall number produced of the multiplication of the numbers AB and BC the one into the other twise, and to the square of AC (by the former proposition) Wherfore the square of the number AD is equall to the superficial number produced of the multiplication of the nū
                     bers AB and BC the one into the other foure tymes, and to the square of the number AC. But the square of the number AD is the square of the number composed of the numbers AB and BC: for the number BD is equal to the number BC. Wherfore the square of the number composed of the numbers AB and BC is equall to the superficiall number produced of the multiplication of the numbers AB and BC the one into the other foure tymes, &amp; to the square of the number AC. If therfore a number be deuided into two numbers, &amp;c.

And (by the 31. of the first) by the point D draw vnto the line EC a parallel lyne, and let the same be DF: and (by the selfe same) by the point F draw vnto AB a line parallel, and let the same be FG. And (by the first peticion) draw a line from A to F.Demonstration. And forasmuch as AC is equall vnto CE, therfore (by the 5. of the first) the angle EAC is equal vnto the angle CEA. And forasmuch as the angle at the point C is a right angle: therfore the angles remayning EAC, and AEC, are equall vnto one right angle, wherefore eche of these angles EAC and AEC is the halfe of a right angle.

inwarde and opposite angle ECB. VVherefore the angle remayning BFD is the halfe of a right angle. VVherfore the angle at the point B is equall vnto the angle DFB. VVherfore (by the 6. of the first) the side DF is equall vnto the side DB. And forasmuch as AC is equall vnto CE, therfore the square which is made of AC is equall vnto the square which is made of CE. VVherefore the squares which are made of CA and CE are double to the square which is made of AC. But (by the 47. of the first) the square which is made of EA is equall to the squares which are made of AC and CE (For the angle ACE is a right angle) wherefore the square of AE is double to the square of AC. Agayne forasmuch as EG, is equall vnto GF, the square therfore which is made of EG is equal to the square which is made of GF. VVherfore the squares which are made of GE and GF are double to the square which is made of GF. But (by the 47. of the first) the square which is made of EF is equall to the squares which are made of EG and GF. VVherfore the square which is made of EF is double to the square which is made of GF. But GF is equall vnto CD. VVherefore the square which is made of

EF is double to the square which is made of CD. And the square whiche is made of AE is double to the square which is made of AC. VVherefore the squares which are made of AE and EF are double to ye squares which are made of AC and CD.

                     If a number be deuided into two equall numbers, and againe be deuided into two inequall partes: the square numbers of the vnequall numbers, are double to the square which is made of the multiplication of the halfe number into it selfe, together with the square whiche is made of the number set betwene them.
                  
                  For let the number AB being an euen number be deuided into two equall numbers AC &amp; CB: &amp; into two vnequall nūbers AD and DB. Then I say that the square numbers of AD and DB, are double to the squares which are made of the multiplication of the numbers AC and CD into themselues. For forasmuch as the number AB is an euen number, and is deuided also into two equal numbers AC and CB, and afterward into two vnequal nūbers AD and DB: therefore the superficial nūber produced of the multiplicatiō of the nūbers AD &amp; DB, th'one into the other, together with the square of the number DC, is equal to the square of the number AC (by the fift proposition) Wherfore the superficiall number produced of the multiplication of the numbers AD and DB the one into the other twise, together with two squares of the number CD, is double to the square of the number AC. Forasmuch as also the number AB is deuided into two equal numbers AC and CB, therfore the square number of AB is quadruple to the square number produced of the multiplication of the number AC into it selfe (by the 4. proposition). Moreouer forasmuch as the superficiall number produced of the multiplication of the numbers AD &amp; DB the one into the other twise together, with two squares of the number DC, is double to the square number of CA
                     
                        •
                      &amp;

forasmuch as there are two numbers, of whiche the one is quadruple to

one and the selfe same number, and the other is double to the same number: therefore that number whiche is quadruple shall be double to that number whiche is double. Wherefore the square of the number AB is double to the number produced of the multiplicatiō of the numbers AD and DB the one into the other twise together with the two squares of the number DC. Wherfore the number which is produced of the multiplication of the numbers AD and DB the one into the other twise, is lesse thē halfe of the square of the number AB by the two squares of the numbers DC. And forasmuch as the nūber produced of the multiplication of the nūbers AD &amp; DB the one into the other twise, together with the nūber cōposed of the squares of the numbers AD and DB is (by the 4. proposition) equall to the square of the number AB
                     
                        •
                      therfore the nū
                     ber composed of the squares of the numbers AD &amp; DB is greater then the halfe of the square nūber of AB, by the two squares of the number DC. And the square of the number AB is quadruple to the square of the number AC. Wherfore the number composed of the squares of the numbers AD and DB is greater then the double of the square of the number AC by two squares of the number DC. Wherfore the said number is double to the squares of the numbers AC and CD. If therefore a number be deuided &amp;c. which was required to be demonstrated.

               SVppose that a certayne right line AB be deuided into two equall partes in the point C. And vnto it let there be added an other right line directly, namely, BD.

Rayse vp (by the 11. of the first) from the point C vnto the right line ACD a perpendiculer lyne, and let the same be CE.

And (by the 31. of the first) by the point E, draw a line parallel vnto CD, and let the same be EF. And (by ye self same) by the point D draw a line parallel vnto CE and let the same be DF. And forasmuch as vpon these parallel lines CE &amp; DF lighteth a certain right line EF, therfore (by the 29. of the first) the angles CEF and EFD are equal vnto two right angles. VVherfore the angles FEB, and EFD are lesse then two right angles. But lines produced from angles lesse then two right angles (by the fifth peticion) at the length meete together. VVherfore the lines EB and FD beyng produced on that side that the line BD is, will at the length meete together. Produce them and let them meete together in the point G. And (by the first peticion) draw a line from A to G.Demonstration. And forasmuch as the line AC is equall vnto the line CE, the angle

also AEC is (by the 5. of the first) equall vnto the angle EAC. And the angle at ye point C is a right angle. VVherfore eche of these angles EAC &amp; and AEC is the halfe of a right angle. And by the same reason eche of these angles CEB, and EBC is the halfe of a right angle: VVherefore the angle AEB is a right angle. And forasmuch as the angle EBC is the halfe of a right angle, therfore (by the 15. of the first) the angle DBC is the half of a right angle. But ye angle BD
                     •
                   is a right angle (for it is equal vnto the angle DCE, for they are alternate angles) VVherfore the angle remaining DGB is the halfe of a right angle. VVherfore (by the 6 common sentence of the first) the angle DGB is equall to the angle DBG. VVherfore (by the 6. of the first) the side

BD is equall vnto the side GD. Agayne forasmuch as the angle EGF is the halfe of a right angle: and the angle at the pointe F is a right angle: for (by the 34. of the first) it is equall vnto the opposite angle ECD. VVherefore the angle remayning FEG is the halfe of a right angle. VVherfore the angle EGF is equall to the angle FEG. VVherfore (by the 6. of the first the side, FE is equall vnto the side FG. And forasmuch as EC is equall vnto CA, the square also which is made of EC is equall to the square which is made of CA. VVherefore the squares which are made of CE and CA are double to the square which is made of AC. But the square which is made of EA is (by the 47. of the first) equall vnto the squares which are made of EC and CA. VVherefore the square which is made of EA is double to the square which is made of AC
                     •
                   Againe forasmuch as GF is equall vnto EF, the square also which is made of GF is equall to the square which is made of FE. VVherfore the squares which are made of GF and EF are double to the square which is made of EF. But (by the 47. of the first) the square which is made of EG is equall to the squares which are made of GF and EF. VVherefore

the square which is made of EG is double to the square which is made of EF. But EF is equall vnto CD, wherfore ye square which is made of EG is double to the square which is made of CD. And it is proued the square which is made of EA is double to the square which is made of AC. VVherfore the squares which are made of AE and EG are double to the squares which are made of AC and CD. But (by the 47. of ths first) the square which is made of AG is equall to the squares which are made of AE and EG. VVherefore the square which is made of AG is double to the squares which are made of AC and CD. But vnto the square whiche is made of AG are equall the squares which are made of AD and DG. VVherfore the squares which are made of AD and DG are double to the squares which are made of AC and DC. But DG is equall vnto DB. VVherfore the squares which are made of AD and DB are double to the squares which are made of AC and DC. If therfore a right line be deuided into two equall partes, and vnto it be added an other lyne directly, the square which is made of the whole and that which is added, as of one line, together with the square which is made of the line which is added, these two squares (I say) are double to these squares, namely, to the square which is made of the halfe lyne, and to the square which is made of the other halfe lyne and that which is added, as of one lyne: which was required to be proued.
               
                  ¶ An other demonstration after Pelitarius.
                  
                     Suppose that the lyne AB be deuided into two equall partes in the poynte C. And vnto it let there be added an other right lyne directly, namely, BD. Then I say that the square of AD together with the square of BD is double to the squares of AC and CD.
                  Vpon the whole line AD describe a square ADEF. And vpon the halfe lyne AC describe the square ACGH. And produce the sides GH and CH till they cut the sides EF &amp; DF, wherby shalbe described the figure HLKF, which shalbe the square of the line CD: as (by the Corollary of the 4. of this boke, &amp; by the 34. Proposition of the 1.) it is manifest if we draw the diameter CD. For the lyne KF is equall to the line CD. And making also the lines HM and HN equall to either of these lynes AC and CB, drawe the lynes MO and NP cutting the one the other right angled wise in the point Q. Either of which lynes let cut the sides of the square AD:

EF in the pointes O and P. Now it nedeth not to proue that the figure HQ is the square of the lyne AC, seyng that it is the square of the line CB: as the figure QF is the square of the line BD: neither also needeth it to proue that the parallelograme HP is equall to either of the supplementes EH and HD: nor that the supplementes NO and QL are equall. For all this is manifest euē by the forme of the figure, for that all the angles about the diameter are half right angles, &amp; the sides are equall. Wherfore if we diligently marke of what partes the square HF which is the square of CD, is composed, we may thus reasō. Forasmuch as the whole square ED is composed of the two squares AH and HF and of the two supplementes EH and HD, we must proue that these supplementes with the square QF (which is the square of the line BD) are equall to the two squares AH and HF. For then shall we proue that these two squares AH &amp; HF taken twise are equall to the whole square DE together with the square of QF, which thing we tooke first in hand to proue. And thus do I proue it.
                  The Supplement EH is equall to the parallelograme HP. And the square AH together with the lesser supplemēt, NO, is equall to the other supplemēt HD (by the first common sentence so oftentymes repeted as is neede) wherfore the two supplementes EH and HD are equall to the square AH and to the Gnomon KHLPQO. If therfore vnto either of them be added the square QF: the two supplementes EH and HD together with the square of QF shal be equal to the square AH, &amp; to the Gnomon KHLPQO and to the square QF. But these three figures do make the two squares AH and HF. Wherfore the two supplementes EH and HD together with the square QF are equall to the two squares AH and HF, which was the second thing to be proued. Wherfore the two squares AH and HF beyng taken twise are equall to the whole square DE together with the square of QF. Wherfore the square DE together with the square QF is double to the squares AH and HF: which was required to be proued.
               
               
                  ¶ An example of this Proposition in numbers.
                  Take any euen number as 18: and take the halfe of it which is 9. and vnto 18. the whole, adde any other number as 3. which maketh 21. Take the square number of 21. (the whole number and the number added) which maketh 441. Take also the square of 3 (the number added) which is 9. which two squares added together make 450. Then adde the halfe number 9. to the number added 3. which maketh 12. And take the square of 9. the halfe number and of 12. the halfe number and the number added which squares are 81. and 144. and which two squares also added together make 225: vnto which summe the foresayd number 450. is double. As you see in the example.

                  The tenth Proposition.
                  
                     If an euen nomber be deuided into two equall nombers, and vnto it be added any other nomber: the square nomber of the whole nomber composed of the nōber and of that which is added, and the square nomber of the nōber added: these two square nōbers (I say) added together, are double to these square nombers, namely, to the square of the halfe nomber, and to the square of the nomber composed of the halfe nomber and of the nomber added.
                  
                  Suppose that the nomber AB being an euen nomber be deuided into two equall nombers AC and CB: and vnto it let be added an other nomber BD. Then I say, that the square nombers of the nombers AD and DB are double to the square nombers of AC and CD. For forasmuch as the nomber AD is deuided into the nombers AB and BD: therefore the square nombers of the nombers AD and DB are equall to the superficiall nomber produced of the multiplication of the nombers AD and DB the on into the other twise, together with the square of the nomber AB (by the 7 propositiō) But the square of the nomber AB is equal to fower squares of either of the nombers AC or CB (for AC is equall to the nomber CB): wherfore also the squares of the nombers AD and DB are equall to the superficiall nomber produced of the multiplication of the nombers AD and DB the one into the other twise, and to fower squares of the nomber BC or CA. And forasmuch as the superficiall nomber produced of the multiplication of the nombers AD and DB the one into the other, together with the square of the nomber CB, is equal to square of the nomber CD (by the 6 propositiō): therfore the nomber produced of the multiplication of the nomber
                        •
                      
                     AD and DB the one into the other twise together with two squares of the nomber CB, is equall to two squares of the nomber CD. Wherefore the squares of the nombers AD and DB are equall to

two squares of the nomber CD, and to two squares of the nomber AC. Wherefore they are double to the squares of the numbers AC and CD. And the square of the nomber AD is the square of the whole and of the nomber added. And the square of DB is the square of the nomber added: the square also of the nomber CD is the square of the nomber composed of the halfe and of the nomber added: If therefore an euen nomber be deuided. &amp;c. Which was required to be proued.

               The 1. Probleme. The 11. Proposition. To deuide a right line geuen in such sort, that the rectangle figure comprehended vnder the whole, and one of the partes, shall be equall vnto the square made of the other part.
               
                  SVppose that the right line geuen be AB. Now it is required to deuide the line AB in such sort, that the rectangle figure contayned vnder the whole and one of the partes, shall be equall vnto the square which is made of the other part. Describe (by the 46. of the first) vpon AB a square ABCD.

                  And (by the 10. of the

first) deuide the line AC into two equall partes in the point E, and draw a line from B to E. And (by the second petition) extend CA vnto the point F. And (by the 3. of the first) put the line EF equall vnto ye line BE. And (by the 46. of the first) vpon the line AF describe a square FGAH. And (by the 2. petition) extend GH vnto the point K. Then I say that the line AB is deuided in the point H in such sort, that the rectangle figure which is comprehēded vnder AB and BH is equall to the square which is made of AH.
                  
                     Demonstratiō
                     
                   
                  For forasmuch as the right line AC is deuided into two equall partes in the poynt E, and vnto it is added an other right line

AF. Therefore (by the 6. of the second) the rectangle figure contayned vnder CF and FA together with the square which is made of AE is equall to ye square which is made of EF. But EF is equall vnto EB. VVherefore the rectangle figure contayned vnder CF, and FA together with the square which is made of EA is equall to the square which is made of EB. But (by 47. of the first) vnto the square which is made of EB are equall the squares which are made of BA and AE. For the angle at the poynt A is a right angle. VVherefore that which is contayned vnder CF and FA, together with the square which is made of AE, is equall to the squares which are made of BA and AE. Take away the square which is made of AE which is common, to them both: VVherfore the rectangle figure remayning contayned vnder CF and FA is equall vnto the square which is made of AB. And that which is contained vnder the lines CF and FA is the figure FK. For the line FA is equall vnto the line FG. And the square which is made of AB is the figure AD. VVherefore the figure FK is equall vnto the figure AD. Take away the figure AK which is common, to them both. VVherefore the residue, namely, the figure FH is equall vnto the residue, namely, vnto the figure HD. But the figure HD is that, which is contayned vnder the lines AB and BH, for AB is equall vnto BD. And the figure FH is the square which is made of AH. VVherfore the rectangle figure comprehended vnder the lines AB and BH is equall to the square which is made of the line HA. VVherefore the right line geuen AB is deuided in the point H, in such sort that the rectangle figure contayned vnder AB and BH is equall to the square which is made of AH: which was required to be done.
               
               Thys proposition hath many singular vses. Vpon it dependeth the demonstration of that worthy Probleme the 10. Proposition of the 4. booke:
                     Many and singuler vses of this proposition.
                   which teacheth to describe an Isosceles triangle, in which eyther of the angles at the base shall be double to the angle at the toppe. Many and diuers vses of a line so deuided shall you finde in the 13. booke of Euclide.
               
               Thys is to be noted that thys Proposition can not as the former Propositions of thys second booke be reduced vnto numbers.
                     This proposition can not be reduced vnto numbers.
                   For the line EB hath vnto the line AE no proportion that can be named, and therefore it can not be expressed by numbers. For forasmuch as the square of EB is equall to the two squares of AB and AE (by the 47. of the first) and AE is the halfe of AB, therefore the line BE is irrationall. For euen as two equall square numbers ioyned together can not make a square number: so also two square numbers, of which the one is the square of the halfe roote of the other, can not make a square number. As by an example. Take the square of 8. which is 64. which doubled, that is, 128. maketh not a square number. So take the halfe of 8. which is 4. And the squares of 8. and 4. which are 64. and 16. added together likewyse make not a square number. For they make 80. who hath no roote square. Which thyng must of necessitie be if thys Probleme should haue place in numbers.
               But in Irrational numbers it is true, and may by thys example be declared.
               
                  Let 8. be so deuided, that that which is produced of the whole into one of his partes shall be equall to the square number produced of the other part. Multiply 8. into him selfe and there shall be produced 64. that is, the square ABCD. Deuide 8. into two equall partes, that is, into 4, and 4. as the line AE or EC. And multiply 4. into hym selfe, and there is produced 16, which adde vnto 64, and there shall be produced 80: whose roote is √
                     •

                   80. &amp; the lyne EA is 4. therfore the lyne AF is √
                     •
                   80—4. And so much shall the line AH be. And the line BH shall be 8—√
                     •
                   80—4, that is, 12—√
                     •
                   80. Now thē 12—√
                     •
                   80 multiplied into 8 shal be as much as √
                     •
                   80—4. multiplied into it selfe. For of either of them is produced 96—√ 5120.
            
            
               The 11. Theoreme. The 12. Proposition. In obtuseangle triangles, the square which is made of the side subtending the obtuse angle, is greater then the squares which are made of the sides which comprehend the obtuse angle, by the rectangle figure, which is comprehended twise vnder one of those sides which are about the obtuse angle, vpon which being produced falleth a perpendicular line, and that which is outwardly taken betwene the perpendicular line and the obtuse angle.
               SVppose that ABC be an obtuseangle triangle hauing the angle BAC obtuse, and from the point B (by the 12. of the first) draw a perpendicular line vnto CA produced and let the same be BD. Then I say that the square which is made of the side BC, is greater then the squares which are made of the sides BA and AC, by the rectangle figure comprehended vnder the lines CA and AD twise.Demonstration. For forasmuch as the right line CD is

by chaunce deuided in the poynt A, therefore (by the 4. of the second) the square which is made of CD is equall to the squares which are made of CA and AD, and vnto the rectangle figure contayned vnder CA and AD twise. Put the square which is made of DB common vnto them both. VVherefore the squares which are made of CD and DB are equall to the squares which are made of the lines CA, AD, and DB, and vnto the rectangle figure contayned vnder the lines CA and AD twise. But (by the 47. of the first) the square which is made of CB is equall to the squares which are made of the lines

CD and DB. For the angle at the point D is a right angle. And vnto the squares which are made of AD and DB (by the selfe same) is equall the square which is m

                  de of AB. VVherfore the square which is made of CB, is equall to the squares which are made of CA and AB and vnto the rectangle figure contayned vnder the lines CA and AD twise. VVherfore ye square which is made of CB, is greater then the squares which are made of CA and AB by the rectangle figure contayned vnder the lines CA and AD twise. In obtuseangle triangles therefore, the square which is made of the side subtending the obtuse angle, is greater then the squares which are made of the sides vvhich comprehend the obtuse angle, by the rectangle figure vvhich is comprehended twise vnder one of those sides which are about the obtuse angle, vpon which being produced falleth a perpendiculer lyne, and that which is outwardly taken betwene the perpendiculer lyne and the obtuse angle: which was required to be demonstrated.

               The 12. Theoreme. The 13. Proposition. In acuteangle triangles, the square which is made of the side that subtendeth the acute angle, is lesse then the squares which are made of the sides which comprehend the acute angle, by the rectangle figure which is cōprehended twise vnder one of those sides which are about the acuteangle, vpō which falleth a perpendiculer lyne, and that which is inwardly taken betwene the perpendiculer lyne and the acute angle.
               SVppose that ABC be an acuteangle triangle hauyng

the angle at ye point B acute, &amp; (by the 12. of the first) from the point A draw vnto the lyne BC a perpendiculer lyne AD. Then I say that the square which is made of the lyne AC is lesse then the squares which are made of the lyne CB and BA, by the rectangle figure conteyned vnder the lines CB and BD twise.Demonstratiō
                   For forasmuch as the right lyne BC is by chaunce deuided in the point D, therfore (by the 7. of the second) the squares

which are made of the lines CB and BD are equall to the rectangle figure contained vnder the lines CB and DB twise and vnto the square whiche is made of line CD. Put the square which is made of the line DA common vnto them both. VVherfore the squares which are made of the lines CB, BD, and DA, are equall vnto the rectangle figure contayned vnder

the lines CB and BD twise, and vnto the squares which are made of AD and DC. But to the squares whiche are made of the lines BD and DA is equal ye square which is made of the line AB: for th'angle at ye point D is a right angle. And vnto the squares whiche are made of the lines AD and DC is equall the square whiche is made of the line AC (by the 47. of ye first): wherfore the squares which are made of the lines CB and BA are equal to the square which is made of the line AC, and to that which is contained vnder the lines CB and BD twise. VVherfore the square which is made of the line AC beyng taken alone, is lesse then the squares which are made of the lines CB and BA by the rectangle figure, which is contained vnder the lines CB and BD twise. In rectangle triangles therfore the square which is made of the side that subtendeth the acute angle, is lesse then the squares which are made of the sides which comprehend the acute angle, by the rectangle figure which is comprehended twise vnder one of those sides which are about the acute angle, vpon which falleth a perpendicular line, and that which is inwardly taken betwene the perpendicular line and the acute angle: which was required to be proued.

                        A Corollary.
                     Hereby is easily gathered, that such a perpendicular line in rectangle triangles falleth of necessitie vpon the side of the triangle, that is, neyther within the triangle, nor without. But in obtuseangle triangles it falleth without, and in acuteangle triangles within. For the perpendicular line in obtuseangle triangles, and acuteangle triangles can not exactly agree with the side of the triangle: for then an obtuse &amp; an acuteangle should be equal to a right angle, contrary to the eleuenth and twelfth definitions of the first booke. Likewise in obtuseangle triangles it can not fall within, nor in acuteangle triangles without: for then the outward angle of a triangle should be lesse then the inward and opposite angle, which is contrary to the 16. of the first.
                  
                     
                        This Proposition true in all kindes of triangles.
                     And this is to be noted, that although properly an acuteangle triangle, by the definition therof geuē in the first booke, be that triangle, whose angles be all acute: yet forasmuch as there is no triangle, but that it hath an acute angle, this proposition is to be vnderstanded, &amp; is true generally in all kindes of triangles whatsoeuer, and may be declared by them, as you may easily proue.

                   And (by the 1. peticion) draw a line from G to H. And forasmuch as the right line FB is deuided into two equall partes in the point G, and into two vnequal partes in the point E, therfore (by the 5. of the second) the rectangle figure comprehended vnder the lines BE and EF together with the square which is made of the line EG, is equall to the square which is made of the line GF. But the line GF is equall vnto the line GH. VVherfore the rectangle figure comprehended vnder the lines BE and EF together with the square which is made of the line GE is equall to square which is made of the line GH. But vnto the square which is made of the line GH are equall the squares whiche are made of the lines HE and GE (by the 47. of the first.) VVherfore yt which is contained vnder ye lines BE and EF together with ye square which is made of GE is equall to ye squares which are made of HE and GE. Take away the square of the line EG common to them both. VVherfore the rectangle figure contained vnder the lines BE &amp; EF is equall to the square which is made of the line EH. But that whiche is contained vnder the lines BE and EF is the parallelogramme BD, for the line EF is equall vnto the line ED. VVherfore the parallelogramme BD is equall to ye square whiche is made of the line HE. But the parallelograme BD is equall vnto the rectiline figure A. VVherfore ye rectiline figure A is equall to the square which is made of ye line HE. VVherfore vnto the rectiline figure geuen A, is made an equall square described of the line EH: which was required to be done.

                  The argument of this booke.
               THis third booke of Euclide entreateth of the most perfect figure, which is a circle. Wherefore it is much more to be estemed then the two bookes goyng before, in which he did set forth the most simple proprieties of rightlined figures. For sciences take their dignities of the worthynes of the matter that they entreat of. But of al figures the circle is of most absolute perfection, whose proprieties and passions are here set forth, and most certainely demō
               strated. Here also is entreated of right lines subtended to arkes in circles: also of angles set both at the circumference and at the centre of a circle, and of the varietie and differences of them. Wherfore the readyng of this booke, is very profitable to the attayning to the knowledge of chordes and arkes. It teacheth moreouer which are circles contingēt, and which are cutting the one the other: and also that the angle of contingence is the least of all acute rightlined angles: and that the diameter in a circle is the longest line that can be drawen in a circle. Farther in it may we learne how, three pointes beyng geuen how soeuer (so that they be not set in a right line), may be drawen a circle passing by them all three. Agayne, how in a solide body, as in a Sphere, Cube, or such lyke, may be found the two opposite pointes. Whiche is a thyng very necessary and commodious: chiefly for those that shall make instrumentes seruyng to Astronomy, and other artes.
            
               Definitions. 
                     The first definition.
                  Equall circles are such, whose diameters are equall, or whose lynes drawen from the centres are equall.
               The circles A and B are equal, if theyr diameters, namely, EF and CD be equall: or if their semidiameters, whiche are lynes drawen from the center to the circumference
                     •
                   namely AF and BD be equall.
               
                  
                     Why circles take their equality of their diameters or semidiameters.
                  The reason why circles

take theyr equalitie, of the equalitie of their diameters or semidiameters is, for that a circle is described by one reuolution or turnyng about of the semidiameter, hauing one of his endes fixed. As if you imagine the lyne AE to haue his one point namely A fastened, and the other end namely E to moue round till

it come to the place where it begā to moue, it shal fully describ
                     •
                   the whole circle. Wherefore if the semidiameters bee equall, the circles of necessitye must also be equall: and also the diameters.
               By thys also is knowen the definition of vnequall circles.
                     Definition of vnequall circles.
                  
               
               
                  Circles whose diameters or semidiameters are vnequall, are also vnequall. And that circl
                        •
                      which hath the greater diameter or semidiameter, is the greater circle: and that circle which hath the lesse diameter or semidiameter, is the lesse circle.
               
               As the circle LM is greater

then the circle IK, for that the diameter LM is greater then the diameter IK: or for that the semidiameter GL is greater then the semidiameter HI.
            
            
               A right line is sayd to touch a circle,
                     Second definition.
                   which touching the circle and being produced cutteth it not.
               As the right lyne EF drawen from the point E, and passyng by a point of the circle, namely, by the point G to the point F only

toucheth the circle GH, and cutteth it not, nor entreth within it. For a right line entryng within a circle, cutteth and deuideth the circle. As the right lyne KL deuideth and cutteth the circle KLM, and entreth within it: and therfore toucheth it in two places. But a right lyne touchyng a circle, which is commonly called a cōtingent lyne,
                     A contigent line.
                   toucheth the circle onely in one point.
            
            
               Circles are sayd to touch the one the other,

               As the two circles AB and BC touch the

one the other. For theyr circumferences touch together in the poynt B. But neither of them cutteth or deuideth, the other. Neither doth any part of the one enter within the other.

                     Fourth definition.
                  Right lines in a circle are sayd to be equally distant from the centre, when perpendicular lines drawen from the centre vnto those lines are equall. And that line is sayd to be more distant, vpon whom falleth the greater perpendicular line.
               As in the circle ABCD whose centre is E, the two lynes

                  AB and CD haue equall distance from the centre E: bycause that the lyne EF drawen from the centre E perpendicularly vpon the lyne AB, and the lyne EG drawen likewise perpendilarly from the centre E vpon the lyne CD are equall the one to the other. But in the circle HKLM whose centre is N the lyne HK hath greater distance from the centre N then hath the lyne LM: for that the lyne ON drawen from the centre N perpendicularly vppon the lyne HK is greater then the lyne NP which is drawen frō the centre N perpendicularly vpon the lyne LM.

                     Fift definition.
                  A section or segment of a circle, is a figure cōprehended vnder a right line and a portion of the circumference of a circle.
               
                  As the figure ABC is a section of a circle

bycause it is comprehended vnder the right lyne AC and the circumference of a circle ABC. Likewise the figure DEF is a section of a circle, for that it is comprehended vnder the right lyne DF, and the circūference DEF. And the figure ABC for that it cōtaineth within it the centre of the circle is called the greater section of a circle: and the figure DEF is the lesse section of a circle, bycause it is wholy without the centre of the circle as it was noted in the 16. Definition of the first booke.
            
            
               An angle of a section or segment, is that angle which is contayned vnder a right line and the circūference of the circle.
                     Sixt definition.
                  
               
               As the angle ABC in the section ABC is an angle of a section,

bycause it is contained of the circumference BAC and the right lyne BC. Likewise the angle CBD is an angle of the section BDC bycause it is contayned vnder the circumference BDC, and the right lyne BC. And these angles are commonly called mixte angles,
                     Mixt angles.
                   bycause they are contayned vnder a right lyne and a crooked. And these portions of circumferences are commonly called arkes,
                     Arkes.
                   and the right lynes are called chordes,
                     Chordes.
                   or right lynes subtended. And the greater section hath euer the greater angle, and the lesse section the lesse angle.
            
            
               An angle is sayd to be in a section,
                     Seuenth definition.
                   whē in the circumference is taken any poynt, and from that poynt are drawen right lines to the endes of the right line which is the base of the segment, the angle which is contayned vnder the right lines drawen from the poynt, is (I say) sayd to be an angle in a section.
               As the angle ABC is an angle is the section ABC, bycause

from the poynt B beyng a poynt in the circumference ABC are drawen two right lynes BC and BA to the endes of the lyne AC which is the base of the section ABC. Likewise the angle ADC is an angle in the section ADC, bycause from the poynt D beyng in the circūference ADC are drawen two right lynes, namely, DC &amp; DA to the endes of the right line AC which is also the base to the sayd section ADC. So you see, it is not all one to say,
                     Difference of an angle of a Section, and of an angle in a Section.
                   an angle of a section, and an angle in a section. An angle of a section cō
                  sisteth of the touch of a right lyne and a crooked. And an angle in a section is placed on the circumference, and is contayned of two right lynes. Also the greater section hath in it the lesse angle, and the lesse section hath in it the greater angle.
            
            
               But when the right lines which comprehend the angle do receaue any circumference of a circle,
                     Eight definition.
                   then that angle is sayd to be correspondent, and to pertaine to that circumference.
               
                  As the right lynes BA and BC which containe the angle AB

C, and receaue the circumference ADC therfore the angle ABC is sayd to subtend and to pertaine to the circūference ADC. And if the right lynes whiche cause the angle, concurre in the centre of a circle: then the angle is sayd to be in the centre of a circle. As the angle EFD is sayd to be in the centre of a circle, for that it is comprehended of two right lynes FE and FD: whiche concurre and touch in the centre F. And this angle likewise subtendeth the circumference EGD: whiche circumference also, is the measure of the greatnes of the angle EFD.
            
            
               A Sector of a circle is (an angle being set at the centre of a circle) a figure contayned vnder the right lines which make that angle,
                     Ninth definition.
                   and the part of the circumference receaued of them.
               As the figure ABC is a sector of a circle, for that it hath an angle

at the centre, namely the angle BAC, &amp; is cōtained of the two right lynes AB and AC (whiche contayne that angle and the circumference receaued by them.
            
            
               
                  
                     Tenth definition.
                  Like segmentes or sections of a circle are those, which haue equall angles, or in whom are equall angles.
               
                  
                     Two definitions.
                  Here are set two definitions of like sections of

a circle. The one pertaineth to the angles whiche are set in the centre of the circle and receaue the circumferēce of the sayd sections:
                     First.
                   the other pertaineth to the angle in the section, whiche as before was sayd is euer in the circumference. As if the angle BAC, beyng in the centre A and receaued of the circumference BLC be equall to the angle FEG beyng also in the centre E and receaued of the circumference FKG, then are the two sections BCL and FGK lyke by the first definition. By the same definition also are the other two sections like, namely BCD, and FGH, for that the angle BAC is equall to the angle FEG.
               
                  
                     Second.
                  Also by the second definition if B

AC beyng an angle placed in the circumference of the section BCA be e-angle EDF beyng an angle in the section EFD placed in the circumference, there are the two sections BCA, and EFD lyke the one to the other. Likewise also if the angle BGC beyng in the section BCG be equall to the angle EHF beyng in the sectiō EHF the two sections BCG and EFH are lyke. And so is it of angles beyng equall in any poynt of the circumference.
               
                  Euclide defineth not equall Sections:
                     Why Euclide defineth not equall Sections.
                   for they may infinite wayes be described. For there may vppon vnequall right lynes be set equall Sections (but yet in vnequall circles) For from any circle beyng the greater, may be cut of a portion equall to a portion of an other circle beyng the lesse. But when the Sections are equall, and are set vpon equall right lynes, theyr circumferences also shalbe equall. And right lynes beyng deuided into two equall partes, perpendicular lynes drawen from the poyntes of the diuision to the circumferēces

shalbe equall. As if the two sections ABC and DEF, beyng set vppon equall ryght lynes AC &amp; DF, be equall: then if ech of the two lynes AC &amp; DF be deuided into two equall partes in the poyntes G and H, &amp; from the sayd poyntes be drawen to the circumferences two perpendicular lynes BG and EH, the sayd perpendicular lynes shalbe equall.
            
            
               The 1. Probleme. The 1. Proposition. To finde out the centre of a circle geuen.
               SVppose that there be a circle geuen ABC. It is required to finde out the centre of the circle ABC. Draw in it a right line at all aduentures, and let the same be AB.Constuction. And (by the 10. of the first) deuide the line AB into two equall partes in the poynt D. And (by the 11. of the same) frō the poynt D raise vp vnto AB a perpendicular line DC, &amp; (by the second petition) extend DC vnto ye point E. And (by the 10. of the first) deuide

the line CE into two equall partes in the poynt F. Then I say that the point F is the centre of the circle ABC.Demonstration leading to an impossibilitie. For if it be not, let some other point, namely G, be the centre. And (by the first petition) draw these right lines GA, GD, and GB. And for asmuch as AD is equall vnto DB, and DG is common vnto thē both, therefore these two lines AD and DG are equall to these two lines GD and DB, the one to the other, and (by the 15. definition of the first) the base GA is equall to the base GB. For they are both drawen from the centre G to the circumference: therefore (by the 8. of the first) the angle ADG is equall to the angle BDG. But when a right line standing vpon a right line maketh the angles on eche side equall the one to the other, eyther of those angles (by the 10. definition of the first) is a right angle. VVherefore the angle BDG

is a right angle: but ye angle FDB is also a right angle by construction. VVherfore (by the 4. petition) the angle FDB is equall to the angle BDG, the greater to the lesse, which is impossible. VVherefore the poynt G is not the centre of the circle ABC. In like wise may we proue that no other poynt besides F is the centre of the circle ABC. VVherefore the poynt F is the centre of the circle ABC: which was required to be done.
               
                  Correlary.
                  
                     Correlary. Hereby it is manifest, that if in a circle a right line do deuide a right line into two equall partes, and make right angles on eche side: in that right line which deuideth the other line into two equall partes is the centre of the circle.
               
            
            
               The 1. Theoreme. The 2. Proposition. If in the circūference of a circle be takē two poyntes at all aduentures: a right line drawen from the one poynt to the other shall fall within the circle.
               SVppose that there be a circle ABC. And in the circumference therof, let there be takē at all aduentures these two poyntes A &amp; B. Then I say that a right line drawen from A to B shall fall within the circle ABC.Demonstratiō leading to an impossibilitie. For if it do not, let it fall without the circle, as the line AEB doth, which if it be possible imagine to be a right line. And (by the Proposition going before) take the centre of the circle, and let the same be D. And (by the first petition) draw lines from D to A, and from D to B. And extend DF to E. And for asmuch as (by the 15. definition of ye first)

DA is equall vnto DB. Therefore the angle DAE is equall to the angle DBE. And for asmuch as one of the sides of the triangle DAE, namely the side AEB is produced, therefore (by the 16. of the first) the angle DEB, is greater then the angle DAE. But the angle DAE is equall vnto the angle DBE. VVherfore the angle DEB is greater then the angle DBE. But (by the 18. of the first) vnto the greater angle is subtended the greater side. VVherefore the side DB is greater then the side DE. But (by the 15. definition of the first) the line DB is

equall vnto the line DF. VVherfore the line DF is greater then the line DE, namely, the lesse greater then the greater: which is impossible. VVherfore a right line drawen from A to B falleth not without the circle. In like sort also may we proue that it falleth not in the circumference. VVherefore it falleth within the circle. If therefore in the circumference of a circle be taken two poyntes at all aduentures: a right line drawen from the one poynt to the other shall fall within the circle: which was required to be proued.
            
            
               The 2. Theoreme. The 3. Proposition. If in a circle a right line passing by the centre do deuide an other right line not passing by the cētre into two equall partes: it shall deuide it by right angles. And if it deuide the line by right angles, it shall also deuide the same line into two equall partes.
               SVppose that there be a circle ABC,The first para of this Proposition. and let there be in it drawen a right line passing by the centre, and let the same be CD, deuiding an other right line AB not passing by ye centre into two equall partes in the poynt F. Then I say that the angles at the poynt of the deuision are right angles.Construction. Take (by ye first of the third)

the centre of the circle ABC, and let the same be E. And (by the first petition) drawe lines from E to A &amp; from E to B.Demonstration. And for asmuch as the line AF is equall vnto the line FB, and the line FE is common to them both, therfore these two lines EF and FA are equall vnto these two lines EF &amp; FB. And the base EA is equall vnto the base EB (by the 15. definition of the first). VVherefore (by the 8. of the first) the angle AFE is equall to the angle BFE. But when a right line standing vpon a right line doth make the angles on eche side equall the one to the other, eyther of those angles is (by the 10. definition of the first) a right angle. VVherfore either of these angles AFE, &amp; BFE is a right angle. VVherefore the line CD passing by the centre, and deuiding the line AB not passing by the centre into two equall partes, maketh at the point of the deuision right angles.
               But now suppose that the line CD do deuide the line AB in such sort that it maketh right angles.The second part conuerst of the first. Then I say that it deuideth it into two equall partes, that is, yt the line AF is equall vnto the line FB.Demonstration. For the same order of construction remayning, for asmuch as the line EA is equall vnto the line EB (by the 15. definition

of the first). Therefore the angle EAF is equall vnto the angle EBF (by the 5. of the first). And the right angle AFE is (by the 4. petition) equall to the right angle BFE. VVherefore there are two triangles EAF, &amp; EBF hauing two angles equall to two angles, &amp; one side equall to one side, namely the side EF which is common to them both, and subtendeth one of the equall angles, wherefore (by the 26. of the first) the sides remayning of the one, are equall vnto the sides remayning of the other. VVherefore the line AF is equall vnto the line FB. If therefore in a circle a right line passing by the centre do deuide an other right line not passing by the centre into two equall partes, it shall deuide it by right angles. And if it deuide the line by right angles it shall also deuide the same line into two equall partes: which was required to be demonstrated.
            
            
               The 3. Theoreme. The 4. Proposition. If in a circle two right lines not passing by the centre, deuide the one the other: they shall not deuide eche one the other into two equall partes.
               
                  SVppose that there be a circle ABCD, and let there be in it drawen two right lines not passing by the centre and deuiding the one the other, and let the same be AC and BD, which let deuide the one the other in the poynt E. Then I say that they deuide not eche

the one the other into two equall partes.
                  
                     Demonstration leading to an impossibilitie.
                   
                  For if it be possible let them deuide eche the one the other into two equall partes, so that let AE be equall vnto EC, &amp; BE vnto ED. And take the centre of the circle ABCD, which let be F. And (by the first petition) draw a line from F to E. Now for asmuch as a certaine right line FE passing by the centre deuideth an other line AC not passing by the centre into two equall partes, it maketh where the deuision is right angles (by the 3. of the third). VVherfore the angle FEA is a right angle. Againe for asmuch as the right line FE, passing by the centre, deuideth the right line BD not passing by the centre into two equall partes, therefore (by the same) it maketh where ye deuision is right angles. VVherfore the angle FEB is a right angle. And it is proued that the angle FEA is a right angle. VVherfore (by the 4. petition) the angle FEA is equall vnto the angle FEB, namely the lesse angle vnto the greater: which is impossible. VVherefore the right lines AC and BD deuide not eche one the other into two equall partes. If therfore in a circle two right lines not passing by the centre, deuide the one the other, they

shall not deuide eche one the other into two equall partes: which was required to be demonstrated.
               
               In this Proposition are two cases.
                     Two cases in this Proposition.
                   For the lines cutting the one the other, do eyther, neyther of them passe by the centre, or the one of them doth passe by the centre, &amp; the other not. The first is declared by the author. The second is thus proued.
               Suppose that in the circle ABCD the line

                  BD passing by the centre doe cut the line AC not passing by the centre.
                     Construction for the second case.
                   Then I say that the lines AC and BD do not deuide the one the other into two equall partes. For by the former Proposition the line BD passing by the centre and deuiding the line AC into two equall partes,
                     Demonstration.
                   it shall also deuide it perpendicularly. And for asmuch as the line AC deuideth the line BD into two equall partes &amp; right angled wise: therfore by the Correllary of the first of thys booke, the line AC passeth by the centre of the circle: which is cōtrary to the supposition. Wherfore the lines AC and BD do not deuide the one the other into two equall partes: which was required to be proued.

               SVppose that these two circles

ABC,Construction. and CBG do cut the one the other in the poyntes C and B. Then I say that they haue not one &amp; the same centre.Demonstratiō leading to an impossibilitie. For if it be possible let E be centre to them both. And (by the first petition) draw a line from E to C. And draw an other right line EFG at all aduentures. And for asmuch as the poynt E is the centre of the circle ABC, therefore (by the 15. definition of the first) the line EC is equall vnto the line EF. Agayne for asmuch as the poynt E is the centre of the circle CBG, therefore (by the same definition) the line EC is equall vnto the line EG. And it is proued that the line EC is equall vnto the line EF: wherefore the line EF also is equall vnto the line EG, namely the lesse vnto the greater: which is impossible. VVherfore the poynt E is not the centre of both the circles ABC, &amp; CBG. I

                   like sort also may we proue that no other poynt is the centre of both the sayd

                     on leading to an impossibilitie. Then I say that they haue not one and the same centre. For if it be possible let the point F be centre vnto them both. And (by the first petition) draw a line from F to C: and

drawe the line FEB at all aduentures. And for asmuch as the poynt F is the centre of the circle ABC, therfore (by the 15. definition of the first) the line FC is equall vnto the line FB. Agayne forasmuch as the poynt F is the centre of ye circle CDE, therefore (by the same definition) the line FC is equall vnto the line FE. And it is proued, that the line FC is equall vnto the line FB, wherefore the line FE also is equall vnto the line FB, namely the lesse vnto ye greater: which is impossible. VVherfore the poynt F is not the centre of both the circles ABC and CDE. In like sort also may we proue that no other poynt is the centre of both the sayd circles. If therefore two circles touch the one the other: they haue not one and the same centre: which was required to be demonstrated.

                      in thys Proposition.
                  In thys Proposition are two cases: for the circles

touchyng the one the other, may touch eyther within or without. If they touch the one the other within, then is it by the former demonstration manifest, that they haue not both one and the selfe same centre. It is also manifest if they touch the one the other without: for that euery centre is in the middest of hys circle.
               
            
            
               The 6. Theoreme. The 7. Proposition. If in the diameter of a circle be taken any poynt, which is not

the centre of the circle, and from that poynt be drawen vnto the circumference certaine right lines: the greatest of those lines shall be that line wherein is the centre, and the lest shall be the residue of the same line. And of all the other lines, that which is nigher to the line which passeth by the centre is greater then that which is more distant. And from that point can fall within the circle on ech side of the least line onely two equall right lines.
               SVppose that there be a circle ABCD: and let the diameter thereof be AD. And take in it any poynt besides the centre of the circle, and let the same be F.Construction. And let the centre of the circle (by the 1. of ye third) be the poynt E. And from the poynt F let there be drawen vnto the circumference ABCD these right lines FD, FC, and FG. Then I say that the line FA is the greatest: and the line

FD is the lest. And of the other lines, the line FB is greater then the line FC, and the line FC is greater then the line FG.The first part of this Proposition. Drawe (by the first petition) these right lines BE, CE, and GE. And for asmuch as (by the 20. of the first) in euery triangle two sides are greater then the third,Demonstration. therefore ye lines EB and EF are greater then the residue, namely then the line FB. But the line AE is equall vnto the line BE (by the 15. definition of the first). VVherefore the lines BE and EF are equall vnto the line AF. VVherefore the line AF is greater then then the line BF. Agayne for asmuch as the line BE is equall vnto CE (by the 15. definition of the first) and the line FE is common vnto them both, therefore these two lines BE and EF are equall vnto these two CE and EF. But the angle BEF is greater then the angle CEF. VVherefore (by the 24. of the first) the base BF is greater then the base CF: and by the same reason the line CF is greater then the line FG. Agayne for asmuch as the lines GF and FE are greater then the line EG (by the 20. of the first).Second part. But (by the 15. definition of the first) the line EG is equall vnto the line ED: VVherefore the lines GF and FE are greater then the line ED, take away EF, which is cōmon to thē both, wherfore ye residue GF is greater then the residue FD. VVherefore the line FA is the greatest, and the line FD is the lest, and the line FB is greater then the line FC, and the line FC

is greater then the line FG.Third part. Now also I say that from the poynt F there can be drawen onely two equall right lines into the circle ABCD on eche side of the least line, namely FD. For (by the 23. of the first) vpon the right line geuen EF and to the poynt in it, namely E, make vnto the angle GEF an equall angle FEH: and (by the first petition) draw a line from F to H. Now for asmuch as (by the 15. definition of the first) the line EG is equall vnto the line EH, and the line EF is common vnto them both, therefore these two lines GE and EF are equall vnto these two lines HE and EF, and (by construction) the angle GEF is equall vnto the angle HEF. VVherefore (by the 4. of ye first) the base FG is equall vnto the base FH.This demon

                     rated by an argument leading to an impossibilie. I say moreouer that from the poynt F can be drawen into the circle no other right line equall vnto the line FG. For if it possible let the line
                     •
                   FK be equall vnto the line FG. And for asmuch as FK is equall vnto FG. But the line FH is equall vnto the line FG, therefore the line FK is equall vnto the line FH. VVherfore the line which is nigher to the line which passeth by the centre is equall to that which is farther of, which we haue before proued to be impossible.
               
                  An other demonstration of the latter part of the Proposition leading also to an impossibilitie.Or els it may thus be demonstrated.

Draw (by the first petition) a line from E to K: and for asmuch as (by ye 
                  15. definitiō of ye first) ye line GE is equall vnto ye line EK, and the line FE is common to them both, and the base GF is equall vnto the base FK, therefore (by the 8. of the first) the angle GEF is equall to the angle KEF. But the angle GEF is equall to the angle HEF. VVherefore (by the first common sentence) the angle HEF is equall to the angle KEF the lesse vnto the greater: which is impossible. VVherefore from the poynt F there can be drawen into the circle no other right line equall vnto the line GF. VVherefore but one onely. If therefore in the diameter of a circle be taken any poynt, which is not the centre of the circle, and from that poynt be drawen vnto the circumference certaine right lines: the greatest of those right lines shall be that wherein is the centre: and the least shall be the residue. And of all the other lines, that which is nigher to the line which passeth by the centre is greater then that which is more distant. And from that poynt can fall within the circle on ech side of the least line onely two equall right lines: which was required to be proued.

                        A Corollary.
                     Hereby it is manifest, that two right lines being drawen frō any one poynt of the diameter, the one of one side, and the other of the other side, if with the diameter they make equall angles, the sayd two right lines are equall. As in thys place are the two lines FG and FH.
               
            
            
               
               The 7. Theoreme. The 8. Proposition. If without a circle be taken any poynt, and from that poynt be drawen into the circle vnto the circumference certayne right lines, of which let one be drawen by the centre and let the rest be drawen at all aduentures: the greatest of those lines which fall in the concauitie or hollownes of the circumference of the circle, is that which passeth by the centre: and of all the other lines that line which is nigher to the line which passeth by the centre is greater then that which is more distant. But of those right lines which end in the conuexe part of the circumference, that is the least which is drawen from the poynt to the diameter: and of the other lines that which is nigher to the least is alwaies lesse then that which is more distant. And from that poynt can be drawen vnto the circumference on ech side of the least onely two equall right lines.
               SVppose yt the circle geuen be ABC,

&amp; without ye circle ABC, take the point D: and frō ye same point draw certain right lines into ye circle vnto the circumference, &amp; let thē be DA, DE, DF, &amp; DC: &amp; let ye line DA passe by ye centre. Then I say, of ye right lines which fall in the concauitie of ye circumference AEFC, yt is, within ye circle, ye greatest is yt which passeth by ye centre, that is, DA. And of those lines which fall vpon ye conuex part of ye circumference, ye lest is yt which is drawen frō ye point D vnto ye end of ye diameter AG. And of the right lines falling wtin the circumferēce, the line DE is greater then ye line DF, &amp; the line DF is greater then ye line DC. And of the right lines which end in ye conuex part of the circumference, yt is, without ye circle, that (which is nigher vnto DG ye lest, is alwayes lesse then yt which is more distāt, that is, the line DK is lesse then the line DL, and the line DL is lesse then the line DH. Take (by the first of the third) the centre of the circle ABC,Construction. and let the

same be M:The first part of this Proposition. and (by the first petition) drawe these right lines ME, MF, MC, MH, ML, and MK. And for asmuch as (by the 15. definition of the first) the line AM is equall vnto the line EM, put the line MD common to them both. VVherefore the line AD is equall vnto the lines EM and MD. But the lines EM and MD are (by the 20. of the first) greater then the line ED. VVherefore the line AD also is greater then the line ED. Agayne for asmuch as (by the 15. definition of the first) the line ME is equall vnto the line MF, put the line MD common to them both: VVherefore the lines EM and MD are equall to the lines FM and MD, and the angle EMD is greater then the angle FMD: VVherefore (by the 19. of the first) the base ED is greater then the base FD. In like sort also may we proue that the line FD is greater then the line CD. VVherefore the line DA is the greatest, and the line DE is greater then the line DF, and the line DF is greater then the line DC.
               
                  Second part.And for asmuch as (by the 20. of the

first) 
                     ••
                  e lines MK and KD are greater then the line MD. But (by the 15. definition of the first) the line MG is equall vnto the line MK. VVherefore the residue KD is greater then ye residue GD. VVherfore the line GD is lesse then the line KD. And for asmuch as from the endes of one of the sides of the triangle MLD, namely, MD are drawen two right lines MK and KD meeting within the triangle, therfore (by the 21. of the first) the lines MK and KD are lesse then the lines ML &amp; LD, of which the line MK is equall vnto the line ML. VVherefore the residue DK is lesse then the residue DL. In like sort also may we proue that the line DL is lesse then the line DH. VVherefore the line DG is the lest, and the line DK is lesse then the line DL, and the line DL is lesse then the line DH.
               
                  Third part.Now also I say that from the poynt D can be drawen vnto the circumference on eche side of DG the least onely two equall right lines. Vpon the right line MD, and vnto the poynt in it M make (by the 23. of the first) vnto the angle KMD an equall angle DMB. And (by the first petition) drawe a line from D to B. And for asmuch as (by the 15. definition of the first) the line MB is equall vnto the line MK put the line MD common to the both, wherfore these two lines MK and MD are equall to these two lines BM and MD the one to the other, and the angle KMD is (by the 23. of the first) equall to the angle BMD: VVhere

that side that the line DB is,This is demō
                     strated by an argument leading to an absurdity. can not be drawen vnto the circumference any other line besides DB equall vnto the right line DK. For if it be possible let there be drawen an other line besides DB, and let the same be DN. And for asmuch as the line DK is equall vnto the line DN. But vnto the line DK is equall the line DB. Therfore (by the first common sentence) the line DB is equall vnto the line DN. VVherefore that which is nigher vnto DG the least, is equall to ye which is more distant

                   VVhich we haue before proued to be impossible.
               Or it may thus be demonstrated.An other demonstration of the latter part, leading also to an impossibility. Draw (by the first petition) a line from M to N. And for asmuch as (by the 15. definition of the first) the line KM is equall vnto the line MN, and the line MD is common to them both. And the base KD is equall to the base DN (by supposition) therefore (by the 8. of the first) the angle KMD is equall to the angle DMN. But the angle KMD is equall to the angle BMD. Wherfore the angle BMD is equall to the angle NMD, the lesse vnto the greater: which is impossible. Wherefore from the poynt D can not be drawen vnto the circumference ABC on eche side of DG the lest, more then two equall right lines. If therefore without a circle be taken any poynt and from that poynt be drawen into the circle vnto the circumference certaine right lines, of which let one be drawen by the centre, and let the rest be drawen at all adventures: the greatest of those right lines which fall in ye concauitie or hollownes of the circumference of the circle is that which passeth by the centre. And of all the other lines, that line which is nigher to the line which passeth by the centre, is greater then that which is more distant. But of those right lines which end in the conuexe part of the circumference, that line is the lest which is drawen from the poynt to the dimetient: and of the other lines that which is nigher to the least is alwayes lesse then that which is more distant. And from that poynt can be drawen vnto the circumference on ech side of the lest only two equall right lines: which was required to be proued.

                  Hereby it is manifest,
                        A Corollary.
                      that the right lines, which being drawen from the poynt

geuen without the circle, and fall within the circle, are equally distant from the least, or from the greatest (which is drawen by the centre) are equall the one to the other: but contrarywyse if they be vnequally distant, whether they light vpon the concaue or conuexe circumference of the circle, they are vnequall.
               
            
            
               The 8. Theoreme. The 9. Proposition. If within a circle be taken a poynt, and from that poynt be drawen vnto the circumference moe then two equall right lines, the poynt taken is the centre of the circle.
               SVppose that the circle be ABC, and within it let there be taken the poynt D. And from D let there be drawen vnto the circumference ABC moe then two equall right lines,Construction. that is, DA, DB, and DC. Then I say that the poynt D is the centre of the circle ABC. Draw (by the first petition) these right lines

AB and BC:Demonstration. and (by the 10. of the first) deuide thē into two equall partes in the poyntes E and F: namely, the line AB in the poynt E, and the line BC in the poynt F. And draw ye lines ED and FD, and (by the second petition) extend the lines ED and FD on eche side to the poyntes K, G, and H, L. And for asmuch as the line AE is equall vnto the line EB, and the line ED is common to them both, therefore these two sides AE and ED are equall vnto these two sides BE, and ED: and (by supposition) the base DA is equall to the base DB. Wherfore (by the 8. of the first) the angle AED is equall to the angle BED. Wherfore eyther of these angles AED and BED is a right angle. Wherefore the line GK deuideth ye line AB into two equall partes and maketh right angles. And for asmuch as, if in a circle a right line deuide an other right line into two equall partes in such sort that it maketh also right angles, in ye line that deuideth is the centre of the circle (by the Correllary of the first of the third). Therfore (by the same Correllary) in the line GK is the centre of the circle ABC. And (by the same reason) may we proue that in ye line HL is the centre of the circle ABC, and the right lines GK, and HL haue no other poynt common to them both besides the poynt D. Wherefore the poynt D is the centre of the circle ABC. If therefore within a circle be taken a poynt, and from that point be drawen vnto the circumference more then two equall right lines, the poynt taken is the centre of the circle: which was required to be proued.
               
                  
                  ¶ An other demonstration.
                  Let there be taken within the circle ABC the poynt D.An other demonstration of the same leading also to an impossibilitie. And from the poynt D let there be drawen vnto the circumference more then two equall right lines, namely, DA, DB, and DC. Then I say that the poynt D is the centre of the circle. For if not, then if it be possible

let the point E be the centre: and draw a line from D to E, and extend DE to the poyntes F and G. Wherefore the line FG is the diameter of the circle ABC. And for asmuch as in FG the diameter of the circle ABC is taken a poynt, namely D, which is not the centre of that circle, therefore (by the 7. of the third) the line DG is ye greatest, and the line DC is greater then the line DB, and the line DB is greate
                        •
                      then the line DA. But the lines DC, DB, DA, are also equall (by supposition): which is impossible. Wherefore the poynt E is not the centre of the circle ABC. And in like sort may we proue that no other poynt besides D. Wherefore the poynt D is the centre of the circle ABC: which was required to be proued.

And (by the 11. of the first) from the poynt K raise vp vnto ye line BH a perpendicular line KC, and likewise from the poynt L raise vp vnto ye line BG a perpendicular line LM, and extend the line CK to the poynt A, and LNM to the poyntes X and E. And for asmuch as in the circle ABC, the right line AC deuideth the right line BH into two equall partes and maketh right angles, therfore (by the 3. of the third)

in the line AC is the centre of the circle ABC. Agayne, for asmuch as in the selfe same circle ABC the right line NX, that is, the line ME deuideth the right line BG into two equall partes and maketh right angles, therefore (by the third of the third) in the line NX is the centre of the circle ABC. And it is proued that it is also in the line

AC. And these two right lines AC and NX meete together in no other poynt besides O. Wherefore the poynt O is the centre of the circle ABC. And in like sort may we proue that the poynt O is the centre of the circle DEF. Wherefore the two circles ABC and DEF deuiding the one the other haue one and the same centre: which (by the 5. of the third) is impossible. A circle therfore cutteth not a circle in moe poyntes then two: which was required to be proued.

And (by the first of the third) take the centre of the circle ABC and let the same be the poynt K. And draw these right lines KB, KG, and KF. Now for asmuch as

within the circle DEF is taken a certaine poynt K, and from that poynt are drawen vnto the circumference moe then two equall right lines, namely, KB, KG, and KF: therefore (by the 9. of the third) K is the centre of the circle DEF. And the poynt K is the centre of the circle ABC. Wherefore two circles cutting the one the other haue one and the same centre: which (by the 5. of the third) is impossible. A circle therfore cutteth not a circle in moe pointes then two: which was required to be demonstrated.

GF are (by the 20. of the first) greater then the line FA, that is, then the line FH, take away the line GF which is common to them both. Wherefore the residue AG is greater then the residue GH. But the line DG is equall vnto the line GA (by the 15. definition of the first). Wherefore the line GD is greater then ye line GH: the lesse then the greater: which is impossible. Wherfore a right line drawen from the poynt F to the poynt G and produced, falleth not besides the poynt A, which is ye point of the touch. Wherefore it fallet

Draw a line from the centre I to the centre K, which shall passe by one of the touches, as for example by the poynt A.

Draw also these lines KG, and IG. And for asmuch as the line KG is equall to the line KA (by the 15. definition of the first) adde the line KI common to them both. Wherefore the whole line AI is equall to the two lines KG and KI: but vnto the line AI is equall the line IG (by the definition of a circle).

Take (by the first of the third) the centre of the circle ABCD, and let the same be ye poynt E. And (by the 12. of the first) from the point E draw vnto the lines AB &amp; CD

perpendicular lines EF and EG. And (by the first petition) draw these right lines AE and CE.Demonstration. Now for asmuch as a certaine right line EF drawen by the centre cutteth a certaine other right line AB not drawen by the centre, in such sort that it maketh right angles, therefore (by the third of the third) it deuideth it into two equall partes. Wherefore the line AF is equall to the line FB. Wherfore the line AB is double to the line AF: and by the same reason also the line CD is double to the line CG. But the line AB is equall to the line CD. Wherfore the line AF is also equall to the line CG. And for asmuch as (by the 15. definition of the first) the line AE is equall to the line EC, therefore the square of the line EC is equall to the square of the line AE. But vnto the square of the line AE, are equall (by the 47. of the first) the squares of the lines AF &amp; FE: for the angle at the poynt F is a right angle. And (by ye selfe same) to the square of the line EC are equall the squares of the lines EG and GC: for the angle at the poynt G is a right angle. Wherefore the squares of the lines AF and FE are equall to the squares of the lines CG and GE: of which the square of the line AF is equall to the square of the line

CG: for the line AF is equall to the line CG. Wherefore (by the third common sentence) the square remayning, namely, the square of the line FE, is equall to the square remayning, namely, to the square of the line EG. Wherefore the line EF is equall to the line EG.Demonstration. But right lines are sayd to be equally distant from ye centre, when perpendicular lines drawen frō the centre to those lines, are equall (by the 4. definition of the third). Wherfore the lines AB and CD are equally distant from the centre.
               But now suppose that the right lines AB and CD be equally distant from the centre,The second part which is the conuerse of the first. that is, let the perpendicular line EF be equall to the perpendicular line EG. Then I say that the line AB is equall to the line CD. For the same order of construction remayning, we may in like sort proue that the line AB is double to the line AF, and that the line CD is double to the line CG. And for asmuch as the line AE is equall to the line CE, for they are drawen from ye centre to the circumference, therfore the square of the line AE is equall to ye square of the line CE. But (by the 47. of the first) to the square of the line AE are equall the squares of the lines EF and FA. And (by the selfe same) to ye square of the line CE are equall the squares of the lines EG and GC. Wherfore the squares of the lines EF and FA are equall to the squares of the lines EG and GC. Of which the square of the line EG is equall to the square of the line EF, for the line EF is equall to the line EG. Wherefore (by the third common sentence) the square remayning, namely, the square of the line AF, is equall to the square of the line CG. Wherefore the line AC is equall vnto the line CG. But

the line AB is double to the line AF, and the line CD is double to the line CG. Wherefore the line AB is equall to the line CD. Wherefore in a circle equall right lines are equally distant from the centre. And lines equally distant from the centre, are equall the one to ye other: which was required to be proued.

And for asmuch as these two lines ME and EN are equall to these two lines FE and EG (by the 15. definition of the first) for they are drawen from the centre to the circumference, and the angle MEN is greater then the angle FEG, therefore (by the 24. of the first) the base MN is greater then the base FG. But it is proued that the line MN is equall to the line BC: Wherefore the line BC also is greater then the line FG. Wherefore the diameter AD is the greatest, and the line BC is greater then the line FG. Wherefore in a circle, the greatest line is the diameter, and of all the other lines, that line which is nigher to ye centre is alwaies greater then that line which is more distant: which was required to be proued.

                      Then I say that the line AD is the greatest of all the lines.

And the other lines eche of the one is so much greater then ech of the other, how much nigher it is vnto the centre. Ioyne together the endes of all these lines with the centre, by drawing these right lines EB, EC, EG, EK, EH, and EF. And (by the 20. of the first) the two sides EF and EG of the triangle EFG, shall be greater then the third side FG. And for asmuch as the sayd sides EF &amp; EG are equall to the line AD (by the definition of a circle) therefore the line AD is greater then the line FG. And by the same reason it is greater then euery one of the rest of the lines, if they be put to be bases of triangles: for that euery two sides drawen frō the

centre are equall to the line AD. Which is

the first part of the Proposition. Agayne, for asmuch as the two sides EF and EG of the triangle EFG, are equall to the two sides EH and EK of the triangle EHK, and the angle FEG is greater then the angle HEK, therfore (by the 24. of the first) the base FG is greater then the base HK. And by the same reason may it be proued, that the line AC is greater then the line AB. And so is manifest the whole Proposition.
               
            
            
               The 15. Theoreme. The 16. Proposition. If from the end of the diameter of a circle be drawen a right line making right angles: it shall fall without the circle: and betwene that right line and the circumference can not be drawen an other right line: and the angle of the semicircle is greater then any acute angle made of right lines, but the other angle is lesse then any acute angle made of right lines.
               SVppose that there be a circle ABC: whose centre let be the point D, and let the diameter therof be AB. Then I say yt a right line drawen from the poynt A, making with the diameter AB right angles, shall fall without the circle.The first part of this Theoreme. For if it do not, then if it be possible, let it fall within the circle as the line AC doth,

and draw a line from the point D to the point C.Demonstration leading to an absurditie. And for asmuch as (by the 15. definition of the first) the line DA is equall to the line DC, for they are drawen from the centre to the circumference, therefore the angle DAC is equall to the angle ACD. But the angle DAC is (by supposition) a right angle: Wherfore also the angle ACD is a right angle. Wherefore the angles DAC and ACD, are equall to two right angles: which (by the 17. of the first) is impossible. Wherefore a right line drawen from the poynt A, making with the diameter AB right angles, shall not fall within ye circle. In like sort also may we proue, that it falleth not in

the circumference. Wherefore it falleth without, as the line AE doth.
               I say also,Second part. that betwene the right line AE, and the circumference ACB, can not be drawen an other right line. For if it be possible, let the line AF so be drawen. And (by the 12. of the first) from the poynt D draw vnto the line FA a perpendicular line DG: And for asmuch as AGD is a right angle, but DAG is lesse then a right angle, therefore (by the 19. of the first) the side AD is greater then the side DG. But the line DA is equall to the line DH, for they are drawen from the centre to the circumference. Wherefore the line DH is greater then the line DG: namely, the lesse greater then the greater: which is impossible. Wherefore betwene the right line AE and the circumference ACB, can not be drawen an other right line.
               I say moreouer,Third part. that the angle of

the semicircle contayned vnder ye right line AB and the circūference CHA, is greater then any acute angle made of right lines. And the angle remayning cōtayned vnder ye circumference CHA and the right line AE, is lesse then any acute angle made of right lines. For if there be any angle made of right lines greater then that angle which is contayned vnder the right line BA and the circumference CHA, or lesse then that which is contayned vnder the circumference CHA and the right line AE, then betwene the circumference CHA and the right line AE, there shall fall a right line, which maketh the angle contayned vnder the right lines, greater then that angle which is contayned vnder the right line BA and the circumference CHA, and lesse then the angle which is contayned vnder the circumference CHA and the right line AE. But there can fall no such line, as it hath before bene proued. Wherfore no acute angle contained vnder right lines, is greater then the angle contayned vnder the right line BA and the circumference CHA, nor also lesse then the angle contayned vnder the circumference CHA and the line AE.
               
                  Correlary.
                  Hereby it is manifest that a perpendicular line drawen frō the end of the diameter of a circle toucheth the circle: and that a right line toucheth a circle in one poynt onely. For it was proued (by the 2. of the third) that a right line drawen from two pointes taken in

the circumference of a circle, shall fall within the circle. Which was required to be demonstrated.

And (by the first petition) drawe these lines EBF and AB. Then I

say, that from the point A is drawen to the circle BCD a touch line AB.Demonstration. For for asmuch as the point E is the centre of the circle BCD, and also of the circle AFG, therfore the line EA is equall to the line EF, and the line ED to ye line EB, for they are drawen from the centre to the circumference. Wherefore to these two lines AE and EB, are equall these two lines EF &amp; ED, and the angle at the poynt E is common to them both: Wherefore (by the 4. of the first) the base DF is equall to the base AB, and ye triangle DEF is equall to the triangle EBA, and the rest of the angles remayning to the rest of the angles remayning. Wherefore the angle EDF is equall to ye angle EBA. But the angle EDF is a right angle: Wherfore also the angle EBA is a right angle, and the line EB is drawen from the centre. But a perpendicular line drawen from the end of the diameter of a circle, toucheth the circle (by ye Corellary of the 16. of the third). Wherefore the line AB toucheth the circle BCD. Wherfore from the point geuen, namely, A, is drawen vnto ye circle geuē BCD, a touch line AB: which was required to be done.

And (by the first petition) from the poynt F to the poynt C drawe a right line FC. Then I say, that CF is a perpendicular line to DE. For if not, draw (by the 12. of the first) from the

poynt F to the line DE a perpendicular line FG. And for asmuch as the angle FGC is a right angle, therefore the angle GCF is an acute angle: Wherefore the angle FGC is greater then ye angle FCG, but vnto the greater angle is subtended the greater side (by the 19. of the first). Wherefore the line FC is greater then the line FG. But the line FC is equall to the line FB, for they are drawen from the centre to the circumference: Wherfore the line FB also is greater then the line FG, namely, the lesse then the greater: which is impossible. Wherefore the line FG is not a perpendicular line vnto the line DE. And in like sort may we proue, that no other line is a perpendicular line vnto ye line DE besides the line FC: Wherfore the line FC is a perpendicular line to DE. If therefore a right line touch

a circle, &amp; from y• centre to ye touch be drawen a right line, yt right line so drawen shall be a perpendicular line to ye touch line: which was required to be proued.

                      And let the centre of the circle be the point F. And draw a right line from F to C. Then

I say that the line FC is perpendicular vnto the line DE. For if the line FC be not a perpēdiculer vnto the line DE, then, by the conuerse of the x. definition of the first boke, the angles DCF &amp; FCE shal be vnequall: &amp; therfore the one is greater then a right angle, and the other is lesse then a right angle. (For the angles DCF and FCE are by the 13. of the first equall to two right angles) Let the angle FCE, if it be possible, be greater then a right angle, that is, let it be an obtuse angle. Wherfore the angle DCF 
                        •
                     hal be an acute angle. And forasmuch as by suppositiō the right line DE touche

                     h the circle ABC, therefore it cutteth not the circle. Wherefore the circumference BC falleth betwene the right lines DC &amp; CF: &amp; therfore the acute and rectiline angle DCF shall be greater then the angle of the semicircle BCF which is contayned vnder the circumferēce BC &amp; the right line CF. And so shall there be geuē a rectiline &amp; acute angle greater then the angle of a semicircle: which is contrary to the 16. proposition of this booke. Wherfore the angle DCF is not lesse then a right angle. In like sort also may we proue that it is not greater then a right angle. Wherfore it is a right angle, and therfore also the angle FCE is a right angle. Wherefore the right line FC is a perpendicular vnto the right line DE by the 10. definition of the first

               The 17. Theoreme. The 19. Proposition. If a right lyne doo touche a circle, and from the point of the touch be raysed vp vnto the touch lyne a perpendicular lyne, in that lyne so raysed vp is the centre of the circle.
               SVppose that the right line DE do

touch the circle ABC in the point C. And from C raise vp (by ye 
                  11. of the first) vnto the line DE a perpendicular line CA. Then I say, that in the line CA is the centre of the circle. For if not, then if it be possible, let ye centre be without the line CA, as in ye poynt F. And (by the first petition) draw a right line from C to F.Demonstration leading to an impossibilitie. And for asmuch as a certaine right line DE toucheth the circle ABC, and from the centre to the touch is drawen a right line CF, therefore (by the 18. of the third) FC is a perpendicular line to

DE. Wherefore the angle FCE is a right angle. But the angle ACE is also a right angle: Wherefore the angle FCE is equall to the angle ACE, namely, the lesse vnto the greater: which is impossible
                     •
                   Wherefore the poynt F is not the centre of the circle ABC. And in like sort may we proue, yt it is no other where but in the line AC. If therefore a right line do touch a circle, and from the point of the touch be raised vp vnto the touch line a perpendicular line, in that line so raised vp is the centre of the circle: which was required to be proued.
            
            
               The 18. Theoreme. The 20. Proposition. In a circle an angle set at the centre, is double to an angle set at the circumference, so that both the angles haue to their base one and the same circumference.
               SVppose that there be a circle ABC, and at the centre thereof,Two cases in thys Proposition the one when the angle set at the circumference includeth the center. namely, the poynt E, let ye angle BEC be set, &amp; at the circumference let there be set the angle BAC, and let them both haue one and the same base, namely, the circumference BC. Then I say, that the angle BEC is double to the angle BAC. Draw ye right

line AE, and (by the second petition) extend it to the poynt F. Now for asmuch as the line AE is equall to the line EB,Demonstration. for they are drawen from the centre vnto the circumference, the angle EAB is equall to the angle EBA (by the 5. of the first). Wherefore the angles EAB and EBA are double to the angle EAB. But (by the 32. of the same) the angle BEF is equall to the angles EAB and EBA: Wherefore the angle BEF is double to the angle EAB. And by the same reason the angle FEC is double to the angle EAC. Wherefore the whole angle BEC is double to the whole angle BAC.
               Againe, suppose that there be set an other angle at the circumference,The other whē the same angle set at the circumference includeth not the center. and let the same be BDC. And (by the 
                     •
                  irst petition) draw a line from D to E. And (by the second petition) extend the line DE vnto the poynt G. And in like sort may we proue, that the angle GEC is double to the angle EDC. Of which the angle GEB is double to the angle EDB. Wherfore the angle remayning BEC is double to the angle remayning BDC. Wherfore in a circle an angle set at the centre, is double to an angle set at the circumference, so that both the angles haue to their base one and the same circumference: which was required to be demonstrated.
            
            
               
               The 19. Theoreme. The 21. Proposition. In a circle the angles which consist in one and the selfe same section or segment, are equall the one to the other.
               
                  SVppose yt there be a circle ABCD, &amp; in the segment therof BAED, let there consist these angles BAD and BED. Then I say, that the angles BAD and BED are equall the one to the other. Take (by the first of the third) the centre of the circle

ABCD,

                  Now for asmuch as the angle BFD is set at the centre, and the angle BAD at the circumference, and they haue both one and ye same base, namely, the circumference BCD, therefore the angle BFD is (by the Proposition going before) double to the angle BAD: and by the same reason the angle BFD is also double to the angle BED. Wherefore (by the 7. common sentence) the angle BAD is equall to the angle BED. Wherefore in a circle the angles which consiste in one and the selfe same segment, are equall the one to the other: which was required to be proued.

                  In this proposition are three cases. For the angles consisting in one and the self same segment, the segment may either be greater thē a semicircle, or lesse then a semicircle, or els iust a semicircle. For the first case the demonstration before put serueth.
               But now suppose that the angles BAD and BED do consist in the sectiō 
                  BAD, which let be lesse then a semicircle. Euen in this case also

I say that the angles BAD and BED are equall. For draw a right line from A to E. And let the lines AD and BE cutte the one the other in the poynt G, wherefore the segment ACE is greater then a semicircle. And therfore by the first part of this proposition the angles whiche are in it, namely, the angles ABE and EDA are equall the one to the other. And forasmuch as in the triangle ABG the inward and opposite angles ABG and GAB are equall to the outwarde angle BGD, and by the same reason the two angles EDG and GED of the triangle DEG are equall to the selfe same outward angle BGD. Wherfore the two angles ABG and GAB are equall to the two angles EDG and GED

CAB, ABC, and BCA, are equall to two right angles. But (by the 21. of the third) the angle CAB is equall to the

angle BDC, for they consist in one and the self same segmēt, namely, BADC. And (by the same Proposition) the angle ACB is equall to the angle ADB, for they consist in one and the same segment ADCB. Wherefore the whol

                   and the angle EBA shall be equall to the angle EFA. And by the same reason the angle EBC shall be equall to the angle EFC. Wherefore the whole angle ABC is equall to the whole angle AFC. But by the 21. of the first, the angle AFC is greater then the angle ADC. Wherfore also the angle ABC is greater then the angle ADC. Wherefore by the definition the sections ABC and ADC are not lyke, which is contrary to the supposition. Wherefore they are not lyke and vnequall: which was required to be proued.
            
            
               The 22. Theorme. The 24. Proposition. Like segmentes of circles described vppon equall right lines, are equall the one to the other.
               
                  SVppose that vpon these equall right lines AB and CD be described these like segmentes of circles, namely, AEB and CFD. Then I say, that the segment AEB is equall to the segment CFD. For putting the segment AEB vpon the segment CFD, and the poynt A vpon ye poynt C, and the right line AB vpon the right line CD, the poynt B also shall fall vpon the poynt D, for ye line AB is equall to the line CD. And the right line AB exactly agreing with

the right line CD, y• segment also AEB shall exactly agree with the segment CFD.
                  
                     Demonstration leading to an impossibilitie.
                   
                  For if the right line AB do exactly agree with the right line CD, and the segment AEB do not exactly agree with the segment CFD, but differeth as the segment CGD doth: Now (by the 13. of the third) a circle cutteth not a circle in more pointes then two, but the circle CGD cutteth ye circle CFD in more pointes thē two, that is, in the points C, G, and D: which is (by the same) impossible. Wherefore the right line AB exactly agreing with the right line CD, the segment AEB shall not but exactly agree with the segment CFD: Wherefore it exactly agreeth with it, and is equall vnto it. Wherefore like segmentes of circles described vpon equall right lines, are equall the one to the other: which was required to be proued.
               
               This Proposition may also be demonstrated by the former proposition For if the sections AEB and CFD being like and set vpon equall right lines AB and CD,

                  Suppose that there be two right lines AB &amp; CD which let be equall: and vpon thē let there be set these like sections ABK, and CDE.

                   Then I say that the said sections are equall. For if not, then let CED be the greater section. And deuide the two lines AB and CD into two equall partes, the line AB in the pointe F, and the line CD in the

point G. And erect two perpendicular lines FK and GE. And draw these right lines AK &amp; KB: EC, ED. And forasmuch as the section CED is the greater, therefore the perpendicular line GE is greater then the perpendicular FK: From the lyne GE cut of a line equall to the line FK, which let be GH: and draw these right lines CH and HD. And forasmuch as in the triangle AKF the two sides AF and FK are equall to the two sides CG &amp; GH of the triangle CHG, and the angles at the pointes F and G are equal (for that they are right angles) therfore (by the 4. of the first) the base A K is equall to the base CH, and the angle AKF to the angle CHG. And by the same reason the angle BKF is equall to the angle DHG. Wherfore the whole angle AKB is equall to the whole angle CHD. But the angle CHD is greater then the angle CED by the 21. of the first. Wherfore also the angle AKD is greater then the angle CED. Wherfore the sections are not lyke, which is contrary to the supposition.

and EDF lesse then two right angles. Wherefore (by the fift peticion) the lines DF and EF being produced shall concurre. Let them concurre in the point F. And forasmuch as a certaine right line DF deuideth a certaine right lyne AB into two equall partes and perpendicularly, therfore (by the corollary of the first of this booke) in the line DF is the centre of the circle, &amp; by the same reason the centre of the selfe same circle shalbe in the right line EF. Wherfore the centre of the circle wherof ABC is a section, is in the point F, which is commō to either of the lines DF and EF. Wherfore a section of a circle being geuē, namely, the section ABC, there is described the circle of the same section: which was required to be done.
                  And by this last generall way,
                        An addition.
                      if there be geuen three pointes, set howsoeuer, so that they be not all three in one right line, a man may describe a circle which shall passe by all the said three pointes. For as in the example before put, if you suppose onely the 3. pointes A, B, C, to be geuen and not the circumference ABC to be drawen, yet following the selfe

                     ) and the angle ADF is equall to the angle BDF (for they are both right angles) therfore (by the 4. of the first) the base AF is equall to the base BF. And by the same reason the line FC is equall to the line FB. Wherefore these three lines FA, FB and FC are equall the one to the other. Wherefore makyng the centre the point F and the space FB, it shall also passe by the pointes A and C. Which was required to be done. This proposition is very necessary for many things as you shal afterward see.
                  
                     Campane putteth an other way, how to describe the

whole circle of a sectiō geuen.
                        An other construction and demonstration of this Proposition after, Campane
                      Suppose that the section be AB. It is required to describe the whole circle of the same section. Draw in the section two lines at all aduentures AC and BD: which deuide into two equall parts AC in the point E, and BD in the pointe F. Then from the two pointes of the deuisions draw within the section two perpendicular lines EG and FH which let cutte the one the other in the point K. And the centre of the circle shall be in either of the said perpendicular lines by the corollary of the first of this booke. Wherfore the point K is the centre of the circle: which was required to be done.
                  But if the lines EG &amp; FH do not cut the one the other,

but make one right line as doth GH in the secōd figure: which happeneth when the two lines AC and BD are equidistant. Then the line GH, being applyed to either part of the circumference geuen, shall passe by the centre of the circle, by the selfe same Corollary. For the lines EG and FH cannot be equidistant. For then one and the self same circumference should haue two centres. Wherfore the line HG being deuided into

two equall partes in the point K, the said point K shall be the centre of the section.
                  Pelitarius here addeth a briefe way how to finde out the centre of a circle, which is commonly vsed of Artificers.
                  Suppose that the circumference be ABCD, whose centre it is required to finde out.
                        A ready way to finde out the center of a circle commō

                      Take a point in the circumference geuen which let be A, vppon which describe a circle with what openyng of the compasse you will, which let be EFG. Then take an other point in the circumference geuen which let be B, vpon which describe an other circle with the same opening of the compasse that the circle

EFG was described, and let the same be EHG, which let cut the circle EFG in the two pointes E and G. (I haue not here drawen the whole circles, but onely those partes of them which cut the one the other for auoyding of confusion) And drawe from those centres these right lines AE, BE, AG, and BG, which foure lines shall be equall, by reason they are semidiameters o
                        •
                      equall circles. And draw a right line from A to B, and so shall there be made two Isosceles triangles AEB, and AGB vnto whom the line AB is a common base. Now then deuide the line AB into two equal partes in the point K which must nedes fall betwene the two circumference EFG and EHG, otherwise the part should be greater then his whole. Drawe a line from E to K and produce it to the point G. Now you see that there are two Isosceles triangles deuided into foure equall triangles EAK, EBK, GAK and GBK. For the two sides AE and AK of the triangle AEK are equall to the two sides BE and BK of the triangle BEK, and the base EK is common to them both. Wherefore the two angles at the point K of the two triangles AEK and BEK are by the 8. of the first equall

                      and therfore are right angles. And by the same reason the other angles at the poynte K are right angles. Wherfore EG is one right lyne by the 14. of the first. Which forasmuch as it deuideth the line AB perpendicularly, therefore it passeth by the center by by the corollary of the first of this booke. And so if you take two other poyntes, name

And here note that to do this mechanically not regardyng demonstration, you neede onely to marke the poyntes where the circles cut the one the other, namely, the poyntes E, G, and L, M, and by those poyntes to produce the lines EG and LM till they cut the one the other, and where they cut the one the other, there is the centre of the circle, as you see here in the seconde figure.

               SVppose that these circles ABC and DEF, be equall. And from their centres, namely, the pointes G and H, let there be drawen these equall angles BGC and EHF: and likewise from their circumferences these equall angles BAC and EDF. Then I say, that the circumference BKC is equall to the circumference ELF. Draw (by the first petition) right lines from B to C,Construction. and from E to F. And for asmuch as the circles ABC and DEF are equall, the right lines also drawen from their centres to their circumferences,Demonstration. are (by the first definition of the third) equall the one to the other. Wherefore these two lines BG and

GC, are equall to these two lines EH and HF. And the angle at the poynt G is equall to the angle at the point H: Wherfore (by the 4. of the first) the base BC is equall to ye base EF. And for asmuch as the angle at the poynt A is equall to the angle at the point D, therefore the segment BAC is like to the segment EDF. And they are described vpon equall right lines BC and EF. But like segmentes of circles described vpon equall right lines, are (by the 24. of the third) equall the one to the other. Wherefore the segment BAC is equall to the segment EDF. And the whole circle ABC is equall to ye whole circle DEF. Wherefore (by the third common sentence) the circumference remayning BKC is equall to the circumference remayning ELF. Wherefore equall angles in equall circles consist in equall circumferences, whether the angles be drawen from the centres or from the circumferences: which was required to be demonstrated.
            
            
               The 24. Theoreme. The 27. Proposition. In equall circles the angles which consist in equall circumferences, are equall the one to the other, whether the angles be drawen from the centres, or from the circumferences.
               
                  SVppose yt these circles ABC, and DEF, be equall. And vpon these equall circumferences of the same circles, namely, vpon BC and EF, let there consist these angles BGC and EHF drawen from the centres, and also these angles BAC and EDF drawen from the circumferences. Then I say, that the angle BGC is equall to the angle EHF, and the angle BAC to the angle EDF. If the angle BGC be equall to the angle EHF, then it is manifest, that the angle BAC is equall to ye angle EDF (by the 20. of the third). But if the angle BGC be not equall to ye angle EHF,Demonstration leading to an impossibilitie. then is the one of them greater then the other. Let the angle BGC be greater And (by the

                  23. of the first) vpon the right line BG, and vnto the point geuen in it G, make vnto the angle EHF an equall angle BGK. But (by the 26. of ye third) equall angles in equall circles consist vpō equall circumferences, whether they be drawen from the centres or from the circumferences. Wherefore the circumference BK is equall to the circumference EF. But the circumference EF is equall to the circumference BC: Wherefore the circumference BK also is equall to the circumference BC, the lesse to the greater: which is impossible. Wherfore the angle BGC is not vnequall to the angle EHF: Wherefore it is equall. And (by the 20. of the third) the angle at the point A is the halfe of the angle BGC: and (by the same) the angle at the point D is the halfe of the angle EHF. Wherefore the angle at the point A is equall to the angle at the point D. Wherefore in equall circles, the angles which consist in equall circumferences, are equall the one to the other, whether the angles be drawen from the centres or from the circumferences: which was required to be proued.

And in them let there be drawen these equall right lines BC and EF, which let cut away these circumferences BAC and DEF being the greater, &amp; also these circumferences BGC and EHF being the lesse. Then I say, that the greater circumference BAC is equall to the greater circumference EDF: and the lesse circumference BGC is equall to the lesse circumference EHF.Construction.

Wherefore (by the 8. of ye first) the angle BKC is equall to the angle ELF. But (by the 26. of the third) equall angles drawen from the centres, consist vpon equall circumferences. Wherfore the circumference BGC is equall to the circumference EHF: and ye whole circle ABC is equall to the whole circle DEF. Wherefore the circumference remayning BAC, is (by the third common sentence) equall to the circumference remayning EDF. Wherefore in circles, equall right lines do cut away equall circumferences, the greater equall to the greater, and the lesse equall to the lesse: which was required to be proued.

And for asmuch as the circumference BGC is equall to the circumference EHF,Demonstration. the angle BKC is equall to ye angle ELF (by the 27. of the third). And for asmuch as the circles ABC and DEF are equall the one to the other, therefore (by the first definition of the third) the lines

Wherefore in equall circles vnder equall circumferences, are subtended equall right lines: which was required to be demonstrated.

Againe forasmuch as the line AE is equall to the line EC, the angle ACE is (by the same) equall to the angle CAE. Wherfore the whole angle BAC is equall to these two angles ABC and ACB.

to two right angles. But the angle ABC is lesse then a right angle. Wherfore the angle remayning ADC is greater then a right angle, and it is in a segment which is lesse then the semicircle.

Proposition of thys booke, it is manifest, that although in mixt angles, which are contayned vnder a right line and the circumference of a circle, there may be geuen an angle lesse &amp; greater then a right angle, yet can there neuer be geuē an angle equall to a right angle. For euery section of a circle is eyther a semicircle, or greater then a semicircle, or lesse, but the angle of a semicircle is by the 16. of thys booke, lesse then a right angle, and so also is the angle of a lesse section by thys 31.

touch line EF do make, are equall to the angles which are in the alternate segmentes of the circle, that is, the angle FBD is equall to the angle which consisteth in the segment BAD, and the angle EBD is equall to the angle which consisteth in the segment BCD.Construction. Raise vp (by the 11. of the first) from ye point B vnto the right line EF a perpendicular line BA. And in the circumference BD take a point at all aduentures, and let the same be C. And draw these right lines AD, DC, and CB.Demonstration. And for asmuch as a certaine right line EF toucheth the circle ABC in the point B, and from the point B where the touch is, is raysed vp vnto the touch line a perpendicular

BA. Therfore (by the 19. of the third) in the line BA is the centre of the circle ABCD. Wherfore ye angle ADB being in the semicircle, is (by the 31. of the third) a right angle. Wherefore the angles remayning BAD and ABD, are equall to one right angle. But the angle ABF is a right angle. Wherefore the angle ABF is equall to the angles BAD and ABD. Take away ye angle ABD which is common to them both. Wherefore the angle remayning DBF, is equall to the angle remayning BAD, which is in the alternate segment of the circle. And for asmuch as in the circle is a figure of fower sides, namely, ABCD, therfore (by the 22. of the third) the angles which are opposite the one to the other, are equall to two right angles. Wherfore the angles BAD and BCD, are equall to two right angles. But the angles DBF and DBE, are also equall to two right angles. Wherefore the angles DBF and DBE, are equall to the angles BAD and BCD. Of which we haue proued that the angle BAD is equall to the angle DBF. Wherefore the angle remayning DBE, is equall to the angle remayning DCB, which is in the alternate segment of the circle, namely, in the segment DCB. If therfore a right line touch a circle, and from the touch be drawen a right line cutting the circle: the angles which that line and the touch line make, are equall to ye angles which consist in ye alternate segmentes of the circle: which was required to be proued.

                  For the line drawen from the touch and cutting the circle, may eyther passe by the centre or not. If it passe by the centre, then is it manifest (by the 18. of thys booke) that it falleth perpendicularly vpon the touch line, and deuideth the circle into two equall partes, so that all the angles in eche semicircle, are by the former Proposition, right angles, and therfore equall to the alternate angles made by the sayd perpendicular line and the touch line. If it passe not by the centre, then followe the construction and demonstration before put.

Wherfore making the centre G and the space GA describe (by the 3. peticion) a circle and it shall passe by the point B: describe such a circle &amp; let the same be ABE: And draw a line from E to B.

But the angle DAB is equall to the angle C, wherfore the angle C is equall to the angle AEB. Wherfore vpon the right line geuen AB is described a segment of a circle which contayneth the angle AEB, which is equall to the angle geuen, namely, to C.

                      and from the point F draw to the right lines AC and DB perpendicular lines FG and FH (by the 12. of the first) and draw these right lines FB, FC, and FE.

And forasmuch as a certaine right line FG drawen by the centre,
                  
                     Demonstration.
                   
                  cutteth a certaine right line AC not drawen by the centre in such sorte that it maketh right angles, it therfore deuideth the line AC into two equall partes (by the 3. of the third). Wherfore the line AG is equall to the line GC. and forasmuch as the right line AC is deuided into two equall partes in the point G, and into two vnequall partes in the point E: therfore (by the 5. of the second) the rectangle parallelogramme contained vnder the lines. AE and EC together with the square of the line EG is equall to the square of the line GC. Put the square of the line GF common to them both, wherfore that which is contained vnder the lines AE &amp; EC together with the squares of the lines EG and GF is equall to the squares of the lines GF &amp; GC. But vnto ye squares of ye lines EG &amp; GF is equall ye square of ye line FE (by the 47. of the first): and to the squares of the lines GC and GF is equall the square of the line FC (by the same) Wherfore that which is contained vnder the lines AE and EC, together with the square of the line FE is equall to the square of the line FC. But the line FC is equall to the line FB. For they are drawen from the centre to the circumference. Wherfore that which is contained vnder the lines AE and E
                        •
                      together with the square of the lyne FE is equal to the square of the line FB. And by the same demonstration that which is contained vnder the lines DE and EB together with the square of the line FE is equall to the square of the line FB. Wherfore that which is contained vnder the lines AE and EC together with the square of the line EF is equall to that which is contayned vnder the lines DE and EB together with the square of the line EF. Take away the square of the line FE which is common to them both. Wherfore the rectangle parallelogramme remayning which is contayned vnder the lines AE and EC is equall to the rectangle parallelogramme remayning, which is contayned vnder the lines DE and EB. If therefore in a circle two right lines do cut the one the other: the rectangle parallelogramme comprehended

vnder the segmentes or parts of the one line is equall to the rectangle parallelograme comprehended vnder the segmentes or parts of the other line: which was required to be demonstrated.
               
               In thys Proposition are three cases:
                     Three cases in this 
                           •
                        roposition.
                   For eyther both the lines passe by the centre, or 
                     •
                  eyther of them passeth by the centre: or the one passeth by the centre and the other not. The two first cases are before demonstrated.
               But now let one of the lines onely, namely, the line AC passe by the centre, which let be the poynt F,
                  
                     The third case.
                   and let it cut the other line, namely, BD, in the poynt E. Now then the line AC deuideth the line BD eyther into two equall partes, or into two vnequall partes. Fyrst let it deuide it into two equall partes: Wherefore also it deuideth it 
                     •
                  ight angled wyse by the 3. of thys booke. Drawe a right line from B to F. Wherefore BEF is a right angled triangle. And for asmuch as the right line AC is deuided into two equall partes in the poynt F, &amp; into two vnequall partes in the poynt E. Therfore the rectangle figure contayned vnder the

lines AE and EC together with the square of the line EF, is equall to the square of the line FC (by the 5. of the second). But vnto the square of the line FC is equall the square of the line BF (for that the lines FB and FC are equall). Therfore that which is cōtayned vnder the lines AE and EC together with the square of the line EF, is 
                     ••
                  uall to the square of the line BF. But vnto the square of the line BF, are equall the squares of the lines BE and EF (by the 47. of the first). Wherefore that which is contayned vnder the lines AE and EC together with the square of the line EF, is equall to the squares of the lines BE and EF. Take away the square of the line EF which is common to them both: Wherefore that which remayneth, namely, that which is contayned vnder the lines AE and EC, is equall to the residue, namely, to the square of the line BE. But the square o
                     •
                   the line BE is that which is contained vnder the lines BE and ED: for (by supposition) the line BE is equall to the line ED. Wher

                  fore that which is contayned vnder the lines AE &amp; EC, is equall to that which is contayned vnder the lines BE and ED: which was required to be proued.
               But now let the line AC passing by the centre,

deuide, the line BD not passing by the centre, vnequally in the poynt E. And frō the poynt E raise vp vnto the line AC a perpendicular line EH, which produce on the other side to the poynt G. Where
                     •
                  ore (by the 3. of this booke) the line EH is equall to the line EG. Wherfore as we haue before proued, that which is contayned vnder the lines AE and EC, is equall to that which is contayned vnder the lines GE &amp; EH: but that which is contayned vnder the lines BE and ED, is also equall to that which is contayned vnder the lines GE and EH, by the second case of thys Proposition: Wherfore that which is contayned vnder the lines AE and EC, is equall to that which is contayned vnder the lines BE and ED: which was agayne required to be proued.
               Amongest all the Propositions in this third booke, doubtles thys is one of the chiefest. For it setteth forth vnto vs the wonderfull nature of a circle. So that by

it may be done many goodly conclusions in Geometry, as shall afterward be declared when occasion shall serue.
            
            
               The 30. Theoreme. The 36. Proposition. If without a circle be taken a certaine point, and from that point be drawen to the circle two right lines, so that the one of them do cut the circle, and the other do touch the circle: the rectangle parallelogramme which is comprehended vnder the whole right line which cutteth the circle, and that portion of the same line that lieth betwene the point and the vtter circūference of the circle, is equall to the square made of the line that toucheth the circle.
               SVppose that the circle be ABC: and without the same circle take any point at all aduentures, and let the same be D.Construction. And from the point D let there be drawen to the circle two right lines DCA and DB, and let the right line DCA cut the circle ACB in the point C, and let the right line BD touch the same. Then I say, that the rectangle parallelogramme contayned vnder the lines AD and DC,Two cases in this Proposition. is equall to the square of the line BD. Now the line DCA is either drawen by the centre, or not.
               First let it be drawen by the centre.The first case. And (by

the first of the third) let the poynt F be ye centre of the circle ABC, and drawe a line from F to B. Wherefore the angle FBD is a right angle.Demonstration. And for asmuch as ye right line AC is deuided into two equall partes in the poynt F, and vnto it is added directly a right line CD, therfore (by the 6. of the second) that which is contayned vnder the lines AD and DC together with the square of ye line CF, is equall to the square of the line FD. But the line FC is equall to the line FB, for they are drawen from the centre to ye circumference: Wherfore that which is contayned vnder the lines AD and DC together with the square of the line FB, is equall to the square of the line FD. But ye square of the line FD, is (by the 47. of the first) equall to the squares of the lines FB and BD (for the angle FBD is a right angle). Wherefore that which is contayned vnder the lines AD and DC together with the square of the line FB, is equall to the

squares of the lines FB and BD. Take away the square of the line FB which is common to them both. Wherefore that which remayneth, namely, that which is contayned vnder the lines AD and DC, is equall to the square made of the line DB which toucheth the circle.
               But now suppose that the right line DCA be

not drawen by the centre of the circle ABC.The second case. And (by the first of the third) let the point E be ye centre of the circle ABC.Construction. And from ye poynt E, draw (by the 12. of the first) vnto the line AC a perpendicular line EF, and draw these right lines EB, EC, and ED.Demonstration. Now the angle EFD is a right angle. And 
                     •
                  or asmuch as a certaine right line EF drawen by the centre, cutteth a certayne other right line AC not drawen by the centre, in such sort that it maketh right angles, it deuideth it (by ye third of the third) into two equall partes. Wherefore the line AF is equall to the line FC. And for asmuch as the right line AC is deuided into two equall partes in the poynt F, &amp; vnto it is added directly an other right line making both one right line, therefore (by the 6. of the second) that which is contayned vnder the lines DA and DC together with the square of the line FC, is equall to the square of the line FD: put the square of the line FE common to them both. Wherefore that which is contayned vnder the lines DA and DC together with the squares of the lines CF and FE, is equall to the squares of the lines FD and FE. But to the squares of the lines FD and FE, is equall the square of the line DE (by the 47. of the first) for the angle EFD is a right angle. And to the squares of the lines CF and FE, is equall the square of the line CE (by the same). Wherfore that which is contayned vnder the lines AD and DC together with the square of the line EC, is equall to the square of the line ED. But the line EC is equall to the line EB: for they are drawen from the centre to the circumference. Wherefore that which is contayned vnder the lines AD and DC together with the square of the line EB, is equall to the square of the line ED. But to the square of the line ED, are equall the squares of the lines EB and BD (by the 47. of the first) for the angle EBD is a right angle: Wherefore that which is contayned vnder the lines AD and DC together with the square of the line EB, is equall to the squares of the lines EB and BD. Take away the square of the line EB which is common to them both: Wherefore the residue, namely, that which is contayned vnder the lines AD and DC, is equall to the square of the line DB. If therfore without a circle be taken a certaine point, and from that poynt be drawen to the circle two right lines, so that the one of them do cut the circle, and the other do

                  
                     •
                  ouch the circle: the rectangle parallelogramme which is comprehended vnder the whole right line which cutteth the circle and that portion of the same line that lieth betwene the poynt and the vtter circumference of the circle, is equall to the square made of the line that toucheth the circle: which was required to be demonstrated.

                        First Corollary.
                      
                     the rectangle Parallelogrammes contayned vnder euery one of them and hys outward par

                  And thys is hereby manifest, for that euery one of those rectangle Parallelogrammes are equall to the square of the line which is drawen from that poynt and toucheth the circle by thys 36. Proposition. Hereunto he addeth.
                  
                     If two lines drawen from one and the selfe same point do touch a circle,
                     
                        Second Corollary.
                      
                     they are equall the one to the other.
                  
                  Which although it neede no demonstration, for that the square of eyther of them is equall to that which is contayned vnder the line drawen from the same poynt and hys outward part: yet he thus proueth it.
                  Suppose that there be a circle BCD, whose

centre let be E, and without it take the point A. And from the poynt A drawe two lines AB and AD, which let touch the circle in the poyntes B and D. Then I say, that they are equall. Draw these right lines EB, ED, and AE. And by the 18. of thys booke, eyther of the angles at the poyntes B and D is a right angle. Wherefore (by the 47. of the first) the square of the line AE, is equall to the two squares of the lines AB 
                     
                        •
                     nd EB: and by the same reason, to the two squares of the lines AD and ED. Wherefore the two squares of the lines AB and EB, are equall to the two squares of the lines AD and ED. And for asmuch as the squares of the lines EB and ED are equall, therefore the two other squares of the lines AB and AD are also equall. Wherfore the line AB is equall to the line AD
                     
                        •
                      which was required to be proued.
                  The same may be proued an other way: Draw a line from B to D. And (by the 5. of the first) the angle EBD is equall to the angle EDB. And for asmuch as the two angles ABE and ADE are equall, namely, for that they are right angles: if you take from them the equall angles EBD &amp; EDB, the two other angles remayning, namely, the angles ABD and ADB shall be equall. Wherefore (by the 6. of the first) the line AB is equall to the line AD.
                  
               
               
                  ¶ Hereunto also Pelitarius addeth this Corollary.
                  
                     From a poynt geuen without 
                           •
                         circle, can be drawen vnto a circle onely two touch lines.
                     
                        Third Corollary.
                     
                  
                  The former description remayning, I say that from the poynt A can be drawen vnto

the circle BCD no more touch lines, but the two lines AB and AD. For if it be possible, let AF also be in the former figure a touch line, touching the circle in the poynt F. And prawe a line from E to F. And the angle at the point F shall be a right angle, by the 18. of this booke: Wherefore it is equall to the angle EBA, which is contrary to the 20. of the first.
                  This may also be thus proued. For asmuch as all the lines drawen from one and the selfe same poynt &amp; touching a circle are equall, as we haue before proued, but the lines AB and AF can not be equall, by the 8. Proposition of this booke, therefore the line AF can not touch the circle BCD.
                  
               
            
            
               The 31. Theoreme. The 37. Proposition. If without a circle be taken a certaine point, and from that point be drawen to the circle two right lines, of which, the one doth cut the circle and the other falleth vpon the circle, and that in such sort, that the rectangle parallelogramme which is cōtayned vnder the whole right line which cutteth the circle, and that portion of the same line that lieth betwene the point and the vtter circumferēce of the circle, is equall to the square made of the line that falleth vpon the circle: then that line that so falleth vpon the circle shall touch the circle.
               LEt the circle be ABC: and without

the same circle take a point, and let the same be D,This proposition is the cō
                     uerse of the former. &amp; from the point D let there be drawen to the circle ABC two right lines DCA and DB: and let DCA cut the circle, and DB fall vpon the circle. And that in such sort, that that which is contayned vnder the lines AD and DC, be equall to the square of the line DB. Then I say, that ye line DB toucheth the circle ABC. Drawe (by the 17. of the third) from the poynt D a right line touching the circle ABC, and let the same be DE.Construction. And (by the first of the same) let the point F be the centre of the circle ABC: and draw these right lines FE, FB, and FD. Wherfore the angle FED is a right angle.Demonstration. And for asmuch as the right line DE toucheth the circle ABC, and the right line DCA cutteth the same, therfore (by the Proposition going before) that which is contayned vnder the lines AD and DC, is equall to the square of the line DE. But that which is contayned

vnder the lines AD and DC, is supposed to be equall to the square of the line DB. Wherefore the square of the line DE is equall to the square of the line DB. Wherefore also the line DE is equall to the line DB. And the line FE is equall to the line FB, for they are drawen from the centre to ye circumference. Now therefore these two lines DE and EF are equall to these two lines DB and BF, and FD is a common base to them both. Wherefore (by the 8. of the first) the angle DEF is equall to the angle DBF. But the angle DEF is a right angle. Wherefore also the angle DBF is a right angle. And ye line FB being produced, shall be the diameter of the circle. But if from the end of the diameter of a circle be drawen a right line making right angles, the right line so drawen toucheth the circle (by the Correllary of the 16. of the third). Wherfore the right line DB toucheth the circle ABC. And the like demonstration will serue if the centre be in the line AC. If therefore without a circle be taken a certaine point, and from that poynt be drawen to the circle two right lines, of which the one doth cut the circle, and the other falleth vpon the circle, and that in such sort, that the rectangle parallelogramme which is contayned vnder the whole right line which cutteth the circle, and that portion of the same line that lieth betwene the poynt and the vtter circumference of the circle, is equall to the square made of the line that falleth vpon the circle: then the line that so falleth vpon the circle shall touch the circle: which was required to be proued.
               
                  ¶ An other demonstration after Pelitarius.
                  Suppose that there be a circle BCD, whose

centre let be E:
                     
                        An other demonstration after Pelitarius.
                      and take a point without it, namely, A: And frō the poynt A drawe two right lines ABD, and AC: of which let ABD cut the circle in the poynt B, &amp; let the other fall vpon it. And let that which is contained vnder the lines AD and AB, be equall to the square of the line AC. Then I say, that the line AC toucheth the circle. For first if the line ABD do passe by the centre, draw the right line CE. And (by the 6. of the second) that which is contayned vnder the lines AD and AB together with the square of the line EB, that is, with the square of the line EC (for the lines EB and EC are equall) is equall to the square of the line AE. But that which is contained vnder the lines AD and AB, is supposed to be equall to the square of the line AC: Wherefore the square of the line AC together with the square of the line CE, is equall to the square of the line AE. Wherefore (by the last of the first) the angle at the point C is a right angle. Wherfore (by the 18. of this boke) the line AC toucheth the circle.
                  
                     But if the line ABD doo not passe by the centre, drawe from the point A the line AD, in which let be the centre E. And forasmuch as that which is contained vnder this whole line and his outward part, is equall to that which is contained vnder the lines AD and AB by the first Corollary before put, therefore the same is equall to the square of the line AC, wherefore the angle ECA is a right angle as hath before bene proued in the first part of this Proposition. And therfore the line AC toucheth the circle: Which was required to be proued.

                  The argument of this booke.
                how one right lined figure may be inscribed within an other right lined figure, and how a right lined figure may be circumscribed about an other right lined figure, in such as may be inscribed and circumscribed within or about the other. For all right lined figures cannot so be inscribed or circumscribed within or about the other. Also it teacheth how a triangle, a square, and certayne other rectiline figures being regular may be inscribed within a circle. Also how they may be circumscribed about a circle. Likewise how a circle may be inscribed within them. And how it may be circumscribed about them. And because the maner of entreatie in this booke is diuers from the entreaty of the former bookes, he vseth in this other wordes and termes then he vsed in them. The definitions of which in order here after follow.
            
               Definitions.
               
                  A rectiline figure is sayd to be inscribed in a rectiline figure,
                        First definition.
                      when euery one of the angles of the inscribed figure toucheth euery one of the sides of the figure wherin it is inscribed.
                  As the triangle ABC is inscribed in the triangle DEF, because that euery angle of the triangle inscribed, namely, the triangle ABC toucheth euery side of the triangle within which it is described, namely, of the triangle DEF. As the angle CAB toucheth

the side ED the angle ABC toucheth the side DF, and the angle ACB toucheth the side EF. So likewise the square ABCD is said to be inscribed within the square EFGH. for euery angle of it toucheth some one side of the other. So also the Pentagon or fiue angled figure ABCDE is inscribed within the Pentagon or fiue angled figure FGHIK

                  Likewise a rectiline figure is said to be circumscribed about a rectiline figure,
                        Second definition.
                      when euery one of the sides of the figure circumscribed, toucheth euery one of the angles of the figure about which it is circumscribed.
                  As in the former descriptions the triangle DEF is said to be circumscribed about the triangle ABC, for that euery side of the figure circumscribed, namely, of the triangle DEF toucheth euery angle of the figure wherabout it is circumscribed. As the side DF of the triangle DEF circumscribed, toucheth the angle ABC of the triangle ABC about which it is circumscribed: and the side EF toucheth the angle BCA, and the side CD toucheth the angle CAB. Likewise vnderstand you of the square EFGH which is circumscribed about the square ABCD: for euery side of the one toucheth some one side of the other. Euē so by the same reason the Pentagon FGHIK is circumscribed about the Pentagon ABCDE, as you see in the figure on the other side. And thus may you of other

                           eth only to regular figures.
                     By these two definitions it is manifest, that the inscription and circumscription of rectiline figures here spoken of, pertayne to such rectiline figures onely, which haue equall sides and equall angles, which are commonly called regular. It is also to be noted that rectiline figures only of one kinde or forme can be inscribed or circumscribed the one within or about the other. As a triangle within or about a triangle: A square within or about a square: and so a Pentagon within or about a Pentagō, &amp; likewise of others of one forme. But a triangle can not be inscribed or circumscribed within or aboute a square: nor a square within or about a Pentagon. And so of others of diuers kyndes. For euery playne rectiline figure hath so many angles as it hath sides. Wherfore the figure inscrided must haue so many angles as the figure in which it is inscribed hath sides: and the angles of the one (as is sayd) must touche the sides of the other. And contrariwise in circumscription of figures, the sides of the figure circumscribed must touch the angles of the figure about which it is circumscribed.
               
               
                  
                     
                        The third definition.
                     A rectiline figure is sayd to be inscribed in a circle, when euery one of the angles of the inscribed figure toucheth the circumference of the circle.
                  A circle by reason of his vniforme and regular distance which it hath from the centre to the circumference may easily touche all the angles of any regular rectiline figure within it: and also all the sides of any figure without it. And therfore any regular rectiline figure may be inscribed within it, and also be circumscribed about it. And agayne a circle may be both inscribed within any regular rectiline figure, and also be circumscribed about it.
                  As the triangle ABC is inscribed in the circle ABC

                      for that euery angle toucheth some one pointe of the circumference of the circle. As the angle CAB of the triangle ABC toucheth the point A of the circumference of the circle. And the angle ABC
                     
of the triangle toucheth the pointe B of the circumference

of the circle. And also the angle ACB of the tri

In like manner the square ADEF is inscribed in the same circle ABC: for that euery angle of the square inscribed, toucheth some one poynte of the circle in which it is inscribed. And so imagine you of rectilined figures.
               
               
                  A circle is sayd to be circumscribed about a rectiline figure,

                      whē the circumference of the circle toucheth euery one of the angles of the figure about which it is circumscribed.
                  As in the former example of the third definition. The circle ADEF is circumscribed about the triangle ABC, because the circumference of the circle which is circumscribed toucheth euery angle of the triangle about which it is circumscribed
                        •
                      namely, the angles CAB, ABC, and BCA. Likewise the same circle ADEF is circumscribed about the square ADEF by the same definition as you may see.

                      namely the side EF in the point B, and the side GF in the pointe C, and the side GE in the point D. Likewise by the same reason the same circle is inscribed within the square HIKL. And so may you iudge of other rectiline figures.
               
               
                  A rectilined figure is said to be circumscribed about a circle,
                        The sixt deuition.
                      when euery one of the sides of the figure circumscribed toucheth the circumference of the circle.
                  As in the former figure of the fift definition, the triangle EFG is circumscribed about the circle ABCD, for that euery side of the same triangle beyng circumscribed toucheth the circumference of the circle, about which it is circumscribed. As the side EG of the triangle EFG toucheth the circumference of the circle in the point D: and the side EF toucheth it in the point B: and the side GF in the point C. Likewise also the square HIKL is circumscribed about the circle ABCD, for euery one of his sides toucheth the circumference of the circle, namely, in the pointes A, B, C, D. And thus consider of all other regular right lined figures (for of them onely are vnderstanded these definitions) to be circumscribed about a circle, or to be inscribed within a circle: or of a circle to be circumscribed or inscribed about or within any of them.

But the angle HAC is equall to the angle DEF. Wherfore the angle ABC is equall to the angle DEF. And by the same reason, the angle ACB is equall to the angle DFE. Wherefore the angle remayning, BAC, is equall vnto the angle remayning, EDF. Wherefore the triangle ABC is equiangle vnto the triangle DEF. And it is described in the circle geuen ABC. Wherefore in a circle geuen, is described a triangle equiangle vnto a triangle geuen: which was required to be done.

Extend the line EF on ech side to the poyntes G and H. And (by the first of the third) take the centre of the circle ABC, and let the same be the point K. And then draw a right line KB. And (by the 23. of the first) vnto the right line KB, and vnto the point in it K, make an angle BKA equall vnto the angle DEG, and likewise make the angle BKC equall vnto the angle DFH. And (by the 17. of the third) draw right lines touching the circle A, B, C, in the pointes A, B, C. And let ye same be LAM, MBN, and NCL.Demonstration. And for asmuch as the right lines LM, MN, &amp; NL, do touch the circle ABC in the pointes A, B, C, and from the centre K vnto the pointes A, B, C, are drawen right lines KA, KB, and KC, therefore the angles which are at the pointes A, B, C,

are right angles (by ye 
                  18. of the third). And for asmuch as the fower angles of the fower sided figure AMBK, are equall vnto fower right angles: whose angles KAM, &amp; KBM, are two right angles: therfore the angles remayning AKB, and AMB, are equall to two right angles. And the angles DEG, &amp; DEF, are (by the 13. of the first) equall to two right angles. Wherefore the angles AKB, and AMB, are equall vnto the angles DEG, and DEF: of which two angles the angle AKB is equall vnto the angle DEG: Wherefore the angle remayning, AMB, is equall vnto the angle remayning, DEF. In like sort may it be proued, that the angle LNM, is equall to the angle DFE. Wherfore the angle remayning MLN, is equall vnto the angle remayning EDF. Wherefore the triangle LMN, is equiangle vnto the triangle DEF: and it is described about the circle ABC. Wherefore about a circle geuen is described a triangle equiangle vnto a triangle geuen: which was required to be done.

Then drawe the line LM parallel to the line GH, which let touch the circle in the poynt A (which may be done by the Proposition added of the sayd Pelitarius after the 17. Proposition).

                     scribed about the circle ABC, is equiangle to the triangle DEF. For it is manifest, that it is equiangle vnto the triāgle GHK, by the proprietie of parallel lines. For the angle MTQ is equall to the angle at the poynt G of the triangle GHK (by the 29. of the first) and therefore also the angle at the poynt L, is equall to the selfe same angle at the poynt G (for the angle at the point L, is by the same 29. Proposition, equall to the angle MTQ). And by the same reason the angle at the poynt M, is equall to the angle at the poynt H of the selfe same triangle: and the angle at the poynt N, to the angle at the poynt K. Wherfore the whole triangle LMN, is equiangle to the whole triangle GHK: Wherfore also it is equiangle to the triangle DEF: which was required to be done.

And forasmuch as the angle ABD is equall to tho angle CBD, and the right angle

BED is equall vnto the right angle BFD. Now then there are two triangles EBD and FBD hauing two angles equall to two angles, and one side equall to one side, namely, BD which is common to them both, and subtendeth one of the equall angles. Wherfore (by the 26. of the first) the rest of the sides are equall vnto the rest of the sides. Wherfore the line DE is equall vnto the line DF: and by the same reason also the

Wherfore these three right lines DE, DF, &amp;

DG, are equall the one to the other (by the first common sentence). Wherefore making the centre the point D, and the space DE, or DF, or DG, describe a circle and it will passe through the pointes E, F, G, and will touch ye right lines AB, BC, and CA. For the angles made at the pointes E, F, G, are right angles. For if ye circle cut those right lines, then frō the end of the diameter of the circle shall be drawen a right line making two right angles,Demonstration leading to an impossibilitie. &amp; falling within the circle: which is impossible, as it was manifest (by the 16. of the third). Wherefore the circle described, D being the centre therof, and the space therof being either DE, or DF, or DG, cutteth not these right lines AB, BC, &amp; CA.

But when it falleth vpon the right line BC the angle BAC being in a semicircle is a right angle.

For if the circle do cut the right lines AB, BC, CD, and DA, then the line which is drawen by the ende of the diameter of the circle making right angles should fall within the circle, which is impossible (by the 16. of the third) Wherfore the centre being the poynt G and the space beyng GE, or GF, or GH, or GK if a circle be described, it shall not cut the rig

touches be E, F, G, H. And drawing these two diameters EG, and FH, and these right lines EF, FG, GH, and HB, there shall be inscribed in the circle a square EFGH (by the sixt of this booke). Then I say, that the square ABCD, is double to the square EFGH. For forasmuch as the side AB of the greater square, is (by the 34. of the first) equall to FH, which is the diameter of the lesse square: but the square of FH is double to the square whose diameter it is, namely, to the square EFGH (by the 47. of the first). Wherefore also the square of AB which is ABCD, is double to the square EFGH: which was required to be proued.
                  Thys may also be demonstrated by the equalite of the triangles and squares contayned in the great squares.

                  And forasmuch as the rectangle figure contained vnder the lines AB and BC is equall to the square which is made of the line AC: (For that is by supposition) But the line AC is equall vnto the line BD. Wherfore that which is contayned vnder the lines AB and BC is equall to the square which is made of the line BD. And forasmuch as without the circle ACDF is taken a poynt B, and from B vnto the circle ACDF are drawen two right lines BCA, and BD, in such sort that the one of them cutteth the circle, and the other endeth at the circumference, and that which is contained vnder the lines AB and BC is equall to the square which is made of the line BD, therfore (by the 17. of the third) the line BD toucheth the circle ACDF. And forasmuch as the line BD toucheth in the point D, and from D where the touche is, is drawen a right line DC, therefore (by the 32. of the same) the angle BDC is equall vnto the angle DAC, which is in ye alternate segment of ye circle. And forasmuch as ye angle BDC is equal vnto ye angle DAC, put the angle CDA common vnto thē both. Wherfore ye whole angle BDA is equal to these two angles CDA, &amp; DAC. But vnto ye angles CDA, &amp; DAC is equall the outward angle BCD (by the 32. of the 1.) Wherfore ye angle BDA is equal vnto ye angle BCD. But ye angle BDA is (by ye
                   5. of the first) equall vnto the angle CBD, for (by the 15. definition of y• first) the side AD is equall vnto the side AB: wherfore (by the 1. common sentence) the angle DBA is equall vnto the angle BCD. Wherefore these three angles BDA, DBA, and BCD are equall the one to the other. And forasmuch as the angle DBC is equall vnto the angle BCD, the side therfore BD is equall vnto the side DC. But the line BD is by supposition equall vnto the lyne CA.

               Thys also is to be noted, that the line AC is the side of an equilater Pentagon to be inscribed in the circle ACD. For by the latter construction it is manifest, that the three arkes AC, CD, and DE, of the lesse circle, are equall. And forasmuch as by the same it is manifest that the two lines AD and AE are equall, the arke also AE shall be equall to the arke AD (by the 20. of the third). Wherefore their halfes also are equall. If therefore the arke AE be (by the 30. of the third) deuided into two equall partes, the whole circūference ACDEA shall be deuided into fiue equall arkes.

                     Vpon a right line geuen being finite, to describe an equilater and equiangle Pentagon figure.
                  
                  Suppose that the right line geuen be AB, vpon which it is required to describe an equilater and equiangle Pentagon. Vpon the line AB describe (by the 23. and 32. of the first) an Isosceles triangle ABC equiangle to the Isosceles triangle described by the former Proposition: namely, let the angles CAB and CBA, at the base AB, be equall to the two angles ABD and ADB in the former construction: so that eyther of them shall be two fift partes of two right angles, and the angle at the toppe, namely, the angle C, shall be one fift part. Then deuide the angle C into two equall parte

and the line AD vpon the side BC. And draw a line from the poynt D to the poynt B. And for asmuch as in the triangle ACD the two angles A and C are equall, therfore (by the 6. of the first) the two sides AD and CD are equall. Againe forasmuch as the two sides CB and CD of the triangle CBD, are equall to the two sides CA and CD of the triangle ACD, and the angle C of the one, is equall to the angle C of the other (by construction) therefore (by the 4. of the first) the base DB is equall to the base DA, and so is equall to the line DC. Wherefore (by the 9. of the third) the poynt D shall be the centre of the circle described about the triangle ABC. Describe the sayd circle and let it be ABECF. Now then the angle ADB is double to the angle ACD (by the 20. of the third). Wherefore the angle ADB maketh two fift partes of two right angles, that is, one fift part of foure right angles. And for asmuch as the space about the centre D is equall to foure right angles, then if the sayd space be deuided into fiue angles equall to the angle ADB, namely, into fine fift partes, by drawing the right lines DE &amp; DF, which with the lines DA, DB, and DC, will cause the sayd space to be deuided into fiue equall partes, and if also there be drawen these right lines AF, FC, CE, and EB

               SVppose that the circle geuen be ABCDE.Construction. It is required in the circle ABCDE to inscribe a figure of fiue angles of equall sides and of equall angles. Take (by the proposition going before) an Isosceles triangle FGH hauing

eyther of the angles at ye base GH double to the other angle, namely, vnto the angle F. And (by the 2. of ye fourth) in the circle ABCDE inscribe a triangle ACD equiangle vnto the triangle FGH. So that let the angle CAD be equall to the angle F, &amp; the angle ACD vnto the angle G, and likewise the angle CDA to the angle H. Wherefore eyther of these angles ACD, and CDA is double to the angle CAD. Deuide (by the 9. of the first) either of these angles ACD, and CDA into two equall partes by the right lines CE and DB. and draw right lines from A to B, from B to C, from C to D, from D to E, and from E to A.Demonstration. And forasmuch as either of these angles ACD, and CDA is double to the angle CAD: and they are deuided into two equall partes by the right lines CE and DB, therfore the fiue angles DAC, ACE, ECD, CDB, and BDA are equall the one to the other. But equall angles (by the 26. of the third) subtend equall circumferences. Wherfore the fiue circumferences AB, BC, CD, DE, and EA are equall the one to ye other. And (by ye 
                  29, of ye same) vnto equall circumferences are subtēded equal right lines: wherfore ye fiue right lines AB, BC, CD, DE, &amp; EA are equal ye one to the other. Wherfore ye figure ABCDE hauing fiue angles is equilater.
               Now also I say that it is equiangle. For forasmuch as the circumference AB

is equall to the circumference DE, put the circumference BCD common vnto them both. Wherfore the whole circumference ABCD is equall to the whole circumference EDCB: and vpon the circumference ABCD consisteth the angle AED,

and vppon the circumference EDCB, consisteth the angle BAE. Wherefore the angle BAE is equall to ye angle AED (by the 27. of the third) and by the same reason euery one of these angles ABC, and BCD, and CDE, is equall to euery one of these angles BAE and AED. Wherfore the fiue angled figure ABCDE, is equiangle, and it is proued, that is also equilater. Wherfore in a circle geuen is described a figure of fiue angles equilater and equiangle: which was required to be done.
               
                  ¶ An other way to do the same after Pelitarius.

                        An other way to do the same after Pelitarius.
                      And let the

                     uen be ABC: the cē
                     tre

wherof let be K. And vpon the centre K describe the angle BKC equall to one of the angles E or F of the triangle DEF. And draw a right line from B to C. Then I say, that the line BC is the side of the Pentagon figure to be inscribed in the circle ABC. Deuide the angle BKC into two equall partes by drawing the diameter AKL. And draw these right lines BA &amp; AC. Now thē it is manifest (by the 20. of the third) that the angle

                     BKC is double to the whole angle BAC. Wherefore the whole angle BAC is equall to the angle D, vnto which angle, the angle BKC also is double. And forasmuch as in the triangle ABK the two angles A and B are (by the 5. of the first) equall (for the lines KA and KB are drawen from the centre) therefore (by the 32. of the same) the outward angle BKL is double to eyther of the inward angles KAB and KBA. And by the same reason, the angle CKL is double to eyther of the angles KAC and KCA. Wherfore forasmuch as the two angles at the poynt K are equall, the two angles A and B of the triangle ABK, are equall to the two angles A and C of the triangle ACK, the one to the other: and therefore (by the 26. of the first) the two bases AB and AC are equall. Wherefore ABC is an Isosceles triangle. And forasmuch as the whole angle BAC is equall to the angle D, the two angles remayning ABC and ACB, shall (by the 32. of the first) be equall to the two angles remayning E &amp; F. Wherefore the triangle ABC is equiangle to the triangle DEF. And now you may procede in the demonstration as you did in the former, imagining first the lines BG and CH to be drawen.
                  Here it is a pleasant thing to beholde the varietie of triangles: for in the triangle ABC either of the angles at the point A is one fift part of a right angle. Wherby is produced the side of a ten angled figure to be inscribed in the selfsame circle: Which is manifest if we imagine the lines BL and LC to be drawen. For the arke BC is deuided into two equall partes in the poynt L (by the 26. of the third). So then by the inscription of an equilater triangle, is knowen how to inscribe an Hexagon figure, namely, by deuiding ech of the arkes subtended vnder the sides of the triangle into two equall partes. And so alwayes by the simple number of the side, is knowen the double thereof: as by a square is knowen an eight angled figure: and by an eight angled figure a sixtene angled figure. And so continually in the rest.
                  
                     Pelitarius teacheth yet an other way how to inscribe a Pentagon.
                        An other way also after Pelitarius.
                      Take the same circle that was before, namely, ABC, and the same triangle also DEF
                     
                        •
                      And (by the 17. of the third) draw the line MAN touching the circle in the poynt A. And vpon the line AM and to the poynt A, describe (by the 23. of the first) the angle MAB equall to one of these two angles E or F (eyther of which, as it is manifest, is lesse then a right angle) by drawing the right line AB: which let out the circumference in the poynt B. Agayne, vpon the line AN and to the poynt in it A, describe the angle NAC equall to the angle MAB, by drawing the right line AC: which let cut the circumference in the poynt C. And draw a right line from B to C. Then I say, that BC is the side of a Pentagon figure to be inscribed in the circle ABC. Which is manifest, if we deuide the arke AB into two equall partes in the poynt H, and draw these right lines AH and BH, and if also we deuide the arke AC into two equall partes in the poynt G, and draw these right lines AG and CG. For taking the quadrangle figure ABCG, it is manifest (by the 32. of the third) that the angle ABC is equall to the alternate angle NAC, and therfore is equall to the angle E. Likewise taking the quadrangle figure ACBH, the angle ACB shall be equall to the alternate angle MAB, and therefore is equall to the angle F. Wherefore (by the 32. of the first) as before, the triangle ABC is equiangle to the triangle DEF: And now may you procede in the demonstration as you did in the former.

let the same be GH, HK, KL, LM, and MG. And (by the 1. of the third) take the centre of the circle &amp; let the same be F.

And by the same reason also the square which is made of FK is equall to the squares which are made of FB and BK. Wherefore the squares which are made of FC and CK are equall to the squares which are made of FB and BK, of which the square which is made of FC is equall to the square which is made of FB. Wherfore the square which is made of CK is equall to the square which is made of BK. Wherfore the line BK is equall vnto the line CK. And forasmuch as FB is equall vnto FC, and FK is common to them both, therfore these two BF and FK are equall to these two CF &amp; FK. And the base BK is equall vnto the base CK. Wherfore (by the 8. of the first) the angle BFK is equall vnto the angle KFC: and the angle BKF to the angle FKC. Wherefore the angle BFC is double to the angle KFC. And the angle BKC is double to the angle FKC. And by the same reason the angle CFD is double to the angle CFL, and the angle DLC is double to the angle FLC. And forasmuch as the circumference BC is equall vnto the circumference

CD, therfore (by the 27. of the third) the angle BFC is equall to the angle CFD. And the angle BFC is double to the angle KFC, and the angle DFC is double to the angle LFC, wherfore the angle KFC is equall vnto the angle LFC. Now then there are two triangles FKC, and FLC, hauing two angles equall to two angles, and one side equall to one side, namely, FC, which is common to them both. Wherfore (by the 26. of the third, the other sides remayning are equall vnto the sides remayning, and the angle remayning vnto the angle remayning. Wherfore the right line KC is equall to the right line CL, and the angle FKC to the angle FLC. And forasmuch as KC is equall to CL: therefore KL is double to KC, and by the same reason also may it be proued that HK is double to BK. And forasmuch as it is proued that BK is equall vnto KC, and KL is double to KC, and HK double to BK, therfore HK is equall vnto KL. In like sort may we proue yt euery one of these lines HG, GM, &amp; ML is equall vnto either of these lines HK and KL. Wherefore the fiue angled figure GHKLM is of equall sides. I say also that it is of equall angles. For forasmuch as the angle FKC is equall vnto the angle FLC, and it is proued that the angle HKL is double to the angle FKC, and the angle KLM is double to the angle FLC, therefore the angle HKL is equall to the angle KLM. In like sort may it be proued that euery one of these angles KHG, HGM, and GML, is equall to either of these angles HKL, and KLM. Wherefore the fiue angles GHK, HKL, KLM, LMG, and MGH are equall the one to the other. Wherfore the fiue angled figure GHKLM is equiangle, and it is also proued that it is equilater, and it is described about the circle ABCDE: which was required to be done.

And so likewyse draw these lines HK, KL, and LM, parallel to ech of these sides BC, CD, and DE, and touching the circle. And for asmuch as the lines FG and FH fall vpon the two parallel lines AB and GH,
                        Demonstration.
                      the two angles FGH, &amp; FHG, are equall to the two angles FAB and FBA, the one to the other (by the 29. of the first). Wherefore (by the sixt of the same) the two lines FG and FH are equall. And by the same reason, the two angles FHK &amp; FKH, are equall to the two angles FGH and FHG the one to the other: and the line FK is equall to the line FH, and therefore is equall to the line FG. And forasmuch as the angles at the poynt F are equall, therefore (by the 4. of the first) the base HK is equall to the base GH. In like sort may we proue, that the three lines FK, FL, and FM, are equall to the two lines FG and FH. And also that the two bases KL and LM, are equall to the two bases GH and HK: and that the angles which they make with the lines FK, FL, and FM, are equall the one to the other. Now then draw the fift line MG: which shall be equall to

the foure former lines (by the 4. of the first) for that as we haue proued, the two lines FG &amp; FM, are equall, &amp; the angle GFM is equall to euery one of the angles at the poynt F. Thys line also MG toucheth the circle. For vnto the point where the line LM toucheth the circle whiche let be N, drawe the lyne FN.

And so is the line ML deuided equally in the poynt N. And forasmuch as the three sides of the triangle FGP are equall to the three sides of the triangle FMP, the angle P of the one shal be equall to the angle P of the other (by the 8. of the first). Wherfore either of thē is a right angle (by the 13. of the same). And forasmuch as the two angles FMP and FPM of the triangle FMP, are equall to the two angles FMN &amp; FNM of the triangle FMN, and the side FM is common to them both, therefore the line FP is equall to the line FN. But the line FN is drawen from the centre to the circumference. Wherefore also the line FP is drawen from the centre to the circumference.

I say also that it is equiangle. For euery angle of the Hexagon figure is set vpon equall arkes, namely, vpon foure such partes of the circūference wherof the whole circumference cōtayneth sixe. Wherfore the angles of the Hexagon figure are equall the one to the other (by the 27. of the third). Wherefore in the circle geuen ABCDEF is inscribed an equilater and equiangle Hexagon figure: which was required to be done.

                      &amp; it is also equall to the line FB, therfore

the triangle AFB is equilater, and by the 5. of the first equiangle. Now then vpon the centre F describe the angle BFC equall to the angle AF

                        , or to the angle FBA (which is all one) by drawing the right line FC. And draw a line from B to C. And for asmuch as the angle AFB is the third part of two

right angles by the 5. and 32. of the first, the angle BFC also shall be the third part of two right angles. Wherefore either of the two angles remaining FBC and FCB, for asmuch as they are equall by the 5. of the first, shall be two third partes of two right angles (by the 32. of the same). Or (by the 4. of the first) forasmuch as the angle BFC is equall to the angle FBA, and the two sides FB and FC are equall to the two sides AB and BF, the base BC shall be equall to the base BF, and therefore is equall to the line FC. Wherefore the triangle FBC is equilater and equiangle. Lastly make the angle CFD equall to eyther of the angles at the poynt F, by drawing the line FD. And draw a line from C to D. Now then by the former reason the triangle FCD shall be equilater and equiangle. And for asmuch as the three angles at the point F are equall to two right angles (for ech of them is the third part of two right angles) therefore (by the 14. of the first) AD is one right line: and for that cause is the diameter of the circle. Wherefore if the other semicircle AFD be deuided into so many equall partes as the semicircle ABCD is deuided into, it shall comprehend so many equall lines subtended vnto it. Wherefore the line AB is the side of an equilater Hexagon figure to be inscribed in the circle: which Hexagon figure also shall be equiangle: For the halfe of the whole angle B is equall to the halfe of the whole angle C: which was required to be done.
                  Now then if we draw from the centre F a perpendicular line vnto AD, which let be FE, and draw also these right lines BE and CE: there shall be described a triangle BEC whose angle E which is at the toppe shall be the 6. part of two right angles by the 20. of the third. For the angle BFC is double vnto it. And either of the two angles at the base, namely, the angles EBC, and ECB is dupla sesquialter to the angle E: that is, eyther of them contayneth the angle E twise and halfe the angle E. And by this reason was found out the side of an Hexagon figure.
                  
                     Correlary.
                     Hereby it is manifest,

that the side of an Hexagon figure described in a circle is equall to a right line drawen frō the cētre of the said circle vnto the circumference. And if by the pointes A, B, C, D, E, F, be

drawen right lines touching the circle, then shall there be described about the circle an Hexagon figure equilater and equiangle, which may be demonstrated by that which hath bene spoken of the describing of a Pentagon about a circle. And moreouer by those thinges which haue ben spokē of Pentagons we may in a Hexagon geuen either describe or circumscribe a circle: which was required to be done.

               SVppose that the circle geuen be ABCD. It is required in the circle ABCD to describe a figure of fiftene angles consisting of equall sides and of equall angles. Describe in the circle ABCD the sides of an equilater triangle, and let the same be AC, and in ye arke AC describe the side of an equilater pentagon and let the same be AB.Construction. Now then of such equall partes wherof the whole circle ABCD containeth fiftene, of such partes I say, the circumference ABC being the third parte of the circle shall contayne fiue. And the

circumference AB being the fift part of a circle shall contain thre, wherefore the residue BC shall containe two. Deuide (by the 30. of the first) the arke BC into two equall partes in the point E.Demonstration. Wherfore either of these circumferences BE &amp; EC is the fiftene part of the circle ABCD. If therfore there be drawn right

lines from B to E, and from E to C, and then beginning at the point B or at the point C there be applied into the circle ABCD right lines equall vnto EB or EC, and so continuing till ye come to the point C if you began at B, or to ye point B if you began at C, and there shall be described in the circle ABCD a figure of fiftene angles equilater and equiangle: which was required to be done. And in like sort as in a pentagon, if by the pointes where the circle is deuided, be drawen right lines touching the circle in the said pointes, there shall be described about ye circle a figure of fiftene angles equilater &amp; equiangle. And in like sort by ye selfe same obseruations that were in Pentagons, we may in a figure of fiftene angles geuen being equilater and equiangle either inscribe, or circumscribe a circle.

                  As for example. Suppose that into the circle ABE be applyed the side of an equilater and equiangle Hexagon figure (by the 15. of thys booke) which let be AB: and likewise the side of a Pentagon (by the 11. of this booke) which let be AC: and the side of a square (by the 6. of thys booke) which let be AD: and the side of an equilater triangle (by the 2. of this booke) which let be AE. Then I say, that the excesse of the arke AD aboue the arke AB, which excesse is the arke BD, contayneth so many sides of the Poligonon figure to be inscribed, of how many vnities the denominator of the Hexagon AB, which is sixe, excedeth the denominator of the square AD, which is foure. And forasmuch as that excesse it two vnities,

therfore in BD there shall be two sides. And the denominator of the Poligonon figure which is to be inscribed shall be produced of the multiplication of the denominators of the foresayd Poligonon figures, namely, of the multiplication of 6. into 4. which maketh 24. which number is the denominator of the Poligonon figure, whose two sides shall subtend the arke BD. For of such equall partes wherof the whole circumference cōtayneth 24, of such partes I say, the circumference AB contayneth 4, and the circumference AD contayneth 6. Wherefore if from AD which subtendeth 6. partes be taken away 4. which AB subtendeth, there shall remayne vnto BD two of such partes of which the whole contayneth 24. Wherfore of an Hexagon and a square is made a Poligonon figure of 24. sides. Likewyse of the Hexagon AB and of the Pentagon AC shall be made a Poligonon figure of 30.

sides, one of whose sides shall subtend the arke BC. For the denomination of AB which is 6. excedeth the denomination of AC which is 5. onely by vnitie. So also forasmuch as the denomination of AB which is 6. excedeth the denomination of AE which is 3. by 3. therefore the arke BE shall contayne 3. sides of a Poligonon figure of .18. sides. And obseruing thys selfe same methode and order, a man may finde out infinite sides of a Poligonon figure.

            ¶The fifth booke of Euclides Elementes.
            THIS FIFTH BOOKE of Euclide is of very great commoditie and vse in all Geometry,
                  The argument of this fift booke.
                and much diligence ought to be bestowed therin. It ought of all other to be throughly and most perfectly and readily knowne. For nothyng in the bookes followyng can be vnderstand without it: the knowledge of them all depende of it. And not onely they and other writinges of Geometry, but all other Sciences also and artes: as Musike, Astronomy, Perspectiue, Arithmetique, the arte of accomptes and reckoning, with other such like. This booke therefore is as it were a chiefe treasure, and a peculiar iuell much to be accompted of. It entreateth of proportion and Analogie, or proportionalitie, which pertayneth not onely vnto lines, figures, and bodies in Geometry: but also vnto soundes &amp; voyces, of which Musike entreateth, as witnesseth Boetius and others which write of Musike. Also the whole arte of Astronomy teacheth to measure proportions of tymes and mouinges. Archimides and Iordan with other, writing of waightes, affirme, that there is proportion betwene waight and waight, and also betwene place &amp; place. Ye see therefore how large is the vse of this fift booke. Wherfore the definitions also thereof are common, although hereof Euclide they be accommodate and applied onely to Geometry. The first author of this booke was as it is affirmed of many, one Eudoxus who was Platos scholer,

                        The first definition.
                     A parte is a lesse magnitude in respect of a greater magnitude, when the lesse measureth the greater.
                  As in the other bookes before, so in this, the author first setteth orderly the definitions and declarations of such termes and wordes which are necessarily required to the entreatie of the subiect and matter therof, which is proportion and comparison of proportions or proportionalitie. And first he sheweth what a parte is. Here is to be considered that all the definitions of this fifth booke be general to Geometry and Arithmetique, and are true in both artes, euen as proportion and proportionalitie are common to them both, and chiefly appertayne to number, neither can they aptly be applied to matter of Geometry, but in respect of number and by number. Yet in this booke, and in these definitions here set, Euclide semeth to speake of them onely Geometrically, as they are applied to quantitie continuall, as to lines, superficieces, and bodies: for that he yet continueth in Geometry. I wil notwithstanding for facilitie and farther helpe of the reader, declare thē both by example in number, and also in lynes.
                  For the clearer vnderstandyng of a parte, it is to be noted,
                        A part taken two maner of wayes.
                      that a part is taken in the Mathematicall Sciences two maner of wayes.

                      no. The second way,
                        The second way.
                      a part is onely that lesse quantitie in respect of the greater, which measureth the greater. A lesse quantitie is sayd to measure or number a greater quantitie,
                        How a lesse quantity is sayd to measure a greater.
                      when it, beyng oftentymes taken, maketh precisely the greater quantitie without more or lesse, or beyng as oftentymes taken from the greater as it may, there remayneth nothyng. As suppose the line AB to contayne 3. and the lyne CD to contayne 9. thē doth the line AB measure the line

CD: for that if it be take certayne times, namely, 3. tymes, it maketh precisely the lyne CD, that is 9. without more or lesse. Agayne if the sayd lesse lyne AB be taken from the greater CD, as often as it may be, namely, 3. tymes, there shall remayne nothing of the greater. So the nū
                     ber 3. is sayde to measure 12. for that beyng taken certayne tymes, namely, foure tymes, it maketh iust 12. the greater quantitie: and also beyng taken from 12. as often as it may, namely, 4. tymes, there shall remayne nothyng. And in this meaning and signification doth Euclide vndoubtedly here in this define a part:
                        In what significatiō Euclide here taketh a part.
                      saying, that it is a lesse magnitude in comparison of a greater, when the lesse measureth the greater. As the lyne AB before set, contayning 3. is a lesse quantitie in comparison of the lyne CD which containeth 9. and also measureth it. For it beyng certayne tymes taken, namely, 3. tymes, precisely maketh it, or taken from it as often as it may, there remayneth nothyng. Wherfore by this definition the lyne AB is a part of the lyne CD. Likewise in numbers, the number 5. is a part of the number 15. for it is a lesse number or quantitie compared to the greater, and also it measureth the greater: for beyng taken certayne tymes, namely, 3. tymes, it maketh 15. And this kynde of part is called commonly pars metiens or mensurans,

                        Pars aliquota.
                      that is an aliquote part. And this kynde of parte is commonly vsed in Arithmetique.

                        The other kinde of part.
                      is any lesse quantitie in comparison of a greater, whether it be in number or magnitude, and whether it measure or no. As suppose the line AB to be 17. and let it be deuided into two partes in the poynt C, namely, into the line AC, &amp; the

line CB, and let the lyne AC the greater part containe 12. and let the line BC the lesse part contayne 5. Now eyther of these lines by this definition is a part of the whole lyne AB. For eyther of them is a lesse magnitude or quātity in cōparisō of the whole lyne AB: but neither of thē measureth the whole line AB: for the lesse lyne CB contayning 5. taken as oftē as ye list, will neuer make precisely AB which contayneth 17. If ye take it 3. tymes it maketh only 15. so lacketh it 2. of 17. which is to litle. If ye take it 4. times, so maketh it 20. thē are there thre to much, so it neuer maketh precisely 17. but either to much or to litle. Likewise the other part AC measureth not the whole lyne AB: for takē once, it maketh but 12. which is lesse then 17. and taken twise, it maketh 24. which are more then 17. by 
                        •
                     . So it neuer precisely maketh by takyng therof the whole AB, but either more or lesse. And this kynde of part they commonly call pars constituens, or componens:
                        Pars constit

                      Because that it with some other part or partes, maketh the whole. As the lyne CB together with the line AC maketh the whole lyne AB. Of the barbarous it is called pars aliquanta.

                      in the beginnyng of his booke, in the definition of a part, when he saith: Euery

lesse number compared to a greater, is sayd to be a part of the greater, whether the lesse measure the greater, or measure it not.
                  
               
               
                  Multiplex is a greater magnitude in respect of the lesse, when the lesse measureth the greater.
                        The second definition.
                     
                  
                  As the line CD before set in the first example, is multiplex to the lyne AB. For that CD a lyne contayning 9. is the greater magnitude, and is compared to the lesse, namely, to the lyne AB contayning 3. and also the lesse lyne AB measureth the greater line CD: for taken 3. tymes,

it maketh it, as was aboue sayde. So in numbers 12. is multiplex to 3: for 12 is the greater number, and is compared to the lesse, namely, to 3. which 3. also measureth it:
                        Numbers very necessary for the vnderstanding of this booke and the other bookes following.
                      for 3 taken 4 tymes maketh 12. By this worde multiplex which is a terme proper to Arithmetike and number, it is easy to consider that there can be no exact knowledge of proportion and proportionalitie, and so of this fifth booke wyth all the other bookes followyng, without the ayde and knowledge of numbers.

                     Euclide as in the first definition, so in this &amp; the other following, and likewise in all his Propositions of this booke, mentioneth onely magnitudes, and geueth his examples and demonstrations of lines: for that hetherto in the 4. bookes before he hath entreated of lines &amp; figures, and so cōtinueth in his sixth booke following after this, comparing figure to figure, and sides of figures to sides of figures, without mention of number at all. Notwithstanding as it is sayd they are generall to all kinde of quantitie, both discrete and continuall, namely, number and magnitude: and neede for the young reader and studient in these artes to be declared in both. For, the opening of them in numbers (in which they are first and naturally founde) geueth a great and marueilous light to their declaration in magnitudes.
                        what proportion is.
                      
                     Proportion (sayth he) is a certaine behauiour, that is, a certaine respect or comparison of two quantities of one kinde: as of one line to an other, and one figure generally to an other, and one number to an other, as touching quantitie, that is to say, that the quantitie compared,
                        Thinges compa
                              •
                           ed together this wayes.
                      is to that wherunto it is compared, eyther equall, or greater, or lesse then it. For after these three maners may thinges be compared the one to the other. But quantities of diuers kindes can not be compared together. A superficies can not be compared to a line: nor number to a body: nor a body to a line or number: for that they are not of one kinde. For example of this definition,
                        Example of this definition in magnitudes.
                      take two quantities, namely, two lines AB and CD, and compare the one to the other, namely, AB to

CD according to some certaine respect of greatnes, or lessenes, or equalitie, namely, in this example, let AB be greater then CD, &amp; containe it twise. Now thys comparison, relation, or respect of AB to CD, and generally of any one quantitie to any other, is called proportion. Likewise is

it, if AB be equall to CD, as in the second example: or if AB be lesse then CD, as in the third example. The like is it also in numbers

comparing 5. to 5. equall to equall,
                        Example therof in numbers.
                      or 6. to 3. the greater to the lesse, or 4. to 8. the lesse to the greater. So to the accomplishing of any Proportion there are required two quantities,
                        In proportion
                              •
                            two quantities required, which are called termes.
                      and also a comparing or respect of the one to the other. The quantities compared together are commonly called the Termes of the Proportion. And in this booke of Euclide, and also in other writers of Geometrie, the first Terme, namely, that which is compared is called the antecedent,
                        The i. terme called the antecedent.
                      whether it be equall, greater, or lesse then the other: And the second Terme, namely, that wherunto the comparison is made, is called the consequent.
                        The ij. terme called the consequent.
                      As in the former example, the line AB compared to the line CD is antecedent: and the line CD is consequent: And contrariwise if the line CD be compared to the line AB, then is the line CD antecedent, and the line AB consequent. Albeit in Arithmeticke Boetius and others call the terme compared Dux,
                     
                        Dux.
                      and the

                      This booke hath bene accompted of all men one of the hardest and most intricate of all Euclides bookes.
                        This booke counted the hardest of all Euclides bookes.
                      And proportion is a generall knowledge to all learninges, chiefly to the Mathematicalls. Wherefore it shall be very necessary some litle briefe instruction and induction to be here added in the beginning hereof: of the knowledge and nature of proportions and what they are, and of how many kindes: which thinges are here of Euclide supposed to be before knowen, and therefore maketh no mention so distinctly of them.
                  Ye must vnderstand that there are of proportions two generall kindes,
                        Proportion of two kindes, rational and irrational.
                      the one is called rationall, certaine, and knowen, and the other irrationall, vncertaine and vnknowen. Such magnitudes or quantities, which may be expressed by numbre, are called rationall magnitudes or quantities
                        •
                     
                     
                        Proportion rational.
                      As suppose a line, namely, the line AB to containe 5. inches, &amp; compare it to the line CD,

contayning 3. inches: these quantities ye see may be expressed by numbers, namely, by these numbers 5. and 3: and therefore are rationall, and haue the same proportion, that number hath to number, namely, that the number 5. hath to the number 3: and therefore the proportion of the one to the other, is a rationall, certaine, and knowen proportion. And generally when soeuer one number is compared to an other, or two lines or other magnitudes, both which may be expressed by number, the proportion betwene them is euer rationall, and onely the proportion of such quantities is rationall. So that in Arethmeticke all proportions are rationall,
                        In Arithmetique all proportions are rational.
                      for that therein euer one number is compared to an other.
                  There are certaine lines magnitudes or quantities which cā not be named and expressed by number, and therefore commonly are called Surd lines or magnitudes.
                        Proportion irrational.
                      As suppose the square ABCD to containe 16, then the side or roote therof, namely, the line AB containeth 4, and the diameter of the

same square, namely, the line BC shall be 
                        •
                      32, which is a surd number, and can nor be expressed by any determinate and certaine number, but onely by this maner of circumlocution Roote square of 32. Now if ye compare the line AB to the line BC, or contrariwise the line BC to the line AB, for that one of them is a surde quantitie, neither can ech of them be expressed by number (and therefore can not haue that

proportion that number hath to number) the proportion betwene them is irrationall, confused, vnknowen, vncertaine, and surd. And this kinde of proportion is found onely in magnitudes, as in lines and figures (and not in numbers) of which he of purpose entreateth in his tenth booke. Wherfore I wil here omit to speake of it, and remit it to his due place. And somewhat will I now say for the elucidation of the first kinde.
                  
                     
                        Rational proportion deuided 
                              ••
                           to two kindes.
                     Proportion rationall is deuided into two kindes, into proportion of equalitie, and into proportion of inequalitie. Proportion of equalitie is, when one quantitie is referred to an other equall vnto it selfe: as if ye compare 5 to 5, or 7 to 7, &amp; so of other. And this proportion hath great vse in the rule of Cosse.
                     
                        Proportion of equality.
                      For in it all the rules of equations tende to none other ende but to finde out and bring forth a nū
                     ber equall to the number supposed, which is to put the proportion of equalitie.
                  
                     
                        Proportion of inequality.
                     Proportion of inequalitie is, when one vnequall quantity is compared to an other, as the greater to the lesse, as 8. to 4: or 9. to 3: or the lesse to the greater as 4. to 8: or 3. to 9.

                            of the greater to the lesse.
                     Proportion of the greater to the lesse hath fiue kindes, namely, Multiplex, Superparticular, Superpartiens, Multiplex superperticular, and Multiplex superpartiens.
                  
                  Multiplex, is when the antecedent containeth in it selfe the consequent certayne times without more or lesse:
                        Multiplex.
                      as twice, thrice, foure tymes, and so farther. And this proportion hath vnder it infinite kindes. For if the antecedent contayne the consequent iustly twise, it is called dupla proportion,
                        Duple proportion.
                      as 4 to 2. If thrice tripla,
                        Triple, quadruple. Quintuple.
                      as 9. to 3. If 4. tymes quadrupla as 12. to 3. If 5. tymes quintupla as 15. to 3. And so infinitely after the same maner.
                  
                     
                        Superperticular.
                     Superperticular is, whē the antecedēt containeth the consequent only once, &amp; moreouer some one part therof as an halfe, a third, or fourth, &amp;c. This kinde also hath vnder it infinite kindes. For if the antecedent containe the consequent once and an halfe, therof it is called Sesquialtera,
                     
                        Sesquialtera.
                      as 6. to 4: if once and a third part Sesquitertia,
                     
                        Sesquitertia.
                      as 4. to 3: if once and a fourth part Sesquiquarta,
                     
                        Sesquiquarta.
                      as 5. to 4. And so in like maner infinitely.
                  
                     
                        Superpartiens.
                     Superpartiens is, whē the antecedent cōtaineth the consequent onely once, &amp; moreouer more partes then one of the same, as two thirdes, three fourthes, foure fifthes and so forth. This also hath infinite kindes vnder it. For if the antecedent containe aboue the consequent two partes, it is called Superbipartiens,
                     
                        Superbipartiens.
                      as 7. to 5. If 3. partes Supertripartiens as 7. to 4.
                        Supertripartiens.
                      If 4. partes Superquadripartiens,
                     
                        Superquadripartiens.
                      as 9. to 5. If 5. partes Superquintipartiens as 11. to 6.
                        Superquintipartiens.
                      And so forth infinitely.
                  
                     
                        Multiplex superperticular.
                     Multiplex Superperticular is when the antecedent containeth the consequent more then once, and moreouer onely one parte of the same. This kinde likewise hath infinite kindes vnder it. For if the antecedent containe the consequent twise and halfe therof, it is called dupla Sesquialtera,
                     
                        Dupla Sesquialtera.
                      as 5. to 2. If twise and a third Dupla Sesquitertia as 7. to 3.
                        Dupla sesquitertia.
                      If thrice and an halfe Tripla sesquialtera as 7. to 2.
                        Tripla sesquialtera.
                      If foure times and an halfe Quadr

                        pla Sesquialtera, as 9. to 2. And so goyng on infinitely.
                  
                     
                        Multiplex superpartiens.
                     Multiplex Superpartient, is when the antecedent contayneth the consequent more then once, and also more partes then one of the consequent. And this kinde also hath infinite kindes vnder it. For if the antecedent containe the consequent twise, and two partes ouer, it is called dupla Superbipartiens as 8. to 3.
                        Dupla superbipartiens.
                      If twice and three partes, dupla Supertripartiens as 11. to 4.
                        Dupla supertripartiens.
                      If thrice and two partes, it is named Tripla Superbipartiens as 11. to 3.
                        Tripla superbipartiens.
                      If three tymes and foure partes Treble Superquadripartiens as 31. to 9.

                      And so forth infinitely.
                  Here is to be noted that the denomination of the proportion b
                        •
                     twene any two numbers, is had by deuiding of the greater by the lesse. For the quotient o

number produced of that diuision is euen the denomination of the proportion.
                        How to kno
                              •
                            the denomination of any proportion.
                      Which in the first kinde of proportion, namely, multiplex, is euer a whole number, and in all other kindes of proportion it is a broken number.
                  As if ye will know the denomination of the proportion betwene 9 and 3. Deuide 9. by 3. so shall ye haue in the quotient 3. which is a whole number, and is the denomination of the proportion: and sheweth that the proportion betwene 9. &amp; 3. is Tripla. So the proportion betwene 12. and 3. is quadrupla, for that 12. beyng deuided by 3. the quotient is 4. and so of others in the kinde of multiplex. And although in this kinde the quotient be euer a whole number, yet properly it is referred to vnitie, and so is represented in maner of a broken number as 5/
                        •
                      and 4/
                        •
                      for vnitie is the denomination to a whole number.
                  Likewise the denomination of the proportion betwene 4 and 3 is 1. 1/
                        •
                      for that 4 deuided by 3. hath in the quotient 1 1/
                        •
                      one and a third part, of which third part, it is called sesquitercia: so the proportion betwene 7 and 6. is 1 ⅙ one and a sixt, of which fixt part it is called sesquisexta, and so of other of that kinde. Also betwene, 7 and 5 the denomination of the proportion is 1 
                        •
                     /
                        •
                      one and two fifthes, which denomination cōsisteth of two parts, namely, of the munerator and denominator of the quotient of 2. and 5: of which two fifthes it is called superbipartiens quintas: for 2 the numerator sheweth the denomination of the number of the partes, and 5. the denominator, sheweth the denominatiō, what parts they are, &amp; so of others. Also the denomination betwene 5 and 2. is 2 ½ two and a halfe, which consisteth of a whole number and a broken, of 2. the whole number it is dupla, and of the halfe, it is called sesquialtera, so is the proportion dupla sesquialtera.
                  
                  Agayne the denomination of the proportion betwene 11. and 3. is 3

                      the broken number, it is called Superbipartiens tertias, so the proportion is tripla superbipartiens tertias. Thus much hetherto touching proportion of the greater quantitie to the lesse.
                  Proportion of the lesse quantitie to the greater hath as many kindes, as that of the greater to the lesse, which kindes are in the same order:
                        Proportion of the lesse in the greater.
                      and haue also the selfe same names, but that to the names afore put ye must adde here this word sub. As comparing the greater to the lesse, it was called multiplex, superparticular, superpartient, multiplex superparticular, and multiplex superpartient, now comparing the lesse quantitie to the greater, it is called submultiplex,
                     
                        Submultiplex.
                      
                     subsuperparticular,
                     
                        Subsuperparticular.
                      
                     subsuperpartient,
                     
                        Subsuperpertient. &amp;c.
                      
                     submultiplex superparticular, and submultiplex superpartient. And so in like maner to all the inferior kindes of all sortes of proportion ye shall adde that worde sub. The examples of the former serue also here, onely transposing the termes of the proportion making the antecedent consequent, and the consequent the antecedent. As 4. to 2. is dupla proportion: so 2. to 4. is subdupla. As 9. to 3. is tripla: so is 3. to 
                        •
                     . subtripla. And as 9. to 6. is sesquialtera, so 6. to 9. is subsesquialtera. As 7. to 5. is superbipartiens quintas, so is 5. to 7. subsuperbipartiens quintas. As 5. to 2. is dupla sesquialtera, so is 2. to 5. subdupla sesquialtera. And also as 8. to 3. is dupla superbipartiens tertias, so is 3. to 8. subdupla superbipartiens tertias. And so may ye procede infinitely in all others. Thus much thought I good in this place for the ease of the beginner to be added touching proportion.
               
               
                  
                  
                     
                        The fourth definition.
                     Proportionalitie, is a similitude of proportions.
                  As in proportion are compared together two quantities, and proportion is nothing els but the respect and comparison of the one to the other, and these quantities are the termes of the proportion: so in proportionallitie are compared together two proportions. And proportionallitie is nothing els, but the respect &amp; comparison of the one of them to the other. And these two proportions are the termes of this proportionallitie. He calleth it the similitude, that is, the likenes or idemptitie of proportions:
                        Example of this definition in magnitudes.
                     
                     
As if ye wil cōpare the proportion of the line A contaynyng 2. to the line B contayning 1, to the proportion of the line C contayning 6. to the line D contayning 3, either proportion is dupla. This likenes, idemptitie, or equallitie of proportion is called proportionallitie.
                        Example thereof in numbers.
                      So in number 9. to 3. and 21. to 7. either proportion is tripla. Where note that proportions compared together, are sayd to be like the one to the other:
                        Note.
                      but magnitudes compared together, are said to be equall the one to the other.
               
               
                  
                     
                        The fifth definition.
                     Those magnitudes are sayd to haue proportion the one to the other, which being multiplied may exceede the one the other.
                  Before he shewed and defined, what proportion was, now by this definition he declareth betwene what magnitudes proportion falleth, saying: That those quantities are said to haue proportion the one to the other, which being multiplyed, may excede the one the other.
                        An example of this 
                              •
                           efinition in magnitudes.
                      As for that the

line A being multiplied by what soeuer multiplication or nūber, as taken twise, thrise, or foure, fiue, or more times, or once and halfe, or once and a third, &amp; so of any other part, or partes, may excede and become greater then the line B or contrariwise, then these two lines are said to haue proportion the one to the other. And so ye may see that betwene any two quātities of one kinde, there is a proportion. For the one remayning vnmultiplied, &amp; the other being certaine times multiplied, shall be greater then it. As 3. to 24. hath a proportion, for leauing 24. vnmultiplied, and multiplying 3. by 9, ye shall produce 27: which is greater then 24, and excedeth it. Here is to be noted, that Euclide in defining what quantities haue proportion,
                        Why Euclide in defining of Proportion vsed multiplication.
                      was compelled to vse multiplication, or els should not his definition be generall to either kinde of proportion: namely, to rationall and irrationall: to such proportion I say which may be expressed by number, and to such as cannot be expressed by any determinate number, but remaineth surd and innominable. In rationall quantities which haue one common measure, the excesse of the one aboue the other is knowen, and by it is knowen the proportion, which may be expressed by some determinate number. But in irrationall quantities which haue no cōmon measure, it is not so. For in them the excesse of the one to the other is euer vnknowen,

&amp; therefore is surd, and innominable. As betwene the side of a square and the diameter therof
                        •
                      there is vndoubtedly a proportion, for that the side certaine times multiplied may excede the diameter. Likewise betwene the diameter of a circle and the circumference therof there is certainlie, by this definition, a proportion, for that the diameter certaine times multiplied may excede the circumference of the circle: although neither of these proportions can be named &amp; expressed by number. For this cause therefore vsed Euclide this maner of defining by multiplication.
               
               
                  Magnitudes are sayd to be in one or the selfe same proportion,
                        The sixth definition.
                      the first to the second, and the third to the fourth, when the equimultiplices of the first and of the third beyng compared with the equimultiplices of the second and of the fourth, according to any multiplication: either together exceede the one the other, or together are equall the one to the other, or together are lesse the one then other.
                  In the definition last going before, he shewed what magnitudes haue proportion the one to the other, &amp; now this diffinition sheweth what magnitudes are in one and the selfe same proportion,
                        An example of this definitiin in magnitudes.
                      and how to know whether they be in one and the self same proportion, or not. It is plaine that euery proportiō hath two termes, so that when ye compare proportion to proportion, ye must of necessitie, haue 4. termes, that is, an antecedent and a consequent, to either of the proportions. As suppose A, B, C, D, to be foure magnitudes, A the first, B the second, C the third, and

D the fourth now if ye take the equimultiplices of A and C the first &amp; the third, that is, if ye multiply A and C by one and the selfe same number, as let the multiplex of A be E, and let the equimultiplex of C be F. Likewise also if ye take the equimultiplices of B and D, the second and the fourth, that is if ye multiply them by any one number, whether it be by that number wherby ye multiplied A &amp; C, or by any other number greater or lesse, as let the multiplex of B be G, and the equimultiplex of D be H: how it the equimultiplices of A and C be both greater hen the eqnimultiplices of B and D, that is if the multiplex of A be greater then the multiplex of B, and the multiplex of C be greater then the multiplex of D, or if they be both lesse then they: or both equall to them,
                        An example in numbers.
                      then are the magnitudes A, B and 
                        •
                     , D in one and the selfe same proportion.

now to see whether they be in one and the selfe same proportion or not, set them in order as in the example here written, 8 the first, 6 the second, 4 the third, and 3. the fourth. Now take the equemultiplices of 8 and 4. the first, and the third, that is, multiply them by one and the selfe

same number, suppose it be by 3. so the triple of 8 is 24. &amp; the triple of 4. is 12: likewise take the equimultiplices of 6 and 3. the second and the fourth, multiply
                        •
                     ng them likewise by one and the selfe same number, suppose it be also by 3 as before ye did, the triple of 6 is 18. and the triple of 3 is 9. Now ye see that the triple of 8 the first, namely, 24. excedeth the triple of 6. the second, namely, 18: likewise the triple of 4 the third number, namely, 12. excedeth the triple of 3. the fourth, namely, 9. Wherefore by the first part of this definition, the numbers 8 to 6. and 4 to 3. are in one and the selfe same proportiō, because that the equemultiplices of 8 and 4. the first &amp; the third, do both exceede the equimultiplices of 6 and 3. the second and the fourth.
                  
                     
                        An other example in numbers.
                     Againe, take the same numbers and try the same after this maner. Take the equimultiplices of 8. and 4. the first and the third, multiplieng eche by 3. as before ye did, so shall ye haue 24 for the triple

of 8. and 12 for the triple of 4. as ye had before. Then take the equimultiplices of 6 and 3. the second and the fourth, multipliyng them by some one number, but not by 3 as before ye did: but by 4. so for the quadruple of 6 the second number, shall ye haue 24. and for the quadruple of 3 the fourth number, ye shall haue 12. And now ye see that the equimultiplices of 8 and 4. the first and the third, namely, 24 and 12. are both equall to the multiplices of 6 and 3. the second and the fourth, namely, to 24 and 12. Wherfore the numbers geuen, are by the second part of this definition in one and the selfe same proportion, because the equimultiplices of 8 and 4 the first and the third, are both equall to the equimultiplices of 6 and 3. the seconde and the fourth.
                  
                     
                        An other example in numbers.
                     Agayne to shew the same, and for the fulnes of the diffinition, take the same numbers 8, 6, 4, 3. and take the equimultiplices of 8 and 4. the first and the thirde, multiplieng eche by 2. so haue ye 16 for the duple of 8, the first number, and 8 for the duple of 4 the third number: then take also the equimultiplices of 6 and 3, the second and the fourth, multipliyng eche by 3. so haue ye 18 for the triple of 6 the second, and 9 for the triple of 3. the

fourth number. And now ye see that the equimultiplices of 8 and 4. the first and the third, namely, 16. and 8 are both lesse then the equimultiplices of 6 and 3. the second &amp; the fourth namely 18 and 9. For 16 are lesse then 18, and 8 are lesse then 9. Wherefore by the third part of this diffinition, the numbers proposed are in one and the selfe same proportion, for that the equimultiplices of 8 and 4 the first and the third are both lesse then the equimultiplices of 4 and 3 the second and the fourth.

Yet it may so happen by some one multiplication; that the equimultiplices of the first and the third, do exceede the equimultiplices of the second and the fourth, and yet the quantities geuen shal not be in one and the selfe same proportion. As in this example here set, where the equimultiplices of 6 and 5, the first and the thirde, namely, 18. and 15. doo both exceede the equimultiplices of 4 and

3. the second and the fourth, namely, 8 and 6.

                            the equimultiplices of the second and fourth, and yet the quantities geuen are not in one and the selfe same proportion.
                      yet are not the numbers geuen in one and the selfe same proportion. For 6 hath not that proportion to 4. which 5. hath to 3. In this example 6 and 5 the first and the third were multiplied by 3. which made their equimultiplices 18 and 15. which exceede the equimultiplices of 4 and 3, the second and the fourth beyng multiplied by 2. namely, 8 and 6: but if ye shall multiply 6 and 5 the first and the thirde by 2. ye shall produce 12 and 10 for their equimultiplices, and then if ye multiply 4 and

3. the second and the fourth by 3. so shall ye produce for their equimultiplices 12 and 9. Now ye see that by this multiplication the equimultiplices of the first and the thirde doo not both exceede the equimultiplices of the second and fourth: for 12 the multiplex of 6 doth not exceede 12 the multiplex of 4. and therfore the numbers or quantities ar

                  And because this diffinition requireth all maner of multiplicatiōs to bring forth the excesses, equalities, and wantes of the antecedents aboue, to, or vnder the consequents; to auoide the tediousnes and infinite labour therof, I haue set forth a rule much to be made of and estemed, wherby ye may in any rationall proportion produce equimultiplices of the first and the third equall to the equimultiplices of the second and the fourth. The rule is this,
                        A rule to produce equimultiplices of the first and third equall to the equimultiplices of the second

                        •
                      then necessarily shalbe produced the equimultiplices of the first and the third equall to the equimultiplices of the second &amp; the fourth. As by example, take 6 to 2. and 3 to 1, which are in one &amp; the selfe same proportiō, &amp; taking these two nūbers 9 &amp; 3. which are in the same proportiō, now by 9 the antecedent multiply the cons

                      for the equimultiplices of the first &amp; the third, which are equal to the former equimultiplices of the secōd &amp; fourth. Wherof it foloweth that if ye multiply 18 &amp; 9 the equimultiplices of the first and the third by any nūber greater thē 3. wherby they were now multiplied, they shal both euer exceede the equimultiplices of the second &amp; the fourth: &amp; if ye multiply thē
                     
by any number lesse then 3. they shall euer both want of them. So that whatsoeuer multiplication it be, they shall euer both exceede, be equal, or want aboue, to, or from 18.

                     Magnitudes which are in one and the selfe same proportion, are called Proportionall.
                  As if the lyne A, haue the same proportion to the line B, that the lyne C hath to the lyne D, then are the

said foure magnitudes A, B, C, D, called proportionall. Also in numbers for that 9. to 3. hath that same proportiō that 12 hath to 4:9 12 therefore these foure nūbers 9.3.12.4.3 4 are said to be proportionall. Here is to be noted that this likenes or idemptitie of proportiō which is called, as before was said proportionalitie, is of two sortes: the one is continuall, the other is discontinuall.
                        Proportionality of two sortes, conti

                           uall and discontinuall.
                      Continuall proportionalitie is, when the magnitudes set in lyke proportion, are so ioyned together, that the second which is consequent to the first, is antecedent to the third, and the fourth which is consequent to the third, is antecedent to the fift, and so continually forth. So euery quantitie or terme in this proportionalitie, is both antecedent and consequent (consequent in respect of tha which went before,
                        An example of continuall proportionalitie in numbers.
                      &amp; antecedent in respect of that which followeth) except the first, which is onely antecedent to that which followeth, and the last which is onely consequent to that which went before. Take an example in these numbers, 16.8.4.2.1.16.8.4.2.1. In what proportion 16. is to 8, in the same is 8. to 4, in the same also is 4. to 2, and likewise 2. to 1. For they all are in duple proportion: 16. the first is antecedent to 8, and 8. is consequent vnto it: and the selfe same 8. is antecedent to 4: which 4 beyng consequent to 8. is antecedent to 2, which 2 likewise is consequent to 4. and antecedent to 1: which because he is the last, is onely consequent, and antecedent to none, as 16. because it was the first, was antecedent onely, and consequent to none. Also in this proportionalitie all the magnitudes must of necessitie be of one kynde,
                        In coutinnall proportionalitie the quantities cannot be of one kinde.
                      by reason of the continuation of the proportions in this proportionalitie, because there is no proportion betwene quantities of diuers kyndes. Discontinuall proportionalitie is,

                      when the magnitudes which are set in lyke proportion, are not continually set, as before they were, hauyng one terme referred both to that which went before, and to that which foloweth, but haue their termes distinct and seuered asonder: as the first is antecedent to the second, so is the third antecedent to the fourth. Example in numbers, as 8 is to 4.
                        Example of discontinual proportionality in numbers.
                      so is 6. to 3. for either proportion is duple. Where ye see, how ech proportion hath hys owne antecedent and consequent distinct from the antecedent and consequent of the other, and no one number is antecedent and consequent in diuers respectes. And by reason of the discontinuaunce of the proportions in this proportionalitie,
                        In discōtinual proportionalitie the proportions may be of diuers kindes.
                      the quantities compared, may be of diuers kyndes, because the consequent in the first proportion is not the antecedent in the second proportion. So that ye may compare superficies to superficies, or body to body in the selfe same proportion that ye do lyne to lyne.

                      the multiplex of the first excedeth the multiplex of the second, &amp; the multiplex of the third, excedeth not the multiplex of the fourth: then hath the first to the second a greater proportion, then hath the third to the fourth.
                  In the sixt definition was declared what magnitudes are said to be in 
                        ••
                     e and the same proportion: now he sheweth in this definition what magnitudes are said to be in a greater proportion. And here is supposed the same order of multiplication, that there in that definition was vsed: namely, that the first and the third be equally multiplied, that is, by one &amp; the selfe same nūber: and also that the second and the fourth be equally multiplied by

the same or some other number: and then if the multiplex of the first, excede the multiplex of the second:
                        An example of this definition in magnitudes.
                      &amp; the multiplex of the third; excede not the multiplex of the fourth, the first hath a greater proportion to the second, then hath the third to the fourth. As suppose that there be foure quantities, A, B, C, D: of which let A be the first, B the second, C the third, &amp; D the fourth. And let A the first cōmine 6. and let B the second containe 2. &amp; C the third 4. &amp; D the fourth 3: Now take the equimultiplices of A and C the first &amp; the third, which let be E and F, so that how multiplex E is to A so multiplex let F be to C: namely for example sake let either of them be triple: so haue you 18. for the multiplex of A, and 12. for the multiplex of C. Likewise take the equimultiplices of B &amp; D, the second &amp; the fourth, multiplying them also by one and the self same number, as by 4: so haue ye for the multiplex of B the second 8, namely, the line G, and for the multiplex of D the fourth 12, namely, the line H. Now because the line E multiplex to the first, namely, 18, excedeth the line G multiplex to the second, namely, 8: And the line F multiplex to the third, namely, 12, excedeth not the line H multiplex to the fourth, namely, 12 (for that they are equall) the proportiō of A to B the first to the second, is greater then the proportion of C to D the third to the fourth. So likewise in nū
                     bers: take 11. to 2. &amp; 7. to 3. and multiply

11. &amp; 7.
                        An example in numbers.
                      (the first, and the third) by 2, so shall ye haue 22. for the multiplex of the first, and 14. for the multiplex of the third: and multiply 2. and 3. the second and the fourth by 6: so shall the multiplex of the second be 12. and the multiplex of the fourth be 18:

Now ye see 22. the multiplex of the first, excedeth 12, the multiplex of the second. But 14. the multiplex of the third, excedeth not 18. the multiplex of the fourth: Wherefore the proportion of 11. to 2. the first to the second, is greater then the proportion of 7. to 3, the third to the fourth. And so of all other quantities and numbers, which are not in one and the selfe same proportion, ye may know when the first to the second hath a greater proportion then the third to the fourth.
                  
                     ¶An other example.
                     This example haue I set to declare

that although the proportion of the first to the second be greater then the proportion of the third to the fourth, yet the multiplex of the first excedeth not the multiplex of the secōd. Wherfore it is diligently to be noted,

                         that it is sufficient to shew that the proportion of the first to the second is greater thē the proportion of the third to the fourth, if the want or lacke of the multiplex of the first from the multiplex of the second, be lesse then the want or lacke of the multiplex of the third to the multiplex of the fourth. As in this example 16. the multiplex of 8. the first, wanteth of 20. the multiplex of 4. the second, foure: wheras 18. the multiplex of 9, the third, wāteth of 45, the multiplex of 9 the fourth, 27. And so of all others wheras (the proportions being diuers) the equimultiplices of the first and the third are both lesse, then the equimultiplices of the second and the fourth. Likewise if the equimultiplices of the first and the third do both excede the equimultiplices of the second &amp; the first, thē shall the excesse of the multiplex of the first aboue the multiplex of the second, be greater thē the excesse of the multiplex of the third, aboue the multiplex of the fourth. As in these numbers here set, the equimultiplices of 6. and 4. the first and the third, namely, 12. and 8. do both excede the equimultiplices of 2. and 3. the second and the fourth, namely, 4. and 6. But 12. the multiplex of the first excedeth 4. the multiplex of the second by 4, and 8. the multiplex of the thyrd excedeth 6. the multiplex of the fourth by 2. but 8. is

more then 2. Howbeit this is generally certaine that when soeuer the proportion of the first to the secōd is greater then the proportion of the third to the fourth, there may be found some multiplication, that whē the equimultiplices of the first and the third shall be compared to the equimultiplices of the second and the fourth, the multiplex of the first shall excede the multiplex of the second, &amp; the multiplex of the third shall not excede the multiplex of the fourth, according to the plaine wordes of the definition.
                     In like maner when you haue taken the equimultiplices of the first &amp; the third, and also the equimultiplices of the second and the fourth, if the multiplex of the first excede not the multiplex of the second, and the multiplex of the third excede the multiplex of the fourth: then hath the first to the second a lesse proportion, then hath the third to the fourth. As in the example before, if ye chaunge the termes, and make C the first, D the second, A the third, and B the fourth: then shall

F, namely, 12. the multiplex of the first not excede H, namely, 12. the multiplex of the second: but E, namely, 18. the multiplex of the third excedeth G, namely, 8. the multiplex of the fourth. Wherefore the proportion of C to D, the first to the second, is lesse then the proportion of A to B, the third to the fourth.
                     Euen so in numbers. As in this example,

5. to 4. and 7. to 3. If ye multiply 5. and 7. the first and the third eche by 3, ye shall for the multiplex of 5. the first haue 15. and for the multiplex of 7. the third shall ye haue 21: againe if ye multiply 4. and 3. the second &amp; the fourth by 6, for the multiplex of 4. the second ye shall haue 24, and for the multiplex of 3. the fourth, ye shall haue 18. So ye see that 
                           •
                        5. the multiplex of the first, is lesse then 24, the multiplex of the second: and 21. the multiplex of the third is greater then 18. the multiplex of the fourth. Wherefore the proportion of 5. to 4. the first to the second is lesse then the proportion of 7. to 3. the third to the fourth.
                  
               
               
                  Proportionallitie consisteth at the lest in three termes.
                        The ninth definition.
                     
                  
                  Before it was sayd, that proportionalitie is a likenesse or an idemptitie of proportions. Wherfore of necessitie in proportionalitie, there must be two proportions, and euery proportion hath two termes, namely, his antecedent and consequent. Therfore in euery proportionalitie th
                        •
                     re are foure termes. But for that somtyme, one terme supplieth by diuers relations, the roume of two, for in respect to the first it is consequent, and in respect to that which followeth, it is antecedent: therfore three termes at least and not vnder may suffice in proportionalitie, which three are in power foure, and occupy the rome of foure, as is sayd.
                        An example of this definition in magnitudes.
                      As suppose that A hath to B that proportion, that B

hath to C: then are these thre quantities A, B, C, set in the lest number of proportionality.
                        Example

                        The tenth definition.
                      the first shall be vnto the third in double proportion that it is to the second. But when there are foure magnitudes in proportion the first shall be vnto the fourth in treble proportion that it is to the second. And so alwaies in order one more, as the proportion shall be extended.
                  This definition is also vnderstand in continuall proportionalitie.
                        Example of this definition in magnitudes.
                      As if the thre magnitudes A, B, C, bee proportionall: then shall the proportion of A the

first to C the thirde, bee

double to the proportion which is betwene A &amp; B the first and the seconde, that is the proportiō of A to B taken twise, or added to it self (which is all one) shall make the proportiō of A to C. For the easier vnderstādyng of this &amp; the practise therof, it shall be much necessary somwhat to instruct the rude beginner how proportions may be added one to an other. Which is done by this rule.
                  
                     
                        A rule to adde proportions to proportions.
                     Multiply the antecedent of the one proportion by the antecedēt of the other, and the number produced shall be the antecedent of the proportion which contayneth them both. Likewyse multiply the consequent of the one proportion by the consequent of the other, and the number produced shall be consequent of the proportion which shall contayne them both.
                  
                     
                        Example thereof.
                     
                     An example. If ye will adde the proportion which is betwene 4 and 2. (which is dupla) to the proportion which is betwene 9 and 3. (which is tripla) multiply 9. the antecedent of the first proportion by 4. the antecedent of the

second proportion, and ye shall produce 36. which reserue and kepe for the antecedent of the proportion which ye seeke for. Likewise multiply 3 the consequent of the first proportion, by 2 the consequent of the second, so shall ye haue 6. which 6. shall be consequent to the former antecedēt, namely, to 36. so shal the proportiō which is betwene 36 and 6. namely, sextupla, contayne in it the two proportions geuen, namely, tripla, and dupla. And by this meanes are they added together, &amp; brought into one. And by this may ye adde all other kyndes of proportions whatsoeuer they be. Now for that the diffinition sayth, that if there be three quantities in proportiō, that is, what proportiō the first hath to the secōd, the same hath the second to the third, which for example let be tr
                        •
                     ple, as in these nūbers, 27. 9. 3. adde triple to triple by the rule abouesaid. And forasmuch as it is easier to worke in small nū
                     bers then in great, reduce these proportiōs to theyr least denomination:27. 9. 
                           •
                        . So 27. to 9. reduced to the lest termes in that proportion, is as much as 3. to 1. Likewise 9 to 3 reduced to theyr lest termes are also as much as 3 to 1.9 now adde together these two triple proportions thus reduced, multipliyng 3 by 3.3—3 the one antecedent by the other, so shall ye produce 9 for a new antecedent, then multiply 1 by 1.1—1 the one consequent by the other, so shall you produce 1. which let be consequent to 9. your antecedent, so the proportion betwene 9 and 1. which is noncuple contayneth both the two triple proportions. And because they were equal the one to the other, it is duple to eche of them. Ye see 
                        •
                     lso that the proportion of 27 to 3. the first to the third, is also noncuple. Wherfore according to the definition, the proportion of the first to the third, is double to the proportion of the first to the second, as 9 to 1. beyng noncuple, is double 3 to 1. which is triple, because it contayneth it twise.
                  So if there be 4. quantities in continuall proportion, the proportion of the first to the fourth, shall be triple to the proportion which is betwene the first and the second, that is, it shall contayne it three tymes. As for example, Take 4. numbers in continual proportion 8. 4. 2. 1.8. 4. 2. 1. Ye see that the proportiō of 8 to 1.2 2 2 the first to the fourth,1 1 1 is octupla: the proportion of 8 to 4. the first to the second is dupla, now treble dupla proportion, that is, adde 3. dupla proportions together, by the rule before geuen, as ye see in the example. Multiply all the antecedentes together 2.

the antecedent of the first proportion, by 2. the antecedent of the second, so haue ye 4: which 4. multiply by 2 the antecedent of the third proportiō, so shal ye haue 8 for a new antecedent. In lyke maner multiply all the consequentes together, 1. the consequent of the first proportion by 1. the consequent of the second proportiō, so shal ye haue 1, which 1. multiply agayne by 1. the cōsequent of the third proportion, so shall ye haue agayne 1: which 1. let be consequent to your former antecedent 8: so haue ye 8 to 1. which is octupla, which was also the proportion of the first to the fourth, which octupla is also brought fourth of the addition of thre dupla proportions together, and contayneth it three tymes, wherefore octupla is tripla to dupla, and therfore as the diffinition sayth: the proportion of the first to the fourth is tripla to the proportion of the first to the second. And so consequently forth as long as the proportionalitie continueth accordyng to the sentence of the diffinition, the termes of the proportions exceding the number of proportions by one. As if ye haue 5. termes in proportion, the proportiō of the first to the fifth shal be quadrupla to the proportion of the first to the second, and if there be 6. termes, it shall be quintupla and so in order.
               
               
                  Magnitudes of like proportion, are sayd to be antecedents to antecedentes, and consequentes to consequentes.
                        The eleuenth definition.
                     
                  
                  For that before it was sayd, that proportion was a relation or a respect of one quantitie to an other, now sheweth he what magnitudes are sayd to be of like proportion, namely, these whose antecedents haue like respect to their consequentes, and whose consequents receyue

like respectes of their antecedēts.

                           .
                      As putting 4. magnitudes A, B, CD. If A antecedent to B, be double to B, and C antecedent to D, be double also to D, thē haue the two antecedentes like respectes to their consequents. Likewise if B the consequent be halfe of A, and also D the consequent be halfe of C, then the two consequentes B and D receiue of their antecedentes like respectes and relations. And by this diffinition, are these magnitudes A, B, C, D, of like proportion.
                  Also in numbers, 9. 3. 6. 2: because 9 the antecedent is triple to 3. his consequent, and the antecedent 6. is also triple to 2 his consequent:

                  The vnderstanding of this definition &amp; of all the definitions following, dependeth of the definition going before, and vse it for a generall supposition, namely, to

haue foure quantities in proportion. Suppose foure magnitudes A, B, C, D, to be in proportion,

                      namely, as A is to B, so let C be to D. Now if ye compare A the antecedent of the first proportion to C the antecedent of the second as to his consequent, &amp; likewise if ye compare

B the cōsequent of the first proportion as an antecedent to D the consequent of the second as to his consequent: then shall ye haue the magnitudes in this sort: as A to C, antecedent to antecedent,

                      so B to D, consequent to consequent, &amp; this is called permutate proportion or alternate. In numbers as 12. to 6, so

8. to 4. either is dupla. Wherefore by permutation of proportion, as 12. to 8. antecedent to antecedent, so is 6. to 4. consequent to consequent, for either is sesquialtera.

Now if ye compare A the excesse of AB the first antecedent, aboue the consequent B, as antecedent to B the consequent, as to his consequent: also if ye compare D the excesse of the second antecedent CD, aboue the consequent D, as antecedent to D the consequent, as to his consequent: then shall your magnitudes be in this order.

the excesse of 9. the antecedent of the first proportion aboue 6. the consequent of the same is 3: the excesse of 12. the antecedent of the second proportion aboue 8. the consequent of the same, is 4: now cōpare the antecedent of the first proportion 9. as antecedēt to 3. the excesse therof aboue 6. the consequēt, as to his consequent, likewise compare 12. the antecedent of the second proportion as antecedent to 4. the excesse therof aboue 8. the consequent, as to his consequent: so shall your numbers be in thys order by conuersion of proportion: as 9. to 3: so 12. to 4: for either proportion is triple.
               
               
                  
                     
                        The seuētenth definition.
                     Proportion of equalitie is, when there are taken a number of magnitudes in one order, and also as many other magnitudes in an other order, comparing two to two beyng in the same proportion, it commeth to passe, that as in the first order of magnitudes, the first is to the last, so in the second order of magnitudes is the first to the last. Or otherwise it is a comparison of extremes together, the middle magnitudes being taken away.
                  To the declaration of thys definition are required two orders of magnitudes equall in number, and in lyke proportion:
                        An example of this definition in magnitudes.
                      As if there be taken in some determinate number certayne magnitudes, namely, foure, A, B, C, D. And also in the same number be taken other quantities, namely, foure, E, F, G, H: then take the equall proportions by two and two: as A to B, so E to F: as B to C,

so F to G: and as C to D, so G

to H. Now according to the first definition, if A the first magnitude of the first order be to D the last magnitude of the same order, as E the first magnitude of the second order is to H the last magnitude the same, then it is called proportion of equalitie, or equall proportion.
                  By the second definition, which is all one in substance with the first, ye leaue the meane magnitudes in eyther order, namely, B, C, on the one side, and F, G on the other side, and onely compare the extremes of ech side together, which by thys definition shall be in lyke proportion, as A is to D, so is E to H.
                  Euen so in numbers, take for example these two orders,

27. 9. 12. 24. 25. and 9. 3. 4. 8. 5. there are in eche order as ye see,

                        Note.
                      that it is not of necessitie that all the proportione in eche rowe of numbers be set in like order, as in the one so in the other: but it shall be sufficient that the proportions be the same and in equall number in eche rowe.

                  For the declaration of this definition are also required two orders of magnitudes.
                        An example of this definition in magnitudes.
                      Suppose in the first order, that the antecedent A, to his consequent B, haue the same proportion that the antecedent D, hath to his cōsequent E in the second order: and make the consequent B

antecedēt to some other quantitie, as to C. Also make the consequent E antecedēt to an other quātitie, as to F, so that there be the same proportion of B to C, which is of E to to F. And thys disposition of proportions is called ordinate proportionalitie.

               The 1. Theoreme. The 1. Proposition. If there be a number of magnitudes how many soeuer equemultiplices to a like number of magnitudes ech to ech: how multiplex on magnitude is to one, so multiplices are all the magnitudes to all.
               SVppose that there be a number of magnitudes, namely, AB, and DC equimultiplices. to a like number of magnitudes E and F ech to ech. Then I say, that how multiplex AB is to E, so multiplices are AB and DC to E and F. For forasmuch as how multiplex AB is to E, so multiplex is DC to F, therefore how many magnitudes there are in AB equall vnto E so in any are there in DC

equall vnto F.Construction. Deuide AB into the magnitudes

which are equall vnto E, that is, into AG and GB: and likewise DC into the magnitudes which are equall vnto F, that is, into DH and HC.Demonstration. Now then the multitude of these DH &amp; HC, is equall vnto the multitude of these AG &amp; GB. And forasmuch as AG is equall vnto E, and DH vnto F: therfore AG and DH, are equall vnto E and F: and by the same reason forasmuch as GB is equall vnto E, and HC vnto F, GB also and HC are equall vnto E and F. Wherefore how many magnitudes there are in AB equall vnto E, so many are there in AB and DC equall vnto E &amp; F: Wherefore how multiplex AB is to E, so multiplices are AB and DC to E and F. If therefore there be a number of magnitudes how many soeuer equemultiplices to a like number of magnitudes ech to ech, how multiplex one magnitude is to one, so multiplices are all the magnitudes to all: which was required to be proued.
            
            
               The 2. Theoreme. The 2. Proposition. If the first be equemultiplex to the second as the third is to the fourth, and if the fifth also be equemultiplex to the second as the sixt is to the fourth: then shall the first and the fifth composed together be equemultiplex to the second, as the third and the sixt composed together is to the fourth.
               SVppose that there be sixe quantities, of which let AB be the first, C the second, DE the third, F the fourth, BG the fifth, &amp; EH the sixt: and suppose that the first, AB, be equemultiplex vnto the second, C, as the third, DE, is to the fourth, F: and let the fift, BG, be equemultiplex vnto the second, C, as the sixt, EH, is to the fourth, F. Then I say, that the first and the fifth composed together, which let be AG, is equemultiplex vnto the second, C, as the third and sixt composed together, which let be DH, is to the fourth, F. For forasmuch as AB is equemultiplex to C,Demonstration

to F, therefore how many magnitudes there are in AB equall vnto C, so many magnitudes are there in DE equall vnto F: and by the same reason how many there are in BG equall vnto C, so many also are there in EH equall vnto F. Wherefore how many there are in the whole AG equall vnto C, so many are there in the whole DH equall vnto F. Wherefore how multiplex AG is vnto C, so multiplex is DH vnto F. Wherefore the first and the fifth composed

together, namely, AG is equemultiplex vnto the second C, as the third and the sixte composed together, namely, DH, is to the fourth F. If therfore the first be equemultiplex to the second as the third is to the fourth, and if the fifth also be equemultiplex to the second as the sixt is to the fourth: then shall the first &amp; the fifth cōposed together, be equemultiplex to the second, as the third and the sixt composed together

               SVppose that there be foure magnitudes, of which let A be the first, B the second, C the third, and D the fourth. And let the first, A, be equemultiplex to the second, B, as ye third, C, is to the fourth, D.Construction. And vnto A and C take equemultiplices, which let be EF and GH, so that how multiplex EF is to A, so multiplex let HG be to C. Then I say, that EF is equemultiplex vnto B, as GH is vnto D. For forasmuch as EF is equemultiplex vnto A, as GH is vnto C, therefore how many magnitudes

there are in EF equall vnto A, so many magnitudes also are there in GH equall vnto C. Let EF be deuided into the magnitudes that are equall vnto A, that is, into EK and KF. And likewise GH into the magnitudes equall vnto C, that is, into GL and L H. Now then the multitude of these magnitudes EK and KF,Demonstration. is equall vnto ye multitude of these magnitudes GL and LH. And forasmuch as A is equemultiplex to B, as C is to D: but EK is equall vnto A, and GL vnto C, therefore EK is equemultiplex vnto B, as GL is vnto D. And by the same reason KF is equemultiplex vnto B, as L H is to D. Now then there are sixe magnitudes whereof EK is the first: B ye second: GL y• third: D y• fourth: KF the fifth: LH the sixt. And forasmuch as the first EK is equemultiplex to the second B, as the third GL is to the fourth D: and the fift KF is equemultiplex to the second B, as the sixt LH is to the fourth D: therefore (by

the second of the fift) the first is the fift composed together, namely, EF is equemultiplex vnto the second B, as the third and the sixt composed together, namely, GH is to the fourth D. If therefore the first be equemultiplex to the second, as the third is to the fourth; and if there be taken the equemultiplices to the first and to the third, they shall be equemultiplices to them which were first taken, the one to the second, then other to the fourth: which was required to be proued.

Vnto E &amp; F take equemultiplices K

And seing that as A is to B, so is C to D, and of A and C are taken equemultiplices K and L, and likewise of B &amp; D are taken other equemultiplices, namely, M and N, therfore if K exceede M, L

               SVppose that the whole magnitude AB be vnto the whole magnitude CD equemultiplex, as the part taken away of the one, namely, AE, is to the part taken away of the other, namely, CF. Then I say that the residuē of the one, namely, EB, is to the residue of the other, namely, DF equemultiplex as the whole AB is to the whole CD. How multiplex AE is to CF, so multiplex make EB to CG.Construction. And forasmuch as (by ye first of the fifth) AE is to GF equemultiplex, as AB is to GF:Demonstration. but AE is to CF equemultiplex, as AB is to CD. Wherfore AB is equemultiplex to either

of these GF and CD. Wherfore GF is equall vnto CD. Take away CF which is common to them both. Wherfore that which remayneth namely, GC, is equall vnto that which remayneth namely, DF. And forasmuch as AE is to CF equemultiplex as EB is to GC, but GC is equall vnto DE, therefore AE is to CF equemultiplex as EB is to FD. But AE is put to be equemultiplex to CF, as AB is to CD, wherfore EB is to FD equemultiplex, as AB is to CD.

magnitude be equemultiplex to a magnitude, as a part taken away of the one is to a parte taken away of the other: the residue of the one also to the residue of the other, shalbe equemultiplex as the whole is to the whole: which was required to be proued.
            
            
               The 6. Theoreme. The 6. Proposition. If two magnitudes be

                  quemultiplices to two magnitudes, &amp; any par
                     •
                  es taken away of them also, be aequemultiplices to the same magnitudes: the residues also of them shal vnto the same magnitudes be either equall, or equemultiplices.
               SVppose that there be two magnitudes AB and CD equemultiplices to two magnitudes E and F, and let the partes takē away of the magnitudes AB and CD, namely, AG and CH be equemultiplices to the same magnitudes E and F.Two cases in this Propotion. Then I say that the residues GB and HD, are vnto the selfe same magnitudes E and F either equall, or els equemultiplices.
               
                  The first.Suppose first that GB be equall vnto E. Then I say that

HD is equall vnto F.Construction. Vnto F put an equall magnitude CK.
And forasmuch as AG is equemultiplex vnto E, as CH is vnto F:Demonstration. but GB is equall vnto E, &amp; KC vnto F: therfore AB is equemultiplex to E, as KH is to F. But AB is put equemultiplex vnto E, as CD is to F. Wherfore KH is equimultiplex vnto F, as CD is to F. And forasmuch as either of these KH and CD are equimultiplices vnto F, therfore (by the 1 common sentence) KH is equall vnto CD. Take away CH which is common to them both. Wherefore the residue KC is equal vnto the residue HD. But KC is equal vnto F, wherfore HD is equall vnto F. Wherfore if GB be equal vnto E, DH also shall be equall vnto F.
               And in like sort may we proue, yt if GB be multiplex to E, HD also shal be so multiplex vnto F. If therfore there be two magnitudes equemultiplices to two magnitudes,The second. and any parts taken away of them be also equemultiplices to ye same magnitudes: the residues also of them shall vnto the same magnitudes be either equall, or equemultiplices: which was required to be proued.
            
            
               The 7. Theoreme. The 7. Proposition. Equall magnitudes haue to one &amp; the selfe same magnitude,

one and the same proportion. And one and the same magnitude hath to equall magnitudes one and the selfe same proportion.
               SVppose that A and B be equall magnitudes, and take any other magnitude, namely, C. Then I say, that either of these A and B haue vnto C one and the same proportion: and that C also hath to either of these A and B one and the same proportion.
               Take the equemultiplices of A and B, and let the same

be D and E:The first part of this Proposition demonstrated. and likewise of C, take any other multiplex, and let the same be F. Now forasmuch as D is vnto A equemultiplex as E is to B, but A is equall vnto B, therfore (by the first common sentence) D is equall vnto E. And of C there is taken any other multiplex F. Wherefore if D exceede F, E also excedeth F: and if it be equall it is equal, and if it be lesse it is lesse. But D and E are the equemultiplices of A &amp; B, and F is of C an other multiplex. Wherfore as A is to C, so is B to C.
               I say moreouer, that C hath to either of these A and B one and the same proportion.The second part demonstrated. For the same order of constructiō remaining, we may in like sort proue, yt D is equal vnto E, &amp; there is taken an other multiplex to C, namely, F. Wherefore if F exceede D, it also excedeth E: and if it be equall it is equall: and if it be lesse it is lesse. But F is multiplex to C: and D &amp; E are other equemultiplices to A and B. Wherfore as C is to A, so is C to B. Wherfore equall magnitudes haue to one and the same magnitude, one and the same proportion: and one and the same magnitude hath to equall magnitudes one and the selfe same proportion: which was required to be demonstrated.
            
            
               The 8. Theoreme. The 8. Proposition. Vnequall magnitudes beyng taken, the greater hath to one and the same magnitude a greater proportion then hath the lesse. And that one and the same magnitude hath to the lesse a greater proportion then it hath to the greater.
               SVppose that AB and C be vnequall magnitudes, of which let AB be the greater, and C ye lesse. And let there be an other magnitude whatsoeuer, namely, D. Then I say that AB hath vnto D a greater proportion then hath C to D: and also that D hath to C a greater proportion,

then it hath to AB. For forasmuch as AB is greater then C, let there be taken a magnitude equall vnto C, namely, BE.
               Now then the lesse of these two magnitudes AE and EB being multiplied will at the length be greater then D.The first part of this Proposition demonstrated.
               
               First let AE be lesse then EB:

and let AE be so oft multiplied vntill that which is produced be greater then D,The first case of the same. and let that multiplex be FG which is greater then D. And how multiplex FG is to AE, so multiplex let GH be to EB, &amp; K to C. Then double D, and let the same be L. And againe treble it &amp; let the same be M: &amp; so forth encreasing by one till such tyme as the multiplex of D so taken be first greater then K, that is, that multiplex which amongst al the multiplices of D doth first exceede K, &amp; let the same be N, which here is quadruple to D, and the first multiplex greater then K. Now forasmuch as K is ye first multipl
                     •
                  x lesse then N, therfore K is not lesse then M. And for that FG i
                     •
                   to AE equemultiplex as GH is to EB, therfore (by the first of the fifth) FH is to AB equemultiplex as FG is to AE: but FG is equemultiplex to AE as K is to C. Wherfore FH and K are equemultiplices to AB and C. Againe forasmuch as GH is equemultiplex to EB as K is to C, but EB is equall vnto C, therfore GH is also equall vnto K. But K is not lesse then M: wherfore neyther also is GH lesse then M. But FG is greater then D. Wherefore the whole FH is greater then both these D and M. But both these D and M are equall vnto N, for M is triple to D, and M and D together are quadruple to D, and N also is quadruple to D: wherefore both these M and D are equall vnto N; but FH is greater then M and D, wherfore FH excedeth N, (that is, ye multiplex of the first, namely, of AB excedeth the multiplex of the second, namely, of D.) But K excedeth not N (that is, the multiplex of the third, namely, of C, excedeth not the multiplex of the fourth, namely, of the same D:) and FH and K are equemultiplices to AB, and C, and N, is a certayne other multiplex to D. Wherfore (by the 8. definition) AB hath to D a greater proportion then hath C to D.
               
                  The second part of the proposition demonstrated.I say moreouer that D hath to C a greater proportion then D hath to AB. For the same order of construction still remayning, we may in like sort proue that N is greater then K, and that it is not greater then FH. And N is multiplex to D, and FH and K are certayne other equemultiplices to AB and C. Wherfore D hath to C a greater proportion then D hath to AB.
               
                  But now suppose that AE be greater then EB.The second case of the f

                     . Now then EB beyng the lesse, and being oftentimes multiplied, will at the length be greater then D. Let it be so multiplied, and let th
                     •
                   multiplex of EB, namely, GH, be great
                     •
                  r then D. And how multiplex GH is to EB

so multiplex let FG be to AE and K to C. And by the former reason may we proue, that FH and K are equemultiplices to AB and C. Likewise also let N be multiplex of D, &amp; also let it be ye first multiplex which is greater then FG: wherfore agayn FG is not lesse then M. But GH is greater then D: wherefore the whole FH, excedeth D &amp; M, that is, N: but K excedeth not N. For FG which is greater then GH, that is, then K exceedeth not N. And so followyng the same order we did before, we shall performe the demonstration. Wherefore vnequall magnitudes beyng taken, the greater hath to one and the same magnitude a greater proportion then hath the lesse: and that one and the same magnitude hath to the lesse a greater proportion then it hath to the greater: which was required to be proued.
               
                  ¶ For that Orontius seemeth to demonstrate this more plainly therefore I thought it not amisse here to set it.

                        •
                      and EB is by construction equall vnto C, therfore (by the common sentence) GH is equ

                      was put to be greater then D. Wherefore the whole FH is greater then these two D and M. But D and M are equall vnto N. For N is quadruple to D. And M being triple to D, doth together with D make quadruple vnto D. Wherefore FH is greater then N. Farther, K is proued to be equall to GH. Wherefore K is lesse then N. But FH and K are equemultiplices vnto AB and C, vnto the first magnitude, I say, and the third: and N is a certaine other multiplex vnto D, which representeth the second &amp; the fourth magnitude. And the multiplex of the first excedeth the multiplex of the second: but the multiplex of the third excedeth not the multiplex of the fourth. Wherefore AB the first hath vnto D the second a greater proportion, then hath C the third to D the fourth (by the 8. definition of thys booke).
                  But if AE be greater then EB, let EB the lesse be multiplied vntill there be produced a multiplex greater then the magnitude D: which let be GH. And how multiplex GH is to EB,

may we proue, that the whole FH is vnto AB equemultiplex as GH is to EB: and also that FH &amp; K are equemultiplices vnto AB

                  Now also I say, that the self same magnitude D hath vnto the lesse magnitude C a greater proportion, thē it hath to the greater AB.

                      And this may plainly be gathered by the foresayd discourse, without chaunging the order of the magnitudes &amp; of the equemultiplices. For seing that euery way it is before proued, that FH excedeth N, and K is exceeded of the selfe same N: therefore conuersedly N excedeth K, but doth not excede FH. But N is multiplex to D that is to the first and third magnitude: and K is multiplex to the second, namely, to C
                     
                        •
                      and FH is multiplex to the fourth, namely, to AB
                     
                        •
                      Wherefore the multiplex of the first excedeth the multiplex of the second: but the multiplex of the third excedeth not the multiplex of the fourth. Wherefore (by the 8. definition of this fift booke) D the first hath vnto C the second a greater proportion, then hath D the third to AB the fourth: which was required to be proued.

For if it be not, then either A is equall vnto B or lesse then it. But A cannot be equal vnto B, for then either of these A and B should haue vnto C one and the same proportion (by the 7

Neither also is A lesse then B, for thē should A haue to C a lesse proportion, then hath B to C (by the 8. of the fifth) but by supposition it hath not. Wherfore A is not lesse then B. And it is also proued that it is not equall, wherfore A is greater then B.
               
                  The second part demonstrated.Agayne suppose that C haue to B a greater proportion then C hath to A. Then I say that B is lesse then A. For if it be not, then is it either equall vnto it or els greater, but B cannot be equall vnto A, for then should C haue to either of these A and B one and the same proportion (by the 7. of the fifth) but by supposition it hath not, wherfore B is not equall vnto A. Neither also is B greater then A, for then should C haue to B a lesse proportion then it hath to A (by the 8. of the fifth) but by supposition it hath not: wherefore B is not greater then A. And it was proued that it is not equall vnto A, wherfore B is lesse then A. Wherfore of magnitudes compared to one and the same magnitude, that which hath y• greater proportion, is the greater. And that magnitude wherunto one and the same magnitude hath the greater proportion, is the lesse. Which was required to be proued.

                  Which is thus proued. Suppose that AB haue vnto C a greater proportion thē hath D to E. And let AF be to C as D is to E. Now then by this proposition &amp; the tēth, AF is lesse then AB. Let it be lesse then AB by the quantitie FB. And multiply FB vntil there be produced a quantitie greater then C, which let be GH: which also must be such a multiplex, as D beyng

                      &amp; let N be equemultiplex to C as M is to E. Now then N is the first multiplex to C greater then LG: For for that as D is to E, so is AF to C, and K is equemultiplex to D as GL is to AF, also M is equemultiplex to E, as N is to C: therfore (by the 4. of this booke) as K is to M, so is GL to N
                        •
                      but K is to M the first multiplex lesse then M: wherfore also GL is the first multiplex lesse then N: and GL by supposition is not lesse thē C. Wherfore take the greatest multiplex of C vnder N: or a multiplex equall to N, if peraduenture N be the first of the multiplices of C, which let be O. Now then then N shall consist of O and C. Wherfore forasmuch as LG is not lesse then O, and GH is greater then C, therfore LH shall be greater then N. And forasmuch as K is lesse then M, therfore that which was required to be proued, is manifest.
                  Although this proposition here put by Campane nedeth no demonstration for that it is but the conuerse of the 8. definition of this booke, yet thought I it not worthy to be omitted, for that it reacheth the way to finde out such equemultiplices, that the multiplex of the first shall excede the multiplex of the second, but the multiplex of the third shall not exceede the multiplex of the fourth.

And for that as AB is to BE, so is CD to DF: and to AB &amp; CD are taken equemultiplices GK and LN, and likewise to EB and FD are taken certaine other equemultiplices, that is, HO, and MP. If therefore GK exceede HO, then LN also exceedeth MP: and if it be equall, it is equall: and if it be lesse, it is lesse (by the conuersion of the sixt definition of the fift). Let GK exceede HO: Wherefore KH common to them both being taken away, the residue GH, shall exceede the residue KO. But if GK exceede HO, then doth LN exceede MP: Wherefore let LN excede MP: and MN which is cōmon to the both being takē away, y• residue LM shall exceede the residue NP. Wherefore if GH exceede KO, then shall LM exceede NP. And in like sort may we proue, that if GH be equall vnto KO, then LM shall be equall vnto NP: and if it be lesse, it shall be lesse: but GH

and LM are equemultiplices to AE and GF: and likewise KO and NP are certayne other equemultiplices to EB, and FD. Wherfore as AE is to EB, so

Then I say, that composed also they shall be proportionall, that is, as AB is to BE, so is CD to DF. For if AB be not vnto BE, as CD is to FD,

then shall AB be vnto BE,This proposition is the conuerse of the former. as CD is either vnto a magnitude lesse then FD, on vnto a magnitude greater. Let it first be vnto a lesse, namely, to DG.Demonstratiō

                  17. of the first). Wherefore as AE is to EB, so is CG to GD. But by supposition as AE is to EB, so is CF to FD. Wherefore (by the 11. of the fift) as CG is to GD, so is CF to FD. Now then there are foure magnitudes, CG, GD, CF, and FD: of which the first CG is greater then the third CF. Wherefore (by the 14. of the fift) the second GD is greater then the fourth FD. But it is also put to be lesse then it: which is impossible. Wherfore it can not be that as AB is to BE, so is CD to a magnitude lesse then FD. In like sort may we proue, that it can not be so to a magnitude greater then FD. For by the same order of demonstration, it would follow that FD is greater then the sayd greater magnitude: which is impossible. Wherfore it must be to the selfe same. If therefore magnitudes deuided be proportionall, then also composed they shall be proportionall: which was required to be proued.

in the first order the first be greater then the third, then in the second order the first also shall be greater then the third: and if it be equall, it shall be equall: and if it be lesse, it shall be lesse.
               SVppose that there be three magnitudes in one order,This proposition pertaineth to Proportion of equality inordinate proportionality. namely, A, B, C, &amp; let there be as many magnitudes in an other order, which let be D, E, F, which being taken two and two in ech order, let be in one and the same proportion, that is, as A is to B, so let D be to E, and as B is to C, so let E be to F.
               And first of equalitie

let A be greater then C.The first difference. Then I say, that D also is greater then F: and if it be equall, it is equall, and if it be lesse, it is lesse. For forasmuch as A is greater then C,Demonstration. and there is a certaine other magnitude, namely, B, but the greater hath to one and the same magnitude a greater proportion then hath the lesse (by the 8. of the fift). Wherefore A hath vnto B a greater proportion then C hath to B. But as A is to B, so is D to E: and as C is to B, so is F to E (by the Cor
                     •
                  llary of the fourth of the fift). Wherefore D hath vnto E a greater proportion, then F hath to E. But of magnitudes compared to one and the same magnitude that which hath the greater proportion is the greater (by the 10. of the fift). Wherefore D is greater then F.
               But now if A be equall vnto C, D also shall be equall vnto F. For then A and C haue vnto B one and the same proportion (by the first part of the seuenth of this booke).The second difference. And for that as A is to B, so is D to E, and as C is to B, so is F to E: therefore D and F haue vnto E one and the same proportion. Wherefore by the first part of the 9: of this booke D is equall vnto F.
               But now suppose that A be lesse then C. Then also shall D be lesse then F. For by the 8. of this booke C shall haue vnto B a greater proportion then hath A to B.The third difference. But as A is to B, so is D to E by supposition, and as C is to B, so haue we proued is F to E. Wherefore F hath vnto E a greater proportion then hath D to E. Wherefore by the first part of the 10. of this booke F is greater then D.

then C.The first difference. And for asmuch as A is greater then C, &amp; there is a certaine other magnitude, namely, B: therfore (by the 8. of ye fift) A hath a greater proportiō vnto B, then C hath to B. But as A is to B, so is E to F: and againe as C is to B, so is E to D (by the Corellary of y• fourth of the fift) Wherfore E hath vnto F a greater proportion, then E hath to D. But that magnitude wherin to one and the same magnitude hath the greater proportion, is the lesse (by the 10. of the fift) Wherfore

F is lesse then D. Wherefore D is greater then F.
               But now if A be equall

vnto C,The second difference. we may also proue that D is equall vnto F. For then (by the first part of the 7. of this booke) A and C shall haue vnto B one and the same proportion. And for that as A is to B, so is E to F, &amp; as C is to B, so is E to D: therefore E hath to either of these D and F, one and ye same proportion. Wherefore by the second part of the 9. of the fift D is equall vnto F.
               
                  The third difference.Likewise, if A be lesse then C, D also is lesse then F. For then C shall haue vnto B a greater proportion, then hath A to B (by the 8. of the fift. Wherefore E also

And obseruing this order, thys demonstration will serue how many soeuer the magnitudes be in either order. If therefore there be a number of magnitudes how many soeuer in one order, and as many other magnitudes in an other order, which being taken two and two in eche order are in one and the same proportion, they shall also of equalitie be in one and the same proportion: which was required to be demonstrated.

And so forward cōtinually, which is also to be vnderstanded in the former kynde of proportion of equalitie, which is in ordinate proportion.
            
            
               The 24. Theoreme. The 24. Proposition. If the first haue vnto the second the same proportion that the third hath to the fourth, and if the fift haue vnto the second the same proportion that the sixt hath to the fourth: then also the first and fift composed together shall haue vnto the second the same proportion that the third and sixt composed together haue vnto the fourth.
               SVppose that there be sixe magnitudes AB, C, DE, F, BG, &amp; EH: of which let AB be the first, C the second, DE the third, F ye fourth, BG the fift, and EH the sixt. And suppose that AB the first, haue vnto C the second, the same proportion that DE the third hath to F the fourth,That which the second propositiō of this booke proued only touching multiplices, is here proued generally touching magnitudes. and let BG the fift haue vnto C the second the same proportion that EH the sixt hath vnto F the fourth. Then I say, that the first and fift composed together, namely, AG, hath vnto C the second the

same proportion, that the third and sixt composed together, namely, DH, hath vnto F the fourth. For, for that as BG is to C, so is EH to F: then also by conuersion (by ye Corollary of the 4. of the fift) as C is to BG, so is F to EH. And for that as AB is to C, so is DE to F, but as C is to GB, so is F to EH: therefore of equalitie (by the 22. of the fift) as AB is to BG, so is DE to EH. And forasmuch as when magnitudes deuided are proportionall, they also composed are proportionall (by ye 
                  18. of the fift): therfore as AG is to GB, so is DH to HE: but as BG is to C, so is EH to F: Wherefore againe of equalitie (by the 22. of the fift) as AG is to C, so is DH to F. If therefore the first haue vnto the second the same proportion that the third hath to the fourth, and if the fift haue vnto the second the same proportion that ye sixt hath to the fourth: then also the first and fift composed together shall haue vnto the second the same proportion that the third and sixt composed together haue vnto the fourth: which was required to be proued.
            
            
               
               The 25. Theoreme. The 25. Proposition. If there be foure magnitudes proportionall: the greatest and the least of them, shall be greater then the other remayning.
               SVppose that there be foure magnitudes proportionall AB, CD, E and F. So that as AB is to CD, so let E be to F. And let the greatest of them be AB, &amp; the lest of them be F. Then I say, that these two magnitudes AB and F, are greater then the two magnitudes CD &amp; E. Forasmuch as AB is supposed to be the greatest of all foure, therefore it is greater then E. Therefore from the greater AB cut of (by the 3. of the first) vnto E an equall magnitude AG. and likewise (by the same) from CD cut of vnto F an equall magnitude CH. (Which may be done, for that the magnitude CD is greater then the magnitude E: for that as AB is to CD, so is E to F, therefore alternately as AB is to E, so is CD to F (by the 16. of the fift). But

AB is greater then E: Wherfore also CD is greater then F: Which thing may also be proued by ye 
                  14. of the same.) Now for that as AB is to CD, so is E to F: but E is equall vnto AG, and F is equall vnto CH: therefore as AB is to CD, so is AG to CH: and forasmuch, as the whole AB is to the whole CD, so is the part taken away AG, to the part taken away CH: therefore the residue GB (by the 1
                        •
                     . of the fift) is vnto the residue HD, as the whole AB is to the whole CD. But AB the first is greater then CD the third: Wherfore GB the second is greater then HD the fourth (by the 14. of the fift). And forasmuch as AG is equall vnto E, &amp; CH is equall vnto F: therefore AG and F are equall vnto CH and E. And forasmuch as if vnto thinges vnequall be added thinges equall, all shall be vnequall (by the fourth common sentence): therefore seing that GB and DH are vnequall, and GB is the greater, if vnto GB be added AG and F: and likewise if vnto HD be added CH &amp; E, there shall be produced AB and F greater then CD &amp; E. If therefore there be foure magnitudes proportionall, the greatest and the least of them, shall be greater thē the other remayning: which was required to be demonstrated.
               
                  Here follow certayne propositions added by Campane, which are not to be contemned, and are cited euen of the best learned, namely, of Iohannes Regio montanus, in the Epitome which he writeth vpon Ptolome.
               
                  ¶ The first Proposition.
                  
                     If there be foure quantities, and if the proportion of the first to the second, be greater

then the proportion of the third to the fourth: then contrariwise by conuersion, the proportion of the second to the first, shall be lesse then the proportion of the fourth to the third.
                  
                  Suppose that the proportion of A to B be greater then the proportion of C to D. Then I say contrariwise by conuersion,
                        Demonstratiō leading to an impossibilitie.
                      the proportion of B to A is lesse then the proportion of D to C. For if the proportion of B to A be one and the same with the proportion of D to C, then conuersedly the proportion of A to B is one and the same with the proportion of

                     C to D, which is contrary to supposition. But if the proportion of B to A be greater then the proportion of D to C. Then let E be vnto A, as D is to C. And by the 13. of this booke, the proportion of E to A shall be lesse then the proportion of B to A. Wherfore (by the first part of the tenth of the same) E is lesse thē 
                     B. And therfore by the secōd part of the 8. of the same, A hath vnto E a greater proportiō then A hath to B. And forasmuch as by conuerse proportionalitie A is vnto E as C is to D, therfore by the 13. of the same, C hath to D a greater proportion then hath A to B, which is contrary to the supposition. For A was supposed to haue vnto B a greater proportion then hath C to D. Wherefore the proportion of B to A is neither one and the same with the proportion of C to D, nor greater then it. Wherfore it is lesse: which was required to be proued.
                  
                     
                        An other demonstration of the same affirmatiuely.
                     It may also be demonstrated directly. For let E be vnto B as C is to D. Then cō
                     uersedly B is to E as D is to C. And forasmuch as A is greater then E by the first part of the tenth of this booke, therfore by the second part of the 8 of the same B hath vnto A a lesse proportion then hath B to E. Wherfore by the 13. of the same B hath vnto A 
                     
                        •
                      lesse proportion then hath D to C: which was required to be proued.
               
               
                  ¶ The second Proposition.
                  
                     If there be foure quantities, and if the proportion of the first to the second be greater then the proportion of the third to the fourth, then alternately the proportion of the first to the third, shall be greater then the proportion of the second to the fourth.
                  
                  Let A haue vnto B a greater proportion then hath C to D. Then I say alternately A hath to C a greater proportion then hath B to D. For one and the same proportion it can not haue:
                        Demonstratiō leading to a
                              •
                            impossibilitie.
                      for then alternately A should be to B as C is to D, which is contrary to the suppositiō. But if it haue a lesse proportiō, let E be vnto C as B is to D. Now thē by the 13. of this booke

                     E hath vnto C a greater proportion then hath A to C. Wherefore (by the first part of the tenth of the same) E is greater thē 
                     A. Wherefore by the first part of the 8. of the same, E hath to B a greater proportion then hath A to B. And forasmuch as by suppositiō 
                     E is vnto C, as B is to D, therfore alternately E is to B as C is to D. Wherfore by the 13. of the same, C hath to D a greater proportion then hath A to B, which is contrary to the suppositiō. Wherfore the proportion of A to C is neither one and the same with the proportion of B to D, no
                        •
                      lesse then it, wherefore it is greater. Which was required to be proued.
                  
                     
                        An other demonstration of the same affirmatiuely.
                     This may also be demonstrated affirmatiuely, let E be vnto B as C is to D. Now thē by the first part of the tenth of this booke, E is lesse then A: wherfore by the first parte of the 8. of the same, the proportion of A to C is greater then the proportion of E to C. But alternately E is to C as B is to D. Wherfore (by the 13. of the same) A hath to C a

And so by the first part of the 10. of this booke, E shall be lesse then A. And therfore by the common sentence EB shall be lesse then AB. Wherfore by the first part of the 8. of the same AB hath vnto B a greater proportion then hath EB to B. But by composition EB is to B as CD is to D. For by supposition E is vnto B as is to D. Wherfore (by the 12. of this booke) AB hath to B a greater proportion then hath CD to D: which was required to be proued.

                      Then I say that by diuision also the proportion of A to B is greater then the proportion of C to D. For it cannot be the same. For then by composition AB should be to B as CD is to D. Neither also can it be lesse:

for if the proportion of C to D be greater then the proportion of A to B, then by the former proposition, the proportion of CD to D should be greater then the proportion of AB to B: which is contrary also to the suppositiō. Wherfore the proportion of A to B is neither one and the same with the proportion of C to D,

                     The same may also be proued affirmatiuely. Suppose that EB be vnto B as CD is to D. Now then (by the first part of the 10. of

the fifth) EB shall be lesse then AB: and therefore by the common sentence, E is lesse then A, wherfore by the first part of the 8. of this booke, the proportion of E to B, is lesse then the proportion of A to B, but as E is to B, so is C to D: wherfore the proportion of C to D, is lesse then the proportion of A to B. Wherfore the proportion of A to B is greater then the proportion of C to D: which was required to be proued.

                     If there be foure quantities, and if the proportion of the first and the second to the second be greater then the proportion of the third and the fourth to the fourth: then by euersion the proportion of the first and second to the first, shall be lesse then the proportion of the third and fourth to the third.
                  
                  Suppose that the proportion of AB to B be greater then the proportion of CD to D. Then I say that by euersion the proportion of AB to A is lesse then the proportion of CD to C.
                     
                        Demonstration.
                      For by diuision by the former

proposition the proportion of A to B is greater then the proportion of C to D. Wherefore by the first of these propositions conuersedly, B hath vnto A a lesse proportiō thē hath D to C. Wherfore by the 3. of the same by composition, the proportion of AB to A is lesse thē the proportion of CD to C: which was required to be proued.

                  Suppose that there be three quātities in one order A, B, C, &amp; as many other quātities in an other order D, E, F. And let the proportion of A to B in the first order be greater then the proportion of D to E in the second order, and let also the proportion of B to C in the first order, be greater then the proportion of E to F in the second order.

                  ¶ The seuenth Proposition.
                  
                     If there be taken three quantities in one order, and as many other in an other order, and if the proportion of the second to the third in the first order be greater then the proportion of the first to the second in the latter order, if also the proportion of the first to the second in the first order be greater then the proportion of the second to the third in the latter order: then shall the proportion of the first to the third in the first order be greater, then the proportion of the first to the third in the latter order.
                  
                  Suppose that there be three quātities in one order A, B, C, and as many other in an other order D, E, F. And let the proportion of B to C in the first order, be greater then the proportion of D to E in the second order, and let also the proportion of A to B in the first order, be greater then the proportion of E to F in the second order. Then I say that A hath to C
                     
a greater proportion then hath D to F. This pertaineth to proportion of equalitie. For let G be vnto C, as D is to E. And by the first part of the 10. of this boke

                        . And therfore by the second part of the 8. of the same, the proportiō of A to G is greater then the proportion of A to B. Wherfore A hath vnto G a much greater proportiō then hath

                      to F. Now then let H be vnto G as E is to F. And by the first part of the 10. of the same, A shalbe greater then H. And by the first part of the 8. of the same, the proportion of A to C is greater then the proportion of H to C. But by the 23. of the same the proportion of H to C is as the proportion of D to F (for G is to C as D is to E, and H is to G as E is to F.) Wherfore (by the 12. of the same) the proportion of A to C is greater then the proportion of D to F, which was required to be proued.
               
               
                  ¶ The eight Proposition.
                  
                     If the proportion of the whole to the whole, be greater th

                        n the proportion of a part taken away, to a part taken away: thē shall the proportion of the residue vnto the residue be greater then the proportion of the whole to the whole.
                  
                  Suppose that there be two quantities AB &amp; C

D: from which let there be cutte of these magnitudes AE and CF: and let the residue be EB and FD. And let the proportiō of AB to CD be greater then the proportion of AE to CF. Then I say that the proportion of EB to FD is greater then the proportion of AB to CD. For (by the second

of these propositions now added) alternately the proportion of A
                           •

                        〈◊〉
                      greater then the proportion of CD to CF. And therfore by euersion of proportion (by the 5. of the same) the proportion of AB to E
                           •
                        
                      is lesse then the proportion of CD to FD. Wherfore agayne alternately the proportion of AB to CD is lesse then the proportiō of EB to FD: which was required to be proued.
               
               
                  ¶ The ninth Proposition.
                  
                     If quantities how many soeuer in one order be compared to as many other in an other order, and if there be a greater proportion of euery one that goeth before to that wherunto it is referred, then of any that followeth to that wherunto it is referred: the proportion of them all taken together vnto all the other taken together, shall be greater, then the proportion of any that followeth to that wherunto it is compared, and also then the proportion of all them taken together to all the other taken together, but shall be lesse then the proportion of the first to the first.
                  
                  Suppose that there be three quantities in one order, A, B, C, &amp; as many other in an other order D, E, F. And let the proportiō of A to D be greater thē the proportiō of B to E, let also the proportiō of B to E, be greater then the proportiō of C to F. Thē I say that the proportiō of ABC takē al together, to DEF takē altogether, is greater thē the proportion of B
                     
to E, and also then the proportion of C to F, &amp; more ouer thē the proportion of B &amp; C takē together, to EF takē together, but is lesse then the proportiō of A to D:
                        Demonstration.
                      For forasmuch as A hath to D a greater proportiō thē hath B to E, therfore alternately A hath to B a greater proportion then hath D to E: wherfore by cōposition AB hath to B a greater proportiō thē hath DE to E. And againe alternately AB hath to DE a greater proportion then hath B to E. Wherefore by the former proposition A hath to 
                        
                           •
                        
                      a greater proportion then hath AB to DE. And by the same reason may it be proued that hath to E a greater proportion then hath BC to EF. Wherefore A hath to D a greater proportion then hath BC to EF. Wherfore alternately A hath to BC a greater proportion then hath D to EF, wherfore by composition ABC hath to BC a greater proportion then hath DEF to EF. Wherfore agayne alternately ABC hath to DEF a greater proportion then hath BC to EF. Wherefore (by the former proposition) the proportion of A to D is greater then the proportion of ABC to DEF: Which was required to be proued.

               Definitions.
               
                  
                     1. Like rectiline figures are such,
                        The first definition.
                      whose angles are equall the one to the other, and whose sides about the equall angles are proportionall.
                  As if ye take any

two rectiline figures. As for example, two triangles ABC, and DEF: 
                        〈…〉
                      of the one triangle be equall to the angles of the other, namely, if the angle A be equall to the angle D, and the angle B equall to the angle E, &amp; also the angle C equall to the angle F. And moreouer, i

                     ch the side DE hath to the side EF, and also if the side BC be vnto the side CA, as

                     he side EF is to the side FD, and mor

                     ouer if the side CA be to the side AB, as the side FD is to the side DE, then are these two triangles sayd to be like: and so iudge ye of any other kinde of figures. As if in the parallelogrammes ABCD and EFGH, the angle A be equall to the angle E, and the angle B equall to the angle F, and the angle C equall to the angle G, and the angle D equall to the angle H. And farthermore, if the side AC haue that proportion to the side CD which the side EG hath to the side GH, and if also the side CD be to the side DB as the side GH is to the side HF, and moreouer, if the side DB be to the side BA as the side HF is to the side FE, and finally, if the side BA be to the side AC as the side FE is to the side EG, then are these parallelogrammes like.

                      of proportion are both antecedentes and consequentes in either figure.
                  As if ye haue two parallelogrammes

ABCD and EFGH. If the side AB to the side EF, an antecedent of the first figure to a consequent of the second figure, haue mutually the same proportion, which the side EG hath to the side AC an antecedent of the second figure to a consequent of the first figure: then are these two figures Reciprocal. They are called of some, figures of mutuall sides, and that vndoubtedly not amisse nor vnaptly.
                        Reciprocall figures called mutuall figures.
                      And to make thys definition more plaine, Campane and Pestitarius, and others
                        •
                      thus put it: Reciprocall figures, are when the sides of other

                         mutually proportionall, as in the example and declaration before geuen. Among the barbarous they are called Mutekesia, reseruing still the Arabike worde.
               
               
                  
                     
                        The third definition.
                     
                     3. A right line is sayd to be deuided by an extreme and meane proportion, when the whole is to the greater part, as the greater part is to the lesse.
                  As if the line AB, be so deuided in the point

C, that the whole line AB haue the same proportion, to the greater part thereof, namely, to AC, which the same greater part AC hath to the lesse part therof, namely, to CB, then is the line AB deuided by an extreme and meane proportion. Commonly it is called a line deuided by proportion ha

                        ing a meane and two extremes. How to deuide a line in such sort was taught in the 11. Proposition of the second Booke, but not vnder this forme of proportion.
               
               
                  
                  
                     4. The alitude of a figure is a perpendicular line drawen from the toppe to the base.
                        The fourth definition.
                     
                  
                  As the altitude or hight of the triangle ABC, is the line AD being drawen perpendicularly from the poynt A, being the toppe or highest part of the triangle to the base therof BC. So likewise in other figures as ye see in the examples here set. That

which here

                     ee calleth the altitude or height of a figure, in the first booke in the 35. Proposition and certaine other following, he taught to be contayned within two equidistant lines: so that figures to haue one altitude and to be contayned within two equidistant lines, is all one. So in all these examples, if from the highest point of the figure ye draw an equidistant line to the base therof, and then frō that poynt draw a perpendicular to the same base that perpendicular is the altitude of the figure.
               
               
                  
                     5. A Proportion is said to be made of two proportions or more, when the quantities of the proportions multiplied the one into the other, produce an other quantitie.
                        The fifth definition.
                     
                  
                  Of addition of proportions, hath bene somewhat sayd in the declaration of the 10. definition of the fift booke: which in substance is all one with that which is here taught by Euclide. By the name of quantities of proportions, he vnderstandeth the denominations of proportions. So that to adde two proportions together, or more, and to make one of them all, is nothyng els, but to multiply their quantities together, that is to multiply euer the denominator of the one by the denominator of the other.
                        By the name of quantities is vnderstanded the denominations of proportions.
                      Thys is true in all kindes of proportion, whether it be of equalitie, or of the greater inequalitie, when the greater quantitie is referred to the lesse: or of the lesse inequalitie, when the lesse quantitie is referred to the greater: or of them mixed together. If the proportions be like, to adde two together is to double the one, to adde 3. like is to triple the one, and so forth in like proportions, as was sufficiently declared in the declaration of the 10. and 11. definitions of the fift Booke. Where it was shewed, that if there be 3. quantities in like proportion, the proportion of the first to the thyrd, is the proportion of the first to the second doubled: and if there be foure quantities in like proportion; the proportion of the f

betwene them. Suppose three quantities A, B, C, so that let A haue to B sesquialtera proportion, namely, 6. to 4. And let B to C haue sesquitertia proportion, namely, 4. to 3.
                        Example of this definitiō.
                      Now the proportion of A to

C, the first to the thyrd, is made of the proportion of A to B, and of the proportion of B to to C added together. If ye will adde them together, ye must by this definition multiply the quantitie or denominator of the one, by the quātitie or denominator of the other. Ye must first therefore seeke the denominators of these proportions, by the rule before geuen in the declaration of the definitions of the fift Booke. As if ye deuide A by B, namely, 6. by 4, so shall ye haue in the quotient 1

it shall not be vnnecessary somewhat also to say of substraction of them.
                        Of substraction of proportion.
                      Where it is to be noted, that as addition of them, is made by multiplicatiō of their denominations the one into the other: so is the substraction of the one from the other done, by diuision of the denomination of the one by the denomination of the other. As if ye will from sextupla proportion subtrahe dupla proportion, take the denominations of them both. The denomination of sextupla proportion, is 6, the denomination of dupla proportion, is 2. Now deuide 6. the denomination of the one by 2. the denomination of the other: the quotient shall be 3: which is the denomination of a new proportion, namely, tripla: so that when dupla proportion is subtrahed from sextupla, there shall remayne tripla proportion. And thus may ye do in all others.

               The 1. Theoreme. The 1. Proposition. Triangles &amp; parallelogrammes which are vnder one &amp; the self same altitude: are in proportion as the base of the one is to the base of the other.
               SVppose that there be two triangles ABC and ACD, &amp; two paralleiogrammes EC and CF. Which let be set vnder one and the selfe same altitude, or perpendicular line drawen from the toppe A to the base BD. Then I say that as the base BC is to the base CD so is the triangle ABC to the triangle ACD: and the parallelogramme EC to the parallelogramme CF. For forasmuch as the parallelogrammes.Construction.

C and CF are vnder one and the selfe same altitude, therfore the lines EA and AF make both one right line, and so also do the lines BC and CD: and therefore the lyne EF is a parallel vnto the line BD. Produce the right line DB on

Then draw these right lines AG, AH, AK, and AL.
               And forasmuch as the lines CB, BG, and GH are equall the one to the other,Demonstration of the first part. therfore the triangles also AHG, AGB and ABC, are (by the 38. of the first) equall the one to the other. Wherfore how multiplex the base HC is to the base BC, so multiplex also is the triangle AHC to the triangle ABC. And by the same reason also, how multiplex the base LC is to the base DC, so multiplex also is the triangle ALC to the triangle ADC. Wherfore if the base HC be equall vnto the base CL, then (by the 38. of the first) the triangle AHC is equall vnto the triangle ACL. And if the base HC exceede the base CL, then also the triangle AHC excedeth the triangle ACL, and if the base be lesse, the triāgle also shall be lesse.

Wherefore (by the 11. of the fifth) as the base BC is to the base CD, so is the parallelogramme EC to the parallelogramme FC. The parallelogrammes may also be demonstrated a part by themselues as the triangles are, if we describe vpon the bases BG, GH, and DK &amp; KL parallelogrammes vnder the self same altitude that the parallelogramme

               The 2. Theoreme. The 2. Proposition. If to any one of the sides of a triangle be drawen a parallel

right line, it shall cut the sides of the same triangle proportionally. And if the sides of a triangle be cut proportionally, a right lyne drawn from section to section is a parallel to the other side of the triangle.
               SVppose that there be a triangle ABC, vnto one of the sides whereof, namely, vnto BC, let there be drawen a parallel line DE cuttyng the sides AC and AB in the pointes E and D. Then I say first that as BD is to DA, so is CE to EA.The first part of this Theoreme. Draw a line from B to E, &amp; also from C to D. Wherfore (by the 37. of the first) the triangle BDE is equall vnto the triangle CDE: for they are set vpon one and the same base DE, and are contained within the selfe same parallels DE and BC. Consider

also a certaine other triangle ADE. Now thinges equall (by the 7. of the fifth) haue to one selfe thing one and the same proportion. Wherfore as ye triangle BDE is to ye triangle ADE, so is ye triangle CDE to the triangle ADE. But as ye triangle BDE is to ye triangle ADE, so is ye base BD to ye base DA (by the first of this booke.) For they are vnder one and the selfe same toppe, namely, E, and therfore are vnder one and the same altitude. And by the same reason as the triangle CDE is to the triangle ADE, so is the lyne CE to the lyne EA. Wherfore (by the 11. of the fifth) as the line BD is to the line DA, so is the line CE to the line EA.
               But now suppose that in ye triangle ABC the sides AB &amp; AC be cut proportionally so yt as BD is to DA, so let CE be to EA, &amp; draw a line from D to E. Then secondly I say yt the line DE is a parallel to ye lyne BC.Demonstration of the second part. For the same order of construction being kept, for yt as BD is to DA, so is CE to EA, but as BD is to DA, so is ye triangle BDE to ye triangle ADE (by the 1. of the sixt) &amp; as CE is to EA, so (by ye same) is the triangle CDE to ye triangle ADE: therfore (by the 11. of the fifth) as the triangle BDE is to the triangle ADE, so is the triangle CDE to the triangle ADE. Wherfore either of these triangles BDE and CDE haue to the triangle ADE one and the same proportion. Wherefore (by the 9. of the fifth) the triangle BDE is equall vnto the triangle CDE, and they are vpon one and the selfe base, namely, DE. But triangles equall and set vpon one base, are also contained within the same parallel lines (by the 39. of the first.) Wherfore the line DE is vnto the line BC a parallel. If therfore to any one of the sides of a triangle be drawn a parallel line, it cutteth the other sides of the same triangle proportionally. And if the sides of a triangle be cut proportionally, a right lyne drawen from section to section, is parallel to the other side of the triangle: which thing was required to be demonstrated.
               
                  
                  ¶ Here also Flussates addeth a Corollary.
                  
                     If a line parallel to one of the sides of a triangle do cut the triangle, it shall cut of from the whole triangle a triangle like to the whole triangle.
                     
                        A Corollary added by Flussates.
                      For as it hath bene proued it deuideth the sides proportionally. So that as EC is to EA, so is BD to DA, wherfore by the 18. of the fifth, as AC is to AE, so is AB to AD. Wherfore alternately by the 16. of the fifth as AC is to AB, so is AE to AD: wherefore in the two triangles EAD and CAB the sides about the common angle A are proportional. The sayd triangles also are equiangle. For forasmuch as the right lynes AEC and ADB do fall vpon the parallel lynes ED and CB, therefore by the 29. of the firs
                        •
                      they make the angles AED and ADE in the triangle ADE equall to the angles ACB and ABC in the triangle ACB. Wherefore by the first definition of this booke the whole triangle ABC is like vnto the triangle cut of ADE.
               
            
            
               The 3. Theoreme. The 3. Proposition. If an angle of a triangle be deuided into two equall partes, and if the right line which deuideth the angle deuide also the base: the segmentes of the base shall be in the same proportion the one to the other, that the other sides of the triangle are. And if the segmētes of the base be in the same proportion that the other sides of the sayd triangle are: a right drawen from the toppe of the triangle vnto the section, shall deuide the angle of the triangle into two equall partes.
               SVppose that there be a triangle ABC, and (by the 9. of the first) let the angle BAC be deuided into two equall partes by the right lyne AD, which let cut also the base BC in the point D. Then I say that as the segment BD is to ye segment DC, so is the side BA to the side AC.Construction. For by the point C (by the 31. of the first) draw

vnto the line DA a parallel line CE and extende the line BA till it concurre with the line CE in the point E, and do make the triangle BEC.Demonstration of the first part. But the lyne BA shall concurre with the line CE (by the 5. peticion) for that the angles EBC, and BCE are lesse then two right angles. For the angle ECB is equall to the outwarde and opposite angle ADB (by the 29. of the first.) And the two angles ADB and DBA of the triangle BAD are lesse then two right angles (by the 17. of the first) Now forasmuch as vpon the parallels AD and EC falleth the right line AC, therefore

by the 29. of the first) the angle ACE is equall vnto the angle CAD. But vnto the angle CAD is the angle BAD supposed to be equall. Wherfore the angle BAD is also equall vnto the angle ACE. Againe because vpon the parallels AD and EC falleth the right line BAE, the outward angle BAD (by the 28. of the first) is equall vnto the inward angle AEC. But before it was prouell that ye angle ACE is equall vnto ye angle BAD, wherfore ye angle ACE is equall vnto ye angle AEC. Wherefore (by ye 6. of ye first) ye side AE is equall vnto the side AC. And because to one of ye sides of ye triangle BCE, namely, to EC is drawen a parallel line AD, therfore (by ye 
                  2. of ye sixt) as BD is to DC, so is BA to AE. But AE is equall vnto AC, therfore as BD is to DC, so is BA to AC. But now suppose that as the segment BD is to the

segment DC,Demonstrati
                        •
                     n of the second part, which is the conuerse of the first. so is the side BA to the side AC, &amp; draw a line from A to D. Then I say that the angle BAC is by ye right line AD deuided into two equall partes. For the same order of construction remayning, for that as BD is to DC, so is BA to AC, but as BD is to DC, so is BA to AE (by the 2. of the sixt) for vnto one of the sides of the triangle BCE, namely, vnto the side EC is drawn a parallel line AD. Wherefore also as BA is to AC, so is BA to AE (by the 11. of the fifth) Wherfore (by the 9. of the fifth) AC is equall vnto AE. Wherfore also (by the 5. of the first) the angle AEC is equall vnto the angle ACE, but the angle AEC (by the 29. of the first) is equall vnto the outward angle BAD: and the angle ACE is equall vnto the angle CAD which is alternate vnto him: wherefore the angle BAD is equall vnto the angle CAD. Wherfore the angle BAC is by the right line AD deuided into two equall partes. Wherefore if an angle of a triangle be deuided into two equall partes, and if the right line which deuideth the angle cut also the base, the segmentes of the base shall be in the same proportion the one to the other, that the other sides of the said triangle are. And if the segmentes of the base be in the same proportion that the other sides of the sayd triangle are, a right line drawen from the toppe of the triangle vnto the section deuideth the angle of the triangle into two equall partes.

               The 4. Theoreme. The 4. Proposition. In equiangle triangles, the sides which cōtaine the equall angles are proportionall, and the sides which are subtended vnder the equall angles are of like proportion.
               
                  SVppose that there be two equiangle triangles ABC and DCE: and let the angle ABC of the one triangle, be equall vnto ye angle DCE of the other triangle, and the angle BAC equall vnto ye angle CDE, and moreouer, the angle ACB equall vnto the angle DEC. Then I say, that those sides of ye triangles ABC, &amp; DCE, which include the equall angles, are proportionall, and the side which are subtended vnder the equall angles are of like proportion.Construction. For let two sides of the sayd triangles, namely, two of those sides which are subtended vnder equall angles: as for example the sides BC and CE, be so set that they both make one right line. And because the angles ABC &amp; ACB are lesse then two right angles (by the 17. of the first): but the angle ACB is equall

vnto the angle DEC: therfore ye angles ABC &amp; DEC are lesse thē two right angles. Wherefore the lines BA &amp; ED being produced, will at the length meete together. Let them meete and ioyne together in the poynt F.Demonstration. And because by supposition the angle DCE is equall vnto the angle ABC, therfore the line BF is (by the 28. of the first) a parallell vnto t

Wherefore FADC is a parallelogramme. Wherfore the side FA is equall vnto the side DC: and the side AC vnto the side FD (by the 34. of the first). And because vnto one of the sides of the triangle BFE, namely, to FE is drawen a parallell line AC, therefore as BA is to AF, so is BC to CE (by the 2. of the sixt). But AF is equall vnto CD. Wherfore (by the 11. of the fift) as BA is to CD, so is BC to CE, which are sides subtended vnder equall angles. Wherefore alternately (by the 16. of the fift) as AB is to BC, so is DC to CE. Againe forasmuch as CD is a parallell vnto BF, therefore againe (by the 2. of the sixt) as BC is to CE, so is FD to DE. But FD is equall vnto AC. Wherefore as BC is, to CE, so is AC to DE, which are also sides subtended vnder equall angles. Wherfore alternately (by the 16. of the fift)

               SVppose that there be two triangles ABC, &amp; DEF, hauing their sides proportionall, as AB is to BC, so let DE be to EF:This is the conuerse of the former proposition. &amp; as BC is to AC, so let EF be to DF: and moreouer, as BA is to AC, so let ED be to DF. Then I say, that the triangle ABC is equiangle vnto the triangle DEF: and those angles in them are equall vnder which are subtended sides of like proportion, that is, the angle ABC is equall vnto the angle DEF: and the angle BCA vnto the angle EFD: and moreouer, the angle BAC to ye angle EDF. Vpon the right line EF,Construction and vnto the pointes in it E &amp; F, describe (by the 23. of the first) angles equall vnto the angles ABC &amp; ACB, which let be FEG and EFG, namely, let the angle FEG be equall vnto the angle ABC, and let the angle EFG be equall to the angle ACB.Demonstration. And forasmuch as the angles ABC and ACB are lesse then two right angles (by the 17. of the first): therefore also the angles FEG and EFG are lesse then two right angles. Wherefore (by the 5. petition of ye first) ye right lines EG &amp; FG shall at ye length concurre. Let thē concurre in the poynt G. Wherefore EFG is a triangle. Wherefore the angle remayning BAC is equall vnto the angle remayning

EGF (by the first Corollary of the 32. of the first). Wherfore the triangle ABC is equiangle vnto the triangle GEF. Wherefore in the triangles ABC and EGF the sides, which include the equall angles (by the 4. of the sixt) are proportionall, and the sides which are subtended vnder the equall angles are of like proportion. Wherefore as AB is to BC, so is GE to EF. But as AB is to BC, so by supposition is DE to EF. Wherefore as DE is to EF, so is GE to EF (by the 11. of the fift). Wherefore either of these DE and EG haue to EF one and the same proportion. Wherefore (by the 9. of the fift) DE is equall vnto EG. And by the same reason also DF is equall vnto FG. Now forasmuch as DE is equall to EG and EF is common vnto them both, therefore these two sides DE &amp; EF, are equall vnto these two sides GE and EF, and ye base DF is equall vnto the base FG. Wherefore the angle DEF (by the 8. of the first) is equall vnto the angle GEF: and the triangle DEF (by the 4. of the first) is equall vnto the triangle GEF: and the rest of the angles of the one triangle

are equall vnto the rest of the angles of the other triangle the one to ye other, vnder which are subtended equall sides. Wherefore the angle DFE is equall vnto the angle GFE: and the angle EDF vnto the angle EGF. And because
                     •
                   the angle FED is equall vnto the angle GEF: but the angle GEF is equall vnto the angle ABC: therefore the angle ABC is also equall vnto the angle FED. And by the same reason the angle ACB is equall vnto ye angle DFE
                     •
                   and moreouer, the angle BAC vnto the angle EDF. Wherefore the triangle ABC is equiangle vnto the triangle DEF. If two triangles therefore haue their sides proportionall, the triangles shall be equiangle, &amp; those angles in them shall be equall, vnder which are subtended sides of like proportion: which was required to be demonstrated.
            
            
               The 6. Theoreme. The 6. Proposition. If there be two triangles wherof the one hath one angle equall to one angle of the other, &amp; the sides including the equall angles be proportionall: the triangles shall be equiangle, and those angles in them shall be equall, vnder which are subtended sides of like proportion.
               SVppose that there be two triangles ABC, and DEF, which let haue the angle BAC of the one triangle equall vnto the angle EDF of the other triangle, and let the sides including the equall angles be proportionall, that is, as BA is to AC, so let ED be to DF. Then I say, that ye triangle ABC is equiangle vnto the triangle DEF: and the angle ABC is equall vnto the angle DEF, and the angle ACB equall vnto the angle DFE, which 
                     •
                  ngles are subtēded to sides of like proportion.

                   an equall angle DFG. And forasmuch as the two angles BAC and ACB, are (by the 17. of the first) lesse then two right angles: therefore also the two angles EDG and DFG, are lesse then two right angles. Wherfore ye lines DG &amp; FG being produced, shall cōcurre (by the 5. petition). Let thē concurre in the point G. Wherefore DFG is a triangle.

Wherefore the angle remaining ABC is equall vnto the angle remaining DGF (by the 32. of the first). Wherefore the triangle ABC is equiangle vnto the triangle DGF. Wherefore as BA is in proportion to AC, so is GD to DF (by the 4. of the sixt). But it is supposed, that as BA is to AC, so is ED to DF. Wherefore (by the 11. of the fift) as ED is to DF, so is GD to DF. Wherefore (by the 9. of the fift) ED is equall vnto DG. And DF is common vnto them both. Now then there are two

sides ED and DF equall vnto two sides GD and DF: and the angle EDF (by supposition) is equall vnto the angle GDF. Wherefore (by the 4. of the first) the base EF is equall vnto the base GF, and the triangle DEF is (by the same) equall vnto the triangle GDF, and the other angles remayning in them are equall the one to the other, vnder which are subtended equall sides. Wherefore the angle DFG is equall vnto the angle DFE: and the angle DGF vnto the angle DEF. But the angle DFG is (by construction) equall vnto ye angle ACB. And the angle DGF is as it hath bene proued, equall to ye angle ABC. Wherfore also ye angle ACB is equall vnto the angle DFE. And ye angle ABC is equall to the angle DEF. But by supposition the angle BAC is equall vnto the angle EDF. Wherefore the triangle ABC is equiangle vnto the triangle DEF. If therefore there be two triangles, whereof the one hath one angle equall to one angle of the other, and if also the sides including the equall angles be proportionall: then shall the triangles also be equiangle, and those angles in them shalbe equall, vnder which are subtended sides of like proportion: which was required to be proued.
            
            
               The 7. Theoreme. The 7. Proposition. If there be two triāgles, wherof the one hath one angle equal to one angle of the other, and the sides which include the other angles, be proportionall, and if either of the other angles remayning be either lesse or not lesse then a right angle: thē shal the triangles be equiangle, and those angles in them shall be equall, which are contayned vnder the sides proportionall.
               
                  SVppose that there be two triangles ABC and DEF, which let haue one angle of the one, equall to one angle of the other, namely, the angle BAC equall vnto the angle EDF. And let the sides which include the other angles, namely, the angles ABC and DEF be proportionall, so that as AB is to BC, so let DE be to EF. And let the other angles remayning, namely, ACD and DFE be first either of them lesse then a right angle. Then I say that the triangle ABC is equiangle vnto the triangle DEF. And that the angle ABC is equall vnto the angle

DEF,The first part of this proposition. namely, the angles which are contained vnder the sides proportionall, and that the angle remayning, namely, ye angle C is equall vnto the angle remayning, namely, to ye angle F. For first the angle ABC is either equall to the angle DEF, or els vnequall. If the angle ABC be equall to the angle DEF,Demonstration leading to an impossibilitie. then the angle remaining, namely, ACB, shall be equall to the angle remayning DFE (by the corollary of the 32. of the first) And therfore the triangles ABC and DEF are equiangle. But if the angle ABC be vnequall vnto the angle DEF, then is the one of them greater then the other. Let the angle ABC be the greater, and vnto the right line AB and vnto the point in it B (by the 23. of the first) describe vnto the angle DEF an equall angle ABG. And forasmuch as the angle A is equall vnto the angle D, and the angle ABG is equall vnto the angle DEF, therfore the angle remayning AGB is equall vnto the angle remayning DFE (by the corollary of the 32. of the first. Wherfore the triangle ABG is equiangle vnto the triangle DEF. Wherfore (by the 4. of the sixth) as the side AB is to the side BG, so is the side DE to the side EF. But by suppposition the side DE is to the side EF, as the side AB is to the side BC. Wherfore (by the 11. of the fifth) as the side AB is to the side BC so is the same side AB to the side BG. Wherfore AB hath to either of these BC and BG one and the same proportion, and therfore (by the 9. of the fifth) BC is equall vnto BG. Wherefore (by the 5. of the first) ye angle BGC is equall vnto ye angle BCG: but by supposition ye angle BCG is lesse then a right angle. Wherfore the angle BGC is also lesse then a right angle. Wherfore (by the 13. of the first) the side angle vnto it, namely, AGB is greater then a right angle, and it is already proued that the same angle is equall vnto the angle F. Wherfore the angle F is also greater then a right angle. But it is supposed to be lesse which is absurde. Wherefore the angle ABC is not vnequall vnto the angle DEF, wherfore it is equall vnto it. And the angle A is equall vnto the angle D by supposition. Wherfore the angle remayning, namely, C, is equall vnto the angle remayning, namely, to F (by the corollary of the 32. of the first) Wherfore the triangle ABC is equiangle vnto the triangle DEF.The second part of this proposition.
               
               But now suppose that either of the angles ACB and DFE be not lesse then

a right angle. That is, let either of them be a right angle, or either of them greater then a right angle. Then I say againe that in that case also the triangle ABC is equiangle vnto the triangle DEF. For if either of them be a right angle, forasmuch as all right angles are (by the 4. peticion) equall the one to the other, straight way will follow the intent of the proposition. But if either of them be greater then a right angle, then the same order of construction that was before being kept, we may in like sort proue that the side BC is equall vnto the side BG. Wherfore also the angle BCG is equall vnto the angle BGC. But the angle BCG is greater then a right angle. Wherfore also the angle BGC is greater thē a right angle. Wherfore two angles of the triangle BGC are greater then two right angles: which (by the 17. of the first) is impossible. Wherfore the angle ABC is not vnequall vnto the angle DEF. And therfore is it equall: but the angle A is equall vnto the angle D (by supposition) Wherfore

the angle remayning, namely, C is equal vnto the angle remayning, namely, to F (by the corollary of the 32. of the first). Wherfore the triangle ABC is equiangle vnto the triangle DEF. If there
                     •
                  ore there be two triangles whero
                     •

                   the other, and the sides which include the other angle be proportionall, and if either of the other angles remaining be either lesse or not lesse then a right angle, the triangle shall be equiangle, and those angles in them shall be equall which are contained vnder sides proportionall: which was required to be proued.
            
            
               The 8. Theoreme. The 8. Proposition. If in a rectangle triangle be drawen from the right angle vnto the base a perpendicular line, the perpendicular line shall deuide the triangle into two triangles like vnto the whole, and also like the one to the other.
               
                  SVppose that there be a rectangle triangle ABC, whose right angle let be BAC: and (by the 12. of the first) from the point A to the line BC let there be drawen a perpendicular line AD,Construction. which perpendicular line let deuide the whole triangle ABC into these two triangles ABD and ADC. (Note that this perpendicular line AD, drawen from the right angle to the base, must needes fall within the triangle ABC, &amp; so deuide the triangle into two triangles. For if it should fall without, then producing the side BC vnto the perpendicular line, there should be made a triangle, whose outward angle being an acute angle, should be lesse then the inward and opposite angle which is a right angle: which is cōtrary to the 16. of the first.

Then I say, that either of these triangles

ABD and ADC, are like vnto the whole triangle ABC, and moreouer, that they are like the one to the other. First that the triangle ABD is like vnto the whole triangle ABC is thus proued.Demonstration. Forasmuch as (by the 4. petition) the angle BAC is equall vnto the angle ADB, for either of them is a right angle. And in the two triangles ABC and ABD the angle B is common. Wherefore the angle remayning, namely, ACB is (by the Corollary of the 32. of the first) equall vnto the angle remayning, namely, to BAD. Wherfore the triangle ABC is equiangle vnto the triangle ABD. Wherefore the sides which containe the equall angles, are (by the 4. of the sixt) proportionall. Wherfore as the side CB
                     •
                   which subtendeth ye right angle of the triangle ABC, is vnto the side BA which subtendeth the right angle of the triangle ABD, so is the same side AB which subtendeth the angle C of the triangle ABC, vnto the side BD which subtendeth ye angle BAD of the triangle ABD, which is equall vnto the angle C: and moreouer, the side AC vnto the side AD which subtend the angle B common to both the triangles. Wherfore the triangle ABC is like vnto the triangle ABD (by the 1. definition of the sixt). In like maner also may we proue, that the triangle ADC is like vnto the triangle ABC. For the right angle ADC is equall to the right angle BAC, &amp; the angle at the point C is common to either of those triangles. Wherefore the angle remayning, namely, DAC is equall to the angle remaining
                     •
                   namely, to ABC (by ye Corollary of the 32. of the first). Wherefore the triangles ABC &amp; ADC are equiangle. And therefore (by the 4. of the sixt) the sides which are about the equall angles are proportionall. Wherefore as in the triangle ABC the side BC is to the side CA, so in the triangle ADC is the side AC to the side DC: and againe, as in the triangle ABC the side CA is to the side AB, so in the triangle ADC is the side CD to the side DA. And moreouer, as in the triangle ABC the side CB is to the side BA, so in the triangle ADC is the side CA to the side AD. Wherefore the triangle ADC is like vnto the whole triangle ABC. Wherfore either of these triangles ABD, &amp; ADC is like vnto ye whole triangle ABC.
               I say also, that the triangles ABD and ADC are like the one to the other. For forasmuch as the right angle BDA is equall vnto ye right angle ADC (by the 4. petition) and as it hath already bene proued, the angle BAD is equall vnto the angle C: therefore the angle remayning, namely, B is equall vnto the angle remayning, namely, to DAC (by the Corollary of the 3
                     •
                  . of the first). Wherfore

the triangle ABD is equiangle vnto the triangle ADC. Wherefore as the side BD which in the triangle ABD subtendeth the angle BAD is vnto the side DA which in the triangle ADC subtendeth the angle C which is equall vnto the angle BAD, so is the side AD which in ye triangle ABD subtendeth the angle B, vnto the side DC which in the triangle ADC subtendeth the angle DAC which is equall vnto the angle B: and moreouer, so is the side BA vnto the side AC which subtende the right angles. Wherefore the triangle ABD is like vnto the triangle ADC. If therefore in a rectangle triangle be drawen from the right angle vnto the base a perpendicular line, the perpendicular line shall deuide the triangle into two triangles like vnto the whole, and also like the one to the other: which was required to be proued.
               
                  Corollary.
                  Hereby it is manifest, that if in a rectangle triangle be drawen from the right angle vnto the base a perpendicular line, the same line drawen is a meane proportionall betwene the sections of the base: and moreouer, betwene the whole base and either of the sections, the side annext to the sayd section is the meane proportionall. For is was proued, that as CD is to DA, so is DA to DB: and moreouer, as CB is to BA, so is BA to BD: and finally, as BC is to CA, so is CA to CD.

From ye point A draw a right line AC making with the line AB an angle: and in the line AC take a poynt at all aduentures, which let be D. And beginning at D put vnto AD two equall lines DE &amp; EC (by the 2. of the first). And draw a right line from B to C: and by the point D (by the

                  1. of the first) draw vnto BC a parallell line DF.Demonstration. Now forasmuch as vnto one of y• sides of the triangle ABC, namely, vnto ye side BC is drawen a parallell line FD, it followeth by ye 2. of this booke,

that as CD is in proportion vnto DA, so is BF to FA. But (by construction) CD is double to DA. Wherefore y• line BF is also double to the line FA. Wherfore the line BA is treble vnto the line AF. Wherfore from the right line
                     •
                   geuen AB, is cut of a third part appoynted, namely, AF: which was required to be done.

               SVppose that the right line geuen not deuided be AB, and the right lyne geuen being deuided, let be AC. It is required to deuide ye line AB which is not deuided like vnto the line AC which is deuided.Construction. Suppose the lyne AC be deuided in the pointes D and E, &amp; let y• lines AB &amp; AC so be put, that they make an angle at all aduentures, and draw a line from B to C, and by the pointes D and E draw vnto the line BC (by the 31. of the first) two parallel lines DF and EG: and by the point D vnto

the line AB (by the same) draw a parallel line DHK. Wherfore either of these figure
                     •
                   FH and HB are parallelogrammes. Wherfore the line DH is equall vnto the line FG, and the line HK is equall vnto the line GB.Demonstration. And because to one of the sides of the triangle DKC, namely, to the side KC is drawn a parallel line HE, therefore the line CE (by th
                     •
                   2. of the sixt) is in proportion vnto the line ED as the line KH is to the line HD: but the line KH is equall vnto the line BG, and the line HD is equal vnto the line GF. Wherfore (by the 11. of the fift) as CE is vnto ED, so is BG to GF. Agayne because to one of the sides of the triangle AGE, namely, to GE is drawn a parallel lyne FD, therfore the line ED (by the 2. of the sixth) is in proportion vnto the lyne DA, as the line GF is to the line FA. And it is already proued that as CE is to ED, so is BG to GF. VVherfore as CE is to ED, so is BG to GF, and as ED is to DA, so is GF to FA. VVherfore the right line geuen not deuided, namely, AB is deuided like vnto the right line geuen being deuided, which is AC: which was required to be done.

                        A Corollary out of Flussates.
                     
                  
                  By this Proposition we may deuide any right line geuen, accordyng to the proportion

of any right lynes geuen. For let those right lynes hauyng proportion be ioyned together directly, that they may make all one right lyne, and then ioyne them to the lyne geuen anglewise. And so proceede as in the proposition, where you see that the right line geuen AB is deuided into the right lynes AF, FG and GB which haue the selfe same proportion that the right lines AD, DE, and EC haue.
                  By this and the former proposition also may a right line geuen be easily deuided into what partes so euer you will name.
                        By this and the former propo

                           ition may a right line be deuided into what partes soeuer you will.
                      As if you will deuide the line AB into three equall partes, let the lyne DE be made equall to the lyne AD, and the lyne EC made equall to the same by the third of the first. And then vsing the selfe same maner of construction that was before: the lyne AB shall be deuided into three equall partes. And so of any kynde of partes whatsoeuer.

               SVppose that there be two right lines geuen BA and AC, and let them be so put that they comprehend an angle howsoeuer it be. It is required to finde vnto BA and vnto AC a third line in proportion.Construction. Produce ye lynes AB and AC vnto the pointes D and E. And vnto the

line AC (by the 2. of the first) put an equall line BD, and draw a lyne from B to C. And by the pointe D (by the 31. of the first) draw vnto the lyne BC a parallel lyne DE, which let concurre with the line AC in the point E.Demonstration. Now forasmuch as vnto one of the sides of the triangle ADE, namely, to DE is drawne a parallel line BC: therfore as AB is in proportion vnto BD, so (by the 2. of the sixt) is AC vnto CE. But the lyne BD is equall vnto the line AC. VVherfore as the lyne AB is to the line AC, so is the line AC to the line CE. VVherfore vnto the two right lines geuen AB and AC is found a third line CE in proportiō with them: which was required to be done.

                      Then frō the point A erect the lyne AD makyng with the lyne AB an angle at all aduentures. And put the lyne AD equall to the lyne BC. And draw a right line from D to B which produce beyond the poynt B vnto the point E. And by the point C draw vnto the lyne DA a parallel lyne CE concurring with the lyne DE in the point E.

as by the 15. of the first, the angle B of the

triangle ABD is equall to the angle B of the triangle CBE, and by the 29. of the same, the angle A is equall to the angle C, and the angle D to the angle E: therefore by the 4. of this booke AB is to DA, as BC is to CE. Wherfore (by the 11. of the fifth) AB is to BC as BC is to CE: which was required to be done.

And drawe a line from A to C, and from the point C drawe vnto the line AC a perpendicular CD (by the 11. of the first) And produce the lyne CD till it concurre with the line AB produced vnto the pointe D.

Let there be taken two right lines DE &amp; DF comprehending an angle as it shall happen, namely, EDF.Construction. And (by the 2. of the first) vnto the line A put an equall line DG.

put an equall line GE. And moreouer, vnto ye line C put an equall line DH. Then draw a line frō G to H. And by the poynt E (by the 31. of the first) draw vnto the line GH a parallell line EF. Now forasmuch as vnto one of the sides of the triangle DEF,Demonstration. namely, vnto y• side EF is drawen a parallell line GH: therefore (by the 2. of the sixt) as the line DG is to the line GE, so is the line DH to the line HF.

But the line DG is equall vnto the line A, and the line GE is equall vnto the line B, and the line DH vnto the line C. Wherfore as the line A is vnto the line B, so is the line C vnto the line HF.

Then by the point D draw the lyne DE parallel to the line AC, which produce vntill it concurre in the point E, with the line CB being likewise produced to the point E.

                        A proposition added by Pelitarius.
                      
                     Now it behoueth that the meane geuen be not greater then the halfe of the lyne geuen.
                  
                  Suppose that the meane geuen be AB, and let the right line geuen be BC. It is required in the line BC to finde out two extremes, betwene which AB shal be the mean
                        •
                      proportionall. So that yet the lyne AB be not greater then the halfe part of the line BC. For so could it not be a meane. Ioyne the lines AB and BC directly in such sort, that they both make one right line, namely,

                     AC. Then vppon the line BC describe the semicircle BEC. And from the point A erect vnto the lyne AC a perpendicular line AD: which lyne AD put equal vnto the line AB. And by the point D draw vnto the line AC a parallel line DE, which vndoubtedly shall either cut or touch the semicircle, as in the point E, for that the line AD is not greater then the semidiameter. Then from the point E draw vnto the line BC a perpendicular line EF (by the 12. of the first) Then I say that the line BC is so deuided in the point F, that the lyne AB is a meane proportionall betwene the lines BF and FC. Which thing is manifest (by the 31. of the third) &amp; corollary of the 8. of this booke. For the line FE is equal to the line AD by the 34. of the first, and so is equall to the line AB: then if we draw the ryght lines BE and CE, there shall be made a rectangle triangle BEC. And so by the sayd corollary, the line BF shall be to the lyne FE (and therfore to the line AB) as the line FE is to the lyne FC: which was required to be done.

               The 9. Theoreme. The 14. Proposition. In equall parallelogrammes which haue one angle of the one equall vnto one angle of the other, the sides shall be reciprokall, namely, those sides which containe the equall angles. And if parallelogrammes which hauing one angle of the one, equal vnto one angle of the other, haue also their sides reciprokal, namely, those which contayne the equall angles, they shall also be equall.
               SVppose that there be two equall Parallelogrammes AB and BC, hauing the angle B of the one equall vnto the angle B of the other.The first part of this proposition. And let the lines DB and DE be set directly in such sort that they both make one right line, namely, DE. And then (by the 14. of the first) shall the lines FB and BG be so set that they shall make also one right line, namely, GF. Then I say, that the sides of the parallelogrammes AB and BC, which containe the equall

angles, are reciprocally proportionall: that is, as BD is to BE, so is GB to BF. Make complete the parallelogramme FE by producing the sides AF and CE, till they concurre in the poynt H. Now forasmuch as the parallelogramme AB is (by supposition) equall vnto the parallelogramme BC, and there is a certaine other parallelogramme FE:Demonstration of the of the same. therfore (by the 7. of the fift) as the parallelogrāme AB is to the parallelogramme FE, so

is the parallelogramme BC to the parallelogramme FE. But as the parallelogramme AB is to ye parallelogramme FE, so is the side DB to the side BE (by the first of this booke). And (by the same) as the parallelogramme BC is to the parallelogramme FE, so is the side GB to the side BF. Wherefore also (by the 11. of the fift) as the side DB is to the side BE, so is the side GB to the side BF. Wherefore in the parallelogrammes AB and BC the sides which containe the equall angles, are reciprokally proportionall: which was first required to be proued.
               But now suppose that the sides about the equall angles be reciprokally proportionall so that as the side DB is to the side BE,The second part which is the conuerse of the first. so let the side GB be to the side BF. Then I say, yt the parallelogramme AB is equall vnto ye parallelogramme BC. For, for that as the side DB is to the side BE, so is the side GB to the side BF: but as the side DB is to the side BE, so (by the 1. of the sixt) is the parallelogramme AB to the parallelogramme FE: and as the side GB is to the side BF, so is the parallelogramme BC to the parallelogramme FE. Wherefore also (by the 11. of the fift) as the parallelogramme AB is to the parallelogrāme FE, so is the parallelogramme BC to the same parallelogramme FE. Wherefore the parallelogramme AB is equall vnto the parallelogramme BC (by the 9. of the fift). Wherefore in equall and equiangle parallelogrammes the sides which containe the equall angles are reciprokall: and if in equiangle parallelogrammes the sides which containe the equall angles be reciprokall, the parallelogrammes also shall be equall: which was required to be proued.

And those triāgles which hauyng one angle of the one equall vnto one angle of the other, haue also

               SVppose that there be two equall triangles ABC, and ADE hauing one angle of the one equall vnto one angle of the other, namely, the angle BAC equall vnto the angle DAE.

shal both make one right line (by the 14. of the first) And draw a line from B to D. Now forasmuch as (by supposition) the triangle ABC is equall vnto the triangle ADE.Demonstration of the same. And there is a certaine other triangle BAD, vnto which the two equall triangles being compared, it will follow by the 7. of the fifth, that as the triangle ABC is vnto the triangle BAD, so is ye triangle EAD to the same triangle BAD. But as the triangle ABC is to the triā
                  gle BAD, so by the 1. of the sixth, is the base CA to the base AD: and as the triangle EAD is to the triangle BAD, so (by the same) is the base EA to the base AB. Wherfore (by the 11. of the fifth) as the side CA is to the side AD, so is the side EA to the side AB. Wherefore in the triangles ABC and ADE the sides which include the equall angles are reciprokally proportionall.
               But now suppose that in the triangles ABC and ADE, the sides which include the equall angles, be reciprokally proportionall,The second part which is the conuerse of the first. so that as the side CA is to the side AD, so let the side EA be to the side AB. Then I say that the triangle ABC is equall vnto the triangle ADE. For agayne draw a line from B to D. And for that as the line CA is to the line AD, so is the line EA to the line AB, but as the line CA is to the line AD, so is the triangle ABC to the triangle BAD, and as the line EA is to the line AB so is the triangle EAD to the triangle BAD. Wherfore as the triangle ABC is to the triangle BAD so is the triangle EAD to ye same triangle BAD. Wherfore either of these triangles ABC and EAD haue vnto y• triangle BAD one and y• selfe same proportion. Wherfore (by the 9. of the fifth) the triangle ABC is equal vnto the triangle EAD. If therfore there be taken equall triangles hauyng one angle of the one equal vnto one angle of the other, those sides in them shal be reciprokal, which include the equal angles. and those triangles which hauing one angle of the one equall vnto one angle of the other, haue also their sides which include the equall angles reciprokal, shal also be equall: which was required to be proued.

From the poynt A (by the 11. of the first) raise vp vnto the right line AB a perpendicular line AG. And (by the same) from the point C vnto the right line CD raise vp a perpendicular line CH. And (by the 2. of the first) put the line AG equall vnto the line F, and put also ye line CH equall vnto the line E, and make complete the parallelogrammes GB and HD. Now for that by supposition as the line AB is to the line CD, so is the line E to the line F. But the line E is equall vnto the line CH, &amp; the line F vnto the line AG, therefore as the line AB is to the line CD, so is the line CH to the line AG. Wherefore in the

parallelogrāmes BG and DH the sides which include ye equall angles, are reciprokally proportionall. But equiangle parallelogrammes whose sides which include the equall angles, are reciprokall, are also equall (by the 14. of the sixt). Wherefore the parallelogramme BG is equall vnto the parallelogrāme DH. But the parallelogramme BG is that which is contayned vnder the lines AB and F, for the line AG is put equall vnto the line F. And the parallelogramme DH is that which is contained vnder the lines CD and E, for the line CH is put equall vnto the line E. Wherefore the rectangle figure contained vnder the lines AB and F, is equall vnto the rectangle figure contayned vnder the lines CD and E.The second part which is the conuerse of the first.
               
               But now suppose that the rectangle figure comprehended vnder the lines AB and F, be equall vnto the rectangle figure cōprehended vnder ye lines CD &amp; E.

Then I say, that the foure right lines AB, CD, E and F, are proportionall, that is, as the line AB is to the line CD, so is the line E to the line F. The same order of construction that was before being kept, forasmuch as that which is contained vnder the lines AB and F is equall vnto that which is contained vnder the lines CD and E, but that which is contayned vnder the lines AB and F is the parallelogramme BG, for the line AG is equall vnto the line F. And that also which is contained vnder the lines CD &amp; E is the parallelogramme DH, for the line CH is equall vnto the line E. Wherefore the parallelogramme BG is equall vnto the parallelogramme DH, &amp; they are also equiangle. But in parallelogrammes equall &amp; equiangle the sides which include the equall angles are reciprokall (by the 14. of the sixt). Wherfore as the line AB is to the line CD, so is the line CH to the line AG, but the line CH is equall vnto the line E, and the line AG is equall vnto ye line F. Wherefore as the line AB is to the line CD, so is the line E to the line F. If therefore there be foure right lines in proportion, the rectangle figure comprehended vnder the extremes, is equall to the rectangle figure contayned vnder the meanes.

the extremes is equall vnto the rectangle figure comprehended vnder the meanes (by the 16. of the sixt). Wherfore that which is contained vnder the lines A and C is equall vnto that which is comprehended vnder the lines B and D.

Wherefore that which is contayned vnder the lines A and C is equall vnto that which is contayned vnder the lines B and D. But if the rectangle figure comprehended vnder the extremes, be equall vnto the rectangle figure comprehended vnder the meane lynes, the foure right lines shall be proportionall (by the 16. of the sixth) Wherfore as the line A is to the line B, so is the line D to the line C. But the line B is equall vnto the lyne D. Wherfore as the line A is to the lyne B, so is B to the line C. If therefore there be three right lynes in proportion, the rectangle figure comprehended vnder the extremes, is equall vnto the square that is made of the meane. And if the rectangle figure which is contayned vnder the extremes, be equall vnto the square made of the meane, then are those three right lines proportional: which was required to be demonstrated.

               SVppose the triangles like to be ABC and DEF, hauing the angle B of the one triangle, equal vnto the angle E of the other triangle, &amp; as AB is to BC, so let DE be to EF, so that let BC &amp; EF be sides of like proportion. Then I say that the proportion of the triangle ABC vnto the triangle DEF is double to the proportion of the side BC to the side EF. Vnto the two lines BC and EF (by the 10. of the sixth) make a third lyne in proportion BG, so that as BC is to EF, so let EF be to BG, and draw a lyne from A to G. Now forasmuch as AB is to BC, as DE is to EF, therfore alternately (by the 16. of the fifth) as AB is to DE, so is BC to EF.Demonstration. But as BC is to EF, so is EF to BG, wherfore also (by the

                  11. of the fifth) as AB is to DE, so is EF to BG. Wherfore the sides of the triangles ABG &amp; DEF, which include ye equal angles are reciprokally proportionall. But if in triangles hauing one angle of the one equall to one angle of ye other, the sides which include ye equall angles, be reciprokal, the triangles also (by ye 15. the sixth) shal be equall. Wherfore the triangle ABG is equall vnto ye triangle DEF. And for yt as y• line BC is to ye line EF, so is the line EF to ye line BG: but if there be three lines in proportion, the first shall haue to the third double proportion that it hath to the second (by the 10. definition of the fifth) therfore the line BC hath vnto the line BG double proportion that it hath to the line EF. But as BC is to BG, so (by the 1. of the sixth) is the triangle ABC to the triangle ABG. Wherfore the tiangle ABC is vnto the triangle ABG in double proportion that the side BC is to the side EF. But the triangle ABG is equall to the triangle DEF. Wherfore also the triangle ABC is vnto the triangle DEF in double proportion that the side BC is to the side EF. Wherfore lyke triangles are one to the other in double proportion that the sides of like proportion are: which was required to be proued.
               
                  Corollary.
                  
                     A Corollary.Hereby it is manifest that if there be three right lines in proportion, as the first is to the third, so is the triangle described vpon the first, vnto the triangle described vpon the second, so that the sayd triangles be like, and in lyke 
                        •
                     ort described, for it hath bene proued that as the lyne CB is to the line BG, so

is the triangle ABC to the triangle DEF: which was required to be demonstrated.
               
            
            
               The 14. Theoreme. The 20. Proposition. Like Poligonon figures, are deuided into like triangles and equall in number, and of like proportion to the whole. And the one Poligonon fig
                     •
                  re is to the other Poligonon figure in double proportion that one of the sides of like proportion is to one of the sides of like proportion.
               SVppose yt the like Poligonon figures be ABCDE, &amp; FGHKL, hauing the angle at the point F equall to the angle at the point A, and the angle at the point 
                     •
                   equall to the angle at the point B, and the angle at the point H equall to y• angle at the point C: and so of the rest. And moreouer, as the side AB is to the side BC, so let the side FG be to the side GH, and as the side BC is to the side CD, so let the side GH be to the side HK and so forth. And let the sides AB &amp; FG be sides of like proportion. Then I

say first,The first par
                        •
                      of this Theoreme. that these Poligonon figures ABCDE &amp; FGHKL, are deuided into like triangles and equall in number. For draw these right lines, AC, AD, FH, &amp; FK
                     •
                   And forasmuch as (by supposition, that is, by reason the figure ABCDE is like vnto the figure FGHKL) the angle B is equall vnto the angle G, and as the side AB is to the side BC, so is the side FG to the side GH, it followeth that the two triangles ABC and FGH haue one angle of the one equall to one angle of the other, and haue also the sides about the equall angles proportionall. Wherefore (by the 6. of the sixt) the triangle ABC is equiangle vnto the triangle FGH. And those angles in thē are equall, vnder which are subtended sides of like proportion: namely, the angle BAC is equall to the angle GFH, and the angle BCA to the angle GHF. Wherefore (by the 4. of the sixt) the sides which are about the equall angles are proportionall: and the sides which are subtended

vnder the equall angles are of like proportion. Wherfore as AC is to BC, so is FH to GH. But by supposition as BC is to CD, so is GH to HK. Wherefore of equalitie (by the 22. of the fift) as AC is to CD, so is FH to HK. And forasmuch as by supposition the whole angle BCD is equall to the whole angle GHK, and it is proued that the angle BCA is e
                     ••
                  all to the angle GHF: therefore the angle remayning ACD is equall to the angle remayning FHK (by the 3. common sentence). Wherefore the 
                     •
                  ria
                     •
                  gl
                     •
                  s ACD, and FHK, haue againe one angle of the one equall to one angle of the other, and the sides which are about the equall sides are proportionall. Wherefore (by the 
                     •
                  ame sixt of this booke) the triangles ACD &amp; FHK are equiangle. And (by the 4. of this booke) the sides, which are about the equall angles 
                     〈◊〉
                   proportionall. And by the same reason may we proue that the triangle AD
                     •
                   is equiangle vnto the triangle FKL. And that the sides which are about the equall angles are proportionall. Wherefore the triangle ABC is like to ye triangle FGH, and the triangle ACD to the triangle FHK, and also the triangle ADE to the triangle FKL (by the first definition of this sixt booke). Wherfore the Poligonon figures geuen ABCDE, and FGHKL, are deuided into triangles like and equall in number.
               
                  The second part demonstrated.I say moreouer, that the triangles are the one to the other, and to the whole Poligonon figures proportionall: that is, as the triangle ABC is to the triangle FGH, so is the triangle ACD to the triangle FHK, and ye triangle ADE to the triangle FKL: and as the triangle ABC is to the triangle FGH, so is the Poligonon figure ABCDE to the Poligonon figure FGHKL. For forasmuch as the triangle ABC is like to the triangle FGH, and AC and FH are sides of like proportion, therfore the proportion of the triangle ABC to the triangle

FGH is double to the proportion of the side AC to the 
                     〈◊〉
                   FH (by ye former Proposition). And therefore also the proportion of the triangle ACD to the triangle FKH, is double to the proportion that the same side AC hath to the side FH. Wherefore (by the 11. of the fift) as the triangle ABC is to the triangle FGH, so is the triangle ACD to the triangle FHK. Againe, forasmuch as the triangle ACD is like to the triangle FHK, and the sides AD &amp; FK are of like proportion: therefore the proportion of the triangle ACD to the triangle FHK

is double to the proportion of the side AD to the side FK (by the foresayd 19. of the sixt). And by the same reason the proportion of the triangle ADE to ye triangle FKL, is double to the proportion of the same side AD to the side FK. Wherfore (by the 11. of the fift) as the triangle ACD is to the triangle FHK, so is the triangle ADE to the triangle FKL. But as the triangle ACD is to the triangle FHK, so is it proued that the triangle ABC is to the triangle FGH. Wherefore also (by the 11. of the fift) as the triangle ABC is to the triangle FGH, so is the triangle ADE to the triangle FKL. Wherefore the foresayd triangles are proportionall: namely, as ABC is to FGH, so is ACD to FHK, and ADE to FKL. Wherefore (by the 12. of the fift) as one of the antecedentes is to one of the consequentes, so are all the antecedentes to all the consequentes. Wherefore as the triangle ABC is to the triangle FGH, so is the Poligonon figure ABCDE to the Poligonon figure FGHKL. Wherfore the triangles are proportionall both the one to the other, &amp; also to the whole Poligonon figures.
               Lastly I say,The third part. that the Poligonon figure ABCDE hath to the Poligonon figure FGHKL a double proportion to that which the side AB hath to the side FG: which are sides of like proportion. For it is proued, that as the triangle ABC is to the triangle FGH, so is the Poligonon figure ABCDE to the Poligonon figure FGHKL. But the triangle ABC hath to the triangle FGH a double proportion to that which the side AB hath to the side FG (by the former 19. Proposition of this booke): for it is proued, that ye triangle ABC is like to the triangle FGH. Wherefore the proportion of the Poligonon figure ABCDE to the Poligonon figure FGHKL is double to the proportion of the side AB to the side FG: which are sides of like proportion. Wherefore like Poligonon figures are deuided. &amp;c. as before
                     •
                   which was required to be proued.
               
                  The first Corollary.
                  Hereby it is manifest, that all like rectiline figures what soeuer, are the one to the other in double proportion that the sides of like proportion are.The first Corollary. For any like rectiline figures whatsoeuer are by this Proposition deuided into like triangles and equall in number.
               
               
                  The second Corollary.
                  Hereby also it is manifest, that if there be three right lines proportionall,The second Corollary. as the first is to the third, so is the figure described vppon the first to the figure described vpon the second, so that the sayd figures be like and in like sort described.

For it is proued, that the proportion of the Poligonon figure ABCDE to the Poligonon figure FGHKL is double to ye proportion of the side AB to the side FG. And if (by the 11. of the sixt) vnto the lines AB and FG we take a third line in proportion, namely, MN, the first line, namely, AB shall haue vnto the third line, namely, to MN, double proportion that it hath to the second line, namely, to FG (by the 10. definition of the fift). Wherfore as ye line AB is to the line MN, so is the rectiline figure ABC to the rectiline figure FGH, the sayd rectiline figures being like &amp; in like sort described.
               
            
            
               The 15. Theoreme. The 21. Proposition. Rectiline figures which are like vnto one and the same rectiline figure, are also like the one to the other.
               SVppose there be two rectiline figures A and B like vnto the rectiline figure C. Then I say that the figure A is also like vnto the figure B. For forasmuch as the figure A is like vnto the figure C,Demonstration. it is also equiangle vnto it (by the conuersion of the first definition of the sixth) &amp; the sides including the equall angles

shall be proportionall. Agayne forasmuch as the figure B is like vnto the figure C, it is also (by the same definition) equiangle vnto it, and the sides about the equall angles are proportionall. Wherfore both these figures A and B are equiangle vnto the figure C, and the sides about the equall angles are proportionall. Wherfore (by the first common sentence) the figure A is equiangle vnto the figure B, and the sides about the equall angles are proportionall, wherfore the figure B is like vnto the figure A, which was required to be proued.
            
            
               The 16. Theoreme. The 22. Proposition. If there be foure right lines proportionall, the rectiline figures also described vpon them beyng lyke, and in like sorte situate, shall be proportional. And if the rectiline figures vppon them described be proportional, those right lynes also shall be proportionall.
               
                  SVppose there be foure right lines AB, CD, EF, and GH, and as AB is to CD, so let EF be to GH. And vpon the lines AB and CD (by the 1
                     •
                  . of the sixth) let there be described two rectiline figures KAB, and LCD like the one to the other, and in like sort situate. And vpon the lynes EF and GH (by the same) let there be described also two rectiline figures MF and NH like the one to the other, and in like sorte situate.The first part of this proposition. Then I say that as the 
                     •
                  igure KAB is

to the figure LCD, so is the figure MF to the figure NH. Vnto the lines AB and CD (by the 11. of the sixth) make a third lyne in proportion, namely, O: and vnto the lines EF and GH in like sort make a third lyne in a line proportion, namely, P. And for that as the line AB is to the line CD, so is the line EF to the line GH, but as the line CD is to the line O, so is the line GH to the lyne P. Wherfore of equality (by the 22. of the fifth) as the lyne AB is vnto the line O, so is the lyne EF to the line P. But as the line AB is to the line O, so is the figure KAB to the figure LCD (by the second corollary of the 20. of the sixth). And as the line EF is to the lyne P, so is the figure M F to the figure NH. Wherefore (by the 11. of the fifth) as the figure KAB is to the figure LCD, so is the figure M F to the figure NH.
               But now suppose that as the figure KAB is to the figure LCD,The second part which is the conuerse of the first. so is the figure M F to the figure NH, then I say that as the line AB is to the line CD, so is the line EF to the line GH. As the line AB is to the lyne CD, so (by the 1
                     •
                  . of the sixth) let the lyne EF be to the lyne QR, and vpon the lyne QR (by the 18. of the sixth) describe vnto either of these figures MF and NH a like figure, and in like sort situate SR. Now forasmuch as the lyne AB is to the lyne CD, so is the lyne EF to the line QR, and vpon the lines AB and CD are described two figures lyke, and in like sort situate KAB and LCD, and vpon the lines EF and QR are described also two figures like, and in like sort situate MF and SR, therfore as the figure KAB is to the figure LCD, so is the figure MF to the figure SR: wherfore also (by the 11. of the fifth) as the figure MF is to the figure SR, so is the figure MF to the figure NH, wherfore the figure

M F hath to either of these figures NH, and SR one and the same proportion, wherfore by the 9. of the fifth, the figure NH is equal vnto the figure SR. And it is vnto it like, and in like sort situate. Note that this is proued in the assumpt following. But in like and equall rectiline figures beyng in like sort situate, the sides of like proportion on which they are described are equall. Wherfore ye line GH is equall vnto the line QR. And because as the lyne AB is to the line CD, so is the line EF to the line QR, but the line QR is equall vnto the line GH, therfore as the line AB is to he line CD, so is the line EF to the line GH.

If therefore there be foure right lines proportionall, the rectiline figures also described vpon them beyng like and in lyke sort situate shall be proportionall And if the rectiline figures vpon them described beyng like and in like sort situate be proportionall, those right lines also shall be proportional: which was required to be proued.
               
                  An Assumpt.
                  And now that in like and equall figures, being in like sort situate, the sides of like proportion are also equall (which thing was before in this proposition taken as graunted) may thus be proued.An Assumpt. Suppose yt the rectiline figures NH and SR be equall and like, and as HG is to GN, so let RQ be to QS, and let GH and QR be sides of like proportion. Then I say that the side RQ is equall vnto the side GH. For if they be vnequall, the one of them is greater then the other, let the side RQ be greater then the side HG. And for that as the line RQ is to the line QS, so is the line HG to the line GN, and alternately also (by the 16. of the fifth) as the line RQ is to the line HG, so is the line QS, to the lyne GN, but the line RQ is greater then the line HG. Wherfore also the line QS is greater then ye line GN. Wherefore also ye figure RS is greater then the figure HN but (by supposition) it is equall vnto it, which is impossible. Wherfore ye line QR is not greater then ye line GH. In like sorte also may we proue that it is not lesse then it, wherfore it is equall vnto it: which was required to be proued.

                        0. of this boke, thus. Forasmuch as the rectiline figures are by supposition in one and the same proportion, and the same proportion is double to the proportion of the sides AB to CD, and EF to GH (by the foresaid corollary) the proportion also of the sides shall be one and the selfe same (by the 7. common sentence) namely, the line AB shall be vnto the line CD as the line EF is to the line GH.
                  
               
            
            
               The 17. Theoreme. The 23. Proposition. Equiangle Parallelogrammes haue the one to the other that proportion which is composed of the sides.
               SVppose the equiangle Parallelogrammes to be AC and CF, hauing the angle BCD of the one equall to the angle ECG of the other. Then I say, that the parallelogramme AC is vnto the parallelogramme CF in that proportion which is composed of the proportion of their sides, that is, of that which the side BC hath to the side CG, and of that which the side DC hath to the side CE. Let the lines BC and CG be so put that they both make one right line (by the 14. of the first). Wherefore

(by the same) the lines DC and CE shall make also one right line. Make complete the parallelogramme DG by producing the sides AD and FG till they concurre in the point H, and let there be put a certaine right line K. And as the line BC is to the line CG, so (by the 12. of the sixt) put vnto the line K a line in the same proportion which let be L
                     •
                   and as DC is to CE, so vnto L put a line in the same proportion, namely, M. Wherefore the proportions of the lines K to L, and L to M, are one and ye same with the proportions of the sides BC to CG, and D
                     •
                   to CE: but the proportion of K to M, is composed of the proportions of K to L, &amp; L to M:Demonstration. Wherefore the proportion of K to M, is composed of the proportions of the sides BC to CG, &amp; EC to CD. And for that as the line BC is to the line CG, so is the parallelogramme AC to the parallelogrāme CH (by the 1. of the sixt). But as the line BC is to the line CG, so is the line K to the line L. Wherefore also (by the 11. of the fift) as the line K is to the line L
                     •
                   so is the parallelogramme AC to the parallelogramme CH. Againe, for that as the line DC is to the line CE, so is the parallelogramme CH to the parallelogramme CF: but as the line DC is to the line CE, so is the line L to the line M: Wherefore also (by ye same) as the line L is to the line M, so is the parallelogramme CH to the parallelogramme CF. And forasmuch as it is proued, that as the line K is to the line L, so is the parallelogramme AC to the parallelogramme CH, and as the line L is to the line M, so is the parallelogramme CH to the parallelogramme CF: therfore of equalitie (by the 22. of the fift) as the line K is to the line M, so i
                     •
                   the parallelogramme AC to the parallelogramme CF. But as it hath before bene proued, the proportion of the line K to the line M, is composed of the proportions of

the sides BC to CG, and DC to CE. Wherefore also the proportion of the parallelogramme AC to the parallelogramme CF, is composed of the proportions of the sides BC to CG, and DC to CE. Wherefore equiangle parallelogrammes haue the one to the other that proportion which is composed of the proportions of the sides: which was required to be proued.
               Flussates demonstrateth this Theoreme without taking of these three lines, K, L, M, after this maner.
               
               
                  An other demonstration after flussates.
                  Forasmuch as (sayth he) it hath bene declared vpon the 10. definition of the fift booke, and 
                        •
                     ift definition of this booke, that the proportions of the extremes consist of the proportions of the meanes, let vs suppose two equiangle parallelogrāmes ABGD, and GEZI, and let the angles at the poynt G in eyther be equall. And let the lines BG and GI be set directly that they both make one

right line, namely, BGI. Wherefore EGD also shall be one right line by the conuerse of the 15. of the first. Make complete the parallelogramme GT. Then I say, that the proportion of the parallelogrammes AG &amp; GZ is composed of the proportions of the sides BG to GI, and DG to GE. For forasmuch as that there are three magnitudes, AG, GT, and GZ, and GT is the meane of the sayd magnitudes: and the proportion of the extremes AG to GZ consisteth of the meane proportions (by the 5. definition of this booke) namely, of the proportion of AG to GT, and of the proportion GT to GZ: But the proportion of AG to GT is one and the selfe same with the proportion of the sides BG to GI (by the first of this booke). And the proportion also of GT to GZ is one and the selfe same with the proportion of the other sides, namely, DG to GE (by the same Proposition). Wherefore the proportion of the parallelogrammes AG to GZ consisteth of the proportions of the sides BG to GI, and DC to GE. Wherefore equiangle parallelogrammes are the one to the other in that proportion which is composed of theyr sides: which was required to be proued.
               
            
            
               The 18. Theoreme. The 24. Proposition. In euery parallelogramme, the parallelogrammes about the dimecient are lyke vnto the whole, and also lyke the one to the other.
               
                  Demonstration of this propositiō wherein is first proued that the parallegramme EG is like to the whole parallelogrāme ABCD.SVppose yt there be a parallelogramme ABCD, and let the dimecient therof be AC: and let the parallelogrammes about the dimecient AC, be EG and HK. Then I say that either of these parallelogrames EG and HK is like vnto the whole parallelogramme ABCD, and also are lyke the one to the other. For forasmuch as to one of the sides of the triangle ABC, namely, to BC is drawen a parallel lyne EF, therfore as BE is to EA, so (by the 2. of the sixt) is CF to FA. Agayne forasmuch as to one of ye sides

of the triangle ADC, namely, to CD is drawen a parallel lyne F
                     •
                  , therefore (by the same) as CF is to FA, so is DG to GA. But as CF is to FA, so is it pro
                     •
                  ued that BE is to EA. Whe
                     •
                  fore as BE is to EA, so (by the 11. of the fifth)
                     •
                   is DG to GA. Wherfore by composition (by the 18. of the fifth) as BA is to AE
                     •
                   so is DA to AG. And alternately (by the 16. of the fifth) as BA is to AD, so is EA to AG. Wherfore in the parallelogrammes
                     •
                   ABCD and EG ye sides which are about the common angle BAD are proportionall. And because ye line GF is a parallel vnto the lyne DC
                     •
                   therfore the angle AGF (by the 29

                   ye
                  
angle GFA equall vnto ye angle DCA and the angle DAC is common to the two triangles ADC and AFG: Wherfore the triangle DAC is equiangle vnto the triangle AGF. And by the same reason the triangle ABC is equiangle vnto the triangle AEF. Wherfore the whole parallelogramme ABCD is equiangle vnto the parallelogrāme EG. Wherfore as AD is in proportion to DC, so (by the 4. of the sixth) is AG to GF, and as DC is to CA, so is GF to FA. And as AC is to CB, so is AF to FE. And moreouer as CB is to BA, so is FE to EA. And forasmuch as it is proued that as D
                     •
                   is to CA, so is GF to FA: but as AC is to C
                     •
                  , so is AF to FE. Wherfore of equalitie (by the 22. of the fifth) as DC is to CB, so is GF to FE. Wherefore in the parallelogrammes ABCD and EG, the sides which include the equall angles are proportionall. Wherefore the parallelogramme ABCD is (by the first definition of the sixth) like vnto the parallelogramme EG.
               And by the same reason also the parallelogramme ABCD is like to the parallelogramme KH:That the parallelogrāme KH is like to the whole parallelogramme ABCD. wherefore either of these parallelogrammes EG and KH is like vnto the parallelogramme ABCD. But rectiline figures which are like to one and the same rectiline figure are also (by the 21. of the sixth) like the one to the other. Wherefore the parallelogramme EG is like to the parallelogramme HK.That the parallelogrammes EG and KH are like the one to the other. Wherfore in euery parallelogramme, the parallelogrammes about the dimecient are like vnto the whole, and also like the one to the other. Which was required to be proued.

like the one to the other. For forasmuch as BD, EK,
                     
and TI are parallelogrammes, therefore the right line AZG falling vpon these parallell lines AEB, KZT, and DI G, or vpon these parallell lines AKD, EZI, and BTG, maketh these angles equall the one to the other, namely, the angle EAZ to the angle KZA, &amp; the angle EZA to the angle KAZ, and the angle TZG to the angle ZGI, and the angle TGZ to the angle IZG, and the angle BAG to the angle AGD: and finally, the angle BGA to the angle DAG. Wherefore (by the first Corollary of the 32. of the first, and by the 34. of the first) the angles remayning are equall the one to the other, namely, the angle B to the angle D, and the angle E to the angle K, and the angle T to the angle I. Wherefore these triangles are equiangle and therefore like the one to the other, namely, the triangle ABG to the triangle GDA, and the triangle AEZ to the triangle ZKA, &amp; the triangle ZTG to the triangle GIZ. Wherefore as the side AB is to the side BG, so is the side AE to the side EZ, and the side ZT to the side TG. Wherefore the parallelogrammes contayned vnder those right lines, namely, the parallelogrammes ABGD, EK, &amp; TI, are like the one to the other (by the first definition of this booke). Wherefore in euery parallelogramme the parallelogrammes. &amp;c. as before: which was required to be demonstrated.

                        An addition of Pelitarius.
                     Suppose that the two equiangle parallelogrammes be ABCD and CEFG, which let not be like the one to the other. It is required from the Parallelogramme ABCD, to cut of a parallelogramme like vnto the parallelogramme CEFG. Let the angle C of the one be equall to the angle C of the other. And let the two parallelogrammes be so 
                        〈◊〉
                     , that the lines BC &amp; CG may make both

one right line, namely, BG. Wherefore also the right lines DC and CE shall both make one right line, namely, DE. And drawe a line from the poynt F to the poynt C, and produce the line FC till it cōcurre with the line AD in the poynt H. And draw the line HK parallell to the line CD (by the 31. of the first). Then I say, that from the parallelogramme AC is cut of the parallelogrāme CDHK, like vnto the parallelogrāme EG. Which thing is manifest by thys 24. Proposition. For that both the sayd parallelogrammes are described about one &amp; the selfe same dimetient. And to the end it might the more plainly be seene, I haue made complete the Parallelogramme ABGL.

                        Another addition of Pelitarius.
                     Suppose that the two superficieces be A and B, betwene which it is required to place a meane superficies proportionall. Reduce the sayd two rectiline figures A and B
                     
vnto two like parallelogrāmes (by the 18. of this booke) or if you thinke good reduce eyther of them to a square, (by the last of the second). And let the said two parallelogrammes like the one to the other and equall to the superficieces A and B, be CDEF and FGHK. And let the angles F in either of them be equall, which two angles let be placed in such sort, that the two parallelogrammes ED and HG may be about one and the selfe same dimetient CK (which is done by putting the right lines EF and FG in such sort that they both make one right line, namely,

                     EG). And make cōplete the parallelogrāme CLK M. Then I say, that either of the supplements FL &amp; FM is a meane proportionall betwene the superficieces CF &amp; FK, that is, betwene the superficieces A and B: namely, as the superficies HG is to the superficies FL, so is the same superficies FL to the superficies ED. For by this 24. Proposition the line HF is to the line FD, as the line GF is to the line FE. But (by the first of this booke) as the line HF is to the line FD, so is the superficies HG to the superficies FL: and as the line GF is to the line FE, so also (by the same) is the superficies FL to the superficies ED. Wherfore (by the 11. of the fift) as the superficies HG is to the superficies FL, so is the same superficies FL to the superficies ED: which was required to be done.
               
            
            
               The 7. Probleme. The 25. Proposition. Vnto a rectiline figure geuen to describe an other figure lyke, which shal also be equall vnto an other rectiline figure geuen.
               SVppose yt the rectiline figure geuē, wherunto is required an other to be made like be ABC, and let the other rectiline figure whereunto the same is required to be made, equal be D. Now it is required to describe a rectiline figure like vnto the figure ABC, and equall vnto the figure D.Construction. Vppon the line BC

describe (by the 44. of the first) a parallelogramme BE equall vnto the triangle ABC, and by the same vpon the line CE, describe the parallelogramme C M equall vnto the rectiline figure D, and in the said parallelogramme let the angle FCE, be equall vnto the angle CBL. And forasmuch as the angle FCE is by construction equall to the angle CBL,Demonstration. adde the angle BCE common to them both. Wherefore the angles LBC and BCE are equall

vnto the angles BCE and ECF, but the angles LBC and BCE are equall to two right angles (by the 29. of the first) wherfore also the angles BCE and ECF are equall to two right angles. Wherfore the lines BC and CF (by the 14. of the first) make both one right line, namely, BF, and in like sort do the lines LE and EM make both one right line, namely, LM. Then (by the 13. of the sixth) take the meane proportionall betwene the lines BC and CF, which let be GH. And (by the 18. of the sixth) vpon the line GH, let there be described a rectiline figure KHG like vnto the rectiline figure ABC, and in like sorte situate. And for that as the line BC, is to the line GH, so is the line GH to ye line CF:Demonstration. but if there be thre right lines proportional, as the first is to the third, so is the figure which is described of the first vnto the figure which is described of the second, the said figures being like and in like sort situate (by the second correllary of the 20. of the sixth) wherfore as the line BC is to the line CF, so is the triangle ABC to the triangle KGH. But as the line BC is to the lyne CF, so is the parallelogramme BE to the parallelogramme EF (by the 1. of the sixth). Wherfore as the triangle A

BC, is to the triangle KGH so is the parallelogramme BE to the parallelogramme EF. Wherfore alternately also (by the 16. of the fifth) as the triangle ABC is to the parallelogrāme BE, so is the triangle KGH, to the parallelogramme EF: but the triangle ABC is equal vnto the parallelogrāme BE, wherfore also the triangle KGH is equall vnto the parallelogramme EF: but the parallelogramme FE is equall vnto the rectiline figure D. Wherfore also the rectiline figure KGH is equall vnto the rectiline figure D, and the rectiline figure KGH is by supposition like vnto the rectiline figure ABC. Wherefore there is described a rectiline figure KGH lyke vnto the rectiline figure geuen ABC, and equall vnto the other rectiline figure geuen D: which was required to be done.
            
            
               The 19. Theoreme. The 26. Proposition. If from a parallelogramme be taken away a parallelograme like vnto the whole and in like sorte set, hauing also an angle common with it, then is the parallelogramme about one and the selfe same dimecient with the whole.
               
                  SVppose that there be a parallelogramme ABCD, and from the parallelogramme ABCD, take away a parallelogramme AF like vnto the parallelogramme ABCD, and in like sort situate, hauing also the angle DAB common with it. Then I say, that the parallelogrammes ABCD and AF are both about one and the self same 
                     By the dimetiēt is vnderstand here the dimetient which is 
                           •
                        rawen from the angle which is common to them both to the opposite angle.
                     Demonstration leading to an absurditie.
                   dimecient AFC, that is, that the dimecient AFC of the whole parallelogramme ABCD passeth by the angle F of the parallelogramme AF, and is common to either of the parallelogrammes. For if AC do not passe by the point F, then if it be possible let it passe by some other point, as AHC doth. Now then the dimetient AHC shall cut eyther the side GF or the side EF of ye parallelogramme AF. Let it cut ye side GF in the point H. And (by the 31. of the first) by the point H let there be drawen to either of these lines AD and BC a parallel line HK wherfore GK is a parallelogramme, and is about one and the selfe same

dimetient with ye parallelogramme ABCD. And forasmuch as ye parallelogrammes ABCD and GK are about one and the self same dimecient, therfore (by the 24. of the sixth) the parallelogramme ABCD is like vnto the parallelogramme GK. Wherfore as the line DA is to the line AB so is the line GA to the line AK (by the conuersion of the first definition of the sixth) And for that the parallelogrammes ABCD, and EG are (by supposition) like, therfore as the line DA is to the lyne AB so is the line GA to the line AE. Wherfore the line GA hath one and the selfe proportion to either of these lines AK and AE. Wherfore (by the 9. of the fifth) the line AK is equall vnto ye line AE, namely, ye lesse to ye greater, which is impossible. The selfe same inconuenience also will follow, if you put the dimetient AC to cut the side FE. Wherfore AC the dimetie
                     •
                  t of the whole parallelogramme ABCD passeth by the angle and poynt F. And therfore the parallelogramme AEFG is about one and the selfe same dimetient with the whole parallelogramme ABCD. Wherfore if from a parallelogramme be taken away a parallelograme lyke vnto the whole, and in lyke sorte situate, hauing also an angle common with it, then is that parallelogramme about one and the selfe same dimetient with the whole: which was required to be proued.
               
                  ¶ An other demonstration after Flussates, which proueth this proposition affirmatiuely.
                  From the parallelogramme ABGD let there be taken away the parallelogramme AEZK like and in like sorte situate with the whole parallelogramme ABGD, and hauing also the angle A common with the whole parallelogramme.
                        An other way after Flussates.
                      Then I say that both their diameters, namely, AZ and AZG do make one and the selfe same right line. Deuide the sides AB and B
                        •
                      into two equall partes in the pointes C and F (by the 10. of

the first.) And drawe a line from C to F.

Wherefore the line CF is a parallel to the right line AG (by the corollary added by Campane after the 29. of the first) Wherfore the angles BAG and BCF are equall (by the 29. of the first): but the angle EAZ is equall vnto the angle BAG (by reasō the parallelogrammes are supposed to be like) wherefore the same angle EAZ is equall to the angle BCF, namely, the outward angle to the inward and opposite angle. Wherfore (by the 28. of the first) the lines AZ and CF are parallel lynes. Now then the lines AZ and AG being parallels to one and the selfe same lyne, namely, to CF do concurre in the point A. Wherefore they are set directly the one to the other, so that they both make one right line (by that which was added in the ende of the 30. proposition of the first) wherfore the parallelogrammes ABGD, and AEZK are about one and the selfe fame dimetient: which was required to be proued.
               
            
            
               The 20. Theoreme. The 27. Proposition. Of all parallelogrammes applied to a right line wanting in figure by parallelogrammes like and in like sort situate to that parallelograme which is described of the halfe line: the greatest parallelogramme is that which is described of the halfe line being like vnto the want.
               
                  
                     In this propositiō are two cases, in the first the parallelogramme compared to the parallelogrāme described of the halfe line is described vpon a line greater thē the halfe line: In the second vpō a line lesse.
                     The first case where the parellelogramme compared namely AF is described vpon the line AK which is greater then the halfe line AC.
                  LEt there be a right line AB, and (by the 10. of the first) deuide it in two equall partes in the point C. And vnto the right line AB apply a parallelogramme AD wanting in figure by the parallelogramme DB, which let be like and in like sort described vnto the parallelogramme described of halfe the line AB, which is, BC. Then I say, that of all the parallelogrammes which

may be applied vnto the line AB and which wāt in figure by parallelogrāmes like and in like sort situate vnto the parallelogramme DB the greatest is the parallelogramme AD. For vnto ye right line AB let there be applied a parallelogramme AF wanting in figure by the parallelogramme FB, which let be like and in like sort situate vnto the parallelogramme DB. Then I say, that the parallelogramme AD is greater then the parallelogramme AF. For forasmuch

as the parallelogramme DB is like vnto the parallelogramme

                  B, therfore (by the 26. of the sixt) they are about one and the selfe same dimetient.Demonstration of this case. Let their dimetient be DB, and make complete the figure. Now forasmuch as (by the 43. of ye first) the supplement FC is equall vnto the supplement FE
                     •
                   adde the figure FB common to them both. Wherefore the whole figure CR is equall vnto the whole figure KE. But the figure CR is equall vnto the figure CG (by the 36. of the first) for that the base AC is equall vnto the base CB. Wherefore the figure GC is equall vnto the figure KE. Adde the figure CF common vnto them both. Wherfore the whole figure AF is equall vnto the whole Gnomon LMN. But the whole parallelogramme DB is greater then the Gnomon LMN (by the 3. common sentence). Wherefore also it is greater then the parallelogramme AF. But the parallelogramme AD is equall vnto the parallelogramme DB (by the 36. of the first). Wherefore the parallelogramme AD is greater then the parallelogramme AF. Wherefore of all parallelogrammes applied to a right line wanting in figure by parallelogrammes like and in like sort situate, to that parallelogramme which is described of ye halfe line, the greatest parallelogrāme is that which is described of the halfe of the line, being like vnto the want: which was required to be proued.
               Againe, let AB be deuided into two equall partes in the point C, and let the parallelogramme applied vpon the halfe line be AL,The second case where the parallelogramme compared namely AE is described vpon the line AD which is lesse then the line AC, Demonstration of the second case. wanting in figure by the parallelogramme LB, which let be like and in like sort situate vnto the parallelogramme AL. Againe vnto the line AB let there be applied an other parallelogramme AE wanting in figure by ye parallelogrāme

EB being like and in like sort situate vnto the parallelogrāme LB which is described vpon halfe of the line AB. Thē I say, that the parallelogramme AL applied vnto halfe the line is greater then the parallelogramme AE. For forasmuch as the parallelogramme EB is like vnto the parallelogramme LB, they are (by the 26. of the sixt) about one and the same dimetient. Let their dimetient be EB, and make complete the whole figure, and for that the figure LF is equall vnto the figure LH (by the 36. of the first) for the base FG is equall vnto the base GH, therfore the figure LF is greater then the figure KE. But the figure LF is equall vnto the figure DL (by the 43. of the first). Wherefore the figure DL is greater then the figure KE: put the figure KD common to them both. Wherfore the whole parallelogramme AL is greater then the whole parallelogramme AE: which was required to be proued.
            
            
               
               The 8. Probleme. The 28. Proposition. Vpon a right line geuen, to apply a parallelogramme equall to a rectiline figure geuen, &amp; wanting in figure by a parallelogramme like vnto a parallelogrāme geuen. Now it behoueth that the rectiline figure geuen, whereunto the parallelogrāme applied must be equall, be not greater thē that parallelogramme, which so is applied vpon the halfe lyne, that the defectes shall be like, namely, the defect of the parallelogrāme applied vpon the halfe line, and the defect of the parallelogramme to be applied (whose defect is required to be like vnto the parallelogramme geuen).
               SVppose the right line geuen to be AB, and let the rectiline figure geuen wherunto is required to apply vpon the right line AB an equall rectiline figure be C, which figure C, let not be greater then that parallelogrāme which is so applied vpon the halfe line, that the defectes shall be like, namely, the defect of the parallelogramme applied vpon the halfe line, and the defect of the parallelogramme to be applied (whose defect is required to be like vnto the parallelogramme geuē). And let the figure whereunto the defect or want of the parallelogramme is

required to be like D. Now it is required vpō ye right line geuē AB, to describe vnto the rectiline figure geuen C, an equal parallelogramme wanting in figure by a parallelogramme like vnto D.Construction. Let the line AB (by the 10. of the first) be deuided into two equall partes in ye point E. And (by the 18. of the sixth) vppon the line

                  B describe a rectiline figure EBFG like vnto the parallelogramme D and in like sort situate, which shall also be a parallelograme. And make complete the parallelogramme AG.Two cases in this Proposition. Now then the parallelogramme AG is either equal vnto the rectiline figure C, or greater then it by supposition. If the parallelogramme AG be equal vnto the rectiline figure C, then is that done which we 
                     •
                  ought for.The first case. For then vpō the right line AB is described vnto the rectiline figure

geuen C an equal parallelogramme AG wanting in figure by the parallelograme GB,The second case. which is like vnto the parallelogramme D. But if AG be not equal vnto C then is AG greater then C, but AG is equall vnto GB (by the first of the sixt). Wherfore also GB is greater then C. Take the excesse of the rectiline figure BG aboue the rectiline figure C (by that which Pelitarius addeth after the 4
                     •
                  . of the first) And vnto that excesse (by the 15. of the sixt) describe an equall rectiline figure KLMN like and in like sort situate vnto the rectiline figure D. But the rectiline figure D is like vnto the rectiline GB, wherfore also the rectiline figure KLMN is like vnto the rectiline figure GB (by the 25. of the sixt) Now then let the sides KL and GE be sides of like proportion, let also ye sides LM and GF be sides of like proportion. And forasmuch as the parallelogrāme GB is equal vnto the figures C and KM, therfore the parallelogramme GB is greater then the parallelogramme KM. Wherefore also the side GE is greater then the side KL, and the side GF is greater then the side LM, vnto the side KL put an equall line GO (by the 2. of the first) and likewise vnto the side LM put an equall line GP. And make perfect the parallelogramme OGPX. Wherfore the parallelogramme GX is equal &amp; like vnto the parallelogramme KM. But the parallelogramme KM is lyke vnto the parallelogramme GB. Wherfore also the parallelogramme GX is like vnto the parallelogramme GB. Wherfore the parallelogrammes GX and GB are (by the 26. of the sixt) about one and the self same dimecient. Let their dimecient be GB, and make complete the figure. Now forasmuch as the parallelogramme BG is equall vnto the rectiline figure C, and vnto the parallelogramme KM, and the parallelogramme GX, which is part of the parallelogramme GB, is equal vnto KM. Wherfore the Gnomon remayning YQV is equall vnto the rectiline figure remayning, namely, to C. And forasmuch as the supplement PR is equall vnto the supplement OS, put the parallelogramme XB common vnto them both. Wherfore the whole parallelogramme PB is equall vnto the whole parallelograme OB. But the parallelogramme OB is equal vnto the parallelogramme TE by the 1. of the sixt, (for the side AE is equal vnto the side EB) Wherfore the parallelogramme TE is equal vnto the parallelogramme PB. Put the parallelogramme OS common to them both. Wherfore the whole parallelogramme TS is equall vnto the whole gnomon YQV. But it is proued that the gnomon YQV is equal vnto the rectiline figure C. Wherfore also the parallelogramme TS is equal vnto the rectiline figure C. Wherfore vpon the right line geuen AB is applied a parallelogramme TS equal vnto the rectiline figure geuen C, and wanting in figure by a parallelogramme XB which is like vnto the parallelogramme geuen D, for the parallelogramme XB is like vnto the parallelogramme GX: which was required to be done.

               The 9. Probleme. The 29. Proposition. Vpon a right line geuen to apply a parallelogramme equall vnto a rectiline figure geuen, and exceeding in figure by a parallelogramme like vnto a parallelogramme geuen.
               SVppose the right line geuen to be AB, and let the rectiline figure geuen whereunto is required vpon the line AB to apply an equall parallelogramme be C: let also the parallelogramme wherunto ye excesse is required to be like, be D. Now it is required

vpon the right line AB to apply in parallelogramme equall vnto the rectiline figure C, and exceeding in figure by a parallelogramme like vnto the parallelogramme D.Construction. Let the line AB be (by the 10. of the first) deuided into two equall partes in the point E. And vpon the line EB (by the 18. of the sixt) describe a parallelogramme BF like vnto the figure D, and in like sort situate. And vnto both

these figures BF and C, describe an equall rectiline figure GH like vnto the figure D and in like sort situate (by the 25. of the sixt). Wherefore the parallelogramme GH is (by the 21. of the sixt) like vnto the parallelogramme BF. Let the sides KH and FL be sides of like proportion, and so also let the sides KG and FE be. And forasmuch as the parallelogramme GH is (by construction) greater then the parallelogramme FB, therefore the line KH is greater then the line FL, and the line KG is greater then the line FE. Extend the lines FL and FE to the pointes M &amp; N, and vnto the line KH put an equall line FLM, and likewise vnto the line KG put an equall line FEN: and make perfect the figure MN. Wherefore the parallelogramme MN is equall and like vnto the parallelogramme GH. But the parallelogramme GH is like vnto the parallelogramme EL. Wherefore also the parallelogramme MN is like vnto the parallelogramme EL. Wherefore the parallelogrammes EL and MN are (by the 26. of the sixt) about one and the same dimetient. Let the sayd dimetient be FO, and make perfect the figure.Demonstration. Now forasmuch as the parallelogramme GH is equall vnto the figures EL and C. But by construction the parallelogramme GH is equall vnto the parallelogramme MN. Wherfore the parallelogramme MN is equall vnto the figures EL and C. Take away the figure EL which is common to them both. Wherefore the Gnomon remayning, namely, VYX, is equall vnto the rectiline figure C. And forasmuch as the line AE is equall vnto the line EB, therefore the parallelogramme A N is (by the 36. of the first) equall vnto the parallelogramme NB, that is, vnto the parallelogramme LP, which (by the 43. of the first) is equall vnto the parallelogramme NB. Adde the parallelogramme BO common to them both. Wherefore the whole parallelogramme AO is equall vnto the Gnomon VYX. But the Gnomon VYX is equall vnto the rectiline figure C. Wherefore the parallelogramme AO is equall vnto the rectiline figure C. Wherefore vpon the right line geuen AB is applied the parallelogramme AO equall vnto the rectiline figure geuen C, and exceeding in figure by the parallelogramme QP which is like vnto the parallelogramme geuen D. For the parallelogramme D is like vnto the parallelogramme BF: and the parallelogramme BF is like vnto the parallelogramme PQ: for they are about one and the selfe same dimetient: which was required to be done.

               SVppose the right line geuen to be AB. It is required to devide the line AB by an extreme and meane proportion.Construction. Vpon the line AB describe (by the 46. of the first) a square BC. And vpon the line AC (by the

to them both. Wherefore the figure remayning, namely, BF, is equall to the figure remayning, namely, to AD, and the angle E of the one is equall vnto the angle E of the other. Wherefore (by the 2. definition of the sixt, and by the 14. of the sixt) the sides of the figures BF and DA, which containe the equall angles, are reciprokall. Wherefore as the side FE is to the side ED, so is the side AE to the side EB. But the side FE is equall vnto the line AC, that is, vnto the line AB, and the side ED is equall vnto the line AE (by the 34. of the first). Wherefore as the line BA is to the line AE, so is the line AE to the line EB. But the line AB is greater then the line AE. Wherfore also the line AE is greater then the line EB. Wherefore the right line AB is deuided by an extreme and meane proportion in the point E: and the greater segment thereof is AE: which was required to be done.

Deuide the line AB in the point C (by the 11. of the second) in such sort that the rectangle figure comprehended vnder the lines AB and BC may be equall vnto the square described

of the line CA. And forasmuch as that which is comprehended vnder the lines AB &amp; BC, is equall vnto the square made of the line AC, therefore as the line BA is to the line AC, so (by the 17. of the sixt) is the line AC to the lin

               SVppose that there be a triangle ABC, whose angle BAC let be a right angle. Thē I say that the figure which is described of the lyne BC is equall vnto the two figures which are described of the lines BA &amp; AC, the said thre figures being like the one to the other, and in like sort described. From the point A (by the 12. of the first) let there be drawne vnto the line BC a perpendiculer line AD.Construction. Now forasmuch as in ye rectangle triangle ABC is drawen from the right angle A vnto the base BC a perpendicular line AD,Demonstration. therfore the triangles ABD, and ADC set vpon the perpendiculer line, are like vnto the whole triangle ABC, and also like the one to the other (by the 8. of the sixt). And forasmuch as the triangle ABC is like vnto the triangle ABD, therfore as the line CB is to the line BA, so is the line AB to the lyne BD. Now for that there are three right lines proportional, therfore (by the 2. correllary of the 20. of the sixth) as the first is to the third, so is the figure made of the first, to the figure made

of the second, the said figures being like and in like sorte described. Wherefore as the lyne BC is to the line BD, so is the figure made of the line BC to the figure made of the line BA, they beyng like and in lyke sort described. And by ye same reason as the line BC is to the lyne CD, so is the figure made of the line BC, to the figure made of the line CA, they being like and in like sort described. Wherfore as the line BC is to the lines BD and DC, so is the figure made of the line BC to the figures made of the lines BA and AC, they being like and in like sort described. But the line BC is equall vnto the lines BD and DC, wherfore the figure made of the lyne BC is equall vnto the figures made of the lines BA and AC, they being like and in like sort described. Wherfore in rectangle triangles the figure made of the side subtending the right angle is equall vnto the figures made of the sides comprehending the right angle, so that the said thr

                   figures be like and in like sort described: which was required to be proued.
               
                  An other way.
                  Forasmuch as (by the first correllary of the 20. of the sixth) like rectiline figures are in double proportion to that that the sides of like proportion are, therfore

the rectiline figure made of the line BC is vnto t

to that that the line CB is vnto the line BA. Wherfore also as the rectiline figure made of the line CB is to the rectiline figure made of the line BA, so is the square made of the lyne CB to the square made of the line BA. And by the same reason also, as the rectiline figure made of the line BC is to the rectiline figure made of ye line CA, so is the square made of the line BC to the square made of the line CA. Wherfore also as the rectiline figure made of the line BC is to the rectiline figures made of the lines BA and AC, so is the square made of the line BC to the squares made of the lines BA and AC. But the square made of ye line BC is equall vnto the squares made of the lines BA and AC (by the 47. of the first) Wherefore also the rectiline figure made of the line BC is equall vnto the rectiline figures made of the lines BA and AC, the said three figures beyng lyke and in like sort described.

                           The conuerse of the former proposition.
                        
                        If the figure described of one of the sides of a triangle be equall to the figures which are described of the two other sides, the sayd figures being like and in like sort described, the triangle shall be a rectangle triangle.
                     
                     Suppose that ABC be a triangle, and let the figure

described of the side BC be equall to the two figures described of the sides AB and AC, the said figures being like, and in like sort described. Then I say that the angle A is a right angle. Let the angle CAD be a right angle, and put the line AD equall to the line AB, and drawe a lyne from D to C. Now then by this 31. proposition, the figure made of the line CD is equall to the two figures made of the lines AC and AD, the said figures being like and in like sort described. Wherefore also it is equall vnto the figure made of the line BC, which is by supposition equal to the two figures made of the lines AC and AD (for the line AD is put equall to the line AB) wherfore the line DC is 
                           •
                        quall to the line BC. Wherfore (by the 8. of the first) the angle BAC is a right angle, which was required to be proued.

                  SVppose the two triangles to be ABC, and DCE, and let two of their sides AC &amp; DC make an angle ACD, and let the said triangles haue two sides of the one, namely, BA and AC proportionall to two sides of the other,
                  
                     Demonstration.
                   
                  namely, to DC and DE, so yt as AB is to AC, so let DC be to DE. And let AB be a parallell vnto DC, and AC a parallell vnto DE. Then I say, that the lines BC and CE are in one right line. For forasmuch as the line AB is a parallell vnto the line DC, and

vpon thē lighteth a right line AC:

therefore (by the 29. of the first) the alternate angles BAC and ACD are equall the one to the other. And by the same reason the angle CDE is equall vnto ye same angle ACD. Wherefore the angle BAC is equall vnto the angle CDE. And forasmuch as there are two triangles ABC and DCE, hauing the angle A of the one equall to the angle D of the other, and the sides about the equall angles are (by supposition) proportionall, that is, as the line BA is to the line AC, so is the line CD to the line DE, therfore the triangle ABC is (by the 6. of the sixt) equiangle vnto the triangl
                        •
                      DCE. Wherefore the angle ABC is equall vnto the angle DCE. And it is proued, that the angle ACD is equall vnto the angle BAC. Wherefore the whole angle ACE is equall vnto the two angles ABC and BAC. Put the angle ACB common to them both. Wherefore the angles ACE and ACB are equall vnto the angles CAB, ACB, &amp; CBA. But the angles CAB, ACB, and CBA, are (by the 32. of the first) equall vnto two right angles. Wherefore also the angles ACE and ACB are equall to two right angles. Now then vnto the right line AC, and vnto the point in it C, are drawen two right lines BC and CE, not on one and the same side, making the side angles ACE &amp; ACB equall to two right angles. Wherefore the lines BC and CE (by the 14. of the first) are set directly and do make one right line. If therefore two triangles be set together at one angle hauing two sides of the one proportionall to two sides of ye other, so yt their sides of like proportion be also parallels: then ye sides remayning of those triangles shall be in one right line: which was required to be proued.
               
               
                  Although Euclide doth not distinctly set forth the maner of proportion of like rectiline figures, as he did of lines in the 10. Propositiō of this Booke, and in the 3. following it, yet as Flussates noteth, is that not hard to be done by the 22. of thys Booke.

                  igures be like &amp; in like sort described by the said 22. of the sixt.
            
            
               The 23. Theoreme. The 33. Proposition. In equal circles, the angles haue one and the selfe same proportion that the circumferēces haue, wherin they cōsist, whether the angles be set at the centres or at the circumferences. And in like sort are the sectors which are described vppon the centres.
               SVppose the equall circles to be ABC, and DEF, whose centres let be G and H, and let the angles set at their centres G and H, be BGC, and EHF: and let the angles set at their circumferences be BAC and EDF. Then I say that as the circumference BC is to the circumference EF so is the angle BGC to the angle EHF: and the angle BAC to the angle EDF, and moreouer the sector GBC to the sector HEF. Vnto the circumference BC (by the 38. of the third) put as many equall circumferences in order as you will, namely, CK and KL, and vnto the circumference EF put also as many equall circumferences in number as you will, namely, FM, and MN. And drawe these right lines GK,That the angles at th

                      cē
                     ter are in proportiō the one to the other, as the circumferences wheron they are. GL, HM, and HN. Now forasmuch as the circumferences BC, CK, and KL are equall the one to the other, the angles also BGC, and CGK, and KGL are (by the 27. of the third) equall the one to the other. Therfore how multiplex the circumference BL is to the circumference BC, so multiplex is ye angle BGL to the angle BGC. And by ye same reason also, how multiplex the circumference NE is to the circumference EF, so multiplex is the

angle NHE to the angle EHF. Wherfore if the circumference BL be equal vnto the circumference EN, the angle BGL is equall vnto the angle EHN, and if the circumference BL be greater then the circumference EN, the angle BGL is greater then the angle NHE, and if the circumference be lesse, the angle is lesse. Now then there are foure magnitudes, namely, the two circumferences BC and EF, and the two angles that is, BGC, and EHF, and to the circumference BC and to the angle BGC, that is, to the first and third are takē equemultiplices, namely, the circumference BL, and the angle BGL, and likewise to the circumference EF, and to the angle EHF, that is, to the second and fourth, are taken certayne other equemultiplices, namely, the circumference EN and the angle EHN. And it is proued, that if the circumference BL exceede the circumference EN, the angle also BGL exceedeth the angle EHN. And if the circumference be equall, the angle is equall, and if the circumferēce be lesse, the angle also is lesse. Wherfore (by the 6. definition of the fifth) as the circumference BC is to the circumference EF, so is the angle BGC to the angle EHF
                     •
                  
                  
               
               But as the angle BGC is to the angle EHF,That the angles at the circumferences are so also. so is the angle BAC to the angle EDF, for the angle BGC is double to the angle BAC, and the angle EHF is also double to the angle EDF (by the 20. of the third) Wherfore as the circumference BC is to the circumference EF, so is the angle BGC to the angle EHF, and the angle BAC to the angle EDF. Wherfore in equall circles the angles are in one and the selfe same proportion that their circumferences are, whether the angles be set at the centres, or at the circumferences: which was required to be proued.
               I say moreouer that as the circumference BC is to the circumference EF,That the sectors are so also. so is the sector GBC to the sector HEF. Draw these lines BC and CK. And in the circumferences BC and CK take pointes at all aduentures, namely, P and O. And draw lines from B to P, and from P to C, from C to O, and from O to K. And forasmuch as (by the 15. definition of the first) the two lines BG and GC are equall vnto the two lines CG and GK, and they also comprehend equall angles,

                  
therfore (by the 4. of the first) the base BC is equall vnto the base CK, &amp; the triangle GBC is equall vnto the triangle GCK. And seing that the circumference BC is equall vnto the circumference CK, therefore the circumference remayning of the whole circle ABC, namely, the circumference BLAKOC, is equall vnto the circum
                     •
                  erence remayning of the selfe same circle ABC, namely, to the circumference CPBLAK. Wherfore the angle BPC is equall vnto the angle COK (by the 27. of the third) Wherfore (by the 10. definition of the third) the segment BPC is like vnto the segment COK, and they are set vpon equall right lines BC and KC. But like segmentes of circles which consist vpon equall right lines are also equall the one to the other (by the 24. of the third). Wherfore the segment BPC is equall vnto the segment COK. And the triangle GBC is equall vnto the triangle GCK. Wherfore the sector GBC is equall vnto the sector GCK. And by the same reason also, the sector GKL is equall vnto either of the sectors GBC and GCK. Wherfore ye three sectors GBC and GCK, and GKL, are equall ye one to ye other. And by the same reason also the sectors HEF and HFM, and HMN are equall the one to the other. Wherefore how multiplex the circumference BL is to the circumference BC so multiplex is the sector GLB to the sector GBC. And by the same reason how multiplex the circumference NE is to the circumference EF, so multiplex is ye sector HEN to the sector HEF. If therfore the circumference BL be equall vnto ye circumference EN, ye sector also BGL is equall vnto ye sector EHN. And if the circumferēce BL excede ye circumference EN, ye sector also BGL excedeth the sector EHN. And if the circumference be lesse, the sector also is lesse. Now thē there are foure magnitudes, namely, the two circumferences BC and EF, and the two sectors GBC &amp; HEF, and to the circumference BC, &amp; to the sector GBC, namely, to the first and the third, are taken equemultiplices, that is, the circumference BL, and the sector GBL, and likewise to the circumference EF, and to the sector HEF, namely, to the second and fourth, are taken certayne other equimultiplices, namely, the circumference EN and the sector

HEN. And it is proued that if the circumference BL excede the circumference EN, the sector also BGL excedeth the sector EHN. And if the circumference be equall, the segment also is equall, and if the circumference be lesse, the segment also is lesse. Wherfore (by the conuersion of the sixt definition of the fifth) as the circumference BC is to the circumference EF, so is ye sector GBC vnto the sector HEF: which is all that was required to be proued.
               
                  Corollary. And hereby it is manifest, that as the sector is to the sector, so is angle to angle by the 11. of the fifth.

                         And let the proportion geuen be the proportion of the lines GC and CD. And (by the 10. of this booke) deuide the line AB like vnto the line GD in the poynt E (so that as the line GC is to the line CD, so let the line AE be to the line EB). And vpon the line AB describe a semicircle AFB. And from the poynt E erect (by the 11. of the first) vnto the line AB a perpendicular line EF cutting the circumference in the poynt F. And draw these lines AF and FB. And vpon either of these lines describe rectiline figures like vnto the rectiline figure AHB and in like sort situate (by the 18. of the sixt): which let be AKF, &amp; FIB. Then I say, that the rectiline figures AKF, and FIB,
                        
haue the proportion geuē (namely, the proportion of the line GC to the line CD) and are equall to the rectiline figure geuen ABH vnto which they are described like and in like sort situate. For forasmuch as AFB is a semicircle, therefore the angle AFB is a right angle (by the 31. of the third) and FE is a perpendicular line.Demonstartion of the same. Wherefore (by the 8. of this booke) the triangles AFE and FBE are like both to the whole triangle AFB and also the one to the other. Wherefore (by the 4. of this booke) as the line AF is to the line FB, so is the line AE to the line EF, and the line EF to the line EB, which are sides cōtayning equall angles. Wherfore (by the 22. of this booke) as the rectiline figure described of the line AF is to the rectiline figure described of the line FB, so is the rectiline figure described of the line AE to the rectiline figure described of the line EF, the sayd rectiline figures being like and in like sort

                        Suppose that there be two right lines AB and GD cutting the one the other in the point E, and making an obtuse angle in the section E. And from the endes of the lines, namely, A and G, let there be drawen to either line perpendicular lines, namely, from the point A to the line GD, which let be AD, and from the point G to the right line AB: which let be GB. Then I say, that the

right lines AB and GD do, betwene the end A and the perpendicular B, and the end G and the perpendicular D, cut the one the other reciprokally in the point E: so that as the line AE is to the line ED, so is the line GE to the line EB.
                        
                           Demonstration of this proposition.
                         For forasmuch as the angles ADE and GBE, are right angles, therfore they are equall. But the angles AED and GEB are also equall (by the 15. of the first). Wherefore the angles remayning, namely, EAD, &amp; EGB, are equall (by the Corollary of the 32. of the first). Wherefore the triangles AED and GEH, are equiangle. Wherfore the sides about the equall angles shall be proportionall (by the 4. of the sixt). Wherfore as the line AE is to the line ED, so is the line GE to the line EB. If therefore two right lines cut the one the other obtuseangled wife. &amp;c: which was required to be proued.

                        If two right lines make an acute angle, and from their endes be drawen to ech line perpendicular lines cutting them: the two right lines geuen shall be reciprokally proportionall as the segmentes which are about the angle.
                     
                     Suppose that there be two right lines AB and GB, making an acute angle ABG. And from the poyntes A and G let there be drawen vnto the lines AB and GB perpendicular lines AC and GE, cutting the lines AB and GB in the poyntes E and

angle B.

And moreouer a right line drawen from the sayd poynt &amp; touching the circle, shall be a meane proportionall betwene the whole line and the vtter segment.
                     
                     Suppose that there be a circle ABD, and without it

take a certayne poynt, namely, G. And from the point G drawe vnto the concaue circumference two right lines GB and GD, cutting the circle in the poyntes C and E. And let the line GA touch the circle in the point A. Thē I say, that the lines, namely, GB to GD are reciprokally as their parts taken without the circle, namely, as GC to GE.
                        
                           Demonstration of the first part of this proposition.
                         For forasmuch as (by the Corollary of the 36. of the third) the rectangle figure contayned vnder the lines GB and GE is equall to the rectangle figure contayned vnder the lines GD and GC, therefore (by the 14. of the sixt) reciprokally as the line GB is to the line GD, so is the line GC to the line GE, for they are sides contayning equall angles. I say moreouer, that betwene the lines GB and GE, or betwene the lines GD and GC the touch line GA is a meane proportionall.
                           Demonstration of the second part.
                         For forasmuch as the rectangle figure comprehended vnder the lines GB and GE is equall to the square made of the line AG (by the 36. of the third) it followeth that the touch line GA is a meane proportionall betwene the extremes GB and GE (by the second part of the 17. of the sixt) for that by that Proposition the lines GB, GA, and GE are proportionall. And by the same reason may it be proued that the line GA is a meane proportionall betwene the lines GD and GC, and so of all others. If therefore from a poynt geuen

            ¶The seuenth booke of Euclides Elementes.
            HETHERTO IN THE SIXE bookes before hath Euclide passed through, and entreated of the Elementes of Geometrie without the ayde and succor of nomber. But the matters which remayne to be taught and to be spoken of in these his Geometricall bookes which follow as in the tenth, eleuenth, and so forth, he could by no meanes fully and clearely make plaine &amp; demonstrate, without the helpe and ayd of nombers. In the tenth is entreated of lines irrationall and vncertaine, and that of many &amp; sondry kindes: and in the eleuenth &amp; the other following he teacheth the natures of bodyes, and compareth theyr sides and lines together. All which for the most part are also irrationall. And as rationall quantites, and the comparisons and proportions of them, cannot be knowen, nor exactly tried, but by the meane of nomber, in which they are first sene and perceiued: euen so likewise cannot irrationall quantities be knowen and found out without nomber. As straightnes is the triall of crokednes, and inequalitie is tried by equalitie: so are quantities irrationall perceiued and knowen by quantities rationall: which are 
                  •
               irst and chiefely found among nombers. Wherefore in these three bookes following, being as it were in the middest of his Elementes, he is compelled of necessitie to entreate of nombers,
                  Why Euclide in the middest of his workes was compelled to adde these three bookes of numbers.
                although not so fully, as the nature of nombers requireth, yet so much as shall seme to be fit, and sufficiently to serue for his purpose. Wherby is sene the necessitie, that the one Arte, namely, Geometrie, hath of the other, namely, of Arithmeticke. And also of what excellēcy and worthines Arithmeticke is aboue Geometrie:
                  Arithmetike of more excellency then Geometry.
                in that, Geometrie boroweth of it principles, ayd, and succor, and is as it were maymed with out it. Whereas Arithmeticke is of it selfe, sufficient and neadeth not at all any ayde of Geometrie, but is absolute and perfit in it selfe, and may well be taught and attayned vnto without it. Agayne the matter or subiect where about Geometrie is occupied, which are lines, figures, and bodyes, are such as offer them selues to the sences, as triangles, squares, circles, cubes, and other are sene &amp; iudged to be such as they are, by the sight: but nomber, which is the subiect and matter of Arithmeticke, falleth vnder no sence, nor is represented by any shape, forme, or figure: and therefore cannot be iudged by any sence, but only by consideration of the minde, and vnderstanding. Now thinges sensible are farre vnder in degree then are thinges intellectuall:
                  Things intellectuall of more worthines the
                        •
                      things sensible.
                and are of nature much more grosse then they. Wherefore nomber, as being only intellectuall, is more pure, more immateriall, and more subtile, farre then is magnitude: and extēdeth it selfe farther. For Arithmeticke, not onely aydeth Geometrie: but ministreth principles, and groundes to many other, nay rather to all other sciences and artes.

                As to musicke, Astronomy, naturall philosophy, perspectiue, with others. What other thing is in musicke entreated of, then nomber contracted to sound and voyce? In Astronomie, who without the knowledge of nomber can doo any thing, either in searching out of the motions of the heauens, and their courses, either in iudging and foreshewing the effectes of them? In natural philosophie, it is of no small force. The wisest and best learned philosophers that haue bene, as Pithagoras, Timeus, Plato, and their followers, found out &amp; taught most pithely and purely, the secret and hidden knowledge of the nature and condicion of all thinges, by nombers, and by the proprieties and passions of them. Of what force nomber is in perspectiue, let him declare and iudge, who hath any thing traueled therein. Yea to be short, what can be worthely and with prayse practised in common life of any man of any condition, without the knowledge of nomber. Yea it hath bene taught of the chiefest amongst philosophers, that all naturall thinges are framed, and haue their constitucion of nomber. Boetius sayth Hoc fuit principal

               ¶Definitions.
               
                  
                     
                        The first definition.
                     1 Vnitie is that, whereby euery thing that is, is sayd to be on.
                  As a point in magnitude, is the least thing in magnitude, and no magnitude at all, &amp; yet the ground and beginning of all magnitudes: euen so is vnitie in multitude or nomber, the least thing in nomber, and no nomber at all, and yet the ground and beginning of all nombers. And therefore it is here in this place, of Euclide first defined: as in the first booke, for the like reason and cause was a point first defined. Vnitie, sayth Euclide, is that whereby euery thing is sayd to be one: that is, vnitie is that, whereby euery thing is deuided and seperated from an other, and remayneth on in it selfe pure and distinct frō all others. Otherwise, were not this vnitie,
                        Without vnity should be confusion of thinges.
                      whereby all thinges are seioyned the on from the other, all things should suffer mixtion and be in confusion. And where confusion is, there is no order, nor any thing can be exactly knowen, either what it is, or what is the nature, and what are the properties thereof. Vnitie therefo

                      vnitie is that whereby euery thing doth properly and essentially differ, and is an other thing from all others. Certainely a very apt de

                        The second definition.
                     2 Number is a multitude composed of vnities.
                  As the number of three, is a multitude composed and made of three vnities. Likewise the number of fiue is nothing ells, but the composition &amp; putting together of fiue vnities. Although as was before sayde, betwene a poynt in magnitude, and vnitie in multitude, there is great agreement and many thi

                     on to them both, (for as a poynt is the beginning of magnitude, so is vnitie the beginning of nomber. And as a poynt in magnitude is indiuisible, so is also vnitie in number indiuisible) yet in this they differ and disagree.

                      There is no line or magnitude made of pointes, as of his partes. So that although a point be the beginning of a lyne, yet is it no part therof. But vnitie, as it is the beginning of number, so is it also a part therof, which is somewhat more manifestly set of Boetius in an other d

                      which is thus.

                         acernus ex vnitatibus profusus, that is. Number is a masse or heape of quantities produced of vnities: which diffinition in substance is all one with the first, wherin is said most plainly, that the heape or masse,

                      that is, the whole substance of the quantitie of number is produced &amp; made of vnities. So that vnitie is as it were the very matter of number. As foure vnities added together are the matter wherof the number 4. is made, &amp; eche of these vnities is a part of the number foure, namely, a fourth part, or a quarter. Vnto this diffinition agreeth also the definition geuen of Iordane,
                     
                        Iordane.
                      which is thus. Number is a quantitie which gathereth together thinges seuered a sonder.
                     
                        An other definition of numbers.
                      As fiue men beyng in themselues seuered and distincte, are by the number fiue brought together, as it were into one masse, and so of others. And although vnitie be no number, yet it contayneth in it the vertue and power of all numbers, and is set and taken for them.
                        Vnity hath in it the vertue and power of all numbers.
                     
                  
                  In this place (for the Farther elucidation of thinges, partly before set, and chiefly hereafter to be set, because Euclide here doth make mention of diuers kyndes of numbers, and also defineth the same) is to be noted, that number may be considered three maner of wayes. First, number may be considered absolutely, without comparyng it to any other number,
                        Number considered three maner of way
                              •
                           .
                      or without applieng it to any other thing, onely vewing 
                        •
                     nd paysing what it is in it selfe, and in his owne nature onely, and what partes it hath, and what proprieties and passions. As this number sixe, may be considered absolutely in his owne nature, that it is an euen number, and that it is a perfect number, and hath many mo conditions and proprieties. And so conceiue ye of all other numbers, whatsoeuer, of 9. 12. and so forth.
                  An other way, number may be cōsidered by way of cōparison, and in respect of some other number either as equall to it selfe, or as greater thē it selfe, or as lesse thē it selfe. As 12. may be cōsidered, as cō
                     pared to 12. which is equall vnto it, or as to 24. which is greater then it, for 12 is the halfe thereof, of as to 6. which is lesse then it, as beyng the double therof. And of this consideration of numbers ariseth and springeth all kyndes and varieties of proportiō: as hath before bene declared in the explanation of the principles of the fift booke, so that of that matter it is needelesse any more to be sayd in this place.
                  The third way may numbers be considered as they are applied to formes and figures of Geometry
                        •
                      And numbers so considered are not represented by figures or charactes of number commonly vsed in Arithmetique, but are signified by certayne pointes or prickes, which represent the vnities which they contayne: which, accordyng to the diuersitie of the disposition and placing of them, may represent diuers formes and figures of Geometry
                        •

                     t taketh his name, and is called a trianguler number, a square number, a cube

number or after any other figure. As if the figure of 10. be described by his vnities

that they be orderly set in a straight course, so that they represent the forme of a line, then is the number 10 called a lineall number. And if the same number to be so described by his vnities,

that it shew forth the forme of a triangle, then it is called a trianguler nūber
                        •
                      as ye here see. Likewise if 12 be in such sort described by his vnities, that it represēteth that form

                      or figure which in Geometry is called a figure on the one side longer
                        •
                      then shall the number 12 be called a number hauyng the one side longer, and so may you conceaue of all others.
                  Thus much of this for the declaration of the thinges following.
               
               
                  3 A part is a lesse number in comparison to the greater when the lesse measureth the greater.
                        The third definition.
                     
                  
                  As the number 3 compared to the number 12. is a part. For 3 is a lesse number then is 12. and moreouer it measureth 12 the greater number. For 3 taken (or added to it selfe) certayne times (namely, 4 tymes) maketh 12. For 3 foure tymes is 12. Likewise is 
                        •
                      a part of 8: 2 is lesse then 8, and taken 4 tymes it maketh 8. For the better vnderstandyng of this diffinition, and how this worde Parte, is diuersly taken in Arithmetique and in Geometry, read the declaration of the first diffinition of the 5. booke.
               
               
                  4 Partes are a lesse number in respect of the greater, when the lesse measureth not the greater.
                        The fourth definition.
                     
                  
                  As the number 3 compared to 5, is partes of 5 and not a part. For the number 3 is lesse then the nū
                     ber 5, and doth not measure 5. For taken once it maketh but 3. once 3 is 3, which is lesse then 5. and 3 taken twise maketh 6, which is more then 5. Wherfore it is no part of 5 but partes, namely, three fifth partes of 5. For in the number 3 there are 3 vnities, and euery vnitie is the fifth part of 5. Wherfore 3 is three fifth partes of 5, and so of others.
               
               
                  5 Multiplex is a greater number in comparison of the lesse, when the lesse measureth the greater.
                        The fifth definition.
                     
                  
                  As 9 compared to 3 is multiplex, the number 9 is greater then the number 3. And moreouer 3 the lesse number measureth 9 the greater number. For 3 taken certaine tymes, namely, 3 tymes maketh 9. three tymes three is 9. For the more ample and full knowledge of this definition, read what is sayd in the explanation of the second definition of the 5 booke, where multiplex is sufficiently entreated of with all his kyndes.
               
               
                  6 An euen number is that, which may be deuided into two equal partes.
                        The sixth definition.
                     
                  
                  As the number 6 may be deuided into 3 and 3 which are his partes, and they are equall, the one not exceding the other. This definition of Euclide is to be vnderstand of two such equall partes, which ioyned together, make the whole number: as 3 and 3 (the equall partes of 6) ioyned together, make 6, for otherwise many numbers both euen and odde may be deuided into many equall partes, as into 4. 5. 6

                        •
                      an euen number, for that 3 and 3 (these equall partes of 9) added together make not 9 but onely 6. Likewise taking the definition so generally, euery number whatsoeuer should be an euen number
                        •
                      for in that sort of vnderstāding there is no number, but that it may be deuided into two equall partes: as this number 7 may be deuided into 3 partes namely, 3. 1. and 3. of which two, namely, 3 and 3 are equal, yet i

                     An euen number is that which in one and the same deuision is deuided into the greatest, and into the least: into the greatest, as touching space, and into the least as touching quantitie.
                     
                        An other definition.
                      As 10. is deuided into 5 &amp; 5. which

                        An other definition.
                     
                     An euen number is that which may be deuided into two equall partes, and into two vnequall partes, but in neyther diuision (to the constitucion of the whole) to the euen part is added the odde, neither to the odde is added the euen. As 8 may be deuided diuersly, partly into euen partes, as into 4 and 4. likewise into 6 and 2. and partly into odde partes, as into 5 and 3. also into 7 and 1. In all which deuisions, ye see no odde parte ioyned to an euen, nor an euen part ioyned to an odde: but if the one be euen, the other is euen, and if the one be odde, the other is odde. In the two first deuisions, both partes were euen, and in the two last, both partes were odde. It is to be considered that the two partes added together must make the whole.
                  This diffinition is generall and common to all euen numbers, except to the number 2. which can not be deuided into two vnequall partes, but onely into two vnities, which are equall.
                  
                     
                        An other definition.
                     There is yet geuē an other diffinition of an euen number, namely, thus. An euen number is that which onely by an vnitie either aboue it or vnder it, differeth from an odde. As 8 being an euen number differeth from 9 an odde number, being aboue it but by one. And also from 7. vnder it, it differeth likewise by one, and so o

                     7 An odde number is that which cannot be deuided into two equal partes: or that which onely by an vnitie differeth from an euen number.
                  As the number 5 can be by no meanes deuided into two equall partes, namely, such two which add
                        •
                     d together, shall make 5. Or by the second definition, 5 an odde number, differeth from 6 an euen number aboue 
                        •
                     t, by 1. And the same 5 differeth from 4 an euen number vnder it likewise by 1.

                     An odde number is that which cannot be deuided into two equall partes, but that an vnitie shall be betwene them As if ye deuide 5 into 2 and

                     . which are two equall partes,
                        An other definition of an od number.
                      there remaineth one or an vnitie betwene them to make the whole number 5.
                  There is yet an other definition of an odde number. An odde number is that, which being deuided into two vnequall partes howsoeuer, the one is euer euen, and the other odde. As if 9 be deuided into two partes, which added together, maketh the whole, namely, into 4 and 5. which are vnequall:
                        An other definition.
                      ye see the one is euen, namely, 4 and the other is odde, namely, 5. so if ye deuide 9 into 6 and 3. or into 8 and 1. the one part is euer euen, and the other odde.

                     8 A number euenly euen (called in latine pariter par) is that number, which an euen number measureth by an euen number.
                  As 8 is a number euenly euen. For 4 an euen number measureth 8 by 2, which is also an euen number. This definition hath much troubled many, and seemeth not a true definition, for that there are many numbers which euen numbers do measure, and that by euen numbers, which yet are not euenly euē numbers, after most mens minds: as 24. which 6 an euē number doth measure by foure, which is also an euen number, and yet as they thinke is not 24 an euenly euen number, for that 8 an euen nū

                     An euenly euen number is, when all the euen numbers which measure it, doo measure it by euen times, that is, by euen numbers, as 16. All the euen numbers whith measure 16, as are 8. 4. and 2. do measure it by euen numbers. As 8 by 2, twise 8 is 16:4 by 4, foure times 4 is 16: and 2 by 8, 8 times 2 is 16. Which particle (all euen number) added by Campane maketh 24 to be no euenly euen number. For that some one euen number measureth it by an odde number as 8 by 3. Flussates also is plainly of this minde,

                     A number euenly euen, is that which onely euen numbers do measure. As 16 is measured of none but of euen numbers, and therfore is euenly euen. There is also of Boetius geuen an other definition of more facilitie,

                  9 A number euenly odde (called in latine pariter impar) is that which an euen number measureth by an odde number.
                        The ninth definition.
                     
                  
                  As the number 6 which 2 an euen number measureth by 3 an odde number, thre times 2 is 6. Likewise 10. which 2. an euen number measureth by 5 an odde number. In this diffinition also is found by all the expositors of Euclide, the same want that was found in the diffinition next before. And for that it extendeth it selfe to large, for there are infinite numbers which euen numbers do measure by odde numbers, which yet after their mindes are not euēly odde nūbers, as for example 12. For 4 an euē nū
                     ber, measureth 12 by 
                        •
                      an odde number
                        •
                      three times 4 is 12. yet is not 12 as they thinke an euenly odde number. Wherfore Campane amendeth it after his thinking,
                        Campane.
                      by adding of this worde all, as he did in the first, and defineth it after this maner.
                  
                     A number euenly odde is, when all the euen numbers which measure it, do measure it by vneuen tymes, that is, by an odde number.
                  
                  As 10. is a number euenly odde,
                        An other definition.
                      for no euen number but onely 2 measureth 10. and that is by 5 an odde number. But not all the euen numbers which measure 12. do measure it by odde numbers. For 6 an euen number measureth 12 by 2 which is also euen. Wherfore 12 is not by this definition a number euenly odde. Flussates also offended with the ouer large generalitie of this definition to make the definition agree with the thing defined putteth it after this maner.

                        An other definition.
                      There is also an other definition of this kinde of number commonly geuen of more plaines, which is this.
                  
                     A number euenly odde in that which may be deuided into two equall partes, but that part cannot agayne be deuided into two equall partes: as 6. may be deuided into two equall partes into 3. and 3. but neither of them can be deuided into two equall partes: for that 3. is an odde number and suffereth no such diuision.
                        An other definition.
                     
                  
               
               
                  10 A number oddly euen (called im lattin in pariter par) is that which an odde number measureth by an euen number.
                        The tenth definition.
                     
                  
                  As the number 12: for 3. an odde number measureth 12. by 4. which is an euen number: three times 4. is 12.
                  This definition is not founde in the greeke neither was it doubtles euer in this maner written by Euclide:
                        This definition not found in the Greeks.
                      which thing the slendernes and the imperfection thereof and the absurdities following also of the same declare most manifestly. The definition next before geuen is in substance all one with this, For what number soeuer an euen
                        •
                      number doth measure by an odde, the selfe same number doth an odde number measure by an euen. As 2. an euē number measureth 6. by 3. an odde number. Wherfore 3. an odde number doth also measure the same number 6. by 2. an euē nūber. Now if these two definitions be definitions of two distinct kindes of numbers, then is this number 6. both euenly euen, and also euenly odde and so is contayned vnder two diuers kindes of numbers. Which is directly agaynst the authoritie of Euclide who playnely. p

                        An other definition.

                  The cause why that Campanus and Flussates were so scrupelous in amending (as they supposed) the two definitions before,

What in this can be spokē more playnely? So that by Euclide it is no inconuenience that on number, as 12, f

In respect that 6. an euen number measureth 12. by 2. an euen number, 12 is a number euenly euen: and in respect that 4. an euen number measureth 12. by 3. an odde number, 12. is a number euenly odde. And thus iudge ye of all others like.

As for example 48: which may be deuided into two equall partes, namely, into 24. and 24. Agayne 24. which is on of the partes may be deuided into two equall partes 12. and 12. Agayne 12. into 6. and 6. And agayne 6 may be deuided into two equall partes, into 3. and 3: but 3. cannot be deuided into two equall partes. Wherefore the deuision there stayeth: and continueth not till it come to vnitie as it did in these numbers which are euenly euen only.

                     12 A prime (or first) number is that, which onely vnitie doth measure.
                  As 5.7.11.13. For no number measureth 5, but onely vnitie. For v. vnities make the number 5. So no number measureth 7, but onely vnitie .2. taken 3. times maketh 6. which is lesse then 7: and 2. taken 4. times is 8, which is more then 7. And so of 11.13. and such others. So that all prime numbers,
                        Prime numbers called incomposed numbers.
                      which also are called first numbers, and numbers vncomposed, haue no part to measure thē, but onely vnitie.
               
               
                  
                     
                        The thirtenth definition.
                     13 Numbers prime the one to the other are they, which onely vnitie doth measure, being a common measure to them.
                  As 15. and 22. be numbers prime the one to the other .15. of it selfe is no prime number, for not onely

vnitie doth measure it, but also the numbe

So that although neither of these two numbers 15. and 22. be a prime or incomposed number, but eyther haue partes of his owne, whereby it may be measured beside vnitie: yet compared together, they are prime the one to the other: for no one number doth as a common measure, measure both of them but onely vnitie, which is a common measure to all numbers. The numbers 5. and 3. which measure 15. will not measure 22: againe, the numbers 2. and 11. which measure 22, do not measure 15.
               
               
                  14 A number composed, is that which some one number measureth.

                  A number composed is not measured onely by vnitie, as was a prime number, but hath some number which measureth it. As 15: the number 3. measureth 15, namely, taken 5. times. Also the number 5. measureth 15, namely, taken 3. times. 5. times 
                        •
                     , and 3. times 5, is 15. Likewise 18. is a composed number, it is measured by these numbers 6.3.9.2. and so of others. These numbers are also called commonly second numbers, as contrary to prime or first numbers.
               
               
                  15 Numbers composed the one to the other, are they, which some one number, being a common measure to them both, doth measure.
                        The fiftenth definition.
                     
                  
                  As 12. and 8. are two composed numbers the one to the other. For the number 4, is a common measure to them both: 4. taken three times maketh 12: and the same 4. taken two tymes maketh 8. So are 9. and 15: 3. measureth them both. Also 10. and 25: for 5. measureth both of them: and so infinitely of others. In thys do numbers composed the one to the other or second numbers, differre from numbers prime the one to the other: for that two numbers being composed the one to the other, ech of them seuerally is of necessitie a composed number. As in the examples before 8. and 12. are composed numbers: likewise 9. and 15: also 10, and 25: but if they be two numbers prime the one to the other, 
                        •
                     it is not of necessitie, that ech of them seuerally be a prime number. As 9. and 22. are two numbers prime the one to the other: no one number measureth both of them: and yet neither of them in it selfe and in his owne nature is a prime number, but ech of them is a composed number. For 3. measureth 9, and 11. and 2. measure 22.
               
               
                  16 A number is sayd to multiply a number, when the number multiplyed,
                        The sixtenth definition.
                      is so oftentimes added to it selfe, as there are in the number multiplying vnities: and an other number is produced.
                  In multiplication are euer required two numbers, the one is whereby ye multiply, commonly called the multiplier or multiplicant, the other is that which is multiplied.
                        Two numbers required in multiplication.
                      The number by which an other is multiplied, namely, the multiplyer, is sayd to multiply. As if ye will multiply 4. by 3, then is three sayd to multiply 4: therefore according to this definition, because in 3. there are three vnities: adde 4,3. times to it selfe, saying 3. times 4: so shall ye bring forth an other number, namely, 12, which is the summe produced of that multiplication: and so of all other multiplications.
               
               
                  17 When two numbers multiplying them selues the one the other, produce an other:
                        The seuententh definition.
                      the number produced is called a plaine or superficiall number. And the numbers which muliply them selues the one by the other, are the sides of that number.
                  As let these two numbers 3. and 6, multiply the one the other, saying, 3. times 6, or sixe tymes 3, they shall produce 18. Thys number 18. thus produced, is called a plaine number, or a superficiall number. And the two multiplying numbers which produced 12, namely, 3. and 6,

are the sides of the same superficiall or plaine number, that is, the length and breadth thereof. Likewise if 9. multiply 11, or eleuen nine, there shal be produced 99. a plaine number, whose sides are the two numbers 9. and 11 
                        •
                      as the length and breadth of the same. They are called plaine and superficiall numbers,
                        Why they are called superficiall numbers.
                      because being described by their vnities on a plaine superficies, they represent some superficiall forme or figure Geometricall, hauing length and breadth. As ye see of this example: and so of others. And all such plaine or superficiall numbers do euer represent right angled figures as appeareth in the example.
               
               
                  
                  
                     
                        The eightenth definition.
                     18 When three numbers multiplyed together ye one into the other, produce any number, the number produced, is called a solide number: and the numbers multiplying them selues the one into ye other, are the sides therof.
                  As taking these three nūbers 3.4. 5. multiply the one into the other.

First 4. into 5. saying, foure times 5. is 20: then multiply that number produced, name
                        •
                     y, 20. into 3: which is the third number, so shall ye produce 60. which is a solide number: and the three numbers which produced the number, namely, 3.4. and 5. are the sides of the same. And they are called solide numbers,
                        Why they are called solid numbers.
                      because being described by their vnities, they represent solide and bodylicke figures of Geometry, which haue length, breadth, and thicknes. As ye see this number 60. expressed here by hys vnities. Whose length is hys side 5, his breadth is 3, and thicknes 4. And thus may ye do of all other three nūbers multiplying the one the other.
               
               
                  
                     
                        The ninetenth definition.
                     19 A square number is that which is equally equall: or that which is contayned vnder two equall numbers.
                  As multiply two equall numbers the one into the other. As 9. by 9. ye

shall produce 81, which is a square number. Euclide calleth it a number equally equall, because it is produced of the multiplication of two equall numbers the one into the other. Which numbers are also sayd in the second definition to contayne a square number. As in the definitions of the second booke two lines are sayd to containe a square or a parallelogramme figure. It is called a square number,
                        Why it is called a square number.
                      because being described by his vnities it representeth the figure of a square in Geometry. As ye here see doth the number 81. whose sides, that is to say, whose length and breadth, are 9. and 9, equall numbers: which also are sayd to contayne the square number 81: and so of others.
               
               
                  
                     
                        The twenteth definition.
                     20 A cube number is that which is equally equall equally: or that which is contayned vnder three equall numbers.
                  As multiply three equall numbers the one into

the other, as 9, 9, and 9: first 9. by 9, so shall ye haue 81: which agayne multiply by 9, so shall ye produce 729. which is a cube number. And Euclide calleth it a number equally equall equally, because it is produced of the multiplication of three equall numbers the one into the other: which three numbers are sayd in the second definition (wherein he speaketh more applying to Geometry) to contayne the cube number. It is therefore called a cube number,
                        Why it is called a cube number.
                      because being described by hys vnities, it representeth the forme of a cube in Geometry, whose sides, that is to say, whose length, breadth, and thicknes, are the three equall numbers 9, 9, and 9, of which he was produced: which three sides also are sayd to containe the cube number 729: beholde here the description therof.

                     21 Numbers proportionall are, when the first is to the second equemultiplex, as the third is to the fourth, or the selfe same part, or the selfe same partes.
                  Here he defineth which numbers are called proportionall, that is, what numbers haue one and the selfe same proportion. For example 6. to 3: and 4. to 2, are numbers proportionall, and haue one and th

                      self same proportion: for 6. the first is to 3. the secōd equemultiplex, as 4. the third is to 2. the fourth:

                      of the v. booke, Euclide gaue a 
                        •
                     arre other definition of magnitudes proportionall, and much vnlike to this which he here geueth of numbers proportionall:
                        Why the definition of proportionall magnitudes is vnlike to the definitio of proportionall numbers.
                      the reason is as there also was partly noted, for that there he gaue a definition common to all quantities discrete and continuall, rationall, and irrationall: and therefore was constrayned to geue the definition by the excesse, equalitie or want of their equemultiplices, and that generally onely: for that irrationall quantities haue no certayne part or common measure to be measured by or knowen, neyther can they be expressed by any certayne numbers. But here in this place because in numbers there are no irrationall quantities, but all are certaynly knowen, so that both they and the proportions betwene them may be expressed by numbers certayne and knowen, by reason of their partes certayne, and for that they haue some common measure to measure them (at the lest vnitie which is a common measure to all numbers) he geueth here this definition of proportionall numbers, by that the one is like equemultiplex to the other, or the same part, or the same partes: which definition is much easier then was the other: and is not so large, as is the other, neither extendeth it self generally to all kinde of quantities rationall and irrationall, but contayneth it selfe within the limites and bondes of rationall quantitie and numbers.
               
               
                  22 Like plaine numbers, and like solide numbers, are such,
                        The twenty two definition.
                      which haue their sides proportionall.
                  Before he shewed that a plaine number hath two sides, and a solide number three sides. Now he sheweth by this definition which plaine numbers, and which solide numbers are like the one to the other. The likenes of which numbers dependeth altogether of the proportions of the sides of these numbers. So that if the two sides of one plaine number, haue the same proportion the one to the other, that the two sides of the other plaine number haue the one to the other, then are such two plaine numbers like. For an example 6 and 24 be two plaine numbers, the sides of 6 be 2 and 3, two tymes 3 make 6: the sides of 24 be 4 and 6, foure times 6 makes 24. Againe the same proportion that is betwene 3 and 2 the sides of 6. is also betwene 6 and 4 the sides of 24. Wherfore 24 and 6 be two like plaine and superficiall numbers. And so of other plaine numbers. After the same manner is it in solide numbers. If three sides of the one be in like proportion together, as are the three sides of the other, then is the one solide number like to the other. As 24 and 192 be solide numbers, the sides of 24. are 2. 3. and 4, two tymes there taken 4 times are 24. the sides of 192 are 4.6. and 8: for foure tymes 6. 8 times make 192. Againe the proportion of 4 to 3 is sesquitercia, the proportion of 3 to 2 is sesquialtera, which are the proportions of the sides of the one solide number, namely, of 24: the proportion betwene 8 and 6 is sesqu

                     ercia, the proportion betwene 6 and 4 is sesquialtera, which are the proportions of the sides of the other solide number, namely, of 191. And they are one and the same with the proportione of the

If there be geuen two vnequall numbers, and if in taking the lesse continually from the greater, the number remayning do not measure the number going before, vntill it shall come to vnitie: then are those numbers which were at the beginning geuen, prime the one to the other.

whole number BA, wherfore it also measureth that which remayneth, namely, the number FA (by the 4. cōmon sentence of the seuenth). But the number AF measureth the number DG, wherfore E also measureth DG.

Suppose that HA be the number whereat the stay is made, which also being subtrahed out of GC leaueth nothing. Wherfore HA measureth GC wherfore also it measureth FH by the 5. common sentence of the seuenth. And for as much as it also measureth i

               ¶The 1. Probleme. The 2. Proposition. Two numbers being geuen not prime the one to the other, to finde out their greatest common measure.
               SVppose the two numbers geuen not prime the one to the other to be AB and CD. It is required to finde out the greatest common measure of the said numbers AB and CD.
                  Two cases in this probleme. Now the numbe
                     •
                   
                  CD either measureth

the number AB or not. If CD measure AB it also measureth it selfe.The first case. Wherefore CD is a common measure to the numbers CD and AB. And it is manifest also that it is the greatest common measure
                     •
                   for there is no number greater then CD that will measure CD.
               
               
                  The second case.But if CD do not measure AB, then if of the numbers AB
                  
and CD, the lesse be continually taken away from the greater, there will before you come to vnitie, be left a number, which will measure the number going before (by the 1. of the seuenth). For if there should not, then should the numbers AB and CD be prime the one to the other, which is contrary to the supposition. Let the sayd number left by the continuall substraction of the lesse number out of the greater be FC. So that le

                  t CF do so measure AE that there remayne nothing. Then I say that CF is a common measure to the numbers AB and CD. For forasmuch as CF measureth AE, and AE measureth DF,
                  Demonstratiō of the second case. therefore CF also measureth DF (by the fifth common sentence of the seuenth) and it likewise measureth it selfe, wherfore it also measureth the whole CD (by the sixth common sentence of the seuenth
                     •
                  )
                     •
                   but CD measureth BE, wherefore CF also measureth BE (by the 
                     •
                  ifte common sentence of the seuenth). And it measureth also EA:That CF is a common measure to the numbers AB and CD. wherefore it also measureth the whole BA (by the sixth common sentence of the seuenth): and it also measureth CD as we haue before proued: wherefor
                     •
                   the number CF measureth the numbers AB &amp; CD wherfore the number CF is a commō measure to the numbers AB &amp; CD.
               
               I say also that it is the greatest common measure. For if CF be not the greatest commō measure to AB and CD,
                  That CF is the greatest common measure to AB and CD. let there be a number greater then

                  CF, which measureth AB and CD: which let be G. And forasmuch as G measureth CD, and CD measureth BE, therefore G also measureth BE (by the 
                     ••
                  ft common sentence of the seuenth). And it measureth the whole AB, wherefore also it measureth the residue, namely, AE (by the 4. common sentence of the se
                  
                     •
                  enth). But AE measureth DF, wherefore G also measureth DF (by the foresayd 5. common sentence of the seuenth). And it measureth the whole CD. Wherefore it also measureth the residue FC: namely, the greater number the lesse: which is impossible. No number therefore greater then CF shall measure those numbers AB and CD: wherefore CF is the greatest common measure to AB and CD: which was required to be done.
               
                  Corrolary.
                  
                     Hereby it is manifest, that if a number measure two numbers it shall also measure their greatest common measure. For if it measure the whole &amp; the part taken away, it shall alwayes measure the residue also, which residue is at the length, the greatest common measure of the two numbers geuen.
               
            
            
               ¶The 2. Probleme. Th 3. Proposition. Thre numbers being geuē, not prime the one to the other: to finde out their greatest common measure.
               SVppose the three numbers geuen not prime the one to the other

to be A, B, C. Now it is required vnto the sayd numbers A, B, C to finde out the greatest common measure. Take the greatest common measure of the two numbers A and B (by the 2 of the seuenth) which let be D: which number D either measureth the number C or not.
               First let D measure C. And it also measureth the numbers A and B,
                  Two cases in this Proposition. wherfore D measureth the numbers A, B, C. Wherefore D is a common measure vnto the numbers A, B, C. Then I say also, that it is the greatest common measure vnto them. For if D be not the greatest common measure vnto the numbers A, B, C,
                  The first case. let some number greater then D measure the numbers A, B, C. And let the same number be E. Now forasmuch as E measureth the numbers A, B, C, it measureth also the numbers A, B. Wherefore it measureth also

the greatest common measure of the numbers A, B (by the Corollary

of the second of the seuenth). B

                  t the greatest common measure of the numbers A, B, is the number D (by construction). Wherefore the number E measureth the number D, namely, the greater the lesse: which is impossible. Where

                  ore no number greater thē 
                  D measureth the nūbers A, B, C. Wherefore D is the greatest common measure to the numbers A, B, C.
               
               
                  The second case.But now suppose that D do not measure C. First I say that D &amp; C are not prime numbers the one to the other. For forasmuch as the numbers A, B, C, are not prime the one to the other (by supposition) some one number will measure them: but that number that measureth the numbers A, B, C, shall also measure the numbers A, B, and shall likewise measure the greatest cōmon measure of AB, namely, D (by the Corollary of the second of the seuēth). And the sayd number measureth also C. Wherfore some one number measureth the numbers D and C. Wherefore D and C are not prime the one to the other.
               Now then let there be taken (by the 2. of the seuenth) the greatest common measure vnto the numbers D and C, which let be the number E. And forasmuch as E measureth D, and D measureth the numbers A, B, therefore E also measureth the numbers A, B (by the sixt common sentēce): and it measureth also C. Wherfore E measureth the nūbers A, B, C. Wherefore E is a common measure vnto the numbers A, B, C. I say also that it is the greatest. For if E be not the greatest common measure vnto the numbers A, B, C, let there be some number greater then E, which measureth the nūbers A, B, C. And let the same number be 
                     
                        •
                     . And forasmuch as F measureth the numbers A, B, C: it measureth also the numbers A, B. Wherefore also it measureth the greatest common measure of the numbers A, B (by the Corollary of the 2. of the seuenth). But the greatest common measure of the numbers A, B, is D. Wherefore E measureth D. And it measureth also the number C. Wherefore F measureth the numbers D, C. Wherefore also (by the same Corollary) it measureth the greatest common measure of the numbers D, C. But the greatest common measure of the numbers D, C, is E. Wherfore F measureth E, namely, the greater number the lesse: which is impossible. Wherefore no number greater then E shall measure the nūbers A, B, C. Wherfore E is the greatest common measure to the numbers A, B, C: which was required to be done.
               
                  ¶Corollary.
                  Wherefore it is manifest, that if a number measure three numbers, it shall also measure their greatest common measure. And in like sort more numbers being geuē not prime the one to the other may be found out their greatest common measure, and the Corollary will followe.

For the numbers A and BC are either prime the one to the other, or not. First let A and BC be prime the one to the other.The first case. And deuide the number BC into those vnities which are in it.

Then I say, that the numbers AB and DE added together, are of the numbers C and F added together the selfe same partes, that AB is of C.
                  Construction. For forasmuch

as what partes AB is of C, the selfe same partes is DE of F: therefore how many partes of C there are in AB, so many partes of F are there in DE. Deuide AB into the partes of C, that is, into AG and GB, and likewise DE into the partes of F, that is, into DH and HE.
                  Demonstration. Now then the multitude of these AG and GB is equall to the multitude of these DH and HE. And forasmuch as what part AG is of C, the selfe same part is DH of F

Then I say, that the residue EB is of the residue FD the self same part that the whole AB is of the whole CD. What part AE is of CF, the selfe same part let EB
                  
be of GC. And for that what part AE is of CF, the same part is EB of CG, therefore what part AE is of CF, the same part (by the 5. of the seuenth) is AB of FG. But what part AE is of CF, the same part (by supposition) is AB of CD. Wherfore what part AB is of FG, the self same part is AB of CD.
                  Construction. Wherefore AB is one &amp; the selfe same part of both these numbers GF and CD. Wherefore GF is equall vnto CD (by the second common sentence of the seuenth). Take away CF which is common to them both. Wherefore the residue GC is equall vnto the residue FD.
                  Demonstration. And forasmuch as what part AE is of CF, the same part is EB of GC: but GC is equall vnto FD: therefore what part AE is of FC, the selfe same part is EB of FD. But what part AE is of CF, the same part is AB of CD. Wherefore what part EB is of FD, the same part is AB of CD. Wherefore the residue EB is of the residue FD the selfe same part that the whole AB is of the whole CD: which was required to be demonstrated.
            
            
               ¶ The 6. Theoreme. The 8. Proposition. If a number be of a number the selfe same partes, that a part taken away is of a part taken away, the residue also shall be of the residue the selfe same partes that the whole is of the whole.
               
                  SVppose that the number AB be of the number CD the selfe same partes that the part taken away AE is of the part taken CF. Then I say, that the residue EB is of the residue FD the selfe same partes that the whole AB is of the whole CD. Vnto AB put an equall nūber GH.

                     ction. Wherefore what partes GH is of CD, the selfe same partes is AE of CF. Deuide GH into the partes of CD, that is, GK, and KH, and likewise AE into the partes of CF, that is, into AL and LE. Now then the multitude of these GK and KH, is equall vnto the multitude of these AL and LE.
                  Demonstration. And forasmuch as what part GK is of CD, the selfe same part is AL of CF: but CD is greater then CF. Wherefore GK is greater then AL. Put vnto AL an equall

number MG. Wherefore what part GK is of CD, the same part is GM of CF. Wherefore the residue MK is (by the 7. of the seuenth) of the residue FD, the selfe same part that the whole GK is of the whole CD. Againe, forasmuch as what part KH is of CD, the selfe same part is EL of CF: but CD is greater then CF. Wherefore HK is greater then EL. Put vnto EL an equall number KN. Wherefore what part KH is of CD, the selfe same part is KN of CF. Wherefore the residue also NH is (by the 7. of the seuenth) of the residue FD, the selfe same part that the whole KH is of the whole DC. Wherefore both these MK and NH added together are (by the 5. of the seuenth) of DF the self same partes that the whole HG is of the whole CD. But both these MK and NH added together, are equall vnto EB. And HG is equall vnto BA. Wherefore the residue EB is of the residue FD the selfe same partes that the whole AB is of the whole CD: which was required to be proued.
               
                  ¶An other demonstration after Flussates.
                  
                  Suppose that the number AB be of the number CD the selfe same partes that the part taken away AE is of the part taken away CF.
                        An other demonstration after Flussates.
                      Then I say, that the residue EB is of the residue FD the selfe same partes that the whole AB is of the whole CD. Let EB be of CI the self same partes that AB is of CD, or AE of C
                        •
                     . Now forasmuch as EB is of CI the selfe same partes that AE is of CF: therefore both these AE and EB added together are of both these CF and CI added

together (that is, the whole AB is of the whole FI) the selfe same partes that AE is of CF (by the sixt of this booke). But what partes AE is of CF, the selfe same partes is the number AB of the number CD (by supposition). Wherefore what partes the number AB is of the nūber FI, tho selfe same partes is the same number AB of the number CD. Wherefore the numbers FI and CD are equall. Take away the number CF which is common to them both. Wherefore the numbers remayning CI and 
                        •
                     D are equall. Wherefore what partes the number EB is of the number CI, the selfe same partes is the same number EB of the number FD. But what partes EB is of CI, the selfe same partes (by construction) is AB of CD. Wherefore what partes the residue EB is of the residue FD, the selfe same partes is the whole AB of the whole CD: which was required to be proued.

selfe same part, that an other number D is of an other number EF. And let A be lesse then D. Then I say, that alternately what part or partes A is of D, the selfe same part or partes is BC of EF.Construction. For forasmuch as what part A is of BC, the selfe same part is D of EF, therefore how many

numbers there are in BC equall vnto A, so many are there in

EF equall vnto D. Deuide BC into the numbers equall vnto A, that is, into BG &amp; GC: and likewise EF into the numbers equall vnto D, that is, into EH and HF. Now then the multitude of these BG and GC, is equall vnto the multitude of these EH &amp; HF.Demonstration. And forasmuch as the numbers BG and GC are equall the one to the other, the numbers also EH and HF are equall the one to the other: and the multitude of these BG &amp; GC is equall vnto the multitude of these EH and HF. Wherefore what part or partes BG is of EH, the self same part or partes is GC of HF. Wherefore what part or partes BG is of EH, the selfe same part or partes (by the fift &amp; sixt of the seuenth) are BG and GC added together, of EH and HF added together. But BG is equall vnto A, and EH vnto D. Wherefore what part or partes A is of D, the selfe same part or partes is BG of EF: which was required to be demonstrated.
            
            
               ¶The 8. Theoreme. The 10. Proposition. If a number be partes of a number, and an other nūber the self same partes of an other number, then alternately what partes or part the first is of the third, the selfe same partes or part is the second of the fourth.
               SVppose that the number AB be of the number C the selfe same partes, that an other number DE is of an other nūber F, and let AB be lesse then DE. Then I say, that alternately also what part or partes AB is of DE, the selfe same partes or part is C of F. Forasmuch as what partes AB is of C, the selfe same partes is DE of F:Construction. therefore how many partes of C there are

in AB, so many partes of F also are there in DE. Deuide AB into the partes of C, that is, into AG and GB. And likewise DE into the partes of F, that is, DH and HE. Now then the multitude of these AG and GB, is equall vnto the multitude of these DH and HE.
                  Demonstration. And forasmuch as what part AG is of C, the selfe same part is DH of F, therefore alternately also (by the former) what part or partes AG is of DH, the selfe same part or partes is C of F. And by the same reason also what part or partes GB is of HE, the same part or partes is C of F. Wherefore what part or partes AG is of DH, the selfe same part or partes is AB of DE (by the 6. of the seuenth). But what part or partes AG is of DH, the selfe same part or partes is it proued that C is of F. Wherefore what partes or part AB is of DE, the selfe same partes or part is C of F: which was required to be proued.

Then I say that as one of the antecedentes, namely, A is to one of the consequentes, namely, to B, or as C is to D, so are all the antecedentes: namely, A and C to all the consequentes,

namely, to B and D. For forasmuch as (by supposition) as A is to B, so is C to D, therfore what parte or partes A is of B, the selfe same part or partes is C of D (by the 21. definition of this booke) wherefore alternately what part or partes A is of C the selfe same parte or partes is B of D (by the ninth and tenth of the seuenth) wherefore both these numbers added together,Demonstration.

A is of B the selfe same part or partes is C of D. Therfore alternately what part or partes A is of C the selfe same part or partes is B of D (by the 9. of the seuenth) &amp; also (by the 10. of the same): wherfore as A is to C, so is B to D (by the 21. definition of this booke): which was required to be proued.
               
               Here is to be noted, that although in the foresayd example and demonstration the number A be supposed to be lesse then the number B, and so the number C is lesse then the number D:
                     Note.
                   yet will the same serue also though A be supposed to be greater then B, wherby also C shall be greater then D, as in th

Booke) how multiplex A is to B, so multiplex is C to D, and therefore what part or partes B is of A, the selfe same part or partes is D of C. Wherefore alternately what part or partes B is of D, the selfe same part or partes is A of C, and therefore by the same definition, B is to D, as A is to C. And so must you vnderstand of the former Proposition next going before.

as A is to B, so is D to E: therefore alternately also (by the 13 of the seuenth) as A is to D, so is B to E. Againe, for that as B is to C, so is E to F:

so many numbers are there in EF equall vnto D. Deuide (I say) BC into the vnities which are in it, that is, into BG, GH, and HC. And deuide likewise EF into the numbers equall vnto D, that is, into EK, KL, and LF. Now then the multitude of these BG, GH, and HC, is equall vnto the multitude of these EK, KL, LF.Demonstration. And forasmuch as these vnities BG, GH, and HC, are equall the one to the other, and these numbers EK, KL, &amp; LF, are also equall the one to the other, and the multitude of the vnities BG, GH, and HC, are equall vnto the multitude of the numbers EK, KL, &amp; LF: therefore as vnitie BG is to the number EK, so is vnitie GH to the number KL, and also vnitie HC to the number LF.

A produceth also D (by the 16. of this booke.) And by the same reason C multiplieng B produceth E. Now then one number C multiplieng two numbers A and B, produceth the numbers D and E.

multiplieng two numbers C and D, produceth G and E. VVherfore by the 17 of the seuenth, as C is to D, so is G to E. But as C is to D, so is A to B, wherfore as A is to B, so is G to E.Construction. Againe, forasmuch as A multiplieng C produced G, and B multiplieng C produced F:Demonstration. therfore two numbers A and B, multiplieng one nūber C, do produce G &amp; F. VVherfore by the 18. of the seuenth, as A is to B, so is G to F. But as A is to B, so is G to E: wherfore as G is to E, so is G to F.

                  An assumpt added by Campane.
                  Here Campane addeth, that it is needeles to demonstrate, that if one number haue to two numbers one and the same proportion, the said two numbers shall be equall: or that if they be equal, one number hath to them one and the same proportion. For (saith he) if G haue vnto E and F one and the same proportion, thē either, what part or partes G is to E, the same part or parts is G also of F: or how multiplex G is to E, so multiplex is G to F (by the 21. definition) And therfore by the 2 and 3 common sentence, the said numbers shall be equall. And so conuersedly, if the two numbers E and F be equal, then shall the numbers E and F be either the selfe same parte or partes of the number G, or they shall be equemultiplices vnto it. And therfore by the same definition the number G shall haue to the numbers E and F one and the same proportion.

                  ber which is produced of the extremes, be equall to the square made of the middle number, those three numbers shall be in proportion.
               SVppose there be three numbers in proportion, A, B, C, as A is to B, so let B be to C.This proposition in numbers demonstrateth that which the 17. of the sixth demonstrateth in lines. Then I say that the number produced of A and C is equall to the square number which is made of B. Put vnto B an equall number D.

Wherfore as A is to B, so is D to C. Wherfore that which is produced of A into C, is equal vnto that which is produced of B into D. But that which is produced of B into D is equal to that which is made of B (for B is equal vnto D) wherfore that which is produced of A into C is equal to that which is made of B.

               SVppose that CD &amp; EF be the least numbers that haue one &amp; the same proportion with the numbers A and B.Demonstration leading to an impossibility. Then I say, that the number CD so many times measureth the number A, as the number EF measureth the number B. For forasmuch as by supposition CD is to EF, as A is to B, and CD and EF are also supposed to be lesse then A and B: therefore CD and EF are either part or partes of A and B (by the 4. of this booke, and by the 21. definition of the same). But they are not partes. For if it be possible, let CD be partes of A. VVherfore EF is the selfe same partes of B, that CD is of A. Wherefore how many partes of A there are in CD, so many partes are there of B in EF. Deuide CD into the partes of A, that is, into CG and GD. And likewise deuide EF into the partes of B, that is, into EH and HF. Now then the multitude

of these CG and GD, is equall vnto the multitude of these EH &amp; HF. And forasmuch as CG and GD are numbers equall the one to the other, and these numbers EH and HF are also equall the one to the other, and the multitude of these CG and GD, is equall to the multitude of these EH and HF: therefore as CG is to EH, so is GD to HF. Wherefore (by the 12. of the seuenth) as one of the antecedentes is to one of the consequentes, so are all the antecedentes to all the consequentes. Wherefore as CG is to EH, so is CD to EF. Wherfore CG and DH

Now forasmuch as the least numbers in any proportion measure any other numbers hauing the same proportion equally, the greater the greater, and the lesse the lesse (by the 21. of the seuenth) that is, the antecedent the antecedent, and the consequent the consequent: therefore C so many times measureth A, as D measureth B.

For forasmuch as A is a composed number, some number must needes measure it (by the 14. definition of the seuenth). Let there be a number that measureth it, and let the same be B. Now if B be a prime number then is that manifest which we seeke for:Demonstration l

And forasmuch as C measureth B, and B measureth A: therefore C also measureth A (by the 5. common sentēce): and if C be a prime number then is that manifest which we sought for. But if it be a composed number some number shall measure it: and the like consideration being had there shall at the length be found some prime number which measureth the number going before, which shall also measure A. For if there be not found any such prime number then shall infinite numbers decresing measure the sayd number A of which the one is lesse thē the other, which is impossible in numbers. VVherfore some prime number shall at the length be found which shall measure the number going before and which shall also measure the number A (by the 5. common sentence). Euery cōposed number therefore is measured by some prime number: which was required to be proued.
               
                  ¶ An other way.
                  Suppose that A be a composed number.An other demonstration. Then I say that some prime number measureth it. For forasmuch as A is a composed number, some number shall measure it (by the 14. definition of the seuenth) Let the least number that measureth it be B.

Then I say that B is a prime number. For if B be not a prime number some number shall measure it. Let C measure it. Wherefore C is lesse then B. And forasmuch as C measureth B, and B measureth A, therfore C also measureth A being lesse then B, which by supposition is the least number that measureth A, which is absurd. Wherfore B is not a composed number, but a prime number, which was required to be proued.

               SVppose that there be a multitude of numbers geuen,

namely, A, B, and C. It is required to finde out the least numbers that haue one and the same proportion with these numbers A, B, C.
                  Two cases in this Proposition. These numbers A, B, C, are either prime the one to the other, or not prime. If A, B, C, be prime the one to the other, then are they the least that haue one and the same proportion with them (by the 23. of the seuenth).The first case.
               
               
                  The second case.But if they be not prime, take by the 3. of the seuenth, vnto A, B, C, the greatest common measure, which let be the number D. And how often D measureth euery one of these A, B, C,

Wherfore E, F, G, are by the 18. of the seuenth, in the selfe same proportion that A, B, C, are. Now then I say that they also are the least. For if E, F, G,

Suppose that the same nūbers be H, K, L, which shall measure the numbers A, B, C, equally. How many times H measureth A, so many vnities let there be in M. Wherfore either of these K and L measureth either of these B and C by those vnities which are in M (by the 21. of the seuenth). And forasmuch as H measureth A by those vnities which are in M, therfore M also measureth A by those vnities which are in H. And by the same reason M measureth either of these B and C by those vnities which are in either of these K and L. Wherefore M measureth these numbers A, B, C. And forasmuch as H measureth A by those vnities which are in M, therfore H multiplieng M, produceth A. And by the same reason E multiplieng D, produceth A. Wherfore that which is produced of E into D is equall to that which is produced of H into M. Wherfore (by the 19. of the seuenth) as E is to H, so is M to D. But E is greater then H, wherfore M also is greater then D, and it measureth these numbers A, B, C, which is impossible. For D is supposed to be the greatest common measure vnto A, B, C. Wherfore there shall be no other numbers lesse then E, F, G, and in the selfe same proportion with A, B, C. Wherfore E, F, G, are the lest numbers which haue one and the same proportion with A, B, C: which was required to be done.

It is required to finde out the lest numbers in continuall proportion, as many as shall be required, in the same proportion that A is to B.Construction. Let there be required foure. And let A multiplying him selfe produce C: and multiplying B let it produce D: and likewise let B multiplying him selfe produce E. And moreouer let A multiplying those numbers C, D, E,Demonstration. produce F, G, H: and let B multiplying E produce K. And forasmuch as A multiplying him selfe produced C, and multiplying B produced D, now then the number A multiplying two numbers A and B produced C &amp; D. Wherefore (by the 17. of the seuenth) as A is to B, so is C to D. Againe, forasmuch as A multiplying B produced D, and B multiplying him selfe produced E, therefore ech of those numbers A and B multiplying B, bringeth forth these numbers D and E. VVherefore (by the 18. of the seuenth) as A is to B, so D to E. But as A is to B, so is C to D. Wherefore as C is to D, so is D to E. And forasmuch as A multiplying C and D produced F and G, therefore (by the 17. of the seuenth) as C is to D, so is F to G. But as C is to D, so is A to B. Wherefore as A is to B, so is F to G. Againe forasmuch as A multiplying D and E produced G and H, therefore (by the 17. of the seuenth) as D is to E, so is G to H. But as D is to E, so is A to B. Wherefore as A is to B, so is G to H.

And forasmuch as those numbers A and B multiplying E produced H and K, therefore (by the 18. of the seuenth) as A is to B, so is H to K. And it is proued, that as A is to B, so is

Now I say, that they are also the lest. For forasmuch as A and B are the lest of all numbers that haue the same proportion with them: but the lest numbers that haue one &amp; the same proportion with them are prime the one to the other (by the 24. of the seuenth): therefore A and B are prime the one to the other: and ech of these numbers A &amp; B multiplying him selfe produced these numbers C and E, and likewise multiplying ech of these numbers C and E they produced F and K.

               SVppose that the numbers in continuall proportion being the least of all numbers that haue the same proportion with them be A, B, C, D.This proposition is the

                  h) the two least numbers that are in the same proportion that A, B, C, D, are, and let the same be the numbers E, F. And after that take thre numbers

all numbers that haue the same proportion with them, and likewise L, M, N, O, are the least of all numbers that are in the same proportion that A, B, C, D, are, and the multitude of these numbers A, B, C, D, is equall to the multitude of these L, M, N, O: therfore euery one of these A, B, C, D, is equall vnto euery one of these L, M, N, O. Wherefore A is equall vnto L, and D is equall vnto O. And forasmuch as L and O are prime the one to the other, and L is equall vnto A, and O is equall vnto D: therfore A and D are prime the one to the other: which was required to be proued.
            
            
               The 2. Probleme. The 4. Proposition. Proportions in the least numbers how many soeuer beyng geuen, to finde out the least numbers in continuall proportion in the said proportions geuē.
               SVppose that the proportions in the least numbers geuen, be A to B, C to D, and E to F. It is required to finde out the least numbers in continuall proportion, in the same proportion that A is to B, and that C is to D, and that E is to F. Take the least number whom B and C do measure, and let the same be G. And how often B measureth G, so many times let A measure H. And how oftē C measureth G, so many times let D measure K. Now E either measureth K or measureth it not.Two cases in this propositiō. The first case. First let it measure it. And how often E measureth K, so many times let F measure L. And forasmuch as how often A measureth H, so many times doth B measure G: therfore by the 17. of the seuenth, as A is to B, so is H to G. And by the same reasō as C is to D
                     •
                   so is 
                     •
                   to K, and moreouer as E is to F, so is K to L. Wherfore these numbers H, G, K, L, are in continuall proportion, and in the same proportion that A is to B, and that C is to D, and moreouer that E is to F. I say also that they are the least in those proportions
                     •
                  
                  Demonstration leading to an absurditie. For if H, G, K, L, be not the least numbers in continuall proportion, and in the same proportions that A is to B, and C to D, and E to F, then are there some numbers less
                     •
                   then H, G, K, L, in the same proportions that A is to B and C to D, and E to F, let those numbers be N, X, M, O. And forasmuch as A is to

B, so is N to X
                     •
                   and A and B are the lest, but the least measure

those numbers that haue one and the same proportion with them equally, the greater, the greater, and the lesse the lesse, that is, the antecedent, the antecedent, &amp; the consequent the consequent (by the 21. of the seuenth) therfore B measureth X. And by the same reason C also measureth X, wherfore B and C measure X. Wherfore the least number whom B and C measure, shall also by the 37 of the seuenth measure X. But the least number whome B and C measure is G. Wherefore G measureth X, the greater, the lesse, which is impossible. Wherfore there shall not be any lesse numbers then H, G, K, L, in continuall proportion, and in the same proportions that A is to B, and C to D, and E to F.
               But now suppose that E measure not K.The second case. And by the 36. of the seuenth, take the least number whome E and K measure, and let the same be M. And how often K measureth M, so often let either of these G and H measure either of these N and X.Demonstration. And how often E measureth M, so often let F measure O. And forasmuch as how often G measureth N, so often doth H measure X, therfore as 
                     •
                   is to G, so is X to N. But as H is to G, so is A to B Wherfore as A is to B, so is X to N. And by the same reason as C is to D, so is N to M. Againe, forasmuch as how often E measureth M, so often F measureth O, therfore as E is to F so is M to O. Wherfore X, N, M, O, are in continuall proportion, and in the same proportions that A is to B, and C to D, and E to F. I say also that

they are the least in that proportion. For if X, N, M, O, be not the least in continuall proportion, and in the same proportions that A is to B, and C to D, and E to F, then shall there be some numbers lesse then X, N, M, O, in continuall proportion, and in the same proportions that A is to B, and C to D, and E to F. Let the same be the numbers P, R, S, T. And for that as P is to R, so is A to B, and A and B are the least, but the least numbers measure those numbers that haue one &amp; the same proportiō with them equally, the greater the greater, and the lesse the lesse, that is, the antecedent the antecedent, and the consequent the consequent by the 21. of the seuenth, therfore B measureth R. And by the same reason also C measureth R. Wherefore B and C measure R. Wherfore the least number wh
                     •
                  m B and C measure shall also measure R (by the 37. of the seuenth). But the lest number whom B and C measure is G, wherfore G measureth R. And as G is to R, so is K to S. Wherfore K measureth S. And E also measureth S. Wherefore E and K measure S. Wherfore the least number whom E and K measure, shall (by the selfe same) measure S. But the least number whom E and K measures M. Wherefore M measureth S the greater the lesse, which is impossible. Wherfore there are no numbers lesse then X, N, M, O, in continuall proportion, &amp; in the same proportions that A is to B, and C to D, and E to F. Wherfore X, N, M, O are the least numbers in continuall proportion, and in the same proportions that A is to B, and C to D, and E to F: which was required to be done.

                  This proposition in numbers answereth to the of the sixth touching parellelogrammes.SVppose that A and B be playne or superficiall numbers, and let the sides of A be the numbers C and D, and let the sides of B, be the numbers E and F. Then I say that A is to B in that proportion that is composed of the sides. Take (by the fourth of the

eight) the least numbers in continuall proportion, and in the same proportions that C is to E, and D to F.
                  Construction. And let the same be the numbers G, H, K:Demonstration. so that as C is to E, so let G be to H, &amp; as D is to F, so let H be to K. Wherefore those numbers G, H, K, haue the proportions of the sides: but the proportion of G to K is con posed of that which G hath to H and of that which H hath to K: wherefore G is vnto K in that proportion which is composed of the sides. Now I say that as A is to B, so is G to K. For let D multiplying E produce L. And forasmuch as D multiplying C produced A, and multiplying E produced L: therefore (by the 17. of the seuenth) as C is to E, so is A to L. But as C is to E, so is G to H, wherefore as G is to H, so is A to L. Agayne forasmuch as E multiplying D produced L, &amp; multiplying F produced B: therefore (by the 17. of the seuenth) as D is to F, so is L to B. But as D is to F, so is H to K, wherefore as H is to K, so is L to B. And it is proued that as G is H, so is A to L. Wherefore of equalitie (by the 14. of the seuenth) as G is to K, so is A to B. But G is vnto K in that proportion which is composed of the sides, wherefore A is vnto B in that proportion which is composed of the sides: which was required to be demonstrated.
               
                  ¶An other demonstration of the same after Campane.
                  
                  Suppose that A and B be plaine numbers: and let the sides of A be the numbers C and D: and let the numbers E and F be the sides of the number B. And let D multiplying E produce the number G. Thē I say that the proportiō of

A to B is cōposed of the proportiōs of C to E &amp; D to F that is,

                     ber A to the sides of the superficiall number B. For forasmuch as D multiplying E produced G, and multiplying C it produced A, therefore by (the 17. of the seuenth) A is to G as C is to E: agayne forasmuch as E multiplying D produced G and multiplying F it produceth B, therefore by the same G is to B as D is to F. Wherefore the proportions of the sides namely, of C to E and of D to F are one and the same with the proportions of A to G and G to B. But (by the fifth definition of the sixth) the proportion of the extremes A to B is composed of the proportions of the meanes, namely, of A to G and G to B, which are proued to be one and the same with the proportions of the sides C to E, and D to F. Wherefore the proportion of the superficiall numbers A to B is cōposed of the proportions of the sides C to E, and D to F. Wherefore pla

               SVppose that there be numbers how many soeuer in continuall proportion, namely, f

That A, B, C, D, E, do not in continuall order measure one the other, it is manifest: for A measureth not B. Now I say, that neither shall any other of them measure any other of them. I say that A shall not measure C. For how many in multitude A, B, C, are, take so many of the lest numbers that haue one and the same proportion with A, B, C, (by the 35. of the seuenth) and let the same be F, G, H.Demonstration. And forasmuch as F, G, H are in the selfe same

proportion that A, B, C, are: and the multitude of these numbers A, B, C, is equall to the multitude of those numbers F, G, H, therefore of equalitie (by the 14. of the seuenth) as A is to C, so is F to H. And for that as A is to B, so is F to G, but A measureth not B, therefore neither doth F measure G. Wherefore F is not vnitie. For if F were vnitie, it should measure any number. But F and H are prime the one to the other (by the 3. of the eight). Wherefore F measureth not H: &amp; as F is to H, so is A to C, wherefore neither doth A measure C. In like sort may we proue that neither shall any other of the numbers A, B, C, D, E, measure any other of the numbers A, B, C, D, E: which was required to be demonstrated.

Then I say, that A the first measureth B the second. For if A do not measure B, neither shall any other measure any other (by the 7. of the eight): which (by supposition) is not true. For A is supposed to measure D. Now then A measuring D, shall also measure B: which was required to be proued.
            
            
               
               ¶ The 6. Theoreme. The 8. Proposition. If betwene two numbers there fall numbers in continuall proportion: how many numbers fall betwene them, so many also shall fall in continuall proportion betwene other numbers which haue the selfe same proportion.
               SVppose that betwene the two numbers A and B, do fall in continuall proportion the numbers C and D. And as A is to B, so let E be to F. Then I say, that how many numbers in continuall proportion do fall betwene A and B, so many numbers also in continuall proportion shall there fall betwene E and F. How many A, B, C, D, are in multitude, take (by the 35. of the seuenth) so many of the least numbers that haue one and the same proportion with A, B, C, D, and let the same be G, H, K, L. Wherefore their extremes G and I. are prime the one to the other (by the 3. of the eight). And forasmuch as A and C, and D and B, are in the selfe same proportion that G &amp; H, and K and L are,Demonstration. and the multitude of these numbers A, C, D, B, is equall to the multitude of these numbers G, H, K, L: therefore of equalitie (by the 14. of the seuenth) as A is to B, so is

G to L. But as A is to B, so is E to F. Wherefore as G is to L, so is E to F. But G and L are prime the one to the other: yea they are prime and the least. But the least numbers measure those numbers that haue the same proportion with them equally, the greater the greater, and the lesse the lesse (by the 21. of the seuenth) that is, the antecedent, the antecedent, &amp; the consequent, the consequent. Wherefore how many times G measureth E, so many times L measureth F
                     •
                   How often G measureth E, so often let H measure M, and K measure N Wherefore these numbers G, H, K, L, equally measure these numbers E, M, N, F. Wherefore (by the 18. of the seuēth) these nūbers G, H, K, L, are in the selfe same proportion that E, M, N, F, are. But G, H, K, L, are in the selfe same proportion that A, C, D, B, are: wherefore those numbers A, C, D, B, are in the selfe same proportion that E, M, N, F, are

                         proportionall. For the least numbers of that proportion differ the one from the other onely by vnitie or by two.

But if betwene the greater numbers of that proportion there should fall a meane proportionall then should there fall also a meane proportionall betwene the least numbers which haue the same proportion by this Proposition. But betwene numbers differing onely by vnitie or by two, there falleth no meane proportionall.
               
            
            
               ¶ The 7. Theoreme. The 9. Proposition. If two numbers be prime the one to the other, and if betwene them shall fall numbers in continuall proportion: how many numbers in continuall proportion fall betwene them, so many also shall fall in continuall proportion betwene either of those numbers and vnitie.
               SVppose that there be two numbers prime the one to the other A and B: and let there fall betwene them in continuall proportion these numbers C and D: and let E be vnitie. Then I say, that how many numbers in continuall proportion fall betwene A and B, so many also shall fall in continuall proportion betwene A and vnitie E:Construction. and likewise betwene B and vnitie E. Take (by the 35. of the seuenth) the two least numbers that are in the same proportion that A, C, D, B, are: and let the same be F and G: and then take three of the least nūbers that are in the same proportion that A, C, D, B, are: and let the same be H, K, L: and so alwaies in order one more, vntill the multitude of them be equall to the multitude of these numbers A, C, D, B: and those being so taken let them be M, N, X, O. Now it is manifest, that F multiplying him selfe produced H, and multiplying N produced M.Demonstration. And G multiplying him selfe produced L, and multiplying L produced O. And forasmuch as M, N, X, O, are (by supposition) the least of all numbers that haue the same proportion with G, F: and A, C, D, B, are (by the first of the eight) the least of all numbers that haue the same proportion with G, F: and the multitude of these numbers M, N, X, O, is equall to the multitude of these numbers A,

                   wherefore as vnitie E is to the number F, so is F to H. Againe forasmuch as F multiplying N produced M, therfore H measureth M by those vnities which are in F. And vnitie E measureth F by th

                  se vnities which are in F: wherefore (by the self same) vnitie E so many times measureth F, as H measureth M. Wherefore as vnitie E is to the numbers F, so is H to M. But it is proued, that as vnitie E is to the number F, so is F to H: wherefore as vnitie E is to the number F, so is F to H, and H to M. But M is equall vnto A

Wherefore how many numbers fall in continuall proportion betwene A and B: so many numbers also in continuall proportion fall there betwene vnitie E and the number A, and likewise betwene vnitie E

and the number

                  This proposition is the conuerse of the former. Then I say that how many numbers in continuall proportion there are betwene either of these A, B, and vnitie C, so many

numbers also in continuall proportion shall there fall betwene A and B. Let D multiplying F produce H, and let D multiplying H produce K, and like wise let F multiplying H produce L.
                  Construction. And for that by supposition as vnitie C is to the number D, so is D to E, therefore how many times vnitie C measureth the number D,
                  Demonstration. so many times doth D measure E. But vnitie C measureth D by those vnities which are in D

Againe for that as vnitie C is to the number D, so is E to A, therefore how many times vnitie C measureth the number D, so many times E measureth A. But vnitie C measureth D, by those vnitie
                     •
                   which are in D, therefore E measureth A by those vnities which are in D. Wherefore D multilying E produced A. And by the same reason F multiplying himselfe produced G, and multiplying G produced B. And forasmuch as D multiplying himselfe produced E, and multiplying F produced H, therefore (by the 17. of the seuenth) as D is to F, so is E to H. And by the same reason as D is to F, so is H to G. Wherefore as E is to H, so is H to G. Agayne forasmuch as D multiplying E produced A, and multiplying H produced K, therefore (by the 17. of the seuēth) as E is to H, so is A to K. But as E is to H, so is D to F, therefore as D is to F, so is A to K. Againe forasmuch as D multiplying H produced K, and F multiplying H produced L, therefore (by the 17. of the seuenth) as D is to F, so is K to L.

Then I say that betwene these square numbers A and B, there is one meane proportionall number, and also that A is vnto B in double proportion of that which C is to D. Let C multiplieng D produce E.The first part of this proposition demonstrated. And forasmuch as A is a square nūber, &amp; the side thereof is C,

therfore C multiplieng himselfe produced A. And by the same reason D multiplieng himselfe produced B. Now forasmuch as C multiplieng C produced A, and multiplieng D produced E, therfore (by the 17. of the seuenth) as C is to D, so is A to E. Againe forasmuch as C multiplieng D produced E, and D multiplieng himselfe produced B, therefore these two numbers C and D multiplieng one number, namely, D, produce E and B.

Wherefore betwene these square numbers A and B, there is one meane proportionall number, namely, E.The second part demonstrated. Now also I say that A is vnto B in double proportion of that which C is to D. For forasmuch as there are three numbers in continuall proportion, A, E, B, therfore (by the 10. definition of the fift) A is vnto B in double proportiō of that which A is to E.

                        A Corollary added by Campane.
                      For if it should produce a cube number, then the number multiplyed should also be a cube number (by this Proposition) which is contrary to the supposition. For it is supposed to be no cube number. And if a cube number multiplying a number produce a number not cube, the number multiplyed shall be no cube number. For if the number multiplied should be a cube number, the number produced should also be a cube number (by the 4. of this booke): which is contrary to the supposition, and impossible.

And that C the fourth number is a cube number, and so are all forwarde leauyng two betwene. And that F the seuenth number is both a cube number and also a square number, and so are all forward leauing fiue betwene. For for that as vnitie is to A, so is A to B. Therefore how many times vnitie measureth A, so many times A measureth B. But vnitie measureth A by those vnities which are in A, wherefore A measureth B by those vnities which are in A. And forasmuch as A measureth B by those vnities which are in A. Therfore A multiplieng himselfe produceth B. Wherfore B is a square number. And forasmuch as these numbers B, C, D, are in continuall proportion, and B is a square number, therfore by the 22. of the eight, D also is a square number.

For if E be a prime number, &amp; do also measure D, it shall likewise measure A being a prime number and not being one and the same with A, by the former Proposition: which is impossible. Wherefore E is not a prime number. Wherefore it is a composed number. But euery composed number (by the 33. of the seuenth) is measured by some prime number.
               
               Now I say, that no other prime nūber besides A shall measure E. For if any other prime nūber do measure E, &amp; E measureth D, therfore that number also shall measure D (by the 5. common sentence of the seuenth). Wherfore it shal also measure A (by the proposition next going before) being a prime number and not being one and the same with A: which is impossible. Wherefore euery the prime number A measureth E which measureth the greatest number D.
               And forasmuch as E measureth D, let it measure it by F. Now I say, that F is none of these numbers A, B, C. For if F be one and

F is not a prime number. For if F be a prime number, and it measureth D, therefore it also measureth A being a prime number, and not being one and the same with A, by the former Proposition: which is impossible. Wherefore F is not a prime number: wherefore it is a composed number, and therefore some prime number shall measure it. Now I say, that no other prime number besides A shall measure it. For if any other prime number do measure F, and F measureth D, therefore that number shall measure D (by the 5. common sentence of the seuenth). Wherefore it shall also measure A (by the former Proposition) being a prime number and not being one and the same with A: which is impossible. Wherefore onely the prime number A measureth F. And forasmuch as E measureth D by F, therefore E multiplying F produceth D, But A also multiplying C produceth D, therefore that which is produced

if A into C, is equall to that which is produced of E into F. Wherfore proportionally as A is to E, so is F to C. But A measureth E. Wherefore F measureth C. Let F measure C by G. And in like sort may we proue, that G is not one and the same with any of these numbers A, B, C, and that G is a composed number, and also that onely the prime number A measureth it. And forasmuch as F measureth C by G, therefore G multiplying F produced C. But A also multiplying B produced C. Wherefore that which is produced of A into B, is equall to that which is produced of F into G. Wherefore proportionally as A is to F, so is G to B. But A measureth F. Wherefore G also measureth B. Let G measure B by H. Now in like sort as before may we proue, that H is not one and the same with A, and that H is a composed number, and measured onely of the prime number A. And forasmuch as G measureth B by th

                  se vnities which are in H, therfore G multiplying H produced B. But A multiplying him selfe produced B. Wherfore that which is produced of H into G, is equall to the square number which is produced of A. Wherefore as H is to A, so is A to G. But A measureth G. Wherfore H measureth A being a prime number and not being one and the same with it: which is absurde. Wherfore no other number besides these numbers A, B, C, measureth the greatest number D: which was required to be demonstrated.

                  A proposition added by Campane.
                  
                     If there be numbers how many soeuer in continuall proportion being the least in that proportion: a number measuring one of them, shall be a number not prime to one of the two least numbers in that proportion.

                      and let the two least numbers in that proportion be F and G. And let some number as H measure some one of the numbers A, B, C, D, E, namely, C. Then I say that H is a number not prime either to F or G. Take (by the 2. of the eight) the

                  SVppose that there be three numbers in continuall proportion A, B, C, being the left of all numbers that haue one and the same proportion with them. Then I say, that euery two of these numbers A, B, C, added together,

                  Now it is manifest (by the sayd 35. Proposition) that DE multiplying him selfe produced A,

                  And forasmuch as DE and EF are the least in that proportion, they are also prime the one to the other (by the 24. of the seuenth). But

                      two numbers be prime the one to the other, then both of thē added together, shall be prime to either of them (by the 30. of the seuenth). Wherefore the whole number DF is prime to either of these nūbers DE &amp; EF. But DE also is prime vnto EF. Wherfore DF, &amp; DE are prime vnto EF. Wherfore that which is produced of DF into DE, is (by the 26. of the seuēth) prime vnto EF. But if two nūbers be prime the one to the other, that which is produced of the one of thē into himselfe, is prime to the other (by the 27. of the seuēth). Wherfore that which is produced of DF into DE, is prime to that which is produced of EF into himsel

                     e together with that which is produced of DE into EF (by the 3. of the second). Wherfore the square nūber which is produced of DE together with that which is produced of DE into EF, is prime to that which is produced of EF into himself. But that which is produced of DE into him selfe, is the number A, &amp; that which is produced of DE into EF, is the number B: and that which is produced of EF into himselfe, is the number C. Wherefore the numbers A, B, added together are prime vnto C.
               
               
                  
                  By the like demonstration also may we

proue, that the numbers B, C, are prime vnto the number A.
               
               
                  Now also I say, that the numbers A, C, are prime vnto the number B.
               
               
                  For forasmuch as DF is prime to either of

these DE and EF: therefore that which is produced of DF into him self, is prime to that which is produced of DE into EF. But that which is produced of DF into him selfe, is equall to the square numbers which are produced of DE and EF together with that number which is produced of DE into EF, twise (by the 4. of the second). Wherefore the square nū
                     bers which are produced of DE and EF together with that which is produced of DE into EF twise are prime to that which is produced of DE into EF. And by diuision also (by the 30. of the seuenth) the square numbers produced of DE and EF, together with that which is produced of DE into EF once are prime to that which is produced of DE into EF. Againe (by the same 30. of the seuenth) the square nūbers produced of DE and EF, are prime to that which is produced of DE into EF. But that which is produced of DE into him selfe is A, and that which is produced of EF into him selfe is C, and that which is produced of DE into EF, is B. Wherefore the numbers A, C, added together are prime vnto the number B: which was required to be demonstrated.
               
               This latter part of the demonstration, which proueth that the numbers A, &amp; C are prime vnto B, is somewhat obscurely put of Theon. And therefore I will here make it playner.
               Forasmuch as either of the numbers DE, and EF is prime to the whole DF:
                     Demonstration to proue that the numbers A and C are prime to B.
                   (as hath before b
                     •
                  ne proued) therefore that which is produced of DE into EF (which is the number B) is prime vnto DF, by the 26. of the seuenth. Wherefore by the 27. of the same that which is produced of DF into himselfe (which is the number composed of A and C and of the double of B by the 4. of the second) shall be prime vnto B. Wherefore it followeth that the number composed of A and C is prime vnto B. For if a number composed of two numbers, be prime to one of the said two numbers, as here the number composed of A and C taken as one number and of the double of B, is prime vnto the double of B: then the two numbers whereof the number is composed, namely, the number composed of A and C, and the double of B shall be prime the one to the other (by the 30 of the seuenth). And therefore the number composed of A and C shall be prime to B taken once. For if any number should measure the two numbers, namely the number composed of A and C, and the number B, it should also measure the number composed of A and C, and the double of B (by the 5. common sentence of the seuenth): which is not possible, for that they are proued to be prime numbers.
               Here haue I added an other demonstration of the former Proposition after Campane, which proueth that in nūbers how many soeuer, which is there proued onely touching three numbers: and the demonstration seement somwhat more perspicous then Theons demonstration. And thus he putteth the proposition.
               
                  If numbers how many soeuer being in continuall proportion be the least that haue one &amp; the same proportion with them: euery one of them shalbe to the number composed of the rest prime.

                   D, is prime to the number composed of the rest, namely, of A, B, C. For if it be not, let some number, namely E measure D, and the number composed of A, B, C. Take the two least numbers in the same proportion that A, B, C, D are (by the 35. of the seuenth) which let

be F, G. And forasmuch as E measureth one of these number A, B, C, D, the same E shalbe a number not prime either to F or to G (by the proposition before added by Campane after the 14. proposition) wherfore some number shall measure E and one of these number

F or G, the same H shall measure all the meanes betwen

                   A and D by the same cōmon sentēce. For e

                  er of these numbers F or G produceth all the meanes by the next numbers in continuall proportion and in the same proportion with them (as by L, I, K) by the second of the eight. Agayne forasmuch as H measureth E, which (by supposition) measureth the whole A, B, C: the same H shall also measure the whole, A, B, C (by the foresayd common sentence) and it measureth the part taken away, namely, the meanes B, C (as it hath bene proued) wherefore it also measureth the residue A (by the 4. common sentence o

                   the seuenth) wherefore H measureth the extreames D and A, which are prime the one to the other (by the 3. of the eight) which were absurd. Wherefore D is a number prime to the number composed of the rest, namely, of A, B, C.
               Secondly I say that this is so in euery one of them: namely that C is a prime number to the number composed of A, B, D. For if not, then as before let E measure C, and the number composed of A, B, D: which E shalbe a number not prime either to F or to G (by the former proposition added by Campane) wherefore let H measure them. And forasmuch as H measureth E, it shall also measure the whole A, B, C, D whom E measureth. And forasmuch as H measureth one of these numbers F or G, it shall measure one of the extreames A or D: which are produced of F or G (by the second of the eight) if they be multipl

And moreouer the same H shall measure the meames, BC (by the 5. common sentence of the seuenth) when as by supposition it measureth either F or G. which measure B, C (by the second of the eight). But the same H measureth the whole A, B, C, D as we haue proued, for that it measureth E. Wherefore it shall also measure the residue, namely, the number composed of the extreames A and D (by the 4. common sentence of the seuenth). And it measureth one of these A or D (for it measureth one of these F or G which produce A and D) wherefore the same H shall measure one of these A or D and also the other of them (by the former common sentence) which numbers A and D are by the 3. of the eight prime the one to the other. Which were absurd. This may also be proued in euery one of these numbers A, B, C, D. Wherefore no number shall measure one of these numbers A, B, C, D and the numbers composed of the rest. Wherefore they are prime the one to the other: If therefore numbers how many soeuer. &amp;c: which was required to be proued.
               Here as I promised, I haue added Campanes demonstrations of those Propositions in numbers, which Eucl

                     de in the second booke demonstrated in lines. And that in thys place so much the rather, for that Theon as we see in the demonstration of the 15. Proposition seemeth to alledge the 3. &amp; 4. Proposition of the second boke: which although they concerne lines onely, yet as we there declared and proued, are they true also in numbers.
               
                  ¶ The first Proposition added by Campane.
                  
                  
                     That number which is produced of the multiplication of one number into numbers how many soeuer: is equall to that number which is produced of the multiplication of the same number into the number composed of them.
                  
                  This proueth that in numbers which the first of the second proued touching lines. Suppo

                      that the number A being multiplyed into the number B, and into the number C,

                      and into the number D, doo produce the numbers E, F and G. Then I say that the number produced of A multiplyed into the number composed of B, C, and D is equall to the number composed of E, F, and G. For by the conuerse of the definition of a number multiplyed, what part vnitie is of A, the selfe same part is B of E, and C of F, and also D of G. Wherefore

by the 5. of the seuenth what part vnitie is of A, the selfe same part is the number composed of B, C, and D, of the number composed of E, F, and G. Wherfore by the definition that which is produced of A into the number composed of B, C, D, is equall to the number composed of E, F, G: which was required to be proued.
               
               
                  The second Proposition.
                  
                     That number which is produced of the multiplication of numbers how many soeuer into one nū
                        ber: is equall to that number which is produced of the multiplication of the number composed of them into the same number.
                  
                  
                     This is the conuerse of the former As if the

                        This proposition is the cō
                           uerse of the former.
                     
                     
Then the number composed of B, C, D. multiplyed into the number A shall produce the number composed of the numbers E, F, G. Which thing is easly proued by the 16. of the seuenth and by the former proposition.
               
               
                  ¶ The third Proposition.
                  
                     That number which is produced of the multiplication of numbers how many soeuer into other numbers how many soeuer, is equall to that number which is produced of the multiplication of the number composed of those first numbers, into the number composed of these latter numbers.
                  
                  As if the numbers A, B, C doo multiply the numbers D, E, F, ech one eche other, and if the numbers produced be added together. Then I say that the

number composed of the numbers produced is equall to the number produced of the number composed of the numbers A, B,
                        Demonstration.
                      C into the number composed of the numbers D, E, F. For by the former propositiō that which is produced of the number composed of A, B, C into D is equall to that which is produced of euery one of the sayd numbers into D: and by the same reason that which is produced of the number composed of A, B, C into E, is equal to that which is produced of euery one of the sayd numbers into E: and so likewise that which is produced of the number composed of A, B, C into F is equall to that which is produced of euery one of the sayd numbers into F. But by the first of these propositions th

                      which is produced of the number composed of these numbers A, B, C into euery one of these numbers D, E, F is equall to that which is produced of the number composed into the number composed: wherefore that is manifest which was required to be proued.
               
               
                  ¶The fourth Proposition.

                        This answereth to the 2. of the second.
                      Then I

say, that that which is produced of A into himselfe, is equall to that which is produced of A into all the sayd numbers B, C, and D. For putting the number 
                        •
                      equall to the number A, it is manifest by the first of these propositions that that which is produced of E into A,
                        Demonstration.
                      is equall to that which is produced of E into all the partes of A
                        •
                      But by the common sentence that which is produced of E into A is equal to that which is produced of A into himselfe

                      and that which is produced of E into the partes of A is equall to that which is produced of A into the selfe same partes. Wherefore that is manifest which was required to be proued.
               
               
                  ¶The fift Proposition.
                  
                     If a number be deuided into two partes that which is produced of the whole in

                  This proueth in numbers that which in the 3. of the second was proued in lines.
                        This answereth to the 3. of the thirds.
                      For let the number A be deuided into the numbers B and C. Then I say that that which is

produced of A into C, is equall to that which is produced of C into himselfe and into B. For by the 16. of the seuenth, that which is produced of A into C is equall to that which is produced of C into A. Now then put the number D equall to the number C.
                        Demonstration.
                      Wherefore that which is produced of A into C is equall to that which is produced of D into A. But by the first of these propositions that which is produced of D into A is equall to that which is produced of D into B and of D into C. Wherfore forasmu

                     If a number be deuided into two partes: that which is produced of the multiplication of the whole

that which is produced of A into himself is equal to that which is produced of B into himselfe,

For by the 4 of these propositions, that which is produced of A into himselfe, is equall to that which is produced of A into B, and into C. But that which is produced of A into B, is equall to that which is produced of B into himselfe and into C (by the former proposition). And by the same that which is produced of A into C is equall to that which is produced of C into himselfe and into B.
                        Demonstration.
                      And forasmuch as that which is produced of C into B is equall to that which is produced of B into C by the 16. of the seuenth, it is manifest that that is true which was required to be proued.
               
               
                  ¶The seuenth Proposition.
                  
                     If a number be deuided into two equall partes, &amp; into two vnequall partes: that which is produced of the greater of the vnequall partes into the lesse, together with the square nūber of the number set betwene, is equall to the square number produced of the halfe of the whole.
                  
                  This proueth in numbers that which the 5. of the second proued in lines. As if the number AB be deuided into two equall numbers, which let be AC, and CB: and also in two vnequal numbers namely,

                      AD and DB, of which let AD be the greater, and

DB the lesse. Then I say that that which is produced of the whole AD into DB together with the square number of CD, is equall to the square number of CB. For by the former propositiō the square of CB is equall to the square of CD and to the square of DB, and to that which is produced of BD into CD twise. But that which is produced of BD into himselfe and into CD is equall to that which is produced of BD into CB by the first of these propositions,
                        Demonstration.
                      and therefore vnto that which is produced of BD into AC. Wherefore that which is produced of BD into himselfe and into CD twise is equall so that which is produced of BD into AD. Wherefore by the same the square of CB exceedeth that which is produced of BD into AD by the square of CD: wherfore that is manifest which was required to be proued.

                  This proueth in numbers that which the 6. of the second proued touching lines. For suppose that the number AB be deuided into equall numbers, which let be AC and CB: and vnto it

                      Then I say, that that which is produced of the whole AD into DA together with the square of BC, is equall to the square of CD. For by the 6. of these

propositiōs the square of CD is equal to the square of DB, &amp; to the square of BC, and to that which is produced of DB into BC twise. But by the

                      that which is produced of BD into himselfe and into BC twise is equall to that which is produced of BD into DA (for AC and CB are equall) wherefore the square of CD exceedeth that which is produced of BD into DA by the square of CB. Wherefore that is manifest which was required to be proued.

                     If a number be deuided into two partes: that which is produced of the whole number into him selfe together with that which is produced of one of the partes into him self, is equall to that which is produced of the whole into the sayd part twise together with that which is produced of the other part into him selfe.
                  
                  
                     This proueth in numbers that which the 7. of the second proued in lines. For let the number A be deuided into the numbers B and D.
                     
                        This answereth to the 7. of the second.
                      Then I say that the square of A together with the square of D is equall to that which is produced of A into D twise together with the

square of B. For it is manifest by the 6. of these propositions that the square of A is equall to the squares of B and D together with that which is produced of B into D twise. Wherefore the square of A together with the square of D, is equall to two squares of D

                      and to that which is produced of D into B twise together with the square of B. But by the first of these propositions two squares of D, and that which is produced of D into B twise is equall to that which is produced of D into A twise. Wherfore that which is produced of D into A twise together with the square of B, is equall to the square of A together with the square of D: wherfore that is manifest which was required to be proued.

                     If a number be deuided into two partes, and vnto it be added a number equall to one of the parts: the square of the whole number composed, is equall to the quadruple of that which is produced of the first number into the number added, together with the square of the other part.
                  
                  This proueth in numbers, that which the 8. of the second proued in lines. Suppose that the number AB be deuided into the numbers AC and CB, vnto which

adde the number BD, which let be equall to the number CB.
                     
                        This answereth to the 8. of the second.
                      Then I say that the square of the whole number composed, namely, AD, is equall to that which is produced of AB into BD fower times together with the square of AC. For by the 6. of these propositions the square of AD, is equall to the square AB and to the square of BD together with that which is produced of AB into BD twise.
                        Demonstratition.
                      And forasmuch as the square of BD is equal to the square CB: therfore the square of AD shall be equall to the square of AB and to the square of CB together with that which is produced of AB into BD twise. But by the former proposition the square of AB together with the square of CB, is equall to the square of AC together with that which is produced of AB into BC twise wherfore the square of AD is equal to that which is produced of AB into BD twise, and to that which is produced of AB into BC twise together with the square of AC. And for that that which is produced of AB into BC is equall to that which is produced of AB into BD, therefore is that manifest which was required to be proued.

                     If a number be deuided into two equall partes, and into two vnequall partes: the squares of the two vnequall partes taken together, are double to the square of the halfe, and to the square of the excesse of the greater part aboue the lesse, the sayd two squares being added together.
                  
                  This proueth in numbers that which the 9. of the second proued in lines. For suppose that the number AB be deuided into two equall partes: which let be AC and CB, and into two vnequall parts, which let be AD and DB.

                      Then I say that the squares of the two numbers AD &amp; DB, taken together, are double to the two squares of the two numbers AC and CD, taken together. For by the 6. of these propositions the square of AD is equall to the squares of

                     AC and CD, and to that which is produced of AC into CD twise. And forasmuch as the square of AC is equal to the square of CB, the square of AD shal be equall to the square of BC &amp; to the square of CD together with that which is produced of BC into CD twise.
                        Demonstration.
                      Wherefore the square of AD together with the square of BD, is equall to the square of BC, and to the square of CD and to that which is produced of BC into CD twise together with the square of BD. But that which is produced of BC into CD twise together with the square of BD, is equall to the square of BC and to the square of CD by the 9. of these propositions. Wherfore the squares of the two numbers AD and DB are equall to the squares of the two numbers BC and CD, taken twise. And therefore the squares of the two numbers AD and DB are double to the squares of the two numbers BC and CD, that is AC and CD (for the numb

                     If a number be deuided into two equall partes, and vnto it be added an other number: the square of the whole number composed together with the square of the number added, is double to the square of the halfe, together with the square of the number composed of the halfe and the number added.
                  
                  
                     This proueth in numbers that which the 10. of the second proued in lines. Suppose that the number AB be deuided into two equall numbers AC and CB:
                        This answereth to the 10. o

                      and vnto it adde the number BD. Then I say that the square of AD together with the square of BD, is

double to the square of AC together with the square of CD. For forasmuch as the number CD is deuided into two partes, and vnto it is added the number AC which is equall to one of the partes (namely, to CB) therefore by the 10. of thes

                      the square of AD is equall to that which is produced of CD into CA foure times together with the square of BD. And forasmuch as AC is equall to CB, therefore the square of AD, is equall to t

                      let the number AB be so deuided in C. And as AB is to BC, so let BC be to CA. Wherefore AC shall be lesse then CB. Now then take away from CB a number equall to AC which let be CD. And forasmuch as the proportion of the whole AB to the whole BC, is as the proportion of the part taken away from AB, namely, BC to the part taken away from BC, namely, CD: therefore the proportion of the residue of AB, namely, AC, to the residue of BC, namely, to BD, is as the proportion of the whole AB to the whole BC (by the 11. of the seuenth). Wherefore BC is to CD, as CD is to DB. Wherfore CD is greater then DB. Wherefore sub

Wherfore the residue of CB, namely, DB, shal be to the residue of CD, namely, to CE, as the proportion of the whole BC to the whole CD. Wherfore CE may be subtrahed out of ED: wherfore there shalbe no end of this subraction: which is impossible.

For if it be possible, as A is to B, so let B be to C. Now A and B are prime numbers, yea they are prime and the lest by the 23. of the seuenth. But (by the 21. of the seuenth) the least measure the numbers that haue one and the same proportion with them equally, the

antecedent the antecedent, and the consequent the consequent. Wherefore the antecedent A, measureth the antecedent B, and it measureth also it selfe. Wherfore A measureth these numbers A &amp; B being prime the one to the other, which is impossible. Wherfore as A is to B, so is not B to C: which was required to be proued.

               SVppose that there be these numbers in continuall proportion A, B, C, D, and let their extremes A and D be prime the one to the other. Then I say that D is not to any other number as A is to B. For if it be possible, as A is to B, so let D be to E. Wherfore alternately by the 13. of the seuenth, as A is to D, so is B to E. But A and D are prime,Demonstration leading to an abjurditie. yea they are prime and

the least. But the least numbers (by the 21. of the seuenth) measure the numbers that haue one and the same proportiō with them equally, the antecedent the antecedent, and the consequent. Wherefore the antecedent A measureth the antecedent B: but as A is to B, so is B to C. Wherfore B also measureth C. Wherfore A also measureth C (by the 5. commō sentence of the seuenth) and forasmuch as B is to C, so is C to D, but B measureth C. Wher

Now A, B are either prime the one to the other or not prime.Three cases in this proposition. If they be prime, then (by the 16. of the ninth) it is maninifest that it is impossible to finde out a third number proportional with them. But now suppose that AB be not prime the one to the other. And let B multiplieng himselfe produce C. Now A either measureth C, or measureth it not. First,The first case. let it measure it and that by D. Wherfore A multiplieng D produceth

C.The second case. But B also multiplieng himself produced C. Wherfore that which is produced of A into D, is equall to that which is produced of B into himselfe. Wherefore (by the second part of the 19. of the seuēth) as A is to B, so is B to D. Wherfore vnto these numbers A, B is found out a third number in proportion, namely, D.

Wherfore that which is produced of A into D, is equall to that which is produced of B into himselfe, but that which is produced of B into himselfe is C. Wherfore that which is produced of A into D is equall vnto C. Wherfore A multiplieng D produced C. Wherefore A measureth G by D. But it is supposed also not to measure it, which is impossible. Wherefore it is not possible to finde out a third number in proportion with A &amp; B, whensoeuer A measureth not C: which was required to be proued.

                  ourth number proportionall with them. Now A, B, C, are either in continuall proportion, and their extremes A, C are prime the one to the other or they are not in continuall proportion, and their extremes are yet prime the one to the other: or they are in continuall proportion, and their extremes are not prime the one to the other: or they are neither in continuall proportion, nor their extremes are prime the one to the other.
               
                  The first case.If A, B, C, be in continuall proportion, and their extremes be prime the one to the other, it is manifest (by the 17. of the ninth) that it is impossible to finde out a fourth number proportionall with them.
               But now suppose that A, B, C, be not in continuall

proportion,The second case. and yet let their extremes be prime the one to the other. Then I say that so also it is impossible to finde out a fourth number proportional with thē. For if it be possible, let there be found such a number, and let the same be D. So that as A is to B, so let C be to D, and as B is to C, so let D bet

the one to the other, yea they are prime, and the least: but the lest measure the numbers that haue one &amp; the same proportion with them equally, the antecedent, the antecedent, and the consequent the consequent (by the 21. of the seuenth). Wherfore A measureth C, namely, the antecedent the antecedent, and it also measureth it selfe. Wherfore A measureth these numbers A and C being prime the one to the other, which is impossible. Wherfore it is not possible to finde out a fourth number proportionall with these numbers A, B, C.

                  ible to finde out a fourth number proportionall with them. For let B multiplieng C produce D. Now A either measureth D, or measureth it not. First let it measure it, and that by E. Wherfore A multiplieng E produced D. But B also multiplieng C produced D. Wherfore that which is produced of AE is equal to that which is produced of BC: wherfore in what proportiō A is to B, in ye same is C to E. Wherfore there is found out a fourth number, namely, E, proportionall with these nūbers A, B, C.
               
                  But now suppose that A do not measure D. Then I say that it is not possible to finde out a fourth number proportionall with these numbers A, B, C. For if it be possible, let there be found such a number, and let the same be E. Wherfore that which is produced of A into E is equall to that which is produced of B into C. But that which is produced of B into C is D. Wherfore that which is produced of A into E is equall vnto D. Wherefore A multiplieng E produced D, wherfore A measureth D, but it also measureth it not, which is impossible. Wherfore it is impossible to finde out a fourth number proportionall, with these numbers A, B, C, whensoeuer A measureth not D.
               But now suppose

that A, B,The fourth case. C be neither in continuall proportiō, neither also their extremes be prime the one to the other. And let B multiplieng C produce D. And in like sorte may we proue that if A do measure D, it is possible to finde out a fourth number proportionall with them. But if it do not measure D, thē is it vnpossible: which was required to be proued.

Then I say, that G is none of these numbers A, B, C. For if G be one and the same with any of these A, B, C. But A, B, C, measure the nūber DE: wherfore G also measureth DE: and it also measureth the whole EF. Wherefore G being a number shall measure the residue DF being vnitie

                  A proposition added by Campane.
                  
                  
                     
                        A proposition added by Campa

                           e.
                     
                     If an odde number measure an euen number, it shall measure it by an euen number.
                  
                  For if it should measure it by an odde number, then of an odde number multiplyed into an odde number should be produced an odde number, which by the former proposition is impossible.
               
               
                  An other proposition added by him.
                  
                     
                        An other added by him.
                     
                     If an odde number measure an odde number, it shall measure it by an odde number.
                  
                  For if it should measure it by an euen number, then of an odde number multiplyed into an euen number should be produced an odde number which by the 28. of this booke is impossible.
               
            
            
               ¶ The 30. Theoreme. The 30. Proposition. If an odde number measure an euen number, it shall also measure the halfe thereof.
               SVppose that A being an odde number doo measure B being an euen number. Th
                     ••
                   I say that it shall measure the halfe thereof. For forasmuch as A measureth B let i
                     •
                   measure it by C.Demonstration leading to an absurditie. Thē I say that C is an euen number. For if not then, if it be possible le

                     •
                   be odde. And forasmuch as A measureth B by C: therfore

A multiplying C produceth B. Wherfore B is composed of odde numbers whose multitude also is odde. Wherfore B is an odde number (by the 29. of this booke) which is absurd
                     •
                   for it is supposed to be euen: wherefore C is an euen num
                     •
                  er. Wherefore A measureth B by an euen number: and C measureth B by A. But either

of these numbers C and B hath an halfe part wherfore as C is to B, so is the halfe to the halfe. But C measureth B by A. Wherefore the halfe of C measureth the halfe of B by A: wherfore A multiplying the halfe of C produceth the halfe of B. Wherfore A measureth the halfe of B: and it measureth it by the halfe of C. Wherefore A measureth the halfe of the number B: which was required to be demonstrated.
            
            
               ¶ The 31. Theoreme. The 31. Proposition. If an odde number be prime to any number, it shal also be prime to the double thereof.
               SVppose that A being an odde number be prime vnto the number B: and let the double of B be C.Demonstration. Then I say, that A is prime vnto C. For if A and C be not prime the one to the other, some one number measureth them both. Let there be such a number which measureth them both, and let the same be D.

But A is an odde number. Wherefore D also is an odde number. (For if D which measureth A should be an euen number, then should A also be an euen number (by the 21. of this booke): which is cōtrary to the supposition. For A is supposed to be an odde nūber: &amp; therefore D also is an odde number). And forasmuch as D being an odde number measureth C, but C is an euē number (for that it hath an halfe, namely, B). Wherfore (by the Proposition next going before) D measureth the halfe of C. But the halfe of C is B. Wherefore D measureth B: and it also measureth A. Wherefore D measureth A and B being prime the one to the other: which is absurde. Wherefore no number measureth the numbers A &amp; C. VVherfore A is a prime number vnto C. VVherefore these numbers A and C are prime the one to the other: which was required to be proued.
            
            
               ¶ The 32. Theoreme. The 32. Proposition. Euery nūber produced by the doubling of two vpward, is euenly euen onely.
               SVppose that A be the number two: and from A vpward double numbers how many soeuer; as B, C, D. Then I say, that B, C, D, are numbers euenly euen onely. That euery one of them is euenly euen, it is manifest:Demonstration. for euery one of them is produced by the doubling of two. I say also, that euery one of them is euenly

euen onely. Take vnitie E. And forasmuch as from vnitie are certaine numbers in continuall proportion, &amp; A which followeth next after vnitie is a prime number, therefore (by the 13. of the third) no number measureth D being the greatest number of these numbers A, B, C, D, besides the selfe same numbers in proportion. But euery one of these numbers A, B, C, is euenly euen. VVherefore D is euenly euen onely. In like sort may we proue, that euery one of these numbers A, B, C, is euenly euen onely: which was required to be proued.
            
            
               ¶The 33. Theoreme. The 33. Proposition. A number whose halfe part is odde, is euenly odde onely.
               
                  SVppose that A be a number whose halfe part is odde. Then I say that A is euenly od onely. That it is euenly odde it is manifest: for his halfe being odde measureth him by an euē number, namely, by 2.
                  Demonstration leading to an absurditie. (by the definition).

I say also that it is euenly odde onely. For if A be euenly euen, his halfe also is euen. For (by the definition) an euen number measureth him by an euen number. Wherefore that euen number which measureth him by an euen number shall also measure the halfe thereof being an odde number by the 4. common sentence of the seuenth which is absurd. Wherfore A is a number euenly odde onely: which was required to be proued.
               
                  An other demonstration to proue the same.
                  Suppose that the number A haue to his halfe an od nūber, namely, B. Thē I say that A is euēly od onely. That it is euenly odde needeth no profe: forasmuch as the number 2. an euen number measureth it by the halfe thereof which is an odde number.
                        An other demonstration.
                      Let C be the number 2. by which B measureth A

(for that A is supposed to be double vnto B). And let an euen number, namely, D measure A (which is possible for that A is an euen number by the definition) by F. And forasmuch as that which is produced of C into B is equall to that which is produced of D into F, therefore by the 19. of the seuenth, as C is to D, so is B to F. But C the number two measureth D being an euen number: wherfore F also measureth B which is the halfe of A. Wherfore F is an odde number. For if F were an euen number then should it in the B whome it measureth an odde number also by the 21. of this booke, which is contrary to the supposition. And in like maner may we proue that all the euē nūbers which measure the number A
                        •
                      do measure it by odde numbers. Wherefore A is a number euenly odde onely: which was required to be proued.
               
            
            
               ¶ The 34. Theoreme. The 34. Proposition. If a number be neither doubled from two, nor hath to his half part an odde number, it shall be a number both euenly euen, and euenly odde.
               
                  SVppose that the nūber A be a nūber neither doubled frō the nūber two, neither also let it haue to his halfe part an odde nūber. Then I say that A is a nūber both euenly euen, and euenly odde.
                  
                     Demonstration.
                   
                  That A is euenly euen it is manifest, for the halfe therof is not odde, and is measured by the number 2. which is an euen number. Now I say that it is euenly odde also. For if we deuide A into two equall partes, and so continuing still, we shall at the length light vpon a certaine

odde number which shall measure A by an euen number. For if we should not light vpon such an odde nū
                     ber, which measureth A by an euen number, we should at the length come vnto the number two, and so should A be one of those numbers which are doubled from two vpward, which is contrary to the supposition. Wherfore A is euenly odde. And it is proued that it is euenly euē: wherfore A is a number both euenly euen and euenly odde: whiche was required to be demonstrated.
               
               This proposition and the two former manifestly declare that which we noted vppon the tenth definition of the seuenth booke namely, that Campane and Flussates and diuers other interpreters of Euclide (onely Theon except) did not rightly vnderstand the 8. and 9. definitions of the same booke concerning a number euenly euen, and a number euenly odde. For in the one definition they adde vnto Euclides wordes extant in

the Greeke this word onely (as we there noted) and in the other this word all. So that after their definitions a number can not be euenly euen vnlesse it be measured onely by euen numbers: likewise a number can not be euenly odde vnlesse all the euen numbers which doo measure it, doo measure it by an odde number. The contrary whereof in this proposition we manifestly see. For here Euclide proueth that one number may be both euenly euen and euenly odde. And in the two former propositions he proued that some numbers are euenly euen onely, and some euenly odde onely: which word onely had bene in vaine of him added, if no number euenly euen could be measured by an odde number, or if all the numbers that measure a number euenly odde must needes measure it by an odde number. Although Campane and Flussates to auoyde this absurdity haue wreasted the 32. proposition of this booke frō the true sence of the Greeke and as it is interpreted of Theon. So also hath Flussates wreasted the 33. proposition. For wheras Euclide sayth, Euery nūber produced by the doubling of two vpward, is euēly euē only: they say, onely the numbers produced by the doubling of two, are euenly euen. Likewise whereas Euclide saith, A number whose hafle part is odde, is euenly odde onely, Flussates sayth, onely a number whose halfe part is od, Is euēly od. Which their interpretatiō is not true, neither can be applyed to the propositions as they are extāt in the Greeke. In dede the sayd 32. and 33. propositions as they put thē are true touching those numbers which are euenly euen onely, or euēly od onely. For no number is euenly euen onely, but those onely which are doubled from two vpward. Likewise no numbers are euenly odde onely, but those onely whose halfe is an odde number. But this letteth not, but that a number may be euenly euen although it be not doubled from two vpward &amp; also that a number may be euēly odde although it haue not to his halfe an odde number. As in this 34. propositiō 
                  Euclide hath plainly proued. Which thing could by no meanes be true, if the foresayd 32. &amp; 33. propositons of this booke should haue that sence and meaning wherein they take it.
            
            
               ¶ The 35. Theoreme. The 35. Proposition. If there be numbers in continuall proportion how many soeuer, and if from the second and last be taken away numbers equall vnto the first, as the excesse of the second is to the first, so is the excesse of the last to all the nūbers going before the last.
               SVppose that these numbers A, BC, D, and EF, be in continuall proportion beginning at A the least. And from BC, which is the second, take away CG equall vnto the first, namely, to A, and likewise from EF the last take away FH equall also vnto the first, namely, to A. Then I say, that as the excesse BG is to A the first, so is HE the excesse, to all the numbers D, BC, and A, which go before the last number, namely, EF.Demonstration. Forasmuch as EF is the greater (for the second is supposed greater then the first) put the number FL equall to the number D, and likewise the number FK equall to the number BC. And forasmuch as FK is equall vnto CB, of which FH is equall vnto GC, therefore the residue HK is equall vnto the residue GB. And for that as the whole F
                     •
                  , is to the whole FL, so is the part taken away FL, to the part taken away FK, therefore the residue LE is to

the residue KL, as the whole 
                     •
                  E is to the whole FL (by the 11. of the seuenth). So likewise for that FL is to FK, as FK is to FH, KL shall be to HK, as the whole FL is to the whole FK (by the same Proposition). But as FE is to FL, and as FL is to FK, and FK to FH, so were FE to D, and D to BC, and BC 
                     〈◊〉
                   A. Wherefore as LE is to KL, and as KL is to HK, so is D to BC. Wherefore alternately (by the 23. of the seuenth) as LE is to D, so is KL to be BC, and as KL is to BC, so is HK to A. Wherefore also as one of the antecedentes is to one of the consequentes; so are

all the antecedentes to all the consequentes. Wherefore as KH is to A, so are HK, KL, and LE, to D, BC, and A (by the 12. of the seuenth). But it is proued, that KH is equall vnto BG. Wherefore as BG, which is the excesse of the second, is to A, so is EH the excesse of the last vnto the numbers going before D, BC, and A. Wherefore as the excesse of the second is vnto the first, so is the excesse of the last to all the numbers going before the last: which was required to be proued.
            
            
               ¶ The 36. Theoreme. The 36. Proposition. If from vnitie be taken numbers how many soeuer in double proportion continually, vntill the whole added together be a prime number, and if the whole multiplying the last produce any number, that which is produced is a perfecte number.
               
                  This proposition teach
                        •
                     th how to finde out a perfect number.SVppose that from vnitie be taken these numbers A, B, C, D, in double proportion continually, so that all those numbers A, B, C, D, &amp; vnitie added together, make a prime number: and let E be the number composed of all those numbers A, B, C, D, &amp; vnitie added together: and let E multiplying D, which is the last number, produce the number FG. Then I say, that FG is a perfect number.
               
                  
               
               
                  Construction.How many in multitude A, B, C, D, are, so many in continuall double proportion take beginning at E, which let be the numbers E, HK, L, and M. VVherefore of equalitie (by the 13. of the seuenth) as A is to D, so is E to M. VVherefore that which is produced of E into D, is equall to that which is produced of A into M. But that which is produced of E into D, is the number FG. VVherefore that which is produced of A into M, is equall vnto FG. VVherefore A multiplying M produceth FG. VVherefore M measureth FG by those vnities which are in A. But A is the number two. VVherefore FG is double to M. And the numbers M, L, HK, and E, are also in continuall double proportion. VVherefore all the numbers E, HK, L, M, and FG, are continually proportionall in double proportion. Take from the second number KH, and from the last FG a number equall vnto the first, namely, to E: and let those numbers taken be HN, &amp; FX.Demonstration. VVherefore (by the Proposition going before) as the excesse of the second number is to the first number, so is the excesse of the last to all the

numbers going before it. VVherefore as NK is to E, so is XG to these numbers M, L, KH, and E. But NK is equall vnto E (for it is the halfe of HK, which is supposed to be double to E). VVherefore XG is equall vnto these numbers M, L, HK, and E. But XF is equall vnto E, and E is equall vnto these numbers A, B, C, D, and vnto vnitie. Wherfore the whole number FG is equall vnto these numbers E, HK, L, M,Demonstration leading to an absurditie. and also vnto these numbers A, B, C, D, and vnto vnitie. Moreouer I say, that vnitie and all the numbers A, B, C, D, E, HK, L, and M, do measure the number FG. That vnitie measureth it, it needeth no proufe. And forasmuch as FG is produced of D into E, therefore D and E do measure it. And forasmuch as the double from vnitie, namely, the nūbers A, B, C, do measure the number D (by the 13. of this booke) therefore they shall also measure the number FG (whom D measureth) by the 
                     •
                  . common sentence. By the same reason forasmuch as the nūbers E, HK,

L, and M, are vnto FG, as vnitie and the numbers A, 
                     •
                  , C, are vnto D (namely, in subduple proportion) and vnitie and the numbers A, B, C, do 
                     〈◊〉
                   D, therefore also the numbers E, HK, L, and M, shall measure the number FG: No
                     •
                   I say also, that no other number measureth FG besides these numbers A, B, C, D, E, HK, L, M, and vnitie. For if it be possible, let O measure FG. And let O not be any of these numbers A, B, C, D, E, HK, L, and M. And how often O measureth FG, 
                     〈◊〉
                   vnities let there be in P. Wherefore O multiplying P produceth FG. But E also multiplying D produced FG. Wherefore (by the 19. of the seuenth) as E is to O, so is P to D. Wherefore alternately (by the 9. of the seuenth) as E is to P, so is O to D. And forasmuch as from vnitie are these numbers in continuall proportion A, B, C, D, and the number A which is next after vnitie is a prime number, therfore (by the 13. of the ninth) no other number measureth D besides the numbers A, B, C. And it is supposed that O is not one and the same with any of these nūbers A, B, C. Wherefore O measureth not D. But as O is to D, so is E to P. Wherefore neither doth E measure P. And E is a prime number. But (by the 31. of the seuenth) euery prime number, is to euery number that it measureth not, a prime number. Wherefore E and P are prime the one to the other: yea they are prime and the least. But (by the 21. of the seuenth) the least measure the numbers that haue one and the same proportion with them equally, the antecedent the antecedent, and the consequent the consequent. And as E is to P, so is O to D. Wherefore how many times E measureth O, so many times P measureth D. But no other number measureth D besides the numbers A, B, C (by the 13. of this booke). Wherefore P is one and the same with one of these numbers A, B, C. Suppose that P be one and the same with B, &amp; how many B, C, D, are

in multitude, so many take from E vpward, namely, E, HK, and L. But E, HK, and L, are in the same proportion that B, C, D, are. VVherefore of equalitie, as B is to D, so is E to L. VVherefore that which is produced of B into L, is equall to that which is produced of D into E. But that which is produced of D into E, is equall to that which is produced of P into O. VVherefore that which is produced of P into O, is equall to that which is produced of B into L. VVherefore as P is to B, so is L to O: and P is one &amp; the same with B: wherefore L also is one and the same with O: which is impossible. For O is supposed not to be one and the same with any of the numbers geuen. VVherefore no number measureth FG besides these numbers A, B, C, D, E, HK, L, M, and vnitie. And it is proued, that FG is equall vnto these numbers A, B, C, D, E, HK, L, M, and vnitie, which are the partes therof (by the 39. of the seuenth). But a perfect nūber (by the definition) is that which is equall vnto all his partes. VVherfore FG is a perfect number

            ¶The tenth booke of Euclides Elementes.
            IN THIS TENTH BOOKE doth Euclide entreat of lines and other magnitudes rationall &amp; irrationall,
                  The Argumēt of the tenth booke.
                but chiefly of irrationall magnitudes, commensurable and incommensurable: of which hitherto, in al his former 9. bokes he hath made no mention at all. And herein differeth number from magnitude,
                  Difference betwene number and magnitude.
                or Arithmetike from Geometry: for that although in Arithmetike, certayne numbers be called prime numbers in consideration of themselues, or in respect of an other, and so are called incommensurable, for that no one number measureth them, but onely vnitie. Yet in dede and to speake absolutely and truely, there are no two numbers incommensurable, but haue one common measure which measureth thē both, if none other, yet haue they vnitie, which is a common part and measure to all numbers, and all numbers are made of vnities, as of their partes.
                  A line is not made of points as number is made of vnities.
                As hath before bene shewed in the declaration of the definitiōs of the seuenth booke. But in magnitude it is farre otherwise, for although many lines, plaine figures, and bodies, are commensurable, and may haue one measure to measure them, yet all haue not so, nor can haue. For that a line is not made of pointes, as number is made of vnities, and therfore cannot a point be a common part of all lines, and measure them, as vnitie is a common part of all numbers and measureth them. Vnitie taken certayne tymes maketh any number. For there are not in any number infinite vnities: but a point taken certayne tymes, yea as often as ye list, neuer maketh any line, for that in euery line there are infinite pointes. Wherfore lines, figures, and bodies in Geometry, are oftentymes incommensurable and irrationall. Now which are rationall, and which irrationall, which commensurable, and which incommensurable, how many and how sundry sortes and kindes there are of them, what are their natures, passions, and properties, doth Euclide most manifestly shew in this booke, and demonstrate them most exactly.
            This tenth booke hath euer hitherto of all men, and is yet thought &amp; accompted, to be the hardest booke to vnderstand of all the bookes of Euclide.
                  This booke the hardest to vnderstand of all the bookes of Euclide.

There haue bene in deede in times past, and are presently in these our dayes, many which haue delt, and haue taken great and good diligence in commenting, amending, and restoryng of the sixe first bookes of Euclide, and there haue stayed themselues and gone no farther, beyng deterred and made afrayde (as it seemeth, by the opinion of the hardnes of this booke) to passe forth to the bookes following. Truth it is that this booke hath in it somewhat an other &amp; straūger maner of matter entreated of,

impossible to attayne to the right and full vnderstanding of this booke,
                  Many euen of the well learned haue thought that this booke can not well be vnderstanded without Algebra.

                           rst definition.
                     1 Magnitudes commensurable are suchwhich one and the selfe same measure doth measure.
                  First he sheweth what magnitudes are commensurable one to an other. To the better and more cleare vnderstanding of this definition, note that that measure whereby any magnitude is measured, is lesse then the magnitude which it measureth, or at least equall vnto it. For the greater can by no meanes measure the lesse. Farther it behoueth, that that measure if it be equall to that which is measured, taken once make the magnitude which is measured: if it be lesse, then oftentimes taken and repeted, it must precisely render and make the magnitude which it measureth. Which thing in numbers is easely sene, for that (as was before said) all numbers are commensurable one to an other. And although Euclide in this definition comprehendeth purposedly, onely magnitudes which are continuall quantities, as are lines, superficieces, and bodies, yet vndoubtedly the explication of this and such like places, is aptly to be sought of numbers as well rationall as irrationall. For that all quantities commensurable haue that proportion the one to the other, which number hath to numbers. In numbers therfore, 9 and 12 are commensurable, because there is one common measure which measureth them both, namely, the number 3. First it measureth 12, for it is lesse then 12. and being taken certaine times, namely, 4 times, it maketh exactly 12: 3 times 4 is 12, it also measureth 9, for it is lesse then 9. and also taken certaine times, namely, 3 times, it maketh precisely 9: 3 times 3 is 9. Likewise is it in magnitudes, if one magnitude measure two other magnitudes, those two magnitudes so measured, are said to be commensurable. As for example, if the line C being doubled,

do make the line B, and the same lyne C tripled, do make the line A, then are the two lines A and B, lines or magnitudes commensurable. For that one measure, namely, the line C measureth thē both. First, the line C is lesse thē the line A, and alsolesse thē the line B, also the line C taken or repeted certaine times, namely, 3 times, maketh precisely the line A, and the same line C taken also certain times, namely, two times, maketh precisely the line B. So that the line C is a common measure to them both, and doth measure them both. And therfore are the two lines A and B lines commensurable. And so imagine ye of magnitudes of other kyndes, as of superficiall figures, and also of bodies.
               
               
                  
                  2 Incommensurable magnitudes are such, which no one common measure doth measure.
                        The second definition.
                     
                  
                  This diffinition neadeth no explanation at all,
                        Contraryes made manifest by the comparing of the one to the other.
                     
                     
it is easely vnderstanded by the diffinition going before of lines commensurable. For contraries are made manifest by comparing of the one to the other: as if the line C, or any other line oftentimes iterated, doo not render precisely the line A, nor the line B, thē are the lines A and B incommensurable. Also if the line C, or any other line certayne times repeted, doo exactly render the line A, and doo not measure the line B: or if it measure the line B, and measureth not also the line A, the lines A and B, are yet lines incōmensurable: &amp; so of other magnitudes as of superficieces, and bodyes.
               
               
                  3 Right lines commensurable in power are such, whose squares one and the selfe same superficies, area, or plat doth measure.
                        The thirde definition.
                     
                  
                  To the declaration of this diffinition we must first call to minde what is vnderstanded &amp; ment by the power of a line: which as we haue before in the former bookes noted is nothing ells but the square thereof, or any other plaine figure equall to the square therof. And so great power &amp; habilitie 
                        •
                     s a line said to haue, as is the quantitie of the square, which it is able to describe, or a figure superficial equal to the square therof.
                        What the power of a line is.

                        •
                      also to be noted that of lines, some are commensurable in length, the one to the other, and some are commensurable the one to the other in power. Of lines commensurable in length the one to the other, was geuen an example in the declaration of the first diffinitiō, namely, the lines A and B, which were commensurable in length, one and the selfe measure, namely, the line C measured the length of either of them. Of the other kinde is geuen this diffinition here set: for the opening of which take this example. Let there be a certaine line, namely, the

line BC, and let the square of that line be the square BCDE. Suppose also an other line, namely, the line FH, &amp; let the square thereof be the square FHIK, and let a certayne superficies, namely, the superficies A, measure the square BCDE, taken 16. times: which is the number of the litle areas, squares, plats, or superficieces cōtained and described within the sayd squares ech of which is equall to the superficie: A. Agayne let the same superficies A measure the square FHIK 9. times taken, according to the number of the field
                        •
                     s or superficieces contayned and described in the same. Ye see thē that one and the selfe same superficies, namely, the superficies A, is a common measure to both these squares, and by certayne repeticions thereof, measureth them both. Wherefore the two lines BC and FH, which are the sides or lines producing these squares, and whose powers these squares are, are by this diffinition lines commensurable in power.
               
               
                  4 Lines incommensurable are such, whose squares no one plat or superficies doth measure.
                        The fourth definition.
                     
                  
                  
                     This diffinition is easy to be vnderstanded by that which was sayd in the diffinition last set before this, and neadeth no farther declaration. And thereof take this example. If neither the superficies A,

nor any other superficies doo measure the two squares BCDE, and FHIK: or if it measure the one, 
                        ••
                     rely BCDE, and not the other FHIK, or if it measure the square FHIK, and not the square BCDE: the two lines BC and FH, are in power incommensurable, and therfore also incommēsurable in length. For whatsoeuer lines are incommē
                     surable in power, the same are also incommensurable in length as shall afterward in the 9. proposition of this booke be proued. And therfore such lines are here defined to be absolutely incommensurable. These thinges thus standing it may easely appeare, that if a line be assigned and layd before vs, there may be innumerable other lines commensurable vnto it, and other incommensurable vnto it: of commensurable lines some are commensurable in length and power, and some in power onely.
               
               
                  5 And that right line so set forth is called a rationall line.

                     These principles, diffinitions and groundes of this tenth booke ought well to be paysed, they are somewhat more strange and more hard, then are the diffinitions and principles of the other bookes of Euclide going before, and therefore at the first sight or reading are not straight way conceiued, but ought often to be repeted,
                        The principles of this booke ought well to be pe

                      and by vse to be confirmed. For the propositions following, bring vnto them much light, and facilitie of vnderstanding. First there is a line supposed, and layd before vs, which may be any line whatsoeuer, of what length, or shortnes ye will: this line thus first supposed i
                        •
                      imagined to haue such diuisions and so many partes as ye list to conceiue in minde, as 3. 4. 5. and so forth, which may be applied to any kinde of measure, as it shall happen, as to inches, feete, pases, and such other. Vnto this line saith Euclide may be cōpared innumerable lines, of which some shalbe commensurable, and other some incommensurable: of commensurable lines, some are commensurable both in length and in power, other some are cōmensurable in power

onely. As if any part of the line proposed which let be the line AB, doo mesure also the line EF and againe if any one superficies do measure the square of the line AB, which let be the square ABCD: and also doo measure the square of the line EF, which let be the square EFGH: thē is the line EF to the supposed line &amp; first set, namely, to the line AB, a line commensurable both in length and power, as ye may see in the first example here set.
                  And if it so be that one &amp; the selfe same superficies do measure both the squares of these two lines AB and EF, namely the squares ABCD and EFGH: and no one line do measure the lines AB and EF: then is the line

EF (compared to the supposed 
                        ••
                     d

first line AB) commensurable in power onely. As in this example ye may easely perceiue. For the triangle or superficies ACD, twise taken, measureth the square ABCD, namely, the square of the line AB: and the selfe same triangle ACD taken foure times measureth the other square, namely, the square of the line EF. But no one measure or line can be assigned to measure both the lines AB and EF, because the sides of a square and the diameter are incommensurable in length the one to the other, as afterward shalbe shewed. Wherefore they are in length incommensurable, &amp; commensurable in power onely, that is by reason of their squares, which are commensurable the one to the other.
                  Agayne if it so be that no one line may

be found to be a cōmon measure, to measure both the first line, namely, AB, and also the line EF: nor yet any one superficies to measure the square or powers of these two lines, then is the line EF, to the first line set and supposed, incommensurable both in length and in power. As is supposed to be in this example.
                  Thus may ye see, how to the supposed line first set may be compared infinite lines,
                        Vnto the supposed line first set may be compared infinite lines.
                      some commensurable both in length &amp; power, and some commensurable in power onely, and incommensurable in length, and some incommensurable both in power &amp; in length. And this first line so set, whereunto, and to whose squares the other lines and their squares are compared, is called a rationall line, commonly of the most part of writers.
                        Why some mislike that the line first set should be called a rational line.
                      But some there are which mislike that it should be called a rationall line, &amp; that not without iust cause. In the Greeke copy it is called 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , rete, which signifieth a thing that may be spokē, &amp; expressed by word, a thing certayne, graunted and appoynted. Wherefore Flussates, a man which bestowed great trauell and diligence in restoring of these elementes of Euclide, leauing this word rationall, calleth this line supposed and first set, a line certaine, because the partes thereof into which it is deuided are certaine,
                        Flussates calleth this line, a line certaine.
                      and known, and may be expressed by voyce, and also be coumpted by number: other lines, being to this line incommensurable, whose parts are not distinctly known, but are vncertayne, nor can be expressed by name nor assignd by number, which are of other men called irrationall, he calleth vncertaine and surd lines. Petrus Montaureus although he doth not very wel like of the name, yet he altereth it not, but vseth it in al his booke. Likewise wil we doo here, for that the word hath bene and is so vniuersally receiued. And therefore will we vse the same name, and call it a rationall line. For it is not so great a matter what names we geue to thinges, so that we fully vnderstand the thinges which the names signifie.
                  This rationall line thus here defined, is the ground and foundation of all the propositions almost of this whole tenth booke.
                        This rational line the groūd in a maner of all the propositions in this tenth booke.
                      And chiefly from the tenth proposition forwardes. So that vnlesse ye first place this rationall line, and haue a speciall and continuall regard vnto it before ye begin any demonstration, ye shall not easely vnderstand it. For it is as it were the touch and triall of all other lines, by which it is known whether any of them be rationall or not.
                        Note.
                      And this may be called the first rationall line,
                        The line Rationall of purpose.
                      the line rationall of purpose or a rationall line set in the first place, and so made distinct and seuered from other rationall lines, of which shall be spoken afterwarde. And this must ye well commit to memory.

                     6 Lines which are commensurable to this line, whether in length and power, or in power onely, are also called rationall.
                  This definition needeth no declaration at all, but is easily perceiued, if the first definition be remembred, which 
                        •

For not all lines which are commensurable in power, are straight way commensurable also in length. Of this definition, take this example. Let the first line rationall of purpose,

which is supposed and laide forth, whose partes are certaine &amp; known, and may be expressed, named, and nūbred be AB, the quadrate wherof let be ABCD: then suppose againe an other lyne, namely, the line EF, which let be commensurable both in length and in power to the first rationall line, that is, (as before was taught) let one line measure the length of eche line, and also l

                  Moreouer if the lyne EF be commensurable in power onely to the rationall line AB first set and supposed, so that no one line do measure the two lines AB and EF: As in example y

                     ide of a square is incōmēsurable in lēgth to the diameter of the same square: if there be yet founde any one superficies, which measureth the two squares ABCD, and EFGH (as here doth the triangle ABD, or the triangle ACD noted in the square ABCD, or any of the foure triangles noted in the square EFGH, as appeareth somwhat more manifestly in the second example, in the declaration of the last definition going before) the line EF is also a rational line. Note that these lines which here are called rationall lines, are not rational lines of purpose, or by supposition, as was the first rationall line, but are rationall onely by reason of relation and comparison which they haue vnto it, because they are commensurable vnto it either in length and power, or in power onely. Farther here is to be noted, that these wordes length, and power, and power onely, are ioyned onely with these worde
                        •
                      commensurable or incommensurable, and are neuer ioyned with these woordes rationall or irrationall. So that no lines can be called rational in length, or in power, nor like wise can they be called irrationall in length, or in power. Wherin vndoubtedly Campanus was deceiued,

                     ither may they be placed amongst irrationall lines. Wherfore it remayneth that in this diffintion he speaketh onely of those lines which are incommensurable to the rationall line first geuen and supposed, both in length, and in power. Which by all meanes are incommensurable to the rationall line, &amp; therfore most aptly are they called irrationall lines. This diffinition is easy to be vnderstanded by that which hath bene sayd before. Yet for the more plainenes see this example. Let the 
                        ••
                     rst rationall line supposed, be the line AB, whose square or quadrate, let be ABCD. And

let there be geuen an other line EF which l
                        •
                     t be to the rationall line incommensurable in length and power, so that let no one line measure the length of the two lines, AB and EF: and let the square of the line EF be EFGH. Now if also there be no one superficies which measureth the two squares ABCD, and EFGH, as is supposed to be in this example, thē is the line EF an irrationall line, which word irrational (As before did this word rational) misliketh many learned in this knowledge of Geometry. Flussates,

                      as he left the word rationall, and in steade thereof vsed this word certaine, so here he leaueth the word irrationall, and vseth in place thereof this word vncertaine, and euer nameth these lines vncertaine lines. Petrus Montaureus also misliking the word irrationall, would rather haue them to be called surd lines, yet because this word irrationall hath euer by custome and long vse, so generally bene receiued

                      and with out proportion: not that these irrationall lines haue no proportion at all, either to the first rationall line, or betwene them selues: but are so named, for that theyr proportions to the rationall line cannot be expressed in number. That is vndoubtedly very vntrue, which many write, that their proportions are vnknowne both to vs and to nature. Is it not thinke you a thing very absurd to say that there is any thing in nature, and produced by nature, to be hidde from nature, and not to be knowne of nature? it can not be sayd that their proportions are vtterly hidde and vnknowne to vs (much lesse vnto nature) although we cannot geue them their names, and distinctly expresse them by numbers: otherwise should Euclide haue taken all this trauell and wonderfull diligence bestowed in this booke

power, or in power onely, should be rationall. Vndoubtedly this hath bene one of the chiefest and greatest causes of the wonderfull confusion and darkenes of this booke,

such which are incommensurable, it is generally to be taken: as was this word cōmensurable in the diffinitiō before.

square be ABCD. Suppose also an other square, namely the square E, which let be incōmēsurable to the rationall square, &amp; therefore is it irrationall: and let the side or line which produceth this square be the line FG: then shall the line FG by this diffinition be an irrationall line: because it is the side of an irrationall square. Let also the figure H being a figure on the one side longer (which may be any other rectiline figure rectangled or not rectangled, triangle, pentagone, trapezite, or what so euer ells) be incommensurable to the rationall square ABCD, then because the figure H is not a square, it hath no side or roote to produce it yet may there be a square made equall vnto it: for that all such figures may be reduced into triangles, and so into squares, by the 14. of the second. Suppose that the square Q be equall to the irrationall figure H. The side of which figure Q let be the line KL: then shall the line KL be also an irrational line, because the power or square thereof, is equal to the irrationall figure H: and thus conceiue of others the like.

               ¶ The 1. Theoreme. The 1. Proposition. Two vnequall magnitudes being geuen, if from the greater be taken away more then the halfe, and from the residue be againe taken away more then the halfe, and so be done still continually, there shall at length be left a certaine magnitude lesser then the lesse of the magnitudes first geuen.
               SVppose that there be two vnequall magnitudes AB, and C, of which let AB be the greater. Then I say, that if from AB, be taken away more then the halfe,Construction. and from the residue be taken againe more then the halfe, and so still continually, there shall at the length be left a certaine magnitude, lesser then the lesse magnitude geuē, namely, then C. For forasmuch as C is the lesse magnitude, therefore C may be so multiplyed, that at the length it will be greater then the magnitude AB (by the 5. definition of the fift booke).Demonstration. Let it be so multiplyed, and let the multiplex of C greater then AB, be DE. And deuide DE into the partes equall

vnto C, which let be DF, FG, and GE. And from the magnitudes AB take away more then the halfe, which let be BH: and againe from AH, take away more then the halfe, which let be HK. And so do continually vntill the diuisions which are in the magnitude AB, be equall in multitude vnto the diuisions which are in the magnitude DE. So that let the diuisions AK, KH, and HB, be equall in multitude vnto the diuisions DF, FG, and GE. And forasmuch as the magnitude DE is greater then the magnitude AB, and from DE is taken away lesse then the halfe, that is, EG (which detraction or taking away is vnderstand to be done by the former diuision of the magnitude DE into the partes equall vnto C: for as a magnitude is by multiplication increased, so is it by diuision diminished) and from AB is taken away more then the halfe, that is, BH: therefore the residue GD is greater then the residue HA (which thing is most true and most easie to conceaue, if we remēber this principle, that the residue of a greater magnitude, after the taking away of the halfe or lesse then the halfe, is euer greater then the residue of a lesse magnitude, after the taking away of more then the halfe). And forasmuch as the magnitude GD is greater then the magnitude HA, and from GD is taken away the halfe, that is, GF: and from AH is taken away more then the halfe, that is, HK: therefore the residue DF is greater then the residue AK (by the foresayd principle). But the magnitude DF is equall vnto the magnitude C (by supposition). Wherefore also the magnitude C is greater then the magnitude AK. Wherefore the magnitude AK is lesse then the magnitude C. Wherefore of the magnitude AB is left a magnitude AK lesse then the lesse magnitude geuen, namely, then C which was required to be proued. In like sort also may it be proued if the halfes be taken away.
               
                  A Corollary.
                  
                     
                        A Corollary.
                     Of this Proposition it followeth, that any magnitude being geuen how litle soeuer it be, there may be geuen a magnitude lesse then it: so that it is impossible that any magnitude

should be geuen then which can be geuen no losse.
                  
                     ¶An other demonstration of the same.
                     Suppose that the two vnequall magnitudes geuen be AB and C. And let C be the lesse. And forasmuch as C is the lesse, ther
                           •
                        fore C may so be multiplyed, that it shall at the length be greater then A

                        .Construction. Let it be so multiplyed, and let the multiplex of C exceding AB be the magnitude FM. And deuide FM into his partes equall vnto C, that is, into the magnitudes MH, HG, and GF. And from AB take away more then the halfe, which let be the magnitude BE: and likewise from EA take away againe more then the halfe, namely, the magnitude ED. And thus do continually vntill the diuisions which are in the magnitude FM, be equall in multitude to the diuisions which are in the magnitude AB: and let those diuisions be the magnitudes BE, ED, and DA. And how multiplex the magnitude FM is to the magnitude C, so multiplex let the magnitude KX be to the magnitude DA.Demonstration. And deuide the magnitude KX into the magnitudes equall to the magnitude DA: which let be KL, LN, and NX. Now then the diuisions which are in the magnitude KX, are equall vnto the diuisions

which are in the magnitude MF. And forasmuch as BE is greater then the halfe of AB, therefore BE is greater then the residue EA Wherefore BE is much more greater then DA. But DA is equall vnto XN. Wherefore BE is greater then XN. Againe forasmuch as DE is greater then the halfe of EA, therefore DE is greater then the residue DA: but DA is equall vnto LN: wherefore DE is greater then LN. Wherfore the whole magnitude DB is greater thē the whole magnitude XL. But DA is equall vnto LK. Wherefore the whole magnitude AB is greater then the whole magnitude KX. And the magnitude MF is greater then the magnitude BA: wherefore MF is much greater thē KX. And forasmuch as those magnitudes XN, NL, &amp; LK, are equall the one to the other, &amp; likewise these magnitudes MH, HG, and GF, are equal the one to the other, &amp; the multitude of those magnitudes which are in MF, is equall to the multitude of those magnitudes which are in KX: therfore as KL is to FG, so is LN to GH, and NX to HM. Wherefore (by the 12. of the fift) as one of the antecedentes, namely, KL, is to one of the consequences, namely, to FG, so are all the antecedentes, namely, the whole KX to all the consequentes, namely, to the whole FM. But FM is greater then KX. Wherefore FG is greater then LK. But FG is equall vnto C: and KL vnto DA (by supposition). Wherefore the magnitude C is greater then the magnitude AD: which was required to be proued.
                  
               
            
            
               ¶The 2. Theoreme. The 2. Proposition. Two vnequall magnitudes being geuen, if the lesse be continually taken from the greater, &amp; that which remayneth measureth at no time the magnitude going before: then are the magnitudes geuen incommensurable.
               
                  
                  This proposition teacheth that incontinuall quantitie which the first of the seuenth taught in discrete quantity.SVppose that there be two vnequall magnitudes AB, and

CD, and let AB be the lesse: and taking away continually by a certaine alternate detraction the lesse from the greater, let not the residue measure the magnitude going before. Then I say, that those two magnitudes AB and CD, are incommensurable. For if they be commensurable, then (by the first definition of the tenth) some one magnitude shall measure them both: Let there be such a magnitude, if it be possible, and let the same be E. And let AB measuring DF,Construction. leaue a lesse then it selfe, namely, CF (that is, from the greater magnitude CD, take away a certayne part as DF, which let be equall to AB, or if it be not equall vnto it, yet let it be such, that that lesse magnitude AB being more then once repeated may make the magnitude DF
                        •
                      For this is the meaning of this let AB measuring DF. &amp;c. And this detraction made, of the lesse I say out of the greater, let there be left of the greater a certaine portion CF, lesse then the magnitude AB. And this is the meaning of that which in the Theoreme was said, And that which remaineth measureth at no time the magnitude going before). Likewise let CF measuring BG leaue a lesse then it selfe, namely, AG: and do this continually as often as neede requireth, vntill there be found such a magnitude that is lesse then E: which must needes at the length happen (by the Proposition going before)
                     •
                   Let there be found such a magnitude lesse then E, which let be AG. And forasmuch as the magnitude E measureth the magnitude AB, but AB measureth DF: therefore E measureth the magnitude DF (by this common sentence, If a magnitude measure an other magnitude it shall also measure euery magnitude whom it measureth).Demonstration leading to an ab

                     urditie. And it measureth also the whole CD (for it is supposed to be a common measure to the magnitudes AB and CD). Wherefore also it measureth the residue CF (by this common sentence, If a magnitude measure an whole and a part taken away, it shall also measure the residue). And forasmuch as E measureth CF, but CF measureth BG, therefore E also measureth BG (by the first foresaid common sentence): and it measureth the whole AB. Wherefore it shall also measure the residue AG (by the other foresayd common sentence) namely, the greater magnitude shall measure the lesse: which is impossible. Wherefore no magnitude measureth these magnitudes AB and CD. Wherefore the magnitudes AB and CD are incommensurable. If therefore two vnequall magnitudes being geuen, the lesse be continually taken from the greater, and that which remayneth
                     •
                   measureth at no time the magnitude going before, then are the magnitudes geuen incommensurable: which was required to be demonstrated.
               
                  ¶A Corollary added by Montaureus.
                  By this proposition it is manifest, that if the two vnequall magnitudes geuen be not incommensurable, but commensurable, then the lesse being continually subtrahed out of the greater, the residue shall of necessitie measure that which went before.
               
            
            
               ¶ The 1. Probleme. The 3. Proposition. Two magnitudes commensurable being geuen, to finde out, their greatest common measure.
               SVppose that the two commensurable magnitudes geuen be AB &amp; CD, of which let AB be the lesse. It is required to finde out the greatest common measure of the magnitudes AB and CD.Two cases in this propositiō. Now AB either measureth CD, or not. If it measure it, and seing it also measureth it selfe,The first case. wherfore AB is a common measure vnto

the magnitudes AB and CD.This proposition teacheth, that in continual quantity, which the 2. of the s
                        ••

common measure to them. For no magnitude greater then AB can measure AB. But now suppose that AB do not measure CD. And taking continually the lesse from the greater that which remaineth shall at length measure that which goeth before (by the corollary before added), for that AB and CD are cōmensurable. Now then let AB measuring ED which is a part of the magnitude CD, leaue a magnitude lesse then it selfe, namely, EC.The second case. And let EC measuring the magnitude FB, which is a part of the magnitude AB, leaue a lesse thē it selfe, namely, FA, and let FA precisely measure the magnitude CE (And this is the meaning of this, That which remayneth shall at the length measure that which goeth before, when there is nothing left after the measuring made) And forasmuch as AF measureth the magnitude CE, but CE measureth FB: wherfore AF also measureth FB, &amp; it measureth it selfe: wherfore AF measureth also the whole AB.

Wherfore AF is a common measure vnto AB and CD. I say also that it is the greatest cōmon measure vnto them. For if not, then is there some magnitude greater thē the magnitude AF which measureth both the magnitudes AB and CD. Let there be such a one if it be possible, and let the same be the magnitude G.Demonstration leading to an absurditie. And forasmuch as G measureth AB, and AB measureth ED: therefore G also measureth ED, and by supposition, it measureth the whole CD, wherfore G measureth also the residue CE. But CE measureth FB, wherfore G also measureth FB. And by supposition it measureth the whole AB. Wherfore it measureth the residue AF, namely, the greater magnitude the lesse, which is impossible. Wherefore no magnitude greater then AF, measureth these magnitudes AB and CD. Wherefore AF is the greatest common measure vnto the magnitudes AB and CD. Wherfore vnto two commensurable magnitudes geuen, namely, AB and CD is found out their greatest common measure, namely, the magnitude AF

For forasmuch as A and B are cōmensurable, therfore some magnitude measureth them, let there be a magnitude that measureth them, and let the same be C.Construction. And how often C measureth A, so many vnities let there be in the number D. And how often C measureth B, so many vnities let there be in the number E, and let F be vnitie.Demonstration. And forasmuch as the magnitude C measureth the magnitude A by those vnities which are in the number D, and

vnitie F measureth the number D by those vnities which are in the number D: therefore how many times vnitie measureth the number D, so many times doth the magnitude C measure the magnitude A: wherfore as the magnitude C is to the magnitude A, so is vnitie F to the number D. Wherefore contrary wise (by the corollary of the fourth proposition of the fift booke) as the magnitude A is to the magnitude C, so is the number D to vnitie F. Againe forasmuch as the magnitude C measureth the magnitude B by those vnities which are in the number E, and vnitie F measureth the number E by those vnities which are in the number E: therfore how many times vnitie F measureth the number E, so many tymes doth the magnitude C measure the magnitude B.

And it is proued that as the magnitude A is to the magnitude C, so is the number D to vnitie G. Wherefore of equalitie (by the 22. of the fift) as the magnitude A is to the magnitude F, so is the number D to the number E. But as the number D is to the number E, so is the magnitude A to the magnitude B. Wherefore (by the 11. of the fift) as the magnitude A is to the magnitude B, so is the same magnitude A to the magnitude F: wherefore A hath vnto either of these magnitudes B and F one and the same proportion. Wherefore (by the 9. of the fift) the magnitude B is equall vnto the magnitude F. But the magnitude C measureth the magnitude F: wherefore it also measureth the magnitude B: and it likewise measureth the magnitude A. Wherefore the magnitude C measureth the magnitudes A and B.

E, and a right line, as A, it is possible to geue an other line, vnto which the line A shall haue the same proportion, that the number D hath to the number E. For deuide the line A into so many equall partes as there are vnities in the number D (by the 9. of the sixt). And take an other line, as F, which let be composed of so many partes equall to the partes of the line A, as there be vnities in the number E. Wherefore the line A shall be to the line F, as the number D is to the number E. And by this meanes you may vnto any line geuē geue an other line commensurable in length. For if two lines be in proportion the one to the other, as number is to number, they shall also be commensurable in length, by this 6. Theoreme.

line B so is the number E to the nūber F. But as the line A is to the line B, so is the square of the line A to the parallelograme contained vnder the lines A and B (by the first of the sixt) Wherfore as the square of the line A is to that which is contayned vnder the lines A

and B, so is the number E to the number F. Agayne for as muche as the number C multiplying the number D produced the number F, &amp; the number D multiplying himselfe produced the number G: therefore (by the 17. of the seuenth) as the number C is to the number D, that is, as the line A is to the line B, so is the number F to the number G. But as the line A is to the line B, so is parallellograme contained vnder the lines A and B to the square of the line B (by the first of the sixt). Wherefore as that which is contained vnder the lines A and B is to the square of the line B, so is the number F to the number G. But as the square of the line A is to that which is contayned vnder the lines A and B, so is the number E to the number F. Wherefore of equalitie (by the 22. of the fifte) as the square of the line A is to the square of the line B, so is the number E to the number G. But either of these numbers E and G is a square number. For E is produced of the number C multiplyed into him selfe, and G is produced of the number D multiplyed into him selfe. Wherefore the square of the line A hath vnto the square of the line B that proportion that a square number hath to a square number: which was required to be demonstrated.

the sixt). And the proportion of the square number which is produced of the number C to the square number produced of the number D is (by the 11. of the eight) double to that proportion which the number C hath vnto the number D.

                  First, this ye must note, that lines to be commensurable in length, and lines to be in proportion the one to the other, as number is to number is all one. So that whatsoeuer lines are commensurable in length, are also in proportion the one to the other, as number is to number. And conuersedly what so euer lynes are in proportion the one to the other, as number is to number, are also commēsurable in length, as it is manifest by the 5 and 6 of this booke. Likewise lines to be incommensurable in length, and not to be in proportion the one to the other, as number is to number is all one, as it is manifest by the 7. and 8. of this booke. Wherfore that which is sayd in this Theoreme, ought to be vnderstand of lines commensurable in length, and incommensurable in length.
                  This moreouer is to be noted, that it is not all one, numbers to be square numbers, and to be in proportiō the one to the other, as a square number is to a square number. For although square numbers be in proportion the one to the other, as a square number is to a square number, yet are not all those numbers which are in proportion the one to the other, as a square number is to a square number, square numbers. For they may be like superficiall numbers, and yet not square numbers, which yet are in proportiō the one to the other, as a square number is to a square number. Although all square numbers are like superficiall numbers. For betwene two square numbers there

But if betwene two numbers, there fall one meane proportionall number, those two numbers are like superficiall numbers (by the 20. of the eight). So also if two numbers be in proportion the one to the other, as a square number is to a square number, they shall be like superficiall nū

                  And now to know whether two superficiall numbers geuen, be like superficiall numbers or no,
                        Rules to know whether two superficiall numbers be like or no.
                      it is thus found out. First if betwene the two numb

                     rs geuen, there fall no meane proportionall, then are not these two numbers like superficiall numbers (by the 18. of the eight. But if there do fall betwene them a meane proportionall, then are they like super
                        •
                     iciall numbers (by the 20. of the eight) Moreouer two like superficiall numbers multiplied the one into the other, do produce a square number (by the firs
                        •
                      of the ninth). Wherfore if they do not produce a square number, then are they not like superficiall numbers. And if the one being multiplied into the other, they produce a square number, then are they like superficiall (by the 2. of the ninth). Moreouer if the said two superficial numbers be in superperticular, or superbipartient proportion, then are they not like superficiall numbers. For if they should be like, then should there be a meane proportionall betwene them (by the 20. of the eight). But that is contrary to the Corollary of the 20. of the eight.
                  And the easilier to conceiue the demonstrations following, take this example of that which we haue sayd.
                  Suppose that there be a line, namely, C, which imagine to be foure fote long: and let there be an other line D, which let be three foote long. And (by the 13. of the sixt) take the meane proportionall betwene the lines A, D, which let be the line B. Wherefore the square of the line B shall be equall to the rectangle parallelogramme contayned vnder the line C and D (by the 17. of the sixt). Which square shall contayne 12. foote, &amp; so much also shall the parallelogramme described of the lines C &amp; D containe. Take also two other lines E and F, of which let E be 3. foote long, and let F be a foote long. And let the meane proportionall betwene the lines E and F, be the line A. Now then the square of the line A shall containe 3. foote, as also doth the parallelogrāme described of the lines E, F. Thē I say, that the square of the line B, which cōtaineth 12. foote, is to the square of the line A, which contayneth 3. foote, in that proportion that a square number is to a square number. For as the number 12. is to the number 3, so is the square of the line B, which containeth 12. foote, to the square of the line A, which contayneth 3 foote. But the numbers 12. and 3. are like superficiall numbers, for the sides of 12. which are 2. and 6, are proportionall with the sides of 3. which are 1. and 3. Wherefore the square of the line B, which contayneth 12. foote, shall be vnto the square of the line A, which contayneth 3. foote, in that proportion that a like superficiall number is to a like superfici

to a square nūber,

which square numbers are 4. and 1. (by the 26. of the eight). Wherefore the square of the line B, which contayneth 12. foote, is to the square of the line A, which cōtaineth 3. foote, in that proportion that a square number is to a square number, namely, that the number 4. is to the number 1: which proportion is quadruple. For the greater square whiche is 12, contayneth the lesse square which is 3, foure times. Wherefore the side of the square 12, which is the line B, is double to the side of the square 3, which is the line A. Wherfore the line B is to the line A, in that proportion that number is to number. Whe

                     e (by the 5. of this booke) the lines B &amp; A are commensurable in length. Which is a supposition necessary to conclude the first part of this Theoreme, namely, that the squares of such lines are in proportion the one to the other, that a square number is to a square number.
                  So also the nūber which denominateth the greater terme of the proportion of the line B to the line A, which is 2, if it be multiplyed into it selfe, it maketh a square number, namely, 4. Likewise the number which denominateth the lesse terme, namely, 1. if it be multiplyed into it selfe, it maketh no more but 1. Which vnitie is also in power a square nūber. Wherfore the square of the line B, is to the square of the line A, in that proportion that a square number is to a square number, namely, that 4. is to 1. By this you see (which thing was before noted) that it is not all one, numbers to be square numbers, and to be in proportion the one to the other, as a square number is to a square number. For it is manifest, that the numbers 12. and 3. are not square numbers, when yet the squares expressed by those numbers are in that proportion. But the side of the square 12. although it can not of it selfe be expressed by number distinctly, to say that the side thereof is so many foote long, which feete square taken, make the whole square 12: yet b

                     ing referred or compared to an other thyng, namely, to the side of the square 3, which side also of it selfe can not be expressed by number, it is vnto the sayde side of the square 3, in double proportion. For the one square being quadruple to the other square (as is the square of the line B, which contayneth 12. foote, to the square of the line A, which contayneth 3. foote) hath his side double to the side of the other square, by this generall Corollary of the 10. of the sixt, like rectiline figures are in double proportion the one to the other that their sides of like proportion are. Now if a man will say, that the side of the square 12. may be measured, for that hys proportion which it hath to the side of the square 3, is measured by 2 (forasmuch as it is dupla proportion: this is to be considered, that in so saying, you say not, that that magnitude can of it selfe be measured, but the proportion therof. For, that magnitude, namely, the side of the square 12, should by it selfe be measured, when without any respect of the proportion of it to an other thing, we may say that the side of the square, which contayneth 12. foote, is so many foote long, the number of which foote multiplyed into it selfe should make that number 12. But this is not possible, for that 12. is not a square number. Wherefore thus you may say: In asmuch as that square 12. is considered by it self, without hauing any respect of the proportion of it to any other thing, but onely as it is 11. foote, it hath no side which of it selfe can be expressed by number. But if it be compared to any other thing, namely, to the square of 3. foote, then may you say that the side of the square 12. is 2, and the side of the square 3. is 1. But thys is the denomination of that propo

in fewer termes then two, when as it is a relation of one thing to an other thing: wherefore 2. is not the number of such feete, of which there are 12. in the square. Agayne, if the number 2. shoulde be the side of the square 12, so that that side should be 2, then of the multiplication of 2. into it selfe, shoulde not be made that square 12, but an other square which should be 4. foote: as of the number 2. multiplyed into him selfe is produced the square number 4. Neither also if any other number. measure the sid

                      of the square 12, and the sayd number be multiplyed into him selfe shall it euer make the number 12. When yet all numbers denominating the side of any square number, if they be multiplyed into them selues, they make the number which denominateth the square, whose sides they denominate. As 2. multiplyed into him selfe maketh 4 : 3. maketh 9 : 4. maketh 16: and so likewise of all others. Wherefore it is not all one, magnitudes to be in proportion the one to the other, as number is to number, and euery one of them to be measured b

As here the side of the square 12. can of it selfe by no meanes be measured, but being compared to any other magnitude, namely, to the side of the square 3, the proportion thereof is expressed by number. So also the side of the square 3, and of all other square figures, whose areas yet can not be expressed by square numbers. And that which we here say, is manifest euen by the wordes of Euclide in the 5.6. 7. and 8. Theoremes of this booke. Where he sayth not, that magnitudes commensurable and incommensurable are of thē selues or of their owne nature expressed by numbers,

Which thing not being well considered, it should seme hath caused many to erre as hereafter shall be made manifest. And in deede they which haue demonstrated this Theoreme, may seme to some rather to haue demōstrated it particularly &amp; not vniuersally. And doubtles I iudge there are some which vnderstand their sayinges otherwise then they ment: when as they thinke, that they suppose certayne lines not onely commensurable in length, as they are supposed to be in the Propositiō, but also such, that ech of

Wherfore for want of right vnderstāding, this mought they say of their demonstrations: that wheras they thought that they had concluded that generally, which is in this theoreme of Euclide, Squares described of lines cōmensurable in length, are in proportiō the one to the other that a square nū
                        ber is to a square number: they conclude particularly, thys onely: Squares described of lines which may by them selues be expressed by some certaine number, are in proportion. &amp;c. which yet is otherwise, and their demōstrations are right &amp; agreable with the Theoreme. Onely the picture of the figures which the Greeke boke hath, may seeme to bring some doubt. For the squares are so described with certayn litle areas, that the number of them may be denominated by a square number: whereby it mought seeme that the lines A &amp; B which describe the squares, ought to

be such that they may be expressed by some certaine nūber. As the line A to be 5. foote, and the line B 3. foote. As the two former figures here set declare. Which thyng yet Euclide supposeth not, but only requireth that they be commensurable in length, as in the former example of the two squares, the whole area of one of which is 12, and the whole area of the other is 3. For although their sides cā not by them selues be expressed by some certayne number, yet are they commensurable in length. Moreouer thys describing of the squares of the lines A and B, deuided by certaine litle areas, may cause this error, that a man should thinke that it is all o

                      Likewise the number of the areas of the square of the line B, is a square nūber, namely, 9, which is produced of the roote 3, which is the length of the line B. But we haue before declared that it is not all one, numbers to be called square numbers, a

Wherefore as touching those areas contayned in the greater square, which is of the line A, and which are in number 25, they do expresse that square number 25, which is produced of the number 5. multiplyed into him selfe, which number 5. is the greater extreme of the proportion betwene 5. and 3, which is the proportion of the lines A and B. And this proportion, namely, of 5. to 3. causeth that the lines A and B are commensurable in length (by the 6. of this booke). The same may be sayd also of the areas of the lesse square.

                  Forasmuch as in the eight booke in the 26. proposition it was proued, that like playne numbers haue that proportion the one to the other, that a square number hath to a square number: and likewise in the 24. of the same booke it was proued, that if two numbers haue that proportion the one to the other,This assumpt is the conuerse of the 26. of the eight. that a square number hath to a square number, those numbers are like plaine numbers. Hereby it is manifest, that vnlike plaine numbers, that is, whose sides are not proportionall, haue not that proportion the one to the other, that a square number hath to a square number. For if they haue, then should they be like plaine numbers, which is contrary to the supposition. Wherfore vnlike plaine numbers haue not that proportion the one to the other, that a square number hath to a square nūber. And therfore squares which haue that proportion the one to the other, that vnlike plaine numbers haue, shall haue their sides incommensurable in length (by the last part of the former proposition) for that those squares haue not that proportion the one to the other that a square number hath to a square number.

               SVppose that the right line first set and geuen, which is called a rationall line of purpose be A. It is required vnto the said line A, to finde out two right lines incommensurable, the one in length onely, the other both in length and in power.To finde out the first line incommensurable in length onely to the line geuen. Take (by that which was added after the 9. proposition of this booke) two numbers B and C, not hauing that proportion the one to the other, that a square number hath to a square number, that is, let them not be like plaine numbers (for like plaine numbers by the 26. of the eight haue that proportion the one to the other that a square number hath to a square number). And as the number B is to the number C, so let the square of the line A be vnto the square of an other line, namely, of D (how to do this was taught in the assumpt put before the 6. proposition of this booke.) Wherfore the square of the line A, is vnto the square of the line D commensurable (by the sixt of the tenth.)

And forasmuch as the number B hath not vnto the number C, that proportion that a square number hath to a square nūber, therfore the square of the line A hath not vnto the square of ye line D, that proportiō that a square number hath to a nūber. Wherfore by the 9. of the tenth, the line A is vnto the line D incommensurable in length onely. And so is found out the first line, namely, D incommensurable in length onely to the line geuen A.To finde out the second line incommensurable both in length and in power to the line geuen. Agayne take (by the 13. of the sixt) the meane proportionall betwene the lines A and D, and let the same be E. Wherfore as the line A is to the line D, so is the square of the line A to the square of the line E (by the Corollary of the 20. of the sixt). But the line A is vnto the line D incommensurable in length. Wherfore also the square of the line A is vnto the square of the line E incommensurable by the second part of the former proposition. Now forasmuch as the square of the line A is incōmē
                  surable to the square of the line E, it followeth (by the definition of incommensurable lynes) that the line A is incommensurable in power to the line E. Wherfore vnto the right line geuen, and first set, A, which is a rationall line, and which is supposed to haue such diuisions and so many partes as ye list to conceyue in minde, as in this example 11, whereunto, as was declared in the 5. definition of this booke, may be compared infinite other lines, either commensurable

or incommensurable, is found out the line D incommensurable in length onely. Wherfore the line D is rationall (by the sixt definitiō of this booke) for that it is incommensurable in length onely to the line A, which is the first line set, and is by suppositiō rational. There is also found out the line E, which is vnto the same line A incommensurable, not onely in length but also in power, which line E compared to the rationall line A, is by the definition irrationall. For Euclide alwayes calleth those lines irrationall, which are incommensurable both in length and in power to the line first set, and by supposition rationall.

                  orasmuch as the magnitude A is commensurable vnto the magnitude C, therefore (by the 5. of the tenth) A hath vnto C such

                  able vnto C, therefore (by the selfe same) C hath vnto B that proportion that number hath to number. Let C haue vnto B that proportion that the number F hath vnto the number G. Now then take the least numbers in continuall proportion and in these proportions geuen, namely, that the number D hath to the number E, and that the number F hath to the number G (by the 4. of the eight): which let be the numbers

So that as the number D is to the number E, so let the number H be to the number K, and as the nūber F is to the nūber G, so let the nūber K be to the nūber L. Now for that as A is to C, so is D to E, but as D is to E so is H to K, therfore as A is to C, so is H to K. Againe for that as C is to B, so is F to G, but as F is to G so is K to L: therefore as C is to B, so is K to L. But it is now proued that as A is to C, so is H to K. Wherefore of equalitie (by the 22. of the fift) as A is to B, so is the number H to the number L. Wherefore A hath vnto B such proportion as number hath to number.

                        A Corollary.
                     
                  
                  Suppose that the magnitudes A and B be incommensurable the one to the other, and let the magnitud

vnto B. Then I say that the magnitu

                     s C and D are incommensurable the one to the other. For A and C are commensurable, of which the magnitude A is incommensurable vnto B, wherefore by this 13. proposition the magnitudes C and B are also incommensurable: but the magnitude
                        •
                      B and D are cōmensurable wherefore by the same, or by the former assumpt, the magnitudes C and D are incommensurable the one to the other.

C, and draw a right line from D to B.Demonstration. Now it is manifest that the angle ADB is a right angle (by the 31. of the third): and that the line AB is in power more then the line AD, that is, then the line C, by the line DB, by the 47. of the first.
                  
                     A Corollary.
                     And like in sorte, two right lines being geuen, by this meanes may be founde out a right lyne which contayneth them both in power. Suppose that the two right lines geuen be AD and DB. It is required to

               ¶ The 11. Theoreme. The 14. Proposition. If there be sower right lines proportionall, and if the first be in power more then the second by the square of a right line commensurable in length vnto the first, the third also shalbe in power more then the fourth, by the square of a right line commensurable vnto the third. And if the first be in power more then the second by the square of a right line incommensurable in length vnto the first, the third also shall be in power more then the fourth by the square of a right line incommensurable in length to the third.
               SVppose that these foure right lines A, B, C, D, be proportionall. As A is to B, so let C be to D. And let A be in power more then B, by the square of the line E. And likewise let C be in power more then D, by the square of the line F.Demonstration. Then I say that if A be commensurable in length vnto the line E, C also shall be commensurable in length vnto the line F. And if A be incommensurable

in length to the line E, C also shall be incommensurable in length to the line F. For for that as A is to B, so is C to D, therefore as the square of the line A is to the square of the line B, so is the square of the line C to the square of the line D (by the 22. of the sixt). But by supposition vnto the square of the line A are equall, the squares o

                  , so is the line F to the line D (by the second parte of the 22. of the sixt) wherefore contrariwise (by the Corollary of the fourth of the fift) as B is to E so is D to F. But (by supposition)

                  nsurable in lēgth vnto F: and if it ba incommensurable in length vnto E, C also shalbe incommensurablel in length vnto F, by the 10. of this booke. If therfore there be foure right tlines proportionall, and if the first be in power more then the secondby the square of a right line commensurable in length vnto the first, the third also shall be in power more then the fourth, by the square of a right line commensurable in length vnto the third and if the first be in power more thē the second, by the square of a right line incōmensurable in length vnto the first, the third also shall be in power more the the fourth, by the square of a right line incommensurable in length to the third: which was required to be proued.
               
                  Note that the line A may be proued to be in proportion to the line E, as the line C is to the line F, by an other way, namely, by conuersion of proportion (of some

                  called inuerse proportion) by the 19. of the fift. For, forasmuch as the foure lines A, B, C, D, are proportionall: therfore (by the 22. of the sixt) their squares also are proportionall. And forasmuch as the antecedent, namely, the square of the line A excedeth the consequent, namely, the square of the line B, by the square of the line E: and the other antecedent, namely, the square of the line C, excedeth the other consequent, namely, the square of the line D, by the square of the line F, therefore as the square of the line A is to the excesse, namely, to the square of the line E, so is

And if the whole magnitude composed be commensurable to any one of the two partes, those two partes shall also be commensurable.
               LEt these two commensurable magnitudes AB and BC, be composed or added together. Then I say, that the whole magnitude AC is cōmensurable to either of these partes AB and BC: For forasmuch as AB and BC are commensurable, therfore (by the first definition of the tenth) some one magnitude measureth them both.Demonstration of the first part. Let there be a magnitude that measureth them, and

let the same be D. Now forasmuch as D measureth AB and BC, it shall also measure the whole magnitude composed AC, by this common sentence, what soeuer magnitude measureth two other magnitudes, shall also measure the magnitude composed of them. But the same D measureth AB and BC (by supposition). Wherefore D measureth AB, BC, and AC. Wherefore AC is commensurable to either of these magnitudes AB and BC.

                        A Corollary.
                     
                     If an whole magnitude be commensurable to one of the two magnitudes which make the whole magnitude, it shall also be commensurable to the other of the two magnitudes. For if the whole magnitude AC be commensurable vnto the magnitude BC, then by the 2. part of thys 15 Proposition: the magnitudes AB and BC are commensurable. Wherefore (by the first part of the same) the magnitude AC shall be commensurable to either of these magnitudes AB and BC. This Corollary Theon vseth in the demonstration of the 17. Proposition and also of other Propositions. Howbeit Euclide left it out, for that it seemed easie as in a maner do all other Corollaryes.
               
            
            
               ¶ The 13. Theoreme. The 16. Proposition. If two magnitudes incommensurable be composed, the whole magnitude also shall be incommensurable vnto either of the two partes cōponentes. And if the whole be incommensurable to one of the partes componentes, those first magnitudes also shall be incommensurable.
               
                  Demonstration of the first part by an argument leadindg to an absurditie.LEt these two incommensurable magnitudes AB &amp; BC, be composed, or added together. Then I say, that the whole magnitude AC, is incommensurable to either of these magnitudes AB and BC. For if AC and AB be not incommensurable, then some one magnitude measureth them (by the first definition of the tenth). Let there be such a magnitude, if it be possible, and let the same be D. Now forasmuch as D measureth CA and AB,

it also measureth the residue BC, &amp; it likewise measureth AB. Wherefore D measureth AB and BC. Wherfore (by the first definitiō of the tenth) the magnitudes AB and BC are commensurable. But it is supposed that they are incommensurable: which is impossible. Wherefore no magnitude doth measure the magnitudes AB and AC. Wherefore the magnitudes CA and AB are incommensurable. In like sort also may we proue, that the magnitudes AC and CB are incommensurable.

And this second part is the conuerse of the first.But now suppose that the magnitude AC be incommensurable to one of these magnitudes AB or BC, and first let it be incommensurable vnto AB. Then I say, that the magnitudes AB and BC are incommensurable. For if they be commensurable some one magnitude measureth them. Let some one magnitude measure them, &amp; let the same be D. Now forasmuch as D measureth AB and BC, it also measureth the whole magnitude AC. And it measureth AB: Wherefore D measureth these magnitudes CA and AB. Wherefore CA &amp; AB. are commensurable. And they are supposed to be incōmensurable
                     •
                   which is impossible. Wherfore no magnitude measureth AB and BC. Wherefore the magnitudes AB and BC are incommensurable. And in like sort may they be proued to be incommensurable, if the magnitude AC be supposed to be incommensurable vnto BC. If therefore there be two magnitudes incommensurable composed, the whole also shall be incommensurable vnto either of the two partes component, and if the whole be incommensurable to one of the partes component, those first magnitudes shall be incommensurable: which was required to be proued.

                     If vpon a right line be applied a parallelogramme wanting in figure by a square: the parallelogramme so applied, is equall to that parallelogramme which is contayned vnder the segmentes of the right line, which segmentes are made by reason of that application.
                  
                  Suppose that vpon a right line AB be applied a parallelogrāme AG, wanting in forme by the square GB. Then I say, that AG is equall vnto that which is contayned vnder AD and DB, which thing is of it self manifest. For

forasmuch as GB is a square, therefore the line DG is equall vnto the line DB: and the parallelogramme AG is that which is contayned vnder the lines AD and DG, that is, vnder the lines AD and DB. If therefore vpon a right line be applied a parallelogramme wanting in figure by a square: the parallelogrāme applied is equall to the parallelogrāme which is contayned vnder the segmentes of the right line, which are made by reason of that application. which was required to be demonstrated.

If there be two right lines vnequall, and if vpon the greater be applied a parallelogramme equall vnto the fourth part of the square of the lesse line, and wanting in figure by a square, if also the parallelogramme thus applied deuide the line where vpon it is applied into partes commensurable in length: then shall the greater line be in power more then the lesse, by the square of a line commensurable in length vnto the greater. And if the greater be in power more then the lesse by the square of a right line commensurable in length vnto the greater, and if also vpon the greater be applied a parallelogrāme equall vnto the fourth part of the square of the lesse line, and wanting in figure by a square: then shall it deuide the greater line into partes commensurable.
               SVppose that these two right lines A and BC, be vnequall: of which let BC be the greater. And vpon the line BC let there be applied (by the 28. of the sixt) a parallelogramme equall vnto the fourth part of the square of the line A being the lesse (that is, equall vnto the square described vpon halfe of

the line A) and wanting in figure by a square. And let the same parallelogramme be th

And forasmuch as the right line BC is deuided into two equall partes in the point E,Demonstratiō of the first part. and into two vnequall partes in the point D, therefore (by the 5. of the second) the rectangle figure comprehended vnder the lines BD and DC together with the square of the line ED, is equall to the square of the line EC. And in the same proportion are they eche being taken fower times by the 15. of the fifth. Wherfore that which is contained vnder the lines BD and DC taken fower times together with the square of the line ED taken also fower times, is equall to the square of the line EC taken fower times. But vnto that which is cōtained vnder the lines BD &amp; DC foure times is equal the square of the line A by supposition: for the parallelograme contained vnder the lines BD and DC once is supposed to be equall to the fourth part of the square of the line A. And vnto the square of the line DE taken fower times is equall the square of the line DF, for the line DF is double to the line DE. And vnto the square of the line EC fower times taken, is equall the square of the line BC,

                  or the line BC is also double to the line CE. Wherefore the squares o

                   the lines A and DF are equall vnto the square of the line BC. Wherefore the square of the line BC, is greater then the square of the line A, by the square of the line. DF. Wherefore the greater line BC is in power more then the lesse line A, by the square of the line DF. Now resteth to proue that the line BC is commensurable in length vnto the line DF. Forasmuch as by suposition the line BD is commensurable in length vnto DC, therefore (by the 15. of the tenth) the whole line BC is commensurable in length vnto the line DC: but the line DC equall to the line BF. Wherefore the whole line BC is commensurable in length vnto the lines BF &amp; CD. Let the two lines BF and CD be imagined to be so composed that they make one line. Now forasmuch as the whole line BC is commensurable in length to the two lines BF and CD taken as one line: therefore the lines BF and CD taken as one line are commensurable in length to the line FD (by the 2. part of the 15. of the tenth). Wherfore also the whole line BC is commensurable in length to the line FD by the first part of the same: this may also be proued by the corollary put after the 16. proposition of this booke. Wherefore the line BC is in power more then the line A by the square of a line commmensurable in length vnto the line BC.
               But now suppose that the line BC be in power more then the line A, by the square of a line commensurable in length vnto the line BC.Demonstration of the second part which is the conuerse of the first. And vpon the line BC let there be applied a rectangle parallelograme equall vnto the fourth part of the square of the line A, and wanting in figure by a square, and let the sayd parallelograme be that which is contained vnder the lines BD and DC. Then must we proue that the line BD is vnto the line DC commensurable in length. The same constructions and suppositions, that were before, remayning, we may in like sort proue that the line BC is in power more then the line A, by the square of the line FD. But by suppositiō the line BC is in power more thē the line A by the square of a line cōmensurable vnto it in length. Wherfore the line BC is vnto the line FD cōmensurable in length. Wherefore the line composed of the two lines BF and DC is cōmensurable in length vnto the line FD (by the second part of the 15. of the tenth). Wherefore (by the 12. of the tenth or by the first part of the 15. of the tenth) the line BC is commensurable in length to the line composed of BF and DC. But the whole line conposed BF and DC is commensurable in length vnto DC. For BF (as before hath bene proued) is equall to DC. Wherefore the

Wherefore the halfe of the line A which is equall vnto the line HD is the meane proportionall betwene the lines BD and DC. Wherefore that which is contained vnder the lines BD and DC is equall to the fourth part of the square of the line A. And so if vpon the line BD be described a rectangle parallelograme hauing his other side equall to the line DC, there shalbe applied vpon the line BC a rectangle parallelograme equall vnto the square of halfe of the line A, and wanting in figure by a square: which was required to be done.
               
            
            
               ¶The 15. Theoreme. The 18. Proposition. If there be two right lines vnequall, and if vpon the greater be applied a parallelograme equall vnto the fourth part of the square of lesse, and wanting in figure by a square, if also the parallelograme thus applied deuide the line whereupon it is applied into partes incommensurable in length: the greater line shalbe in power more then the lesse line by the square of a line incommensurable in length vnto the greater line. And if the greater line be in power more then the lesse line, by the square of a line incommē
                  surable in length vnto the greater, and if also vpon the greater be applied a parallelograme equall vnto the fourth part of the square of the lesse and wanting in figure by a square: then shall it deuide the greater line into partes incommensurable in length.
               
                  SVppose that these two right lines A and BC be vnequall the one to the other, of which let BC be the greater. And vpon the same BC apply a parallelograme equall vnto the fourth part of the square of the line A, and wanting in figure by a square: which how to doo was before taught in the end of the

former proposition. And let the sayd parallelograme be that which is contained vnder the lines BD and DC. And let BD be incommensurable in length vnto DC. Then I say that the line BC is in power more then the line A, by the square of a right line incommensurable in length vnto the line BC. First let the same order of construction, and demonstration be obserued in this which was in the former proposition. And we may in like sort proue that the line BC is in power more thē the line A by the square of the line DF. Now then must we proue that the lines BC and DF are incommensurable in length.Demonstratiō of the first part. Forasmuch as by supposition the line BD is incommensurable in lēgth vnto the line DC: therefore (by the 16. of the tenth) the line BC is incommensurable in length vnto the line CD. But DC is commensurable to these two lines BF and DC added together. For BF is equall vnto DC. Wherefore (by the 13. of the tenth) BC is incommensurable vnto these two lines BF and DC composed. Wherefore by the second part of the 16. of the tenth the line composed of the lines BF and DC taken as one line in incommensurable in length vnto the line FD. Wherefore by the first part of the same 16. proposition the line BC is incommensurable in length vnto the line FD. Wherefore the line BC is in power more then the line A by the square of a line incommensurable in length vnto the line BC.
               But now suppose that the line BC be in power more then the line A by the square of a line incommensurable in length vnto BC.Demonstr

                     e former. And vpon the line BC let there be applied a parallelogramme equall vnto the fourth part of the square of the line A, and wanting in figure by a square, and let the said parallelogramme be that which is contained vnder the lines BD &amp; DC. Then must we proue that the line BD is vnto the line DC incommensurable in lēgth. The same order of construction and demonstration being kept, we may in like sort proue that the line BC is in power more then the line A by the square of the line FD. But now (by supposition) the line BC is in power more then the line A by the square of a line incommensurable in length vnto BC. Wherefore the line BC is vnto the line FD incommensurable in length. Wherfore the line composed of BF and DC taken as one line, shall be incommensurable in length to the line FD (by the second part of the 16. of the tenth): wherefore also by the first part of the same, the line BC shall be incommensurable in length to the line composed of the lines BF and DC. But the line composed of the lines BF and DC is commensurable in length to the line DC (for that BF (as before hath bene proued) is equall to DC). Wherfore the line BC is incōmensurable in length to the line DC (by the 13. of the tenth). Wherefore by the second part of the 16. of the tenth, the line BD is incommēsurable in lēgth vnto the line DC. If therfore there be two right lines vnequall, and if vpon the greater be applied a parallelogramme equall vnto the fourth part of the square of the lesse line, &amp; wanting in

                  igure by a square, if also the parallelogramme thus applied deuide the line wherupon it is applied into partes incommensurable in length: the greater line shall be in power more then the lesse line by the square of a line incommensurable in length vnto the greater. And if the greater line be in power more then the lesse, by the square of a line incommensurable in length vnto the greater, and if also vpon the greater be applied a parallelogramme equall vnto the fourth part of the square of the lesse line, and wanting in figure by a square, then shall it deuide the greater line into partes incommensurable in length: which was required to be demonstrated.
               
                  This Proposition may also be demonstrated by the former proposition, namely, the first part of this

by the second part of the former, and the second part of this by the first part of the former, by an argument leading to an absurditie.

                  For as touching the first part of this proposition, the line BC contayning in power more then the line A by the square of the line FD, if the line BG be not incommensurable vnto the line FD, then is it commensurable vnto it. Wherfore (by the second part of the 17. proposition) the lines BD and DC also are commensurable, which is impossible, for they are supposed to be incommensurable. So likewise as touching the second parte of the same, the line BC contayning in power more then the line A by the square of the line FD, if the line DB be not incommensurable to the lyne DC, then is it commensurable vnto it: wherfore (by the first part of the

                  ¶An assumpt.
                  Forasmuch as it hath bene proued that lines commensurable in length,An Assumpt. are alwayes also commensurable in power, but lines commensurable in power are not alwayes commensurable in length, but may be in length both commensurable and also incommensurable: it is manifest, that if vnto the line propounded, which is called rationall of purpose, a certayne line be cōmensurable in length, it ought to be called rationall and cōmensurable vnto it, not only in length, but also in power: for lines commensurable in length are also alwayes commensurable in power. But if vnto the line propounded which is called rationall of purpose, a certayne line be commensurable in power, then if it be also commensurable vnto it in length, it is called rationall and commensurable vnto it both in length and in power. But againe if vnto the said line geuen which is called rationall, a certayne line be commensurable in power, and incommensurable in length, that also is called rationall, commensurable in power onely.
               
               
                  An annotacion of Proclus.
                  He calleth those lines rationall, which are vnto the rationall line first set cōmensurable in length &amp; in power, or in power only. And there are also other right lines, which are vnto the rationall line first set, incommensurable in length, and are vnto it commensurable in power only, and therfore they are called rationall, &amp; commēsurable the one to the other
                        •
                      for which cause they are rationall. But euen these lines may be commensurable the one to the other, either in length, and therefore in power, or els in power onely. Now if they be commensurable in length, then are those lines called rationall, commensurable in length, but yet so that they be vnderstand to be in power commensurable: but if they be commensurable the one to the other in power onely, they also are called rationall commensurable in power onely.
               
               
                  ¶A Corollary.
                  And that two lines or more being rationall and commensurable in length to the rational line first set, are also commensurable the one to the other in length, hereby it is manifest:
                        A Corollary added by Montaureu
                              •
                           .
                      for forasmuch as they are rationall and commensurable in length to the rationall line first set, but those magnitudes whiche are commensurable to one and the selfe same magnitude, are also commensurable the one to the other (by the 12. of the tenth) wherfore the rationall lines, commensurable in length to the rational lyne first set, are also commensurable in length the one to the

other. And as touching those which are rationall commensurable in power onely to the rationall line first set, they also must needes be at the least commensurable in power the one to the other. For forasmuch as their squares are rationall they shall bee commensurable to the square of the rationall line first set. Wherfore by the 12. of this booke, they are also commensurable the one to the other. Wherefore their lines are at the least commensurable in power the one to the other. And it is possible also that they may be commēsurable in lēgth the one to the other. For suppose that A be a rationall li
                        •
                     e first set, and let the line B be vnto the same rationall line A commensurable in power onely, that is, incommensurable in length vnto it. Let there be also an other line C commensurable

in length to the lyne B (which is possible by the principles of this booke.) Now by the 13. of the tenth, it is manifest that the line C is incommensurable in length vnto the line A. But the square of the line A is cōmēsurable to the square of the line B by supposition, and the square of the line C is also commensurable to the square of the line B by supposition. Wherefore by the 12. of this booke, the square of the line C is commensurable to the square of the line A. Wherfore by the definition, the line C shall be rationall commensurable in power onely to the line A, as also is the line B. Wherefore there are geuen two rationall lines commensurable in power onely to the rationall line first set, and commē
                     surable in length the one to the other.
                  Here is to be noted, which thing also we before noted in the definitions, that Campane and others which followed him, brought in these phrases of speaches, to call some lynes rationall in power onely,
                        Cause.
                      and other some rationall in length and in power, which we cannot finde that Euclide euer vsed. For these wordes in length and in power are neuer referred to rationalitie or irrationalitie, but alwayes to the commensurabilitie or incommensurablitie of lines. Which peruerting of wordes (as was there declared) hath much increased the difficulty and obscurenes of this booke.
                        Cause of increasing the difficulty of this booke.
                      And now I thinke it good agayne to put you in minde, that in these propositions which follow, we must euer haue before our eyes the rationall line first set,
                        Note.

                  And forasmuch as the line AB is commensurable in length vnto the line BC, and the line AB is equall vnto the lyne BD, therefore the lyne BD is commensurable in length vnto the line BC. And as the line BD is to the line BC, so is the square DA to the superficies AC (by the first of the sixt): but it is proued that the line BD is commensurable vnto the line BC, wherfore (by the 10. of the tenth) the square DA is commensurable vnto the rectangle superficies AC. But the square DA is rationall, wherfore the rectangle superficies AC also is rationall by the definition. A rectangle figure therfore comprehended vnder right lines commensurable in length, beyng rationall accordyng to one of the foresayd wayes is rationall: which was required to be proued.

                  Where as in the former demonstration the square was described vpon the lesse line, we may also demonstrate the Proposition, if we describe the square vpon the greater line, and that after thys maner. Suppose that the rectangle superficies BC be contayned of these vnequall lines AB and AC, which let be rationall commensurable the one to the other in length. And let the line AC be the greater.
                     The second case.
                   And

vpon the line AC describe the square DC. Then

I say, that the parallelogramme BC is rationall.

                   For the line AC is commensurable in length vnto the line AB by supposition, and the line DA is equall to the line AC. Wherefore the line DA is commensurable in length to the line AB. But what proportion the line DA hath to the line AB, the same hath the square DC to the para

But it is manifest, that the square DC is rationall, for that it is the square of a rationall line, namely, AC. Wherefore (by the definition) the parallelogrāme also CB is rationall.

Now then suppose first a rationall line AB. Let there be also a parallelogrāme CD contayned vnder the lines

CE and ED, which lines let be rationall, that is commensurable in length to the

                     The third case.
                   Describe the square of the line DE, which let be DF. First it is manifest (by the 12. of this booke) that the lines CE &amp; ED, are commensurable in lēgth the one to the other. For either of them is supposed to be commensurable in length vnto the line AB. But the line ED is equall to the line EF. Wherefore the line CE is commensurable in length to the line BF. But

                  refore (by the 10. of this booke) the parallelogramme CD shall be commensurable to the square DF. But the square DF is commensurable to the square of the line AB which is the first rationall line propounded. Wherfore (by the 12. of this booke) the parallelogramme CD is commensurable to the square of the line AB. But the square of the line AB is rationall (by the definition). Wherfore by the definition also of rationall figures, the parallelogramme CD shall be rationall.

                     The third kinde of rationall lines commensurable in length.
                   Now then let the selfe same construction remaine that was in the former: so that let the lines CE and ED be rationall commensurable in power onely vnto the line AB. But let them be commensurable in length the one to the other. Then I say, that in this case also the parallelogramme CD is rationall. First it may be proued as before, that the parallelogramme CD is commensurable to the square DF. Wherfore (by the 12. of this booke) the parallelogramme CD shall be commensurable to the square of the line AB

                   But the square of the line AB is rationall.
                     The fourth case.
                   Wherefore (by the definition) the parallelogrāme CD shall be also rationall. This case is well to be noted. For it serueth to the demonstration and vnderstanding of the 25. Proposition of this booke.

Wherefore (by the conuersion of the definition of rationall figures, or by the 12. of this booke) the square DA is commensurable vnto the parallelogramme AC. But as the square DA is to the parallelogramme AC, so is the line DB to the line BC (by the first of the sixt). Wherfore (by the 10. of the tenth) the line DB is commensurable vnto the line BC. But the line DB is equall vnto the line BA. Wherefore the line AB is cōmensurable vnto the line BC. But the line AB is rationall. Wherefore the line BC also is rationall and commensurable in length vnto the line BA. If therefore vpon a rationall line be applied a rationall rectangle parallelogramme, the other side that maketh the breadth therof shall be a rationall line commensurable in length vnto that line whereupon the rationall parallelogramme is applied: which was required to be demonstrated.

line AB is irrationall. For if the line AB be rationall, thē shall the square of the line AB be also rationall. For so was it put in the definitions. But (by supposition) it is not. Wherefore the line AB is irrationall. A line therefore contayning in power an irrationall superficies, is irrationall.

AC is irrationall. Wherefore also the line that contayneth the superficies AC in power, that is whose square is equall vnto the parallelogramme AC, is (by the Assumpt going before) irrationall. And it is called a mediall line, for that the square which is made of it, is equall to that which is contayned vnder the lines AB and BC, and therefore it is (by the second part of the 17. of the sixt) a meane proportionall line betwene the lines AB and BC. A rectangle figure therefore comprehended vnder rationall right lines which are commensurable in power onely, is irrationall. And the line which in power contayneth that rectangle figure is irrationall, and is called a mediall line.
               
               At this Proposition doth Euclide first entreate of the generation and production of irrationall lines. And here he searcheth out the first kinde of them, which he calleth a mediall line. And the definition therof is fully gathered and taken out of this 21. Proposition, which is this. A mediall line is an irrationall line whose square is equall to a rectangled figure contayned of two rationall lines commensurable in power onely.

                   is equall to a mediall superficies or parallelogramme. For as that line which produceth a rationall square, is called a rationall line, and that line which produceth an irrationall square, or a square equall to an irrationall figure generally is called an irrationall line: so i

                      For if the line AB be rationall, and if the line CB be irrationall, they shall be incommensurable. But as the line BD (which is equall to the line BA) is to the line BC, so is the square AD to the parallelogrāme AC. Wherefore the parallelogramme AC shall be incommensurable to the square AD which is rationall (for that the line AB wherupon it is described is supposed to be rationall). Wherefore the parallelogramme AC which is contayned vnder the rationall line AB, and the irrationall line BC, is irrationall.

Suppose that is containe in power the parallelograme GF: and by supposition it also containeth in power the parallelograme BD. Wherefore the parallelograme

BD is equall vnto the parallelograme GF: and it is also equiangle vnto it, for that they are ech rectāgle. But in parallelogrames equall and equiangle the sides which containe the equall angles, are reciprocall (by the 14. of the sixt): Wherfore what proportiō the line BC hath to the line EG, the same hath the line EF to the line CD. Therefore (by the 22. of the sixt) as the square of the line BC is to the square of the line EG, so is the square of the line EF to the square of the line CD. But the square of the line BC is commensurable vnto the square of the line EG (by supposition). For either of them is rationall.

                  mensurable in length vnto the line EG (for they are supposed to be commensurable in power onely). But as the line EF is to the line EG, so (by the assumpt going before) is the square of the line EF to the parallelograme which is contained vnder the lines EF and EG. Wherefore (by the 10. of the tenth) the square of the line EF is incommensurable vnto the parallelograme which is contained vnder the lines FE and EG. But vnto the square of the line EF the square of the line CD is commensurable, for it is proued that

                  . And that which is contained vnder the lines DC and CB is commensurable vnto that which is contained vnder the lines FE and EG. For they are both equall to the square of the line A. Wherefore (by the 13. of the tenth) the square of the line CD is incommensurable to that which is contained vnder the lines DC and CB. But as the square of the line CD is to that which is contained vnder the lines DC and CB, so (by the assumpt going before) is the line DC to the line CB. Wherefore the line DC is incommensurable in length vnto the line CB. Wherefore the line CD is rationall and incommensurable in length vnto the line CB. If therefore vpon a rationall line be applied the square of a mediall line, the other side that maketh the breadth thereof shalbe rationall, and incommensurable in length to the line whereupon the parallelogramme is applied: which was required to be proued.

For vniuersally it is true, that lines commensurable in length, are also commensurable in power.

Namely to expresse the mediall superficieces by the rootes of numbers which are not square numbers: and the lines cōtaining in power such medial superficieces, by the rootes of rootes of numbers not square.

For the rootes of those numbers and the rootes of rootes are in proportion as numbers are, namely, if the squares be proportionall the sides also shalbe proportionall (by the 22. of the sixt). But mediall lines incommensurable in power, are the rootes of rootes of numbers, which haue not that proportion, that square numbers haue. For their rootes are the powers of mediall lines, which are incommensurable (by the 9. of the tenth). But mediall lines commensurable in power onely, are the rootes of rootes of numbers, which haue that proportion that simple square numbers haue, and not which the squares of squares haue. For the rootes (which are the powers of the mediall lines) are commēsurable, but the rootes of rootes (which expresse the sayd mediall lines) are incommensurable.
                  Wherefore there may be found out infinite mediall lines incommensurable in pow

And vpon the line HM, apply a rectangle parallelogramme MK, equall to the parallelogramme AC, and making in breadth the line HK: (to do this ye must take a fourth line proportionall with the lines HM, AB &amp; BC (by the 12. of the sixt) which fourth line let be HK: wherefore (by the 26. of the sixt) that which is contayned vnder the extremes HM and HK, is equall to the parallelogramme contayned vnder the meanes AB and BC). And moreouer

vpon the line KN apply a rectangle parallelogramme NL equall to the squar

                   BE, and making in breadth the line KL. Wherfore the lines FH, HK &amp; K, are in one and the selfe same right line. (For those parallelogrammes so applied vpō the lines FG, HM, and KN, are rectangle, and the angles EHM and KHM are equall to two right angles, for they are right angles: wherefore the lines FH and HK are in one right line, by the 14. of the first: So also may be sayd of the angles HKN and LKN). And

forasmuch as either of these squares AD and BE is mediall, and the square AD is equall to the parallelogramme GH, and the square BE to the parallelogramme NL: wherefore either of these parallelogrammes GH and NL is mediall. And they are applyed vpon a rationall line, namely, FG. Wherefore (by the 22. of the tenth) either of these right lines F

                  H and KL is a rationall line, and in
                     •
                  ōmensurable in length vnto the line FG. And forasmuch as the square AD is commensurable to the square BE (for the lines AB and BC are supposed to be commensurable in power) therefore the parallelogramme GH is commensurable to the parallelogramme NL (for they are equall vnto the sayd squares). But as the parallelogramme GH is to the parallelogramme NL, so (by the first of the sixt) is the line FH to the line KL. Wherefore (by the 10. of the tenth) the line FH is commensurable in length to the line KL. Wherefore these right lines FH and KL, are rationall commensurable in length the one to the other (commensurable in length, I say, the one to the other, for vnto the line FG, by reason of which they are rationall, they are incōmensurable in length as it hath bene proued). Wherefore the parallelogramme contayned vnder the lines FH and KL, is rationall (by the 19. of the tenth).

                  And forasmuch as the line DB is equall to the line BA, and the line XB to the line BC: there
                        •
                     ore as the line DB is to the line BC, so is the line AB to the line BX. But as the line DB is to the line BC, so (by the first of the sixt) is the square DA to the parallelogrāme AC. And as the line AB is to the line BX, so is the parallelogramme AC to the square CX. Wherefore as the square DA is to the parallelogramme AC, so is the parallelogramme AC to the square CX. But the square AD is equall to the parallelogramme GH, and to the parallelogramme AC is the parallelogramme MK also equall, and to the parallelogramme NL is equall the square BE:
Wherefore as the parallelogramme GH is to the parallelogramme MK, so is the parallelogramme MK to the parallelogramme NL. Wherefore (by the first of the sixt) as

the line FH is to the line HK, so is the line HK to the line KL. Wherefore (by the 17. of the sixt) the parallelogrāme contayned vnder the lines FH and KL, is equall to the square of the line HK. But the parallelogrāme contayned vnder the lines FH and KL, is rationall, as hath before bene proued. Wherefore the square of the line HK is also rationall. Wherefore also the line HK is rationall.
               And now if the line HK be commensurable in length vnto the line HM, that is, vnto the line FG,Note. which is equall to the line HM, then (by the 19. of the tenth) the parallelogramme NH is rationall. But if it be incommensurable in length vnto the line FG, then the lines HK and HM are rationall commensurable in power onely. And so shall the parallelogrāme HN be mediall. Wherefore the parallelogramme HN is either rationall, or mediall. But the parallelogramme HN is equall to the parallelogramme AG. Wherefore the parallelogramme AC is either rationall, or mediall. A rectangle parallelogramme therefore comprehended vnder mediall right lines commensurable in power onely, is either rationall, or mediall: which was required to be demonstrated.
               
                  How to finde mediall lines commensurable in power onely contayning a rationall parallelogramme, and also other mediall lines commensurable in power contayning a

mediall parallelogramme, shall afterward be taught in the 27. and 28. Propositions of thys booke.
               
               
                  ¶A Corollary.
                  
                     Hereby it is manifest, that a rectangle parallelogramme contayned vnder two right lines, is the meane proportionall betwene the squares of the sayd lines.
                     
                        A Corollary.
                      As it was manifest (by the first of the sixt) that that which is contayned vnder the lines AB and BC, is the meane proportionall betwene the squares AD and CX. This Corollary is put after the 53. Proposition of this booke as an Assumpt, and there demonstrated, which there in his place you shall finde. But because it followeth of this Proposition so euidently and briefly without farther demonstration, I thought it not amisse here by the way to note it.
               
            
            
               ¶The 23. Theoreme. The 26. Proposition. A mediall superficies excedeth not a mediall superficies, by a rationall superficies.

And let there be put a rationall right line EF.Construction. And vpon the line EF apply a rectangle parallelogramme FH, equall vnto the mediall superficies AB, whose other side let be EH: and from the parallelogramme FH take away the parallelogramme FG, equall vnto the mediall superficies AC.Demonstration leading to an absurditie. Wherefore (by the third common sentence) the residue BD is equall to the residue KH. But (by supposition) the superficies DB is rationall. Wherfore the superficies KH is also rationall. And forasmuch as either of these superficieces AB and AC is mediall, and AB is equall vnto FH,

&amp; AC vnto FG: therefore either of these superficieces FH and FG is mediall: and they are applyed vpon the rationall line EF. Wherefore (by the 22. of the tenth) either of these lines HE and EG is rationall &amp; incommensurable in length vnto the line EF. And forasmuch as the superficies DB is rationall, and the superficies KH is equall vnto it: therefore KH is also rationall: and it is applied vpō the rationall line EF (for it is applied vpon the line GK, which is equall to the line EF). Wherefore (by the 20. of the tenth) the line GH is rationall and commensurable in length vnto the line GK. But the line GK is equall to the line EF. Wherfore the line GH is rationall and commensurable in length vnto the line EF. But the line EG is rationall and incommensurable in length to the line EF. Wherefore (by the 13. of the tenth) the line EG is incommensurable in length vnto the line GH. And as the line EG is to the line GH, so is the square of the line EG to the parallelogramme contayned vnder the lines EG and GH (by the Assumpt put before the 21. of the tenth). Wherefore (by the 10. of the tenth) the square of the line EG is incommensurable vnto the parallelogramme contayned vnder the lines EG and GH. But vnto the square of the line EG are commensurable the squares of the lines EG and GH, for either of them is rationall, as hath before bene proued. Wherefore the squares of the lines EG and GH are incommensurable vnto the parallelogramme contayned vnder the lines EG and GH. But vnto the parallelogramme contayned vnder the lines EG and GH, is commensurable that which is contayned vnder the lines FG and GH twise (for they are in proportion the one to the other as number is to number,

namely, as vnitie is to the number 2, or as 2. is to 4: and therefore (by the 6. of this booke) they are commensurable). Wherefore (by the 13. of the tenth) the squares of the lines EG and GH are incommensurable vnto that which is contayned vnder the lines EG and GH twise. (This is more brie
                     •
                  ly concluded by the corollary

of the 13. of the tenth). But the squares of the lines EG and GH together with that which is contayned vnder the lines EG and GH twise are equall to the square of the line EH (by the 4. of the second). Wherefore the square of the line EH is incōmensurable to the squares of the lines EG and GH (by the 16. of the tenth). But the squares of the lines FG &amp; GH are rationall. Wherfore the square of the line EH is irrationall. Wherefore the line also EH is irrationall. But it hath before bene proued to be rationall: which is impossible. Wherefore a mediall superficies exceedeth not a mediall superficies by a rationall superficies: which was required to be proued.

And C is a mediall line. Wherfore (by the 23. of the tenth) D also is a mediall line. Wherfore C and D are mediall lynes commensurable in power onely. Now also I say that they contayne a rationall parallelogramme.

                  An Assumpt.
                  To finde out two square numbers, which added together make a square number.
                  Let there be put two like superficiall numbers AB and BC (which how to finde out, hath bene taught after the 9. proposition of this booke) And let them both be either euen numbers or odde. And let the greater number be AB. And forasmuch as if from any euen number be taken away an euen number, or frō
                     
an odde number be taken away an odde number, the residue shall be euen (by the 24. and 26 of the ninth). If therfore from AB being an euen number be taken away BC an euen number, or from AB being an odde number be taken away BC being also odde: the residue AC shall be euen. Deuide the number AC into two equall partes in D: wherefore the number which is produced of AB into BC together with the square number of CD, is (by the sixt of the second, as Barlaam demonstrateth it in numbers) equall to the square number of BD.

But that which is produced of AB into BC is a square nūber. For it was proued (by the first of the ninth) that if two like plaine numbers multiplieng the one the other, produce any nū
                     ber, the number produced shal be a square number. Wherfore there are found out two square numbers, the one being the square number which is produced of AB into BC, and the other the square number produced of CD, which added together make a square number, namely, the square number produced of BD multiplied into himselfe, forasmuch as they were demō

                  ¶An Assumpt.
                  To finde out two square numbers which added together make not a square number.
                  
                     An Assumpt.Let AB and BC be like playne numbers, so that (by the first of the ninth) that which is produced of AB into BC is a square number, and let AC be an euen number. And deuide C

                     es in D. Now by that which hath before bene sayd in the former assumpt, it is manifest that the square number produced of AB into BC, together with the square number of CD, is equall to the square number of BD. Take away from CD vnitie DE. Wherfore that which is produced of AB into BC together with the square of CE is lesse then the square number of

BD. Now then I say that the square num
                        •
                     er produced of AB into BC added to the square number of CE, make not a square number. For if they do make a square number, then that square number which they make, is either greater thē the square number of BE, or equall vnto it, or lesse then it. First, greater it cannot be, for it is already proued that the square number produced of AB into BC, together with the square number of CE, is lesse then the square number of BD. But betwene the square number of BD, and the square number of BE, there is no meane square number. For the number BD excedeth the number BE onely by vnitie: which vnitie can by no meanes be deuided into numbers. Or if the number produced of AB into BC together with the square of the nūber CE, should be greater then the square of the number BE, then should the selfe same number produced of AB into BC together with the square of the number CE, be equall to the square of the number BD, the contrary wherof is already proued. Wherfore if it be possible, let that which is produced of AB into BC together with the square number of the number CE be equall to the square number of BE. And let GA be double to vnitie DE, that is, let it be the number two. Now forasmuch as the whole number AC is by supposition double to the whole number CD, of which the number AG is double to vnitie DE, therfore (by the 7. of the seuenth)

the residue, namely, the number GC is double to the residue, namely, to the number EC. Wherfore the number GC is deuided into two equall partes in E. Wherefore that which is produced of GB into BC together with the square number of CE is equall to the square nū
                     ber of BE. But that which is produced of AB into BC, together with the square number of CE, is supposed to be equal to the square number of BE wherfore that which is produced of GB into BC together with the square number of CE is equall to that which is produced of AB into BC, together with the square number of CE. Wherefore taking away the square number of CE, which is common to them both, the number AB shall be equall to the number GB, namely, the greater to the lesse, which is impossible. Wherfore that which is produced of AB into BC together with the square number of CE, is not equall to the square number of BE, I say also that that which is produced of AB into BC together with the square number of CE is not lesse then the square number of BE. For if it be possible, thē shall it be equ
                        •
                     l to some square number lesse then the square number of BE. Wherfore let the number produced of AB into BC together with the square of the number CE be equal to the square number of BF. And let the number HA be double to the number DF. Thē also it followeth that the number HC is double to the number CF, so that HC also is deuided into two equall partes in F, and therfore also the number which is produced of HD into BC, together with the square number of FC, is equall to the square number of the number BF. But by supposition, the number which is produced of AB into BC together with the square number of CE is equall to the square number of BF. Wherfore it followeth that the number produced of AB into BC together with the square number of CE, is equall to that which is produced of HB into BC together with the square number CF, which is impossible. For if it should be equall, then forasmuch as the square of CF is lesse then the square of CE, the number produced of HB into BC should be greater then th
                        •
                      number produced of AB into BC. And so also should the number HB be greater then the number AB, when yet it is lesse then it. Wherfore the number produced of AB into BC together with the square number of CE, is not lesse then the square nūber of 
                        •
                      E. And it is also proued that it cannot be equall to the square number of BE, neither greater then it. Wherfore that which is produced of AB into BC added to the square number of CE, maketh not a square number. And although it be possible to demonstrate this many other wayes, yet this semeth to vs suffici

Now for that as the square of the line BA is to the square of the line AF, so is the number CD to the number

CE, therfore the square of the line BA hath to the square of the line AF, that proportion that the nūber CD hath to the number CE. Wherfore the square of the line BA is cō
                  mēsurable to the square of the line AF (by the 6. of the tēth). But the square of the line AB is rational. Wherfore also the square of the line AF is rational. Wherfore also the line AF is rationall. And forasmuch as the number CD hath not vnto the number CE that proportion that a square number hath to a square number, therfore neither also hath the square of the line AB to the square of the line AF that proportion

that a square number hath to a square number. Wherfore (by the 9. of the tēth) the line AB is vnto the line AF incommensurable in length. Wherfore the lines AF and AB are rationall commensurable in power onely. And for that as the number DC is to the number CE, so is the square of the line AB to the square of the line AF: therfore by conuersion or euerse proportiō which is demonstrated (by the corollary of the 19. of the fifth) as the number CD is to the number DE, so is the square of the line AB to the square of the line BF, which is the excesse of the square of the line AB aboue the square of the line AF (by the assumpt put before the 14. of this booke). But the number CD hath to the number DE that proportion that a square number hath to a square number: wherfore the square of the line AB hath to the square of the line BF, that proportion that a square num
                     •
                  er hath to a square number. Wherefore (by the 9. of the tenth) the line AB is commensurable in length vnto the line BF. And (by the 47. of the first) the square of the line AB is equall to the squares of the lines AF and FB. Wherfore the line AB is in power more then the line AF by the square of the line BF which is commensurable in length vnto the line AB. Wherefore there are found out two such rationall lines commensurable in power onely, namely, AB and AF, so that the greater line AB is in power more then the lesse line AF, by the square of the line FB, which is commensurable in length vnto the line AB: which was required to be done.

And we may in like sort,Demonstration. as we did in the former proposition, proue that the lines BA and AF are rationall commensurable in power onely. And for that as the number DC is to the number CE, so is the square of the line AB to the square of the line AF: therefore by conuersion (by the corollary of the 19. of the fifte) as the number CD is to the number DE, so is the square of the line AB to the square to the line FB.

Wherefore the line AB is (by the 9 of the tenth) incommensurable in length to the line BF. And the line AB is in power more then the line AF by the square of the right line BF, which is incommensurable in length vnto the line AB. Wherfore the lines AB and AF are rationall commensurable in power onely.

But the parallelograme AD is that which is bontained vnder the lines AB and BC, for the line BC is equall to the line BD and the parallelograme BE is the square of the line BC. Wherefore as the line AB is to the line BC so is the parallelograme coutained vnder the lines AB and BC to the square of the line BC, which was required to be proued.

The lines C, B, D, are in continuall proportion by the second part of the 17. of the sixt. But the lines A, C, D are also in continuall proportion by the same.

Wherefore (by the 17. of the sixt) the parallelogramme contained vnder the lines BC &amp; BD, is equall to the, square of the line AB.

Wherefore as the line BC is to the line AC,I. Dee so is the line, AC to the line DC. The second Corollary. Wherefore the parallelogramme contained vnder the lines BC and CD, is equall to the square of the line AC.
                        Therefore if you deuide the square of the side AC, by the side BC, the portion DC, will be the product. &amp;c. as in the former Coroll

As touching the fourth, that the parallelogramme contained vnder the lines BC and AD, is equall to the parallelogramme contained vnder the lines BA and AC, is thus proued. For forasmuch as (as we haue already declared) the triangle ABC is like, and therefore equiangle, to the triangle ABD, therefore as the line BC is to

And it is called a binomium, that is, hauing two names, because it is made of two such lines as of his partes which are onely commensurable in power and not in length: and therefore ech part or line, or at the least the one of them, as touching length, is vncertaine and vnknowne. Wherefore being ioyned together their quantitie cannot be expressed by any one number or name, but ech part remayneth to be seuerally named in such sort as it may.

Now then agayne (by the 44, of the first) vpon the line DE apply the parallelograme EH equall to the squares of the lines AB and BC. Wherefore the parallelograme remayning, namely, HF, is equall to that which is contained vnder the lines AB and BC twise. And forasmuch as either of these lines AB and BC is mediall, therefore the squares of the lines AB and BC are also mediall. And that which is contained vnder the lines AB and BC twise is (by the corollary of the

And to that which is contayned vnder the lines AB and BC is commensurable that which is contained vnder the lines AB and BC twise (by the 6 of the tenth) wherefore that which is composed of the squares of the lines AB and BC is incommensurable to that which is contayned vnder the lines AB and BC twise.

                  The definition wherof is euident by this Proposition, which is thus. A second bimediall line is an irrationall line, which is made of two mediall lines commensurable in power onely ioyned together, which comprehend a mediall superficies. And it is called a second bimediall, because the two mediall lines of which it is composed, cōtaine a mediall superficies, and not a rationall.

Then I say, that the whole line AC is irrationall.Demonstration. For forasmuch as (by supposition) the parallelogramme contained vnder the lines AB and BC is mediall, therefore the parallelogramme contained twise vnder the lines AB and BC is mediall. (For that which is contained vnder AB and BC twise, is commensurable to that which is cōtained vnder AB and BC once (by the 6. of the tenth). Wherefore (by the Corollary of the 23. of the tenth) that which is contained vnder AB &amp; BC twise, is mediall). But by supposition that which i

of the squares of the lines AB and BC. Wherfore

(by the 16. of the tenth) that which is composed of the squares of the lines AB and BC together with that which is contayned vnder the lines AB &amp; BC twise, which is (by the 4. of the second) equall to the square of the line AC, is incommensurable to that which is composed of the squares of the lines AB and BC. But that which is composed of the squares of the lines AB and BC, is rationall. Wherefore the square of the whole line AC, is irrationall. Wherefore the line AC also is irrationall. And is called a greater line. And it is called a greater line for that that which is composed of the squares of the lines AB &amp; BC which are rationall, is greater then that which is contayned vnder the lines AB and BC twise, which are mediall. Now it is meete that the name should be geuen according to the propertie of the rationall.
               
                  An Assumpt.
                  And that the superficies composed of the squares of the lines AB and BC,An Assumpt. is greater then that which is contained vnder the lines AB and BC twise, may thus be proued. First it is manifest, that the lines AB and BC are vnequall: for if they were equall, then the squares of the lines AB and BC should be equall to that which is contained vnder the lines AB and BC twise, so that that which is cōtained vnder AB

and BC, should also be rationall: which is contrary to the supposition. Wherefore the lines AB and BC are vnequall. Suppose then that the line AB be the greater, &amp; let the line BD be equall to the line BC. Wherfore (by the 7. of the second) the squares of the lines AB and BD, are equall to that which is contained vnder the lines AB and BC twise and to the square of the line AD. But the line DB is equall to the line BC. Wherefore the squares of the lines AB and BC, are equall to that which is contained vnder the lines AB and BC twise and to the square of the line AD. Wherefore the squares of the lines AB and BC are greater then that which is contayned vnder the lines AB and BC twise, by the square of the line AD: which was required to be proued.
                  
                     This Proposition teacheth the production of the fift irrationall line, which is called a greater line: which is by the sense of this Proposition thus defined.
                  
                  A greater line is an irrationall line, which is composed of two right lines which are incommensurable in power,Diffinition of a greater line. the squares of which added together, make a rationall superficies, and the parallelogramme which they containe, is mediall. It is therefore called a greater line, as Theon sayth, because the squares of the two lines of which it is composed, added together being rationall, are greater then the mediall superficies contained vnder them twise. And it is conuenient that the denomination be taken of the proprietie of the rationall part, rather then of the mediall part.
                  
               
            
            
               ¶The 28. Theoreme. The 40. Proposition. If two right lines incōmensurable in power be added together, hauing that which is made of the squares of them added together mediall, and the parallelogramme contayned vnder them rationall: the whole right line is irrationall, and is called a line contayning in power a rationall and a mediall superficies.

                  inde out two such lines). Then I say, that the whole line AC is irrationall.Demonstration. For forasmuch as that which is composed of the squares of the lines AB and BC is mediall, but that which is contained vnder the lines AB and BC twise is rationall, therefore that which is composed of the squares of the lines AB and BC, is incommensurable to that which is contained vnder the lines AB and BC twise. Wherefore (by the 16. of the tenth) that which is composed of the squares of the lines AB and BC together with that which is contayned vnder the lines AB and BC

twise, which (by the 4. of the second) is the square of the whole line AG, is incommensurable to that which is contained vnder the lines AB and BC twise. But that which is contained vnder the lines AB and BC twise, is rationall, for that which is contained vnder the lines AB and BC once is put to be rationall. Wherefore the square of the whole line AC is irrationall. Wherefore the line AC also is irrationall. And it is therefore called a line containing in power a rationall and a mediall superficies, because the power thereof contayneth two superficieces, whereof the one is rationall, namely, that which is contained vnder the two partes, and the other mediall, namely, that which is made of the squares of the partes added together. And by reason that the rationall is in order of nature &amp; of knowledge before the mediall, therfore the first part of the denomination is taken of it, and the second part is taken of the mediall which was required to be proued.
               
                  In this Proposition is taught the generation of the sixt irrationall line, which is called a line whose power is rationall and mediall. The definition of which is gathered of thys Proposition after this maner.
               
               A line whose power is rationall and mediall, is an irrationall line which is made of two right lines incommensurable in power added together,Diffinition of a line whose power is rationall and mediall. whose squares added together make a mediall superficies, but that supersicies which they containe is rationall. The reason of the name is before set forth in the Proposition.

Take a rationall line DE, and (by

                  he 44. of the first) vpon the line DE apply the parallelogramme DF equall to the squares of the lines AB and BC. And vpon the line GF, which is equall to the line DE, apply the parallelogrāme GH equall to that which is contained vnder the lines AB and BC tw
                     •
                  se. Wherefore the

whole parallelogramme DH is equall to the square of the line AC (by the 4. of the second.Demonstration.) And forasmuch as that which is composed of the squares of the lines AB and BC is mediall and is equall to the parrllelogramme DF: therfore DF also is mediall (by that which was said in the 38. proposition of this booke). And it is

applied vpon the rationall line DE. Wherefore the line DG is rationall and incommensurable in lēgth vnto ye line DE (by the 22. of the tēth). And by the same reason the lyne GK is rational &amp; incōmesurable in length vnto the line GF, that is, vnto the line DE. And forasmuch as that which is composed of ye squares of the lines AB &amp; BC added together, is by supposition incōmensurable to that which is cōtained vnder the lines AB and BC twise, therfore also the parallelogramme DF is incommensurable vnto the parallelogramme GH. Wherfore also the line DG is incommensurable vnto the line GK (by the first of the sixt) and by the tenth of the tenth. But it is now proued that they are rationall. Wherfore the lines DG and GK are rationall commensurable in power onely. Wherfore (by the 36. of the tenth) the whole line DK is rationall, and is called a binomiall line, but the line DE is irrationall. Wherfore the parallelogramme DH is irrationall (by the corollary added after the 22. propositiō of the tenth). Wherfore also the line which containeth it in power is irrationall: but the line AC containeth it in power. Wherfore the line AC is irrationall, and is called a line contayning in power two medials. It is called a line containing in power two medials, for that it contayneth in power two mediall supersicieces; one of which is composed of the squares of the lynes AB and BC added together; and the other is that which is contained vnder the lines AB &amp; BC twise: which was required to be demonstrated.
               
                  In this proposition is taught the nature of the 7. kinde of irrationall lines which is called a line whose power is two medials. The definition whereof is taken of this proposition after this maner.
               
               A line whose power is two medials, is an irrationall line which is composed of two right lines incommensurable in power,Diffinition of a li

                     e containing in power two medials. the squares of which added together, make a mediall superficies, and that which is contained vnder them is also mediall, and moreouer it is incommensurable to that which is composed of the two squares added together.
               
                  The reason why this line is called a line whose power is two medials, was before in the ende of the demonstration declared.
               
               And that the said irrationall lines are deuided one way onely, that is, in one point onely, into the right lines of which they are composed, and which make euery one of the kindes of those irrationall lines, shall straight way be demonstrated: but first will we demonstrate two assumptes here following.
               
                  ¶An Assumpt.
                  Take a right line and let the same be AB, and deuide it into two vnequall partes in the point C,An Assumpt. and againe deuide the same line AB into two other vnequal partes, in an other point namely, in D, and let the line AC (by supposition) be greater then the line DB. Then I say

that the squares of the lines AC and BC added together, are greater then the squares of the lines AD and DB added together. Deuide the line AB (by the 10. of the first) into two equall partes in the point E. And forasmuch as the line AC is greater then the line DB, take away the line DC which is common to them both: wherfore the residue AD is greater then the residue CB, but the line AE is equall to the line EB. Wherfore the line DE is lesse then the line EC. Wherfore the pointes C and D are not

equally distant from the point E, which is the point of the section into two equall partes. And forasmuch as (by the 5. of the second) that which is contayned vnder the lines AC and CB together with the square of the line EC is equall to the square of the line EB. And by the same reason that which is contayned vnder the lynes AD and DB together with the square of the line DE, is also equall to the self same square of the line EB: wherfore that which is contained vnder the lines AC and CB together with the square of the line EC is equall to that which is contained vnder the lines AD and DB together with the square of the line DE: of which the square of the line DE is lesse then the square of the line EC (for it was proued that the line DE is lesse then the line EC). Wherfore the parallelogramme remayning, contayned vnder the lines AC and CB is lesse thē the parallelogramme remayning contayned vnder the lines AD and DB. Wherfore also that which is contayned vnder the lines AC and CB twise is lesse then that which is contayned vnder the lines AD and DB twise. But (by the fourth of the second) the square of the whole line AB is equall to that which is composed of the squares of the lines AC and CB together with that which is contained vnder the lynes AC and CB twise, and by the same reason the square of the whole line AB is equall to that which is composed of the squares of the lines AD and DB together with that which is contayned vnder the lynes AD and DB twise: wherfore that which is composed of the squares of the lynes AC and CB together with that which is contayned vnder the lynes AC and CB twise, is equall to that which is composed of the squares of the lynes AD and DB, together with that which is contayned vnder the lynes AD and DB twise. But it is already proued that that which is contayned vnder the lynes AC and CB twise, is lesse then that which is contayned vnder the lines AD &amp; DB twise. Wherfore the residue, namely, that which is composed of the squares of the lines AC and CB is greater then the residue, namely, then that which is composed of the squares of the lines AD and DB: which was required to be demonstrated.
               
               
                  ¶An Assumpt.

                  Let AD be a rationall superficies, and let it exceede AF

being also a rationall superficies by the superficies ED. Then I say that the superficies ED is also rationall. For the parallelogramme AD is commensurable to the parallelogramme AF, for that either of them is rationall. Wherefore (by the second part of the 15. of the tenth) the parallelogramme AF is commensurable to the parallelogramme ED. But the the parallelogramme AF is rationall. Wherfore also the parallelogramme ED is rationall.

Wherefore these lines AC and CB are rationall commensurable in power onely.

Moreouer the line DB is either one and the same with the line AC

Wherfore putting the point B vpon the point A, the point D also shall fall vpon the point C, and the line AD which is the rest of the line AC, shall also be equall to the line CB, which is the rest of the line DB.

But that which is composed of the squares of the lines AD and DB excedeth that which is composed of the squares of the lines AC and CB by a rationall superficies (by the 2. assumpt going before this proposition

                  ) For that which is composed of the squares of the lines AD and DB is rationall, and so also is that which is composed of the squares of the lines AC and CB: for the lines AD and DB are put to be rationall commensurable in power onely, and so likewise are the lines AC and CB. Wherfore also that which is contained vnder the lines AC and CB twise, exceedeth that which is contained vnder the lines AD &amp; DB twise by a rational superficies, whē yet notwithstāding they are both medial superficieces (by the 21. of the tenth) which (by the 26. of the same) is impossible.

For either of those superficieces is rationall. Wherefore that which is composed of the squares of the lines AC and CB differeth from that which is composed of the squares of the lines AD and DB by a rationall superficies, when yet they are both mediall superficieces: which is impossible. Wherefore a first bimediall line is in one poynt onely deuided into his names: which was required to be proued.

                     ie. For the lines AC and CB are not commensurable in length the one to the other. Now I say that the line AB cannot be deuided into his names in any other poynt but onely in C. For if it be possible, let it be deuided into his names in the poynt D, so that let not the line AC be one and the same, that is, let it not be equall, with the line DB. But let it be greater then it. Now it is manifest (by the first assumpt going before the 42. proposition of this booke) that the squares of the lines AC and CB are greater then the squares of the lines AD and DB. And also that the lines AD and DB are mediall lines commensurable in power onely, comprehending a mediall supersicies. Take a rationall line EF. And (by the 44. of the first) vpon the line EF apply a rectangle parallelograme EK equall to the square of the line AB. From which parallelograme take away the parallelograme EG equall to the squares of the lines AC and CB Wherefore the residue, namely, the parallelograme HK is equall to that which is contained

vnder the lines AC and CB twise. Agayne from the the parallelograme EK take away the parallelograme EL equall to the squares of the lines AD and DB which are lesse then the squares of the lines AC and CB. Wherefore the residue,

namely, the parallelograme MK is equall to that which is contayned vnder the lines AD and DB twise. And forasmuch as the squares of the lines AC and CB are mediall, therefore the parallelograme EG also is mediall.Demonstration leading to an imp

                   wherefore the line EH is rationall and incommensurable in length to the line EF. And by the same reason, the parallelograme HK is mediall (for that which is equall vnto it, namely, that which is contayned vnder the lines AC and CB twise is mediall) therefore the line HN is also rationall and incommensurable in length vnto the line EF. And forasmuch as the lines AC and CB are mediall lines commensurable in power onely, therefore the line AC is incommensurable in length vnto the line CB. But as the line AC is to the line CB, so is the square of the line AC to that which is contayned vnder the lines AC and CB (by the 1. of the sixt). Wherefore the square of the line AC is incommensurable to that which is contayned vnder the lines AC and CB. But (by the 16. of the tenth) vnto the square of the line AC are commensurable the squares of the lines AC and CB added together, for the lines AC and CB are commensurable in power onely. And vnto that which is contayned vnder the lines AC and CB is commensurable that which is contayned vnder the lines AC and CB twise. Wherefore that which is composed of the squares of the lines AC and CB, is incommensurable to that which is contained vnder the lines AC and CB twise. But to the squares of the lines AC and CB is equall the parallelograme EG, and to that which is contained vnder the lines AC and CB twise is equall the paralelograme HK. Wherfore the parallelograme EG is incommensurable to the parallelograme HK. Wherefore also the line EH is incommensurable in length to the line HN. And the lines EH and HN are rationall. Wherefore they are rationall commensurable in power onely: but if two rationall lines commensurable in power onely be added together, the whole line is irrationall, and is called a binomiall line (by the 36. of the tenth). Wherefore the binomiall line EN is in the poynt H deuided into his names. And by the same reason also may it be proued that the lines EM and MN are rationall lines commensurable in power onely. Wherfore EN being a binomiall line is deuided into his names in sundry poyntes, namely, in H and M, neither is the line EH one and the same, that is, equal with MN. For the squares of the lines AC and CB are greater then the squares of the lines BD and AD (by the 1. assumpt put after the 41. of the tenth). But the squares of the lines AD and DB are greater then that which is contayned vnder the lines AD and DB twise (by the assumpt put after the 39. of the tenth). Wherefore the squares of the lines AC and CB, that is, the parallelograme EG is much greater then that which is contained vnder the lines AD and DB twise, that is then the parallelograme MK. Wherfore (by the first of the sixt) the line EH is greater then the line MN. Wherefore EH is not one and the same with MN. Wherefore a binomiall line is in two sundry poyntes deuided into his names. Which is impossible. The selfe same absurditie also will follow if the line AC be supposed to be lesse then the line DB. A second binomiall line therefore is not deuided into his names in sundry poyntes. Wherefore it is deuided in one onely: which was required to be demonstrated.

Wherefore the whole parallelogramme EK is equall to the square of the line AB.Demonstration leading to an absurditie. Againe vpon the same line EF describe the parallelogramme EL equall to the squares of the lines AD and DB. Wherefore the residue, namely, that which is contayned vnder the lines AD and DB twise, is equall to the parallelogramme remaining, namely, to MK.

Wherefore (by the 22. of the tenth) the line HE is rationall and incommensurable in length vnto the line EF. And by the same reason also the line HN is rationall and incommensurable in length to the same line EF. And forasmuch as that which is composed of the squares of the lines AC and CB is incommensurable to that which is contained vnder the lines AC and CB twise (for it is supposed to be incommensurable to that which is cōtained vnder the lines AC and CB once): therefore the parallelogramme EG is incommensurable to the parallelogramme H

Wherefore the whole line EN is a binomiall line, and is deuided into his names in the point H. And in like sort may we proue, that the same binomiall line EN is deuided into his names in the point M, and that the line EH is not one and the same that is equall with the line MN, as it was proued in the end of the demonstration of the 44. of this booke. Wherefore a binomiall line is deuided into his names in two sundry pointes: which is impossible (by the 42. of the tenth).

Wherfore by conuersiō (by the corollary of the 19. of the fift) as the nūber AB is to the number BC
                     •
                   so is the square of the line EF to the square of the line H. But the nūber AB hath not to the number BC that proportiō that a square number hath to a square number. Wherefore neither also hath the square of the line EF to the square of the line H that proportion that a square number hath to a square number. Wherfore (by the 9. of the tenth) the line EF is incommensurable in length to the line H. Wherfore the line EF is in power more then the line FG by the square of a line incommensurable in length vnto it. And the lines EF and FG are rationall commensurable in power onely. And the line FG being the lesse name, is commensurable in length to the rationall line geuen, namely, to D. Wherfore the whole line EG is a fift binomiall line: which was required to be found out.
            
            
               ¶The 18. Probleme. The 53. Proposition. To finde out a sixt binomiall line.
               TAke two numbers AC &amp; CB, and let thē be such that the number which is made of them both added together,Construction. namely, AB, haue to neither of the numbers AC or CB that proportion that a

square nūber hath to a square number. Take also any other number which is not a square number, and let the same be D. And let not the number D haue to any one of these numbers AB and AC that proportion that a square number hath to a square nūber. Let there be put moreouer a rationall line,

and let the same be E. And as the number D is to the number AB, so let the square of the line E be to the square of FG. Wherefore (by the 6. of the tenth) the line E is commensurable in power to the line FG, &amp; the line E is rationall. Wherfore also the line FG is rationall. And for that the number D hath not

                  o the number AB that proportion that a square nūber hath to a square number, therefore neither also shall the square of the line E haue to the square of the line FG that proportion that a square number hath to a square number. Wherefore the line FG is incommensurable in length to the line E. Againe, as the number BA is to the number AC, so let the square of the line FG be to the square of the line GH.Demonstration. Wherefore (by the 6. of the tenth) the square of the line FG is commensurable to the square of the line GH. And the square of the line FG is rationall. Wherefore the square of the line GH is also rationall. Wherefore also the line GH is rationall. And for that the number AB hath not to the number AC, that proportion that a square number hath to a square number: there
                     •
                  ore neither also hath the square of the line FG to the square of the line GH, that proportion that a square number hath to a square number. Wherefore the line FG is incommensurable in length to the line GH. Wherefore the lines FG and GH are rationall commensurable in power onely. Wherefore the whole line FH is a binomiall line. I say moreouer, that it is a sixt binomiall line. For for that as the number D is to the number AB, so is the square of the line E to the square of the line FG. And as the number BA is to the number AC, so is the square of the line FG to the square of the line GH. Wherefore of equalitie (by the 22. of the fift) as the number D is to the number AC, so is the square of the line E to the square of the line GH. But the number D hath not to the nūber AC that proportion that a square number hath to a square number. Wherefore neither also hath the square of the line E to the square of the line GH that proportion that a square number hath to a square number. Wherfore the line E is incommensurable in length to the line GH. And it is already proued, that the line FG is also incommensurable in length to the line E. Wherefore either of these lines FG and GH is incommensurable in length to the line E. And for that as the number 
                     •
                  A is to the number AC; so is the square of the line FG to the square of the line GH: therfore the square of the line FG is greater then the square of the line GH. Vnto the square of the line FG, let the squares of the lines GH and K be equall. Wherefore by euersion of proportion, as the number AB is to the number BC, so is the square of the line FG to the square of the line K. But the number AB hath not to the number BC that proportion that a square number hath to a square number. Wherefore neither also hath the square of the line FG to the square of the line K that proportion that a square number hath to a square number. Wherefore the line FG is incommensurable in length vnto the line K. Wherefore the line FG is in power more then the line GH, by the square of a line incommensurable in length to it. And the lines FG and GH are rationall commensurable in power onely. And neither of the lines FG &amp; GH is commensurable in length to the rationall line geuen, namely, to E. Wherefore the line FH is a sixt binomiall line: which was required to be found out.

                        fly without farther demonstration of the 25. of this booke.Suppose that there be two squares AB and BC, and let the lines DB and BE so be put that they both make one right line. Wherefore (by the 14. of the first) the lines FB and BG make also both one right line. And make perfect the parallelogramme AC. Then I say, that the rectangle parallelogramme DG is the meane proportionall betwene the squares AB and BC: and moreouer, that the parallelogramme DC is the meane proportionall betwene the squares AC and CB. First the parallelogramme AG is a square. For forasmuch as the line DB is equall to the line BF, and the line BE vnto the line BG, therfore the whole line DE is equall to the whole line FG. But the line DE is equall to either of these lines AH &amp; KC, and the line FG is equall to either of these lines AK and HC (by the 34. of the first).Demonstration. Wherfore the parallelogrāme AC is equilater, it is also rectangle

(by the 29. of the first). Wherefore (by the 46. of the first) the parallelogrāme AC is a square. Now for that as the line FB is to the line BG, so is the line DB to the line BE. But as ye line FB is to the line BG, so (by the 1. of the sixt) is the parallelogrāme AB, which is the square of the line DB, to the parallelogramme DG, and as the line DB is to the line BE, so is the same parallelogrāme DG to the parallelogramme BC, which is the square of the line BE. Wherefore as the square AB is to the parallelogramme DG, so is the same parallelogramme DG to the square BC. Wherefore the parallelogramme DG is the meane proportionall betwene the squares AB and BC. I say moreouer, that the parallelogramme DC is the meane proportionall betwene the squares AC and CB. For for that as the line AD is to the line DK, so is the line KG to the line GC (for they are ech equall to eche). Wherefore by composition (by the 18. of the fift) as the line AK is to the line KD, so is the line KC to the line CG. But as the line AK is to the line KD, so is the square of the line AK, which is the square AC, to the parallelogramme cōtayned vnder the lines AK and KD, which is the parallelogramme CD: and as the line KC is to the line CG, so also is the parallelogramme DC to the square of the line GC, which is the square BC. Wherefore as the square AC is to the parallelogramme DC, so is the parallelogrāme DC to the square BC. Wherefore the parallelogramme DC is the meane proportionall betwene the squares AC and BC: which was required to be demonstrated.

And as A is to B, so let B be to C. And likewise as the same magnitude A is to D, so let D be to the same magnitude C. Then I say that B and D are equall the one the other. For the proportion of A vnto C is double to that proportion which A hath to B (by the 10. definition of the fift) and likewise the selfe same proportion of A to C is (by the same definition) double to that proportion which A hath to D. But magnitudes whose equemultiplices are either equall or the selfe same, are also equall. Wherefore as A is to B, so is A to D. Wherefore (by the 9. of the fift) B and D are equall the one to the other. So shall if also be if there be other magnitudes equal to A and C, namely, E and F, betwene which let the magnitude D be the meane proportionall.

For forasmuch as the line AD is a first binomial line, it is in one only point deuided into

his names (by the 42. of this tenth): let it be deuided into his names in the point E. And let AE be the greater name. Now it is manifest that the lines AE and ED are rationall c

                  mmensurable

in power onely, and that the line AE is in power more then the line ED, by the square of a line commensurable in length to the line AE, and moreouer that the line AE is commensurable in length to the rationall line geuen AB by the definition of a first Binomiall line set before the 48. proposition of this tenth. Deuide (by the 10. of the first) the line ED into two equall partes in the point F. And forasmuch as the line AE is in power more then the line ED by the square of a line commensurable in length vnto the line AE, therefore if vpon the greater line, namely, vpon the line AE be applied a parallelogramme equall to the fourth part of the square of the lesse line, that is, to the square of the line EF, &amp; wanting in forme by a square, it shall deuide the greater line, namely, AE into two partes còmmensurable in length the one to the other (by the second part of the 17. of the tenth.) Apply therfore vpon the line AE a parallelogramme equall to the square of the line EF, and wanting in forme by a square by the 28. of the sixt, and let the same be that which is contained vnder the lines AG and GE. Wherfore the line AG is commensurable in length to the lyne

GE. Draw by the pointes G, E, and F, to either of these lines AB and DG these parallel lines GH, EK, and FL (by the 31. of the first) And (by the 14. of the second) vnto the parallelogramme AH describe an equall square SN. And vnto the parallelogramme GK describe (by the same) an equal square NP. And let these lines MN &amp; NX be so put, that they both make one right line. Wherfore (by the 14. of the first) the lines RN and NO make also both one right line.Demonstration. Make perfect the parallelogramme SP. Wherfore the parallelogramme SP is a square by those thinges which were demonstrated after the determination in the first assumpt going before. And forasmuch as that which is contained vnder the lines AG and GE is equall to the square of the line EF (by construction): therfore as the line AG is to the EF, so is the line EF to the line EG (by the 14. or 17. of the sixt) Wherfore also (by the 1. of the sixt) as the parallelogramme AH is to the parallelogramme EL, so is the parallelogramme EL to the parallelogramme GK. Wherfore the parallelogramme EL is the meane proportionall betwene the parallelogrammes AH and GK. But the parallelogramme AH is equal to the square SN, and the parallelogrāme GK is equal to the square NP by cōstruction. Wherfore the parallelogramme EL is the meane proportionall betwene the squares SN and NP (by the 7. of the fifth) But (by the first assumpt going before) the parallelogramme MR is the meane proportionall betwene the squares SN and NP. Wherefore the parallelogramme MR is equall to the parallelogramme EL (by the last assumpt going before) But the parallelogramme MR is equal to the parallelogramme OX (by the 43. of the first) and the parallelogramme EL is equall to the parallelogrāme FC by construction, and by the first of the sixt. Wherfore the whole parallelogramme EC is equall to the two parallelogrammes MR &amp; OX. And the parallelogrammes AH and GK are equall to the squares SN and NP by construction. Wherfore the whole parallelogramme AC is equal to the whole square SP, that

is, to the square of the line MX.The first part of this demonstration concluded. Wherefore the line MX containeth in power the parallelogramme AC. I say moreouer that the line MX is a binomiall line. For forasmuch as (by the 17. of the tenth) the line AG is commensurable in length to the line EG. Therefore (by the 15. of the tenth) the whole line AE is commensurable in length to either of th

                  se lines AG and GE. But by supposition the line AE is commensurable in length to the line AB. Wherfore (by the 12. of the tenth) either of the lines AG &amp; GE are commensurable in lēgth to the line AB. But the line AB is rationall. Wherefore either of these lines AG and GE is rationall. Wherfore (by the 19. of the tenth) either of these parallelogrammes AH and GK is rationall. Wherfore (by the first of the sixt, and 10. of the tenth) the parallelogramme AH is commensurable to the parallelogramme GK. But the parallelogramme AH is equall to the

square SN,The secōd part of the demonstration concluded. and the parallelogramme GK is equall to the square NP Wherfore the squares SN and NP, which are the squares of the lines MN and NX are rationall and commensurable. And forasmuch as (by supposition) the line AE is incommensurable in length to the line ED. But the line AE is commensurable in length to the line AG. And the line DE is commensurable in length to the line EF, for it is double to it by construction. Wherfore (by the 13. of the tenth) the line AG is incommensurable in length to the line EF. Wherfore the parallelogramme AH is incommensurable to the parallelogramme EL. But the parallelogramme AH is equal to the square SN, and the parallelogramme EL is equall to the parallelogramme MR. Wherfore the square SN is incommensurable to the parallelogramme MR. But as the square SN is to the parallelogramme MR, so is the line ON to the line NR by the 1. of the sixt.The third part cōcluded. Wherfore the line ON is incommensurable to the line NR. But the line ON is equall to the line MN, and the line NR to the line NX. Wherfore the line MN is incommensurable to the line NX. And it is already proued that the squares of the lines MN and NX are rationall and commensurable. Wherefore the lines MN and NX are rationall commensurable in power onely.The totall conclusion. Wherfore the whole line MX is a binomiall line, and it containeth in power the parallelogramme AC: which was required to be proued.
            
            
               ¶ The 37. Theoreme. The 55. Proposition. If a superficies be comprehended vnder a rationall line and a second binomiall line: the line that contayneth in power that superficies is irrationall, and is a first bimediall line.
               SVppose that the superficies ABCD be contayned vnder a rationall line AB, and vnder a second binomiall line AD. Then I say that the line that containeth in power the superficies AC is a first bimediall line. For forasmuch as AD is a second binomiall line, it can in one onely point be deuided into his names, by the

43. of this tenth: let it therefore by supposition be deuided into his names in the poynt E, so that let AE be the greater name. Wherefore the lines AE and ED are rationall commensurable in power onely, and the line AE is in power more then the line ED by the square of a line commensurable in length to AE, and the lesse name, namely, ED is commensurable in length to the line AB by the definition of a second binomiall line, set before the 48. propositiō of this tenth. Deuide the line ED (by the tēth of the first) into two equall partes in the poynt F. And (by the 28. of the sixt) vpon the line AE apply a parallelogramme equal to the square of the line EF, and wanting in figure by a square. And let the same parallelogramme be that which is contayned vnder the lines AG and GE. Wherefore (by the second part of the 17. of this tenth) the line AG is commensurable in length to the line GE. And (by the 31. of the first) by the poyntes G, E, F, draw vnto the lines AB and CD these parallel lines, GH, EK, &amp; FL. And (by the 14. of the second) vnto the parallelogrāme AH describe an equall square SN. And to the parallelogrāme GK describe an equall square NP, and let the lines MN &amp; NX be so put that they both make one right line: wherefore (by the 14. of the first) the lines also RN, and NO make both one right line.Demo

                  ame MR is the meane proportionall betwene the squares SN and NP, and is equall to the parallelogramme EL, and that the line MX contayneth in power the superficies

AC. Now resteth to proue that the line MX is a first bimediall line. Forasmuch as the line AE is incommensurable in length to the line ED, and the line ED is commensurable in length to the line AB, therefore (by the 13. of the tenth) the line AE is incommensurable in length to the line AB. And forasmuch as the line AG is commensurable in length to the line GE therefore the whole line AE is (by the 15. of the tenth) commensurable in length to either of these lines AG and GE. But the line AE is rationall: wherefore either of these lines AG and GE is rationall. And forasmuch as the line AE is incommensurable in length to the line AB, but the line AE is commensurable in lēgth to either of these lines AG and GE: wherefore either of the lines AG and GE are incommensurable in length to the line AB (by the 13. of the tenth). Wherefore the lines AB, AG, and GE are rationall commensurable in power onely. Wherefore (by the 21. of the tenth) either of these parallelogrāmes AH and GK is a mediall super

the line AE is in power more thē the line ED by the square of a line cōmensurable in length to the line AE, and neither of the lines AE nor ED is commensurable in length to the line AB by the definition of a third binomiall line set before the 48. Proposition. As in the former Propositions it was demonstrated, so also may it in this Proposition be proued, that the

line MX containeth in power the superficies AC, and that the lines MN and NX are mediall lines commensurable in power onely. Wherefore the line MX is a bimediall line. Now resteth to proue that it is a second bimediall line. Forasmuch as the line DE is (by supposition)

incommensurable in length to the line AB, that is, to the line EK. But the line ED is commensurable in length to the line EF. Wherefore (by the 13. of the tenth) the line EF is incommensurable in length to the line EK. And the lines FE and EK are rationall. For by sup

                  osition the line ED is rationall, vnto which the line FE is commensurable. Wherefore the lines FE and EK are rationall lines commensurable in power onely. Wherefore (by the 21. of the tenth) the parallelogramme EL, that is, the parallelogramme MR which is contayned vnder the lines MN and NX is a mediall superficies. Wherefore that which is contayned vnder the lines MN and NX is a mediall superficies. Wherefore the line MX is a second bimediall line (by the 38.

For, forasmuch as the line AD is a fourth binomiall line, therefore the lines AE and ED are rationall commensurable in power onely. And the line AE is in power more then the line ED by the square of a line incommensurable in length to AE. And the line AE is commensurable in length to the line AB. Deuide (by the 10. of the first) the line DE into two equall partes in the point F. And vpon the line AE apply a parallelogramme equall to the square of EF and wanting in figure by a square: and let the same parallelogramme be that which is contayned vnder the lines AG &amp; GE. Wherefore (by the second part of the 18. of the tenth) the line AG is incommensurable in length to the line EG. Draw vnto the line AB, by the pointes G, E, F, parallell lines GH, EK, and PL, and let the rest of the construction be as it was in the three former Propositions.Demonstration. Now it is manifest, that the line MX contayneth in power the superficies AC. Now resteth to proue that the line MX is an

irrationall line, and a greater line. Forasmuch as the line AG is incommensurable in length to the line EG, therefore (by the 1. of the sixt, and 11. of the tenth) the parallelogramme  AH is incommensurable to the parallelogramme GK, that is, the square SN to the square NP.

                  , therefore the parallelogramme

AK is rationall. And it is equall to the squares of the lines MN and NX. Wherfore that which is composed of the squares of the lines MN and NX added together is rationall. And forasmuch as the line ED is incommensurable in length to the line AB, that is, to the line EK, but the line ED is commensurable in length to the line EF, therefore the  line EF is incommensurable in length to the line EK. Wherefore the lines EK and EF are rationall commensurable in power onely. Wherefore (by the 21. of the tenth) the parallelogramme LE, that is, the parallelogramme MR is mediall. And the parallelogrāme MR  is that which is contayned vnder the lines MN, and NX. Wherefore that which is contayned vnder the lines MN and NX is mediall. And that which is composed of the squares of the lines MN &amp; NX is proued to be rationall, &amp; the line MN is demonstrated to be incommensurable in power to the line NX. But if two lines incommensurable in power be added together, hauing that which is made of the squares of them added together rationall, &amp; that which is vnder them mediall, the whole line is irrationall, and is called a greater line (by the 39. of the tenth). Wherefore the line MX is irrationall, and is a greater line, and it containeth in power the superficies AC: which was required to be demonstrated.

in length to the line AB. But the line AE is incommensurable in length to the line ED. Wherefore (by the 13. of the tenth) the line AB is incommensurable in length to the line AE. Wherefore the lines AB and AE are rationall commensurable in power onely. Wherefore (by the 21. of the tenth) the parallelogramme AK is mediall, that is, that which is composed of the squares of the lines MN &amp; NX added together. And forasmuch  as the line DE is commensurable in length to the line AB, that is, to the line EK, but the line DE is commensurable in length to the line EF, wherefore (by the 12. of the tenth) the line EF is also commensurable in length to the line EK. And the line EK is rationall. Wherefore (by the 19. of the tenth) the parallelogramme EL, that is, the parallelogramme MR, which is contayned vnder the lines MN and NX is rationall. Wherefore the lines  MN and NX are incommensurable in power, hauing that which is composed of the squares of them added together, Mediall, and that which is contayned vnder them, Rationall. Wherefore (by the 40. of the tenth) the whole line MX is a line contayning in power a rationall and a mediall superficies, and it contayneth in power the superficies AC: which was required to be proued.

                        Looke after the Assumpt concluded at this marke: for plainer opening of this place.
                      
                     alternate proportiō, and the 14. of the fift. But the squares of the lines AC and CB are double to the squares of the lines AD and DC (by the 9. of the secōd). Therfore the squares of AC and CB are more then double to the square of AD alone, (leauing out the square of DC) by the 8. of the fift. But the parallelogramme contained vnder the lines AC and 
                           •
                        B twise, is proued lesse thē the double of the square of the line AD. Therfore the same parallelogramme contained vnder the lines AC and CB twise, is much lesse then the squares of the lines AC and CB. If a right line therfore be deuided into two vnequall partes, the squares which are made of the vnequall partes, are greater thē the rectangle parallelogramme contained vnder the vnequall partes, twise: which was required to be demonstrated.
                  
                  In numbers I neede not to haue so alleaged, for the 17. of the seuenth had confirmed the doubles to be one to the other, as their singles were, but in our magnitudes, it likewise is true and euident by alternate proportion, thus. As the parallelogramme of the lines AC and CB is to his double, so is the square of the line AD to his double (eche being halfe). Wherfore, alternately, as the parallelogramme is to the square, so is the parallelograme his double to the double of the square. But the parallelograme was proued lesse then th

Wherefore either of these parallelogrammes MX and NF is equall to that which is contayned vnder the lines AC and CB once, by the 15. of the fifth. And forasmuch as the line AB is a binomiall line, and is deuided into his names in the poynt C therefore the

                  ines AC and CB are rationall commensurable in power onely. Wherefore the squares of the lines AC and CB are rationall, and therefore commensurable the one to the other. Wherefore (by the 15. of the tenth) that which is made of the squares of the lines AC and CB added together is commensurable to either of the squares of the lines AC or CB: wherefore that which is made of the squares of the line

                  AC and CB added together is rationall. And it is equall to the parallelograme DL by construction. Wherefore the parallelograme DL is rationall. And it is applyed vnto the rational line DE: wherefore (by the 20. of the tenth) the line DM is rationall, and commensurable in length to the line DE. Agayne forasmuch as the lines AC and CB are rationall commensurable in power onely, therefore that which is contayned vnder the lines AC and CB

Wherefore the line MG is rationall and incommensurable in length to the line ML (by the 22. of this tenth) that is, to the line DE. But the line MD is proued rationall and commensurable in length to the line DE. Wherefore (by the 13. of the tenth) the  line DM is incommensurable in length to the line MG. Wherefore the lines DM &amp; M

Now resteth to proue that it is a first binomiall line. Forasmuch as (by the the assumpt going before the 54. of the tenth) that which is contayned vnder the lines AC and CB is the meane proportionall betwene the squares of the lines AC and CB, therefore the parallelograme MX is the meane proportionall betwene the parallelogrammes DH and KL. Wherefore as the parallelogame DH
                  
                     •
                   is to the parallelograme MX, so is the parallelograme MX to the parallelograme KL, that is, as the line DK is to the line MN, so is the line MN to the line MK. Wherefore that which is contayned vnder the lines DK and KM is equall to the square of the line MN. And forasmuch as the square of the line AC is commensurable to the square of the line CB, the parallelograme DH is commensurable to the prarallelograme KL. Wherefore (by the 1. of the sixt and 10. of the tenth) the line

And forasmuch as the squares of the lines AC and CB are greater then that which is contayned vnder the lines AC and CB twise by the assumpt going before this proposition, or by the assumpt after this 39. of the tenth, therefore the parallelograme DL is greater then the parallelograme MF. Wherefore (by the first of the sixt) the line DM is greater then the line MG. And that which is contayned vnder the lines DK and KM is equall to the square of the line MN, that is to the fourth part of the square  of the line MG. But (by the 17. of the tenth), if there be two vnequall right lines, and if vppon the greater be applyed a parallelograme equall to the fourth part of the square made of the lesse line and wanting in figure by a square, if also the parallelograme thus applyed de

Wherefore the line DM is in power more then the line MG by the square of a line commensurable in length vnto the line DM. And the lines DM and MG are proued rationall  commensurable in power onely. And the line DM is proued the greater name and commensurable in length to the rationall line geuen DE. Wherefore by the definition of a first binomiall line se

                  This proposition and the fiue following are the conuerses of the sixe former propositions.
               
            
            
               ¶ The 43. Theoreme. The 61. Proposition. The square of a first bimediall line applied to a rationall line, maketh the breadth or other side a second binomiall line.
               SVppose that the line AB be a first bimediall line, and let it be supposed to be deuided into his partes in the point C, of which let AC be the greater part. Take also a rationall line DE, and (by the 44. of the first) apply to the line DE the parallelogrāme DF equall to the square of the line AB, &amp; making in breadth the line DG.Construction. Then I say, that the line DG is a second binomiall line. Let the same constructions be in this, that were in the Proposition going before. And forasmuch as the line AB is a first bimediall line,Demonstrati

                     n. and is deuided into his partes in the point C, therefore (by the 37. of the tenth) the lines AC and CB are

mediall commensurable in power onely, cōprehending a rationall superficies. Wherfore also the squares of the lines AC and CB are mediall. Wherefore the parallelogramme DL is mediall (by the Corollary of the 23. of the tenth) and it is applied vppon the rationall line DE. Wherefore (by the 22. of the tenth) the line MD is rationall and incommensurable in length to the line DE. Againe forasmuch as that  which is cōtayned vnder the lines AC and CB twise is rationall, therefore also the parallelogramme MF is rationall, and it is applied vnto the rationall line ML. Wherefore the line MG is rationall and commensurable  in length to the line ML, that is, to the line DE (by the 20. of the tenth). Wherefore the line DM is incommensurable in length to the line MG, and they are both rationall.  Wherefore the lines DM and MG are rationall commensurable in power onely. Wherefore the whole line DG is a binomiall line.Concluded that DG is a binomiall line. Now resteth to proue that it is a second binomiall line. Forasmuch as the squares of the lines AC and CB are greater then that which is contayned vnder the lines AC and CB twise (by the Assumpt before the 60. of this booke): therefore the parallelogramme DL is greater then the parallelogrrmme MF. Wherefore also (by the first of the sixt) the line DM is greater then the line MG. And forasmuch as the square of  the line AC is commensurable to the square of the line CB, therefore the parallelogramme DH is commensurable to the parallelogramme KL. Wherefore also the line DK is commensurable  in length to the line KM. And that which is contayned vnder the lines DK and KM is equall to the square of the line MN, that is, to the fourth part of the square of the line MG. Wherefore (by the 17. of the tenth) the line DM is in power more then the line MG, by the square of a line commensurable in length vnto the line DM: and the line MG is commensurable in length to the rationall line put, namely, to DE. Wherefore the line DG is a second binomiall line: which was required to be proued.
            
            
               
               ¶ The 44. Theoreme. The 62. Proposition. The square of a second bimediall line, applied vnto a rationall line: maketh the breadth or other side therof, a third binomiall lyne.
               SVppose that AB be a second bimediall line, and let AB be supposed to be deuided into his partes in the point C, so that let AC be the greater part. And take a rationall line DE. And (by the 44. of the first) vnto the line DE apply the parallelogramme DF equall to the square of the line AB, and making in breadth the line DG. Then I say that the line DG is a third binomiall line. Let the selfe same constructions be in this that were in the propositions next going before. And forasmuch as the line AB is a second bimediall line,Construction. and is deuided

into his partes in the point C,Demonstration. therfore (by the 38. of the tenth) the lines AC and CB are medials commensurable in power only, comprehēding a mediall superficies. Wherfore † that which is made of the squares of the lines AC and CB added together, is mediall, and it is equall to the parallelogramme DL by construction. Wherefore the parallelogramme DL is mediall, and is applied vnto the rationall line DE, wherfore (by the 22. of the tenth) the line MD is rationall and incommensurable in length to the line DE. And by the lyke reason also * the line MG is rationall and incommensurable in length to the line ML, that is, to the line DE. Wherfore either of these lines DM and MG is rational, and incommensurable in length to the line DE. And forasmuch as the line AC is incommensurable in length to the line CB, but as the line AC is to the line CB, so (by the assumpt going before the 22. of the tenth) is the square of the line AC to that which is contained vnder the lines AC and CB. Wherfore the square of the line AC is inc
                     •
                  mmmensurable to that which is contayned vnder the lines AC and CB. Wherfore that ‡ that which is made of the squares of the lines AC and CB added together, is incommensurable to that which is contained vnder the lines AC and CB twise, that is, the parallelogramme DL to the parallelogramme MF. Wherfore (by the first of the sixt, and 10. of the tenth) the line DM is incommensurable in length to the line MG. And they are proued both rationall,DG, concluded a binomiall line. wherfore the whole line DG is a binomiall line by the definition in the 36. of the tenth. Now resteth to proue that it is a third binomiall line. As in the former propositions, so also in this may we conclude that the line DM is greater then the line MG, and that the line DK is commensurable in length to the line KM. And that that which is contained vnder the lines DK and KM is equall to the square of the line MN. Wherfore the line DM is in power more then the line MG by the square of a line commensurable in length vnto the line DM, and neither of the lines DM nor MG is commensurable in length to the rational line DE. Wherfore (by the definition of a third binomi

                  ll line) the line DG is a third binomiall line: which was required to be proued.

                  ¶A Corollary.
                  
                     A Corollary added by M. Dee.Hereby it is euident, that the squares made of the two partes of a second bimediall line, composed, is a compound mediall, and that the same compound is incommensurable to the parallelogramme contayned vnder the two partes of the second bimediall lyne.
                  
                     The proofe hereof, is in the first and third annotations here before annexed.
                  
               
            
            
               ¶ The 45. Theoreme. The 63. Proposition. The square of a greater line applied vnto a rationall line, maketh the breadth or other side a fourth binomiall line.
               SVppose that the line AB be a greater line, and let it be supposed to be deuided into his partes in the point C, so that let AC be the greater part. And take a rationall line DE. And (by the 44. of the first) vnto the line DE, apply the parallelogramme DF equall to the square of the line AB, and making in breadth the line DG. Then I say, that the line DG is a fourth binomiall line. Let the selfe same construction be in this, that was in the former Propositions.Construction. And forasmuch

as the line AB is a greater line, &amp; is deuided into his partes in the point C:Demonstration. therefore the lines AC and CB are incommensurable in power, hauing that which is made of the squares of them added together rationall, and the parallelogramme which is contayned vnder them, mediall. Now forasmuch as that which is made of the squares of the lines AC and CB added together is rationall, therefore the parallelogramme DL is rationall. Wherefore also the line MD is rationall and commensurable  in lēgth to the line DE (by the 20. of this tenth). Againe forasmuch as that which is cōtained vnder the lines AC and CB twise is mediall, that is, the parallelogrāme

MF, and it is applied vnto the rationall line ML, therefore (by the 
                     •
                  2. of the tenth) the  line MG is rationall and incommensurable in length to the line DE, Therefore (by the 13. of the tenth) the line DM is incommensurable in length to the line MG. Wherefore the lines DM and MG are rationall commensurable in power onely. Wherfore the whole  line DG is a binomiall line. Now resteth to proue, that it is also a fourth binomiall line. Euen as in the former Propositions, so also in this may we conclude, that the line DM is greater then the line MC. And that that which is contayned vnder the lines DK and KM is equall to the square of the line MN. Now forasmuch as the square of the line AC is incommensurable to the square of the line CB, therefore the parallelogramme DH is incommensurable to the parallelogramme KL. Wherefore (by the 1. of the sixt, and 10. of the tenth) the line DK is incommensurable in length to the line KM. But if there be two vnequall right lines, and if vpon the greater be applied a parallelogramme equall to the fourth part of the square made of the lesse, and wanting in figure  by a square, and if also the parallelogramme thus applied deuide the line wherupon it is applied into partes incommensurable in length, the greater line s

                  mensurable in length to DM. And the lines DM and MG are proued to be rationall cō
                  mensurable in power onely. And the line DM is commensurable in length to the rationall line geuen DE. Wherefore the line DG is a fourth binomiall line: which was required to be proued.
            
            
               ¶The 46. Theoreme. The 64. Proposition. The square of a line contayning in power a rationall and a mediall superficies applied to a rationall line, maketh the breadth or other side a fift binomiall line.

And (by the 44. of the first) vnto the line DE apply the parallelogramme DF equall to the square of the line AB, and making in breadth

the line DG. Then I say, that the line DG is a fift binomiall line.Construction. Let the selfe same cōstruction be in this, that was in the former. And forasmuch as AB is a line contayning in power a rationall and a mediall superficies,Demonstration. and is deuided into his partes in the poynt C, therefore the lines AC &amp; CB are incōmensurable in power, hauing that which is made of the squares of thē added together mediall, and that which is contayned vnder then rationall. Now forasmuch as that which is made of the squares of the lines AC and CB added together is mediall, therefore also the parallelogramme DL is mediall. Wherefore (by the 22. of the tenth) the line DM is rationall and incommensurable in length to the line DE. Againe forasmuch as  that which is contayned vnder the lines AC and CB twise, that is, the parallelogramme MF, is rationall, therefore by the 20. the line MG is rationall &amp; cōmensurable in length 
                  
to the line DE. Wherefore (by the 13. of the tenth) the line DM is incommensurable in  length to the line MG. Wherefore the lines DM and MG are rationall commensurable in power onely. Wherefore the whole line DG is a binomiall line. I say moreouer, that it is a fift binomiall. For, as in the former, so also

in this may it be proued, that that which is contayned vnder the lines DK and KM is equall to the square of MN the halfe of the lesse: and that the line DK is incommensurable in length to the line KM. Wherefore (by the 18. of the tenth) the line DM is in power more thē the line MG by the square of a line incommensurable in length to the line DM. And the lines DM and MG are rationall commensurable in power onely, and the lesse line, namely, MG is commensurable in length to the rationall line geuen DE. Wherefore the line DG is a fift binomiall line: which was required to be demonstrated.
            
            
               ¶The 47. Theoreme. The 65. Proposition. The square of a line contayning in power two medialls applyed vnto a rationall line, maketh the breadth or other side a sixt binomiall line.
               SVppose that the line AB be a line contayning in power two medialls, and let it be supposed to be deuided into his partes in the poynt C. And take a rationall line DE. And (by the 44. of the first) vnto the rationall line DE apply the parallelogrāme DF equall to the square of the line AB and making in breadth the line DG. Then I say that the line DG is a sixt binomiall line.Construction.
                  
Let the selfe same construction be in thys that was in the former. And forasmuch as the line AB is a line contayning in power two medialls,Demonstration. and is diuided into his partes in the poynt C, therefore the lines AC &amp; CB are incommensurable in power hauing that which is made of the squares of them added together mediall, and that which is contayned vnder them, mediall, and moreouer incommensurable to that which is made of the squares of them added together. Wherefore by those thinges which haue bene before proued, either of these parallelogrāmes DL and MF is mediall, and either of them is applyed vpon the rationall line DE. Wherefore (by the 22. of the tenth) either of these lines DM and MG is rationall  and incommensurable in length to the line DE. And forasmuch as

Wherefore (by the 1. of the sixt and 10. of the tenth) the line DM is incommensurable in length to the line MG. Wherefore the lines 
                  DM and MG are rationall commensurable in power onely. Wherefore the whole line DG

               SVppose that the line AB be a binomiall line,The sixt Senary. and vnto the line AB let the line CD be commensurable in length. Then I say that the line CD is a binomiall line and of the selfe same order that the line AB is. For forasmuch as AB is

                     E is to the line EB, so is the line CF to the line FD. But the lines AE and EB are commensurable in power onely, wherefore the lines CF and FD are also commensurable in power onely, and they are rationall. Wherefore the whole line CD is a binomiall line. I say also that it is of the selfe same order of binomiall lines that the line AB is. For the line AE is in power more then the line EB either by the square of a line commensurable in length to the line AE, or by the square of a line incommensurable in length to the line AE. If the line AE be in power more then the line EB by the square of a line commensurable in length to the line AE, the line also CF, by the 14. of the tenth) shalbe in power more then the line FD by the square of a line commensurable in length to CF. And if the line

                  AE be commensurable in length to a rationall line geuen, the line CF also shalbe commensurable in length to the same (by the 12. of the tenth). And so either of these lines AB and CD is a first binomiall line, that  is, they are both of one and the selfe same order. But if the line EB be commensurable in length to the rationall line put, the line FD also shalbe commensurable in length to the same. And by that meanes agayne the lines AB and CD are both of one and the selfe same order
                     •
                   for either of them is a second binomiall line. But if neither of the lines AE nor E

                   be commensurable  in length to the rationall line put, neither also of these lines CF nor FD shalbe commensurable in length to the same. And so neither of the lines AB and CD is a third binomiall  line. But if the line AE be in power more then the line EB by the square of a line incommensurable in length to the line AE, the line also CF shalbe in power more then the line FD by the square of a line incommensurable in length to the line CF, (by the 14. of

the tenth). And then if the line AE be commensurable in length to the rationall line put the line CF also shalbe commensurable in length to the same, and so either of the lines AB, 
                   and CD shalbe a fourth binomiall line. And if the line EB be commensurable in length to the rationall line geuen, the line FD also shalbe commensurable in length to the same. And  so either of the lines AB and CD shalbe a fift binomiall line. But if neither of the lines AE nor EB be commensurable in length to the rationall line geuen, neither also of the lines CF nor FD shalbe commensurable in length to the same, and so either of the lines AB and 
                  CD shalbe a sixt binomiall line. A line, therefore commensurable in length to a binomiall line, is also a binomiall line of the selfe same order: which was required to be proued.
            
            
               ¶The 49. Theoreme. The 67. Proposition. A line commensurable in length to a bimediall line, is also a bimediall lyne and of the selfe same order.
               SVppose that the line AB be a bimediall line, And vnto the line AB, let the lyne CD be commensurable in length. Then I say that the line CD is a bimediall line, and of the self order that the line AB is. Deuide the line AB into his partes in the point E.Construction. And forasmuch as the line AB is a bimediall line, and is deuided into his partes in the point E, therfore (by the 37. and 38. of the tenth) the lines AE and EB are medials commensurable in power onely, And (by the 12. of the sixt) as the line AB is to the line CD, so let the line AE be to the line CF.

Wherfore (by the 19. of the fift) the residue,Demonstration. namely, the line EB is to the residue, namely, to the line FD, as the line AB is to the line CD. But the line AB is commensurable in length to the lyne CD. Wherfore the line AE is commensurable in length to the line CF, and the line EB to the line FD. Now the lines AE and EB are mediall, wherfore (by the 23. of the tenth) the lines CF and FD are also mediall. And for that as the line AE is to the line EB, so is the line CF to the line FD. But the lines AE and EB are commensurable in power onely, wherfore the lines CF and FD are also commensurable in power onely. And it is proued that they are mediall. Wherfore the lyne CD is a bimediall  line. I say also that it is of the selfe same order that the line AB is. For, for that as the line AE is to the line EB, so is the line CF to the line FD, but as the line CF is to FD, so is the square of the lyne CF to the parallelogramme contained vnder the lynes CF and FD, by the first of the sixt. Therfore as the line AE is to the line EB, so (by the 11. of the fift) is the square of the line CF to the parallelogramme contained vnder the lines CF and FD: but as AE is to EB, so by the 1. of the sixt, is the square of the line AE, to the parallelogramme contained vnder the lines AE and EB, therfore (by the 11. of the fift) as the square of the line AE is to that which is contained vnder the lines AE and EB, so is the square of the line CF to that which is contained vnder the lines CF and FD. Wherfore alternately (by the 16. of the fift) as the square of the line AE is to the square of the line CF, so is that which is contained vnder the lines AE and EB to that which is contained vnder the lines CF &amp; FD. But the square of the line AE is commensurable to the square of the line CF, because AE and CF are commensurable in length. Wherfore that which is contained vnder the lines AE and EB in commensurable to that which is contained vnder the lines CF and FD. If therfore that which is contained vnder the lines AE and EB be rationall, that is, if the line

AB be a first bimediall line, that also which is contained vnder the lines CF and FD is rationall. Wherfore also the line CD is a first bimediall line. But if that which is contained vnder  the lines AE and EB be mediall, that is, if the line AB be a second bimediall line, that also which is contayned vnder the lines CF and FD is mediall: wherfore also the line CD is a second bimediall line. Wherfore the lines AB and CD are both of one and the selfe same order: which was required to be proued.

                     A line commensurable in power onely to a bimediall line, is also a bimediall line, and of the selfe same order.
                  
                  Suppose that AB be a bimediall line, either a first or a second, wherunto let the line GD be cōmensurable in power onely.

                      Take also a rationall line EZ, vpon which (by the 45. of the first) apply a rectangle parallelogramme equall to the square of the line AB, which let be EZFC, and let the rectangle parallelogramme CFIH be equall to the square of the line GD. And forasmuch as vpon the rationall line EZ is applyed a rectangle parallelogramme EF

equall to the square of a first bimediall line, therefore the other side therof, namely, EC, is a second binomiall line, by the 61. of this booke. And forasmuch as by supposition the squares of the lines AB &amp; GD are commensurable, therefore the parallelogrammes EF and CI (which are equall vnto them) are also commensurable. And therefore by the 1. of the sixt, the lines EC and CH are commensurable in length. But the line EC is a second binomiall line. Wherefore the line CH is also a second binomiall line, by the 66. of this booke. And forasmuch as the superficies CI is contayned vnder a rationall line EZ or CF, and a second binomiall line CH, therefore the line which contayneth it in power, namely, the line GD is a first bimediall line, by the 55. of this booke. And so is the line GD in the selfe same order of bimediall lines that the line AB is. The like demonstration also will serue if the line AB be supposed to b
                        •
                      a second bimediall line. For so shall it make the breadth EC a third binomiall line whereunto the line CH shall be commensurable in length, and therefore CH also shall be a third binomiall line, by meanes whereof the line which contayneth in power the superficies CI, namely, the line GD shall also be a second bimediall line. Wherefore a line commensurable either in length, or in power onely to a bimediall line, is also a bimediall line of the selfe same order.
                  But so is it not of necessitie in binomiall lines, for if their powers onely be commensurable, it followeth not of necessitie that they are binomialls of one and the selfe same order,
                        Note.
                      but they are eche binomialls eyther of the three first kindes, or of the three last. As for example. Suppose that AB be a first binomiall line, whose greater name let be AG, and vnto AB let the DZ be cōmēsurable in power onely. Then I say, that the line DZ is not of the selfe

same order that the line AB is. For if it be possible, let the line DZ be of the selfe same order that the line AB is. Whe

                      let it be so deuided in the poynt E. Wherefore it can not be so deuided in any other poynt, by the 42

                      to the line DZ, as the line AG is to the line DE, but the lines AG &amp; DE, namely, the greater names, are commensurable in length the one to the other (by the 10. of this booke) for that they are commensurable in length to 
                        〈◊〉
                      and the selfe same rationall line, by the first definition of binomiall lines. Wherefore the lines AB and DZ are commensurable in length, by the 13. of this booke. But by supposition they are commensurable in power onely: which is impossible.
                  
                     The selfe same demonstration also will serue, if we suppose the line AB to be a second binomial line: for the lesse names GB and EZ being commensurable in length to one and the selfe same rationall line, shall also be commensurable in length the one to the other. And therefore the lines AB and DZ which are in the selfe same proportion with them, shall also be commensurable in length the one to the other: which is contrary to the supposition. Farther, if the squares of the lines AB and DZ be applyed vnto the rationall line CF, namely, the parallelogrammes CT and HL, they shall make the breadthes CH and HK first binomiall lines, of what order soeuer the lines AB &amp; DZ (whose squares were applyed vnto the rational line) are, (by the 60. of this

booke). Wherefore it is manifest, that vnder a rationall line and a first binomiall line, are confusedly contayned all the powers of binomiall lines (by the 54. of this booke). Wherfore the onely commensuration of the powers doth not of necessitie bryng forth one and the selfe same order of binomiall lines. The selfe same thyng also may be proued, if the lines AB and DZ be supposed to be a fourth or fifth binomiall line, whose powers onely are conmmensurable, namely, that they shall as the first bring forth binomiall lines of diuers orders. Now forasmuch as the powers of the lines AG and GB, and DE and EZ are commensurable &amp; proportionall, it is manifest, that if the line AG be in power more then the line GB by the square of a line commensurable in length vnto AG, the line DE also shall be in power more then the line EZ by the square of a line commensurable in length vnto the line DE (by the 16. of this booke). And so shall the two lines AB and DZ be eche, of the three first binomiall lines. But if the line AG be in power more then the line GB by the square of a line incommensurable in length vnto the line AG, the line DE shall also be in pow

Wherefore (by the 22. of the sixt) as the square of the line AB is to the square of the line EB, so is the square of the line CD to the square of the line FD.

Wherfore (by the 11. of the fift) as the square of the lyne AB is to the squares of the lines AE and EB, so is the square of the line CD to the squares of the lines CF and FD. Wherfore alternately (by the 16. of the fift) as the square of the line AB

is to the square of the line CD, so are the squares of the lines AE and EB to the squares of the lines CF and FD. But the square of the line AB is commensurable to the square of the line CD (for the line AB is commensurable to the line CD by suppositiō). Wherfore also the squares of the lines AE and EB are commensurable to the squares of the lines CF and FD. But the squares of the lines AE and EB are incommensurable, and being added together are rationall. Wherfore the squares of the lines CF and FD are incommensurable, &amp; being added together, are also rationall. And in like sort may we proue that that which is contained vnder the lines AE and EB twise is commensurable to that which is contained vnder the lines CF and FD twise. But that which is contained vnder the lines AE and EB twise, is mediall, wherfore also that which is contained vnder the lines CF and FD twise is medial. Wherfore the lines CF and FD are incommensurable in power, hauing that which is made of the squares of them added together rationall, and that which is contained vnder thē mediall. Wherfore (by the 39. of the tenth) the whole line CD is irrationall, &amp; is called a greater line. A line therfore commensurable to a greater line, is also a greater line.

But before, namely, in the 68.

                     First case.
                   and take a rationall line EF. And (by the 44. of the first) vnto the line EF apply the parallelogramme EG equal to the superficies AB, &amp; making

in breadth the line EH, and to the same line EF, that is, to the line HG apply the parallelogramme HI equall to the superficies DC, and makyng in breadth the line HK.Demonstration. And forasmuch as the superficies AB is rationall, and is equall to the parallelogramme EG, therfore the parallelogramme EG is also rational, and it is applied vnto the rational line EF, making in breadth the line EH. Wherfore the line EH is rationall and commensurable in length to the line EF (by the 20. of the tenth). Againe forasmuch as the superficies CD is mediall, and is equal

to the parallelogrāme HI, therfore the parallelogrāme HI is also mediall, and is applied vnto the rationall line EF, that is, vnto the lyne HG making in breadth the line HK. Wherfore the lyne HK is rationall and incommensurable in length to the line EF (by the 2
                     •
                   of the tenth.) And forasmuch as the superficies CD is mediall, and the superficies AB is rationall, therfore the superficies AB is incommensurable to the superficies CD. Wherfore also the parallelogramme EG is incommensurable to the parallelogramme HI. But as the parallelogramme GE is to the parallelogramme HI, so (by the 1. of the sixt) is the line EH to the lyne HK. Wherfore (by the 10. of the tenth) the line EH is incommensurable in length to the line HK, and they are both rationall. Wherfore the lines EH and HK are rationall commensurable in power onely. Wherfore the whole line EK is a binomiall line, and is deuided into his names in the poynt H. And forasmuch as the super

                  icies AB is greater then the superficies CD, but the superficies AB is equall to the parallelogramme EG, and the superficies CD to the parallelogramme HI. Wherfore the parallelogramme EG is greater then the parallelogramme HI. Wherfore the line EH is greater then the line HK. Wherfore the line EH is in power more then the line HK either by the square of a line commensurable in length to the lyne EH, or by the square of a lyne incommensurable in length to the lyne EH.First part of the first case. First let it be in power more by the square of a lyne cōmēsurable in lēgth vnto the line EH. Now the greater name, namely, EH is commensurable in length to the rational line geuen EF, as it hath already bene proued. Wherfore the whole line

EK is a first binomiall lyne. And the lyne EF is a rationall lyne. But if a superficies be contayned vnder a rationall line, and a first binomiall lyne, the lyne that contayneth in power the same superficies, is (by the 54. of the tenth) a binomiall line. Wherefore the lyne containing in power the parallelogramme EI is a binomiall line. Wherefore also the line containing in power the superficies AD is a binomiall line.
               But now let the lyne EH be in power more then the line HK by the square of a line incommensurable in length to the line EH:Second part of the first case. now the greater name that is, EH is commensurable in length to the rationall line geuen EF. Wherfore the line EK is afourth binomiall line. And the line EF is rationall. But if a superficies be contained vnder a rationall line and afourth binomiall line, the line that containeth in power the same superficies is (by the 57. of the tenth) irrational, and is a greater line. Wherfore the line which containeth in power the parallelogramme EI is a greater line. Wherefore also the line containing in power the superficies AD is a greater lyne.
               
                  The second case.But now suppose that the superficies AB which is rationall, be lesse then the superficies CD which is mediall. Wherfore also the parallelogramme EG is lesse then the parallelogrāme HI. Wherfore also the line EH is lesse then the line HK. Now the line HK is in power more then the lyne EH either by the square of a line cōmensurable in length to the line HK, or by the square of a lyne incommensurable in length vnto the lyne HK. First let it be in power more by the square of a line commensurable in length vnto HK:First part of the secōd case. now the lesse name, that is EH is commensurable in length to the rationall line geuen EF, as it was before proued. Wherfore the whole line EK is a second binomiall line. And the line EF is a rationall line. But if a superficies be contained vnder a rationall line and a second binomiall lyne, the lyne that contayneth in power the same superficies, is (by the 55. of the tenth) a first bimediall line. Wherfore the line which contayneth in power the parallelograme EI is a first bimediall line. Wherfore also the line that containeth in power the superficies AD is a first bimediall lyne.
               
                  Second part of the secōd case.But now let the line HK be in power more then the line EH, by the square of a line incōmensurable

in length to the lyne HK, now the lesse name, that is, EH is cōmensurable in length to the rationall lyne geuen EF. Wherfore the whole line EK is a fift binomiall lyne. And the lyne EF is rationall. But if a superficies be contayned vnder a rationall lyne, and a fift binomiall lyne, the line that contayneth in power the same superficies, is (by the 58. of the tenth) a line containing in power a rationall and a mediall. Wherefore the lyne that contayneth in power the parallelogramme EI is a line contayning in power a rationall and a mediall. Wherfore also the lyne that containeth in power the superficies AD is a lyne contayning in power a rationall and a mediall. If therfore a rationall and a mediall superficies be added together, the lyne which contayneth in power the whole superficies, is one of these foure irrationall lines, namely, either a binomiall line, or a first bimediall line, or a greater lyne, or a lyne contayning in power a rationall and a mediall: which was required to be demonstrated.
            
            
               ¶ The 54. Theoreme. The 72. Proposition. If two mediall superficieces incommensurable the one to the other be composed together: the line contayning in power the whole superficies is one of the two irrationall lines remayning, namely, either a second bimediall line, or a line contayning in power two medialls.
               LEt these two mediall superficieces AB and CD being incommensurable the one to the other be added together. Then I say, that the line which contayneth in power the superficies AD is either a second bimediall line, or a line contayning in power two medialls.Construction. For the superficies AB is either greater or lesse then the superficies CD (for they can by no meanes be equall, when as they are incommensurable).
                     Two cases in this Proposition.
                     The first case.
                   First let the superficies AB be greater then

the superficies CD. And take a rationall line EF. And (by the 44. of the first) vnto the line EF apply the parallelogramme EG equall to the superficies AB, and making in breadth the line EH: and vnto the same line EF, that is, to the line HG, apply the parallelogramme HI equall to the superficies CD, &amp; making in breadth the line HK. And forasmuch as either of these superficieces AB &amp; CD is mediall, therefore also either of these parallelogrammes EG and HI is mediall. And they are eche applied to the rationall line EF, making in breadth the lines EH and HK. Wherefore (by the 22. of the tenth) either of these lines EH and HK is rationall and incommensurable in length to the line EF. And forasmuch as the superficies AB is incommensurable to the superficies CD, and the superficies AB is equall to the parallelogramme E
                     •
                  , and the superficies CD to the parallelogramme HI: therefore the parallelogramme EG is incommensurable to the parallelogramme HI. But (by the 1. of the sixt) as the parallelogramme EG is to the parallelogramme HI, so is the line EH

                  nd HK are rationall commensurable in power onely. Wherfore the whole line EK is a binomiall line. And as in the former Proposition so als
                     •
                   in this may it be proued, that the line EH is greater then the line HK. Wherefore the line EH is in power more then the line HK, either by the square of a line commensurable in length to the line EH, or by the square of a line incommensurable in length to the line EH. First let it be greater by the square of a line commensurable in length vnto the line EH.The first part of the first case. Now neither of these lines EH and HK is commensurable in length to the rationall line geuen EF. Wherefore the whole line EK is a third binomiall

But if a superficies be contayned vnder a rationall line &amp; a third binomiall line, the line that cōtaineth in power the same superficies, is (by the 56. of the tenth) a second bimediall line. Wherefore the line that containeth in power the superficies EI, that is, the superficies AD, is a second bimediall line.

And forasmuch as either of these lines EH and HK is incommensurable in length to the rationall line geuen EF, therfore the line EK is a sixt binomiall line. But if a superficies be contained vnder a rationall line and a sixt binomiall line, the line that containeth in power the same superficies, is (by the 59. of the tenth) a line containing in power two medialls. Wherefore

the line that containeth in power the superficies AD, is a line contayning in power two medialls.The second case. And after the selfe same maner, if the superficies AB be lesse then the superficies CD, may we proue, that the line that contayneth in power the superficies AD, is either a second bimediall line, or a line containing in power two medialls. If therefore two mediall superficieces incommensurable the one to the other be added together, the line contayning in power the whole superficies is one of the two irrationall lines remayning, namely, either a second bimediall line, or a line cōtaining in power two medialls: which was required to be proued.
               
                  ¶ A Corollary following of the former Propositions.
                  A binomiall line and the other irrationall lines following it, are neither mediall lines, nor one and the same betwene them selues. For the square of a mediall line applied to a rationall line,A Corollary maketh the breadth rationall and incommensurale in length to the rationall line, wherunto it is applied (by the 22. of the tenth). The square of a binomiall line applyed to 
                        •
                      rationall line, maketh the breadth a first binomiall line (by the 60. of the tenth). The square of a first bimediall line applied vnto a rationall line, maketh the breadth a second binomiall line (by the 61. of the tenth). The square of a second bimediall line applied vnto a rationall line, maketh the breadth a third binomiall line (by the 62. of the tenth). The square of a greater line applied to a rationall line, maketh the breadth a fourth binomiall line (by the 63. of the tenth). The square of a line containing in power a rationall &amp; a mediall superficies, maketh the breadth a fift binomiall line (by the 64. of the tenth). And the square of a line containing in power two medialls, applied vnto a rationall line, maketh the breadth a sixt binomiall line (by the 65. of the tenth). Seing therefore that these foresaid breadthes differ both from the first breadth, for that it is rationall, and differ also the one from the other, for that they are binomials of diuers orders: it is manifest that those irrationall lines differ also the one from the other.

But vnto the square of the line AB are commensurable the squares of the lines AB and BC (by the 15. of the tenth). Wherefore the squares of the lines AB and BC are incommensurable to that which is contayned vnder the lines AB and BC. But vnto that which is contayned vnder the lines AB and BC is commensurable that which is contayned vnder the lines AB and BC twise. Wherefore the squares of the lines AB and BC are incōmēsurable to that which is contayned vnder the lines AB and BC twise. But the squares of the lines AB and BC are equall to that which is contayned vnder the lines AB and BC twise, and to the square of the line AC (by the 7. of the second). Wherefore that which is contayned vnder the lines AB and BC twise together with the square of the line AC is incommensurable to that which is cōtayned vnder the lines AB and BC twise. Wherefore (by the 2 part of the 16. of the tēth) that which is cōtayned vnder the lines AB and BC twise, is incōmēsurable to the square of the line AC. Wherefore (by the first part of the same) that which is contayned vnder the lines AB and BC twise together with the square of the line AC, that is, the squares of the lines AB and BC are incommensurable to the square of the line AC.

from the line AB take away a mediall line BC commensurable in power onely to the whole line AB and comprehending together with the line AB a rationall superficies, that is, let that which is comprehended vnder the lines AB and BC be rationall.

Wherefore that which is composed of the squares of the lines AB and BC, that is, that which is contayned vnder AB and BC twise together with the square of the line AC is incommensurable to that which is contained vnder the lines AB and BC twise. Wherefore (by the second part the 16. of the tenth) that which is contayned vnder the lines AB and BC twise is incommensurable to the square of the line AC. But that which is contayned vnder the lines AB and BC twise it rationall, wherefore the square of the line AC is irrationall. Wherefore also the line AC is irrationall

say that the residue, namely; the line AC is irrationall, and is called a second mediall residuall line. Take a rationall line DI, and (by the 44. of the first) vnto the line DI apply the parallelogramme DE equall to the squares of the lines AB &amp; BC, and making in bredth the line DG.Demonstration. And vnto the same line DI apply the parallelogramme DH equall to that which is cōtained vnder the lines AB &amp; BC twise, and makyng in breadth the line DF. Now the parallelogramme DH is lesse then the parallelogramme DE, for that also the square of the lines AB and BC are greater then that which is contained vnder the lines AB and BC twise, by the square of the line AC by the 7. of the second. Wherfore the parallelogramme remayning, namely, FE, is equal to the square of the line AC. And forasmuch as the squares of the lines AB and BC are mediall, therfore also the parallelogramme DE is mediall, and is applied to the rationall line DI, making in bredth the line DG. Wherfore (by the 22. of the tenth) the line DG is rational and incommensurable in length to the line DI. Againe forasmuch as that which is contained vnder the lines AB and BC is mediall, therfore also that which is contained vnder the lines AB and BC twise is mediall, but that which is contained vnder the lines AB and BC twise is equall to the parallelogramme DH. Wherfore the parallelogramme DH is mediall and is applied to the rationall line DI making in breadth the line DF. Wherfore the line DF is rationall and incommensurable in length to the line DI. And forasmuch as the lines AB and BC are cōmensurable in power onely, therfore the line AB is incommēsurable in lēgth to the line BC. Wherfore (by the assumpt going before the 22. of the tenth, and by the 10. of the tenth) the square of the line AB is incommensurable to that which is contained vnder the lines AB and BC. But vnto the square of the line AB are commensurable the squares of AB and BC (by the 15. of the tenth) And vnto that which is contained vnder the lines

AB and BC is commēsurable to that which is contained vnder the lines AB and BC twise.

But vnto the squares of the lines AB and BC is equal the parallelogrāme DE, and to that which is cōtained vnder the lines AB and BC twise, is equall the parallelogramme DH.

               SVppose that AB be a right line, and from the right line AB take away a right line BC incommensurable in power to the whole line, namely, to AB, and let that which is composed of the squares of the lines AB and BC be rationall, and let the parallelogramme contayned vnder the same lines AB and BC be mediall. Then I say, that the line remayning, namely, the

line AC is irrationall, &amp; is called a lesse line. For forasmuch as that which is cōposed of the squares of the lines AB and BC is rationall,Demonstration. and that which is contayned vnder the lines AB and BC twise is mediall, therefore that which is composed of the squares of the lines AB and BC is incommensurable to that which is contained vnder the lines AB and BC twise. Wherefore the squares of the lines AB and BC, are incōmensurable to the square of AC, as it was said in the 73. Proposition. But that which is made of the squares of the lines AB and BC is rationall. Wherefore the square of the line AC is irrationall: wherefore also the line AC is irrationall: and is called a lesse line. And is therefore so called, for that it is that portiō of the greater part of a greater line, which remaineth after the taking away of the lesse part frō the greater: which was required to be proued.
               
                  In thys Proposition is contayned the definition of the eleuenth kinde of irrationall lines, which is called a lesse line, whose definition is thus.

Wherefore (by the 16. of the tenth) the residue, namely, the square of the line AC is incommensurable to that which is contained vnder the lines AB and BC twise.

For the squares of the lines AB and BC, are equall to that which is contained vnder the lines AB and BC twise, and to the square of the line AC (by the 7. of the second).

And (by the 44. of the first) vnto the line DI apply the parallelogramme DE equall to that which is made of the squares of the lines AB and BC added together,Construction. and making in breadth the line DG. And vnto the same line DI apply the parallelogramme DH equall to that which is contayned vnder the lines AB and BC twise and making in breadth the line DF. Wherefore the parallelogramme remayning, namely the parallelogramme FE, is equall to the square of the line AC. Wherefore the line AC contayneth in power the parallelograme FE.
                  Demonstration. And forasmuch as that which is made of the squares of the lines AB and BC added together is mediall, and is equall to the parallelogramme DE, therefore also the parallelogramme DE is mediall. And the parallelogramme DE is applyed to the rationall line DI making in breadth the line DG. Wherfore (by the 22. of the tenth) the line DG is rationall and incommensurable in length to the line DI. Agayne forasmuch as that which is contayned vnder the lines AB and BC twise is mediall and is equall to the parallelogramme DH, therefore the parallelogramme DH is mediall. And the parallelograme DH is applyed vnto the rationall line DI making in breadth the line DF, wherefore the line DF is rationall and incommensurable in length to the line DI.

And they are both rationall lines. Wherefore the lines DG and DF are rationall commensurable in power onely, where

But the line CA contayneth in power the parallelogramme FE. Wherefore the line AC is irrationall and is called a line making with a mediall superficies the whole superficies mediall. And is therfore so called, for that that which is made of the squares of the lines AB and BC added together is mediall, &amp; is a certayne whole superficies, part whereof is that which is cōtayned vnder the lines AB and BC, which is also mediall: you shall also by the 110. proposition of this booke vnderstand an other cause why it is so called.
               
                  This proposition may thus more briefely be demonstrated: forasmuch as that which is composed of the squares of the lines AB and BC is mediall, and that also which is contayned vnder them is mediall, therefore the parallelogramm

Wherfore that which is contained vnder the lines AD and DB twise, excedeth that which is contained vnder the lines AC and CB twise by a rationall superficies: which (by the 26. of the tenth) is impossible, for either of them is mediall by supposition. Wherfore vnto a lesse line can be ioyned onely one right line incommensurable in power to the whole line, and making together with the whole line that which is made of their squares added together rationall, and that which is contained vnder them mediall: which was required to be demonstrated.

Wherefore the line EM is incommensurable in length to the line MH, and they are both rationall. Wherefore the lines EM and MH are rationall commensurable in power onely, Wherefore EH is a residuall line. And the line ioyned vnto it is HM.

For forasmuch as the parallelogramme EK is rationall, and is equall to the parallelogramme MN, that is, LX, therefore LX, that is, the parallelogramme contained vnder the lines LO and ON is rationall. But the square NX is mediall, for it is already proued that the parallelogramme FK which is equall to the square NX, is mediall. Wherefore the parallelogramme LX is incommensurable to the square NX. But as the parallelogramme LX is to the square NX, so is the line LO to the line ON (by the 1. of the sixt). Wherefore (by the 10. of the tenth) the lines LO and ON are incommensurable in length. And it is already proued, that they are mediall commensurable in power. Wherefore the lines LO &amp; ON are mediall commensurable in power onely containing a rationall superficies.

Wherefore the squares LM and NX are about one and the selfe same diameter. Let their diameter be OR, and describe the figure. And forasmuch as the parallelograme contained vnder the lines AF and FG is equall to the square of the line EG, therfore proportionally as the line AF is to the line EG, so is the line EG to the line FG, but as the line AF is to the line EG, so is the parallelogramme AI to the parallelogramme EK (by the 1. of the sixt) And as the line EG is to the line FG, so is the parallelogramme EK to the parallelogramme FK.

I say moreouer that LN is that irrationall line which is called a lesse line. For forasmuch as the parallelogramme AK is rationall, and is equall to the squares of the lines LO and ON, therfore that which is made of the squares of the lines LO and ON added together is rationall. Againe forasmuch as the parallelogramme DK is mediall, and is equall to that which is contained vnder the lines LO and ON twise, therefore that which is contained vnder the lynes LO and ON twise, is also mediall. And forasmuch as the parallelogramme AI is incommensurable to the parallelogramme FK, therefore the squares which are equall vnto them, namely, the squares of the lines LO and ON are incommensurable the one to the other. Wherfore the lines LO and ON are incommensurable in power, hauyng that which is made of their squares added together rationall, and that which is contained vnder them twise mediall, which is commensurable to that which is contayned vnder them once. Wherfore that which is contained vnder them once is also mediall. Wherfore LN is that irrationall line which is called a lesse line, and it containeth in power the superficies AB.

                   line CF is a mediall line, and the line DF is also a mediall line, for that it is commensurable to the mediall line BE. And in like sort the lines CF and DF are commensurable in power onely: for that they haue the selfe same proportiō the one to the other, that the lines AE and EB haue, which are commensurable in power onely. Wherefore the line CD is a mediall residuall line.CD proued a mediall. I say moreouer that it is of the selfe same order that the line AB is. For for that as the line AE is to the line BE, so is the line CF to the line DF. But as the line AE is to the line BE, so is the square of the line AE to the parallelogramme contayned vnder the lines AE and BE (by the first of the sixth): and as the line CF is to the line DF, so is the square of the line CF to the parallelogramme contayned vnder the lines CF and DF. Wherefore as the square of the line AE is to the parallelogramme contayned vnder the lines AE and BE, so is the square of the line CF to the parallelogramme contayned vnder the lines CF and DF. Wherefore alternately as the square of the line AE is to the square of the line CF, so is the parallelogramme contayned vnder the lines AE and BE, to the parallelogramme contained vnder the 
                     •
                  ines CF and DF. But the square of the line AE is commensurable to the square of the line CF (for the line AE is commensurable to the line CF). Wherefore also the parallelogramme contayned vnder the lines AE and BE, is commensurable to the parallelogramme contayned vnder the lines CF and DF. Wherefore if the parallelogramme contayned vnder the lines AE and EB be rationall, the parallelogramme also contayned vnder the lines CF and FD shall be rationall. And then either of the lines AB and CD is a first mediall residuall line. But if the parallelogramme contayned vnder  the lines AE and BE be mediall, the parallelogramme also contayned vnder the lines CF and FD shall be also mediall (by the corollary of the 23. of the tēth): and so either of the lines AB and CD is a second mediall residuall line. Wherefore the line CD is a mediall residuall  line of the selfe same order that the line AB is. A line therefore commensurable to a mediall residuall line, is it selfe also a mediall residuall line of the selfe same order: which was required to be demonstrated-
               
                  This Theoreme is vnderstanded generally, that whether a line be commensurable in length &amp; in power, or in power onely to a mediall residuall line, it is it selfe also a mediall residuall line, and of the selfe same order, which thing also is to be vnderstanded of the three Theoremes which follow.

For let the same construction be in this, that was in the former Propositions.Demonstration. And forasmuch as the lines AE and EB are incommensurable in power, therefore (by the 22.

of the sixt, and 10. of the tenth) the lines CF &amp; FD are incommensurable in power. Againe (by the 22. of the sixt) as the square of the line AE is to the square of the line BE, so is the square of the line CF to the square of the line DF. Wherfore by cōposition as the squares of the lines AE and BE are to the square of the line BE, so are the squares of the lines CF and DF, to the square of the line DF: and alternately, as the squares of the lines AE and BE are to the squares of the lines CF and DF, so is the square of the line BE to the square of the line DF. But the square of the line BE is commensurable to the square of the line DF (for the lines BE and DF are commensurable). Wherefore that which is made of the squares of the lines AE and BE added together, is commensurable to that which is made of the squares of the lines CF and DF added together. But that which is made of the squares of the lines AE and BE added together, is rationall. Wherefore that which is made of the squares of the lines CF and DF added together, is also rationall. Againe, for that as the square of the line AE is to the parallelogramme contained vnder the lines AE and BE, so is the square of the line CF to the parallelogramme contained vnder the lines CF and DF (as we declared in the Proposition next going before): therefore alternately, as the square of the line AE is to the square of the line CF, so is the parallelogramme contained vnder the lines AE and BE, to the parallelogramme contained vnder the lines CF and DF. But the square of the line AE is commensurable to the square of the line CF, for the lines AE &amp; CF are commensurable. Wherefore the parallelogramme contained vnder the lines AE and BE, is commensurable to the parallelogramme contained vnder the lines CF and DF. But the parallelogramme contained vnder the lines AE and BE is mediall. Wherefore the parallelogramme contained vnder the lines CF and DF is also mediall. Wherefore the lines CF and DF are incommensurable in power, hauing that which is made of their squares added together rationall, and the parallelogramme contained vnder them mediall. Wherefore the line CD is a lesse line. A line therefore commensurable to a lesse line, is it selfe also a lesse line: which was required to be proued.
               
                  An other demonstration.
                  Suppose that A be a lesse line, and vnto A let the line B be commensurable whether in length and power, or in power onely. Then I say that B is a lesse line. Take a rationall line CD.Construction. And vnto the line CD apply (by the 44 of the first) the parallelogramme CE equall to the square of the line A, and making in bredth the line CF. Wherefore (by the 100. proposition)

the line CF is a fourth residuall line. Vnto the line FE apply

(by the same) the parallelogramme EH equall to the square of the line B, and making in breadth the line FH. Now forasmuch as the line A is commensurable to the line B,Demonstration. therefore also the square of the line A is cōmensurable to the square of the line B. But vnto the square of the line A is equall the parallelogramme CE, &amp; vnto the square of the line B is equal the parallelogramme EH. Wherfore the parallelogramme CE is commensurable to the parallelogramme EH. But as the parallelogramme CE is to the parallelogramme EH, so is the line CF to the line FH. Wherfore the line CF is commensurable in length to the line FH. But the line CF is a fourth residuall line. Wherfore the line FH is also a fourth residuall line (by the 103. of the tenth): and the line FE is rationall. But if a superficies be contained vnder a rationall line, and a fourth residuall lyne, the line that containeth in power that superficies is (by the 94. of the tenth) a lesse lyne. But the line B containeth in power the superficies EH. Wherfore the line B is a lesse line: which was required to be proued.

Wherefore the lines AE and EB are incommensurable in power, hauing

And in like sort may we proue that as the line AE is to the line BE, so is the line CF to the line DF, and that that which is made of the squares of the lines AE and BE added together is commensurable to that which is made of the squares of the lines CF and DF added together, and that that which is contained vnder the lynes AE and EB, is in like sort commensurable to that which is contained vnder the lines CF and DF. Wherfore also the lines CF and DF are commensurable in power, hauing that which is made of their squares added together mediall, and that which is contained vnder them rationall.

Wherefore the line that containeth in power the superficies LH, that is, the superficies EC is a second mediall residuall line.

and the line DF is in power more then the line FE by the square of a line commensurable in length to the line DE &amp; the line DF, is cōmensurable in lēgth to the rational line put DC. Again forasmuch as AB is by position a binomiall line, therefore (by the 60. of the tenth) the line DE is a first binomiall line. Deuide it into his names in the point G.

And the line DG is in power more then the line GE by the square of a line commensurable in length to the lyne DG, and the line DG is commensurable in length to the rationall line put DC. Wherefore the line DF is commensurable in length to the line DG. Wherfore (by the 13. of the tenth) the whole line DF is commensurable in lēgth to the line remaining, namely,

And forasmuch as the line FD is commensurable in length to the line FG, but the line DF is incommensurable in length to the line FE. Wherfore the line FG is incommensurable in length to the line FE (by the 13. of the tenth) and they are both rationall lines. Wherfore the lines GF and FE are rationall commensurable in power onely. Wherfore (by the 73. of the tenth) the line EG is a residuall line, but it is also rationall (as before hath bene proued): which is impossible, namely, that one &amp; the same line should be both rationall and irrationall. Wherfore a residuall line is not one and the same with a binomiall line, that is, is not a binomiall line: which was required to be demonstrated.

                      that is, one is vtterly of a diuers kinde frō an other. For the square of a mediall line applied to a rationall line, maketh the breadth rationall and incommensurable in length to the rationall lyne, whereunto it is applied (by the 22. of the tenth) The square of a residuall line applied to a rationall line, maketh the breadth a first residuall line (by the 97. of the tenth). The square of a first mediall residuall line applied to a rationall line, maketh the breadth a second residuall lyne (by the 98. of the tenth) The square of a second mediall residuall line applied vnto a rationall line, maketh the breadth a third residuall line (by the 99. of the tenth) The square of a lesse line applied to a rationall line, maketh the breadth a fourth residuall line (by the 100. of the tenth) The square of a line making with a rationall superficies the whole superficies mediall applied to a rationall line, maketh the breadth a

of the binomials of that order of which they were, whose squares were applied to the rationall line. Wherfore the irrationall lines which follow the binomiall line, and the irrationall lines which follow the residuall line, differ the one from the other, so that all the irrationall lynes are 13. in number, namely, these.

               ¶ The 88. Theoreme. The 112. Proposition. The square of a rationall line applyed vnto a binomiall line, maketh the breadth or other side a residuall line, whose names are commensurable to the names of the binomiall line, &amp; in the selfe same proportiō: &amp; moreouer that residuall line is in the selfe same order of residuall lines, that the binomiall line is of binomiall lines.
               SVppose that A be a rationall line,The determination hath sundry partes orderly to be proued. and BC a binomiall line whose greater name let be CD. And vnto the square of the line A let the parallelogramme contayned vnder the lines BC and EF (so that EF be the breadth) be equall. Then I say that EF is a residuall line, whose names are commensurable to the names of the binomiall line BC, which names let be CD
                  
and DB, and are in the same proportion with them: and moreouer the line EF is in the selfe same order of residual lines, that the line BC is of binomiall lines. Vnto the square of the line A let the parallelogramme contayned vnder the lines BD and G be equall.Construction. Now forasmuch as that which is cōtayned vnder the lines BC &amp; EF is equal to that which is contayned vnder the lines BD and G, therfore reciprocally (by the 14. of the sixth) as the line CB is to the BD, so is the line G to the line EF. But the line BC is greater then the line BD, wherefore the line G is greater then the line EF.
                  Demonstration. Vnto the line G let the line EH be equall. Wherefore (by the 11. of the fift) as the line CB is to the line BD, so is the line HE to the line FE. Wherefore by deuision (by the 17. of the fifth) as the line CD is to the line BD, so is the line HF to the line FE.
                  This is an Assumpt, problematicall, artificially vsed and demonstrated. As the line HF is to the FE, so let the line FK be to the line KE (how this is to be done we will declare at the end of this demonstration). Wherefore (by the 12. of the fift) the whole line HK 
                  Therfore those three lines are in continuall proportion. is to the whole line KF as the line FK is to the line KE. For as one of the antecedentes is to one of the consequentes, so are all the antecedentes to all the consequentes. But as the line FK is the line KE, so is the line CD to the line DB (for FK is to EK as HF is to FE, and HF is to FE as CD is DB). Wherfore (by the 11.

of the fift) as the line HK is to the line KF, so is the line CD to the line DB. But the square of the line CD is commensurable to the square of the line DB: wherefore (by the 10. of the tenth) the square of the line HK is cōmensurable to the square of the line FK. But these three lines HK, FK, and EK are proportionall in cōtinuall proportiō (as it hath already bene proued). Wherefore (by the second corrollary of the 20. of the sixth) the square of the line HK is to the square of the line FK as the line HK is to the line EK: wherfore the line HK is commensurable in length to the line EK. Wherefore (by the 15. of the tenth) the line HE is commensurable in length to the line FK. And forasmuch as the square of the line A is equall to that which is contayned vnder the lines EH and BD, but the square of the line A is rationall, where
                     •
                  ore that which is contayned vnder the lines EH and BD is rationall. And it is applyed vnto the rationall line BD. Wherefore (by the 20. of the tenth) the line EH is rationall and commensurable in length to the line BD. Wherefore also the line EK which is commensurable in length to the line HE is

                   rational and commensurable in length to the line BD. Now for that as the line CD is to the line DB, so is t

And for that as the line CD is to the line DB, so is the line FK to the line EK, therefore by contrary proportion as DB is to CD, so is EK 
                   to FK, and alternately as DB is to EK, so is CD to FK: but the lines BD and EK are commensurable in length (as it hath already bene proued). Wherfore also the lines CD and FK are commensurable in length. But the line CD is rationall: wherefore also the line FK is rationall. Wherefore the lines FK and EK are rationall commensurable in power onely.  Wherefore the line FE is a residuall line: whose names FK and KE are commensurable to the names CD and BD of the binomiall line BC and in the same proportion as is proued.FE concluded a residuall li

                   I say moreouer that it is a residuall line of the selfe same order that the binomiall line is. For the line CD is in power more then the line BD either by the square of a line commensurable in length to the line CD, or by the square of a line incommensurable in length. Now if the line CD be in power more then the line BD by the square of a line commensurable in length vnto the line CD, then (by the 13. of the tenth) the line FK is in power more then  the line EK by the square of a line cōmensurable in length to the line FK. And so if the line CD be cōmensurable in lēgth to the rationall line put, the line FK also shalbe cōmensurable in lēgth to the same rationall line: wherfore then the line BC is a first binomiall line, &amp; the  line FE is likewise a first residuall line. And if the line BD be commensurable in length to the rationall line, the line 
                     
                        •
                     K is also commensurable in length to the same, and then the line BC is a second binomiall line, and the line FE a second residuall line. And if neither of the  lines CD nor DB be commensurable in length vnto the rationall line, neither of the lines FK nor EK are commensurable in length vnto the same, and then the line BC is a third binomiall line, &amp; the line FE is a third residuall line. And if the line CD be in power more then the line BD, by the square of a line incommensurable in length to the line CD, the line FK is also (by the 14. of the tenth) in power more then the line EK by the square of a line incommensurable in length to the line FK. And so if the line CD be commensurable in  length to a rationall line put, the line FK also is commensurable in length to the same, where
                  
                     •
                  ore the line BC is a fourth binomiall line, and the line FE is a fourth residuall line. And if  the line BD be commensurable in length to the rationall line, the line EK is likewise commensurable in length to the same, and then the line BC is a fifth binomiall line and the line

                  EF a fifth residuall line. And if neither of the lines CD nor DB be commensurable in length to the rationall line, neither also of the lines FK nor EK is commensurable in length to the same, and then the line BC is a sixth binomiall line, and the line FE a sixth residuall  line. Wherfore the line FE is a residuall line, whose names, namely, FK and EK are commē
                  surable to the names of the binomiall line, namely, to the names CD and DB, and are in the selfe same proportion, and the residuall line EF is in the selfe same order of residuall lines, that the binomiall line BC is of binomiall lines. Wherefore the square of a rationall line applyed vnto a binomiall line maketh the breadth (or other side) a residuall line, whose names are commensurable to the names of the binomiall line, and in the selfe same proportion, and moreouer that residuall line is in the selfe same order of residuall lines, that the binomiall line is of binomiall lines: which was required to be demonstrated.
               
                  Here is the Assumpt (of the foregoing Proposition) confirmed.
                  Now let vs declare how as the line HF is to the line FE, so to make the line FK to the line EK. The line CD is greater then the line BD by supposition. Wherefore also the line HF is greater then the line FE (by alternate proportion, and the 14. of the fifth).Construction. From the line HF take away the line FL equall to the line FE. Wherefore the line remayning, namely, HL, is lesse then the line HF, for the line HF

is equall to the lines HL &amp; LF. As HL is to HF, so (by the 12. of the sixt) let FE be to FK.Demonstration. Wherfore by contrary proportion (by the Corollary of the 4. of the fifth) as HF is to HL, so is FK to FE. Wherefore by conuersion of proportion (by the Corollary of the 19. of the fifth) as HF is to LF, that is, to the line equall vnto it, namely, to FE, so is the line FK to the line EK.
                  
                     
                        M. Dee, of this Assumpt, maketh (

                     Two vnequall right lines being propounded, to adioyne vnto the lesse, a right line, which takē with  the lesse (as one right line) shall haue the same proportion, to the line adioyned, which, the greater of the two propounded, hath to the lesse.
                     
                        The construction and demonstration hereof, is worde for worde to be taken, as it standeth here before: after these wordes: The line HF is greater then the line FE.
                  
                  
                     ¶ A Corollary also noted by I. Dee.
                     
                     
                        It is therefore euident, that thus are three right lines (in our handling) in continuall proportion: it is to weete, the greater, the lesse and the adioyned, make the first, the lesse with the adioyned, make the second: and the adioyned line is the third.
                     
                     This is proued in the beginning of the demonstration, after the Assumpt vsed.
                  
               
               
                  An other demonstration after Flussas.
                  
                  Take a rationall line A, and let GB be a binomiall line, whose greater line let be GD:
                        Construction.
                      and vpon the line GB apply (by the 45. of the first) the parallelogrāme BZ equall to the square of the line A, and making in breadth the line GZ. Likewise vpon the line DB (by the same) apply the parallelogramme BI equall also to the square of the line A, and making in breadth the line DI: and put the line GZT equall to the line DI. Then I say, that GZ is such a residuall line as is required in the Proposition.

Forasmuch as the parallelogrammes

BZ &amp; BI are equall, therefore (by the 14. of the sixt) reciprocally as the line GB is to the line BD, so is the line DI or the line GT, (which is equall vnto it) vnto the line GZ. Wherefore by diuision, as the line GD is to the line DB, so is the line TZ to the line ZG (by the 17. of the fifth). Wherefore the line TZ is greater then the line ZG. (For the line GD is the greater name of the binomiall line GB). Vnto the line ZG put the line ZC equall. And as the line TC is to the line TZ, so (by the 11. of the sixth) let the line ZG be to line ZK. Wherefore contrary wise (by the Corollary of the 4. of the fifth) the line TZ is to the line TC,

                      as the line ZK is to the line ZG. Wherefore by conuersion of proportion (by the 19. of the fifth) as the line TZ is to the line ZC (that is, to ZG, which is equall vnto it) so is the line ZK to the line KG. But the line TZ is to the line ZG, as the line GD is to the line DB. Wherfore (by the 11. of the fifth) the line ZK is to the line KG, as the line GD is to the line DB. But the lines GD and DB are commensurable in power onely. Wherefore also the lines ZK and KG are commensurable in power onely, by the 10. of this booke. Farther, forasmuch as the line TZ is to the line ZG, as the line ZK is to the line KG, therefore by the 12. of the fifth, all the antecedentes, namely, the whole line TK are to all the consequentes, namely, to the line KZ, as one of the antecedentes, namely, the line ZK is to one of the consequentes, namely, to the line KG. Wherefore the line ZK is the meane proportionall betwene the lines TK and KG. And therefore (by the Corollary of the 20. of the sixth) as the first, namely, the line TK, is to the third, namely, to the line KG: so is the square of the line TK to the square of the second, namely, of the line KZ. And forasmuch as the parallelogrāme BI (which is equall to the square of the rationall line A) is applied vpon the rationall line DB, it maketh the breadth DI rationall and commensurable in length vnto the line DB, by the 20. of the tenth. And therfore the line GT (which is equall vnto the line DI) is commensurable in length to the same line DB. And for that as the line GD is to the line DB, so is the line KZ to the line KG, but as the line KZ is to the line KG, so is the line TK to the line KZ, therefore (by the 11. of the fifth) as the line GD is to the line DB, so is the line TK to the line KZ. Wherefore (by the 22. of the sixth) as the square of the line GD is to the square of the line DB, so is the square of the line TK to the square of the line KZ. But the square of the line GD is commensurable to the square of the line DB (for the names GD and DB of the binomiall line GB are commensurable in power). Wherefore the square of the line TK shall be commensurable to the square of the line KZ, by the 10. of this booke. But as the square of the line TK is to the square of the line KZ, so is it proued, that the right line TK is to the right line KG. Wherfore the right line TK is commensurable in length to the right line KG. Wherefore it is also commensurable in length to the line TG (by the 15. of the tenth). Which line TG is (as it hath bene proued a

                      Wherefore the line GZ is a residuall line. And forasmuch as the rationall line TG is commensurable in length to either of these lines DB and KG. Wherefore the lines DB &amp; KG shall be commensurable in length, by the 12. of the tenth. But the line ZK is to the line KG, as the line GD is to the line DB. Wherefore alternately, by the 16. of the fifth, the line KZ is to the line GD, as the line KG is to the line DB. Wherefore the line ZK is commensurable in length vnto the line GD.  Wherefore the lines ZK and KG (the names of the residuall line GZ) are commensurable in length to the lines GD and DB, which are the names of the binomiall line GB: and the line ZK is to the line KG in the same proportion, that the line GD is to the line DB.  Wherefore if the whole line ZK be in power more then the line conueniently ioyned KG, by the square of a line commensurable in length to the line ZK, then the greater name GD shall be in power more then the lesse name DB, by the square of a line commensurable in length to the line GD, by the 14. of the tenth. And if the line ZK be in power more then the line KG, by the square of a line incommensurable in length to the line ZK, the line also GD shall be in power more then the line DB, by the square of a line incommensurable in length vnto the line GD (by the same Proposition).

               ¶ The 89. Theoreme. The 113. Proposition. The square of a rational line applied vnto a residuall, maketh the breadth or other side a binomial line, whose names are commensurable to the names of the residuall line, and in the selfe same proportion: and moreouer that binomiall line is in the selfe same order of binomiall lynes, that the residual line is of residuall lynes.
               SVppose that A be a rationall line, and BD a residuall line. And vnto the square of the line A let that which is contained vnder the lines BD and KH be equal. Wherfore the square of the rationall line A applied vnto the residuall line BD maketh the breadth or other side KH. Then I say that the line KH is a binomiall line, whose names are commensurable to

the names of the residuall line BD, and in the selfe same proportion, and that the line KH is in the selfe same order of binomiall lines, that the line BD is of residuall lines. Vnto the line BD let the line conueniently ioyned be DC.Construction. Wherfore the lines BC and DC are rationall commensurable in power onely. And vnto the square of the line A let the parallelogramme contained vnder the lines BC and G be equall. But the square of the line A is rationall.Demons

Wherfore also the line G is rationall and commensurable in length to the line BC (by the 20. of the tenth). Now forasmuch as the parallelogramme contained vnder the lines BC and G is equall to that which is contained vnder the lines BD and KH, therfore (by the 16. of the sixt) as the line BC is to the line BD, so i

                  KH into EH so let the line FH be to the line EF (how this is to be done, we will decare at the ende of this demonstration). Wherfore the residue KF is to the residue FH, as the whole KH is to the whole HE (by the 19. of the fift) that is, as the line BC is to the line CD. But the lines BC and CD are commensurable in power onely. Wherefore also the lines KF and FH are commensurable in power only. And for that as KH is to HE, so is KF to FH, but as KH is to HE, so is also HF to FE, therfore as KF is to FH, so is FH to FE. Wherfore (by the corollary of the 19. of the sixt) as the first is to the third, so is the square of the first, to the square of the second. Wherefore as KF is to FE, so is the square of the line KF to the square of the line FH, but these squares are commensurable, for the lines KF and FH are commensurable in power. Wherfore the lines KF and FE are commensurable in length. Wherfore (by the second part of the 15. of the tenth) the lines KE and EF are commensurable in length. Wherfore (by the same) the lines KF and FE are commensurable in length. But the line KE is rationall and commensurable in length to the line BC: wherefore the line KF is also rationall and commensurable in lēgth to the line BC. And for that as the line BC is to the line CD, so it KF to EH, therfore alternately. (by the 16. of the fift) as BC is to KF, so is CD to FH. But the line BC is commensurable in length

to the line KF. Wherfore the line CD is commensurable in length to the line FH. But the line CD is rationall. Wherfore also the line FH is rationall. And the lines BC and CD are rationall commensurable in power onely. Wherfore the lines KF and FH are rationall commensurable  in power onely. Wherfore the line KH is a binomiall line, whose names are commensurable  to the names of the residuall line, and in the same proportion. I say moreouer that  it is a binomiall of the selfe same order of binomial lines, that the line BD is of residual lines.  For if the line BC be in power more then the line CD by the square of a line commensurable in length to the line BC, the line KF is also in power more then the line FH by the square of a line commensurable in length to the

line KF (by the 14. of the tenth). And if the line BC be commensurable in length to the rationall line put, the line KF is also (by the 12. of the tenth) commensurable in length to the rationall line, and so the  lyne BD is a first residuall lyne, and the line KH is in like sort a first binomiall line. If the line CD be commensurable in length to the rational line, the line FH is also commensurable  in length to the same line, and so the line BD is a second residuall line, and the line KH a second binomiall line. And if neither of the lines BC nor CD be commensurable in length to the rationall line, neither also of the lines KF nor FH is commensurable in length  to the same, and so the line BD is a third residuall line, and the line KH a third binomiall line. But if the line BC be in power more then the line CD by the square of a line incommensurable in length to the line BC, the line KF is in power more thē the line FH by the square of a line incommensurable in length to the line KF (by the 14. of the tenth) And if the line BC be commensurable in length to the rationall line put, the line KF is also commensurable in length to the same line, and so the line BD is a fourth residuall line, and the line KH  a fourth binomiall line. And if the line CD be cōmēsurable in lēgth to the rational line, the  line FH is also cōmēsurable in lēgth to the same, &amp; so the line BD is a fift residuall line, &amp; the line KH a fift binomiall line. And if neither of the lines BC nor CD be commensurable in length to the rationall line, neither also of the lines KF nor FH is commensurable in  length to the same, and so the line BD is a sixt residuall line, and the line KH is a sixt binomiall line. Wherfore KH is a binomiall line, whose names KF and FH are commensurable to the names of the residuall line BD, namely, to BC and CD, and in the selfe same proportion, and the binomiall line KH is in the selfe same order of binomiall lines, that the residuall BD, is of residuall lines. Wherefore the square of a rationall line applied vnto a residuall line, maketh the breadth or other side a binomiall line, whose names are commensurable to the names of the residuall line, and in the selfe same proportion, and moreouer the binomiall line is in the selfe same order of binomiall lines, that the residuall line is of residuall lines: which was required to be demonstrated.
               
                  The Assumpt confirmed.
                  Now let vs

declare how, as the line KH is to the line EH, so to make the line HF to the line FE. Adde vnto the line KH directly a line equall to HE, and let the whole line be KL, and (by the tenth of the sixt) let the line HE be deuided as the whole line KL is deuided in the point H: let the line HE be so deuided in the point F. Wherfore

as the line KH is to the line HL, that is, to the line HE, so is the line HF to the line FE.

Wherefore the line BE is rationall and commensurable in length to the line BG (by the 20. of the tenth). Now forasmuch as the parallelogrammes BI and TD are equall (for

that they are eche equall to the square of the line A):

Wherefore by conuersion of proportion (by the corrollary of the 19. of the fifth) as the line BT is to the line TE, so is the line BG to the line GD. As the line BG is to the line GD, so let the line TZ be to the line ZE by the corrollary of the 10. of the sixth. Wherefore by the 11. of the fifth the line BT is to the line TE, as the line TZ is to the line ZE. For either of them are as the line BG is to the line GD. Wherefore the residue BZ is to the residue ZT, as the whole BT is to the whole TE by the 19. of the fifth. Wherefore by the 11. of the fifth the line BZ is to the line ZT as the line ZT is to the line ZE. Wherfore the line TZ is the meane proportionall betwene the lines BZ and ZE. Wherefore the square of the first, namely, of the line BZ, is to the square of the second, namely, of the line ZT, as the first, namely, the line BZ, is to the third, namely, to the line ZE (by the corollary of the 20. of the sixth). And for that as the line BG is to the line GD, so is the line TZ to the line ZE: but as the line TZ is to the line ZE, so is the line BZ to the line ZT. Wherefore as the line BG is to the line GD, so is the line BZ to the line ZT (by the 11. of the fifth). Wherfore the lines BZ and ZT are commensurable in power onely, as also are the lines BG and GD (which are the names of the residuall line BD) by the 10. of this booke. Wherfore the right lines BZ and ZE are cōmensurable in length, for we haue proued that they are in the same proportion that the squares of the lines BZ and ZT are. And therefore (by the corollary of the 15. of this booke) the residue BE (which is a rationall line) is commensurable in length vnto the same line BZ. Wherefore also the line BG (which is commensurable in length vnto the line BE) shall also be commensurable in length vnto the same line EZ (by the 12. of the tenth). And it is proued that the line RZ is to the line ZT commensurable in power onely. Wherefore the right lines BZ and ZT are rationall commensurable in power onely. Wherefore the whole line BT is a binomiall  line (by the 36. of this booke). And for that as the line BG is to the line GD, so is the line BZ to the line ZT: therefore alternately (by the 16. of the fifth) the line BG is to the line BZ, as the line GD is to the line ZT. But the line BG is commensurable in length vnto the line BZ. Wherefore (by the 10. of this booke) the line GD is commensurable in length vnto the line ZT. Wherefore the names BG and  
                     GD of the residuall line BD are commensurable in length vnto the names BZ and ZT of the binomial line BT: and the line BZ is to the line ZT in the same proportion that the line BG is to the line GD
                      as before it was more manifest. And that they are of one and the selfe same order is thus proued. If the  greater or lesse name of the residuall line, namely, the right lines BG or GD be cōmensurable in length to any rationall line put: the greater name also or lesse, namely, BZ or ZT shalbe commensurable in length to the same rationall line put by the 12. of this booke. And if neither of the names of the residuall line be commensurable in length vnto the rationall line put, neither of the names of the binomiall line shalbe commensurable in length vnto the same rationall line put (by the 13. of the tenth). And if the greater name BG be in power more then the lesse name by the square of a line commensurable in length vnto the line BG, the greater name also BZ shalbe in power more then the lesse by the square of a line commensurable in length vnto the line BZ. And if the one be in power more by the square of a line incommensurable in length, the other also shalbe in power more by the square of a line incommensurable in length by the 14. of this booke.

But by position the lines CE and ED are cōmensurable to the lines AF and FB, and are in the selfe same proportion. Wherfore (by the 12. of the tenth) as the line AF is to the line FB

Wherfore the residue AB is to the residue KL, as the whole AF is to the whole KM. But the line AF is commensurable to the line KM, for either of the lines AF and KM is commensurable to the line CE. Wherfore also the line AB is commensurable to the line KL. And as the line AB is to the line KL, so (by the first of the sixt) is the parallelogramme contained vnder the lines CD and AB to the parallelogramme contained vnder the lines CD and KL. Wherfore the parallelogramme contained vnder the lines CD and AB is commensurable to the parallelogramme contained vnder the lines CD and KL. But the parallelogramme contained vnder the lines CD and KL is equall to the square of the line H. Wherfore the parallelogrāme cō

Wherfore the square of the line H is commensurable to the square of the line G. But the square of the line H is rationall. Wherfore the square of the line G is also rationall. Wherfore also the line G is rational, and it containeth in power the parallelogramme contained vnder the lines AB and CD.

contained vnder a rationall line and an irrationall line, is (by the Assumpt following the 38. of the tenth) irrationall: and the line which containeth in power an irrationall superficies, is (by the Assumpt going before the 21. of the tenth) irrationall. And it is not one and the selfe same with any of those thirtene that were before. For none of the lines that were before applied to a rationall line maketh the breadth mediall. Againe vnto that which is contained vnder the lines B and C, let the square of D be equall. Wherefore the square of D is irrationall. Wherefore also the line D is irrationall and not of the self same kinde with any of those that were before. For the square of none of the lines which were before, applied to a rationall line, maketh the breadth the line C. In like sort also shall it so followe, if a man proceede infinitely. Wherefore it is manifest, that of a mediall line are produced infinite irrationall lines, of which none is of the selfe same kinde with any of those that were before: which was required to be proued.

               ¶The 92. Theoreme. The 116. Proposition. Now let vs proue that in square figures, the diameter is incommensurable in length to the side.
               SVppose that ABCD be a square, and let the diameter therof be AC. Then I say that the diameter AC is incommensurable in length to the side AB. For if it be possible,Demonstratiō leading to an impossibili
                        •
                     ie. let it be cōmensurable in lēgth. I say that thē this will follow, that one and the selfe same nūber shall be both an euen number &amp; an odde number. It is manifest (by the 47. of the first) that the square of the line AC is double to the square of the line AB. And for that the line AC is commensurable in length to the line AB (by supposition), therfore the lyne AC hath vnto the line AB

that proportion that a number hath to a number (by the 5. of the tenth). Let the lyne AC haue vnto the line AB that proportion that the number EF hath to the number G. And let EF and G be the least numbers that haue one and the same proportion with them. Wherfore EF is not vnitie. For if EF be vnitie, and it hath to the number G that proportion that the line AC hath to the lyne AB, and the line AC is greater then the lyne AB. Wherfore vnitie EF is greater then the number G, which is impossible. Wherfore FE is not vnitie, wherfore it is a number. And for that as the square of the line AC is to the square of the lyne AB, so is the square number of the number EF, to the square number

of the number G, for in eche is the proportion of their sides doubled (by the corollary of the 20 of the sixt and 11. of the eight): and the proportion of the line AC to the line AB doubled, is equal to the proportiō of the nūber EF to the number G, doubled, for as the line AC is to the line AB, so is the nūber EF to the number G. But the square of the line AC is double to the square of the line AB. Wherfore the square number produced of the number EF is double to the square number produced of the number G. Wherefore the square number produced of EF is an euen number. Wherfore EF is also an euen number. For if EF were an odde number, the square number also produced of it, should (by the 23. and 29. of the ninth) be an odde number. For if odde numbers how many soeuer be added together, and if the multitude of thē be odde, the whole also shal be odde. Wherfore EF is an euen number. Deuide the number EF into two equall partes in H. And forasmuch as the numbers EF and G are the lest numbers in that proportion, therfore (by the 24. of the seuenth) they are prime numbers the one to the other. And EF is an euen number. Wherfore G is an odde number. For if G were an euen number, the number two should measure both the number EF and the number G (for euery euen nūber hath an halfe part by the definition) but these numbers EF &amp; G are prime the one to the other. Wherfore it is impossible that they should be measured by two or by any other number besides vnitie. Wherfore G is an odde number. And forasmuch as the number EF is double to the number EH, therfore the square number produced of EF is quadruple to the square number produced of EH. And the square number produced of EF is double to the square number produced of G. Wherfore the square number produced of G is double to the square number produced of EH. Wherfore the square number produced of G is an euen number. Wherfore also by those thinges which haue bene before spoken, the number G is an euen number, but it is proued that it is an odde number, which is impossible. Wherefore the line AC is not commensurable in length to the line AB, wherfore it is incommensurable.
               
                  An other demonstration.
                  We may by an other demonstration proue, that the diameter of a square is incommensurable to the side thereof.An other demonstration leading to an impossibili
                           •
                        ie. Suppose that there be a square, whose diameter let be A and let the side thereof be B. Then I say that the line A is incommensurable in length to the line B. For if it be possible let it be commensurable in length. And agayne as the line A is to the line B so let the number EF be to the number G: and let them be the least that haue one and the same proportion with them: wherefore the numbers EF and

                     G, are prime the one to the other. First I say that G is not vnitie. For if it be possible let it be vnitie. And for that the square of the line A is to the square of the line B as the square number produced of EF is to the square number produced of G (as it was proued in the 
                        •
                     ormer demonstration) but the square of the line A is double to the square of the line B. Wherfore the square nūber produced of EF is double to the square number produced of G. And by your supposition G is vnitie. Wherefore the square number produced of EF is the number two which is impossible. Wherefore G is not vnitie. Wherefore it is a number. And for that as the square of the line A is to the square of the line B, so is the square number produced of EF to the square number produced of G. Wherefore the square number produced of EF is double to the square number produced of G. Wherefore the square number produced of G. measureth the square number produced of EF. Wherefore also (by the 14. of the eight) the number G measureth the number EF: and the number G also measureth it selfe. Wherefore the number G measureth these numbers EF and G, when yet they are prime the one to the

other: which is impossible. Wherefore the diameter A is not commensurable in length to the side B. Wherefore it is incommensurable: which was required to be demonstrated.
               
               
                  An other demonstration after Flussas.
                  
                  Suppose that vppon the line AB be described a square

whose diameter let be the line AC. Then I say that the side AB is incommensurable in length vnto the diameter AC. Forasmuch as the lines AB and BC are equall, therefore the square of the line AC is double to the square of the line AB by the 47. of the first. Take by the 2. of the eight nūbers how many soeuer in continuall proportion frō vnitie, and in the proportion of the squares of the lines AB and AC. Which let be the numbers D, E, F, G. And forasmuch as the first from vnitie namely E is no square number, for that it is a prime number, neither is also any other of the sayd numbers a square number except the third from vnitie and so all the rest leuing one betwene, by the 10. of the ninth. Wherefore D is to E, or E to F, or F to G, in that proportion that a square number is to a number not square. Wherefore by the corrollary of the 25. of the eight, they are not in that proportion the one to the other that a square number is to a square number. Wherefore neither also haue the squares of the lines AB and AC (which are in the same proportion) that porportion that a square number hath to a square number. Wherefore by the 9. of this booke their sides, namely, the side AB and the diameter AC are incommensurable in length the one to the other which was required to be proued.
                  This demonstration I thought good to adde, for that the former demonstrations seme not so full, and they are thought of some to be none of Theons, as also the proposition to be none of Euclides.

For if (by the 13. of the sixth) betwene the lines A and B there be taken the meane proportionall line, namely C, then (by the second corrollary of the 20. of the sixth) as the line A is to the line B, so is the figure described vpon the line A to the figure described vpon the line C, being both like and in like sort described, that is, whether they be squares (which are alwayes like the one to the other), or whether they be any other like rectiline figures, or whether they be circles aboute the diameters A and C. For circles

haue that proportion the one to the other, that the squares of their diameters haue (by the 2. of the twelfth). Wherfore (by the second part of the 10. of the tenth) the

Wherefore, seing it was so publike in his time, so famous, and so appertayning to the property of this booke: it is most likely, both to be knowne to Euclide, and also to haue bene by him in apt order placed.

requisite to the knowledge of superficiall figures, and entreated of lines (and of their diuisions and sections) which are the termes and limites of superficiall figures: so in this booke is set forth the declaration of wordes and definitions of thinges pertayning to solide and corporall figures: and also of superficieces which are the termes &amp; limites of solides: moreouer of the diuision and intersection of them, and diuers other thinges, without which the knowledge of bodely and solide formes can not be attayned vnto.

                   and the terme or limite of a solide is a superficies.
               There are three kindes of continuall quantitie, a line, a superficies, and a solide or body: the beginning of all which (as before hath bene sayd) is a poynt, which is indiuisible. Two of these quantities, namely, a line and a superficies, were defined of Euclide before in his first booke. But the third kinde, namely, a solide or body he there defined not, as a thing which pertayned not then to his purpose: but here in this place he setteth the definitiō therof, as that which chiefely now pertayneth to his purpose, and without which nothing in these thinges can profitably be taught. A solide (sayth he) is that which hath lēgth, breadth, and thicknes, or depth. There are (as before hath bene taught) three reasons or meanes of measuring, which are called cōmonly dimensions, namely, l
                     •
                  ngth, breadth, and thicknes. These dimensions are ascribed vnto quantities onely. By these are all kindes of quantitie de

                  ined, 
                     ••
                   are counted perfect or imperfect, according as they are pertaker of fewer or more of them. As Euclide defined a line, ascribing vnto it onely one of these dimensions, namely, length: Wherefore a line is the imperfectest kinde of quantitie. In defining of a superficies, he ascribed vnto it two dimensions, namely, length, and breadth: whereby a superficies is a quantitie of greater perfection then is a line, but here in the definitiō of a solide or body. Euclide attributeth vnto it all the three dimensiōs, lēgth, breadth, and thicknes. Wherfore a solide is the most perfectest quantitie,
                     A solide the most perfectest quantitie.
                   which wanteth no dimension at all, passing a lyne by two dimensions, and passing a super

                  icies by one. This definition of a solide is without any designation of

                   let be equall or vnequall. For example let the length therof be 5. inches, the breadth 4. and the thicknes 2. if the dimensions were equall, the reason is like, and all one, as it is in a Sphere and in

                   and to haue their endes and borders as hath bene shewed in the first booke, that the limites and endes of a line are pointes, and the limites or borders of a superficies are lines, so now he saith tha

                     Third diffinition.
                  3 A plaine superficies is then vpright or erected perpendicularly to a plaine superficies, when all the right lines drawen in one of the plaine superficieces vnto the common section of those two plaine superficieces, making therwith right angles, do also make right angles to the other plaine superficies. Inclination or leaning of a right line, to a plaine superficies, is an acute angle, contained vnder a right line falling from a point aboue to the plaine superficies, and vnder an other right line, from the lower end of the sayd line (let downe) drawen in the same plaine superficies, by a certaine point assigned, where a right line from the first point aboue, to the same plaine superficies falling perpendicularly, toucheth.
               In this third definition are included two definitions: the first is of a plaine superficies erected perpendicularly vpon a plaine superficies.

                  icieces ABCD and CDEF. Of which let the superficies CDEF be a ground plaine superficies, and let the superficies ABCD be erected vnto it, and let the line CD be a common terme or intersection

to them both, that is, let it be the end or bound of either of them,

It is also commonly called a superficies perpendicular vpon or vnto a superficies.
               
                  
                     Declaration of the second part.
                  For the second part of this definition, which is of the inclination of a right line vnto a plaine superficies, take this example. Let ABCD be a ground plaine superficies, vpon which from a point being a loft, namely, the point E, suppose a right line to fall, which let be the line EG, touching the plaine superficies ABCD at the poynt G. Againe, from the point E, being the toppe or higher limite and end of the inclining line EG, let a perpendicular line fall vnto the plaine superficies ABCD, which let be the line EF, and let F be the point where EF toucheth the plaine superficies ABCD. Then from the point of the fall of the line inclining vpon the superficies vnto

the point of the falling of the perpendicular line vpon the same superficies, that is, from the point G to the point F, draw a right line GF. Now by this definition, the acute angle EGF is the inclination of the line EG vnto the superficies ABCD. Because it is contayned of the inclining line, and of the right line drawen in the superficies, from the point of the fall of the line inclining to the point of the fall of the perpendicular line: which angle must of necessitie be an acute angle. For the angle EFG is by construction a right angle, and three angles in a triangle are equ

                     Fourth diffinition.
                  4 Inclination of a plaine superficies to a plaine superficies, is an acute angle contayned vnder the right lines, which being drawen in either of the plaine superficieces to one &amp; the self same point of the cōmon section, make with the section right angles.
               
                  Suppose that there be two superficieces ABCD &amp; EFGH,

and let the superficies ABCD be supposed to be erected not perpendicularly, but somewhat leaning and inclining vnto the plaine superficies EFGH, as much or as litle as ye will: the cōmon terme or section of which two superficieces let be the line CD. From some one point, a
                     •
                   from the point M assigned in the common section of the two superficieces, namely, in the line CD, draw a perpendicular line in either superficies. In the ground superficies EFGH draw the line MK, and in the superficies ABCD draw the line ML. Now if the angle LMK be an acute angle, then is that angle the inclination of the superficies ABCD vnto the superficies EFGH, by this definition, because it is contained of perpendicular lines drawen in either of the superficieces to one and the self same point being the common section of them both.
            
            
               5 Plaine superficieces are in like sort inclined the on

                     〈…〉
                  
               
               This definition needeth no declaration at all, but is most manifest by the definition last going before. For in considering the inclinations of diuers superficieces to others, if the acute angles contayned vnder the perpendicular lines drawen in them from one point assigned in ech of their common sections be equall, as if to the angle LMK in the former example be geuen an other angle in the inclination of two other superficieces equall, then is the inclination of these superficieces like, and are by this definition sayd in like sort to incline the one to the other.
               
                  Theodosius geueth an other definition of like inclination of plaine superficieces the one to the other, after this maner.

                     One plaine superficies is like inclined to an other, as an other superficies is to an other, when in either of the plaine superficieces right lines being drawen, and making right angles with their common section, containe in the same pointes equall angles. This definition is in substance the same with that geuen of Euclide, and is an elucidation of it.
For example let ABCD be a ground plaine superficies, vnto which let the superficies EFIK incline and leane. And let the common section of these two superficieces be the line EF. Then drawe in eche of thes
                     •
                   superficieces right lines to some one point of the common section EF, which let be the point G: with which section let them make right angles. As in the superficies

ABCD draw the line 
                     •
                  G, which in the point G let it make with the common sectiō a right angle HGF or HGE. Also in the superficies EFIK draw the line LG, which in the point G together with the common section EF let make also a right angle LGF, or the right angle LG
                     •
                  .
               Now also let there be an other ground plaine superficies, namely, the superficies MNOP, vnto whom also let leane and incline the superficies Q
                     ••
                  T, and let the common section or segment of them be the line QR. And draw in the superficies MNOP to some one point of the cōmon section as to the point X the line VX, making with the common section right angles, namely, the angle VXR, or the angle VXQ: also in the superficies STQR draw the right line YX to the same point X in the common section, making therwith right angles, as the angle YX
                     •
                  , or the angle YXQ. Now (as sayth the definition) if the angles contayned vnder the right lines drawen in these superficieces &amp; making right angles with the common section, be in the pointes, that is, in the pointes of their meting in the common section, equall: then is the inclination of the superficieces equall. As in this example, if the angle LGH contayned vnder the line LG being in the inclining superficies 
                     •
                  KEF and vnder the line HG being in the ground superficies ABCD, bē equall, to the angle YXV contayned vnder the line VX being in the

ground superficies MNOP and vnder the line YX being in the inclining superficies STQR: then is the inclination of the super

                  icies IKEF vnto the superficies ABCD, like vnto the inclination of the superficies STQR vnto the superficies MNOP. And so by this definition these two superficieces are sayd to be in like sort inclined.

               10 A Pyramis is a solide figure contained vnder many playne superficieces set vpon one playne superficies, and gathered together to one point.
                     Tenth diffinition.
                  
               
               Two superficieces raysed vpon any ground can not make a Pyramis, for that two superficiall angles ioyned together in the toppe, cannot (as before is sayd) make a solide angle. Wherfore whē thre, foure, fiue, or moe (how many soeuer) superficieces are raised vp frō one superficies being the ground, or base, and euer ascēding diminish their breadth, till at the lēgth all their angles cōcurre in one point, making there a solide angle: the solide inclosed, bounded, and terminated by these superficieces is called a Pyramis, as ye see in a taper of foure sides, and in a spire of a towre which containeth many sides, either of which is a Pyramis.
               And because that all the superficieces of euery Pyramis ascend from one playne superficies as from the base, and tende to one poynt, it must of necessitie come to passe; that all the superficieces of a Pyramis are trianguler, except the base, which may be of any forme or figure except a circle. For if the base be a circle, then it ascendeth not with sides, or diuers superficieces, but with one round superficies, and hath not the name of a Pyramis, but is called (as hereafter shall appeare) a Cone.
               Of Pyramid, there are diuers kindes. For according to the varietie of the base is brought forth the varietie and diuersitie of kindes of Pyramids. If the base of a Pyramis be a triangle, then is it called a triangled Pyramis. If the base be a figure of fower angles, it is called a quadrangled Pyramis.

Here also beholde the forme thereof as it is by arte described in a plaine to appeare bodilike.
               
                  Flussas here noteth that Theon and Campane disagree in defining a Prisme, and he preferreth the definition geuen of Campane before the de

                  inition geuen of Euclide (which because he may seme with out lesse offence to reiect, he calleth it Theons definition) and following Campane he geueth an other definition, which is this.
               
                  
                     An other diffinition of a prisme, which is a speciall diffinition of a prisme: as it is commonly called and vsed.
                  
                  A Prisme is a solide figure, which is contayned vnder fiue playne superficieces, of which two are triangles, like, equall, and parallels, and the rest are parallelogrammes.
               
               The example before set agreeth likewise with this definition, and manifestly declareth the same. For in it were 
                     •
                  iue superficieces, the base, the two erected superficieces, and the two endes: of which the two endes are triangles like, equall and parallels, and all the other are parallelogrammes as this definition requireth. The cause why he preferreth the difinion of Campane before the difinition of Theon (as he calleth it, but in very deede it is Euclides definition, as certainely, as are all those which are geuen of him in the former bookes, neither is there any cause at all, why it should be doubted in this one definition more then in any of the other) as he him selfe alledgeth, is, for that it is (as he sayth) to large, and comprehendeth many mo kindes of solide figures besides Prismes, as Columnes hauing sides, and all Parallelipipedons, which a definition should not doo: but should be conuertible with the thing defined, and declare the nature of it onely, and stretch no farther.

                  hinketh Flussas ought not to haue made so much a doo in this matter, nor to haue bene so sharpe in sight and so quicke as to see and espy out such faultes, which can of no man that will see rightly withou

                   affection be espyed for such great faultes. For it may well be aunswered that these faultes which he noteth (if yet they be faultes) are not to be found in this definion. It may be sayd that it extendeth it selfe not 
                     •
                  arther then it should, but declareth onely the thing defined, namely, a Prisme. Neither

doth it agree (as 
                     
                        •
                     lussas cauilleth) with all Parallelipipedons and Columnes hauing sides. All Parallelipipedons what so euer right angled, or not right angled which are described of equidistant sides or superficieces, haue their sides opposit. So that in any of them there is no one side, but it hath a side opposit vnto it. So likewise is it of euē sided Columnes, eche hath his opposite side directly agaynst it, which agreeth not with this definition of Euclide. Here it is euidently sayd, that of all the superficieces, the two which are opposite are equall, like, and parallels, meaning vndoubtedly onely two &amp; no moe. Which is manifest by that which followeth. The other (sayth he) are parallelogrammes, signifiing most euidently that none of the rest besides the two aforesayd, which are equall, like, and parallels, are opposite: but two of necessitie are raysed vp, and concurre in one common line, and the other is the base. So that it contayneth not vnder it the figures aforesayd, that is sided Columnes, &amp; al Parallelipipedons, as Flussas hath not so aduisedly noted.
               Agayne where Flussas setteth in his definition, as an essentiall part thereof, that of the fiue superficieces, of which a Prisme is contayned, two of them must be triangles, that vndoubtedly is not of necessitie, they may be of some other figure. Suppose that in the figure before geuen that in the place of the two opposite figures, which there were two triangl
                     •
                  s, were placed two pentagōs: yet should the figure remayne a Prisme still, and agree with the definition of Euclide, and 
                     •
                  alleth not vnder the definition of Flussas. So that his definitiō semeth to be to narrow and stretcheth not so farre as it ought to do, nor declareth the whole nature of the thing defined. Wherefore it is not to be preferrd before Euclides definition, as he woulde haue it. This figure of Euclide called a Prisme, is called of Campane and certayne others Figura Serr

                     This bodie called Figura Serratilis.
                   And of some others it is called Cuneus, that is, a Wedge, because it beareth the figure of a wedge.
               Moreouer although it were so, that the definitiō of a Prisme should be so large, that it should cōtaine all these figures noted of Flussas as sided Columnes, &amp; all Parallelipipedons: yet should not Flussas haue so great a cause to finde so notably a fault, so vtterly to reiect it. It is no rare thing in all learninges, chiefely in the Mathematicalls, to haue one thing more generall then an other. Is it not true that euery Isosceles is a triangle, but not euery triangle is an Isosceles? And why may not likewise a Prisme be more generall, then a Parallelepipedon, or a Columne hauing sides (and contayne them vnder it as a triangle cōtayneth vnder it an Isosceles and other kinds of triangles). So that euery Prallelipipedon, or euery sided Columne be a Prisme, but not euery Prisme a Parallelipipedō or a sided Columne. This ought not to be so much offensiue. And indeede it semeth manifestly of many, yea &amp; of the learned so to be takē, as clearely appeareth by the wordes of Psellus in his Epitome of Geometrie, where he entreateth of the production and constitution of these bodyes. His wordes are these.

                  iue sides maketh by his motion a sided Columne of fiue sides? Likewise an Hexagon erected at right angles produceth a Columne hauing sixe sides: and so of all other rectillne figures. All which solides or bodyes so produced, whether they be sided Columnes or Parallelipipedons, be here in most plaine words (of this excellēt and auncient Greke author Psellus) called Prismes. Wherfore if the definitiō of a Prisme geuē of Euclide should extend it selfe so largely as Flussas imagineth, and should enclude such figures or bodyes, as he noted: he ought not yet for all that so much to be offended, and so narowly to haue sought faultes. For Euclide in so defining mought haue that meaning &amp; sense of a Prisme which Psellus had. So ye see that Euclide may be defended either of these two wayes, either by that that the definition extendeth not to these figures, and so not to be ouer generall nor stretch farther then it ought: or ells by that that if it should stretch so far it is not so haynous. For that as ye se many haue tak

                   it in that sense. In deede cōmonly a Prisme is taken in that significatiō and meaning in which Campa

                      Flussas and others take it. In which sense it semeth also that in diuers propositions in these bookes following it ought of necessitie to be taken.
            
            
               12 A Sphere is a figure which is made,
                     Twelueth diffinition.
                   when the diameter of a semicircle abiding fixed, the semicircle is turned round about, vntill it returne vnto the selfe same place from whence it began to be moued.
               To the end we may fully and perfectly vnderstand this definition,

how a Sphere is produced of the motion of a semicircle, it shall be expedient to cōsider how quantities Mathematically are by imagination conceaued to be produced, by flowing and motion, as was somewhat touched in the beginning of the first booke. Euer the lesse quantitie by his motion bringeth for
                     •
                  h the quātitie next aboue it. As a point mouing, flowing, or gliding, bringeth forth a line, which is the first quantitie, and next to a point. A line mouing produceth a superficies, which is the second quantitie, and next vnto a line. And last of all, a superficies mouing bringeth forth a solide or body, which is the third &amp; last quantitie. These thinges well marked, it shall not be very hard to attaine to the right vnderstanding of this definition. Vpon the line AB being the diameter, describe a

                  
semicircle ACB, whose

centre let be D: the diameter AB being sixed on his endes or
                     •
                   pointes, imagine the whole superficies of the semicircle to moue round from some one point assigned, till it returne to the same point againe. So shall it produce a perfect Sphere or Globe, the forme whereof you see in a ball or bowle. And it is fully round and solide, for that it is described of a semicircle which is perfectly round, as our countrey man Iohannes de Sacro Busco in his booke of the Sphere,

                   of this definition which he taketh out of Euclide, doth well collecte. But it is to be noted and taken heede of, that none be deceaued by the definition of a Sphere geuen by Iohannes de Sacro Busco: A Sphere (sayth he) is the passage or mouing of the circumference of a semicircle, till it returne vnto the place where it beganne, which agreeth not with Euclide. Euclide plainly sayth, that a Sphere is the passage or motion of a semicircle, and not the passage or motion of the circumference of a semicircle: neither can it be true that the circumference of a semicircle, which is a line, should describe a body. It was before noted that euery quantitie moued, describeth and produceth the quantitie next vnto it. Wherefore a line moued can not bring forth a body, but a superficies onely. As if ye imagine a right line fastened at one of his endes to moue about from some one point till it returne to the same againe, it shall describe a plaine superficies, namely, a circle. So also if ye likewise conceaue of a crooked line, such as is the circumference of a semicircle, that his diameter fastened on both the endes it should moue from a point assigned till it returne to the same againe, it should describe &amp; produce a 
                     •
                  ound superficies onely, which is the superficies and limite of the Sphere, and should not produce the body and soliditie of the Sphere. But the whole semicircle, which is a superficies, by his motion, as is before said, produceth a body, that is, a perfect Sphere. So see you the errour of this definition of the author of the Sphere: which whether it happened by the author him selfe, which I thinke not: or that that particle was thrust in by some one after him, which is more likely, it it not certaine. But it is certaine, that it is vnaptly put in, and maketh an vntrue definition: which thing is not here spoken, any thing to derogate the author of the booke, which assuredly was a man of excellent knowledge

                  Theodosius in his booke De Sphericis (a booke very necessary for all those which will see the groundes and principles of Geometrie and Astronomie, which also I haue translated into our vulgare tounge, ready to the presse) defineth a Sphere after thys maner: A Sphere is a solide or body contained vnder one superficies, in the midle wherof there is a point, frō which all lines drawen to the circumference are equall. This definition of Theodosius is more essentiall and naturall, then is the other geuen by Euclide. The other did not so much declare the inward nature and substance of a Sphere, as it shewed the industry and knowledge of the producing of a Sphere, and therfore is a causall definition geuen by the cause efficient, or rather a description then a definition. But this definition is very es

But when a circle is defined to be a plaine superficies, in the middest wherof is a point, from which all lines drawen to the circumference therof, are equall: this definition is essentiall and formall, and declareth the very nature of a circle.

For what a circle is in a plaine, that is a Sphere in a Solide. The fulnes and content of a circle is described by the motion of a line moued about: but the circumference therof, which is the limite and border thereof, is described of the end and point of the same line moued about. So the fulnes, content, and body of a Sphere or Globe is described of a semicircle moued about. But the Sphericall superficies, which is the limite and border of a Sphere,

                   is described of the circumference of the same semicircle moued about. And this is the superficies ment in the definition, when it is sayd, that it is contained vnder one superficies, which superficies is called of Iohannes de

               As in the example before geuen in the definition of a Sphere, the line AB, about which his endes being fixed, the semicircle was moued (which line also yet remayneth after the motion ended) is the axe of the Sphere described of that semicircle. Theodosius defineth the axe of a Sphere after this maner.
                     Theodosius diffinition of the axe of a sphere.
                   
                  The axe of a Sphere is a certayne right line drawen by the centre, ending on either side in the superficies of the Sphere, about which being fixed the Sphere is turned. As the line AB in the former example. There nedeth to this definition no other declaration, but onely to consider, that the whole Sphere turneth vpon that line AB, which passeth by the centre D, and is extended one either side to the superficies of the Sphere, wherefore by this definition of Theodosius it is the axe of the Sphere.
            
            
               14 The centre of a Sphere is that poynt which is also the centre of the semicircle.
                     Fourtenth diffinition.
                  
               
               This definition of the centre of a Sphere is geuen as was the other definition of the axe, namely, hauing a relation to the definition of a Sphere here geuen of Euclide: where it was sayd that a Sphere is made by the reuolution of a semicircle, whose diameter abideth fixed. The diameter of a circle and of a semicrcle is all one. And in the diameter either of a circle or of a semicircle is contayned the center of either of them, for that they diameter of eche euer passeth by the centre. Now (sayth Euclide) the poynt which is the center of the semicircle, by whose motion the Sphere was described, is also the centre of the Sphere. As in the example there geuen, the poynt D is the centre both of the semicircle &amp; also of the Sphere. Theodosius geueth as other definition of the centre of a Sphere which is thus.
                     Theodosius diffinition of the center of a sphere.
                   
                  The centre of a Sphere is a poynt with in the Sphere, from which all lines drawen to the superficies of the Sphere are equall. As in a circle being a playne figure there is a poynt in the middest, from which all lines drawen to the circumfrence are equall, which is the centre of the circle: so in like maner with in a Sphere which is a solide and bodely figure, there must be conceaued a poynt in the middest thereof, from which all lines drawen to the superficies thereof are equall. And this poynt is the centre of the Sphere by this definition of Theodosius. Flussas in defining the centre of a Sphere comprehendeth both those definitions in one, after this sort. The centre of a Sphere is a poynt assigned in a Sphere, from which all the lines drawen to the superficies are equall, and it is the same which was also the centre of the semicircle which described the Sphere.
                  
                     Flussas diffinition of the center of a sphere.
                   This definition is superfluous and contayneth more thē nedeth. For either part thereof is a full and sufficient diffinition, as before hath bene shewed. Or ells had Euclide bene insufficient for leauing out the one part, or Theodosius for leauing out the other. Paraduenture Flussas did it for the more explication of either, that the one part might open the other.
            
            
               15 The diameter of a Sphere is a certayne right line drawen by the cētre, and one eche side ending at the superficies of the same Sphere.
                     Fiuetenth diffinition
                  
               
               This definitiō also is not hard, but may easely be couceaued by the definitiō of the diameter of a circle. For as the diameter of a circle is a right line drawne frō one side of the circūfrence of a circle to the other, passing by the centre of the circle: so imagine you a right line to be drawen from one side of the superficies of a Sphere to the other, passing by the center of the Sphere,
                     Difference betwene the diameter &amp; axe of a sphere.
                   and that line is the diameter of the Sphere. So it is not all one to say, the axe of a Sphere, and the diameter of a Sphere. Any line in a Sphere drawen from side to side by the centre is a diameter. But not euery line so drawen by the centre is the axe of the Sphere, but onely one right line about which the Sphere is imagined to be moued
                     •
                   So that the name of a diameter of a Sphere is more general, then is the name of an axe. For euery axe in a Sphere is a diameter of the same: but not euery diameter of a Sphere is an axe of the same. And therefore Flussas setteth a diameter in the definition of an axe as a more generall word 
                     •
                  n this maner. The axe

of a Sphere, is that fixed diameter aboue which the Sphere is moued. A Sphere (as also a circle) may haue infinite diameters, but it can haue but onely one axe.
            
            
               
                  
                     Seuententh diffinition.
                  16 A cone is a solide or bodely figure which is made, when one of the sides of a rectangle triangle, namely, one of the sides which contayne the right angle, abiding fixed, the triangle is moued about, vntill it returne vnto the selfe same place from whence it began first to be moued. Now if the right line which abideth fixed be equall to the other side which is moued about and containeth the right angle: then the cone is a rectangle cone. But if it be lesse, then is it an obtuse angle cone. And if it be greater, thē is it an a cuteangle cone,
               This definition of a Cone is of the nature and condition that the definition of a Sphere was, for either is geuen by the motion of a superficies. There, as to the production of a Sphere was imagined a semicircle to moue round, from some one point till it returned to the same point againe: so here must ye imagine a rectangle triangle to moue about till it come againe to the place where it beganne. Let ABC be a rectangle triangle, hauing

the angle ABC a right angle, which let be contained vnder the lines AB and BC.

Now suppose the side AB, namely, one of the lines which cōtaine the right angle ABC to be fastened, and about it suppose the triangle ABC to be moued from some one poynt assigned till it returne to the same agayne (as vppon the diameter in the definition of a Sphere ye imagined a semicircle to moue about): so shall the solide or body thus described be a perfect Cone. As you may imagine by this figure here set. And the forme of a Cone you may sufficiently conceaue by the figure set in the margent. There are of Cone three kindes, namely, a rectangle Cone, an obtuseangle Cone, and an acute angle Cone, all which were before in the former definitiō defined: Namely, the first kinde after this maner.
               
                  If the right line which abideth fixed, be equall to the other side which moueth ro
                        ••
                     d about, and containeth the right angle, then the Cone is a rectangle Cone.
               
               
                  
                     First kinde of Cones.
                  As suppose in the former example, that the line AB which is fixed, and about which the triangle was moued, and after the motion yet remayneth, be equall to the line BC, which is the other line contayning the right angle, which also is moued about together with the whole triangle
                     •
                   then is the Cone described, as the Cone ADC in this example, a right angled Cone: so called for that the angle at the toppe of the Cone is a right angle. For forasmuch as the lines AB and BC of the triangle ABC are equall, the angle BAC is equall to the angle BCA (by the 5. of the first). And eche of them is the halfe of the right angle ABC (by the 32. of the first). In like sort may it be shewed in the triangle ABD, that the angle 
                     •
                  DA is equall to the angle 
                     •
                  AD, and that eche of them is the halfe of a right angle. Wherefore the whole angle CAD, which is composed of the two halfe right angles, namely, DA
                     •
                   and CA
                     •
                   is a right angle. And so haue ye what is a right angled Cone.
               
                  But if it be lesse, then is it an obtuseangle Cone. As in this example,

the line AB fixed is lesse then the line BC moued about. Wherefore the Cone described of the circumuolution of the triangle ABC about the line A
                     •
                  , is an obtuseangle Cone, for that the angle at the toppe DAC is greater then a right angle. Wherefore it is an obtuseangle. And therefore the Cone is called an obtuse angle Cone.
               
                  
                  And if it be greater, then i

                      an acuteangle Cone. As in

this figure, the line AB fastened, is greater then the line BC moued about. Wherefore the Cone described by the motion and turning of the triangle ABC about AB is an acuteangle Cone, hauing the angle at the toppe BAC an acute angle. Of whome the Cone is called an acuteangle Cone. For the easier sight &amp; cōsideration of all these kindes of Cones, and also for the plainer demonstration of the varieties of their angles in their toppes, I haue described them all three in one playne figure, of which the Cone ACB is a right angled Cone, hauyng his fixed side CF equall to the line FB, and hys angle ACB a right angle: the Cone AEB is an obtuse angle Cone, and ADB an acuteangle Cone. By which figure ye may easily demonstrate (by the 21. of the first) that the angle ADB of the Cone ADB, whose fixed line DF is greater then the side FB, is lesse then the right angle ACB, and so is an acute angle. And also (by the same 21. of the first) ye shall with like facilitie perceaue how the angle AEB of the Cone AEB whose fixed line EF is lesse then the side FB, is greater then the right angle ACB: and therefore is an obtuse angle.
               This figure of a Cone is of Campane, of Vitellio, and of others which haue written in these latter times, called a round Pyramis,
                     A Cone called of Campane a ro

                   which is not so aptly. For a Pyramis, and a Cone, are farre distant, &amp; of sundry natures. A Cone is a regular body produced of one circumuolution of a rectangle triangle, and limited and bordered with one onely round superficies. But a Pyramis is terminated and bordered with diuers superficieces. Therefore can not a Cone by any iust reason beare the name of a Pyramis. This solide of many is called Turbo, which to our purpose may be Englished a Top or Ghyg: and moreouer, peculiarly Campane calleth a Cone the Pyramis of a round Columne, namely, of that Columne which is produced of the motion of a parallelogramme (contained of the lines AB and BC) moued about, the line AB being fixed. Of which Columnes shall be shewed hereafter.
            
            
               17 The axe of a Cone is that line, which abideth fixed, about which the triangle is moued.
                     Seuententh diffinition.
                   And the base of the Cone is the circle which is described by the right line which is moued about.
               As in the example the line AB is supposed

to be the line about which the right angled triangle ABC (to the production of the Cone) was moued: and that line is here of Euclide called the axe of the Cone described. The base of the Cone is the circle which is described by the right line which is moued about. As the line AB was fixed and slayed, so was the line BC (together with the whole triangle ABC) moued and turned about. A line moued, as hath bene sayd before, produceth a superficies: and because the line BC is moued about a point, namely, the point B, being the end of the axe of the Cone AB, it produceth by his motion, and reuolution a circle, which circle is the base of the Cone: as in this example, the circle CDE.
               
               
                  The line which produceth the base of the Cone, is the line of the triangle which together with the axe of the Cone contayneth the right angle. The other side also of the triangle, namely, the line AC, is moued about also with the motion of the triangle, which with his reuolution describeth also a superficies,
                     A conicall superficies.
                   which is a round superficies, &amp; is erected vpon the base of the Cone, &amp; endeth in a point, namely, in the higher part or toppe of the Cone. And it is commonly called a Conicall superficies.

parallelogrāme hauing one of his sides contayning

the right angle fixed from some one poynt till it returne to the same agayne where it began. As suppose ABCD to be a rectangle parallelogramme, hauing his side AB fastned, about which imagine the whole parallelogramme to be turned, till it returne to the poynt where it began, then is that solide or body, by this motion described, a Cylinder: which because of his roundnes can not at full be described in a playne superficies, yet haue you for an example thereof a sufficient designation therof in the margent

                  19 The axe of a cilinder is that right line which abydeth fixed, about which the parallelogramme is moued. And the bases of the cilinder are the circles described of the two opposite sides which are moued about.
               Euen as in the description of a Sphere the line fastened was the axe of the Sphere pro

                  uced: and in the description of a cone, the line fastened was the axe of the cone brought forth: so in this description of a cilinder the line abiding, which was fixed, about which the rectangle parallelogramme was moued is the axe of that cilinder. As in this example is the line AB. The bases of the cilinder

In the reuolution of a parallelogramme onely one side is fixed, therefore the three other sides are moued about: of which the two sides which with the axe make right angles, and which also are opposite sides, in their motion describe eche of them a circle, which two circles are called the bases of the cilinder. As ye see in the figure before put two circles described of the motiō of the two opposit lines AD and BC, which are the bases of the Cilinder.

                  The other line of the rectangle parallelogramme moued, by his motion describeth the round superficies about the Cilinder. As the third line or side of a rectangle triangle by his motion described the round Conical superficies about the Cone. And as the circūferēce of the semicircle described the round sphericall superficies about the Sphere. In this example it is the superficies described of the line DC.
               
                  
                     Corollary.
                  By this definition it is playne that the two circles, or bases of a cilinder are euer equall and parallels: for that the lines moued which produced them remayned alwayes equall and parallels. Also the axe of a cilinder is euer an erected line vnto either of the bases. For with all the lines described in the bases, and touching it, it maketh right angles,

So that a Cube is such a solide whose three dimensions are equall, the length is equall to the breadth thereof, and eche of them equall to the depth. Here is as it may be in a playne superficies set an image therof, in these two figures wherof the first is as it is commonly described in a playne, the second (which is in the beginning of the other side of this leafe) is drawn as it is described by arte vpō a playne superficies to shew somwhat bodilike. And in deede the latter descriptiō is for the sight better thē the first. But the first for the demōstrations of Euclides propositions in the fiue bookes following is of more vse, for that in it may be considered and sene

all the fixe sides of the Cube. And so any lines or sections drawen

in any one of the sixe sides. Which can not be so wel sene in the other figure described vpon a playnd. And as touching the first figure (which is set at the ende of the other side of this leafe) ye see that there are sixe parallelogrammes which ye must conceyue to be both equilater and rectangle, although in dede there can be in this description onely two of them rectangle, they may in dede be described al equilater. Now if ye imagine one of the sixe parallelogrammes, as in this example, the parallelogramme ABCD to be the base lieng vpon a ground playne superfices. And so conceiue the parallelogramme EFGH to be in the toppe ouer it, in such sort, that the lines AE, CG, DH, &amp; BF may be erected perpendicularly from the pointes A, C, B, D, to the ground playne superficies or square ABCD. For by this imagination this figure wil shew vnto you bodilike. And this imagination perfectly had, wil make many of the propositions in these fiue bookes following, in which are required to be described such like solides (although not all cubes) to be more plainly and easily conceiued.

                  22 A Tetrahedron is a solide which is contained vnder fower triangles equall and equilater.
               A forme of this solide ye may see in these two examples here set,

whereof one is as it is commonly described in a playne. Neither is it hard to conceaue. For (as we before taught in a Pyramis) if ye imagine the triangle BCD to lie vpon a ground plaine superficies, and the point A to be pulled vp together with the lines AB, AC, and AD, ye shall perceaue the forme of the Tetrahedron to be contayned vnder 4. triangles, which ye must imagine to be al fower equilater and equiangle, though they can not so be drawen in a plaine. And a Tetrahedron thus described, is of more vse in these fiue bookes following, then is the other, although the other appeare in forme to the eye more bodilike.
                     A Tetrahedron one of the fiue regular bodyes.
                  
               
               Why this definition is here left out both of Campane and of Flussas,
                  
I can not but maruell, considering that a Tetrahedron, is of all Philosophers counted one of the fiue chiefe solides which are here defined of Euclide, which are called cōmonly regular bodies, without mencion of which, the entreatie of these should seeme much maimed: vnlesse they thought it sufficiently defined vnder the definition of a Pyramis,
                     Di
                           ••
                        erence betwene a Tetrahedron and a Piramis.
                   which plainly and generally taken, includeth in deede a Tetrahedron, although a Tetrahedron properly much differe
                     •
                  h from a Pyramis, as a thing speciall or a particular, from a more generall. For so taking it, euery Tetrahedron is a Pyramis, but not euery Pyramis is a Tetrahedron. By the generall definition of a Pyramis, the superficieces of the sides may be as many in number as ye list, as 3.4. 5.6. or moe, according to the forme of the base, whereon it is set, whereof before in the definition of a Pyramis were examples geuen. But in a Tetrahedron the superficieces erected can be but three in number according to the base therof, which is euer a triangle. Againe, by the generall definition of a Pyrami
                     •
                  , the superficieces erected may ascend as high as ye list, but in a Tetrahedron they must all be equall to the base. Wherefore a Pyramis may seeme to be more generall then a Tetrahedron, as before a Prisme seemed to be more generall then a Parallelipipedon, or a sided Columne: so that euery Parallelipipedon is a Prisme, but not euery Prisme is a Parallelipipedon. And euery axe in a Sphere is a diameter: but not euery diameter of a Sphere is the axe therof. So also noting well the definition of a Pyramis, euery Tetrahedron may be called a Pyramis, but not euery Pyramis a Tetrahedron. And in dede Psellus in numbring of these fiue solides or bodies, calleth a Tetrahedron a Pyramis in manifest wordes.
                     Psellus calleth a Tetrahedron a Piramis.
                   This I say might make Flussas &amp; others (as I thinke it did) to omitte the definition of a Tetrahedron in this place, as sufficiently comprehended within the definition of a Pyramis geuen before. But why then did he not count that de
                     •
                  inition of a Pyramis faultie, for that it extendeth it selfe to large, and comprehendeth vnder it a Tetrahedron (which differeth from a Pyramis by that it is contayned of equall triangles) as he not so aduisedly did before the definition of a Prisme.
            
            
               
                  
                     Twenty three definition.
                  23 An Octohedron is a solide or bodily figure cōtained vnder eight equall and equilater triangles.
               
                  As a Cube is a solide figure contayned vnder sixe superficiall figures

of foure sides or squares which are equilater, equiangle, and equall the one to the other: so is an Octohedron a solide figure contained vnder eight triangles which are equilater and equall the one to the other. As ye may in these two figures here set beholde. Whereof the first is drawen according as this solide is commonly described vpon a plaine superficies. The second is drawen as it is described by arte vpon a plaine, to shewe bodilike. And in deede although the second appeare to the eye more bodilike, yet as I before noted in a Cube, for the vnderstanding of diuers Propositions in these fiue bookes following, is the first description of more vse yea &amp; of necessitie. For without it, ye can not cōceaue the draught of lines and sections in any one of the eight sides which are sometimes in the descriptions of some of those Propositions required. Wherefore to the consideration of this first description, imagine first that vppon the vpper face of the superficies of the parallelogramme ABCD, be described a Pyramis, hauing his fower triangles AFB, AFC, CFD, and DFB, equilater and equiangle, and concurring in the point F. Thē cōceaue that on the lower face of the super
                     •
                  icies of the former parallelogramme be described an other Pyramis, hauing his fower triangles AEB, AEC, CED, &amp; DEB, equilater and equiangle, and concurring in the point E. For so although somewhat grosly by reason the triangles can not be described equilater, you may in a plaine perceaue the forme of this solide, and by that meanes conceaue any lines or sections required to be drawen in any of the sayd eight triangles which are the sides of that body.
            
            
               24 A Dodecahedron is a solide or bodily figure cōtained vnder twelue equall, equilater,

                   and equiangle Pentagons.
               As a Cube, a Tetrahedron, and an Octohedron,

are contayned vnder equall plaine figures, a Cube vnder squares, the other two vnder triangles: so is this solide figure contained vnder twelue equilater, equiangle, and equall Pentagons, or figures of fiue sides. As in these two figures here set you may perceaue. Of which the first (which thinge also was before noted of a Cube, a Tetrahedron, and an Octohedron) is the common description of it in a plaine, the other is the description of it by arte vppon a plaine to make it to appeare somwhat bodilike. The first description in deede is very obscure to conceaue, but yet of necessitie it must so, neyther can it otherwise, be in a plaine described to vnderstād those Propositions of Euclide in these fiue bokes a following which concerne the same. For in it although rudely, may you see all the twelue Pentagons, which should in deede be all equall, equilater, and equiangle. And now how you may somewhat conceaue the first figure described in the plaine to be a body. Imagine first the Pentagon ABCDE 
                     •
                  o be vpon a ground plaine superficies, then imagine the Pentagon FGHKL to be on high opposite vnto the Pentagon ABCDE. And betwene those two Pentagons there will be ten Pentagons pulled vp, fiue frō the fiue sides of the ground Pentagon, namely, from the side AB the Pentagon ABONM, from the side BC the Pentagon BCQPO, from the side CD the Pentagon CDSRQ, from the side DE, the Pentagon DEVTS, from the side EA the Pentagon EAMXV, the other fiue Pentagons haue eche one of their sides common with one of the sides of the Pentagon FGHKL, which is opposite vnto the Pentagon in the ground superficies: namely, these are the other fiue Pentagons FGNMX, GHPON, HKRQP, KLRST, LFXVT.

So here you may behold twelue Pentagons, which if you imagine to be equall, equilater, &amp; equiangle, and to be lifted vp, ye shall (although somewhat rudely) conceaue the bodily forme of a Pentagon. And some light it will geue to the vnderstanding of certaine Propositions of the fiue bookes following concerning the same.
            
            
               
                  
                     Twenty fiue diffinition.
                  25 An Icosahedron is a solide or bodily figure contained vnder twentie equall and equilater triangles.
               As the solides before last mentioned are all

described by the number and forme of the superficieces which containe them: so this body likewise is de

                  ined by that that it is contayned of twentie triangles equall, equilater, and equiangle. And although this solide also be very hard to conceaue, as it is commonly described vpon a plaine (an example wherof you haue in the first figure here set): yet is it of necessitie that in that forme it be described, if we will vnderstand such descriptions as are set forth of Euclide touching that body in the fiue bookes following. Howbeit you may by it (although somewhat rudely) see the 20. triangles, which are imagined to be equall, equilater, and equiangle, if you consider 
                     •
                  iu: angles of fiue triangles to concurre together at a point. And forasmuch as there are in this solide 20. triangles, and euery t
                     •
                  iangle hath three angles, the concurse of the said triangles will be in twelue pointes. As in this example the pointes of the concurse are A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, K, L, M, &amp; N. Where note that in this plaine the two poyntes M and N are but one point, yet must ye imagine one of those pointes to be erected vpward, and the other downward. Now the 
                     •
                  iue triangles which concurre in the point M, are these, BMD, DMF, FMH, HML, and LMB: the fiue triangles which concurre in the point N, and are imagined to be erected downward, are these, ANC, CNE, ENG, GNK, and KNA: the other ten triangles which include this body, are these, ABC, BCD, CDE, DEF, EFG, FGH, GHK, HKL, KLA, LAB. The second figure here appeareth more bodilike vnto the eye.
               These 
                     •
                  iue solides now last defined, namely, a Cube, a Tetrahedrō, an Octohedron, a Dodecahedron and an Icosahedrō are called regular bodies.
                     Fiue regular bodies.
                   As in plaine superficieces, those are called regular figures, whose sides and angles are equal, as are equilater triangles, equilater pentagons, hexagons, &amp; such lyke, so in solides such only are counted and called regular, which are cōprehēded vnder equal playne superficieces, which haue equal sides and equal angles, as all these fiue foresayd haue, as manifestly appeareth by their definitions, which were all geuen by this proprietie of equalitie of their superficieces, which haue also their sides and angles equall. And in all the course of nature there are no other bodies of this condition and perfection, but onely these fiue. Wherfore they haue euer of the auncient Philosophers bene had in great estimation and admiration, and haue bene thought worthy of much contemplacion, about which they haue bestowed most diligent study and endeuour to searche out the natures &amp; properties of them. They are as it were the ende and perfection of all Geometry, for whose sake is written whatsoeuer is written in Geometry. They were (as men say) first inuented by the most witty Pithagoras then afterward set forth by the diuine Plato, and last of all meruelously taught and declared by the most excellent Philosopher Euclide in these bookes following, and euer since wonderfully embraced of all learned Philosophers.
                     The dignity of these bodies.
                   The knowledge of them containeth infinite secretes of nature. Pithag

                   declaration of their diffinitions.
               After all these diffinitions here set of Euclide, Flussas hath added an other diffinition, which 
                     〈◊〉
                   of a Parallelipipedon, which bicause it hath not hitherto of Euclide in any place bene defined, and because it is very good and necessary to be had, I thought good not to omitte it, thus it is.
            
            
               A parallelipipedon is a solide figure comprehended vnder foure playne quadrangle figures,
                     Diffinition of a parallelipipedon.
                   of which those which are opposite are parallels.
               As in playne superficieces a parallelogramme is that which is contained

vnder foure sides beyng lines, and whose opposite sides are equidistant and parallel lynes, so in solide figures a Parallelipipedon is that solide which is contayned vnder foure quadrangle superficieces, whose opposite sides are also parallels, as it is easily to be sene and conceaued in a cube or die, all whose opposite sides are parallel superficieces, &amp; so of others like, ye may also somewhat conceiue therof by the example in the margent.
               There is also in these bookes following, mencion made of solides, whose two bases are Poligonon figures, lyke, equall, equilater, and parallels, and the sides set vpon the bases are parallelogrammes: which kynde of solides Campane calleth sided Columnes (and which as was before noted, may be cōpreded vnder the definition of a Prisme) a forme wherof although grosely

                   behold in this example, whose bases are two like equall, equilater, equiangle, and parallel hexagons, and the sides set vppon those bases are sixe parallelogrāmes: ye may better cōceiue the forme therof by

the figure put vnder the figure of the parallelipipedon, which apeareth more bodilike. There may of these be infinite formes according to the diuersitie of their bases.
               Because these fiue regular bodies here defined are not by these figures here set, so fully and liuely expressed, that the studious beholder can throughly according to their definitions conceyue them. I haue here geuen of them other descriptions drawn in a playne, by which ye may easily attayne to the knowledge of them. For if ye draw the like formes in matter that wil bow and geue place, as most aptly ye may do in fine pasted paper, such as pastwiues make womēs pastes of, &amp; thē with a knife cut euery line finely, not through, but halfe way only, if thē ye bow and bende them accordingly, ye shall most plainly and manifestly see the formes and shapes of these bodies, euen as their definitions shew.

So also if part of the triangle EBC, namely, the part EFG be in the ground superficies and the residue be in an other, then also one part of eche of the right lines EC and EB shall be in the ground superficies, &amp; an other part in an other superficies, which (by the first of the eleuenth) is proued to be impossible. Wherfore the triangle EBC is in one and the selfe same playne superficies. For in what superficies the triangle BCE is, in the same also is either of the lines EC and EB, and in what superficies either of the lines EC and EB is, in the selfe same also are the lines AB and CD.

                  Construction. is also erected perpendicular to the plaine superficies which passeth by the lines AB and CD. Let these lines AE, EB, EC, and ED be put equall the one to the other. And by the poynt E extend a right line at all auentures, and let the same be GEH. And drawe these right lines AD, CB, FA, FG, FD, FC, FH, and FB.
                  Demonstration. And forasmuch as these two right lines AE &amp; ED are equall to these two lines CE and EB, and they comprehend equall angles (by the 15. of the first): therefore (by the 4. of the first) the base AD is equall to the base CB, and the triangle AED is equall to the triangle CEB. Wherefore also the angle DAE, is equall to the angle EBC. But the angle AEG is equall to the angle BEH (by the 15 of the first). Wherefore there are two triangles AGE, and BEH hauing two angles of the one equall to two angles of the other, eche to his correspondent angle, and one side of the one equall to one side of the other, namely one of the sides which lye betwene the equall angles, namely, the side AE is equall to the side EB. Wherefore (by the 26. of the first) the sides remayning are equall to the sides remayning. Wherefore the side GE is equall to the side EH, and the side AG to the side BH. And forasmuch as the line AE is equall to the line EB, and the line FE is common to them both,

and maketh with them right angles, wherefore (by the fourth of the first) the base FA it equall to the base FB. And (by the same reason) the base FC is equall to the base FD. And forasmuch as the line AD is equall to the line BC, and the line FA is equall to the line FB as it hath bene proued. Therefore these two lines FA and AD are equall to these two lines FB &amp; BC, the one to the other, &amp; the base FD is equall to the base FC. Wherfore also the angle FAD is equall to the angle FBC. And againe forasmuch as it hath bene proued, that the line AG is equall to the line BH, but the line FA is equall to the line FB. Wherefore there are two lines FA and AG equall to two lines FB and BH and it is proued that the angle FAG is equall to the angle FBH: wherefore (by the 4. of the first) the base FG is equal to the base FH. Agayne forasmuch as it hath bene proued that the line GE is equal to the line EH, and the line EF is common to them both: wherefore these two lines GE and EF are equall to these two lines HE and EF, and the base FH is equall to the base FG: wherefore the angle GEF is equall to the angle HEF. Wherefore either of the angles GEF, and HEF is a right angle. Wherefore the line EF is erected, from the point E, perpendicularly to the line GH. In like sort may we proue, that the same line FE maketh right angles with all the right lines which are drawne vpon the ground playne superficies and touch the point B. But a right line is then erected perpendicularly to a plaine superficies, when it maketh right angles with all the lines which touch it, and are drawne vpon the ground playne superficies (by the 2. definition of the eleuenth). Wherefore the right line FE is erected perpendicularly to the ground playne superficies. And the ground plaine superficies is that which passeth by these right lines AB and CD. Wherefore the right line FE is erected perpendicularly to the playne superficies which passeth by the right lines AB and CD. If therefore from two right lines cutting the one the other and at their common section a right line be perpendicularly erected: it shall also be erected perpendicularly to the plaine superficies by the sayd two lines passing: which was required to be proued.
               
                  In this figure you may most euidently conceaue the former

proposition and demonstration, if ye erect perpendicularly vnto the ground playne superficies ACBD the

               ¶The 5. Theoreme. The 5. Proposition. If vnto three right lines which touch the one the other, be erected a perpendicular line from the common point where those three lines touch: those three right lines are in one and the selfe same plaine superficies.
               SVppose that vnto these three right lines BC, BD, and BE, touching the one the other in the poynt B, be erected perpendicularly from the poynt B, the line AB. Then I say, that those thre right lines BC, BD and BE, are in one &amp; the selfe same plaine superficies. For if not, then if it be possible, let the lines BD &amp;

                  BE be in the ground superficies, and let the line BC be erected

vpward (now the lines AB and BC are in one and the same playne superficies (by the 2. of the eleuenth) for they touch the one the other in the point B). Extend the plaine superficies wherein the lines AB and BC are,Demonstration leading to an impossibilitie. and it shall make at the length a common section with the ground superficies, which common section shall be a right line (by the 3. of the eleuenth): let that common section be the line BF. Wherefore the three right lines AB, BC, and BF are in one and the selfe same superficies, namely, in the superficies wherein the lines AB and BC are. And forasmuch as the right line AB is erected perpendicularly to either of these lines BD and BE, therefore the line AB is also (by the 4. of the eleuenth) erected perpendicularly to the plaine superficies, wherein the lines BD and BE are. But the superficies wherein the lines BD and BE are is the ground superficies. Wherefore the line AB is erected perpendicularly to the ground plaine superficies. Wherefore (by the 2. definition of the eleuenth) the line AB maketh right angles with all the lines which are drawne vpon the ground superficies and touch it. But the line BF which is in the ground superficies doth touch it. Wherfore the angle ABF is a right angle. And it is supposed that the angle ABC is a right angle. Wherefore the angle ABF is equall to the angle ABC, and they are in one and the selfe same plaine superficies which is impossible. Wherefore the right line BC is not in an higher superficies. Wherefore the right lines BC, BD, BE are in one and the selfe same plaine superficies. If therefore vnto three right lines touching the one the one the other, be erected a perpendicular line from the common point where those three lines touch: those three right lines are in one and the selfe same plaine superficies: which was required to be demonstrated.

                  SVppose that these two right lines AB and CD be erected perpendicularly to a ground plaine superficies. Then I say that the line AB is a parallel to the line CD.

                     •
                   and by the same reason also either of the angles CDB, &amp; CDE is a right angle. And forasmuch as the line AB is equall to the line DE, and the line BD is common to them both, therfore these two lines AB and BD, are equall to these two lines ED and DB, and they contayne right angles: wherefore (by the 4. of the first) the base AD is equall to the base BE. And forasmuch as the line AB is equall to the line DE, and the line AD to the line BE, therefore these two lines AB and BE are equall to these two lines ED and DA, and the line AE is a common base to them both. Wherefore the angle ABE is (by the 8. of the first) equal to the angle EDA. But the angle ABE is a right angle: whefore also the angle EDA is a right angle: wherfore the line ED is erected perpēdicularly to the line DA: and it is also erected perpēdicularly to either of these lines BD and DC, wherefore the line ED is vnto these three right lines BD, DA, and DC erected perpendicularly from the poynt where these three right lines touch the one the other: wherefore (by the 5. of the eleuenth) these three right lines BD, DA, and DC are in one and the selfe same superficies. And in what superficies the lines BD and DA are, in the selfe same also is the line BA: for euery triangle is (by the 2. of the eleuenth) in one and the selfe same superficies. Wherefore these right lines AB, BD, and DC are in one and the selfe same superficies, and either of these angles ABD and BDC is a right angle (by supposition). Wherefore (by the 28. of the first) the line AB is a parallel to the line CD. If therefore two right lines be erected perpendicularly to one and the selfe same playne superficies, those right lines are parallels the one to the other: which was required to be proued.
               
                  Here for the better vnderstanding of this 6. proposition I

haue described an other figure: as touching which if ye erect the superficies ABD perpendicularly to the superficies BDE, and imagine only a line to be drawne from the poynt A to the poynt E (if ye will ye may extend a thred from the saide poynt A to the poynt E) and so compare it with the demonstration, it will make both the proposition, and also the demonstration most cleare vnto you.

as the right line AB, from the poynt

                  A Corollary added by M. Dee.
                  
                  
                     Hereby it is euident that any two right lines perpendicularly erected to one and the selfe same  playne superficies, are also them selues in one and the same playne superficies, which is likewis

Therfore some other helpe must be put into the handes of young beginners, how to bring this probleme to execution: which is this, most playne and briefe. Vnderstand that BD the right line, is the common section of the playne superficies, wherein the perpendiculars AB and CD are, &amp; of the other playne superficies, to which they are perpendiculars.

                     ll to BF, therefore by the 1. common sentence, DE is put equall to AB: which was required to be done.
                  In like sort, if DE were a line geuen to whome AB

were to be cutte and made equall, first out of the line DB (su

And though this be easy to conceaue, yet I haue designed the figure accordingly, wherby you may instruct your imagination. Many such helpes are in this booke requisite, as well to enforme the young studentes therewith, as also to master the froward gaynesayer of our conclusion, or interrupter of our demonstrations course.

Then I say, that a right line drawen from the point E to the point F, is in the selfe same plaine superficies that the parallel lines are. For if not, then if it be possible,

let it be in an higher superficies,Demonstration leading to an impossibilitie. as the line EGF is, and draw the superficies wherin the line EGF is, &amp; extend it, and it shall make a common section with the ground superficies, which section shall (by the 3. of the eleuenth) be a right line: let that section be the right line EF. Wherefore two right lines EGF and EF include a superficies: which (by the last common sentence) is impossible. Wherfore a right line drawen from the point E to the point F, is not in an higher superficies. Wherfore a right line drawen from the point E to the point F, is in the selfe same superficies wherein are the parallel right lines AB and CD. If therefore there be two parallel right lines, and in either of them be taken a point at all aduentures, a right line drawen by th

Wherfore either of these angles ABD &amp; ABE is a right angle. And forasmuch as vpon these parallel lines AB and CD falleth a certaine right line BD, therefore (by the 29. of the first) the angles ABD and CDB are equal to two right angles. But the angle ABD is a right angle, wherfore also the angle CDB is a right angle. Wherfore the line CD is erected perpendic

For by the 29. of the first, the angle CDB being equall to the angle ABD is a right angle. Wherefore the line CD is from the point D erected perpendicularly to two right lines DE and DB cutting the one the other in the point D. Wherfore by the 4. of the eleuenth, the line CD is erected perpendiculaaly to the plaine superficies, wherein are the lines DE and DB. But

the ground plaine superficies is that wherin are the lines DE and DB, to which superficies also the line AB is supposed to be erected perpendiculerly. Wherefore the line CD is erected perpendicularly to the ground plaine superficies, wherunto the line AB is erected perpendicularly. If therfore there be two parallel right lines, of which one is erected perpendicularly to a ground plaine superficies, the other also is erected perpendicularly to the selfe same ground plaine superficies: which was required to be demonstrated.
               
                  This figure will more clearely set forth the former demonstration,

if ye erect perpendicularly the superficies ABD to the superficies BDE, and imagine a lyne to be drawen from the point A to the point D, in stede wherof, as in the 6. proposition ye may extende a threede.

EF is erected perpendiculerly to either of the lines GH and GK, therfore (by the 4. of the eleuenth) the line EF is erected perpendicularly to the superficies wherein the lines GH and GK are, but the line EF is a parallel line to the line AB. Wherfore (by t

right lines AD, CF, BE, AC, and DF.Demonstration. And forasmuch as the line BA is equall to the line ED, and also parallell vnto it, therefore (by the 33. of the first) the line AD is equall and parallell to the line BE: and by the same reason also the line CF is equall &amp; parallell to the line BE. Wherfore either of these lines AD and CF is equall &amp; parallell to the line EB. But right lines which are parallells to one and the selfe same right line, and are not in the selfe same superficies with it, are also (by the 9. of the eleuenth) parallells the one to the other. Wherefore the line AD is a parallell line to the line CF. And the lines AC and DF ioyne them together. Wherefore (by the 33. of the first) the line AC is equall and parallell to the line DF. And forasmuch as these two right lines AB &amp; BC are equall to these two right lines DE and EF, and the base AC also is equall to the base DF: therefore (by the 8. of the first) the angle ABC is equall to the angle DEF.

                     Two cases in this proposition.
                     The first case.
                  SVppose that the point geuen on high be A, and suppose a ground plaine superficies, namely, BCGH. It is required from the point A to draw vnto the ground superficies a perpendicular line. Drawe in the ground superficies a right line at aduentures, and let the same be BC.Iohn Dee. And (by the 12. of the first) from the point A draw vnto the line BC a perpendicular line AD. 
                     This requireth the imagination of a plaine superficies passing by the pointe A, and the straight line BC. And so helpe your selfe in the lyke cases either Mathematically imagining, or Mechanically practising.
                   Now if AD be a perpendicular line to the ground superficies, then is that done which was sought for. But if not, then (by the 11. of the first) from the point D raise vp in the ground superficies vnto the line BC a perpendicular line DE. And (by the 12. of the first) from the point A draw vnto the line DE a perpendicular line AF. And by the point F draw (by the 31. of the

                   And forasmuch as the line BC is erected perpendicularly to either of these lines DE and DA, therefore (by the 4. of the eleuenth) the line BC is erected perpēdicularly to the superficies wherin the lines ED and AD are: and to the line BC the line GH is a parallell. But i
                     •
                   there be two parallell right lines, of which one is erected perpendicularly to a certaine plaine superficies, the other also (by the 8. of the eleuenth) is erected perpendicularly to the selfe same superficies. Wherefore the line GH is erected perpendicularly to the plain
                     •
                   superficies wherein the lines ED and DA are. Wherfore also (by the 2. definition of the eleuenth) the line GH is erected perpendicularly to all the right lines which touch it, and are in the plaine superficies wherein the lines ED and AD are. But the line AF toucheth it being in the superficies wherein the lines ED and AD are (by the 
                     •
                  . of this booke). Wherefore the line GH is erected perpendicularly to the line FA. Wherefore also the line FA is erected perpendicularly to the line GH: and the line AF is also erected perpendicularly to the line DE. Wherefore AF is erected perpendicularly to either of these lines HG and DE. But if a right line be erected perpendicularly from the common section of two right lines cutting the one the other, it shall also be erected perpendicularly to the plaine superficies of the said two lines (by the 4. of the eleuenth). Wherefore the line AF is erected perpendicularly to that superficies wherin the lines ED and GH are. But the superficies wherein the lines ED and GH are, is the ground superficies. Wherefore the line AF is erected perpendicularly to the ground superficies. Wherfore from a point geuen on high, namely, frō the point A, is drawen to the ground superficies a perpendicular line: which was required to be done.
               
                  In this figure shall ye much more plainely see both

the cases of this former demonstratiō. For as touching the first case, ye must erecte perpendicularly to the ground superficies, the superficies wherein is drawen the line AD, and compare it with the demonstration, and it will be clere vnto you. For the second case ye must erecte perpendicularly vnto the ground superficies the superficies wherein is drawen the line AF, and vnto it let the other superficies wherein is drawen the line AD, incline, so that the point A of the one may concurre with the point A of the other: and so with your figure thus ordered, compare it with the demonstration, and there will be in it no hardnes at all.

And forasmuch as the line BG is erected perpendicularly to the superficies wherein are the lines DE and EF, there

                  ore (by the 2. definition of the eleuenth) it is also erected perpendicularly to all the right lines which touch it, and are in the selfe same superficies wherein are the lines DE

and EF. But either of these lines GH and GK touch it, and

are also in the superficies wherein are the lines DE and EF, therefore either of these angles BGH, and BGK, is a right angle. And forasmuch as the line BA is a parallell to the line GH (that the lines GH and GK are parallells vnto the lines AB and BC it is manifest by the 9. of this booke): therefore (by the 29. of the first) the angles GBA and BGH are equall to two right angles. But the angle BGH is (by constructiō) a right angle, therfore also the angle GBA is a right angle: therefore the line GB is erected perpendicularly to the line BA. And by the same reason also may it be proued, that the line BG is erected perpendicularly to the line BC. Now forasmuch as the right line BG is erected perpendicularly to these two right lines BA and BC touching the one the other, therefore (by the 4. of the eleuenth) the line BG is erected perpendicularly to the superficies wherein are the lines BA and BC
                     •
                   And it is also erected perpendicularly to the superficies wherein are the lines GH and GK. But the superficies wherein are the lines GH and GK, is that superficies wherein are the lines DE and EF: wherefore the line BG is erected perpendicularly to the superficies wherein are the lines DE and EF. Wherefore the line BG is erected perpendicularly to the superficies wherein are the lines DE and EF, and to the superficies wherein are the lines AB and BC. But if one and the selfe same right line be erected perpendicularly to plaine superficieces, those superficieces are (by the 14. of the eleuenth) parallels the one to the other. Wherefore the superficies wherin are the lines AB and BC is a par
                     •
                  llel to the superficies wherin are the lines DE and EF. If therefore two right lines touching the one the other be parallels to two other right lines touching also the one the other, and not being in the selfe same plaine superficies with the two first, the plaine superficieces extended by those right lines are also parallels the one to the other which was required to be demonstrated.
               
                  By this figure here put, ye may more clerely see both

the former 15. Proposition and also the demonstration therof: if ye erecte perpendicularly vnto the ground superficies, the three superficieces ABC, KHE, and LHBM, and so compare it with the demonstration.

the side that the pointes FH, are, or on

the side that the pointes E, G are. First let them be produced on that side that the pointes F, H are, and let them mete in the point K.

                  ositiō they mete not together, for they are supposed to be parallels. Wherfore the right lines EF and GH produced shall not meete together on that side that the pointes F, H are. In like sort also may we proue that the right lines EF and GH produced meete not together on that side that the pointes E, G are. But right lines which being produced on no side mete together, are parallels (by the last definicion of the first). Wherfore the line EF is a parallel to the line GH. If therfore two parallel plaine superficieces be cut by some one plaine superficies their common sections are parallel lines: which was required to be proued.

will more plainly shewe vnto you the former demonstration, if ye erecte perpendicularly to the ground superficies AC the two superficieces AB and BC which cut the one the other in the line BD.

two of those three angles, which two so euer be taken, are greater then the third.
               SVppose that the solide angle A be contayned vnder three playne superficiall angles, that is, vnder BAC, CAD, and DAB. Then I say that two of these superficiall angles how so euer they be taken, are greater then the third. If the angles BAC, CAD, &amp; DAB
                  
be equall the one to the other, then is it manifest that two of them which two so euer be taken are greater then the third. But if not, let the angle BAC be the greater of the three angles. And vnto the right line AB and from the poynt A make in the playne superficies BAC vnto the angle DAB an equall angle BAE. And (by the 2. of the first) make the line AE equall to the line AD. Now a right line BEC drawne by the poynt E, shall cut the right lines AB and AC in the poyntes B and C: draw a right line from D to B, and an other from D to C. And forasmuch as the line DA is equall to the line AE,
                  Demonstration. and the line AB is common to thē both, therefore these two lines DA and AB are equall to these two lines AB and AE and the angle DAB is equall to the angle BAE. Wherefore (by the 4. of the first) the base DB is equall to the base BE. And forasmuch as these two lines DB and DC are greater then the line BC, of which the line DB is proued to be equall to the line BE. Wherefore the residue, namely, the line DC is greater then the residue, namely, then the line EC. And forasmuch as the line DA is equall to the line AE, and the line AC is common to them both, and the base DC is greater then the base EC, therefore the angle DAC is greater then the angle EAC. And it is proued that the angle DAB is equall to the angle BAE: wherfore the angles DAB and DAC are greater then the angle BAC. If therefore a solide angle be contayned vnder three playne superficiall angles euery two of those three angles, which two so euer be taken are greater then the third: which was required to be proued.

                  And forasmuch as the angle B is a solide angle, for it is contayned vnder three superficiall angles, that is, vnder CBA, ABD and CBD, therefore (by the 20. of the eleuenth) two of them which two so euer be taken are greater then the third. Wherefore the angles CBA and ABD are greater

then the angle CBD: and by the same reason the angles BCA and ACD are greater then the angle BCD

                  and moreouer the angles CDA and ADB are greater then the angle CDB. Wherefore these sixe angles CBA, ABD, BCA, ACD, CDA, and ADB are greater thē these thre angles, namely, CBD, BCD, &amp; CDB. But the three angles CBD, BDC, and BCD are equall to two right angles. Wherefore the sixe angles CBA, ABD, BCA, ACD, CDA, and ADB are greater thē two right angles. And forasmuch as in euery one of these triangles ABC, and ABD and ACD three angles are equall two right angles (by the 32. of the first). Wherefore the nine angles of the thre triangles, that is, the angles CBA, ACB, BAC, ACD, DAC, CDA, ADB, DBA and BAD are equall to sixe right angles. Of which angles the sixe angles ABC, BCA, ACD, CDA, ADB and DBA are greater then two right angles. Wherefore the angles remayning, namely, the angles BAC, CAD and DAB which contayne the solide angle are lesse then sower right angles. Wherefore euery solide angle is comprehended vnder playne angles lesse then fower right angles: which was required to be proued.
               
               If ye will more fully see this demonstration compare it with the figure which I put for the better sight of the demonstration of the proposition next going before. Onely here is not required the draught of the line AE.
               Although this demonstration of Euclide be here put for solide angles contayned vnder three superficiall angles, yet after the like maner may you proceede if the solide angle be contayned vnder superficiall angles how many so euer. As for example if it be contayned vnder fower superficiall angles, if ye follow the former construction, the base will be a quadrangled figure, whose fower angles are equall to fower right angles: but the 8. angles at the bases of the 4. triangles set vpon this quadrangled figure may by the 20. proposition of this booke be proued to be greater then those 4. angles of the quadrangled figure: As we sawe by the discourse of the former demonstration. Wherefore those 8. angles are greater then fower right angles: but the 12. angles of those fower triangles are equall to 8. right angles. Wherefore the fower angles remayning at the toppe which make the solide angle are lesse then fower right angles. And obseruing this course ye may proceede infinitely.
            
            
               ¶ The 20. Theoreme. The 22. Proposition. If there be three superficiall plaine angles of which two how soeuer they be taken, be greater then the third, and if the right lines also which contayne those angles be equall: then of the lines coupling those equall right lines together, it is possible to make a triangle.
               SVppose that there be thre superficial angles ABC, DEF, and GHK, of which let two, which two soeuer be taken, be greater then the third, that is, let the angles ABC, and DEF be greater then the angle GHK, and let the angles DEF and GHK be greater then the angle ABC: and moreouer let the angles GHK and ABC be greater then the angle DEF. And let the right lines AB, BC, DE, EF GH, and HK be equall the one to the other, and draw a right line from the point A to the

point C, and an other from the point D to the point F, and moreouer an other from the point G to the point K.Two cases in this proposition. Then I say that it is possible of three right lines equall to the lines AC, DF

and GK, to make a triangle, that is, that two of the right lynes AC, DF, and GK, which two soeuer be taken, are greater then the third. Now if the angles ABC, DEF,The first case. and GHK be equall the one to the other, it is manifest that these right lines AC, DF, and GK being also (by the 4. of the first) equall the one to the other, it is possible of three right lines equall to the lines AC, DF, and GK to make a triangle.Second case.

or bodily angle. Let the lines AB, BC, DE, EF, GH, and HK, be made equall:Construction. and drawe a right line from the point A to the point C, &amp; an other from the point D to the point F, and an other from the point G to the point K. Now (by the 22. of the eleuenth) it is possible of three right lines equall to the right lines AC, DF, and GK, to make a triangle. Make such a triangle, and let the same be LMN,

so that let the line AC be equall to the line LM, and the line DF to the line MN, and the line GK to the line LN. And (by the 5. of the fourth) about the triangle LMN describe a circle LMN, and take (by the 1. of the third) the centre of the same circle,

First let it be within the triangle, and let the same be the point X, &amp; drawe these right lines LX, MX, and NX. Now I say, that the line AB is greater then the line LX.A necessary thing to be proued before he p

                     . For if not, then the line AB is either equall to the line LX, or els it is lesse then it. First let it be equall. And forasmuch as the line AB is equall to the line LX, but the line AB is equall to the line BC, therefore the line LX is equall to the line BC: and vnto the line LX the line XM is (by the 15. definition of the first) equall: wherefore these two lines AB and BC, are equall to these two lines LX and XM the one to the other: and the base AC is supposed to be equall to the base LM. Wherefore (by the 8. of the first) the angle ABC is equall to the angle LXM. And by the same reason also the angle DEF is equall to the angle MXN, and moreouer the angle GHK to the angle NXL. Wherefore these three angles ABC, DEF, and GHK, are equall to these three angles LXM, MXN, &amp; NXL. But the three angles LXM, MXN, and NXL, are equall to fower right angles (as it is manifest to see by the 13. of the first, if any one of these lines MX, LX, or NX, be extended on the side that the point X is). Wherfore the three angles ABC, DEF, and GHK, are also equall to fower right angles. But they are supposed to be lesse then fower right angles: which is impossible. Wherefore the line AB is not equall to the line LX. I say also that the line AB is not lesse then the line LX. For if it be possible, let it be lesse: and (by the 2. of the first) vnto the line AB put an equall line XO: and to the line BC put an equall line XP, and draw a right line from the point O to the point P. And forasmuch as the line AB is equall to the line BC, therefore also the line XO is equall to the line XP. Wherefore the residue OL is equall to the residue MP. Wherfore (by the 2. of the sixt) the line LM is a parallel to the line OP
                     •
                   and the triangle LMX is equiangle to the triangle OPX. Wherefore as the line XL is to the line LM, so is the line XO to the line OP. Wherefore alternately (by the 16. of the fift) as the line LX is to the line XO, so is the line LM to the line OP. But the line LX is greater then the line XO. Wherfore also the line LM is greater then the line OP. But the line LM is put to be equall to the line AC: wherefore also the line AC is greater then the line OP. Now forasmuch as these two right lines AB and BC are equall to these two right lines OX and XP, and the base AC is greater then the base OP, therefore (by the 25. of the first) the angle ABC is greater then the angle OXP. In like sort also may we proue, that the angle DEF is greater then the angle MXN, and that the angle GHK is greater then the angle NXL. Wherefore the three angles ABC, DEF, and GHK, are greater then the three angles LXM, MXN, and NXL. But the angles ABC, DEF, and GHK, are supposed to be lesse then fower right angles: wherefore much more are the angles LXM, MXN, &amp; NXL lesse then fower right angles. But they are also equall to fower right angles: which is impossible. Wherefore the line AB is not lesse then the line LX: and it is also proued that it is not equall vnto it. Wherfore

the line AB is greater then the line LX.
               Now from the point X raise vp vnto the plaine superficies of the circle LMN a perpendicular line XR (by the 12. of the eleuenth). And vnto that which the square of the line AB excedeth the square of the line XL

And forasmuch as vnto that which the square of the line AB excedeth the square of the line LX, the square of the line RX is supposed to be equall, therefore the square of the line AB is equall to the squares of the lines LX and RX. But vnto the squares of the lines LX and XR, the square of the line LR is (by the 47. of the first) equall, for the angle LXR is a right angle. Wherefore the square of the line AB is equall to the square of the line RL. Wherefore also the line AB is equall to the line RL. But vnto the line AB is equall euery one of these lines BC, DE, EF, GH, and HK, and vnto the line RL is equall either of these lines RM and RN. Wherfore euery one of these lines AB, BC, DE, EF, GH, and HK, is equall to euery one of these lines RL, RM, and RN. And forasmuch as these two lines RL and RM are equall to these two lines AB and BC, and the base LM is supposed to be equall to the base AC, therfore (by the 8. of the first) the angle LRM is equall to the angle ABC. And by the same reason also the MRN is equall to the angle DEF, and the angle LRN to the angle GHK. Wherefore of three superficiall angles LRM, MRN, and LRN, which are equall to three superficiall angles geuē, namely, to the angles ABC, DEF, &amp; GHK, is made a solide angle R, comprehended vnder the superficiall angles LRM, MRN, and LRN: which was required to be done.

BC, that is, DE &amp; EF are equall to these two lines

MX and XL, that is, to the line MN. But the line MN is supposed to be equall to the line DF. Wherefore also the lines DE and EF are equall to the line DF: which (by the 20. of the first) is impossible. Wherfore the line AB is not equall to the line LX. In like sort also may we proue, that it is not lesse. Wherefore the line AB is greater then the line LX. And now if as before vnto the plaine superficies of the circle be erected frō the point X a perpendicular line RX whose square let be equall vnto that which the square of the line AB excedeth the square of the line LX, and if the rest of the construction and demonstration be obserued in this that was in the forme

                   other, and the base AC is equall to the base ML. Wherefore (by the 8. of the first) the angle ABC is equall to the angle MXL: and by the same reason also the angle GHK is equall to the angle LXN. Wherefore the whole angle MXN is equall to these two angles ABC and GHK. But the angles ABC and GHK are greater then the angle DEF. Wherefore the angle MXN is greater then the angle DEF. And forasmuch as these two lines DE and EF are equall to these two lines MX and XN, and the base DF is equall to the base MN, therefore (by the 8. of the first) the angle MXN is equall to the angle DEF. And it is proued that it is also greater: which is impossible. Wherefore the line AB is not equall to the line LX. In like sort also may we proue, that it is not lesse. Wherfore the line AB is greater then the line LX. And againe if vnto the plaine superficies of the circle be erected perpendicularly from the point X a line XR, whose square is equall to that which the square of the line AB exceedeth the square of the line LX, and the rest of the construction be done in this that was in the former cases, then shall the Probleme be finished.

                     •
                  , let it be lesse. And vnto the line AB, put (by the 2. of the first) the line XO equall: and vnto the line BC put the line XP equall: And draw a right line from the point O to the point P.

And forasmuch as the line AB is equall to the line BC, therefore the line XO is equall to the line XP. Wherefore the residue OL is equall to the residue MP. Wherefore (by the 2. of the sixt) the line LM, is a parallel to the line PO. And the triangle LXM is equiangle to the triangle PXO. Wherefore (by the 6. of the sixt) as

the line LX is to the line LM, so is the line XO to the line PO. Wherefore alternately (by the 16. of the fift) as the line LX is to the line XO, so is the line LM to the line OP. But the line LX is greater then the line XO. Wherefore also the line LM is greater then the line OP. But the line LM is equall to the line AC. Wherefore also the line AC is greater then the line OP. Now forasmuch as these two lines AB and BC are equall to these two lines OX &amp; XP the one to the other, and the base AC is greater then the base OP, therefore (by the 25. of the first) the angle ABC is greater then the angle OXP. And in like sort if we put the line XR equall to either of these lines XO or XP, and draw a right line frō the point O to the point R, we may proue that the angle GHK is greater then the angle OXR. Vnto the right line LX, and vnto the point in it X, make (by the 23. of the first) vnto the angle ABC an equall angle LXS: and vnto the angle GHK make an equall angle LXT. And (by the second of the first) let either of these lines SX, and XT, be equall to the line OX. And drawe these lines OS, OT, and ST. And forasmuch as these two lines AB and BC are equall to these two lines OX and XS, and the angle ABC is equall to the angle OXS, therefore (by the 4. of the first) the base AC, that is, LM, is equall to the base OS. And by the same reason also the line LN is equall to the line OT. And forasmuch as these two lines LM and LN are equall to these two lines SO and OT, and the angle MLN is greater then the angle SOT, therefore (by the 25. of the first) the base MN is greater then the base ST. But the line MN is equall to the line DF. Wherefore the line DF is greater then the line ST. Now forasmuch as these two lines DE and EF are equall to these two lines SX and XT, and the base DF is greater then the base ST, therefore (by the 25. of the first) the angle DEF is greater then the angle SXT. But the angle SXT is equall to the angles ABC and GHK. Wher

                  fore also the angle DEF is greater then the angles ABC and GHK. But it is also lesse: which is impossible.

describe a semicircle ACB, and from the poynt A apply into the semicircle a right line AC equall to the right line LX: and draw a right line from the poynt C to the poynt B. And forasmuch as in the semicircle ACB is an angle ACB, therefore (by the 31. of the third) the angle ACB is a right angle. Wherefore (by the 47. of the first) the square of the line AB is equall to the squares of the lines AC and CB: wherefore the square of the line AB is in power more then the square of the line AC by the square of the line CB: but the line AC is equall to the line LX, wherefore the square of the line AB is in power more then the square of the line LX by the square of the line CB. If therefore vnto the line CB we make the line XR equall, then is the square of the line AB greater then the square of the line LX by the square of the line XR: which was required to be doone.

                        M. Dee (to auoide cauillation) addeth to Euclides proposition this worde sixe: whome I haue followed accordingly, and not Zamberts, in this.
                     
                     
                        This kinde of body mencioned in the proposition is called a Parallelipipedō according to the di

                   sixe parallel playne superficieces, the opposite plaine superficieces of the same body are equall and parallelogrammes.
               SVppose that this solide body CDHG be contained vnder these 6. parallel plaine superficieces, namely, AC, GF, BG, CE, FB, and AE. Then I say that the opposite superficieces of the same body, are equal and parallelogrāmes, it is to wete, the two opposites AC and GF, and the two opposites BG

and CE, and the two opposites FB and AE to be equall, and al to be parallelogrammes.Demonstration that the opposite sides are parallelogrammes. For forasmuch as two parallel plaine superficieces, that is, BG, and CE are deuided by the plaine superficies AC, their common sections are (by the 16. of the eleuenth) parallels. Wherfore the line AB is a parallel to the line CD. Again
                     •
                   forasmuch as two parallel plaine superficieces FB and AE are deuided by the plaine superficies AC their common sections are by the same proposition, parallels. Wherfore the lyne AD is a parallel to the line BC. And it is also proued, that the line AB is a parallel to the line DC. Wherfore the superficies AC is a parallelogramme. In like sort also may we proue, that euery one of these superficices CE, GF, BG, FB, and AE are parallelogrammes. Draw a right line from the point A, to the point H, and an other from the point D to the point F.Demonstratiō that the opposite superficies are equall. Aud forasmuch as the line AB is proued a parallel to the line CD, and the lyne BH to the line CF, therfore these two right lines AB and BH touching the one the other, are parallels to these two right lines DC and CF touching also the one the other, and not being in one and the selfe same plaine superficies. Wherfore (by the 10. of the eleuenth) they comprehend equall angles. Wherfore the angle ABH is equall to the angle DCF. And forasmuch as these two lines AB and BH are
                     AB is equall to DC, because the superficies AC is proued a parallelogrāme, and by the same reason, is BH equall to CF, because the superficies FB is proued a parallelogramme: therefore the 34. of the first is our proofe.
                   equall to these two lines DC and CF, and the angle ABH is proued equall to the angle DCF
                     •
                   therfore (by the 4. of the first) the base AH is equall to the base DF, and the triangle ABH is equall to the triangle DCF. And forasmuch as (by the 41. of the first) the parallelogramme BG is double to the triangle ABH, and the parallelogramme CE is also double to the triangle DCF, therfore the parallelogramme

BG is equall to the parallelogramme CE. In like sort

also may we proue that the parallelogramme AC is equall to the parallelogramme GF, and the parallelograme AE to the parallelogramme FB. If therfore a solide or body be contained vnder sixe parallel plaine superficieces, the opposite plaine superficieces of the same body are equal &amp; parallelogrammes which was required to be demonstrated.
               
                  I haue for the better helpe of young beginners, described here an other figure whose forme if it be described vpon pasted paper with the letters placed in the same order that it is here, and then if ye cut finely these lines AG, DE and CF not through the paper, and folde it accordingly, compare it with the demonstration, and it will shake of all hardenes from it.
               
            
            
               The 22. Theoreme. The 25. Proposition. If a Parallelipipedō be cutte of a playne superficies beyng a parallel to the two opposite playne superficieces of the same body: then, as the base is to the base, so is the one solide to the other solide.
               SVppose that this solide ABCD being contained

Extēd the line AH on either side, &amp; put vnto ye line EH as many equal lines as you wil, namely, HM, &amp; MN: &amp; likewise vnto the line AE, put as many equal lines as you will, namely, AK &amp; KL, &amp; make perfect these parallelogrāmes LO, KW, HZ, &amp; MS, and likewise make perfect these solides or bodies LP, KR, DM, and MT.Demonstration. And forasmuch as these right lines, LK, KA, and AE are equall the one to the other, therfore these parallelogrammes LO, KW, and AF, are also (by the first of the sixt) equall the one to the other: and so also (by the same) are these parallelogrammes KX, KB, and AG equall the one to the other. And likewise (by the 24. of the eleuenth) are the parallelogrammes LY, KP, and AR, equal, for they are opposite the one to the other. And by the same reason also the parallelogrammes EC, HZ, and MS are equall the one to the other, and the parallelogrammes HG, HI, and IN are equal the one to the other. And moreuer the parallelogrammes DH, MQ, and NT are (by the 24. of the eleuenth) equall the one to the other, for they

are opposite: wherefore three plaine superficies of the solides LP, RK, and AV are equall to three plaine superficies: but vnto eche of these three superficieces are equall the three opposite superficieces (by the 24. of the eleuēth) Wherfore these three solides or bodies LP, KR, and AV, are equal the one to the other, by the 8. definition of the eleuēth. And by the same reason also the three solides, ED, DM &amp; MT are equal the one to the other. Wherfore how multiple x the base LF is, to the base AF, so multiplex is the solide LV to the solide AV. And by the same reason also how multiplex the base NF is to the base FH, so multiplex is the solide NV to the solide HV: so that if the base LF be equall to the base NF, the solide also LV shall be equall to the solide VN, and if the base LF exceede the base NF, the solide also LV shall exceede the solide VN, and if the base LF be lesse then the base NF, the solide also LV shall be lesse then the solide VN (by the 1. and 14. of the fift.) Now then there are foure magnitudes, namely, the two bases AF and FH, and the two solides or bodies AV and VH, of which are takē their equemultiplices, namely, the equemultiplices of the base AF, &amp; of the solide AV, or the base LF, &amp; the solide LV, &amp; the equemultiplices of the base HF, &amp; of the solide HV are the base NF, and the solide NV. And it is proued that if the base LF excede the base NF, the solide also LV excedeth the solide NV, &amp; if it be equal, it is equal, and if it be lesse, it is lesse. Wherfore (by the 6. definitiō of the fift) as the base AF is to the base FH, so is the solide AV to the solide HV. If therfore a parallelipipedon be cut of a playne superficies being a parallel to the two opposite playne superficieces of the same body, then, as the base is to the base, so is the one solide to the other solide: which was required to be proued.

                     stration, you shall see that it will geue great light therunto.
               
               
                  Here Flussas addeth three Corollaries.
               
               
                  First Corollary.

                        ions of the Prisme shall be the one to the other in that proportion, that the sections of the base are the one to the other.
                  
                  
                     For the sections of the bases, which bases (by the 11. definitiō of this booke) are parallelogrammes, shall likewise be parallelogrammes, by the 16. of this booke (when as the superficies which cutteth is parallelel to the opposite super
                        •
                     icieces) and shal also be equiangle. Wherfore if vnto the bases (by producing the right lines) be added like and equall bases, as was before shewed in a parallelipipedon, of those sections shalbe made as many like Prismes as ye will. And so by the same reason, namely, by the commō excesse, equalitie, or want of the multiplices of the bases &amp; of the sections by the 5. definitiō of the fifth may be proued, that euery section of the Prisme multiplyed by any multiplycation whatsoeuer, shall haue to any other section that proportion that the sections of the bases haue.
               
               
                  Second Corollary.

                  Which thing is manifest, for such solides are deuided into Prismes, which haue one cōmon side, namely, the axe or right line, which is drawne by the centers of the opposite bases. Wherefore how many pa

                     allelogrāmes or bases are set vpon the opposite poligonon figures, of so many Prismes shal the whole solide be cōposed. For those poligonon figures are deuided into so many like triangles by the 20. of the sixth, which describe Prismes. Which Prismes being cut by a superficies parallel to the opposite superficieces, the sectiōs of the bases shal (by the former Corollary) be proportional with the sectiōs of the Prismes. Wherefore by the 
                        ••
                      of the fifth, as the sections of the one are the one to the other, so are the sections of the whole the one to the other.
                  Of these solides there are infinite kindes, according to the varietie of the opposite and parallel poligonon figures, which poligonon figures doo alter the angles of the parallelogrammes set vpon them according to the diuersitie o

                      their situation. But this is no let at all to this corollary, for that which we haue proued will alwayes follow. When as the superficieces which are set vpō the opposite like &amp; equal poligonon and parallel superficieces are alwayes parallelogrammes.

And forasmuch as these two lines KA &amp; AB are equall to these two lines GD &amp; DE, the one to the other, and they containe equall

Wherfore the line BH is equall to the line FE. Agayne, forasmuch as these two lines AK and KH are equal to these two lines DG and GF, and they containe right angles. Wherfore ye base AH is (by the 4. of the first) equall to the base DF. And the line AB is equall to the line DE. Wherfore these two lines AB and AH are equall to these two lines FD and DE, and the base BH is equall to the base FE. Wherfore (by the 8. of the first) the angle BAH is equall to the angle EDF. And by the same reason also the angle HKL is equall to the angle FGC. Wherfore if we put these lines AL and DC equall, and draw these right lines KL, HL, GC, and FC: forasmuch as the whole angle BAL is equall to the whole angle EDC, of which the angle BAK is supposed to be equall to the angle EDG, therfore the angle remayning, namely, KAL is equall to the angle remayning GDC. And forasmuch as these two lines KA and AL are equall to these two lines GD and DC, and they containe equall angles, therefore by the 4. of the first, the base KL is equall to the base GC, and the line KH is equall to the line GF, wherfore thes

And forasmuch as these two lines HA and AL are equall to these two FD and DC, and the base HL is equall to the base FC, therfore (by the 8. of the first) the angle HAL is equall to the angle FDC, and by construction, the angle BAL is equall to the angle EDC. Wherefore vnto the right line geuen, and at the point in it geuen, namely, A, is made a solide angle equal to the solide angle geuen D: which was required to be done.

               The 23. Theoreme. The 28. Proposition. If a parallelipipedō be cutte by a plaine superficies drawne by the diagonall lines of those playne superficieces which are opposite: that solide is by this playne superficies cutte into two equall partes.

                  AB be cutte by the playne superficies CDEF drawne by the diagonal lines of ye plaine superficieces which are opposite, namely, of the superficieces CF and DE. Then I say that the parallelipipedon AB is cutte into two equall partes by the superficies CDEF. For forasmuch as (by the 34. of the first) the triangle CGF is equall to the triangle CBF,
                  Demonstration. and the triangle ADE to the triangle DEH, and the parallelograme CA is equall to the parallelogramme BE, for they are opposite, and the parallelogramme GE is also equall to the parallelogramme CH, and the parallelogramme CE, is the common section by supposition: Wherfore the prisme contained vnder the two triangles CGF, and DAE, and vnder the three parallelogrammes GE, AC, and CE is (by the 8. definition of the eleuenth) equall to the prisme contayned vnder the two triangles CFB and DEH and vnder the three parallelogrammes CH, BE, and CE. For they are cōtayned vnder playne superficieces equall both in multitude and in magnitude. Wherefore the whole parallelipipedon AB is cutte into two equall partes by the playne superficies CDEF: which was required to be demonstrated.
               
                  A diagonall line is a right line which in angular figures is drawne from one angle and extended to his contrary angle as you see in the figure AB.

And your figure thus ordered compare it with the demonstratiō, only imagining a superficies to passe through the body by the diagonall lines CF and DE.

                  Then I say that the solide CM is equall to the solide CN. For forasmuch as either of these superficieces CBDH, CBEK is a parallelogramme, therefore (by the 34. of the first) the line CB is equall to either of these lines DH and EK. Wherefore also the line DH is equall to the line EK. Take away EH which is common to them both, wherefore the residue namely DE is equall to the residue HK. Wherfore also the triangle DCE is equall to the triangle HKB. And the parallelogramme DG is equall to the parallelogramme HN. And by the same reason the triangle AGF is equall to the triangle MLN, and the parallelogramme CF is equall to the parallelogramme BM. But the parallelogrāme CG is equall to the parallelogramme BN, by the 24. of the tenth for they are opposite the one to the other. Wherefore the prisme contayned vnder the two triangles FAG and DCE and vnder the three parrallelogrāmes AD, DG, and CG is equall to the prisme cōtayned vnder the two triangles MLN and HBK, and vnder the three parallelogrāmes, that is, BM, NH, and BN. Put that solide common to them both, whose base is the parallelogrāme AB, and the opposite side vnto the base is the superficies GEHM. Wherefore the whole parallelipipedon CM is equall to the whole parallelipipedon CN: Wherfore parallelipipedons consisting vpon one and the selfe same base, and vnder one and the selfe same altitude, whose standing lines are in the selfe same right lines, are equall the one to the other: which was requi

                   reforming is much better then the figure of this proposition commonly described in other copyes both greake and lattin): yet for the ease of those which are young beginners in thys matter of solides, I haue here set an other figure whose forme if it be described vpon pasted paper, with the like letters to euery line as they be here put, and then if ye finely cut not thorough but as it were halfe way the three lines LA, NMGF, and KHED, &amp; so folde it accordingly, &amp; compare it with the demonstratiō, it will geue great light thereunto.
               Stāding lines are called those fower right lines of euery parallelipipedon which ioyne together the angles of the vpper and nether bases of the same body.
                     Stāding lines.
                   Which according to the diuersitie of the angles of the solides, may either be perpendicular vpon the base, or fall obliquely. And forasmuch as in thys proposition and in the next proposition following, the solides compared together are supposed to haue one and the selfe same base, it is manifest that the standing lines are in respect of the lower base in the selfe same parallel lines, namely, in the two sides of the lower base. But because there are put two solides vpon one and the selfe same base, and vnder one and the selfe same altitude, the two vpper bases of the solides may be diuersly placed. For forasmuch as they are equall and like (by the 24. of this booke) either they may be placed betwene the selfe same parallel lines: and thē the standing lines are in either solide sayd to be in the selfe same parallel lines, or right lines: namely, when the two sides of eche of the vpper bases are contayned in the selfe same parallel lines: but contrariwise if those two sides of the vpper bases be not contayned in the selfe same parallel or right lines, neither shal the standing lines which are ioyned to those sides be sayd to be in the selfe same parallel or right lines. And therefore the standing lines are sayd to be in the selfe same right lines, when the sides of the vpper bases, at the least two of the sides are contayned in the selfe same right lines: which thing is required in the supposition of this 29, proposition. But the standing lines are sayd not to be in the selfe same right lines, when none of the two sides of the vpper bases are contayned in the selfe same right lines, which thing the next proposition following supposeth.

Wherefore Parallelipipedons consisting vpon one and the selfe same base, and vnder the selfe same altitude, whose standing lines are not in the selfe same right lines, are equall the one to the other: which was required to be proued.
               
                  This demonstration

is somwhat harder then the former to conceaue by the figure described in the plaine (and yet before M. Dee inuented that figure which is placed for it, it was much harder) by reason one solide is contained in an other. And therefore for the clerer light therof, describe vpō pasted paper this figure here put with the like letters and finely cut the lines AC, CB, EG, BL, EPK, ROHM, and folde it accordingly that euery line may exactly agree with his correspondent lyne (which obseruing the letters of euery line

ye shall easily do) and so cōpare your figure with the demonstration, and it will make it very plaine vnto you.

                  Thē I say, that the solide AE is equall to the solide CF. First let the standing lines, namely, HK, BE, AG, LM, OP, DF, CX, and RS, be erected perpendicularly to the bases AB and CD, and let the angle ALB not be equall to the angle CRD. Extend the line CR to the point T. And (by the 23. of the first) vpon the right line RT, and at the point in it R, describe vnto
                  
                     We are beholding to M. Dee for inuenting this figure, with other, which till his reforming were as much mishappen as this was, and so both in the Greeke and Latine copies remaine.
                  
                  
                  the angle ALB an equall angle TRV.

And (by the third of the first) put the line RT equall to the line LB, and the line RV equall to the line AL. And (by the 31. of the first) by the point V draw vnto the line RT a parallel line VW:
                  
                     Demonstration.
                   
                  and make perfecte the base RW, and the solide YV. Now forasmuch as these two lines TR and RV are equall to these two lines BL and LA, and they containe equall angles, therfore the parallelogramme RW is equall and like to the parallelogramme AB. Againe, forasmuch as the line LB is equall to the line RT, and the line LM to the line RS (for the lines LM and RS are the altitudes of the Parallelipipedons AE and CF, which altitudes are supposed to be equall) and they containe right angles by supposition, therefore the parallelogramme RY is equall and like to the parallelogramme BM. And by the same reason also the parallelogramme LG is equall and like to the parallelogrāme SV. Wherefore three parallelogrammes of

the solide AE are equall and like to the three parallelogrammes of the solide YV. But these three parallelogrammes are equall and like to the three opposite sides. Wherefore the whole Parallelipipedon AE is equall and like to the whole Parallelipipedon YV. Extend (by the second petition) the lines DR and WV, vntill they concurre, and let them concurre in the point Q. And (by the 31. of the first) by the point T drawe vnto the line RQ a parallel line T 4, and extend duely the lines Ta and DO vntill they concurre, and let them concurre in the point ✚. And make perfecte the solides QY and RI. Now the solide QY, whose 
                  
                     Note now, how the base respectiuely is taken

                         for so may alteratiō of respects alter the name of the bowndes eyther of solides or playnes.
                   
                  base is the parallelogramme RY, and the opposite side vnto the base the parallelogramme Qb, is equall to the solide YV, whose base is the parallelogramme RY, and the opposite side vnto the base the parallelogramme VZ. For they consiste vpon one and the selfe fame base, namely, RY, and are vnder one and the selfe same altitude, and their standing lines, namely, RQ, RV, Ta, TW, SN, Sd, Yb, and YZ, are in the selfe same right lines, namely, QW, and NZ. But the solide YV is proued equall to the solide AE. Wherefore also the solide YQ is equall to the solide AE. Now forasmuch as the parallelogramme RVWT is equall to the parallelogramme QT (by the 35. of the first) and the parallelogramme AB is equall to the parallelogramme RW: therefore the parallelogramme QT is equall to the parallelogramme AB, and the parallelogramme CD is equall to the parallelogramme AB (by supposition). Wherefore the parallelogramme CD is equall to the parallelogramme QT. And there is a certaine other superficies, namely, DT. Wherefore (by the 7. of the fift) as the base CD is to the base DT, so is the base QT to the base DT. And forasmuch as the whole Parallelipipedon CI is cut by the plaine superfi

                     es RF, which is a parallel to either of the opposite plaine superficieces, therfore as the base CD is to the base DT, so is the solide CF to the solide RI (by the 25. of the eleuenth). And by the same reason also, forasmuch as the whole Parallelipipedon QI is cut by the plaine superficies RY, which is a parallel to either of the opposite plaine superficieces, therefore as the base QT is to the base DT, so is the solide QY to the solide RI. But as the base CD is to the base DT, so is the base QT to the base TD. Wherefore (by the 11. of the fift) as the solide CF is to the solide RI, so is the solide QY to the solide RI. Wherefore either of these solides CF and QY, haue to the solide RI one and the same proportion. Wherfore the solide CF is equall to the solide QY. But it is proued that the solide QY is equall to the solide AE. Wherefore also the solide CF is equall to the solide AE.
               
               
                  But now suppose that the

stāding lines, namely, AG, HK,

                  BE, LM, CX, OP, DF, and RS, be not erected perpendicularly to the bases AB and CD. Then also I say, that the solide AE is equall to the solide CF. Draw (by the 11. of the eleuēth) vnto the ground plaine superficieces AB and CD from these pointes K, E, C, M, P, F, X, S, these perpendicular lines KN, ET, GV, MZ, PW, FY, XQ, and SI. And draw these right lines NT, NV, ZV, ZT, WY, WQ, IQ, and IY. Now (by that which hath before bene proued in this 31. Proposition) the

solide KZ is equall to the solide

PI, for they consist vpon equall 
                  
                     There you perceaue how the base is diuersly considered &amp; chosen: as before we aduertised you.
                   
                  bases, namely, KM, and PS, and are vnder one and the selfe same altitude, whose standing lines also are erected perpendicularly to the bases. But the solide KZ is equall to the solide AE (by the 29. of the eleuenth): and the solide PI is (by the same) equall to the solide CF, for they consist vppon one and the selfe same base, and are vnder one &amp; the selfe same altitude, whose standing lines are vpon the selfe same right lines. Wherefore also the solide AE is equall to the solide CE. Wherefore Parallelipipedons consisting vpon equall bases and being vnder one and the selfe same altitude, are equall the one to the other: which was required to be demonstrated.
               
               The demonstration of the first case of this proposition is very hard to conceaue by the figure described for it in a playne. And yet before M. Dee inuented that figure which we haue there placed for it, it was much harder. For both in the Greke and Lattin Euclide, it is very ill made, and it is in a maner impossible to conceaue by it the construction and demonstration thereto appertayning. Wherefore I haue here described other figures, which first describe vpon pasted paper, or such like matter and then order them in maner following.
               
               As touching the solide AE in the first case, I neede not to make any new description. For it is playne inough to conceaue as it is there drawne. Although you may for your more ease of imagination describe of pasted paper a parallelipipedo
                     •
                   hauing his sides equall with the sides of the parallelipipedon AE before described, and hauing also the sixe parallelogrammes thereof (contayned vnder those sides)

equiangle with the sixe parallelogrammes of that figure, ech side and eche angle equall to his correspondent side, and to his correspondent angle.
               But concerning the other solide. When ye haue described these three figures vpon pasted paper: Where note for the proportion of eche line, to make your figure of pasted paper equall with the figure before described vpon the playne, let your lines OP, CX, RS, DF, &amp;c. namely, the rest of the standing lines, of these figures, be equall to the standing lines OP, CX, RS, DF, &amp;c. of that figure. Likewise let the lines OC, CR, RD, DO, &amp;c. namely, the sides which cōtayne the bases of these figures be equal to the lines OC, CR, RD, DO, &amp;c. namely, to the sids which cōtayne the bases of that figure. Moreouer let the lines PX, X
                     •
                  , SF, FP, &amp;c. namely, the rest of the lines which cōtaine the vpper superficieces of these figures, be equal to the lines PX, XS, SF, F
                     •
                  , &amp;c. namely, to the rest of the lines which cōtaine the vpper superficieces of that figure (to haue described all those foresaid lines of these figures equal to all the lines of that figure, would haue required much more space then here can be spared: I haue made them equall onely to the halues of those lines, but by the example of these ye may, if ye will describe the like figures hauing their lines equall to the whole lines of the figure in the playne, eche line to his correspondent line). When I say ye haue as before is taught described these three figures, cut finely the lines XC, SR, FD of the first figure, and the lines SR, YT, and I ✚ of the second figure: likewise the lines 
                     •
                  R, NQ, ZVV, and YT, of the third figure, and fold these figures accordingly, which ye can not chuse but doo if ye marke well the letters of euery line.
               The three former figures being after this sort described, set them vpon this figure here described vpon a playne, as vpō their bases, namely, the lines OC, CR, RD, DO: RT, T ✚, ✚ D, DR: VR, RT, TW, Wa, VQ, and QR of these three figures vpon the lines correspondent vnto them in this figure. And they so standing compare them with the

construction and demonstration of the first case, and they will geue great light vnto it. This also ye must note,
                     Construction.
                   that if ye make the lines of the fore sayd three figures equall to the lines of the figure of the plaine described before in the demōstration of the first case: then must ye make a new base for them like vnto this, which is easy to doo, if ye draw a pallelogramme equall and like to the parallelogramme OCT ✚, and thē cut of from the same a parallelogramme DRT ✚ equall and in like sort situate to the parallelogramme DRT ✚ of that figure: &amp; vpon the line RT describe two parallelogrammes, the one equall like, and in like sort situate to the parallelogramme RTQa of that figure, and the other equall, like and in like sort situate to the parallelogramme RTVW of the same figure. The lines of this base which I haue here put are equall onely to the halues of the lines of that figure in the demonstration.
               As touching the second case ye neede no new figures, for it is playne to see by the figures (now reformed by M. Dee) described for it in the playne, especially if ye remember the forme of the figure of the 29. proposition of this booke. Only that which there ye conceaue to be the base, imagine here in both the figures of this second case to be the vpper superficies opposite to the base, and that which was there supposed to be the vpper superficies conceaue here to be the base. Ye may describe them vpon pasted paper for your better sight, taking hede ye note the letters rightly according as the construction requireth.
               
                  
                     Flussas demonstrateth this proposition an otherway taking onely the bases of the solides, and that after this maner.
                  Take equall bases (which

yet for the surer vnderstanding let be vtterly vnlike) namely, AEBF and ADCH, and let one of the sides of eche concurre in one &amp; the same right line AED, &amp; the bases being vpon one and the selfe same playne let there be supposed to be set vpon thē parallelipipedons vnder one &amp; the selfe same altitude. Then I say that the solide set vpō the base AB is equal to the solide set vpon the base AH. By the poynt E draw vnto the line AC a

parallel line EG, which if it

fall without the base AB, produce the right line HC to the poynt I. Now forasmuch as AB and AH are parallelogrmaes, therefore by the 24. of this booke, the triangles ACI and EGL shall be equaliter the one to the other: and by the 4. of the first, they shal be equiangle and equall: and by the first definition of the sixth, and fourth Proposition of the same, they shall be like. Wherfore Prismes erected vppon those triangles and vnder the same altitude that the solides AB and AH a
                        •
                     e, shall be equall and like, by the 8. definition of this booke. For they are contayned vnder like playne superficieces equall both in multitude and magnitude. Adde the solide set vpon the base ACLE common to them both. Wherefore the solide set vppon the base AEGC, is equall to the solide set vpon the base AELI. And forasmuch as the superficieces AEBF, and ADHC are equall (by supposition): and the part taken away AG is equall to the part taken away AL: therefore the residue BI shall be equall to the residue GD. Wherefore as AG is to GD as AL is to BI (namely, equalls to equalls). But as AG is to GD, so i
                        •
                      the solide set vpon AG to the solide set vpon GD by the 25. of this booke, for it is cut by a playne superficies set vpon the line GE, which superficies is parallel to the opposite superficieces. Wherefore as AL is to BI, so is the solide set vpon AL to the solide set vpon BI. Wherefore (by the 11. of the fifth) as the solide set vpon AG (or vpon AL which is equall vnto it) is to the solide set vpon GD, so is the same solide set vpon AG or AL to the solide set vpon BI. Wherefore (by the 2. part of the 9. of the fifth) the solides set vpon GD and BI shall be equall. Vnto which solides if ye adde equall solides, namely, the solide set vpon AG to the solide set vpon GD, and the solide set vpon AL to the solide set vpon BI: the whole solides set vpon the base AH and vpon the base AB 
                        •
                     hall be equall. Wherefore Parallelipedons consisting vpon equall bases and being vnder one and the selfe same altitude are equall the one to the other: which was required to be proued.
               
            
            
               ¶The 27. Theoreme. The 32. Proposition. Parallelipipedons being vnder one and the selfe same altitude, are in that proportion the one to the other that their bases are.
               SVppose that these parallelipipedons AB and CD be vnder one &amp; the selfe same altitude. Then I say that those parallelipipedons AB and CD are in that proportion the one to the other, that their bases are, that is, that as the base AE is to the base CF, so is the parallelipipedon AB to the parallelipipedon CD.Construction. Vpon the line FG describe (by the 45.

of the first) the parallelogramme FH equall to the parallelogramme AE and equiangle with the parallelogramme CF. And vpon the base FH describe a parallelipipedō of the selfe same altitude that the parallelipipedō CD is, &amp; let ye same be GK.Demonstration. Now (by the 31. of the eleuenth) the parallelipipedon AB is equall to the parallelipipedon GK, for they consist vpon equall

bases, namely, AE and FH, and are vnder one and the selfe same altitude. And forasmuch as the parallelipipedon CK is cut by a plaine superficies DG, being parallel to either of the opposite plaine super

                  icieces, therfore (by the 25. of the eleuenth) as the base HF is to the base FC, so is the parallelipipedon GK to parallelipipedon CD: but the base HF is equal to the base AE, and the parallelipipedon GK is proued equall to the parallelipipedon AB. Wherfore as the base A
                     •
                  E is to the base CF, so is the parallelipedon AB, to the parallelipipedon CD. Wherfore parallelipipedons being vnder one and the selfe same altitude, are in that proportion the one to the other that their bases are: which was required to be demonstrated.
               
                  I neede not to put any other figure for the declaration of this demonstration, for it is easie to see by the figure there described. Howbeit ye may for the more full sight therof, describe solides of pasted paper according to the construction there set forth, which will not be hard for you to do, if ye remember the descriptions of such bodies before taught.
               
               
                  A Corollary added by Flussas.
                  
                  
                     Equall parallelipipedons cōtained vnder one and the selfe same altitude, haue also their bases equal. For if the bases should be vnequall, the parallelipipedons also should be vnequal by this 32 propositiō. And equall parallelipipedons hauing equall bases, haue also one and the selfe same altitude. For if they should haue a greater altitude, they should exceede the equall parallelipipedons which haue the selfe same altitude: But if they should haue a lesse they should want so much of those selfe same equal parallelipipedons.
               
            
            
               The 28. Theoreme. The 33. Proposition. Like parallelipipedons are in treble proportion the one to the other of that in which their sides of like proportion are.
               SVppose that these parallelipipedons AB and CD be like, &amp; let the sides AE and CF be sides of like proportion. Then I say, the parallelipipedon AB is vnto the parallelipipedon CD in treble proportion of that in which the side AE is to the side CF. Extend the right lines AE, GE and HE to the pointes K, L, M.Construction. And (by the 2. of the first) vnto the

line CF put the line EK equal, and vnto the line FN put the line EL equall, and moreouer vnto the line FR put the line EM equall, and make perfect the parallelogramme KL, and the parallelipipedon KO.Demonstration. Now forasmuch as these two lines EK and EL are equall to these two lines CF and FN, but the angle KEL is equall to the angle CFN (for the angle AEG is equall to the angle CFM by reason that the solides AB and CD are like). Wherfore the parallelogramme KL is equall and like to the parallelogramme CN, and by the same reason also the parallelogramme KM is equall and

like to the parallelogramme CR,

and moreouer the parallelogramme OE to the parallelogramme FD. Wherefore three parallelogrammes of the parallelipipedon KO are like and equall to three parallelogrammes of the parallelipipedon CD: but those three sides are equall and like to the three opposite sides: wherfore the whole parallelipipedon KO is equal and like to the whole parallelipipedon CD. Make perfect the parallelogramme GK. And vpon the bases GK and KL make perfect to the altitude of the parallelipipedon AB, the parallelipipedons EX &amp; LP. And forasmuch as by reason that the parallelipipedons AB &amp; CD are like, as the line AE is to the line CF, so is the line EG, to the line FN, and the line EH to the line FR. But the line CF is equall to the line EK, and the line FN to the line EL, and the line FR to the line EM, therefore as the line AE is to the line EK, so is the line GE to the line EL, and the line HE to the line EM (by construction). But as the line AE is to the line EK, so is the parallelogramme AG to the parallelogramme GK (by the first of the sixt). And as the line GE is to the line EL, so is the parallelogramme GK to the parallelogrāme KL. And moreouer as the line HE is to the line EM, so is the parallelogramm
                     •
                   PE to the parallelogramme KM. Wherefore (by the 11. of the fift) as the parallelogramme AG is to the parallelogramme GK, so is the parallelogramme GK to the parallelogramme KL, and the parallelograme PE to the parallelogramme KM. But as the parallelogramme AG is to the parallelogramme GK, so is the parallelipipedon AB to the parallellpipedon EX, by the former proposition, and as the parallelogramme GK is to the parallelogramme KL, so by the same is the parallelipipedon XE to the parallelipipedon PL: and agayne by the same, as the parallelogramme PE is to the parallelogramme KM, so is the parallelipipedon PL to the parallelipipedon KO. Wherfore as the parallelipipedō AB is to the parallelipipedon EX, so is the parallelipipedon EX to the parallelipipedon PL, and the parallelipipedon PL to the parallelipipedon KO. But if there be fower magnitudes in* continuall proportion, the first shalbe vnto the fourth in treble proportion that it is to the second (by the 10. definition of the fift). Wherefore the parallelipipedon AB is vnto the parallelipedon KO in treble proportion that the parallelipipedon AB is to the parallelipipedon EX. But as the parallelipipedon AB is to the parallelipipedō EX, so is the parallelogramme AG to the parallelogramme GK, and the right line AE to the right line EK. Wherefore also the parallelipipedon AB is to the parallelipipedon KO in treble proportiō of that which the line AE hath to the line EK. But the parallelipipedon KO is equall to the parallelipipedon CD, and the right line EK to the right line CF. Wherefore the parallelipipedon AB is to the parallelipipedon CD in treble proportion that the side of like proportion, namely, AE is to the side of like proportion, namely, to CF. Wherefore like parallelipipedons are in treble proportion the one to the other of that in which their sides of like proportion are: which was required to be demonstrated.

                     continuall proportion, as the first is to the fourth, so shall the Parallelipipedon described of the first line, be to the Parallelipipedon described of the second, both the Parallelipipedons being like and in like sort described. For the first line is to the fourth in t

                  Because the one of the figures before, described in a plaine, pertayning to the demonstration of this 33. Proposition, is not altogether so easie to a younge beginner to conceaue, I haue here for the same described an other figure, which if ye first drawe vpon pasted paper, and afterward cut the lines &amp; folde the sides accordingly, will agree with the construction &amp; demonstration of the sayd Proposition.

                  1. Hereby it is manifest, that two right lines may be found, which shall haue that proportion, the one to the other, that any two like Parallelipipedons, and in like sort described, geuen, haue the one to the other.
                  
                  Suppose Q and X to be two like Parallelipipedons, and in like sort described. Of Q take any of the three lines, of which it is produced: as namely, RG. Of X, take that right line of his production, which line

called Omologall to RG) &amp;

let that be TV. By the 11. of the sixth, to RG and TV, let the third line in proportion with them be founde, and let that be Y. By the same 11. of the sixth, to TV and Y, let the thirde right line be foūd, in the sayd proportion of TV to Y: &amp; let that be Z. I say now that RG hath that proportion to Z, which Q hath to X. For by construction, we haue fower right lines in continuall propiotion, namely, RG, TV, Y, and Z. Wherfore by Euclides Corollary, here before, RG is to Z, as Q is to X. Wherefore we haue foūd two right lines hauing that proportion the one to the other, which any two like Parallelipipedons of like description, geuen, haue the one to the other: which was required to be done.

                  Suppose the two right lines geuen to be A and B: Imagine of foure right lines in continuall proportion, A. to be the first, and B to be the fourth: (or contrariwise, B to be first, &amp; A to be the fourth).

And so likewise (secondly) if A were double to B, the Parallelipipedon of D, shoulde be double to the like, of B described, both being like situated. Wherefore if of A or B, were Cubes made, the Cubes of C and D are proued double to them:

                  ¶A Corollary added by Flussas.
                  
                  
                     Parallelipipedons consisting vpon equall bases, are in proportion the one to the other as their altitudes are. For if those altitudes be cut by a plaine superficies parallel to the bases: the sections shall be in proportion the one to the other as the sections of the bases cut, by the 25. of this booke. Which sections of the bases are the one to the other in that proportion that their sides or the altitudes of the solides are, by the 
                        •
                     irst of the sixt. Wherefore the solides are the one to the other as their altitudes are. But if the bases be vnlike, the selfe same thing may be proued by the Corollary of the 25. of this booke, which by the 25. Proposition was proued in like bases.
               
            
            
               ¶The 29. Theoreme. The 34. Proposition. In equall Parallelipipedons the bases are reciprokall to their altitudes. And Parallelipipedons whose bases are reciprokall to their altitudes, are equall the one to the other.
               SVppose that these Parallelipipedons AB &amp; CD be equall the one to the other.Two cases in the first part of this propotion. Then I say, that the bases of the Parallelipipedons AB and CD are reciprokall to their altitudes, that is, as the base EH is to the base NP, so is the altitude of the solide CD to the altitude of the solide AB. First let the standing lines AG, EF, LB, HK, of the solide AB, &amp; the stāding lines CM, NX, OD, and PR, of the solide CD, be erectedperpē
                  dicularly to the bases EH &amp; NP.First case, which also may be two wayes. Thē I say, that as the base EH is to the base NP, so is the line CM to the line AG.First way. Now if

the base EH be equal to the base NP, and the solide AB is equall to the solide CD, wherefore the line CM is equall to the line AGThis followeth also of the Corollary added of F

                     as after the 3
                           •
                        . proposition of this booke.. For if the bases EH and NP being equall, the altitudes AG and CM be not equall, neither also shall the solide AB be equall to the solide CD, but they are supposed to be equall. Wherefore the altitude CM is not vnequall to the altitude AG. Wherefore it is equall. And therefore as the base EH is to the base PN, so is the altitude CM to the altitude AG. Wherfore it is manifest, that the bases of the Parallelipipedons AB and CD are reciprokall to their altitudes.
               But now suppose that the base EH be not equall to the base NP.Second way. But let the base EH be the greater. Now the solide AB is equall to the solide CD. Wherefore also the altitude CM is greater then the altitude AG This also followeth of the former Corollary.. For if not, then againe are not the solides AB and CD equall: but they are by supposition equall. Wherefore (by the 2. of the first) put vnto the line AG an equall line CT. And vpon the base NP and the altitude being CT, make perfecte a solide contained vnder parallel plaine superficieces, and let the same be CZ. And forasmuch

as the solide AB is equall to the solide CD, and there is a certaine other solide, namely, CZ, but vnto one and the selfe same magnitude equall magnitudes haue one and the selfe same proportion (by the 7. of the fift). Wherefore as the solide AB is to the solide CZ, so is the solide CD to the solide CZ. But

as the solide AB is to the solide CZ, so is the base EH to the base NP (by the 32. of the eleuenth)
                     •
                   for the solides AB and CZ are vnder equall altitudes. And as the solide CD is to the solide CZ, so is the base MP to the base PT, and the line MC to the line CT. Wherefore (by the 11. of the fift) as the base EH is to the base NP, so is the line CM to the line CT. But the line CT is equall to the line AG. Wherefore (by the 7. of the fift) as the base EH is to the base NP, so is the altitude CM to the altitude AG. Wherfore in these Parallelipipedons AB and CD the bases are reciprokall to th
                     •
                  ir altitudes.
               But now againe suppose that the bases of the Parallelipipedons AB and CD be reciprokall to their altitudes,The conuerse of both the partes of the first case. that is, as the base EH is to the base NP, so let the altitude of the solide CD be to the altitude of the solide AB. Then I say, that the solide AB is equall to the solide CD. For againe let the standing lines be erected perpendicularly to their bases.
               And now if the base EH be equall to the base NP: but as the base EH is to the base  NP, so is the altitude of the solide CD to the altitude of the solide AB. Wherefore the altitude o
                     •
                   the solide CD is equall to the altitude of the solide AB. But Parallelipipedons consisting vpon equall bases and vnder one and the selfe same altitude, are (by the 31. of the eleuenth) equall the one to the other. Wherefore the solide AB is equall to the solide CD.
               
                   But now suppose that the base EH be not equall to the base NP: but let the base EH be the greater. Wherefore also the altitude of the solide CD, that is, the line CM is greater then the altitude of the solide AB, that is, then the line AG. Put againe (by the 3. of the first) the line CT equall to the line AG, and make perfecte the solide CZ. Now for that as the base EH is to the base NP, so is the line MC to the line AG. But the line AG is equall to the line CT. Wherefore as the base EH is to the base NP, so is the line CM to the line CT. But as the base EH is to the base NP, so (by the 32. of the eleuenth) is the solide AB to the solide CZ, 
                     •
                  or the solides AB and CZ are vnder equall altitudes. And as the line CM is to the line CT, so (by the 1. of the sixt) is the base MP to the base P
                     •
                  T, and (by the 32. of the eleuenth) the solide CD to the solide CZ. Wherefore also (by the 11. and 9. of the fift) as the solide AB is to the solide CZ, so is the solide CD to the solide CZ. Wherfore either of these solides AB and CD haue to the solide CZ one and the same proportion. Wherefore (by the 7. of the fift) the solide AB is equall to the solide CD: which was required to be demonstrated.
               
                  Second case.But now suppose that the standing lines, namely, FE, BL, GA, KH: XN, DO, MC, and RP, be not erected perpendicularly to their bases. And (by the 11. of the eleuenth) from the pointes F, G, B, K
                     •
                   X, M, D, R,Construction. draw vnto the plaine superficies of the bases EH and NP perpendicular lines, and let those perpendicular lines light vpō the pointes S, T, V, Z: W, Y, d, and Q, and make perfecte the Parallelipipedons FZ, and XQI say that euen in this case also, if the solides AB and CD be equall, their bases are reciprokall to their altitudes, that is, as the base EH is to the base NP, so is the altitude of the solide CD to the altitude of the solide AB. For forasmuch as the solide AB is equall to the solide

CD, but the solide AB is equall to

the solide BT (by the 20. of the eleuenth) for they are vpon one and the selfe same base,Demonstration. namely, the parallelogramme KF, and vnder one and the selfe same altitude, whose standing lines are in the selfe same right lines, namely, HZAT, and LVES: and the solide CD is by the same reason equall to the solide DY, for they both consist vpon one and the selfe same base, namely, the parallelogramme XR, are vnder one and the selfe same altitude, whose standing lines are in the selfe same right lines, namely, PQCY, and OhNW. Wherefore the solide

BT is equall to the solide DY. But in equall Parallelipipedons, whose altitudes are erected perpendicularly to their bases, their bases are reciprokall to their altitudes (by the first part of this Proposition). Wherefore as the base FK is to the base XR, so is the altitude of the solide DY to the altitude of the solide BT. But the base FK is equall to the base EH, and the base XR to the base NP. Wherefore as the base EH is to the base NP, so is the altitude of the solide DY to the altitude of the solide BT. But the altitudes of the solides DY &amp; BT, and of the solides DC &amp; BA are one and the selfe same. Wherefore as the base EH is to the base NP, so is the altitude of the solide CD to the altitude of the solide AB. Wherfore the bases of the Parallelipipedons AB and CD are reciprokall to their altitudes.
               Againe suppose that the bases of the Parallelipipedons AB and CD be reciprokall to their altitudes,The conuerse of the second case. that is, as the base EH is to the base NP, so let the altitude of the solide CD be to the altitude of the solide AB. Then I say, that the solide AB is equall to the solide CD. For the same order of construction remayning, for that as the base EH is to the base NP, so is the altitude of the solide CD to the altitude of the solide AB: but the base EH is equall to the parallelogramme FK, and the base NP to the parallelogramme XR: wherefore as the base FK is to the base XR, so is the altitude of the solide CD to the altitude of the solide AB But the altitudes of the solides AB and BT are equall, and so also are the altitudes of the solides DC and DY. Wherefore as the base FK is to the base XR, so is the altitude of the solide DY to the altitude of the solide BT. Wherefore the bases of the Parallelipipedons BT and DY are reciprokall to their altitudes. But Parallelipipedons whose altitudes are erected perpendicularly to their bases, and whose bases are reciprokall to their altitudes, are equall the one to the other (by this Proposition). Wherefore the solide BT is equall to the solide DY. But the solide BT is equall to the solide BA (by the 29. of the eleuenth) for they consist vpon one and the selfe same base, namely, FK, and are vnder one and the self same altitude, whose

standing lines are in the selfe same right lines. And the solide DY is equall to the solide DC, for they consiste vpon one and the selfe same base, namely, XR, and are vnder one and the selfe same altitude, whose standing lines are in the selfe same right lines. Wherefore also the solide AB is equall to the solide CD.The generall conclusion. Wherefore in equall Parallelipipedons the bases are reciprokall to their altitudes. And Parallelipipedons whose bases are reciprokall with their altitudes, are equall the one to the other: which was required to be proued.
               
                  The demonstration of the first case of this Proposition is easie to conceaue by the figure as it is described in the plaine. But ye may for your more full sight describe Parallelipipedons of pasted paper, according as the construction teacheth you.

                  For (by my Theoreme) those rectangle parallelipipedōs made of the squares of the first &amp; fourth, multiplied by the fourth &amp; the first, accordingly, are equall to the Cubes made of the second &amp; third numbers: which we make our two

Let the rectangle parallelogramme be made perfect, as CD. It is euident, that CD, is equall to the square FRX by the 17. of the sixth: and by construction FRX, is equall to B.

               The 30. Theoreme. The 35. Proposition. If there be two superficiall angles equall, and from the pointes of those angles

be eleuated on high right lines, comprehending together with those right lines which containe the superficiall angles, equall angles, eche to his corespōdent angle, and if in eche of the eleuated lines be takē a point at all auentures, and from those pointes be drawen perpendicular lines to the ground playne superficieces in which are the angles geuen at the beginning, and from the pointes which are by those perpendicular lines made in the two playne superficieces be ioyned to those angles which were put at the beginning right lines: those right lines together with the lines eleuated on high shall contayne equall angles.
               SVppose that these two rectiline superficiall angles BAC, and EDF be equall the one to the other:Construction. and from the pointes A and D let there be eleuated vpward these right lines AG and DM, comprehendinge together with the lines put at the beginninge equall angles, ech to his correspondent angle, that is, the angle MDE to the angle GAB, and the angle MDF to the angle GAC, and take in the lines AG and DM pointes at all auētures and let the same be G and M. And (by the 11. of the eleuēth) from the pointes G and M draw vnto the ground playne superficieces wherein are the angles BAC and E

DF perpendicular lines GL and MN and let them fall in the sayd playne super
                     •
                  icieces in the pointes N and L, and drawe a right line from the point L to the point A and an other from the pointe N to the pointe D. Then I say that the angle GAL is equall to the angle MDN. Frō the greater of the two lines AG and DM, (which let be AG) cut of by the 3. of the first the line AH equall vnto the line DM. And (by the 31. of the first) by the point H, drawe vnto the line GL a parallel line, and let the same be HK. Now the line GL is erected perpendicularly to the grounde playne superficies BAL: Wherfore also (by the 8. of the eleuenth) the line HK is erected perpēdicularly to the same grounde plaine superficies BAC. Drawe (by the 12. of the first) frō the pointes K and N vnto the right lines AB, AC, DF, &amp; DE perpēdicular right lines, and let the same be KC, NF, KB, NE. And drawe these right lines HC, CB, MF, FE. Now forasmuch a
                     •
                   (by the 47. of the first) the square of the line HA is equall to the squares of the lines HK and KA,Demonstration. but vnto the square of the line KA are equall the squares of the lines KC and CA: Wherefore the square of the line HA is equall to the squares of the lines HK, KC and CA. But by the same vnto the squares of the lines HK and KC is equall the square of the line HC: Wherefore the square of the line HA is equall to the squares of the lines HC and CA: wherfore the angle HCA is (by the 48. of the first) a right angle. And by the same reason also the angle MFD is a right angle. Wherefore the angle HCA is equall to the angle MFD. But the angle HAC is (by suppositiō) equal to the angle MDF. Wherfore there are two triangles MDF and HAC hauing two angles of the one equall to twoo angles of the other, eche to his correspondent angle, and one side of the one equall to one side of the other, namely, that side which subtendeth one of the equall

angles, that is, the side HA is equall to the side DM by construction. Wherefore the sides remayning are (by the 26. of the first) equall to the sides remayning. Wherefore the side AC is equall to the side DF. In like sort may we proue that the side AB is equall to the side DE, if ye drawe a right line from the point H to the point B, and an other from the point M to the point E. For forasmuch as the square of the line AH is (by the 47. of the firste) equall to the squares of the lines AK and KH, and (by the same) vnto the square of the line AK are equall the squares of the lines AB and BK. Wherefore the squares of the lines AB, BK, and KH are equall to the square of the line AH. But vnto the squares of the lines BK and KH is equall the square of the line BH (by the 47. of the first) for the angle HKB is a right angle, for that the line HK is erected perpēdicularly to the ground playne superficies: Wherefore the square of the line AH is equall to the squares of the lines AB and BH. Wherefore (by the 48. of the first) the angle ABH is a right angle. And by the same reason the angle DEM is a right angle. Now the angle BAH is equall to the angle EDM, for it is so supposed, and the line AH is equall to the line DM. Wherefore (by the 26. of the firste) the line AB is equall to the line DE. Now forasmuch as the line AC is equall to the line DF, and the line AB to the line DE, therefore these two lines AC and AB are equall to these two lines FD and DE. But the angle also CAB is by supposition equall to the angle FDE. Wherefore (by the 4. of the firste) the base BC is equall to the base EF, and the triangle to the triangle, and the rest of the angles to the reste of the angles. Wherefore the angle ACB is equall to the angle DFE. And the right angle ACK is equal to the right angle DFN. Wherfore the angle remayning, namely, BCK, is equall to the angle remayning, namely, to EFN. And by the same reasō also the angle CBK is equal to the angle FEN. Wherfore

there are two triangles BCK, &amp; EFN, hauing two angles of the one equal to two angles of the other, eche to his correspondent angle, and one side of the one equall to one side of the other, namely, that side that lieth betwene the equall angles, that is the side BC is equall to the side EF: Wherefore (by the 26. of the first) the sides remaininge are equall to the sides remayning. Wherfore the side CK is equall to the side FN: but the side AC is equall to the side DF. Wherefore these two sides AC and CK are equall to these two sides DF and FN, and they contayne equall angles: Wherefore (by the 4. of the first) the base AK is equall to the base DN. And forasmuch as the line AH is equall to the line DM, therefore the square of the line AH is equall to the square of the line DM. But vnto the square of the line AH are equall the squares of the lines AK and KH (by the 47. of the first) for the angle AKH is a right angle. And to the square of the line DM are equall the squares of the lines DN and NM, for the angle DNM is a right angle. Wherefore the squares of the lines AK and KH are equall to the squares of the lines DN and NM: of which two, the square of the line AK is equall to the square of the line DN (for the line AK is proued equall to the line AN). Wherefore the residue, namely, the square of the line KH is equal to the residue, namely, to the square of the line NM. Wherefore the line HK is equall to the line MN. And forasmuch as these two lines HA and AK are equall to these two lines MD and DN, the one to the other, and the

base HK is equall to the base MN: therfore (by the 8. of the first) the angle HAK is equall to the angle MDN. If therefore there be two superficiall angles equall, and frō the pointes of those angles be eleuated on high right lines, comprehending together with those right lines which were put at the beginning, equall angles, ech to his corespondent angle, and if in ech of the erected lines be taken a point at all aduentures, and from those pointes be drawen perpendicular lines to the plaine superficieces in which are the angles geuen at the beginning, and fr

                   the pointes which are by the perpendicular lines made in the two plaine superficieces be ioyned right lines to those angles which were put at the beginning, those right lines shall together with the lines eleuated on high make equall angles which was required to be proued.
               
                  Because the figures of the former demonstration are somewhat hard to conceaue as they are there drawen in a plaine, by reason of the lines that are imagined to be eleuated on high, I haue here set other figures, wherein you must erecte

perpendicularly to the ground superficieces the two triangles BHK, and EMN, and then eleuate the triangles DFM, &amp; ACH, in such sort that the angles M and H of these triangles, may concurre with the angles M and H of the other erected triangles. And then imagining only a line to be drawen from the point G of the line AG to the point L in the ground superficies, compare it with the former construction &amp; demonstration, and it will make it very easye to conceaue.
               
               
                  ¶ Corollary.
                  By this it is manifest, that if there be two rectiline superficiall angles equall, and vpon those angles be eleuated on high equall right lines contayning together with the right lines put at the b

                     ginning equall angles: perpendicular lines drawen from those eleuated lines to the ground plaine superficieces wherein are the angles put at the beginning, are equall the one to the other. For it is manifest, that the perpendicular lines HK, &amp; MN, which are drawen from the endes of the equall eleuated lines AH, and DM, to the ground superficieces, are equall.
                  
               
            
            
               ¶The 31. Theoreme. The 36. Proposition. If there be three right lines proportionall: a Parallelipipedon described of those three right lines, is equall to the Parallelipipedon described of the middle line, so that it consiste of equall sides, and also be equiangle to the foresayd Parallelipipedon.
               SVppose that these three lines A, B, C, be proportionall, as A is to B, so let B be to C. Then I say, that the Parallelipipedon made of the lines A, B, C, is equall to the Parallelipipedon made of the line B, so that the solide made of the line B consist of equall

sides, and be also equiangle to the solide made of the lines A, B, C. Describe (by the 23. of the eleuenth) a solide angle E contained vnder three superficiall angles,Construction. that is, DEG, GEF, and FED: and (by the 3. of the first) put vnto the line B euery one of these lines DE, GE, &amp; EF, equall:

and make perfecte the solide EK. And vnto the line A let the line LM be equall. And (by the 26. of the eleuēth) vnto the right line LM, and at the point in it L, describe vnto the solide angle E an equall solide angle, cōtained vnder these plaine superficiall angles NLX, XLM, and NLM, and vnto the line B put the line LX equall, &amp; the line LN to the line C. Now for that as the line A is to the line B,Demonstration. so is the line B to the line C: but the line A is equall to the line LM, and the line B to euery one of these lines LX, EF, EG, and ED, and the line C to the line LN. Wherefore as LM is to EF, so is DE to LN: So then the sides about the equal angles MLN, &amp; DEF, are reciprokall: Wherfore (by the 14. of the sixt) the parallelogrāme MN is equall to the parallelogramme DF. And forasmuch as two plaine superficiall angles, namely, DEF and NLM are equall the one to the other, and vpon them are erected vpward equall right lines, LX and EG; comprehending with the right lines put at the beginning equall angles the one to the other.

Wherfore the solides LH and EK, are vnder one and the selfe same altitude. But Parallelipipedons consisting vpon equall bases, and being vnder one and the selfe altitude, are (by the 31. of the eleuenth) equall the one to the other. Wherefore the solide LH is equall to the solide EK. But the solide LH is described of the lines A, B, C, and the solide EK is described of the line B. Wherefore the Parallelipipedon described of the lines A, B, C, is equall to the Parallelipipedon made of the line B, which consisteth of equall sides, and is also equiangle to the foresaid Parallelipipedon. If therfore there be three right lines proportionall, a Parallelipipedō described of those three lines is equall to the Parallelipipedō described of the middle line, so that is consist of equall sides, and also be equiangle to the foresaid Parallelipipedon: which was required to be proued.
               
                  
                  The construction and demonstration of this Proposition, and of the next Proposition following, may easily be conceaued and vnderstanded by the figures described in the plaine belonging to them. But ye may for the more full sight of them, describe such bodies of pasted paper, hauing their sides proportionall, as is required in the Propositions.

                        Hereby it is euident, that if three right lines be proportionall: the Cube produced of the middle line, is equall to the rectangle Parallelipipedon made of those three lines.
                     
                     For a Cube is a Parallelipipedon of equall sides: and also rectangled: as we suppose the Parallelipipedon, made of the three lines to be likewise rectangled.

                        Suppose AC to be the

Cube geuen: whose roote, suppose to be AB. Let the proportion geuen, be that which in betwene the two right lines D and E, I say now, three right lines are to be found, proportionall, in the proportion of D to E, of which, the rectangle Parallelipipedon produced, shall be equall to AC. By the 12. of the sixt let a line be found, which to AB haue that proportion that D hath to E. Let that line be F: and by the same 12. of the sixth, let an other line be found, to which, AB, hath that proportion that D hath to E: and let that line found be H. Let a rectangle Parallelipipedon mathematically be produced of the three right lines F, AB, and H, which suppose to be K: I say now, that F, AB, and H, are three right lines found proportionall in the proportion of D to E, of which, the rectangle Parallelipipedon K, produced, is equall to AC the Cube geuen. First it is euident that F, AB, and H, are proportionall in the proportion of D to E. For, by construction, as D is to E, so is F to AB: and by construction likewise, as D is to E, so is AB to H. Wherefore F is to AB, and AB is to H, as D is to E. So then it is manifest, F, AB, and H, to be proportionall in the proportion of D to E, and AB to be the middle line.

                  : and by the same reason the Parallelipipedon ME is to the Parallelipipedon NG in treble proportion of that which the side EF is to the side GH. Wherfore (by the 11. of the fift) as the Parallelipipedon KA is to the Parallelipipedon LC, so is the Parallelipipedon ME t

If a plaine superficies be erected perpendicularly to a plaine superficies, and from a point taken in one of the plaine superficieces be drawen to the other plaine superficies, a perpendicular line: that perpendicular line shall fall vpon the common section of those plaine superficieces.
               SVppose that the plaine superficies CD be erected perpēdicularly to the plaine superficies AB, and let their common section be the line DA: and in the superficies CD take a point at all aduentures, and let the same be E. Then I say, that a perpendicular line drawen from the point E to the

plaine superficies AB, shall fall vpon the right line DA. For if not, then let it fall without the line DA, as the line EF doth, and let it fall vpon the plaine superficies AB in the point F.Demonstration leading to an impossibilitie. And (by the 12. of the first) from the point F draw vnto the line DA, being in the superficies AB a perpendicular line FG, which line also is erected perpendicularly to the plaine superficies CD: by the third diffinitiō: by reason we presuppose CD and AB to be perpendicularly erected ech to other. Draw a right line from the point E to the point G. And forasmuch as the line FG is erected perpendicularly to the plaine superficies CD, and the line EG toucheth it being in the superficies CD. Wherefore the angle FGE is (by the 2. definition of the eleuenth) a right angle. But the line EF is also erected perpēdicularly to the superficies AB: wherefore the angle EFG is a right angle. Now therefore two angles of the triangle EFG, are equall to two right angles: which (by the 17. of the first) is impossible. Wherfore a perpendicular line drawen frō the point E to the s

               SVppose that AF be a Parallelipipedon, and let the opposite sides thereof CF and AH be deuided into two equall partes in the pointes K, L, M, N, and likewise let the opposite sides AD and GF be deuided into two equall partes in the point

DG. Then I say, that the lines VS and DG do deuide the one the other into two equall partes,Construction. that is, that the line VT is equall to the line TS, and the line DT to the line TG. Drawe these right lines DV, VE, BS, and SG.Demonstration. Now forasmuch as the line DX is a parallel to the line OE, therfore (by the 29. of the first) the angles DXV and VOE being alternate angles, are equall the one to the other. And forasmuch as the line DX is equall to the line OE, and the line XV to the line VO, and they comprehend equall angles: Wherefore the base DV is equall to the base VE (by the 4. of the first) and the triangle DXV is equall to the triangle VOE, and the rest of the angles to the rest of the angles. Wherefore the angle XVD is equall to the angle OVE. Wherefore DVE is one right line, and by the same reason BSG is also one right line, and the line BS is equall to the line SG. And forasmuch as the line CA is equall to the line DB, and is vnto it a parallel, but the line CA is equall to the line GE, and is vnto it also a parallel: wherfore (by the firs
                     •
                   common sentence) the line DB is equall to the line GE, &amp; is also a parallel vnto it: but the right lines DE and BG do ioyne these parallel lines together: Wherefore (by the 33. of the first) the line DE is a parallel vnto the line BG. And in either of these lines

are taken pointes at all aduentures, namely, D, V, G, S, and a right line is drawen from the point D to the point G, and an other from the point V to the point S. Wherefore (by the 7. of the eleuenth) the lines DG and VS are in one and the selfe same plaine superficies. And forasmuch as the line DE is a parallel to the line BG, therefore (by the 24. of the first) the angle EDT is equall to the angle BGT, for they are alternate angles, and likewise the angle DTV is equall to the angle GTS. Now then there are two triangles, that is, DTV and GTS, hauing two angles of the one equall to two angles of the other, and one side of the one equall to one side of the other, namely, the side which subtendeth the equall angles, that is, the side DV to the side GS, for they are the halfes of the lines DE and BG: Wherefore the sides remayning are equall to the sides remayning. Wherfore the line DT is equall to the line TG, and the line VT to the line TS. If therefore the opposite sides of a Parallelipipedon be deuided into two equall partes, and by their sections be extended plaine superficieces, the common section of those plaine superficieces, and the diameter of the Parallelipipedon, do deuide the one the other into two equall partes: which was required to be demonstrated.
               
                  A Corollary added by Flussas.
                  
                  
                     Euery playne superficies extended by the center of a parallelipipedon, diuideth that solide into two equall partes: and so doth not any other playne superficies not extended by the center.
                  
                  For euery playne extended by the center, cutteth the diameter of the parallelipipedon in the center into two equall partes. For it is proued, that playne superficieces which cutte the solide into two equall partes, do cut the dimetient into two equall partes in the center. Wherefore all the lines drawen by the center in that playne superficies shall make angles with the dimetient. And forasmuch as the diameter falleth vpon the parallel right lines of the solide, which describe the opposite sides of the sayde solide, or vpon the parallel playne superficieces of the solide, which make angels at the endes of the diameter: the triangles contayned vnder the diameter, and the right line extended in that playne by the center, and the right line, which being drawen in the opposite superficieces of the solide, ioyneth together the endes of the foresayde right lines, namely, the ende of the diameter, and the ende of the line drawen by the center in the superficies extended by the center, shall alwayes be equall, and equiangle, by the 26. of the first. For the opposite right lines drawen by the opposite playne superficieces of the solide do make equall angles with the diameter, forasmuch as they are parallel lines, by the 16. of this booke. But the angles at the cēter are equall, by the 15. of the first, for they are head angles: &amp; one side is equall to one side, namely, halfe the dimetient. Wherefore the triangles contayned vnder euery right line drawen by the center of the parallelipipedon in the superficies, which is extended also by the sayd center, and the diameter thereof, whose endes are the angles of the solide, are equall, equilater, &amp; equiangle (by the 26. of the first). Wherfore it followeth that the playne superficies which cutteth the parallelipipedon, doth make the partes of the bases on the opposite side, equall, and equiangle, and therefore like, and equall both in multitude, and in magnitude: wherefore the two solide sections of that solide, shalbe equall and like, by the 8. diffinition of this booke. And now that no other playne superficies, besides that which is extended by the center, deuideth the parallelipipedon into two equall partes, it is manifest: if vnto the playne superficies which is not extended by the center, we extend by the center a parallel playne superficies (by the Corollary of the 15. of this booke). For forasmuch as that superficies which is extended by the center, doth deuide the parallelipipedō into two equall par
                        ••
                     : it is manifest, that the other playne superficies (which is parallel to the superficies which deuideth the solide into two equall partes) is in one of the equall partes of the solide: wherefore seing that the whole is euer greater then his partes, it must nedes be that one of these sections is lesse then the halfe of the solide, and therefore the other is greater.
                  For the better vnderstanding of this former proposition, &amp; also of this Corollary added by Flussas, it shalbe very nedefull for you to describe of pasted paper or such like matter a parallelipipedō or a Cube, and to deuide all the parallelogrāmes therof into two equall parts, by drawing by the c

lines drawen by their centers, and must cut the one the other by these parallel lines. And for the diameter of this body, extēd a thred from one angle in the base of the solide to his opposite angle, which shall passe by the center of the parallelipipedon, as doth the line DG in the figure before described in the playne. And draw in the base and the opposite superficies vnto it, Diagonall lines, from the angles from which is extended the diameter of the solide: as in the former description are the lines BG and DE. And when you haue thus described this body, compare it with the former demonstration, and it will make it very playne vnto you, so your letters agree with the letters of the figure described in the booke. And this description will playnely set forth vnto you the corollary following that proposition. For where as to the vnderstanding of the demonstration of the proposition the superficieces put within the body were extended by parallel lynes drawen by the cēters of the bases of the parallelipipedon: to the vnderstanding of the sayd Corollary, ye may extende a superficies by any other lines drawen in the sayd bases, so that yet it passe through the middest of the thred, which is supposed to be the center of the parallelipipedon.
               
            
            
               ¶ The 35. Theoreme. The 40. Proposition. If there be two Prismes vnder equall altitudes, &amp; the one haue to his base a parallelogramme, and the other a triangle, and if the parallelogramme be double to the triangle: those Prismes are equall the one to the other.
               
                  SVppose that these two Prismes ABCDEF, GHKMON, be vnder equall altitudes, and let the one haue to his base the parallelogramme AC, and the other the triangle GHK, and let the parallelogramme AC be double to the triangle GHK. Then I say, that the Prisme ABCDEF is equall to the Prisme GHKMON.
                  
                     Construction.
                   
                  Make perfecte

the Parallelipipedons AX &amp; GO. And forasmuch as the parallelogramme AC is double to the triangle GHK,
                  
                     Demonstration.
                   
                  but the parallelogramme GH is also (by the 41. of the first) double to the triangle GHK, wherefore the parallelogramme AC is equall to the parallelogramme GH. But Parallelipipedons consisting vpon equall bases and vnder one and the selfe same altitude, are equall the one to the other (by the 31. of the eleuenth). Wherefore the solide AX is equall to the solide GO. But the halfe of the solide AX is the Prisme ABCDEF, and the halfe of the solide GO is the Prisme GHKMON. Wherfore the Prisme ABCDEF is equall to the Prisme GHKMON. If therefore there be two Prismes vnder equall altitudes, and the one haue to his base a parallelogramme, &amp; the other a triangle, and if the parallelogramme be double to the triangle: those Prismes are equall the one to the other: which was required to be proued.
               
               This Proposition and the demonstration thereof are not hard to conceaue by the former figures: but ye may for your fuller vnderstanding of thē take two equall Parallelipipedons equilate
                     •
                   and equiangle the one to the other described of pasted paper or such like matter, and in the base of the one Parallelipipedon draw a diagonall line, and draw an other diagonall line in the vpper superficies opposite vnto the said diagonall line drawen in the base. And in one of the parallelogrammes which are set vpon the base of the other Parallelipipedon draw a diagonall line, and drawe an other diagonall line in the parallelogramme opposite to the same. For so if ye extend plaine superficieces by those diagonall lines there will be made two Prismes in ech body. Ye must take heede that ye put for the bases of eche of these Parallelipipedons equall parallelogrāmes. And then note thē with letters according to the letters of the figures before described in the plaine. And cōpare thē with the demonstration, and they will make both it and the Proposition very clere vnto you. They will also geue great light to the Corollary following added by Flussas.

                  And forasmuch as by the 33. proposition, like parallelipipedons which are the doubles of their Prismes are in treble proportion the one to the other that their sides of like proportion are, it is manifest, that Prismes being their halues (which haue the one to the other the same proportion that their wholes haue, by the 15 of the fiueth) and hauing the selfe same sides that thei
                        •
                      parallelipipedons haue, are the one to the other in treble proportion of that which the sides of like proportion are.
                  And for that Prismes are the one to the other in the same proportion that their parallelipipedons are, and the bases of the Prismes (being all either triangles or parallelogrāmes) are the one to the other in the same proportion that the bases of the parallelipipedons are, whose altitudes also are alwayes equall, we may by the 34. proposition conclude, that the bases of the prismes and the bases of the parallelipipedons their doubles (being ech the one to the other in one and the selfe same proportion) are to the altitudes, in the same proportion that the bases of the double solides, namely, of the parallelipipedons are. For if the bases of the equall parallelipipedōs be reciprokall with their altitudes, then their halues which are Prismes shall haue their bases reciprokall with their altitudes.
                  By the 36. proposition we may conclude, that if there be three right lines proportionall, the angle of a Prisme made of these three lines (being common with the angle of his parallelipipedon which is double) doth make a prisme, which is equall to the Prisme described of the middle line, and contayning the like angle, consisting also of equall sides. For a
                        •
                      in the parallelipipedon, so also in the Prisme, this one thing is required, namely, that the three dimensions of the proportionall lines do make an angle like vnto the angle contayned of the middle line taken three tymes. Now then if the solide angle of the Prisme be made of those three right lines, there shall of them be made an angle like to the angle of the parallelipipedon which is double vnto it. Wherefore it followeth of necessitie, that the Prismes which are alwayes the halues of the Parallelipipedons, are equiangle the one to the other, as also are their doubles, although they be not equilater: and therefore those halues of equall solides are equall the one to the other: namely, that which is described of the middle proportionall line is equall to that which is described of the three proportionall lines.
                  By the 37. proposition also we may conclude the same touching Prismes which was concluded

touching Parallelipipedons. For forasmuch as Prismes, described like &amp; in like sort of the lines geuen, are the halues of the Parallelipipedons which are like and in like sort described, it followeth that these Prismes haue the one to the other the same proportion that the solides which are their doubles haue. And therfore if the lines which describe them be porportionall, they shalbe proportionall, and so conuersedly according to the rule of the sayd 37. proposition.
                  But forasmuch as the 39. proposition supposeth the opposite superficiall sides of the solide to be parallelogrammes, and the same solide to haue one diameter, which thinges a Prisme can not haue, therefore this proposition can by 
                        •

                        Sided Columnes.
                      forasmuch as by the second Corollary of the 25. of this booke it hath bene declared, that such solides are composed of Prismes, it may easely be proued that their nature is such, as is the nature of the Prismes, whereof they are composed. Wherefore a parallelipipedon being by the 27. proposition of this booke described, there may also be described the halfe thereof, which is a Prisme: and by the description of Prismes, there may be composed a solide like vnto a solide geuen composed of Prismes. So that it is manifest, that that which the 29. 30. 31. 32. 33. 34. and 37. propositions set forth touching parallelipipedons, may well be applyed also to these kyndes of solides.

            IN THIS TVVELVETH BOOKE, EVCLIDE setteth forth the passions and proprieties of Pyramids, Prismes, Cones, Cylinders, and Spheres. And compareth Pyramids, first to Pyramids, then to Prismes: so likewise doth he Cones, and Cylinders. And lastly he compareth Spheres the one to the other. But before he goeth to the treatie of those bodies, he proueth that, like Poligonon figures inscribed in circles, and also the circles thē selues are in proportion the one to the other, as the squares of the diameters of those circles are. Because that was necessary to be proued, for the confirmation of certayne passions and proprieties of those bodies.
            
               ¶The 1. Theoreme. The 1. Proposition. Like Poligonon figures described in circles: are in that proportion the one to the other, that the squares of their diameters are.
               SVppose that there be two circles ABCDE, and FGHKL, and in them let there be described like Poligonon figures, namely, ABCDE, and FGHKL, and let the diameters of the circles be BM, and GN. Then I say, that as the square of the line BM is to the square of the line GN, so is the Poligonon figure ABCDE to the Poligonon figure FGHKL.Construction. Drawe these right lines BE, AM, GL, and FN. And forasmuch as the Poligonon figure ABCDE is like to the Poligonon figure FGHKL,Demonstration. therefore the angle BAE is equall to the angle

GFL, and as the line BA is to the line AE, so is the line GF to the line FL (by the definition of like Poligonon figures). Now therefore there are two triangles BAE and GFL,

hauing one angle of the one equall to one angle of the other, namely, the angle BAE equall to the angle GFL, and the sides about the equall angles are proportionall. Wherefore (by the first definition of the sixt) the triangle ABE is equiangle to the triangle FGL. Wherefore the angle AEB is equall to the angle FLG. But (by the 21. of the third) the angle AEB is equall to the angle AMB, for they consiste vpon one and the selfe same circumference: and

by the same reason the angle FLG is equall to the angle FNG. Wherfore the angle AMB is equall to the angle FNG. And the right angle BAM, is (by the 4. petition) equall to the right angle GFN. Wherefore the angle remayning, is equall to the angle remayning. Wherefore the triangle AMB is equiangle to the triangle FNG. Wherefore proportionally as the line BM is to the line GN, so is the line BA to the line GF. But the square of the line BM is to the square of the line GN in double proportion of that which the line BM is to the line GN (by the Corollary of the 20. of the sixt). And the Poligonon figure ABCDE is to the Poligonon figure FGHKL in double proportion of that which the line BA is to the line GF (by the 
                     •
                  0. of the sixt). Wherefore (by the 11. of the fift) as the square of the line BM is to the square of the line GN, so is the Poligonon figure ABCDE, to the Poligonon figure FGHKL. Wherefore like Poligonon figures described in circles, are in that proportion the one to the other, that the squares of the diameters are: which was required to be demonstrated.

                     By Archimedes second Theoreme (as I haue here alleaged them) it is manifest, that a parallelogramme contained, either vnder the semidiameter and halfe the circumference, or vnder the halfe semidiameter and whole circumference of any circle, is equall to the circle: by the 41. of the first: and first of the six

Or you may vse the halfe semidiameter, and the whole portion of the circumference as sides of the said parallelogramme.

                     A Corollary. 1.
                     
                        Wherefore if two circles be propounded, which suppose to be A and B, as the circumference of A is to the circumference of B, so is the

diameter of A to the diameter of B.
                     
                     For by the former Theoreme, as the circumference of A, is to his own diameter, so is the circumference of B, to his own diameter: Wherfore, alternately, as the circumference of A, is to the circumference of B, so is the diameter of A, to the diameter of B: Which was required to be demonstrated.

               SVppose that there be two circles ABCD, and EFGH, and let their diameters be BD and FH. Then I say, that as the square of the line DB is to the square of the line FH,

                     Two cases in this proposition.
                     The first case.
                   so is the circle ABCD to the circle EFGH. For if the circle ABCD be not vnto the circle EFGH, as the square of the line BD is to the square of the line FH: then the square of the line BD shall be to the square of the line FH, as the circle ABCD is to a superficies, either lesse then the circle EFGH, or greater. First let the square of the line BD be to the square of the line FH, as the circle ABCD is to a superficies lesse then the circle EFGH, namely, to the superficies S. Describe (by the 6. of the fourth) in the circle EFGH a square EFGH. Now this square thus described is greater then the halfe of the circle EFGH. For if by the pointes E, F, G, H, we drawe right lines

touching the circle,
                     That a square within any circle described is bigger than halfe the circle.
                     That the Isosceles triangles, without the square, are greater then halfe the segments wherin they are.
                   the square EFGH, is the halfe of the square described about the circle, but the square described about the circle, is greater then the circle. Wherefore the square EFGH, which is inscribed in the circle, is greater then the halfe of the circle EFGH. Deuide the circumferences EF, FG, GH, and HE, into two equall partes in the pointes K, L, M, N. And drawe these right lines EK, KF, FL, LG, GM, MH, HN, and NE. Wherefore euery one of these triangles EKF, FLG, GMH, and HNE, is greater then the halfe

of the segmēt of the circle which is described about it. For if by the pointes K, L, M, N, be drawen lines touching the circle, and then be made perfecte the parallelogrāmes made of the right lines EF, FG, GH, &amp; HE, euery one of the triangles EKF, FLG, GMH, &amp; HNE, is the halfe of the parallelogragrāme which is described about it (by the 41. of the first): but the segmēt described about it is lesse then the parallelogramme. Wherefore euery one of these triangles EKF, FLG, GMH, and HNE, is greater then the halfe of the segment of the circle which is described about it. Now then deuiding the circumferences remaining into two equall partes, and drawing right lines from the pointes where those diuisions are made, &amp; so continually doing this, we shall at the length (by the 1. of the tenth) leaue certaine segmentes of the circle, which shall be lesse then the excesse, wherby the circle EFGH excedeth the superficies S. For it hath bene proued in the first Proposition of the tenth booke, that two vnequall magnitudes being geuen, if from the greater be taken away more then the halfe, and likewise againe from the residue more then the hal
                     •
                  e, and so continually, there shall at the length be left a certaine magnitude which shall be lesse then the lesse magnitude geuen. Let there be such segmentes left, &amp; let the segmentes of the circle EFGH, namely, which are made by the lines EK, KF, FL, LG, GM, MH, HN, and NE, be lesse then the excesse, whereby the circle EFGH excedeth the superficies S. Wherefore the residue, namely, the Poligonon figure EKFLGMHN, is greater then the superficies S. Inscribe in the circle ABCD a Poligonon figure like to the Poligonon figure EKFLGMHN, and let the same be AXBOCPDR. Wherefore (by the Proposition next going before) as the square of the line BD is to the square of the line FH, so is the Poligonon figure AXBOCPDR to the Poligonon figure EKFLGMHN. But as the square of the line BD is to the square of the line FG, so is the circle ABCD supposed to be to the superficies S. Wherefore (by the 11. of the fift) as the circle ABCD is to the superficies S, so is the Poligonon figure AXBOCPDR to the Poligonon figure EKFLGMHN. Wherefore alternately (by the 16. of the fift) as the circle ABCD is to the Poligonon figure described in it, so is the superficies S to the Poligonon figure EKFLGMHN. But the circle ABCD is greater then the Poligonon figure described in it. Wherefore also the superficies S is greater then the Poligonon figure EKFLGHMN: but it is also lesse: which is impossible. Wherefore as the square of the line BD is to the square of the line FH,

so is not the circle ABCD to any superficies lesse then the circles EFGH.
               
                  Second case.In like sort also may wproue, that as the square of the line FH is to the square of the line BD, so is not the circle EFGH to any superficies lesse then the circle ABCD. I say, namely, that as the square of the

line BD is to the square of the line FH, so is not the circle ABCD to any superficies greater thē then the circle EFGH. For if it be possible, let it be to a greater, namely, to the superficies S. Wherfore by conuersion, as the square of the line FH is to the square of the line BD, so is the superficies S to the circle ABCD. This As

Wherefore as the square of the line BD is to the square of the line FH, so is not the circle ABCD to any superficies greater then the circle EFGH. And it is also proued that it is not, to any lesse. Wherefore as the square of the l

                  ne BD is to the square of the line FH, so is the circle ABCD to the circle EFGH. Wherefore circles are in that proportion the one to the other, that the squares of their diameters are: which was required to be proued.
               
                  ¶ An Assumpt.
                  I say now, that the superficies S being

greater then the circle EFGH, as the superficies S is to the circle ABCD, so is the circle EFGH to some superficies lesse then the circle ABCD. For, as the superficies S is to the circle ABCD, so let the circle EFGH be to the superficies T. Now I say, that the superficies T is lesse then the circle ABCD. For for that as the superficies S is to the circle ABCD, so is the circle EFGH to the superficies T, therefore alternately (by the 16. of the fift) as the superficies S is to the circle EFGH, so is the circle ABCD to the superficies T. But the superficies S is greater then the circle EFGH (by supposition). Wherefore also the circle ABCD is greater then the superficies T (by the 14. of the fift). Wherefore as the superficies S is to the circle

ABCD, so is the circle EFGH to some superficies lesse then the circle ABCD: which was required to be demonstrated.

That circle therefore whose diameter is AB, is the circle conteyning the magnitude, by which ABC is greater then DEF. Wherefore two vnequal circles being geuen, we haue found a circle equall to the excesse of the greater to the lesse: which ought to be doone.

At F, to the line AC let a perpēdicular be drawne FB, and let it mete the circūferēce at the poynt B. From the poynt B to the points A and C, let right lines be drawne: BA and BC.

by reason that ABC is a triangle rectangle: wherfore

by the 47. of the first the squares of BA and BC are equall to the square of AC: And so by this second it is mani

                              •
                            to L. And by construction,

on, as AD is to HK, so is HK to BF: wherefore HK is to BF, as BF is to L: by the 11. of the fifth, wherfore the 4. lines are in continuall proportion.] Wherefore as the first is to the third, that is AD to BF, so is the square of the first to the square of the second:
that is, the square of AD, to the square of HK: by the corollary of the 20. of the sixth. And by the same corollary, as HK is to L, so is the square of HK to the square of BF. But by alternate proportion, the line AD is to BF, as HK is to L: wherefore the square of AD is to the square of HK, as the square of HK is to the square of BF. Wherefore the square of HK, is middell proportionall, betwene the square of AD and the square of BF. But as the squares are one to the other, so are the circles (whose diameters produce the same squares) one to the other, by this secōd of the twelfth: wherfore the circle whose diameter is the line HK, is middel proportional, betwene the circles whose diameters are the line a AD and BF. Wherefore betwene two circles geuen, we haue found a circle middell proportionall: which was requisite to be doone.

                           Hereby it is manifest, three lines or more, being in continuall proportion, that the circles hauing those lines to their diameters, are also in continuall proportion.
                        
                        As of three, our demonstration hath already proued: so of fower, will the proufe go forward

Wherefore, seing DM, MN, and NO, are, by construction, continually proportioned, in the proportion of X to Y: So likewise, are DF, FG, and GE, in continuall proportion, in the proportion of X to Y, by the 11. of the fift.

But DF, FG, and GE, were proued to be in continuall proportion, in the proportion of X to Y: Wherefore, the three parallelogrammes DI, FK, and GC, by the 11. of the fifth, are also in continuall proportion, and in the same, which X is in, to Y. Let three squares be made, equall to the three parallelogrammes DI, FK, and GC: by the last of the second: Let the sides of those squares be, orderly, S, T, and V. Forasmuch as, it was last concluded that the three parallelogrammes,

                        DI, FK, and GC (which are equall to the square ACDE) are also in continuall proportion, in the proportion of X to Y, therefore their equalls, namely, the three squares of S, T, &amp; V, are also equall to the whole square ACDE, and in continuall proportion, in the proportion of X to Y. Wherefore the three circles, whose diameters are S, T, and V, are equall to the circle, whose diameter is AC, the side of the square ACDE, and also in continuall proportion, in the proportion of X to Y: by this second of the twelfth. But, by construction, AC is the diameter of the circle ABC. Wherefore we haue found three circles, equall to ABC: namely, the circle, whose diameter is S: and the circle, whose diameter is T: and the circle, whose diameter is V: which three circles, also, are in continuall propo

                           Hereby, it is euident, that a circle geuen, we may finde circles 4, 5, 6, 10, 20, 100, 1000, or how many soeuer shall be appointed, being in continuall proportion, in any proportion, geuen betwene two right lines: which circles, all together, shall be equall to the circle geuen.
                        
                        For, euermore deuiding the one side of the chiefe square (which is made of the diameter of the circle geuen) into so many partes, as circles are to be made: so that betwene those partes be continued the proportion geuen betwene two right lines

                     Suppose the three circles

geuen to be A, B, and C, and let the proportion geuen, be that which is betwene the right lines X &amp; Y. I say, three other circles are to be found, equall to A, B, and C, &amp; with all, in continuall proportion, in the proportion of X to Y. By the 2. Corollary of my 4. Probleme,

                           Demonstration.
                         For, by cōstruction, the circle D is equall to the circles A, B, &amp; C: and by construction likewise, the circles E, F, and G, are equall to the same circle D: Wherfore the three circles E, F, &amp; G, are equall to the three circles A, B, &amp; C: and by construction E, F,

                         to the line Y. Wherefore E, F, and G, are equall to A, B, and C: and in continuall proportion, in the proportion of X to Y. Three circles, therefore, being geuen, we haue found three circles, equall to them, and also in continuall proportion, in any proportion geuen, betwene two right lines. Which was requisite to be done.

Euery Pyramis hauing a triangle to his base: may be deuided into two Pyramids equall and like the one to the other, and also like to the whole, hauing also triangles to their bases, and into two equall prismes: and those two prismes are greater then the halfe of the whole Pyramis.
               SVppose that there be a Pyramis, whose base let be the triangle ABC, and his toppe the point D. Then I say, that the Pyramis ABCD may be deuided into two Pyramids equall and like the one to the other, and also like to the whole, hauing also triangles to their bases, and into two equall prismes, and those two

prismes are greater then the halfe of the whole Pyramis

                     ided into two Pyramis equall and like the one to the other, and also to the whole, &amp; hauing triangles to their bases. therfore (by the 2. of the sixt) the line EH is a parallel to the line DB. And by the same reason, the line HK is a parallel to the line AB: Wherefore HEKB is a parallelogramme. Wherefore the line HK is equall to the line EB. But the line EB is equall to the line AE: Wherefore the line AE is equall to the line HK. And the line AH is equall to the line HD. Now therfore there are two lines AE and AH, equall to two lines KH and HD, the one to the other, and the angle EAH is (by the 29. of the first) equall to the angle KHD: Wherefore (by the 4. of the first) the 
                     •
                  ase EH is equall to the base KD. Wherefore the triangle AEH, is equall and like to the triangle HKD. And by the same reason also the triangle AHG, is equall and like to the triangle HLD. And forasmuch as two right lines EH &amp; HG touching the one the other, are parallels to two right lines KD and DL touching also the one the other, and not being in one and the selfe same plaine superficies with the two first: those lines (by the 10. of the eleuenth) containe equall angles. Wherefore the angle EHG is equall to the angle KDL. And forasmuch as two right lines EH and HG, are equall to two right lines KD &amp; DL, the one to the other, and the angle EHG is (by the 10. of the eleuenth) equall to the angle

                  DL, therefore (by the 4. of the first) the base EG is equall to the base LK. Wherefore the triangle EHG is equall and like to the triangle KDL. And by the same reason also the triangle AEG is equall and like to the triangle HKL. Wherefore the Pyramis, whose ba

                  e is the triangle AEG, and toppe the point H, is equall and like to the Pyramis, whose base is the triangle HKL, and toppe the point D.
               And forasmuch as to one of the sides of the triangle ADB, namely, to the side AB, is drawen

                  DB is equiangle to the triangle DHK, and their sides are proportionall (by the Corollary of the 
                     •
                  . of the sixt). Wherefore the triangle ADB is like to the triangle DHK. And by the same reason also the triangle DBC is like to the triangle DKL, and the triangle ADC to the triangle DHL. And forasmuch as two right lines BA and AC touching the one the other, are parallels to two right lines KH and HL, touching also the one the other, but not being in one and the selfe same super

                  icies with the two first lines, therefore (by the 10. of the eleuenth) they containe equall angles. Wherefore the angle BAC is equall to the angle KHL. And as the line BA is to the line AC, so is the line KH to the line HE. Wherefore the triangle ABC is like to the triangle KHL. Wherfore the whole Pyramis whose base is the triangle ABC &amp; top the point D, is like to the pyramis whose base is the triangle HKL, and toppe the point D. But the pryamis whose base is the triangle HKL and toppe the point D, is proued to be like to the pyramis whose base is the triangle AEG and toppe the poynt H. Wherefore also the pyramis whose base is the triangle ABC, and toppe the poynt D, is like to the pyramis whose base is the triangle AEG and toppe the poynt H (by the 21. of the sixth).The conclusion of the first part. Wherefore either of these pyramids AEGH and HKLD is like to the whole pyramis ABCD.

               And forasmuch as the line BF is equall to the line FC, therefore (by the 41. of the first) the parallelogramme EBFG is double to the triangle GFC. And forasmuch as if there be two Prismes of equall altitudes, and the one haue to his base a parallelogramme, and the other a triangle, and if the parallelogramme be double to the triangle, those Prismes are (by the 40. of the eleuenth) equall the one to the other: therefore the Prisme contained vnder the two triangles BKF and EHG, and vnder the three parallelogrammes EBFG, EBKH, and KHFG,Conclusion of the second part. is equall to the Prisme contained vnder the two triangles GFC, and HKL, and vnder the three parallelogrammes KFCL, LCGH, and HKFG.
               And it is manifest, that both these Prismes, of which the base of one is the parallelogramme EBFG,Demonstratiō of the last part that the two Prismes are greater then the halfe of the whole Pyramis. and the opposi

For if we drawe these right lines EF and EK, the Prisme whose base is the parallelogramme EBFG, and the opposite vnto it the right line HK, is greater then the Pyramis whose base is the triangle EBF, &amp; toppe the point K. But the Pyramis whose base is the triangle EBF, and toppe the point K, is equall to the Pyramis whose base is the triangle AEG and toppe the point H, for they are contained vnder equall and like plaine superficieces. Wherefore also the Prisme whose base is the parallelogramme EBFG and the opposite vnto it the right line HK, is greater then the Pyramis, whose base is the triangle AEG, and toppe the point H. But the prisme whose base is the parallelogramme EBFG, and the opposite vnto it the right line HK, is equall to the prisme, whose base is the triangle GFC, and the opposite side vnto it the triangle HKL: And the Pyramis whose base is the triangle AEG, and toppe the point H, is equall to the Pyramis, whose base is the triangle HKL, and toppe the point D.Conclusion of the last part. Wherefore the foresaid two prismes are greater then the foresaid two Pyramids, whose bases are the triangles AEG, HKL, and toppes the pointes H and D. Wherefore the whole Pyramis whose base is the triangle ABC,Conclusion of the whole proposition. and toppe the point D, is deuided into two Pyramids equall and like the one to the other, and like also vnto the whole Pyramis, hauing also triangles to their bases, and into two equall prismes, and the two prismes are greater then halfe of the whole Pyramis: which was required to be demonstrated.

As for example, in this third propositiō it is sayd that, Euery pyramis hauing a triangle to 
                     •
                  is base, may be deuided into two pyramids. &amp;c. Here first describe a pyramis of pasted paper ha

                     ing his base triangled (it skilleth not whether it be equilater, or equiangled, or not, only in this proposition is required that the base be a triangle. Then for that the proposition supposeth the base of the pyramis to be the triangle ABC, note the base of your pyramis which you haue described with the letters ABC, and the toppe of your pyramis with the letter D: For so is required in the proposition. And thus haue you your body ordered ready to the construction. Now in the construction it is required that ye deuide the lines, AB, BC, CA. &amp;c, namely, the sixe lines which are the sids of the fower triangles contayning

the piramis, into two equall partes in the poyntet 
                        •
                     , F, G, &amp;c. That is, ye must deuide the line AB of your pyramis into two equall partes, and note the poynt of the deuision with the letter E, and so the line BC being deuided into two equall partes, note the poynt of the deuision with the letter F. And so the rest, and this order follow ye as touching the rest of the construction there put, and when ye haue finished the construction, compare your body thus described with the demonstration: and it will make it very playne and easy to be vnderstāded.

                  ¶An other demonstration after Campane of the 3. proposition.
                  Suppose that there be a Pyramis ABCD hauing to his base the triangle BCD, and let his toppe be the solide angle A: from which let there be drawne three subtended lines AB, AC, and AD to the three angles of the base, and deuide all the sides of the base into two equall partes in the three poyntes E, F, G: deuide also the three subtēded lines AB, AC, and AD in two equall partes in the three points H, K, L. And draw in the base these two lines EF and EG:

So shall the base of the pyramis be deuided into three superficieces: whereof two are the two triangles BEF, and EGD, which are like both the one to the other, and also to the whole base, by the 2 part of the secōd of the sixth, &amp; by the definitiō of like super

                     iciec
                        •
                     s, &amp; they are equal the one to the other, by the 8. of the first: the third superficies is a quadrangled parallelogramme, namely, EFGC: which is double to the triangle EGD, by the 40. and 41. of the first. Now then agayne from the poynt H draw vnto the points E and F these two subtendent lines HE and HF: draw also a subtended line from the poynt K to the poynt G. And draw these lines HK, KL, and LH. Wherefore the whole pyramis ABCD is deuided into two pyramids, which are HBEF, and AHKL, and into two prismes of which the one is EHFGKC, and is set vpon the quadrangled base CFGE: the other is EGDHKL, and hath to his base the triangle EGD. Now as touching the two pyramids HBEF and AHKL, that they are equall the one to the other, and also that they are like both the one to the other and also to the whole, it is manifest by the definition of equall and like bodyes, and by the 10. of the eleuenth, and by 2. part of the second of the sixth. And that the two Prismes are equall it is manifest by the last of the eleuenth. And now that both the prismes taken together are greater then the halfe of the whole pyramis, hereby it is manifest, for that either of them may be deuided into two pyramids, of which the one is a triangular pyramis equall to one of the two pyramids into which together with the two prismes is deuided the whole pyramis, and the other is a quadrangled pyramis double to the other pyramis. Wherefore it is playne that the two prismes taken together are three quarters of the whole

pyramis deuided. But if ye are desirous to know the proportiō betwen them, reade the 
                        •
                     , of this booke. But now here to this purpose it shall be sufficient to know, that the two prismes taken together do exceede in quantity the two partial pyramids taken together, into which together with the two prismes the whole pyramis was deuided.
               
            
            
               ¶The 4. Theoreme. The 4. Proposition. If there be two Pyramids vnder equall altitudes, hauing triangles to their bases, and either of those Pyramids be deuided into two Pyramids equall the one to the other, and like vnto the whole, and into two 
                     •
                  quall Prismes, and againe if in either of the Pyramids made of the two first Pyramids be still obserued the same order and maner: then as the base of the one Pyramis is to the base of the other Pyramis, so are all the Prismes which are in the one Pyramis to all the Prismes which are in the other, being equall in multitude with them.
               SVppose that there be two Pyramids vnder equall altitudes, hauing triangles to their bases, namely, ABC, and DEF, and hauing to their toppes the pointes G and H. And let either of these pyramids be diuided into two pyramids equall the one to the other, and like vnto the whole, and into two equall prismes (according to the methode of the former Proposition). And againe, let either of those pyramids so
                     •
                   made of the two first pyramids, be imagined to be after the same order deuided, and so do continually. Then I say, that as the base ABC is to the base DEF, so are all the prismes which are in the pyramis ABCG, to all

the prismes which are in the pyramis DEFH being equall in multitude with them. For forasmuch as the line BX is equall to the line XC, and the line AL to the line LC: (For as we saw in the construction pertayning to the former Proposition, al the sixe sides of the whole pyramids, are ech deuided into two equall parts, the like of which construction is in this proposition also supposed): therefore the line XL is a parallel to the line AB, &amp; the triangle ABC, is like to the triangle LXC, (by the Corollary of the second of the sixth): and by the same reason the triangle DEF is like to the triangle RWF. And forasmuch as the line BC is double to the line CX, and the line FE to the line FW: therefore as the line BC is to the line CX, so is the line EF to the line FW. And vpon the lines BC and CX are described rectiline figures like and in like sort set, namely, the triangles ABC and LXC, and vpon the lines EF and FW are also described rectiline figures, like and in like sort set, namely, the triangles DEF &amp; RWF
                     •
                   But if there be fower right lines proportionall, the rectiline figures described of them being like und in like sort set, shall also be proportionall (by the 22. of the sixt). Wherefore as the

triangle ABC is to the triangle LXC, so is the triangle DEF to the triangle RWF. Wherefore alternately (by the 16. of the fift) as the triangle ABC is to the triangle DEF, so is the triangle LXC to the triangle RWF.An Assūpt. But as the triangle LXC is to the triangle RWF, so is the prisme whose base is the triangle LXC, and the opposite side vnto it the triangle OMN, to the prisme whose base is the triangle RWF, and the opposite side vnto it the triangle STV (by the Corollary of the 40. of the eleuenth). For these prismes are vnder one &amp; the selfe same altitude, namely, vnder the halfe of the altitude of the whole Pyramids, which Pyramids are supposed to be vnder one and the selfe same altitude: this is also proued in the Assumpt following). Wherefore (by the 11. of the fift) as the triangle ABC is to the triangle DEF, so is the

prisme whose base is the triangle LXC, and the opposite side vnto it the triangle OMN, to the prisme whose base is the triangle RWF, and the opposite side vnto it the triangle STV. And forasmuch as there are two prismes in the pyramis ABCG equal the one to the other, &amp; two prismes also in the pyramis DEFH equall the one to the other: therefore as the prisme, whose base is the parallelogrāme BKLX, and the opposite side vnto it the line MO, is to the prisme, whose base is the triangle LXC, and the opposite side vnto it the triangle OMN, so is the prisme, whose base is the parallelogramme PERW, and the opposite vnto it the line ST, to the prisme, whose base is the triangle RWF, and the opposite side vnto it the triangle STV. Wherfore by cōposition (by the 18. of the fift) as the prismes KBXLMO, &amp; LXCMNO, are to the prisme LXCMNO, so are the prismes PEWRST, and RWFSTV, to the prisme RWFSTV. Wherefore alternately (by the 16. of the fift) as the two prismes KBXLMO, and LXCMNO, are to the two prismes PEWRST, and RWFSTV, so is the prisme LXCMNO to the prisme RWFSTV. But as the prisme LXCMNO is to the prisme RWFSTV, so haue we proued that the base LXC is to the base RWF, and the base ABC to the base DEF. Wherefore (by the 16. of the fift) as the triangle ABC is to the triangle DEF, so are both the prismes which are in the pyramis ABCG, to both the prismes which are in the pyramis DEFH. And in like sort if we diuide the other pyramids after the selfe same maner, namely, the pyramis OMNG, and the pyramis STVH: as the base OMN is to the base STV, so shall both the prismes that are in the pyramis OMNG, be to both the prismes which are in the pyramis STVH. But as the base OMN is to the base STV, so is the base ABC to the base DEF. Wherefore (by the 11. of the fift) as the base ABC is to the base DEF, so are the two prismes that are in the pyramis ABCG, to the two prismes that are in the pyramis DEFH, and the two prismes that are in the pyramis OMNG, to the two prismes that are in the pyramis STVH, and the fower prismes to the fower prismes. And so also shall it followe in the prismes made by diuiding the two pyramids AKLO, and DPRS, and of all the other pyramids in generall, being equall in multitude.
               
                  [And that as the triangle LXC is to the triangle RWF, so is the prisme whose base is the triangle LXC and the opposite side OMN,An Assumpt. to the prisme whose base is the triangle RWF and the opposite side the triangle STV, may thus be proued. For in the selfe same construction, imagine perpendicular lines to be drawne from the poyntes G and H to the two playne superficieces wherein are the triangles ABC and DEF. Now those perpendicular lines shall be equall the one to the other, for that the two pyramids are supposed to be of equall altitude. And forasmuch as two right lines, namely, GC, and the perpendicular line drawne from the poynt G, are deuided by two parallel playne superficieces, namely, ABC and OMN, therfore (by the 17. of the eleuenth) the partes of the lines deuided are proportionall. But the line GC is by the playne superficies OMN deuided into two equall partes in the poynt N. Wherefore also the perpendicular line drawne from the poynt G to the playne superficies wherein is the triangle ABC, is deuided into two equall partes by the superficies OMN: &amp; by the same reason also the perpendicular line which is drawne from the poynt H to the playne superficies DEF is deuided into two equall partes, by the playne superficies STV. And the perpendiculars drawne from the poyntes G and H to the playne superficieces ABC and DEF are equal. Wherefore also the perpendicular lines which are drawne from the triangles OMN and STV to the playne superficieces ABC and DEF are equal the one to the other. Wherfore also the prismes whose bases are the triangles LXC and RWF and the opposite sides the triangles OMN and STV, are of equall altitude. Wherefore also the parallelipipedons which are described of the forsayd prismes and being equall in altitude with them, are the one to the other, as the base of the one is to the base of the other. Wherefore also as the halfe of the bases of those parallelipipedons, namely, as the base LXC is to the base RWF, so are the forsayd prismes the one to the other.] If therfore there be two pyramis vnder equall altitudes, hauing triangles to their bases and either of those pyramids be deuided into two pyramids equall the one to the other and like vnto the whole, and into two equall prismes,Conclusion of the whole. and agayne if in either of the pyramids made of the two first pyramids be still obserued the same order and maner: then as the base of the one pyramis is to the base of the other piramis, so all the prismes which are in the one pyramis to all the prismes which are in the other being equall in multitude: which was required to be proued.
            
            
               ¶ The 5. Theoreme. The 5. Proposition. Pyramids consisting vnder one and the selfe same altitude, hauing triangles to their bases: are in that proportion the one to the other that their bases are.
               SVppose that these two Pyramids, whose bases are the triangles ABC &amp; DEF, and toppes the pointes G and H, be vnder equall altitudes. Then I say, that as the base ABC is to the base DEF, so is the pyramis ABCG to the pyramis DEFH. For if the pyramis ABCG be not to the pyramis DEFH, as the base ABC is to the base DEF, then as the base ABC is to the base DEF,Demonstration leading to an impossibilitie. so is the pyramis ABCG to a solide, either lesse then the pyramis DEFH, or greater. First let it be to some lesse, and let the same be X. And (by the 3. of the twelfth) let the pyramis DEFH be deuided into two pyramids equall the one to the other, and like vnto the whole, and into two equall prismes. Now the two prismes are greater then the halfe of the whole pyramis.

And againe (by the same) let the

pyramids which are made of the diuision, be in like sort diuided, and do this continually, vntill there remaine some pyramids made of the pyramis DEFH, which are lesse then the excesse, whereby the pyramis DEFH excedeth the solide X. Let such pyramids be taken, and for example sake, let those pyramids be DPRS, &amp; STVH. Wherfore the prismes remayning which are in the pyramis DEFH, are greater then the solide X. Deuide (by the Proposition next going before) the pyramis ABCG in like sort, &amp; as many times as the pyramis DEFH 
                     •
                  s deuided. Wherefore (by the same) as the base ABC is to the base DEF, so are all the prismes which are in the pyramis ABCG, to all the prismes which are in the pyramis DEFH. But as the base ABC is to the base DEF, so is the pyramis ABCG to the solide X. Wherefore (by the 11. of the fift) as the pyramis ABCG, is to the solide X, so are the prismes which are in the pyramis ABCG, to the prismes which are in the pyramis DEFH. Wherefore alternately (by the 16. of the fift) as the pyramis ABCG is to the prismes which are in it, so is the solide X, to the prismes which are i
                     •
                   the pyramis DEFH. But the pyramis ABCG is greater then the prismes which are in it. Wherefore also the solide X is greater then the prismes which are in the pyramis DEFH (by the 14. of the fift). But it is supposed to be lesse which is impossible. Wherefore as the base ABC is to the base DEF, so is not the pyramis ABCG to any solide lesse then the pyramis DEFH.
               I say moreouer, that as the base ABC is to the base DEF, so is not the pyramis ABCG,  to any solide greater then the pyramis DEFH. For if it be possible, let it be vnto some greater, namely, to the solide X. Wherefore (by conuersion, by the Corollary of the 4. of the

ABCED into these triangles ABC, ACD, &amp; CDE, and likewise the base FGHKL into these triangles FGH, FHL, and HKL. And imagine that vpon euery one of those triangles be set a pyramis of equall altitude with the two pyramids put at the beginning.Demonstration. And for that as the triangle ABC is to the triangle ADC, so is the pyramis ABCM to the pyramis ADCM (by the 5. of this boke). Wherfore, by composition (by the 18. of the fift) as the fower sided figure ABCD is to the triangle ACD, so is the pyramis ABCDM to the pyramis ACDM. But as the triangle ACD is to the triangle CDE, so is the pyramis ACDM to the pyramis CDEM. Wherefore of equalitie (by the 22. of the fift) as the base ABCD is to th

Wherfore againe by composition (by the 18. of the fift) as the base ABCDE is to the base CDE, so is the pyramis ABCEDM to the pyramis CDEM. And by the same reason also as the base FGHKL is to the base HKL, so is the pyramis FGHKLN to the pyramis HKLN. And forasmuch as there are two pyramids CDEM and HKLN, hauing triangles to their bases, and being vnder one and the selfe same altitude, therefore (by the 5. of the twelfth) as the base CDE is to the base HKL, so is the pyramis CDEM to the pyramis HKLN. Now for that as the base ABCED is to the base CDE, so is the pyramis ABCEDM to the pyramis CDEM. But as the base CDE is to the base HKL, so is the pyramis CDEM to the pyramis HKLN. Wherefore of equalitie (by the 22. of the fift) as the base ABCED is to the base HKL, so is the pyramis ABCEDM to the pyramis HKLN. But also as the base HKL is the base FGHKL, so is the Pyramis HKLN to to the pyramis FGHKLN. Wherefore againe of equalitie (by the 22. of the fift) as the base ABCED is to the base FGHKL, so is the pyramis ABCEDM to the pyramis FGHKLN. Wherefore pyramids consisting vnder one and the selfe same altitude, and hauing Polygonon figures to their bases, are in that proportion the one to the other, that their bases are: which was required to be proued.
            
            
               
               The 7. Theoreme. The 7. Proposition. Euery prisme hauing a triangle to his base, may be deuided into three pyramids equall the one to the other, hauing also triangles to their bases.
               SVppose that ABCDEF be a prisme, hauing to his base the triangle ABC, and the opposite side vnto it, the triangle DEF. Then I say that the prisme ABCDEF, may be deuided into three piramids equall the one to the other, and hauing triangles to their bases.Demonstration. Draw these right lines BD, EC, and CD. And forasmuch as ABED is a parallelogramme, and his diameter

is the line BD, therefore the triangle ABD is equall to the triangle EDB. Wherefore also the pyramis whose base is the triangle ABD, and toppe the poynt C, is equall to the pyramis whose base is the triangle EDB, &amp; toppe the point C, by the 5. of this booke. But the pyramis whose base is the triangle EDB, and toppe the poynt C, is one and the same which the pyramis whose base is the triangle EBC, and toppe the poynt D, for they are comprehended of the selfe same playne superficieces, namely, of ye triangles BDEDEC, DBC, and EBC. Wherefore also the pyramis whose base is the triangle ABD and toppe the poynt C, is equall to the pyramis whose base is the triangle EBC and toppe the point D. Againe forasmuch as BCFE is a parallelogramme, and the diameter thereof is EC, therefore the triangle ECF is equall to the triangle CBE. Wherefore also the pyramis whose base is the triangle EBC and toppe the poynt D, is equall to the pyramis, whose base is the triangle ECF and toppe the poynt D, by the 5. of this booke. But the pyramis whose base is the triangle BEC and toppe the poynt D, is proued to be equall to the pyramis whose base i

Wherfore also the pyramis whose base is the triangle CEF and toppe the poynt D, is equall to the pyramis whose base is the triangle ABD &amp; toppe the poynt C. Wherefore the prisme ABDEF is deuided into three equall pyramids hauing triangles to their bases. And forasmuch as the pyramis whose base is the triangle ABD and toppe the poynt C, is one &amp; the selfe same with the pyramis whose base is the triangle CAB &amp; toppe the poynt D (for they are contayned vnder the selfe same playne superficieces) but it hath bene proued that the pyramis whose base is the triangle ABD and toppe the poynt C, is the third pyramis of the prisme whose base is the triangle ABC a

Wherefore the pyramis whose base is the triangle ABC and toppe the poynt D is the third pyramis of the prisme, whose base is the triangle ABC, and opposite side the triangle DEF. Wherefore euery prisme hauing a triangle to his base, may be deuided into three pyramids equall the one to the other, hauing also triangles to their bases: which was required to be proued.
               
                  ¶ Corollary.
                  
                     Hereby it is manifest that euery pyramis is the third part of a prisme hauing one and the same base with it and also being vnder the selfe same altitude with it. For if the base of the prisme be any other rectiline figure thē a triangle, that also may be deuided into prismes which shal haue triangles to their bases.
                  
                  
                     Here Campane and Flussas adde certayne Corollaryes.
                  
                     First Corollary.
                     
                        Euery Prisme is treble to the Piramis, which hath the selfe same triangle to his base that the Prisme hath, and the selfe same altitude. As it is manifest by this propo

                     Second Corollary.
                     
                        If there be many Prismes vnder one and the same altitude, and hauing triangles to their bases,

                        and if the triangular bases be so ioyned together vpon one and the same playne, that they compose a Poligonon figure: A pyramis set vpon that base being a Poligonon figure, and vnder the same altitude, is the third part of that solide, which is compos

Wherefore Parallelipipedons are treble to Pyramids set vpon the selfe same base with them, and vnder the same altitude,

                         for that they contayne two Prismes.
                  
                  
                     Third Corollary.
                     
                        If two Prismes being vnder one and the selfe same altitude, haue to their bases either, both triangles, or both parallelogrammes, the Prismes are the one to the other, as their bases are.
                     
                     For forasmuch as those Prismes are equemultiqlices vnto the Pyram

                        ds vpon the selfe same bases, and vnder the same altitude, which Pyramids are in proportion as their bases, it is manifest (by the 15. of the fift), that the Prismes are in the proportion of the bases. For by the former Corollary, the Prismes are treble to the Pyramids s

                     Fourth Corollary.
                     
                        Prismes are in sesquealtera proportion to Pyramids which haue the selfe same quadrangled base that the Prismes haue, and are vnder the selfe same altitude.
                     
                     For, that Pyramis contayneth two Pyramids set vpon a triangular base of the same Prisme, for it is proued, that that Prisme is treble to the Pyramis which is set vpon the halfe of his quadrangled base, vnto which the other which is set vpon the whole base is double, by the sixth of this booke.
                  
                  
                     Fiueth Corollary.
                     
                        Wherefore we may in like sort conclude, that solides mencioned in the second Corollary (which solids Campane calleth sided Columnes) being vnder one and the selfe same altitude, are in proportion the one to the other, as their bases, which are poligonon figures.
                     
                     For they are in the proportion of the Pyramids or Prismes, set vpon the selfe same bases, and vnder the selfe same altitude, that is, they are in the proportiō of the bases of the sayde Pyramids or Prismes. For those solids may be deuided into Prismes hauing the selfe same altitude, when as their opposite bases may be deuided into triangles, by the 20 of the sixth. Vpon which triangles Prismes beyng set, are in proportion as their bases.
                     By this 7. Proposition it playnely appeareth that

For that it can be vnderstanded of those prismes onely which haue triangles to their like, equall, opposite, and parallel sides, or but of some sided columnes, and not of all: yet may that let be thus remoued away, to say that Euclide in that propositiō vsed genus pro specie, that is, the generall word for some special kinde therof: which thing also is not rare, not only with him, but also with other learned philosophers. Thus much I thought good by the way to note in farther defence of Euclide definition of a Prisme.
                  
               
            
            
               The 8. Theoreme. The 8. Proposition. Pyramids being like &amp; hauing triangles to their bases, are in treble proportion the one to the other, of that in which their sides of like proportion are.
               SVppose that these pyramids whose bases are the triangles GBC and HEF and toppes, the poyntes A and D be like, and in like sort described, and let AB and DE be sides of like proportion. Then I say that the pyramis ABCG is to the pyramis DEFH in treble proportiō, of that in which the side AB is to the side DE. Make perfect the parallelipipedons, namely, the solides BCKL &amp; EFXO. And forasmuch as the pyramis ABCG is like to the pyramis DEFH,Construction. therfore the angle ABC is equall to the angle DEF,Demonstration. &amp; the

angle GBC to the angle HEF, and moreouer the angle ABG to the angle DEH, and as the line AB is to the line DE, so is the line BC to the line EF, and the line BG to the line EH. And for that as the line AB is to the line DE, so is the line BC to the line EF, and the sides about the equall angles, are proportionall, therefore the parallelogramme BM is like to the parallelogrāme EP: and by the same reason the parallelogramme BN is like

to the parallelogramme ER, and the parellelogramme BK is like vnto the parallelogramme EX. Wherefore the three parallelogrammes BM, KB and BN are like to the three parallelogrammes EP, EX, and ER. But the three parallelogrammes BM, KB, and BN are equall and like to the three opposite parallelogrammes, and the three parallelogrammes EP, EX, and ER are equall and like to the three opposite parallelogrammes. Wherefore the parallelipipedons BCKL and EFXO are comprehended vnder playne superficieces like and equall in multitude. Wherefore the solide BCKL is like to the solide EFXO. But like parallelipipedons are (by the 33. of the eleuenth) in treble proportion the one to the other of that in which side of like proportion is to side of like proportion. Wherefore the solide BCKL is to the solide EFXO in treble proportion of that in which the side of like proportion AB is to the side of like proportion DE. But as the solide BCKL is to the solide EFXO, so is the pyramis ABCG to the pyramis DEFH (by the 15. of the fifth) for that the pyramis is the sixth part of this solide: for the prisme, being the halfe of the parallelipipedon is treble to the pyramis. Wherefore the pyramis ABCG is to the pyramis DEFH in treble proportion of that in which the side AB is to the side DE. Which was required to be proued.
               
                  Corollary.
                  
                     Hereby it is manifest that like pyramids hauing to their bases poligonon figures, are in treble proportion the one to the other, of that in which side of like proportion, is to side of like proportion.
                  
                  For if they be deuided into pyramids hauing triangles to their bases (for like poligonō figures are deuided into like triangles, and equal in multitude, and the sides are of like proportion) as one of the pyramids of the one, hauing a triangle to his base, is to one of the pyramids of the other, hauing also a triangle to his base, so also are all the pyramids of the one pyramis hauing triangles to their bases to all the pyramids of the other pyramis hauing also triangles to their bases. That is, the pyramis hauing to his base a poligonō 
                     
                        •

But a pyramis hauing a triangle to his base, is to a pyramis hauing also a triangle to his base, &amp; being like vnto it, in treble proportiō of that in which side of like proportiō is to side of like proportiō. Wherfore a pyramis hauing to his base a poligonō figure, is to a pyramis hauing also a poligonon figure to his base, the sayd pyramids being like the one to the other, in treble proportion of that in which side of like proportion is to side of like proportion. Likewise Prismes and sided columnes, being set vpon the bases of those pyramids,

               ¶ The 9. Theoreme. The 9. Proposition. In equall pyramids hauing triangles to their bases, the bases are reciprokall to their altitudes. And pyramids hauing triangles to their bases, whose bases are reciprokall to their altitudes, are equall the one to the other.
               SVppose that BCGA and EFHD be equall pyramids, hauing to their bases the triangles BCG and EFH, and the tops the pointes A and D. Then I say that the bases of the two pyramids BCGA and EFHD are reciprokall to their altitudes: that is, as the base BCG is to the base EFH, so is the altitude of the pyramis EFHD to the altitude of the pyramis BCGA. Make perfect the parallelipipedons,

namely, BGML and EHPO. And forasmuch as the pyramis BCGA is equall to the pyramis EFHD,Demonstration of the first part. &amp; the solide BGML is sextuple to the pyramis BCGA. (For the parallelipipedon is duple to the Prisme set vpon the base of the Pyramis, &amp; the Prisme is triple to the pyramis): and likewise the solide EHPO is sextuple to the pyramis EFHD. Wherefore the solide BGML is equal to the solide EHPO. But in equall parallelipipedons, the bases are (by the 34. of the eleuēth) reciprokall

to their altitudes. Wherfore as the base BN is to the base EQ, so is the alti

                  , to the altitude of the solide BGML. But as the base BN is to the base EQ, so is the triangle GBC to the triangle HEF (by the 15. of the 
                     •
                  ifth, for the triangles GBC &amp; HEF are the halues of the parallelogrammes BN and EQ)
                     •
                   Wherfore (by the 11. of the fifth) as the triangle GBC is to the triangle HEF, so is the altitude of the solide EHPO to the altitude of the solide BGML. But the altitude of the solide EHPO is one and the same with the altitude of the pyramis EFHD, and the altitude of the solide BGML is one and the same with the altitude of the pyramis BCGA. Wherefore as the base GBC is to the base HEF, so is the altitude of the pyramis EFHD to the altitude of the pyramis BCGA. Wherefore the bases of the two pyramids BCGA and EFHD are reciprokall to their altitudes.
               But now suppose that the bases of the pyramids BCGA and EFHD, be reciprokall to their altitudes,Demonstration

                     se of the first. that is, as the base GBC is to the base HEF, so let the altitude of the pyramis EFHD be to the altitude of the pyramis BCGA. Then I say that the pyramis BCGA is equall to the pyramis EFHD. For (the selfe same order of construction remaining), for that as the base GBC is to the base 
                     •
                  EF, so is the altitude of the pyramis EFHD to the altitude of the pyramis BCGA. But as the base GBC is to the base HEF, so is the parallelogramme GC to the parallelogramme HF. Wherefore (by the 11. of the fifth) as the parallelogramme GC is to the parallegoramme HF, so is the altitude of the pyramis EFHD to the altitude of the pyramis BCGA. But the altitude of the pyramis EFND and of the solide EHPO, is one and the selfe same, and the altitude of the pyramis BCGA and of the solide BGML, is also one and the same. Wherefore as the base GC is to the base HF, so is the altitude of the solide EHPO to the altitude of the solide BGML. But parallelipipedons, whose bases are reciprokall to their altitudes are (by the 34. of the eleuenth) equall the one to the other. Wherefore the parallelipipedon BGML is equall to the parallelipipedon EHPO. But the pyramis BCGA is the sixth part of the solide BGML, and likewise the pyramis EFHD is the sixth part of the solide EHPO. Wherefore the pyramis BCGA is equall to the pyramis EFHD. Wherefore in equall pyramids hauing triangles to their bases, the bases are reciprokall to their altitudes. And pyramids hauing triangles to their bases, whose bases are reciprocall to their altitudes, are equall the one to the other: which was required to be demonstrated.
               
                  
                  A Corrollary added by Campane and Flussas.
                  
                  
                     Hereby it is manifest that equall pyramids hauing to their bases Poligonon figures, haue their bases reciprokall with their altitudes. And Pyramids whose bases being poligonon figures are reciprokall with their altitudes, are equall the one to the other.
                  
                  Suppose that vpon the poligonon figures A

and B, be set equall pyramids. Then I say that their bases A and B are reciprokall with their altitudes. Describe by the 25. of the sixth, triangles equall to the bases A and B. Which let be C and D. Vpon which let there be set pyramids equall in altitude with the pyramids A and B. Wherfore the pyramids C and D, being set vpō bases equall with the bases of the pyramids A and B, and hauing also their altitudes equall with the altitudes of the sayd pyramids A and B, shall be equall by the 6. of this booke. Wherefore by the first part of this proposition, the bases of the pyramids, C to D are reciprokall with the altitudes of D to C. But in what proportion are the bases C to D, in the same are the bases A to B, forasmuch as they are equall. And in what proportion are the altitudes of D to C, in the same are the altitudes of B to A, which altitudes are likewise equall. Wherefore by the 11. of the fifth, in what proportion the bases A to B are, in the same reciprokally are the altitudes of the pyramids B to A. In like sort by the second part of this proposition may be proued the conuerse of this corollary. The same thing followeth also in a Prisme, and in a sided columne, as hath before at large bene declared in the corollary of the 40. proposition of the 11. booke. For those solides are in proportiō the one to the other, as the pyramids or parallelipipedons, for they are either partes of equemultiplices or equemultiplices to partes.
               
            
            
               The 10. Theoreme. The 10. Proposition. Euery cone is the third part of a cilinder, hauing one and the selfe same base and one and the selfe same altitude with it.
               SVppose that there be a cone hauing to his base the circle ABCD; and let there be a cilinder hauing the selfe same base, and also the same altitude that the cone hath. Then I say that the cone is the third part of the cilinder, that is, that the cilinder is in treble proportion to the cone. For if the cilinder be not in treble proportion to the cone, then the cilinder is either in greater proportions then triple to the cone, or els in lesse. First let it be in greater then triple.Constr

                   And describe (by the 6. of the fourth) in the circle ABCD a  square ABCD. Now the square ABCD,

is greater then the halfe of the circle ABCD. For if about the circle ABCD, we describe a square, the square described in the circle ABCD is the halfe of the square described about the circle. And let there be Parallelipipedon prismes described vpon those squares,Parallelipipedons called Prismes. equall in altitude with the cilinder. But prismes are in that proportion the one to the other, that their bases are (by the 32. of the eleuenth, and 5. Corollary of the 7. of this booke). Wherefore the prisme described vpon the square ABCD is the halfe of the prisme described vpon the square that is described about the circle. Now the clinder is lesse then the

prisme which is made of the square described abou
                     •
                   the circle ABCD, being equal in altitude with it, for it contayneth it. Wherfore the prisme described vpon the square ABCD and being equall in altitude with the cylinder, is greater then half the cylinder. Deuide (by the 30. of the third) the circumferences AB, BC, CD and DA into two equall parts in the points E, F, G, H, And draw these right lines AE, EB, BF, FC, CG, GD, DH &amp; HA. Wherfore euery one of these triangles AEB, BFC, CGD and DHA is greater then halfe of that segment of the circle ABCD which is described about it, as we haue before in the 2. proposition declared. Describe vpon euery one of these triangles AEB, BFC, CGD, and DHA a prisme of equall altitude with the cylinder. Wherefore euery one of these prismes so described is greater then the halfe part of the segment of the cylinder that is set vpon the sayd segments of the circle. For if by the pointes E, F, G, H, be drawen parallell lines to the lines AB, BC, CD and DA, and then be made perfect the parallelogrammes made by those parallell lines, and moreouer vpon those parallelogrāmes be erected parallelipipedons equall in altitude with the cylinder, the prismes which are described vpon eche of the triangles AEB, BFC, CGD, and DHA are the halfes of euery one of those parallelipipedons. And the segments of the cylinder are lesse then those parallelipipedons so described. Wherefore also euery one of the prismes which are described vpon the triangles AEB, BFC, CGD and DHA is greater then the halfe of the segment of the cylinder set vpon the sayd segment. Now therefore deuiding euery one of the circumferences remaining into two equall partes, and drawing right lines, and raysing vp vpon euery one of these triangles prismes equall in altitude with the cylinder, and doing this continually, we shall at the length (by the first of the tenth) leaue certaine segments of the cylinder which shalbe lesse then the excesse whereby the cylinder excedeth the cone more then thrise. Let those segments be AE, EB, BF, FC, CG, GD, DH and HA. Wherfore the prisme remayning, whose base is the poligonon

                  igure AEBFCGDH, and altitude the selfe

same that the cylinder hath, is greater then the cone taken three tymes.By this it is manifest that Euclide comprehended sided Columnes also vnder the name of a Prisme. But the prisme whose base is the poligonon figure AEBFCGDH and altitude the selfe same that the cylinder hath, is treble to the pyramis whose base is the poligonon figure AEBFCGDA and altitude the selfe same that the cone hath, by the corollary of the 3. of this booke. Wherfore also the pyramis whose base is the poligonon figure AEBFCGDH and toppe the self same that the cone hath, is greater then the cone which hath to his base the circle ABCD. But it is also lesse, for it is contayned of it which is impossible. Wherefore the cylinder is not in greater proportion then triple to the cone.
               I say moreouer that the cylinder is not in lesse proportion then triple to the cone
                     •
                   For if it be possible let the cylinder be in lesse proportion then triple to the cone. Wherefore by conuersion, the cone is greater then the third part of the cylinder. Describe now (by the sixth of the fourth) in the circle ABCD a square ABCD. Wherefore the square ABCD is greater then the halfe of the circle ABCD vpon the square ABCD describe a pyramis hauing one &amp; the selfe same altitude with the cone. Wherfore the pyramis so described is greater thē halfe of the cone. (For if as we haue before declared we describe a square about the circle, the square ABCD is the halfe of the square described about the circle, and if vppon the squares be described parallelipipedons equall in altitude with the cone, which solides are also

called prismes, the prisme or parallelipipedon described vpō the square ABCD is the halfe of the prisme which is described vpō the square described about the circle, for they are the one to the other in that proportiō that their bases are (by the 32. of the eleuēth, &amp; 5. corollary of the 7. of this booke.) Wherfore also their third parts are in the self same proportion (by the 15. of the fift). Wherfore the pyramis whose base is the square ABCD is the halfe of the pyramis set vpon the square described about the circle. But the pyramis set vpon the square described about the circle is greater then the cone whome it comprehendeth. Wherfore the pyramis whose base is the square ABCD, and altitude the self same that the cone hath; is greater then the halfe of the cone.) Deuide (by the 30. of the third) euery one of the circumferences AB, BC, CD, and DA into two equall partes in the pointes E, F, G, and H: and drawe these right lines AE, EB, BF, FC, CG, GD, DH, and HA. Wherefore euery one of these triangles AEB, BFC, CGD, and DHA is greater then the halfe part of the segment of the circle described about it. Vppon euery one of these triangles AEB, BFC, CGD, and DHA describe a pyramis of equall altitude with the cone and after the same maner euery one of those pyramids so described is greater then the halfe part of the segment of the cone set vpon the segment of the circle. Now therefore diuiding (by the 30, of the third) the circumferences remaining into two equall parts, &amp; drawing right lines &amp; raysing vp vpon euery one of those triangles a pyramis of equall altitude with the cone, and doing this continually, we shal at the length (by the first of the tenth) leaue certayne segmentes of the cone, which shalbe lesse then the excesse whereby the cone excedeth the third part of the cylinder. Let those segmentes be AE, EB, BF, FC, CG, GD, DH, and HA. Wherefore the pyramis remayning, whose base is the poligonō figure AEBFCGDH and altitude the self same with the cone, is greater then the third part of the cylinder. But the pyramis whose base is the poligonon figure AEBFCGDH and altitude the self same with the cone, is the third part of the prisme whose base is the poligonō figure AEBFCGDH and altitude the self same with the cylinder. Whefore A prisme hauing for his base a poligonon figure as we haue often before noted vnto you. the prisme whose base is the poligonon figure AEBFCGDH, and altitude the self same with the cylinder, is greater then the cylinder whose base is the circle ABCD. But it is also lesse, for it is contayned of it, which is impossible. Wherfore the cylinder is not in lesse proportion to the cone then in treble proportion. And it is proued that it is not in greater proportion to the cone then in treble proportion, wherefore the cone is the third part of the cylinder. Wherfore euery cone is the third part of a cylinder, hauing one &amp; the self same base, and one and the selfe same altitude with it: which was required to be demonstrated.

GH, so is the cone AL to some solide either lesse then the cone EN, or greater.First case. 1. First let it be vnto a lesse, namely, to the solide X. And vnto that which the solide X is lesse then the cone EN, let the solide Y be equall. Wherefore the cone EN is equal to the solides X &amp; Y. Describe (by the 6. of the fourth) in the circle EFGH a square EFGH. Wherefore the square is greater then halfe the circle. Rayse vp vpon the square EFGH a pyramis of equall altitude with the cone. Wherefore the pyramis, so raysed vp is greater then halfe of the cone. For if we describe a square about the circle, and vpon that square rayse vp a pyramis of equall altitude

with the cone, the pyramis which is set vpon the square described with in the circle is the halfe of the pyramis set vpon the square described about the circle, for they are in proportion the one to the other as their bases. But the cone is lesse then the pyramis which is set vpon the square described about the circle. Wherefore the pyramis whose base is the square EFGH and top one and the same with the cone is greater then halfe of the cone: deuide (by the 30. of the third) the circumferences EF, FG, GH and HE into two equal partes in the points O, P, R, S, and draw these right lines HO, OE, EP, PF, FR, RG, GS, and SH.

Now then deuiding (by the 30. of the third) the circumferences remayning into two equall partes, and drawing right lines, and raysing vp vppon euery one of those triangles a pyramis of equall altitude with the cone, and thus doing continually, we shall at length by the first of the tenth leue certayne segmentes of the cone which shall be lesse then the solide Y. Let those segmentes be HOE, EPP, FRG, and GSH. Wherefore the pyramis remayning whose base is the poligonon figure HOEPFRGS &amp; top the selfe same with the cone, is greater then the solide X. Inscribe in the circle ABCD a poligonon figure like and in like sort situate to the poligonon figure HOEPFRGS, and let the same be DTAVBZCW, and vpon it rayse a pyramis of equall altitude with the cone AL. Now for that as the square of the line AC is to the square of the line EG, so is the poligonon figure DTAVBZCW to the poligonon figure HOEPFRGS (by the first of this booke): But as the square of the line AC is to the square of the line EG, so is the circle ABCD to the circle EFGH (by the second of this booke). Wherefore (by the 11. of the fift) as the circle ABCD is to the circle EFGH, so is the poligonon figure DTAVBZCW to the poligonon figure HOEPFRGS (this foloweth also of the corollary of the 2. of this booke): moreouer as the circle ABCD is to the circle EFGH, so is the cone AL to the solide X. And as the poligonon figure DTAVBZCW, is to the poligonon figure HOEPRGS, so is the pyramis whose base is the poligonon figure DTAVBZCW, and toppe the poynt L, to the pyramis whose base is the poligonon figure HOEPRS, and toppe the poynt N. Wherefore (by the 11. of the fift) as the cone AL is to the solide X, so is the pyramis whose base is the poligonō figure DTAVBZCW, and toppe the poynt L, to the pyramis whose base is the poligonon figure HEOPFRGS, and toppe the poynt N. Wherefore alternately (by the 16. of the fift) as the cone AL is to the pyramis which is in it, so is the solide X, to the pyramis which is in the cone EN. But the cone AL, is greater then the pyramis which is in it. Wherefore also the solide X is greater then the pyramis which is in the cone EN. But it is also lesse by construction. Which is impossible. Wherfore as the circle ABGD, is to the circle EFGH, so is not the cone AL to any solide lesse then the cone EN.Second case.

Now I say that as the circle ABCD, is to the circle EFGH, so is not the cone AL to any solide greater then the cone EN. For if it be possible let it be vnto a greater, namely to the solide X. Wherefore by conuersion, as the circle EFGH, is to the circle ABCD, so is the solide X to the cone AL: but as the solide X is to the cone AL, so is the cone EN, to some solide lesse then the cone AL (as we may see by the assumpt put after th

Wherefore as the circle ABCD, is to the circle EFGH, so is the cone AL to the cone EN.

For if the cone ABCDL be not to the cone EFGHN in treble proportion of that in which the diameter

Diuide now (by the 30. of the third) the circumferences EF, FG, GH, &amp; HE, into two equall partes in the pointes O, P, R, S, and drawe these right lines EO, OF, FP, PG, GR, RH, HS, and SE. Wherefore euery one of these

And let one of the triangles comprehending the pyramis, whose base is the Poligonon figure ATBVCZDW, and toppe the point L, be LBT, and let also one of the triangles comprehending the pyramis, whose base is the Poligonon

And forasmuch as the cone ABCDL is like to the cone EFGHN, therefore (by the 20. definition of the eleuenth) as the diameter BD is to the diameter FH, so is the axe KL to the axe MN: But as the diameter BD is to the diameter FH, so (by the 15. of the 
                     •
                  ift) is the semidiameter BK to the semidiameter FM. Wherefore (by the 11. of the fift) as BK is to FM, so is KL to MN. Wherefore alternately also (by the 16. of the fift) as BK is to KL, so is FM to MN. Wherefore the sides about the equall angles BKL and FMN (which angles are equall, for that they are right angles (by the 18. definition of the eleuenth) are proportionall. Wherefore (by the 1. definition of the sixt) the triangle BKL is like to the triangle FMN. Againe for that as BK is to KT, so is FM to MO, and they comprehend equall angles, namely, BKT and FMO, for what part the angle BKT is of those fower right angles which are made at the centre K, the selfe same part is the angle FMO of the fower right angles which are made at the centre M: forasmuch therefore as the sides about the equall angles are proportionall, the triangle BKT is like to the triangle FMO. Againe, forasmuch as it was proued, that as BK is to KL, so is FM to NM, but BK is equall to KT, and FM to MO, therefore as TK is to KL, so is OM to MN. Wherfore the sides about the equall angles TKL and OMN (which angles are equall, for that they are right angles) are proportionall. Wherefore the triangle LKT is like to the triangle MNO. And for that (by the 6. of the sixt) and by reason of the likenes of the triangles LKB and NMF, as LB is to BK, so is NF to FM, and againe by reason of the likenes of the triangles BKT and FMO, as KB is to BT, so is MF to FO, therefore of equalitie (by the 22. of the fift) as LB is to BT, so is NF to FO. Againe for that by reason of the likenes of the triangles LKT and NOM, as LT is to TK, so is NO to OM, and by reason of the likenes of the triangles TKB &amp; OMF, as KT is to TB, so is MO to OF: therfore of equalitie (by the 22. of the fift) as LT is to TB, so is NO to OF. And it was proued that as TB is to BL, so is OF to FN. Wherefore againe of equalitie, as TL is to LB, so is ON to NF.Wherefore the sides of the triangles LTB &amp; NOF, are proportionall. Wherfore (by the 5. of the sixt) the triangles LTB and NOF, are equiangle. Wherefore also they are like. Wherefore the pyramis, whose base is the triangle BKT, and toppe the point L, is like vnto the pyramis, whose base is the triangle FMO, and toppe the point N. For they are comprehended vnder like plaine superficieces, and equall in multitude. But pyramids being like, and hauing triangles to their bases, are (by the 8. of the twelfth) in treble proportion the one to the other of that in which sides of like proportion are. Wherefore the pyramis

BKTL is to the pyramis FMON, in treble proportion of that in which the line BK is to the line FM. And in like sort if we draw right lines from the pointes A, W, D, Z, C, and V, to the point K, and likewise from the pointes E, S, H, R, G, and P, to the point M, and raise vp vpon the triangles pyramids, hauing the selfe same altitudes with the cones, we may proue that euery one of those pyramids of one &amp; the selfe same order, is to euery one of the pyramids of the selfe same order, in treble proportion of that in which the side of like proportion BK is to side of like proportion FM, that is, of that which the line BD hath to the line FH. But as one of the antecedentes is to one of the consequentes, so are all the antecedentes to all the consequētes (by the 12. of the fift). Wherfore as the pyramids BKTL is to the pyramis FMON, so is the whole pyramis, whose base is the Poligonon figure ATBVCZDW, and toppe the point L, to the whole pyramis, whose base is the Poligonon figure EOFPGRHS, and toppe the point N. Wherefore the pyramis, whose base is the Poligonon figure ATBVCZDW, and toppe the point L, is to the pyramis, whose base is the Poligonon figure EOFPGRHS, and toppe the point N, in treble proportion of that in which the line BD is to the line FH.

And it is supposed also that the cone, whose base is the circle ABCD, and toppe the point L, is to the solide X, in treble proportion of that in which the line BD is to the line FH. Wherefore as the cone, whose base is the circle ABCD, and toppe the point L, is to the solide X, so is the pyramis, whose base is the Poligonon 
                     •
                  igure ATBVCZDW, &amp; toppe the point L, to the pyramis, whose base is the Poligonon figure EOFPGRHS, and toppe the point N. Wherefore alternately (by the 16. of the fift) as the cone, whose base is the circle ABCD, &amp; toppe the point L, is to the pyramis which is in it, whose base is the Poligonō figure ATBVCZDW, &amp; toppe the point L, so is the solide X, to the pyramis, whose base is the Poligonon figure EOFPGRHS, and toppe the point N. But the foresaid cone is greater then the pyramis which is in it, for it containeth it. Wherefore the solide X is greater then the pyramis, whose base is the Poligonon figure EOFPGRHS, and toppe the point N. But it was supposed to be lesse: which is impossible. Wherfore the cone ABCDL is not to any solide lesse then the cone EFGHN, in treble proportion of that in which the

diameter BD is to the diameter FH. In like sort also may we proue, that the cone EFGHN is not to any solide lesse then the cone ABCDL, in treble proportion of that in which FH is to BD.
               Now also I say, that the cone ABCDL is not to any solide greater then the cone EFGHN,Second case. in treble proportion of that in which the diameter BD is to the diameter FH. For if it be possible, let it be to a greater, namely, to the solide X. Wherefore by conuersion (by the Corollary of the 4. of the fift) the solide X is to the cone ABCDL, in treble proportion of that in which the diameter FH is to the diameter BD. But as the solide X is to the cone ABCDL, so is the cone EFGHN to some solide lesse then the cone ABCDL (as it is easie to see by the Assumpt put after the 2. Proposition). Wherefore also the cone EFGHN is vnto some solide lesse then the cone ABCDL, in treble proportion of that in which the diameter FH is to the diameter BD: which is proued to be impossible. Wherefore the cone ABCDL is not to any solide greater then the cone EFGHN in treble proportion of that in which the diameter BD is to the diameter FH, and it is also proued that it is not to any lesse. Wherefore the cone ABCD is to the cone EFGHN in treble proportion of that in which the diameter BD is to the diameter FH.
               But as cone is to cone, so is cylinder to cylinder (by the 15. of the fift) for the cylinder is triple to the cone which is described on the one and selfe same base,Second par

For it is proued (by the 10. of the twelfth) that euery cone is the third part of a cylinder, hauing one and the selfe same base with it, and one &amp; the selfe same altitude. Wherefore the cylinder is vnto the cylinder in treble proportion of that in which the diameter BD is to the diameter FH. Wherfore like cones &amp; cylinders are in treble proportion of that in which the diameters of their bases are: which was required to be proued.
            
            
               The 13. Theoreme. The 13. Proposition. If a Cylinder be diuided by a playne superficies being a parallell to the two opposite playne superficieces: then as the one Cylinder is to the other Cylinder, so is the axe of the one to the axe of the other.

be EF, and let the opposite bases be the circles AEB, and CFD, and let AD be diuided by the superfices GH being a parallell to the two opposite playne superficieces, AB, and CD.

equall the one to the other: Therefore the cylinders PR, RB, and BG are (by the 11. of the twelueth) in proportion the one to the other as their bases are. But the bases are equall. Wherefore also the cylinders PR, RB, and BG are equall the one to the other. And forasmuch as the axes LN, NE, and EK are equal the one to the other, and the cylinders PR, RB, and BG are also equall the one to the other, and the multitude of the axes LN, NE, and EK is equall to the multitude of the cylinders PR, RB, and BC: therefore how multiplex the whole axe KL is to the axe EK, so multiplex is the whole cylinder PG to the cylinder BG. And (by the same reason) also how multiplex the whole axe MK is the axe KF, so multiplex is the whole cylinder WG to the cylinder GD. Wherfore if the axe KL be equal the axe KM, the cylinder PG is equall to cilinder GW. And if the axe KL be greater th
                     •
                  n the axe KM, the cylinder PG is greater then the cylinder GW. And if it be lesse it is lesse. Now therefore there are foure magnitudes, namely, the two axes EK, and KF, and the two cylinders BG, and GD, and vnto the axe EK, and to the cylinder BG, namely, to the first and the third are taken equemultiplices, namely, the axe KL, and the cylinder PG. And likewise vnto the axe GF, and vnto the cylinder GD, namely, the second and the fourth, are taken other equemultiplices, namely, the axe KM, and the cylinder GW. And it is proued that if the axe KL, excede the axe KM, the cylinder PG excedeth the cylinder GW and that if it be equall it is equall, and if it be lesse it is lesse. Wherfore (by the 6. definition of the fift) as the axe EK is to the axe KF, so is the cylinder BG to the cylinder GD. If therfore a cylinder be diuided by a plaine superficies being a parallel to the two opposite plaine superficieces: then as the one cylinder is to the other cilinder, so is the axe of the one to the axe of the other: which was required to be proued.

                  Forasmuch as in the tenth of this booke it was sayd, that euery Cone is the third part of a cilinder hauing one, and the selfe same base, &amp; one &amp; the selfe same altitude with it, which thing was demōstrated by a cilinder geuen, whose base is cut by a square inscribed in it, and vpon the sides of the square are described Isosceles triangles, making a poligonon figure, and againe vpon the sides of this poligonon figure are infinitely after the same maner described other Isosceles triangles taking away more thē the halfe, as hath oftētimes bene declared: therfore it is manifest, that the solides set vpon these bases, being

vnder the same altitude that the cilinder inclined is, and being also included in the same cilinder, do take away more then the halfe of the cilinder, and also more thē the halfe of the residue, as it hath bene proued in erected cylinders. For these inclined solides being vnder equall altitudes and vpon equall bases with the erected solides are equall to the erected solides by the corollary of the 
                        •
                     0. of the eleuenth. Wherfore they also in like sort as the erected, take away more then the halfe. If therfore we cōpare the inclined cilinder, to a cone set vpon the selfe same base, and hauing his altitude erected, and reason by an argument leading to an impossibilitie by the demonstration of the tenth of this booke, we may proue that the sided solide included in the inclined cylinder is greater then the triple of his pyramis, and it is also equall to the same which is impossible. And this is the first case, wherein it was proued that the cilinder not being equall to the triple of the cone is not greater then the triple of the same. And as touching the second case, we may after the same maner conclude that that 
                        •
                     ided solide contayned in the cylin

                     er is greater then the cylinder: which is very absurd
                        •
                      Wherefore if the cylinder be neither greater then the triple of the cone, nor lesse, it must nedes be equall to the same. The demonstration of these inclined cylinders most playnely followeth the demonstration of the erected cylinders: for it hath already bene proued, that pyramids, and sided solides (which are also called generally Prismes) being set vpon equall bases and vnder one and the selfe same altitude, whether the altitude be erected or inclined, are equall the one to the other, namely, are in proportion as their bases are by the 
                        •
                     . of this booke. Wherefore a cylinder inclined shall be triple to euery cone (although also the cone be erected) set vpon one and the same base with it, and being vnder the same altitude. But the cilinder erected was the triple of the same cone by the tenth of this booke. Wherefore the cilinder inclined is equall to the cilinder erected being both set vpon one and the selfe same base, and hauing one and the selfe same altitude. The same also cometh to passe in cones, which are the third partes of equall cilinders, &amp; therefore are equall the one to the other.
                  Wherefore according to the eleuenth of this booke it followeth, that cylinders and cones inclined or erected, being vnder one and the selfe same altitude, are in proportion the one to the other as their bases are. For forasmuch as the erected are in proportion as their bases are, and to the erected cilinders the inclined are equall: therefore they also shall be in proportion as their bases are.
                  And therefore by the 12. of this booke like cones and cylinders being inclined are in triple proportion of that in which the diameters of the bases are. For forasmuch as they are equall to the erected which haue the proportion by the 12. of this booke, and their bases also are equall with the bases of the erected, therefore they also shall haue the same proportion.

                     If a Sphere be cut of a playne superficies, the common section of the superficieces, shall be the circumference of a circle.

perpendicularly to the playne superficies).

And by the same reason may we proue, that all the right lines drawne from the poynt E to the line which is the cōmon section of the superficies of sphere and of the playne superficies, are equall. Wherefore that line shall be the circumference of a circle, by the 15. definition of the first.

                     By the foresayd assumpt it is manifest, that if from the centre of a sphere the lines drawne perpendicularly vnto the circles which cutte the sphere, be equall: those circles are equall. And the perpendicular lines so drawne fall vpon the centres of the same circles.
                  
                  For the line which is drawne frō the centre of the sphere to the circumference, containeth in power, the power of the perpendicular line, and the power of the line which ioyneth together the endes of those lines.

                     ound about, it followeth, that the residues how many so euer they be, be equall powers, and therefore the lines are equall the one to the other. Wherefore they will describe equall circles, by the first definition of the third. And vpon their centers fall the perpendicular lines by the 9. of the third.
                  
                     
                        An other Corollary.
                     And those circles vpon which falleth the greater perpendicular lines are the lesse circles. For the powers of the lines drawne from the centre of the sphere to the circumference being alwayes one and equall, to the powers of the perpendicular lines and also to the powers of the lines drawne from the centres of the circles to their circumference, the greater that the powers of the perpendicular lines taken away from the power contayning them both are, the lesse are the powers and therefore the lines remayning, which are the semidiameters of the circles and therefore the lesse are the circles which they describe. Wherefore if the circles be equall, the perpendicular lines falling from the centre of the sphere vpon thē, shall also be equall. For if they should be greater or lesse, the circles should be vnequall as it is before manifest. But we suppose the perpendiculars to be equall.
                        An other Corollary.
                      Also the perpendicular lines falling vpon those bases are the least of all, that are drawne from the centre of the sphere: for the other drawne

from the centre of the sphere to the circumference of the circles, are in power equall both to the powers of the perpendiculars and to the powers of the lines ioyning these perpendiculars and these subtendent lines together: making triangles rectangleround about: as most easily you may conceaue of the figure here annexed.

Wherefore (by the 26. of the first) the other sides &amp; angles are equall, namely, the line OZ to the lines SW, and the line BZ to the line KW,]
But the whole line BA is equall to the whole line KA: by the definition

of a circle Wherfore the residue ZA is equall to the residue WA. Wherfore the line ZW is a parallel to the line BK (by the 2. of the sixt). And forasmuch as either of these lines OZ, &amp; SW is erected perpendicularly to the playne superficies of the circle BCDE, therefore the line OZ is a parallell to the line SW, (by the 6. of the eleuēth) and it is proued that it is also equal vnto it. Wherfore the lines WZ and SO are also equall and parallels (by the 7, of the eleuenth, and the 33. of the first, and by the 3. of the first) And forasmuch as WZ is a parallell to SO: But ZW is a parallell is to KB: Wherefore SO is also a parallell to KB, (by the 9. of the eleuenth). And the lines BO, and KS do knit them together. Wherefore the fower sided figure BOKS is in one and the selfe same playne superficies.

For (by the 7. of the eleuenth) if there be any two parallell right lines, and if in either of them be taken a point at allauentures, a right line drawn by these points is in one, &amp; the selfe same playne superficies with the parallels: And by the same reason also euery one of the fower sided figures SOPT, and TPKV is in one and th

Now I say that the forsayd polihedron solide of many sides toucheth not the superficies of the lesse sphere in which is the circle FGH:Second part of the construction. Draw (by the 11. of the eleuenth) frō the poynt A to the playne superficies of the fower sided figure KBOS a perpendicular line AY, and let it fall vpon the playne superficies in the point Y. And drawe these right lines BY &amp; YK. And forasmuch as the line AY is erected perpendicularly to the playne superficies of BKOS,

therefore the same AY is erected perpendicularly to all the right lines that touch it, and are in the plaine superficies of the fower sided figure (by the 
                     •
                  . definition of the eleuenth).Second part of the demonstration. Wherefore the line AY is erected perpendicularly to either of these lines BY, and YK. And forasmuch as (by the 15. definition of the first) the line A
                     •
                   is equall to the line AK, therfore the square of the line AB is equall to the square of the line AK. And to the square of the line A
                     •
                   are equall the squares of the lines AY, and YB (by the 47. of the first) for the angle 
                     •
                  .

YA is a right angle. And to the square of the line AK are equal the squares of the lines AY and YK. Wherefore the squares of the lines AY, and YB are equal to the squares of the lines AY, and TK: take away the square of the line AY which is common to them both. Wherefore the residue, namely, the square of the BY is equall to the residue, namely, to the square of the line YK. Wherefore the line BY is equall to the line YK. In like sort also may we proue that right lines drawne from the point Y to the pointes O, and S, are equall to either of the lines BY, and YK. Wherefore making the center the poynt Y, and the space either the line BY or the line YK describe a circle, and it shal passe by the poyntes O, and S, and the fower sided figure KBOS shalbe inscribed in the circle. And forasmuch as the line KB is greater then the line WZ (by the 2. of the sixt, because AK is greater then AW), but the line WZ is equall to the line SO. Wherfore the line BK is greater thē the line SO. But the line BK is equal to either

of the lines KS, and BO by construction. Wherefore either of the lines KS, and 
                     •
                  O is greater th
                     •

                  s in the circle is a fower sided figure KBOS, and the sides BK, BO and KS are equal, and the side OS is lesse then any one of them, and the line BY is drawne from the centre of the circle: therefore the square of the line KB is greater then the double of the square of the line BY (by the 12. of the second)

                     •
                   right angles: of which three, namely, the angles BYK, KYS, and BYO are equall by the 4. of the first, and the fourth namely, ye angle SYO is lesse then any of those three angles, by the 25. of the first.) Drawe (by the 12. of the first) from the point K to the line BZ, a perpendicular line Which of necessity shall fall vpon Z, as M. Dee proueth it: and his profe is set after at this marke ✚ following. KZ. And forasmuch as the line BD is lesse then the double to the line DZ (for the line BD is double to the line DA, which is lesse then the line DZ): but as the line BD is to the line DZ, so is the parallelogramme contained vnder the lines DB and BZ, to the parallelogramme contained vnder the lines DZ and ZB

(by the 1. of the sixt): therefore if ye describe vpon the line BZ a square, and making perfecte the parallelogramme contained vnder the lines ZD, and ZB, that which is contained vnder the lines DB &amp; BZ, shall be lesse then the double to that which is contained vnder the lines DZ and ZB. And if ye drawe a right line from the point K to the point D, that which is contained vnder the lines DB and BZ, equall to the square of the line BK (by the Corollary of the 8. of the sixt) for the angle BKD is a right angle, by the 3
                     •
                  . of the third, for it is in the semicircle BED): and that which is contained vnder the lines DZ and ZB, is equall to the square of the line KZ (by the same Corollary). Wherefore the square of the line KB, is lesse then the double to the square of the line KZ. But the square of the line KB is greater then the double to the square of the line BY, as before hath bene proued. Wherfore the square of the line KZ, is greater then the square of the line BY (by the 10. of the fift). And forasmuch as (by the 15. definition of the first) the line BA is equall to the line KA: therefore also the square of the line BA is equall to the square of the line KA. But (by the 47. of the first) vnto the square of the line AB, are equall the squares of the lines BY &amp; YA: (for the angle BYA is by construction, a right angle). And (by the same reason) to the square of the line KA, are equall the squares of the lines KZ and ZA: (for the angle KZA is also by construction, a right angle). Wherefore the squares of the lines BY and YA, are equall to the squares of the lines KZ and

                   Of which the square of the line KZ is greater then the square of the line BY, as hath before bene proued. Wherefore the residue, namely,I. Dee. the square of the line ZA, is lesse then the square of the line YA. Wherfore the line YA is greater then the line AZ. But AZ is greater thē AG, as in the former propositiō, KM was euident to be greater then KG: so may it also be made manifest that KZ doth neyther touch nor cut the circle FG
                        •
                     H. Wherefore the line AY is much greater the
                     •
                   the line AG. But the line AY falleth vpon one of the bases of the Polihedron, and the line AG falleth vpon the superficies of the lesse sphere. Wherefore the Polihedron toucheth not the superficies of the lesse sphere.
               An other and more ready demonstration to proue that the line AY is greater then the line AG.An other proue that the line AY is greater thē the line AG. Raise vp (by the 11. of the first) from the poynt G to the line AG a perpendicular line GL. And draw a right line frō the point A to the poynt L. Now thē deuiding (by the 30. of the third) the circumference E

                   into halues, &amp; agayne that halfe into halues, &amp; thus doing continually, we shall at the length by the corollary of the first of the tenth, leaue a certayne circumference, which shal be lesse then the circumference of the circle BCD which is subtended of a line equall to the line GL. Let the circumference left be KB. Wherfore also the right line KB is lesse then the right line GL. And forasmuch as the fower sided figure BKOS is

in a circle, and the lines OB, BK, and KS are equall, and the line OS is lesse, therefore the angle BYK is an obtuse angle. Wherefore the line BK is greater then the line BY. But the line GL is greater then the line KB. Wherefore the line GL is much greater then the line BY. Wherefore also the square of the line GL is greater then square of the line BY. And forasmuch as (by the 15. definition of the first) the line AL is equall to the line AB, therefore the square of the line AL is equall to the square of the line AB. But vnto the square of the line AL are equall the squares of the lines AG and GL, and to the square of the line AB are equall the squares of the lines BY and YA. Wherefore the squares of the lines AG and GL are equall to the squares of the lines BY and YA, of which the square of the line BY is lesse then the square of the line GL. Wherefore the residue, namely, the square of the line YA is greater thē the square of the line AG. Wherfore also the line AY is greater thē the line AG. Wherfore two spheres consisting both about one and the selfe same center, being geuen, there is inscribed in the greater sphere a polihedron or solide of many sides which toucheth not the superficies of the lesse sphere

                  And if in the other sphere, namely, in the lesse sphere be inscribed a Polihedron or solide of many sides like to the polihedron inscribed in the sphere BCDE, then the polihedron inscribed in the sphere BCDE is to the polihedron inscribed in the other sphere in treble proportion of that in which the diameter of the sphere BCDE is to the diameter of the other sphere. For those solides being deuided into pyramids equall in number and equall in order, the pyramids shall be like. But like pyramids are (by the 8. of the twelfth) the one to the other in treble proportion of that in which side of like proportion is to side of like proportion. Wherfore the pyramis whose base is the fower sided figure KBOS and toppe the poynt A is to that py

                     amis which is of like order in the other sphere, in treble proportion of that in which side of like proportiō is to side of like proportiō, that is of that in which the side AB which is drawne frō the cēter of the sphere which is about the cēter A, is to the side which is drawn frō the cēter of the other sphere. And in like sort also euery one of ye pyramids which is in ye sphere which is about the cētre A is to euery one of the pyramids of the selfe same order in the other sphere in treble proportiō of that in which the side AB is to the side which is drawne from the center of the other sphere.

                     es, so are all the antecedents to all the consequentes by the 12. of the fifth. Wherefore the whole polihedron solide of many sides which is in the sphere which is about the center A, is to the whole polihedron or solide of many sides which is in the other sphere, in treble proportion of that in which the side AB is to the side which is drawne from the center of the other sphere, that is, of that which the diameter BD is to the diameter of the other sphere, by the 15. of the fifth: which was required to be demonstrated.

                     BY the premisses, it is manifest, that the point Z is that point where a right line from the point O being perpendicularly let

Which point Z also is proued to be in the right line BAD, the common section of two circles cutting eche other: being one to the other perpendicularly erected. These thinges, with other, before demonstrated, I here make my suppositions. Consider now the two triangles rectangles OZB and KZB:
Of which, the angle OZB i

                            equall to the angle KZB. For, by construction, they are both right angles:

For, if from D to K you imagine a right line: and the like from D to O: you haue two triangles in equall semicircles, rectangles, namely, DKB and DOB: which haue the diameter BD common: and BK, the Chord, equall to BO the Chord, by construction. Wherefore (by the 47. of the

Wherefore the two triangles rectangles OZB and KZB, are proued equiangled. By the fourth, therefore, of the sixt, their sides are proportionall: therefore by the premisses, proued, as BO is to BK, so is OZ to KZ, and the third line, which subtendeth the angle ZOB, to the third line which subtendeth the angle ZKB.

                     Hereby it is manifest, that two equall circles cutting one the other by the whole diameter, if from one and the same end of their common diameter, equall portions of their circumferences be taken: and from the pointes ending those equall portions, two perpendiculars be let downe to their common diameter, those perpendiculars shall fall vpon one and the same point of their common diameter.

               ¶ The 16. Theoreme. The 18. Proposition. Spheres are in treble proportion the one to the other of that in which their diameters are.
               
                  SVppose that there be two spheres ABC and DEF, and let their diameters be BC and EF. Then I say that the sphere ABC is to the sphere DEF in treble proportion of that in which the diameter BC is to the diameter EF.Two cases in this proposition. For if not, then the sphere ABC is in treble proportion of that in which BC is to EF, either to some sphere lesse then the sphere DEF, or to some sphere greater. First let it be vnto a lesse, namely, to GHK.The first case. And imagine that the spheres DEF and GHK be both about one and the selfe same centre.Demonstration leading to an impossibilitie. And (by the proposition next going before) describe in the greater sphere DEF a polihedron or a solide of many sides not touching the superficies of the lesse sphere GHK. And suppose also that in the sphere ABC be inscribed a polihedron like to the polihedron which is in the sphere DEF. Wherefore (by the corollary of the same) the polihedron which is in the sphere ABC, is to the polihedron which is in the sphere DEF in treble proportion of that in which the diameter BC is to the diameter EF. But by supposition the sphere ABC is to the sphere GHK in treble proportion of that in which the diameter BC is to the diameter EF. Wherefore as the sphere ABC is to the sphere GHK, so is the polihedrō which is described in the sphere ABC to the polihedrō which is described in the sphere DEF by the 11. of the fift. Wherfore alternately (by the 16. of the fift) as the sphere ABC is to the polihedron which is described in it, so is the sphere GHK to the polihedron which is in

the sphere DEF. But the sphere ABC is greater then the polihedrō which is described in it. Wherfore also the sphere GHK is greater then the polihedrō which is in the sphere DEF by the 14. of the fift. But it is also lesse, for it is contayned in it, which impossible. Wherefore the sphere ABC is not in treble proportiō of that in which the diameter BC, is to ye diameter EF, to any sphere lesse then the sphere DEF. In like sort also may we proue that the sphere DEF is not in treble proportion of that in which the diameter EF is to the diameter BC, to any sphere lesse then the sphere ABC.Second case. Now I say that the sphere ABC is not in treble proportiō of that in which the diameter BC is to the diameter EF to any sphere greater thē the sphere DEF. For if it be possible, let it be to a greater, namely, to LMN. Wherfore by conuersion the sphere LMN is to the sphere ABC in treble proportion of that in which the diameter EF is to the diameter BC. But as the sphere LMN is to the sphere ABC, so is the sphere DEF to some sphere lesse thē the sphere ABC,As it is

which the diameter EF is to the diameter BC to some sphere lesse thē the sphere ABC, which is proued to be impossible. Wherefore the sphere ABC is not in treble proportion of that in which BE is to EF to any sphere greater thē the sphere DEF. And it is also proued that it is not to any lesse. Wherefore the sphere ABC is to the sphere DEF in treble proportion of that in which the diameter BC is to the diameter EF: which was required to be demonstrated.

square of NP, so is the circle EKG to the circle NRP, by the 2. of this twelueth. Wherefore the circl

                           . Wherefore the cone whose base is EKG and height FL, is equall to the Sphere A: by the 7. of the fift. To a Sphere being geuen therefore, we haue made an vpright cone equall.
                        And as concerning the other part of this Probleme,
                              The second part of the Probleme two wayes executed.
                            it is now easie to execute, and that two wayes: I meane to A the sphere geuen, to make an vpright cone in any proportion geuen betwen two right lines. For, let the proportion geuen, be that which is betwene X and Y. By the order  of my additions, vpon the 2. of this twelfth booke: to the circle EKG make an other circle in that proportion that X is to Y: which let be Z. Vpon the center of Z, reare a line perpendicular and equall to FL. I say that the cone, whose base is Z, and the height equall to FL, is to A, in the proportion of X to Y. For the cone vppon Z, by construction, hath height equall to the height of the cone LEKG: and Z, by construction, is to EKG
                                 •
                              
                            as X is to Y: Wherefore, by the 11. of this twelfth, the cone vpon Z, is to the cone LEKG, as X is to Y. But the cone LEKG is proued equall to the sphere A. Wherfore the cone vpon Z, is to A, as X is to Y, by the 7. of the fift. To a Sphere geuen therefore, we haue made a cone in any proportion geuen, betwene two right lines. Secondly, as X is to Y, so to FL, let there be a fourth  line, by the 12. of the sixt: and suppose it to be W. I say that a cone, whose base is equall to EKG, and height the line W, is to A, as X is to Y. For, by the 14. of this twelfth, cones being set on equall bases, are one to the other, as their heightes are: But, by construction, the height W, is to the height FL, a
                              •
                            
                           X is to Y. Wherefore the cone which hath his base equall to EKG, and height the line W, is to the cone LEKG, as X is to Y. And it is proued, that to the cone LEKG, the Sphere A is equall: Wherfore, by the 7. of the fift, the cone, whose base is equall to EKG, and height the line W, is to A, as X is to Y. Therefore a Sphere being geuen, we haue made an vpright cone,
                              An vpright Cone.
                            in any proportion geuen betwene two right lines. And before, we made an vpright cone, equall to the Sphere geuen. Wherfore a Sphere being geuen, we haue made an vpright cone, equall to the same, or in any other proportion, geuen betwene two right lines. I call that an vpright cone, whose axe is perpendicular to his base.

                     Of the first part of the demonstration, it is euident: A Sphere being propounded, that a Cone, whose base hath his semidiameter, equall to the diameter therof, and height equall to the semidiameter of the same Sphere, is equall to that sphere propounded.

                     Suppose, a sphere to be signified by A, and an vpright cylinder hauing to his base a circle equall to the greatest circle in A contayned, and his heith equall to the diameter of A, let be signified by FG. I say that FG, is sesquialter to A: Secondly I say that the croked cylindricall super

Thirdly I say that the cylindricall superficies of FG, omitting his two opposite bases, is equall to the superficies of the spere A. Let the base of FG, be the circle FLB: whose center, sup

Forasmuch as, by supposition MH is equall to the diameter of A. Let MH be deuided into two equall partes in the point N, by a playne superficies passing by the point N, and being parallell to the opposit bases of FG. By the thirtenth of this twelfth booke, it then foloweth, that the cylinder FG, is also deuided into two equall parts: being cylinders: which two equall cylinders let be IG, and FK: the axe of IG suppose to be HN: and of FK the axe to be NM. And for that, FG, is

an vpright cylinder, and at the poynt N, cut by a playne Superficies parallell to his opposite bases, the common section of that playne superficies and the cylind

Which circle, let be IOK: And seing that FLB is, by supposition, equall to the greatest circle in A, IOK, also, shall be equall to the greatest circle, in A, contained: Also, by reason MH, is by supposition, equal to the diameter of A: and NH, by constructiō, half of MH, it is manifest that NH is equall to the semidiameter of A. If, therefore, you suppose a cone to haue the circle IOK to hi

                         base: and NH to his heith, the sphere A, shall be to that Cone, quadrupla, by the 2. Theoreme. Let that cone be HIOK. Wherefore A, is quadrupla to HIOK. And the Cylinder IG hauing the same base, with HIOK (the circle IOK) and the same heith, (the right line NH) is triple to the cone HIOK by the 10. of this twelfth booke. But to IG, the whole cylinder FG, is double, as is proued: Wherefore FG, is triple and triple, to the cone HIOK, that is, sextuple. And A is proued quadrupla to the same HIOK. Wherefore FG is to HIOK, as 6. to 1: and A, is to HIOK, as 4. to 1:

Wherefore the cylinder FG, is to A sesquialtera in proportion. Secondly, forasmuch as the superficies of a cylinder (his two opposite bases excepted) is equall to that circle whose semidiameter is middell proportionall betwene the side of the cylinder, and the diameter of his base: (as vnto the 10. of this booke, I haue added.) But of FG, the side BG, being parallell and equall to the axe MH, must also be equall to the diameter of A. And the base FLB, being (by supposition) equall to the greatest circle in A contained, must haue his diameter (FB) equal to the sayd diameter of A.

Wherfore the superficies cylindricall of FG, alone, is quadrupla to his base FLB. But if a certayne quantity be dupla to one thing, and an other, quadrupla to the same one thing, those two quantities together are sextupla to the same one thing. Therefore seing the base, opposite to FLB, (being equall to to FLB)

                        icies of FG, doth make a superficies sextupla to FLB. And the superficies of A, is quadrupla to the same FLB, by the first Theoreme. Therefore the cylindricall superficies of FG, with the superficieces of his two bases is to the superficies FLB, as 6 to 1, and the superficies of A to FLB, is as 4 to 1. Wherfore the cylindricall superficies of FG, &amp; his two bases, together, are to the superficies of A, as 6 to 4: that is, in the smallest termes, as 3 to 2. Which is proper to ses

And also it is proued, that the superficies of the sphere A, is quadrupla to the same FLB, Wherefore by the 7. of the fifth, the cylindricall superficies of FG, is equall to the superficies of A. Therfore, euery cylinder, which hath his base the greatest circle in a sphere, and heith equal to the diameter of that sphere, is sesquialtera to that spere: Also the superficies of that cylinder with his two bases, is sesquialtera, to the superficies of the sphere: and without his two bases is equall to the superficies of the sphere: which was to be demonstrated.

                     For, seing, B is to C, as 4 to 1, by supposition: therefore backward, by the 4. of the fifth, C is to B, as 1, to 4. Imagine now two orders of qnantities, the first,

A, C, and B the second, 6, 1, and 4. Forasmuch as, A, is to C, as 6, to 1, by supposition: and C is to B, as 1, to 4, as we haue proued: wherfore, A is to B, as 6 to 4, by the 22 of the fift.

                            of which, let QE containe two, and let the third part be CE. By the point E suppose a plaine (parallel to the bases of BC) to passe through the cylinder BC, cutting the same by the circle DE. I say that the cylinder BE is equall to the Sphere A. For seing BC, being an vpright cylinder, is cu

                            by a plaine, parallel to his bases, by construction: therefore as the cylinder DC, is to the cylinder BE, so is the axe of DC, to the axe of BE, by the 13. of this twelfth.
                              Demonstration.
                            Wherefore as the axe is to the axe, so is cylinder to cylinder. But axe is to axe, as side to side, namely, CE to QE, because the axe is parallel to any side

of an vpright cylinder: by the definition of a cylinder.

And the circle of the section, is parallel to the bases, by construction. Wherefore in the parallelogramme (made of the axe, and of two semidiameters, on one side parallels, one to the other, being coupled together by a line drawen betwene their endes in their circumferences, which line is the side QC) it is euident, that the axe of BC is cut in like proportion, that the side QC is cut. Wherfore the cylinder DC, is to the cylinder BE, as EC is to QE. Wherefore, by composition, the cylinders DC and BE, that is, whole BC, are to the cylinder BE, as CE and QE (the whole right line QC) are to QE. But by cōstruction, QC is of 3. such partes, as QE containeth 2. Wherefore the cylinder BC, is of 3. such partes, as BE contayneth 2. Wherefore BC the cylinder, is to BE, as 3. to 2: which is sesquialtera proportion. But by the former Theoreme, BC is sesquialtera to the Sphere A: Wherefore, by the 7. of the fift, BE is equall to A. Therefore to a Sphere geuen, we haue made a cylinder equall.
                     
                  
                  
                     Or thus more briefely omitting all cutting of the Cylinder.
                     Forasmuch as BC is an vpright Cylinder: his sides are equall to his axe or heith: therefore the two cylinders, whereof one hath the heith QC and the other the heith QE, hauing both their bases, the greatest circle in the Sphere A, are one to the other as QC is to QE, by the 14. of this twelfth, but QC is to QE, as 3. to 2, by construction: and 3. to 2. is in Sesquialtera proportion: therefore the cylinder BC hauing his heith QC, &amp; his base the greatest circle in A cōteyned, is Sesquialtera to the cylinder which hath his base the greatest circle in A conteyned, and heith the line QE. But by the former Theoreme, BC, is also Sesquialtera to A: wherfore the cylinder hauing the base BQ (which by supposition,
                           The second part of the Probleme.
                         is equal to the greatest circle in A conteyned) and heith, QE, is equall to the sphere A, by the 7. of the fift. And now it can not be hard, to geue a cylinder, to A, in that proportion, which is betwene X and Y. For let the side QE, be to QP, as Y is to X, by the 12. of the sixt. Therefore backeward, QP is to QE as X to Y. Wherefore the cylinder hauing the base the greatest circle in A and heith the line QP,* is to the cylinder hauing the same base, and heith the line QE, as X is to Y, by the 14. of this twelfth: but the cylinder hauing the heith QE, &amp; his base the greatest circle in A, conteyned, is proued equall to the Sphere A. Wherefore by the 7. of the fift, the cylinder whose heith is QP and base the greatest circle in A, conteyned, is to the sphere A, as X to Y. Therefore to a sphere geuen: we haue made a cylinder, in any proportion geuen b

Suppose vpon the base BH, a cone to be rered of the heith of CS, which let be SBH: it is manifest that AB is tripla to that cone SBH, by the 10. of this twelfth. Wherfore a cone equal to AB the cylinder is tripla to SBH the cone, by the 7. of the fifth, but PBH is supposed equall to AB. Therefore PBH is tripla to SBH, therefore the heith of PBH shall be tripla to the heith of SBH by the 14. of the twelfth. But the heith of PBH, is CP: and of SBH, the heith is CS: wherefore CP is tripla to CS. And CS is the heith of the cylinder AB by supposition. Therefore a cone and a cylinder,

being both on one base, and equall, the heith of the cone is tripla to the heith of the cylinder. And the second part, as easely may be confirmed. For if AB a cylinder, and PBH a cone, haue one base, as the circle about BH: and the heith of PBH be tripla to the heith of AB, I say that PBH, and AB are equal.
                           The conuerse of the assūpt.
                         The heith of AB let be (as afore) CS: and of PBH, the heith, let be CP: of the heith CS, imagine a Cone vpon the same base BH: by the 10. of this twelfth, AB shall be triple to that cone. And the cone PBH hauing heith CP, (by supposition) tripla to CS, shall also be tripla to that cone SBH: by the 14. of this twel

                        th. Wherefore by the 7. of the fifth AB and PBH are equall. Therefore, if a cone and a cylinder being both on one base, the heith of the cone be tripla to the heith of the cylinder, the cone and the cylinder are equall. So haue we demonstrated both partes: as was required.

                               I say, that in the Sphere A, a circle, equall to the circle FKG, is to be coapted. First vnderstand, what we meane here, by coapting of a circle in a Sphere. We say, that circle to be coapted in a Sphere, whose whole circumference is in the superficies of the same Sphere.
Let the greatest circle in the Sphere A conteyned, be the circle BCD. Whose diameter suppose to be BD, and of the circle FKG, let FG be the diameter.
                              Construction.
                            By the 1. of the fourth, let a line equall to FG, be coapted in the circle BCD. Which line coapted, let be BE. And by the line BE, suppose a playne to passe, cutting the Sphere A, and

to be perpendicularly erected to the superficies

of BCD.
                              Demonstration.
                            Seing that the portion of the playne remayning in the sphere, is called their common section: the sayd section shall be a circle, as before is proued. And the common section of the sayd playne, and the greatest circle BCD, (which is BE by supposition) shall be the diameter of the same circle, as we will proue. For, let that circle be BLEM. Let the center of the sphere A, be the point H: which H, is also the cēter of the circle BCD, because BCD is the greatest circle in A conteyned. From H, the center of the sphere A, let a line perpendicularly be let fall to the circle BLEM. Let that line be HO: and it is euident that HO shall fall vpon the common section BE, by the 38. of the eleuenth. And it deuideth BE, into two equall parts, by the second part of the third proposition of the third booke: by which poynt O, all other lines drawne in the circle BLEM, are, at the same pointe O, deuided into two equall parts. As if from the poynt M, by the point O, a right line be drawne one the other side comming to the circumference, at the poynt N: it is manifest that NOM is deuided into two equall partes at the poynt O:
                              This is manifest: if you consider the two triangles rectangles, HOM and HON: and then with all, vse the 47. of the first of Euclide.
                            by reason, if from the center H, to the poyntes N and M, right lines be drawne, HN and HM, the squares of HM, and HN are equall: for that all the semidiameters of the sphere are equal: and therefore their squares are equall one to the other: and the square of the perpendicular HO, is common: wherefore the square of the third line MO is equall to the square of the third line NO: and therefore the line MO to the line NO. So therefore is NM equally deuided at the poynt O. And so may be proued of all other right lines, drawne in the circle BLEM, passing by the poynt O, to the circumference one both sides. Wherefore O is the center of the circle BLEM: and therefore BE passing by the poynt O is the diameter of the circle BLEM. Which circle (I say) is equal to FKG: for by construction BE is equall to FG: and BE is proued the diameter of BLEM, and FG is by supposition the diameter of the circle FKG: wherefore BLEM is equall to FKG the circle geuen: and BLEM is in A the sphere geuē. Wherfore we haue in a sphere geuen coapted a circle equall to a circle geuen: which was to be done.

                           Besides our principall purpose, in this Probleme, euidently demonstrated, this is also made manifest: that if the greatest circle in a Sphere, be cut by an other circle, erected vpon him at right angles, that the other circle is cut by the center, and that their common section is the diameter of that other  circle: and therefore that other circle deuided is into two equall partes.

                           A Sphere being geuen, and a circle, lesse then double the greatest circle in the same Sphere contained, to cut of, a segment of the same Sphere, whose Sphericall superficies, shall be equall to the circle geuen.
                        
                        Suppose K to be a Sphere geuen, whose greatest circle let be ABC: and the circle geuen, suppose to be DEF.
                              Construction.
                            I say, that a segment of the Sphere K, is to be cut of, so great, that his Sphericall superficies, shall be equall to the circle DEF. Let the diameter of the circle ABC, be the line AB. At the point A, in the circle ABC, coapt a right line equall to the semidiameter of the circle DEF (by the first of the fourth). Which line suppose to be AH. From the point H, to the diameter AB, let a perpendicular line be drawen: which suppose to be HI. Produce HI to the other side of the circumference, and let it come to the circumference at the point L. By the right line HIL (perpendicular to AB) suppose a plaine superficies to passe, perpendicularly erected vpon the circle ABC: and by this

plaine superficies, the Sphere to be cut into two segmentes:

one lesse then the halfe Sphere, namely, HALI: and the other greater then the halfe Sphere, namely, HBLI. I say, that the Sphericall superficies of the segment of the Sphere K, in which the segment (of the greatest circle) HALI, is contayned, (whose base is the circle passing by HIL, and toppe the point A) is equall to the circle DEF.
                              Demonstratiō
                              
                            For the circle, whose semidiameter is equall to the line AH, is equall to the Sphericall superficies of the segment HAL, by the 4. Theoreme here added. And (by construction) AH is equall to the semidiameter of the circle DEF: therefore the Sphericall superficies of the segment of the Sphere K (cut of by the circle passing by HIL) whose toppe is the point A, is equall to the circle DEF. Wherefore, a Sphere being geuen, and a circle lesse then double the greatest circle in the same Sphere, we haue cut of, a segment of the same Sphere, whose Sphericall superficies, is equall to the circle geuen: which was requisite to be done.
                        
                           ¶ An aduise.
                           In noting or signifying of Spheres, sometimes we vse by one and the same circle, in plaine designed, to represent a Sphere and also the greatest circle in the same contained: and likewise, by a segment of that circle, signifie a segment of the same Sphere, as by a straight line, we often signifie the circle, which is the base of a segment of a Sphere, Cone, or Cylinder: and so in such like. Wherin, consider our suppositions: and take heede when we shift from one signification to an other, in one and the same designation: and withall remember the principall intent of our drift: and such light thinges, can not either trouble or offend thee. Compendiousnes and artificiall custome, procureth such meanes: sufficient, to stirre vp imagination Mathematicall: or to informe the practiser Mechanicall.

                        Suppose F to be a Sphere geuen: and the proportion geuen, to be that, which is betwene GH and HI. I say, that the Sphere F, is to be cut into two such segmentes, that the Sphericall superficies of those segmentes, shall haue that proportion, one to the other, which, the right line GH, hath to the right line HI.
                              Construction.
                            Suppose ABCE to be a greatest circle, in the Sphere F, contained: and his diameter, to be AB. Deuide ABinto two such partes, as GI is diuided

into, in the point H (by the 10. of the sixt) Let those partes be AD, and DB. So that, as GH is to HI, so is AD to DB. By the point D, let a plaine superficies passe, cutting the Sphere F, and the diameter AB: So, that vnto that cutting plaine, the diameter AB, be perpendicular: and the Sphere also thereby by deuided into two segmentes, whose cōmon base suppose to be the circle CE, hauing the center, the point D: and the toppe of the one to be the point A, and the toppe of the other to be the point B: and the segmentes them selues, to be noted by EAC, and EBC: Drawe from the two toppes, A and B, to C (a point in the circumference of their common base) two right lines AC and BC. I say now, that the Sphericall superficies of the segment EAC, hath to the Sphericall superficies of the segment EBC, the same proportion,

                            which GH hath to HI. For, forasmuch as circles haue that proportion, one to the other, that the squares of their diameters haue one to the other (by the 2. of this twelfth).

Wherefore, seing AC and BC are semidiameters of two circles, whereof eche is equall to the Sphericall superficies of the segmentes, betwene whose toppes and circumference of their base, they are drawen: by the 4. Theoreme of these additions: it followeth that both those circles whose semidiameters they are: and also those Sphericall superficieces, which are equall to those circles, haue the one to the other, the same proportion, which the square of AC hath to the square of BC. But AC is drawen betwene the circumference of the base, and toppe of the segment Sphericall, EAC, by construction: and likewise BC is drawen betwene the

                           BC, by construction: Wherefore the Sphericall superficies of the segment EAC, is to the Sphericall superficies of the segment EBC, as the square of AC is to the square of BC. But the square of AC is to the square of BC, as AD is to DB: by the Corollary of the Probleme of my additions vpon the second of this twelfth: And AD is to DB, as GH is to HI: by construction. Wherefore the Sphericall superficies of the segment EAC, is to the Sphericall superficies of the segment EBC, as GH is to HI. We haue therfore, cut the Sphere geuen, into two such segmentes, that the Sphericall superficieces of the segmentes, haue one to the other any proportion geuen betwene two right lines: which was to be done.

                           ¶ A Corollary. 3.
                           
                              It likewise euidently followeth, that the two Sphericall superficieces of two segmentes of a Sphere: which two segmentes are equall to the Sphere, are in that proportion the one to the other, that their axes (perpendicularly erected to their bases) are in, one to the other: where soeuer in the Sphere those segmentes be taken.
                           
                           I say that the Sphericall superficies of the segment

CAE, and the Sphericall superficies of the segment FGH, hauing their axes AD and GI (perpendicular to their bases): are in proportion one to the other, as AD is to GI: if the segment of the Sphere containing CAE with (the segment of the same Sphere) FGH be equall to the whole Sphere. For seing the diameter (of axe) AD, extended to the other pole or toppe, opposite to A (which opposite toppe, let be Q) doth make with the segment CAE, the complement of the whole Sphere:
                                 Note here of Axe, base, &amp; soliditie, more then I nede to bring any farther proofe for.
                               and by supposition, the segment FGH, whith the segment CAE, are equall to the whole Sphere: Wherefore from equall, taking CAE (the segment common) remayneth the segment CQE, equall to the segment FGH. And therby, Axe, Base, Solitie, and superficies Sphericall of the segment FGH, must (of ncessitie) be equall to

the Axe, Base, Soliditie, and superficies Sphericall of the segment CQE: Wherefore, by the second Corollary here, and the 7. of the fift, our conclusion is inferred, the superficies Sphericall, of the segment CAE, to be, to the superficies Sphericall of the segment FGH, as AD is to GI.

                         vpon F the center of the base of the segment, whose toppe is B, erect a line perpendicular equall to FG found and drawe the lines GA and GC: and so make perfect the cone GAC. I say, that the cone GAC, is equall to the segment (of the sphere K) whose toppe is B. In like maner, for the other segmēt whose toppe is E, to finde the heith due for a cone equal to it: by the order of the Theoreme you must thus frame your lines: let the first be BF: the second DB and BF, composed in one right line, and the third must be EF: where by the 12. of the sixth, finding the fourth, it shall be the heith, to rere vpon the base, (the circle about AC,) to make an vpright cone, equall to the segment, whose toppe is E.
                  
                  
                     ¶ Logistically. ¶
                     The Logisticall finding hereof is most easy: the diameter of the sphere being geuen, and the portions of the diameter in the segmentes conteyned (or axes of the segmentes) being knowne. Then order your numbers in the rule of proportion, as I here haue made most playne, in ordring of the lines: for the

                        A Corollary. 1.
                        Hereby, and other the premises it is euident that to any segment of a Sphere,Note. whose whole diameter is knowne and the Axe of the segment geuen, An vpright cone may be made equall: or in any proportion, betwene two right lines assigned
                              •
                            and therefore also a cylinder may to the sayd segment of the Sphere, be made equall

                        A Corollary. 2.
                        Manifestly also, of the former theoreme, it may be inferred that a Sphere, and his diameter being deuided, by one and the same playne superficies, to which the sayd diameter is perpendicular

                     A Theoreme. 8.
                     
                        Euery Sphere, to the cube, made of his diameter, is (in maner) as 11. to 21.
                     
                        As vpon the first and second propositiōs of this booke, I began my additions with the circle (being the chiefe among playne figures) and therein brought manifold considerations, about circles: as of the proportion betwene their circumferences and their diameters of the content or Area of circles: of the proportion of circles to the squares described of their diameters: &amp; of circles to be geuen in al pro
                           •
                        portions, to other circles: with diuerse other most necessary problemes (whose vse is partly there specified): So haue I in the end of this booke, added some such Problemes &amp; Theoremes
                           •
                         about the sphere (being among solides the chiefe) as of the same, either in it selfe considered, or to cone and cylinder, compared (by reason of superficies, or soliditie, in the hole, or in part
                           •
                        ) such certaine knowledge demonstratiue may arise, and such mechanical exercise thereby be deuised, that (sure I am) to the sincere &amp; true student great light, ayde, and comfortable courage (farther to wade) will enter into his hart; and to the Mechanicall, witty, and industrous deuiser, new maner of inuentions, &amp; executions in his workes will (with small trauayle for fete application) come to his perceiueraunce and vnderstanding. Therefore, euen a, manifolde speculations &amp; practises may be had with the circle, his quantitie being not knowne in any kinde of smallest certayne measure: So likewise of the sphere many Problemes may be executed and his precise quantitie, in certaine measure, not determined, or knowne: yet, because, both one of the first (humane) occasiōs of inuenting and stablishing this Arte, was measuring of the earth (and therfore called Geometria, that is, Earthmeasuring), and also the chiefe and generall end (in deede) is measure: and measure requireth a determination of quantitie in a certayne measure by nūber expressed: It was nedefull for Mechanicall earthmeasures, not to be ignorant of the measure and contents of the circle, neither of the sphere his measure and quantitie, as neere as sense can imagine or wish. And (in very deede) the quantitie and measure of the circle, being knowne, maketh not onely, the cone and cylinder, but also the sphere his quantitie to be as precisely knowne, and certayne. Therefore seing in respect of the circles quantitie (by Archimedes specified) this Theoreme is noted vnto you: I wil, by order, vpon that (as a supposition) inferre the conclusion of this our Theoremes.

                        ith is equall to TV, it is euident that that parallelipipedon is a cube. Which let be done: and that cube produced, let be noted by TX. Likewise, if vpon the circle OZW, as a base, and of the heith equall to the line TV, a cylinder be erected, it is manifest that the cylinder hath his base equall to the greatest circle, in the sphere A, conteined: &amp; heith, a line equall to the diameter of the same sphere A. Which cylinder let be produced and noted by ZM. I say now that the sphere A, is to the cube TX, (in maner) as the number 11. is to the number 21. For seing the cube TX, was produced of his base, (the square TY), being brought into the heith of a line equall to TV: &amp; likewise seing the cylinder ZM,

is produced, of his base (the circle OZW) being brought into a line
                           •
                         equal to the said TV: it followeth, seing their heithes is all one, that the cube TX shall be to the cylinder ZM, as the base of TX, (which is the square TY) is to the base of ZM, that is the circle OZW. But the square TY, is to the circle OZW, as the number 14. is to the nūber 11. (in maner), by Archimedes demōstratiō: wherfore, the cube TX is to the cylinder ZM, as the number 1
                           •
                        , is to the number 11. (well nere). And by my third Theoreme (here added) the cylinder ZM, is to the Sphere A, in sesquialtera proportion: that is, as 3. to 2. Wherefore the cylinder ZM, hauing the same 11. equall partes (which he conteyneth in respect of the cube TX, being 14. of the same partes) deuided into 3. equall portions, euery one of those portions is 3⅔. And allowing to the Sphere A, two of those portions: it is euident, that the Sphere A shall be 71/

                        ; such partes as are 14. in the cube TX: and 11. in the cylinder ZM. Wherefore the Sphere A, is to the cube TX, as 71/

Now it is manifest (by the assumpt put before the 17. of this booke) that the two sections of the sphere shall be circles, hauing to their diameter the line LAC, which is also the diameter of the sphere. Wherefore the right lines GCH and KCI which are drawne in the playne GCI, do at the poynt C fall without the circles BCDL and ECL. Wherefore they touch the circles in the poynt C, by the second definition of the third. Wherefore the right line LAC maketh right angles with the lines GCH and KCI by the 16. of the third. Wherefore by the 4. of the eleuenth the right line AC is erected perpendicularly to to the playne superficies GCI wherein are drawne the lines GCH and KCI. If therefore a Sphere touch a playne superficies, a right line drawne from the centre to the touche, shall be erected perpendicularly to the playne superficies: which was required to be proued.

            IN THIS THIRTENTH BOOKE are set forth certayne most wonderfull and excellent passions of a lyne deuided by an extreme and meane proportion:
                  The argument of the thirtenth booke.
                a matter vndoubtedly of great and infinite vse in Geometry, as ye shall both in thys booke, and in the other bookes following most euidently perceaue. It teacheth moreouer the composition of the fiue regular solides, and how to inscribe them in a Sphere geuen, and also setteth forth certayne comparisons of the sayd bodyes both the one to the other, and also to the Sphere, wherein they are described.
            
               The 1. Theoreme. The 1. Proposition. If a right line be deuided by an extreme and meane proportion, and to the greater segment, be added the halfe of the whole line: the square made of those two lines added together shalbe quintuple to the square made of the halfe of the whole lyne.
               SVppose that the right

line AB be deuided by an extreme and meane proportiō in the point C. And let the greater segment therof, be AC. And vnto AC, adde directly a ryght line AD, and let AD be equall to the halfe of the line AB.Construction. Then I say that the square of the line CD is quintuple to the square of the line DA. Describe (by the 46. of the first) vpon the lines AB and DC squares, namely, AE &amp; DF. And in the square DF, describe and make complete the figure. And extend the line FC, to the point G.Demonstration. And forasmuch as the line AB is deuided by an extreme and meane proportion in the point C, therefore that which is contayned vnder the lines AB and BC is equall to the square of the line AC. But that which is contayned vnder the lines AB and BC, is the parallelogramme CE, and the square of

the line AC is the square HF. Wherefore the parallelogramme CE is equall to the square HF. And forasmuch as the line BA, is double to the line AD, by construct

But the square AE is equall to the gnomō MXN, wherefore the gnomō MXN, is also quadruple to the square DH. Wherefore the whole square DF is quintuple to the square DH. But the square DF, i

                  This proposition is the conuerse of the former.SVppose that the right line

DC be in power quintuple to a segment of the same line, namely, to AD, and let the double of the line AD be the line AB. Then I say that the line AB is deuided by an extreme and meane proportion, and the greater segment thereof is the lyne AC.Construction. Describe on either of the lines AB and CD squares, namely AE and DF. And in the square DF make perfect the figure, and extend the line FC to the point G.Demonstration. And forasmuch as the square DF is quintuple to the square DH, by suppossition, therfore the gnomon MNX is quadruple to the square DH. And forasmuch as the line AB is double to the line AD, therefore the square of the line AB is quadruple to the square of the line AD (by the 20.

of the sixt), that is, the square AE to the square DH. And it is proued that the gnomon MNX is quadruple to the square DH. Wherefore the gnomon MNX is equall to the square AE. And forasmuch as the line AB is double to the line AD, but the line AB is equall to the line AK, and the line AD to the line AH: therefore the line AK is double to the line AH: wherefore also (by the first of the sixth) the parallelogramme AG is double to the parallelogramme CH. But the parallelogrammes LH and CH are double to the parallelogramme CH (by the 43. of the first): wherefore the parallelogramme AG is equall to the parallelogrammes LH and CH. And it is proued that the whole gnomon MNX is equall to the whole square AE. Wherefore the residue HF is equall to the parallelogramme CE. And CE is that which is contained vnder the lines AB and CB, for the line AB is equall to the line BE, and HF is the square made of the line AC. Wherefore that which is contayned vnder the lines AB and BC, is equall to the square of the line AC. Wherfore as the line AB is to the line AC, so is the line AC to the line CB. An Assūpt. But the line A

                   greater then the line AC, wherefore the line AC is greater then the line CB. Wherefore the line AB is deuided by an extreme and meane proportion, and the greater segment thereof is the line AC. If therfore a right line be in power quintuple to a segment of the same line, the double of the sayd segment is deuided by an extreame &amp; meane proportion, and the greater segment thereof is the other part of the line geuen at the beginning: Which was required to be proued.
               
                  The Assūpt proued. Now, that the double of the line AD (that is AB) is greater then the line AC may thus be proued. For if not, then if if it be possible let the line AC be double to the line AD, wherefore the square of the line AC is quadruple to the square of the line AD. Wherefore the squares of the lines AC and AD are quintuple to the squares of the line AD. And it is supposed that the square of the line DC is quintuple to the square of the line AD, wherefore the square of the line DC is equall to the square of the lines AC and AD: which is impossible (by the 4. of the second). Wherefore the line AC is not double to the line AD. In like sorte also may we proue that the double of the line AD is not lesse then the line AC, for this is much more absurd: wherefore the double of the line AD is greater thē the line AC

                  Two Theoremes, (in Euclides Method necessary) added by M. Dee.
                  
                  
                     A Theoreme. 1.
                     
                        A right line can be deuided by an extreame and meane proportion, but in one onely poynt.
                     
                     Suppose a line diuided by extreame and meane proportion, to be AB. And let the greater segment be AC. I say, that AB can not be deuided by the sayd proportion, in any other point then in the point C. If an aduersary woulde contend that it may, in like sort, be deuided in an other point: let his other point, be supposed to be D: making AD; the greater segment of his imagined diuision. Which AD, also, let be lesse then our AC: for the first discourse. Now, forasmuch as by our aduersaries opinion, AD, is the greater segment, of his diuided line

                         the parallelogramme conteyned vnder AB, and DB, is equall to the square of AD, by the third definition and 17. proposition of the sixth Booke. And by the same definition and proposition, the parallelogramme vnder AB, and CB, conteyned, is equall to the square of our greater segment AC. Wherefore, as the parallelogramme, vnder AB, and D

AB is their equall heith.) Wherefore, the square of AD, shalbe greater then the square of AC: by the 14. of the fifth. But the line AD, is lesse then the line AC, by supposition: wherefore the square of AD is lesse then the square of AC. And it is concluded also to be greater then the square of AC: Wherefore the square of AD, is both greater, then the square of AC
                           •
                         and also lesse. Which is a thing impossible. The square therefore of AD, is not equall to the parallelogramme vnder AB, and DB. And therefore by the third definition of the sixth, AB is not deuided by an extreame and meane proportion, in the point D: as our aduersary imagined. And (Secondly) in like sort will the inconueniency fall out: if we assigne AD, our aduersaries greater segment, to be greater then our AC. Therefore seing neither on the one side of our point C: neither on the other side of the same point C, any point can be had, at which the line AB can be deuided by an extreame and meane proportion, it followeth of nec
                           •
                        ssitie, that AB can be deuided by an extreame and meane proportion in the point C, onely. Therefore, a right line can be deuided by an extreame and meane proportion, but in one, onely point: which was requisite to be demonstrated.
                  
                  
                     A Theoreme. 2.
                     
                        What right line so euer, being deuided into two partes, hath those his two partes, proportionall, to the two segmentes of a line deuided by extreame and meane proportion: is also it selfe deuided by an extreame and meane proportion: and those his two partes, are his two segments, of the sayd proportion.
                     
                     Suppose, AB, to be a line deuided by an extreame and meane proportion in the point C, and AC to be the greater segment. Suppose also the right line DE, to be deuided into two partes, in the point F: and that the part DF, is to FE, as the segment AC, is to CB: or DF, to be, to AC, as FE is to CB. For so these pa
                           •
                        tes are proportionall, to the sayd segmentes. I say now, that DE is also deuided by an extreame and meane proportion in the point F. And that DF, FE, are his segmentes of the sayd proportion. For, seing, as AC, is to CB: so is DF, to FE: (by supposition). Therfore, as AC, and CB (which is AB) are to CB: so is DF, and FE, (which is DE) to FE: by the 18. of the fifth. Wherefore (alternately) as AB is to DE: so is CB, to FE. And

therefore, the residue AC, is to the residue DF, as AB is to DE, by the fifth of the fift. And then alternately, AC is to AB, as DE, is to DF. Now therefore backward, AB is to AC, as DE is to DF. But as AB is to AC, so is AC to CB: by the third definition of the sixth booke. Wherefore DE is to DF, as AC is to CB: by the 11. of the fifth. And by supposition, as AC is to CB, so is DF to FE: wherefore by the 11. of the fifth, as DE is to DF: so is DF to FE. Wherefore by the 3. definition of the sixth, DE is deuided by an extreame and meane proportion, in the point F. Wherefore DF, and FE are the segmentes of the sayd proportion. Therefore, what right line so euer, being deuided into two partes, hath those his two partes, proportionall to the two segmentes of a line deuided by extreame and meane proportion
                           •

So likewise draw by the pointes D, C, vnto the line BE these parallel lines DL and CS, &amp; draw the diameter BT).Demonstration. And forasmuch as the line AC is double to the line DC, therefore the square of AC, is quadruple to the square of DC, by the 20. of the sixth, that is, the square RS to the square FG. And forasmuch as that which is contayned vnder the lines AB and BC is equall to the square of the line AC, and that which is contayned vnder the lines AB and BC is equall to the parallelogramme CE, &amp; the square of the line AC is the square RS: wherefore the parallelogramme CE is equall to the square RS. But the square RS is quadruple to the square FG: wherefore the parallelogramme CE also is quadruple to the square FG.

But the parallelogramme MF is equall to the parallelogramme CG, wherfore the parallelogramme CG is also equal to the parallelogramme FE. Put the parallelogramme CN, common to thē both: Note, how CE and the gnonom XOP, are proued equall, for it serueth in the conuerse demonstrated by M. Dee, here next after.

If therefore a right line be deuided by an extreme and meane proportion, and to the lesse segment be added the halfe of the greater segment: the square made of those two lines added together, is quintuple to the square made of the halfe line of the greater segmēt.

                     Forasmuch as, this, is the conuerse of Euclides third proposition: we will vse the same suppositions and constructions there specified: so farre, as they shall serue our purpose. Beginning therefore at the conclusion, we must infer the part of the proposition, before graunted. It was concluded, that the square of the line DB, is quintuple, to the square of the line DC, his owne segment. Therefore DN (the square of DB) is quintuple, to GF, (the square of DC). But the squa

Therfore by the 3. definitiō of the sixth booke, the whole line AB, is deuided by an extreme and meane proportion, &amp; AC, (the double of the segmēt DC) being middell proportionall, is the greater part therof.

                     A Theoreme. 2.
                     
                        If a right line, deuided by an extreme and meane proportion, be geuen, and to the great segment

                              •
                           dioyned.
                     
                     Suppose the line geuen, deuided by extreame and meane proportion, to be AB deuided in the point C, and his greater segment, let be AC: vnto AC directly adioyne a line equall to AB: let that be AD: I say, that AD, together with AC, (that is DC) is a deuided by extreme and middel proportion, whose greater segment is AD, the line adioyned. Deuide AD, equally in the point E. Now, forasmuch as AE, is the halfe of AD, (by construction,) it is also, the halfe of AB (equall, to AD, by construction): Wherfore by the 1. of the thirtenth, the square of the line composed of AC and AE (which 
                           •
                        ne is EC) is quintuple to the square of the line AE. Wherefore the double of AE, and the line AC

composed, (as in one right line) is a line deuided

by extreme and meane proportion, by the conuerse of this third (by me demonstrated): and the double of AE, is the greater segment. But DC is the line composed of the double of AE, &amp; the line AC: and with all, AD is the double of AE. Wherfore, DC, is a line deuided by extreme and meane proportion, and AD, i

If a right line, therefore, deuided by extreme and meane proportion, be geuen, and to the greater segment thereof, be directly adioyned a line equall to the whole line geuen, that adioyned line, and the sayd greater segment, do make a line diuided by extreame and meane proportion, whose greater segment, is the line adioyned: Which was required to be demonstrated.
                     
                        Two other briefe demonstrations of the same.
                        Forasmuch as, AD is to AC: as AB, is to AC (because AD is equall to AB, by construction): but as AB is to AC, so is AC to CB: by supposition. Therefore by the 11. of the fifth, as AC, is to CB, so is AD to AC. 
                              Therefore, by my second Theoreme added vpon the second proposition, DC is deuided by extreame and meane proportion in the point A. And because AC is bigger then CB: therfore DA is greater then AC: wherefore if a right line &amp;c. as in the proposition. Which was to be demonstrated.
                            Wherefore, as AC, and CB, (which is AB) is to CB: so is AD, and AC (which is DC) to AC. Therefore, euersedly, as AB, is to AC: so is DC to AD. And it is proued, AD, to be to AC: as AC is to CB. Wherefore as AB is to AC, and AC, to CB: so is DC, to AD, and AD, to AC. But AB, AC, and CB are in continuall proportion, by supposition: Wherfore DC, AD, and AC, are in continuall proportion. Wherefore, by the 3. definition of the sixth booke, DC, is deuided by extreme and middell proportion, and his greatest segment, is AD. Which was to be demonstrated. Note from the marke 
                              Therefore, by my second Theoreme added vpon the second proposition, DC is deuided by extreame and meane proportion in the point A.

                        ¶A Corollary. 1.
                        
                           Vpon Euclides third proposition demonstrated, it is made euident: that, of a line deuided by extreame and meane proportion, if you produce the lesse segment, equally to the length of the greater: the line therby adioyned, together with the sayd lesse segment, make a new line deuided by extreame and middle proportion: Whose lesse segment, is the line adioyned.
                        
                        For, if AB, be deuided by extreme and middell proportion in the point C, AC, being the greater segment, and CB be produced, from the poynt B, making a line, with CB, equall to AC, which let be CQ: and the line thereby adioyned, let be BQ: I say that CQ, is a line also deuided by an extreame and meane proportion, in the point B: and that BQ (the line adioyned) is the lesse segment. For by the thirde, it is proued, that halfe AC, (which, let be, CD) with CB, as one line, composed, hath his powre or square, quintuple to the powre of the

segment CD: Wherfore, by the second of this booke, the double of CD, is deuided by extreme and middell proportion

                            and the greater segment thereof, shalbe CB. But, by construction, CQ, is the double of CD, for it is equall to AC. Wherefore CQ is deuided by extreme and middle proportion, in the point B: and the greater segment thereof shalbe, CB. Wherefore BQ, is the lesse segment, which is the line adioyned. Therefore, a line being deuided, by extreme and middell proportion, if the lesse segment, be produced equally to the length of the greater segment, the line thereby adioyned together with the sayd lesse segment, make a new line deuided, by extreme &amp; meane proportion, who

                        For, taking from AC, a line equall to CB: let AR remayne. I say, that AC, is deuided by an extreme and meane proportion in the point R: and that CR, the line cut of, is the greater segment. For it is proued in the former Corollary that CQ is deuided by extreme and meane proportion in the point B. But AC, is equall to CQ, by construction: and CR is equall to CB by construction: Wherefore the

is equal to CB the greater part of CQ and the lesse segmēt also equall to the lesse: and withall seing CQ is proued to be diuided by extreme &amp; meane proportion in the point B, it foloweth of necessity, that, AC, is diuided by extreme and meane proportion in the point R. And seing CB, is the greater segment of CQ: CR shall be the greater segment of AC. Which was to be demonstrated.

DF: by the 9. of the sixth. And let that sixth part, be the line DG. Vppon DF, as a diameter, describe a semicircle: which let be DHF. From the point G, rere a line perpendicular to DF, which suppose to be GH: and let it come to the circumference of DHF, in the point H. Draw right lines, HD, and HF. Produce DH, from the point H, so long, till a line adioyned with DH, be equall to HF, which let be DI, equall to HF. From the point H, to the point B, (the one ende of our line geuen) let a right line be drawen: as HB.

Wherefore by the 11. of the fifth, the square of DK is to the square of DB, as the line GF is to the line GD. But by construction, GF is quintuple to GD. Wherefore the square of DK is quintuple to the square of DB: and therefore, the double of DB, is deuided by an extreme and meane proportiō, and BK is the greater segment therof, by the 2. of this thirtenth. Wherefore seing AB is the double of DB by construction: the line AB is deuided by an extreme and meane

proportion: and his greater segment, is the line BK. Wherefore AB is deuided by an extreme and meane proportion, in the point K. We haue therefore deuided by extreme and meane proportion any line geuen in length and position. Which was requisite to be done.

But that which is contayned vnder the lines AB and CB is the parallelogramme

AK, and the square of the line AC

is the square FD. Wherefore the parallelogramme AK is equall to the square FD. And the parallelogramme AF is equall to the parallelogramme FE, put the square CK common to them both wherfore the whole parallelogrāme AK is equall to the whole parallelogramme CE.

Wherefore the gnomon LMN and the squares CK and DF, are treble to the square DF. But the gnomon LMN and the squares CK and DF, are the whole square AE together with the square CK, which are the squares of the lines AB and BC. And DF is the square of the line AC. Wherefore the squares of the lines AB and BC, are treble to the square of the line AC.

And forasmuch as the line AB, is deuided by an extreame and meane proportion in the point C, therefore that which is contayned vnder the lines AB and BC is equall to the square of the line AC. But that which is contayned vnder the lines AB and BC

is the parallelogramme CE

But vnto the square CH is equall the square DH, by the first of the sixth: and vnto the parallelogramme CE, is equall the parallelogramme HE. Wherefore the parallelogramme DH is equall to the parallelogramme HE. Adde the parallelogramme HB, common to them both. Wherefore the whole parallelogramme DK is equall to the whole square AE. And the parallelogramme DK, is that which is contayned vnder the lines BD and DA, for the line AD is equall to the line DL, &amp; the square AE is the square of the line AB. Wherfore that which is contayned vnder the lines AD and DB is equall to the square of the line AB. Wherefore as the line DB is to the line BA, so is the line BA to the line AD, by the 17. of the sixth. But the line DB is greater then the line BA. Wherefore the line BA is greater then the line AD. Wherefore the line BD is deuided by an extreame and meane proportion in the point A, and his greater segment is the line AB. If therefore a right line be deuided by an extreame and meane proportion, and vnto

                  t be added a right line, equall to the greater segment: the whole  right line is deuided by an extreame and meane proportion, and the greater segment therof, is the right line geuen at the beginning: which was required to be demonstrated.

Then I say that the square of the line CD is quintuple to the square of AD. For forasmuch as the square of the line CD is quintuple to the square of AD: but the square of the line

CD is (by the 4. of the second) equall to that which is composed of the squares of the lines CA, &amp; AD, together with that

which is contayned vnder the lines CA, and AD twise. Wh

Wherfore, that which is composed of the square of the line CA together with that, which is contayned vnder the lines CA, and AD twise is quadruple to the square of the line AD. But vnto that, which is contayned vnder the lines CA, and AD, twise, is equall that which is contayned vnder the lines CA, and AB, for the line AB is double to the line AD. And vnto the square of the line AC, is equall that which is cōtayned vnder the lines AB &amp; BC, for the line AB, is by supposition diuided by an extreme and meane proportion, in the point C.

But that, which is composed of that which is contayned vnder the lines AB, and AC, together with that which is contayned vnder the lines AB, and BC, is the square of the line AB (by the 2. of the second.)

Wherefore that which is contayned vnder the lines BA, and AC, together with that which is contayned vnder the lines BA, and BC is quadruple to the square of the line AD.

Wherfore that which is composed of the squares of the lines DA, and AC, together with that which is contayned vnder the lines DA, and AC, twise, is quintuple to the square of the line DA. But that which is composed of the squares of the lines DA, and AC, together with that which is contayned vnder the lines DA, and AC twise, is equall to the square of the line CD (by the 4. of the second).

Wherefore the squares of the lines DA, and AC, together with that which is contayned vnder the lines DA, and AC, twise, which is the square of the line DC, are quintuple to the square of the line DA. And so are they in deede by supposition.
                  
                  
                     Composition of the 2. Theoreme.
                     Now forasmuch as the square of the line CD, is quintuple to the square of the line DA

Wherefore that which is contayned vnder the lines DA, and AC twise, which is that, which is contayned vnder the lines BA, and AC once, together with the square of the line AC, is equall to the square of the line AB. But the square of BA, is that which is contayned vnder the lines BA, and AC, together with that which is contayned vnder the lines BA, and BC. Wherfore that which is contayned vnder the lines BA, &amp; AC, together with that which is cōtayned vnder the lines AB, &amp; BC, is equall to that which is contayned vnder the lines BA, and AC together with the square of the line AC.

Wherefore as the line BA, is to the line AC, so is the line AC to the line CB. But the line BA is greater then the line AC, wherefore the line AC also is greater then the line CB. Wherefore the line AB is diuided by an extreame, and meane proportion in the poynt C, and the greater segment thereof is the line AC, which was required to be demonstrated.
                  
                  
                     Resolution of the 3. Theoreme.

                         and let the greater segment thereof be the line AC, and let the halfe of the line AC, be the line CD. Then I say that the square of the BD is quintuple to the square of the line CD. For forasmuch as the square of the line BD, is quintuple to the square of the line CD. But the square of the line DB, is that which is contayned vnder the lines AB, and BC, together with the square of the line DC (by the 6. of the second). Wherefore that which is contayned vnder the lines AB, and BC,

But vnto that which is contayned vnder the lines AB, and BC, is equall the square of the line AC: for the line AB, is diuided by an extreame and meane proportion in the point C. Wherefore the square of the line AC is quadruple to the square of the line DC: and so is it in deede, for the line AC is double to the line DC.

                     Forasmuch as the line AC is double to the line DC, therefore the square of the line AC is quadruple to the square of the line DC (by the 20. of the sixth). But vnto the square of the line AC, is equall that which is contayned vnder the lines AB, and BC, by supposition: wherefore that which is contayned vnder the lines AB, and BC, is quadruple to the square of the line CD. Wherefore, that which is contayned vnder AB, and BC, tother with the square the line DC, which is the square of the line DB (by the 6. of the second) is quintuple to the square of the line DC: which was required to be demonstrated.
                  
                  
                     Resolution of the 4. Theoreme.
                     Suppose that a certayne right line AB, be diuided by an extreme and meane proportion in the point C. And let the greater segment thereof be AC. Then I say that the squares of the lines AB, and BC, are treble to the square of the line AC. For forasmuch as the squares of the lines AB, and BC, are treble to the square of the line AC, but the squares of the lines AB, and BC, are that which is contayned vnder AB, and BC, twise together with the square of the line AC (by the 7. of the second). Wherefore that which is contayned vnder the lines AB, and BC, twise, together with the square

of the line AC, is treble to the square of the line AC. Wherefore, that which is contayned vnder the lines AB, &amp; BC, twise, is double to the square of the line AC. Wherefore that which is contayned vnder the lines AB, and BC, once, is equall to the square of the line AC. And so it is in deede. For the line AB is diuided by an extreme, and meane proportion in the point C.

                         I say that the line DB, is diuided by an extreme and meane proportion in the point A. And the greater segment therof is the line AB. For forasmuch as the line DB is diuided by an extreme &amp; meane proportion in the point A, and the greater segment thereof is the line AB, therfore as the line DB, is to the line BA, so is the line BA,

to the line AD: but the line AD, is equall to the line AC: wherefore as

the line DB, is to the line BA, so is the line BA to the line AC. Wherfore by conuersiō as the line BD is to the line DA, so is the line AB to the line BC (by the corollary of the 19. of the fifth): wherfore by diuision, by the 17. of the fifth, as the line BA, is to the line AD,

And so it is indeede, for the line AB is, by supposition, diuided by an extreme and meane proportion in the point C.
                  
                  
                     Composition of the 5. Theoreme.
                     Now forasmuch as the line AB, is diuided by an extreme and meane proportion in the point C: therefore as the line BA is to the line AC, so is the line AC to the line CB: but the line AC is equall to the line AD. Wherefore as the line BA is to the line AD, so is the line AC to the line CB. Wherfore by composition (by the 18. of the fifth) as the line BD is to the line DA, so is the line AB to the line BC. Wherefore by conuersion (by the corollary of the 19. of the fiueth) as the line DB is to the line BA, so is the line BA to the line AC: but the line AC is equall to the line AD. Wherefore as the line DB is to the line BA, so is the line BA to the line AC. Wherfore the line DB, is deuided by an extreme and meane proportion in the point A: and his greater segment is the line AB: which was required to be demonstrated.

Then I say that eyther of the lines AC, and CB, is an irrationall line of that kinde, which is called a residuall. Extend the line AB, to the point D:Construction. and let the line AD, be equall to halfe of the line AB.

Now forasmuch as the right line AB,Demonstration. is diuided by an extreme &amp; meane proportion in the point C, and vnto the greater segmēt AC is added a line AD, equall to the halfe of the right line AB: therfore (by the 1. of the thirtenth) the square of the line CD, is quintuple to the square of the line AD. Wherefore the square of the line CD, hath to the square of the line AD, that proportion that nūber hath to nūber. Wherfore the square of the line CD is commēsurable to the square of the line AD. But the square of the line DA is rationall, for the line DA is rationall; forasmuch as it is the halfe of the rationall line AB. Wherefore the square of the line CD, is rationall. Wherefore also the lin

                   CD, is rationall. And forasmuch as the square of the line CD; hath not to the square of the line AD, that proportion that a square number hath to a square number, therfore (by the 9. of the tenth) the line CD, is incommensurable in length, to the line AD. Wherefore the lines CD, and DA are rationall commensurable in power only. Wherfore the line AC is a residuall line, by the 73. of the tenth. Againe, forasmuch as the line AB, is deuided by an extreme and meane proportion, and the greater segment thereof is AC, therfore that which is cōtayned vnder the lines AB, &amp;. BC, is equall to the square of the line AC. Wherefore the square of the line AC, applyed to the rationall line AB, maketh the bredth BC. But the square of a residuall line, applied to a rationall line maketh the bredth a first residuall line (by the 97. of the tenth). Wherefore the line CB, is a first residuall line. And it is proued that the line AC, is also a residuall line. If therefore a rationall right line be diuided by an extreme and mean

Wherfore also the line DB is rationall. And forasmuch as the squares of the lines DB &amp; DC, are not in proportion, as a square nūber is to a square number: therefore the lines DB and DC are incommensurable in length (by the 9. of the tenth.)

But it is proued that the angle AEC is double to the angle ECB, wherefore the angle AEC is quadruple to the angle EDC. And it is proued that the angle AEC is quadruple to the angle BEC. Wherefore the angle EDC is equall to the angle BEC. And the angle EBD is common to the two triangles BEC and BED: wherefore the angle remayning BED is equall to the angle remayning ECB, by the corollary of the 32. of the first. Wherefore the triangle EBD is equiangle to the triangle EBC. Wherfore, by the 4. of the sixt, proportionally, as the line BD is to the line BE, so is the line BE to the line BC. But the line EB is equall to the line CD. Wherefore as the line BD is to the DC, so is the line DC to the line CB. But the line BD is greater then the line DC: wherefore also the line DC is greater then the line CB. Wherefore the right line BD is diuided by an extreame and meane proportion in the point C: and his greater segment is DC. If therefore the side of an equilater hexagon, and the side of an equilater decagon or tenangled figure, which both are inscribed in one and the selfe same circle, be added together
                     •
                   the whole right line made of them, is a line diuided by an extreame and meane proportion, and the greater segment of the same is the side of the hexagon: which was required to be proued.

                        4. booke after Campane.
                     Hereby it is manifest, that the side of an exagon inscribed in a circle being cut by an extreame and meane proportion, the greater segment thereof is the side of the decagon inscribed in the same circle. For if from the right line DC be cut of a right line equall to the line CB, we may thus reason, as the whole DB is to the whole DC, so is the part taken away DC to the part taken away CB: wherefore by the 19. of the fifth, the residue is to the residue as the whole is to the whole. Wherefore the line DC is cutte like vnto the line DB: and therefore is cut by an extreame and meane proportion.
               
               
                  
                  
                     Campane putteth the conuerse of this proposition after this maner.

And of what circle the lesse segment is the side of an equilater Decagon, of the same is the greater segment the side of an equilater Hexagon.
                  
                  For the former figure remayning, suppose that the line BD be diuided by an extreme and meane proportion in the point C: and let the greater segment therof be DC. Thē I say that of what circle the line DC is the side of an equilater Hexagon, of the same circle is the line CB the side of an equilater decagon: and of what circle, the line BC is the side of an equilater Decagon, of the same is the line DC the side of an equilater Hexagon.
                        Demonstration of the first part.
                      For if the line

DC be the side of an Hexagon inscribed in the circle, then by the corollary of the 15. of the fourth, the line DC is equal to the line BE. And forasmuch as the proportiō of the line BD to the line DC is as the proportion of the line DC to the line CB, by supposition: therfore (by the 7. of the fifth) the proportion of the line BD to the line BE, is as the proportion of the line BE to the line BC. Wherefore (by the 6. of the sixth) the two triangles DEB, EBC are equiangle (for the angle B is common to eche triangle). Wherefore the angle D is equall to the angle CEB: for they are subtended of sides of like proportion. And forasmuch as the angle AEC is quadruple to the angle D (by the 32. of the first twise taken, and by the 5. of the same) therefore the same angle AEC is quadruple to the angle CEB. Wherefore (by the last of the sixth) the circumference AC is quadruple to to the circumferēce CB. Wherfore the line BC is the side of a decagon inscribed in the circle ACB.
                  But now if the line BC be the side of a decagon inscribed in the circle ABC, the line CD shalbe the side of an Hexagon inscribed in the same circle.
                        Demonstration of the second part.
                      For let DC be the side of an Hexagon inscribed in the circle H. Now by the first part of this proposition the line BC shalbe the side of a decagon inscribed in the same circle. Suppose that in the two circles ACB and H be inscribed equilater decagons, all whose sides shalbe equall to the line CB. And forasmuch as euery equilater figure inscribed in a circle is also equiangle, therefore bothe the decagons are equiangle. And forasmuch as al the angles of the one taken together

are equall to al the angles of the other taken tog

And for that if there be two like rectiline figures inscribed in two circles, the proportion of the sides of like proportion of those figures, shalbe as the proportion of the Diameters of those circles, as it is easy to proue by the corollary of the 20. of the sixth, and first of this book

But the circumference CD is double to the circumference CG: wherefore the circumference CG is equall to the circumference BK. But the circumference BK is double to the circumference KM (for that the circumference KA is double thereunto)

               ¶The 11. Theoreme. The 11. Proposition. If in a circle hauing a rationall line to his diameter be inscribed an equilater pentagon: the side of the pentagon is an irrationall line, and is of that kinde which is called a lesse line.
               SVppose that in the circle ABCDE hauing a rationall line to his diameter be inscribed a pentagon figure ABCDE. Then I say that the side of the pentagon figure ABCDE, namely, the side AB, is an irrational line of that kinde which is called a lesse line. Take (by the 1. of the third) the centre of the circle, and let the same be the point F, and draw a right line from the point A to the point F,Construstion. and an other from the point F to the point B, and extend those lines to the pointes G and H. And draw a right line from the point A to the point C. And from the semidiameter FH take the fourth part (by the 9. of the sixt) and let the same be FK: But the line FH is rationall (for that it is the halfe of the diameter which is supposed to be rationall), wherefore also the

line FK is rationall. And the line or semidiameter BF is rationall. Wherefore the whole line BK is rationall.Demonstration. And forasmuch as the circumference ACG is equall to the circumference ADG, of which the circumference ABC is equall to the circumference AED, wherefore the residue CG is equall to the residue GD. Now if we drawe a right line from the point A to the point D, it is manifest that the angles ALC and ALD are right angles. For forasmuch as the circumference CG is equall to the circumference GD, therefore (by the last of the sixth) the angle CAG is equall to the angle DAG. And the line AC is equall to the line AD, for that the circumferences which they subtend are equall, and the line AL is c
                     •
                  mmon to them both, therefore there are two lines AC and AL equall to two lines AD and AL, and the angle CAL is equall to the angle DAL. Wherefore (by the 4. of the first) the base CL is equall to the base LD, and the rest of the angles to the rest of the angles, and the line CD is double to the line CL. And by the same reason may it be proued, that the angles at the point M are right angles, and that the line AC is double to the line CM. Now forasmuch as the angle ALC is equall to the angle AMF, for that they are both right angles, and the angle LAC is common to both the triangles ALC and AMF: wherefore the angle remayning, namely, ACL, is equal to the angle remayning AFM, by the corollary of the 32. of the first. Wherefore the triangle ACL is equiangle to the triangle AMF. Wherefore proportionally, by the 4. of the sixth, as the line LC is to the line CA, so is the line MF to the line FA. And in the same proportion also are the doubles of the antecedents LC and MF (by the 15. of the fifth). Wherefore as the double of the line LC is to the line CA, so is the double of the line MF to the line FA. But as the double of the line MF is to the line FA, so is the line MF to the halfe of the line FA, by the 15. of the fifth, wherefore as the double of the line LC is to the line CA, so is the line MF to the halfe of the line FA, by the 11. of the fifth. And in the same proportion, by the 15. of the fifth, are the halues of the consequents, namely, of CA and of the halue of the line AF. Wherefore as the double of the line LC is to the halfe of the line AC, so is the line MF to the fourth part of the line FA. But the double of the line LC is the line DC, and the halfe of the line CA is the line CM, as hath before bene proued, and the fourth part of the line FA is the line FK (for the line FK is the fourth part of the line FH by construction). Wherfore as the line DC is to the line CM, so is the line MF to the line FK. Wherfore by composition (by the 18. of the fifth) as both the lines DC and CM are to the line CM, so is the whole line MK to the line FK.

Wherefore also (by the 22. of the sixt) as the squares of the lines DC and CM are to the square of the line CM, so is the square of the line MK to the square of the line FK. And forasmuch as (by the 8. of the thirtenth) a line which is subtended vnder two sides of a pentagon figure, as is the line AC, being diuided by an extreame &amp; meane propor
                     •
                  ion, the greater segment is equall to the side of the pentagon figure, that is, vnto the line DC: and (by the 1. of the thirtenth) the greater segment hauing added vnto it the halfe of the whole, is in power quintuple to the square made of the halfe of the whole: and the halfe of the whole line AC is the line CM. Wherefore the square that is made of the lines DC and CM, that is, of the greater segment and of the halfe of the whole, as of one line, is quintuple to the square of the line CM, that is, of the halfe of the whole. But as the square made of the lines DC and CM, as of one line, is to the square of the line CM, so is it proued, that the square of the line MK is to the square of the line FK. Wherefore the square of the line MK is quintuple to the square of the line FK. But the square of the line KF is rationall, as

hath before bene proued, wherefore also the square of the line MK is rationall, by the 9. diffinition of the tenth, for the square of the line MK hath to the square of the line KF that proportion that number, hath to number, namely, that 5. hath to 1. and therefore the sayd squares are commensurable, by the 6. of the tenth. Wherefore also the line MK is rationall. And forasmuch as the line BF is quadruple to the line FK (for the semidiameter BF is equal to the semidiameter FH), therfore the line BK is quintuple to the line FK. Wherefore the square of the line BK is 25. times so much as the square of the line KF, by the corollary of the 20 of the sixt. But the square of the line MK, is quintuple to the square of the FK, as is proued. Wherfore the square of the line BK is quintuple to the square of the line KM. Wherfore ye square of the line BK, hath not to ye square of the line KM, that proportiō that a square number hath to a square number, by the corollary of the 25. of the eight. Wherefore (by the 9. of the tenth) the line BK is incommensurable in length to the line KM, and either of the lines is rationall. Wherefore the lines BK and KM are rationall commensurable in power onely. But if frō a rationall line be taken away a rationall line being commensurable in power onely to the whole, that which remayneth is irrationall, and is (by the 73. of the tenth) called a residuall line. Wherefore the line MB is a residuall line. And the line conueniently ioyned vnto it, is the line MK. Now I say that the line BM is a fourth residuall line. Vnto the excesse of the square of the line BK aboue the square of the line KM, let the square of the line N be equall (which excesse how to finde out, is taught in the assumpt put after the 13. proposition of the tenth). Wherefore the line BK is in power more then the line KM by the square of the line N. And forasmuch as the line KF is commensurable in length to the line FB, for it is the fourth part thereof, therefore (by the 16. of the tenth) the whole line KB is commensurable in length to the line FB. But the line FB is commensurable in length to the line BH, namely, the semidiameter
                     •
                   to the diameter: wherefore the line BK is commensurable in length to the line BH, by the 12. of the tenth. And forasmuch as the square of the line BK is quintuple to the square of the line KM, therefore the square of the line BK hath to the square of the line KM that proportion that fiue hath to one. Wherefore by conuersion of proportion (by the corollary of the 19. of the fifth) the square of BK hath to the square of the line N, that proportion that fiue hath to fower: &amp; therfore it hath not that proportiō that a square number hath to a square number, by the corollary of the 25. of the eight. Wherfore, the line BK is incommensurable in length to the line N (by the 9. of the tenth). Wherfore the line BK is in power more then the line KM, by the square of a line incommensurable in length to the line BK. Now then forasmuch as the whole line BK is in power more then the line conueniently ioyned, namely, then KM, by the square of a line incōmensurable in length to the line BK, and the whole line BK is commensurable in length to the rationall line geuen BH: therefore the line MB is a fourth residuall line, by the diffinition of a fourth residuall line. But a rectangle parallelogramme contayned vnder a rationall line and a fourth residual line, is irrationall, and the line which contayneth in power the same parallelogramme is also irrationall, and is called a lesse line (by the 94. of the tenth). But the line AB contayneth in power the parallelogramme contayned vnder the lines HB and BM (for if we drawe a right line from the point A to the point H, the triangle ABH shall be like to the triangle ABM, by the 8. of the sixth. For from the right angle BAH is drawen to the base BH a perpendicular line. And therefore as the line BH is to the line BA, so is the line AB to the line BM. this followeth also of the co

Wherefore it is equall to the line drawen from the centre of the circle to the circumference, that is vnto the line DE (by the corollary of the 15. of the sixth).

But the square of the line AE is equall to the squares of the lines AB, and BE (by the 47. of the first) for the angle ABE is (by the 31. of the third) a right angle.

                  A Corollary added by Campane.
                  
                  Hereby it is manifest, that the line BC, which is the side of the equilater triangle, diuideth the semidiameter DE into two equall parts. For let the poynt of the diuision be F. And suppose a line to be drawen from the poynt D to the B, and an other from the poynt D to the poynt C. Now it is manifest (by the 4. of the first) that the line BF is equall to the line FC, and therefore (by the 3. of the third) all the angles at the poynt F are

Wherefore taking away the square of the line BF which is cōmon to them both: the residue, namely, the square of the line DF shalbe equall to the residue, namely, to the square of the line FE. Wherfore also the line FD is equal to the line FE. Wherfore hereby it is manifest that a

                  A Corollary added by Flussas.
                  
                  The side of an equilater triangle is in power sesquitertia to the perpendicular line which is drawē from one of the angles to the opposite side. For of what parts the line AB contayneth in power 12. of

such parts the line BF which is the halfe of AB contayned in power 3.

                      Wherefore the residue, namely, the perpendicular line AF contayneth in power of such parts 9. (for the squares of the lines AF, and BF are by the 47. of the first equall to the square of the line AB). Now 1

                      wherfore the power of the line AB is to the power of the line AF in sesquitertia proportion.
                  Moreouer the side of the triangle is the meane proportionall betwene the diameter and the perpendicular line: For (by the Corollary of the 8. of the sixth) the line AE is to the line AB as the line AB is to the line AF.
                  Farther the perpendicular line drawen from the angle diuideth the base into two equal parts and passeth by the center.
                        This Corollary is the 3. Corollary after the 17. proposition of the 14 booke after Campane.
                      For if there should be drawen any other right line frō the point A to the poynt F, thē that which is drawen by the point D, two right lines should include a superficies, which is impossible. Wherefore the contrary followeth, namely, that the line, which being drawen from the angle passeth by the center, is a perpendicular line to the base (by the 3. of the third).

But it toucheth euery one of these right lines, HE, HF and HG: Wherefore the right line HK is erected perpendicularly to euery one of these lines HE, HF, and HG. And forasmuch as the line AC is equal to the line HK, and the line CD to the line HE, and they comprehende right angles, therfore the base DA is equall to the base KE (by the 4 of the first). And by the same reason ech of the lines KF, and KG is equall to the line DA. Wherefore the three lines KE, KF, and KG are equall the one to the other.

Wherfore (by the corollary of the 20. of the same) the square of the line AC is to the square of the line CD, as the line AC is to the line CB: wherefore by composition (by the 18. of the fiueth) the squares of the lines AC and CD are to the square of the line CD, as the line AB is to the line BC. But the squares of the lines AC and CD are (by the 47. of the first) equall to the square of the line AD: wherefore (by the 7. of the fiueth) the square of the line AD is to the square of the line DC, as the line AB is to the line BC.]
Wherefore the square of the line AD is treble to the square of the line DC. And forasmuch as the line KE is equall to the line AD (as it hath ben proued) and the line HE is put equall to the line CD

Now the lines KE, KF, and KG are equall the one to the other, as it hath before ben proued, and so also are the lines EF, FG and GE, for that they are the sides of an equilater triangle. Wherefore euery one of these lines EF, FG, and GE, is equall to euery one of the lines KE, KF and KG. Wherefore these fower triangles EFG, KEF, KFG and KGE are equilater.

                     nderstanding of this reason. For if we draw a right line from the point E to the poynt L, the angle LEK shalbe a right angle, for that the triāgle ELK is equiangle to either of the triangles ELH and EHK (by the 8. of the sixth.) Now then if the the diameter KL abiding fixed, the semicircle be turned round about, vntil it returne vnto the selfe same place from whense it began to be moued, it shall also passe by the pointes F and G. For drawing a right line from the ponit F to the point L, and an other from the poynt L to the point G, which also maketh at the points F and G right angles, the pyramis shall be contayned in the sphere geuen. For the line KL being the diameter of the sphere is equall to the line AB, which is the diameter of the sphere geuen, for the line KH is put equall to the line AC, and the line HL to the line CB.

                  And draw a line from M to G. And forasmuch as by construction the line KH is equall to the line AC, and the line HL to the line CB: therefore the whole line AB is equal to the whole line KL. Wherefore also the halfe of the line KL, namely, the line LM, is equal to the semidiameter BN: wherefore taking away from those equall lines, equall parts BC and LH, the residues NC, and MH shalbe equall. Wherefore in the two triangles MHG and NCD, the two sides about the equall right angles DCN and GHM, namely, the sides DC, CN, and GH, HM, are equall: wherfore the bases MG and ND are equall (by the 4. of the first.) And by the same reason may it be proued that right lines drawen from the poynt M to the points E and F are equal to the line ND. But the right line ND is equall to the line AN, which is drawen from the centre to the circumference: wherefore the line MG is equall to the line MK, &amp; also to the lines ME, MF and ML. Wherfore making the cētre the poynt M, and the space MK or MG describe a semicircle KGL: and the diameter KL abiding fixed let the sayd semicircle KGL be moued rounde about vntill it returne to the same place from whence it began to be moued: and there shalbe described a sphere about the centre M (by the 12. diffinition of the eleuenth) touching euery one of the angles of the Pyramis which are at the points K, E, F, G: for those angles are equally distāt from the centre of the sphere, namely, by the semidiameter of the sayd sphere, as hath before bene proued.

               Now I say, that the diameter of the sphere is in power sesquialtera to the side of the Pyramis.Third part of the demonstration. For forasmuch as the line AC is double to the line CB (by cōstructiō) therfore the line AB is treble to the line BC. Wherfore by conuersion) by the corollary of the 19. of the fiueth) the line AB is sesquialtera to the line AC. But as the line BA is to the line AC, so is the square of the line BA, to the square of the line AD. For if we draw a right line frō the point B, to the point D, as the line BD is to the line AD, so is the same AD to the line AC, by reasō of the likenes of the ttriangles DAB, &amp; DAC (by the 8. of the sixth): &amp; by reason also that as the first is to th third so is the square of the first to the square of the second (by the corollary of the 20. of the sixth). Wherfore the square of the line BA, is sesquialter to the square of the line AD. But the line BA is equal to the diameter of the sphere geuē, namely, to the line KL, as hath bene proued, &amp; the line AD is equal to the side of the pyramis inscribed in the sphere. Wherfore ye diameter of the sphere is in power sesquialter to the side of the pyramis. Wherfore there is made a pyramis comprehended in a sphere geuen, and the diameter of the sphere is sesquialtera to the side of the pyramis: which was required to be done and proued.
               
                  ¶An other demonstration to proue that as the line AB is to the line BC, so is the square of the line AD to the square of the line DC.
                  Let the description of the semicircle ADB be as in the first description. And vpon the line AC describe (by the 46. of the first) a square EC, and make perfecte the parallelogrāme FB. Now forasmuch as the triangle DAB is equiangle to the triangle DAC (by the 32. of the sixt: therfore as the line BA is to the line

AD, so is the line DA to the line AC, by the 4. of the sixt. Wherefore that which is contained vnder the lines BA and AC, is equall to the square of the line AD, by the 17. of the sixt. And for that as the line AB is to the line BC, so is the parallelogramme EB to the parallelogramme FB, by the 1. of the sixt: and the parallelogramme EB is that which is contained vnder the lines BA and AC (for the line EA is equall to the line AC): and the parallelogramme BF is that which is contained vnder the lines AC and BC. Wherefore as the line AB is to the line BC, so is that which is contained vnder the lines BA and

AC, to that which is contained vnder the lines AC and CB. But that which is contained vnder the lines BA and AC, is equall to the square of the line AD, by the Corollary of the 8. of the sixt, and that which is contained vnder the lines AC and CB, is equall to the square of the line CD, for the perpendicular line DC is the meane proportionall betwene the segmentes of the base, namely, AC and CB, by the former Corollary of the 8. of the sixt, for that the angle ADB is a right angle. Wherefore as the line AB is to the line BC, so is the square of the line AD to the square of the line DC, by the 11. of the fift: which was required to be proued.

                     Suppose that vpon the line AB be erected perpendicularly the line DC, which line DC let be the meane proportionall betwene the partes of the line AB, namely, AC &amp; CB: so that as the line AC is to the line CD, so let the line CD be to the line CB. And vpon the line AB describe a semicircle. Thē I say, that the circumference of that semicircle shall passe by the point D, which is the end of the perpē

line CD, or it shall passe aboue it, and include it not touching it. First let it cut it in the point E. And drawe these right lines EB and EA.

                        C, as the line EC is to the line CB. But by the 8. of the fift, the proportion of the line AC to the line EC, is greater then the proportion of the same line AC to the line CD (for the line CE is lesse then the line CD). Now for that the line CE is to th

                         line CB, as the line AC is to the line CE, and the line CD is to the line CB, as the line AC is to the line CD, therefore by the 13. of the fift, the proportion of the line EC to the line CB, is greater then the proportion of the line CD to the line CB. Wherefore by the 10. of the fift, the line EC is greater then the line DC, namely, the part greater then the whole: which is impossible. Wherefore the circumference shall not cut the line CD. Now I say, that it shall not passe aboue the line CD, and not touch it in the point D. For if it be possible, let it passe aboue it, and extend the line CD to the circūference, and let it cut it in the point

But (by the 21. of the first) the angle AEC is greater then the angle ABC: which is impossible, by the 10. common sentence. Wherefore the circumferēce of the semicircle passeth not vnder the angle B. Now I say, that it passeth not aboue the angle B. For if it be possible, let it passe aboue the point B, and let the circumference be AFC: and produce the perpendicular line BD till it cut the circumference AFC in the point F

                         right angle, and is, by the 21. of the first, greater then the right angle AFC: which againe by the foresayd common sentence, is impossible. Wherfore a semicircle described vpon the base AC, passeth neither vnder the point

                     First Corollary.
                     
                        The diameter of the Sphere is in power quadruple sesquialtera to the line which is drawen from the centre to the circumference of the circle which containeth the base of the pyramis.
                     
                     For forasmuch as it hath bene proued, that the diameter KL is in power sesquialter to the side EF: and it is proued also, by the 12. of this booke, that the side EF is in power triple to the line EH (which is drawen from the centre of the circle contayning the triangle EFG). But the proportion of the extremes, namely, of the diameter to the line EH, consisteth of the proportions of the meanes, namely, of the proportion of the diameter to the line EF, and of the proportion of the line EF to the line EH, by the 5. definition of the sixt: which proportions, namely, triple, and sesquialter, added together, make quadruple sesquialter (as it is easie to proue by that which was taught in the declaration of the 5. definition of the sixt booke). Wherefore the Corollary is manifest.
                  
                  
                     ¶ Second Corollary.
                     
                        Onely the line which is drawen from the angle of the pyramis to the base opposite vnto it,
                        
                           This Corollary is the 15. proposition of the 14. booke after Campane.
                         
                        &amp; passing by the center of the Sphere, is perpendicular to the base, and falleth vpon the centre of the circle which containeth the base.
                     
                     For if any other line (then the line KMH which is drawen by the centre of the Sphere to the centre of the circle) should fall perpendicularly vpon the plaine of the base, then, from one and the selfe same point should be drawen to one and the selfe same plaine two perpendicular lines, contrary to the 13. of the eleuenth: which is impossible. Farther if from the toppe K should be drawen to the center of the base, namely, to the point H, any other right line not passing by the centre M, two right liues shoulde include a superficies contrary to the last common sentence: which were absurde. Wherefore onely the line which is drawen by the center of the Sphere to the centre of the base, is perpendicular to the sayd base. And the line which is drawen from the angle perpendicularly to the base, shall passe by the centre of the Sphere.
                  
                  
                     Third Corollary.
                     
                        The perpendicular line which is drawen from the centre of the Sphere to the base of the pyramis,
                        
                           This Corollary Campane putteth as a Corollary after the 17. proposition of the 14. booke.
                         
                        is equall to the sixt part of the diameter of the Sphere.
                     
                     For it is before proued, that the line MH (which is drawen from the centre of the Sphere to the centre of the base) is equall to the line NC: which line NC is the sixt part of the diameter AB, and therfore the line MH is the sixt part of the diameter of the Sphere. For the diameter AB is equall to the diameter of the Sphere, as hath also before bene proued.

And draw a right line from the point D to the point B. And describe a square EFGH hauing euery one of his sides equall to the line BD.

And (by the 12. of the eleuenth) from the point K (namely, the point where the lines FH and EG cut the one the other) rayse vp to the playne superficies, wherein the square EFGH is, a perpendicular line KL, and extend the line KL on the other side of the playne superficies to the point M.

                     efore ech is a right angle. EKH is a right angle, therefore the square of HE is double to the square of EK, by the 47. of the first: Agayne forasmuch as the line LK is equall to the line KE by position, and the angle LKE is, by the second diffinition of the eleuenth, a right angle: therefore the square of the line EL is double to the square of the line EK: and it is proued that the square of the line HE is double to the square of the line EK. Wherefore the square of the line LE is equall to the square of the line EH. Wherefore also the line LE is equall to the line EH. And by the same reason the line LH is also equall to the line HE. Wherefore the triangle LHE is equilater. In like sort may we proue that euery one of the rest of the triangles whose bases are the sides of the square EFGH, and toppes the pointes L and M, are equilater. The sayd eight triangles also are equall the one to the other, for euery side of eche is equall to the side of the square EFGH. Wherfore there is made an octohedron cōtained vnder eight triangles whose sides are equall. Now it is required to comprehend it in the sphere geuen, and to proue that the diameter of the sphere is in power double to the side of the octohedron.
               
                  Second part of the demōstratiō.Forasmuch as these three lines LK, KM, and KE are equall the one to the other, therfore a semicircle described vpon the line LM shall passe also by the point E. And by the same reason, if the semicircle be turned round about, vntill it returne vnto the selfe same place from whence first it began to be moued, it shal passe by the pointes F, G, H, and the octohedron shall be comprehended in a sphere. I say also that it is comprehended in the sphere geuen. For forasmuch as the line LK is equal to the line KM, by position, and the line KE is common to them both and they contayne right angles by the 3. diffinition of the eleuenth, therefore (by the 4. of the first) the base LE is equall to the base EM. And forasmuch as the angle LEM is a right angle, by the 31. of the third, for it is in a semicircle, as hath bene proued, therefore the square of the line LM is double to the square of the line LE by the 47. of the first. Againe forasmuch as the line AC is equall to the line BC, therefore the line AB is double to the line BC, by the di

                  finition of a circle. But as the line AB is to the line BC, so is the square of the

line AB to the square of the line BD, by the corollaries of the 8. and 
                     •
                  0. of the sixt. Wherefore the square of the line AB is double to the square of the line BD. And it is proued that the square of the line LM is double to the square of the line LE. Wherefore the square of the line BD is equall to the square of the line LE. For the line EH which is equall to the line LF, is put to be equall to the line DB. Wherefore the square of the line AB is equall to the square of the line LM. Wherefore the line AB is equall to the line LM. And the line AB is the diameter of the sphere geuē, wherefore the line LM is equall to the diameter of the sphere geuen. Wherefore the octoedron is contayned in the sphere geuen: For the square of the line AB, which is proued equall to the square of the line LM, is double to the square of the line BD which is also equall to the square of the line LE. and it is also proued that the diameter of the sphere is in power double to the side of the octohedron. Wherefore there is made an octohedron, and it is comprehended in the sphere geuen, wherein was comprehended the Pyramis: and it is proued that the diameter of the sphere is in power double to the side of the octohedrn: which was required to be doone, and to be proued.

                  F. But the line EF is equall to the line EK. Wherefore the square of the line EG is double to the square of the line EK. Wherfore the squares of EG and EK that is the square of the line GK, by the 47. of the first, are treble to the square of the line EK. And forasmuch as the line AB is treble to the line BC, but as the line AB is to the line BC, so is the square of the line AB to the square of the line BD, by the corollaries of the 8. and 20. of the sixt.

And from the point G raise vp vnto the line AB a perpendicular line DG, by the 11. of the first. And draw these right lines DA, DC, and DB. And vnto the right line DB put an equall right line ZI:

and vpon the line ZI describe a square EZIT. And frō the pointes E, Z, I, T, erecte vnto the superficies EZIT perpendicular lines EK, ZH, IM, TN (by the 12. of the eleuenth): and put euery one of those perpendicular lines equall to the line ZI. And drawe these right lines KH, HM, MN, and NK, ech of which shall be equall and parallels to the line ZI, and to the rest of the lines of the square, by the 33. of the first. And moreouer they shall containe equall angles (by the 10. of the eleuenth): and therefore the angles are right angles, for that EZIT is a square: wherfore the rest of the bases shall be squares. Wherfore the solide EZITKHMN being cōtained vnder 6. equall squares, is a cube, by the 21. definition of the eleuenth. Extend by the opposite sides KE and MI of the cube, a plaine KEIM: and againe by the other opposite sides NT and HZ, extend an other plaine HZTN. Now forasmuch as ech of these plaines deuide the solide into two equall partes, namely, into two Prismes equall and like (by the 8. definition of the eleuenth): therfore those plaines shall cut the cube by the centre, by the Corollary of the 39. of the eleuenth. Wherefore the cōmon section of those plaines shall passe by the centre. Let that common section be the line LF. And forasmuch as the sides HN and KM of the superficieces KEIM and HZTN do diuide the one the other into two equall partes, by the Corollary of the 34. of the first, and so likewise do the sides ZT and EI: therefore the common section LF is drawen by these sections, and diuideth the plaines KEIM and HZTN into two equall partes, by the first of the sixt: for their b

                      therefore the square of the line KI is equall to the squares of the lines EI and EK, but the square of the line EI is double to the square of the line EK (for it is double to the square of the line ZI, as hath bene proued, and the bases of the cube are equall squares). Wherefore the square of the line KI is triple to the square of the line KE, that is, to the square of the line ZI. But the right line ZI is equall to th

solides were contained, the diameter of which Sphere is the line AB. And the diameter KI or AB of the same Sphere, is proued to be in power triple to the side of the cube, namely, to the line DB, or ZI.

                     First Corollary.
                     
                        Hereby it is manifest, that the diameter of a Sphere containeth in power the sides both of a pyramis and of a cube inscribed in it.
                     
                     For the power of the side of the pyramis is two thirdes of the power of the diameter (by the 13. of this booke). And the power of the side of the cube is, by this Proposition, one third of the power of the sayd diameter. Wherefore the diameter of the Sphere contayneth in power the sides of the pyramis and of the cube..
                  
                  
                     ¶ Second Corollary.
                     
                        All the diameters of a cube cut the one the other into two equall partes in the centre of the sphere which containeth the cube. And moreouer those diameters do in the selfe same point cut into two equall partes the right lines which ioyne together the centres of the opposite bases.
                     
                     As it is manifest to see by the right line LOF. For the angles LKO, and FIO, are equall, by the 29. of the first: and it is proued, that they are contained vnder equall sides: Wherefore (by the 4. of the first) the bases LO and FO are equall. In like sort may be proued, that the rest of the right lines which ioyne together the centres of the opposite bases do cut the one the other into two equall partes in the centre O.
                  
               
            
            
               ¶ The 4. Probleme. The 16. Proposition. To make an Icosahedron, and to comprehend it in the Sphere geuen, wherin were contained the former solides, and to proue that the side of the Icosahedron is an irrationall line of that kinde which is called a lesse line.
               
                  First part of the construction.TAke the diameter of the Sphere, namely, the line AB: and deuide it in the point C, so that let the line AC be quadruple to the line CB, by the 9. of the sixt. And describe vpō the line AB a semicircle ADB. And (by the 11. of the first) from the point Craise vp vnto the line AB a perpendicular line CD. And draw a right line from the point D to the point B. And describe a circle EFGHK whose line from the centre (which let be the point Z) to the circumference, let be equall to the line DB. And in the circle EFGHK describe (by the 11. of the fourth) an equilater and equiangle Pentagon 
                     •
                  igure EFGHK. And deuide the circumferences EF, FG, GH, HK, and KE, into two equall partes in the pointes L, M, N, X, O. Draw also these right lines LM, MN, NX, XO, and OL: and moreouer these lines OE, EL, LF, FM, MG, GN, NH, HX, XK, and FO, and they shall be the sides of an equilater decagon inscribed in the circle EFGHK, by the 29. of the third. Wherefore the figure LMNXO is an equilater pentagon, by the 29. of the third, and the right line EO is the side of a decagon 
                     •
                  r ten angled figure. Raise vp (by the 1
                     •
                  . of the eleuenth) from the pointes E, F, G, H, K, and the centre Z, vnto the plaine superficies of the circle, perpendicular lines EP, FR, GS, HT, KV, and ZW, and let ech of them be put equall to the line drawen from the centre of the circle EFGHK, to the circumference, namely, to the line ZE. Wherefore right lines drawen from W to P, from W to V, from W to T, from W to S, from W to R, shall be equall and parallels to right lines drawen from Z to E, from Z to K, from Z to H, from Z to G, and from Z to F, by the 6. and 7. of the eleuenth, and 33. of the first. Wherefore the plaine superficieces EFGHK, and PRSTV, which are extended by those parallel lines, are parallel

superficieces, by the 15. of the eleuenth. Wherefore making the centre the point W, and the space WP, or WV, describe a circle, and it shall passe, by the pointes T, S, F, and shall be equall to the circle EFGHK. For the semidiameters of eche are equall. And drawe these right lines PR, RS, ST, TV, VP, and they shall make a pentagon, whose sides shall be equall to the sides of the Pentagon OLMNX, by the 29. of the first. For ech of them doth subtend two sides of the decagon, or

the fift part of equall circles. From the vpper pointes P, R, S, T, V, draw these lines PO, PL, RL, RM, SM, SN, TN, TX, VX, VO: which shall subtend right angles cōtained vnder the sides of the decagon ELFMGNHXKO, and the perpendicular lines PE, RF, SG, TH, VK.
               Now forasmuch as the perpendicular lines PE, RF, SG, TH, and VK,First part of the demonstration. are put equall to the line ZE drawen from the centre, therefore they are equall to the side of an equilater hexagon inscribed in the same circle (by the Corollary of the 15. of the fourth). Wherefore the right lines PO, PL, VO, and VX (which subtend the right angles contained vnder those perpendicular lines and the sides of the decagon) containe them in power, by the 47. of the first. But the side of a pentagon (namely, the side LO or PV) containeth in power the sides of an hexagon and of a decagon inscribed in one and the selfe same circle, by the 10. of

this booke. Wherefore the subtending lines PO, PL, VO, VX, TX, TN, SN, SM, RM, RL, containe in power the selfe same square that the sides of the pentagon OLMNX containe, or that the sides of the pentagon PRSTV containe: and therefore those subtending lines are equall to the sides of the foresaid pentagons. Wherefore the triangles contained of those subtending lines and of the sides of the pentagons, and which are ten in number, namely, PLO, OVP, VOX, VXT, TXN, TNS, SNM, SMR, RML, and RLP, are equilater. Againe produce the right line ZW on either side to the points Q &amp; Y and vnto the side of the decagon, namely, to the line OE, put the lines ZY and WQ equal. And forasmuch as the right line QY is erected

perpendicularly to the plaine superficies OLMNX, therefore it is also erected perpendicularly to the other plaine superficies PRSTV,Second part of the cōstruction. by the Corollay of the 14. of the eleuēth. And drawe these right lines QP, QV, QT, QS, &amp; QR: and these lines also YL, YM, YN, YX, and YO.
               
                  Second part of the demōstratiō.Now forasmuch as the lines QP, QV, QT, QS, and QR do eche subtend right angles contayned vnder the sides of an equilater hexagon &amp; of an equilater decagon inscribed in the circle PRSTV or in the circle EFGHK (which two circles are equall) therfore the sayd lines are eche equal to the side of the pentagon inscribed in the foresayd circle by the 10.

of this booke, and are equall the one to the other, by the 4. of the first, (for all the angles at the poynt W which they subtend are right angles). Wherefore the fiue triangles QPV, QPR, QRS, QST, and QTV, which are contayned vnder the sayd lines QV, QP, QR, QS, QT, and vnder the sides of the pentagon VPRST, are equilater, and equal to the ten former triangles. And by the same reason the fiue triangles opposite vnto them, namely, the triangles YML, YMN, YNX, YXO, and YOL, are equilater and equal to the said ten triangles. For the lines YL, YM, YN, YX, and YO do subtend right angles cōtayned vnder the sides. of an equilater hexagon and of an equilater decagō inscribed in the circle EFGHK, which is equall to the circle PRSTV. Wherefore there is described a solide contayned vnder 20. equilater triangles. Wherefore by the last diffinition of the eleuenth there is described an Icosahedron.
               Now it is required to comprehend it in the sphere geuen, and to proue that the side of the Icosahedron is an irrationall line of that kinde which is called a lesse line. Forasmuch as the line ZW is the side of an hexagon, &amp; the line WQ is the side of a decagon, therfore the line ZQ is diuided by an extreme and meane proportion in the point W, and his greater segmēt is ZW (by the 9. of the thirtēth). Wherfore as the line QZ is to the line ZW, so is the line ZW to the line WQ. But the ZW is equall to the line ZL by construction, and the line WQ to the line ZY by construction also: Wherefore as the line QZ is to the line ZL, so is the line ZL to the line ZY, and the angles QZL
                     •
                   and LZY are right angles (by the 2. diffinition of the eleuenth): If therfore we draw a right line from the poynt L to the poynt Q, the angle YLQ shalbe a right angle, by reasō of the likenes of the triangles YLQ and ZLQ (by the 8. of the sixth). Wherfore a semicircle described vpō the line QY, shal passe also by the point L (by the assumpts added by Campane after the 13. of this booke). And by the same reasō also, for that as the line QZ is the line ZW, so is the line ZW to the line WQ, 
                     For the line QW, is equall to the line IZ, &amp; the line ZW, is commō to them both.
                     This part is againe afterward demonstrated by Flussas.
                   but the line ZQ is equall to the line YW, and the line ZW to the line PW: wherefore as the line YW is to the line WP, so is the line PW to the line WQ. And therefore agayne if we draw a right line from the poynt P to the point Y, the angle YPQ shalbe a right angle. Wherfore a semicircle described vpon the line QY shal passe also by the point P, by the former assumpts: &amp; if the diameter QY abiding fixed the semicircle be turned round about, vntil it come to the selfe same place from whence it began first to be moued, it shall passe both by the point P, and also by the rest of the pointes of the angles of the Icosahedron, and the Icosahedron shalbe comprehended in a sphere. I say also that it is contayned in the sphere geuen.
               Diuide (by the 10. of the first) the line ZW into two equall parts in the point a. And forasmuch as the right line ZQ is diuided by an extreme and meane proportion in the point W, and his lesse segment is QW, therefore the segment QW hauing added vnto it the halfe of the greater segment, namely, the line Wa, is (by the 3. of this booke) in power quintuple to the square made of the halfe of the greater segment: wherefore the square of the line Qa is quintuple to the square of the line 
                     •
                  W. But vnto the square of the Qa, the square of the line QY is quadruple (by the corollary of the 20. of the sixth) for the line QY is double to the line Qa: and by the same reason vnto the square of the WA the square of the line ZW is quadruple: Wherefore the square of the line QY is quintuple to the square of the line ZW (by the 15. of the fiueth). And forasmuch as the line AC, is quadruple to the line CB, therefore the line AB is quintuple to the line CB. But as the line AB is to the line BC, so is the square of the line AB to the square of the line BD (by the 8 of the sixth, and corollary of the 20. of the same). Wherfore the square of the line AB is quintuple to the square of the line BD. And it is is proued that the square of the line QY is quintuple to the square of the line ZW. And the line BD is equall to the line ZW, for either of them is by position equall to the line which is drawen from the centre of the circle EFGHK to the circumference. Wherefore the line AB is equall to the YQ. But the line AB is the diameter of the sphere geuen: Wherefore the line YQ, which is proued to be the diameter of the sphere contayning the Icosahedron,

is equall to the diameter of the sphere geuen. Wherefore the Icosahedron is contayned in the sphere geuē. Now I say that the side of the Icosahedron is an irrationall line of that kinde which is called a lesse line. For forasmuch as the diameter of the sphere is rational, and is in power quintuple to the square of the line drawen frō the centre of the circle OLMNX: wherefore also the line which is drawen from the centre of the circle OLMNX is rationall: wherefore the diameter also being cōmensurable to the same line (by the 6. of the tenth) is rationall. But if in a circle hauing a rationall line to his diameter be described an equilater pentagon, the side of the pentagon is (by the 11. of this booke) an irrationall line, of that kinde which is called a lesse line. But the side of the pentagon OLMNX is also the side of the Icosahedron described, as hath before ben proued. Wherfore the side of the Icosahedrō is an irrationall line of that kinde which is called a lesse line. Wherefore there is described an Icosahedron and it is contayned in the sphere geuen, and it is proued that the side of the', Icosahedron is an irrationall line of that kind which is called a lesse line. Which was required to be done, and to be proued.
               
                  A Corollary.
                  
                     Hereby it is manifest that the diameter of the sphere, is in power quintuple to the line which is drawen from the centre of the circle to the circumference, on which the Icosahedron is described. And that the diameter of the sphere: is composed of the side of an hexagon, and of two sides of a decagon described in one and the selfe same circle.
                  
                  
                     Flussas proueth the Icosahedron described, to be cōtayned in a sphere, by drawing right lines from the poynt, a, to the poyntes P and G after this maner.
                  Forasmuch as the lines ZW, WP are put equal to the line drawen from the centre to the circumference
                        •
                      and the line drawen from the centre to the circumference is double to the line aW, by construction: therefore the line WP is also double to the same line aW. Wherefore the square of the line WP is quadruple to the square of the line aW (by the corollary of the 20. of the sixth). And those lines PW and Wa contayning a right angle PWa (as hath before bene proued) are subtended of the right line aP. Wherefore (by the 47. of the first) the line aP contayneth in power the lines PW, and Wa. Wherefore the right line aP is in power quintuple to the line Wa. Wherefore the right lines aP, and aQ being quintuple to one and the same line Wa, are (by the 9. of the flueth) equall. In like sorte also may we proue that vnto those lines aP and aQ, are equall the rest of the lines drawen from the poynt a to the rest of the angles R, S, T, V. For they subtend right angles contayned of the line Wa, and of the lines drawen from the centre to the circumference. And forasmuch as vnto the line Wa is equall the line Va, which is likewise erected perpendicularly vnto the other plaine superficies OLMNX: therefore lines drawen from the point a to the angles O, L, M, N, X, and subtending right angles at the point Z contayned vnder lines drawen frō the centre to the circumference, and vnder the line aZ, are equal not onely the one to the other, but also to the lines, drawen frō the sayde poynt a, to the former angles at the poynts, P, R, S, T, V
                        •
                     . For the lines drawen frō the centre to the circumference of ech circle are equall, &amp; the line aW is equall to the line aZ. But the line aP is proued equal to the line aQ, which is the halfe of the whole QY. Therefore the residue aY is equall to the foresayd lines aP, aQ &amp;c. Wherefore making the centre the poynt a, and the space one of those lines aQ, aP, &amp;c. extende the superficies of a sphere, &amp; it shal touch the 12. angles of the Icosahedron, which are at the pointes O, L, M. N, X, P, K, S, T, V, Q, Y: which sphere is described, if vpō the diameter QY, be drawen a semicircle, and the sayd semicircle be moued about, till it returne vnto the same place from whense it began first to be moued.
               
               
                  ¶ A Corollary added by Flussas.
                  
                  The opposite sides of an Icosahedron are parallels. For the diameters of the sphere do fall vpon the opposite angles of the Icosahedron: as it was manifest by the right line QY. If therefore there be imagined to be drawen the two diameters PN, and OM they shall concurre in the point F: wherefore the right lines which ioyne them together, PV, and LN, are in one and the selfe same playne superficies, by

the 2. of the eleuenth. And forasmuch as the alternate angles at the endes of the diameters are equall (by the 8. of the first): for the triangles contayned vnder equall semidiamete
                        •
                     s and the side of the Icosahedron are equiangle: therefore (by the 28. of the first) the lines PV and LN are paralles.

               TAke two playne superficieces or bases of the foresayde cube,First part of the construction. which let be the two squares ABCD and CBEF, cutting the one the other in the line BC perpendicularly according to the nature of a cube. And (by the 10. of the first) diuide euery one of the lines AB, BC, CD, DA, EF, EB, and FC into two equall partes in the poyntes G, H, K, L, M, N, X. And drawe these right lines GK and HL, cutting the one the other in the point P, and likewise draw the right lines MH and NX cutting the one the other in the poynt O. And diuide euery one of these right lines NO, OX, HP, and LP, by an extreme and meane proportion in the

And (by the 12. of the eleuenth) frō the poynts R, O, S, rayse vp to the outward part of the playne superficies EBCF of the foresayd cube, perpendicular lines RV, &amp; OYSZ: and let eche of those perpēdicular lines be equall to one of these lines RO, OS or TP, which perpendiculars shalbe parallels (by the 6. of the eleuenth), and likewise from the pointes T, P, ct, rayse vp vnto the outward part of the playne superficies ABCD of the sayd cube, these perpendicular lines TW, Pst, and ctl, eche of which perpendicular lines put equall also to the line OS, or OR or TP

                   and the sayd perpendiculars shalbe parallels (by the foresayd 6. of the eleuenth)

                      proued equilater. Now I say that the pentagon figure VBWCZ is equilater and in one and the self

                     •
                  B. And forasmuch as the right line NO is diuided by an extreme and meane proportion in the poynt R, and his greater segment is the line RO, therefore the square of the lines NO and NR are treble to the square of the line RO (by the 4. of this booke). But the line ON is equall to the line NB, and the line OR to the line RV. Wherefore the squares of the lines BN and RN are treble to the square of the line RV. But vnto the squares of the lines BN and NR is equall the square of the line BR (by the 47. of the first). Wherefore the square of the line BR is treble to the square of the line RV. Wherefore the squares of the lines BR and RV are quadruple to the square of the line RV. But vnto the squares of the lines BR and RV is equall the square of the line

BV (by the 47. of the first): for the angle BRV is a right angle (by the 2. diffinition of the eleuenth). Wherefore the square of the line BV is quadruple to the square of the line VR. Wherefore the line BV is double to the line RV (by the Corollary of the 20. of the sixth). And the line ZV is also double to the line RV (forThe lin

                     ficies with them, by the 7. of the eleuenth. that the line SR is double to the line OR, that is, to the line RV which is equall to the line OS). Wherfore the line BV is equall to the line VZ. And forasmuch as the two lines BN

and NR are equall to the two lines BH and HT, namely, the wholes and the lesse segmēts, and they comprehend right angles, namely, of the squares, BO, and BP, therefore (by the 4. of the first) the bases BR and BT are equall. And forasmuch as the lines BR, and BT are equall, and the two lines RV, and TW are also by construction equall, and the angles BRV, and BTW are by supposition right angles: therefore againe (by the 4. of the first) the bases BV and BW are equall: but the line BV, is proued equall to the line VZ. Wherfore the line BW is also equall to the line VZ. In like sort also may we proue that either of these lines WC, CZ is equal to the same line VZ. Wherefore the pentagon figure BVZCW is equilater.
               
                  The pentagon VBWCR, proued to be in one and the selfe same playne superficies.Now I say that it is in one and the self same playne super
                     •
                  icies. Forasmuch as the line ZV is a parallell to the line SR (as was before proued) but vnto the same line SR, is the line CB a parallell (by the 28. of the first). Wherfore (by the 9. of the eleuenth) the line VZ is a parallell to the line CB. Wherefore, by the seuēth of the eleuenth, the right lines which ioyne thē together are in the selfe same playne wherein are the parallell lines. Wherefore the Trapesium BVZC is in one playne. And the triangle BWC is in one playne (by the 2. of the eleuenth). Now to proue that the Trapesium BVZC &amp; the triangle BWC are in one and the self same plaine, we must proue that the right lines YH, and HW are made directly one right line: which thing is thus proued. Forasmuch as the line HP is diuided by an extreme and meane proportion in the point T, and his greater segment is the line PT, therefore as the line HP is to the line PT, so is the line PT to the line TH. But the line HP is equall to the line HO, and the line PT to either of these lines TW and OY. Wherefore as the line HO is to the line OY, so is the line WT to the line TH. But the lines HO and TW being sides of like proportion are parallels (by the 6. of the eleuenth): (For either of them is erected perpendicularly to the plaine superficies BD)
                     •
                   and the lines TH and OY are parallels, which are also sides of like proportion, by the same 6. of the eleuenth, (For either of them is also erected perpendicularly to the playne superficies BF.) But when there are two triangles, hauing two sides proportionall to two sides, so set vpon one angle, that their sides of like proportiō are also parallels (as the triangles YOH and HTW are)
                     •
                   whose two sides, OH &amp; HT, being in the two bases of the cube making an angle at the point H, the sides remayning of those triangles shal (by the 32. of the sixth) be in one right line. Wherfore the lines YH &amp; HW make both one right line. But euery right line is (by the 3. of the eleuenth) in one &amp; the self same plaine superficies. Wherefore if ye draw a right line from B to Y, there shalbe made a triangle BWY, which shalbe in one and the selfe same plaine (by the 2. of the eleuenth). And therefore the whole

pentagon figure VBWCZ is in one and the selfe same playne superficies.
               Now also I say that it is equiangle.The pentagon VBWCZ, it proued equiangle. For forasmuch as the right line NO is diuided by an extreame and meane proportion in the point R, and his greater segment is OR, therefore as both the lines NO and OR added together is to the line ON, so (by the 5. of this booke) is the line ON to the line OR. But the line OR is equall to the line OS. Wherefore as the line SN is to the line NO, so is the line NO to the line OS. Wherfore the line SN is diuided by an extreme and meane proportion in the point O, and his greater segment is the line NO. Wherefore the squares of the lines NS and SO are treble to the square of the line NO (by the 4. of this booke). But the line NO is equall to the NB, and the line SO to the line SZ: wherfore the squares of the lines NS and ZS are treble to the square of the line NB: wherfore the squares of the lines ZS, SN and NB, are quadruple to the square of the line NB. But vnto the squares of the lines SN &amp; NB (by the 47. of the first) is equal the square of the line SB: wherefore the squares of the lines BS and SZ, that is, the square of the line BZ, by the 47. of the first, (for the angle ZSB is a right angle by positiō) is quadruple to the square of the line NB. Wherfore the line BZ is double to the line BN (by the Corollary of the 20. of the sixth). But the line BC is also double to the line BN. Wherefore the line BZ is equall to the line BC. Now forasmuch as these two lines BV and VZ are equall to these two lines BW and WC, and the base BZ is equall to the base BC, therefore (by the 8. of the first) the angle BVZ is equall to the angle BWC. And in like sort (by the 8. of the first) may we proue that the angle VZC is equall to the angle BWC (prouing first that the lines CB and CV are equal: which are proued equal by this, that the line NS is equal to the line XR, and therfore the line CR is equal to the line BS, by the 47. of the first: wherfore also by the same ye line CV is equal to the line BZ, that is, to the line BC (for the lines BC &amp; BZ are proued equal.) Wherefore the three angles BWC, BVZ, and VZC are equall the one to the other. But if in an equilater pentagon figure there be thre angles equall the one to the other, the pentagon is (by the 7. of the thirtēth) equiangle: wherfore the pentagon BVZCW is equiangle. And it is also proued that it is equilater. Wherfore the pentagon BVZCW is both equilater &amp; equiangle. And it is made vpon one of the sides of the cube, namely, vpon BC. Looke for a farther construction after Flussas at the ende of the demonstration. If therefore vpon euery one of the twelve sides of the cube be vsed the like construction, there shal then be made a dodecahedron contayned vnder twelue pentagons equilater and equiangle.
               Now it is required to comprehend it in the sphere geuen, and to proue that the side of the dodecahedron is an irrationall line of that kinde which is called a residuall line. Extend the line YO, and let the line extended be YQ: now then the line YQ shall light vppon the diameter of the cube, and shall diuide the one the other into two equall parts.That the dodecahedron is contayned in the sphere geuen. For this is manifest to se by the 39. of the eleuenth. (For if by the two lines NX and MH be drawen two playnes perpendicularly to the bases, and cutting the cube, the common section of those playnes shalbe the line YO produced: for their common section is from the poynt O erected perpendicularly to the plaine EBCF, by the 19. of the eleuenth). Let them cut the one the other in the point Q: wherefore Q is the centre of the sphere which comprehendeth the cube, and YQ is the halfe diameter of the sphere by that which was demōstrated in the 15. of this booke: wherefore the right lines drawen from the centre Q to all the angles of the cube shalbe equall. And draw a right line from the point V to the point Q. Now forasmuch as the right line NS i
                     •
                   diuided by an extreme and meane proportion in the point O, and his greater segment is the line NO, as hath before ben proued, therefore the squares of the lines NS and SO are treble to the square of the line NO, by the 4. of this booke. But the line NS is equal to the line YQ (for the line NO is equal to the line OQ as hath before ben proued, &amp; the line YO to the line OS) being both lesse segmentes: but the line OS is equall to the line TV, for the line RO is equall thereunto: wherefore the squares of the lines QY and YV are treble to the square of the line NO. But vnto the squares of the lines QY &amp; YV the square of the line VQ is equall (by the 47. of the first): wherefore the square of the line VQ is treble to the

square of the line NO. But the semidiameter

of the sphere cōprehēding the said cube is in power treble to the half of the side of the cube. For we haue before (in the 15. of this booke) taught how to make a cube, and to comprehende it in a sphere, and haue proued that the diameter of the sphere is in power treble to the side of the cube. Now in what proportiō ye whole is to the whole, in the same is the halfe to the halfe (by the 15. of the fifth). But the line NO is the half of the side of the cube. Wherefore the line VQ is equall to the semidiameter of the sphere cōprehēding the cube. But the point Q is the centre of the sphere cōprehending the cube. Wherefore the point V, which is one of the angles of the dodecahedron, toucheth the superficies of the sphere geuen. In like sort also may we proue, that euery one of the rest of the angles of the dodecahedron toucheth the superficies of the sphere. Wherefore the dodecahedron is comprehended in the sphere geuen.
               Now I say, that the side of the dodecahedron is an irrationall line of that kinde which is called a residuall line.That the side of the dodecahedron is a residuall line. For forasmuch as the line NO is diuided by an extreme and meane proportion in the point R, and his greater segment is the line OR, and the line OX is also diuided by an extreme and meane proportion in the point S, and his greater segment is the line OS. Wherefore the whole line NX is diuided by an extreme and meane proportion, and his greater segment is the line RS. (For for that as the line ON is to the line OR, so is the line OR to the line NR, and in the same proportion also are their doubles (for the partes of equemultiplices haue one and the selfe same proportion with the whole, by the 15. of the fifth). Wherefore as the line NX is to the line RS, so is the line RS to both the lines NR and SX added together. But the line NX is greater then the line RS, by both the lines NR and SX added together. Wherefore the line NX is diuided by an extreme and meane proportion, and his greater segment is the line RS. But the line RS is equall to the line VZ, as hath before bene proued. Wherefore the line NX is diuided by an extreme and meane proportion, and his greater segment is the line VZ. And forasmuch as the diameter of the Sphere is rationall, and is in power treble to the side of the cube, by the 15. of this booke, therefore the line NX, being the side of the cube, is rationall. But if a rationall line be diuided by an extreme and meane proportion, either of the segmentes is (by the 6. of this booke) an irrationall line of that kinde which is called a residuall line. Wherefore the line VZ being the side of the dodecahedron, is an irrational line of that kinde which is called a residuall line. Wherfore there is made a dodecahedron, and it is cōprehended in the Sphere geuen, wherein the other solides were contained, and it is proued that the side of the dodecahedron is a residuall line: which was required to be done, and also to be proued.
               
                  ¶ Corollary.
                  
                     Hereby it is manifest, that the side of a cube being diuided by an extreme

and meane proportion, the greater segment thereof is the side of the dodecahedron. As it was manifest by the line VZ which was proued to be the greater segment of the right line NX, namely, of the side of the cube.

                     Forasmuch as it hath bene proued that the pentagon BVZCW is equilater and equiangle and toucheth one of the sides of the cube.

Draw in the former figure these right lines AI, ID, IL, ctK. Now forasmuch as the line PL was in the point ct diuided like vnto the lines PH, ON. or OX, and vpon the pointes T, P, ct, were erected perpendicular lines equall vnto the line OY, and the rest: namely, vnto the greater segmēt: and the lines T W and ct I were proued parallels, therefore the lines WI and Tct are parallels, by the 7. of the eleuenth, and 33. of the first. Wherefore also, by the 9. of the eleuenth, the lines WI and DC are parallels. Wherefore by the 7. of the eleuenth CWID is a playne superficies. And the triangle AID is a playne superficies, by the 2. of the eleuenth. Now it is manifest that the right lines ID, &amp; IA are equall to the right line WC. For the right lines AL &amp; 
                           •
                        ct (which are equall to the right lines BH, &amp; HT) do make the subtēded lines Act and BT equall by the 4. of the first. And agayne forasmuch as the lines BT and TW contayne a right angle BTW, as also doo the right lines Act and ctI contayne the right angle ActI (for the right lines WT, and Ict are erected perpendicularly vnto one and the selfe same playne ABCD by supposition). And the squares of the lines BT and TW are equall to the squares of the lines Act, and ctI (for it is proued that the line BT is equall to the line Act, and the line TW to the line ctI). And vnto the squares of the lines BT and TW is equall the square of the line BW, by the 47. of the first: likewise by the same vnto the squares of the lines Act and ctI is equall the square of the line AI. Wherefore the square of the line BW is equall to the square of the line AI, wherefore also the line BT is equall to the line AI. And by the same reason are the lines ID and WC equall to the same lines. Now forasmuch as the lines AI and ID, and the lines AL and LD are equall, and the base IL is common to them both, the angles ALI and DLI shalbe equall, by the 8. of the first: and therefore they are right angles, by the 10. diffinition of the first. And by the same reason are the angles WHB, and WHC right angles. And forasmuch as the two lines HT and TW are equall to the two lines Lct and ctI, and they contayne equall angles, that is, right angles by supposition, therefore the angles WHT, and ILct, are equall by the 4. of the first. Wherefore the playne superficies AID is in like sort inclined to the playne superficies ABCD, as the playne superficies BWC is inclined to the same playne ABCD, by the 4. diffinition of the eleuenth. In like sort may we proue that the playne WCDI is in like sort inclined to the playne ABCD, as the playne BVZC is to the playne EBCF. For that in the triangles YOH and ctPK which consist of equall sides (eche to his correspondent side), the angles YHO, and ctKP, which are the angles of the inclination, are equall. And now if the right line ctK be extended to the point a, and the pentagon CWIDa be made perfect, we may, by the same reason, proue that that playne is equiangle and equilater, that we proued the pentagon BVZCW to be equaliter and equiangle. And likewise if the other playnes BWIA and AID be made perfect, they may be proued to be equall and like pentagons and in like sort situate, and they are set vpon these common right lines BW, WC, WI, AI, and ID. And obseruing this methode, there shall vpon euery one of the 12.

                     ¶Second Corollary.
                     
                        In a dodecahedron there are sixe sides euery two of which are parallels and opposite, whose sections into two equall partes, are coupled by three right lines, which in the center of the sphere which contayneth the dodecahedron, deuide into two equall partes and perpendicularly both them selues and also the sides.
                     
                     
                        For vpon the sixe bases of the cube are set sixe sides of the dodecahedron, as it hath bene proued (by the lines ZV, WI &amp;c.) which are cutte into two equall partes by right lines, which ioyne together the centers of the bases of the cube, as the line YO produced, and the other like. Which lines coupling together the centers of the bases are three in number, cutting the one the other perpendicularly (for they are parallels to the sides of the cube) and they cutte the one the other into two equall partes in the center of the sphere which contayneth the cube (by that which was demonstrated in the 15. of this booke). And vnto these equall lines, ioyning together the centers of the bases of the cube, are without the bases added equall partes OY, Pct, and the other like, which by supposition are equall to halfe of the side of the dodecahedron. Wherefore the whole lines, which ioyne together the sectoins of the opposite sides of the dodecahedron, are equall, and they cut those sides into two equall partes and perpendicularly.
                  
                  
                     Third Corollary.
                     
                        A right line ioyning together the poynts of the sections of the opposite sides of the dodecahedron into two equall partes, being diuided by an extreame and meane proportion: the greater segment thereof shalbe the side of the cube, and the lesse segment the side of the dodecahedron contayned in the selfe same sphere.
                     
                     For it was proued that the right line YQ is diuided by an extreame and meane proportion in the poynt O, and that his greater segment OQ is halfe the side of the cube, and his lesse segment OY is halfe of the side VZ (which is the side of the dodecahedron). Wherefore it followeth (by the 15. of the fifth) that their doubles are in the same proportion. Wherefore the double of the line YQ which ioyneth the poynt opposite vnto the line Y, is the whole: and the greater segment is the double of the line OQ which is the side of the cube: &amp; the lesse segment is the double of the line YO, which is equall to the side of the dodecahedron, namely, to the side VZ.

               TAke the diameter of the Sphere geuen, and let the same be AB, and diuide it in the point C, so that let the line AC be equall to CB, by the 10. of the first: and in the point D, so that let AD be double to DB, by the 9. of the sixt. And vpon the line AB describe a semicircle AEB. And from the pointes C and D, raise vp (by the 11. of the first) vnto the line AB perpendicular lines CE and DF. And draw these right lines AF, FB, and BE. Now forasmuch as the line AD is double to the line DB, therefore the line AB is treble to the line DB. Wherefore the line BA is sesquialter to the line AD (for it is as 3. to 2.). But as the line BA is to the line AD, so is the square of the line BA to the square of the line AF (by the 6. of the sixt, or by the Corollary of the same, and by the Corollary of the 20. of the same): for the triangle AFB is equiangle to the triangle AFD. Wherefore the square of the line BA is sesquialter to the square of the line AF. But the diameter of a sphere is in power sesquialter to the sid

                   of the pyramis,The side of a pyramis. by the 13. of this booke, and the line AB is the diameter of the sphere. Wherefore the line AF is equall to the side of the pyramis.
               Againe forasmuch as the line AB is treble to the line BD: but as the line AB is to the line BD, so is the square of the line AB to the square of the line FB, by the Corollaries of the 8. and 20. of the sixt. Where

               And forasmuch as the line AC is equall to the line CB, therefore the line AB is double to the line CB. But as the line AB is to the line CB, so is the square of the line AB to the square of the line BE (by the former Corollaries): Therefore the square of the line AB is double to

the square of the line BE. But the diameter of the sphere is in power double to the side of the octohedron,The side of

                      octohedron. and AB is the diameter of the sphere geuen: wherefore the line BE is the side of the octohedron. Raise vp (by the 11. of the first) from the point A vnto the right line AB a perpendicular line AG. And put the line AG equall to the line AB. And drawe a right line from the point G to the point C. And let the line GC cut the circumference in the point H. And (by the 12. of the first) from the point H drawe vnto the line AB a perpendicular line HK. Now forasmuch as the line GA is double to the line AC (for GA is equall to AB). But as GA is to AC, so is HK to KC (by the 28. of the first, and Corollary of the 2. of the sixt): wherefore the line HK is double to the line KC. Wherefore the square of the line HK is quadruple to the square of the line KC, by the Corollary of the 20. of the sixt. Wherefore the squares of the lines HK and KC, which are all one with the square of the line HC, by the 47. of the first, is quintuple to the square of the line KC. But the line HC is equall to the line CB, by the definition of a circle. Wherfore the square of the line BC is quintuple to the square of the line

CK. And forasmuch as the line AB is double to the line BC, of which the line AD is double to the line DB. Wherfore the residue, namely, BD, is double to the residue, namely, to DC (by the 19. of the fift). VVherefore the line BC is treble to the line CD. Wherefore the square of the line BC is nonecuple to the square of the line CD, by the Corollary of the 20. of the sixt. But the square of BC is onely quintuple to the square of CK. Wherefore the square of CK is greater thē the square of CD, by the 10. of the fift. Wherefore also the line CK is greater then the line DC. Vnto the line CK put (by the 2. of the first) an equall line CL. And from the point L raise vp vnto the line AB a perpendicular line LM. And drawe a right line from the point M to the point B. Now forasmuch as the square of the line CB is quintuple to the square of the line CK, and the line AB is double to the line BC, and the line KL is double to the line CK: therefore the square of the line AB is quintuple to the square of the line KL, by the 15. of the fift. But the diameter of a sphere is in power quintuple to the line which is drawen from the centre of the circle to the circumference on which the Icosahedron is described, by the Corollary of the 16. of the sixt. And the line AB is the diameter of the sphere: wherefore the line KL is the semidiameter of the circle on which the Icosahedron is described. Wherefore the line KL is the side of an hexagon figure described in the same circle, by the Corollary of the 15. of the fourth. And forasmuch as the diameter of the sphere is made of the side an hexagon figure, and of two sides of a decagon being

                   of them described in one and the selfe same circle (by the Corollary of the 16. of this booke): and the line AB is the diameter of the sphere, and the line KL is the side of the hexagon, and the line AK is equall to the line LB: wherefore either of the lines AK and LB is the side of a decagon described in the circle on which the Icosahedron is described (that is, in the circle whose semidiameter is the line KL). And forasmuch as the line LB is the side of a decagon, and the line ML of an hexagon (for ML is equall to KL, for that it is equall to KH, by the 14. of the third, for they are equally

distant from the centre, and ech of the lines HK and KL is double to KC). Wherefore the line M B is the side of a pentagon, by the 10. of this booke. But the side of the pentagon is also the side of the Icosahedron,The side of an Icosahedron. by that which was demonstrated in the 10

                  irst to the square made of the second, by the Corollary of the 20. of the sixt. Wherfore as the line DB is to the line BA, so is the square of the line DB to the square of the line BF. Wherefore (by conuersion, by the Corollary of the 4. of the fiueth) as the line AB is to the line BD, so is the square of the line FB to the square of the line B D. But the line AB is treble to the line BD, as hath before bene proued. Wherefore the square of the line FB is treble to the square of the line BD. But the square of the line AD is quadruple to the square of the line DB, by the Corollary of the 20. of the sixt, for the line AD is double to the line DB. Wherefore the square of the line AD is greater then the square of the line FB, by the 10. of the

                  ift. Wherefore also the line AD is greater then the line FB. Wherefore the line AL is much greater then the line FB. And the line AL being diuided by an extreme &amp; meane proportion, his greater segment is the line KL, by the 9. of this boke: (for the line LK is the side of an hexagon, and the line KA is the side of a decagon inscribed in one and the same circle, as hath before bene proued): and the line FB being diuided

by an extreme and meane proportion, his greater segment is NB. Wherefore the line KL is greater then the line NB. (This Assumpt is afterward proued in the 14. book

                      and 4. proposition. For two lines diuided by an extreme and meane proportion, are euery way like proportionall). But the line KL is equall to the line LM. Wherefore the line LM is greater then the line NB. But the line MB is greater then the line LM. Wherfore the line MB being the side of the Icosahedron, is much greater then the line NB being the side of the Dodecahedron: which was required to be done, and to be proued.

                     monstration to proue that the side of the Icosahedrō is greater then the side of the dodecahedron. Forasmuch as the line AD is double to the line DB, therefore the line AB is treble to the line DB. But as AB is to BD, so is the square of the line AB to the square of the line BF, by the 8. of the sixt (for the triangle FAB is equiangle to the triangle FDB). Wherefore the square of the line AB is treble to the square of the line BF. And it is before proued, that the square of the line AB is quintuple to the square of the line KL. Wherefore fiue squares made of the line KL, are equall to three squares made of the line FB. But three squares made of the line FB, are greater then sixe squares made of the line NB, as is straight way proued. Wherfore fiue squares made of the line KL, are greater then sixe squares made of the line NB. Wherfore also one square made of the line KL, is greater then one square made of the line NB. Wherefore the line KL is greater then the line NB. But the line KL is equall to the line LM. Wherefore the line LM is greater then the line NB. Wherefore the line MB is much greater then the line NB: which was required to be proued.
               But now let vs proue that three squares made of the line FB,That 3. squares of the line FB are greater thē 
                     6. squares of the line NB. are greater then sixe squares made of the line NB. Forasmuch as the line BN is greater then the line NF, for it is the greater segment of the line BF diuided by an extreme and meane proportion, therefore that which is contained vnder the lines BF, and BN, is greater then that which is cōtained vnder the lines BF and FN, by the 1. of the sixt. Wherefore that which is contained vnder the lines BF and BN, together with that which is contained vnder the lines BF and FN, is greater then that which is contained vnder the lines BF and FN twise. But that which is contained vnder the lines BF and FN; together with that which is contained vnder the lines BF and BN, is the square of the line BF, by the 2. of the second, and that which is contained vnder the lines BF and FN once, is equall to the square of NB. For the line FB is diuided by an extreme and meane proportion in the point N: (and (by the 17. of the sixt) that which is contained vnder the extremes, is equall to the square made of the midle line). Wherefore the square of the line FB, is greater then the double of the square of the line BN. Wherefore one of the squares made of the line BF, is greater then two squares made of the line BN. Wherefore also three squares made of the line FB, are greater then sixe squares made of the line BN: which was required to be proued.
               
                  A Corollary.
                  Now also I say that besides the fiue foresayd solides there can not be described any other solide cōprehēded vnder figures equilater &amp; equiangle the one to the other.That there can be no other solide besids these fiue, contayned vnder equilater and equiangle bases. For of two triangles, or of any two other playne superficieces can not be made a solide angle (for, that is cōtrary to the diffinition of a solide angle). Vnder three triangles is contayned the solide angle of a pyramis: vnder fower, the solide angle of an octohedrō: vnder fiue, the solide angle of an Icosahedrō: of sixe, equilater &amp; equiangle triangles set to one point can not be made a solide angle. For forasmuch as the angle of an equilater triangle is two third partes of a right angle, the sixe angles of the solide shalbe equall to fower right angles, which is impossible. For euery solide angle is (by the 21. of the eleuēth) contayned vnder playne angles lesse thē fower right angles. And by the same reason can not be made a solide angle contained vnder more thē sixe playne superficiall angles of equilater triangles. Vnder three squares is contained the angle of a cube. Vnder fower squares it is impossible that a solide angle should be contayned: for then

agayne it should be contayned vnder fower right angles. Wherefore much lesse can any solide angle be contayned vnder more squares then fower. Vnder three equilater and equiangle pentagons is contayned the solide angle of a dodecahedron. But vnder fower it is impossible. For forasmuch as the angle of a pentagon is a right angle and the fift part more of a right angle, the fower angles shalbe greater then fower right angles: which is impossible. And therfore much lesse can a solide angle be composed of more pentagons then fower. Neither can a solide angle be contayned vnder any other equilater and equiangle figures of many angles, for that that also should be absurd. For the more the sides increase, the greater are the angles which they contayne, and therfore the farther of are the superficiall angles contayned of those sides from composing of a solide angle. Wherefore besides the foresayd fiue figures there can not be made any solide figure contayned vnder equall sides and equall angles: which was required to be proued.

Wherfore the rest of the angles after the same maner described in the rest of the bases, being comprehended and subtended of equall sides, shall (by the 8. of the first) be equall the one to the other. And therefore the inclinations of the playnes in the Octohedron, shal (by the 5. diffinition of the eleuenth) be equall.

For they couple together the halfe sids of the dodecahedrō, which halfes are parallels and equall, by the 3. corollary of the 17. of this booke: which coupling lines also are equall, by the same corollary. Wherefore the angles being contayned of equal perpendicular lines, and subtended of equall coupling lines, shall (by the 8. of the first) be equal. And they are the angles of the inclinations.

                  As touching an Icosahedron, it was proued in the 16. of this booke, that the side thereof is a lesse line, when the diameter of the sphere is rationall. And forasmuch as the angle of the inclination of the bases thereof, is contayned of the perpendicular lines of the triangles, and subtended of the right line which subtendeth the angle of the Pentagon which contayneth fiue sides of the Icosahedron: and vnto the perpendicular lines the side is commensurable (namely, is in power sesquitertia vnto them, by the Corollary of the 12. of this booke): therefore the perpendicular lines which contayne the angles are irrationall lines, namely, lesse lines (by the 105. of the tenth booke.) And forasmuch as the diameter contayneth in power both the side of the Icosahedron, and the line which subtendeth the foresayd angle, if from the power of the diameter which is rationall, be taken away the power of the side of the Icosahedron which is irrationall, it is manifest that the residue which is the power of the subtending line shalbe irrationall. For if it shoulde be rationall, the number which measureth the whole power of the diameter, and the part taken away of the subtending line, should also, by the 4. common sentence of

the seuenth measure the residue, namely, the power of the side:

                      which is irrationall for that it is a lesse line, which were absurd. Wherefore it is manifest that the right lines which compose the angle of the inclination of the bases of the Icosahedron are Irrationall lines. For the subtending line hath to the line contayninge, a greater proportion, then the whole hath to the greater segment.
                  The angle of the inclination of the bases of a dodecahedron, is contayned vnder two perpendiculars of the bases of the dodecahedron, and is subtended of that right line, whose greater segment is the side of a Cube inscribed in the dodecahedron, which right line is equall to the line which coupleth the sections, into two equal parts, of the opposite sides of the dodecahedron. And this coupling line we say is an irrationall line, for that the diameter of the sphere contayneth in power both the coupling line, and the side of the dodecahedron: but the side of the dodecahedron is an irrationall line, namely, a residuall line (by the 17. of this booke). Wherefore the residue namely, the coupling line is an irrationall line, as it is 
                        •
                     asy to proue by the 4. cōmon sentence of the seuēth. And that the perpēdicular lines which contayne the angle of the inclination are irrationall, is thus proued.
                  Suppose that there be a Pentagon ABCDE, and draw in it the perpendicular line, AG, and let the line subtending the angle of the pentagon be AC. Now forasmuch as the right line AC is the side of the cube, and CD the side the Dodecahedron inscribed in one and the selfe same sphere, by the 2. Corollary of the 17. of this booke: but the line AC is commensurable to the diameter of the sphere, by the 15. of this booke, and is therefore rationall, by the 6.

diffinitiō of the tenth: &amp; the right line CD which is the side of the dodecahedron is irrationall (by the 17. of this booke). Wherfore the line CG which is the halfe of the line CD is irrationall by the 103. of the 10. boke. And the right line AC contayneth in power the two right lines AG and GC (by the 47. of the first). If therfore from the power of the right line AC being rationall, be takē away the power of the line CG being irrationall, the power remayning, namely, 
                        •
                     he power of the line AG, shall of necessitie be irrationall. For if the power of the line AG taken away should be rationall, and the whole power of the line AC is rationall, the residue, namely, the power of the line CG should be also rationall, and should be measured by the selfe same numbers, by the 4. common sentence of the seuenth. But it is proued that the line CG is irrationall, for it is the halfe of the whole residuall line CD (by the 17. of the thirtenth): which is impossible. Wherefore the perpendicular line AG is irrationall. Wherfore the angle of the inclination of the dodecahedron, which is contayned vnder two perpendicular lines of the pentagon, and is subtended of a right line,
                        The sides of the angle &amp;c. of the dodecahedrō proued irrationall.
                      which coupleth the sections into two equall parts of the opposite sides of the dodecahedron (by the 2. corollary of the 18. of this booke) which line we haue proued to be irrationall (for that it is equall to the two lines AC, and CD by the 4. corollary of the 17. of this booke) is contayned vnder irrationall right lines.
                  By the proportion of the subtending line (of the foresayd angles of inclination) to the lines which containe the angle, is found out the obliquitie of the angle.
                        How to know whether the angle of the inclinatiō be a right angle, an acute angle, or an oblique angle.
                      For if the subtending line be in power double to the line which contayneth the angle, then is the angle a right angle (by the 48. of the first,) But if it be in power lesse then the double it is an acute angle (by the 23. of the second). But if it be in power more then the double, or haue a greater proportion then the whole hath to the greater segmēt
                        •
                      the angle shalbe an obtuse angle (by the 12. of the second and 4. of the thirtenth). By which may be proued that the square of the whole is greater then the double of the square of the greater segment.
                  This is to be noted that that which Flussas hath here taught touching the inclinations of the bases of the

            ¶The fourtenth booke of Euclides Elementes.
            IN this booke, which is commonly accompted the 14. booke of Euclide is more at large intreated of our principal purpose:
                  The argument of the fourtenth booke.
                namely, of the comparison and proportion of the fiue regular bodies (customably called the 5. figures or formes of Pythagoras) the one to the other, and also of their sides together, eche to other: which thinges are of most secret vse, and inestimable pleasure, and commoditie to such as diligently search for them, and attayne vnto them. Which thinges also vndoubtedly for the woorthines and hardnes thereof (for thinges of most price are most hardest) were first searched, and found out of Philosophers, not of the inferior or meane sort, but of the depest and most grounded Philosophers, and best exercised in Geometry. And albeit this booke with the booke following, namely, the 15. booke, hath bene hetherto of all men for the most part, and is also at this day numbred and accompted amōgst Euclides bookes, and supposed to be two of his, namely, the 14. and 15. in order: as all exemplars (not onely new and lately set abroade, but also old monumentes written by hand) doo manifestly witnes: yet it is thought by the best learned in these dayes, that these two bookes are none of Euclides, but of some other author, no lesse worthy, nor of lesse estimation and authoritie, notwithstanding, then Euclide. Apollonius a man of deepe knowledge a great Philosopher and in Geometrie maruelous (whose wōderful bookes writtē of the sections of cones, which exercise &amp; occupy thewittes of the wisest and best learned, are yet remayning) is thought, and that not without iust cause, to be the author of them, or as some thinke Hypsicles him selfe. For what can be more playnely, then that which he him selfe witnesseth in the preface of this booke. Basilides of Tire (sayth Hypsicles) and my father together, scanning, and peysing a writing or books of Apollonius, which was of the comparison of a dodecahedron to an Icosahedron inscribed in one and the selfe same sphere, and what proportion these figures had the one to the other, found that Apollonius had fayled in this matter. But afterward (sayth he) I found an other copy or booke of Apollonius, wherein the demonstration of that matter was full and perfect, and shewed it vnto them, whereat they much reioysed. By which wordes it semeth to be manifest that Apollonius was the first author of this booke, which was afterward set forth by Hypsicles. For so his owne wordes after in the same preface seme to import.
            
               The Preface of Hypsicles before the fourtenth booke.
               FRend Protarchus, whē that Basilides of Tire came into Alexandria, hauing familiar frendship with my father by reason of his knowledge in the mathematicall sciences, he remayned with him a long time, yea euen all the time of the pestilence. And sometime reasoning betwene themselues of that which Apollonius had written touching the comparison of a dodecahedron and of an Icosahedron inscribed in one and the selfe same sphere, what proportion such bodies haue the one to the other, they iudged that Apollonius had somewhat erred therein. Wherefore they (as my father declared vnto me) diligently weighing it, wrote it perfectly. Howbeit afterward I happened to finde an other booke written of Apollonius, which contayned in it the

right demonstration of that which they sought for: which when they saw, they much reioysed. As for that which Apollonius wrote, may be sene of all men, for that it is in 
                     •
                  uery mans hand. And that which was of vs more diligently afterward written agayne, I thought good to send and dedicate vnto you, as to one whome I thought worthy commendation, both for that deepe knowledge which I know you haue in all kindes of learning, and chiefely in Geometrie, so that you are able redily to iudge of those thinges which are spoken, and also for the greate loue and good will which you beare towardes my father and me. Wherfore vouchsafe gently to accept this, which I send vnto you. But now is it time to end our preface, and to begin the matter.
               
                  ¶ The 1. Theoreme. The 1. Proposition. First proposition after Flussas.A perpendicular line drawen from the centre of a circle to the side of a Pentagon described in the same circle: is the halfe of these two lines, namely, of the side of an hexagon figure, and of the side of a decagon figure being both described in the selfe same circle.
                  SVppose that the circle be ABC.Construction. And let the side of an equilater Pentagon described in the circle ABC, be BC. And (by the 1. of the third) take the centre of the circle, and let the same be D. And (by the 12. of the first) from the point D draw vnto the line BC a perpendicular line DE. And extend the right line DE directly to the point F. Then I say, that the line DE (which is drawen from the centre to BC the side of the pentagon) is the halfe of the sides of an hexagon and of a decagon taken together and described in the same circle. Draw these right lines DC and CF. And vnto the line EF put an equall line GE. And draw a right

line from the point G to the point C.Demonstration. Now forasmuch as the circumference of the whole circle is quintuple to the circū
                     ference BFC (which is subtended of the side of the pentagon) and the circumference ACF is the halfe of the circumference of the whole circle, and the circumference CF (which is subtended of the side of the decagon) is the halfe of the circumference BCF: therefore the circumference ACF is quintuple to the circumference CF (by the 15. of the

                     t). Wherefore the circumference AC is qradruple to the circumference FC. But as the circumference AC is to the circumference FC, so is the angle ADC to the angle FDC, by the last of the sixt. Wherefore the angle ADC is quadruple to the angle FDC. But the angle ADC is double to the angle EFC, by the 20. of the third: Wherefore the angle EFC is double to the angle GDC. But the angle EFC is equall to the angle EGC, by the 4. of the first. Wherfore the angle EGC is double to the angle EDC. Wherefore the line DG is equall to the line GC (by the 32. and 6. of the first). But the line GC is equall to the line CF, by the 4. of the first. Wherfore the line DG is equall to the line CF. And the line GE is equall to the line EF (by construction). Wherefore the line DE is equall to the lines EF and FC added together. Vnto the lines EF and FC adde the line DE. Wherefore the lines DF and FC added together, are double to the line DE. But the line DF is equall to the side of the hexagon: and FC to the side of the decagon.

Wherefore the line DE is the halfe of the side of the hexagon, and of the side of the decagon being both added together and described in one and the selfe same circle.
                  It is manifest This is manifest by the 12. propositiō of the thirtenh booke as Campane well gathereth in a Corollary of the same. by the Propositions of the thirtenth booke, that a perpendicular line drawen from the centre of a circle to the side of an equilater triangle described in the same circle; is halfe of the semidiameter of the circle. Wherefore by this Proposition, a perpendicular drawen from the c

                  THis Theoreme is described of Aristeus in that booke whose title is, The comparison of the fiue figures, and is described of Apollonius in his second edition of the cōparison of a Dodecahedron to an Icosahedron, which is, This is afterward proued in the 4. proposition. that as the super

Now must we also proue that one and the selfe same circle comprehendeth both the pentagon of a Dodecahedron, and also the triangle of an Icosahedron described in one and the selfe same sphere, first this being proued:This Assumpt is the 3. proposition after Flussas.
                     
If in a circle be described an equilater pentagon, the squares which are made of the side of the pentagon, and of that right line which is subtended vnder two sides of the pentagon, are quintuple to the square of the semidiameter o

And take (by the 1. of the third) the centre of the circle and let the same be D. And (by the 12. of the first) from the point D draw vnto the line AC a perpendicular line DF. And extend the line DF on either side to the pointes B and E. And draw a right line from the point A to the point B. Now I say, that the squares of the lines BA and AC are quint

                        •
                      line DE:Demonstration of the Assumpt. therefore the square of the line BE is quadruple to the square of DE (by the 20. of the sixt). But vnto the square of the line BE, are equall the squares of the lines BA and AE (by the 47. of the first, for the angle BAE is a right angle, by the 31. of the third). Wherefore the squares of the lines BA and AE, are quadruple to the square of the line DE. Wherfore the squares of the lines AB, AE, and DE, are quintuple to the square of the line DE. But the squares of the lines DE and AE, are equall to the square of the line AC (by the 10. of the thirtenth). Wherefore the squares of the lines BA and AC, are quintuple to the square of the line DE.
                  This being thus proued, now is to be demonstrated that one and the selfe same circle cō
                     prehendeth both the pentagon of a dodecahedron, &amp; the triangle of an Icosahedron described in one &amp; the self same cir

And let one of the pētagons of the dodecahedron be CDEFG, &amp; let one of the triangles of the Icosahedron be KLH. Now I say that the semidiameters of the circles which are described about them are equall,

that is, that one and the selfe same circle contayneth both the pentagon CDEFG, and the triangle KLH. Draw a right line from the point D to the point G. Wherfore the line DG is the side of a cube (by the corollary of the 17. of the thirtēth). Take a certayne right line MN. And let the square of the line AB be quintuple to the square of the line MN, by the assumpt put after the 6. propositiō of the tēth. But the diameter of a sphere is in power quintuple to the square of the semidiameter of the circle, on which is described the Icosahedrō (by the corollary of the 16. of the thirtenth). Wherefore the line MN is the semidiameter of the circle on which is described the Icosahedron. Diuide (by the 30. of the sixth) the line MN by an extreame and meane proportion in the poynt X. And

let the greater segment thereof be MX. Wherefore the line MX is the side of a decagon described in the same circle (by the corollary of the 9. of the thirtenth).Demonstration of the

Wherfore fiue squares of the line CG are equall to thre squares of the line DG and to three squares of the line CG (as it is not hard to proue, marking what hath before bene proued). But three squares of the line DG, together with three squares of the line CG, are equall to fiftene squares of the semidiameter of the circle described about the pentagon CDEFG (for it was before proued in the assumpt put in this proposition) that the square

(For by the 12. of the thirtenth, one square of the line LK is triple to one square of the line drawne from the centre to the circumference). Wherefore fiftene squares of the line drawne from the centre to the circumference (of the circle which contayneth the pentagon CDEFG) are equall to fiftene squares of the line drawne from the centre to the circumference of the circle which contayneth the triangle KLH): wherefore one of the squares which is drawne from the centre to the circumference of the one circle, is equall to one of the squares which is drawne from the centre to the circumference of the other circle. Wherefore the diameter is equall to the diameter, wherefore one and the selfe same circle comprehendeth both the pentagon of a dodecahedron and the triangle of an Icosahedron described in one and the selfe same circle: which was required to be proued.

But two of those triangles takē ten times contayneth the whole Icosahedron. Wherfore that which is contayned vnder the lines DE &amp; BC thirty times, is equall to twenty such triangles as the triangle ABC is, that is, to ye whole superficies of the Icosahedrō.

                     By this it is manifest, that as the superficies of the Dodecahedron is to the superficies of the Icosahedron,A Corollary which also Flussas putteth as a Corollary after the 5. proposition in his order. so is that which is contained vnder the side of the Pentagon, and the perpēdicular line which is drawen from the centre of the circle described about the Pentagon to the same side, to that which is contained vnder the side of the Icosahedron and the perpendicular line which is drawen from the centre of the circle described about the triangle to the same side: so that the Icosahedron and Dodecahedron be both described in one and the selfe same Sphere.

Theoreme of this booke) a circle containing both the pentagon of a Dodecahedron, and the triangle of an Icosahedron, being both described in one and the selfe same sphere, and let the same circle be DBC. And in the circle DBC describe the side of an equilater triangle, namely, CD, and the side of an equilater pentagon, namely, AC. And take (by the 1. of the third) the centre of the circle, and let the same be E. And from the point E drawe vnto the lines DC and AC, perpendicular lines EF and EG.

Forasmuch as the line made of the lines EB and BC added together (namely, of the side of the hexagon, and of the side of a decagon) is (by the 9. of the thirtenth) diuided by an extreme and meane proportion, and his greater segment is the line BE: and the line EG is also (by the 1. of the fo

                         againe is required the Assumpt which is afterward proued in this 4 proposition. Wherefore as the line H is to the line CA, so is the line EG to the line EF. Wherefore (by the 16. of the sixt) that which is contained vnder the lines H and EF, is equall to that which is contained vnder the lines CA and EG. And for that as the line H is to the line CD, so is that which is contained vnder the lines H and EF, to that which is contained vnder the lines CD and EF (by the 1. of the sixt). But vnto that which is contained vnder the lines H and EF, is equall that which is contained vnder the lines CA and EG. Wherefore (by the 11. of the fift) as the line H is to the line CD, so is that which is contained vnder the lines CA and EG, to that which is contained vnder the lines CD and EF, that is (by the Corollary next going before) as the superficies of the Dodecahedron is to the superficies of the Icosahedron, so is the line H to the line CD.

                     LEt there be a circle ABC. And in it describe two sides of an equilater pentagon (by the 11. of the fift) namely, AB and AC: and draw a right line from the point B to the point C. And (by the 1. of the third) take the centre of the circle, and let the same be D. And draw a right line from the point A to the point D, and extend it directly to the point E, and let it cut the line BC in the point G. And let the line DF be halfe to the line DA, and let

the line GC be treble to the line HC, by the 9. of the sixt.The Assumpt, which also Flussas putteth as an Assumpt a

Draw a right line from the point B to the point D. Now forasmuch as the line AD is double to the line DF, therefore the line AF is sesquialter to the line AD.

Againe,Demonstration of the Assumpt. forasmuch as the line GC is treble to the line CH, therefore the line GH is double to the line CH. Wherefore the line GC is sesquialter to the line HG. Wherefore as the line FA is to the line AD, so is the line GC to the line GH. Wherefore (by the 16. of the sixt) that which is contained vnder the lines AF &amp; HG, is equall to that which is contained vnder the lines DA and GC. But the line GC is equall to the line BG (by the 3. of the third). Wherfore that which is contained vnder the lines AD and BG, is equall to that which is contained vnder the lines AF and GH. But that which is contained vnder the lines AD and BG, is equall to two such triangles as the triangle ABD is (by the 41. of the first). Wherefore that which is contained vnder the lines AF and GH, is equall to two such triangles as the triangle ABD is. Wherefore that which is contained vnder the lines AF and GH

And forasmuch as the line GH is double to the line HC, therefore that which is contained vnder the lines AF and GH, is double to that which is contained vnder the lines AF and HC (by the 1. of the sixt). Wherefore that which is contained vnder the lines AF and CH twise, is equall to that which is contained vnder the lines AF and GH once. Take eche of those parallelogrammes fiue times. Wherefore that which is contained vnder the lines AF and HC ten times, is equall to that which is contained vnder the lines AF &amp; GH fiue times, that is, to two pentagons. Wherefore that which is contained vnder the lines AF and HC fiue times, is equall to one pentagon. But that which is contained vnder the lines AF and HC fiue times, is equall (by the 1. of the sixt) to that which is contained vnder the lines AF and HB, for the line HB is quintuple to the line HC (as it is easie to see by the construction) and they are both vnder one &amp; the selfe same altitude, namely, vnder AF. Wherfore that which is contained vnder the lines AF and BH, is equall to one pentagon.
                  
                  
                     This being proued, now let there be drawne a Circle comprehending both the Pentagon of a Dodecahedron, and the triangle of an Icosahedron, being both described in one and the selfe same Sphere.

                        ) and that which

to the triangle ADM: therefore as that which is contained vnder the lines AG and HB is to that which is contained vnder the lines AG and GD, so is the pentagon to the triāgle. But as that which is contained vnder the lines BH &amp; AG is to that which is contained vnder the lines AG and GD, so is the line BH to the line DG (by the .1. of the sixth) wherefore (by the .15. of the fifth) as 12. such lines as BH is, are to .20 such lines as DG is, so are 12. pentagons to 20. triangles, that is the superficies of the Dodecahedron, to the superficies of the Icosahedron. And 12. suche lines as BH is, are equall to tenne suche lines as BC is (for the line HB is quintuple to the line HC): and the line BC is sextuple to the line CH
                           •
                         Wherfore six such lines as BH is, are equal to fiue such lines as BC are: and in the same proportion are their doubles: and 20. such lines as the line DG is, are equal to .10. such lines as the line DM is: for the line DM is double to the line DG. Wherfore as 10. such lines as BC is, are to 10. such lines as DM is, that is, as the line BC is to the line DM, so is the superficies of the Dodecahedron to the superficies of the Icosahedron. But the line BC is the side of the cube, and the line DM the side of the Icosahedron: wherefore (by the 11. of the fifth) as the superficies of the Dodecahedron is to the superficies of the Icosahedron, so is the line BC to the line DM, that is, the side of the cube to the side of the Icosahedron.

And (by the 30. of the sixth) deuide the line BC by an extreme and meane proportion in the point D, and let the greater segment therof be CD. Wherfore the line CD is the side of a Decagō described in the same circle (by the corollary of the 9. of the thirtenth). Take the side of an Icosahedron, and let the same be the line E, and the side of a Dodecahedron, and let the same be the line F, and the side of a cube &amp; let the same be the line G.Demonstration. Wherfore the line E is the side of an equilater triangle, and F of an equaliter pentagon described in one and the selfe same circle. And the line G being deuided by an extreme and meane proportion, his greater segment is the line F, by the corollary of the 17. of the thirtēth. Now forasmuch as the line E is the side of an equilater triangle, but (by the 12. of the thirtenth) the side of an equilater triangle is in power treble to the line BC, (which is drawne from the center to the circumference) therefore the square of the line E is treble to the square of the line BC: but the squares of the line BC and BD are (by the 4. of the thirtenth) treble to the square of the line CD. Wherfore as the square of the line E is to the square of the line CB, so are the squares of the lines CB and BD to the square of the line CD. Wherefore alternately (by the 16. of

the fifth) as the square of the line E is to the squares

of the lines CB and BD, so is the square of the line CB to the square of the line CD. Here againe is required the Assumpt afterward proued in this 4. proposition. But as the square of the line BC is to the square of the line CD, so is the square of the line G (the side of the cube) to the square of the line F, the side of Dodecahedron. For the line F is the greater segmēt of the line G (as was before proued.) Wherfore (by the .11. of the fift) as the square of the line E is to the squares CB and BD, so is the square of the line G, to the square of the line F. Wherefore alternately (by the 16. of the fifth) &amp; also by conuersion (by the corollary of the 4. of the fift) as the square of the line G, is to the square of the line E, so is the square of the line F, to the squares of the lines CB &amp; BD. But vnto the square of the line F are equal the squares of the lines BC &amp; CD, for the side of a pentagon cōtaineth in power both the side of a sixe angled figure, and the side of a ten angled figure (by the 10. of the thirtenth.) Wherfore as the square of the line G, is to the square of the line E, so are the squares of the lines BC and CD to the squares of the lines CB and BD. But as the squares of the lines CB and CD are to the squares of the lines CB &amp; BD,As may by the Assumpt afterward in this propositiō be plainely proued. so (any right line what so euer it be, being diuided by an extreme and meane proportion) is the line containing in power the squares of the whole line, and of the greater segmēt, to the line containing in power the squares of the whole line, and of the lesse segment: wherfore (by the 11. of the fifth) as the square of the line G (the side of the cube) is to the square of the line E, so (any right line being deuided by an extreme and meane proportion) is the line containing in power the squares made of the whole line, and of the greater segmēt, to the line containing in power the squares made of the whole line, and of the lesse segment: but the line G is the side of the Cube, and the line E of the Icosahedron (by supposition.) If therfore a right line be deuided by an extreeme and meane proportion, as the line cōtaining in power the squares of the whole line, and of the greater segment, is to the line containing in power the squares of the whole line and of the lesse segment: so is the side of the cube to the side of the Icosahedron, being both described in one and the selfe same sphere.

By the Corollary added by Flussas after has Assumpt put after the 17. proposition of the 12. booke.Wherfore perpendicular lines drawne from the centre of the sphere, to the centre of the circle, comprehending bothe the triangle of an Icosahedron, and the pentagon of a Dodecahedron are equal: wherefore the pyramides, whose bases are the pentagons of the Dodecahedron, are of equal altitude with the piramides whose bases are the triangles of the Icosahedron.

                        th) as that which is contayned vnder the lines AB and BC fower times, together with the square of the line AC, is to the square of the line AC, so is that which is contayned vnder the lines DE and EF fower times, together with the square of the line DF, to the square of the line DF. Wherefore as the square which is made of the lines AB and BC added together and made one line (which square by the 8. of the second is equall to that which is contayned vnder the lines AB and BC fower times together with square of the line AC) is to the square of the line AC, so is the square made of the lines DE &amp; EF added together and made one line (which square is also, by the same, equal to that which is contayned vnder the lines DE and EF fower times together with the square of the line DF) to the square of the line DF. Wherefore also as the lines AB &amp; BC added together are to the line AC, so are the lines DE &amp; EF added together to the line DF (by the 22. of the sixt). Wherefore by cō
                        position (by the 18. of the fifth) as both the lines AB &amp; BC added the one to the other, together with the line AC, that is, as two such lines as AB is, are to the line AC, so are both the lines DE and EF added the one to the other together with the line DF, that is two such

lines as DE is to the line DF. And in the same proportion are the halues of the antecedents by the 15. of the fifth. Wherefore as the line AB is to the line AC, so is the line DE to the line DF. (And therefore by the 19. of the fifth, as the line AB is to the line BC, so is the line DF to the line FE. Wherefore also by diuision by the 17. of the fifth, as the line AC is to the line CB, so is the line DF to the line DE).
                     Now that we haue proued, In the 4. section 
                              •
                           f this proposition. that, any right line whatsoeuer being diuided by an extreame and meane proportion, what proportion the line contayning in power the squares made of the whole line and of the greater segment added together, hath to the line contayning in power the squares made of the whole line and of the lesse segment added together, the same proportion hath the side of the cube to the side of the Icosahedron: Now also that we haue proued, In the 1. and 3 section of the same propositiō. that as the side of the cube is to the side of the Icosahedron, so is the superficies of the Dodecahedron to the superficies of the Icosahedron, being both described in one and the selfe same sphere: and moreouer seing that we haue proued, In the 5. sectiō of the same proposition.that as the superficies of the Dodecahedron is to the superficies of the Icosahedrō, so is the Dodecahedrō to the Icosahedron, for that both the pentagon of the Dodecahedron, and the triangle of the Icosahedron are comprehended in one and the selfe same circle:A Corollary. All these thinges I say being proued, it is manifest, that if in one and the selfe same sphere be described a Dodecahedron, and an Icosahedron, they shall be in proportion the one to the other, as, a right line whatsoeuer being diuided by an extreame and meane proportion, the line contayning in power the squares of the whole line and of the greater segment added together, is to the line containing in power the squares of the whole line and of the lesse segment added together. For for that as the Dodecahedron is to the Icosahedron, so is the superficies of the Dodecahedron to the superficies of the Icosahedron, that is, the side of the cube to the side of the Icosahedron: but as the side of the cube is to the side of the Icosahedron, so, any right line what so euer being diuided by an extreame and meane proportion, is the line contayning in power the squares of the whole line and of the greater segment added together, to the line contayning in power the squares of the whole line and of the lesse segment added together. Wherefore as a Dodecahedron is to an Icosahedron described in one and the selfe same sphere, so, any right line what so euer being diuided by an extreame and meane proportion, is the line contayning in power the squares of the whole line &amp; of the greater segment added together, to the line contayning in power the squares of the whole line and of the lesse segment added together.

            ¶The fourtenth booke of Euclides Elementes after Flussas.
            FOr that the fouretenth Booke, as it is set forth by Flussas, containeth in it moe Propositions then are found in Hypsicles, &amp; also some of those Propositions which Hypsicles hath, are by him somewhat otherwise demonstrated, I thought my labour well bestowed for the readers sake to turne it also all whole, notwithstanding my trauaile before taken in turning the same booke after Hypsicles. Where note ye, that here in this 14. booke after Flussas, and in the other bookes following, namely, the 15. and 16. I haue in alleadging of the Propositions of the same 14. booke, followed the order and number of the Propositions, as Flussas hath placed them.
            
               ¶The first Proposition. A perpendicular line drawen from the centre of a circle, to the side of a Pentagon inscribed in the same circle:
                     The first proposition after Campane.
                   is the halfe of these two lines taken together, namely, of the side of the hexagon, and of the side of the decagon inscribed in the same circle.
               TAke a circle ABC, and inscribe in it the side of a pentagon, which let be BC, and take the centre of the circle, which let be the point D:
                     Construction.
                   and frō it draw vnto the side BC a perpendicular line DE: which produce to the point 
                     •
                  . And vnto the line E F put the line EG equall. And draw these right lines CG, CD, and CF. Then I say, that the right line DE (which is drawen from the centre to BC the side of the pentagon) is the halfe of 
                     •
                  he side
                     •
                   of the decagon and hexagon, taken together.
                     Demonstration.
                   Forasmuch as the line DE is a perpendicular 
                     •
                  nto the line BC: therefore the sections BE and EC shall be equall (by the 3. of the third): and the line EF is common vnto them both; and the angles FEC and FEB, are right angles, by supposition. Wherefore the bases BF and FC are equall (by the 4. of the first). But the line BC is the side of a pentagon, by construction. Wherefore FC which subtendeth the halfe of the side of the

pentagon, is the side of the decagon inscribed in the circle ABC. But vnto the line FC is, by the 4. of the first, equall the line CG, for they subtend right angles CEG, and CEF, which are contained vnder equall sides. Wherefore also the angles CGE, and CFE, of the triangle CFG, are equall, by the 5. of the first. And forasmuch as the arke FC is subtended of the side of a decagon, the arke CA shall be quadruple to the arke CF: Wherefore also the angle CDA shall be quadruple to the angle CDF (by the last of the six
                     •
                  ). And forasmuch as the same angle CDA, which is set at the center, is double to the angle CFA, which is set at the circumference, by the 20. of the third: therefore the angle CFA, or CFD, is double to the angle CD
                     •
                  , namely, the halfe of quadruple. But vnto the angle CFD or CFG, is proued equall the angle CGF: Wherefore the outward angle CGF, is double to the angle CDF. Wherefore the angles CDG and DCG, shall be equall. For vnto those two angles the angle CGF is equall, by the 32. of the first. Wherefore the sides GC and GD, are equall, by the 6. of the first. Wherefore also

the line GD is equall to the line FC, which is the side of the decagon. But vnto the right line FE is equall the line EG, by construction. Wherefore the whole line DE is equall to the two lines C
                     •
                   and FE. Wherefore those lines taken together (namely, the lines DF and FC) shall be double to the line DE. Wherefore the line DE (which is drawen from the centre perpendicularly to the side of the pentagon) shal be the halfe of both these lines taken together, namely, of DF the side of the hexagon, and CF the side of the decagon. For the line DF which is drawen from the centre, is equall to the side of the hexagon, by the Corollary of the 15. of the fourth. Wherefore a perpendicular line drawen from the center of a circle, to the side of a pentagon inscribed in the same circle: is the halfe of these two lines taken together, namely, of the side of the hexagon, and of the side of the decagon inscribed in the same circle: which was required to be proued.
               
                  A Corollary.
                  
                     If a right line drawen perpendicularly from the centre of a circle to the side of a pentagon, be diuided by an extreme and meane proportion: the greater segment shall be the line which is drawen from the same c
                           ••
                        tre to the side of an equilater triangle inscribed in the same circle. For, that li
                        ••
                      (drawen to the side of the triangle) is (by the Corollary of the 12. of the thirtenth) the halfe of the line drawen from the centre to the circumference, that is, of the side of the hexagon: Wherefore the residue shall be the halfe of the side of the decagon. For the whole line is the halfe of the two sides, namely, of the side of the hexagon, and of the side of the decagon. But of the side of a decagon and of an hexagon taken together, the greater segment is the side of the hexagon (by the 9. of the thirtenth). Wherefore the greater segment of their halfes shall be the halfe of the hexagon, by the 15. of the fift: which halfe is the perpendicular line drawen from the centre to the side of the triangle, by the Corollary of the 12. of the thirtenth.
               
            
            
               ¶The second Proposition. If two right lines be diuided by an extreme and meane proportion:
                     The 2. proposition after Campane.
                   they shall be diuided into the selfe same proportions.
               SVppose that these two right lines AB and DE be eche cut by an extreme and meane proportion in the pointes F and Z. Then I say, that these two lines are diuided into the selfe same proportions, that is, that the line AB is in the point F diuided in like sort as the line DE is in the point Z. For if they be not in like sort cut, let one of them, namely, DE, be cut like vnto the line AB in the point C.
                     Demonstration leading to an impossibilitie.
                   So that let the line DE be to DC the greater part, as the greater part DC is to CE the lesse part, by the 3. definitiō of the sixt. But (by suppositition) the line DE is to the line DZ, as the

line DZ is to the line ZE. Wherefore the right line DE is diuided by an extreme and meane proportion in two pointes C and Z. But the proportion of DE to DC the lesse line, is greater then the proportion of the same DE to DZ the greater line, by the 2. part of the 8. of the fift. But as DE is to DC, so is DC to CE: Wherefore the proportion of DC to CE, is greater then the proportion of DZ to ZE. And forasmuch as DZ is greater then DC, the proportion of DZ to CE shall be greater then the proportion of DC to CE, by the 8. of the fift. Wherefore the proportion of DZ to CE, is much greater then the proportion of DZ to ZE. Wherefore one and the selfe same magnitude, namely, DZ, hath to CE the greater line, a greater proportion then it hath to ZE the lesse line, contrary to the second part of the 8. of the fift: which is impossible. Wherfore the right lines AB &amp; DE, are not cut vnlike. Wherfore they are cut like, and into the selfe same proportions. And the same demonstration also will serue, if the point C fall in any other place. For alwaies some one of them shall be the greater. If therefore two right lines be cut by an extreme and meane proportion: they shall be cut into the selfe same proportions: which was required to be proued.
            
            
               ¶The third Proposition. If in a circle be described an equilater Pentagon:
                     The 4. proposition after Campane.
                   the squares made of the side of the Pentagon and of the line which subtendeth two sides of the

Pentagon, these two squares (I say) taken together, are quintuple to the square of the line drawen from the centre of the circle to the circūference.
               SVppose that in the circle BCG the side of a

Pentagon be BG: and let the line BC subtend two sides thereof.
                     Constru

                        on.
                   And let the line BG be diuided into two equall partes by a right line drawen from the centre D: namely, by the diameter CDE produced to the point Z. And drawe the right line BZ. Then I say, that the right lines BC and BG, are in power quintuple to the right line DZ, which is drawen from the centre to the circumference. For forasmuch as (by the 47. of the first) the squares of the lines CB and BZ,
                     Demonstration.
                   are equall to the square of the diameter CZ: therefore they are quadruple to the square of the line DZ, by the 20. of the sixt (for the line CZ is double to the line DZ). Wherefore the right lines CB, BZ, and ZD, are in power quintuple to the line ZD. But the right line BG containeth in power the two lines BZ and ZD, by the 10. of the thirtenth. For DZ is the side of an hexagon, &amp; BZ the side of a decagon. Wherefore the lines BC and BG (whose powers are equall to the powers of the lines CB, BZ, ZD) are in power quintuple to the line DZ. If therefore in a circle be described an equilater Pentagon: the squares made of the side of the Pentagon and of the line which subtendeth two sides of the Pentagon, th
                     •
                  se two squares (I say) taken together, are quintuple to the square of the line drawen from the centre of the circle to the circumference.
               
                  ¶A Corollary.
                  
                     If a Cube and a Doderahedron be contained in one and the selfe same Sphere:
                     
                        This Corollary Campane also 
                              •
                           utteth after the 4. proposition in his order.
                      
                     the side of the Cube, and the side of the Dodecahedron, are in power quintuple to the line which is drawen from the centre of the circle which containeth the Pentagon of the Dodecahedron. For it was proued in the 17. of the thirtenth, that the side of the Cube subtendeth two sides of the Pentagon of the Dodecahedron, where the sayd solides are contained in one and the selfe same Sphere. Wherfore the side of the Cube subtending two sides of the Pentagon, and the side of the same Pentagon, are contained in one and the selfe same circle. Wherefore, by this Proposition, they are in power quintuple to the line which is drawen from the centre of the same circle which containeth the Pentagon of the Dodecahedron.
               
            
            
               The 4. Proposition. One and the selfe same circle containeth both the Pentagon of a Dodecahedron,
                     The 5. proposition after Campane.
                   and the triangle of an Icosahedron described in one and the selfe same sphere.
               LEt the diameter of the sphere geuen be AB, and let the bases of the Icosahedron and Dodecahedron described in it,
                     Construction.
                   be the triangle MNR, and the pentagon FKH, and about them let there be described circles. by the 5. and 14. of the fourth. And let the lines drawne from the centres of those circles to the circumferences be LN and OK. Then I say that the lines LN and OK are equal, and therfore one and the selfe same circle containeth both those figures. Let the right line AB, be in power quintuple to some one right line, as to the line CG (by the Corollary of the 6. of the tenth.) And making the cētre the poynt C, &amp; the space CG, describe a circle DZG. And let the side of a pentagon inscribed in that circle (by the 11. of the fourth) be the line ZG. And let EG (subtending halfe of the arke ZG) be the side of a Decagon inscribed in that circle. And by the 30. of the sixt, diuide the line CG by an extreme &amp; meane proportion in the poynt I.
                     Demonstration.
                   Now forasmuche as in the 16. of the thirtenth, it was proued, that this line CG (vnto whome the diameter AB of the sphere is in power quintuple) is the line which is drawne from the centre of the circle, which containeth fiue angles of the Icosahedron, and the side of the pentagon described

in that circle DZG, namely the line ZG

is side of the Icosahedron described in the Sphere, whose diameter is the line AB: therefore the right line ZG, is equal to the line MN, which was put to be the side of the Icosahedrō, or of his triāgular base. Moreouer, by the 17. of the thirtenth, it was manifest that the right line 
                     •
                  H (which subtendeth the angle of the pentagon of the Dodecahedron inscribed in the foresayde sphere) is the side of the Cube, inscribed in the self same sphere. (For vpon the angles of the cube, were made the angles of the Dodecahedron.) Wherefore the diameter AB is in power triple to FH, the side of the Cube (by the 15. of the thirtenth). But the same line AB is (by supposition) in power quintuple to the line CG. Wherefore fiue squares of the line CG, are equal to thre squares of the line FH: (for eche is equal to one and the self same square of the line AB). And forasmuche as EG the side of the Decagon, cutteth the right line CG by an extreme and meane proportion (by the corollary of the 9. of the thirtenth): Likewise the line HK, cutteth the line FH, the side of the Cube by an extreeme and meane proportion (by the Corollary of the 17. of the thirtenth): therfore the lines CG and FH, are deuided into the self same proportions, by the second of this booke: and the right lines CI and EG, which are the greater segmentes of one and the selfe same line CG, are equal: And forasmuche as fiue squares of the line CG are equal to thre squares of the lines FH: therefore fiue squares of the line GE, are equal to thre squares of the line HK (for the lines GE and HK are the greater segmēts of the lines CG and FH).

And forasmuch as the square of the line MN is triple to the square of the line LN (which is drawne from the centre) by the 12. of the thirtenth, therfore fiue squares of the line MN are equal to 15. squares of the line LN.

                         is equall to that which is contained vnder the perpendicular line which falleth vpon the base of the triangle of the Icosahedron, and fiue sixth partes of the side of the cube, the sayd three solides being described in one and the selfe same sphere.
                  
                  Suppose that in the circle ABEG, the pentagon of a Dodecahedron be A

And let the centre of the circle be the poynt D, and let the diameter be ADE, cutting FH, the side of the triangle in the poynt Z, and cutting the line BG in the poynt K. And draw the right line BD. And from the right line KG cut of a third part TG, by the 9. of the sixth. Now then the line BG subtending two sides of the Dodecahedron, shalbe the side of the cube inscribed in the same sphere,
                        Demonstration.
                      by the 17. of the thirtenth: and the triangle of the Icosahedron of the same sphere shalbe A

                     H by the 4. of this booke. And the line AZ which passeth by the centre D shall fall perpendicularly vpon the

side of the triangle. For forasmuch as the angles GAE &amp; BAE are equall (by the 27. of the third
                        •
                      for they are see vpon equall circumferences): therefore the

But that which is contayned vnder the lines AD and BK is (by the 41. of the first) double to the triangle ABD. Wherefore that which is contayned vnder the lines AZ and KT is double to the same triangle ABD. And forasmuch as the pentagon ABCIG contayneth

line AZ, and vnder the line BT which is fiue sixe partes of the line BG.
               
            
            
               ¶ The 7. Proposition. 
                     The 9. proposition after Campane.
                  A right line diuided by an extreame and meane proportion: what proportion the line contayning in power the whole line and the greater segment, hath to the line contayning in power the whole and the lesse segment: the same hath the side of the cube to the side of the Icosahedron contayned in one and the same sphere.
               
                  
                     Construction.
                  TAke a circle ABE: and in it (by the 11. of the fourth) inscribe an equilater pentagon BZECH: and (by the second of the same) an equilater triangle ABI. And let the centre thereof be the poynt G. And drawe a line from G to B. And diuide the line GB by an extreame and meane proportion in the poynt D (by the 30. of the sixth). And let the line ML contayne in power both the whole line GB and his lesse segment BD

(by the corollary of the 13. of the tenth). And draw the right line B
                     •
                   sub

                     •
                  g the angle of the pentagon, which shall be the side of the cube (by the corollary of the 17. of the thirtenth) 
                     •
                   and the line BI shall be the side of the Icosahedron, and the line 
                     •
                  Z the side of the Dodecahedron by the 4. of this booke. Then I say that BE the side of the cube is to BI the side of the Icosahedron, as the line contayning in power the lines BG &amp; GD is to the line contayning in power the lines GB and BD.
                     Demonstration.
                   For forasmuch as (by the 12. of the thirtenth) the line BI is in power triple to the line BG, and (by the 4. of the same) the squares of the line GB &amp; BD are triple to the square of the line GD. Wherefore (by the 15. of the fifth) the square of the line BI is to the squares of the lines GB &amp; BD (namely, triple to triple), as the square of the line B
                     •
                   is to the square of the line GD (namely, as one is to one). But as the square of the line BG is to the square of the GD, so is the square of the line BE to the square of the line BZ. (For the lines BG, GD, and BE, BZ are in one and the same proportion, by the second of this booke. For BZ is the greater segment of the line BE, by the corollary of the 17. of the thirtenth). Wherefore the square of the line BE is to the square of the line BZ, as the square of the line BI is to the squares of the lines BG and BD. Wherefore alternately the square of the line BE is to the square of the line BI, as the square of the line BZ is to the squares of the lines GB and BD. But the square of the line BZ is equall to the squares of the lines BG and GD (by the 10. of the thirtenth). For the line BG is equall to the side of the hexagon, and the line GD to the side of the decagon, by the corollary of the 9. of the same. Wherefore the squares of the lines BG and GD, are to the squares of the lines G
                     •
                   and BD, as the square of the line BE is to the square of the line BI. But the line ZB contayneth in power the lines BG and GD, and the line ML contayneth in power the lines GB and BD by construction. Wherefore as the line ZB (which contayneth in power the whole line BG and the greater segment GD) is to the line ML (which contayneth in in power the whole line GB and the lesse segment BD) so is BE the side of the cube to BI the side of the Icosahedron, by the 22. of the sixth. Wherefore a right line diuided by an extreame and meane proportion: what proportion the line contayning in power the whole line and the greater segment, hath to the line contayning in power the whole line and the lesse segment: the same hath the side of the cube to the side of the Icosahedron cōtayned in one and the same sphere which was required to be proued.

                           •
                         a Corollary in the 9. proposition after his order.
                  The solide of a Dodecahedron is to the solide of an Icosahedron: as the side of a Cube is to the side of an Icosahedron, all those solides being described in one and the selfe same Sphere.
               
                  FOrasmuch as in the 4. of this booke, it hath bene proued, that one and the self same circle containeth both the triangle of an Icosahedron, and the pentagon of a Dodecahedron described in one and the selfe same Sphere: Wherefore the circles, which cōtaine those bases, being equall, the perpendiculars also which are drawen from the centre of the Sphere to those circles, shall be equall (by the Corollary of the Assumpt of the 16 of the twelfth). And therefore the Pyramids set vpon the bases of those solides haue one and the selfe same altitude: For the altitudes of those Pyramids concurr
                     •
                   in the centre. Wherefore they are in proportion as their bases are, by the 5. and 6. of the twelfth. And therefore the pyramids which compose the Dodecahedron, ar
                     •
                   to the pyramids which compose the Icosahedron, as the bases are, which bases are the superficieces of those solides. Wherefore their solides are the one to the other, as their superficieces are. But the superficies of the Dodecahedron is to the superficies of the Icosahedron, as the side of the cube is to the side of the Icosahedron, by the 6. of this booke. Wherfore by the 11. of the fifth, as the solide of the Dodecahedron is to the solide of the Icosahedron, so is the side of the cube to the side of the Icosahedron, all the said solides being inscribed in one and the selfe same Sphere. Wherefore the solide of a Dodecah

                  dron is to the solide of an Icosahedron: as the side of a cube is to the side of an Icosahedron, all those solides being described in one and the self same Sphere: which was required to be proued.
               
                  A Corollary.
                  The solide of a Dodecahedron is to the solide of an Icosahedron,This Corollary is the 9. proposition after Campane. as the superficieces of the one are to the superficieces of the other, being described in one and the selfe same Sphere: Namely, as the side of the cube is to the side of the Icosahedron, as was before manifest: for they are resolued into pyramids of one and the selfe same altitude.

               SVppose that ABG be an equilater triangle: and from the point A draw vnto the side BG a perpendicular line AD: and let the line AB be rationall. Then I say, that the superficies ABG is mediall.
                     Construction.
                   Forasmuch as the line AB is in power sesquitertia to the line AD (by the Corollary of the 12. of the thirtenth): of what partes the line AB containeth in power 12, of the same partes the line AD containeth in power 9:
                     Demonstration.
                   wherefore the residue BD containeth in power of the same partes 3. (
                     •
                  or the line AB cōtaineth in power the lines AD and BD, by the 47. of the first). Wherfore the

lines AD and DB are rationall and commensurable to the rationall line set AB, by the 6. of the tenth. But forasmuch as the power of the line AD is to the power of the line DB in that proportion that 9. a square number is to 3. a number not square: therfore they are not in the proportion of square numbers, by the Corollary of the 25. of the eight. And therfore they are not commensurable in length, by the 9. of the tenth. Wherefore that which is contained vnder the lines AD and DB, which are rationall lines commensurable in power onely, is mediall, by the 22. of the tenth. But that which is contained vnder the lines AD and DB, is double to the triangle ABD, by the 41. of the first. Wherefore that which is contained vnder the lines AD and DB, is equall to the whole triangle ABG (which is double to the triangle ABD, by the 1. of the sixt). Wherefore the triangle ABG is mediall. If therfore the side of an equilater triangle be rationall: the superficies shall be irrationall, of that kinde which is called Mediall: which was required to be proued.
               
                  A Corollary.
                  
                     If an Octohedron and a Tetrahedron be inscribed in a Sphere whose diameter is rationall:
                     
                        The 13. proposition after Campane.
                      their superficieces shall be mediall. For those superficieces consiste of equilater triangles, whose sides are commensurable to the diameter which is rationall, by the 13. and

14. of the thirtenth, and therefore they are rationall. But they are commensurable in power onely to the perpendicular line, and therefore they containe a mediall triangle, as it was before manifest.
               
            
            
               ¶The 10. Proposition. 
                     The 14. proposition after Campane.
                  If a Tetrahedron and an Octohedron be inscribed in one and the self same Sphere: the base of the Tetrahedron shall be sesquitertia to the base of the Octohedron, and the supersicieces of the Octohedron shall be sesquialtera to the superficieces of the Tetrahedron.
               
                  
                     Demonstration of the first part.
                  FOrasmuch as the diameter of the Sphere is in power sesquialtera to the side of the Tetrahedron (by the 13. of the thirtenth) and the same diameter is in power duple to the side of the Octohedron (by the 14. of the same booke): therefore of what partes the diameter containeth in power sixe, of the same the side of the Tetrahedron contayneth in power 4, and of the same the side of the Octohedron containeth in power 3. Wherefore the power of the side of the Tetrahedron, is to the power of the side of the Octohedron in the same proportion that 4. is to 3: which is sesquitertia. And like triangles (which are the bases of the solides) described of those sides, shall haue the one to the other the same proportion that the squares made of those sides haue. For both the triangles are the one to the other, and also the squares are the one to the other, in double proportion of that in which the sides are, by the 20. of the sixth.
                     Demonstration of the second part.
                   Wherefore of what partes one base of the Tetrahedron was 4: of the same are fower bases of the Tetrahedron 16: likewise of what partes of the same one base of the Octohedron was 3: of the same are 8. bases of the Octohedron 24. Wherfore the bases of the Octohedron are to the bases of the Tetrahedron, in that proportion that 24. is to 16: which is sesquialtera. If therefore a Tetrahedron and an Octohedron be inscribed in one and the selfe same Sphere: the base of the Tetrahedron shall be sesquitertia to the base of the Octohedron, and the superficieces of the Octohedron shall be sesquialtera to the superficieces of the Tetrahedron: which was required to be proued.

                  7/64 of AC the side of the Tetrahedron. And let the line ML be in lēgth subsesquioctaua to the same side. Thē I say, that the Tetrahedron ACD is to the Octohedron AEB, as the rectangle parallelogramme contayned vnder the lines NL and LM,
                     First part of the Demonstration.
                   is to the square of the line AB. Forasmuch as the line drawen frō the angle A by the centre H perpēdicularly vpon the base of the Tetrahedron, falleth vpon the cēter T of the circle which containeth that base, and maketh the right line HT the sixth part of the diameter AB (by the Corollary of the 13. of the thirtenth): therefore the line HA (which is drawen from the centre to the circū
                  ference) is triple to the line HT: and therefore the whole line AT is

to the line AH, 
                     〈…〉
                  . Let the Tetrahedron ADC be cut by a plaine GHK passing by the centr

                   H, and being parallel vnto the base DTC, by the Corollary of the 11. of the eleuenth. Now then the triangle ADC of the Tetrahedron, shall be cut by the right line KG, which is parallel to the line DC, by the 16. of the eleuenth. Wherfore as the line AT is to the line AH, so is the line AC to the line AG (by the 2. of the sixth). Wherefore the line AC is to the line AG sesquitertia, that is, as 4. to 3. And forasmuch as the triangles ADC, AKG, and the rest which are cut by the plaine KHG, are like the one to the other, by the 5
                     •
                   of the sixth: the pyramids ADC and AKG, shall be like the one to the other, by the 7. definition of the 
                     •
                  leuenth. Wherefore they are in triple proportion of that in which the sides AC and AG are, by the 8. of the twelfth. But the proportion of the sides AC to AG is, as the proportion of 4. to 3. Now then, if, by the 2. of the eight, ye finde out 4. of the lest numbers in continuall proportion, and in that proportion that 4. is to 3: which shall be 64.48.36. and 27: it is manifest, by the 15 definition of the fifth, that the extremes 
                     •
                  4. to 27. are in triple proportion of that in which the proportion geuen 4. to 3. is: Or the quantitie of the proportion of 4. to 3. (which is 1. and 1/
                     •
                  ) being twise multiplied into it selfe, there shall be produced the proportion of 64. to 27. Wherefore the Pyramis or Tetrahedron ADC is to the pyramis AKG, as 64. is to 
                     •
                  7: which is triple to the proportion of 4. to 3. And forasmuch as the line AC is vnto the line AG in length sesquitertia: of what partes the line AC containeth in power 64: of the same partes doth the line AG containe in power 36. For (by the 2. of the sixth) the proportion of the powers or squares, is duple to the porportion of the sides which are as 64. is to 48.
               Now then vpon the line RS which let be equall to the line AG, let there be an equilater triangle QRS described (by the first of the first).

Wherefore the line RV (which is the halfe of the line RX) containeth in lēgth of the same partes 32. of which the line AC contayned in length 36. Wherefore the line RV is to the line AC subsesquioctaua: and therefore the line RV is equall to the line LM which is also subsesquioctaua to the same line AC. And forasmuch as the line NL is equall to the line QT, and the line LM to the line RV (as before hath bene proued) the rectangle parallelogramme contayned vnder the lines QT and RV, shall be equall to the rectangle parallelogramme, contayned vnder the line NL which is in power

                     there shall be produced a solide equall to the solide of the cube. For it is before manifest that two third partes of the power of the diameter of the sphere are equall to two bases of the cube. If therefore vnto eche of those two thirds be applyed halfe the altitude of the cube, they shall make eche of those solides equall to halfe of the cube, by the 31. of the eleuenth: for they haue equall bases.

But the side DF is in power triple to the line drawne from the centre to the circumference of the circle which containeth the triangle of the octohedron (namely to the line ID) by the 12. of the thirtenth. Wherfore the selfe same diameter AB or DH, which was in power sextuple to the line drawne from the centre to the circumference of the circle which containeth the square of the cube, is also sextuple to the line ID drawne from the centre to the circumference of the circle, which containeth the triangle of the Octohedron: Wherefore the lines drawne from the centres of the circles to the circumferences which containe the bases of the cube and of the octohedron are equal. And therfore the circles are equal, by the first diffinition of the third. Wherfore one and the selfe same circle containeth &amp;c. as in the proposition: which was required to be proued.
               
                  A Corollary.
                  
                     Hereby it is manifest, that perpendiculars coupling together in a sphere, the centres of the circles which containe the opposite bases of the cube and of the Octohedron, are equal. For the circles are equal, by the second corollary of the assumpt of the 16. of the twelfth: and the lines which passing by the centre of the sphere, couple together the centres of the bases, are also equal, by the first corollary of the same. Wherfore the perpendicular which coupleth together the opposite bases of the Octohedron, is equal to the side of the cube. For either of them is the altitude erected.
               
            
            
               The 14. Proposition. An Octohedron is to the triple of a Tetrahedron contained in one and the

selfe same sphere, in that proportion that their sides are.
               SVppose that there be an octohedron ABCD, and a Tetrahedron EFGH: vpon whose base FGH erect a Prisme,
                     Construction.
                   which is done by erecting from the angles of the base perpendicular lines equal to the altitude of the Tetrahedron: which prisme shalbe triple to the Tetrahedron EFGH, by the first corollary of the 7. of the twelfth. Then I say that the octohedron ABCD is to the prisme which is triple to the Tetrahedron, EFGH, as the side BC is to the side FG. For forasmuch as the sides of the opposite bases of the octohedron,
                     Demonstration.
                   are right lines touching the one the other, and are parellels to other right lines touching the one the other, for the sides of the squares which are cōposed of the sides of the octohedrō, are opposite: Wherfore the opposite plaine triangles, namely, ABC &amp; KID, shalbe parallels, and so the rest

by the 15. of the eleuenth. Let the diameter of the Octohedron, be the line AD. Now then the whole Octohedron is cut into foure equal and like pyramids set vpon the bases of the octohedron, and hauing the same altitude with it, &amp; being about the Diameter AD: namely the pyramis set vpon the base BID, and hauing his toppe the poynt A, and also the pyramis set vppon the base BCD, hauing his top the same poynt A. Likewise the pyramis set vpō the base IKD, &amp; hauing his toppe the same poynt A: and moreouer the pyramis set vpon the base CKD, and hauing his toppe the former poynt A: which pyramids shalbe equal by the 8. diffinition of the eleuenth (for they eche consist of two bases of the octohedron, and of two triangles contained vnder the diameter AD and two sides of the octohedrō). Wherfore the prisme which is set vpon the base of the Octohedron, and hauing the same altitude with it, namelye, the altitude of the parallel bases, as it is manifest by the former, is equal to thre of those pyramids of the Octohedron, by the first corollary of the seuēth of the twelft. Wherefore that prisme shall haue to the other prisme vnder the same altitude, composed of the 4. pyramids of the whole octohedron, the proportion of the triangular bases, by the 3. corollary of the same. And forasmuch as 4. pyramids are vnto 3. pyramids in sesquitercia proportion, therefore the trianguler base of the prisme which containeth 4. pyramids, is in sesquitertia proportion to the base of the prisme which containeth thre pyramids of the same octohedron, and are set vpon the base of the Octohedron and vnder the altitude thereof: that is, in sesquitercia proportion to the base of the Octohedron. But the base of the same octohedron is in sesquitertia proportion to the base of the pyramis, by the 
                     •
                  enth of this booke: Wherefore the triangular bases, namely, of the prisme which cōtaineth four pyramids of the octohedron, and is vnder the altitude thereof, are equal to the triangular bases of the prisme, which containeth three pyramids vnder the altitude of the pyramis EFGH. But the prisme of the octohedron is equal to the octohedron: and the prisme of the pyramis EFGH is proued triple to the same pyramis EFGH. Now then the prismes set vpō equal bases, are the one to the other as their altitudes are (by the corollary of the 25. of the eleuenth) namely, as are the parallelipidedons their doubles, by the corollary of the 31. of the eleuenth. But the altitude of the Octohedron is equal to the side of the cube contained in the same sphere, by the corollary of the 13. of this booke. And the side of the cube is in power to the altitude of the Tetrahedon in that proportion that 12. is to 16, by the 18. of the thirtenth: And the side of the octohedron is to the side of the pyramis in that proportion that 18. is to 24. (by the same 18. of the thirtēth) which proportion is one &amp; the self same with the proportiō of 12. to 16. Wherfore that prisme which is equal to the Octohedron, is to the prisme which is triple to the Tetrahedron, in that proportiō that the altitudes, or that the sides are. Wherfore an octohedrō is to the triple of a Tetrahedron cōtained in one and the selfe same sphere, in that proportion that their sides are: which was required to be demonstrated.
               
                  
                  A Corollary.
                  
                     The sides of a Tetrahedron &amp; of an Octohedrō are proportionall with their altitudes. For the sides &amp; altitudes were in power sesquitercia. Moreouer the diameter of the sphere is to the side of the Tetrahedron, as the side of the Octohedron is to the

Let also the Octohedron inscribed in the selfe same Sphere be FGHK: whose three diameters let be FH, GK, and ON. Then I say, that the cube ABD is to the Octohedron FGH, as the superficies of the cube is to the superficies of the Octohedron. Drawe from the centre of the cube to the base ABED, a perpendicular line CR. And from the centre of the Octohedron draw to the base GNH, a perpendicular line

                  here shall be made of the cube sixe pyramids, as thys pyramis ABDEC, equall to the whole cube. For there are in the cube

                   of the thirtenth. Now the bases of the cube and of the Octohedron are contained in equall circles of the

Sphere, by the 13. of this booke. Wherefore they shall be equally distant from the centre, and the perpendicular lines CR and 
                     •
                  , shall be equall, by the Corollary of the Assumpt of the 16. of the twelfth. Wherefore the pyramids of the cube shall be vnder one and the selfe same altitude with the pyramids of the Octohedron, namely, vnder the perpendicular line drawen from the centre to the bases. Wherfore sixe pyramids of the cube, are to 8. pyramids of the Octohedron being vnder one and the same altitude, in that propo

                  tion that their bases are, by the 6. of the twelfth: that is, one pyramis set vpon sixe bases of the cube, and hauing to his altitude the perpendicular line, which pyramis is equall to the sixe pyramids, by the same 6. of the twelfth, is to one pyramis set vpon the 8. bases of the Octohedron, being equall to the Octohedron, and also vnder on

                   and the selfe same altitude, in that proportion that sixe bases of the cube, which containe the whole superficies of the cube, are to 8. bases of the Octohedron

                   which containe the whole superficies of the Octohedron. For the solides of those pyramids are in proportion the one to the other, as their bases are, by the selfe same 6. of the twelfth. Wherefore 
                     •
                  he superficies of the cube is to the superficies of the Octohedron inscribed in one and the selfe same Sphere, in that proportion, that the solides are: which was required to be proued.
            
            
               ¶ The 20. Proposition. If a Cube and an Octohedron be contained in one &amp; the selfe same Sphere: they shall be in proportion the one to the other, as the side of the Cube is to

the semidiameter of the Sphere.
               SVppose that the Octohedron AECDB be inscribed in the Sphere ABCD: and let the cube inscribed in the same Sphere be FGHIM: whose diameter let be HI,
                     Construction.
                   which is equall to the diameter AC, by the 15. of the thirtenth: let the halfe of the diameter be AE. Then I say, that the cube FGHIM is to the Octohedron AECDB, as the side MG is to the semidiameter AE. Forasmuch as the diameter AC is in power double to BK the side of the Octohedron (by the 14. of the thirtenth) and is in power triple to MG the side of the cube (by the 15. of the same): therefore the square BKDL shall be sesquial

                  er to FM the square of the cube. From the line AE cut of a third part AN, and frō the line MG cut of likewise a third part GO, by the 9. of the sixth.
                     Demonstration.
                   Now then the line EN shall be two third partes of the line AE, and so also shall the line MO be of the line MG. Wherefore the parallelipipedon set vpon the base BKDL, and hauing his altitude the line EA, is triple to the parallelipipedon set vpon the same base, and hauing his altitude the line AN, by the Corollary of the 31. of the eleuenth: but it is also triple to the pyramis ABKDL which is set vpon the same base, and is vnder the same altitude (by the second Corollary of the 7. of the twelfth). Wherefore the pyramis ABKDL is equall to the parallelipipedon, which is set vpon the base BKDL, and

hath to his altitude the line AN. But vnto that parallelipipedō, is double the parallelipipedon which is set vppon the same base BKDL, and hath to his altitude a line double to the line EN, by the Corollary of the 31. of the first and vnto the pyramis is double the Octohedron ABKLDC, by the 2. Corollary of the 14. of the thirtenth. Wherefore the Octohedron ABKDLC is equall to the parallelipipedon set vpon the base BKLD, &amp; hauing his altitude the line EN (by the 15. of the fifth). But the parallelipipedon set vpon the base BKDL, which is sesquialter to the base FM, and hauing to his altitude the line MO, which is two third partes of the side of the cube MG, is equall to the cube FG: by the 2. part of the 34. of the eleuenth. (For it was before proued that the base BKDL is sesquialter to the base FM). Now then these two parallelipipedons, namely, the parallelipipedon which is set vpō the base BKDL (which is sesquialter to the base of the cube) and hath to his altitude the line MO (which is two third partes of MG the side of the cube) which parallelipipedon is proued equall to the cube, and the parallelipipedon set vpon the same base BKDL, and hauing his altitude the line EN (which parallelipipedon is proued equall to the Octohedron): these two parallelipipedons (I say) are the one to the other, as the altitude MO, is to the altitude EN (by the Corollary of the 31. of the eleuenth). Wherefore also as the altitude MO, is to the altitude EN, so is the cube FGHIM, to the Octohedron ABKDLC, by the 7. of the fifth. But as the line MO is to the line EN, so is the whole line MG to the whole line EA, by the 18. of the fifth. Wherefore as MG the side of the cube, is to EA the semidiameter, so is the line FGHIM to the Octohedron ABKDLC inscribed in one &amp; the selfe same Sphere. If therefore a cube and an Octohedron be contained in one and the selfe same Sphere. they shall be in proportion the one to the other, as the side of the cube is to the semidiameter of the Sphere: which was required to be demonstrated.
               
                  A Corollary.
                  
                     Distinctly to notefie the powers of the sides of the fiue solides by the power of the diameter of the sphere.
                  
                  The sides of the tetrahedron and of the cube doo cut the power of the diameter of the sphere into two squares which are in proportion double the one to the other. The octohedron cutteth the

power of the diameter into two equall squares. The Icosahedron into two squares, whose proportion is duple to the proportion of a line diuided by an extreame and meane proportion, whose lesse segmēt is the side of the Icosahedron. And the dodecahedron into two squares, whose proportion is quadruple to the proportion of a line diuided

by an extreame and meane proportion, whose lesse segment is the side of the dodecahedron. For AD the diameter of the sphere, contayneth in power AB the side of the tetrahedron, and BD the side of the cube, which BD is in power halfe of the side AB. The diameter also of the sphere contayneth in power AC and CD two equall sides of the octohedron. But the diameter contayneth in power the whole line AE and the greater segment thereof ED, which is the side of the Icosahedron, by the 15. of this booke. Whe
                        •
                     fore their powers being in duple proportiō of that in which the sides are, by the first corollary of the 20. of the sixth, haue their proportion duple to the proportion of an extreame &amp; meane proportiō. Farther the diameter cōtayneth in power the whole line AF, and his lesse segment FD, which is the side of the dodecahedron, by the same 15. of this booke. Wherefore the whole hauing to the lesse, 
                        •
                      double proportion of that which the extreame hath to the meane, namely, of the whole to the greater segment, by the 10. diffinition of the fifth, it followeth that the proportion of the power is double to the doubled proportion of the sides, by the same first corollary of the 20. of the sixth: that is, is quadruple to the proportion of the extreame and of the meane, by the diffinition of the sixth.
                  
                     An aduertisment added by Flussas.
                     
                     By this meanes therefore, the diameter of a sphere being geuen, there shall be geuen the side of euery one of the bodies inscribed. And forasmuch as three of those bodies haue their sides commensurable in power onely, and not in length, vnto the diameter geuen (for their powers are in the proportion of a square number to a number not square: wherefore they haue not the proportion of a square number to a square number, by the corollary of the 25. of the eight: wherefore also their sides are incommensurabe in length by the 9. of the tenth): therefore it is sufficient to compare the powers and not the lengths of those sides the one to the other
                           •
                         which powers are contained in the power of the diameter: namely, from the power of the diameter, let there ble taken away the power of the cube, and there shall remayne the power of the Tetrahedron: and taking away the power of the Tetrahedron, there remayneth the power of the cube: and taking away from the power of the diameter halfe the power thereof, there shall be left the power of the side of the octohedron. But forasmuch as the sides of the dodecahedron and of the Icosahedron are proued to be irrationall (for the side of the Icosahedron is a lesse line, by the 16. of the thirtenth: and the side of the dedocahedron is a residuall line, by the 17. of the same) therfore those sides are vnto the diameter which is a rationall line set, incommensurable both in length and in power. Wherefore their comparison can not be diffined or described by any proportion expressed by numbers, by the 8. of the tenth: neither can they be compared the one to the other: for irrational lines of diuers kindes are incōmēsurable the one to the other: for if they should be commensurable, they should be of one and the selfe same kinde, by the 103. and 105. of the tenth, which is impossible. Wherefore we seking to compare them to the power of the diameter, thought they could not be more aptly expressed, then by such proportions, which cutte that rationall power of the diameter according to their sides: namely, diuiding the power of the diameter by lines which haue that proportiō, that the greater segment hath to the lesse, to put the lesse segment to be the side of the Icosahedron: &amp; deuiding the sayd power of the diameter by lines hauing the proportion of the whole to the lesse segment, to expresse the side of the dodecahedron by the lesse segment: which thing may well be done betwene magnitudes incommensurable.

            ¶The fiftenth booke of Euclides Elementes.
            THis finetenth and last booke of Euclide, or rather the second boke of Appollonius or Hypsicles,
               
                  The argument of the 15. booke.
                teacheth the inscription and circumscriptiō of the fiue regular bodies one within and about an other: a thing vndoutedly plesant and delectable in minde to contemplate, and also profitable and necessary in act to practise. For without practise in act, it is very hard to se and conceiue the constructions and demonstrations of the propositions of this booke, vnles a man haue a very depe, sharpe, &amp; fine imagination. Wherfore I would wish the diligent studēt in this booke, (to make the study thereof more pleasant vnto him) to haue presently before his eyes, the bodyes formed &amp; framed of pasted paper (as I taught after the diffinitions of the eleuenth booke.) And then to drawe and describe the lines and diuisions, and superficieces, according to the constructions of the propositions. In which descriptions if he be wary and diligent, he shall finde all things in these solide matters, as clere and as manifest vnto the eye, as were things before taught only in plaine or superficial figures. And although I haue before in the twelfth boke admonished the reader hereof, yet bicause in this boke chiefly that thing is required, I thought it should not be irkesome vnto him, againe to be put in minde thereof.
            Farther this is to be noted, that in the Greke exemplars are found in this 15. booke only 5. propositions, which 5. are also only touched and set forthe by Hypsicies: vnto which Campane addeth 8. and so maketh vp the number of 13. Campane vndoubtedly although he were very well lerned, and that generally in all kinds of learning, yet assuredly being brought vp in a time of rudenes, when all good letters were darkned, &amp; barberousnes had ouerthrowne and ouerwhelmed the whole world, he was vtterly rude and ignorant in the Greke tongue, so that certenly he neuer redde Euclide in the Greke, nor (of like) translated out of the Greke: but had it translated out of the Arabike tonge. The Arabians were men of great study, and industry, and commonly great Philosophers, notable Phisitions, and in mathematicall Artes most expert, so that all kinds of good learning flourished and raigned amongst them in a manner only. These men turned whatsoeuer good author was in the Greke tonge (of what Art and knowledge so euer it were) into the Arabike tonge. And frō thence were many of thē turned into the Latine, and by that meanes many Greeke authors came to the handes of the Latines, and not from the first fountaine the Greke tonge, wherin they were first written. As appeareth by many words of the Arabike tonge yet remaining in such bokes: as are Zenith, nadir, helmuayn, helmuariphe, and infinite suche other. Which Arabians also in translating such Greke workes, were accustomed to adde, as they thought good, &amp; for the fuller vnderstanding of the author, many things: as is to be sene in diuers authors, as, namely, in Theodosius de Sphera, where you see in the olde translation (which was vndoubteldy out of the Arabike) many propositions, almost euery third or fourth leafe. Some such copye of Euclide, most likely, did Campanus follow, wherein he founde those propositiōs, which he hath more &amp; aboue those which are found in the Greke set out by Hypsicles: and that not only in this 15. boke, but also in the 14. boke, wherin also ye finde many propositions more thē are founde in the Greeke, set out also by Hypsicles. Likewise in the bookes before, ye shall finde many propositions added, and manye inuerted, and set out of order farre otherwise, then they are placed in the Greeke examplars. Flussas also a diligent restorer of Euclide, a man also which hath well deserued of the whole Art of Geometrie, hath added moreouer in this booke (as also in the former

                  o whome chefely these two diffinitions pertaine) for that the nomber of their angles, superficieces, &amp; sides are not equal, one compared to an other: it is not of necessitie, that all the angles of the solide inscribed should together at one time touch either all the angles, or all the superficieces, or all the sides of the solide circumscribed: but it is sufficient, that those angles of the inscribed solide which touch, doe at one time together eche touch some one angle of the figure circumscribed, or some one base, or some one side: so that if the angles of the inscribed figure do at one time touche the angles of the figure circumscribed, none of them may at the same time touche either the bases or the sides of the same circumscribed figure: and so if they touch the bases, they may touche neither angles nor sides: and likewise if they touche the sides, they may touch neither angles nor bases.

For they subtend equall plaine angles of the bases of the pyramis, and those equall angles are contained vnder equall sides, namely, vnder the halfes of the sides of the pyramis. Wherefore the triangles TKL, TLI, TIE, TEK, ZKL, ZLI, ZIB, ZEK, are equilater: and they limitate, and containe the solide TKLEZI. Wherefore the solide TKLEZI is an Octohedron: by the 23. definition of the eleuenth. And the angles of the same Octohedron do touch the sides of the pyramis ABCD in the pointes E, Z, I, T, K, L. Wherefore the Octohedron is inscribed in the pyramis (by the 1. definition of this booke). Wherefore in the trilater equilater pyramis geuen, is inscribed an Octohedron: which was required to be done.

first). Wherefore the point I is the centre of the base of the cube. And by the same reason may be found out the centres of the rest of the bases, which let be the pointes K, L, O, N, M. And drawe these right lines LI, IM, MO, OL, KI, KL, KM, KO, NI, NL, NM, &amp; NO.Demonstr

And the right line IL subtendeth the right angle IPL, namely, it subtendeth the halfe sides of the cube which containe the right angle IPL, and likewise the right line IM subtendeth the angle IQM which is equall to the same angle IPL, and is contained vnder right lines equall to the right lines which containe the angle IPL. Wherefore the right line IM is equall to the right line IL (by the 4. of the first). And by the same reason may we proue, that euery one of the right lines MO, OL, KI, KL, KM, KO, NI, NL, NM, and NO, which subtend angles equall to the selfe same angle IPL, and are cōtained vnder sides equall to the sides which containe the angle IPL, are equall to the right line IL. Wherefore the triangles KLI, KLO, KMI, KMO, and NLI, NLO, NMI, NMO, are equilater and equall: and they containe the solide IKLONM. Wherefore IKLONM is an Octohedron, by the 23. definition of the eleuenth. And forasmuch as the angles thereof do altogether in the pointes I, K, L, O, N, M, touch the bases of the cube which containeth it, it followeth that the Octohedron is inscribed in the cube (by the first definition of this booke.) Wherefore in the cube geuen, is described an Octohedron: which was required to be done.

And forasmuch as I is the centre of the equilater triangle ABE, therefore the right line AI being extended, cutteth the right line BE into two equall partes (by the Corollary of the 12. of the thirtenth). And forasmuch as MO is a parallel to BE, therefore the triangle AIO is like to the whole triangle ACE (by the Corollary of the 2. of the sixth). And the right line MO is diuided into two equall partes in the point I (by the 4. of the sixth). And by the same reason may we proue, that the right lines MN, NX, XO, are diuided into two equall

partes in the pointes T, L, K. Wherefore also againe, the bases TI, IK, KL, LT, which subtend the angles set at the pointes M, O, X, N, which angles are right angles, and are contained vnder equall sides, those bases, I say, are equall. And forasmuch as TIM is an Isosceles triangle, therefore the angles set at the base, namely, the angles MTI and MIT, are equal (by the 
                        ••
                      of the first). But the angle M is a right angle: wherefore eche of the angles MIT and MTI, is the halfe of a right angle. And by the same reason the angles OIK &amp; OKI, are equall. Wherefore the angle remayning, namely, TIK,

is a right angle (by the 13. of the first). For the right lines TI and IK are set vpon the line MO. And by the same reason may the rest of the angles, namely, IKL, KLT, LTI, be proued right angles, and they are in one and the self same plaine superficies, namely, MNXO (by the 7. of the eleuēth). Wherefore the right lines which ioyne together the centres of the plaine superficiall triangles which make the solide angle A, do make the square ITKL. And by the same reason may be proued, that the plaine superficiall triangles of the rest of the fiue solide angles of the Octohedron set at the pointes B, G, Z, D, E, do in the centres of their bases receaue squares, So that there are in number sixe squares, for euery Octohedron hath sixe solide angles: and those squares are equall: for their sides do containe equall angles of inclinations contained vnder equall sides, namely, vnder those sides which are drawen from the centre to the side of the equall triangles (by the 2. Corollary of the 18. of the thirtenth). Wherefore ITKLRPVS is a cube (by the 21. definition of the eleuenth) and hath his angles in the centres of the bases of the Octohedron, and therefore is inscribed in it (by the first definition of this booke). Wherefore in an Octohedron geuen is described a cube: which was required to be done.

Now forasmuch as (by those thinges which haue bene proued in the 16. of the thirtenth) the bases of the triangles which contayne the angle of the Icosahedron doo make a pentagon inscribed in a circle, let that pentagon be ABGDE, which is made of the fiue bases of the triangles, whose playne superficiall angles remayning make the solide angle geuen, namely, Z. And take the centres of the circles which contayne the foresaid triangles, which centers let be the poyntes I, T, K, M, L: and draw these right lines IT, TK, KM, ML, LI.Demonstration. Now then a perpendicular line drawne from the poynt Z to the playne superficies of the pentagon ABGDE, shall fall vpon the centre of the circle which contayneth the pentagon ABGDE (by those thinges which haue bene proued in the selfe same 16. of the thirtenth). Moreouer perpendicular lines drawne from the centre to the sides of the pentagon ABGDE shall in the poyntes C, N, O where they fall cut the right lines AB, BG, GD into two equall partes (by the 3. of the third). Draw these right lines CN and NO. And forasmuch as the angles CBN and NGO are equall, and are contained vnder equall sides, therefore the base CN is equall to the base NO (by the 4. of the first).

And now forasmuch as the right lines ZI, IG are equall to the right lines ZT, TN, &amp; also to the right lines ZK, KO (by reason of the likenes of the equall triangles): therefore the line IT is a parallell to the line CN, and so also is the line TK to the line NO (by the 2. of the sixt). Wherfore the angles ITK, and CNO are equal (by the 11. of the eleuenth). Agayne forasmuch as the triangles CBN, and NGO are Isoscels triangles, therefore the angles BCN and BNC are equall (by the 5. of the first). And by the same reason the angles GNO, and GON are equall. And moreouer the angles BCN and BNC are equall to the angles GNO, and GON, for that the triangles CBN and NGO are equall and like. B
                        ••
                      the three angles BNC, CNO, ONG, are equall to two right angles (by the 13. of the first): for that vpon the right line B

                      are set the right lines CN &amp; ON. And the three angles of the triangle CBN, namely, the angles BNC, BCN or GNO (for the angle GNO is equall to the angle BCN as it hath bene proued) and NBC are also equall to two right angles (by the 32. of the first). Wherefore taking away the angles BNC &amp; GNO, the angle remayning, namely, CNO is equall to the angle remayning, namely, to CBN. Wherfore also the angle ITK (which is proued to be equall to the angle CNO) is equall to the angle CBN. Wherefore ITK is the angle of a pentagon. And by the same reason may be pro

Wherefore ITKML is an equilater and equiangle pentagon (by the 4. of the first) For the equall bases of the pentagon ITKML doo subtend equall angles set at the point Z, and comprehended vnder equall sides. Moreouer it is manifest that the pentagon ITKML is in one and the selfe same playne superficies. For foras

And the triangles KTI and TIL concurre: wherefore they are in one and the selfe same playne superficies (by the corollary of the 16. of the eleuēth). And by the same reasō so may we proue that the triangles ILM, LMK, MKT are in the selfe same playne superficies wherein are the triangles KTI and TIL. Wherefore the pentagon ITKML is in one and the selfe same playne superficies. Wherefore the solide angle of the Icosahedron, namely the solide angle at the poynt Z subtendeth an equilater and equiangle pentagon plaine superficies, which pentagon hath his plaine superficiall angles in the centres of the triangles which make the solide angle Z. And in like sort may we proue that the other eleuen solide angles of the Icosahedron, eche of which eleuen solide angles are equall and like to the solide angle Z (by the 16. of the thirtenth) are subtended vnto pentagons equall, and like, and in like sort set to the pentagon ITKML.

In an Icosahedron, vpon the side of one of the triangles thereof, describe a pentagon, and draw the line which subtendeth one of the angles of the sayd pentagon, and making the centres the endes of that line, and the space the perpendicular line of the triangle, describe circumferences: and draw from the common intersectio

And forasmuch as ADB and ADC are equilater triangles, and the line AD is diuided into two equall partes, therefore the lines BE and EC fall perpendicularly vpon the line AD, by the 8. of the first. Now I say that the angle BEC is an acute angle. For forasmuch as the line AC is double to the line AE (for by construction the line AD, which is equal to the line AC, is diuided into two equall partes in the point E): therefore the square of the line AC is quadruple to the square of the line AE (by the c
                           •
                        rollary of the 20. of the sixt). But the square of the line AC is equall to the squares of the lines AE and EC (by the 47. of the first): and the square of the line AC is to the square of the line CE (sesquitertia) as 4. to 3: (for the square of the line AC is proued quadruple to the square of the line AE): wherefore the square of the line BC (which is equall to the square of the line AC) is lesse then the squares of the two perpendiculars BE &amp; EC (for it is vnto them in subsesquialter proportiō, namely, as 4. to 6. or 2. to 3.) Wherefore (by the 13. of the second) the angle 
                           •
                         EC is an acute angle. Now forasmuch as the line AD is the common intersection of the two plaines ABD, and ADC, and in either of those plaines to one point of the common section are drawne perpendicular lines

                        . is to 3.) as was in the former proued.) Wherefore the square of the line DB is to the square of the line FD, as 8. is to 3. (namely, as 2. to 1. and 4. to 3. added together), but the line DF is equal to the line FB. Wherefore the square of the line DB, is greater then the squares of the lines DF and FB (for it is to them, as 8. is to 6.) Wherfore the angle BFD, is an obtuse angle (by the 12. of the second.) And forasmuche as the line AE is the common section of the two plaines ABE and ADE cutting the one the other, and in either of those plaines to a poynt in the common section are drawne perpendicular lines, BF and DF, containing an obtuse angle BFD: wherfore the angle BFD (contained of the right lines BF and DF) is the angle of the inclination of the plaines ABE and ADE. If therefore the angle BFD be geuen, the saide inclination also is g
                           •
                        uen. For forasmuch as the triangle of the Octohedron is geuen, and one of the sides of the Octohedron is the line AD, and vpon it is described the square AC, and BD the diameter of that square being geuen, and the lines BF and FD are the perpendiculars of that triangle: wherefore also the angle BFD is geuen. Now then if vpon the side of the triangle be described a square: as the square AC, and the diameter BD be drawne, if also making the centres the poyntes B and D, and the space, the said perpendicular of the triangle, we describe circles, they shall cut the one the other in the poynt F. And the right lines which are drawne from the centres to the poynt F shal containe that inclination, which is comprehended vnder the angle BFD, which is the angle of the inclination of those plaines. And it is manifest that either of the lines BF and FD, is greater then the halfe of the line. For for that, by the demonstration, it was proued that the square of the line BD is to the square of the line FD, as 8. is to 3: therfore the square of half the line BD, is to the square of the line FD, as 
                           •
                        . is to thre (for the square of halfe the line BD is the fourth part of the square of the whole line BD, by the 4. of the second). Wherefore either of the lines BF and FD, is greater then the line BD: wherfore the circles which are described by those lines BF and FD, and hauing their centres the poynts B and D shall cut the one the other. And thus much touching the octohedron.
                     As touching the Icosahedron, suppose an equilater

pētagon ABCDE, &amp; vpon it let there be set a pyramis hauing his toppe the poynt F: and let the triangles which cōtaine it, be equilater. Now thē the pyramis ABCDEF, shal be a part of the Icosahedrō. Let FC one side of one of the triangles be deuided into two equal partes in the poynt G. And draw the lines BG &amp; GD, which shal be equal &amp; fal perpēdicularly vpon the line FC (as it is easie to se by the demō
                        stratiō of the former). Thē I say that ye angle BGD is an obtuse angle: which thing is manifest. For drawing the line BD, it shall subtend the obtuse angle BCD of the pentagon (which is obtuse, by that which was demonstrated in the ende of the first corollary of the 18. of the 13. booke:) But the angle BGD is greater then the angle BCD, for the lines BG and GD, are lesse then the lines BC and CD: wherefore likewise as in the former the angle BGD is the inclination of the triangles BFC, and CFD. Wherfore the angle BGD being geuen, the inclination also of the plaines of the Icosahedron shall be geuen. For if vpon the side of the triangle of the Icosahedron be described an equilater pentagon, and then be drawne the line which subtendeth two sides of the pentagon, as in this figure the line BD, if also the perpendiculars BG and GD of the triangles be drawne, the angle BGD shalbe geuen. For if ye make the centres the endes of the line which subtendeth two sides of the pentagon, as the poynts B and D, and the space the perpendicular of the triangle, and so describe circles, they shall cut the one the other in the poynt G, and from the poynt of the inters

Wherfore the line KL hath to the line LP a greater proportion then it hath to the line HO. Wherfore the line HO is greater then the line LP, by the 10. of the fifth.
                     As concerning a Dodecahedron. Take one of the squares of the cube wheron the Dodecahedron is described (by the 17. of the thirtenth): and let the same be ABCD: and let the two plaines of the Dodecahedron set vpon it be AEBFG, and GFDHC. Then I say that here also is geuen the inclination of the two

pentagons. Diuide (by the 10. of the first) the side FG into two equal partes in the poynt K. And from the poynt K draw vnto the line FG in either of the plaines AEBFG and GFDHC perpendicular lines KL and KM (by the 11. of the first.) And draw the line ML. First I say that the angle MKL is an obtuse angle. For, by the discourse of the demonstration of the 17. proposition of the 13. boke, where is taught the description of the Dodecahedron, it is manifest, that the line drawne perpendicularly from the poynt K to the square ABCD, is equal to halfe the side of the pentagon. Wherefore it is lesse then halfe of the line ML. Wherefore the angle MKL is an obtuse angle. Moreouer by the former discourse of the 17. proposition of the 13. booke, it was manifest that the square of the line KL is equal to the square of half the side of the cube, and to the square of halfe the side of the pentagon. And forasmuche as

the lines KL and KM are equal, and a

                         the inclination of the two plaines of the Dodecahedron. For forasmuch as the side of the square ABCD subtendeth two sides of the pentagon geuen, the pentagon also is geuen, and therefore also is geuen the line ML. But there is also geuen either of the lines MK and KL: for they are drawne perpendicularly frō the section into two equal partes of the line AB, which subtendeth two sides of the pentagon vnto the side of the pentagon, which is a parallel vnto the line AB: namely, to the side FG: Wherfore there is geuen the angle LKM, which is the angle of the inclination sought for. And now touching Isidorus wordes, he sayeth, that the pentagon being geuen, we must draw the line which subtendeth two sides of the pentagon, which line 15 equal to the side of the cube: and making the centres the endes of that line, and the space the perpendicular line, which is drawne from the section of the same line into two equal parts to the side of the pentagon which is parellel to the said line, as in the former description the line KL, or the line KM, describe circumferences, and from the poynt of the intersection of the circumferences draw vnto the centres right lines which shall containe the angle of the inclination. For by that which was sayd before, namely; touching the Icosahedron, it is manifest that the perpendicular KL, is greater then halfe of the 
                           〈◊〉
                         ML or CD, which is equal vnto it. And therefore the circles described by those perpendiculars and hauing to their centres the end of the line CD, shall cut the one the other, as was before proued.

                     The bases of a Pyramis inscribed in an Octohedron, are parallels to the bases of the Octohedron. For forasmuch as the sides of the bases of the Pyramis touching the one the other, are parallels to the sides of the Octohedron which also touch the one the other, as for example, HL was proued to be a parallel to GI, and LC to DI, therefore, by the 15. of the eleuenth, the plaine superficies which is drawen by the lines HL and LC, is a parallel to the plaine superficies drawen by the lines GI and DI. And so likewise of the rest.
               
               
                  Second Corollary.
                  
                     A right line ioyning together the centres of the opposite bases of the Octohedron, is sesquialter to the perpendicular line drawen from the angle of the inscribed

pyramis to the base thereof. For forasmuch as the pyramis and the cube which containeth it do in the selfe same pointes end their angles (by the 1. of this booke): therefore they shall both be inclosed in one and the selfe same Octohedron (by the 4. of this booke). But the diameter of the cube ioyneth together the centres of the opposite bases of the Octohedron, and therefore is the diameter of the Sphere which containeth the cube and the pyramis inscribed in the cube (by the 13. and 14. of the thirtenth): which diameter is sesquialter to the perpendicular which is drawen from the angle of the pyramis to the base thereof: for the line which is drawen from the centre of the sphere to the base of the pyramis, is the sixth part of the diameter (by the 3. Corollary of the 13. of the thirtenth). Wherefore of what partes the di

                   And by the same, take the 12. sides of the cube, eche of which subtend one angle of eche of the 12. bases of the dodecahedron: for the side of the cube subtendeth the angle of the pentagon of the dodecahedron, by the 2. corollary of the 17. of the thirtenth.

together in such sort that they be in like sort situate,

as it was plainely proued in that proposition, then shall it be manifest, that the right lines drawne in this dodecahedron from the foresayd 8. angles thereof doo make the foresayd cube, which therefore is included in the dodecahedron, for that the sides of the cube are drawne in the sides of the dodecahedron, and the angles of the same cube are set in the angles of the said dodecahedron.

Which fower right lines make a square: for that eche of those right lines doo subtend equall angles of equall pentagons, &amp; the angles which those 4. right lines cōtaine are right angles, as we proued in the construction of the dodecahedron, in the 17. propositiō before alledged. Wherfore the sixe bases being squares, do make a cube (by the 21. diffinition of the eleuenth) and for that the 8. angles of the sayd cube are set in 8. angles of the dodecaheeron, therefore is the sayd cube inscribed in the dodecahedron (by the first diffinition of this booke). Wherefore in a dodecahedron is inscribed a cube: which was required to be doone.

                   Now (by the 3. correllary of the 17. of the thirtēth take the 6. sides which are opposite the one to the other, those 6. sides, I saye whose sections wherin they are deuided into two equal partes, are coupled by three right lines which in the centre of the sphere, wherin the Dodecahedron is contained, doe cut the one the other perpendicularly. And let the poyntes wherin the forsayde sides are cut into two equal partes be A, B, G, D, C, I. And let the foresaid thre right lines ioyning together the saide sections be AB, GD and CI. And let the centre of the sphere be E.
                     Demonstration.
                   Now forasmuch as (by the foresaid correllary) those thre right lines are equal, it foloweth (by the 4. of the first) that the right lines subtēding the right angles which they make at the centre of the sphere, whiche right angles are contained vnder the halues of the said three right lines, are equal the one to the other: that is, the right lines AG, GB, BD, DA, CA, CG, CB, CD, and IA, IG, IB, ID are equal the one to the other. Wherfore also the 8. triangles CAG, CGB, CBD, CDA, IAG, IGB, IBD &amp; IDA are equal and equilater. And therefore AGBDCI is an Octohedron by the 23. definition of the eleuēth.) And the sayd Octahedron is included in the dodecahedron (by the first definition of this booke:) for that all the angles thereof doe at one time touch the sides of the dodecahedron.

then draw thse right lines AO, BO and DO: Now forasmuch as (by the 17. of the thirtenth) the angles of the dodecahedron are set in the superficies of the sphere described about the Dodecahedron

                   therefore if vpon the diameter SO, and by the poynt A, be described a semicircle, it shall make the angle SAO a right angle (by the 31. of the third.) And likewise if the same semicircle be drawne by the poyntes D and B, it shall also make the angles SBO, and SDO right angles. Wherefore the diameter SO containeth in power bothe the lines SA, AO, or the lines SB, BO, or els SD, DO, but the lines SA, SD, SB are equal the one to the other, for they eche subtend one of the angles of equal pentagōs. Wherfore the other lines remaining, namely, AO, BO, DO are equal the one to the other. And by the same reason may be proued that the diameter HD which subtendeth the two right lines HA, AD, containeth in power both the said two right lines, and also containeth in power bothe the right lines HB and BD, which two right lines it also suhtendeth.

And by the same reason may be proued that eche of those right lines AD, BD and BA is equal to eche of the right lines AO, BO and DO. Wherefore the sixe right lines AB, BD, DA, AO, BO, &amp; DO are equal the one to the other. And therefore the triangles which are made of thē, namely, the triangles ABD, AOB, AOD and BOD are equal and equilater: which triangles therfore do make a pyramis ABDO, whose base is ABD and toppe the poynt O. Eche of the angles of which pyramis, namely, the angles at the pointes A, B, D, O, doe in the selfe same pointes touche the angles of the Dodecahedron. Wherfore the said pyramis is inscribed in the Dodecahedron, (by the first diffinition of this boke.)

Wherefore the line BE, containing in power the two lines BG and GE, by the 47. of the first, is in power quadruple to the line GB (for the line GE was proued to be in power triple to the same line GB): Wherefore the line BE is in length double to the line BG, by the

                  A. And as the whole line Hl is to the greater segment, so shall the same greater segment Hl be to the lesse segment lA, by the 5. of the thirtenth. Wherefore the line HA is diuided

by an extreme and meane proportion in the point l. But in the triangle AHN, the line NA, which is drawen frō the centre of the base AD, is in the point I cut like vnto the line All, by thu parallel line lI (by the same second of the sixth): for the lines HN and Il, are parallels, by construction. Wherefore the line NA is in the point I diuided by an extreme and meane proportion by the superficies dBEH. And forasmuch as the line YON which coupleth the centres of the opposite bases, is a parallel to the line HE: A plaine superficies extended by the line YON, parallel wise to the plaine dBEH: the two plaines shall cut the lines AO and AN (the semidiameter of the cube, and the semidiameter of the base AD) into the selfe same proportions in the pointes m and I, by the 17. of the eleuēth. But the line AN is in the point I diuided by an extreme &amp; meane proportion: Wherefore the semidiameter of the cube is in the point m diuided by an extreme and meane proportion by the plaine of the triangle BCE. And forasmuch as the rest of the triangles described in the cube after the like maner, may by the same reasons be proued to be in a plaine which cutteth the semidiameter of the cube by an extreme and means proportion: it is manifest that three plaines of the Dodecahedron shall vnder euery angle of the cube concurre in one &amp; the self same point o

And extend the line Cn to the line Bd, and let it concurre with it in the point a. And forasmuch as the plaine which passeth by the line HCE and the centre O (cutting the cube into two equall partes) is parallel to AF the base of the cube by construction: imagine that by the poynt n, be extended a playne superficies parallel to the former parallel playnes,

                   shall be right angles. Imagine by the line BI and the centre O a plaine to passe (cutting the cube into two equall partes) parallel to the base AD. And vnto those plaines let there be imagined an other parallel plaine passing by the poynt n: which let be ne: which shall cutte the semidiameter AO and the halfe side of the cube, namely, the line lH, like, in the pointes n and c by the 17. of the eleuenth.

                     •
                   is diuided by an extreame &amp; meane proportion in the point C. Againe vnto the same playnes imagine an other playne to passe by the point a, parallel wise, and let the same be ag. Now then (by the same 17. of the eleuenth) the lines Ca and Cg are in like sort cut in the pointes n and e. But the line Ca was in the point n cutte by an extreame and meane proportion, wherefore the line Cg shall be cutte in the poynt e, by an extreame &amp; meane proportion. But the line IC is to the line Ce, as the greater segment is to the lesse: wherfore the line Ce, is to the line eg, as the greater segment to the lesse: and therefore their proportion is as the whole line IC is to the greater segment Ce, and as the greater segment Ce is to the lesse segment eg: wherefore the whole line Ceg which, maketh the greater segment and the lesse, is equall to the whole line IC or IE. And forasmuch as two parallel plaine superficieces (namely, that which is extended by IOB and that which is extended by the line ag) are cutte by the playne of the triangle BCE, which passeth by the lines ag and IB, their common sections ag and IB shall be parallels (by the 16. of the eleuenth). But the angle BIE or BIC is a right angle, wherefore the angle agC is also a right angle (by the 29. of the first) and those right angles are contayned vnder equall sides, namely, the line gC is equall to the line CI, and the line ag to the line BI, by the 33. of the first: wherfore the bases Ca and CB are equall, by the 4. of the first. But of the line CB the line CE was proued to be the greater segment: wherefore the same line CE is also the greater segment of the line Ca: but cn was also the greater segment of the same line Ca. Wherefore vnto the line CE, the line cn which is the side of the dodecahedron, and is set at the diameter, is equall. And by the same reason the rest of the sides, which are set at the diameter may be proued e
                     •
                  uall to lines equall to the line CE. Wherfore the pentagon inscribed in the circle where in is contained the triangle BCE is, by the 11. of the fourth equiangle, and equilater. And forasmch as two pentagons, set vpon euery one of the bases of the cube doo make a dodecahedron, and sixe bases of the cube doo receaue twelue angles of the dodecahedron: and the 8. semidiameters doo in the pointes where they are cutte by an extreame and meane proportion receaue the rest: therefore the 12. pentagon bases contayning 20. solide angles doo inscribe the dodecahedron in the cube: by the 1. diffinition of this booke. Wherefore in a cube geuen is inscribed a dodecahedron: which was required to be done.
               
                  First Corollary.
                  
                     The diameter of the sphere, which containeth the dodecahedron, containeth in power these two sides, namely, the side of the Dodecahedron, and the side of the cube wherein the Dodecahedron is inscribed. For in the first figure a line drawne from the centre O, to the poynt B the angle of the Dodecahedron, namely the line OB, containeth in power these two lines OV the halfe side of the cube, and VB the halfe side of the dodecahedron, by the 47. of the first. Wherefore by the 15. of the fiueth, the double of the line OB, which is the diameter of the sphere containing the Dodecahedron, containeth in power the double of the other lines OV and VB, which are the sides of the cube, and of the dodecahedron.
               
               
                  ¶ Second Corollary.
                  
                     The side of a cube diuided by an extreme and meane proportion, maketh the lesse segment the side of the dodecahedron inscribed in it: and the greater segment the side of the cube inscribed in the same Dodecahedron: For it was before proued, that the side of the dodecahedron is the greater segment of BE the side of the triangle BEC
                        •
                      but the side BE (which is equall to the line

                  Third Corollary.
                  
                     The side of a cube, is equal to the sides of a Dodecahedron inscribed in it, and circumscribed about it. For it was manifest by this proposition, that the side of a cube maketh the lesse segment, the side of a Dodecahedron inscribed in it, namely, as in the first figure the line BS the side of the Dodecahedron inscribed, is the lesse segmēt of the line GF the side of the cube. And it was proued in the 17. of the thirtenth, that the same side of the cube subtēdeth the angle of the pentagon of the Dodecahedron circumscribed: and therefore it maketh the greater segment the side of the Dodecahedron or of the pentagon, by the first corollary of the same. Wherefore it is equal to bothe those segments.

And deuide the lines drawn from the centres, as the line DT. &amp;c. by an extreme and meane proportion in the poyntes A, F: L, M: N, B: P, Q: R, S: C, O: by the 30. of the sixth: and let the greater segmentes be about the cētres. And draw these right lines, AL, AG, AM, and TG. And forasmuch as the lines cut are parallels to the sides of the cube:
                     Demonstration.
                   they shall make right angles the one with the other by the 29. of the first: and forasmuche as they are equal: their sections shall be equal, for that the sections are like by the 2. of the fourtenth. Wherfore the line TG is equal to the line DT, for they are eche, halfe sides of the cube. Wherfore the square of the whole line TG, and of the lesse segment TA, is triple to the square of the line AD the greater segment (by the 4. of the thirtēth). But the line AG containeth in power the lines AT &amp; TG, for the angle ATG is a right angle. Wherefore the square of the line AG is triple to the square of the line AD. And forasmuch as the line MGL is erected perpendicularly to the plain passing by the lines AT, &amp; which is parallel to the bases of the cube (by the corollary of the 14. of the eleuēth) therfore the angle AGL is a right angle. But the line LG is equal to the line AD, for they are the greater segments of equal lines: Wherfore the line AG (which is in power triple to the line AD) is in power triple to the line LG. Wherefore adding vnto the same square of the line AG, the square of the line LG, the square of the line AL, which (by the 47. of the first) containeth in power the two lines AG and GL, shalbe quadruple to the line AD or LG. Wherefore the line AL is double to the line AD (by the 20. of the sixth:) and therfore is equal to the line AF, or to the line LM. And by the same reason may we proue that euery one of the other lines which couple the next sections of the lines cut, as the lines AM, PF, PM, MQ, and the rest are equal. Wherfore the triangles ALM, APF, AMP, PMQ and the rest such like, are equal, equiangle, and equilater, by the 4. and eigth of the first. And forasmuch as vpon euery one of the lines cut of the cube are set two triangles, as the triangles ALM, and BLM
                     •
                   there shalbe made 12. triāgles. And forasmuch as vnder euery one of the

                  . angles of the cube, are subtended the other 8. triangles, as the triangle AMP. &amp;c. of 1

The inuention of the demonstration of this dependeth of the ground of the former. Wherfore in a cube geuen, we haue described an Icosahedron: which was required to be done.

                     The diameter of a sphere which containeth an Icosahedron, containeth two sides, namely the side of the Icosahedron, and the side of the cube which containeth the Icosahedron.

                     The six opposite sides of the Icosahedron deuided into two equal parts: their sections are coupled by three equal right lines, cutting the one the other into two equal partes, and perpendicularly in the centre of the sphere which containeth the Icosahedron. For those three lines are the three lines which couple the centres of the bases of the cube, which do in suche sort in the centre of the cube, cut the one the other, by the corollary of the third of this booke, and therfore are equal to the sides of the cube. But right lines drawne from the cē
                     tre of the cube to the angles of the Icosahedron, euery one of them shall subtend the halfe side of the cube, and the halfe side of the Icosahedron (which halfe sides containe a right angle) wherefore those lines are equal. Wherby it is manifest that the foresaid centre is the centre of the sphere which containeth the Icosahedron.
               
               
                  Third Corollary.

                     The sides and bases of the Icosahedron, which are opposite the one to the other, are parallels. Forasmuch as euery one of the opposite sides of the Icosahedron, may be in the parallel lines of the cube, namely, in those parallels which are opposite in the cube: and the triangles which are made of parallel lines, are parallels, by the 15. of the eleuenth: therfore the opposite tri

               LEt there be taken an Octohedron, whose 6. angles, let be A, B, C, F, P, L. And draw the lines AC, BF, PL,
                     Construction.
                   cutting the one the other perpendicularly in the point R (by the 2. Corollary of the 14. of the thirtenth). And let euery one of the 12. sides of the Octohedron be diuided by an extreme and meane proportion, in the pointes H, X, M, K, D, S, N, G, V, E, Q, T. And let the greater segmentes be the lines BH, BX, FM, FK, AD, AQ, CS, CT, PN, PG, LV, LE: And drawe these lines HK, XM, GE, NV, DS, QT. Now forasmuch as in the triangle ABF, the sides are cut proportionally, namely, as the line BH is to the line HA, so is the line FK to the line KA (by the 2. of the fouretenth):
                     Demonstration.
                   therefore the line HK shall be a parallel to the line BF (by the 2. of the sixth). And forasmuch as the line AC cutteth the line HK in the point Z, and the line ZK is a parallel vnto the line RF, the line RA shall be cut by an extreme and meane proportion in the point Z: by the 2. of the sixth: namely, shall be cut like vnto the line FA: and the

greater segmēt therof shall be the line ZR. Vnto the line ZK put the line RO equall, by the 3. of the first: and drawe the line KO: now then, the line KO shall be equall to the line ZR, by the 33. of the 
                     •
                  irst. Draw the lines KG, KE, and KI. And forasmuch as the triangles ARF, and AZK, are equiangle (by the 6. of the sixth) the sides AZ and ZK, shall be equall the one to the other, by the 4. of the sixth, for the sides AR and RF, are equall. Wherfore the line ZK shall be the lesse segment of the line RA. But if the greater segment RZ be diuided by an extreme &amp; meane proportion, the greater segment therof shall be the line ZK, which was the lesse segment of the whole line RA, by the 5. of the thir
                     •
                  enth. And forasmuch as the two lines FE and FG, are equall to the two lines AH and AK, namely, ech are lesse segmentes of equall sides of the Octohedron, and the angles HAK and EFG are equall, namely, are right angles, by the 14. of the thirtenth: the bases HK and GF shall be equall, by the 4. of the first: And by the same reason vnto them may be proued equall the lines XM, NV, DS, and QT. And forasmuch as the lines AC, BF, and PL, do cut the one the other into two equall parts, and perpendicularly, by construction: the lines HK and GE (which subtend angles of triangles like vnto the triangles whose angles the lines AC, BF, and PL subtend) are cut into two equall partes in the pointes Z and I, by the 4. of the sixth, so also are the other lines NV, XM, DS, QT (which are equall vnto the lines HK &amp; GE) cut in like sort, and they shall cut the lines AC, BF, and PL like. Wherefore the line KO (which is equall to RZ) shall make the greater segment the line RO, which is equall to the line ZK (for the greater segment of the RZ was the line ZK): and therefore the line OI shall be the lesse segment, when as the whole line RI is equall to the whole line RZ. Wherefore the squares of the whole line KO, and of the lesse segment OI, are triple to the square of the greater segment RO, by the 4. of the thirtenth. Wherfore the line KI, which containeth in power the two lines KO and OI, is in power triple to the line RO (by the 47. of the first): for the angle KOI is a right angle. And forasmuch as the lines FE and FG (which are the lesse segmentes of the sides of the Octohedron) are equall: and the line FK is cō
                  mon

to them both: and the angles KFG and KFE (of the triangles of the Octohedron) are equall: the bases KG and KE shall (by the 4 of the first) be equall: and therefore the angles KIE and KIG which they subtend, are equall (by the 8. of the first): Wherefore they are right angles, by the 13. of the first. Wherefore the right line KE (which containeth in power the two lines, KI and 
                     •
                  E by the 47. of the first) is in power quadruple to the line RO (or IE): for the line RI is proued to be in power triple to the same line RO: But the line GE is double to the line IE: Wherfore the line GE is also in power 
                     〈…〉

                     The bases of the Icosahedron are concentricall (that is, haue one and the selfe same centre) with the bases of the Octohedron which contayneth it.

                  SVppose that there be a trilater equilater Pyramis, whose base let be ABC, and

                   and they shall

                  all perpendicularly vpon the bases, and shall also fall vpon the centres of the circles which containe the bases, by the Corollary of the 13. of the thirtenth. Let the cen

                  re of the triangle ABC, be the point G, and let the centre of the triangle ADC be the point H

                   and of the triangle ADB let the point N be the centre, and finally, let the point F be the centre of the other triangle DBC. And let the right lines falling vpon those cētres be DEG, BEH, CEN, &amp; AEF. And by those centers G, H, N, F, let there be drawen from the angles to the opposite sides these right lines, AGL,

DHK, BNM, and DFL, which shall fall perpendicularly vpon the sides BC, CA, AD, and CB, by the Corollary of the 1

                   them into two equall partes in the pointes K, L, M, by the

3. of the third. Agayne let the lines which wer drawen from the solide angles to the opposite bases be diuided into two equal partes, namely, the line DG in the point T, the line CN in the point O, the line AF in the point P, and the line BH in 
                     •
                  he point R: and drawe the lines HT, FT, HO, and FO. Now forasmuch as the lines GK,
                     Demonstration.
                   and GL, which are drawen from the centre of one and the self same triangle ABC to the sides, are equall, and the lines DK and DL are equall, for they are the perpendiculars of equal &amp; like triangles:
                     Produce in the figure the line TF to the point B.
                   and the line DG is common to thē. Wherefore, by the 8. of the first, the angles KDG &amp; LDG, are equall. And forasmuch as the lines HD &amp; DF are drawen from the centre of equal circles which cō
                  taine the equal triangles ADC &amp; DBC, therfore they are equal, &amp; the line DT is cōmon to thē both, and they containe equal angles, as before hath bene proued. Wherfore the bases HT and FT are equal by the 4. of the first. And by the same reason if we drawe the lines CF and CH, may we proue that the other lines HO and FO, are equal to the same lines HT and FT, and also the one to the other. Wherfore also after the same maner may be proued that the rest of the lines, which couple the centres of the triangles and the sections of the perpendiculars into two equal partes, as the lines NP, GR, GP, RN: NT, PH, GO, and RF, are equal. And forasmuche as from euery one of the centres of the bases are drawne thre right lines to the sections into two equal parts of the perpendiculers, and there are foure centres, it followeth, that these equal right lines so drawne, are twelue in number, of which euery three and three make a solide angle in the foure centres of the bases, and in the foure sections into two equal partes of the perpendiculars: wherfore that solide hath 8. angles, contained vnder 12. equal sides, which make sixe quadrangled figures, namely, HOFT, PGRN, PHOG, GOFR, FRNT, and TNPH. Now let vs proue that those quadrangled figures are rectangle.
               Forasmuch as vpon DC the common base of the triangles ADC and BDC falleth the perpendiculars AS and BS, which are drawne by the centres H and F: either of these lines HS and SF shalbe the third part of either of these lines AS and SB: for the line AH is duple to the line HS, and deuideth the base DC into two equal partes by the corollary of the 12. of the thirtenth. Wherefore in the triangle ABS, the sides AS and BS are cut proportionally in the poynts H and F: and therfore the line HF is a parallel to the side AB, by the 2. of the sixth. Wherfore the triangles ASB and HSF are equiangle, by the 6. of the sixth. Wherfore the base HF shalbe the third part of the base AB, by the 4. of the sixth. We may also proue that the line TO is the third part of the line DC, for the lines EC and ED, which are drawne from the centre of the sphere which containeth the pyramis are equal: and the line EN, (which is drawne from the centre to the base) is the third part of the line EC, so also is the line GE the third part of the line ED (by the corollary of the 13. of the thirtenth) for it is the sixth parte of the diameter of the sphere which containeth the pyramis: And the line ON, is the half of the whole line NC wherfore the residue EO is the third part of the line EC
                     •
                   and so also is the line ET the third part of the line ED. Wherfore the line TO in the triangle DEC is a parallel to the line DC, and is a third parte of the same, by the former 2. and 4. of the sixth, as the line HF was proued the third part of the line AB. But AB and DC being sides of the pyramis are equal. Wherfore the lines HF and TO, being the third partes of equal lines, are equal, by the 15. of the fiueth. Wherfore by the 8. of the first the angles HTF, and TFO are equal: and by the same reason, the angles opposite vnto them, namely, the angles FOH

and OHT are equal the one to the other, and also are equal to the said angles HT
                     •
                   and TFO: but these foure angles are equal to 4. right angles by the corollary of the 32. of the first: wherefore the angles of the quadrangle HOFT are right angles. And by the same reason may the angles of the other fiue quadrangled figures be proued right angles
                     •
                   Now resteth to proue that the foresayde quadrangles are ech in one and the selfe same plaine.
               Take the quadrāgle

HOFT: and forasmuch as in the triangle ASB, the line HF is proued a parallel to the line AB, therefore it cutteth the lines SV, and SB proportionally in the poynts I. and F. by the 2. of the sixth: Now then forasmuch as SF was proued the third parte of the line SB, the line SI, shall also be the thirde part of the line SV. Moreouer forasmuch as the line VS, whiche coupleth the sections into equal partes of the opposite 
                     •
                  ides of the pyramis, namely, of the sides AB and DC, is by the centre E deuided into two equal partes, by the corollary of the seconde of this boke (for it is the diameter of the octohedron inscribed in the pyramis): therfore the line SI is two third partes of the halfe line SE. And by the same reasō, forasmuch as in the triāgle DEC the line TO is proued to be a parallel to the side DC, it shall in the selfe same triangle cut the lines CE and SE, proportionally in the poynts O and I by the same 2. of the sixth: but the line EO is proued to be a third parte of the line EC. Wherefore the lyne EI is also a third part of the line ES. Wherefore the residue IS shalbe two third partes of the whole line ES. Wherefore the point I cutteth of the lines TO and HF. Wherefore the two lines HIF and TIO cutting the one the other, are in one and the selfe same' plaine, by the 2. of the eleuenth. And therefore the poyntes H, T, F, O are in one &amp; the selfe same plaine. Wherfore

                     The line which cutteth into two equall partes the opposite sides of the Pyramis, is triple to the side of the cube inscribed in the pyramis, and passeth by the centre of the cube. For the line SEV, whose third part the line SI is, cutteth the opposite sides CD and AB into two equll partes: but the line EI (which is drawne from the centre of the cube to the base is proued to be a third part of the line ES: wherefore the side of the cube which is double to the line EI shall be a third part of the whole line VS, which is (as hath bene proued) double to the line ES.

For the lines TN or NH are equall, for that by construction they are eche lesse segmentes: and the line RT or TS is in power duple to the same line TN or NH (by the corollary of the 16. of this booke) for it subtendeth the angle of the triangle contayned vnder the two segmentes. Wherfore the lines TH, TS, TR, TQ, and TO are equall: and so also are the lines HS, SR, RQ, QO, and OH, which subtend the angles at the poynt T, equall.

Now then if we take the centres of those triangles, we shall there finde the 20. angles of the dodecahedron inscribed in it by the 5. of this booke. And forasmuch as 4. bases of the foresayd Icosahedrō are cōcentricall with the bases of the pyramis, as it was proued in the 2. corollary of the 6. of this boke: there shal be placed 4

Forasmuch as a cube contayned in one and the selfe same sphere with a dodecahedron, is inscribed in the same dodecahedron, as it was manifest by the 17. of the thirtenth, and 8. of this booke: it followeth that a cube and a dodecahedron circumscribed about it, are contayned in one and the selfe same bodies, for that their angles concurre in one and the selfe same poyntes. And it was proued in the 18. of this booke, that 4. angles of the cube inscribed in the pyramis are set in the middle sections of the

perpendicular
                     •
                   which are drawne from the solide angles of the pyramis to the opposite bases: wherefore the other 4. angles of the dodecahedron are also, as the angles of the cube, set in those middle sections of the perpendiculars. Namely, the angle V is set in the middest of the perpendicular AH

                   the angle Y in the middest of the perpendicular BF: the angle X in the middest of the perpendicular GE: and lastly the angle D in the middest of the perpendicular D which is drawne from the toppe of the pyramis to the opposite base. Wherefore those 4. angles of the dodecahedron may be sayd to be directly vnder the solide angles of the pyramis, or they may be sayd to be set at the perpendiculars. Wherefore the dodecahedron after this maner set, is inscribed in the pyramis geuen (by the first diffinition of this booke) for that vpō euery one of the bases of the pyramis are set an angle of the dodecahedrō inscribed. Wherefore in a trilater equilater pyramis is inscribed a dodecahedron.

                   Then I say that those lines describe the triangle CDE of the Icosahedron. For forasmuch as the lines BG and FH are parallels, by the 2. of the sixth: by the point D let the line ODN be drawne parallel to either of the lines BG &amp; FH. Wherfore the triangle HDN shalbe like to the triangle HKG, by the corollary of the 2. of the sixth. Wherfore either of these lines DN and NH shall be equal to the line DH, the greater segment of the line KH or FH. And forasmuch as the line FO is a parallel to the line HK, and the line OD to the line FH

But the triangles AOD, AFE, and ABM, are like the one to the other, and so also are the triangles ADN, AEH, and AMG, by the corollary of the secōd of the sixth

                  ¶ A Corollary.
                  
                     The side of an Icosahedron inscribed in an Octohedron, is the greater segment of the line, which being drawen from the angle of the base of the Octohedron cutteth the opposite side by an extreame and meane proportion. For, by the 16. of the fiuetenth, FKH is the base of the Octohedron, which containeth the base of the Icosahedron CDE: vnto which triangle FKH, the triangle HKG is equall, as hath bene proued. By the point H draw vnto the line ME a parallel line HT, cutting the line DN in the point S. Wherefore ES, DT, and ET, are parallelogrammes: and therefore the lines EH and MT are equall: and the lines EM and HT are like cut in the pointes D and S, by the 34. of the first. Wherefore the greater segment of the line HT is the line HS, which is equall to ED the side of the Icosahedron. But (by the 2. of the sixth) the line TK is cut like to the line HK by the parallel DM. And therefore (by the 2. of the fourtenth) it is diuided by an extreme and meane proportion. But the line TM is equall to the line EH. Wherefore also the line TK is equall to the line EF or DH. Wherefore the residues EH and TG are equall. For the whole lines FH and KG are equall. Wherefore KG the side of the triangle HKG is in the point T diuided by an extreme and meane proportion in the point T, by the right line HT, and the greater segment thereof is the line ED the side of the Icosahedron inscribed in the Octohedron, whose base is the triangle HKG (or the triangle FKH which is equall to the triangle HKG) by the 16. of the fiuetenth.
               
            
            
               ¶ The 5. Proposition. The side of a Pyramis diuided by an extreme and meane proportion, maketh the lesse segment in power double to the side of the Icosahedron inscribed in it.
               SVppose that ABG be the base of a pyramis:
                     Construction.
                   and let the base of the Icosahedron inscribed in it, be CDE, described of three right lines, which being drawen from the angles of the base ABG cut the opposite sides by an extreme and meane proportion, by the former Proposition: namely, of these three lines AM, BI, and GI. Then I say, that AI the lesse segment of the side A
                     •
                  , is in power duple to CE the side of the Icosahedron. For, forasmuch as by the former Proposition, it was proued that the triangle CDE is inscribed in an equilater triangle,
                     Demonstration.
                   whose angles cut the sides of

ABG the base of the pyramis by an extreme and meane proportion, let that triangle be FHK, cutting the line AB in the point F. Wherefore the lesse segment FA is equall to the segment AI, by the 2. of the fouretenth: (for the lines AB and AG are cut like). Moreouer the side FH of the triangle FHK is in the point D cut into two equall partes, as in the former Proposition it was proued, and FCED also by the same is a parallelogramme: Wherefore the lines CE and FD are equall, by the 33, of the first. And forasmuch as the line FH subtendeth the angle BAG of an equilater triangle, which angle is contained vnder the greater segment AH and the lesse segment AF
                     •
                   therefore the line FH is in power double to the line AF or to the line AI the lesse segment, by the Corollary of the 16. of the fiuetenth. But the same line FH is in power quadruple to the line CE, by the 4. of the second: (for the line FH is double to the line CE). Wherefore the line AI being the halfe of the square of the line FH is in power duple to the line CE, to which the line FH was in power quadruple. Wherefore the side AG of the pyramis being diuided by an extreme and meane proportion, maketh th
                     •
                   lesse segment AI in power duple to the side CE of the Icosahedron inscribed in it.
               
                  ¶ A Corollary.
                  
                     The side of an Icosahedron inscribed in a pyramis, is a residuall line. For the diameter of the Sphere which containeth the fiue regular bodies, being rationall, is in power sesquialtera to the side of the pyramis, by the 13. of the thirtenth: and therefore the side of the pyramis is rationall, by the definition: which side being diuided by an extreme and meane proportion, maketh

the lesse segment a residuall line, by the 6. of the thirtenth. Wherefore the side of the Icosahedron being commensurable to the same lesse segment (for the square of the side of the Icosahedron is the halfe of the square of the said lesse segment) is a residuall line, by that which was added after the 103. of the tenth booke.
               
            
            
               ¶The 6. Proposition. The side of a Cube containeth in power halfe the side of an equilater triangular Pyramis inscribed in the said Cube.
               FOr forasmuch as the side of the pyramis inscribed in the cube subtēdeth two sides of the cube which containe a right angle, by the 1. of the fiuetenth: it is manifest, by the 47. of the first, that the side of the pyramis subtēding the said sides, is in power duple to the side of the cube: Wherefore also the square of the side of the cube is the halfe of the square of the side of the pyramis. The side therefore of a cube containeth in power halfe the side of an equilater triangular pyramis inscribed in the said cube.
            
            
               ¶ The 7. Proposition. The side of a Pyramis is duple to the side of an Octohedron inscribed in it.
               FOrasmuch as by the 2. of the fiuetenth it was proued, that the side of the Octohedron inscribed in a pyramis coupleth the midle sections of the sides of the pyramis. Wherefore the sides of the pyramis and of the Octohedron are parallels, by the Corollary of the 39. of the first: and therefore, by the Corollary of the 2. of the sixth, they subtend like triangles. Wherfore (by the 4. of the sixth) the side of the pyramis is double to the side of the Octohedron, namely, in the proportion of the sides. The side therefore of a pyramis is duple to the side of an Octohedron inscribed in it.
            
            
               ¶ The 8. Proposition. The side of a Cube is in power duple to the side of an Octohedron inscribed in it.
               IT was proued in the 3. of the fiuetenth, that the diameter of the Octohedron inscribed in the cube, coupleth the centres of the opposite bases of the cube. Wherefore the said diameter is equall to the side of the cube. But the same is also the diameter of the square made of the sides of the Octohedron, namely, is the diameter of the Sphere which containeth it, by the 14. of the thirtenth. Wherefore that diameter being equall to the side of the cube, is in power double to the side of that square, or to the side of the Octohedron inscribed in it, by the 47. of the first. The side therefore of a Cube, is in power duple to the side of an Octohedron inscribed in it: which was required to be proued.
            
            
               ¶ The 9. Proposition. The side of a Dodecahedron, is the greater segment of the line which containeth in power halfe the side of the Pyramis inscribed in the sayd Dodecahedron.
               SVppose that of the Dodecahedron ABGD the side be AB: and let the base of the cube inscribed in the Dodecahedron be ECFH, by the 
                     ••
                   of the fiuetenth. And let the side of the pyramis inscribed in the cube be CH, by the 1. of the fiuetenth.
                     Construction.
                   Wherefore the same pyramis is inscribed in the Dodecahedron, by the 10. of the fiuetenth. Then I say, that AB the side of the Dodecahedron is the greater segment of the line which containeth in power halfe the line CH, which is the side of the pyramis inscribed in the

Dodecahedron.
                     Demonstration.
                   For forasmuch as EC the side of the cube being

diuided by an extreme and meane proportion maketh the greater segment the line AB, the side of the Dodecahedron, by the 
                     ••
                  rst Corollary of the 17. of the thirtenth: (For they are cont

Wherefore AB the side of the Dodecahedron, is the greater segment of the line EC, which containeth in power the halfe of the line CH, which is the side of the Dodecahedron inscribed in the pyramis. The side therefore of a Dodecahedron, is the greater segment of the line which containeth in power halfe the side of the Pyramis inscribed in the said Dodecahedron.
            
            
               ¶The 10. Proposition. The side of an Icosahedron, is the meane proportionall betwene the side of the Cube circumscribed about the Icosahedron, and the side of the Dodecahedron inscribed in the same Cube.
               SVppose that there be a cube ABFD, in which let there be inscribed an icosahedron CLIGOR, by the 14. of the fiuetenth.
                     Construction.
                   Let also the Dodecahedron inscribed in the same be EDMNPS, by the 13. of the same. Now forasmuch as CL the side of the Icosahedron is the greater segmēt of AB the side of the cube circumscribed about it, by the 3. Corollary of the 14. of the fiuetenth:
                     Demonstration.
                   and the side ED of the

Dodecahedrō inscribed in thesame cube is the lesse segmēt of the same side AB of the cube, by the 2. Corollary of the 13. of the fiuetenth: it followeth that AB the side of the cube being diuided by an extreme and meane proportion, maketh the greater segment CL the side of the Icosahedron inscribed in it, and the lesse segment ED the side of the Dodecahedron likewise inscrib
                     •
                  d in it. Wherefore as the whole line AB the side of the cube, is to the greater segment CL the side of the Icosahedron, so is the greater segment CL the side of the Icosahedron, to the lesse segment ED
                     •
                   the side of the Dodecahedron, by the third definition of the sixth. Wherefore the side of an Icosahedron, is the meane proportionall betwene the side of the cube circumscribed about the Icosahedron, and the side of the Dodecahedron inscribed in the same cube.
            
            
               ¶The 11. Proposition. The side of a Pyramis, is in power

               FOr, by that which was demonstrated in the 18. of the fiuetenth, the side of the pyramis is triple to the diameter of the base of the cube inscribed in it:
                     Demonstration.
                   and therefore it is in power nonecuple to the same diameter (by the 20. of the sixth). But the diamer is in power double to the side of the cube, by the 47. of the first. And the double of nonecuple maketh Octodecuple. Wherefore the side of the pyramis is in power Octodecuple to the side of the cube inscribed in it.
            
            
               ¶The 12. Proposition. The side of a Pyramis, is in power Octodecuple to that right line, whose

Wherfore the side of the pyramis is in power octodecuple to that right line, namely, to the side of the cube, whose greater segment is the side of the Dodecahedron inscribed in the pyramis.
            
            
               ¶ The 13. Proposition. The side of an Icosahedron inscribed in an Octohedron, is in power duple to the lesse segment of the side of the same Octohedron.
               FOrasmuch as in the 17. of the fiuetenth, it was proued, that the side of an Icosahedron inscribed in a pyramis, coupleth together the two sections (which are produced by an extreme and meane proportion) of the side of the Octohedron which make a right angle: and that right angle is contained vnder the lesse segmentes of the sides of the Octohedron, and is subtended of the side of the Icosahedron inscribed: it followeth therefore, that the side of the Icosahedron which subtendeth the right angle, being in power equall to the two lines which containe the said angle, by the 47. of the first, is in power duple to euery one of the lesse segmētes of the side of the Octohedron which containe a right angle.

               FOr forasmuch as it hath bene proued (by the 10. of this booke) that if frō the power of the diameter of the Icosahedrō be taken away the triple of the power of the side of the cube inscribed in it, there shalbe left a square sesquitertia to the square of the side of the Icosahedron: But the power of the side of the cube tripled, is the diameter of the same cube, by the 15. of the thirtēth: And the cube, &amp; the pyramis inscribed in it are contained in one &amp; the self same sphere, by the first of this booke, and in one &amp; the self same Icosahedron by the corollary of the same. Wherfore one and the selfe same diameter of the cube, or of the sphere which cōtaineth the cube and the pyramis, is in power sesquialter to the side of the pyramis by the 13. of the thirtenth. Wherfore it followeth, that if from the diameter of the Icosahedron, be taken away the triple power of the side of the cube, or the sesquialter power of the side of the pyramis, which are the powers of one and the selfe same diameter, there shall be left the sesquitertia power of the side of the Icosahedron. The diameter therefore of an Icosahedron is in power sesquitertia to the side of the same Icosahedron, and also is in power sesquialter to the side of the Pyramis inscribed in the Icosahedron.
            
            
               The 23. Proposition. The side of a Dodecahedron is to the side of an Icosahedron inscribed in it, as the lesse segment of the perpendicular of the Pentagō, is to that line which is drawne from the centre to the side of the same pentagon.

                   pentagon of the dodecahedron, it shall cut the line FC by an extreme and meane proportion, by the 3. of this booke, let it cut it in the poynt I. And forasmuche as the line KL is the side of the Icosahedron inscribed in the Dodecahedron, it coupleth the cētres of the bases of the dodecahedron: for the angles of the Icosahedron are set in the centres of the bases of the dodecahedron, by the 7. of the fiuetenth. Now I say that SO, the side of the dodecahedron is to KL the side of the Icosahedron, as the lesse segment IF of the perpendicular line CF, is to the line LC which is drawne from the centre L to AS the side of the pentagon. For forasmuch as in the triangle BCF the two sides CB and CF are in the centres L and K cut like proportionally,
                     Demonstration.
                   the lines BF and KL shalbe parellels, by the 2. of the sixth. Wherefore the triangles BCF, and KCL shall be equiangle, by the corollary of the same. Wherfore as the line CL is to the line KL

                   BF maketh the lesse segment the line SO, namely, the side of the Dodecahedron, by the 2. corollary of the 13. of the fiuetenth. For the line BF which coupleth the angles B and F of the bases of the dodecahedron, is equall to the side of the cube, which contayneth the dodecahedron, (by the .13. of the fiuetenth). Wherefore as the whole line C

But as the line CF is to the line BF, so is the line CL proued to be to the line KL. Wherefore as the line IF is to the line SO, so is the line CL to the line KL. Wherefore alternately by the 16. of the fiueth, as the line IF the lesse segment of the perpendicular of the pentagon FAS, is to the line LC which is drawne from the centre of the pentagon, to the base, so is the line SO the side of the Dodecahedron to th

And vpon the sides of the pentagon, let there be reared vp triangles, making a solide angle of the Icosahedron at the poynt I, by the 16. of the thirtenth. And in the circle ABD, inscribe an equilater triangle AHK. From the centre E drawe to HK the side of the triangle, and GD the side of the pentagon, a perpendicular line, which let be ECNM. And draw these right lines EG, ED, IG and ID. And deuide the line BG into two equal parts in the poynt T. And

drawe these lines IN, IT, TN, ET. And

forasmuche as in the perpendiculars IT &amp; IN are the centres of the circles which containe the equilater triangles IBG, &amp; IGD, by the corollarye of the first of the thirde. Let those centres be the points S and O. And draw the line SO. Deuide the line TB the half of BG the side of the Icosahedron by an extreme and meane proportion in the poynt R, by the 30. of the sixth, and let the lesse segment therof be RB. And forasmuch as the line SO coupleth the centres of the triangles IBG, &amp; IGD, it is by the 5. of the fiuetenth, the side of the Dodecahedrō inscribed in the Icosahedron, whose side is the line BG. From the side BG take away

                  R the lesse segment of the halfe side. And from the residue GR take away the third part GV (by the 9. of the sixth.) Then I say that the residue RV is equal to SO the side of the Dodecahedron inscribed.
                     Demonstration.
                   For forasmuch as the perpendicular EN is in the poynt C deuided by an extreme and meane proportion, by the corollary of the first of the fourtenth, and the greater segment therof is the line EC, and vnto the line EC the line CM is equal, by the corollary of the 12. of the thirtenth: wherefore the line EC is to the line CN, as the line CM is to the same line CN, by the 7. of the fiueth. But as the line EC is to the line CN, so is the whole line

                  N, to the greater segment EC, by the 3. diffinition of the sixth. Wherefore (by the 11. of the fiueth), as the whole line EN is to the greater segment EC, so is the line CM to the line CN. Wherefore the line CM, is deuided by an extreme and meane proportion in the poynt N, namely, is deuided like vnto the line EN, by the 2. of the fourtenth. Wherfore the line EM excedeth the line EN by the lesse segment of his halfe, namely, by MN. And forasmuche as EGD is the triangle of an equilater and equiangle pentagon ABGDF, and ETN is likewise the triangle of the like pentagon inscribed in the pentagon ABGDF: Therefore by the 20. of the sixth, the triangle ETN is like to the triangle EGD
                     •
                   Wherefore as the line EG is to the line EN, so by the 4. of the sixth, is the line GD to the line NT. Wherefore the line GD (or BG which is equal vnto it) excedeth the line NT by the lesse segment of the halfe of BG. For the line EG did in like sort excede the line EN. But that lesse segment is the line BR. Wherefore the residue RG is equal to the line TN. And forasmuch as IBG is an equilater triangle: the perpendicular ST shalbe the halfe of the line SI which is drawne from the centre, by the corollary of the 12. of the thirtenth: wherfore the line IT excedeth the line IS by his third part. And forasmuche as the line SO which coupleth the sections, is a parallel to the line TN, by the 2. of the sixth. For the equal perpendiculars IT, and IN are cut like in the poynts S &amp; O: therfore the triangles ITN &amp; I
                     •
                  O, are like by the corollary of the second of the sixth. Wherfore as the line IT is to the line IS, so by the 4. of the sixth is the line TN to the line SO. But the line IT excedeth the line IS by a third part: wherfore the line TN, excedeth the line SO by a third part: but the line TN is proued equal to the line RG. Wherfore the line RG excedeth the line SO by a third part of himself, which is GV. Wherfore the residue RV, is equal to the line SO, which is the side of the dodecahedron inscribed in the Icosahedron, whose side is the line BG. If therfore halfe of the side of an Icosahedrō, be deuided by an extreme &amp; meane proportion: and if the lesse segment therof be taken away from the whole side, and againe from the residue be takē away the third part: that which remaineth shall be equal to the side of the dodecahedron inscribed in the same Icosahedron.
            
            
               The 25. Proposition. To proue that a cube geuen, is to a trilater equilater pyramis inscribed in it, triple.
               SVppose that the cube geuen, be ABCH: and let the pyramis inscribed in it be AGDF. Then I say that the cube ABCH is triple to the pyramis AGDF. For forasmuche as the base AFD is common to the pyramis AFDB and AFDG, the pyramis AFDB shalbe set without the pyramis AFDG. Likewise the rest of the bases of the inscribed pyramis are common to the rest of the pyramids sorte without: which are these: the pyramis AGDC vppon

the base AGD: the pyramis AGF
                     •

and the pyramis GDFH vpon the base GDF. Which pyramids taken without, are foure in number, equal and like the one to the other, by the

                   halfe squares of the cube, and one of the bases of the pyramis inscribed. Wherfore euery one of thē is cōtained vnder the halfe base of the cube, &amp; the altitude of the cube. As the pyramis ALGF, hath to his base halfe of the square EH, namely, the triangle EGF, &amp; hath to his altitude, the altitude of the cube, namely, the line AE. Wherfore the sayd pyramis is the sixth part of the cube. For if the cube be deuided into two prismes, by the plaine CBFG, the prisme ACBGEF, shalbe triple to the pyramis AEGF, hauing one &amp; the selfe same base with it EGF, and one and the selfe same altitude EA, by the first corollary of the 7. of the twelueth. Wherefore the sayd outward pyramis AEGF is the sixth part of the whole cube. Wherfore also the same pyramis together wyth the other thre outwarde pyramids AFDB, AGDC, and GDFH, 
                     •
                  hal containe two third partes of the cube. Wherfore the residue, namely, the pyramis inscribed AGDF, shal contain one third part of the cube. And therefore conuersedly the cube shall be triple to it: wherefore we haue proued 
                     •
                  hat a cube geuē triple to a trilater &amp; equilater pyramis inscribed in it.
            
            
               ¶The 26. Proposition. To proue that a trilater equilater Pyramis is duple to an Octohedron inscribed in it.
               LEt there be taken a trilater Pyramis ABCD: whose sixe sides let be cut into two equall partes, in the pointes E, K, F, L, G, and H

                   inscribing thereby an Octohedron in the pyramis, by the 2. of the fiuetenth. Wherefore the pyramids AEGH, BEFK, CFGL, &amp; DKHL, fall without the Octohedron inscribed, by the same second of the fiuetenth. But the outward Pyramids (namely, AEGH, and the three other) are like vnto the whole pyramis, by the 7. definition of the eleuenth. For the bases of the whole pyramis are by parallel lines drawen in them cut into like triangles, by the Corollary of the 2. of the sixth, of which the foresayd pyramids

are made. Wherefore the whole pyramis is to euery one of them in treble proportion of that in which the sides of like proportion are, by the 8. of the twelfth. But by construction, the proportion of the side A
                     •
                   to the side A
                     •
                   is duple. Wherefore the whole pyramis ABCD is octuple to the pyramis AEGH, and so is it to euery one of the pyramids which are equall to AEGH. For duple proportion multiplyed into it selfe twise maketh octuple. Wherefore it followeth that the 4. pyramids AEGH, 
                     •
                  EFK, CFGL, and DKHL, taken together, make the halfe of the whole pyramis ABCD. Wherefore the residue, namely, the Octohedron EGLKHF, is the other half of the pyramis. Wherfore the pyramis is duple to the Octohedron. Wherefore we haue proued that a trilater equilater pyramis is duple to an Octohedron inscribed in it.
            
            
               ¶ The 27. Proposition. To proue that a Cube is sextuple to an Octohedron inscribed in it.
               
                  LEt there be taken a cube ABCD, EFGH: whose 4. standing lines AE, BF, CH, &amp; DG, let be cut into two equall partes in the pointes I, K, M, L: and
                     •
                   by those pointes let there be extended a plaine KLMI: which shall be a square, and parallel to the squares BC &amp; FH, by the 15. of the eleuenth. Wherefore in it shall be the base which is common to the two pyramids of the Octohedron inscribed in the cube, by that which was demonstrated in the third of the fiuetenth. Let that base be NPRQ, coupling

the centres of the bases of the cube: and vpon that base let be set the two pyramids of the Octohedron, which let be NPQRS, and NPQRT. And forasmuch as those two pyramids taken together, haue their altitude equall with the altitude of the whole cube,
                     Demonstration.
                   ech of them a part hath to his alt

                  ude halfe the altitude of the cube, namely, halfe of the side of the cube, as the line KB. And forasmuch as the square KLMI is double to the square NRQP, by the 47. of the first: the other squares of the cube shall also be double to the square NRQP. And forasmuch as the cube, as it was manifest by the last of the fiuetenth, is resolued into sixe pyramids, whose bases are the bases of the cube, &amp; the altitudes the lines drawen frō the centre to the bases, which are equall to halfe the side of the cube
                     •
                   it followeth that euery one of the sixe pyramids of the cube, hauing his base double to the base of eche of the pyramids of the Octohedron, and the selfe same altitude that the said pyramids of the Octohedrō haue, is double to either of the pyramids of the octohedrō, by the 6. of the twelfth. And forasmuch as euery one of the pyramids of the cube is equall to the two pyramids of the Octohedron, the sixe pyramids of the cube shall be sextuple to the whole Octohedron. Wherefore it is manifest, that a cube is sextuple to an Octohedron inscribed in it.
            
            
               ¶The 28. Proposition. To proue that an Octohedron is quadruple sesquialter to a Cube inscribed in it.
               SVppose that the Octohedron geuen be ABCDEF: and let the cube inscribed in it be GHIK, VQRS. Then I say, that the Octohedron is quadruple sesquialter to the cube inscribed in it. Forasmuch as the lines drawen from the centre of the Octohedron, or of the Sphere which containeth it, vnto the centres of the bases of the Octohedron, are proued equall, by the 21. of the fiuetenth: and the angles of the cube are set in the centres of those bases, by the 4. of the fiuetenth: it followeth, that the selfe same right lines are drawen from one and the selfe same centre of the cube and of the Octohedron: for they haue eche one and the selfe same centre, by the Corollary of the 21. of the fiuetenth. Let that centre be the point T. Wherefore the base BDFC, which cutteth the Octohedron into two equall and quadrilater pyramids, by the Corollary of the 14. of the thirtenth, shall also cut the cube into two equall partes, by the Corollary of the 39. of the eleuenth. For it passeth by the centre T, by that which was demonstrated in the 14. of the thirtenth. And forasmuch as the base of the cube is in the 4. centres G, H, I, K, of the bases of the pyramis ABDFC, a plaine LNOM, extended by those pointes, shall be parallel to the plaine BDFC, by that which was demonstrated in the 4. of the fiuetenth, and shall cut the pyramis in the pointes L, N, O, M: and the lines LN, BD, and NO, DF, shall be parallels, so also shall the lines OM, FC, and LM, BC: and the square GHIK of the cube shall be inscribed in the square LNOM, by the same. Wherefore the square LNOM is duple to the square GHIK, by the 47. of the first. From the solide angle A, let there be drawen to the plaine superficies BDFC, a perpendicular, which let fall vppon it in the point T, and let the same perpendicular be AT, cutting the plaine LNOM in the point P. And it shall also be a perpendicular to the plaine LNOM, by the Corollary of the 14. of the eleuenth. Againe from the angle BAD of the triangle ADB, let there be drawen by the centre H of the triangle, to the base a line AHX. Wherefore the line AX is sesquialter to the line AH, by the Corollary of the 12. of the thirtenth. Wherefore the line AH is duple to the line HX. But the other lines AB, AD, AF, AC, and the perpendicular APT, are cut like vnto the line AHX, by the 17. of the eleuenth: Wherefore the line AP is double to the line PT. Wherefore the line AP is the altitude of the cube, for the line PT is the halfe thereof.

And forasmuch as vpon the base

GHIK of the cube, and vnder the altitude AP of the same cube, is set the pyramis AGHIK: the said pyramis is the third part of the cube, by the Corollary of the 7. of the twelfth. But vnto the pyramis AGHIK the pyramis ALNOM is duple, by the 6. of the twelfth, for the base of the one is double to the base of the other. Wherefore the pyramis ALNOM is two third partes of the cube. And forasmuch as the pyramids ALNOM, and ABDFC, are like, by the 7. definition of the eleuenth: therefore they are in triple proportion of that in which the sides of like proportion AH to AX, or AL to AB, are, by the Corollary of the 8. of the twelfth. But the side AB is proued to be sesquialter to the side AL. Wherefore the pyramis ABCDF is to pyramis ALNOM, as 27. is to 8. (that is, in sesquialter proportion tripled: for the quantitie or denomination of sesquialter proportion, namely, 1 ½ multiplied into it selfe once maketh 2¼, which againe multiplyed by 1½ maketh 3 1/
                     •
                  , that is, 27. to 8.). But of what partes the pyramis ALNOM containeth 8, of the same the cube containeth 12: namely, is sesquialter to the pyramis. Wherefore of what partes the cube containeth 12, of the same the whole Octohedron (which is double to the pyramis ABDFC) containeth 54. Which 54. hath to 12. quadruple sesquialter proportion. Wherefore the whole Octohedron is to the cube inscribed in it, in quadruple sesquialter proportion. Wherefore we haue proued that an Octohedron geuen is quadruple sesquialter to a cube inscribed in it.
               
                  ¶A Corollary.
                  
                     An Octohedron is to a cube inscribed in it, in that proportion that the squares of their sides are. For by the 14. of this booke, the side of the Octohedron is in power quadruple sesquialter to the side of the cube inscribed in it.

there be inscribed a cube FCED, by the 4. of the fiuetenth, and in the cube let there be inscribed a pyramis FEGD, by the 
                     •
                  . of the fiuetenth. And forasmuche as the angles of the pyramis are (by the same first of the fiuetenth) set in the angles of the cube: and the angles of the cube are set in the centres of the bases of the Octohedron, namely, in the poyntes F, E, C, D, G by the 4. of the fiuetenth. Wherfore the angles of the pyramis, are set in the centres F, C, E, D of the octohedron. Wherefore the pyramis FEDG is inscribed in the octohedron (by the 6. of the fiuetenth.) And forasmuche as the octohedron

AB is to the cube FCED, inscribed in it quadruple

sesquialter (by the former propositiō): and the cube CDEF is to the pyramis FEDG inscribed in it triple, by the 25. of booke: wherefore three magnitudes being geuen, namely, the octohedron, the cube and the pyramis, the proportion of the extremes (namely, of the octohedron to the piramis) is made of the proportions of the meanes, (namely, of the octohedron to the cube, and of the cube to the pyramis,) as it is easie to see by the declaration vpon the 10. diffinition of the fiueth. Now then multiplying the quantities or denominations of the proportions (namely, of the octohedron to the cube which is 4 1/
                     •
                  , and of the cube to the pyramis, which is 3) as was taught in the diffinition of the sixth, there shalbe produced 13 1/
                     •
                  , namely, the proportion of the octohedron to the pyramis inscribed in it. For 4 ½, multiplyed by 3. produce 13 ½. Wherefore the Octohedron is to the pyramis inscribed in it in tredecuple sesquialter proportion. Wherefore we haue proued that an Octohedron is to a trilater equilater pyramis inscribed in it, in tredecuple sesquialter proportion.
            
            
               ¶ The 30. Proposition. To proue that a trilater equilater Pyramis, is noncuple to a cube inscribed in it.
               SVppose that the pyramis geuen, be ABCD, whose two bases let be ABC, and DBC, and let their centres be the poynts G and I. And from the angle A, draw vnto the base BC a perpendicular AE: likewise from the angle D draw vnto the same base BC, a perpendicular DE: and they shal concurre in the section E by the 3. of the third and in them shalbe the cētres G and I, by the corollary of the first of the third. And forasmuch as the line AD is the side of the pyramis, the same AD shall be the diameter of the base of the cube which cōtaineth the pyramis, by the 1 of the fiuetēth.
                     Demonstration.
                  
                  
Draw the line GI. And forasmuch as the line GI coupleth the centre
                     •
                   of the bases of the pyramis: the saide line GI shalbe the diameter of the base of the cube inscribed in the pyramis by the 18. of the fiuetenth. And forasmuche as the line AG is double to the line GE, by the corollarye of the twelueth of the thirtenth: the whole line AE shal be triple to the line GE: and so is also the line DE to the line IE. Wherefore the lines AD and GI are parallels, by the 2. of the sixth. And therefore the triangles AED, and GEI are like
                     •
                   by the corollary of the same. And forasmuch as the triangles AED, and GEI are like, the line AD
                     •
                   shalbe triple to the line GI, by the 4. of the sixth. But the line AD is the diameter of the base of the cube circumscribed about the pyramis ABCD, and the line GI is the diameter of the base of the cube inscribed in the pyramis ABCD: but the diameters of the bases are equemultiplices to the sides (namely, are in power duple). Wherfore the side of the cube circumscribed about the pyramis ABCD, is triple to the side of the cube, inscribed in the same piramis, by the 15. of the fiueth: but like cubes are in triple proportion the one to the other of that in which their sides are, by the 33. of the eleuenth: and the sides are in triple proportion the one to the other: Wherfore triple taken thre times bringeth forth twenty seuencuple, which is 27. to 1: for the 4. termes 27.9.3.1, being set in triple proportion: the proportion of the first to the fourth, namely, of 27. to 1. shalbe triple to the proportion of the first to the second, namely, of 27. to 9, by the 10. diffinition of the fiueth: which proportion of 27. to 1. is the proportiō of the sides tripled, which proportiō also is found in like solides. Wherefore of what partes the cube circumscribed containeth 27. of the same, the cube inscribed containeth one: but of what partes the cube circumscribed, containeth 27. of the same, the pyramis inscribed in it, containeth 9. by the 25. of this booke: wherfore of what partes the pyramis AB CD containeth 9. of the same, the cube inscribed in the pyramis, containeth one. Wherefore we haue proued that a trilater and equilater pyramis, is non

                  cuple to a cube inscribed in it.
            
            
               
               ¶ The 31. Proposition. An Octohedron hath to an Icosohedron inscribed in it, that proportion, which two bases of the Octohedron haue to fiue bases of the Icosahedron.
               SVppose that the octohedron geuen be ABCD, and let the Icosahedron inscribed in it, be FGHMKLIO. Then I say that the octohedron is to the Icosahedron, as two bases of the octohedron, are to fiue bases of the Icosahedron. For forasmuche as the solide of the octohedron consisteth of eight pyramids, set vpon the bases of the octohedron,
                     Demonstration.
                   and hauing to theyr altitude a perpendicular line drawne from the centre to the base: let that perpendicular be ER, or ES, being drawne from the centre E (which centre is common to either of the solides, by the corollary of the 21. of the fiuetenth) to the centres of the bases, namely, to the poyntes R and S. Wherefore for that thre pyramids are equal and like, they shalbe equal to a prisme set vpon the selfe same base, and vnder the selfe same altitude, by the corollary of the seuenth of the twelueth. But vnto this prisme is double that prisme which is set vpon the self same base, and hath his altitude duple, namely, the whole line RS by the corollary of the 25. of the eleuenth: for it is equal to the two equal and like prismes whereof it is composed. Wherfore the prisme set vpō the base of the octohedron, and hauing to his altitude the line RS is equal to six pyramids, set vpon six bases of the Octohedron, and hauing to their altitude the line ER. So there remaine two pyramids (for in the octohedron are 8. bases) which shall be equal to the prisme which is set vpon the third part of the base of the octohedron, and vnder the altitude RS. For prismes vnder one and the selfe same altitude, are in proportion the one to the other, as are their bases, by the corollary of the 7 of the

twelueth. Wherefore the two prismes which are set vppon the base of the octohedron, and vpon a third part therof, and vnder the altitude RS, are equal to the 8. pyramids of the Octohedron, or to the whole solide of the octohedron. And forasmuch as the Icosahedron inscribed in the octohedron, hathe his bases set in the bases of the Octohedron, by the 17. of the fiuetenth: it followeth that the pyramids set vppon the bases of the Icosahedron, &amp; hauing to their toppes one and the selfe same centre E, are contained vnder the selfe same altitude, that the pyramids of the octohedron are cōtained vnder. namely, vnder the line ER, or ES. And therefore a prisme, set vpon the base of the Icosahedron, and hauing his altitude double to the altitude of the pyramis, namely, the whole line RS, is equal to sixe pyramids set vpon the base of the Icosahedron, and vnder the altitude ER or ES, as we haue proued in the octohedron. Wherfore the 20. pyramids, set vpon the 20. bases of the Icosahedron, are equal to thre prismes set vpon the base of the Icosahedron, and vnder the altitude RS, and moreouer to an other prisme set vppon a thirde part of the base of the Icosahedron and vnder the same altitude RS, which prisme is a thirde part of the former prisme, by the corollarye of the 7. of the twelueth: for their proportion is as the proportion of the bases. Wherfore two prismes set vpon the base of the octohedron, and a third part therof, and vnder the altitude RS, is to 4. prismes set vpon three bases of the Icosahedron, and a third part thereof, and vnder the same altitude RS, in the same proportion that the bases are, that is, as 4. third partes of the base of the Octodron (which are equal to one base, and 1/
                     •
                  ;) to ten third partes of the base of the Icosahedron (which are equal to thre bases &amp; 1/
                     •
                  ;) or as two third partes of the base of the Octohedron, are to fiue thirde partes of the base of the Icosahedron. But two thirde partes of the base of the Octohedron, are to fiue thirde partes of the base of the Icosahedron, as two bases are to fiue bases (by the 15. of the fifth, for they are partes of equemultiplices:) And two prismes of the Octohedron are to 4. prismes of the Icosahedron, as the solide of the Octohedron is to the solide of the Icosahedron, when as eche are equal to eche of the solides: Wherefore (by the 
                     ••
                  . of the fiueth) the solide of the Octohedron, is to the solide of the Icos
                     •
                  hedron inscribed in it, as two bases of the Octohedron, are to fiue bases of the Icosahedron. An Octohedron

therfore is to an Ico

               FOrasmuch as by the 17. of the thirtenth, and 8. of the fiuetenth, it w

                   let that base of the cube be ABCD: and let the side wherat 4. bases of the dodecahedron circumscribed concurre, be EG: which shall contayne a solide AEBDGC set vpon the base ABCD. Diuide the sides AB and DC into two equall partes in the poyntes L and N. And draw the line LN, which is a parallel to the side EG, as it was manifest by the 17. of the thirtenth. The perpendiculars also ER and GO which couple those parallels, are eche equall, to halfe of the side EG, and eche is the greater segment of halfe the side of the cube, and therefore the whole line EG is the greater segment of the whole line LN the side of the cube (by the foresayd 17. of the thirtenth). By the poyntes R and O, draw vnto the sides AB and CD parallel lines FH and IK. And draw these right lines EF, EH, GI and GK. Now forasmuch as the two lines FH &amp; ER touching the one the other are parallels to the two lines IK and GO touching also the one the other,
                     Demonstration.
                   &amp; not being in the selfe same playne with the two first lines: therfore the playne super

                  icieces EFH and GIK passing by those lines are parallels, by the 15. of the eleuenth: which playnes do cutte the solide AEBDGC. Whererefore there are made fower quadrangled pyramids set vpon the rectangle parallelogrames LH, LF, NK, and NI, and hauing their toppes the poyntes E and G. And forasmuch as the triangles GOK and ERH are equall and like, by the 4. of the first, namely,
                     Extend in the figure a line

                   they contayne

equall angles comprehēded vnder equall sides, and they are parallels by construction, being set in the playnes GIK and EFH: the figures GKHE, OKHR, and GORE shall be parallelogrammes, by the di

                  nition of a parallelogramme, and therefore the solide GOKERH is a prisme, by the 11. diffinition of the eleuenth. And by the same reason may the solide GOIERF be proued to be a prisme. And forasmuch as vpon equall bases NOKC, and RLBH, and vnder equall altitudes OG and RE are set pyramids: those pyramids shall be equall to 
                     •
                  hat pyramis which is set vpon the

                  ase CKID (which is double to either of the bases NOKC, and RLBH) and vnder the same altitude OG, by the 6. of the twelfth. And forasmuch as the side GE is the greater segment of the line CB, the line KH, which by the 33. of the first, is equall to the line GE, shall be the greater segment of the same line CB, by the 2. of the fourtenth. Wherefore the residues CK and HB shall make the lesse segment of the whole line CB. But as the greater segment KH is to the two lines CK and HB the lesse segment, so is the rectangle parallelogramme OH to the two rectangle parallelogrammes OC and HL, by the 1. of the sixt. Wherfore the lesse segment of the parallelogramme NB, shall be the two parallelogrammes OC and HL. Put the line KM double to the line KC and draw the line MS parallel to the line CN. Wherefore the parallelogramme OKMS is equall to the parallelogrammes OC and HL, by the 1. of the sixth. Wherfore the pyramis set vpon the base OKMS contayneth two third partes of the prisme set vpon the selfe same base, by the 4. corollary of the 7. of the twelfth. Wherfore the prisme which is set vpon two third

partes of the base OKMS is equall to the two pyramids NOKCG and RLBHE. For the sections of a prisme are one to the other, as the sections of the base are, by the first corollary of the 25. of the eleuenth. But the sections of the base are as the sections of the line CB or KM, by the 1. of the sixt. Wherfore the two pyramids NOKCG and RLBHE, adde vnto the prisme GOKERH two third partes of the prisme set vpon the base OKMS. And forasmuch as the line KM is the lesse segmēt of the whole line BC (for it is equall to to the two lines CK and H
                     •
                  ), and the prisme set vpon the base OKHR is cutte like vnto the line KM, namely, in eche are taken two thirdes, as hath before bene proued: the prisme equall to the two pyramids, shall adde vnto the prisme GOKERH, which is set vpon the greater segment KH, two th

                  ds of the lesse segment. Wherefore in the line BC there shall remayne one third part of the lesse segment: and therefore in the rectangle parallelogramme NB which is halfe the base of the cube, there shall remayne the same third part of the lesse segment. And by the same reason may we proue that in the other pyramids ONDIG, and RLAFE, and in the prisme GOIERF is left the selfe same excesse of the base LAND, namely, the third part of the lesse segment. Wherefore the whole prisme contayned betwene the triangles IGK and FEH, and vnder the length of the greater

segment and two third partes of the lesse segment of BC the side of the cube, is equall to the solide composed of 4. bases of the dodecahedron and set vpon the base of the cube. Wherfore the base of that prisme wanteth of the whole base of the cube onely a third part of the lesse segment: and the altitude of that prisme was the line GO, which is the greater segment of halfe the side of the cube. And forasmuch as vnto the triangle IGK, is double the rctangle parallelogramme set vpon the same base IK, (the side of the cube) and vnder the altitude GO, by the 41. of the first: it followeth that three rectangle parallelogrammes set vpon the same base IK, the side of the cube, and vnder the altitude OG the greater segment of halfe the side of the cube, are sextuple to the triangle IGK. Wherefore those three rectangle parallelogrammes doo make one rectangle parallelogramme set vpon the base IK and vnder the altitude of the line GO tripled. But by the 7. diffinition of the eleuenth, there are sixe prismes equal and like vnto the foresayd prisme, being set vpon euery one of the sixe bases of the cube: which prismes are in proportion the one to the other as their bases are by the 3. corollary of the 7. of twelfth. Wherefore the solide composed of these sixe prismes, shall want of the base ABCD the third part of the lesse segment, and taking his altitude of the foresayd rectangle parallelogramme, the sayd altitude shall be equall to three greater segmentes (one of which is GO) of halfe the side of the cube.
               Now resteth to proue that these three segmentes want of the side of the cube by the lesse segment of the lesse segment of halfe the sid
                     •
                   of the cube. Suppose that AB the side of the cube be diuided into the greater segment AC, and into the lesse segment CB (by the 30. of the sixt). And diuide into two equall partes the line AC in the poynt G, and the line CB in the poynt E. And vnto the line CG put the line CL equall. Now forasmuch as the lines AG and GC are the greater seg

                  tes of halfe the line AB, for

                  che of

them is the halfe of the greater segment of the whole line AB: the lines EB and EC shall be the lesse segmentes of halfe the line AB. Wherefore the whole line C
                     •
                   is the greater segment, and the line CE

is the lesse segment. But as the line CL is to the line CE, so is the line CE to the residue EL. Wherfore the line EL is the greater segment of the line CE, or of the line EB which is equall vnto it. Wherfore the residue LB is the lesse segment of the same EB (which is the les
                     •
                  e segment of half
                     •
                   the side of the cube). But the lines AG, GC, and CL are three greater segmentes of the halfe of the whole line AB: which thre greater segmentes make the altitude of the foresayd solide: wherefore the altitude of the sayd solide wanteth of AB the side of the cube by the line LB, which is the lesse s
                     •
                  gment of the line BE. Which line BE agayne is the lesse segment of halfe the side AB of the cube. Wherefore the foresayd solide consisting of the sixe solides, whereby the dodecahedron exceedeth the cube inscribed in it, is set vpon a base which wanteth of the base of the cube by a third part of the lesse segment, and is vnder an altitude wanting of the side of the cube by the lesse segment of the lesse segment of halfe the side of the cube. The solide therefore of a dodecahedron exceedeth the solide of a cube inscribed in it, by a parallelipipedon, whose base wanteth of the base of the cube by a third part of the lesse segment, and whose altitude wanteth of the altitude of the cube, by the lesse segment of the lesse segment of halfe the side of the cube.
               
                  ¶A Corollary.
                  
                     A Dodecahedron is double to a Cube inscribed in it, taking away the third part of the lesse segment of the cube, and moreouer the lesse segment of the lesse segment of halfe of that excesse. For if there be geuen a cube, from which is cut of a solide set vpon a third part of the lesse segment of the base and vnder one and the same altitude with the cube: that solide taken away hath to the whole solide the proportion of the section of the base to the base, by the 32. of the eleuenth.

Farther, forasmuch as the residue wanteth of the altitude of the cube, by the lesse segment of the lesse segment of halfe the altitude or side, and that residue is a parallelipipedon, if it be cut by a plaine superficies parallel to the opposite plaine superficieces, cutting the altitude of the cube by a point, it shall take away from that parallelipipedon a solide, hauing to the whole the proportion of the section to the altitude, by the 3. Corollary of the 25. of the eleuenth. Wherefore the excesse wanteth of the same cube by the thi

                   by suppositiō, the diameter DE shalbe equal to the line KH, by the 7. of the fiuetenth.

               The 35. Proposition. The solide of a Dodecahedron containeth of a Pyramis circumscribed about it two ninth partes, taking away a third part of one ninth part of the lesse segment (of a line diuided by an extreme and meane proportion) and moreouer the lesse segment of the lesse segment of halfe the residue.
               IT hath bene proued that the Dodecahedron, together with the cube inscribed in it is contained in one and the selfe same pyramis, by the Corollary of the first of this booke. And by the Corollary of the 33. of this booke, it is manifest, that the Dodecahedron is double to the same cube, taking away the third part of the lesse segment, and moreouer the lesse segment of the lesse segment of halfe the residue, or of this excesse. But a pyramis is to the same cube inscribed in it nonecuple, by the 30. of this booke. Wherefore the Dodecahedron inscribed in the pyramis, and containing the same cube twise, taking away the selfe same third of the lesse segment, and moreouer the lesse segment of the lesse segment of halfe the residue, shall containe two ninth partes of the solide of the pyramis (of which ninth partes eche is equall vnto the cube) taking away this selfe same excesse. The solide therefore of a Dodecahedron containeth of a Pyramis circumscribed about it two ninth partes, taking away a third part of one ninth part of the lesse segment (of a line diuided by an extmere and meane proportion) and moreouer the lesse segment of the lesse segment of halfe the residue.

                   KH is in power duple to either of the sides AH and AK: and either of the lines AH, AK, or EF, FG, is in power duple to eyther of the lines AZ or ZK which cōtayne a right angle, made in the triangle or base AHK by the perpendicular AZ. Wherfore it followeth that the side GE or HK, is in power quadruple to the triangle EFG or AHK. But the pyramis KEFG, hauing his base EFG in the plaine FLBP of the Octohedron, shall haue to his altitude the perpendicular KO (by the 4. definition of the sixth) which is the greater segment of the semidiameter of the Octohedron, by the 16. of the fiuetenth. Wherfore three pyramids set vnder the same altitude and vpon equall bases, shall be equall to one prisme set vpon the same base, and vnder the same altitude, by the 1. Corollary of the 7. of the twelfth. Wherefore 4. prismes set vpon the base GEF quadrupled (which is equall to the square of the side GE) and vnder the altitude KO (or RZ the greater segment which is equall to KO) shall containe a solide equall to the twelue pyramids, which twelue pyramids make the excesse of the Octohedron aboue the Icosahedron inscribed in it. An Octohedron therefore excedeth an Icosahedron inscribed in it, by a parallelipipedon set vpon the square of the side of the Icosahedron, and hauing to his altitude the line which is the greater segment of halfe the semidiameter of the Octohedron.
               
                  
                  ¶ A Corollary.
                  
                     A Pyramis exceedeth the double of an Icosahedron inscribed in it, by a solide, set vpon the square of the side of the Icosahedron inscribed in it, and hauing to his altitude that whole line of which the side of the Icosahedron is the greater segmēt. For it is manifest by the 19. of the fiuetēth, that an octohedrō &amp; an Icosahedrō inscribed in it are inscribed in one &amp; the self same pyramis. It hath moreouer bene proued in the 26. of this boke, that a pyramis is double to an octohedrō inscribed in it. Wherfore the two excesses of the two octohedrons (vnto which the pyramis is equal) aboue the two Icosahedrons (inscribed in the said two octohedrons) being brought into an solide, the said solide shalbe set vpon the selfe same square of the side of the Icosahedron, and shall haue to his altitude the perpendicular KO doubled: whose double coupling the opposite sides HK and XM maketh the greater segment the same side of the Icosahedron, by the first and second corollary of the 14. of the fiu

               The 37. Proposition. If in a triangle hauing to his base a rational line set, the sides be commensurable in power to the base, and from the toppe be drawn to the base a perpendicular line cutting the base: The sections of the base shall be commensurable in length to the whole base, and the perpendicular shall be commensurable in power to the said whole base.
               SVppose that there be a triangle ABG, whose base BG let be a rational line set of purpose. And let the sides AB and AG be vnto the same BG commensurable at the least in power.
                     Construction.
                   And from the toppe A, draw vnto the base BG, a perpendicular, cutting the base in the point P. Then I say that the sections of the base, are commensurable in lengthe to the whole line BG, and that the perpendicular AP, is vnto the same base BG cōmensurable at the least in power. Produce on either side the line BG to the poyntes C and E. And vnto the line AG put the line GE equal, and vnto the line AB put the line BC equal. And vpon the lines CB, BG and GE describe squares BK, BD, and GL. And from the greater of the squares of the lines AB or AG, which let be GL cut of a parallelogramme EM equal to the lesse square BK (by the 45. of the first:) And (by the same) vnto the residue GM, let there be applied vpon the line GD an equall rectangle parallelogramme OD.
                     First part of the demonstration.
                   Now forasmuch as the angles APB and APG are right angles, therfore (by the 47. of the first) the line AG containeth in power the two lines AP and PG, and the line AB the two lines AP and PB. Wherfore how much the line AG containeth in power more then the line AB, so much also doth the line PG contain in power more then the line BP: namely, taking away the common square of AP, there is left the excesse of the square of PG aboue the square of BP. But the square of AG (which is GL) exceedeth the square of AB (namely, the square BK) by the rectangle parallelogramme GM or OD, by construction. Wherfore the square of PG exceedeth the square of BP, by the rectangle parallelogramme OD. And forasmuch as vnto the squares of AB and AG, are equal the squares of AP and PB, and of AP and PG: and their excesse is taken away, namely, the rectangle parallelogramme OD: there shallbe left the squares of AP and PO equal to the squares of AP and PB. And taking away the square of AP which is cōmon, the residues

namely, the squares of BP and PO shalbe equal: and therefore their sides (namely, the lines BP and PO) are equal. And forasmuch as the squares GL and PK are (by suppositiō) rational, and therefore cōmēsurable their excesse OD, shalbe commēsurable vnto thē by the 15. of the tēth. And therfore it is rationall by the 9. diffinition of the tēth. Wherfore the rational parallelogram OD, being applied vpon the rational line GD (or BG) maketh the

bredth OG rational and cōmensurable in lēgth to the whole line BG
                     •
                   by the 20. of the tenth. But if the whole line BG be commensurable to one of the partes OG, the lines BO, OG, and BG sh
                     •••
                   be commensurable, by the same 15. of the tenth. Wherfore also the line OG shalbe commensurable to the half of the line BO, namely, to the line PO, or PB, by the 12. of the tenth. And forasmuch as the two lines PO and OG are commensurable, the whole line PG shalbe commensurable to the line PO, or to the line PB, by the same 15. of the tenth. Wherfore either of the lines PG and PB shall be cōmensurable vnto the whole line PB, by the same. Wherefore the lines BG, PB and PG haue the one to the other that proportion which numbers haue, by the 5. of thirtenth. Wherfore the sections PB and PG of the base BG are commensurable in length

                     •
                   thus proued. Forasmuch as the square of AB is by supposition, commensurable to the square of BG: and vnto the rational square of AB is commensurable the rational square of BP (by the 12. of the eleuenth) Wherfore the residue, namely, the square of PA is commensurable to the same square of BP, by the 2. part of the 15. of the eleuenth. Wherefore by the 12. of the tenth, the square of PA is commensurable to the whole square of BG. Wherefore the perpendicular AP is commensurable in power to the base BG, by the 3. diffinition of the tenth: which was required to be proued.
               In demonstrating of this, we made no mention at all of the length of the sides AB and AG, but only of the length of the base BG: for that the line BG is the rational line first set: and the other lines AB and AG are supposed to be commensurable in power only to the line BG. Wherefore if that be plainely demonstrated, when the sides are commensurable in power only to the base, much more easily wil it follow, if the same sides be supposed to be commensurable both in length and in power to the base: that is, if their lengthes be expressed by the rootes of square nombers.
               
                  ¶ A Corollary. 1.
                  
                     By the former things demonstrated, it is manifest that if from the powers of the base, and of one of the sides, be taken away the power of the other side, and if the halfe of the power remaining, be applied vpon the whole base, it shall make the bredth that section of the base which is coupled to the first side. For from the powers of the base BG, and of one of the sides AG, that is, from the squares BD and GL, the power of the other side AB, namely the square BK (or the parallelogramme EM) is taken away. And of the residue, (namely, of the square BD, and of the parallelogramme OD, or DR, which by supposition is equal vnto OD) the halfe (namely
                        •
                      of the whole FR, which is PD, for the lines GR and PB are equal to the lines GO and PO) is applied to the whole line BG or GD: and maketh the bredthe the line PG the section of the base BG, which section is coupled to the first side AG. And by the same reason in the other side, if from the squares BD and BK be taken away the square GL, there shall remaine the rectangle parallelogramme FO: For the parallalelogramme EM is equal to the square BK, and the parallelogramme GM to the parallelogramme OD. Wherefore FP the halfe of the residue FO, maketh the bredth BP, which is coupled to the first side taken AB.
               
               
                  A Corollary. 2.
                  
                     If a perpendicular drawne from an angle of a triangle do cut the base: the sections are to the other sides in power proportionall by an Arithmetical proportion. For it was proued that the excesse of the powers of the lines AG and AB is one and the same with the excesse of the powers of the lines PG and PB. If therfore the powers do equally excede the one the other, they shall by an Arithmet

            A briefe treatise, added by Flussas, of mixt and composed regular solides.
            REgular solides are sayd to be composed and mixt, when ech of them is transformed into other solides, keeping still the forme, number, and inclination of the bases, which they before had one to the other: some of which yet are transformed into mixt solides, and other some into simple. Into mixt, as a Dodecahedron and an Icosahedron: which are transformed or altered, if ye diuide their sides into two equall partes, and take away the solide angles subtended of plaine superficiall figures made by the lines coupling those middle sections: for the solide remayning after the taking away of those solide angles, is called an Icosidodecahedron.
                  Icosidodecahedron.
                If ye diuide the sides of a cube and of an Octohedron into two equall partes, and couple the sections, the solide angles subtended of the plaine superficieces made by the coupling lines, being taken away, there shall be left a solide, which is called an Exoctohedron.
                  Exoctohedrō.
                So that both of a Dodecahedron and also of an Icosahedron, the solide which is made, shall be called an Icosidodecahedron: and likewise the solide made of a Cube &amp; also of an Octohedron, shall be called an Exoctohedron. But the other solide, namely, a Pyramis (or Tetrahedron) is transformed into a simple solide: for if ye diuide into two equall partes euery one of the sides of the pyramis, triangles described of the lines which couple the sections, and subtending, and taking away solide angles of the pyramis, are equall and like vnto the equilater triangles left in euery one of the bases: of all which triangles is produced an Octohedron, namely, a simple and not a composed solide. For the Octohedron hath fower bases, like in number, fonne, and mutuall inclination with the bases of the pyramis: and hath the other fower bases with like situation opposite and parallel to the former. Wherefore the application of the pyramis taken twise, maketh a simple Octohedron, as the other solides make a mixt compound solide.
            
               ¶ First Definition.
               An Exoctohedron is a solide figure contained of sixe equall squares, and eight equilater and equall triangles.
            
            
               ¶ Second Definition.
               
                  An Icosidodecahedron is a solide figure, contained vnder twelue equilater equall and equiangle Pentagons, and twentie equall and equilater triangles.
               
               For the better vnderstanding of the two former definitions, and also of the two Propositions following, I haue here set two figures, whose formes, if ye first

describe vpon pasted paper or such like matter, and then cut them and folde them accordingly, they will represent vnto you the perfect formes of an Exoctohedron and of an Icosidodecahedron.
               
            
            
               ¶The first Probleme. To describe an equilater and equiangle exoctohedron, and to contayne it in a sphere geuen: and to proue that the diameter of the sphere is double to the side of the sayd exoctohedron.
               SVppose that there be a sphere geuen, whose diameter let be AB. And about the diameter AB let there be described a square by the sixth of the fourth:
                     Construction of the exoctobedron.
                   and vpon the square let there be described a cube by the 15. of the thirtenth: which let be CDEFQTVR: and let the diameter thereof be QR, and the centre S. And diuide the sides of the cube into two equall partes, in the poyntes G, H, I, K, L, M, N, O, P. &amp;c. And couple the middle sections by the right lines IN, NO, OP, PI and such like, which subtend the angles of the squares or bases of the cube: and they are equall by the 4. first, and contalne right angles, as the angle NIP. For the angle NID which is at the base of the Isosceles triangle NDI, is the halfe of a right angle, and so likewise is the opposite angle RIP. Wherefore the residue NIP is a right angle, and so the rest. Wherefore NIPO is a square. And by the same reason shall the rest NMLK, KGHI &amp;c. inscribed

in the bases of the cube, be squares: and they shall be sixe in number, according 
                     •
                  o the nūber of the bases of the cube.

Agayne forasmuch as the triangle KIN subtendeth the solide angle D of the cube, and likewise the triangle KGL the solide angle C, &amp; so the rest, which subtend the eight solide angles of the cube: and these triangles are equall and equilater, namely, being made of equall sides &amp; they are the limmits or borders of the squares, and the squares the limmits or borders of thē, as hath before bene proued: wherefore LMNOPHGK is an exoctohedrō, by the diffinition, and is equilater, for it is contayned of equall subtendent lines: it is also equiangle, for euery solide angle thereof, is contayned vnder two superficiall angles of two squares, and two superficiall angles of two equilater triangles.
               And now forasmuch as the opposite sides and diameters of the bases of the cube are parallels,
                     That the 
                           •
                        xoctohedron is contayned in a sphere.
                   the playne extended by the right lines QT, VR, shall be a parallelogramme. And for that also in that playne lyeth QR the diameter of the cube, and in the same playne also is the line MH, which diuideth the sayd playne into two equall parts, and also coupleth the opposite angles of the exoctohedron this line MH therefore diuideth the diameter into two equall partes, by the corollary of the 34. of the first, and also diuideth it selfe in the same poynt, which let be S, into two equall partes, by the 4 of the first. And by the same reason may we proue that the rest of the lines, which couple the opposite angles of the exoctohedron, doo in S the centre of the cube diuide th
                     •
                   one the other into two equall parts. For euery one of the angles of the exoct

                  edistant from the poynt S.
               And forasmuch as AB the diameter of the sphere geuen, is put equall to the diameter of the base of the cube,
                     That the exoctohed
                           •
                        on is contayned in the sphere geuen.
                   namely, to the line RT, and the same line RT is equall to the line MH, by the 33. of the first: which line MH coupling the opposite angles of the exoctohedron, is drawne by the centre: wherefore it is the diameter of the sphere geuen which contayneth the exoctohedron.
               Finally forasmuch as in the triangle RFT, the line PO doth cutte the sides into two equall partes,
                     That the dia

                   it shall cutte them proportionally with the bases namely, as FR is to FP, so shall RT be to PO, by the 2. of the sixth. But FR is double to FP, by supposition: wherefore RT, or the diameter HM, is also double to the line PO the side of the exoctohedron. Wherefore we haue described an equilater &amp; equiangle exoctohedron, and comprehended it in a sphere geuen, and haue proued that the diameter of the sphere is double to the side of the exoctohedron.
            
            
               
               ¶The 2. Probleme. To describe an equilater &amp; equiangle Icosidodecahedron, &amp; to cōprehend it in a sphere geuen: and to proue that the diameter being diuided by an extreame and meane proportion, maketh the greater segment double to the side of the Icosidodecahedron.
               SVppose that the diameter of the sphere geuen be NL, and (by the 30. of the sixth) diuide the line NL by an extreame and meane proportion in the poynt I: and the greater segment thereof let be NI.

Now forasmuch as these lines subtend equall angles of the pentagons, and those equall angles are contayned of equall sides (namely of the halues of the sides of the pentagons: therefore those subtending lines are equall, by the 4. of the first. Wherefore the triangles GQV, YQR, VXT, and the rest which take away solide angles of the dodecahedron, are equilater. Agayne forasmuch as in euery pentagon are described fiue equall right lines, coupling the middle sections of the sides, as are the lines QV, VT, TS, SR, RQ: they describe a pentagon in the playne of the pentagon of the dodecahedron: and the sayd pentagon is contayned in a circle, namely, whose cen
                  
                     •
                  re is the centre of a pentagon of the dodecahedron. For the lines drawne from that centre to the angles of this pentagon are equall, for that they are perpendiculars vpon the bases cutte, by the 12. of the fourth. Wherefore the pentagon QRSTV is equiangle, by the 11. of the same. And by the same reason may the rest of the pentagons described in the bases of the dodecahedron be proued equall and like. Wherefore those pentagons are 12. in number: And forasmuch as the equall and like t
                     •
                  iangles, doo subtend and take away 20. solide angles of the dodecahedron, therefore the sayd triangles shall be 20. in nūber. Wherfore we haue described an Icosidodecahedrō by the diffinitiō, which Icosidodecahedrō is equilater, for that all the sides of the triangles are equal &amp; cōmon with the pētagons: and it is also equiangle. For euery one of the solide angles is made of two superficiall angles of an equilater pentagon, and of two superficiall angles of an equilater triangle.
               
                  Now let vs proue that it is contained in the Sphere geuen, whose diameter is NL.
                     That the Icosidodecahedron is contayned in the sphere geuen.
                   Forasmuch as perpendiculars drawen frō the centres of the Dodecahedron, to the midle sections of his sides, are the halfes of the lines, which couple the opposite midle sections of the sides of the Dodecahedron, by the 3. Corollary of the 17. of the thirtenth: which lines also, by the same Corollary, do in the centre diuide the one the other into two equall partes: therefore right lines drawen from that point to the angles of the Icosidodecahedron (which are set in those midle sections) are equall: which lines are 30. in number according to the number of the sides of the Dodecahedron: for euery one of the angles of the Icosidodecahedron are set in the midle sections of euery one of the sides of the Dodecahedron. Wherfore making the centre the centre of the Dodecahedron, and the space any one of the lines drawen from the centre to the midle sections, describe a Sphere, and it shall passe by all the angles of the Icosidodecahedron, and shall containe it.
               And forasmuch as the diameter of this solide, is that right line, whose greater segment is the side of the cube inscribed in the Dodecahedron, by the 4. Corollary of the 17. of the thirtenth, which side is NI, by supposition. Wherefore that solide is contayned in the Sphere geuen whose diameter is put to be the line NL.
               
                  
                     That the diameter being deuided by an extreme and meane proportion. &amp;c.
                  Now let vs proue that the

greater segment of the diameter is duple to QV the side of this solide. Forasmuch as the sides of the triangle AEB are in the pointes Q and V diuided into two equall partes, the lines QV and BE are parallels, by the Corollary of the 39. of the first. Wherefore as AE is to AV, so is EB to VQ, by the 2. of the sixth. But the line AE is double to the line AV. Wherefore the line BE is double to the line QV: by the 4. of the sixth. Now the line BE is equall to NI, or to the side of the cube, by the 2. Corollary of the 17. of the thirtenth, which line NI is the greater segment of the diameter NL. Wherefore the greater segment of the diameter geuen, is double to the side of the Icosidodecahedron inscribed in the Sphere geuen. Wherefore we haue described an equilater and equiangle Icosidodecahedron, and contained it in a Sphere geuen, and haue proued that the diameter thereof being diuided by an extreme and meane proportion, maketh hys greater segment double to the side of the Icosidodecahedron.

                     An Icosidodecahedron may containe the other fiue regular bodyes. For it will receaue the angles of a Dodecahedron, in the centres of the triangles which subtend the solide angles of the Dodecahedron: which solide angles are 20. in nū
                        ber, and are placed in the same order in which the solide angles of the Dodecahedron taken away or subtended by them, are. And by that reason it shall receaue a Cube and a Pyramis contayned in the Dodecahedron: when as the angles of the one are set in the angles of the other.
                     An Icosidodecahedron receaueth an Octohedron, in the angles cutting the sixe opposite sections of the Dodecahedron, euen as if it were a simple Dodecahedron.
                     And it containeth an Icosahedron, placing the 12. angles of the Icosahedron in the selfe same centres of the 12. Pentagons.
                     It may also by the same reason be inscribed in euery one of the fiue regular bodies: namely, in a Pyramis, if ye place 4. triangular bases concentricall with 4. bases of the Pyramis, after the same maner, that ye inscribed an Icosahedrō in a Pyrami
                           •
                        . So likewise may it be inscribed in an Octohedron, if ye make 8. bases thereof concentricall with the 8. bases of the Octohedron. It shall also be inscribed in a Cube, if ye place the angles which receaue the Octohedron inscribed in it, in the centres of the bases of the Cube. Moreouer, ye shall inscribe it in an Icosahedron, when the triangles compased in of the Pentagon bases, are concentricall with the triangles, which make a solide angle of the Icosahedron. Finally, it shall be inscribed in a Dodecahedron, if ye place euery one of the angles thereof in the midle sections of the sides of the Dodecahedron, according to the order of the construction thereof.
                     The opposite plaine superficieces also of this solide are parallels. For the opposite solide angles are subtended of parallel plaine superficieces, as well in the angles of the Dodecahedron subtended by

                         it is manifest that a Dodecahedron &amp; an Icosahedron, mixed, are

transformed into one &amp; the selfe same solide of an Icosidodecahedron. A cube also and an octohedrō are mixed and altered into an other solide, namely, into one and the same Exoctohedron. But a pyramis is transformed into a simple and perfect solide, namely into an Octohedron.
                     If we will frame these two solides ioyned together into one solide, this onely must we obserue.
                     In the pentagon of a dodecahedron inscribe a like pentagon, so that let the angles of the pentagon inscribed be set in the midle sections of the sides of the pentagon circumscribed, and then vpon the said pentagon inscribed, let there be set a solide angle of an Icosahedron, and so obserue the selfe same order in euery one of the bases of the Dodecahedron: and the solide angles of the Icosahedron set vpon these pentagons shall produce a solide consisting of the whole Dodecahedron, and of the whole Icosahedron. In like sort, if in euery base of the Icosahedrō, the sides being diuided into two equall partes be inscribed an equilat

                     And after the same order, if in the bases of a cube, be inscribed squares subtending the solide angles of an Octohedron, or in the bases of an Octohedron, be inscribed equilater triangles subtēding the solide angles of a cube, there shall be produced a solide consisting of either of the whole solides, namely, of the whole cube and of the whole Octohedron.
                     But equilater triangles inscribed in the bases of a pyramis, hauing their angles set in the midle sections of the sides of the pyramis, and the solide angles of a pyramis set vpon the sayd equilater triangles, there shall be produced a solide, consisting of two equal and like pyramids.
                     And now if in these solides thus composed, ye take away the solide angles, there shalbe restored againe the first composed solides: namely, the solide angles taken away from a Dodecahedron and an Icosahedron composed into one, there shalbe left an Icosidodecahed

                     Of the nature of a trilater and equilater Pyramis.
                     
                         A trilater equilater Pyramis, is deuided into two equal partes, by three equal squares, which in the centre of the pyramis cutte the one the other into two equal partes, and perpendicularly, and whose angles are set in the midle sections of the  sides of the pyramis. From a pyramis are taken away 4. pyramids like vnto the whole, which vtterly take away the sides of the pyramis, and that which is left

is an octohedrō inscribed in the pyramys in which all the solides inscribed in the pyramis are contained. A perpendicular drawne from the angle of the pyramis  to the base, is double to the diameter of the cube inscribed in it. And a right line  coupling the midle sections of the opposite sides of the pyramis, is triple to the side of the selfe same cube. The side also of the pyramis is triple to the diameter of the  base of the cube. Wherefore the same side of the pyramis is in power duple to  the right line which coupleth the midle sections of the opposite sides. And it is  in power sesquialter to the perpendicular which is drawne from the angle to the base. Wherefore the perpendicular is in power sesquitertia to the line which coupleth  the midle sections of the opposite sides. A pyramis, and an Octohedron inscribed in it, also an Icosahedron inscribed in the same Octohedron, doo containe  one and the selfe same sphere.
                  
                  
                     Of the nature of an Octohedron.
                     Foure perpendiculars of an Octohedron, drawne in 4. bases therof from two  opposite angles of the said Octohedron, and coupled together by those 4. bases, describe a Rhombus, or diamond figure: one of whose diameters is in power duple to the other diameter. For it hath the same proportiō that the diameter of the Octohedron, hath to the side of the Octohedron. An Octohedron &amp; an Icosahedron inscribed in it, do containe one and the selfe same sphere. The diameter of  the solide of the Octohedron, is in power sesquialter to the diameter of the circle  which containeth the base: and is in power triple to the right line which coupleth  the cētres of the opposite bases: and is in power 
                           That is as 8. 103

The angle of the inclination  of the bases of the Octohedron, doth with the angle of the inclination of  the bases of the pyramis, make angles equal to two right angles.
                  
                  
                     Of the nature of a Cube.
                     The diameter of a cube, is in power sesquialter to the diameter of his base: and is in power triple to his side: and vnto the line which coupleth the centres of  the next bases, it is in power sextuple. Moreouer the side of the cube is to the side  of the Icosahedron inscribed in it, as the whole is to the greater segment: vnto  the side of the Dodecahedron, it is as the whole is to the lesse segment: vnto the  side of the Octohedron, it is in power duple: and vnto the side of the pyramis, it is  in power subduple. Moreouer the cube is triple to the pyramis: but to the cube  the Dodecahedron is in a maner duple. Wherfore the same Dodecahedron is in a  maner sextuple to the sayd pyramis.
                  
                  
                     Of the nature of an Icosahedron.
                     Fiue triangles of an Icosahedron, do make a solide angle, the bases of which  triangles make a pentagon. If therfore from the opposite bases of the Icosahedron

be taken the other pentagon by them described, these pentagons shall in such sort cut the diameter of the Icosahedron which coupleth the forsaid opposite angles, that that part which is contained betweene the plaines of those two pentagons, shalbe the greater segment: and the residue which is drawne from the plaine to  the angle shall be the lesse segment. If the opposite angles of two bases ioyned together, be coupled by a right line, the greater segment of that right line is the side  of the Icosahedron. A line drawne from the centre of the Icosahedron to the angles, is in power quintuple, to halfe that line which is takē betwene the pentagōs, or of the halfe of that line which is drawne from the centre of the circle which cō
                        tayneth  the foresaid pentagon: which two lines are therefore equall. The side of the Icosahedron contayneth in power either of them, and also the lesse segment,  namely, the line which falleth from the solide angle to the pentagon. The diameter of the Icosahedron contayneth in power the whole line, which coupleth the opposite angles of the bases ioyned together, and the greater segment thereof,  namely, the side of the Icosahedron. The diameter also is in power quintuple to the line which was taken betwene the pentagons, or to the line which is drawne from the centre to the circumference of the circle which containeth the pentagon  cōposed of the sides of the Icosahedron. The dimetient contayneth in power the right line which coupleth the centres of the opposite bases of the Icosahedron,  and the diameter of the circle which contayneth the base. Moreouer the sayd dimetient contayneth in power the diameter of the circle, which contayneth the pentagon, and also the line which is drawne from the centre of the same circle to the circumference: That is, it is quintuple to the line drawne from the centre to  the circumference. The line which coupleth the centres of the opposite bases, contayneth in power the line which coupleth the centres of the next bases, and also the rest of that line of which the side of the cube inscribed in the Icosahedron is  the greater segment. The line which coupleth the middle sections of the opposite sides, is triple to the side of the dodecahedron inscribed in it. Wherefore if the  side of the Icosahedron, and the greater segment thereof be made one line, the third part of the whole, is the side of the dodecahedron inscribed in the Icosahedron.
                  
                  
                     Of the nature of a Dodecahedron.
                     
                         The diameter of a dodecahedron contayneth in power the side of the dodecahedron, and also that right line, vnto which the side of the dodecahedron is the lesse segment, and the side of the cube inscribed in it is the greater segmēt: which line is that which subtendeth the angle of the inclination of the bases, contayned  vnder two perpendiculars of the bases of the dodecahedron. If there be taken two bases of the dodecahedron distant the one from the other by the length of one of the sides, a right line coupling their centres, being diuided by an extreame and meane proportion, maketh the greater segment the right line which coupleth the  centres of the next bases. If by the centres of fiue bases set vppon one base, be drawne a playne superficies, and by the centres of the bases which are set vpon the opposite base be drawne also a playne superficies, and then be drawne a right line coupling the centres of the opposite bases, that right line is so cut, that eche of his partes set without the playne superficies, is the greater segment of that part which  is contayned betwene the playnes. The side of the dodecahedron is the greater

segment of the line which subtendeth the angle of the pentagon. A perpendicular  line drawne from the centre of the dodecahedron to one of the bases, is in power quintuple to half the line which is betwene the playnes: And therfore the whole  line which coupleth the centres of the opposite bases, is in power quintuple to the whole line which is betwene the sayd playnes. The line which subt
                           •
                        deth the  angle of the base of the dodecahedrō, together with the side of the base, are in power quintuple to the line which is drawne from the cētre of the circle, which contayneth the base, to the circumference. A section  of a sphere contayning three bases of the dodecahedron taketh a third part of the diameter of the sayd sphere. The side of the dodecahedron, and the line which  subtendeth the angle of the pentagon, are equall to the right line which coupleth the middle sections of the opposite sides of the dodecahedron.
