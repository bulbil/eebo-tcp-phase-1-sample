            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            TO THE WORSHIPFVLL HIS VERY LOVING Friend M. Thomas Chapman, Sonne and Heire to the Religious Founder of this Exercise.
            
               Worthy Sir,
            
            
               WHat your selfe, and others with your selfe haue through your means formerly by word of mouth heard from me, you shall now vpon your second request receiue here in writing. I should not haue deemed it worthy the reseruation, but that it pleased

you (who haue best right to it) to require it. In scatterd notes only (like Absyrtus his limmes) I had the summe and heads of it; which I haue againe here recollected, &amp; cast (as neare as I could) into that mould and frame that it was deliuered in at first. If much seeme missing of that little grace that it then had, it must be remembred, that the liuelesse letter for viuacitie and efficacie commeth farre short of the liuing voice. As it is, you haue it, and no more then your owne in it, from him, who for your pious building on your worthy Fathers foundation in this kinde, doth deseruedly affect you, and shall alwayes continue
            
               Yours to be commanded in the Lord, THO. GATAKER.
               
            
         
         
            
            TO THE READER.
            
               BE pleased (good Reader) to vnderstand in few words the occasion whereupon this Sermon was preached, and thou wilt iudge it to be a kinde of necessitie to make that publike to the common view, which was first intended for the eare onely of a priuate Auditory. There is, we see, too great and generall a want (in these our dayes) of monuments and memorials of that miraculous deliuerance which God wrought for this Land in 88. When Tongue and Pen, Pulpit and Presse are silent for that, we may expect the stones to cry out against vs, and to celebrate that praise to God whereof we are neglectiue. But mans memory being a table booke to register acts passed, and not able to comprehend all

that is to be recorded therein, when new things of note come to be imprinted in it, the old are wip't out: so God affording vs a daily supplie of new preseruations, those other which we haue formerly receiued grow quite out of date, are rased out, and buried in obliuion. Therfore to reuiue this blessing (which ought neuer to be forgotten) amongst the rest in this Land, and for it to eternize Gods praise amongst vs, it hath beene religiously prouided by Mr. Thomas Chapman (sometimes a worthy Citizen) that yeerely three Sermons shall be preached in the Church of St. Pancrace in Soper-lane, where he lately liued a well deseruing parishioner: One of the Sermons to be preached Nouemb. 17. in thankfull remembrance of the coronation of that Virgin Queene ELIZABETH of famous and neuer-dying memory, with whose gracious gouernment accompanied much happinesse to our kingdome; but this as chiefe of all, (scil.) the establishment of that truth of the Gospell &amp; discipline of the Church which we now enioy vnder our dread Soueraigne Lord King CHARLES (whom God long preserue a religious Defender of this truth and peace amongst vs.) Another Sermon

to be preached August 12. for our deliuerance from that Spanish Armado (in which course this Sermon was preached.) A third Nouemb. 5. for the preseruation of our King and State from that damnable powder-plot as yet vnparalleld in any age since the world began. In each of these we may behold Gods goodnesse: first in bringing vs to the glorious light of the Gospell by making that Queene a Mother ouer his Israel and a Nurse ouer his Church: neither was it lesse goodnesse in him to preserue vs in this happy state, then to conferre it vpon vs; and this he hath done maugre the malice of our enemies, who haue not wanted both power and policie in these their attempts, yet when they were strong and many, our God was mightier than they, and there were more with vs than against vs: when they had laid their plots and traines, God confounded the wicked imaginations of those Achitophels, and let them fall into the pit they had digged for others. This good man, famous in his generation, in thankfull remembrance to God of these three blessings, in his life time solemnly obserued three Sermons, and hath left large Legacies at his death for their

continuance vnto posteritie; that in succeeding ages fathers may declare vnto their children how great things God hath done for vs in the old times before them. By this godly care of his, he hath built himselfe a monument of fame to remaine longer than those Aegyptian Pyramides, or that Pillar which Absolom reared vp in the Kings dale for the perpetuitie of his name vpon earth. Thus they that honour God, God will honour them, in seeking the glory of Gods name, God hath made an honourable memoriall of his name to redound vpon his owne head. He was second to none, being the first Founder (of late) of this pious act: but I hope he shall not stand alone, but that there will be many found to second him hereafter in so good a worke worthy the imitation. So now (Reader) I commit this Sermon to thy perusall: whilest in it thou seest Gods wonderfull workes which he hath done for our Nation, or what good soeuer thou shalt reape else in this Exercise, be thankfull to God and pray for the Author.

               But this Register is very much abused by the greatest part of those that haue the custody of it. For if the Records that the most enter therein, and keepe there, were surueyed, See Bern. serm. parv. 1. Morton ibid. §. 2. and Marbury of Repentance. there would be found filed there large rolls fraught with friuolous and froathie stuffe, of little weight, and lesse vse, yea (it may be) with much filthy, and vnsauoury matter,

               O how highly art thou beloued of God, whom the heauens fight

for; and the Winds as thy confederates come in to assist thee! To thine aid came the boisterous North-wind downe from the Hills, and bare downe before thee the troopes that came against thee, with whirling blasts repelling their speares, and retorting their arrowes, and darts vpon their owners.
            
            The Reason hereof.
            
               
                  Reason 1.1. The Saints are in league, and confederacie with God. 
               
                  Psal. 50.5. 
               Gather me my Saints (saith he) that haue made a league with me. Now as Princes that are in league of amity together, may haue the

               My horses (saith Iehosaphat to Ahab) are as thy horses; and my people as thy people: thou mayest vse them as thine owne. So the godly being in league with God, may haue all his forces, and armies for their helpe, and assistance, whensoeuer need shall be. And what are all the Creatures but Gods hoasts? He is 
                  Dominus exercituum. Amos 4.13. verse 8. 
               the Lord of Hoasts: and (as 
                  Vide Dauidem Kimchi in Radic.
                the Rabbines well obserue) hee hath two generall troopes, as his horse, and foot,
               
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
                
               the vpper troope, and 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
                
               the lower troope, or 
                  Copiae tam inferiores, quam supernae. Mercer.
                
               the creatures aboue, and the creatures beneath, all ready prest to be employed, in warres, either defensiue, or offensiue, for the safegard of his fauourites, or the destruction of their opposites. Euen 
                  Psal. 34.7. the Angels themselues (saith the Psalmist) pitch their tents about those that feare God, &amp;c. 
                  Piis assident; impios obsident. Ambros. in Psal.
                
               they lye in garrison, about the godly, to defend and deliuer them; they lie in campe against their enemies to offend, and to destroy them.
            
               
                  Reason 2.2. What are the Creatures, but Gods Sergeants at Armes to arrest, and attach Rebels? 
               
                  Psal. 119 91. 
               All the creatures (saith the Psalmist) are at his seruice. 
               
                  Psal. 104.4. 
               The

winds are his messengers, and the fire and flame his ministers. And 
                  Psal. 148.8. 
               the haile, and snow his officers, and the executioners of his word: they serue him all, and they do his will, though 
                  Nec operis sunt consciae. Bern. de grat. &amp; lib. arb.
                they know not what they doe. But they rebell against God himselfe (as we haue heard 
                  Point 1. before) that are vp in armes against any of those that be his:
                  Reason 1. whom he hath vndertaken the protection of; and concerning whom he hath giuen so expresse a charge by the Psalmist, 
               
                  Psal. 105.15. 
               Touch not mine Anointed; that is, any one of mine holy ones. The place is commonly misvnderstood; not spoken of Kings directly (though 1 Sam. 24.7. &amp; 26.9, 11. concerning them also, as being in a more speciall maner 
                  Psal. 89.20. 
               Gods Anointed;) but to Kings (
                  Psal. 105.14. 
               He rebuked euen Kings for their sakes) in the behalfe of his Saints, by him 2 Cor. 1.21. spiritually anointed to be

               Kings, and Priests to him. These being in such maner his, the Creatures are all as his Purseuants, and his Sergeants at Armes to apprehend, and attach them all that make head against them, and

            The third Point of Instruction.
            
            Est ciuitas Dei, Deus quam protegit.
            It is the Citie of God, that 
               
                  Esai. 37.35. 
               God thus protecteth.
                  Instructiō
                   3. 
               
                  Verse 8. 
               In the Citie of the Lord of Hoasts; (saith my Text) in the Citie of our God. And before, 
                  Verse 1. 
               Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised in the Citie of our God: 
               
                  Verse 3. 
               In her Palaces it is that God is knowne for a sure retreat. It is 
                  Zech. 2.5. 
               Ierusalem, that God is a wall of fire about. And vpon them it was that 
                  Apoc. 20.9. 
               fire fell downe,

and deuoured them, that beset the beloued Citie.
            
            The Reason hereof.
            
               
                  Reason 1.1. It is the place of Gods residence, where hee especially resideth, 
                  Psal. 132.14. 
               This is my rest for euer (saith he) Here will I dwell, for I take delight in it. And Princes, though they haue a generall care of their whole kingdome, yet 2 Sam. 5.9. a more speciall care of the places of their principall abode.
            
               
                  Reason 2.2. It is Gods inheritance. 
               
                  Deut. 9.29. 
               They are thy people and thine inheritance, saith Moses. And we know how loth men are (witnesse 1 King. 21.3. 
               Naboth the Iisrelite) to lose, or to depart with their inheritance, or any part of it.
            
               
                  Reason 3.3. It is Gods Vineyard. 
               
                  Esai. 5.7. 
               Surely the Vineyard of the Lord of Hoasts is the house of Israel; and the men of Iuda his pleasant plantation. And his Vineyard hee saith 
                  Esai. 27.3. 
               he will keepe, and watch continually night and day, without any moment of intermission, that no enemie assaile it, that none breake into it, to make spoile and hauocke of it.
            
               
                  Reason 4.4. It is Gods Garden. 
               
                  Cant. 4.12. 
               My Sister, my Spouse, is as a Garden inclosed. And we know how carefull men are of any place to fence and pale in their Gardens, whatsoeuer place else, field, or Orchard, they suffer to lie open. Nor let vs thinke that God hath any whit lesse care of his, which hee delighteth so much in.
            
               
                  Obiection.
               But how commeth it to passe then (may some say) that the Psalmist complaineth in that manner? O Lord the Heathen are come into thine inheritance, they haue made Ierusalem an heape of stones, &amp;c.
            
               I answer.
                  Solution 1. 1. The house of God. Gen. 28.19, 22.

               Hee neglecteth them not, when hee seemeth most of all to neglect them. Though

               Though the winds rose, and the raine fell, and the flouds came, and beat all together vpon that house, yet the frame fell not, because it was founded vpon that Rocke. It is Christs Masterpeece;

that that he would shew his Deity, his diuine Power in. Would you haue me (saith Chrysostome speaking to the Iewes) proue vnto you, that Christ Iesus is God? what needs it?

               They intended euill against thee, saith the Psalmist; but they were not able to effect it) so to encourage those that 1 Sam. 18.17.

                  Vse 3. of Point 3. 
               that God thus protecteth? Then learne we the reason hence why God hath in this manner done for vs. It is for his Church among vs, his Name called vpon, his Gospell professed by vs, his worship retained with vs. And certainly (obserue we, and we shall vndoubtedly find it to be so that) since Gods truth and Gospell established with vs, and that Romish Idolatrie expelled from among vs, this Iland of ours hath enioyed the quietest, the peaceablest, the most prosperous times, that euer it did, for so long time together, at any time, that any memory of man, or record of story can be produced of, notwithstanding all the power that

that 2 Thess. 2.3. 
               Man of sinne, and all his adherents were able to raise vp against vs. And as many strange deliuerances hath God vouchsafed vs, as euer any Nation vnder the cope of heauen had. Oh that our thankfulnesse to God were in any good measure proportionable to Gods goodnesse towards vs. But it is to be feared, that that of Saluian is too too true of vs; 
                  Deus bona dat, vt boni simus. Nos vbi bona accepimus, mala cumulamus. Saluian. de prouid. l. 3. 
               God giueth vs good things, to make vs good: but wee when we haue receiued good from God, returne euill againe to him. And that of Hosea, 
               
                  Hosh. 4.7. 
               As they were increased, so they sinned against me: and I will turne their glory therefore into shame. Which if it be so; let vs remember, that as the same Saluian saith, 
                  Ideò deteriores sumus, quia meliores essè debemus. Saluian. Ibid.
                
               Therefore are we worse than others, whom God hath not done the like for, though we be no worse, if but as bad only, because we ought to be better. So, as the Centurists obserue, 
                  Ingentia beneficia, ingentia flagitia, ingentia supplicia. Magdeburg. in prafat. ad Centur. 5. 
               great blessings, seconded with grieuous sinnes, will at length draw downe extraordinary iudgements. And it had beene better for vs neuer to haue had such deliuerances, if we be not carefull to shew our selues truly thankfull vnto him, that hath wrought so great deliuerances for vs.
            
               
                  Vse 4. of Point 4.Fourthly, it may teach Gods Children not to be dismaid, if the enemies of Gods Church seeme sometime 
                  Dan. 8.24, 25. Apoc. 13.6, 7. to preuaile against it. For 
                  Ier. 31.35, 36, 37. &amp; 33.20, 21, 25, 26. they shall neuer be able to root it out for all that. Gods Church is as
