            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

The Translator to the READER.
            
            
               THe Author's Preface hath occaſioned mine. Wherein it may be expected I ſhould give a publique accompt of this action. J had once otherwiſe reſolved. But it is the faſhion. And therefore know (gentle Reader) that Evill is oftimes the (accidentall) cauſe of Good. Idleneſſe invited me to the triall of my pen in ſome few looſe ſheets, which my fancy converted to the private vſe of a beloved friend. Other end had J none. Sithence the Reverend Author hath beene pleaſed to impoſe that as a ſerious taske, which I had wantonly begun. Nature commanded duty and obedience, and ſo have J the glory of the time, To be in print.
            
            Sed dic, Poſthume, de tribus capellis.
            How doth the Authours Preface conduce to mine? Why thus. To many who perhaps will not

at firſt conſider, that this worke is but a Tranſlation, or ſeeke advantages to expend their Cenſures, his may ſeeme impertinent. But let them know, that theſe Annales were firſt written, In gratiam Exterorum Res noſtras noſcendi cupidorum. So much witneſſeth the firſt Latin Edition. Peruſe it and finde it. J am but an Interpreter, of whom, I hope, thou wilt not expect a dictionary tranſlation. Neither quarrell the omiſsion of ſome things, the knowledge whereof is to our Natives ſo innate, that now to inſert them, were as bad as to farce with tautologies, and make this little volume nauſeous. Yet hath it lost nothing of its bulke, whatſoeuer it hath of its ſplendour, thoſe defalcations being here and there in the courſe of the hiſtory ſupplied with not vnneceſſary additions, whereto the Authors approbation and conſent was not wanting. As for errours of the Preſſe, blame the Printer, not me. If thou by this reape either profit or pleaſure, thanke the Author, whoſe benefit it is that thou haſt it; and that not tongue-tied, but more then ſingle-languaged. Good is of it ſelfe diffuſive, and he participates ſo much of it, that he cannot indevour an envious confinement of it. Farewell.

               My Lord,
            
            
               ALthough I haue ever been averſe from works of this nature, as deſirous to know them in the Originall, rather then in any after-taught language; yet have I not vn willingly vndergone the taske of this Tranſlation. It is an Engliſh Hiſtory ofthoſe turbulent times, whereof no one hath written either ſo largely or freely as this Authour,

who intended it for the common good, whereof the meere Engliſh, without theſe or the like paines of ſome other would have beene incapable. Your Lordſhip hath knowne it in the Latine, which tongue you have naturalized. VVherefore this Dedication may ſeeme needles. But it is due to You as the worke of your ſervant▪ in which reguard it craves your Honorable Patronage. It hath hitherto walked vnder Royall Protection. Other would not have befitted the Authour of this ingenuous Hiſtory, by the exemplified miſeries whereof the buſie Spirits of theſe times may learne rightly to deeme of our moderne happineſſe. But even ſmall grievances in any Part make vs inſenſible of the generall good eſtate of the whole. VVe wilbe ignorant of our good, and vnhappy. As for theſe Annales, they have long paſſed with approbation. If they now diſtaſt, let the fault be the Tranſlatours, and the Pardon Yours; to whom alone my maiden pen ſueth for favour, and to whoſe ſervice dedicateth himſelfe

               THeſe Commentaryes containing the Acts of three Princes, began about ſome ten yeares ſince vnder the Protection of Your moſt Auguſt Father to breath the common aire; and but for ſo Gracious an Aſpect, had ſuffered even at the inſtant of their birth. For the errours of the Preſſe had made them ſuch, as might have deterred even

extreme impudence from ſo preſumptive a Dedication. Yet ſuch as they were, they found Acceptance and Favour at His Royall Hands. Hence am I incouraged to conſecrate this ſecond (but corrected) Edition to Your Maieſty, VVho inherit as well Your Father's Vertues, as his Kingdomes. Neither indeed can it befit any other after King JAMES of ever Sacred Memory. Moſt humbly therefore beſeecheth Your Maieſty to daigne it the like Gratious Acceptance, who with the ſame loyalty and obſervance dedicateth and conſecrateth to Your Majeſtie himſelfe and his

            THE AVTHOVRS PREFACE TO the Reader.
            
               AMong the many who have in Latin compiled the History of our Nation, Polydore Virgill in the opinion of most excelleth: not that hee hath written either more truly or copiouſly, then many others; but more politely, andlateſt of any that have taken paines in this kinde. For indeed it could not be, that a Forainer, an Italian, well gone in yeares even at his firſt arrivall in England,) where being made Archdeacon of VVells, he long ſurvived not) ſhould not often erre in the delivery of our Affaires, and in reguard of his meere ignorance in the Engliſh tongue, in ſilence bury many worthy paſſages recorded by our Engliſh Writers

only. Jt being therefore to be wiſhed, and is much deſired, that ſome one verſed in our Antiqnities would (as learned Maſter Camden hath alreadie done for the deſcription of the Iſland) conſecrate part of his learned labours to the Eternitie of Britaine, not in reforming that obſolete Virgilian History, but in compoſing a new one; our Antiquaries may iuſtly be taxed of Slouth (I had almoſt ſaid ſlouthfulneſſe) who had rather ſuffer the famous Acts of their Anceſtors to die eternally in ſilence, and ſo (as much as in them lieth) defraud their Couutrey of its true and deſerved Glory, then bestow any the leaſt paines in commenting; that ſo the examples of most eminent Ʋertues (whereof the harveſt here hath ever beene most plentifull) might not want the Record of their due Monuments. This J hope ſome or other will in good time performe. In the meane time, others drawing backe, although I was never indued with ſuch eloquence, as that I ſhould dare adventure the writing of an Hiſtory (but now eſpecially

when having paſſed the age of fifty, long deſuetude may have dulled my faculty of penning) yet have I thought it might prove paineſ-worthy, to vndertake briefly in three ſmall Commentaries

to ſet forth the deeds of three Princes immediate Succeſſors to Henry the Seventh, ſo far forth as I have had notice of them. And that, partly that by tovching at the fountaine (as they ſay) J might ſtir vp the wits of others; partly that the deſires of Forainers might in ſome ſort be ſatisfied, who not without cauſe complaine, that theſe times, then which for a thouſand yeares wee have had none more memorable in reguard of their divers and remarkable changes, are not deſcribed by any, otherwiſe then ſlightly, and as if they they had not intended any ſuch thing. As for Polydore Virgill, he hath written either nothing or very little concerning them; and that little ſo falſe and miſbeſeeming the ingenuitie of an Hiſtorian, that he ſeemeth to have aimed at no other end, then by bitter invectives againſt Henry the Eighth and Cardinall Wolſey to demerit the favour of Queene Mary, already more then befitted incenſed againſt both for the Divorce of her Mother. J have therefore written (friendly Reader) and ſo written, that although many things (I will not deny) conducing to an Hiſtorian may be wanting in me; yet am I confident, that this my endeuour will finde acceptance with many. Other Writers may here have as it were a ſtore-houſe, from whence they may if I be not

deceived) furniſh themſelves with ſome matter, which may helpe to raiſe an everlasting monument. Forainers alſo ignorant of the Engliſh tongue may have a taſte of theſe times, vnvntill ſome one ariſe, who can and will compile a Hiſtory of our Nation worthy the maieſtie of the Britiſh name. J have in this worke beene ſo obſervant of Jmpartiality, Simplicity, and Truth, that I feare nothing ſo much as a Domeſtique anger for not being pious enough, becauſe I would not be over-pious. Many contend, that a good Prince ſhould be 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               . This (I thinke) no man will affirme of an Hiſtorian, though ſome ſeeme to opine it; So that he ſhall come ſhort of his duty either to God or his Countrey, who in the delivery of an Hiſtory will not be at the least 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ; and who by affirming incertainties▪ and knowne truthes, ſhall not yeild much to his affections, ſo they be ioined with the love of Religion and Countrey. But how much do they inure Truth, who from lies and falſhood beg helpes to vnderprop her? Avant. We have no need of them, And had we, yet would it not much profit vs to rely on ſuch weake advantages, one pious lye detected proving more hurtfull, then a thouſand others, although ſo artificially contrived that they avoid diſcovery, can prove profitable. For example

whereof ſeeke no farther then the Papiſts, whoſe fained miracles, impoſtures, and Legends patched vp of lyes have brought to paſſe, that even in thoſe things which are true, they ſcarce gaine beliefe. Wherfore, I am well content that Truth, which maugre her enemies will at length be every where victorious, ſhall prevaile with me. J have done to my power. Politely, eloquently, politiquely, I could not write: Truly, and fide Atticâ as they ſay, I could. If I have done amiſſe in ought, it is not out of malice, but errour, which the gentle Reader will (I hope) pardon. This

                        Henry 8. 1509. 
                        AFter the death of HENRY the Seventh, his only Sonne HENRY Prince of Wales vndertooke the government of this Kingdome. He had then attained to the age of eighteene yeares, and was richly adorned with endowments both of Bodie and Mind. For of Stature he was tall, of a beautifull Aſpect, and of Forme through all his age truly beſeeming a King: hee was wittie, docile, and naturally propenſe to Letters, vntill pleaſures (to which the libertie of Soueraigntie eaſily prompteth) did ſomewhat vnſeaſonably withdraw him from his Studies; to theſe you may add

 was ſo ſeconded by the happie care of his Tutors, that if the end of his Raigne had beene anſwerable to the beginning, HENRY the Eighth might deſervedly haue beene ranked amongſt the greateſt of our Kings. For if you conſider his firſt twentie yeares, you ſhall not eaſily find any one, that either more happily managed affaires abroad▪ or gouerned more wiſely at home, or that bare greater ſway among his Neighbour Princes. This I thinke ought chiefly to be aſcribed to the prouidence of his wiſe Father, and his Grandmother then ſtill aliue. For they tooke care, that he ſhould haue wiſe and vertuous Ouer-ſeers in his youth, by whoſe aſſiſtance hauing once paſſed the hazards thereof, he happily auoided thoſe rockes, whereon ſo many daily ſuffer wracke. But theſe either dying, or being ſo broken with age, that they could bee no longer imployed in affaires of State, and He himſelfe being now come to thoſe yeares, that commonly caſt aſide modeſtie (Modeſtie, I ſay, the Guardian of that great Ʋertue) then making vſe of no Counſellour, but his will, he fell into thoſe vices, which notwithſtanding the glorie of his former Raigne, branded him deeply with the fowle ſtaines of Luxurie and Crueltie. But remitting thoſe things to their proper places, thoſe Worthies appointed his Counſailours were,

For it is reported that it coſt but a thouſand pound. The Monument is to be ſeene at Weſtminſter (the vſuall place ofS. Stephens Chappell. our Kings Interments) in that admirable Chappell dedicated to Saint Stephen, by this King heretofore built from the ground, a teſtimonie of his religious pietie. I haue read, that this Chappel was raiſed to that height for the ſumme of fourteene thouſand pounds and no more, and that he at the ſame time built a Ship of an vnuſuall burthen called from him The great Henrie, which by that time it was rigged, coſt little leſſe, then that ſtately Chappell. But now, O HENRY, what is become of that Ship of thine? that other worke (beſides the reward of Heauen) will perpetually proclaime thy pious munificence. Hence learne, ô Kings, that the true Trophies of Glorie are not to be placed in Armories and Arſenalls, but (and thoſe more durable) in pious Workes.

What euer the matter was, many there were, who by accuſing others ſought the Kings favour, and inlarged their owne eſtates, amongſt whom two were chiefe; the one was called RICHARD EMPSON, the other EDMVND DVDLEY, both Lawiers, and both for having ſerved the Kings turne, lately made Barons of the Exchequer. It is ſaid that

 EMPSON was borne at Torceſter in Northampton Shire, his Father was a Siuier. DVDLEY, though he were well deſcended, yet being not befriended by fortune, long ſtrugled with adverſitie But after they had ſome moneths taken paines in theſe matters, both of them ariſe to that greatneſſe, that there were few of the Nobilitie, that would not crouch to them and be ambitious of their fauour. Therefore it is not ſo much to be wondred at, if they grew exceeding wealthy: but this wealth drew with it an envy greater then it ſelfe, which neuertheleſſe did them little hurt during the life of HENRY the Seventh, but afterwards caſt them both downe as low, as enuie could haue wiſht. The King vpon his death-bed commanded in his Will and Teſtament, that reſtitution ſhould bee made to all, who had beene wronged by the Exchequer. Whereupon infinite numbers flocking to the Court, and demanding reſtitution, there could not a fitter meanes be thought of to ſtop their mouthes, then by committing of EMPSON and DVDLEY the occaſioners thereof, to the people as Sacrifices to appeaſe their fury. They were therefore arraigned and condemned of high Treaſon. And theſe things were done preſently vpon HENRY the Eighth his comming to the Crowne. So their goods being ſeized vpon, they for a whole yeare endured the miſeries, that vſually accompany a priſon, and yet were the Commons as eager againſt them as euer. Whence it ſhould firſt ariſe I know not, but ſuch a report there was, that the Queene had begged the poore mens pardons. The Nobilitie diſdaining, that ſuch meane fellowes had beene heretofore ſo prevalent with their Prince, and the Commons being eaſily incited againſt them by ſome as eager enemies to them as themſelues, cried out, that they were cheated oftheir iuſt reuenge, and wearied the King with

                     AS yet our HENRY had no warre with any forraine Prince, neither did the wiſer ſort wiſh that he ſhould haue any. But hee a young King in the heat of one and twentie yeares, was tranſported with a vehement deſire of warre, which (ſaith the Prouerbe) is ſweet to them, that neuer taſted of it. Although he had about a yeare or two before made a League with LEWIS the Twelfe of France: yet heeWarre with France.

Iealouſie, and Reuerence to the Sea of Rome ſo prevailed with Him, that hee eaſily condiſcended to the Popes requeſt. Yet that he might

 ſome way colour his action, hee would needs interpoſe himſelfe as Vmpier betweene the Pope and the French, whom by his Embaſſadours hee entreates to lay aſide armes: withall not obſcurely threatning, that if he did not ſo, he intended to vndertake the defence of the Pope againſt him, the common diſturber of the peace of Chriſtendome. The French ſet light by this. Wherefore warre is proclaimed by a Herald, the French King commanded to part with the Kingdome of France, and the Duchies of Normandie and Aquitaine, which hee without right vniuſtly vſurped. Then entring into League with MAXIMILIAN the Emperour, the Arragonois, and the Pope, they conſult of aſſaulting the French with ioint forces. The Arragonois invites vs into Spaine, that thence we might invade France, promiſing beſides certaine troupes of Horſe, ſtore of Artillery, Waggons for carriage, Munition, and many other things neceſſary for ſuch an Expedition. Our King relying on his Father in law his promiſes, levies a great Armie, whereof he ſhips onepart for Spaine, and employes the other by Sea. EDWARD HOWARD Lord Admirall had charge of the Sea forces, who fought with the French Fleet in the Bay of Bretatgne. In which fight there was no memorable thing done, beſides the combate of the two great ſhips (the one having ſeven hundred Engliſh in it vnder the command of Sir THOMAS KNEVET, the other nine hundred French vnder PRIMAVGET a Briton.)

With theſe he comes to Amiens, that the hope of ſuccours, hee being ſo neere, might encourage the defendants. For it much concerned him that the ſiege ſhould be drawne out at length. In our Army were forty thouſand Foot, and fiue thouſand Horſe, ſo that there was no likelihood of doing any good againſt vs. Neither indeed did the French intend (eſpecially at that time) to hazard the fortune of a battaile, the loſſe whereof in the iudgement of the more expert would haue beene accompanied with no loſſe then the loſſe of the Kingdome, which would eaſily haue followed our victorie. The French King therefore ſitting ſtill at Amiens, leaſt he might ſeeme to neglect ſuch a Citie (the danger whereof did thorowly grieue him) ſends ſome troupes toward Therouenne, with inſtructions to put into the Citie eighty horſemen compleatly armed (but without horſes, the beſi

For whereas with the ſame hazard they might haue victualled the beſieged, and furniſhed them with other neceſſaries which they wanted; deſiring (but too late) to amend this errour, they would needs effect it the ſame way as before.

The French in this encounter loſt three hundred horſe: there were taken priſoners, LEWIS de LONGVEVILLE Marquis of Rotelin, BADI, CLERMONT d' ANIOV, BVSSY d' AMBOISE, BAYARD, la FAYET, and PALISSE (who eſcapt out of priſon) with many others. It was then the opinion of moſt men, that this victory (if wee had but made due vſe of it) laid an eaſie way for vs to the conqueſt of France: For the French were ſo affrighted with the newes of this overthrow, that they thought of nothing but flying; and the King himſelfe with teares in his eyes bewailing his hard fortune, caſt about for ſome place of refuge, and determined to poſt into baſe Bretaigne. But wee looking no farther then Therouenne, brought our priſoners into the Campe, and without farther proſecution left the Enemies to their feares. The French call this the Battaile of Spurres, becauſe they truſted more to their heeles, then their ſwords. The Therouennois

But hee rather came to bee a Spectator, then a Partaker in the danger. Wherefore when hee ſaw into what ſtraights our King was likely to driue the French being weake, if he would preſſehard vpon him, and pierce farther into the Kingdome; although hee were a profeſt enemie to the French, yet was he iealous of our proſperous proceeding; and therefore by all meanes perſwaded HENRY to diſmantle Therouenne, and thence to proceed to the ſiege of Tournay: Hee blamed him (not without iuſt cauſe) for his late ſetting forth, Summer being first wel

                        neere ſpent: Winter was now at hand, when it would not quit coſt to maintaine ſuch an Armie, good deſigues being not then to bee put in execution: Hee told him that Therovenne was ſo farre from him, that it could not bee kept without great difficultie; therefore hee ſhould doe well to diſmantle it, that it might not hereafter ſerue for a Bulwarke to the Eenemie: That Tournay was a French Citie but (like an Iſland with the Sea) ſurrounded with Flanders and Hainault, and farre divided from the reſt of France: True it was, that it was well ſtored with inhabitants, and not meanly fortified: but that there was no other Garriſon, then of Citizens, and theſe hee ſhould finde effeminate, and for proviſion, that they had none: Hee ſhould therefore make ſpeed and come on them vnawares, and with a few dayes ſiege force them to yeild: That the French King, if hee intended to ſuccour them, muſt first march through all Henault, and paſſe over two or three great Riuers, amongst which were the Eſcaut and the Scarpe. That the Souldiers ſhould finde good booties there, and the King himſelfe the triumph of a moſt aſſured conquest:

That the addition of ſuch a Citie would bee no meane increaſe of his Dominions, and ſo much the leſſe care to bee taken of it, for as much as it would bee as eaſie for him to keepe it in obedience, as it was for the French for the ſpace of ſo many yeares to defend it▪ being placed amidſt ſo many Enemies, that ſtill had a greedie eye over it. King HENRY by this time had ſo much of Warre, that hee began to bee wearie of the toyle thereof, and to caſt his minde on the pleaſures of the Court. Wherefore (although hee wanted not Counſailors for the beſt) hee followed the Emperours advice, as being the more eaſie. The Flemmings (who begged it of the King) had leave to raſe the walls of Therouenne, to fill the ditches, and to burne all the buildings except the Church, and the Chanons houſes, which they (in regard of the diſſenſions vſuall to bordering Nations) very gladly performed.

                        Therouenne being thus taken and deſtroyed, away they march with all ſpeed to Tournay, indevouring by their celeritie to prevent the fame of their comming. But the Citizens ſuſpecting ſome ſuch enterpriſe, had fortified themſelves as well as the ſhortneſſe of time would permit them: and the Peaſants thereabouts bring all their goods into the Citie, as to a place of ſafeguard. The Citie was of no great circuit, yet at the beginning of the ſiege it contained foureſcore thouſand people. By reaſon whereof victuals quickly began to faile them: and they could no way hope for reliefe. The French King was farre off, they had no Gariſon, the Citizens bad Souldiers, two great Princes had begirt the Towne with fif

The King makes them ſweare Fealty to him, and appoints Sir EDWARD POYNINGS, a Knight of the Garter, their Governour. Next hee gives order for ſtore of warlike proviſion, puts in a ſmall Gariſon, and builds a Cittadell for the confirmation of his conqueſt. Neither amongſt theſe politique affaires did he neglect thoſe of the Church. For the Biſhop being proſcribed, heeWolſey Biſhop of Tourney. conferres the Sea with all the revenues vpon THOMAS WOLSEY, of whoſe firſt riſing and immoderate power we ſhall have much occaſion to ſpeake hereafter.
                     All things being thus ordered, becauſe Winter came on apace, hee beganne to bethinke himſelfe of returning with his Armie into England. This thought ſo farre pleaſed him, that having beene abſent ſcarce foure monethes hee tooke ſhip, and about the end of October came home triumphing in the glory of a double conqueſt.

                        another victorie, the Lord HOWARD Earle of Surrey having vnder his Fortune ſlaine the King of Scots. The King of France being encumbred with many warres, had coniured IAMES the Fourth King of Scots by the ancient Lawes of Amitie, and the late League made betweene them, that Hee would not forſake him intangled in ſo many difficulties. If Hee regarded not his friends caſe, yet Hee ſhould at leaſt looke to himſelfe, for whom it would not bee ſafe to ſuffer a bordering Nation, alwayes at enmitie with Him, by ſuch additions to ariſe to that height of power. The King of England busied with a foraine warre was now abſent, and with Him the flower of the Engliſh Chivalrie: Hee ſhould therefore forthwith take Armes, and trie to recover

                        Berwicke an eſpeciall towne of the Scottiſh Dominions, but for many yeares withheld by the Engliſh; He would eaſily be victorious, if He would but make vſe of this occaſion ſo happily offered. It could not be, but this warre would bee for His Honour, and profitable to His Friend, if not to Himſelfe: He ſhould thereby alſo make knowne to His Enemies, that the Scottiſh Armes were not to bee contemned, whoſe former victories a long, and (to them) hurtfull peace had obſcured, and buried in oblivion among the Engliſh. As for the charges of it, Hee need not bee troubled, for that Hee would afford Him fiftie thouſand Crownes towards the providing of Munition and Ordinance.
                     Theſe reaſons ſo preuailed with the yong King covetous of glory, that notwithſtanding he had lately made a League with our King, whoſe Siſter hee had married, and her vehement diſſuaſions, he proclaimed warre againſt HENRY, which proved fatall to him, bloudie to his, and the cauſe of many enſuing calamities. So having raiſed a great Armie, hee breakes into our Marches, and beſiegeth Norham Caſtle belonging to the Biſhop of Durham, the which having held out ſixe dayes was at laſt yeilded vnto him. Thence hee removes his Campe to Berwicke, waſting all the Countrey as hee marcht with fire and ſword. The newes whereof are brought vnto them, to whom the governement of the Kingdome was committed in the abſence of the King: and a leuy being made through all the North parts of the Kingdome, Alnewike is appointed the rendez-vous, where all the troupes ſhould meete at a ſet day, that thence they might ſet forward againſt the Enemie vnder the conduct of the Lord THOMAS HOWARD Earle of Surrey. Among the firſt (to his Fathers great ioy) comes the Earles Sonne THOMAS Lord Admirall, leading a veterane

 troupe of fiue thouſand men of tried valour, and haughtie in regard of their former navall victories obtained vnder the command of this young Lord. After him came the▪ Lords DACRES, CLIFFORD, SCROPE, LATIMER, CONIERS, LVMLEY, and OGLE, beſides Sir NICHOLAS APPLEYARD, Maſter of the Ordinance, Sir W. PERCIE, Sir WILLIAM SIDNEY, Sir WILLIAM BVLMER, Sir IOHN STANLEY, Sir WILLIAM MOLINEVX, Sir THOMAS STRANGWAYES, Sir RICHARD TEMPEST, and many other Knights.
                     
                        Theſe ſitting in Counſell thought it beſt to ſend an Herald to the King to expoſtulate with him concerning theſe out-rages committed: to complaine, that He had without all right or reaſon ſpoyled the Countrey of a Prince not onely Allied vnto Him, but alſo His Confederate, and therefore to certifie Him, that they were readie by battaile to revenge the breach of League, if ſo bee Hee durſt awaite their comming but a few dayes in a ground that might be fitting for the meeting of both Armies. The King makes anſwere by writing, wherein Heeretorts the violation of the League, calling God to witneſſe, that King HENRY had firſt by his many iniuries ſhowne evident ſignes of an alienated mind. For the Engliſh (Hee pretended) robbed all along the Marches of Scotland, without reſtitution or puniſhment: ANDREW BARTON a ſtout and honeſt man had beene vniuſtly ſlaine by the Kings command, and one HERON, who had murdered ROBERT CAR a Scottiſh Nobleman vaunted himſelfe openly in England, the King taking no notice of ſo hainous a fact: Of theſe things Hee had often complained by his Embaſſadours, but without effect. There was therefore no other way for Him, but to betake Himſelfe to Armes for the common defence of Himſelfe, and his Kingdome, against

the Kings iniuſtice. As for the meeting, hee ſignified that he accepted of it, and appointed both Time and Place for the battaile.

For the Scots, although they being incloſed as it were in a toyle were forced to fight in a ring, made moſt deſperate reſiſtance, and that without doubt ſo much the rather, becauſe they not onely heard their King incouraging them, but ſaw him alſo manfully fighting in the foremoſt rankes, vntill having received would vpon wound he

 is thought to haue beene as many. They loſt all their Ordinance, and almoſt all their Enſignes: inſomuch that the victorie was to bee eſteemed a very great one, but that it was ſomewhat bloudie to Vs in the loſſe of fifteene hundred. This field was fought the ninth of September neere Flodon hill vpon a riſing banke called Piperdi, not farre from Bramston.
                     
                     I am not ignorant, that the Scotiſh Writers conſtantly affirme the King was not ſlaine in the field, but having ſaved himſelfe by flight was afterwards killed by his owne people: and that the body which was brought into England was not the Kings, but of one ALEXANDER ELFINSTON, a young Gentleman reſembling the King both in viſage and ſtature, whom the King (that hee might delude thoſe that purſued him, and might as with his owne Preſence animate them that fought elſe-where) had cauſed with all tokens of Royaltie to be armed and apparelled like himſelfe. But to let paſſe the great number of Nobilitie, whoſe carcaſes found about him ſufficiently teſtifie, that they guarded their true King, and conſequently that the counterfaite fought elſe-where: it is manifeſt that his body was knowne by many of the Captives, who certainly affirmed, that it could bee no other then the Kings, although by the multitude of wounds it were much defaced. For his necke was opened to the midſt with a wide wound, his left hand almoſt cut off in two places did ſcarce hang to his arme, and the Archers had ſhot him in many places of his body.
                     Thus was IAMES the Fourth King of Scots taken away in the flower of his youth, who truly in regard of his Princely Vertues deſerved a longer life. For hee had a quicke wit, and a maieſticall countenance: he was of a great ſpirit, courteous, milde, liberall, and ſo mercifull, that it was obſerved hee was

often forced againſt his will to puniſh offenders. Theſe vertues endeared him to his people in his life time, and made them ſo much lament the loſſe of him being dead, that (as all Hiſtorians report) they ſeemed to have loſt onely him in the whole ſucceſſion of their Kings, which ſufficiently argues the improbabilitie of the ſubiects pretended Parricide.
                     But he had not fallen into this miſery, if he would haue hearkened to the advice of thoſe, who perſwaded him to have returned home before the fight contented with what hee had alreadie performed in the expedition: that he ſhould not vpon ſo weake forces hazard the eſtate o

But the French Agent▪ and ſome of the Kings Mignons corrupted by the French vrging to the contrarie, this haughtie Prince, even otherwiſe very deſirous to give proofe of his valour, was eaſily perſwaded to awaite our great Forces already marching. His body (if at leaſt that were his▪ &amp; not ELFINSTON'S) being encloſed in Lead, and brought into England was by our Kings (I will not ſay cruell, but certainly inhumane) command caſt in ſome by corner or other without due Funerall Rites, ſaying, that it was a due puniſhment for one who had periurouſly broken his League, whereas if wee examine the premiſſes, we ſhall find he wanted not probable pretexts for what hee vndertooke.

                         THOMAS HOWARD Earle of Surrey (hee who had beene victorious over the Scots) was created Duke of Norfolke, the title and dignitie of his Anceſtors. IOHN his Father deriving his pedigree from THOMAS de Brotherton, Sonne to King EDWARD the Firſt, the SEGRAVES and the MOWBRAYES (who had beene all Dukes of Norfolke) enioyed this Honour by right of Inheritance. But becauſe in Boſworth field (where hee was ſlaine) hee tooke part with the Vſurper, both he and his Poſteritie were deprived of that Honour. This THOMAS dying in the yeare 1524. his Sonne of the ſame name ſucceeded him, who deceaſed in the yeare 1554. His Sonne HENRY (a young Lord of great hopes) his Father then living was beheaded towards the end of this Kings Raigne. Hee left Iſſue THOMAS the laſt Duke of Norfolke (who alſo loſt his head the yeare 1572.) and HENRY (at nurſe when his Father died) a very learned and wiſe man, whom King IAMES (no good man repining thereat) created Earle of Northampton. THOMAS Duke of Norfolke had three Sonnes that ſurvived him, PHILIP, THOMAS, and WILLIAM. PHILIP Earle of Surrey (and by his Mother, of Arundell) condemned the yeare 1589. and after dying in priſon, left Iſſue THOMAS, then a little one, who by King IAMES his favour ſucceeded his Father in his Honors. His Vncle THOMAS out of the ſame fountaine of Royall Goodnes was created Earle of Suffolke, with addition of the dignity of Lord Chamberlaine Beſide theſe, this Family hath CHARLES Earle of Nottingham

The Prince ſo greatly fauored him, partly for his fathers deſerts, chiefely for his owne, that he being afterward King, created him Viſcount Liſle, and intending (at leaſt many were ſo perſuaded) to giue him to wife the Ladie MARY his ſiſter, who afterward was married to the King of France; thought it firſt good to honour him with the Duchie of Suffolke, which this yeare at the feaſt of Candlemas was performed.

The French king was well ſtricken in yeres, his wife a tender virgin of ſome 16. or 18. yeares of age, but wonderfull beautifull. Beſides the forementioned reaſons, the deſire of children (for he had no maſle iſſue) on His part, on Her part the publique weale, the authoritie of her brother ſo willing, and (which beares chiefeſt ſway in a womans heart) the ſupremacy of honor in the title of a Queen, were motiues to match ſo Vneuen a Paire. But many not without cauſe were perſuaded, that ſhe had rather haue made choice of BRANDON for her husband (ſo her power had been anſwerable to her wil) than the greateſt Monarch in the world: neither was it long before ſhe enioyed her deſire.

There remaines to this day a ſufficient teſtimonie her of in a building ouer the gate of the middle Temple in London, built by the Knight at the time of his attendance there, &amp; decked round about very ſumptuouſly with the Cardinalls Armes, hoping thereby ſomewhat to alay the wrath of the incenſed Prelate. But theſe things were long after this yere. WOLSEY whether that hee could not brooke this diſgrace, or bearing a minde that look't beyond this poore Benefice, left it, and became domeſtique Chaplaine to Sir IOHN NAFANT Treaſurer of Calais, by whoſe meanes hee was taken notice of by FOX Biſhop of Wincheſter, a man that knew rightly how to iudge of

good wits. He finding this young man to be verie 
                           •
                        prightfull, of learning ſufficient, and verie actiue in diſpatch of affaires, ſo highly commended him to king HENRY the Seuenth, (who relied much vpon FOXES faith and wiſedome) that hee thought it good forthwith to imploy him in affaires of great moment. What need many words? he ſo far pleaſed the King, that in ſhort time he became a great man, and was firſt prefer'd to the Deanrie of Lincolne, and then made the Kings Almoner. But HENRY the Eighth a young Prince comming to the Crowne, was wholly taken with his ſmooth tongue and pliable behauiour. For when all the reſt of his friends aduiſed Him to ſit euerie day in perſon at the Counſell Table, that ſo by experience and daily practiſe He might reape wiſedome, and to accuſtome Himſelfe to the managing of affaires of Eſtate: WOLSEY aduiſed Him to follow His pleaſures; ſaying, That His youth would not be able to brooke their tedious Conſultations: euerie Age of man had its Seaſons, and Delights agreeable. They did not do well, that would force the King to act an Old Man before His time, Youth being vtterly auerſe from wrinckled S

                           ueritie. It would come to paſſe hereafter, if God were ſo pleaſed, that what was now troubleſome to him, would not be diſagreeable to riper Yeares, nay prooue perhaps a great pleaſure. Vntill that time came, He ſhould enioy the preſent, and not by hearkening to others needleſſe perſuaſions, any way interrupt the courſe of that felicitie which the largeneſſe of His Dominions would eaſily affoord Him. He ſhould hawke and hunt, and as much as Him list vſe honeſt recreations. If ſo bee Hee did at any time deſire ſuddenly to become an Old Man by intermedling with Old Mens Cares, He ſhould not want thoſe (meaning himſelfe) that would in the euening in one or two wordes relate vnto Him the effect of a whole daies Conſultation. This ſpeech hitting ſo pat with the Kings humour, made WOLSEY ſo powerfull, that

 whereas the King before fauored him as much as any other; he onely was now in fauour with and next the King, with whon e there was nothing to bee done but by him. For he was the man that was made choice of, who like another MERCVRY ſhould paſſe betweene this our IOVE, and the Senate of the leſſer Gods, offering their petitions to Him, and to them returning his pleaſure therein. Wherefore he was euen at the firſt ſworne of the Priuie Counſell, and beſides the late collation of Tournay, vpon the death of SMITH he was alſo made Biſhop of Lincolne. In the gouernement of which Church he had not fully ſpent ſix moneths, before he was tranſlated from Lincolne to the Archbiſhopricke of Yorke then vacant by the death of Cardinall BAMBRIDGE at Rome.

                        A breach with France. BVt the French King hauing taken into his protection the young King of Scots, ſent IOHN STVART Duke of Albanie in Scotland to be Gouernour both of the kings Perſon and kingdome. The firſt thing this Duke vndertook, was, either to put to death or baniſh thoſe, whom he any way ſuſpected to fauor the Engliſh. Inſomuch, that the Queene Dowager (who by this time was matried to ARCHIBALD DOVGLIS Earle of Aagus) forced to ſaue herſelfe by flight, came into England to her Brother, with whom ſhe ſtayed at London a whole yeare, the Earle her husband after a moneth or two without leaue returning into Scotland. King HENRY being diſpleaſed at theſe French practiſes, deales vnderhand with the Emperour MAXIMILIAN (with whome the French then contended for the Dutchie of Milane) and lends him a great ſumme of money, whereby he might hire the Suiſ
                           •
                        es to aid him in the expelling the French out of Italie. But the Emperour, although he had leuied a ſufficient Armie, returned home without doing any thing. He was indeed accompted a wiſe Prince, but vnhappy in the managing of his affaires: whether it were that Fortune waiwardly oppoſed him, or that he was naturally ſlow in the execution of his wel plotted deſignes.

 But ſhortly after hee intendes a ſecond triall of his Fortune. Wherefore by his Embaſſadour the Cardinall of Suiſſerland, hee yet borowe
                           •
                         more mony of the King, which was deliuered to certaine Merchants of Genua to bee by a ſet day payed to the Emperour in Italie. But they, whether corrupted by the French, or not of ſufficient abilitie to make returne, deceiued him; and ſo his ſecond deſignes vaniſhed alſo into Aire I doe not thinke it was the Kings fault, although wee might iuſtly ſuſpect, that the great treaſure left him by his Father beeing almoſt ſpent, and the French ſecretly offering peace vpon good termes, the friendſhip betweene him and the Emperour, which hee had ſo dearely purchaſed, began at length to grow cold. Certainely (to ſpeake nothing of the League which was afterwards concluded with France) the Treaſurie was now growne ſo bare, that the King was driuen to inuent new wayes for the raiſing of money. The care of this buſineſſe (as almoſt of all others) was committed to Cardinall WOLSEY, who caſting vp the Exchequer accompts, found many deeply indebted to the King; and (whither by the negligence or treacherie of the Officers) neuer yet called to accompt. Among others, the Duke of Suffolke was found to be a great debtor, who beſides his own reuenues, receiued yerely out of France his wiues ioincture amounting to 60000 crownes. Yet notwithſtanding he was fain to withdraw himſelfe from Court, that by liuing thriftily in the countrey, he might haue wherewith to pay his debt. The Cardinal next bethinks himſelfe of publicke miſdemeanors of what ſort ſoeuer: as periury, rapes, oppreſſion of the poore, riots, and the like: the offenders without reſpect of degree or perſons, hee either publiquely puniſhed in bodie, or ſet round fines on their heads. By which means the Treaſurie

(before empty) was repleniſhed, and the Cardinall by the people much applauded for his Iuſtice. Theſe things hauing thus ſucceeded to his minde, he vndertakes more in the ſame kinde. He inſtitutes a newThe Starre-chamber Court, where the Lords of the Priuie Counſell, with other of the Nobility ſhould ſit as Iudges. The aforeſaid crimes, which then greatly raigned in this Kingdome, were puniſhable in this Court, which (as I coniecture)and from the ſtars painted in the roofe is called the Star-chamber. He erected alſo the Court of Requests,
                        The Court of Requeſts inſtituted by Wolſey.
                         where the complaints of the Poore were to be heard; and ordained many other things in the ciuile gouernment of the Kingdome, that were acceptable to the people, and are in vſe at this day, wherein hee alike manifeſted his wiſedome and loue of his Countrey. Certainly they that liued in that age, would not ſticke to ſay, That this Kingdome neuer flouriſhed more, than when WOLSEY did, to whoſe wiſdome they attributed the wealth and ſafetie that they enioyed, and the due adminiſtration of Iuſtice to all without exception.

                     THe Spring growing on, the feare of a commotionIll May day. in London increaſed with the yeare. The originall and ſucceſſe whereof I will lay open at large, foraſmuch as enormities of this nature, by our wholeſome Lawes ſeuerely reſtrained, are ſo rare, that I remember, when I was a childe, old men would reckon their age from this day, by the name of Jll May day▪
                         Long peace hauing with vs begate plentie the Mother and Nurſe both of good and bad Arts, allured the moſt excellent artificers of foreine Nations to partake of our happineſſe, by frequenting the

 Citie of London. But the giddie multitude not conceiuing what good became of communicating their skill vnto vs, tooke it verie hainouſly, that Strangers ſhould be permitted to enioy the priuiledges of the City; and our home-bred Artificers did moſt eſpecially complaine, That their meanes were euery day curtalled, foraſmuch as no ſmall part was neceſſarily to be defalked for the maintenance of theſe Strangers. This was now growne the common diſcourſe, and had gon ſo far, that one LINCOLNE a ringleader of this tumultuous rout, did not ſtick to perſuade ſome Preachers, publiquely in the Pulpit to lay open theſe common grieuances before the Eſtates of the Realme. Our Ladies Hoſpitall in London, commonly called the Spittle, is famous for the Eaſter Sermons; one of which was to be preached by Doctor HENRY STANDISH (afterward Biſhop of S. Aſaph) a graue and learned man. LINCOLNE had aſſaied him, and had the deniall, as in a matter, the very mention whereof a good Patriot ſhould abhorre. But Doctor BELL a Diuine, who was after STANDISH to preach in the ſame Place, without feare or wit ſeconding their ſeditious attempts, did publiquely in his Sermon read the Bill by them exhibited to him, taking for his text that of the Prophet in the 115 Pſalme: The heauens, euen the heauens are the Lords; but he hath giuen the earth to the ſonnes of men: Thence moſt fooliſhly concluding, that England was giuen to Engliſhmen only, and that therfore it was not to be endured, that Aliens ſhould enioy any part therof. Many things by him ſpoken to this purpoſe, were accepted with great applauſe and approbation of the Vulgar, who out of extreame hatred to Strangers, breathed nothing but ſedition. And to adde more fuell to this fire, it happened that many outrages were about that time committed by ſome of theſe Strangers. This euill then thus ſpreading it ſelfe,

foreiners were euery where ill intreated, and commonly knockt downe in the ſtreets, hauing not offered iniurie to any man. The authors of theſe riots being by the L. Maior committed to priſon, a ſudden rumor ran through the Citie, That on May day next all Strangers ſhould be maſſacred. This without doubt proceeded from ſome of this vnruly crue, and was intended as a watchword to all the faction; but the Strangers made ſo good vſe of it, that they had all withdrawne themſelues before that time, and the Magiſtrates very carefully attended each occaſion, endeauouring to cruſh all tumultuous deſignes in the ſhell. On May day Eue therefore (the next day being the feaſt of the Apoſtles Philip and Iacob, the ſolemnitie thereof is vſually augmented by the liberty granted to the younger fort to ſport themſelues and to make merrie) the Citiſens in generall are by Proclamation commanded to keepe faſt their doores, and to reſtraine their Seruants from going abroad vntill nine of the clocke the next day. But before this had beene throughly proclaimed, an Alderman walking in the ſtreets, ſaw a troupe of young men conſiſting of Apprentices and ſuch like gathered together, and playing at cudgels. He ſharpely reprooued them for not obeying the Kings Edict, withall threatening to puniſh them, if they the ſooner betooke not themſelues euery one to his home. Words not preuailing, he laid hold on one or two, intending to haue committed them. But what reckoning they made of Authoritie, their reſiſtance in reſcue of their Companions ſhewed; and by outcries giuing an Alarme, drew together all the reſt of their Faction in that quarter of the Citie. The fame of this hurly-burly encreaſed their numbers, by ſending mariners, gentlemens ſeruants, beggars, &amp; Citiſens,

 but the greateſt part were Apprentices. Sedition like a torrent carried them headlong, and animated them to all villanie. They breake open the priſons, ſet thoſe at libertie, that were impriſoned for their outrages on ſtraungers, flie about the Citie as in a whirle-wind, rob all forreiners houſes, and not content with their goods, ſeeke after them for their liues. They found their neſts, but the birds were fled. Hauing thus ſpent the night, in the morning hearing the Kings forces to approach, moſt of them ſlipt away, onely ſome thr
                           •
                        e hundred remained (whereof eleuen were women) and being apprehended, ſupplied their places, whom theybefore had freed. They were all arraigned, onely thirteene deſigned for death, whereof, nine ſuffered on diuers gibbets purpoſely erected in diuers parts of the Citie. LINCOLNE, SHERWIN, and two brethren named BETS, Chiefetaines in this ſedition, were carried to▪ Cheapſide, where LINCOLNE was deſeruedly hanged. The Executioner readie to turne off another, was preuented by the Kings gracious Pardon. The minde of man beeing prone to pittie, wee may imagine, that others were well pleaſed at the newes; but certainely the condemned had cauſe to reioice. The Queenes of England, the two Dowagers of of France and Scotland (both of them the Kings Siſters, and then at Court) became inceſſant Petitioners to his Maieſtie, and that on their knees, in the behalfe of theſe condemned perſons: and at length, WOLSEY conſenting (by whome the King was wholly ſwayed) their Petitions were graunted to them, and to the poore men their liues. This was the laſt ſcene of this tragicall tumult, the like whereof this well gouerned Citie had not knowne in manie ages. For the Lawes verie well prouided in that caſe, do vnder a great penaltie forbid Aſſemblies,

eſpecially of armed men, if not warranted by publicke Authoritie.
                     
                        The ſweating ſickeneſſe. In Auguſt and September the ſweating ſickneſſe (termed beyond Sea, Sudor Anglicus, or the Engliſh ſweat) began, a diſeaſe vtterly vnknowne to former ages. Of the common ſort they were numberleſſe, that periſhed by it. Of the Nobilitie, the Lords CLINTON, and GREY of Wilton. The ſymptomes and cure you may finde in Polydore Virgill (in Anno. 1. HENR. 7.) who (as confidently, as I beleeue truely) maintaines, That, this diſeaſe was neuer till then knowne to bee, much leſſe to bee mortall. As if there were a concatenation of euills, one euill ſeldome commeth alone. A Peſtilence ſucceeded this former mortalitie, and ſo raged the whole Winter ſeaſon in moſt parts of the Realme, that the King for feare of infection, attended by a few, was faine euery day to remoue his Court from one place to another.

 thouſand for his charge in building the Cittadell, for the Artillerie, Powder, and Munit on, which hee ſhould leaue there and other two hundred thouſand crownes, partly for the expence of that warre, wherein the Citie was taken, and partly in regard of other Penſions that were due vnto him.
                     For the paiment of which ſummes, the French gaue eight hoſtages; ſo ſaith BELLAY. But our Writers ſpeake of a farre different ſumme, viz. Six hundred thouſand crownes for the Citie, and foure hundred thouſand crownes for the Cittadell: beſides three and twenty thouſand pounds Tournois, which the City of Tournay ought the King: and an annual Penſion of a thouſand Markes aſsigned to Cardinall WOLSEY for renouncing all claime and title to the Biſhopricke of Tournay. For the confirmation of theſe Articles, the Earle of Worceſter, and the Biſhop of Ely, with ſome others, were ſent into France, where both by the King and Princes of the Realme they were magnificently entertained.

                         three and ſixtie yere of his age, died the Emperor MAXIMILIAN, hauing to preuent a diſeaſe, to which hee thought himſelfe inclining, vnſeaſonably taken a Medicine of vncertaine opperation. His death bred an equall deſire in the mindes of two great Princes, who became Competitours for the Empire, FRANCIS King of France, and CHARLES King of Spaine. But

CHARLES, although King of Spaine, yet being by birth (borne at Gand) and diſcent a German, at the age of nineteene yeares was choſen Emperour of Germanie, with the full conſent and ſufferages of all the Princes Electors. This Election, how euer other ſlight matters were pretended, was vndoubtedly the cauſe of the enſuing dreadfull war betweene theſe Princes. The French King taking this repulſe impatiently, meditates nothing but reuenge. And that his deſignes might no way be croſſed by vs, he labors amain for the confirmation of the peace lately agreed vpon betweene HENRY and him. Therefore by the Admirall BONIVET he deales with WOLSEY, that at an enteruiew betweene the two Kings, the League might be ratified. To this end HENRY intends to come to Guiſnes, FRANCIS to Ardres, and a conuenient place betweene both is made choice of for their enteruiew.

                     HEreupon the King ſetting forward towards France, by eaſy iourneis comes to Canterbury, intending there to keepe his Whitſontide. The next day after being the twenty ſixth of May, the new created Emperor CHARLES the fifth in his returnThe Emperour Charles the in Fifth England. from Spaine arriues at Douer, diſtant twelue miles from Canterbury. The King gladly entertaines the newes, and although it were midnight, takes horſe, and within little more than an houre comes by torch light to Douer Caſtle, where the Emperour lay; who ſeaweary was then aſleepe. But being certified of the Kings arriuall, hee ſuddenly apparelled himſelfe, and met the King at the top of the ſtaires. They embraced and ſaluted one another, they long conferred together, and the next morning (beeing Whitſonday) they rode together to Canterburie, 
                        Canterburie.
                        
 the Emperour alway keeping the right hand, and the Earle of Derby bearing the Sword before them both. Canterburie is a Citie more famous for antiquitie, than for moderne beauty. To let paſſe, that it was aboue a thouſand yeares ſince made an Archiepiſcopall Sea, our Chronicles do ſufficiently teſtify, that both in reſpect of priuate mens faire houſes, and the magnificent ſtructure of it's Churches, it antiently excelled the braueſt cities of England. But within theſe few yeares it hath loſt ſo much of it's greatneſſe and beautie, that a man ſhall finde little of Canterburie beſide the name. Why it ſhould ſo much in ſo ſhort ſpace decay, many reaſons may be alledged: As the vicinity of London, which ſwelling like the ſpleene, ſuckes both bloud and moiſture from all the other languiſhing Cities of the Kingdome. Likewiſe the ſubuerſion of Saint AVGVSTINES Monaſterie, the loſſe of Calais, and the pulling downe of Archbiſhop BECKET his Shrine, things which occaſioned a great concourſe of people, and did by their loſſe and ouerthrow much impaire this Cities ſplendor. One only Ornament therof ſuruiues, which is the Cathedrall and Metropoliticall Church, with ſuch a Maieſty piercing the skies (ſaith ERASMVS) that it a far off fills the beholder with deuout amazement. This Church being at firſt dedicated to our Sauiour CHRIST, a few ages paſt degenerated into the nickname of S. THOMAS. This THOMAS ſurnamed BECKET, hauing obſtinatly oppoſed HENRY the ſecond, was in this Church ſlain by certaine ſoldiers: and being afterward canonized for a Saint, his ſepulchre mightily encreaſed the glory of the place. For from thoſe times euen almoſt to our dayes, all ſorts of people from all parts of Europe, ſuperſtitiouſly frequented the Shrine of this vpſtart Saint, with rich oblations indeuoring to procure his fauor. Hence the Monaſtery was ſo inriched, that of it

and the Church ERASMVS ſaid, That euery place was enlightened with the luſtre of moſt pretious and huge ſtones, and the Church throughout abounded with more than Royall Treaſure. But the Shrine eſpecially, that contained the reliques of this Saint, was ſo emboſſed with jewels, that gold was the meaneſt thing about it. Hither accompanied with King HENRY, came the Emperor CHARLES, but whether out of deuotion or curioſitie, I cannot ſay. But this is certaine, that the Cardinall and the Clergie going in proceſſion, to the Church they went directly, where a great deale of time was ſpent in Ceremonious worſhip, and ablations at BECKETS Tome, not onely by the Emperour, but euen by Him, who ſhortly after defaced the Monument, and ſeiſed vpon that infinite Treaſure, heaped vp by the deuout follie of many preceding ages. From the Church they went to the Archbiſhops Palace, where the Queene, Aunt to the Emperour, awaited them, and very ioyfully welcommed her Nephew. Three dayes were ſpent in banketing &amp; paſtimes, and then the Emperour went to his Nauy at Sandwich, the King and Queene to Douer, from whence they paſſed to Calais, that the intended interuiew of the two Kings might worke it's due effects. The ſeuenth of Iune was the appointed day. The place, betweene Ardres and Guiſnes. There theEnterview betwixt the Kings of England and France. two Kings mounted on Spaniſh Gennets, attended by ſuch a multitude of Nobilitie, as the occaſions of a hundred yeres before had not at once brought together the like, incountred each other, both in the floure of their age, the goodlieſt Princes of the world, and moſt expert in all kinde of combates both on horſe and foot. It were needleſſe to ſet forth the magnificence of theſe Princes, when the brauerie of their attendants was ſuch, that the place was thence named The golden campe. Hauing embraced each other on

 horſeback, they alight and betake themſelues to a Pauilion there purpoſely pitched: HENRY attended on by the Cardinall of Yorke, and the Dukes of Norfolke and Suffolke; FRANCIS by the Admirall BONIVET, the Chancellour du PRAT, and ſome other Counſellors. Hauing had familiar conference concerning ſome priuate matters, they gaue order for erecting a Theater, and encloſing a ground for a Tiltyard, that ſo they might ſolace themſelues, whiles their Counſell treated of grauer matters, the concluſion whereof they might at leiſure euery day know by relation. Fourteene dayes theſe Princes gaue each other the meeting, with great concourſe of moſt famous ſoldiers. HENRY then entertained the French King at Guiſnes, in a houſe made of timber (framed partly in England, partly in Holland, and thence brought thither) wherein there were foure Manſions: The out ſide was couered with cloth ſo painted, that it would haue deceiued the beholders for ſquared ſtone: the in ſide was hung with moſt rich Arras, ſo that it euery way ſeemed a moſt artificiall and ſtately Building. The forme of it was much like that of the Exchange at Calais. It being afterward taken aſunder, was tranſported into England, and ſo ſtood the King in little or nothing, ſaith BELLAY. (Whereas wee know, and that by Records, that there were ſent ouer out of England for this Worke, three hundred Maſons, ſix hundred Carpenters, two hundred Painters, Glaſiers, and other Artificers (in all eleuen hundred) which for the ſpace of two moneths laboured continually on this fabricke.) The day enſuing, the French King prepares a banquet: the banqueting houſe was a Canopy euery way extended ſixtie foot, which without was couered with cloath of Tiſſue, within with blew velvet pouldred with golden floures de Lys. At each corner was a Pauilion of the ſame workes: the

cords were of blew ſilke twiſted with gold of Cyprus, which was of great eſteeme. But a moſt impetuous and tempeſtuous winde broke aſunder the cords, and laid all this brauerie in the dirt. Patience par force. The French King ſuddenly makes another banquetting houſe, in that place where there is now a Fort that takes it's name from this banquet. The preparations were extraordinary, and the magnificence outſtripped the reach of humane iudgement. There wanted neither houſes, woods, nor fields for diſport; for many men brought them entire on their backes. But pleaſures muſt haue their intermiſſion, and Kings if not by their Greatneſſe, are by their Affaires ſeuered. HENRY therefore returnes to Calais, and FRANCIS to Boloigne. The tenth of the enſuing moneth, the King gallantly attended, viſited the Emperour at Graueling. The Emperour
                           Henry viſits the Emperor at Graueling in requitall accompanied him backe to Calais. Shewes and banquets are Princes vſuall entertainments. To this end, the King ſo commanding, a round building is made in the forme of an Amphiteatre, eight hundred foot in compaſſe. The ſides were of plankes: in the middle was a pillar made of eight great maſts tied together. This pillar ſupported the weight not onely of the roofe of the whole fabricke, (whither as into a lower Heauen the Moone and Stars had deſcended) but Organs alſo, and places for the receipt of all ſorts of muſicke in aboundance. Theſe places were adorned with tapeſtrie, ſtatues, and curious pictures, inſomuch that the moſt fault finding could not complaine of any want in that kinde. All things were now prepared for the entertainment of ſuch a gueſt, and the banquet readie to be ſerued in, when the ſame miſchance that befel the French Canopy, made our Engliſh Heauen and Earth meet together. God, as diſpleaſed

 with the mad prodigality of theſe two Kings, ſent a tempeſt, the violence whereof ſcattered this counterfeit heauen, blew out aboue a thouſand wax tapers, defaced the glorious thrones prepared for theſe Princes, fruſtrated the expectation of the people, and forced the King to the neceſſitie of another place. But to lec paſſe the tilting, maskes, and gorgeous feaſts during the ſix dayes the Emperor ſtayed at Calais: In theſe ſeueral enterviewes betweene all theſe Princes there was no one ſerious thing done, but this, that a firme Peace, a perpetuall League, &amp; faithfull Friendſhip ſeemed to be concluded on all ſides. For who would haue thought, that it had been poſſible for diſcord it ſelfe to haue diſolued this knot, where CHARLES &amp; FRANCIS attributed ſo much to HENRY, that they made him Vmpier of all controuerſies that ſhould ariſe betweene thē? But that there is ſeldom any heed to be giuen to the Agreements of Princes, where they are tied by no other bands (as of Religion, Affinity, or manifeſt Vtility) than that weake one of their plighted Troth, thoſe foule diſſentions, and bloudy wars which afterwards rent all Chriſtendome, and opened a way for that cōmon enemy of our Faith, may be a ſufficient example. The Emperor after all theſe paſſages of courteſy &amp; humanity, departs toward Graueling, moūted on a braue horſe couered with a foot cloth of cloth of gold, richly beſet with ſtones which the King had giuen him. He would often ſpeak of his Aunts happineſſe, that was matcht to ſo magnificent a Prince. The King ſtaied ſome few days after at Calais, from whence paſſing to Douer, he with all his traine arriued ſafe at London. I cannot but enuy their happines who in ſo little time ſaw 3 the mightieſt Monarchs in Chriſtendom, who for their exploits, &amp; the great alterations happening vnder each of thē, will without doubt be famous through all ſucceeding Ages.

                        The Duke of Buckingham accuſed of treaſon. EDWARD STAFFORD Duke of Buckingham was about this time arraigned of high Treaſon. He was diſcended of a Family, which whether it was more antient or noble, is queſtionable. He deriued himſelf by a direct line frō ROBERT de Stafford, to whom WILLIAM the Conquerour gaue large revenues, which his poſterity greatly inlarged, by matching with the heires female of many noble Families. By the Lady ANNE daughter to THOMAS of Woodſtocke Duke of Gloceſter, who was Brother to EDWARD the Third, hee participated of the Bloud Royall. The firſt honourable title of the Family was of Lord Stafford, the next of Earle of Stafford, as was EDMVND, that married the daughter to THOMAS of Woodſtocke. HVMFREY ſon to EDMVND was created Duke of Buckingham by HENRY the Sixt, who left that Honor to his ſon HVMFREY who was grandfather to this EDWARD by his ſon HENRY the third Duke. How HENRY aſſiſted the Vſurper RICHARD the Third, in oppreſſing EDWARD the Fifth, how he after conſpired with the Earle of Richmond (afterwards HENRY the Seuenth) againſt the Vſurper, but was cut off by the Tyrant before he could bring any thing to paſſe; the hiſtories of thoſe times declare. EDWARD his ſon reſtored to Bloud &amp; Dignities by HENRY 7. for his diſcent, wealth, and Honors, inferior to none but the King, not content with this, was by N. HOPKINS a Charterhouſe Monke induced to beleeue that Heauen had decreed to cut off K. HENRY, after whoſe death he ſhould raigne, and the Crowne be for euer eſtabliſhed on his poſterity. This the Monke affirmed, God the Gouernour of all things, had reuealed vnto him. He further aduiſed him by liberality aud

 curteſy to win the minds of the people, for the time was at hand wherein this ſhould certainly come to paſſe, if it were not through his owne default. The Duke (no ſot, but blinded by ambition) gaue ſuch credit to the Monke, who was either mad, or elſe flattered him in hope of reward, that although the time prefixed for theſe miracles were paſt, yet was he ſtill in hope, fed the Impoſtor with gifts, who fed him with aire, ſecretly vilified the King, and gaue profuſely to all. Nay he could not forbeare, but at longth he muſt brag of the Iuglers promiſes, as hee did to a gentleman named CHARLES KNEVET, to whom he boldly vnmasked himſelfe, and gaue a reaſon of his actions. Vpon KNEVETS accuſation he was arraigned, &amp; condemned the thirteenth of May, and on the ſeuenteenth publiquely beheaded. His death was lamented by many, &amp; the rather for that he was no way faulty, but in his vanity and pride, which ouerthrew him. Being a childe, I haue heard antient men ſay, that by his brauery of apparell, and ſumptuous feaſts he exaſperated the King, with whom in theſe things he ſeemed to contend. But he could by no meanes beare with the intolerable pride of the Cardinall, whoſe hatred not improbably prooued fatall vnto him, rather than did the Kings diſpleaſure: for many times Princes are with leſſe danger offended, than their Mignons. There goes a tale, That the Duke once holding the baſen to the King, the Cardinall when the King had done, preſently dipped his hands in the ſame water: the Duke diſdaining to debaſe himſelfe to the ſeruice of a Prieſt, ſhed the water in his ſhoos. The Cardinall therewith incenſed, threatned him, That he would fit vpon his skirts. The Duke to ſhew that hee ſlighted his threats, &amp; withall, that the King might take notice of the Cardinalls malice, came the next

day to Court, richly (as he vſually was) apparelled, but without skirts to his dublet. The King &amp; many others demanding what he meant by that ſtrange faſhion, he anſwered readily, That it was done by way of preuention, for the Cardinall ſhould not now ſit vpon his skirts. Hee thought he had put a jeſt vpon the Cardinal, to whoſe informations, as proceeding from enuy and ſpleen, he hoped the King would hereafter giue the leſſe credit. But he miſſed his marke: for moſt men were of opinion, that the Cardinalls malice cruſhed him rather, than did the weight of his owne offences. It was the ſaying of CHARLES the Emperor, vpon the report of his death, That the Butchers Dog had killed the faireſt Hart of England Howſoeuer it came to paſſe, the king who had hitherto ruled without bloudſhed, induced by the former reaſons (ſo the Records run) permitted his hands to be ſtained with the bloud of this poore Prince; many lamenting, that the indiſcreet credulity of one man, hauing not attempted ought againſt the Eſtate, ſhould be the ouerthrow of ſo noble a Family. If I might lawfully pry ſo far into Gods iudgements, which are indeed inſcrutable, I would be bold to impute the puniſhment of the Sonne to the Fathers treachery, who conſpired with the Vſurper againſt his lawfull Prince EDW. 5. who by his aſſiſtance was depriued of his life and kingdome. But foraſmuch as that being touched in conſcience, hee manifeſtly repented this fact (for ſeeking to oppreſſe the Tyrant, whom he himſelfe had raiſed, he periſhed miſerably) the Diume Iuſtice (I thinke) ſo far regarded his repentance, that his poſterity are neuertheleſſe Peeres of the Realme, by the title of L. Stafford. The firſt point of wiſdome is, not to run into error; the next, quickly to amēd it.
                     
                     
                        King Henry writeth againſt Luther
                         The King hauing written a booke againſt MARTIN LVTHER, ſent it as a Preſent to Pope LEO the Tenth. This LEO, not yet thirty eight yeares old, was

                           •
                         elected Pope. In which dignity hee behaued himſelfe according to his yeares, profuſely ſpending the treaſures of the Church in hawking and hunting, and other pleaſures not deemed ouer honeſt. Need began at length to pince him, and money muſt be had. Wherupon he reſolues to make vſe of his Keyes, againſt the moſt ſubtill lockes, and ſtrongeſt bars, euer yet held preualent. Indulgences of all ſorts, without diſtinction of time or place, muſt now publiquely be ſ
                           •
                        t to ſale. Saint Peters Church (this was the pretence) was out of repaire, towards which a certaine ſumme of money giuen, would purchaſe pardon of ſinnes, not onely for the Liuing, but for the Dead alſo, whoſe ſoules ſhould thereby bee redeemed from the paines of Purgatorie. But whatſoeuer was pretended, euery one palpably ſaw, that theſe Pardons were granted to get money for his owne reliefe. And foraſmuch as the Commiſſioners demanded it after an impudent and ſhameleſſe manner, they in moſt places incurred the diſlike and indignation of the people, eſpecially in Germany, where they ſaw this facultie of redeeming ſoules from Purgatory, was either ſolde for little or nothing, or played away in their Tauernes. But what ſpeake I of the Commiſſioners? That which made the Germans moſt impatient, was, that the heedleſſe Pope had giuen to his ſiſter MAGDALEN the profit of the exactions of Indulgences in many parts of Germany, and that ſo openly, that euery one muſt needs know it. For all Germany ſpake it, that this money was not gathered for the Pope or the Treaſurie of the Church (whereby peraduenture ſome part of it might be employed to good vſes) but was exacted to ſatisfie
                           Luthers departure from the Church Rome. the greedineſſe of a woman. At that time liued MARTIN LVTHER a Doctor of Diuinity, and an Auguſtine Monke, one who vnder a religious Habit,

did not conſecrate himſelfe to idleneſſe, but to God. It is reported, how truly I know not, that recreating himſelfe in the fields, his companion with whom he then diſcourſed, was ſuddenly ſtricken dead with thunder. He therupon falling into due conſideration of the vncertaintie of death, and of iudgment, left the ſtudy of the Ciuill Law, to which he then applied himſelfe, and renouncing the world, betooke himſelfe to a Cloiſter, where for his deportment he was beyond exception, for learning (eſpecially diuine) he was ſcarce matchable. Vpon this horrible abuſe of the authority of the Keyes, being inflamed with a pious zeale, he could not containe himſelfe, but boldly and bitterly inueighed againſt this groſſe impiety. Neither ſtaied he there, but (ſtorme the Pope neuer ſo much) proceeds to other enormities in the Church of Rome, ſome whereof that Church hath ſince reformed, the reſt religious Princes, by LVTHER awakened out of their dead ſleepe of ſuperſtition, notwithſtanding the practiſes of Rome, haue (God be thanked) exploded. New opinions (eſpecially in matters of Religion) are of themſelues alwayes odious. HENRY being offended with LVTHERS new (as the world then deemed them) Tenets, thought it would proue to his honor, by writing againſt LVTHER, to manifeſt his learning and pietie to the world▪ Herupon vnder his name a book was ſet forth, better beſeeming ſome antient and deep Diuine, than a youthfull Prince (whom although he earneſtly endeauoured it, yet his affaires would not permit to bury himſelfe among his books) which many thought to haue beene compiled by Sir THO. MOORE, ſome by the Biſhop of Rocheſter, and others (not without cauſe) ſuſpected to be the worke of ſome other great Scholler. Whoſoeuerwrit it, LVTHER repli ed in ſuch ſort, that although his holy zeale were approved by many: yet thoſe many

 could haue wiſhed him more temperate, and reſpectiue of the Maieſty of Kings. This Booke was ſo acceptable to the Pope, that according to the example of ALEXANDER the Sixt, who entituled the King of Spaine, Catholique: and of that Pope whoſoeuer he were, that gaue the French King the title of Moſt

                        Chriſtian; he decreed to grace King HENRY and his Succeſſors with that honorable one of Defender of the Faith. Which ſeverall titles are by theſe Princes retained to this day. But LEO long ſurviued not his gift, about the end of the yeare dying (as is ſuſpected) by poiſon. In the meane time the exulcerated mindes of the Emperour and the French King (according to the nature of ambitious hatred, that for it's owne ends makes all cauſes iuſt) burſt out into open wars; for the compoſing whereof each of them had formerly agreed to refer themſelues (if any differences ſhould ariſe) to the arbitrement of HENRY. HeCardinall Wolſey and others ſent embaſſadors to the Emperour and French King therefore ſends to each of them Embaſſadours, the Cardinall of Yorke, the Earle of Worcester, and others, who ſhould, if it were poſſible, reconcile theſe inraged Princes. All they could do, proued but an endeavor: for when they thought they had compaſſed their deſires, ſudden newes came, That the Admirall BONIVET had by force taken Fuentaraby a Towne of the Emperours in Biſcay. The Emperour would not then ratify the Agreement, vnleſſe this towne were redeliuered; which the French denying to do, all fell to pieces againe, and the War was renewed. After their deuoir in this cauſe, our Embaſſadours went directly to Bruges to the Emperour, of whom for a fortnight, which was the time of their ſtay there, they had royall entertainment. But he held the Cardinall in ſo great eſteeme, that it was apparant hee was not ignorant, how powerfull the Cardinall was with his Prince. And here perhaps it would not be amiſſe

(in reguard of thoſe times) to let the Reader know the pompe and ſtate of this Cardinall, how many Gentlemen attended him apparrelled with velvet, and adorned with gold chaines, &amp; then how many were cloathed in skarlet coats, the skirts whereof were guarded with veluet the full bredth of a hand. But let him gueſſe HERCVLES ſtature by the length of his foot. Such was the brauerie of his attendants, that in CHRISTIERNE King of Denmarke, and other Princes then reſiding at Bruges, it bred amazement. It was alſo reported, that he was by Gentlemen of the beſt ranke ſerued on the knee, a kinde of ſtate which Germany had yet neuer knowne. He ſpent a huge maſſe of money in that Embaſſage, and that (as it is thought) not againſt his will. For he by all meanes ſought the Emperors fauour, hoping that LEO, although much younger, either cut off by treachery, or his owne intemperance, might leaue the world before him: And then were it no hard matter for him, being vnderpropped by the Emperour and our King, to be aduanced to the Papacy. Wherefore at the firſt bruit of his death hee poſted away PACEY the Deane of Pauls into Italy, with Mandates to certaine Cardinalls whom he thought reſpected him, that they ſhould do their beſt in his behalfe. But before hee could reach Rome, he was certainely informed, that ADRIAN (ſometimes Tutor to the Emperour, and then Viceroy of Spaine) was already elected, by the name of ADRIAN the Sixt.
                  
                  
                     Anno Dom. 1522. Reg. 12.
                     
                     WOLSEY neuertheleſſe was as full of ambitious hope as euer. For ADRIAN was a decrepit weake old man, and

 therefore not likely (as indeed he did not) to ſurvive him. In the mean time he might make an aſcent, by which his ambition might clime. He therefore ſeeks to aduance the Emperors deſignes more than ever, &amp; to that end he perſuadeth HENRY to denounce war againſt the French; for that he denied to ſurrender Fuentaraby, &amp; had broken the Couenants made between them, in not ſtanding to the arbitrement of HENRY, as both CHARLES &amp; FRANCIS had compromiſed; at what time it was likewiſe decreed, that HENRY ſhould declare himſelf an enemy to the obſtinate refuſer. The French diſcerning the ſtorme before it came, arreſts all Engliſh ſhips, commits the Merchants to priſon, and ſeizeth their goods to His own vſe; ſtops all Penſions due either to HENRY for Tournay, or to his Siſter the Dowager of France, for her Ioincture. The French ſhips and Merchants in England find the like entertainment, the Hoſtages giuen by the French for the foreſaid ſums, are committed to cloſe priſon, and the French Embaſſadour confined to his houſe. Levies are made throughout England, &amp; great preparatiōs for another expedition into France. To which the King being wholly bent, Embaſſadors ſuddenly arrive from the Em
                           •
                        erour; whoſe requeſt was, That He would joine his forces with the Imperialls and that, if it ſo pleaſed Him, CHARLES would within few dayes be in England, that ſo they might perſonally confer &amp; aduiſe what courſe they were beſt to run. Many reaſons mooued the Emperour by the way to touch at England. His Grandfather FERDINAND being dead, his preſence was neceſſarily required in Spaine, whither he muſt paſſe by England. He feared leſt this breach betwixt vs &amp; France, might eaſily be made vp, he being ſo far diſtant. He had an Aetna in his breſt, which burned with extreame hatred toward the French, and was

confident, that his preſence would raiſe our ſparkle to a flame. They might perſonally treat &amp; conclude more ſafely &amp; ſecurely than by Agents &amp; Poſts, of whom in matters of moment no wiſe man would make vſe, vnles forced by neceſſity. But the chiefe cauſe (as I coniecture) of this his ſecond cōming into England, was, that he was weary of WOLSEY, with whom he ſaw it was impoſſible long to continue friend. For the Cardinall by his importunity, one while for the Papacy, another while for the Archbiſhopricke of Toledo, did much moleſt him, who had determined to afford him nothing but good words. He diſdained not in his letters to a Butchers ſon, to vſe that honorable compellation of Couzen, &amp; whether preſent or abſent, he afforded him all kind of honor whatſoeuer. But when the Cardinall craued any erneſt of his loue, ſome excuſe or other was found out to put him by, yet ſo, as ſtill to entertaine him with hopes. But WOLSEY was ſubtill, and of a great ſpirit. And theſe deuiſes were now growne ſo ſtale, that they muſt needs be perceiued. CHARLES therfore neglecting his wonted courſe by WOLSEY, ſtudies how to be aſſured of the King without him. For this no fitter means could be thought of, then this interview. The King was naturally courteous, loued the Emperour exceedingly, and repoſed great confidence in him▪ CHARLES therefore hoped that by the familiarity of ſome few weekes hee might make the King his owne. But HENRY (he thought) would not long continue ſo, vnleſſe he could ſome way leſſen his fauor toward the Cardinall. This he hoped might be effected by admoniſhing the King, that he was now paſt the yeares of a childe, and needed no Tutor, that it was not fit he ſhould ſuffer himſelfe to be ſwaied by a Prieſt, one in all reaſon better skilled in the myſteries of the Altar, than of

 State, againſt which in this reſpect (beſides the abuſe of his power) he muſt needs be ſome way (though perhaps vnwillingly) faulty. The addition of ſome aſperſions withal
                           •
                         were thought not to be amiſſe, which if not true, ſhould at leaſt carrie a ſhew of truth. That the Emperour practiſed ſomething in this kinde, the conſequences make it more than probable. HENRY being a noble Prince, and one that ſcorned money as much as any one breathing, was very glad of the Emperors comming; yet was his Treaſury very bare, and ſo great a Gueſt could not be entertained without as great expences. CHARLES vpon notice of the Kings pleaſure, attendedThe Emperor, Charles the ſecond time in Enland.

Two daies he ſtaied at Douer before the King came. At length he came, and welcommed him with all Princely entertainment, profeſſing, that no greater happineſſe could betide him on earth, then the inioying his Maieſties moſt deſired company, though but for ſo ſhort a time. From Douer, taking Can

                           erbury in the way, they came to Greenwich, where the Queene awaited the longed for preſence of her Nephew. Frō thence to London, where they werereceiued by the Citiſens with the ſolemnities vſuall at the Coronation of our Kings. At Whitſontide both Princes came to Pauls, where they heard the Cardinall ſay Maſſe. Sports agreeable to the entertainement of ſuch a Gueſt, were not wanting. But when mention was made of renewing the League, Windſore
                        
was thought fitteſt for the Treaty, it being not aboue twenty miles from London, and a place altogether as it were compoſed for pleaſure. Windſore is ſituated in aWindſore. large Plaine vpon the bankes of the riuer Thames. The Caſtle (being the chiefeſt in England, for ſtrength comparable to that of Douer, but far exceeding it in greatneſſe and beauty) is built on a hill. This Caſtle containes beſides the Kings Court, a goodly Church by EDWARD the Third dedicated to the bleſſed Virgin and Saint George; adioining to which is the Colledge, where are the houſes of the Deane, Prebendaries, and Vicars Chorall, where alſo liue twelue Souldiers diſcharged of the wars (called Knights) and hauing penſions, who in their habits are bound daily to frequent the Church, there to pray vnto God for the Knights of the Illuſtrious Order of the Garter. Of this Order the Caſtle is the Seat, where according to the firſt Inſtitution, the Knights are to be inſtalled, on certaine dayes are to offer and to do ſome other duties. Here, vpon Corpus Chriſti day theſe Princes hauing on the robes of the Order, in their ſtalls heard Maſſe, and receiuing the Sacrament, bound themſelues by oath inuiolably to obſerue the Conditions of this new League, the chiefe Articles whereof were theſe:
                     
                        The Conditions of the League concluded with the Emperor. That they ſhould with joint and as great forces as they could, inuade France: That the Emperor ſhould yearely pay to the King as much as was due to Him and his Siſter, from the French, viz. 133000 crownes: That the Emperor ſhould at conuenient yeares take to Wife his Couſin german the Lady MARY, the Kings onely Childe (who after raigned,
                        
                        and at age of fortie yeares was married to PHILIP the Emperors ſon) That he by whoſe default it ſhould happen, that this match ſhould not ſucceed, ſhould pay the other fiue hundred thouſand crownes: and for assurance of this, the Emperour ſhould put Saint Omers and Aires into the Kings hands.
                     One would haue thought, it had paſſed the reach of human policy, to haue diſſolued this band. But ſhortly after broken it was, and could neuer after be firmely knit againe. After eight dayes ſtay at Windſore, theſe Princes went to Wincheſter, and from thence to Southampton, where was the Emperors Fleet, conſiſting of a hundred and eighty ſhips. Here on the firſt of Iuly the Emperor tooke ſhip and made for Spaine.
                     
                     In the meane time the Earle of Surrey hauing gathered a Fleet, landed neere Morleys in Bretaigne, forced the towne, and burned it. And hauing waſted all the Country therabout, he went into Picardy, to ioine with the Imperialls. Some Forts they tooke and razed They beſieged Heſdin, but without ſucceſſe: For Winter comming on, and our men dying apace of the Flux, they were faine to ſetſaile homeward.

God grant they may at length, conſidering the common danger, rowſe vp themſelues, and with joint reſiſtance repell this Enemy of CHRISTS Croſſe, who although he be far enough from ſome, is too neere to the fartheſt.

In the meane time a Parliament was held at London, wherein the States being certified of the neceſſity of war, and what a faire occaſion was offered for the recouery of France, but that the war was like to be defectiue, in regard of the weakenes of it's ſinews; a great ſum of money was eaſily granted. The Kings of France exact money of their ſubiects at their pleaſure; the Kings of England do not vſually, without a Parliament, wherein the pretence of war with France was wont to be a great motive of the ſubiects liberality. And indeed France was at this time greatly diſtracted, being oppreſſed with ſo many enemies abroad, and having to do with vndermining treachery at home; inſomuch that our aduantages, if wiſely followed, ſeemed to promiſe vs whatſoeuer we could hope for. FRANCIS was on the one ſide preſſed with the war of Milan, on the other ſide by the Emperor: at home CHARLES Duke of Bourbon reuoltedThe Duke of Bourbon reuolts. from him, by letters inciting our King to the recouery of his hereditary (as he acknowledged) Right in France, whereto, reſpectleſſe of paine or perill, he promiſed his faithfull aſſiſtance. Neither was this offer to be ſlighted; for he had conceiued an implacable hatred againſt his Prince, and was able to make a great party in France. His valor and experience were after manifeſted by the greatnes of his exploits performed

 in a ſhort ſpace, FRANCIS being taken priſoner by him, Rome ſacked by his conduct, the Pope beſieged in the Caſtle of Saint Angelo, and faine at laſt to ranſome himſelfe and his Cardinalls at a mightie rate. Theſe notable aduantages were all let ſlip through the neuer ſatisfied ambition and malice of one man; but ſo, that it made way for that great alteration which afterward hapned in the eſtate of the Church. Bleſſed be that Almighty Power, that conuerts the wicked deſignes of men to the good of his Church, and his owne glory.
                     The Parliament being diſſolued, the Duke of Suffolke is ſent into France with thirteene thouſand men, viz. ſix hundred Launces, two hundred Archers on horſebacke, three thouſand Archers on foot, fiue thouſand Halberdiers, ſeuenteene hundred drawne out of the Garriſon of Calais, and two thouſand ſix hundred Pioners. The Engliſh and Imperialls joining, invaded the French Dominions, tooke Roye, Mondidier, Bohain, Bray, Chaſteaubeau, and marching within twenty two leagues of Paris, put the City in a terrible affright, vntill the Lord of Brion ſent by the King with the comfortable newes of the comming of the Duke of Vendoſme with foure hundred Launces, makes them take heart againe. After theſe exploits, our Forces toward the end of December were recalled.

In the meane time on the fourteenth of September, died Pope ADRIAN the Sixth: in whole place IVLIVS MEDICES was after two moneths elected. Here WOLSEY againe failed in his hopes▪ who expected by the helpe of the Emperor and the King, to haue ſucceeded ADRIAN. But the Emperor neuer intended this dignity for him (for he did his beſt for IVLIVS.) Neither indeed had hee been
                           •
                         willing, could hee haue aduanced him to the Chaire▪
                        
For the Cardinalls were in ſo ſhort a time weary of ADRIAN, who was a ſtranger, and little acquainted with the Court of Rome. And the Colledge repined to ſee any other ſit in Saint Peters Chaire, then an Italian, or at leaſt one bred vp in Jtaly. Neuertheleſſe WOLSEY was ſo incenſedagainſt the Emperour, by whoſe default (he was verily perſuaded) it happened that he miſſed of the Papacy, that now bidding hope farewell, he was poſſeſſed with a deſire to be reuenged on the Emperour for this conceiued iniury. Hee therefore on a ſudden turnes French, and to hinder the Emperours proceedings, procured our Forces to be called home, pretending the ill ſeaſon of the yeare, with promiſe that the next Spring they ſhould be returned againe.
                  
                  
                     Anno Dom. 1524. Reg 16.
                     
                     BVt CHARLES hauing not giuen any iuſt cauſe of breach, WOLSEY dared not publiquely to profeſſe his affection toward the French, with whom notwithſtanding by the intercourſe of one IOHN IOACHIM a Genoueſe he maintaines intelligence, and without the priuity of HENRY laies the platforme of a new League. The war was very hot betweene the Emperour and the French. FRANCIS had already taken Milan, and with a mighty army ſate downe before Pavia, vowing not to riſe from thence vntill he had taken it. The Duke of Bourbon and the Imperialls were in number little inferior, &amp; ſtood in want of nothing but money (indeed all in all) wherwith the Pope, the Venetians, &amp; our HENRY were to furniſh him. CLEMENT, although he had obtained the Papacy chiefely by CHARLES his meanes, detained the money which his predeceſſor ADRIAN had promiſed; ſaying, It beſeemed not his

 Holineſſe, to intermeddle with the wars of Princes. The Venetians at firſt anſwered coldly, at length plainely denied: for they ſtood in awe of the French, and were jealous of the Emperours ambition. And the malicious Cardinall had ſo played his part with HENRY, that the Imperialls diſappointed of the
                           Wolſey perſuades the King to a diuorce. monethly ſummes due from him, were exceedingly diſtreſſed. Now WOLSEY to make a ſeparation betweene theſe two Princes, told the King, that he certainly found that the Emperour did but delude him: that hee had indeed promiſed to marry the Kings Daughter; but a rumour was raiſed by the Spaniards, That this match would be little either for his profit or his honor, foraſmuch as vpon the point, the Lady MARY was but a Baſtard, begotten, it is true, in wedlocke, yet inceſtuouſly, the match being by the Eccleſiaſticall Conſtitutions made vnlawfull: for he could not lawfully marry Queene CATHARINE, who had beene before married to his brother Prince ARTHVR: That both the old and new Teſtaments were expreſſe againſt ſuch coniunctions, and that therefore it lay not in the Pope to diſpence with them. It is certaine that the Emperors Embaſſadors had thus diſcourſed with WOLSEY vpon this very point, and WOLSEY made his vſe of it accordingly. Hee knew the King doated not on his Queene, and buzzed theſe things in his eares, in hope he would bethinke himſelfe of a new wife. This taking as he deſired, and the King lamenting, that for lacke of Iſſue he ſhould leaue the Kingdome to a Childe, to a Woman, to One, whom, in reguard the lawfulneſſe of her birth was queſtionable, hee could not with ſafety make his Heire; the Cardinall propoſed vnto him for wife MARGARET Ducheſſe of Alançon a beautifull Lady, and Siſter to the King of France.
                        
He knew, that vpon his Diuorce from CATHARINE, and Marriage with the other, HENRY muſt of neceſſity fall foule with the Emperour, and without hope of reconciliation, ſtrongly adhero to the French. That this diuorce was for theſe reaſons ſet on foot by WOLSEY, the Imperiall Hiſtorians do all accord; neither for ought I euer read, do Ours deny. But howſoeuer it came to paſſe, this is certaine, That HENRY in ſtead of furniſhing the Emperour with the money he had promiſed, demanded all that he had already lent.
                  
                  
                     Anno Dom. 1525. Reg. 17.
                     
                     
                        
                           Richard Pacey Deane of Pauls falleth mad. RICHARD PACEY Deane of S. Pauls, had been not long before ſent to Venice as an Agent concerning our affaires in Italy. He was a very learned man, and worthy (had God been ſo pleaſed) of a better Deſtiny. He knew not the change of the Kings minde. But perceiuing the monethly pay due from the King, according to promiſe came not, of whole Honor, which now lay at ſtake, he was very tender, he was much diſcontented. To ſalue all, he aſſaied to take vp ſo much money of certaine Merchants, with whom it ſeemes he in part preuailed. But the ſum was ſo ſmall, that it ſtood the Imperialls in as ſmall ſteed, &amp; yet ſo great, that it exceeded the ability of his priuate eſtate to make ſatisfaction. Vpon notice of the Kings alienation from the Emperor, he fell irrecouerably diſtracted.
                     
                        The battel of Pavy.
                         In the meane time the Duke of Bourbon and the Imperialls were in ſo great diſtreſſe and want of all things, that vnleſſe they could by ſome ſtratagem or other draw the French to commit all to the fortune of a battaile, the Army muſt needs

 diſband. They diſquiet and trie the French (eſpecially in the night preceding Saint Mathias day, which was the day of the Emperor CHARLES his natiuity) with many falſe alarmes. They make two ſquadrons of horſe, and foure of foot. The firſt conſiſting of ſix thouſand Lanſquenets, Spaniards, and Italians, vnder the command of the Marquis of Guaſto. The ſecond of Spaniſh foot vnder the Marquis of Peſcara. The third &amp; fourth of Lanſquenets, vnder the Viceroy LAVNOY and the Duke of Bourbon. They came to a wall called the Park-wall, &amp; vnder the covert of the night caſt downe aboue ſixty paces, enter within it, the firſt ſquadron taking the way to Mirabell, the reſt marching toward the Kings Army. The King thought the Imperials went to Mirabell, as making choice of the plaine open fields to fight in. He was vnwilliug to leave the beſieged at liberty, &amp; yet the Plaines were aduantageous for his Horſe. He therfore commands his Artillery to be diſcharged, which ſomewhat endamaged them; and though vnwilling, drawes his Forces out of their trenches (then which the Imperials deſired nothing more) &amp; oppoſed the whole ſtrength of his Army againſt thē. But paſſing before the Cannon, hinders their execution. They that tooke the way to Mirabell, now turne head, and both Armies engage themſelues in a cruell fight, wherein the King more following Shadowes then Subſtances, and the idle rumors of the vulgar, then the meanes of a moſt certaine and glorious victory, is ouerthrowne and taken priſoner, looſing beſide the floure of the French Nobilitie (almoſt all either taken or ſlaine) at one blow the Duchie of Milan, the poſſeſſion whereof had made him Lord of the greateſt part of Lombardy. Pope CLEMENT, who had left the Emperour for the French (which hee afterward repented) often

aduertiſed the King, that the Imperialls were in great diſtreſſe and want, that they continually mutinied for lacke of pay: that he had taken ſo ſufficient order with the King of England and the reſt of the Confederates, that they ſhould continue bare enough of money. If therefore he would but hold his hand, and forbeare to fight, neceſſity enforcing the Imperialls to disband, he ſhould be victorious without bloudſhed. But he was not capable of ſo good advice. His Forces were great (yet ſhort of his account, his Captaines treacherouſly abuſing him, in not furniſhing thoſe numbers of foot for which they receiued pay) and it were equally a diſhonour to him, either to ſeeme to avoid the Enemy, or to ly ſtill ſo long at a ſiege, to no purpoſe. The Diume Power hauing decreed to chaſtiſe him, permitted him through impatience to run headlong into theſe errours, which ſo deepely plunged him in thoſe calamities, that without Gods eſpeciall favour had proved fatall to him and his France.
                     
                     When I conſider this and many other the like chances happening as well in the courſe of a private mans life, as in publique affaires, I cannot but wonder at the ſottiſh valour of this age, wherein rather than endure the touch of the leaſt (though fal

How many braue men do wee daily ſee, wonderfull ingenious in this kinde of folly? who ſtanding vpon I know not what Points of Honor, vpon the leaſt offence challenge the field, and wilfully ſeeke out their owne deſtruction. What in Gods name is become of the patience of that lingering FABIVS, who quietly bearing the bitter taunts and mockes of his Souldiers, of the People, and the Senate, yet brought home an eaſy, though late victory? We are certainely too blame,

 with the Dog we catch at the ſhadow and looſe the ſubſtance. Of our Saviour we ſhall learne, that it is the higheſt point of fortitude, In patience to poſſeſſe our ſoules. And according to ARISTOTLE, True valour is regardles of ill language.

                     In the tent of the captiue King, the letters of the Pope and our King, concerning their late league with the French, being found, the Duke of Bourbon now knew the cauſe why ſupplies of money came in ſo ſlowly. And PRAT Lieger here for the Emperor, vpon notice of it, without leaue withdrew himſelfe from Court, and on the ninth of Aprill ſecretly departed the land. In the meane time HENRY little ſuſpecting that theſe ſecret compacts were knowne to the Emperor, about the end of March ſent Embaſſadors to him CVTBERT TONSTAL Biſhop of London, &amp; Sir RICHARD WINGfield Knight of the Garter; by whom Hee did congratulate his late victorious ſucceſſe, admoniſhing him to a cloſe purſuit of his fortunes: That if his Jmperiall Maieſty intended with greater forces to oppreſſe the already Vanquiſhed▪ in regard of the ſtrict

But the King wants money, and muſt now diſſemble with his ſubiects. He pretended war with France, and with this key hopes to open his Subiects coffers. The expectation of ſupplies by a Parliament would prove tedious; ſome ſhorter courſe muſt be taken. MoneyMoney demanded and commanded by Proclamation. is therfore demanded by Proclamation, &amp; that no leſle then according to the ſixth part of euery mans Moveables▪ Divers great perſonages appointed Commiſſioners, vſe all faire meanes to draw the people to contribute. But although they ſate in Commiſſion in divers parts of the Kingdome at one and the ſame time, they were ſo far from preuailing, that as if the people had vniuerſally conſpired, it was every where denied, and the Commiſſioners very ill entreated, not without further danger of ſedition and tumult. Hereupon the King calls a Parliament to be held at London: wherein he profeſſeth himſelfe to be vtterly ignorant of theſe intollerable courſes by ſuch burthenous taxations. The King diſclaiming it, euery one ſeekes to free himſelfe. The Cardinall was at laſt faine to take all vpon himſelfe; proteſting, That as a faithfull Seruant, he had no further end in it, than the profit of his Lord the King; and that hee had aduiſed not onely with his Maiesties Councell (which they all acknowledged) but alſo with the Learned in the Lawes both Diuine and Humane, whoſe opinion it was, that the King might lawfully take the ſame courſe that PHARAOH did, who by the miniſtery of IOSEPH ſequeſtred a certaine portion of euery mans priuate eſtate for the publique good. But the diſlike of the people occaſioned by this (though fruitleſſe) proiect, was greater than could be removed by this excuſe.
                     And yet this proiect was not altogether fruitleſſe, the Kings apparant want affording a ſufficient pretext of deferring the war with France vntill another yeare. Neither was it the Kings intent to make vſe of his advantages

 ouer the French, who now lay open to all his blows. HENRY hauing put away his wife, the Emperour muſt needs be netled, and then the amity of France would ſtand him in ſome ſteed. Indeed CATHARINE was a noble and a vertuous Lady, but ſhee had liued ſo long, as to make her Husband weary ofThe King fals in Loue with Anne Bolen.
                         her. He affected the daughter of Sir THOMAS BOLEN Treaſurer of his Houſhold. Her he intends to marry, and to be diuorced from the other: For he did in his ſoule abhor this inceſtuous Match, and it ſtood not with the publique weale, that He ſhould live ſingle, eſpecially the lawfulneſſe of his Daughters birth being ſo queſtionable. Hee married not againe for his pleaſure, but to ſettle the Kingdome on his lawfull Iſſue. The Learned (as many as Hee had conferred with) did generally pronounce the firſt marriage void: yet would Hee haue it lawfully decided, that with a ſafe conſcience He might make choice of a ſecond. Thus far had WOLSEY willingly led him, hoping to haue drawne him to a Match in France. But Hee was of age to chooſe for himſelfe, and had already els where ſetled his affections.

At the ſame time were created HENRY FITZ-ROY the Kings naturall fonne by ELIZABETH BLOVNT Daughter to Sir IOHN BLOVNT Knight, Earle of Nottingham, and Duke of Richmond and Somerſet▪

                     Cardinall WOLSEY this yeare laid the foundation

of two Colledges, one at Ipſwich the place of his birth, another at Oxford, dedicated to our Sauiour
                           Wolſey to build two Colledges. CHRIST, by the name of Chriſt-Church. This later, though not halfe finiſhed, yet a magnificent and royall Worke, a moſt fruitfull Mother of Learned Children, doth furniſh the Church and Commonwealth with multitudes of able men, and amongſt others, acknowledgeth me (ſuch as I am) for her Foſter-childe. The other, as if the Founder had alſo been the foundation, fell with the Cardinall, and being for the moſt part pulled downe, is long ſince converted to private vſes. The Cardinalls private eſtate (although it were wonderfull great) being not ſufficient to endow theſe Colledges with revenues anſwerable to their foundation, the Pope conſenting,Demoliſheth fou Monaſteries. he demoliſhed fourty Monaſteries of meaner note, and conferred the lands belonging to them, on theſe his new Colledges. It hath been the obſervationSacrileoge puniſhed. of ſome, That this buſineſſe, like that proverbiall gold of Tholouſe, was fatall to thoſe that any way had a hand in it. We will hereafter ſhew what became of the Pope and the Cardinall. But of five, whom he made vſe of in the alienation of the guifts of ſo many religious men, it afterward happened, that two of them challenging the field of each other, one was ſlaine▪ and the other hanged for it: a third throwing himſelfe headlong into a Well, periſhed wilfully: a fourth, before that a wealthy man, ſunke to that low ebbe, that he after begged his bread: and Doctor ALLEN the fift, a man of eſpeciall note, being Archbiſhop of Dublin, was murthered in Jreland. I could wiſh, that by theſe and the like examples, men would learne to take heed how they lay hands on things conſecrated to God. If the Divine Iuſtice ſo ſeverely puniſhed thoſe that converted the abuſed (yet not regarding the abuſe, but

 following the ſway of their ambitious deſires) goods of the Church to vndoubtedly better vſes; what can we expect of thoſe that take all occaſions to rob and ſpoile the Church, hauing no other end, but onely the inriching of themſelues.
                     LVTHER had notice of HENRY his intended Divorce, and that from CHRISTIERNE the expelled King of Denmarke, who eagerly ſolicited him to write friendly vnto the King; putting LVTHER in hope, that HENRY being a courteous Prince, might by milde perſuaſions be induced to embrace the reformation which LVTHER had begun. And indeed LVTHER foreſeeing the neceſſary conſequences of this Divorce, was eaſily entreated, and did write vnto the King in this ſubmiſſiue manner:
                     
                        
                           Luther writes to the King. He doubted not but he had much offended his Majeſty by his late reply: but he did it rather enforced by others, then of his owne accord. Hee did now write, preſuming vpon the Kings much bruited humanity; eſpecially being informed, That the King himſelfe was not Author of the Booke againſt him, which thing he vnderſtood was captiouſly cavilled at by ſome Sophiſters. And hauing occaſion to ſpeake of the Cardinall of Yorke, he called him the Caterpillar of England: He vnderſtood, the King did now loath that wicked ſort of men, and in his minde to fauour the Truth. Wherefore he craueth pardon of his Majeſty, beſeeching him to remember, that wee being mortall, ſhould not make our enmities

immortall. If the King would be pleaſed to impoſe it, hee would openly acknowledge his fault, and blazon his Royall Ʋertues in another Booke. Then hee wiſhed him to ſtop his eares againſt thoſe ſlanderous tongues that branded him with Hereſy: for this was the ſumme of his Doctrine, That wee muſt bee ſaued through Faith in Christ, who did beare the puniſhment of our ſinnes in every part, and throughout his whole body, who dying for vs, and riſing againe, raigneth with the Father for euer. That he taught this to be the Doctrine of the Prophets and Apoſtles: and that out of this poſition hee ſhewed, what Charity was, how we ought to behave our ſelues one towards another, that we are to obey Magiſtrates, &amp; to ſpend our whole life in the profeſsion of the Goſpell. If this Doctrine containe any Jmpiety or Errour, why do not his Aduerſaries demonſtrate it? Why do they condemne him without either lawfull hearing, or confutation? In that he inveigheth againſt the Pope and his Adherents, hee doth it not without good reaſon, foraſmuch as for their profits ſake, they teach things contrary to what Chriſt and the Apoſtles did, that ſo they may domineere ouer the Flocke, &amp; maintaine themſelues in Gluttony &amp; Idlenes. That this was the marke at which their thoughts

 and deeds aimed: and that it was ſo notorious, that they themſelues could not deny it. That if they would reform themſelues by chā
                        ging their idle and filthy courſe of life maintained by the loſſe and wrong of others, the differences might eaſily be compoſed. That his Tenets were approued by many Princes and Eſtates of Germany, who did reverently acknowledge this great bleſsing of God, amongſt whom he wonderfully deſired he might ranke his Maieſly. That the Emperour and ſome others oppoſed his proceedings, he did not at all wonder: for the Prophet DAVID had many ages ſince foretold, That Kings and Nations ſhould conſpire againſt the Lord and against his Chriſt, and caſt away his yoke from them. That when he did conſider this and the like places of Scripture, he did rather wonder that any Prince did fauor the doctrine of the Goſpell. And to conclude, he craued a fauorable anſwer.
                     
                        The Kings anſwer. 
                        The King made a ſharpe reply to LVTHERS letter, accuſing him of baſe inconſtancy. He ſtands in defence of his Booke, 
                        which (hee ſaid) was in great eſteeme with many Religious and Learned men. That he reuiled the Cardinall (a Reuerend Father) was to be regarded as from him from whoſe impiety neither God nor man could be free.

That both Himſelfe and the whole Realme had found the profitable and wholſome effects of the Cardinalls endeavours, who ſhould reape this fruit of LVTHERS railing, that whereas he loued him very well before, hee would now favour him more than ever: That among other of the Cardinalls good deeds, this was one, that he tooke eſpeciall care, that none of LVTHERS leproſy, contagion, and hereſy, ſhould cleaue to, or take roote in this Kingdome: Then he vpbraided him with his inceſtuous marriage with a Nunne, a crime as hainous and abhominable as any.
                     
                     
                        At this anſwer (which the King cauſed to be printed) LVTHER grieued much, blaming his friends that had occaſioned it; ſaying, That he writ in that humble manner only to pleaſe his Friends, and that he now plainely ſaw how much he was miſtaken. That he committed the like errour in writing friendly at the requeſt of others, to Cardinall CAIETAN, GEORGE Duke of Saxony, and ERASMVS, the fruits whereof were, that he made them the more violent. That the ſhewed himſelfe a foole, in hoping to find Piety and Zeale in Princes Courts, in ſeeking Chriſt in the Kingdome of Satan, in ſearching for IOHN BAPTIST among the Cloathed in Purple. But being he could not prevaile by faire meanes, he would take another courſe.
                     The late mention of ERASMVS puts me in minde of a Booke written by him either this or the yeare paſſed, at the entreaty of the King and the Cardinall (as he himſelfe in an Epiſtle confeſſeth) entituled, De Libero Arbitrio. Whereto LVTHER made a quicke reply, writing a booke De Servo Arbitrio.

                        A breach with the Emperor. MAny reaſons might move the Emperour to ſeeke the continuation of a Peace with England. The French (although they concealed it, their King beeing not yet at liberty) intend to revenge their late ouerthrow: The Turke prepares for Hungary, the King whereof (LEWIS) had married ANNE the Emperors Siſter: Almoſt all Italy by the Popes meanes combined againſt CHARLES, whoſe power is now becom formidable: And Germany it ſelf, the Boors hauing lately bin vp in arms, being ſcarce pacified, do yet every where threaten new tumults. In this caſe the enmity of HENRY muſt neceſſarily much impeach his proceedings. But many things againe vrge him on the other ſide: his Aunts diſgrace: (for of this he long ſince had an inkling) The late League concluded vnder hand with the French: But that which ſwaied aboue all, was, the diſlike of his promiſed match with the Kings Daughter. That the Queene his. Aunt might be reconciled to her Huſband, there might yet be ſome hope. The League with France (eſpecially the French Kings caſe being now ſo deſperate) might be as eaſily broken, as it was made: But this Match did no way ſort to his minde, which he had either for loue, or for ſome other private reſpects, ſetled els where. ISABELLA Siſter to IOHN King of Portugall, was a brave beautifull Lady, and had a Dowry of nine hundred thouſand Duckets MARY was neither marriageable, nor beautifull; yet her by agreement muſt he marry without any other Dowry then thoſe foure hundred thouſand crownes which he had borrowed of HENRY. The wars had drawne his Treaſury dry, and his Subjects

in Spaine being required to relieve their Prince, doe plainly (perhaps not without ſubornation of ſome principall perſons) deny it, vnleſſe hee marry ISABELLA, one in a manner of the ſame Linage, of the ſame Language and Nation, and of yeares ſufficient to make a mother. By way of ſeruice (Cuſtome growing to a Law) they are to giue their King at his marriage foure hundred thouſand Duckets: if hee will in this be pleaſed to ſatisfie their requeſt, they promiſe to double the vſuall ſumme. For theſe reaſons, when HENRY ſent Embaſſadours to treate againe (whether ſincerely or no, I cannot ſay) concerning the renewing of the League, the marriage of the Ladie MARY, and of warre in France to bee maintained at the common charge of both; CHARLES anſwered but coldly, and at laſt even in the very nuptiall ſolemnities ſends to excuſe his marriage to the King, whereunto the vndeniable deſires of his ſubiects had in a manner forced him. Some doe farther adde, that concerning that part of the Embaſſage, of warre againſt France, our demands were ſuch, as if they had beene purpoſely coined by WOLSEY to force the Emperour to the prioritie of an apparent breach. For the King demanded no ſmaller ſhare in the conqueſt, then Picardie, Normandie, Guien, Gaſcoigne, with the title of, King of France: and that the Emperour partaking both of Perill and Charge ſhould himſelfe ſerve in Perſon. But CHARLES wanting money, and tired with continuall perill, if he regard either his ſafetie and eaſe, or his profit, muſt not give his aſſent, eſpecially conſidering, that the Captive King made larger offers, and thoſe with Peace, then theſe, yea although he became victorious, with Warre, the event whereof being alwayes doubtfull, no man can aſſure himſelfe of wiſhed ſucceſſe. Neither indeed did HENRY expect any other iſſue of his Embaſſie, then

 a flat refuſall. For at the ſame time he deales with theThe King endevours to r

Regent (the Captive Kings Mother) to ſend over ſome truſtie perſon, with whom he might conſult of the maine chance; which ſhe gladly did, diſpatching away the Lord of Brion Preſident of Rouen, and IOHN IOACHIM with a large Commiſſion, and Inſtructions by all ſubmiſſive and faire Language to perſwade the King to perſiſt in the proſecution of this new League. For indeed ſhee much feared, leaſt the conſideration of his advantages over the tottering Eſtate of France might make him flie off againe. France was already diſtreſſed: what would it bee, if the Emperour preſſing hard on the one ſide, and the Duke of Bourbon a homebred enemy revolting, beſides many other occaſions, the Engliſh ſhould infeſt it on the other ſide? In England theſe Agents found their entertainment ſuch, that they could not but hope well, eſpecially making meanes to the Cardinall, who yet ſwayed the King. WOLSEY long ſince diſaffected the Emperour, but now made his hate apparant. CHARLES before the ba

CHARLES.
                     After this victorie he ſent one or two, ſubſcribed barely with his Name, without the vſuall ſolemne forme, or any ſignification of favour or reſpect. Theſe were evident tokens of an alienated minde, and WOLSEY durſt view hates with him. Neither did he deale otherwiſe with HENRIE, then as one beneath him, being now puffed vp with the conceipt of that great victory, for the obtaining whereof HENRIE

did beare a part in the charge, though in deed not ſo great as he promiſed. The Kings affaires now ſtood vpon thoſe termes, that renouncing the ſtrict alliance with the Emperour, hitherto by ſo many ties kept inviolable, he muſt make a party with the French.
                     
                     Brion therefore at the Counſaile Table having Audience, deplores his Princes calamitie, and the miſeries inflicted vpon his Countrey by their late overthrow. He calleth to minde what Trophies the Engliſh erected in France, when the Eſtate of it was moſt flouriſhing, withall acknowledging, that France being now as it were in the Sun-ſet of its Fortune, occaſion was offred of advancing the Engliſh Colours farther then ever. But it would neither beſeeme ſo magnanimous a King, nor would it be for the good of England, at this time to invade it. A generous minde ſcorneth to inſult over one already deiected. Neither would the victorie, beſide the fortune of warre, want its dangers, being to be communicated with one, alreadie become ſo potent, that no leſſe, then the vnited Forces of all Europe would ſerve to ſtop the current of his fortune, which muſt neceſſarily be done, vnleſſe we could be content willingly to vndergoe the miſeries of a Spaniſh ſervitude. Hee therefore craved of his Maieſtie, that leaving the Emperour (who puffed vp with his late ſucceſſe contemned his beſt Friends) Hee

 would vouchſafe to make a League with the King his Maſter, whom in this ſo great a time of need if He would bee pleaſed to raiſe as it were from the ground, He ſhould by ſo great a benefit oblige him to a faithfull Friendſhip, which hee ſhould vpon all occaſions be readie to manifeſt, vnleſſe for foule Jngratitude hee had rather vndergo the cenſure of the Chriſtian World.
                     Having delivered thus much in Latine, Sir THOMAS MORE (afterward Lord Chancellor) returned this anſwer in Latine likewiſe▪
                     
                     That the King was well pleaſed, that the French acknowledged Hee wanted not power to revenge old iniuries: that having felt his Force, they ſhould alſo taſt of his Bounty: that Hee would do the vtmoſt of his indeuour to ſet their Captive King at libertie. Which if Hee effected, Hee hoped when Hee had occaſion to make vſe of their King, hee would not be vnmindfull of ſo good a turne freely done in ſo vrgent a ſeaſon. Jn the meane time Hee was content to make a perpetuall Peace with them. As for the Emperour, He would conſider what to determine of him.
                     
                        A League concluded with the French King. So a moſt firme League is concluded with the French (the Regent vndertaking for her Sonne) and a ſeparation from the Emperour ſo openly made, that the firſt thing concluded betweene them

was, That it ſhould not bee lawfull for the French King in lieu of his ranſon to conſigne any part of his Kingdome to the Emperour. The French were glad of this League, who now began to conceiue ſome hope of good, being ſecure of England. Indeed it made ſo great an impreſſion in the heart of FRANCIS, that in his care of our affaires for many yeares together hee ſhewed himſelfe mindfull of ſo great a benefit. Theſe things were done in the winter ſeaſon.
                     
                        The French King ſet at liberty. A little after FRANCIS having beene a yeare Priſoner in Spaine was vpon theſe Conditions at length ſet at liberty.
                     
                        That as ſoone as he came into France, hee ſhould conſigne the Dutchie of Burgoigne to the Emperour: That hee ſhould quit the Soueraignette of Flanders and Arthois: That hee ſhould renounce all his right pretended to the Dutchy of Milan and Kingdome of Naples: That he ſhould reſtore to his honours the Duke of Bourbon, and the reſt that had revolted with him: That he ſhould marrie Eleonor the Emperour's Sister Queene of Portugall: That he ſhould pay the whole ſummes of money heretofore due to the King of England, his Sister the Queene of France, and Cardinall VVolſey,
                         The payment whereof the Emperour had vndertaken, that wee might not be endammaged by partaking with him.
                     For the performance of theſe and other things of leſſe moment, FRANCIS not onely bound himſelfe

 by Oath, but alſo delivered his two Sonnes FRANCIS the Dolphin and HENRY Duke of Orleans, who ſhould remaine Hoſtages in Spaine vntill all things were duly performed. FRANCIS as ſoone as hee entred into his Realme ratified all the Articles of the Treaty, but that concerning the Dutchie of Burgoigne, which hee pretended he could not alienate without the conſent of his ſubiects, Having therefore aſſembled the Eſtates of the Countrey for the debating of this matter, vpon a ſudaine in the preſence of the Emperours Embaſſadours is publiquely proclaimed the League made betweene the Kings of England and of France, the Pope, the Venetians▪ Florentines, and Suiſſes, (called the Holy League) for the common libertie of Italy. The Embaſſadours much amazed, and ſeeing ſmall hopes of the Dutchy of Burgorgne (for which they came) returne into Spaine, and advertiſe the Emperour, that if he will bee content with a pecuniarie ranſon, and free the two Princes, the King was willing to pay it▪ other Conditions he was like to have none.
                     
                        The King of Hungary ſlaine by the Turkes.
                         In the meane time SOLYMAN not forgetting to make his profit of theſe horrible confuſions, invaded Hungary with a great Army, overthrew the Hungarians, ſlew King LEWIS the Emperours Brother in law, and conquered the greateſt part of the Kingdome. For the obtaining of this victorie our Raſhneſſe was more availeable to him, then his owne Forces. The Hungarians in compariſon of their Enemies were but a handfull: but having formerly beene many times victorious over the Turkes, they perſuaded the young King that hee ſhould not obſcure the ancient glory of ſo warlike a Nation: that not expecting the aides of Tranſylvania, he ſhould encounter the Enemy even in the open fields, where the Turkes in regard of their multitudes of horſe might be thought

invincible. The event ſhewed the goodneſſe of this counſell▪ The Army conſiſting of the chiefe ſtrength and Nobilitie of the Countrey was overthrowne, a great ſlaughter made, and the King himſelfe ſlaine with much of the Nobility and chiefe Prelates of the Realme, and among them TOMORAEVS Archbiſhop of Col

STEPHEN GARDINER a ſtirring man, one very learned and that had a working ſpirit, did then at Rome ſolicit the Kings Divorce from Queene CATHARINE. Wherein although vſing all poſſible meanes, and that CLEMENT was no friend to the Emperour, yet could hee not procure the Popes favour in the King's behalfe Nay, whether he would not cut off all meanes of reconciliation with the Emperour, if need were, or whether being naturally ſlow, hee did not vſually diſpatch any matter of great moment ſpeedily; or peradventure (whereto the event was agreeable) that he perceived it would be for his profit to ſpin it out at length; or (which ſome alledge) that he was of opinion, that this marriage was lawfully contracted, ſo that he could not giue ſentence on either ſide without either offence to his Conſcience, or his Friend▪ the Pope could not be drawne to determine either way in this buſineſſe. Theſe delayes much vexed the King. If matters proceed ſo ſlowly▪ vnder CLEMENT, on whom hee much preſumed, what could hee expect

 from another Pope, one perhaps wholy at the Emperours devotion? Hee therefore reſolved to endevour the advancement of WOLSEY to the Chaire; from whom hee promiſed to himſelfe a ſucceſſe anſwerable to his deſires. HENRY therefore ſends away ſpeedy Poſts to GARDINER with ample inſtructions in the behalfe of WOLSEY, willing him to worke the Cardinals, ſome with promiſes, others with guifts, ſome with threats, others with perſuaſions, and to omit no meanes that might be any way availeable. But this was to build Caſtles in the aire. The meſſenger had ſcarce ſet forth, when report that had made CLEMENT dead, had againe revived him.

                         the Imperials vnder the conduct of the Duke of Bourbon, who was himſelfe ſlaine in the aſſault marching in the head of his troupes. The Pope, Cardinals, Embaſſadours of Princes, and other Nobles hardly eſcaping into the Caſtle of Saint Angelo, were there for ſome dayes beſieged. At length, deſpairing of ſuccours, and victuals failing, the Pope for feare hee ſhould fall into the hands of the Lanſquenets for the moſt part ſeaſoned with LVTHERS doctrine, and therefore paſſionate enemies to the Sea of Rome, agreeth with the Prince of Auranges (after the death of the Duke of Bourbon choſen Generall by the Army) yeilding himſelfe and the Cardinals to him, who kept them cloſe Priſoners in the Caſtle. Rome was now ſubiect to all kind of crueltie, and inſolencies vſuall to a conquered Citie intended for deſtruction. Beſide Slaughter, Spoile, Rapes, Ruine,

the Pope and Cardinals were the ſport and mockerie of the licentious multitude. HENRY pretended much griefe at this newes; but was inwardly glad that ſuch an occaſion was offred, whereby he might oblige CLEMENT in all likelihood (as he had iuſt cauſe) offended with the Emperour for this ſo inſolent and harſh proceeding. Whereupon hee diſpatcheth WOLSEY into France, who ſhould intimate to the King, his perpetuall Ally, what a ſcandale it was to all Chriſtendome that the Head of it ſhould bee oppreſſed with Captivitie, a thing which did more eſpecially concerne FRANCIS his affaires. The Cardinall ſet forth from London about the beginning of Iuly accompanied with nine hundred Horſe, among which were many Nobles, The Archbiſhop of Dublin, the Biſhop of London, the Earle of Derby, the Lords SANDS, MONTEGLE, and HARENDON, beſides many Knights and Gentlemen. WOLSEY found the French King at Amiens, where it is agreed, that at the common charge of both Princes, warre ſhall be maintained in Italy to ſet the Pope at libertie, and to reſtore him to the poſſeſſions of the Church, HENRY contributing for his part thirtie thouſand pounds ſterling a moneth.

                        who brought him to London, where he was met by twelue hundred horſe, who conducted him to his lodging in the Biſhop of Londons Palace. Two dayes after, hee went by water to Greenwich fower miles beneath London, where the King oft reſideth. There hee was very ſumptuouſly entertained by the King and the Cardinall of Yorke. Having had Audience, the Cardinall having often accompanied him at London and Greenwich, brought him to a houſe which he had built a little before, ten miles aboue London, ſeated vpon the bankes of Thames, called Hampton Court. (The Cardinall gave it afterward to the King, &amp; it is this day one of the King's chiefeſt houſes) The Embaſſador with all his Attendants was there feaſted by him foure or fiue dayes together. The Chambers had hangings of wonderfull value, and euery place did glitter with innumerable veſſels of gold and ſilver. There were two hundred and foureſcore Beds, the furniture to moſt of them being ſilke, and all for the entertainment of Strangers onely. Keturning to London, we were on Saint MARTINS day invited by the King to Greenwich to a Banquet the most ſumptuous that ever I beheld, whether you conſider the diſhes, or the Markes and Playes, wherein the Ladie MARY the Kings Daughter acted a part. To conclude, the King and MONTMORENCY having taken the Sacrament together, the King for himſelfe, MONTMORENCY in the behalfe of FRANCIS ſwore the obſervation of the League. The King beſtowed great gifts on euery one, and diſmiſſed MONTMORENCY, who left the Biſhop of Bayeux Leiger for his King, to endevour the continuance of the amitie begun betweene theſe Princes.
                     
                     Shortly after were ſent into France Sir THOMAS BOLEN Viſcount Rochfort, and Sir ANTHONY BROWNE Knight, who together with IOHN CLERRE Biſhop of Bath and Wells Leiger in France, ſhould take the French King's Oath, not to violate the late League in any part, and to preſent him with the Order of the Garter.
                     
                        
We had now made France ours. Nothing remained but to let the Emperour know the effects of the late Confederacy. To this end Sir FRANCIS POINTZWar proclaimed againſt the Emperor. and Clarentieux King at Armes are diſpatched away to the Emperonr, to demand the moitie of the bootie gotten in the battaile of Pavie, and the Duke of Orleans (one of the French Kings Sonnes left Hoſtage for his Father) to be delivered to HENRY▪ who had borne a ſhare in the charges of that war, and therefore expected to partake in the gaines: To command him to draw his Army out of Italy, and not to diſturbe the peace of Chriſtendome by moleſting CHRIST'S Vicar. This if he refuſed to do (neither was there expectation of any thing elſe) they ſhould forthwith defie him. They execute their Commiſſion, and perceiving nothing to be obtained, Clarentieux and a certaine French Herald being admitted to the Emperous preſence, do in the names of both Kings proclaime war agaiuſt him. CHARLES accepts it chearefully. But the Embaſſadors of France, Ven

Whervpon the Emperour's Embaſſador is detained vntill the truth be knowne, as it ſhortly was by the ſafe returne of them both.

                     POpe CLEMENT was of himſelfe naturallyThe inconſtancie of the Pope. ſlow: but his owne ends made him beyond the infirmity of his nature protract time in this cauſe concerning the Kings Divorce. Bearing himſelfe as neuter betweene the Emperor and the French King, hee makes them both become iealous of him. And war being renewed in Italy, hee perceives himſelfe likely againe to become a prey to the Conquerour. Which if it ſhould happen, hee muſt betake himſelfe to the King of England, of whoſe helpe hee was certaine, as long as his cauſe did vncertainly hang in ſuſpence. But if hee ſhould determine in the behalfe of the King, would he in gratitude be as beneficiall, as hope (or feare of offending) had made him? That he much doubted.
                     Theſe thoughts poſſeſſing the Pope, CAESAR'S affaires in Italy began to decline, almoſt all the Townes throughout the Realme of Naples out of hatred to the inſolent Spaniard, and affection to the French, making offer of their Keyes, and receiving Gariſons of French. CLEMENT therefore did not now much ſtand in awe of the Emperour, much againſt whoſe minde he was intreated to ſend a LegateCardinall Campegius ſent into England.
                         into England, LAWRENCE CAMPEGIVS Cardinall and Biſhop of Salisbury, who together with the Cardinall of Yorke ſhould have the hearing of this Cauſe ſo long controverted to no purpoſe. And the more to teſtifie his affection to the King, he did by a Decretall Bull (but privately drawne) pronounce the Kings marriage with CATHARINE to bee void. This Bull was committed to the Legate, with theſe inſtractions, That having ſhewed it to the King and

the Cardinall of Yorke. Hee ſhould withall ſignifie to them, that he had authoritie to publiſh it: but not to give ſentence, vntill hee received new inſtructions; telling him, that he was content the King ſhould enioy the benefit of it (and it may be hee was then ſo minded) but that it ſtood him vpon to haue this buſineſſe delayed, vntill he had ſufficiently ſecured himſelfe from the Emperour. Theſe were the pretences of the old Fox to the Legate. But his meaning was to make vſe of all ſeaſons, and to turne with the weather. The ninth of October to London comes the Legate, the King having given order to the Citie for his ſolemne entertaiment. But the old mans infirmitie fruſtrated their preparations: hee was grievouſly tormented with the gout, and would bee privately brought into the Citie. After a few dayes reſt, carried in a chaire, he was brought to the King's preſence, to whom his Secretary made a Latin Oration, wherein having much complained of the extreme crueltie of the Imperials in the ſacking of Rome; he vſed many words to ſignifie, that the Kings pious bounty ſhewed in his liberally relieving them in ſo needfull a ſeaſon was moſt acceptable to the Pope and the whole Colledge of Cardinals. To this ſpeech EDWARD FOX (afterward Biſhop of Hereford) returned an anſwere in Latine, wherein he declared, That his Maieſtie was much grieved at his Holineſſe calamitie, foraſmuch as man is naturally touched with a feeling of anothers miſeries. That He had not onely performed what could bee expected from him as a man; but had alſo done the part of a friend for a friend, and what was due from a Prince to CHRIST'S 
                           Ʋicar on earth. He did therefore hope, that in reguard of his filiall obedience to the Holy Sea, if it ſhould happen that He ſhould ſtand in need of its aſsiſtance and authoritie, his Holineſſe would be pleaſed readily to grant thoſe things, which it might beſeeme a Sonne to crave of the common Mother.
                        
 Thus much paſſed in publique. The King and the Legates conferring in private, CAMPEGIVS aſſured the King of the Popes forwardneſſe to pleaſure him. CAMPEGIVS was indeed no bad man, and ſpake truly, what hee thought. For CLEMENT knowing how difficult a matter it was to deceive a man that was no foole, by one conſcious of the guile, and that was not deceiued himſelfe; made the Legate beleeue, that in this matter of the Divorce hee would be readie to doe for the King whatſoeuer hee ſhould demand.
                     After theſe paſſages, the Legates ſpent ſixe whole moneths in conſultation only concerning their manner of proceeding in the Kings Divorce. In the meane time the King vnderſtanding, that among his ſubiects, but eſpecially the women kinde, this his action was much traduced, as if Hee tooke this courſe more to ſatisfie his Luſt, then his Conſcience; to give a ſtop to all farther rumours, having aſſembled all the Nobles of the Realme, Iudges, Lawiers, and as many of the better ſort of Commonsas could conveniently attend, vpon the eight of November made an Oration to this effect:

                        ſsiſtance ſo behaved Our Selfe, that Wee hope Wee haue neither given you cauſe to complaine, nor Our Enemies to glory. No foraine power hath indevoured ought againſt you, but to his owne loſſe; neither have Wee employed Our Armes any where, but We haue triumphantly erected Our

glorious trophies. So that whether you conſider the ſweet fruits of plentifull Peace, or the glory of Our warlike exploits, We dare boldly avouch, Wee have ſhewed Our Selfe not vnworthy of Our Ancestors, whom (without offence bee it ſpoken) Wee have in all points equalled. But when wee reflect vpon the neceſſary end of Our fraile life, We are ſurpriſed with feare, leaſt the miſeries of future times ſhould ſo obſcure the ſplendour and memory of Our preſent felicitie, that as the Romans did after the death of Auguſtus, ſo you may hereafter bee forced to wiſh with teares, either that VVe had never beene, or might have perpetually lived to governe you. VVee ſee many here preſent, who in reguard of their age might have beene parties in the late Civill warres, which for eightie yeares together ſo miſerably rended this Realme, no man knowing whom to acknowledge for his Soveraigne, vntill the happie Coniunction of Our Parents did not reſolve, but tooke away all cauſe of farther doubt. Conſider then, whether after Our death you can hope for better dayes, then when the Factions of Yorke and Lancaſter diſtracted this Realme. VVee have a Daughter, whom VVee the more affectionately tender, becauſe ſhee is Our ſole Jſſue. But VVee would have you know, that having lately treated with

 Our deare Brother of France, concerning a match betweene this Our Daughter, and Henrie Duke of Orleans his yonger ſonne, both of Ʋs were well pleaſed with this alliance, vntill one of his Privy Counſell made a queſtion of Our Daughters birth; for it was much to bee doubted, leaſt ſhe were to be held illegitimate, being begotten of Ʋs and that Mother, who had before beene married to Our deceaſed Brother: ſaying, it was vtterly repugnant to the Word of God, that any one ſhould marry his Brothers Widow; wherefore he was of opinion, that this match with Our moſt beloved Spouſe was to be deemed no other then inceſtuous. How grievouſly this relation afflicted Vs, God the Searcher of Our hearts knowes. For theſe words did ſeeme to queſtion, not onely Our deare Conſort, and Our Daughter, but euen the very eſtate of Our ſoule, which after death muſt neceſſarily vndergo eternall and inevitable torments, if being admoniſhed of ſo horrible an Incest, We ſhould not indevour an amendement; And for your parts, you cannot but foreſee how great dangers by reaſon of this doubt do threaten you and your Poſterity. Being therefore deſirous (as the caſe indeed required) to bee reſolved in this point, Wee first conferred with Our Friends, and then with the moſt learned in the Lawes

both Divine and Humane; who indeed were ſo farre from ſatisfying Ʋs, that they left Ʋs more perplexed. Wee therefore had recourſe to the Holy Apoſtolique Sea, to the Decree whereof VVe thinke it fitting, that Our Selfe and all others ſhould bee obedient. To this and no other end (We call immortall God to witneſſe) have wee procured this Ʋenerable Legate. As for the Queene Our moſt beloved Conſort, whatſoever women may tattle, or ill willers mutter in private, We do willingly and ingenuouſly profeſſe, that in nobleneſſe of Mind ſhe far tranſcends the greatneſſe of her Birth: ſo that if wee were now at liberty and free for a ſecond choice, We take God to witneſſe, among all the plenty of the worlds Beauties wee would not make choice of any other (if lawfully wee might) then of this Our now Queene, one in regard of her mildneſſe, wiſdome, humility, ſanctity of minde, and converſation (We are verily perſwaded) not to be paralleled. But when We conſider, that We are beſtowed on the world to other ends, then the purſuite of Our owne pleaſures: We have thought it meet rather to vndergo the hazard of an vncertaine iudgement, then to commit impiety againſt God the liberall Giver of all bleſsings, and ingratitude againſt Our Countrey, the weale and ſafetie

 whereof each one ſhould prefer before his private life or fortunes. Thus much have you heard from Our owne mouth. And we hope, that you will hereafter give no heed either to ſeditious detractions, or idle rumours of the people.
                     This Oration tooke according to the divers diſpoſitions of the hearers: ſome lamenting the King's, but many more the Queenes caſe, every one doubting, and fearefull of the event. Some few weary of the preſent eſtate deſired a change even to worſe, rather then a continuance of the preſent. And by theſe the courſe the King had taken (not approved by the vulgar) as pious and impoſed on him by his owne and the publique neceſſitie, was according to the nature of hopefull flattery moſt highly applauded.

                        The ſuite of the Kings Divorce. AT length about the beginning of Aprill the King reſiding at Bridewell, at the Blacke Friers in London began the ſuit concerning the King's Divorce. There was that to be ſeene, the like whereof the Hiſtories of no other Nation afford: A moſt puiſſant Monarch, actually Soveraigne and bearing rule in his Realme, being cited by the voice of of an Apparitor, made his appearance perſonally before the Iudges. The ceremonies in a matter ſo vnuſuall, and indeed otherwiſe of great moment, require an accurate and large relation beyond the intended ſhortneſſe of this Hiſtorie. A Chaire of State whereto was an aſcent of ſome ſteps was placed above for the King, and by the ſide of it another (but a little

lower) for the Queene. Before the King, at the fourth ſtep ſate the Legates, but ſo, as the one ſeemed to ſit at his right hand, the other at the left. Next to the Legates ſtood the Apparitors and other Officers of the Court, and among them GARDINER (after Biſhop of Wincheſter) appointed Regiſter in this buſineſſe. Before the Iudges within the limits of the Court ſate the Archbiſhop of Canterbury with all the other Biſhops of the Realme. At the farther end of each ſide were the Advocates and Proctors retained for each partie: for the King, SAMPSON after Biſhop of Chicheſter, BELL after Biſhop of Worcester, TREGONEL, and PETERS Father to the now Lord PETERS, all Doctours of Law: For the Queene, FISHER Biſhop of Rocheſter, and STANDISH Biſhop of Saint Aſſaph, with RIDLEY (Doctor whether of Divinitie or Law I know not, but one) who had the eſteeme of a very learned man. All things being thus formally ordered, the Apparitor willed by the Regiſter to cite the King, cried, HENRY King of England come into the Court, who anſwered, Here I am. The Queene being likewiſe cited (CATHARINE Queene of England come into the Court) made no anſwere, but riſing from her ſeate went directly to the King, to whom on her knees, purpoſely raiſing her voice that every one might heare her, ſhee is reported to have ſpoken to this effect:
                     
                        
                           The Queens ſpeech to the King before the Legates. Sir, J humbly beſeech your Maieſtie ſo to deale with me at this preſent, that I may neither have cauſe to complaine of Iniuſtice, nor that you have debarred me the favour of your wonted Clemency. J am here a Woman and a Stranger, deſtitute of Friends and Counſaile, ſo that plead for my ſelfe J cannot, and whom

 J may elſe employ, J know not. My kindred and Friends are farre off, neither can J ſafely rely on any here in a matter of ſo great conſequence. They that are here retained for mee, are no other, then whom you have beene pleaſed to appoint, and are your owne Subiects, who if they would deale vprightly (which few will beleeve they dare do) yet can they not here withſtand your determinate will and pleaſure. But what have wretched J committed, that after twenty yeares ſpent in peaceable wedlocke, and having borne you ſo many Children, you ſhould now at length thinke of putting me away? I was J confeſſe the Widow of your Brother, if at leaſt ſhe may be accompted a Widow, whom her huſband never knew. For I take Almighty God to witneſſe, and J am perſwaded you cannot be ignorant of it, that I came to your bed an vnſpotted Ʋirgin; from which time how J haue behaved my ſelfe, I am content to appeale even to them, whoſoever they are, that do wiſh mee least good. Certainly whatſoever their Ʋerdict may be, you have alwayes found me a moſt faithfull (ſervant I may better ſay, then) wife, having never to my knowledge withſtood your pleaſure ſo much as in ſhew. J alwayes loved thoſe, whom J thought you favoured, without questioning their deſerts. J ſo carefully farthered

and procured your pleaſures, that I rather feare, I have offended God in too much indeavouring your content, then that I have any way failed in the leaſt performance of my duty. By this my obſervance vnto you, if ſo be you ever thought it worthy of reguard, by our common Iſſue, by the memory of my Father, whom you ſometimes held deare, I do humbly beg, that you would be pleaſed to defer the farther hearing of this cauſe, vntill having ſent into Spaine, I may thence be adviſed by my Friends, in this caſe what courſe to take. If then in Iuſtice it ſhall be thought meet to rend me from you, a part of whom I have ſo long beene (the apprehenſion whereof doth more terrifie me, then death) I will even in this continue my long obſerved courſe of obedience. But as often as I bethinke me of the wiſdome of Our Parents, by whoſe indevours and conſent this Match was ratified, J cannot but hope very well of my cauſe. Your Father was for his admirable wiſdome accompted a ſecond Salomon, neither can Spaine throughout the whole Succeſsions of the Kings of ſo many Kingdomes produce any one, who may parallell my Father Ferdinand: and what kinde of Counſailours muſt we thinke theſe Princes had, that all ſhould as it were conſpire to hurle Ʋs into the miſeries of an incectuous

Marriage? No queſtion was then made concerning the lawfulneſſe of this Match, and yet thoſe times afforded learned men, yea and (whereof to my harme I have had experimentall knowledge) in holineſſe of life and love of the Truth far ſurpassing the Flatterers of theſe times. (VVhich laſt wordes ſhee therefore ſpake, becauſe ſhee had heard, that all the Biſhops of the Realme had by a common Decree pronounced againſt the Marriage. And indeed ſuch a Decree ſubſcribed and ſealed by each of them was afterward in the preſence of the King read publiquely in the Court, Fiſher Biſhop of Rochester excepting againſt it, who denied, that hee had aſſented to it, and obiected forgery to the Archbiſhop of Canterbury for putting to it in ſteed of Biſhop Fiſhers, a falſe Seale and a counterfeit hand.)
                     
                        The Queene depart. th. The Queene having ſpoken thus much, ariſing, after her due obeiſance to the King, when every one expected ſhee would have returned to her ſeate▪ made haſt out of the Court. Every one amazedly wonders what the Queene intends. But before ſhee had gone far, the King commanded the Apparitor to call her backe againe: The Apparitor obeying, the Gentleman who ſupported her, told her ſhe was called; to whom ſhee replied, I heare it very well, but go you on. I cannot hope for iuſtice in this Court: let them proceed against me in what manner they will, I am reſolved not to ſtay. So away ſhee went, and would never after be

perſuaded to make her appearance either perſonally or by a Protector. After ſhe was gone▪ the King commended her in thoſe termes, that might befit a great affection and her excellent vertues: withall proteſting how deſirous he was to continue in that eſtate, ſo that neither his ſoule nor the Common-wealth might be endangered by it. Here WOLSEY interrupted him, beſeeching his Maieſtie, that foraſmuch as it was bruited, that hee had perſuaded Him to this Divorce; His Maieſty would vouchſafe to ſignifie to the preſent Aſſembly how farre this report was true. The King, although that hee knew that in this fame lied not, yet to ſecure his Favourite from the generall hate of the people, affirmed, the Biſhop of Bayeux having firſt made ſcruple of it, to have firſt adviſed him to this courſe, and that the Biſhop of Lincolne his Confeſſor, and other Biſhops with whom he had conferred, did the like. Theſe were the Acts of the firſt day.
                     
                        Reaſons for the Divorre. This caſe was for a moneth or two held in controuerſie, the Kings Advocates alledging, that
                     It was not in the Popes power to ratifie this Marriage, which as prohibited by the Law of Nature the Scripture had pronounced vnlawfull: That Catharine had beene lawfully married to Prince Arthur the King's elder Brother, and that the Nuptials were publiquely ſolemnized, no man could deny: and many circumſtances did manifest the conſummation of the Marriage by a carnall coniunction.
                     
                        Reaſons againſt the Divorce. On the otherſide the Queenes Advocates maintained,
                     The Law which forbad the Iewes to marrie their Brothers wife, to bee Iudiciall and

 not Morall, and therefore abrogated by Chriſt: but ſo far forth as the Church had retained it, it was by the authority of the ſame Church diſpenſable, eſpecially being they were confident, that the forealledged conſummation could no way be proved.
                     Thus each ſide pleaded, and time paſſed on. The King obſerves Cardinall CAMPEGIVS to go more coldly to worke then he was wont, from whom HeeThe Popes inconſtancy. before this expected the promiſed deciſion. But fortune had ſince that turned her wheele. The Emperours affaires proſpered in Italy, and CLEMENT knew it was not the way to wipe out the remembrance of an old offence by committing a new. Hee found ſome other pretence to ſend one FRANCIS CAMPANA into England; but his chiefe errand was to will CAMPEGIVS to burne the Bull, whereby the King's marriage had before beene pronounced void, and to returne to Rome with ſpeed. But the newes of the Popes ſickneſſe at the ſame time made him deferre the execution of his Mandate. For if CLEMENT ſhould die, the Cardinall might with ſafetie gratifie the King, who had conferred on him the Biſhopricke of Sarisbury, and to whom the Cardinall had promiſed ſucceſſe anſwerable to his deſires: And if hee ſhould permit the King to be thus illuded, he feared he might be accompted, not onely ingratefull, but alſo treacherous. But hee ſhortly vnderſtood the Pope was well, whoſe Mandate he muſt obey, and the Bull as if for Here
                              •
                           ie muſt be condemned to the fire.
                     In the meane time the King, who was deeply in loue with ANNE BOLEN, according to the nature of Lovers counting each minute by the houre, quickly

reſented this change, and never reſted, vntill hee knew the whole carriage of the matter. Then firſt fell his wrath like thunder on WOLSEY, whoſe witWolſey fals.
                         had hitherto made all his proiects feaſible▪ And hee could not beleeve, but that it was in his power to effect this alſo▪ Here I cannot chooſe but cry out with Comoedian,

                              IOVE and yee Gods, how hard a thing
                           It is, to ſerve a raging King.
                        
                     
                     Full twenty yeares had WOLSEY ſerved the King, behaving himſelfe ſo, that hee grew powerfull and wealthy beyond a private fortune, and to the reſt of the King's Titles had procured the addition of that rich one of, a good Prince. For as often as I conſider how laudably HENRY had hitherto ruled, and behold the calamities of enſuing times, I cannot but accord with them, who aſcribe the ſway which he did beare over all the Princes of Chriſtendome to the excellency of WOLSEY his counſailes. But WOLSEY being taken away, to whom ſhall we impute thoſe effects of Luſt, Tyrannie, and Avarice, two Wives killed, two put away, ſo many (and among them many of the greater ſort) put to death for their Religion only, extremitie only differing in the manner vſed by Hanging againſt Papiſts, by Fire againſt Heretiques, (theſe were the termes of thoſe dayes) &amp; the Church (or rather the Common-wealth) horribly ſpoiled and robbed of her Patrimony? Certainly had WOLSEY ſate at the Sterne, the King had never like a Ship deſtitute of a Pilot, beene carried to and fro with ſuch contrary and vncertaine motions. But inordinate

 greatneſſe is alwayes a burthen to it ſelfe, the waight whereof is augmented by the vſuall attendance of publique enny and hatred the misbegotten Elfes of long and powerfull happineſſe.
                     WOLSEY, the King once offended, began preſently to totter, and at his firſt frowne as at the roaring of a Lion (before any harder courſe was taken with him) was ſo deiected, that although he after ſeemed a little to lift vp his head, yet was hee never able to ſtand on his feet. Nay, the King being once alienated from him would never after admit him to his preſence. Behold power of baſe Detraction (yet I will not exclude the the greatneſſe of the Cardinals wealth already devoured in conceit) which wipes away the remembrance of the faithfull ſervice of ſo many yeares, and the conſideration of ſo great glory purchaſed to the King by WOLSEY'S labours. I am not ignorant what things were obiected againſt him. But they carry ſo little ſhew of probability, that I ſhould much ſuſpect his iudgement, that would give any credit to them. Vntill it was knowne that the King inraged at the ſlow proceedings in the cauſe of his Divorce did day and night breath out againſt him threats and revenge, no man ever preferred Bill againſt him, which conſidering the vſuall ſevere courſes held by our Parliaments, muſt needs acquit him of Abuſe of Power. As for the cauſes of the King's anger, wee will derive them rather from his owne diſcontents, then WOLSEY'S faultineſſe.
                     The King by this time knew the treachery of the diſſembling Pope. Hee had neere five yeares wandered in the Labyrinth of the Court of Rome, and could find no clue to lead him out. He therefore determined to make a way where he could not find one, and like ALEXANDER by force to vndoe that Gordian knot, which by wit and labour hee could not. To

WOLSEY therefore hee communicated his intent of marrying another whether the Pope were willing or no, wiſhing him withall to finde out ſome courſe or other, whereby CAMPEGIVS his Colleague (notwithſtanding the late Mandates to the contrary) might be drawne to give ſentence on his ſide. Many things might be pretended to excuſe the deed, but chiefly the feare of the King's high diſpleaſure, which peradventure hee ſhould feele too, vnleſſe hee aſſented to the King's iuſt requeſt. WOLSEY his anſwer to this I cannot relate. But this is certaine, that WOLSEY, whether for that he did not approve of the King's intended courſe ſeeming (as the times were then) full of raſhneſſe and inſolence, or that he would not vndertake the attempting of his Colleague, or that (as SLEIDAN writes) the King had notice, that the Cardinall had adviſed the Pope not to approve of the Divorce from CATHARINE, foraſmuch as the King was then reſolved to marry another infected with Lutheraniſme: WOLSEY I ſay was ſo ſharply taken vp and threatned by the King, that even then you might reade in his face and geſtures the ſymptomes of his waining fortune. For the Cardinall at that time returning from the Court by water, the Biſhop of Carlile being with him in the ſame Barge, complained of the heate which was then extraordinary: to whom WOLSEY replied, My Lord, if you had beene but now in my place, you would have found it hot indeed. And as ſoone as hee came home, he put off his clothes, and went ſicke to bed. Before hee had repoſed himſelfe an houre and halfe, the Viſcount Rochfort came to him, and in the King's Name willed, that hee and his Colleague ſhould inſtantly repaire to the Queene, and exhort her not to contend any longer with the King, for that it would be more for her good and the honour of them both

 to ſubmit herſelfe to the King's pleaſure, then to vndergo the diſgrace of a publique iudgement. For it was now brought to that puſh, that longer deferredThe Legates repaire to the Queene. it could not be. The Cardinall advertiſed of the King's pleaſure did ariſe, and with his Colleague went to the Queene, who having notice of their comming, went forth and met them. After mutuall ſalutations the Cardinals deſired ſhee would vouchſafe a few words in private, but the Queene refuſed to entertaine any conference with them but where ſhe might have witneſſes of what paſſed. WOLSEY then began to ſpeake in Latine, but the Queene interrupted him, willing, that although ſhe vnderſtood Latin, yet hee ſhould ſpeake in Engliſh. So in the names of bothTheir conference with her. Legates he began a ſpeech in Engliſh, wherein hee profeſſed a great deale of obſervance and dutie to her, and that they came to no other end, but to adviſe her for her
                        Her anſwer. 
                        good. The Queene anſwered them much after this manner:
                     As for your good will, I thanke you: as for your adviſe, I will give you the hearing. But the matter (I beleeve) about which you come, is of ſo great importance, that it will require a great deale of deliberation, and the helpe of a braine ſurpaſsing that of feminine weakneſſe. You ſee my employments (ſhewing them a skaine of white thred hanging about her necke) in theſe I ſpend my time among my Maides, which indeed are none of the greateſt Counſailers: yet I have none other in England, and Spaine (where they are on whom I dare relie) God wot is farre enough hence: yet I am

content to heare what you have to ſay, and will give you an anſwere when we can conveniently.
                     So taking the Cardinall by the hand, ſhe brought them into a withdrawing roome, where having attentively heard out their meſſage, ſhee made this reply:
                     That now after twenty yeares the lawfulneſſe of my marriage ſhould be questioned, I cannot ſufficiently wonder, eſpecially when I conſider who were the Authours of it: Many of them are yet alive both in England and Spaine: and what kind of men the reſt were, who are now dead; the world knowes: Henry and Ferdinand our Parents the most ſage Princes of their time, and their Counſaile ſuch without doubt, who for their wiſdome were approved of as fit ſervants for ſo iudicious Maſters, beſides the Pope, whoſe Diſpenſation J have to ſhew, and which was procured by my Father at no ſmall rate. But what thing is there ſo ſincere and firme, which enuy will not ſeeke to blaſt. Of theſe my miſeries I can accuſe none but you, my Lord of Yorke. Becauſe I could not away with your monstrous pride, exceſsive riot, whoredome, and intolerable oppreſsion, therefore do I now ſuffer. And yet not only for this: for ſome part of your hatred I am beholding to my Nephew the Emperour, whom, for that he did not ſatisfie your inſatiable ambition by advancing

 you to the Papacy, you have ever ſince maligned. You threatned to be revenged on him and his Friends, and you have performed your promiſe; for you have beene the onely incendiarie and plotter of all the miſchiefe and wars against him theſe late yeares. And J am his Aunt, whom how you have perſecuted, by raiſing this new doubt, God only knowes, to whoſe iudgement only I commend my cauſe.
                     This Shee ſpake in French, as it ſeemed very much moved, and would not endure to heare WOLSEY ſpeake in defence of himſelfe, but courteouſly diſmiſſed CAMPEGIVS.
                     It was now Iune, and the Harveſt drawing on, the Legates thought it high time to make an end of this ſuite. A day therefore being prefixed, many of the Nobility, and a multitude of the Commonaltie repaired to the Court, verily expecting, that iudgement ſhould have beene given for the King. HENRY (having I know not how conceived ſome hope of the Legates good intents) cauſed a ſeat to bee placed for himſelfe behind the hangings, vnder the covert wherof he might vnſeene heare whatſoever was ſpoken or paſſed in Court. The Cardinals being ſeated, the King's Advocates earneſtly requiring that ſentence might be given on their ſide, CAMPEGIVS made this Oration well beſeeming the conſtancy of a man not vnworthy of the place he ſupplied.
                     
                        Cardinall Campegius his Oration. J have heard and diligently examined whatſoever hath beene alledged in the King's behalfe. And indeed the arguments are ſuch, that I might and ought pronounce for the King, if

two reaſons did not controll and curbe my deſires of doing his Matestie right: The Queene (you ſee) withdrawes her ſelfe from the iudgement of this Court, having before vs excepted against the partialitie of the place, where (ſhe ſaith) nothing can be determined without the conſent of the Plaintife. Moreover his Holineſſe (who is the fountaine and life of our authorit
                           •
                        e) hath by a meſſenger given vs to vnderſtand, that hee hath reſerved this cauſe for his owne hearing: ſo that if wee would never ſo faine proceed any farther, peradventure wee cannot, J am ſure wee may not. Wherefore (which only remaineth) I doe heere diſſolve the Court: Other then this (as the caſe ſtands) I cannot do: and I beſeech them, whom this Cauſe concernes, to take in good part what I have done. Which if they will not, although it may trouble me, yet not ſo much, as to reguard the threats of any one. I am a feeble old man, and ſee death ſo neere me, that in a matter of ſo great conſequence neither hope, nor feare, nor any other reſpect, but that of the Supreme Iudge, before whom I finde my ſelfe ready to appeare, ſhall ſway me.
                     How the King was pleaſed at this you may eaſily conceive. It is reported, that the Duke of Suffolke knowing the King to be preſent, and conſcious of his infirmitie, in a great rage leaping out of his chaire

 bountifully beſtowed a volley of curſes vpon the Legates, ſaying It was never well with England, ſince it had any thing to doe with Cardinalls. To whom WOLSEY returned a few wordes, ſaying, That it was not in his power to proceed without Authoritie from the Pope, and that no man ought to accuſe them for not doing that, whereto their power did not extend.
                     
                     But the Kings implacable anger admitted of no excuſe: WOLSEY himſelfe muſt become a ſacrifice to appeaſe it. As for CAMPEGIVS, hee taſted nevertheleſſe of the King's bountie, and had leave to depart. But at Calais his carriages were ſearched by the King's command. The pretence was, that WOLSEY intending an eſcape, had by CAMPEGIVS convaied his treaſures for Rome But the Bull was the Treaſure ſo much ſought after. The King could not beleive it was burned; and if it were found, it was enough to countenance his ſecond marriage. But found it was not, no nor ſcarce ſo much money in all the Cardinals carriages, as had beene given him by the King.
                     WOLSEY his riſing and his fall were alike ſodaine; neither of them by degrees, but as the Lion gets his prey, by leapes. Shortly after the departure of his Colleague, vpon the eighteene of October, the
                           Wolſey diſcharged of the great Seale. Dukes of Norfolke and Suffolke in his Maieſties name commanded him to ſurrender the Great Seale. But he pleaded, That the King had by Patent made him Lord Chancellour during terme of life, and by conſequence committed the cuſtodie of the great Seale to him: Nevertheleſſe hee would reſigne his place, if his Maiestie ſo commanded. But hee thought it not fit, having received the Seale from the King, to deliver it to any other, but vpon especiall Command. The Lords returning to Windſore where the Court then was, the next day brought the

King's Letters, whoſe Mandate the Cardinall forthwith obeied. In this Dignitie the ſix and twentiethSi

                           ſon. WOLSEY being removed from the Chancellorſhip is preſently after accuſed of Treaſon, and that (which hath beene ſeldome ſeene) in the Parliament, that ſo without hearing hee might be condemned by Act. But hee perceiving the drift of his Adverſaries, procured one of his attendants THOMAS CROMWELL (hee who afterward became ſo potent) to bee elected a Burgeſſe of the Lower Houſe. The Cardinall being daily informed by him what things were laid to his charge, did by letter inſtruct him what to anſwer. CROMWELL although no Scholler, was very wiſe and eloquent. Which good parts hee ſo faithfully imployed in the defence of his Lord, that the Houſe acquitted him, and himſelfe became famous; opening withall by theſe meanes a way to thoſe Honours, to which the current of a few yeares aduanced him▪ Even they who hated WOLSEY, honoured CROMWELL, whoſe wiſdome, induſtrie, but above all, fidelitie in defending his deiected Lord, was admirable.
                     Now the Cardinall becauſe he would not be found a Traitor, is falne into a Praemunire. Wherevpon he is thruſt as it were naked forth his owne houſe, his great wealth is ſeiſed on by the King's Officers, and hee faine to borrow furniture for his houſe, and money for his neceſſary expences. Iudges are ſent into the houſe whereto he was confined, to take his anſwer to the obiected crime, which was, that without leave from the King hee had dared ſo many yeares to exerciſe his power Legatine. To which calumny (for

 can any man beleive it to be other?) Hee made this anſwer.
                     
                        
                           Wolſeyes ſpeech to the Iudges. J am now ſixty yeares old, and have ſpent my dayes in his Maieſties ſervice, neither ſhunning paines, nor indeavouring any thing more, then (next my Creatour) to pleaſe Him. And is this that hainous offence, for which J am at this age deprived of my eſtate, and forced as it were to beg my bread from doore to doore? Jexpected ſome accuſation of a higher ſtraine, as treaſon, or the like; not for that J know my ſelfe conſcious of any ſuch matter, but that his Maieſties wiſdome is ſuch, as to know, it little beſeemes the conſtancy &amp; magnanimity of a King for a ſlight fault to condemne, and that without hearing, an ancient ſervant, for ſo many yeares next his Perſon, greateſt in his favour, and to inflict a puniſhment on him more horrid then death. What man is he, who is ſo baſe minded, that hee had not rather a thouſand times periſh, then ſee a thouſand men (ſo many my Family numbreth) of whoſe faithfull ſervice hee hath bad long triall, for the moſt part to periſh before his eyes? But finding nothing elſe obiected, J conceive great hope, that J ſhall as eaſily breake this machination of combined envy, as was that late one againſt me in the Parliament concerning Treaſon. It is well knowne to his Maieſty

(of whoſe iuſtice J am confident) that I would not preſume to execute my power Legatine, before he had beene pleaſed to ratifie it by his Royall Aſſent given vnder his Seale; which notwithſtanding I cannot now produce, that and all my goods (as you well know) being taken from me. Neither indeed if I could, would J produce it. For to what end ſhould I contend with the King? Go therefore, and tell his Maieſty, that I acknowledge all that J have (but alaſſe what ſpeake J of what I have, Who indeed have nothing left me?) or whatſoever I had, to be derived from his Royall Bounty, and do thinke it good reaſon, that he ſhould revoke his gifts, if he thinke me vnworthy of them. Why then do I not remit my cauſe to his Maieſties arbitrement, at his pleaſure to be either condemned or abſolved? To him then if you will have me acknowledge my fault, behold, I will make ſhort worke for you, I confeſſe it. The King knowes my innocencie, ſo that neither my owne confeſsion, nor the calumnies of my adverſaries can deceiue him. I am therefore content to confeſſe my ſelfe guilty. His Maieſty from the fountaine of his naturall Clemency doth often derive the ſtremes of his mercy to the delinquent: And I know, though I ſhould not deſire it, Hee will reguard my innocence.
                     
                        
 Vpon his confeſſion the penalty of the Law was forthwith inflicted, only he was not, as the Law requires, committed to perpetuall impriſonment. The furniture of his houſe of infinite value, incredible ſtore of plate &amp; great treaſure had bin already ſeiſed to the King's vſe. There remained nothing but the Lands wherewith he intended to indow his Colledge, the greateſt part whereof were his owne purchaſe, the reſt were the demeſnes of the demoliſhed Monaſteries. Theſe Lands amounted to above foure thouſand pounds per annum, and were all confiſcated, But God would not ſuffer ſo brave a work to periſh. The King afterward beſtowed on the Colledge in Oxford calledChriſt Church in Oxford.
                         
                        Chriſt Church, revenues for the maintenance of a Deane, eight Prebendaries, a hundred Students, twelue Chaplaines and Singing men, and foure and twenty Almes men, for which this Colledge acknowledgeth HENRY the Eighth for its Founder. But the King arrogated to himſelfe what was truly to be aſcribed to the Gardinall. Who was now in the caſe of the poore Mouſe, whom the Cat intends to devoure. The King had marked him out for deſtruction, yet permitted him to live, but ſo, as that he could never eſcape, and yet never deſpaire of eſcaping Scarce any day throughout thoſe few moneths paſſed, wherein hee indured not ſomething or other, that would have animated a ſenſeleſſe thing with anger▪ neither was the Cardinall compoſed of patience, yet did he never deſpaire. His ſorrowes were alwayes tempred with ſome mixture of ioy. For he was often viſited from the King, but that very ſecretly, and commonly by night: often certified of the King's affection towards him, in token whereof the Viſitants did ſometimes from the King preſent him with a Iewell or ſome ſuch thing, willing him to be of good comfort, for that ſhortly, they would aſſure him, he ſhould be raiſed to his former

                            the end of three dayes more. The King ſtriking the table with his hand cried out, I had rather looſe twenty thouſand pounds then he ſhould die: Make haſt therefore you, and as many other Phyſicians as are about the Court, and by all meanes indeavour his recovery. The Phyſician then certifying him, that he was ſicke, more in minde, then body: the King diſpatched away a Gentleman with a Ring, which WOLSEY had formerly given to him▪ willing him withall to tell the Cardinall▪ that the King's anger was now paſt, who was ſorry that he had ſo long given eare to detraction: and that he ſhould ſhortly finde, that the King's affection towards him was no leſſe, then when hee flouriſhed moſt in the ſunſhine of his favour. The ſame comfortable words being againe and againe ingeminated by divers others ſent for that purpoſe, the Cardinall in a few dayes recovered his former health.
                     At Court each one aſpired to riſe by WOLSEY his fall. But now iealous leaſt the King intended a reall and ſincere reconciliation, and fearing revenge from him whom they had iniured, worke all their wits to ſupplant him. At, or about London he was too neere the Court, ſome tricke muſt be had to ſend him farther▪

Of all his Livings they leave him only the Archbiſhopricke of Yorke wherewith to maintaine him, the revenues whereof might be valued at foure thouſand pounds per annum. The ſpeech of SENECA concerning APICIVS why may I not apply to the preſent eſtate of WOLSEY? How great was his Luxurie, who deemed the income of foure thouſand pound povertie?
                     
                     And now it were requiſite that we ſhould proceed to the yeare 1530. But let vs firſt behold the end of this great Cardinall. That Summer hee ſpent at Cawood a Mannor houſe belonging to the Sea of Yorke, where by his mildneſſe, iuſtice, and liberality, hee did ſo win the hearts of his Dioceſans, that hee was both admired and loved. He ſeemed to be much delighted with this ſolitary confinement, for that having hitherto beene toſſed in the Court to and fro as in a tempeſt, hee had now eſcaped, not from ſhipwracke to a rocke, but to his deſired haven of repoſe. Yet notwithſtanding vpon any the leaſt hope of recovering his former power (although hee profeſſed that converted by an Anchorite of Richmond he had bid adieu to the vanities of the world) hee could not conceale the greatneſſe of his ioy. That he failed of his hopes (which indeed were none of the leaſt) I cannot aſſent to them, who impute it to the importunity of his potent adverſaries. For to what end ſerved ſo many meſſages full of gracious &amp; reconciliatorie promiſes, but ever intermixed with inſufferable diſgraces the forerunners of a dire Cataſtrophe? Certainly to no other, then that he might bee wrought one way or other to approue of, and give ſentence for the King's Divorce (at leaſt) as Archbiſhop CRANMER after did.
                     But this courſe not prevailing, they intend a ſecond

accuſation of Treaſon. To this purpoſe the Earle of Northumber land is ſent to apprehend, and (as he was amazed at this ſudaine change) bring him to his anſwerThe

Being neere his end, it is reported Sir WILLIAM KINGSTON (who lately came thither with ſome of the King's Guard) exhorted him to be of good comfort, for that the King (in whoſe name he ſaluted him) had ſent for him to no other end, but that hee might cleere himſelfe from thoſe things, which malice and detraction had forged againſt him: neither did hee doubt, but that ſhortly hee ſhould ſee him more potent then ever, if out of puſillanimity he gave not too much ſcope to the violence of his diſcontented paſſions.

I would I might be a generall example (even to the King himſelfe) how ſliperily they ſtand in this world, who do not above all things rely vpon the firme ſupport of Gods Favour and Providence. Salute his Maiestie from me, and deliver this my laſt petition vnto him, which is, That he live mindfull of the triall he must vndergo before Gods high Tribunall: ſo ſhall hee by the ſecret teſtimony of his owne conſcience free mee from thoſe crimes wherewith my adverſaries ſeeke to burthen me.
                     More he would have ſpoken but his ſpeech failedHe dieth. him, and death preſently enſued. His body apparrelledAnd is buried. in his Pontificall Robes, after it had all that day (for he expired at the very breake of day) beene expoſed to open view, was at midnight without any ſolemnity buried in our Ladies Chappell in the Church of the Monaſtery. Thus vnhappily ended Cardinall WOLSEY,His greatneſſe. his long happy life; then whom England, no nor I beleeve all Europe, if you except the Biſhops of Rome, ever ſaw a more potent Prelate. His retinue conſiſted of neere about a thouſand perſons, among which were one Earle, commonly nine Barons, many

Knights and Gentlmen, and of Officers belonging to his houſe above foure hundred, beſides their ſervants, which far exceeded the former number▪ His Chappell was ſerved by a Deane, a Subdeane, a Chanter, thirty fiue Singers, whereof thirteene were Clergy, twelve Lay, and ten Choriſters, foure Sextons, beſide ſixteene Chaplaines (the moſt ſufficient for their learning thoroughout all England) two Croſſe-bearers, &amp; as many Piller-bearers. But nothing doth manifeſt his wealth and greatneſſe ſo much as do his ſtately and incomparable buildings. Wee have already ſpoken of hisHis buildings. Colledges Whitehall (then called Yorke houſe, as belonging to the Archbiſhop) the place where our Kings do moſt reſide, was almoſt wholy built by him. Hampton Court, the neareſt pile of all the King's houſes, he raiſed entirely from the ground▪ and having furniſhed it with moſt rich houſholdſtuffe, gave it to the King. It was a guift fitter for a King to take, then for a ſubiect to give. But in the opinion of the vulgar the monument which hee intended for the King far ſurpaſſed all theſe. It was of ſolid braſſe, but vnfiniſhed, and is to be ſeene in HENRY the Eight his Chappell in the Church of Windſore. That three of his Children raigning after him, none of them vndertooke by perfecting it to cover the (as it were) vnburied bones of their Father, what may wee thinke, but that the exceſſive charge of it deterred them? But vpon a further ininquiry we may more iuſtly aſcribe it to the eſpeciall iudgement of the Divine Providence, who had decreed, that he who had ſo horribly ſpoiled the Church, ſhould alone be debarred the honor afforded to each of his Predeceſſours in the Church. And thus much concerning WOLSEY, who died the thirtieth of November 1530.
                     
                        The peace of Cambray.
                         In the meane time in Iune, Anno 1529. after long debating the matter to and fro, by the mediation of

                        Louyſe the French Kings Mother, and MARGARET Aunt to the Emperour, theſe two Princes are drawne to an accord, &amp; a Peace is concluded betweene them at Cambray, thence commonly called The Peace of Cambray, but by vs The Peace of Women. The chiefe Conditions whereof, and that any way concerned vs were,
                     That the French King ſhould giue to the Emperour for the freedome of his Children (who had beene three yeares Hoſtages in Spaine for their Father) two Millions of Crownes, whereof he ſhould pay foure hundred thouſand (due from the Emperor by the League made, Anno 1522.) to Henry and his Sister Mary Dowager of France. Beſide which huge ſumme he ſhould alſo acquit the Emperor of fiue hundred thouſand, which he did owe to our King for the indemnity of the marriage betweene the Emperour and the Lady Mary the Kings Daughter, whom (having beene long ſince contracted) hee left, to marry with the Daughter of Portugall: And that hee ſhould vngage and reſtore to the Emperour the Flower de Lys of gold enriched with precious ſtones, &amp; a piece of our Saviours Croſſe, which Philip, truly called, The Good Duke of Burgoigne the Emperours Father being driven into England by contrary windes, had ingaged to Henry the Seventh for fifty thouſand Crownes.
                     So that the ſumme to be paid to HENRY amounted

to nine hundred and fifty thouſand Crownes, beſides ſixteene hundred thouſand more to be payed to the Emperour at the very inſtant of the delivery of the French King's Children. The totall ſumme was two millions fiue hundred fifty thouſand Crownes, which of our money make ſeven hundred ſixty five thouſand pounds.
                     FRANCIS not knowing which way ſudainly to raiſe ſo huge a maſle, by his Embaſſadours intreated our King to be pleaſed to ſtay ſome time for his moneyes. But HENRY was much moved, that he had not beene made acquainted with this Treaty: notwithſtanding his ſecret deſignes made him temper his choler, nay, and with incredible liberality to grant more then was demanded. For hee abſolutely forgave him the five hundred thouſand Crownes due for the not marrying his Daughter, hee gave the Flower de Lys to his Godſonne HENRY Duke of Orleans, and left the other foure hundred thouſand to be payed by equall portions in five yeares. The Pope had lately by his Legates deluded HENRY, who was therevpon much diſcontented not knowing what courſe to run. And this is thought to be the cauſe of his ſo extraordinary liberality toward the French.
                     
                     
                        The firſt occaſion of Cranmers riſing. The King being then in progreſſe and hunting at Waltham it happened that STEPHEN GARDINER Principall Secretary of Eſtate (after Biſhop of Winton) and FOX the King's Almoner (after Biſhop of Hereford) were billeted in the houſe of a gentleman named CRESSEY, who had ſent his two ſons to be brought vp at Cambridge, vnder the tutelage of THOMAS CRANMER Doctour in Divinity, a man both very learned and vertuous. The plague then ſpreading it ſelfe in Cambridge, CRANMER with his two Pupils betooke himſelfe to Maſter CRESSEY their father his houſe. Where GARDINER and FOX among other

 table talke diſcourſing of the Kings Suite concerning his Divorce, which had ſo many yeares depended in the Court of Rome vndecided, CRANMER ſaid, that he wondred the King required not the opinions of the moſt famous learned men that were any where to be found (of whom the world had many far more learned then the Pope) and followed not their iudgements. What CRANMER had as it were let fall by chance they report to the King, who ſudainly apprehending it, ſaid that this fellow whoſoever he was, had hit the naile on the head, and withall demanding his name, cauſed CRANMER to be ſent for, whom he commended for his (but too late) adviſe, which courſe if he had taken but five yeares before, hee ſhould now have had an hundred thouſand pounds in his purſe, which he had vnprofitably in this ſuite caſt away on the Court of Rome: he commands CRANMER to write a Tract concerning this queſtion wherein having drawne together what reaſons hee could for the confirmation of his advice, hee ſhould conclude with his owne opinion. CRANMER did it very readily, and is therevpon with Sir THOMAS BOLEN (lately created Earle of Wiltſhire) CARNE, STOKESLEY, and BE NET, Doctours of Law, with others ſent on an Embaſſie to Rome. CRANMER'S booke is to be preſented to his Holineſſe, and they are commanded to challenge the Court of Rome to a diſputation wherin the Contents of that book ſhould be maintained; the argument whereof was, That by the authority of holy Scripture, ancient Fathers, and Councels, it was vtterly vnlawfull for any man to marry his Brothers Widow, and that no ſuch marriage could bee licenced or authorized, by the Popes Diſpenſation. This being done, the King's intent was, they ſhould procure the opinions of all the Vniverſities throughout Europe, by whom if he found his former marriage condemned,

then without farther expecting the approbation of the Sea of Rome, he was reſolved to run the hazard of a ſecond. To this the amity of the French ſeeming very conducible, the King had by his former liberality ſought to oblige him. The Embaſſadours came to Rome▪
                         had audience, were promiſed a publique diſputation, whereof they were held ſo long in expectation, that perceiving their ſtay there to bee to little purpoſe, they all returned into England, except CRANMER, who with the ſame inſtructions that hee had formerly beene ſent to the Pope, was to go to the Emperour, whoſe Court was then in Germany. There this good &amp; learned man, hitherto no friend to LVTHER, while he defends his owne booke and the King's Divorce againſt the moſt learned either of Proteſtants or Papiſts, is thought to have beene ſeaſoned with the leaven of that doctrine, for which after he had beene twenty yeares Archbiſhop of Canterbury, he was moſt cruelly burned.
                     While CRANMER thus laboured abroad, the King at home deales with LANGEY the French Embaſſadour, by whoſe meanes (with the forcible Rhetoricke (ſaith one) of ſome Engliſh Angels) hee obtained of the Vniverſities of Paris with the reſt throughout France, Pavia, Padua, Bononia, and others, this Concluſion, That the Pope (who hath no power over the Poſitive Law of God) could not by his Diſpenſation ratifie a marriage contracted betweene a Brother and a brothers Widow, it being forbidden by the expreſſe words of Scripture.
                     
                     The eight of December the King graced three noble and worthy men with new titles of honour. THOMASCreation of Earles. BOLEN Viſcount Rochfort the King's future Father in law, was created Earle of Wiltſhire, ROBERT RATCLIF Viſcount Fitz-Walter, of the noble Family of the FITZ-WALTERS, Earle of Suſſex; in which honour his ſonne THOMAS, his nephevves

                     WILLIAM TINDALL having tranſlatedThe Bible tranſlated into Engliſh. the New Teſtament into Engliſh, and procured it to be printed at Antwerp had ſecretly diſperſed many copies thereof throughout England. Whereat the Biſhops and Clergy (eſpecially thoſe that were moſt addicted to the Doctrine of Rome) ſtormed excedingly, ſaying that this Tranſlation was full of errours, and that in the prefaces and elſe where it contained many things contrary to the Truth. The King being angry with the Pope, had long ſince determined to free himſelfe from his vſurped power. And therefore admoniſhed the murmuring Clergy to correct this booke, not to ſuppreſſe it: for it was a moſt profitable worke, and very neceſſary for the diſcovery of the deceits of the Court of Rome, the tyranny whereof was become intolerable to all the Princes of Chriſtendome. Whereupon he giveth order to the Biſhops and ſome other learned men to ſet forth a new Tranſlation, which his ſubiects might reade with ſafety and profit.
                     
                        An Embaſſie to the Pope. The hope of prevailing with the Pope by the French King's meanes had drawne HENRY to ſend on a ſecond Embaſſage to the Pope, the Earle of Wiltſhire, Doctour STOKESLEY Elect of London, and

EDWARD LEE WOLSEY his Succeſſor in Yorke. They found the Pope at Bononia with the Emperour, but had no other anſwer to their demands then, that his Holineſſe when he came to Rome, would indevour to do the King iuſtice. Till then he could do nothing.
                     
                        All commerce with the Sea of Rome forbidd
                              •

                           •
                        y publique Proclamation throughout the Kingdome he forbids all commerce betweene his ſubiects and the Biſhop of Rome: commanding that no man ſhould receive any thing from, or ſend any thing (eſpecially money) vnto him, either by exchange, or any other meanes, calling him Tyrant, the Harpy of the World, the common Incendiary, and deeming him vtterly vnworthy of that glorious title which he had vaingloriouſly vſurped, Chriſts Ʋicar. This in September.
                     
                     But the wealth of the Clergy being very great, and conſidering how they had in the Raignes of his Predeceſſors ſtrongly ſided with the Pope, the King was ſome what iealous of them. To curbe them hee condemnes the whole Clergy throughout the Kingdome in a Praemunire, for that without licence from his Maieſty they had beene obedient to the authority of theThe Clergy fined. Pope in acknowledging WOLSEY for his Legate. The Clergy of the Province of Canterbury, being aſſembled in Convocation, buy their pardon at a hundred thouſand pounds, and in this Synode he is (with much ado) by the Clergy of both Provinces declared next vnder Chriſt Supreme Head of the Church of England,
                        The King declared Supreme Head of the Church. and all foraine power or authority whatſoever diſclaimed. The Province of Yorke is moreover fined at eighteene thouſand eight hundred &amp; forty pounds. So this one fault (if it may be ſo accompted it being certaine that WOLSEY was licenced to exerciſe his authority Legantine) coſt the Clergy a hundred and eighteene thouſand, eight hundred and forty pounds.

                     THe only publique memorable occurrents of this yeare were, that the Laity, for the moſt part as deepe in a Praemunire, as the Clergy, were by Act of Parliament pardoned. In which aſſembly Sir THOMAS MORE Lord Chancellour, and other remarkable ſpeakers related at large the Concluſions of the Vniverſities concerning the vnlawfulneſſe of the Kings marriage.
                     And yet perhaps the notorious villany of RICHARD ROSE Cooke to the Biſhop of Rocheſter, might crave a place in this Hiſtory, who with poyſoned broth killed ſixteene of the Biſhops ſervants. The Biſhop himſelfe (who was eſpecially aimed at) that day contrary to his accuſtomed diet forbearing broth, eſcaped. The poiſoner according to a Law lately enacted, was throwne into a cauldron of boyling water. But the offence deſerved tortures of a moſt exquiſite ſtraine.

                     ON the three and twentieth of August diedThe death of William Warham Archbiſhop of Canterbury. Cranmer (though much againſt his will) ſucceedoth him. WILLIAM WARHAM Archbiſhop of Canterbury, to whom THOMAS CRANMER at that time in Germany about the Kings affaires, was appointed Succeſſor. He was not ſo ambitious as to aſpire to ſuch a dignity; and ſome reaſons made him vnwilling to accept it being offred. He knew before he could be conſecrated he muſt ſweare obedience to the Pope, which with a ſafe conſcience he could not.

He feared what would be the iſſue of this abrupt ſeperation from the Sea of Rome. Hee knew the King's diſpoſition to be violent, ſuch ſudaine changes to be full of danger, and the Court (although hee had not yet purchaſed the acquaintance of it) to be a meere ſchoole of fraud and diſſembling. The Kings pleaſure muſt neceſſarily be obeyed, and if he ſlipped neuer ſo little, enuy the miſchievous attendant of great felicity would helpe him forward to a breake-necke. CRANMER alſo having long ſince loſt his Wife whom he had married in his youth, had taken a liking to a certaine maide neipce to OSIANDERS wife, whom he intended to make his ſecond wife: yet hee knew that the Canon Law permitted not Prieſts to marry, and made them vncapable of holy Orders, who had beene twice married. Theſe conſiderations made him linger in Germany ſix whole moneths after the diſpatch of his buſineſle, hoping that his abſence might afford meanes to ſome other to worke a way to the Archbi

CRANMER having privately married his wife at Norimberg, at length returned into England, where the Kings importunity prevailing beyond all ſcrupulous difficulties, CRANMER is (though much againſt his will made Archbiſhop of Canterbury, the Pope alſo by his Bull confirming the Election. He refuſing the Arbiſhopricke, becauſe hee muſt

 take an oath to the Pope, delivered the Bull to the King, proteſting that hee would never accept of any Biſhopricke in England, but from the King, who was Supreme Head of the Church of England; and that he would not take any oath that ſhould any way derogate from the King's Authoritie▪ At length the ſubtle heads of the Lawiers found out a quirke wherby to ſalue all: He muſt firſt by a praevious Proteſtation except againſt this Oath (which was to be taken pro formd) that it ſhould not hereafter be any way preiudiciall to him. Thus aſcended CRANMER to the Archiepiſcopall Sea, where hee ſate neere about twenty yeares, vntill Queene MARY the Daughter of repudiated CATHARINE not only thruſt this moſt innocent, grave, learned man out of his Biſhopricke, but with a barbarous cruelty condemned him to the fire, as hereafter in its place we ſhall declare.
                     For the Treatiſe of a more ſtrict League betweene the two Kings of England and France, an interview is appointed betweene them. To this end on the eleventhAn enterview betweene the Kings of England and France.
                         of October the King with a mightie traine paſſed to Calais. The tenth day after going to Boloigne he was met halfe way by the French King &amp; his Sons, and conducted to Boloigne, where the two Kings divided the Abbey betweene them. HENRY ſtaied there foure dayes, and then brought FRANCIS (in whoſe company were the King of Navarre, ſome Dukes, and Cardinals, a great number of Noblemen, and of others at leaſt twelve hundred) to Calais. At Saint Ioquebert the Duke of Richmond (who was not at Boloigne with the King his Father) received them. After much ſolemne entertainment, and the enterchangeable favours from each King to the Princes of each others company, from HENRY to the King of Navarre (or as the French write, to MONT MORENCY) and CHABOT the Admirall by the Order of

the Garter; From FRANCIS to the Dukes of Norfolke and Suffolke by that of Saint MICHAEL, theſe great Monarchs parted.
                     Ielouſie of the Emperours ſtill increaſing power had now vnited theſe Princes, and their naturall diſpoſitions wonderfull agreeable had made them alwayes prone to a mutuall love, which by this interview tooke ſuch deepe root, that even in their owne opinions they reſted aſſured of each other. And indeed had they beene private perſons, their friendſhip in all likelihood had continued inviolable. But Princes are not ſo much to be ſwayed by their owne Affections, as the conſideration of the publique Vtilitie. The effect of this interview was an agreement to repreſſe the Turke about that time waſting Hungary, to which end they ſhould aſſemble together by their ioint forces an Army of foureſcore thouſand men, whereof there ſhould be ten thouſand horſe with artillery requiſite for the ſaid Campe: A ſpecious pretext: For they both knew, that the Turke had already retreated. But in private they treated of other matters. They had both many cauſes of diſcontent. FRANCIS not without cauſe was diſpleaſed with the Pope, and HENRY thinking it beſt to ſtrike while the iron was hot, indevoured an vtter alienation betweene them. HENRY complaines firſt of the wrong the Court of Rome did him touching the matter of his Divorce, in the ſuite whereof full ſix yeares were now ſpent: and yet at length after all their deceits &amp; mockeries, they ſeeke to force him, either to goe in perſen to Rome, or in a matter of ſo great importance to ſend Deputies, who ſhould in the Kings behalfe follow the ſuite. An inſolent proceeding, and iniury without example, which did concerne the French and all other Princes of Chriſtendome. For in like caſes hapning among Soveraigne Princes, eſpecially touching

 the conſcience ſo neere it, was the vſuall cuſtome of other Popes to ſend Iudges to the place, it being reaſonable that the Perſons ſhould ſpeake perſonally, and not by their Attorneyes and very vnr

                        aſonable, that a Soveraigne Prince leaving the rule and governement of his Eſtates ſhould go and plead his cauſe at Rome. Moreover hee did complaine of the intolerable exactions of the Church of Rome over the Clergy and people of England; where by the yoke, before too heavy, was now become inſupportable: neither did he doubt, but the ſame courſes were taken in France. Germany had begun the way of freedome to the reſt of Chriſtendome: why ſhould not other Princes follow their example? To conclude hee did inſtantly require, that they two ſhould ſend their Embaſſadours iointly together to the Pope to ſummon him to appeare at the next generall Councell, there to anſwere his extortions, and by the authority and iudgement of the Councell to force him to a reinformation: affirming, that there was no Nation in Chriſtendome, which did not deſire,

                           •

                        able reguard of his owne Country, he profeſſed himſelfe ready to vndergo all difficulties. Hee wanted not ſufficient iniuries whereof to complaine, conſidering that he having ſo well deſerved of the Apoſtolique Sea▪ but more especially of this Pope, yet he certainly found, that CLEMENI, all this notwithſtanding, was not well affected towards him. CLEMENT had very lately ſuffered his reputation to be violated in his preſence, and by the Biſhop of 
                           Ʋerulo had ſecretly endevoured to alienate the Suiſſes his allies from him. France
                        
groaned vnder the burthen of the new and vndutifull exactions of the Popes Officers, by meanes whereof all the treaſure was carried out of the Kingdome, to the preiudice of his ſubiects (the Clergy eſpecially) who grew poore, the Churches were vnrepaired, and the poore neither clothed nor fed: and if he himſelfe levied any great ſumme of money, the tributes are longer comming in then vſually they were wont. But he thought it beſt, before they proceeded to that harſh courſe, to vſe ſome milder meanes, whereto there was a faire occaſion offred, the Pope having by the Cardinall of Grandmont made him a promiſe of an interview at Nice or Avtgnon: where if hee could not obtaine reaſon of him in the behalfe of both, hee would indevour to prevaile by force where he could not by iuſt intreaties: In the meane time he deſired him to attend the iſſue of their parley.
                     But FRANCIS concealed the true cauſe of this intended interview for feare leaſt our HENRY not approving it, ſhould ſeeke to diſſuade him from it. The French was implacable towards the Emperour, againſt whom to ſtrengthen himſelfe, hee meanes to win the Pope by the marriage of his younger Sonne HENRY Duke of Orleans (who after raigned) with CATHARINE de MEDICES Ducheſſe of Vrbin

                         the Popes Niece. The Pope could not at firſt believe this potent Prince intended him ſo much honour: but perceiving the French to be reall, he moſt eagerly farthered it, appointing time and place for the conſummation of it, which was after done at Marſeilles by CLEMENT himſelfe in the preſence of the French King.

                     Shortly after by Act of Parliament the marriage of the King and the Lady CATHARINE was declared void and inceſtuous, and a Law enacted, wherein all Appeales to Rome were forbidden, and that none ſhould ſtile CATHARINE other then Princeſſe of Wales, and Widow or Dowager of Prince ARTHVR. By vertue and authority of the ſame Law, the Archbiſhop of Canterbury accompanied with ſome other Biſhops, comming to Dunſtable ſix miles from Ampthill, where CATHARINE then reſided, cauſed her to be cited before Him next vnder the King chiefe Iudge in all Eccleſiaſticall cauſes within the Province of Canterbury, to ſhew what reaſons could be alleaged why the marriage not lawfully contracted betweene the King and her ſhould not be diſanulled, and pronounced impious, inceſtuous, and conſequently void. To theſe things by one of her ſervants ſhe anſwered; that it beſeemed not the Archbiſhop to thruſt his ſickle into anothers harveſt: this Cauſe did yet depend vndecided before the Pope CHRIST'S Vicar on earth, whoſe Decree ſhe would obey, and other Iudge would ſhee acknowledge none. Being called fifteene dayes together and not appearing. Shee is pronounced Contumax, and for her contumacie ſeparated from the Kings bed and company. Wherevpon the Lady ANNE proclaimed Queene throughout the Kingdome, on Eaſter eve ſhewed her ſelfe publiquely as Queene: and

was at Whitſ ontide crowned with as great pompe and ſolemnitie as ever was Queene. The particulars I will let paſſe, excepting that propheticall Diſticke vpon one of the triumphant Arches purpoſely erected in London where ſhee was to paſſe:

Wafers alſo with the ſame impreſſion were throwne about ſaith STOW. But I rather beleeve, that this Diſticke was made after the Queenes deliverie. Whenſoever it were, hee that truely conſiders the fe

                        icitie of the foure and fortie yeares raigne of this Queenes Daughter, will thinke this Oracle could not proceed from any but a Delphian APOLLO. For the Queene at the time of her Coronation was great with childe, (whereof the ſeventh of September ſhee was delivered at Greenwich) which was that ever famous Queene ELIZABETH, whoThe birth of Queene Elizabeth.
                         after the death of her Brother and Siſter ſo gloriouſly ruled this Kingdome.
                     The Pope was certified of all theſe paſſages; that his authoritie in England was abrogated, that the late Queene CATHARINE was put away, that ANNE BOLEN as Queene was taken to the Kings bed, that the King ſtiled himſelfe Supreme Head of the Church of England, that the Archbiſhop of Canterbury executed all thoſe offices which formerly the Pope only did, and that not as the Popes Legate, but as Primate of England, who vnder the King claimed chiefe authority in Eccleſiaſticall

 affaires throughout his whole Province. Wherwith being ne

                        ed, hee ſeemed to breath nothing but threats and revenge. But knowing himſelfe to have beene the motive of it, and doubtfull of the event, he was eaſily perſuaded by the French King, as yet not to proceed by excommunication againſt HENRY, vntill he had made triall of ſome milder courſe. Wherevpon FRANCIS by BELLAY Biſhop of Paris entreates HENRY not to withdraw himſelfe wholy from the obedience of Rome, for as much as it was a matter of great danger: Hee would therefore adviſe him once more by Embaſſadours to Rome, to ſignifie that he was not vtterly averſe from a r
                           •
                        conciliation: which if hee did, hee made no doubt but all things would ſucceed to his minde. HENRY was certaine of enioying his Love, and let the Pope decree what he liſt, was reſolved to keepe her. Hee had beene formerly abuſed by the Court of Rome, and was loath to make farther triall of their dilatory proceedings. Yet had BELLAY prevailed ſo fa
                           •
                        re with him, that Hee would be content once more to ſubmit himſelfe to the Church of Rome, if hee could bee aſſured of the Popes intention to do him equity. The Biſhop conceiving ſome hopes of a peace (although it were in the winter time) goes himſelfe to Rome, gives the Pope an account of his actions, and certifies him that the matter was not yet deſperate. Wherevpon a day is appointed by which a Poſt returning from the King was to give notice of an intended Embaſſie. But the Conſiſtory gave ſo ſhort a time to have an anſwere, that the Poſt came ſhort two dayes at his returne. The terme expired, they proceed haſtily to the confirmation of their Cenſures notwithſtanding the Biſhops inſtance to obtaine ſix dayes more, for as much as contrary windes or ſome other chance might hinder the meſſenger;

and ſix dayes would be no great matter, conſidering the King had wauered ſix whole yeares before hee fell: The more moderate thought the Biſhop demanded but reaſon; but the prepoſterous haſte of the greater ſort preuailed. Two dayes were ſcarce paſt after the prefixed time, but the Poſt arriuing with ample authority, and inſtructions from England, did greatly amaze thoſe haſty Cardinalls, who afterwards would faine, but could not finde any meanes to mend what they had ſo raſhly marred. For the matter (to pleaſe the Emperor) was ſo hudled vp, as that which could not ritely bee finiſhed in three Conſiſtories, was done in one. So the King and the whole Realme was interdicted, the Bull whereof (the Meſſengers not daring to come neerer) was brought to Dunkirk.
                     
                     The report hereof comming to the King, hee laies all the blame on the Lady CATHARINE. Whereupon the Duke of Suffolke was ſent to leſſen her Houſhold: They who might be any way ſuſpected to haue been imploied by her in this buſineſſe, are turned away, the reſt are commanded to take their oathes to ſerve her as Princeſſe of Wales, not as Queene of England.

                     ABout this time was diſcouered the grand impoſture of ELIZABETH BARTON, which brought her to a deſerued end. Shee had formerly beene ſicke of a ſtrange diſeaſe, which not only afflicted her inwardly, but as often as her fit tooke her, ſo wonderfully diſtorted her mouth and other parts of her body, that moſt were of opinion, it could not peoceed from any naturall cauſe. But Cuſtome growing to a ſecond Nature, the continuance of the Diſeaſe had taught her to diſtort her body after her recouery, in the fame manner as when ſhe was ſicke. Hoping to make a profit of this her counterfeit Convulſion, ſhe imparted the ſecret to the Curate of the Pariſh: by whoſe deuice after

By theſe jugling trickes, not only among the Vulgar (who termed the holy Maid of Kent) but among the wiſer ſort, ſuch as were Archbiſhop WARHAM, Biſhop FISHER, and others, her ſanctity was held in admiration.

The day came, and ſhee beeing brought to the place, by the like couſenage deceiued a great number of people, whom the expectation of the miracle had drawne thither: and at laſt, as if ſhe had iuſt then ſhaken off her diſeaſe, ſhee appeares whole and ſtraight vnto them all; ſaying, That by eſpeciall command from God ſhee muſt become a Nunne, and that one Doctor BOCKING a Monke of Canterbury there preſent, was ordained to bee her Confeſſor, which office hee willingly vndertooke: vnder pretext whereof this Nunne liuing at Canterbury, BOCKING often reſorted to her, not without ſuſpition of diſhoneſty.
                     The intended Divorce from CATHARINE, and marriage with ANNE BOLEN, had much appalled moſt part of the Clergy: for then a neceſſity was impoſed on the King, of a divorce from the Papall Sea, in which the Church and all Eccleſiaſticall perſons were likely to ſuffer. The apprehenſion whereof wrought ſo with BOCKING, that making others conſcious of the intent, hee perſuaded ELIZABETH BARTON by denuntiation of Gods revealed judgements to deterre the King from his purpoſed change. Shee according as ſhee was inſtructed, proclaimes it abroad, That the King aduenturing to marry another, CATHARINE ſurviving, ſhould, if in the meane time hee died not ſome infamous death, within one moneth after be depriued of his Kingdome. The King heares of it, and cauſeth the Impoſtrix to be apprehended, who vpon examination diſcouered the reſt of the conſpirators, who were all committed to priſon vntill the next Parliament ſhould determine of them.

                        No Canons to be conſtituted without the Kings aſſent. The King to collate Biſhopricks. By the ſame Parliament, the authority of the Convocation to make Canonicall Conſtitutions, vnleſſe the King giue this Rovall aſſent, is abrogated.
                     It is alſo inacted, That the Collocation of all Biſhoprickes, the Seas being vacant, ſhould henceforth be at the Kings diſpoſe, and that no man ſhould be choſen by the Chapter, or conſecrated by the Archbiſhop, but he on whom the King by his Congé D'eſlire or other his Letters had conferred that Dignity.
                     
                        The Archbiſhop of Canterbury hath Papall authority vnder the King. And wheras many complained, that now all commerce with Rome was forbidden, all meanes were taken away of mitigating the rigour of the Eccleſiaſticall Lawes of Diſpenſation; Papall authority is granted to the Archbiſhop of Canterbury, the King reſerving to himſelfe the power of diſpenſing in cauſes of greater moment. And that all Appeales formerly wont to be made from the Archbiſhop to the Pope, ſhould now bee from the Archbiſhop to the King, who by Delegates ſhould determine all ſuch ſuites and controverſies.
                     Furthermore, the Kings marriage with the Lady CATHARINE is againe pronounced inceſtuous,

 Dignity of a King, and to be depoſed, re-iterating withall the thunder of Excommunication, with which bug-beare his predeceſſor CLEMENT had ſought to affright him. But this peradventure happened in the inſuing yeare, after the death of FISHER and MORE.
                     A Parliament is againe called in November, wherein (according to the Decree of the late Synod) the King was declared Supreme Head of the Church of England, and the puniſhment all crimes which formerly pertained to the Eccleſiaſticall Courts, is made proper to him. So the Kingdome is vindicated from the vſurpation of the Pope, who before ſhared in it, and the King now firſt began to raigne entirely.

EDWARD the Firſt was the firſt who ſubdued this Countrey, yet could hee not prevaile over their mindes, whome the deſire of recouering their loſt liberty, animated to many rebellions. By reaſon whereof, and our ſuſpitions, being for two hundred yeares oppreſſed either with the miſeries of ſeruitude or war, they neuer taſted the ſweet fruits of a true and ſolid peace. But HENRY the Seuenth by bloud (in reguard of his Father) and birth a Welchman, comming to the Crowne, (as if they had recouered their liberty, whereto they ſo long aſpired) they obeied him as their lawfull Prince. So the Engliſh

being freed of their former jealouſies permitted them to partake of their Priuiledges, ſince common to both Nations, the good whereof equally

The Pope and the Emperour were both enemies of HENRY, watchfully attending all opportunities to do him miſchiefe. Neither in regard that ſo many ſided with the Pope, were all things ſafe at home. The King was therefore forced to a courſe ſeemingly raſh, and full of dangerous conſequences, but very neceſſary for the time. Hee reſolves to demoliſh all the MonaſteriesThe King begins to ſubv

To this end, they that were thought more eſpecially in maintaining the Popes authority to withſtand the Kings proceedings, were condemned of high Treaſon and they that refuſed to acknowledge the King vnder CHRIST, Supreme Head of the Church of England,

 are hanged. For this cauſe on the third of May

But the Pope was the occaſion of his death, who to eaſe the burthen of his now a yeares impriſonment, by the addition of a new title, had on the one and twentieth of May created him Cardinall. The newes whereof haſtened him to a ſcaffold.

This was that MORE ſo famous for his Eutopia, and many other Workes both in Engliſh and Latin. As for his converſation, the moſt cenſorious fault him in nothing, but his too too jeſting (I will not ſay ſcoffing) wit, to which he gaue more liberty, then did beſeeme the grauity of his perſon, not tempering himſelfe in the midſt of his calamity, no not at the very inſtant of death. After his condemnation hee denied to giue any thing to the Barber that trimmed him, affirming, That head about which he had bestowed his paines, was the

Going vp the ſcaffold, he deſired him that went before him, to lend him his hand to helpe him vp, as for comming downe he tooke no care. Laying his head vpon the blocke, hee put aſide his beard (which was then very long) ſaying, The Executioner was to cut off his head, not his beard.

It would amaze one to conſider what villanies were diſcouered among them by the meanes of CROMWELL and others.

                        The death of Queene Catharine.
                         THis yeare began with the end of the late Queene CATHARINE, whom extremity of griefe caſt into a diſeaſe, whereof on the eighth of January ſhe deceaſed.
                     
                        Queene Anne, the Ʋiſcont Rochford and others committed. Queene ANNE now enioyed the King without a Rivall, whoſe death not withſtanding not improbably happened too ſoone for her. For the King vpon May day at Greenwich beholding the Viſcont Rochfort the Queenes brother, HENRY NORRIS, and others, running a tilt, ariſing ſuddenly, and to the wonder of all men departing thence to London, cauſed the Viſcont Rochfort, NORRIS, the Queene her ſelfe, and ſome others, to be apprehended and committed. The Queene being guarded to the Tower by the Duke of Norfolke, AVDLEY Lord Keeper, CROMWELL Secretary of Eſtate, and KINGSTON Lieutenant of the Tower, at the very entrance vpon her knees with dire imprecations diſavowed the crime (whatſoeuer it were) wherewith ſhee was charged, beſeeching God ſo to regard her as the iuſtneſſe of her cauſe required.
                     On the fifteenth of May in the hall of the Tower ſhe was arraigned, the Duke of Norfolke ſitting high Steward, to whom were adioined twenty ſix other Peeres (and among them the Queenes Father) by whom ſhe was to be tried. The Accuſers hauing giuen in their evidence, and the Witneſſes produced, ſhe ſitting in a chaire (whether in regard of any infirmity, or out of honour permitted to the Wife of their Soueraigne) hauing an excellent quicke wit, and being a ready ſpeaker, did ſo anſwer to all obiections, that had the Peeres giuen in their verdict according

to the expectation of the aſſembly, ſhee had beene acquitted. But they (among whom the Duke of Suffolke the Kings brother in Law was chiefe, one wholly applying himſelfe to the Kings humor) pronounce Her guilty. Whereupon the Duke of Norfolke bound to proceed according to the verdict of the Peeres, condemned Her to death, either by beingThe Queene condemned, burned in the Greene in the Tower, or beheaded, as his Maieſty in his pleaſure ſhould thinke fit. Her brother GEORGE Viſcont Rochford was likewiſewith her Brother, the ſame day condemned, and ſhortly after, HENRY NORRIS, WILLIAM BRIERTON,
                           and Norris. and FRANCIS WESTON Gentlemen of the Kings Priuy Chamber, and MARKE SVETON a Muſitian, either as Partakers or acceſſory, were to run the ſame fortune. The King greatly favoured NORRIS, and is reported to be much grieved, that he was to dy with the reſt. Whereupon he offered pardon to him, conditionally that he would confeſſe that whereof hee was accuſed. But hee anſwered reſolutely, and as it became the progenitor of ſo many valiant Heroes, That in his conſcience he thought her guiltleſſe of the obiected crime, but whether ſhe were or no, he could not accuſe her of any thing: and that he had rather vndergo a thouſand deaths, then betray the Innocent. Vpon relation whereof the King cryed out, Hang him vp then, Hang him vp then. Which notwithſtanding was not accordingly executed: For on the thirteenth of May, two dayes after his condemnation, all of them, viz. the Viſcont Rochfort, NORRIS, BRIERTON, and SVETON, were beheaded at Tower hill. NORRIS left a ſonne called alſo HENRY, whom Queene ELIZABETH in contemplation of his Fathers deſerts created Baron of Ricot. This Lord NORRIS

 was father to thoſe great Captaines WILLIAM, IOHN, THOMAS, and EDWARD, in our dayes ſo famous throughout Chriſtendome, for their braue exploits in England, France, Irland, and the Netherlands.
                     
                     
                        Her execution. On the nineteenth of May the Queene was brought to the place of execution in the greene within the Tower, ſome of the Nobility and Companies of the City being admitted, rather to be witneſſes, than ſpectators of her death. To whom the Queene hauing aſcended the ſcaffold, ſpake in this manner:
                     Friends and good Chriſtian people, J am here in your preſence to ſuffer death, whereto J acknowledge my ſelfe adiudged by the Lawes; how iustly J will not ſay, for I intend not an accuſation of any one. J beſeech the Almighty to preſerue his Mai

And ſo I bid the world farewell, beſeeching you to commend mee in your Prayers to God. To thee O Lord do J commend my Soule.
                     Then kneeling downe, ſhee inceſſantly repeated theſe words, CHRIST haue mercy on my ſoule, Lord IESVS receive my ſoule; vntill the Executioner of

                           ais at one blow ſmote off her head with a ſword. Had any one three yeares before (at what time the King ſo hot in the purſuit of his loue, preferred the enioying of this Lady beyond his Friends, his Eſtate, his Health, Safeguard, and his onely Daughter) prophetically foretold the vnhappy fate of this Princeſſe, he ſhould haue beene beleeued with CASSANDRA. But much more incredible may all wiſe men thinke the vnheard of crime for which ſhee was condemned: viz. That fearing leaſt her Daughter the Lady ELIZATETH borne while CATHARINE ſurvived, ſhould bee accompted illegitimate, in hope of other (eſpecially maſle) Iſſue, whereof ſhee deſpaired by the King, now neere fifty yeares old, ſhee had laſciviouſly vſed the company of certaine young Courtiers: nay not therewith content, had committed inceſt with her owne Brother. A ſtrange ingratitude in one raiſed from ſo low degree, euen to the height of honour. I will not derogate from the Authority of publique Records: But an Act of Parliament againſt her ſhall not worke on my beliefe. Surely it carried ſo little ſhew of probability with foraine Princes, that they alwaies deemed it an act of inhumane cruelty. Eſpecially the Eſtates of Germany Confederates for the defence of the Reformed Religion; who having often treated with FOX Biſhop of Hereford, and other Embaſſadours, had decreed to make HENRY Head of their League, and had deſigned an Embaſſy by IOHN STVRMIVS, who ſhould haue brought with him into England thoſe excellent Divines PHILIP MELANCTHON and MARTIN BVCER, with one GEORGE DRACO, who ſhould endeavour that and the Reformation of our Church. But having heard of the lamentable

 and vnworthy (as they iudged it) end of the Queene, loathing the King for his inconſtancy and cruelty, they caſt off all farther thought of that matter. I will not preſume to diſcuſſe the truth of their opinion: But freely to ſpeake what I my ſelfe thinke; There are two reaſons which ſway much with mee in the behalfe of the Queene. That her Daughter the Lady ELIZABETH was ſeated in the Royall Throne, where ſhee for ſo many yeares ruled ſo happily and triumphantly. What ſhall we thinke, but that the Divine Goodneſſe was pleaſed to recompence the iuſt calamity of the Mother, in the glorious proſperity of the Daughter? And then conſider but the Kings precipitated Nuptialls the very next day after the death of his former Wife, yet ſcarce interred, and with whoſe warme bloud his imbrued hands yet reaked: conſider this, I ſay, and you ſhall eaſily be perſuaded with mee, that the inſatiable Prince glutted with the ſatiety of one, and out of the deſire of variety ſeeking to enioy another, did more willingly giue eare to the treacherous calumnies of the malicious Popelings, than either befitted an vpright Iudge, or a louing huſband. For it ſeemeth wonderfull ſtrange to mee, that either the fault of the one, or the pleaſing conditions and faire language of the other Wife, ſhould ſo far poſſeſſe the King, as that hee ſhould procureLady Elizabeth diſinherited. his daughter ELIZABETH to be by Act of Parliament declared illegitimate, the matrimony contracted with both the former Queenes CATHARINE and ANNE to be pronounced invalid, and the Crowne to be perpetually eſtabliſhed on the poſterity of the third wife, or if the King had no Iſſue by her, that then it ſhould bee lawfull for him by Will and Teſtament, to transfer it on whome hee

pleaſed. Parliaments were not then ſo rigid, but that they could flatter the Prince, and condeſcend to his demands, though vniuſt, even in caſes which moſt neerely concerned the publique Weale. But ſervile Feare is oft times more ready then Loue, which ſlowly moves by apprehenſion of Good, as the other is quickely forced by the apprehenſion of Danger.

                         On the twentieth of May the King married IANE SEIMOVR Daughter of Sir IOHN SEIMOVR, who on the nine and twentieth of May, being Whitſonday, clad in royall habiliments, was openly ſhewed as Queene. So that the Court of England was now like a Stage, whereon are repreſented the viciſſitudes of ever various Fortune. For within one and the ſame moneth it ſaw Queene ANNE flouriſhing, accuſed, condemned, executed▪ and another aſſumed into her place both of bed and honour. The firſt of May (it ſeemeth) ſhee was informed againſt, the ſecond impriſoned, the fifteenth condemned, the ſeventeenth deprived of her Brother and Friends who ſuffered in her cauſe, and the nineteenth executed. On the twentieth the King married IANE SEIMOVR, who on the nine and twentieth was publiquely ſhewed as Queene.

                        Bourchier Earle of Bathe. In the meane time on the nineteenth of Iuly IOHN BOVRCHIER Lord Fitz-waren, was created Earle of Bathe, whoſe ſucceſſours in that Honour were his Sonne IOHN, who begat IOHN deceaſed before his Father, whoſe Sonne WILLIAM is now Earle of Bathe. At what time alſo THOMAS CROMWELL a

 poore Smiths Sonne, but of a dexterous wit, whoſeCromwells Honor &amp; Dignity. firſt riſing was in the Family of Cardinall WOLSEY, in whoſe ſervice by him faithfully performed, he grew famous, was made Lord CROMWELL, many dignities being alſo conferred on him, to the increaſe of his eſtate and honour. For firſt he was Maſter of the Rolls, and principall Secretary of Eſtate: then Sir THOMAS BOLEN Earle of Wiltſhire reſigning, he was made Lord Privy Seale, and after that dignified with the vnheard of Title, of The Kings Vicar generall in affaires Eccleſiaſticall. For the authority of the Pope being abrogated, many buſineſſes dayly happened, which could not bee diſparched without the Kings conſent; who not able to vndergo the burthen alone, conferred this authority granted him by Act of Parliament on CROMWELL, not for that he thought a Lay man fitter for this dignity than a Clergy man; but becauſe hee had determined vnder colour and pretence thereof, to put in execution ſome deſignes, wherein the Clergy in all probability would haue moved very ſlowly, and againſt the haire. Hee was therefore Preſident in the Synod this yeare. Certainly a deformed ſpectacle, to ſee an vnlearned Lay man Preſident over an aſſembly of ſacred Prelates, and ſuch as for their learning England had in no preceding ages knowne the like. For indeed HENRY is for that much to be commended, who would not eaſily advance any one to place of government in the Church, but whome his learning ſhould make worthy.The beginning of Reformation. By the authority of this Synod a booke was ſet forth, wherein (many points of Doctrine being propoſed to be by the Curates expounded to their Pariſhioners) mention was made of onely theee Sacraments, Baptiſme, the Euchariſt, and Penance: ſome holy dayes alſo were abrogated, and other things pertaining to Religion and Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline

ſomewhat changed, wherewith many were offended, who preferred preſcript Errors before the Truth.
                     The ſame time, the Parliament aſſembled the fourth of Ianuary, permitted all Monaſteries, the revenuesThe ſubuerſion of religious houſes of leſſe note. whereof exceeded not two hundred pounds a yeare, to the Kings diſpoſall; who cauſing them to be ſuppreſſed (to the number of three hundred ſeventy and ſix) entred vpon their lands, amounting to thirty two thouſand pounds a yeare, and ſelling their goods even at very low rates, (moſt men accompting it ſacrilegious, to ſet to ſale the goods of the Church) raiſed aboue an hundred thouſand pounds. Theſe things of themſelves were diſtaſtfull to the vulgar ſort. Each one did as it were claime a ſhare in the goods of the Church: for many who being neither Monkes, nor relied to Religious perſons, did receive no profit of Eccleſiaſtieall goods, did notwithſtanding conceiue, that it might herafter come to paſſe, that either their children, friends, or kinred, might obtaine the places yet ſupplied by others, whereas of theſe goods once confiſcated, they could not hope that any commodity ſhould redound vnto them. But the commiſeration of ſo many people, to the number of at leaſt ten thouſand, who were without any warning giuen, thruſt out of dores, and committed to the mercy of the world, was a more forcible cauſe of generall diſtaſte. Which notwithſtanding of it ſelfe ſufficient; was augmented by the malice of ill diſpoſed and ſeditious perſons, who in their aſſemblies exaggerated theſe proceedings as the beginnings of greater evills; that this was but a triall of their patience, as yet the ſhrubs and vnderwoods were but touched, but without ſpeedy remedy the end would bee with the fall of the lofty oakes. While theſe generall diſcontents thus vented

 themſelves in private, CROMWELL in September ſent forth certaine Injunctions to the Clergy, by vertue whereof each 
                           •
                        urate was to expound to his pariſhioners the Apoſtles Creed, the Lords Prayer, the Aue Maria, and the Ten Commandements, and earneſtly to endeauour that they might learne them in the Engliſh Tongue. This drave theſe Male▪contents into ſuch extremes, that the midwifry of any occaſionCommotion in Lincolneſhire.
                         ſerved to produce the prodigious iſſues of their madneſſe. For in Lincolneſhire the Commons being aſſembled about the beginning of October, concerning Subſidies to be paid to the King; as if the ſpirit of fury had generally animated them, they ſuddenly to the number of twenty thouſand tooke armes, forcing certaine Lords and Gentlemen to be their leaders, and to ſweare to ſuch Articles as they ſhould propound: ſuch as refuſed were either impriſoned or put to death, as was a certaine Prieſt Chancellor to the Biſhop of Lincoln. The King being certified of this Commotion, ſent againſt the Rebels with great Forces the Duke of Suffolke, and the Earles of Shrewsbury and Ken

                           , either to appeaſe or ſuppreſſe them. The rumonr of an Army marching againſt them, ſo quailed their courages, that they ſent to excuſe themſelves vnto the King, pretending,
                     That their endeavours tended to no other than the ſafety of his Maieſly, and good of the Realme: That 
                           •
                        ee hauing followed the advice of bad Counſellors, had lately beyond the example of any of his Anceſtors, changed many things in the eſtate of Commonwealth and Church: That having diſpoſseſſed the

religious Inhabitants, he had demoliſhed many Monasteries, where the poore had daily reliefe, and God was wont to be deuoutly worſhipped by godly men: That the Feaſts of Saints inſtituted many yeares ſince, were profaned by his command: That new Tenets which the Catholique Church did abhor, were every where preached and obtruded to the people: That now in each aged perſon was to be ſeene the Embleme of Jgnorance, who having one foot in the grave, were faine to betake them to their ABC Bookes, that they might learne new kinde of Prayers never before vſed by any Chriſtians: That many vniuſt and pernicious Lawes had lately beene enacted, and great Subſidies exacted both of the Clergy and Laity even in the time of Peace, which were not wont to be demanded but for the maintenance of Wars: That the Commons in generall did diſtaſte theſe things; and the rather, for that they conceived them to be but trialls of their patience, and the beginnings of more inſupportable euills. Wherefore they humbly beſeeched his Maieſty, whom they could not ſafely petition vnarmed, that the Authours of theſe pernicious counſailes might ſit no longer at the ſterne, but that others who ſhould faithfully

 endeavour the amendment of the aforeſaid evills, might ſupply their places, and that it might not be any way preiudiciall to them, that they had taken Armes, which even with the loſſe of their deereſt bloud they were ready to imploy for his Maieſties ſafety, and the defence of the Realme.
                     The King had a Spirit befitting his greatneſſe, and perceiving them to ſhrinke, could not diſſemble the rage he had conceived at the preſumption of this raſcally rout, who durſt capitulate with their Soveraigne, and ſeeke to curbe the vnlimited power of Kings. Wherefore he roughly commands them, that without delay one hundred of their company, ſuch as by his appointment ſhould be made choice of, ſhould be deliuered vp to his mercy. The performance whereof if they but deferred, nothing but extremity was to be expected. The report wherof made the Rebels disband, each one fearing leaſt himſelfe might helpe to make vp the number of this Hecatombe.
                     
                     
                        Inſurrection in Yorkeſhire.
                         This blaze was yet ſcarce quenched, when within ſix dayes another far more dangerous, kindled by the ſame accidents, bewraied it ſelfe in Yorke-ſhire, where no fewer than fourty thouſand had gathered together, naming themſelues Fellowes of the holy Pilgrimage▪
                         and that the ſpecious pretext of Religion might palliate their madneſſe, they in their Enſignes on the one ſide portraied the Saviour of the world hanging on the Croſſe, on the other ſide the Chalice, and the Hoſt by them called the Body of our Lord. They ſurpriſed many of the Nobility, as EDWARD LEE Archbiſhop of Yorke, (hee that writ againſt ERASMVS) the Lords DARCY and HVSSEY, beſides many Knights and Gentlemen, whom they forced to

Theſe reaſons made theſe Nobles vnwilling to hazard a battaile. But the Rebells deſperate reſolution admitted no parley, wherefore by conſent of both Armies the field was appointed on the Eue of the Saints Simon and Iude. Betweene both Armies did run a little Brooke ſo ſhallow, that on the Eve of the battaile it was in moſt places paſſable for footmen even without danger of wetting their feet: but that night (God abhorring the effuſion of ſo much Engliſh blond) a raine (and that no great one) fell, which ſo raiſed this little Brooke (the like whereof never happened there before) that it became impaſſable both for horſe and man, which hindered the meeting of the two Armies.

                        Rebellion in Irland.
                         Neither was the Eſtate of Irland more peaceable then of England. GIRALD FITZ-GIRALD Earle of Kildare having been twelve yeares Lord Deputy of Irland, was for ſome flight matters removed, called into England, and condemned to death; which puniſhment hee through the malice of WOLSEY had vndergone, had not friendſhip ſhewed it's effects in the Lieutenant of the Tower, to whoſe cuſtody the Earle was committed. He having received a Mandate for the execution of the Earle, durſt hazard the diſpleaſure of the potent Cardinall, to ſave his friend. Wherefore he repaires to the King at midnight, deſirous to know his Maieſties pleaſure concerning the Earle: who not onely diſapproved the Mandate, but alſo pardoning the Earle, received

him into his favour, and a few yeares after reſtored him to his former dignitie of Lord Deputy. But theſe garboiles happening in England, hee is for as ſlight ſuſpitions as before, revoked, and commanded to attend at the Counſaile Table, where by his anſwers hee appeared not altogether ſo innocent, but that hee was againe committed to the Tower. Before his departure out of Irland, the King had commanded him to ſubſtitute ſome one in his place, for whoſe faith &amp; diligence he would vndertake. Hee had a Sonne named THOMAS, little above twenty yeares old, a haughty and ſtout young Lord, very ingenious, and exceedingly affecting his Father. To this Sonne, as to another PHAETON he commits the guidance of his Chariot.
                     
                        
                           —Sed quae non viribus iſtis
                           Munera conveniunt, nec tam puerilibus annis,
                        
which indeed proved fatall to them both, and to almoſt the whole Family. For no ſooner was the Earle impriſoned, but report (raiſed as is coniectured by his enemies) beheaded him, threatening the like to his off-ſpring and brethren, whoſe deſtruction the King had moſt certainely reſolved. The author of this report was vncertaine, and the young Lord as raſhly credulous, who taking Armes, ſolicited the aid of his friends againſt the Kings injuſtice. Hee had then five Vnckles brethren to his Father, three of which at firſt diſſuaded him from theſe violent proceedings. But paſſion had excluded reaſon; and they at length aſſociate themſelves with their Nephew, with whome they were involved in the ſame ruine. Many others

 flocking vnto him, hee had ſuddenly raiſed a great Army, wherewith marching vp and downe the Countrey, hee robbed and killed them who refuſed to obey him. And among the reſt, hee permitted the Archbiſhop of Dublin to be murthered in his ſight. The poore Earle already afflicted with a palſey, was ſo ſtricken to the heart with the newes of this tumult, that hee but a few dayes ſurvived the knowledge of his vnhappineſſe. The King leuying great Forces, quickly curbed the vnruly Youth, and after ſome moneths forced him to yeeld. His Vnkles were either taken, or willingly ſubmitted themſelves. All of them were ſent to London, and there brought to their anſwer. There goes a Story, that thoſe three Vnkles who endeavoured to reſtraine their headſtrong Nephew, did halfe preſume on the Kings clemency, vntill in the paſſage demanding of the Maſter the name of the Ship wherein they failed; and vnderſtanding it was called The Cow, bethinking themſelves of a certaine Prophecy, That fiue Sonnes of an Earle ſhould in the belly of a Cow be carried into England neuer to returne; they forthwith deſpaired of pardon. The event approved the skill of the Wizard: For ſome enemies to this noble Family incenſing the King, by ſuggeſting, that hee ſhould never expect to ſettle Jrland as long as any of the race of the FITZ-GIRALDS remained, eaſily prevailed with the King for their execution. In reguard whereof I cannot blame GIRALD the Brother of THOMAS, who truſting not to the weake plea of his innocence, then ſicke of the Meaſles as hee was, ſought by making an eſcape, to ſet himſelfe out of the reach of malice. Being therefore packed vp in a bundle of cloathes, hee was priuately conveied to

one of his Friends, with whome hee lurked vntill hee found an opportunity of eſcaping into France, where hee was for a time favourably received by the King. But long hee could not be there ſecure, the Agents of HENRY preſſing hard, That by the League all Fugitives were to be delivered: wherefore he went thence into the Netherlands; where finding himſelfe in no leſſe danger then before, hee fled into Italy to REIGNALD POOLE, who maintained and vſed him very nobly, and at length procured him to be reſtored to his Countrey and the Honors of his Anceſtors.
                     
                        
                           Cardinall Poole. The mention of POOLE falls fit with our time, hee being this yeare on the two and twentieth of December by Pope PAVL the Fourth choſen into the Colledge of Cardinalls. Hee was neere of bloud to the King, who firſt beſtowed learning on him, and afterward finding his modeſty and excellent diſpoſition, conferred on him the Deanry of Exceſter. But travailing afterwards to foraine Vniverſities, hee was in Jtaly quickly bewitched with the ſorceries of the Circe of Rome, inſomuch that hee became a deadly enemy to his Poſterer, his Prince, his Kinſman. For when hee would neither allow of the divorce from the Lady CATHARINE, nor the abrogating of the authority of the Pope, and openly condemned other the Kings proceedings in Eccleſiaſticall affaires, refuſing alſo to obey the King who commanded him home; HENRY diſpoſed of his Deanry, and withdrew the large ſtipend which he had yearely allowed him. The Pope therefore intending to make vſe of this man as an engine of battery againſt the King (and being induced by the commendations of Cardinall CONTAREN) beſtowed on him a Cardinalls Hat, and was thereby aſſured of him, who had of late beene ſuſpected to

 haue beene ſeaſoned with the Leauen of purer Doctrine. But of that hereafter.

                     THe accidents of this yeare were tragicall, and England the Scene of bloud and deaths of many famous Perſonages. On the third ofRebels executed. 
                        February was THOMAS FITZ-GIRALD beheaded for treaſon, his five Vnkles hanged, drawne, and quartered, and their members fixed over the gates of London. The ſame moneth, NICHOLAS MVSGRAVE and THOMAS GILBY, for that ſtirring a new rebellion, they had beſieged Carliſle, were executed.
                     The tenth of March was IOHN PASLEW Bachelour of Divinity and Abbot of Whalley, put to death at Lancaſter, and with him one EASTGATE a Monke of the ſame place▪ and three dayes after them another Monke called HAYDOCKE was hanged at Whalley. The Abbots of Sauley and Woburne with two Monkes make the like end at Woburne. And a little after, one Doctor MACARELL, another Abbot, the Vicar of Louth, two other Prieſts, and ſeven Lay men. All theſe, for as much as I can any way collect, were condemned for hauing beene eſpeciall furtherers of the late rebellions. But the Chieftaines and nobler ſort were reſerved vntill June, at what time the Lords Darcey &amp; Huſſey were beheaded, the one at Lincolne, the other at London; Sir ROBERT CONSTABLE, Sir THOMAS PERCY, Sir FRANCIS BIGOT, Sir STEPHEN HAMILTON, and Sir IOHN BVLMER were likewiſe put to death: MARGARET

Lady to Sir IOHN BVLMER was burned at London: WILLIAM THVRST Abbot of Fountaines, ADAM SVDBVRY Abbot of Gervaux, the Abbot of Rivers, WOLD Prior of Birlington, GEORGE LVMLEY, NICHOLAS TEMPEST Eſquires, and ROBERT ASKE, with many others, as having beene partakers in the late Inſurrection, did likewiſe partake in puniſhment for the ſame. And for a Commotion in Somerſet-ſhire in Aprill were three ſcorecondemned, whereof onely fourteene ſuffered.
                     
                        Cardinall Poole writes againſt the King. 
                        But leaſt any one may wonder at theſe ſevere and vnheard of courſes taken againſt the Clergy, I thinke it not amiſſe to relate what SLEIDAN writes of Cardinall POOLE, who ſet forth one or two Bookes, which as yet lurking at Rome, about this time were ſpred abroad in Germany, and came at length to the Kings hands. Wherein directing his ſtile to the King, hee ſharpely rep
                              •
                           chendeth him for taking vpon him the title of Head of the Church, which onely belonged to the Pope, who is CHRISTS Vicar on earth, &amp;c. Then hee proceeds to the matter of his Divorce, alledging, That hee neither out of terrour of conſcience, nor feare of God, (as hee pretended) but out of luſt and blinde loue had forſaken the Lady CATHARINE his Wife, whom his Brother Prince ARTHVR a weake young man, and but fourteene yeares old, had left a Virgin: That it was not lawfull for him to marry ANNE BOLEN, whoſe Sister hee had before vſed as his Concubine: And that hee himſelfe had confeſſed to the Emperour and others, That hee found the Lady CATHARINE a Maide. Hee alſo eagerly reproveth him for

 ſeeking the opinions of the Vniverſities concerning his former marriage, and triumphing in his owne wickedneſſe, when ſome of them had pronounced it inceſtuous: and that hee might bee aſhamed to prefer the Daughter of a Whore, before one that was legitimate, and a moſt Vertuous Princeſſe. Then ſpeaking of the death of the Biſhop of Rocheſter and Sir THOMAS MORE, hee deteſts his cruelty. Hee then rips vp what tyranny hee had exerciſed over his Subiects of all degrees, in what miſeries hee had plunged this flouriſhing Realme, what dangers he incurred from the Emperour, in reguard of the iniury offered to his Aunt, and the overthrow of Religion, and that hee could not expect any aid either from his owne or forraine Nations, who had deſerued ſo ill of the Chriſtian Commonwealth. After this, hee whets on the Emperour to revenge the diſhonour of his Family; affirming that Turciſme (meaning the Proteſtant Religion) had found entertainement in England and Germany. And after many bitter reproofes, hee invites HENRY to repentance, perſuading him, That for theſe evills there was no other remedy, but to returne to the boſome of the Church, in the defence whereof (a moſt glorious example) hee had made vſe not onely of his Sword, but his Pen alſo.
                     Neither did the Cardinall onely by Booke, but by other perſonall endeavours manifeſt his ſpleene againſt the King, beeing ſent Embaſſadour from the Pope to the French, vnder colour of reconciling him with the Emperour; but his chiefe errant was, to combine them both againſt HENRY. Whereof hee having intelligence, did by his Agent earneſtly ſolicite FRANCIS, That in reguard of their mutuall amity, hee would cauſe POOLE to bee apprehended, as

guilty of high Treaſon, and ſent to him, where hee ſhould vndergo the puniſhment due therefore. But becauſe Religion and the Law of Nations had beene violated in betraying any (eſpecially the Popes) Embaſſadour, the French could not yeeld to the Kings requeſt: but to ſhew that hee would adminiſter no cauſe of offence, hee refuſed to admit of his Embaſſy, and commanded him ſpeedily to depart out of his Dominions.
                     HERCVLES ſtature might be gueſſed at by the proportion of his foot; and by this one mans endeavours, HENRY was taught what, if need were, hee was to expect of his Clergy. So that hee was eaſily induced as any of them offended, to ſend him to his grave, for that a dead Lion biteth not: And this courſe beeing taken with his profeſſed enemies, the feare of the like puniſhment would ſecure him of the reſt.

                         On the twelfth of October, the Queene having long ſuffered the throwes of a moſt difficult travaile, and ſuch a one, wherein either the Mother or the Infant muſt neceſſarily periſh, out of her wombe was ripped Prince EDWARD, who after ſucceeded his Father in the Crowne. The Queene onely ſurviving two daies, died on the fourteenth of October, and on the twelfth of November was with great pompe buried at Windſore in the middle of the Quire, on whoſe Tombe is inſcribed this Epitaph:

                     On the eighteenth of October the Infant was created Prince of Wales, Duke of Cornewall, andSeimour Earle of Hertford. Earle of Cheſter: and with him his Vnkle EDWARD SEIMOVR brother to the deceaſed Queene, Lord Beauchampe, and Earle of Hereford; which Honours onely (and not thoſe afterwardsFitz-William Earle of Southampton.

Then alſo WILLIAM POWLET and IOHN RVSSELL began their races in the liſts of Honour; POWLET being made Treaſurer, and RVSSELL Comptroller of the Kings Houſhold, and both ſworne of the Privy Counſaile. Neither was here their non vltra, the one being afterward raiſed to Lord Treaſurer of England and Marquis of Wincheſter, the other to Earle of Bedford, wherein hee dying in the yeare 1554, his Sonne FRANCIS that pious old man, and liberall releiuer of the Poore, ſucceeded him, who at the very inſtant of his death loſt his Sonne FRANCIS ſlaine by a Scot Anno 1587. Which FRANCIS was Father to EDWARD Earle of Bedford, and brother to WILLIAM by King IAMES created Lord RVSSELL.

There were ſome Images of more eſpeciall fame, and Shrines of reputed Saints, Whereunto Pilgrimages were made from the fartheſt parts of the Kingdome, nay even from foraine Countries alſo: the Oblations whereto were ſo many and ſo rich, that they not onely ſuffiſed for the maintenance of Prieſts and Monkes, but alſo to the heaping vp of incredible wealth.

                           Beckets ſhrine demoliſh▪d. of THOMAS BECKET Archbiſhop of Canterbury was covered with plates of gold, and laden with

 guifts of ineſtimable value. The blinde zeale of thoſe and former times, had decked it with gemmes, chaines of gold of great weight, andVniones. pearles of that large ſize, which in our Language finde no proper terme. This Tombe was razed, and his bones found entire; in ſteed of whoſe head the Monkes vſually obtruded the skull of ſome other, peradventure better deſerving then did their ſuppoſed Martyr. The ſpoile of this Monument, wherein nothing was meaner then gold, filled two cheſts ſo full, that each of them required eight ſtrong men for the portage. Among the reſt was a ſtone of eſpeciall luſtre called the Royall of France, offered by LEWIS the Seventh, King of France, in the yeare 1179, together with a great maſſy cup of gold, at what time hee alſo beſtowed an annuity on the Monkes of that Church, of an hundred tunnes of wine. This ſtone was after ward highly priſed by the King, who did continually weare it on his thumbe. ERASMVS ſpeakes much of the magnificence of this Monument, as alſo of the Image ofThe Image of our Lady of Walſingham.
                         our Lady of Walſingham, both which hee had ſeene and admired. This Image was alſo ſtripped of whatſoeuer worthy thing it had, the like being alſo done in other the like places, and the ſtatues and bones of the dead digged vp and burned, that they might bee no further cauſe of ſuperſtition. Among the reſt of theſe condemned Images there was a Crucifex in South-Wales, called of the Inhabitants, Darvell Gatharen, concerning which there was a kinde of prophecy, That it ſhould one day fire a whole Foreſt.Frier Foreſt makes good a Prophecy. It chanced that at this time one Doctor FOREST a Frier Obſervant, who had formerly taken the Oath of Supremacy, was vpon his relapſe apprehended and condemned of Treaſon and Hereſy: For this Fryer a new Gallowes was erected, whereon hee was hanged by the arme pits, and vnderneath

him a fire made of this Image, wherewith hee was burned, and ſo by his death made good the Prophecy.
                     Great was the Treaſure which the King raiſed of the ſpoiles of Churches and Religious Houſes. But whether the guilt of ſacriledge (adhering like a conſuming canker) made this ill gotten treaſure vnprofitable, or that he found he had need of greater ſupplies to withſtand the dangers that threatened him from abroad, not content with what hee had already corraded, hee caſts his eyes on the wealth of the Abbeyes that had eſcaped the violence of the former tempeſt: and not expecting (as hee deemed it) a needleſſe Act of Parliament, ſeizeth on the reſt of the Abbeyes and Religious Houſes of the Realme. And firſt hee begins with that at Canterbury, dedicated to AVGVSTINE the Engliſh Apoſtle,
                           Saint Auguſtines as Canterbury, who was there interred. This being the firſt Fruits of Chriſtianity among this Nation (I meane the Saxons, for the Britans had beene watred with ſtreames derived even from the Fountaines Apoſtolique, far more pure then were thoſe later overflowes of AVGVSTINE) hee invades, expells the Monkes, and divides their meanes betweene his Exchequer and Courtiers. Battaile Abbey built by WILLIAMBattaile Abbey,

                        and others ſuppreſſed. 
                        Stratford in Eſſex, Lewis in Suſſex, the Charterhouſe, Blacke-Friers, Gray-Friers, and White-Friers in London, felt the fury of the ſame Whirlewinde.
                     At the ſame time among many other Reformations in this Church, that wholeſome Iniunction was

 one, whereby the Bible tranſlated and printed inThe Bible tranſlated. 
                        Engliſh, was commanded to be kept in every pariſh Church, and to bee conveniently placed where any that were ſo deſirous, might reade therein.
                     They who were more eagerly addicted to the ſuperſtition of their Anceſtours, brooked not theſe proceedings, among whom were chiefe HENRYThe Marquis of Exceſter and others beheaded. COVRTNEY Marquis of Excester, HENRY Lord Mountague brother to Cardinall POOLE, and Sir EDWARD NEVILL brother to the Lord ABERGAVENNY, who on the fifth day of November, vpon the accuſation of Sir GEOFFREY POOLE Brother to the Lord MOVNTAGVE, were committed to the Tower, for having maintained intelligence with the Cardinall, and conſpired the Kings deſtruction: for which they were on the third of the enſuing Ianuary, the Lord AVDLEY ſitting high Steward for the time, arraigned and condemned, and on the ninth of the ſame moneth beheaded. Two Prieſts named CROFTS and COLINS, with one HOLLAND a Mariner, as partakers in the ſame guilt, were hanged and quartered at Tiburne. This COVRTNEY was by the Fathers ſide of a very noble diſcent, deriving himſelfe from the bloud Royall of France, by HVGH COVRTNEY created Earle of Devonſhire by EDWARD the Third. But by his mother hee far more neerely participated of the Bloud Royall of England, being Sonne to CATHARINE Daughter to EDWARD the Fourth, who was Siſter to Queene ELIZABETH the Mother of King HENRY. The King l

                        ng favoured him as his Couzen germane, but at length in regard of his neere Alliance to the Crowne, became jealous of his Greatneſſe, whereof hee had lately given more

then ſufficient teſtimony, in ſuddenly arming ſome thouſands to oppoſe againſt the Yorke-Shire Rebells. The conſideration whereof made HENRY gladly entertaine any occaſion to cut off this Noble Gentleman.
                     
                        
                           Lambert convented &amp; burned. About the ſame time IOHN LAMBERT a religious and learned man was alſo condemned, the King himſelfe ſitting Iudge. This LAMBERT being accuſed of Hereſy, appealed from his Ordinary to the King; who fearing leaſt hee ſhould be accounted a Lutheran, reſolved vpon this occaſion to manifeſt to the World how hee ſtood affected in Religion. To this end ſummoning as many of the Biſhops and other Peeres of the Realme as could conveniently be preſent, he cauſed Scaffolds to be built in Westminſter Hall, from whence the people might be ſpectators and witneſſes of the Acts of that day. On the right hand of the King were ſeated the Biſhops, and behinde them the Iudges and chief Lawyers of the Realme: at his left hand ſate the Temporall Lords, and behinde them the Gentlemen of the Privy Chamber. LAMBERT being brought to the Bar, DAY Biſhop of Chicheſter, by the Kings appointment made an Oration, wherein he declared the cauſe of this meeting; ſaying,
                     That LAMBERT hauing beene accuſed of Hereſy before his Ordinary, had made his Appeale vnto the King, as if expecting from his Maieſty more favour for Hereſy, then from the Biſhop. So that he now found it be true, whereof hee had been

 oft informed, That the credulous People were verily perſuaded, that his Maieſty abhorring the Religion of his Anceſtors, had embraced the new Tenets lately broached in Germany. True it was, the tyranny of the Court of Rome had beene troubleſome to his Predeceſſors, but to Him intolerable, and therefore had Hee ſhaken it off: That Religion might no longer patronize Jdleneſſe, Hee had expelled Monkes, who were no other then Drones in the Beehive: Hee had taken away the idolatrous worſhip of Jmages, had permitted to his Subiects the reading and knowledge of Gods Word, hither to prohibited by the Church of Rome, leaſt their wiles and couſenages ſhould be diſcovered: and had made reformation in ſome other things peradventure of leſſe moment, which no man could deny, would much redound to the good both of Church and Common-wealth. But as for other things, Hee had determined there ſhould be no change in the Church during his Raigne: Which his Reſolution Hee now intended publiquely to manifeſt His Maieſties deſire was, That the Delinquent renouncing his Errours, ſhould ſuffer himſelfe to be received into the boſome of the

Church: to which end partly, and partly to ſhew that Hee thirſted not after any ones bloud, out of his clemency Hee had procured the preſence of thoſe Graue and Learned men (meaning the Biſhops) who by Authority and force of Arguments ſhould if it were poſsible, bring backe this ſtraied Sheepe into the Fold of the Church. But if hee perverſly oppugned the Truth, and all perſuaſions notwithſtanding, became immoveable, Hee would by this mans exemplary puniſhment make knowne, what others ſhould in the like Caſe expect, and inſtruct the Judges and Magiſtrates, what they ought to do therein.
                     The Biſhop having ended, the King demanded of LAMBERT, What hee thought of the preſence of CHRISTS body in the Sacrament? Whoſe anſwer being little to the Kings liking, reaſons and arguments were produced, as if a Diſputation in the Schooles, and not a Iuſticiary Seſſion had beene appointed. Five whole hou

But neither this courſe, nor the battery of threats and terrors prevailing againſt his conſtancy, the King commanded the Lord CROMWELL to paſſe ſentence of condemnation vpon him, by vertue whereof within a day or two after

 hee was burned. Neither this dreadfull Sentence, nor his torturing death did any way appale him, which hee ſo little reguarded, that going to his death, hee merrily tooke his break

                     ON the third of March, Sir NICHOLAS CAREW Knight of the Garter, and Maſter of the Horſe, was beheaded for being of Counſaile with the Marquis of Excester, and the Lord MOVNTAGVE. And on the eight and twentieth of April a Parliament began, wherein
                           Margaret Counteſſe of Salisbury condemned. MARGARET Counteſſe of Salisbury Mother to Cardinall POOLE and Daughter to GEORGE Duke of Clarence who was brother to EDWARD the Fourth, was attainted of high Treaſon, and condemned without hearing, and with her the Cardinall her Sonne, GERTRVDE Widow to the Marquis of Exceſter, Sir ADRIAN FORTESCVE, and Sir THOMAS DINGLEY. DINGLEY and FORTESCVE were beheaded on the tenth of Iuly, and the Counteſſe being then aged threeſcore and ten yeares, ſuffered two yeares after.
                     
                        The ſubverſion of Religious Houſes In the ſame Parliament it was inacted, That the King might erect new Epiſcopall Seas in oportune places of the Realme. For the performance whereof, and of ſome other things no leſſe ſpecious,

the late diſſolution of thoſe Abbeyes whereon the King ſeiſed, was confirmed, and all Religious Houſes as yet vnſuppreſſed, were granted to the King for ever. Vpon notice whereof, many either out of guilt of conſcience, or deſirous to purchaſe the Kings favour, ſurrendred their charge even before they were required. And firſt of all the Abbot and Convent of Saint Albans (the firſt Abbot of the Realme, as Saint ALBAN was the firſt Martyr: which Honour was conferred on this Houſe by Pope ADRIAN the Fourth, whoſe Father had long lived a Monaſticall life therein) forſake their rich Abbey ſeated neere the ruines of Verolamium once a great and antient City, and leaue it to the mercy of the Courtiers. Which dereliction afforded matter of example to many other, few enioying that ſecurity of conſcience, that they durſt lay claime to their owne. Onely three were found, whoſe innocence made them ſo regardleſſe of threats, promiſes, or reward, that they could never be induced to betray the goods of their Churches to the mercileſſe impiety of ſacrilegious Harpyes: which three were I

 one was taken of adminiſtring the Oath of Supremacy, which they refuſing, are as enemies to the Eſtate condemned of high Treaſon. BECH was hanged at Colcheſter, and FARINGDON with two Prieſts named RVG and OGNION at Reding. WHITING a man very aged, and by reaſon therof doting, ſcarce perceiving that he had beene condemned, returning from the place of Iudgement (which was in the Biſhops Palace at Wells diſtant from Glaſtonbury foure miles) with conceit that hee was reſtored to his Abbey, was ſuddenly rapt vp to the top of the Tor (a hill that ſurveies the country round about) and without leave of bidding his Convent farewell, which hee earneſtly begged, was preſently hanged, the ſtaine of ingratitude ſticking faſt to the authors of this ſpeedy execution, of whom the poore Abbot is reported to have better deſerved. With WHITING were two Monkes alſo executed named ROGER IAMES and IOHN THORNE, their bodies all drawne and quartered, and ſet vp in divers places of the Countrey.

                         who governes the reſt, vnles it be in S. Davids, where the Chanter; and Landaf, where the Archdeacon is Head of the Chapter.
                     Theſe things thus ordered, the King ſtill jealous leaſt it ſhould be conceived that hee had forſaken the Religion of his Fathers, began to thunder out againſt the maintainers of new Tenets, and much againſt CRANMERS will, by Parliament enacted the Law of the Six Articles, the ſumme whereof was,
                     
                        
                           1
                           The Law of the Six Articles. That if any one ſhould deny the True and Reall preſence of the Body of CHRIST in the Sacrament, or ſhould maintaine, That the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine remained after the words of Conſecration pronounced

 by the Prieſt, he ſhould be burned as an Heretique.
                        
                           2 If any ſhould deny the Sacrament to be ſufficiently adminiſtred vnder one Species only:
                        
                           3 Or ſhould hold it lawfull for Priests to be married, but much more he that having entred into holy Orders, ſhould preſume to take a Wife:
                        
                           4 Or that Chaſtity vowed vpon mature deliberation was not to be kept:
                        
                           5 Or that private Maſſes ought not be celebrated in the Church of England, or els where:
                        
                           6 Or that Auricular Confeſsion was not expedient; hee ſhould for his errours vndergo loſſe of life by hanging.
                     
                     
                        
                           Latimer and Schaxton reſigne their Biſhoprickes. Theſe Lawes like thoſe of Draco written in bloud, were the deſtruction of multitudes, &amp; ſilenced thoſe who had been hitherto furtherers of Reformation. Among whom HVGH LATIMER and NICHOLAS SCHAXTON Biſhops, the one of Worceſter, the other of Salisbury, were remarkable, who that they might quietly enioy themſelves, the Parliament being ſcarce diſſolved, did both on one day, viz. the firſt of July, reſigne their Biſhoprickes. LATIMER (who for the freedome of his conſcience could as willingly reſigne his life, as hee did this rich Biſhopricke, being burned for it in Queene MARIES raigne) after

his Reſignation taking off his Rochet, being a merry conceited man, with a little leape lifted himſelfe from the ground, ſaying, That hee felt himſelfe much more light and quicke, now hee had freed himſelfe of ſo great a burthen.
                     
                     HENRY (in reguard of his wiving diſpoſition) had long continued a Widdower. And that he ſhould at length marry, the conſideration of his Eſtate being ſurrounded with Enemies paſſionate in the Popes cauſe, perſuaded him. Wherein he alſo gave eare to CROMWELL, who adviſed him to combine with thoſe Eſtates, whom the burthen of the Popes tyranny had forced to the ſame courſes and like feares. By whoſe aſſiſtance he might countermine the ſecret practiſes of Rome. A counſaile without doubt good and befitting the times, but producing the effects of Ill ones, proving (as is thought) Pernicious to the Giuer. For theThe arrivall of certaine Princes of Germany in England, for the treatiſe of a Match betweene the King &amp; Lady Anne of Cleve.
                         treatiſe of ſuch a Match, in September came into England FREDERICKE Duke and Elector of Saxony, FREDERICKE Duke of Bavaria, OTHO HENRY Count Palatine of Rhine, and the Chancellour of the Duke of Cleve, with ſome others, who were for eight dayes royally entertained by the King at Windſore, where the marriage with ANNE Siſter to the Duke of Cleve being concluded, they returned to their owne Countries.
                     This yeare died MARGARET Queene of Scotland, Siſter to King HENRY, who was buried at the Charterhouſe in the towne of S. IOHN, necre the Tombe of IAMES the Firſt.
                  
                  
                     
                      Anno Dom. 1540. Reg. 32.
                     
                     
                        The King marrieth the Lady of Cleve.
                         ON the Eve of the Circumciſion the Lady ANNE of Cleve deſtinated to the Kings bed, arrived at Dover, was on the third of January triumphantly received at Greenwich, and on the feaſt of the Epiphany ritely married to the King.
                     
                        
                           Cromwell created Earle of Eſſex, and within three months after beheaded. On the twelfth of March HENRY BOVRCHIER Earle of Eſſex, the antienteſt Earle of the Realme, throwne by an vnruly young horſe which he ſought to breake, brake his necke: by whoſe death the Inheritance was devolved to his daughter, and from her deceaſing without Iſſue, to the Family of DEVREVX, which Family in reguard of their claime by diſcent, was by Queene ELIZABETH advanced to the Earledome of Eſſex. But in the meane time CROMWELL (yet chiefe in the Kings favour) was on the eighteenth of Aprill created Earle of Eſſex.
                     
                     And here behold the frailty of humane affaires. The current of few yeares had from very meane beginnings brought CROMWELL to the height of honour, inſomuch that his happineſſe was admired by all, envied by many: But Fortune intending a Tragedy, he is vnexpectedly apprehended ſitting at the Counſaile Table, and committed to the Tower, where he continued vntill his execution. For in this Parliament begun the twelfth of Aprill, hee is accuſed of Treaſon and Hereſy, without being brought to his anſwer condemned, and on the twenty eighth of Iuly beheaded. This King may well be cenſured of cruell inconſtancy, who

could ſo eaſily diſpence with the death of thoſe whome he had admitted to intimate familiarity, and made vſe of their counſailes and indeavours; as if he had advanced them to no other end, but to depreſſe them. WOLSEY had his turne, CROMWELL ſucceeds, whoſe ſudden downefall there want not thoſe who attribute to Gods Iuſtice inflicted on him for the Sacriledge (whereof hee was reported to be the Author) committed in the ſubverſion of ſo many Religious Houſes. And indeed even they who confeſſe the rowſing of ſo many vnprofitable Epicures out of their dennes, and the aboliſhing of Superſtition, wherewith the Divine Worſhip had by them beene polluted, to have beene an act of ſingular Iuſtice and Piety; do notwithſtanding complaine of the loſſe of ſo many ſtately Churches dedicated to Gods ſervice, the goods whereof were no otherwiſe imploied, then for the ſatisfaction of private mens covetouſneſſe: and although many have abuſed the Vaile of Religion, yet was that Monaſticall life inſtituted according to the pious example of antient Fathers, that they who found themſelves vnfit for the execution of worldly affaires, (as many ſuch there are) might in ſuch their voluntary retirements ſpend their dayes in Divine Writings or Meditations: and are verily perſuaded, that for the taking away of theſe things, God was offended both with the King and CROMWELL. But SLEIDAN peradventure comes neerer the matter, touching the immediate cauſe of his death.
                     
                        Lady Anne of Cleve repudiated. About this time (ſaith hee) the King of England beheadeth THOMAS CROMWELL, whome hee had from fortunes anſwerable to his low parentage, raiſed to great Honours; repudiates the Lady ANNE of Cleve, and marrieth CATHARINE HOWARD
                        
 Daughter to the Lord EDMOND HOWARD, who was Brother to the Duke of Norfolke. CROMWELL had beene procurer of the Match with ANNE. But the King loving CATHARINE, is thought to have beene perſuaded by her to make away CROMWELL, whome ſhee ſuſpected to be a Remora to her advancement. The actions of Kings are not to be ſifted too neerely, for which we are charitably to preſume they haue reaſons, and thoſe inſcrutable.
                     
                     But let vs ſee the proceſle of this divorce. Six moneths this coniugall band laſted firme without ſcruple, the King and Queene giving daily teſtimonies of their mutuall love. On the twentieth of June the Queene is willed to remove from London, (where the King ſtaied by reaſon of the Parliament) to Richmond, a place pretended in reguard of the ſcituation and aire, to be more for her health.
                     On the ſixth of Iuly reaſons are propoſed by certaine Lords purpoſely ſent to the lower Houſe of Parliament, demonſtrating the invalidity of the Kings marriage with the Lady ANNE, ſo that it was lawfull for them both to marry where they pleaſed. The ſame reaſons are alledged in the Convocation houſe, and generally approved. Whereupon the Queene alſo (whether forced or willing) conſenting, the Parliament pronounced the marriage void.
                     What the allegations were is vncertaine. Some relate diſability by reaſon of ſome defects to be obiected to her, which ſeemes the more probable, for that in her Letters wherein ſhee ſubmitted her ſelfe to the iudgement and determination of the Parliament, ſhee affirmed that the King never knew her carnally. Whether for this, or for that Nature having not over liberally endowed her wtih beauty;

but a private woman ſhe became, and as ſuch (not enduring to returne to her friends with diſhonor) ſhee lived vpon ſome lands aſſigned her by the King, (who alwaies vſed her reſpectively) vntill the fifteenth of Iuly Annv 15
                           •
                        7, at what time ſhee ended her diſcontented life, and lieth buried at Weſtminſter on the South ſide of the Quire in a Tombe not yet finiſhed.
                     Scarce had the reſolution of the Convocation Houſe, and the Decree concerning it paſſed both Houſes, when this luſty Widower with as good ſucceſſe as before, marrieth his fifth Wife CATHARINEThe King marrieth Catharine Howard.
                         HOWARD. When their nuptialls were celebrated is not knowne, but on the eighth of August in Royall habiliments ſhee ſhewed her ſelfe as Queene.
                     The fautors of Reformation were much diſmaied at the ſudden vnqueening of ANNE: fearing (not without cauſe) leaſt it proving occaſion of enmity betweene HENRY and the Princes of Germany, he muſt of neceſſity rely on them who miſliked our divorce from Rome. But the King proceeding ſtill in the courſe he had begun, like a torrent bearing all before him, not onely cauſed three Anabaptiſts to be burned, but alſo many ſincere Profeſſors of the Truth▪ for not ſubſcribing to the Six Articles. Among whome three Divines were moſt eminent, viz. ROBERT BARNES Doctor of Divinity,Protestants and Papiſts alike perſecuted. THOMAS GERARD, and WILLIAM IEROM Bachelors, who by Parliament (vnheard) being condemned for Hereſie, were on the one and thirtieth committed to the 
                           •
                        orments of the mercileſſe fire. At the ſame time and place three other Doctors of Divinity, viz. POWELL, ABIE, and FETHRSTON were hanged for denying the Kings Supremacy▪ the ſight whereof made a French
                        
 man cry out in theſe words, Deus bone, quomodo hic vivunt gentes? Suſpenduntur Papistae, comburuntur, Antipapiſtae; Good God, how do the People make a ſhift to live here, where both Papiſts are hanged; and Antipapiſts
                        The Prior of Dancaſter &amp; fox others hanged. 
                        burned? In Auguſt the Prior of Dancaſter and ſix other for defending the Inſtitution of the life Monaſticall (a crime now become as capitall as the greateſt) being alſo condemned by Act of Parliament, were hanged.
                     
                        The Lord Hungerford hanged. The ſame day with the Lord CROMWELL, the Lord HVNGERFORD was alſo beheaded. As their cauſes were divers, ſo died they alike differently. CROMWELLS conſcience quietly welcommed Death: to the other ſuffering for that moſt vnnaturall crime of Sodomy, Death preſented it ſelfe with that horror, that the apprehenſion of it made him as impatient, as if hee had been ſeized with a frenzy.
                  
                  
                     Anno Dom. 1541. Reg 33.
                     
                     
                        Beginnings of a Commotion in Yorke-ſhire.
                         THe late Yorke-Shire Rebellion was not ſo throughly quenched, but it againe began to ſhew it ſelfe; but by the puniſhment of the chiefe Incendiaries it was quickely ſuppreſſed. Fourteene of the Conſpirators were put to death; LEIGH a Gentlenan, THORNTON a Yeoman, and TATTERSHALL a Cloatheir, at London: Sir IOHN NEVILL and ten others at Yorke. Which Commotion whether raiſed in favour of Religion, or being ſuſpected that it had any abettors beyond the Seas, is thought to have haſtened the death of the long ſithence condemned Counteſſe of Sarisbury, who

on the ſeven and twentieth of May was beheaded in the Tower.
                     
                        
                           Lord Leonard Grey beheaded.
                         The eight and twentieth of Iune the Lord LEONARD GREY Deputy of Irland, did on the Tower hill publiquely vndergo the like puniſhment. Hee was Sonne to the Marquis of Dorſet, neere allied to the King, and a brave martiall man, having often done his Countrey good ſervice. But for that he had ſuffered his Nephew GERARD FITZ-GERARD (brother to THOMAS lately executed) proclaimed enemy to the Eſtate, to make an eſcape, and in revenge of ſome conceived private iniury had invaded the lands of the Kings friends, hee was arraigned and condemned, ending his life with a reſolution befitting a brave Souldier.
                     
                        The Lord Dacres hanged. The ſame day THOMAS FINES Lord Dacres of the South, with ſome other Gentlemen, for the death of one BVSBRIG ſlaine by them in a fray, was hanged at Tiburne. Many in reguard of his youth and Noble Diſpoſition, much lamented his loſſe, and the Kings inexorable rigour.
                  
                  
                     
                      Anno Dom. 1542. Reg. 34.
                     
                     BY this time HENRY began to finde the conveniency of his change, having married one as fruitfull in evill, as his former wives were in good: who could not containe her ſelfe within the ſacred limits of a Royall marriage bed, but muſt be ſupplied with more vigorous and active bodies, then was that of the now growing aged and vnweildy King. Alas, what is this momentary pleaſure, that for it wee dare hazard a treble life, of Fame, of Body, of Soule? Heaven may be mercifull, but Fame will cenſure, and the inragedQueene Catharine beheaded. Lyon is implacable: ſuch did this Queene finde him, who procured not only her to be condemned by Act of Parliament begun the ſixteenth of Ianuary, and with her the Lady IANE Wife to the Viſcount ROCHFORT, (behold the thrift of the Divine Iuſtice, which made her an Inſtrument of the puniſhment of her owne and others wickedneſſe, who by her calumnies had betraied her owne Husband and his Siſter the late beheaded Queene ANNE) but two others alſo long ſince executed, FRANCIS DERHAM and THOMAS CVLPEPPER, in their double condemnation ſcarce ſufficiently puniſhed. DERHAM had beene too familiar with her in her virgin time, and having after attained to ſome publique offices in Irland, was by her now Queene ſent for and entertained as a houſhold ſervant, in which time whether hee revived his former familiarity is

not manifeſt. But CVLPEPPER was ſo plainly convict of many ſecret meetings with the Queene by the meanes of the Lady ROCHFORT, that the adultery was queſtionles. For which the Queene and the Viſconteſſe ROCHFORT were both beheaded within the Tower on the twelfth of February. DIRHAM had beene hanged, and CVLPEPPER beheaded at Tiburne the tenth of the preceding December.
                     
                     
                        
                           Irland made a Kingdoms. Hitherto our Kings had ſtiled themſelves Lords of Irland, a Title with that rebellious Nation not deemed ſo ſacred and dreadfull, as to force obedience: The Eſtates therefore of Jrland aſſembled in Parliament enacted him King of Irland; according to which Decree he was on the three and twentieth of Ianuary publiquely proclaimed.
                     
                        The Viſcont Liſle deceaſed of a ſurfeit of ioy. About the ſame time ARTHVR Viſcont Liſle naturall Sonne of EDWARD the Fourth, out of a ſurfeit of ſudden ioy deceaſed. Two of his Servants had beene executed the preceding yeare for having conſpired to betray Calais to the French, and the Viſcont as being conſcious committed to the Tower. But vpon manifeſtation of his innocence, the King ſent vnto him Sir THOMAS WRIOTHSLEY Principall Secretary of Eſtate, by whom he ſignified the great content he received in the Viſconts approved fidelity, the effects whereof hee ſhould finde in his preſent liberty, and that degree of favour that a faithfull and beloved Vnkle deſerved. The Viſcont receiving ſuch vnexpected newes imbeliſhed with rich promiſes and Royall tokens (the King having ſent him a Diamond of great value) of aſſured favour; being not ſufficiently capable of ſo great ioy, free from all ſymptomes of any other diſeaſe, the enſuing

 night expired. After whoſe deceaſe Sir IOHN
                           Sir Iohn Dudley made Ʋiſcont Liſle. DVDLEY was created Viſcont LISLE, claiming that honour as hereditary in the right of his mother Lady ELIZABETH Siſter and Heire to the Lord EDWARD GREY Viſcont LISLE Wife to the late deceaſed Lord ARTHVR, but formerly married to EDMVND DVDLEY one of the Barons of the Exchequer, beheaded the firſt yeare of this Kings raigne. Which I the rather remember, for that this man afterwards memorable for his power and dignities, might have provod more happy in his Iſſue, then his greatneſſe, had not his owne ambition betraied ſome of theſe faire ſprouts to the blaſt of vnſeaſonable hopes, and nature denying any (at leaſt lawfull) iſſue to the reſt, the name and almoſt remembrance of this great Family hath ceaſed. Of which hereafter.
                     
                        Scotland had beene long peaceable, yet had it often adminiſtred motives of diſcontent and jealouſy. IAMES the Fifth, King of Scots, Nephew to HENRY by his Siſter, having long liued a Bachelor, HENRY treated with him concerning a marriage with his (then only) Childe the Lady MARY, a Match which probably would have vnited theſe neighbour Kingdomes. But God had reſerved this Vnion for a more happy time.
                     
                        War with Scotland.
                         The antient League betweene France and Scotland had alwaies made the Scots affected to the French, and IAMES prefer the alliance with France, before that of England, where the Dowry was no leſſe than the hopes of a Kingdome. So he marrieth with MAGDALEN a Daughter of France; who not long ſurviving, hee againe matcheth there with MARY of Guiſe,
                        
Widow to the Duke of Longueville. HENRY had yet a deſire to ſee his Nephew, to which end he deſired an enterview at Yorke or ſome other oportune place. IAMES would not condiſcend to this, who could notwithſtanding vndertake a long and dangerous voyage into France, without invitation. Theſe were the firſt ſeeds of diſcord, which after bladed to the Scots deſtruction. There having been for two yeares neither certaine peace, nor a iuſt War, yet incurſions from each ſide; Forces are aſſigned to the Duke of Norfolke to repreſſe the inſolency of the Scots, and ſecure the Marches. The Scot vpon newes of our being in Armes, ſends to expoſtulate with the Duke of Norfolke, concerning the motives of this war, and withall diſpatcheth the Lord GORDON with ſome ſmall Forces to defend the Frontiers. The Herauld is detained vntill our Army came to Berwick, that hee might not give intelligence of our ſtrength. And in October the Duke entring Scotland, continued there ranſacking the Countrey without any oppoſition of the Enemy vntill the middle of November. By which time King IAMES having levied a great Army, reſolved on a battaile, the Nobility perſuading the contrary, eſpecially vnwilling that hee ſhould any way hazard his Perſon, the loſſe of his Father in the like manner being yet freſh in memory, and Scotland too ſenſible of the calamities that enſued it. The King proving obſtinate, they detaine him by force, deſirous rather to hazard his diſpleaſure, than his life. This tenderneſſe of him, in the language of rage and indignation hee termes cowardiſe and treachery, threatening to ſet on the Enemy aſſiſted with his Family only.
                     The Lord MAXWELL ſeeking to allay him,

 promiſed with ten thouſand only to invade England, and with far leſſe then the Engliſh Forces to divert the war. The King ſeemes to conſent: But offended with the reſt of the Nobility, he gives the Lord OLIVER SAINTCLARE a private Commiſſion not to be opened vntill they were ready to give the on
                           •
                        et, wherein hee makes him Generall of the Army. Having in England diſcovered five hundred Engliſh horſe led by Sir THOMAS WHARTON and Sir WILLIAM MVS GRAVE, the Lord SAINTCLARE commanded his Commiſſion publiquely to be read, the recitall whereof ſo diſtaſted the Lord MAXWELL and the whole Army, that all things were in a confuſion, and they ready to disband.
                     
                        The Scots overthrowne. The oportunity of an adioining hill gave vs a full proſpect into their Army, and invited vs to make vſe of our advantages: Wee charge them furiouſly, the Scots amazedly fly, many are ſlaine, many taken, more plunged in the neighbouring fens, and taken by Scotiſh Freebooters ſold to vs. Among the Captives were the Earles of Glencarne and Caſſells, the Lords SAINTCLARE, MAXWELL Admirall of Scotland, FLEMING, SOMERWELL, OLIPHANT, and GRAY, beſides two hundred of the better ſort, and eighthundred common ſouldiers. The conſideration of this overthrow occaſioned (as hee conceived) by the froward raſhneſſe of his owne Subiects; and the death of an Engliſh Herauld ſlaine in Scotland, ſo ſurcharged him with rage and griefe, that hee fell ſicke of a Fever,The death of Iames the Fift, King of Scotland.
                         and died in the three and thirtieth yeare of his age, and two and thirtieth of his raigne, leaving his Kingdome to the vuſally vnhappy governement of a Woman, a Childe ſcarce eight

dayes old. The chiefe of the captives being conveied to the Tower were two dayes after brought before the King's Counſaile, where the Lord Chancellour reprehended their treachery, who without due denunciation of war▪ invaded and ſpoiled the territories of their Allies, and committed many outrages, which might excuſe any ſevere courſes, which might in iuſtice be taken with them: Yet his Maieſty out of his naturall Clemency was pleaſed to deale with them beyond their deſerts, by freeing them from the irkeſomeneſſe of a ſtrict impriſonment, and diſpoſing of them among the Nobles, to beby them entertained, vntill He ſhould otherwiſe determine of them.
                     By this time King IAMES his death had poſſeſſed HENRY with new hopes of vniting Britaine vnder one Head. England had a Prince, and Scotland aHopes of a match betwe

Yet this ſeeming a courſe intended by the Divine Providence to extirpate all cauſes of enmity and diſcord betweene theſe neighbouring Nations, a marriage betweene theſe young Princes is propoſed. With what alacrity and applaufe the propoſition was on both ſides entertained, wee may conceive, who have had the happineſſe to ſee that effected, which they but intended. Which being a matter of ſo ſweet a conſequence, it is to be wondred at, that the conſpiracy of a few factious ſpirits ſhould ſo eaſily hinder it. The hope of it prevailed with the King for the liberty of the Captives, conditionally, that they ſhould leave hoſtages for their returne, if peace were not ſhortly concluded; which, as alſo the furtherance of this ſo wiſhed coniunction, they faithfully promiſed.

Fifteene yeares had hee and his brother GEORGE lived exiles in England, HENRY out of his Royall Bounty allowing to the Earle a penſion of a thouſand markes, and to his brother of five hundred. The ſudaine returne of theſe captive Lords cauſed in moſt as ſudaine a ioy. Only the Cardinall of Saint ANDREWS (who had by forgery made himſelfe Regent) and his faction could willingly have brooked their abſence. They came not as freed from a Captivity, but as Embaſſadours for Peace by them erneſtly perſuaded, which by the happy coniunction of theſe Princes might be concluded to perpetuitie. But the Cardinall with his factious Clergy, the Queene Dowager, and as many as were affected to the Flower de Lys interpoſed themſelves for the good of France. Yet notwithſtanding the Cardinals fraud being detected, hee is not only depoſed from his Regency, and IAMES HAMILTON Earle of Arren ſubſtituted, but alſo committed to cuſtody, whence afterwards making an eſcape hee was the authour of more garboiles.

                        An expedition into Scotland.
                         The Viſcount Liſle Admirall of England, with a Navy of two hundred ſaile entred the Forth of Scotland, landed ten thouſand men, forced the rich towne of Leith, and then marched toward Edenburg the Metropolis of the Kingdome. The Regent was there with the Cardinall (at whoſe diſpoſe hee now wholy was) and many other Nobles, guarded with ſix thouſand horſe and a great number of foote, who vpon ſight of an invading Army betooke themſelves to flight, and left the City voide of defendants. The Provoſt craving parley, offred to yeild the city vpon condition of departure with Bag and Baggage, and ſaving the towne from fire. But the breach of League, and

 inſolencies of the inhabitants of Leith and Edenburg had inſpired vs with revenge, ſo that no Conditions were to be admitted, but what the Victor ſhould impoſe. This drives the Provoſt to a deſperate reſolution of defence. The Engliſh give a furious aſſault, enter at the Canygate, put the inhabitants to the ſword, pillage and fire it. The like calamitie felt the Country round about, fire and ſword cruelly feeding vpon Villages, Caſtles, and Noblemens houſes. Leith had hitherto beene reprived from the like miſery; but at our returne to the Navy, it is made its owne funerall pile, and the Peere of the haven vtterly conſumed.
                     New imployments call home our Admirall. HENRY reſolves once more to tranſport his Armes into France, there to ioyne with the Earles of Reux and Bares Imperiall Commanders. It was agreed betweene the Emperour and the King, that the one ſhould invade Champaigne, the other Picardy, and having vnited their forces (which ſhould amount to foureſcore thouſand foote, and eighteene thouſand horſe) to march directly to Paris, thereby either to force the French to fight with diſadvantage, or to ſuffer the ruine of his Countrey. HENRY lands at Calais, and finds Picardy vnfurniſhed of men, FRANCIS having withdrawne his forces towards Champaigne to oppoſe them againſt the Emperour. Hee therefore ſends the Duke of Norfolke with the Earles of Reux and Bures to beſeege Montrueil. The Marſhall of Biez ſeeing which way we turned the point of our Army, being commanded by his King to have an eſpeciall care of that Territory, puts himſelfe into Montrueil, and left the Lord of Vervein his ſonne in law, a man of ſmall experience, to command in Bouloigne. This oportunity invites HENRY to incampe before Boloigne a towne neere to Calais, and many wayes commodious. Hee cauſeth the Duke of

                              •
                           il; and omitting his intended voyage to Paris (fruſtrated by the Emperours peace with the French, to enter into which HENRY was invited by the Cardinall BELLAY, RAYMOND Preſident of Rouen, and AVBESPINE Secretary of Eſtate, ſent of purpoſe) hee inveſteth Boloigne. The Duke of Suffolke had firſt encamped vpon a hill on the Eaſt of Boloigne, from whence hee after made his approches into the valley: And the King encamping on the North, ſhutvp the towne on all ſides. The firſt aſſault is given on the Suburbs or Baſe Towne, which the French vnder the covert of a made ſmoke had forſaken. They pretend it to have beene purpoſely fired as vnprofitable, and the fire quenched by our induſtry. Next the Tower of the Ordre (called by vs the Old man) defended by twenty Souldiers is yeilded, and the Towne continually battered in foure places, whereof the moſt forcible was the battery from the hill on the Eaſt ſide, which beat downe the ſteeple of our Ladies Church, rent the houſes, and ſcowred the ſtreets of the Towne. The breach made by the Canon being not ſufficient, they fall to mining, which happily ſucceeding, they blow vp a great part of the wall. We give a furious aſſault, and are repulſed with loſſe, yet did this aſſault carry the Towne, that brave Captaine PHILIP CORSE being ſlaine in it, whoſe valour alone had hitherto preſerved it. VERVEIN vpon the loſſe of this man, at his wits end, ſounds the intention of the King, and yeilds him the Towne vpon compoſition: That the Souldiers and Citizens might depart with their Baggage; and that all the Artillery, Munition, and Ʋictuals (whereof there was great ſtore) ſhould remaine to the King. The inhabitants refuſe this bad compoſition, and the Mayor with the Towneſmen offer to keepe the Towne: which had they accordingly vndertaken, Boloigne in all probabilitie had

 continued French. For the Capitulation was no fooner concluded (hoſtages not yet given) but a horrible tempeſt of winde and raine overthrowes our Tents, and the ſoile being fat and ſlippery, wee ſhould not have had any meanes to mount to an aſſault. Moreover the Daulphin was on march with great forces for their ſuccour, whoſe approach would have forced HENRY to have changed his deſigne. But VERVEIN profeſſing that hee would keepe touch even with his Enemy, continued conſtant in his promiſe, for which he ſoone loſt his head on a ſcaffold at Paris. The foure and twentieth of September, the City was delivered to the Duke of Suffolke, and the French departed to the number of threeſcore and ſeven horſe, a thouſand five hundred threeſcore and three able foot, and a thouſand nine hundred, twentie and ſeven women and children, many of the infirmer ſort not able to depart, ſtaying behinde. The next day the King entred triumphantly, and cauſed our Ladies Church to be demoliſhed, and in place thereof a Fortification to be raiſed, and having ordered his affaires to his minde, making the Viſcount Liſle Governour, ſet ſaile for Dover, where hee arrived on the firſt of October.
                     
                     But the King's haſty departure permitted not all things to be ſufficiently ſetled. Part of the Artillery, Victuals and Munition by the Capitulation left in Boloigne, were not removed from the Baſe Towne, which was fortified only with ſome ſmall trenches: for the ſurpriſall whereof, the Daulphin in the night ſends ſome troupes, who before morning enter the place, cut all in pieces they meet, win the Artillery and Munition▪ and thinke to have gotten an abſolute victory: but being intent to pillage, ſome Enſignes iſſue from the higher Towne, finde them in diſorder, ſet vpon them and rout them. Many of the Enemies

were ſlaine, among whom was FOVQYESSOLLES, another ſonne in law of BIEZ, the victory not being without bloud on our ſide.
                     Neither was our Fleete idle in the meane, which ſcowring the ſeas brought three hundred Priſes ſo fraught with Merchandiſe, that the three ſpatious Churches of the Auguſtine, the Gray, and the Blacke Friers in London, whoſe Monaſteries had lately beene ſuppreſſed, were ſtored withnothing but hogſheads of wine.
                     The Earle of Lenox lately diſpatched out of France for the managing of the affaires of Scotland, to the behoofe of the French found not entertainment there according to his expectation. The Queene Mother and Cardinall, as long as they had need of him, deluded him with hopes of marrying the Queene Mother, and by their ſecret calumnies rendred him ſuſpected to the French. At length finding his ſafety queſtionable, he flies for refuge into England, accompanied with ALEXANDER ſonne and heire to the Earle of Glencarne, WALTER GRAHAM brother to the Earle of Montroſſe, and Sir IOHN BORTHWICKE with others, and were honourably received by HENRY, who moſt happily repaired the Earles loſſes of revenues in France fallen by the death of ROBERT STVART of Aubigny, and of his marriage in Scotland, with that moſt ſucceſſefull Match with that beautifull Lady MARGARET Neipce to the King, and Daughter to the Earle of Angus, and an annuall penſion of ſeven hundred markes. And once more he reſolved to try his fortune in Scotland attended by Sir RICE MANSELL, and Sir PETER NEWTAS, WINTOR, AVDLEY, and BROOKES with others, who with eight ſhips ſet ſai

The Commiſſioners begin firſt with the Citizens of London, among whom two were more ſtraight laced then the reſt, viz. RICHARD READ and WILLIAM ROCH: but their parſimony ſhall coſt them deare. For READ being an old man and vtterly vnexpert of Martiall Diſcipline is commanded to ſerve in perſon in the wars of Scotland, is taken by the Scots, and forced to ranſon himſelfe at a high rate. ROCH, as having vſed ſome vncivill language before thoſe of his Maieſties Counſaile who ſate Commiſſioners, was for ſome moneths puniſhed with ſtraight impriſonment, and at length (not improbably) bought his libertie.
                     In the meane time Boloigne was a great eyeſore to the French. They try to regaine it by ſtratagems and ſurpriſals, but in vaine. They betake themſelves to force with the like ſucceſſe. The Marſhall of Biez Governour of Boloignois comes with a great Army to the Port, a Towne two miles from Boloigne, and begins to build a Fort on this ſide the river vpon the point of the Tower of Ordre, but is by the Earle of Hertford forced away, and leaves his Caſtle in the Aire. His intent was by this Fort to have kept the garriſon of Boloigne within their wals, to have commanded the haven, ſo to cut off all ſuccours by ſea, and from Calais by land. Which being done, FRANCIS reſolved in Perſon to beſiege Guiſnes, and there to

 fortifie, thereby to famiſh Boloigne, and to keepe Calais and the land of Oye in ſubiection. But theſe deſignes proving fruitleſſe, he prepares his navall forces, giving forth, that he intended to invade England, hoping that this alarme would have made vs have a care of the maine, and neglect thoſe pieces abroad, ſo that Boloigne for lack of aide ſhould eaſily be reduced. The noiſe of an invaſion made HENRY arme, who having gathered together a ſufficient Fleet, awaited the Enemie at Portſmouth, intent to all occaſions. Neither did the French onely intend an alarme, landing in three ſeverall places in England, but were every where with loſſe driven aboard their ſhips. Two dayes after they fall downe to the Channell that divideth the Iſle of Wight from the reſt of Britaine; they ſeeme to threaten Portſmouth, where the King then was, and ſeeke to draw our Fleet to fight. The French, beſide a ſufficient Fleet of other ſhips had twenty five Gallies, no way probably vſefull in theſe

But our Fleet was not to be drawne to fight, much leſſe to bee forced without apparent danger to the Enemy, who muſt ſl

                        p downe a narrow Channell, where but few ſhips could go in front, and the like number oppoſed might eaſily defend it: where they could not enter, but with the tide and winde, and the firſt ſhips repulſed, in their falling backe would have diſordered the reſt of the Fleet: where of neceſſitie they muſt fight vnder the favour of our Forts and Cannon, which would eaſily have hindred their approach. The Enemy being put off heere, conſult of fortifying the Iſle of Wight, where at Saint Helens point they land two thouſand men, reſolve

forſooth to make that the ſeate of the warre, and there to build three Forts, but the valour of the inhabitants made them change their deſigne, and forced them againe to their ſhips. Thus every where affronted to their loſſe, without any memorable act they ſet ſaile for Normandie. The French Fleet conſiſted of a hundred and three ſaile of all ſorts, ours of only ſixtie, ſo that it was no way ſae for vs to incounter them. Some light proffers were made on both ſides, wherein we alwayes came of with the better. As for the Mary Roſe, a ſhip which with her loſſe buried Sir GEORGE CAROW the Captaine, and ſeven hundred men; the French do well to make vſe of caſualties to their owne glory: But it was not the valour of the French or fury of their Cannons that ſunke her, but the ſupine negligence of the Marinets, being wracked in the very haven in the preſence of the King.
                     
                        Boloigne was not idle the while. Vpon hope of a Fort to be built by the Marſhall of Biez, FRANCIS had made great preparations for an enterprize vpon Guiſnes. but was diverted by the death of the Duke of Orleans his younger Sonne, and the loſt hopes of his intended Fort neere Boloigne, and having for a while encamped at
                           Alias Bonlamberg. 
                        Mont-Lambert, retired at laſt toward Amiens. The neerneſſe of the Kings Campe at Mont-Lambert did daily invite both Nations to make triall of their valour, the Engliſh ſometimes, ſometimes the French having the better. One day among the reſt the Engliſh hotly charging the French, the Duke of Aumale comes to relieve them, who being ſtrooken with a Lance vnder his right eye, it breakes in pieces and leaves the tronchion halſe a foot within his head. It was a token of an excellent ſpirit in this young Nobleman, that for ſo rough a charge hee loſt not his ſtirrups, and endured the torture whereto they put him in drawing out the three ſquare head, with ſuch

 an invincible conſtancy, as if they had picked a thorne from out his finger, and beyond all expectation of the Chirurgians recovered. The victory remained to the Engliſh. Who could not long bragge of it, afterward ſeeking to cut off a Convoy of the Enemies defeated by the Ringrave with the loſſe of ſixteene Captaines, and ſeven or eight hundred men. The Earle of Surrey, who led them, ſaved himſelfe by flight. And were it not diſcourteſie in vs not to requite the late viſit of the French? The Lord Admirall therefore landed ſix thouſand men at Treport in Normandie, burned the Towne and Abbey with thirtie Ships and a Barke in in the Haven, and returned with the loſſe of only fourteene men.
                     Neither were our imployments leſſe or fewer in Scotland, then among the French. Scotland had ſo many enemies at home, that it needed not any abroad. But their homebred diſſentions had cauſed war from vs, and the way to ſet them at peace was, to invade them. In the beginning of March Sir RALPH EVERS, by the death of his Father Lord Evers, with an Army entred Scotland, making all the Countrey deſert about Iedbury and Kelſon. Thence marching to Coldingham fortified the Church and Tower, and leauing a Garriſon there, departed. The Garriſon partly out of couetouſneſſe, partly to diſtreſſe the Enemy if he ſhould lay ſiege to them, pillaged and waſted all the neighbouring Countrey. The Regent according to their expectation beſiegeth the Church with eight thouſand men, and batters it a whole day and a night. But ſudainly, making none of the Nobles partakers of his determinations, whether out of feare to be betraied by his Army, or ſome other cauſe, tooke horſe and paſſed away to Dunbar, which occaſioned the disbanding of the Army, and the freedome of the beſieged. Our often ſucceſſe hauing emboldened

vs, we adventure vpon another impreſſion, the fury whereof disburdened it ſelfe in Merch, T

                        bingers. The Scots at length make head and although of more then equall number, they betake themſelves to ſtratagems. They vnderſtand by their Scouts of our approach: and to deceive vs, by the adviſe of WALTER SCOT ſend their horſes to the adioyning hils. Neither indeed was the place ſo advantageous for Horſe as for Foot. The horſes backed by the Groomes that kept them, did from the hils make ſhew of an Army, and that flying. We advance, as loath to let our enemies eſcape, in the purſuit of whom we vnawares fall among the whole Army not diſorderly flying, but prepared to receive vs. It is not vnuſuall to encounter men: but if Heaven and the Elements oppoſe vs, how can we hope for victory? Wee finde the number of our adverſe Army great beyond our expectation, the Sun farre declining to the Weſt darted his rayes in our faces, and a violent winde drives the ſmoke of the ſhot into our mouthes, which not onely made the moſt neceſſary ſence vnuſefull, but with a foule ſtench corrupted the aire, and hindred the breathing of the already panting Souldiers. The many advantages give them the victory. Wee leave two hundred in the place, and among them the Lord EVERS; a thouſand are taken, whereof Alderman READ was one.
                     A little after this victory, FRANCIS ſent into Scotland a ſupply of five hundred French Horſe and three thouſand Footmen vnder the command of the Lord of Lorges Earle of Montgomery, not ſo much to croſſe our attempts againſt the Scots, as to diſtract our forces, that the violence of them vnited might not at once fall on France.

A happineſſe vnder this Prince rare even to Fortunes and His Favourites.
                     A Parliament aſſembled in November granted the King the Diſpoſall of all Colledges, Chantries, and Hoſpitals, the demeaſnes, ſalaries and ſtipends thereto belonging, or given to Prieſts to ſay Maſſe for the ſoules of the departed. The King perſonally gave thankes to both Houſes, promiſing to have a care that they ſhould be imployed to the honour of God and the publique good. But we finde not the effect of his promiſes.

                     WE are now come to the laſt yeare of HENRY his Raigne. Who having tired himſelfe with the French wars, began at length ſeriouſly to bethinke himſelfe of peace. Neither was FRANCIS leſſe deſirous of his friendſhip. To this end Deputies from both ſides meet often betweene Guiſnes and Ardres: For HENRY, the Earle of Hertford, GARDINER Biſhop of Wincheſter, the Viſcount Liſle Lord Admirall, Sir WILLIAM PAGET Secretary of Eſtate, and Doctour WOTTON the firſt Deane of Canterbury: For FRANCIS, the Admirall ANNEBAVLT, RAYMOND firſt Preſident of

                        Rouan, and BOVCHEREL Secretary. After many conſultations a Peace was concluded on theſe Conditions:
                     That Francis within eight yeares ſhould pay foureſcore hundred thouſand Crownes to the King, as well for the arrerage of his Penſion, as for many other expenſes made by him in war, in the fortification of Boloigne and of the Countrey: and vpon receipt of the ſaid ſumme, Henry ſhould deliver vnto the King of France Boloigne and all the Countrey belonging to it, with the ancient places or newly edified by him, Mont-Lambert, the Tower of Ordre, Ambleteul and others, with all the Artillery and Munition in them.
                     For the confirmation whereof, the Viſcount Liſle was ſent Embaſſadour into France, and from thence came the Admirall ANNEBAVLT to receive the oathes of each King, and the Peace was proclaimed in London.
                     
                     On the ſixteenth of Iuly were burnt at London for their Religion IOHN LASSELS, NICHOLAS OTTERDEN, IOHN ADLAM, and ANNE ASSKEW, a young Gentlewoman aged twentie five, of an ancient Deſcent, excellent beauty, and acute wit, whoſe examinations, writings, tortures, and patient ſuffering are at large ſet downe by Maſter FOX, being before their execution by Doctour SCHAXTON exhorted to recant, as he then was forced, who ſome yeares paſſed had reſigned his Biſhopricke to enioy his Conſcience.
                     And here I may not omit an addition to the ſeptenary

 number of Sleepers WILLIAM FOXLEY a Potmaker in London, who without any touch of any preceding infirmity was ſeiſed with ſuch a dead ſleepe, that for fourteene daies and fifteene nights no force nor invention could awake him; on the fifteenth day this miraculous ſleepe forſaking him, he was as it were reſtored to life, and found as ſound and entire as if he had taken no more then an ordinary repoſe: Neither would he believe that he had taken other, but that the building of a certaine wall made it apparant to him how much time he had ſlept away. Hee lived above forty yeares after, viz. to the yeare 1587.
                     Let vs conclude this yeare with the death of MARTIN LVTHER that famous impugner of the Church of Rome, who being ſent for by the Counts of MANSFEILD to compoſe ſome differences betweene them concerning their inheritance, died among them in his Climactericall yeare, and after much contention for his body, lieth buried at Wirtenberg.
                     
                  
                  
                     Anno Dom. 1547.
                     
                     HENRY long ſince growne corpulent was become a burthen to himſelfe, and of late lame by reaſon of a violent vleer in his leg, the inflammation whereof caſt him into a lingering fever, which by little and little decaying his ſpirits, hee at length began to feele the inevitable neceſſity of death. The cogitation of many things (as in the like exigents vſually happeneth) oppreſſed him, and chiefly of his Sonnes nonage, but now entring into his tenth yeare, an age infirme and oportune to treacheries, againſt which he found ſmall proviſion in his friends, having

none amongſt thoſe on whoſe loyalty hee chiefly relied, of ſo ſufficient eminency, as to vnderprop his weake Eſtate with thoſe ſupporters of Royalty, Power and Authoritie. His Brother in law the Duke of Suffolke was lately deceaſed: SEIMOVR the yong Princes Vnkle was a man whoſe Goodneſſe was not tempered with Severity, and being deſcended of a Family more ancient then noble (as having vntill now never tranſcended Knighthood) would be ſubiect to contempt. They who more neerly participated of the Bloud Royall, as they any way excelled in Power or Vertue, were the more ſuſpected and hated by him. The Family of the HOWARDS was then moſt flouriſhing, the chiefe whereof was THOMAS Duke of Norfolke, a man famous for his exploits in France, Scotland, and elſewhere, long exerciſed in the ſchoole of Experience, many wayes deriving himſelfe from the Crowne, popular, of great command and revenues. But the edge of the old mans diſpoſition made milde and blunted with age, adminiſtred the leſſe cauſe of ſuſpition. Of his eldeſt Sonne HENRY Earle of Surrey, the King was certainly iealous, and reſolved to cut him off. Hee had lately in the wars of France manifeſted himſelfe heire to the glory of his Anceſtors, was of a ripe wit, and endued with great learning, ſo that Elogy afterwards given to his ſonne HENRY, that hee was the Learnedſt among the Nobility, and the Noblest among the Learned, might have as fitly beene applied to him, was very gracious with the people, expert in the Art Military, and eſteemed fit for publique Government. Theſe great Vertues were too great Faults, and for them hee muſt ſuffer. Treaſon is obiected to him, and vpon the ſurmiſe hee and his Father ſent to the Tower. On the thirteenth of Ianuary he is arraigned, the chiefe point of his accuſation whereon they inſiſted being, for bearing

 certaine Armes, which only belonged to the King, and conſequently aſpiring to the Crowne. Of other things hee eaſily acquitted himſelfe, and as for thoſe Armes, he conſtantly affirmed that they hereditarily pertained vnto him: yet notwithſtanding hee would not have preſumed to have borne them, but being warranted by the opinion of the Heralds, who onely were to give iudgement in theſe caſes. The Iudges not approving of his anſwer condemne him, and ſo the Flower of the Engliſh Nobilitie is on the nineteenth of Ianuary beheaded, the King lying in extremity, and breathing his laſt in Bloud. The Duke was adiudged to perpetuall impriſonment, where he continued vntill he was by Queene MARY ſet at libertie.
                     The King, his diſeaſe growing on him, at laſt makes his Will, wherein (by vertue of a Law lately enacted) hee ordaines Prince EDWARD his Suceſſour in the firſt place, and in the ſecond (Prince EDWARD dying iſſ
                           •
                        leſſe) ſubſtitutes the Lady MARY begotten of CATHARINE of Arragon, and vpon the like defect of iſſue in MARY in the third place ſubſtitutes the Lady ELIZABETH. Theſe three raigned ſucceſſiuely, and accompliſhed the number of fiftie ſix yeares, at the expiration where of Queene ELIZABETH ended her long glorious Raine, and left the Diadem to King IAMES, in the many reguards of his Learning, Religion, Goodneſſe, peaceable and happy Raigne the Mirrour of late ages.

For therein HENRY is ſtiled Lord of Irland without any mention of Supreme Head of the Church, which two particles it is manifeſt were changed in the Title after WOLSEY his death. In the ſame his laſt Will he commanded that the Monuments of HENRY the Sixt, and EDWARD the Fourth (both interred in Windſore) ſhould be made more magnificent and ſtately, and other things of le

                         moment, moſt of which were neglected. This laſt Will aud Teſtament hee confirmed, ſubſcribed, and ſealed the laſt of December, and ſurvived a moneth after, dying at Weſtminſter the eight and twentieth of Ianuary, and that in this manner: The King having long languiſhed, the Phyſicians finding apparant ſymptomes of approaching death, wiſhed ſome of his friends to admoniſh him of his eſtate, which at laſt Sir ANTHONY DENNY vndertooke, who going directly to the fainting King, told in few (but thoſe plaine) words, That the hope of humane helpe was vaine, wherefore he beſeeched his Maieſtie to erect his thoughts to Heaven, and bethinking him of his forepaſſed life, through Chriſt to implore Gods Mercy. An adviſe not very acceptable to him. But finding it grounded vpon the iudgement of the Phyſicians, hee ſubmitted himſelfe to the hard law of neceſſitie, and reflecting vpon the courſe of

his Life (which hee much condemned) he profeſſed himſelfe confident, that through Chriſt his infinite Goodneſſe all his ſinnes, although they had beene more in number and waight, might bee pardoned. Being then demanded whether he deſired to confer with any Divines; With no other (ſaith he) but the Archbiſhop CRANMER, and not with him as yet; I will firſt repoſe my ſelfe a little, and as I then finde my ſelfe will determine accordingly. After the ſleepe of an houre or two finding himſelfe fainting, hee commanded the Archbiſhop (then at Croydon) ſhould be ſent for in all haſt. Who vſing all poſſible ſpeed came not vntill the King was ſpeechleſſe. As ſoone as he came, the King tooke him by the hand, the Archbiſhop exhorting him to place all his hope in Gods Mercies through Chriſt, and beſeeching him, that if hee could not in words, he would by ſome ſigne or other teſtifie this his Hope: Who then wringed the Archbiſhops hand as hard as he could, and ſhortly after expired, having lived fiftie five yeares and ſeven moneths, and thereof raigned thirty ſeven yeares nine monethes and ſix dayes.
                     Thus ended HENRY the Eighth his Life and Raigne, which for the firſt yeares of his Government was like NERO'S Five yeares, Admirable: for often Victories and happy Succeſſe in war, Glorious: for the many Changes vnder it, Memorable: For the Foundation of the Churches Reformation, Laudable: to Queenes, moſt vnhappy: for the Death of ſo many (for the moſt) great Perſonages, Bloudy: and for the frequent Exactions and Subſidies, and Sacrilegious Spoile of the Church, much Preiudiciall to the Eſtate, Grievous and Burthenſome to the Subiect.

The next day the Counſaile aſſembled for the managing of the Eſtate, conferred on the Kings Vnckle, EDWARD SEIMOVR Earle of Hertford the honour and power of Protector of the King's Perſon and Kingdome. Who to ſeaſon his new Dignitie with ſome memorable act, on the ſixt of February, dubbed the King Knight, the King preſently imparting the ſame Honour to RICHARD HOBLETHORNE Lord Maior of London.
                     
                     
                        King Henry's Funerals. On the fifteenth of February King HENRY his Funerals were ſolemnized, and his Body Royally interred in the middle of the Quire in the Church at Windſore.
                     
                     Two daies after were ſome of the Nobilitie dignified with greater Honours, ſome new created. The Lord Protector Earle of Hertford, was made Duke of Somerſet: WILLIAM PARR Earle of Eſſex, Marquis of Northampton: IOHN DVDLEY Viſcount Liſle, Earle of Warmicke: and the Lord Chancellour WRIOTHSLEY, Earle of Southampton. Sir THOMAS SEIMOVR brother to the Protector and Lord Admirall, Sir THOMAS RICH, Sir WILLIAMThe Coronation. WILLOVGHBY, and Sir EDMOND SHEFFEILD were inrolled among the Barons. Other two daies being fled after their Predeceſſours, the King paſſed triumphantly from the Tower through London to Weſtminster, where he was ſolemnely crowned, anointed, and inaugurated by CRANMER Archbiſhop of Canterbury. At what time alſo with incredible indulgence pardon of all crimes whatſoever was publiquely proclaimed and granted to all perſons throughout the Realme, ſix only being exempted from the benefit thereof, namely, the Duke of Norfolke, Cardinall POOLE, the lately beheaded

Marquis of Exceſter his eldeſt Sonne, one THROCMORTON, FORTESCVE, and RICHARD PATE late Biſhop of Worceſter, who leaſt hee ſhould be conſtrained to acknowledge the King Head of the Church, had ſome yeares paſſed fled to Rome.
                     
                     
                        The death of Francis King of France.
                         On the nineteenth of Iune in the Cathedrall Church of Saint PAVL in London were celebrated the Exequies of FRANCIS King of France. He deceaſed the two and twentieth of the precedent March, having beene after the death of our HENRY much diſpoſed to melancholy, whether for that hee failed in the hope of ſtrengthening their late contracted amity with ſome ſtricter tie: or that being ſome few yeares the younger, hee was by his death admoniſhed of the like approaching fate. They were alſo of ſo conſpiring a ſimilitude of diſpoſition and nature, that you ſhall hardly finde the like betweene any two Princes of what ever different times. This bred a mutuall affection in them, and as it were forcibly nouriſhed the ſecret fire thereof betweene them, vnleſſe peradventure when emulation or the reſpect of publique vtilitie ſwaied them the contrary way, ſo that the death of the one could not but much grieve the ſurviver. He therefore in the Cathedrall at Paris celebrated the Funerals of HENRY, though excommunicated by the Pope. He alſo left one only Sonne named HENRY inheritor of his Crowne, whoſe Raigne laſted but to the beginning of Queene ELIZABETH.
                     And now the affaires of Scotland, which have without doubt beene great and memorable, crave a part in our Hiſtory. Wee have before made mention of our League with Scotland, wherein it was determined concerning the marriage betweene the now King EDWARD and the Queene of Scots. The times ſince then were full of continuall iarres. Wee at length reſolved

 not to dally with them, but to vndertake the war with forces agreeable to the cauſe. The Duke of Somerſet by conſent of the Privie Counſaile is ſent into Scotland with ten thouſand Foot and ſix thouſand Horſe (beſide pioners and artificers thirteene hundred) and fifteene peeces of braſſe Ordnance. To the Lord CLINTON is aſſigned a Navy conſiſting of foure and twenty men of war, one Galley, and thirty Ships of burthen, wherewith hee was to ſcowre the Seas, and infeſt the maritime parts of Scotland. On the third of September the Duke of Somerſet made an hoſtile entrance vpon the Enemies Countrey, and forthwith diſpatched letters to the Earle of Arren, Regent of Scotland, much to this effect: That he wiſhed the Scots would conſider, that this war was waged among Christians, &amp; that our ends were no other then a iuſt Peace, whereto the endevours of all good men ſhould tend. An occaſion not only of a League, but of a perpetuall Peace was now happily offred, if they would ſuffer the two differing and emulous Nations by vniting the Head to grow together. This as it had beene formerly ſought by vs, ſo had it beene generally aſſented to by the Eſtates of Scotland. Therefore he could not but wonder why they ſhould rather treacherouſly recurre to Armes (the events of war being vſually even to the Ʋictor ſufficiently vnfortunate) then maintaine in violate their troth plighted to the good of both Nations. They could not in reaſon expect that their Queene ſhould perpetually live a Virgin life. And if ſhee married, where could ſhee beſtow her ſelfe better, then on a puiſſant Monarch inhabiting the ſame Iſland, and parlying the ſame language? They ſaw what inconveniences were the conſequents of foraine matches, whereof they ſhould rather make triall by the examples of others, then at their owne perill. He demanded nothing but equity; yet he ſo much abhorred the effuſion of Chriſtian bloud, that if hee found the Scots not vtterly averſe from an accord, hee would endevour that
                        
                        ſome of the Conventions ſhould be remitted: he would alſo permit that the Queene ſhould abide and be brought vp among them vntill her age made her marriageable, at what time ſhe ſhould by conſent of the Estates her ſelfe make choice of a Husband. In the meane time there ſhould be a Ceſſation of Armes, neither ſhould the Queene be tranſported out of her Realme, nor entertaine treatiſe of marriage with the French or any other forainer. This if they would faithfully promiſe, he would forthwith peaceably depart out of Scotland; and whatſoever damages the Countrey had ſuffred by this invaſion, he would according to the esteeme of indifferent Arbitrators make ample ſatisfaction. The Scottiſh Army conſiſted of thirty thouſand Foot, ſome ſpeake a greater number. The chiefe Commanders whereof puffed vp with confidence of their ſtrength (although they had lately loſt eight hundred in a tumultuary skirmiſh) and miſconceiving our offers to proceed out of feare, reiect all Conditions of Accord: and leaſt vpon knowledge of the equitie of our demands, the Counſaile ſhould encline to reſolutions of peace, they conceale our letters▪ And not only ſo, but vpon aſſurance of victory ſpred a rumor, that nothing would content the inſolent Engliſh, but the delivery of the Queene, which if they could not otherwiſe, they would by force obtaine, and proceed to the abſolute conqueſt of the Kingdome. This report inraged the Souldiers, whom no motives could diſuade from preſent ingaging themſelves in battaile. The wiſer ſort were not ignorant of the neceſſities that long ſince began to preſſe vs, who were brought to that paſſe, that by reaſon of the difficulties of paſſages we could not make a ſafe retreat, nor force the Enemie to fight in reguard of the ſtrength of the place where he was incamped. But the vaine hope of victorie had poſſeſſed the mindes of the greater part, and excluded reaſon. Neceſſitie forced vs to a reſolution brave Muſſelburgh Feild
                        
                        
 and expedient, which was, to ſeeke the Enemy in his lodging, and endevour to draw him to combat. But the hot-ſpurre Scots iſſuing from out their faſtneſſes, ſeemed willing to prevent vs. So both Armies entertaine a mutuall reſolution. A little before the ioyning of the Armies an accident happened, which did not a little make way to our victory. The Enemy marching along neere the ſea ſhore, a piece of Ordnance diſcharged from out Gally tooke away five and twentie of their men, whereof the eldeſt ſonne of the Lord GRIMES was one. Foure thouſand Archers terrified with ſo vnexpected a ſlaughter made aſtand▪ &amp; could never after be brought on. The two armies approching each other, the Duke of Somerſet commanded the Lord GRAY with the Cavallery to charge the Scots▪
                         and finde them imployment vntill the Infantery had ſeized on an adioyning hill, and if he
                           •
                         could without much hazard, to diſorder the Enemy. But they were gallantly received by a ſtrong Squadron of Pikes, whereon ſome of the formoſt having too far ingaged themſelues were caſt away, the reſt retreated affirming, that it was as caſie to force a wall, as through the Scottiſh rankes. The Duke makes a ſecond triall by the light Horſe ſeconding them with the Ordnance and the Archers. The Enemy either not able to ſtand ſo violent a charge, or (as ſome relate) to draw vs from the favour of our Canon, begins to giue ground, which we perceiving give a ſhout, crying out withall, They fly, they fly; which ſo amazed them, that ſome began to fly indeed, and at length the whole Army was routed. The Scots complaine, that we tyrannized over the Captives, eſpecially the Prieſts and Friers (whereof many ſerved in this Feild) becauſe by their inſtigation chiefly our Conditions were ſo arrogantly reiected. Of the Enemies were ſlaine thirteene thouſand, and among them (beſide the Earle of

                        Lohemor and the Lord FLEMING, the chiefe of the Scottiſh Gentry, with their Tenants, who thought it a diſgrace to ſurvive their Lords. In the chaſe were taken fifteene hundred, among whome were the Earle HVNTLEY Chancellour of Scotland, the Lords HESTER, HOBBEY, and HAMILTON, beſide many other perſons of Quality. This lamentable overthrow was given the tenth of September.
                     
                     The Engliſh become Victors beyond their expectation, ranſacked the Countrey five miles about, fortified in the Forth the forſaken Iſlands Keth and Haymon, tooke Brocth Caſtle, by their terrour forced the Garriſons of Humes and Faſtcaſtle to yeeld, and having built a Fort at Lauder, and repaired the ruines of Roxburgh, by their departure recreated the deiected mindes of the diſtreſſed Scots.
                     
                     
                        Reformation in the Church. Our affaires thus ſucceeding abroad, the Church at home had her changes. Many of the Counſaile, but eſpecially the Protector, much endeavoured Reformation in point of Religion. The reſt, who were addicted to the Doctrine of Rome, could for private reſpects temporize, fearing indeed reſtitution of Church goods (wherein each of them ſhared) vnles an irreconcileable breach were made with that Sea. So that whiles ſome eagerly oppoſe Popery, and others coldly defend it, not onely what had beene enacted by HENRY the Eighth concerning the abrogation of the Popes authority is confirmed, but many other things are added, whereby our Church was ſo purged from the dregs of Superſtition, that for Purity of Doctrine, and Inſtitution of ſelect Eccleſiaſticall Rites, it excelled the moſt Reformed Churches of Germany. All Images are pulled downe, Prieſts are permitted to marry, the Liturgy ſet forth in the Engliſh Tongue, the Euchariſt adminiſtred,

 vnder both kindes, Auricular-Confeſsion forbidden, no man prohibited the reading of the Scriptures, no Maſſes to be ſaid for the Soules of the departed, and many other things ordained, ſo far differing from the Inſtitution of our Forefathers, that it adminiſtred matter to the common people (who are won
                           •
                         to judge not according to Reaſon, but Cuſtome) of breaking out into Rebellion. And it is ſomewhat remarkable, that the ſame day wherin the Images, wherof the Churches were diſpoſſeſſed, were publiquely burned at London, we obtained that memorable victory over the Scots at Muſſelburgh.
                     
                     This yeare at Archbiſhop CRANMER his invitation came into England PETER MARTYR a Florentine, MARTIN BVCER of Seleſtadt, and PAVLVS PHAGIVS borne in the Palatinate: who being very courteouſly received by the King and Nobles, having repoſed themſelves ſome while at Canterbury, were ſent, MARTYR to Oxford, BVCER and PHAGIVS to Cambridge, there publiquely to read Divinity: but PHAGIVS having ſcarce ſaluted the Vniverſity, deceaſed of a Quartane Ague the twelfe of November in the five and fortieth yeare of his age. Neither did BVCER long ſurvive him, who died at Cambridge the laſt of February 1551, being then threeſcore yeares old. MARTYR ſhortly after his comming to Oxford, maintained publiquely in the Schooles, and that with ſolid arguments, againſt TRESHAM and CHEDSEY Opponents, that the Popiſh Tranſubstantiation was but a meere fiction; which Diſputation he after publiſhed and inlarged.

                     THe Engliſh having this yeare fortified and put a ſtrong Garriſon into Hadinton a Towne ſeated in the moſt fertile ſoile of all Scotland, did from thence and Lauder make often inrodes vpon the bordering Countrey, burning and ſpoiling whatſoever might be vſefull to the Enemy, from whome they expected a ſiege. In the meane time had the French ſent ſix thouſand (ten thouſand ſay we) men into Scotland, wherof three thouſand were Lanſquenets led by the Reingrave. The Lord of Eſſé a man of tried valor, famous in the ſiege of Landrecy and other expeditions was chief of the Army. Theſe
                           The Scots &amp; French beſiege Hadinton. advēturers lāding at Dunbar, march ſpeedily for Hadinton, &amp; ioining with the Scottiſh Forces conſiſting of eight thouſand men, ſtraightly beſiege it. At the Abbey neere the Towne they call a Counſaile, treat of tranſporting the Queene into France, and marrying her to the Daulphin. They whome the reſpect of private ends had not corrupted and withdrawne from the care of the publique weale, obiected, That they ſhould ſo draw on them a perpetuall war from England, and betray themſelves to the ſlavery of the French: That the propoſitions made by the Engliſh were reaſonable, who offered a ten yeares Truce, and ſought not to intrap the Scot in any bands or preiudiciall compacts, their demands being none other then this, That if within the ten yeares either the King of England, or the Queene of Scots ſhould deceaſe, all things ſhould on each ſide remaine entire and in their former estate: Delay had often in the like caſes proved advantageous, wheras ſpeedy repentance commonly followeth precipitated haſte.
                        
 The Popiſh Faction (eſpecially the Clergy, to whom the amity of England was little pleaſing, in reguard of the differences in Religion) and ſome others oblieged to the French either in reſpect of received benefits or future profit, with might and maine interpoſed to the contrary, and chiefly the Regent, bought with a penſion of foure thouſand crownes and the Command of one hundred Lances. The French Faction prevailed for her tranſportation. The Fleet from Leith, where it harboured, ſetting ſaile as if for France, fetching a compaſſe round about Scotland, put in at D
                              •
                           nbritton, where they embarquedThe Queene of Scots tranſported into France.
                         the ſix yeare old Queene, attended by IAMES her baſe Brother, IOHN ARESKIN, and WILLIAM LEVISTON, who being put backe by contrary windes, and much diſtreſſed by tempeſt, arrived at length in Little Bretaigne, and from thence ſet forward to the Court of France, ſo eſcaping our Fleet which hovered about Calais to intercept them, if (as we were perſuaded they needs muſt) they croſſed thoſe neighbouring Straights. Hadinton in the meane time being ſtraightly beleaguered, Sir ROBERT BOWES and Sir THOMAS PALMER are with ſeven hundred Lances and ſix hundred light Horſe ſent to relieve it. BVCHANAN ſaieth there were but three hundred Horſe, the reſt Foote. Of what ſort ſoever they were, it is certaine that before they could reach Hadington, they were circumvented and ſlaine almoſt to a man. Yet did not the beſieged let fall their courages, but bravely defended themſelves, vntill FRANCIS Earle of Shrewsbury with an Army of twelve thouſand Engliſh and foure thouſand Lanſquenets diſaſſieged them, and forced the French to retreat. The Earle having ſupplied the

Towne with neceſſaries, and re-inforced the Garriſon, returned to Berwicke. What they could not by force, the Enemy hopes more eaſily to effect by a ſurpriſall. To this end D' Eſsé with ſome ſelect Bands arrives at Hadinton about the breake of day, where having killed the Centinells and taken an halfe moone before the Port, ſome ſeeke to force the gates, ſome invade our adioining Granaries. The noiſe and ſhouts of the aſſailants gives an alarme to the Garriſon, who give fire to a Canon planted before the Port, the bullet whereof penetrating the gate, makes way through the cloſe ranks of the Enemies, and ſo affrights them, that they ſeeke to ſave themſelves by flight.
                     
                        Humes Caſtle
                         Fortune was not ſo favourable to the garriſons of Humes and Faſtcaſtle, where by the negligence of the Centinells, the deſignes of the Enemy were crowned with ſucces. At Humes, being conducted by ſome that knew all the ſecret paſſages, they climeand vp a ſteepe rocke, enter, maſſacre the ſecure Gariſon, and enioy the place. At Faſtcaſtle the Governor had
                           Faſteaſtle gained by the Enemy. commanded the neighbouring Husbandmen at a prefixed day to bring in their contribution of corne and other neceſſary proviſion. The Enemy makes vſe of this oportunity. Souldiers habited like Peaſants at the day come fraught with their burthens, wherof eaſing their horſes, they carry them on their ſhoulders over the bridge, which ioined two rockes together, and ſo gaine entrance: the watch-word being given, they caſt downe their burthens, kill the Centinells, open the gates to their fellowes, and become maſters of the place. Neither were our navall enterpriſes fortunate, being at Saint Minian and Merne repelled with loſſe.
                     In Autumne the Earle of Rutland with three

 thouſand Lanſquenets and ſome bands drawne out of the frontier Garriſons arrives at Hadington. Who duly conſidering that this Towne could not be kept any longer without the exceſſive charges of iuſt Army, foraſmuch as the Countrey about being miſerably fo
                           •
                        raged, it could not be victualled without great difficulty and danger; raſed the walls, fired the houſes, brought away the Artillery, and finding no reſiſtance, returned in ſafety to Berwick. BVCHANAN refers it to the enſuing yeare, but I follow the record of our owne Hiſtorians.
                     
                        
                           Gardiner Biſhop of Wincheſter committed to the Tower. And having thus far ſpent the yeare abroad, I at length returne home, where I finde STEPHEN GARDINER Biſhop of Winchester in the Tower. He was a man very learned, and no leſſe ſubtle, adhering to the Popiſh Faction, yet ſo, as that hee would be content to accommodate himſelfe to the current of the times. King HENRY had emploied him in many Embaſſages, and that with ample authority, vnder whom he durſt not oppoſe the proceedings confirmed by enacted Lawes. And vnder EDWARD hee repreſſed himſelfe for a time, ſeemingly conſenting to the commenced Reformation. But his diſſimulation was at length manifeſtly diſcovered to the Privy Counſaile, who had commanded him in a Sermon at Pauls-Croſſe to ſignify his approbation of the preſent eſtate of the Church: which he accordingly did on the nine and twentieth of Iune, but ſo ambiguouſly and obſcurely, that he ſatisfied them not. And being expreſſely forbidden to ſpeake any thing concerning the Eucharist, he knowing that by the Lawes nothing was definitively determined in that point, did ſo eagerly aſſert that Papiſticall (I will not ſay Capernaiticall) Corporall and Reall Preſence of CHRIST in the

Sacrament, that he wonderfully offended the mindes of many, but eſpecially of the Lords of the Counſaile. Wherfore he was on the thirtieth of Iune committed, and obſtinately refuſing to acknowledge his errour, was two yeares after deprived of his Biſhopricke, andanddeprived. (as he was of a turbulent ſpirit) leaſt hee ſhould practiſe any thing againſt the Eſtate, detained nevertheleſſe in priſon vntill the death of EDWARD. In the meane time Archbiſhop CRANMER by writing oppugned that groſſe and carnall aſſertion of the Church of Rome concerning CHRISTS Preſence in the Sacrament: whom GARDINER ſecretly anſwered vnder the fictious name of M. Conſtantius.
                     
                     
                        
                           Boner Biſhop of London committed alſo. Neither did that Bloud-ſucker BONER Biſhop of London (who in Queene MARYES raigne ſo heated the Kingdome with the funerall piles of ſo many Saints) ſpeed any better then Winchester. For being likewiſe enioined to preach at the Croſſe, hee did it ſo coldly, omitting many of thoſe points wherof he was commanded to ſpeake, that hee was likewiſe committed, deprived of his Biſhopricke, and ſo lived vntill Queene MARY ſet them both at liberty. What the objections were againſt CVTBERT TONSTALL Biſhop of Dureſme, and GEORGE DAY Biſhop of Chicheſter, I do not finde, but that they ran the ſame fortune is manifeſt▪ They were both very learned Prelates, but eſpecially▪ TONSTALL, a milde man, and of moſt ſweet conditions, in reguard wherof I do not a little wonder that he was ſo hardly dealt with. But the drift of the puniſhments of ſuch men, who in HENRY'S time were accounted the chiefe Lights of our Church, I conceive to have beene, that the reſt of that Order might by their example be admoniſhed, without diſſimulation either to reſigne their Biſhoprickes to others that were thought more worthy, or be induced

 to conforme themſelves to the preſent Reformation of the Church, according to the preſcript of the Lawes in that behalfe lately enacted. And yet I would there were not ſufficient cauſe to ſuſpect, that this was but a made oportunity, the removall of theſe obſtacles making way for the invaſion of theſe widow Seas. For as ſoone as TONSTALL was exautorated, that rich Biſhopricke of Dureſme by Act of Parliament was wracked, the chiefe revenues and cuſtomes of it being incorporated to the Crowne, and and the reſt in deſpight of the Tenants ſo guelded, that at this day it ſcarce poſſeſleth the third part of it's antient revenues. Yet did Queene MARY ſeriouſly endeavour the reſtitution of thoſe religious portions: Queene ELIZABETH would hardly conſent that it ſhould loſe any of it's plumes, (yet ſome it did) and King IAMES hath lately enacted againſt the Alienation of Church lands, yea even to the Crowne, otherwiſe then vpon reſervation of a reaſonable Rent, and the returne of them to the Church after the expiration of three lives or one and twenty yeares. The hungry Courtier finding how good a thing the Church was, had now for ſome yeares become acquainted with it out of a zealous intēt to Prey: neither could the horridneſſe of her ſacred skeleton as yet ſo worke on him, as to divert his reſolutions, and compaſſionately to leave the Church to her religious poverty. Beſide, the infancy of the King in this incertaine ebbe and flow of Religion, made her oportune to all kinde of ſacriledge. So that we are deſervedly to thanke the Almighty Guardian of the Church, that theſe Locuſts have not quite devoured the maintenance of the Laborers in this Engliſh Vineyard. For we yet retaine that antient forme of government in the Primitive Church by Biſhops, who have for the moſt part wherwith to ſupport their honorable

Function, as likewiſe have other thoſe ſubordinate Prelats, Deans, Archdeacons, &amp; Canons of Cathedrall Churches: &amp; as for our Preachers of the more polite &amp; learned ſort, we thinke him little befriended by Fortune, who long liveth in expectation of a competent preferment. I would the reſidue of the Reformed Churches of Chriſten dome had not beene pared ſo neere the quicke by preciſe hands, that but ſome few of them might in this kinde be paralelled with ours.
                     
                        Diſcord betweene the Duke of Somerſet and his Brother the Lord Admirall. And now behold two Brothers acting their ſeverall Tragedies. Iealouſy, Envy, and Ambition infernall Furies, had armed them againſt each other, and the Pride of the Feminine Sex prepared them for the Liſts. A lamentable exigent, wherein the loſſe of his Adverſary muſt be the deſtruction of each; wherein the Kingdome muſt groane at the loſſe of one, both being in the Eſtate incompatible: wherin the King himſelfe muſt (as moſt ſuſpect he did) ſuffer, that he might not ſuffer. THOMAS SEIMOVR Lord Admirall had married CATHARINE PARR the Widow of the deceaſed King. What correſpondence there might be betweene Her (who had beene the Wife of the late Soveraigne) and the Ducheſſe of Somerſet, whoſe Husband being Protector of the Realme, in point of command little differed from a Soveraigne, and had over his Brother the Admirall the advantages of Age, Dignity, and generall Eſteeme, if any man cannot without difficulty coniecture, I refer him to the firſt booke of HERODIAN, where let him obſerve the contentions ariſing betweene CRISPINA the Wife of COMMODVS, and LVCILLA, who had beene formerly married to L. VERVS the Emperour. But in this the divers diſpoſitions of the Brothers ſet on edge on the emulous humors of their Wives. The Duke was

 milde, affable, free, open, and no way malicious: the Admirall was naturally turbulent, fierce, ambitious, and conceived himſelfe to be of the two the fitter for publique government. Preſently after the death of HENRY, the Admirall thruſt on by the flattery of his overweening conceits, reſolved to ad a luſtre to his good parts, by marrying the Lady ELIZABETH, as yet indeed ſcarce marriageable. But the Protector wiſely conſidering how raſh and perilous this proiect was, fruſtrated that deſigne. By his after marriage with CATHARINE a moſt beautifull and noble Lady, and aboundiug with wealth befitting her dignity, moſt men were confident, that the gulfe of his vaſt deſires would have beene ſatisfied; but the Law wherby he was condemned (though peradventure enacted by ſtrength of Faction) will manifeſt the contrary. What notice I have received, and what the publique Records teſtify concerning this, being perſuaded, that they ſwarve not much from the truth, I thinke I may without blame relate. The Admirall having now fortified himſelfe with money and friends, and deeming his Brothers Lenity, Sluggiſhneſſe; began to behold him with the eye of contempt, and to caſt about how to diſpoſſeſſe him of the ſaddle, and (being of like degree of conſanguinity to the King) to enioy the ſeat himſelfe. To the furtherance of this proiect it would be conducible, ſecretly to vi
                           •
                        ify and traduce the Protectors actions, to corrupt the Kings Servants, eſpecially if in any degree of favor, by faire words and large promiſes by degrees to aſſure himſelfe of the Nobility, to ſecure his Caſtle of Holt with a Magazine of warlike proviſion, but above all to take care for money the nerves of War and aſſurance of Peace. Theſe things having beene ordered with exact diligence, and for ſupply of coigne the Exchequer mightily

pilled, he vnmaskes himſelfe to ſome of the Nobility, ſignifying his intent of ſetling himſelfe at the Sterne, of forcibly ceaſing on the Kings perſon. Nay his madneſſe ſo far tranſported him, that to one of them, conditionally that his aſſiſtance were not wanting to the advancement of his deſignes, he promiſed that the King ſhould marry his daughter. In the meane time the Queene his Wife being in September delivered of a Daughter, died in childebed, and that not without ſuſpicion of poiſon. For after her death he more importunately ſought the Lady ELIZABETH then ever, eagerly endeavoring to procure her conſent to a clandeſtine marriage (as was that with the deceaſed Queene) and not vntill after the Nuptialls, to crave the aſſent of the King or the Lords of the Counſaile.
                  
                  
                     Anno Dom. 1549. Reg. 3.
                     
                     BVt the Admiralls proiects being oportunely diſcovered, and a Parliament lately aſſembled, he is by the authority thereof committed to the Tower, and without triall condemned. The Parliament being on the fourteenth of March diſſolved, he is on the ſixt day after publiquely beheaded,The Lord Admirall beheaded. having firſt vehemently proteſted, that hee never willingly did either actually endeavour, or ſeriouſly intend any thing againſt the Perſon of the King, or the Eſtate. Concerning his death the opinions of men were divers, their cenſures divers. Among ſome the Protector heard ill, for ſuffering his Brother to be executed without ordinary courſe of triall: as for theſe faults proceeding

 from the violence of youthfull heat, they might better have beene pardoned, then the King be left deſtitute of an Vnkles helpe, or himſelfe of a Brothers. Nay (they ſay) there wanted not thoſe that before this ſevere cou

                        ſe taken with the Admirall, admoniſhed the Protector to have a heedy reguard to this action: Some peradventure might be content to let a Brother ſhed teares; to ſhed his bloud, when they might prevent it, ſcarce any: it was much to be feared leaſt his Brothers death would be his ruine, and the loſſe of ſuch Friends, a hazard to the King. Others highly extolled his impartial proceeding, whom fraternal affection could not divert from righting his Countrey: for if Conſanguinity or Alliance to the King ſhould be a ſufficient cauſe to exempt them from puniſhment, who ſhould plot and contrive the change of governement in the Eſtate; vpon what tickl

                        rtaine and ſure in the publique governement? Others maintained the neceſſity of cutting off the Admirall, and that it ſtood the Protector vpon ſo to do, if he either reguarded his owne or the Kings ſafeguard. For at what other marke did the Admirall aime, but that having ſeiſed on the Kings Perſon, removed his Brother from the Protectorſhip, and married the Lady ELIZABETH, he might by poiſon or ſome other meanes make away the young King already deprived of his Friends, and as in the right of his Wife inveſt himſelfe in the Regall Throne, wherto the Lady MARY (although the elder Siſter) as inceſtuouſly begotten, could make no claime? And thus much was in a Sermon delivered before the King by HVGH LATIMER, who having ten yeares ſince reſigned

his Biſhopricke, had alſo hitherto abſtained from preaching, vntill after the death of King HENRY this Light was againe reſtored, that by his rayes he might illuſtrate Gods Church. But how true his coniectures were concerning the Lord SEIMOVR, I will not vndertake to determine. Whether faulty in his ambition, or overborne by his envious adverſaries, thus ended the Admirall his life, who was indeed a valiant Commander, and not vnfit for a Conſultation, in whoſe ruine the Protector was likewiſe involved.
                     
                        An Inſurrection Not long after this great mans fall, the People throughout almoſt the whole Realme brake out into a Rebellion, wherto the frequent vſurpations and avarice of the Gentry, who in many places encloſed the common and waſte grounds for their owne pleaſure and private profit, had incited them. The Lords of the Counſaile vpon notice of the Peoples diſcontents, and the probability of an Inſurrection vnles ſpeedy courſe were taken to appeaſe them, diſpatched ſome into Kent (the Fountaine of this generall Vprore) who ſhould vpon due examination of the cauſes of the Peoples grievances, admoniſh thoſe that were in that kinde faulty, by throwing open the Incloſures to reſtore to the People what had beene vniuſtly taken from them; otherwiſe they ſhould be Authority Royall be forced therunto, and by their puniſhments ſerve to deterre others from the like inſolencies and oppreſſions. The moſt part obey, and (a moſt gratefull ſpectacle to the People) cauſe their new made Incloſures to be againe laid open. Wherwith Report acquainting the neighbouring Shires, the vnruly multitude inraged, that like reſtitution had not as yet beene made to them, not expecting the neceſſary

 direction of the Magiſtrate, but as if each one were authorized in his owne cauſe, both to iudge of and revenge received iniuries, taking armes levell the Dikes, aſſert the incloſed Lands, and give hope that there their fury would be at a ſtand. But as the Sea having once tranſgreſſed the iuſt limits of it's ſhore, by little and little eats it's way to an Inundation, and is not but with exceſſive toile to be forced within it's vſuall bounds: So theſe having once tranſcended the preſcripts of the Lawes, let themſelves looſe to all kinde of licentiouſneſſe, over-run and ſpoile the Countrey, murther thoſe that favour not their proceedings, and at length by the conflux of the baſer ſort and malcontents ſo increaſe their numbers, that it was not to make head againſt them with ſmall Forces. And although this plaguein Norfolke. raged more in Norfolke-Shire then any where els, yet had it ſo ſpred it's contagion over the moſt part of the Kingdome, that it was ſcarce any where ſincere and free from infection. For the Counties of Kent, Oxford, Surrey, Buckingham, Eſſex, Cambridge, Yorke, Lincolne, but eſpecially Devon and Somerſet were imbroiled in theſe tumults. In Norfolke only had twenty thouſand aſſembled, who now confident of their ſtrength, did no more talke of Incloſures, but ſtretched their complaints to a higher ſtraine; as that, The free-borne Commonalty was oppreſſed by a ſmall number of Gentry, who glut themſelves with pleaſure, whiles the poore Commons waſted with daily labour do like pack-horſes live in extreme ſlavery. But howſoever the calamities incident to this preſent life may with a conſtant patience be endured, the Soule is to be redeemed even with a thouſand deaths. Holy Rites eſtabliſhed by antiquity, are aboliſhed, new ones are autorized, and a new forme of Religion obtruded. To other evills death gives an end: but
                        
                        if they ſuffer their ſoules to be contaminated and polluted by this kinde of impiety, what thing is there that can equall them in miſeries, to whom the end of theſe preſent ones is but the beginning of ſome more horrid, namely of the paines infernall, which no death can ever terminate. Why then ſhould they not go to the Court, and appoint the King yet in his minority new Counſailours, removing thoſe who now ruling as they list, confound things ſacred and prophane, reguarding nothing els but the enriching of themſelves with the publique Treaſure, that they may riot it amid the publique calamities?
                     
                     This was the common complaint and reſolution, eſpecially of the Devonſhire Rebells, who having among them made choice of their Chieftaines, did indevour to vnite themſelves with the reſt of their fellow Rebells. But to keepe them from ioyning, Forces are diſpatched, ſome into Norfolke, ſome into Devonſhire. For Norfolke are deſigned onely fifteene hundred vnder the conduct of the Marquis of Northampton, who for a time bravely defended that ſpacious but weake City Norwich againſt the inſolent Clownes. But his ſmall troupes being much diminiſhed by the loſſe of the Lord Sheffeild and ſome others, he was at laſt faine to quit the City to the Enemy, who after ſpoile barbarouſly ſet it on fire, and conſumed a great part of the edifices. This ill ſucceſſe drave the Lords of the Counſaile to a more ſerious apprehenſion of the danger, who therupon ſent the Earle of Warwicke wi h more competent Forces, who (as he was an excellent Commander) not only forced the Rebells to relinquiſh the City, but alſo preſſed them ſo hard in their retreat, that he compelled them to fight. They ſeeing a neceſſity of battaile impoſed, placed all their Captives (for the moſt part Gentlemen) manacled and chained togeather, in front, that they alone might beare the fury of the onſet,

 and dull both the ſwords and courages of the Royalliſts. But their loyalty was not ſo ill recompenced, as to ſuffer for it, ſcarce any of them falling by the ſword. The Rebells were nevertheleſſe overthrowne, and all either taken or ſlaine except a very few, who rallying themſelves, ſeemed deſperately reſolved to renue the fight. But the propoſall of a Pardon made them caſt away iheir armes, and peaceably to depart. The number of the chiefe authors of this Commotion, who were hanged, was great. But ROBERT KET a Tanner, who in thoſe times, and by that trade had gathered a fortune of a brace of thouſands, was above all as in Fault, ſo in Execution remarkable. He had beene the Chieftaine in this Rebellion, and was not in reaſon to be obſcured among the common ſort: wherfore it being thought fit that he ſhould ſurmount them in the glory of a more notorious puniſhment, he was fairely hanged in chaines on the verv top of Norwich Caſtle.
                     
                        and in Devonſhire.
                         While the Eaſterne parts of the Kingdome were thus poſſeſſed, the Weſterne parts were not leſſe tormented with the ſame Furies. Devonſhire and Cornwall with ſome additions out of Somerſetſhire, had on the ſame pretences armed fifteene thouſand men, who after they had licentiouſly ranſacked the Countrey, at length ſate downe before the famous City of Exceſter. Forty dayes they beſieged it, and were repulſed by the Inhabitants, though vtterly deſtitute of warlike proviſion. On the ſixt of August, IOHN Lord Ruſſell (after Earle of Bedford) entring the City with forces and munition, diſaſſieged it, purſued the Rebells, ſlew ſome, tooke others, to the number of foure thouſand, whereof many were after executed; but eſpecially HVMFREY ARVNDELL Captaine of S. Michaels Mount in Cornwall, a man of antient deſcent and ſufficiently ample revenues: ſo

that I cannot ſufficiently wonder, what madneſſe drave him to aſſociate himſelfe with this deſperate and vnruly rabble. With him were hanged ROBERT BOCHIN, IO. TOMSON, ROGER BARRET, IO. VLCOCKE, WILL. ASA, IAMES NORTON, IO. BARON, and RICHARD BENET Prieſts, and beſides them, IOHN and IAMES ROSOGAN, IO. PAYNE, THO. VNDERHILL, and IO. SOLMAN, all prime incendiaries and chiefe authors of this tumult. The City of Exceſter in memory of this their delivery hath ever ſithence with an anniverſary ſolemnity kept the ſixt of Auguſt holy. As for the other Counties infeſted with the reliques of this rebellion, the evill being tempeſtively ſuppreſt before it ſpred it ſelfe, and the ringleaders puniſhed, they were quickely reduced to their former temper.
                     
                        Some Forts lost in Boloignois.
                         Neither were our affaires more peaceable abroad then at home. For HENRY King of France taking advantage of our domeſtique ſedition, not reguarding the League concluded betweene vs and his Father, invaded Boloignois, where his ſucceſſe was ſuch, that he was animated to greater attempts. He ſets forth a Fleet for the taking in of the Iſles of Ierſey and Guarneſey the ſole portions remaining to the Engliſh of the Duchy of Normandy. At theſe Iſles the French are with great loſſe driven abord their ſhips. At the landing they loſt a thouſand men, and we very few. About Bouloigne, 
                        Corruptly Bonlamberg.
                        , Mont Lambert, Sellaque, and Ambleteul were loſt. Sellaque was defended by two Enſignes: But having beene battered by the Enemy, while we vnwarily parley with MONTMORENCY, was on the five and twentieth of August forced by them. At Ambleteul were ſix Enſignes of Foote, who for ſome dayes made good the place: But finding themſelves vnable long to hold out againſt ſo

 great forces, vpon no other termes then grant of lives, yeelded the Fort to the French. The loſſe of theſe places ſo daunted the Garriſon at Blanconet, that having beene ſcarce ſaluted by the Enemies Cannon, vpon condition of life and goods they quitted the place. Neither was this the laſt important effect of our conceived terrour: for the Engliſh at Mont-Lambert not ſo much as attending the comming of the Enemie, fired their lodgings, made their proviſion vnuſefull, and retreated to Guiſnes, The Fort at the Tower of Ordre fortified both by nature and art, gave a period to this yeares ſucceſſe; ſtanding reſolutely vpon defence vntill the extremity of Winter forced the French to raiſe their ſiege.
                     
                        Enmity betweene the Protector &amp; the Earle of Warwick.
                         The loſſe of theſe ſmall pieces ſet the Protector in the wane of the vulgar opinion, and afforded ſufficient matter for Envy to worke on. Among the Lords of the Privy Counſaile the moſt eminent was the Earle of Warwick
                              •
                           , a man of a vaſt ſpirit, which was the more inlarged by the contemplation of his great Acts performed both abroad and at home. He had long looked aſquint vpon Somerſets greatneſſe, whom in a favorable eſteeme of himſelfe he deemed far beneath him; and was withall perſuaded, that could he but remove the Duke, due reguards would caſt the Protectorſhip on him. The conſideration alſo of the Dukes nakedneſſe (diſarmed of that metalſome peice the Admirall)

                           —(En quo diſcordia Fratres
                           Perduxit miſeros)—
                        
made his hopes preſent themſelves in the more lively ſhapes. He ſeekes about for ſufficient matter wherewith to charge the Duke, who could not be long ignorant of theſe practiſes againſt him. The Duke finding

himſelfe aimed at, but not well diſcerning whether the Earle intended a legall or military proceſſe againſt him, on the ſixt of October, from Hampton-Court where the King then reſided, ſent letters to the City of London, requiring from thence an aid of a thouſand men, who ſhould guard the King and him from the treacherous attempts of ſome ill-affected Subiects. And in the meane time preſſeth in the adiacent Countrey; where having raiſed a reaſonable company, he the ſame night carried away the King, attended by ſome of the Nobility and ſome of the Counſaile, from thence to Windſore, a place, becauſe fortified, more ſafe, and convenient for reſiſtance. But the Earle had made a greater part of the Counſaile, who accompanied him at London. To them he makes a formall complaint againſt the Protector, beſeeching them, by their aſſiſtance to ſecure him from the Protectors malice, who ſought to intrap him for his life. Theſe Lords ſend a contre-letter to the Londoners, demanding aids of them for the delivery of the King out of the hands of his Enemy (for ſo they were pleaſed to terme the Duke.) Then they ſend abroad Proclamations, wherein they inſert the chiefe heads of their accuſation; as that By ſowing ſeeds of diſcord, the Duke had troubled that ſetled and peaceable estate wherin King HENRY had left this Kingdome; and had beene the chiefe cauſe that it had lately beene ingaged in Ciuill wars to the loſſe of many thouſand lives: That many Forts conquered by HENRY with hazard of his Perſon, were by the Dukes either cowardiſe or treachery regained by the Enemy: That he reguarded not the advice of the rest of the Lords of the Counſaile, and had plainely neglected King HENRY'S inſtructions concerning the governement of the Kingdomes of England and Irland:

                        That his chiefe ſtudies, and wherein he was moſt ſeene, were to rake vp wealth, to maintaine a Faction among the Nobility, and yet comply with both parties for his owne advantages, to build ſtately Palaces far exceeding the proportion of a Subiect, and that even in the very inſtan that the Eſtate did ſhrinke vnder the burthen both of inteſtine and foraine wars.
                     
                     The Duke certified of their proceedings, and ſeeing himſelfe forſaken (for the Londoners being prepoſſeſſed, were ſo far from ſupplying him, that they at the ſame time afforded his Adverſary five hundred, and the greateſt part of the Nobility had by ioining with the Earle made their cauſe one) at laſt forſooke himſelfe alſo; and craving of the adverſe party, that they would abſtaine from violence toward him, and proceed only according to the vſuall courſes of Legall tryall; delivered the King to their Tuition, and remitted himſelfe to their diſpoſall;The Protector committed. by whom on the fourteenth of October he was committed to the Tower, together with Sir MICHAEL STANHOP, Sir THOMAS SMITH, Sir IOHN THIN, and ſome others.
                     
                        The death of Paul the Third, Pope.
                         On the tenth of November died PAVL the Third, having ſate Pope neere about fifteene yeares. The Conclave of Cardinalls conſulting about the election of a new Pope, began to have reguard of Cardinall POOLE, in whome the greatneſſe of his Extract, his Vertuous Life, Gravity, and admirable Learning, were very conſiderable motives. The Conclave was at that time divided, ſome were Imperialiſts, ſome French, and a third Part (wherof the Cardinall FARNESE was principall) ſtood Neuter.
                        
                           Cardinall Poole elected Pope. Theſe lator at length ioining with the Imperialists caſt their vnanimous Votes vpon POOLE. Who

vpon notice of his Election, blamed them for their raſhneſſe, adviſing them againe and againe, that they ſhould not in their Conſultations be miſ-led by perturbation of minde, or do any thing for friendſhip or favour, but totally to direct their cogitations to the honor of God and the profit of his Church.
                     POOLE himſelfe having thus put off the matter, the French Cardinalls began to alledge, That in reguard of the difficulties of wayes and diſtance of places, many of the Colledge were yet abſent, and that there was no reaſon why they ſhould with ſuch precipitation proceed to a partiall Election before the Conclave were full. The Cardinall CARAFFA (who ſome yeares after was Pope, by the name of PAVL the Fourth) a waiward old man, whoſe cold ſpirits were ſet on fire by Envy and Ambition, ſought to make vſe of POOLE'S modeſty to his owne advantage, hoping himſelfe as eminent and in as faire a way as any of the Colledge (POOLE excepted) might be advanced to the Chaire. And to leſſen the favour of the Conclave towards POOLE, he betooke himſelfe to calumnies, accuſing POOLE of ſuſpicion of Hereſy and Incontinency, that In Germany and his Legacy at Trent, he had too much favoured the Lutheraus, had often entertained IMMANVEL TREMELLIVS, had inrolled ANTONIO FLAMINIO ſuſpested of Lutheraniſme, in his Family, and promoted him to many Eccleſiaſticall Dignities; and in his Legacy at Viterbo vſed not that ſeverity againſt that ſort of men, that was requiſite. Neither could that compoſed gravity ſo free him from the taint of looſeneſſe, but that many were of opinion he had cloiſtered a Virgin of his owne begetting: That he wondred what the Conclave meant, with ſo impetuous a current to proceed
                        
                        to the election of this one man, and he a forainer: as if Italy it ſelfe were ſo barren of deſerving men, that we muſt be faine to ſend for this man out of Britaine, almoſt the fartheſt part of the knowne World, to inveſt him in the Papacy: wherof what would be the effect, but that the Emperour, at whoſe devotion this man wholly was, might once againe make himſelfe Master of Rome, now by indulgence, as before by force.
                     
                     To theſe allegations POOLE'S reply was ſuch, that he not only cleered himſelfe, but alſo quickened the almoſt extinguiſhed deſires of the Conclave to elect him. The major part wherof aſſembling at his chamber by night, wiſhed LVDOVICO PRIVLO the Cardinalls boſome friend (betweene whome the correſpondence of their diſpoſitions had bred a mutuall affection) to awake him, for that having elected him, they were purpoſely come (an accuſtomed ceremony) to Adore him, and diſſolve the Conclave. PRIVLO having ſignified to him with teſtimonies of exceſſive ioy, the intent of theſe Cardinalls, was greatly blamed by him, and they diſmiſſed with this anſwer, That a matter of ſo great conſequence (carrying with it ſo great a burthen, that it would deterre an ingenuous man from the acceptation of it) was not to be tumultuouſly, but vpon mature deliberation orderly to be tranſacted: as for the ſeaſon it was vtterly vnfit, for aſmuch as God was the God of Light, and not of Darkeneſſe: they ſhould therfore do well to defer it vntill the next day, and if then their reſolutions proved the ſame, he would ſubmit himſelfe to their pleaſures. The Italian Cardinalls conceiving theſe delayes to proceed out of ſtupidity, began to contemne him; and changing their determinations, a little after pitched vpon Cardinall MONTANVS, whome they created Pope, by the name of IVLIVS the Third.
                  
                  
                     
                     Anno Dom. 1550 Reg. 4.
                     
                     THe Duke of Somerſet having now for three moneths continued a priſoner, and not convicted of any crime which might touch his life; it being not thought fitting that ſo great a man, lately Protector of the King's Perſon and Realme, ſhould for a ſmall offence be condemned to perpetuall impriſonment; is vnder-hand dealt with to ſubmit himſelfe, with acknowledgement that hee had deſerved this or whatſoever greater puniſhment the King ſhould be pleaſed to inflict on him, and withall to implore the favour of his Maieſties Royall Clemency. To this he eaſily condiſcended, and was on the ſixt of February ſet at liberty, but not reſtoredThe Duke of Somerſet ſet at liberty. to the dignity of Protector, onely contenting himſelfe with the ranke of a Privy Counſailor. But it being conceived, that revenge might draw the Duke to new practiſes, by mediation of Friends hee is reconciled to the Earle of Warwicke, and that this attonement might be the more firme and ſincere, the Dukes Daughter is on the third of June married to the Viſcont Liſle the Earle of Warwicks Sonne, the King gracing the Nuptialls with his preſence. THVANVS (I know not vpon what grounds) writeth, That the Earle by a kinde of counterfeit ſhew that he was deſirous of the reſtitution of the Romiſh Religion, had ſetled himſelfe in the good opinion of the vulgar, who had not yet learned to renew themſelves by caſting off the old skin, but reverenced Superſtition for it's reputed Antiquity: and that his diſſimulation being diſcovered, fearing leaſt he ſhould be forſaken of them whom he had with falſe hopes deluded, the conſideration thereof, and of the Dukes milde and

 free diſpoſition, would indeere his Adverſary to them: to prevent this danger he contrived this alliance with the Duke, and procured his liberty.
                     In the meane of theſe paſſages, on the nineteenth of January the Lord Ruſſell Lord Privy Seale, was created Earle of Bedford, WILLIAM Lord Saint-John Earle of Wiltſhire, and Sir WILLIAM PAGET Lord Paget.
                     
                     
                        Peace with the Scots and French.
                         The Earle of Bedford and the Lord Paget were within three dayes after with Sir WILLIAM PETERS and Sir IOHN MASON diſpatched into France for the Treatie of a Peace with the Deputies appointed by the French, who were MONTMORECY Gouernour of Picardy, GASPER COLIGNY Lord of Chastillon afterward Admirall of France, ANDREW GILLAR MORTAIR and WILLIAM BOVCHERELLE. The Lord Paget not long before had beene ſent to the Emperor to ſignifie how we were diſtreſſed on the one ſide by the Scots, and on the other by the French, and miſerably rent at home by inteſtine diſſenſions, that our neceſſities required ſpeedy ſuccours, or would force vs to condeſcend to an inconvenient Peace with France. But perceiving nothing was to bee obtained of him, wee ſtroke hands with the French vpon theſe conditions.
                     
                        That Boloigne and all the Forts in Boloignois ſhould be ſurrendred to the French, together with the Artillery and other military proviſion:
                        That in lieu thereof the King of France ſhould pay vnto EDVVARD foure hundred thouſand crownes by equall portions at two payments:
                        
                           
That the Engliſh ſhould reſtore to the Scots, Lauder and Douglas: and (if the Queene of Scots ſhould deſire it) ſhould raſe their Fortifications in Haymon and at Roxburgh.
                        
                     
                     The Emperour was on both ſides comprehended in the League, and the Queene of Scots by the French. The two Kings preſented each other with their military Orders; and (as one writeth) it was on both parts agreed on, that EDWARD ſhould marry one of the Daughters of France. For the ratification of the Articles, on the eight of Aprill Hoſtages were given:
                     
                        By Vs,

                     This Peace betweene vs and France was on the third of March ſolemnely proclaimed in London, and on the five and twentieth of Aprill, Bouloigne being accordingly ſurrendred to the French, our Hoſtages were returned.
                     On the thirtieth of Iuly died the Lord WRIOTHSLEY Knight of the Garter, late Lord Chancellour of England and Earle of Southampton. He had about the beginning of this Kings Raigne delivered vp the Seale, the Cuſtody wherof was committed to the Lord Rich. But having beene about halfe a yeare paſt removed (as was alſo the Earle of Arundell, but for what cauſe is vncertaine) from the Counſaile Table, he at length (whether out of griefe or ſome other cauſe, fell ſicke and died. He was father to HENRY the ſecond Earle, and Grandfather to HENRY the third Earle of Southampton not long ſince deceaſed, who having taſted of both fortunes, did hertofore as generouſly behave himſelfe in adverſity, as he did ſince moderately in proſperity, whereto by the Clemency of our late Soveraigne he was reſtored.

                        The Sweating Sickeneſſe. MEntion hath formerly beene made concerning the Sweating Sickeneſſe, a diſeaſe to which England hath given a name, as well in reguard of it's originall, as of the knowne diſpoſition of our bodies to admit of this virulent contagion. England had beene formerly afflicted with it, but never ſo mortally as this preſent yeare. Shrewsbury was now the firſt place acquainted with this Peſtilence, there it began in Aprill, and thence diffuſing it ſelfe over the moſt part of the Kingdome, at length it vaniſhed away in the North about the beginning of October. The fury of it was ſuch, as if it would never end but by it's proper cruelty, when it ſhould not have left ſubiects wheron to feed. The dead whome it ſwept away were numberleſſe. In London only eight hundred was ſcarce a ſeven nights ſtint. It made it's firſt entry into this Iſland in the Reigne of HENRY the Seventh Anno 1486. and from hence it tooke it's progreſſe to other Nations. The Infected flowed away, and within the ſpace of twenty foure houres when this malignant diſeaſe was moſt mercifull in it's execution, peradventure within twelve, did ſweat out their ſoules. Women, children, and old men it for the moſt part overpaſſed, and wreaked it ſelfe on the robuſtious youth and well compact middle age, who, if in the beginning of their ſickenes did but ſlumber, periſhed inſtantly. If it ſeized on any that were full gorged, the recovery was in a manner deſperate. Nay and of others whatſoever

 they were, ſcarce one of a hundred eſcaped, vntill time had found out a remedy: the manner wherof was thus: If any be taken in the day time, hee muſt without ſhifting of his apparell betake himſelfe to bed: If by night and in bed, let him not ſtir thence, vntill twenty foure howers be run▪ In the meane let the coverture be ſuch, that it provoke not ſweat, but that it may gently diſtill of it ſelfe: if it be poſſible for him ſo long to forbeare, let him not eat nor drinke more then may moderately ſerve to extinguiſh thirſt: But above all, let him ſo patiently endure heat, that hee vncover not any part of his body, no not ſo much as a hand or a foot. The ſtrangeneſſe of this diſeaſe I do not ſo much admire; for that PLINY in his twenty ſixt Booke the firſt Chapter witneſſeth, and daily experience teacheth vs, that every age produceth new and Epidemicall diſeaſes. But that which ſurpaſſeth the ſearch of humane reaſon is this, that this Peſtilence afflicted the Engliſh in what part of the world ſoever, without touching the Natives, but in England alone. This dire contagion promiſcuouſly impoveriſht the Land of people of all ſorts: amongThe death of the Duke of Suffolke.
                         thoſe of eſpeciall note were HENRY Duke of Suffolke, and his Brother, who were the Sonnes of CHARLES BRANDON, and the Kings Couzins germane, young Noblemen of great and lively hopes: by the death of HENRY, the Duchy was for ſome few howers devolved to the younger Brother, who had the vnhappy honour but to beA creation of Dukes and Earles. ſeized of the Title and dy. The Lord Gray Marquis of Dorſet having married FRANCIS the eldeſt Daughter of CHARLES BRANDON, in the right of his Wife made claime to the Duchy, and was on the eleventh of October inveſted in it.

At▪ what time alſo IOHN DVDLEY Earle of Warwicke was created Duke of Northumberland: WILLIAM POWLET Earle of Wiltſhire, Marquis of Wincheſter: and Sir WILLIAM HERBERT Lord Cardif Maſter of the Horſe, Earle of Pembroke. The maſculine Line of DVDLEY and GRAY hath beene long ſince extinct: Of the Family of the POWLETS we have ſpoken already▪ the Lord HERBERT Brother in law toThe deſcent of the Earles of Pembroke
                         Queene CATHARINE PARR, derived himſelfe from WILLIAM HERBERT in the time of EDWARD the Fourth Earle of Pembroke, and was ſucceeded in the Earledome by his Sonne HENRY Father to WILLIAM the moderne Earle (whoſe mature wiſedome and gravity even in his greener yeares, long ſince ranked him in the ſage Senate of the Privy Counſaile to two ſucceſſive Kings) and to PHILIP by King IAMES created Earle of Montgomery. Then alſo were knighted Sir IOHN CHEEKE the King's Schoolemaſter, Sir HENRY DVDLEY, Sir HENRY NEVILL, and (whome I cannot mention but with due honor) Sir WILLIAM CECILL. CECILL I ſay, who then Secretary of Eſtate, was afterward by all Europe held in admiration for his wiſedome; whome Queene ELIZABETH made Lord Treaſurer of England and Baron of Burleigh, and was whileſt he lived a ſecond prop of this Eſtate; who on the fourth of August 1598. piouſly ended his long, but for the publique weales ſake ever reſtleſſe life, leaving two Sonnes, THOMAS by King IAMES created Earle of Exceſter, and ROBERT out of the ſame Fountaine of Royall Goodneſſe Earle of Sarisbury and Lord Treaſurer of England.
                     
                     
                        
 And now the ill cemented affections of theEnmity betweene the Dukes of Somerſet and Northumberland revived. Dukes of Somerſet and Northumberland diſſolved into open enmity. In the proſecution wherof, Somerſet, otherwiſe of a moſt milde diſpoſition (but Patience abuſed, oft runneth into the extreme of Fury) provoked by continuall iniuries, reſolved (as ſome write) to murther Northumberland. To this end, but vnder colour of a viſite, privily armed, and well attended by Seconds who awaited him in an vtter chamber, he comes to his Adverſary at that time by reaſon of ſome indiſpoſition of body keeping his Chamber, hath acceſſe vnto him naked as hee was in his bed, but is ſo courteouſly entertained, and with ſuch ſmooth language, that the Duke of Somerſet good man repenting himſelfe of his bloudy reſolutions, would not execute what he purpoſely came for. At his departure one of his conſpirators is reported to have asked him, Whether he had done the feat? and vpon his denial to have added, Then you are vndone. This his intent being by his owne Party bewraied, a ſecond accuſation is ingroſſed againſt him. The matter is referred to the Counſaile Table, and he on the ſixteenth of October againe committed to the Tower together with the Ducheſſe his Wife, the Lord Gray of Wilton, Sir RALPH VANE, Sir THOMAS PALMER, Sir MILES PARTRIDGE, Sir MICHAEL STANHOP, Sir THOMAS ARVNDELL, and many other of his Friends.
                     On the firſt of December the Marquis of Wincheſter being for that day high Steward, he is arraigned for Treaſon againſt the Eſtate, which hee had not onely ill but treacherouſly managed; and for conſpiracy againſt the Duke of Northumberland. Of Treaſon he cleered himſelfe, and his Peeres acquitted

him. For the Conſpiracy he was by his owne confeſſion condemned, and that by vertue of a Law enacted 3. HENR. 7. which made the very intent, nay imagination of killing a Privy Counſailor, puniſhable by death. But howſoever the Law (enacted as ſome conceive vpon ſomewhat differing intents and meaning) were extended to the higheſt of it's rigour, yet can I not but wonder, how a man ſo great in the reguards of his Reigning Nephew, of his Honors, of the popular Favour, ſhould be ſo deſtitute of Learned Advice, as not to exempt himſelfe from a felonious death by his Clergy. But ſuch were the times, ſuch his misfortunes in the minority of his Prince; from whoſe revengefull hand how could the adverſe Faction preſume themſelves ſecure in the future? Neither could they chooſe but be ſomewhat terrified with that ecchoing teſtimony of the peoples ioy, who ſeeing that fatall Virge the Axe (vſually marſhalling Traitors to the Barre) laied aſide vpon his freedome from the guilt of Treaſon; from Weſtminſter Hall certified that part of the City by their loud feſtivall acclamations, of the gladſome tidings of their Favorite's conceived Abſolution. And theſe peradventure might be cauſes that his execution was deferred.
                     
                        Certaine Biſhops deprived. Hitherto had the Eſtate patiently indured the obſtinate oppoſition of ſome Biſhops in point of Reformation, who for their non-conformity are at length deprived and others ſubſtituted in their Biſhopricks. Of ſome of them we have occaſionally already ſpoken, whoſe cenſures notwithſtanding fall in with this yeare. GARDINER Biſhop of Wincheſter was deprived the fourteenth of February; DAY of Chichester, and HEATH of Worceſter on the tenth of October: TONSTALL of Dureſme on the twentieth of December committed to the Tower; and

 BONER of London on the firſt of October 1549. had beene already exautorated. All of them for feare of practiſing againſt the Eſtate were deteined in Priſon.
                     
                        Some of the Seruants of the Lady Mary committed. And on the laſt of October FRANCIS INGLEFIELD, WALGRAVE, and ROCHESTER Servants to the Lady MARY, as alſo FRANCIS MALLET Doctor of Divinity her Chaplaine, were committed. I cannot ſpeake any thing certaine of the cauſes of any of their impriſonments, excepting Doctor MALLET'S only. At the Emperours requeſt he was permitted to celebrate Maſſe, but with this limitation, In the preſence of the Lady MARY, not otherwiſe: for adventuring to celebrate in her abſence, it was thought fit he ſhould be puniſhed for his preſumptuous tranſgreſſion. With the Lady her ſelfe all meanes had beene vſed to conforme her to the Times: the King himſelfe had taken much paines with her by often ſuaſory Letters, the Counſaile had done the like, and perſonally to ſatisfie her with reaſon, divers learned men had beene imploied. But their labours were vaine; for hatred to our Religion for her Mothers, for her owne ſake, and ſome politique reſpects (for by the Decrees of our Religion ſhe was made illegitimate, and conſequently cut off from the Succeſſion to the Crowne, if her brother ſhould dy iſſuleſſe) confirmed her in that Superſtition which ſhe had ſucked from her Mother.

the King and craved leave to paſſe through England into Scotland. Which being granted, and ſhe invited to London, entred the City on the ſecond of November, where her entertainment was generall and Royall. On the ſixt of November ſhe departed for Scotland, and had the charges of her whole Retinue borne vntill ſhe arrived there in ſafety.
                     
                        The Earle of Arundell &amp; the Lord Paget committed. About the ſame time alſo the Earle of Arundell and the Lord Paget were (but for what cauſes is vncertaine) committed to the Tower. In the enſuing Aprill the Garter was taken from the Lord Paget, and conferred on the Earle of Warwick the Duke of Northumberlands eldeſt Sonne. As for the Earle o

                        The Duke of Somerſet beheaded. THe Duke of Somerſet had now continued two moneths in priſon ſince his condemnation. At length the violence of his enemies (notwithſtanding the Kings deſire to ſave his Vnkle, vnder whoſe tuitio
                           •
                         he had paſſed his childehood) drew him to the Scaffold. Being on the twenty foure of Ianuary brought to the place of execution, he in this manner beſpake the Aſſembly:
                     Being by the Law condemned, I here willingly ſubmit my ſelfe, by exemplary puniſhment to ſatisfie it's Rigour. That God hath beene pleaſed to grant me ſo long a preparative

 to my end, I humbly thanke his eternall Goodneſſe: But in that he hath beene farther pleaſed to inſpire me with the knowledge of his Truth, and to make me an inſtrument for the propagation of the ſame, J can never ſufficiently magnify his Mercies. Jn this do J reioice, in this only do J triumph: beſeeching him, that his Church in this Realme being now reformed according to the Jnſtitution of the antient Primitive, the Members therof may conforme their lives to the purity of it▪s received Doctrine.
                     More he would have ſaid, but a ſtrange tumult and ſudden conſternation of the Aſſembly interrupted him. The People poſſeſſed with a Panique terror, as it were with an vnanimous conſent cried out, Fly quickely, fly: inſomuch that of that infinite multitude which the expectation of the Dukes death had drawne together, as many as well could ſeeking to ſhift for themſelves, many are troden to death, and others in the throng as vnfortunately preſt, the reſt amazedly expect their owne deſtruction, when their owne feares were the greateſt danger. The cauſe of their feares no man could certainly ſpeake: one ſaid he heard a terrible cracke of thunder; ano

                        er the noiſe of a troup of horſe. &amp; ſome over credulous, according to the ſway of their affections, ioyfully affirmed that meſſengers were come with a pardon for the Duke. But certain halberdiers appointed to guard the Duke to the ſcaffold; but comming tardy, &amp; crying to their fellows, Away, away, were more probably the occaſion of this tumult. The true meaning of this amphibologicall word, which commandeth haſte to and from,
                        
being miſtaken, and withall a company of armed men bending themſelves (as was ſuppoſed) againſt the multitude, filled all with terror and confuſion. The affrighted people being at length with much ado pacified; the Duke entreating them for a while to containe themſelves, that he might with a more ſetled minde depart out of this world; by prayer commended his ſoule to God, and then ſuffered with admirable conſtancy, neither by voice, geſture, nor countenance ſhewing himſelfe any way deiected or moved at the apprehenſion of death, vnles peradventure you might take this for a token of feare, that when he covered his eyes with his handkerchiefe, his cheekes had a little more tincture of red then vſuall.
                     That his death was generally lamented, is manifeſt. Many there were who kept handkerchiefes dipped in his bloud, as ſo many ſacred Reliques. Among the reſt a ſprightfull Dame two yeares after, when the Duke of Northumberland was led captive through the City for his oppoſition againſt Queene MARY, ran to him in the ſtreets, and ſhaking out her bloudy handkerchief before him, Behold (ſaid ſhe) the bloud of that worthy man, that good Vnkle of that excellent King, which ſhed by thy treacherous machination, now at this inſtant begins to revenge it ſelfe vpon thee. And Sir RALPH VANE, who on the twenty ſixt of February was with Sir MILES PARTRIDGE hanged at the ſame place where the Duke had ſuffered, at what time alſo Sir MICHAEL STANHOP and Sir THOMAS ARVNDELL were there beheaded, going to his execution ſaid, that His bloud would make Northumberland's pillow vneaſy to him. Theſe foure Knights being to be executed, did each of them take God to witneſſe, that they never practiſed any thing againſt the King nor any of his Counſaile.
                     To returne to the Duke, ſuch was his end. As for

 his life, he was a pious juſt man, very zealous in point of Reformation, very ſollicitous of the King's ſafety, every way good, and carefull of the Weale publique, only a little tainted with the Epidemique of thoſe times, who thought it Religion to reforme the Church, as well in it's exuberancy of meanes, as of ſuperſtitious Ceremonies, wherof not a few of our Cathedralls to this day complaine.
                     Many prodigies enſued his death, wherby many did preſage the calamities of ſucceeding times. In Auguſt ſix Dolphins (a fiſh ſeldome ſeene in our ſeas) were taken in the Thames, three neere Quinborough, and three a little above Greenwich, where the water is ſcarce tainted with the Seas brackiſhneſſe. On the ſeventh day of October were three Whales caſt vp at Graveſend. And on the third of Auguſt
                        A Monſter. at Middleton in Oxford-ſhire was borne a Monſter, ſuch, as few either Naturaliſts or Hiſtorians write of the like. It had two heads and two bodies as far as the navill diſtinct, where they were ſo conioined that they both had but one way of egeſtion, and their heads looking alwaies contrary waies. The legs and thighes of the one did alwaies ly at the trunke of the other. This (female) Monſter lived eighteene dayes, and might have longer peradventure, if it had not beene ſo often opened to ſatisfie curioſity, that it tooke cold and died.
                     This yeare the Monaſtery of the Franciſcan Friers in London was converted into a brave Hoſpitall, wherin foure hundred poore boyes are maintained, and have education befirting free borne men. It is at this day called Chriſt-Church.

                     Anno Dom. 1553. Reg. 7.
                     
                     
                        The King ſickeneth. THis yeare ſets a period to yong EDWARDS Reigne, who by the defluxion of a ſharpe rheume vpon the lungs ſhortly after became hecticall, and died of a conſumption. Some attribute the cauſe of his ſickneſſe to griefe for the death of his Vnkles; ſome to poiſon, and that by a noſegay of ſweet flowers preſented him as a great dainty on New yeares day. But what hopefull Prince was there ever (almoſt) immaturely taken away, but poiſon or ſome other treachery was imputed? Our deluded hopes being converted into griefe, out of paſſion we bely Fate. Had there beene the leaſt ſuſpition of any ſuch inhumane practiſe, Queene MARY would never have ſuffered it to have paſſed as an act of indifferency without an inqueſt. It was doubtleſſe a poſthumous rumor purpoſely raiſed to make the Great Ones of that Raigne diſtatefull to the ſucceeding times. Howſoever it were, the Nobility vnderſtanding by the Phyſitions, that the King's eſtate was deſperate, began every one to proiect his owne ends. The Duke of Northumberland as he was more potent than the reſt, ſo did his ambition fly higher. It was ſomewhat ſtrange, that being not any way able to pretend but a ſhadow of Right to the Crowne, he ſhould dreame of confirming the Succeſſion of it in his Family. But he ſhall ſore ſo high, that he ſhall ſinge his wings, and fall no leſſe dangerouſly than he whome the Poêts feigne to have aſpired to a like vnlawfull governement. As for the Ladies MARY and ELIZABETH,

 two obſtacles to be removed, he doubted not by reaſons drawne from their queſtionable Births to exclude them. The next reguard muſt be of the Daughters of HENRY the Seventh. But of the Queene of Scots (who was Niepce to MARGARET the eldeſt Daughter of HENRY the Seventh) he was little ſollicitous. For by reaſon of our continuall enmity with the Scots, and thence inveterate hatred, he imagined that any ſhew of reaſon would put her by, eſpecially ſhee being contracted to the French, whoſe inſolent government hee was confident the Engliſh would never brooke. In the next place conſideration is to be had of Lady FRANCIS Daughter to CHARLES BRANDON Duke of Suffolke by MARY Dowager of France the ſecond Daughter of HENRY the Seventh, who, her two Brothers then alive, had beene married to HENRY GRAY Marquis of Dorſet. The two Brothers (as before) dying of the late mortality, the Marquis is in the right of his Wife created Duke of Suffolke; and this was another ſtop to his Ambition. For the removall whereof he intends this courſe: He imparts his deſignes to the Duke of Suffolke, and deſires that a Match may be concluded betweene the Lord GVILFORD DVDLEY his fourth Sonne, and Lady IANE GREY the Duke of Suffolke's eldeſt Daughter. And becauſe, if onely right of inheritance ſhould be pretended, the Ducheſſe of Suffolke were in reaſon to be preferred before her Daughter; he vndertakes to perſuade the King not only to diſherit his Siſters by Will and Teſtament, but alſo by the ſame to declare the Lady IANE his next and immediate Succeſſor. Suffolke biting at this bait, they complot by drawing the chiefeſt of the

Nobility, to contract Affinity either with the one or tother to procure the generall aſſent of them all. So on the ſame day that Lady IANE vnder anvnhappy Planet was married to Lord GVILFORD, the Duke of Suffolk's two youngeſt Daughters are married, CATHARINE to Lord HENRY eldeſt ſonne to the Earle of Pembrooke, and crouch backed MARY to MARTIN KEYES Groome Porter. Northumberlands eldeſt Daughter alſo named CATHARINE was married to the Lord HASTINGS eldeſt ſonne to the Earle of Huntington. Theſe marriages were in Iune ſolemnized at London, the King at that time extremely languiſhing.
                     
                        Hauing thus brought theſe things to a deſired paſſe, nothing now remained but to act his part with the weake King. To Him he inculcates, In what danger the estate of the Church would be, if He dying, proviſion were not firſt made of a pious Succeſſour, and ſuch a one as ſhould maintaine the now establiſhed Religion. How the Lady MARY ſtood affected was well knowne. Of the Lady ELIZABETH there might be peraduenture better hopes. But their cauſes were ſo ſtrongly connexed, that either both muſt be excluded, or the Lady MARY be admitted. That it was the part of a religious and good Prince to ſet apart all reſpects of Bloud, where God's Glory and the Subiects weale might be indangered. They that ſhould do otherwiſe, were after this life (which is ſhort) to exſpect revenge at God's dreadfull Tribunall, where they are to vndergo the tryall either of eternall life or eternall death. That the Duke of Suffolke, had three Daughters neerest to him in degrees of Bloud: they were ſuch as their Vertues and Birth did commend, and from whome the violation of Religion, or the danger of a forraine yoke by any match was not to be

 feared, for aſnuch as their education had beene Religious, they had as it were with their milke ſuckt in the ſpirituall food of true Christian Doctrine, and were alſo matched to Husbands as zealous of the Truth as themſelves; He could wiſh and would adviſe, that theſe might be ſucceſsively called to the Crowne, but with this caution, That they ſhould maintaine the now eſtabliſhed Religion. And although Lady IANE the eldeſt of the three were married to his Sonne; he would be content that they ſhould be bound by oath to performe whatſoever his Maieſty ſhould decree: for he had not ſo much reguard to his owne as the generall good.
                     
                        His Will, wherin he diſinheriteth his Sisters. Theſe reaſons ſo prevailed with the young King, that he made his Will, and therin as much as in him lay, excluded both his Siſters from the Succeſſion to the Crowne, and all others whoſoever, beſide the Duke of Suffolke's Daughters. This Will was read in preſence of the Counſaile and the chiefe Iudges of the Realme, and by each of them confirmed, with a ſtrict command that no man ſhould publiſh the contents of it, leaſt it might prove an occaſion of ſedition and civill tumults. The Archbiſhop CRANMER did for a while refuſe to ſubſcribe to it, not deeming it any way agreeable to equity, that the right of lawfull Succeſſion ſhould vpon any pretences be violated: But the King vrging him, and making Religion a motive, which was otherwiſe likely to ſuffer, after a long deceptation he was at length drawne to aſſent. But theſe delaies of his were ſo little reguarded by Queene MARY, that vnder her ſcarce any man was ſooner marked out for deſtruction. Some few daies after theſe paſſages,He dieth. on the fixt of Iuly in the ſixteenth yeare of his age King EDWARD at Greenwich ſurrendred his ſoule to God, having vnder his Tutors reigned ſix

yeares, five moneths, and nineteene daies, and even in that tender age given great proofe of his vertue; a Prince of great devotion, conſtancy of minde, love of the Truth, and incredibly ſtudious; vertues which with Royall Greatneſſe ſeldome concur. Some three howers before his death, not thinking any one had beene preſent to over-heare him, he thus commended himſelfe to God:
                     
                        His Prayer. 
                        O Lord God, free me Ibeſeech thee out of this miſerable and calamitous life, and receive me among the number of thine Elect, if ſo be it be thy pleaſure: although not mine but thy will he done. To thee O Lord do J commend my Spirit. Thou knoweſt O Lord how happy J ſhall be, may I live with thee in Heaven: yet would I might live and be well for thine Elects ſake, that I might faithfully ſerve thee. O Lord God, bleſſe thy People, and ſave thine Jnheritance. O Lord God, ſave thy people of England, defend this Kingdome frome Popery, and preſerve thy true Religion in it, that Iand my People may bleſſe thy moſt Holy Name for thy Sonne IESVS CHRIST.
                     
                     
                        Then opening his eyes, which he had hitherto cloſed, and ſeeing Doctor OWEN the Phyſition, (from whoſe report we have this Prayer) ſitting by, Are you there? (quoth he) J had not thought you had been ſo neere: who anſwered, I heard you ſpeake, but could not collect your words: Jndeed (replied the King) J was making my prayer to God. A little after, he ſuddenly
                        
                        cried out, I faint, Lord have mercy vpon me, and receive my Soule: which words he had ſcarce ſpoken ere hee departed. Much might be ſpoken in praiſe of this Prince, but reguardfull of my intended brevity, I will

                        only give you a taſte of him out of CARDAN, who about a yeare before travailing through England toward Scotland, was admitted to his preſence. The conference betweene them he thus deſcribeth. Aderant illi (ſpeaking of the King) Gratiae: Linguas enim multas callebat puer, &amp;c. He was ſtored with Graces: for being yet a Childe he ſpake many Languages, his native Engliſh, Latine, French, and as I heare, was alſo skilled in the Greeke, Italian, Spaniſh, and peradventure ſome others. He wanted neither the rudiments of Logicke, the principles of Philoſophy, nor Muſicke: He was full of Humanity the reliſh of Morality, of Gravity befitting Royalty, of hopes great as himſelfe: A Childe of ſo great wit, and ſuch expectation could not be borne, without a kinde of miracle in nature. I write not this Rhetorically with the exceſſe of an Hyperbole; for to ſpeake all the truth were to ſpake far more. Being yet but in his fifteenth yeare, he ſpake Latine as readily and politely as I could. What (ſaith he) is the ſubiect of your Bookes De Rerum Varietate? (I had dedicated them to his Maieſty) CARD. In the firſt Chapter I ſhew the long hidden and vainly ſought after cauſes of Comets. KING. And what is the cauſe? CARD. The concourſe and meeting of the lights of the erratique Stars. KING. But being the Planets are moved with ſeverall motions, how comes it to paſſe, that the Comet doth not either preſently diſſolve and ſcatter, or move with their motion? CARD. It moves indeed, but with a far ſwifter motion then the Planets, by reaſon of the diverſity of the aſpect, as we ſee in Chryſtall and the Sunne when a Rainebow rebound vpon a wall, for a little change makes a great difference of the place. KING. But how can that be done without

a ſubiect? for the wall is the ſubiect to the Rainbow. CARD. As in the Galaxia or Milky way, and in the reflection of lights when many candles lighted are ſet neere one another, they do produce a certaine lucid and bright meane. You may know the Lion by his paw, as they ſay. For his ingenuous nature and ſweet conditions he was great in the expectation of all either good or learned men. He began to favour learning before he could know it, and knew it before he knew what vſe to make of it. O how true is that ſaying,

                     He could give you only a taſte of his Vertue, not an example. When occaſion required a Maieſtique gravity, you ſhould ſee him act an old man: in his affability and mildneſſe he ſhewed his age. He plaied on the Lute, accuſtomed himſelfe to publique affaires, was liberally diſpoſed, &amp;c. So much CARDAN. His Corps was on the ninth of Auguſt with no very great pompe interred at Westminiſter neere to his Grandfather HENRY the Seventh.
                     
                     And here had I with this King's death concluded this ſecond Part, had not the conſideration of a memorable enterpriſe of this Kings occurred. To SEBASTIAN CABOTA a Portugall, for his admirable skill in Coſmography and the art of Navigation, hee allowed an annuity of an hundred ſixty ſix pounds. EDWARD by this CABOTA'S perſuaſion on the twelfth of May ſet forth three ſhips vnder Sir HVGH WILLOVGHBEY for the diſcovery of vnknowne Regions in the North parts of the world. The maine hope of this voiage was, that way to open a ſhorter paſſage to thoſe vaſt Countries of

 the Eaſt, Catay and China. Neere vpon the coaſt of Norway theſe Ships were ſo ſevered by tempeſt, that they never met againe. One of theſe great Ships ter

                        WHen the Lady MARY, long ſince acquainted with Northumberland's ſecret practices, was alſo certified of her Brother's deceaſe; not thinking it ſafe to abide neere London, where her Enemies were in their full ſtrength; pretending a feare of the Plague by reaſon of the ſuſpitious death of one of her houſhold, ſhe ſudainly departed from Saint Edmundſbury,
                        Lady Mary flies into Suffolke.
                         and came in one day to Framingham Caſtle in

                        Suffolke, diſtant from London foureſcore miles, and ſeated neere the Sea, from whence if Fortune frowned on her, ſhee might make an eaſie eſcape into France. Here ſhe tooke vpon her the Title of Queene, and by letters to her Friends, and the Nobles, wiſhed their ſpeedy repaire vnto Her.
                     In the meane time Northumberland having for two dayes together conſulted with his friends concerning the managing of this great buſineſſe, the King's death being not yet publiſhed, ſent command to the Lord Maior of London, to repaire forthwith to Greenwich with ſix Aldermen, and twelve other Citizens of chiefeſt account. To them he declares the King's departure, and the ſeating of Lady IANE in the Throne of Soveraignety, ſhewing withall the King's Teſtament vnder Seale, which did import no leſſe then the ſetling the Succeſſion on her and that Family: He cauſeth them either by terrour or promiſes to ſweare Allegiance to Lady IANE, with command, and that vnder a great penalty, that they ſhould not as yet divulge theſe ſecret paſſages. What a furtherance it might be to his affaires if he could aſſure himſelfe of this Citie, hee was too wife to be ignorant of: and as for ſuppreſſing the report of the King's death; hee thought it might prove a meanes to facilitate the ſurpriſall of the Lady MARY, as yet probably ſecure for lacke of notice of her Brother's deceaſe. But vnderſtanding that ſhee had made an eſcape into Suffolke;
                        Lady Iane proclaimed Queene. Lady IANE was by almoſt all the Peeres of the Realme pompouſly conducted to the Tower, and with great ſolemnity publiquely proclaimed Queene. Shee was of age about ſixteene, of feature not admirable but handſome, incredibly learned, very quickwitted, and wiſe both beyond her Sexe and above her Age, wonderfully devoted to purity of Doctrine, and ſo far from deſire of this advancement, that ſhee

began not to act her part of Royalty without teares, manifeſting it to the world, that ſhe was ſorced by her parents and friends ambition to this high but dangerous aſcent. At her going through the Citie toward the Tower, the concourſe of the People was great, their acclamations few, as if the ſtrangeneſſe of ſome new ſpectacle had drawne them together, rather then any intent of gratulation. Which Queene MARYES (for ſo we muſt henceforth call her) friends hitherto diſtruſtfull more of ſucceſſe then the cauſe, accepted of as an happy omen, and were incouraged to aſſiſt her as occaſion ſhould invite them. But the preſence of Northumberland a man quicke, watchfull, and very politique, was yet a remora to their proceedings: Him they muſt ſend farther of, or be content to ſi

                     The ſame day that Lady IANE entred the Tower letters ſent from Queene MARY are read openly at Counſaile Table, wherein ſhe commands the Lords to repaire to her, as being the next in Succeſſion to the Crowne, and that they at laſt ſhould take example from the generall votes of the Kingdome, ſhee being now every where acknowledged the lawfull Soveraigne. And indeed the Norfolke and Suffolke men were become hers; and the wiſer ſort did eaſily diſcerne, that the affections of the people were hers. Wherefore it was thought at firſt expedient ſpeedily to levie an Armie, and that▪ while yet the hearts of the people were free from any impreſſion, and their minds yet equally poiſed in the ballance of irreſolution, were either way to be ſwayed: By this courſe they might be peradventure too ſtrong for the Queene, and preventing her plea by Armes, force her to plead more neceſſarily for her li

As for the Citie, the Faith and wonted Wiſdome of the Counſaile now with her, would containe it in obedience, and worke it to her beſt advantages.

His chiefe feare was, leaſt the advantage of his abſence might incourage oppoſite practiſers to raiſe ſome tumults: But finding either excuſes or abſolute denials no way available, he prepares himſelfe for this expedition, and on the thirteenth of Iuly ſets forth from London, with an Army of ſix thouſand.

And yet of all this multitude, you heare not ſo much as one that wiſheth vs ſucceſſe. The Londoners ſtood very well affected in point of Religion, ſo did alſo for the moſt part the Suffolke and the Norfolke men, and they knew MARY to be abſolute for Popery. But the Engliſh are in their due reſpects to their Prince ſo loyally conſtant, that no reguards, no not pretext of Religion, can alienate their affections from their lawfull Soveraigne, whereof the miſerable ca

and as may appeare by the premiſes, had moſt artificially raiſed their ſuperſtructure; yet as ſoone as the true &amp; vndoubted Heire did but manifeſt her reſolution to vindicate her Right, this accurate pile preſently fell, and diſſolved as it were in the twinckling of an eye, and that chiefly by their ind

Neither were the people made any thing the more inclinable by publikely impugning Queene MARYES Right in the Pulpit, a courſe wherein Northmmberland ingaged many a Preacher. Nay, even in the City of London, that learned and godly Prelate NICHOLAS RIDLEY vpon the deprivation of BONER conſecrated Biſhop of London (who I wiſh had not erred in this matter) was ſcarce heard out with patience.

                           wfull, is of ſuch force, that the Children begotten in ſuch wedlocke are to be accounted lawfull: yet why they ſhould ſeeke to exclude the Ladie ELIZABETH, I cannot but wonder, neither can I thinke that any probable reaſon therefore could be yeilded by them, who deemed Queene MARY illegitimate. To let paſſe alſo in the meane time MARY Queene of Scots, to whom without doubt, the Iſſue of HENRY the Fighth being extinct, the Crowne properly belonged. Whatſoever the reaſons vrged by theſe Preachers were, they were ſo farre from making any impreſſion in the mindes of the People, that they every where flocked abundantly to Queene MARY: and this not out of a vulgar levity, many of the Nobility and other prime men having followed her partie even from the beginning; ſuch were the Earles of Bathe and Suſſex, the Heires of the Lords WHARTON and MORDANT,

 Sir WILLIAM DRVRY, Sir IOHN SHELTON, Sir HENRY BEDINGFEILD, Sir HENRY IERNEGAM, SVLIERD, FRESTON, and others. But above all Sir EDWARD HASTINGS brother to the Earle of Huntingdon was moſt famous, who having Commiſſion from the Duke of Northumberland to raiſe foure thouſand Foot, after hee had levied them, revolted to Queene MARY: For which act ſhe afterward created him Baron of Lowborough, honouring alſo Sir IOHN WILLIAMS with another Baronie, as a reward of his faithfull ſervice. And Serieant MORGAN not comming ſhort of theſe in his devoir, became afterward one of the chiefe Iudges of the Realme.
                     But an vnexpected accident did moſt advantage Queene MARYES affaires. Six ſhips had Northumberland ſet forth on that part of the Kingdome, where it is confined with the German Ocean, that he might intercept the Queene, if ſhee ſought to make an eſcape, and to have them readie for all occaſions. Theſe ſhips were then by tempeſt driven in at Yarmouth, when in the Towne there was a preſſe of ſouldiers for the Queene. The mariners and ſouldiers induced partly by threats, partly by intreatie, yeild the ſhips to Sir HENRY IERNEGAM for Queene MARYES vſe, and aſſociate themſelues with the new raiſed companies. This was to her a matter of great conſequence, and that ſuch ſhe deemed it, her ioy well teſtified. And now incouraged with theſe acceſſions of men, ordnance, and munition, ſhee feared not Northumberland, and reſolued not ſo much her owne defence, as the ſpeedie ſuppreſſion of her Competit

                     The Lords who had hitherto adhered to Ladie IANE were ſomewhat terrified with this adverſe accident. And the Queenes friends living at Court

who had reſerved themſelves for oportunity and were as yet concealed, were now ſo imboldened as to reveale themſelves to each other, deſiring nothing more then that being ſet at liberty (for yet the Tower was the Court) they might but gaine entrance into the Citie, that they might more freely diſcover themſelves. But they muſt either make the way, or be content to pray only for her, whom they could not otherwiſe advantage. It happened that Northumberland had written for more aides. At his ſetting forth he was, beſides his foure ſonnes▪ accompanied with the Marquis of Northampton, the Earle of Huntingdon, the Lord GRAY, and many other perſons of note: and had when he came to Cambridge an Armie conſiſting of eight thouſand Foot and two thouſand Horſe. Removing thence toward Saint Edmonſbury, hee found that many of his ſouldiers had forſaken their Colours, and was wonderfully iealous leaſt of the remainder many would doe the like. Wherefore returning to Cambridge, hee plied the Lords of
                           Northumberland forſaken by his ſouldiers. the Counſaile with continuall demands of ſupplies to fill his companies growne thinne by the departure of ſo many fugitives. The Lords that favoured MARIES cauſe laying hold on this occaſion, obſequiouſly tendring their ſervices for the furtherance of the Dukes deſignes, decree ſpeedie aides for him; but pretend, that it were dangerous to imploy any other in theſe levies, then ſuch of whoſe loyalty they might reſt aſſured, leaſt the like treacherie might be committed as had beene already by Sir EDWARD HASTINGS; and profer themſelues for the execution of this affaire. So by the Duke of Suffolke his permiſſion they all let looſe as it were out of priſon, diſperſe themſelves over the Citie. The chiefeſt of them that were reſolved for the Queene, were the Marquis of Wincheſter Lord Treaſurer, the Earle of Pembroke, the Earle of Arundell
                        
 (whom after a yeares impriſonment with the Lord PAGET, the Duke of Northumberland had lately ſet at liberty) and Sir THOMAS CHEYNEY Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. By the induſtry of theſe, as many of the Lords of the Counſaile as were within call (excepting the Duke of Suffolke) and as many other of the Nobilitie as were knowne to be at leaſt not enemies to Queene MARYES cauſe, had a meeting at Bainards Caſtle, vnder pretence of conference with the French Embaſſadour LAVALL, about I know not what important buſineſſe: But indeed to conſult of a meane how to reduce Ladie IANE to her firſt originall of a private fortune. There HENRY Earle of Arundell bitterly inveighing againſt the Duke of Northumberland, after he had ripped vp the acts of former times, and burthened him with all that had beene done vniuſtly, cruelly, or amiſſe in the Raigne of King EDWARD; hee at laſt comes to that treacherous act of the diſheriſon of the Children of HENRY the Eighth, profeſſing that hee wondred how he had ſo inthralled ſuch perſonages (intimating thoſe Nobles preſent) as to make them inſtruments of his wickedneſſe: For by their conſent and ſuffrages it came to paſſe, that the Duke of Suffolkes Daughter, the ſame Northumberland's Daughter in Law, did now perſonate a Queene, the groſſe and power of Soveraignetie remaining indeed with Northumberland, that hee might freely wreake his tyranny on their lives and fortunes. Religion is indeed the thing pretended: But ſuppoſe wee haue no reguard to theſe Apoſtolicall Rules, Evill muſt not be done that good may come thereof, and wee muſt obey even evill Princes not for feare, but for conſcience ſake, yet how doth it appeare, that MARY intends any alteration in Religion? Certainly having beene lately petitioned vnto in this point by the Suffolke men, She gave them (and that was true) a very hopefull anſwer. And what a
                        
                        mad blindneſſe it is, for the avoidance of an vncertaine danger, to precipitate our ſelves into moſt certaine deſtruction? I would we had not erred in this kind. But errours paſt cannot be recalled, ſome may peradventure be amended, wherein ſpeedy execution oftimes happily ſupplieth former defects.

                        may be publiquely proclaimed. After hee had ſpoken to this purpoſe, the Earle of Pembroke readily and generouſly profeſſed that hee ſubſcribed to the Earle of Arundel's motion, and graſping his ſword, ſignified his reſolution to maintaine the right of MARY againſt all oppoſers. The reſt take after them, and decree the ſame. So commanding the repaire of the Lord Maior and the reſt of the Aldermen, they in Cheapſide proclaime Ladie MARY Queene, with addition alſo of the title of Supreme Head of the Church. And to adde more maieſty to their act by ſome devout ſolemnitie, they go in Proceſſion to Pauls ſinging that admirable hymne of thoſe holy Fathers Saint AMBROSE and Saint AVGVSTINE, commonly knowne by its firſt words, Te Deum. Then they diſpatcht away ſome companies to ſeize on theAnd to ſuppr

                         Tower, and command the Duke of Suffolke to render himſelfe. The Duke as eaſily deiected at the newes, as he had formerly beene elevated by vaine hope, entring his Daughters chamber, forbad the farther vſe of Royall ceremonies, wiſhing her to be content with her returne to a private fortune. Whereto ſhee anſwered with a ſetled countenance: Sir, I better brooke this meſſage, then my forced advancement to Royalty; out of obedience to you and my mother I have grieuouſly ſinned, and offred violence to my ſelfe: now I do willingly, and as obeying the motions of my ſoule, relinquiſh the Crowne, and indevour to ſalve thoſe faults committed by others, if at least ſo great an errour may be ſalved by a willing
                        
                        relinquiſhment and ingenuous acknowledgement. Having ſpoken thus much, ſhee retired into a withdrawing roome, more troubled at the danger ſhe had incurred, then the defeaſance of ſo great hopes. The Duke himſelfe preſently repaired to the reſt of the Counſaile, and ſubſcribed to their Decree. This Proclamation was on the nineteenth of Iuly publiſhed, and entertained with ſuch acclamations, that no part of it could be heard, after the firſt mention of Queene MARYES name. The Earle of Arundell and the Lord PAGET having thus ordered this waightie affaire, accompanied with thirty horſe, rid poſt that night vnto the Queene, to certifie her of the gladſome tidings of her ſubiects loyall intentions.
                     
                        Northumberland proclaimes Mary Queene at Cambridge. In the meane time the Lords of the Counſaile certifie Northumberland of theſe paſſages, commanmanding him withall to ſubſcribe to the Decree, and diſmiſſe his Army. But hee out of the preſage of his owne fortune had before the receipt of their letters proclaimed her Queene at Cambridge, where in a counterfait ioy he threw vp his Cap with the ſincerer multitude. Then hee caſhiered the reſt of his wavering companies, and almoſt all the Lords, who had hitherto followed him, with a legall revolt paſſing over to the Queene, and making Northumberland the ſole author and cauſe of theſe diſloyall diſtractions, were vpon their ſubmiſſion pardoned.
                     Ladie IANE, having as on a Stage for ten dayes only perſonated a Queene, was committed to ſafe cuſtodie and the Ladies who had hitherto attended her, were commanded each to their homes. The Duke of Northumberland was by the Queenes command apprehended by the Earle of Arundell, and committed to the Tower. The manner of his taking is reported to have beene thus: After ſo many checkes vncertaine what courſe to take, reſolved to flie, but not knowing

whether, the Penſioners (who with their Captaine Sir IOHN GATES had followed him in this expedition) while he was pulling on his boots ſeized on him, ſaying, that it was ſit they ſhou

                           d excuſe themſelves from the imputation of treaſon by his teſtimony. The Duke withſtanding them, and the matter being likely to grow to blowes, at the very inſtant came thoſe letters from the Counſaile, which commanded them all 
                           •
                        o lay aſide their armes, and peaceably to repaire to their homes. Theſe letters tooke vp the matter, and ſet the Duke at liberty, which notwithſtanding laſted not long. For the next morning, as he was readie to take
                           Northumberlaud, and ſome other Lords taken. horſe, the Earle of Arundell intercepted him, and with him apprehended the Earle of Huntingdon, the Earle of Warwicke Northumberland's eldeſt ſonne, and two others younger Lord AMBROSE and Lord HENRY DVDLEY, Sir ANDREW DVDLEY the Duke's brother, Sir THOMAS PALMER, Sir IOHN GATES, his brother HENRY GATES and Doctour EDWIN SANDS, who on the five and twentieth of Iuly were brought to London, and preſently committed to the Tower. The Earle of Huntingdon was, not long after, ſet at liberty, but his ſonne was preſently. Sir IOHN GATES, whom Northumberland accuſed to have beene the contriver of all this miſchiefe, and Sir THOMAS PALMER were after executed. The Earle of Warwicke died in priſon. The Lords AMBROSE and HENRY DVDLEY were pardoned. HENRY was afterward ſlaine with a ſhot at the ſiege of S. Quintin; but AMBROSE finding fortune more propitious, out-lived MARY, and by Queene ELIZABETH created Earle of Warwicke, long flouriſhed in the happineſſe of her favour. Sir ANDREW DVDLEY after his condemnation was alſo pardoned. Doctour SANDS being then ce-chancellour of the Vniverſitie of Cambridge
                        
 had by Northumberland's command in the Pulpit publiquely impugned Queene MARYES cauſe, and defended that of Ladie IANE; but with that wiſdome and moderation, although vpon the ſhort warning of ſome few howers, that hee abundantly ſatisfied the Duke, and yet did not ſo deeply incurre the diſpleaſure of the adverſe part, but that his friends prevailed with the Queene for his pardon. So that after a yeares impriſonment he was ſet at libertie, and preſently fled over into Germany: after the death of Queene MARY returning from his voluntary exile, hee was conſecrated Biſhop of Worcester, from which Sea he was tranſlated to London, and thence againe to the Archbiſhoprick of Yorke: a man for his learning, vertue, wiſdome, and extract very famous, but moſt eſpecially happy in his Iſſue, whereof many were admirable for their indowments both internall and externall, and of whom wee have in our age ſeene three honoured with Knighthood.
                     On the ſix and twentieth of Iuly, the Marquis of Northampton (afterward condemned, and pardoned) Doctour RIDLEY Biſhop of London, (who two yeares after was burned at Oxford) and beſide many others, Lord ROBERT DVDLEY that great Earle of Leiceſter vnder Queene ELIZABETH, were brought to the Tower. On the ſeven and twentieth, the Duke of Suffolke (to whom the Queene with admirable clemency within foure dayes reſtored his libertie) Sir IOHN CHEEKE King EDWARD'S Schoolemaſter, Sir ROGER CHOLMELEY chiefe Iuſtice of the King's Bench, and Sir EDMOND MOVNTAGVE chiefe Iuſtice of the Common Pleas, were committed to the ſame place, who were all on the third of September ſet at libertie.
                     On the thirtieth of Iuly the Ladie ELIZABETH accompanied by a great traine of Nobles, Knights,

Gentlemen and Ladies (to the number of five hundred, ſome ſay a thouſand) ſet forward from the Strand through London, and ſo to Wansted, towards the Queene to congratulate her happy ſucceſſe in vindicating her right to the Crowne. Who on the third of Auguſt having diſmiſſed her Army (which had not yetQueene Mary comes to London.

GARDINER late Biſhop of Wincheſter, and ANNE Ducheſſe of Somerſet preſented themſelves on their knees, and GARDINER in the name of them all ſpake a congratulatory Oration; which ended, the Queene courteouſly raiſed them, and kiſſing each of them ſaid, Theſe are all my owne priſoners, and gave order for their preſent diſcharge▪ EDWARD COVRTNEY ſhe reſtored to his Fathers honours, making him Marquis of Excester. As for GARDINER, ſhee not only reſeated him in the Biſhopricke of Wincheſter, but alſo on the thre

                        Deprived Biſhops reſtored. On the fift of Auguſt, BONER and TONSTALL who had beene formerly deprived of their Biſhoprickes, the one of London, the other of Dureſme, and ſhortly after DAY of Chicheſter, and HEATH of Worceſter were inlarged and reſtored to their Biſhopricks, the preſent Incumbents being without due proceſſe of Law eiected.
                     
                        King Edward's Funerall. On the tenth of Auguſt, were celebrated the Exequies of King EDWARD, DAY Biſhop of Chicheſter
                        
 preaching, executing in Engliſh, and adminiſtring the Sacrament according to the manner and forme received in the Raigne of EDWARD. For as yet nothing had beene determined concerning any change in point of Religion. So that when BOWRNE a Chanoin of Pauls (afterward Biſhop of Bath &amp; Wells) preaching at the Croſſe, did inveigh againſt the Reformation in King EDWARD'S time, and did in vpbrading manner argue the iniuſtice of thoſe times, which condemned BONER to perpetuall impriſonment for matter delivered by him in that place that time foure yeare, who was now by a more iuſt clemency reſtored to his libertie and dignitie: the people inured to the Proteſtant Religion, and could abſtaine from ſtoning him, and one of them ayming a poniard at him, miſſed him very narrowly: the affections of the Aſſembly may by this be conceived, that during the Raigne of Queene MARY, the Authour of this bold attempt, notwithſtanding the diligence of erneſt inquiſitors, could neuer be diſcovered. The vproare increaſing, and divers preſſing toward the Pulpit, BOVRNE protected by two Proteſtant Preachers (BRADFORD and ROGERS, who were greatly reverenced by the people, and afterward burned for their Religion) was with great difficultie conveied to the Schoole at Pauls.
                     
                     
                        The Duke of Northumberland the Earle of Warwicke, &amp; the Marquis of Northampton condemned. And now at length on the eighteenth of Auguſt, the Duke of Norfolke ſitting as high Steward of England, were the Duke of Northumberland,) his ſonne the Earle of Warwicke, and the Marquis of Northampton arraigned at Weſtminſter: where the Duke of Northumberland pleading, that he had done nothing but by authority of the Counſaile, his plea being not admitted for ſufficient, he was condemned of high Treaſon. The ſentence being pronounced, he craved the favour of ſuch a death as was vſually executed

on Noblemen, and not the other: He beſeeched alſo, that a favourable reguard might be had of his children, in reſpect of their age: Thirdly, that hee might be permitted to confer with ſome learned Divine for the ſetling of his conſcience: And laſtly, that her Maieſty would be pleaſed to ſend vnto him foure of her Counſaile for the diſcovery of ſome things, which might concerne the Eſtate. The Marquis of Northampton pleaded to his inditement, that after the beginning of theſe tumults hee had forborne the execution of any publique office; and that all that while, intent to hunting and other ſports, he did not partake in the conſpiracie: But it being manifeſt, that he was party with the Duke of Northumberland, ſentence paſſed on him like wiſe. The Earle of Warwicke finding that the Iudges in ſo great a cauſe admitted not excuſe of age, with great reſolution heard his condemnation pronounced, craving only this favour, that, whereas the goods of thoſe who are condemned for treaſon, are totally confiſcated, yet her Maieſty would be pleaſed, that out of them his debts might be diſcharged. After this, they were all againe returned to the Tower. The next day Sir ANDREW DVDLEY, Sir IOHN GATES (who was thought in Northumberland's favour to have proiected the adoption of Lady IANE) Sir HENRY GATES, and Sir THOMAS PALMER were likewiſe condemned. On the two and twentieth of the ſame moneth, the Duke with theThe Duke of Northumberland beheaded. reſt (having two daies before received the Sacrament of the Lords Supper) were conducted to the place of execution: where Northumberland (ſaith that excellent Hiſtoriographer, THVANVS) by the perſuaſion of NICHOLAS HEATH (afterward Biſhop of Yorke) making his owne funerall Oration to the people, acknowledged himſelfe guilty▪ and craving pardon for his vnſeaſonable ambition, admoniſhed

 the Aſſembly, That they ſhould embrace the Religion of their forefathers reiecting that of later date, which had occaſioned all the miſeries of the forepaſſed thirty yeares: and for prevention for the future, if they deſired to preſent their ſoules vnspotted to God, and were truly affected to their Countrey, they ſhould expell thoſe trumpets of ſedition, the Preachers of the Reformed Religion: As for himſelfe, whatſoever he might pretend, his conſcience was fraught with the Religion of his Fathers, and for teſtimony hereof he appealed to his great friend the Biſhop of Wincheſter: but being blinded with ambition, hee had beene contented to make wracks of his conſcience by temporizing, for which hee profeſſed himſelfe ſincerely repentant, and acknowledged the deſert of his death. Having ſpoken thus much, he craved the charitable devotions of the Aſſembly, &amp; commending his ſoule to God, prepared his body for the ſtroake of the axe. This recantation did variouſly affect the mindes of the multitude, who wondred that he ſhould at laſt apoſtatize from that Religion which he had for ſixteene yeares profeſſed, and in favour whereof chiefly, he perſuaded King EDWARD to endeavour the excluſion of his Siſters from their lawfull Succeſſion. Some write, that being deſirous of life, hee did it craftily out of hope of impunity: but that hope being fruſtrated, to have repented it afterwards. He was ſuſpected (neither were the preſumptions ſmall) to have adminiſtred a poiſonous potion to King EDWARD: but in his Inditement there was no mention of it, and that the rather, for that the Iudges had authority only to inflict puniſhment on him for his conſpiracy againſt the Queene. At the ſame time and place were alſo executed Sir IOHN GATES and Sir THOMAS PALMER.
                     
                        Biſhops impriſoned. Many Biſhops alſo, who were thought to have beene too too opinionate in point of Religion, were ſent for to London, and there impriſoned, viz. HOOPER

of Gloceſter, FARRAR of Saint Davies (who were both crowned with martyrdome) and COVERDALE of Exceſter, who at the requeſt of CHRISTIERNE the third King of Denmarke was pardoned. But the Clergy of what ranke ſoever, who would not forſake their wives, or were inveſted in Livings, wherof any one had been for defence of Popery deprived, or that would not by oath promiſe the defence of the Romiſh Religion, were generally forced to relinquiſh their Benefices.

                         PETER MARTYR was then Profeſſor at Oxford, who preſently vpon the death of King EDWARD, was confined to his houſe. But after ſome time his friends ſo far prevailed, that he might come to London, where he betooke himſelfe to his Patrone the Archbiſhop of Canterbury. But hee could not prove a Sanctuary to him. The Archbiſhop himſelfe began now to totter. The Queene, beſide that ſhee was wholy ſwayed by GARDINER, who extremely hated him, had reſolved to wreake her ſelfe on him for the Divorce of her Mother.

It is reported, that King HENRY having determined to puniſh his Daughter the Lady MARY with impriſonment for her contumacy, was by the ſole interceſſion of CRANMER diverted from his reſolutions: And when ſhe was by her Brother King EDWARD to be diſinherited, the Archbiſhop made a long ſuaſory Oration to the contrary; neither could he be induced to ſubſcribe to the Decree, vntill the Iudges of the Realme generally affirming, that it might lawfully be done, the dying King with much importunitie prevailed with him. In ingratefull perſons the conceit (I will not ſay the feeling) of one iniurie makes deeper impreſſion, then can the remembrance of

 a thouſand reall benefits. It was now bruited, that with his fortune CRANMER had alſo changed his Religion, inſomuch that to gratifie the Queene, hee had promiſed to celebrate the Exequies of the deceaſed King after the Romiſh manner. To cleere himſelfe of this imputation, hee by writing declares himſelfe ready to maintaine the Articles of Religion ſet forth by his meanes vnder King EDWARD his Raigne, to be conſonant to the Word of God and the Doctrine of the Apoſtles: in which reſolution he being confirmed by PETER MARTYR, required him for his Second in this religious Duell. But words are not regarded where violence is intended. His death was abſolutely determined; but how it might be fairely contrived, was not yet reſolved. Firſt therefore they deale with him as a Traitor. And having for ſome while continued priſoner in the Tower, to alienate the minds of the people who held him in high eſteeme, he is on the thirteenthThe Archbiſhop Cranmer, Lady Iane, Lord Guilford &amp; Lord Ambroſe Dudley condemned. of November together with the Lords AMBROSE and GVILFORD DVDLEY, and Lady IANE, condemned for treaſon. But the machinators of this miſchiefe againſt CRANMER were ſo aſhamed of their ſhadowleſſe indevour, that they themſelves became interceſſors for his pardon and yet afterwards moſt irreligiouſly procured him to be burned for pretended hereſie. Before hee was committed to cuſtodie, his friends perſuaded him, after the example of ſome other of his religious Brethren, who had long ſince eſcaped into Germany, by flight to withdraw himſelfe from aſſured deſtruction: to whom hee anſwered; Were I accuſed of theft, parricide, or ſome other crime, although I were innocent, I might peradventure be induced to ſhift for my ſelfe: But being questioned for my allegiance not to men, but to God, the truth of whoſe holy Word is to be aſſerted againſt the errours of Popery; I have at this time, with a conſtancie befitting a Chriſtian Prelate,
                        
                        reſolved rather to leave my life, then the Kingdome. But▪ we will now leave CRANMER in Priſon, whoſe farther troubles and martyrdome wee will in their due places relate. Concerning PETER MARTYR, it was long controverted at the Counſaile Table whether, having ſo much preiudiced the Catholique Religion, it were 
                           •
                        it hee ſhould be proceeded againſt as an heretique. But it was at length determined, that becauſe hee came into England vpon publique aſſurance, hee ſhould have libertie to depart with his Family. So having letters of paſſe ſigned by the Queene, hee was tranſported with his friend BERNARDINE OCHINVS, and came to Antwerp, from thence to Colen, at laſt to Strasburg, from whence hee firſt ſet forth for England.
                     
                     In the meane time on the firſt of October, the Queene was with great pompe crowned at Weſtminſter
                        The Coronation. by STEPHEN GARDINER Biſhop of Winchester, and that after the manner of her Anceſtours.
                     On the fift of the ſame moneth a Parliament is called at Weſtminſter, wherein all the Lawes enacted againſt the Pope and his adherents by HENRY and EDWARD, were repealed. And in the ConvocationA Diſputation in the Convocation houſe. houſe at the ſame time was a long and eager diſputation concerning the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, the Prolocutor Doctour WESTON with many others maintaining CHRISTS Corporall reall preſence in the Sacrament: Among thoſe few who ſided with the Truth, were IOHN AILMER and RICHARD CHEYNEY (both by Queene ELIZABETH made Biſhops, the one of London, the other of Gloceſter) IOHN PHILPOT Archdeacon of Wincheſter, who confirmed this doctrrine with the teſtimony of his bloud, IAMES HADDON Deane of Exceſter, and WALTER PHILIPS Deane of Rocheſter.
                        
 At length the Truth was oppreſſed by Multitude not Reaſon. Wherevpon the reſtitution of Romiſh rites is againe concluded, and on the one and twentieth ofPopery reſtored. 
                        December, Maſſe beganne againe to bee celebrated throughout England.
                     
                     The ſame day alſo the Marquis of Northampton and Sir HENRY GATES not long ſince condemned, were ſet at libertie and pardoned: And the Lords AMBROSE and GVILFORD DVDLEY with Lady IANE had their impriſonment more at large, with hope of pardon alſo.

                     THe Queene, who was now thirty ſeuen yearesThe Queene inclines to marry. old, &amp; hetherto thought averſe from marriage, either in regard of her own natural inclination, or conſcious to her ſelfe of the want of ſuch beauty as might indeare a husband to her; her affaires ſo requiring, began at length to bethink her of an husband. She feared, leaſt the conſideration of her ſexes imbecillity might bring her into contempt with her people, ſhe being yet ſcarce ſetled in her throne, and the Kingdome ſtill diſtracted in their affections to ſeverall Competitors. Fame had deſtined three for her bed, PHILIP Infant of Spaine the Emperou'rs Son, Cardinall POOLE, and the Marquis of Exceſter. The two laſt were propoſed for their Royall deſcent, and the opinion of the loue of their Countrey, there being hope, that vnder them the freedome, and the priviledges of the Kingdome might be preſerued inviolate. But beſides proximity of Bloud in each of the three, Cardinall POOLE was much affected by the Queene, for his grauity, ſanctimony, meekneſſe, and wiſdome, COVRTNEY for his flouriſhing youth,

his courteous and pleaſant diſpoſition. But he I knew not how, was ſomwhat ſuſpected, not to thinke ſincerely of the late eſtabliſhed Religion, but to haue fauored the Reformed. And the Cardinall being now in his fiftieth and third yeare, was deemed a little too old to be a father of childen. But their opinion prevailed, as more neceſſary, who thought this vnſetled Kingdome would require a puiſſant King, who ſhould be able to curbe the factious ſubiect, and by Sea and Land oppoſe the French by the accrue of Scotland become too neere neighbours and enemies to vs. Vpon theſe motives the ambitious Lady was eaſily induced to conſent to a match with PHILIP. For the Treaty whereof the Emperour had about the end of the laſt yeare, ſent on a grand Embaſſage LAMORALLE Count Egmond, with whom CHARLES Count Lalaine, and IOHN MONTMORENCY were ioyned in Commiſſion. In Ianuary the Embaſſadours arrived at London, and in a few daies conclude the marriage, the Conditions whereofwere theſe,
                     
                        The Articles of the Queenes marriage with Philip of Spaine.
                         That matrimony being contracted betweene Philip and Mary, it ſhould be lawfull for Philip to vſurpe the Titles of all the Kingdomes and Provinces belonging to his Wife, and ſhould be ioint-Governour with her over thoſe Kingdomes, the Priviledges and Cuſtomes thereof alwayes preſerved inviolate, &amp; the full and free diſtribution of Biſhoprickes, Benefices, Favors, Offices alwayes remaining intire to the Queene. That the Queene likewiſe ſhould be aſſumed into the ſociety of all the Realmes, wherein Philip either then was, or ſhould be afterward inveſted.

 That if Shee ſurvived Philip, ſixty thouſand pounds per annum, ſhould be aſsigned for her iointure, as had beene formerly aſsigned to Lady Margaret Siſter to Edward the Fourth and Widow to Charles Duke of Burgoigne, wherof forty thouſand ſhould be raiſed out of Spaine and Arragon, twenty thouſand out of the Netherlands and the Provinces therto belonging. And to prevent all future iars and contentions about the diviſion of the inheritance of the Kingdomes and Provinces which either then were or afterward ſhould be belonging to either, it is agreed, That the Iſſue begotten by this marriage ſhould ſucceed in all the Queenes Kingdomes and Dominions, and in all the Principalities of the Netherlands and Burgoigne, whereof the Emperour did ſtand poſſeſſed: That Charles the eldeſt Sonne to Philip by a former marriage ſhould likewiſe ſucceed in all the Kingdomes aſwell of his Father, as of his Grandmother, and his Grandfather the Emperour, both in Italy and Spaine, and by reaſon thereof ſhould ſtand obliged for the payment of the forementioned forty thouſand pounds. If by this matrimony no other Iſſue ſhalbe begotten then Female, the Eldeſt ſhall ſucceed in all the Provinces of the Netherlands, but with this caution, that by the Counſaile and conſent of her Brother Charles,
                        
ſhe ſhall make choice of an Husband either ou
                           •
                         of England or the Netherlands; if ſhe marrie from elſewhere without his conſent, ſhee ſhall be deprived of her right of Succeſsion, and Charles be inveſted therin. But to her and her Sisters a convenient Dowry ſhall be aſsigned according to the Lawes and Customes of the places. Jf it happen that Charles, or his Succeſſours ſhall die without iſſue; in that caſe the firſt borne by this marriage, although it be a Female, ſhall ſucceed in all the Kingdomes belonging to both theſe Princes, as well of the Netherlands, as of Spaine, and in all the Principalities of Italy; and ſhall be bound to preſerve inviolate all the Lawes, Priviledges, Jmmunities and Customes of each Kingdome. Betweene the Emperour, Philip, and his Heires, betweene the Queene, and her Children and Heires, and betweene both their Realmes and Dominions, constant Amity, Concord, a perpetuall and inviolable League ſhall be continued. This League, Agreement, and Articles ſhall be renued and confirmed at VVeſtminſter the two and fortieth yeare of thisWhich, as I conceive, would have fallen in the yeare 1588.

                     As ſoone as the Decree concerning theſe Nuptiall Compacts was divulged, many out of a reſtles diſpoſition miſliking the preſent times, but eſpecially traducing the intent of this Accord, as if by it the Spaniard
                        
 were to become abſolute Lord of all, who ſhould have the free managing of all affaires, and aboliſhing our ancient Lawes and Cuſtomes, would impoſe an intolerable yoake, as on a conquered Nation. This was the generall conceit of this Action. But in private, every one according to their divers humours did mutter diverſly: ſome cenſuring the Queenes actions, others complaining of the change of Religion contrary to her promiſe made to the Suffolke men: ſome lamented the caſe of Lady IANE, who had beene forcibly depoſed, and cruelly condemned to an ill-deſerved death. Some were ſwaied by pittie, ſome by the reguard of Religion, but moſt by the feare of a Spaniſh ſervitude: and others were by their owne hopes and the deſire of change animated to a rebellion. A Chieftaine only was wanting, which defect was
                           Sir Thomas Wyats rebellion.
                         quickly ſupplied by Sir THOMAS WYATA Knight of Kent. Who having communicated the matter with the Duke of Suffolke, Sir PETER CAROW of Devonſhire, and ſome others, concluded that it would not be expedient to attempt any thing vntill the arrivall of PHILIP, that ſo they might not ſeeme to have taken Armes to any other end, then to ſecure their Countrey from the vſurpation of a foraine Prince. So reſerving themſelves for oportunity, they diſperſe themſelves into ſeverall places: WYAT into Kent a countrey adioyning to London, and diſioyned from Calais by a little fret of Sea; Sir PETER CAROW into Devonſhire, a part of England in the Weſt oppoſite to the maine of France; and the Duke of Suffolke withdrew himſelfe to his place in Warwick ſhire ſituated in the very heart of the Realme. In theſe ſeverall places, they ſecre

                        ly furniſh themſelves with armes, money, and all ſorts of munition, and ſeeke to draw others to partake in the Conſpiracie. Sir PETER CAROW, whether thruſt on by his fate, or

thinking delaywould prove dangerous, began ſecretly to levie ſome forces in Cornwall, but the ma

By what meanes hee afterward made an eſcape I know not. But he flouriſhed many yeares vnder Queene ELIZABETH, and died at Roſſe in Leinſter a Province of Irland in the yeare 1577. as appeareth by his monument in the Cothedrall Church at Exceſter erected at the coſts of his nephew PETER, who was brother to GEORGE, whom King IAMES for his many vertues not long ſince created a Baron.

With Sir PETER at the ſame time Sir IOHN CHEEKE, who had beene King EDWARD'S Tutour, was alſo taken, who came from Strasburg towards Bruſſells, and that not without publique licence, vpon no other buſineſſe, but to viſit (as ſaith FOX the Queenes Agents there, or rather according to THVANVS, to marry a wife. Whatſoever were the cauſe of his iourney, certaine it is that hee was intercepted, on the way from Antwerp to Bruſſells vnhorſed by ſome of the Queenes ſervants, and tied with cords to a cart, at laſt muffled, carried on ſhipboard, and conveied to the Tower at London, not knowing all the way for what part of the world hee was bound. There, having alwaies in conſcience abhorred the errours of Popery, he was forced to abiure his Religion, for which hee afterward became ſo repentant, that out of extremitie of griefe he languiſhed, and ſhortly died. Theſe paſſages I doe the more exactly deſcribe, becauſe there want not ſome, who relate, that both Sir PETER CAROW, and Sir IOHN CHEEKE for their Religion ſuffered at a ſtake on

 the thirteenth of Iune this preſent yeare.
                     But to returne to WIAT; he perceiving that his intents were divulged, and that hee had nothing to truſt to, no refuge but valour; incited the people in Kent to a Rebellion, and (as Rebels never want common pretexts to colour their actions) that,
                     Becauſe the Queene relying too much vpon the adviſe of bad Counſailers, had lately done, and did daily indevour many things preiudiciall to the Eſtate of the Realme: That therefore to prevent farther inconveniences, thoſe Counſailers muſt be removed, and others ſubſtituted, who ſhould ſo manage the Eſtate, as ſhould anſwere the truſt repoſed in ſuch men, whoſe loyalty ſhould render them more carefull of the publique, then their private profit▪ But above all they must endevour, that ſome meanes muſt be vſed to impeach this determined Match, by which hee plainly foreſaw this free Realme would be oppreſſed with the miſe
                           •
                        ies of a moſt lamentable ſervitude: and a floud-gate would be opened to let in a perpetuall current of Superſtition: That the effects of their Armes would prove very profitable to the Queene (for whoſe happineſſe he ſhould ever pray) and to the generall good of the Kingdome.
                     But howſoever heefed the giddie multitude with ſpecious words, the Duke of Suffolke at that time running the ſame courſes in Warwick-ſhire, it was palpable,

that their drift was to depoſe MARY, and once more to inthrone captive IANE.
                     By the five and twentieth of Ianuary, fame had filled London with the newes of this Kentiſh Rebellion. For the repreſſion whereof, the Duke of Norfolke was the ſame day diſpatched with ſome ſmall forces, conſiſting for the moſt part of the Queenes Guard, which were a little increaſed by the acceſſion of five hundred Londoners, who were the next day ſent downe by water to Graveſend, where the Duke expected them. With theſe hee reſolves to encounter WIAT, whom his madneſſe had not yet carried beyond Rocheſter, which (notwithſtanding its weakneſſe being no way fortified he intended to make good againſt the Duke, and had incamped within the ruines of the Caſtle.
                     
                        Rocheſter is a Citie ſeated vpon the River Medway, where falling into the Thames it is moſt violent, ebbing and flowing like a ſtraight, and is made paſſable by an arched ſtone bridge of excellent artifice. This bridge had the Rebels ſeized, and planted on it ſome braſſe double Canons, that they might debar the Duke (whom they vnderſtood by their Scouts to bee vpon march) of paſſage. But he nothing daunted with their proceedings ſent a Herald to proclaime pardon to ſuch as forſaking WIAT, ſhould returne to their obedience, reſolving withall to force the bridge and gaine entrance into the Citie. The Herald executed his office, but with ſo ſubmiſſe a voice, that hee was heard by few (for indeed a Piſtoll held at his breſt ſo terrified him, that hee was content for his owne ſafetie to yeild to the Rebels ſo commanding) and was returned with this anſwer, that they knew not themſelves to be ſo far delinquent, as that they ſhould need any ſuch pardon. Only Sir GEORGE HARPER faining a revolt, made over toward the Duke of Norfolke, but indeed with intent to perſuade ALEXANDER

 BRET Captaine of thoſe five hundred Londoners, to partake in this action of common diſloyalty.Bret with 500. Londoners revolts to Wyat. Which he performed ſo effectually, that BRET, whoſe Company made the Vauntguard, before hee came ſo neere the bridge as to give an aſſault, ſudainly drawing his ſword turned about to his ſouldiers, and thus beſpake them:
                     
                        Ʋaliant Countrymen, wee now ingage our ſelves in a cauſe, which before wee farther proceed, would require mature deliberation. We march, but againſt whom? Are they not our friends, our fellow-natives, with whom we ſeeke to make a deeper mixture of our blouds? Have they not taken armes for the preſervation of the ancient glory of the Engliſh name, and to vindicate our common liberties against the inſolencies of the cruell Spaniard? You whoſe degenerous ſpirits can brooke the indignities of ſervitude, continue in God's name with your brave Generall, who without doubt will deſerve the ſervice of ſuch Worthies: As for mee (who had rather vndergo many the moſt torturing deaths, then betray my liberty to the Spaniard) I here (happy and proſperous may it prove) inroll my ſelfe vnder VVyat's Colours, and am confident that ſome of you out of affection to your Countrey will follow my example.
                     Hee had ſcarce ſpoken thus much, when they all crying out a WYAT, a WYAT, turned their Canon

againſt their fellowes, who followed in the Rere. Which vnexpected revolt ſo terrified the Duke of Norfolke, the Earle of Arundell, and Sir HENRY IERNE

The remaindes of that ſmall Army prepared themſelves according to the example of their Commanders, when WYAT with ſome horſe intercepted their flight, &amp; ſeaſed on eight braſſe peeces withall the Dukes munition: then vſed he ſome perſuaſions to pervert their loyalty, profeſſing withall, that if any one would be an inſtrument of his owne miſerie by aſsiſting the Queene, hee ſhould have free licence to depart, deſiring all ſuch, that they would certifie all men, but eſpecially her Maieſtie, that WYAT calling God and men to witneſſe did proteſt, that hee tooke not Armes any way to preiudice her, but to maintaine the liberties of his Countr

The five hundred Londoners, many of the Guard, and the greateſt part of the headleſſe Army forth-with ioyne with WYAT, who now vpon confidence of his forces reſolves to make ſpeedily for London.
                     
                     
                        The Duke of Suffolke perſuades the people to Armes in vaine. Whiles WYAT thus acts his part in Kent, the Duke of Suffolke, who with his brothers Lord IOHN and Lord LEONARD GRAY departed from London on the five and twentieth of Ianuary, did every where incite the people to take armes againſt the Spaniard. But finding, that this alarme tooke not, and knowing he had waded too far to hope for a ſecond pardon, hee determined to indevour an eſcape by flight. But the Earle of Huntingdon ſent by the Queen with three hundred Horſe to take him, made him alter his reſolution. The Duke's company conſiſted not of above fifty, with which ſmall number in a

 Countrey that no way favoured his proceedings, to oppoſe the Earle were deſperate mad
                           •
                        eſſe. Therefore diſtributing his money amongſt them, faines a flight, adviſeth his brothers and the reſt to diſperſe themſelves, and having thus freed himſelfe from the danger of obſequious eyes, committed himſelfe to the truſt of one VNDERWOOD, whom hee had formerly made his Ranger at Aſtley▪
                         But benefits oblige not ignoble mindes, which either mercenary or timid, treacherouſly faile in their repoſed truſt. Such did this man prove, who having promiſed for a while to ſhelter his Lord, vntill hee ſhould bethinke himfelfe of ſome other expedient courſe, either out of feare or hope of reward, betraied him to the Earle of Huntingdon, by whom guarded with three hundred Horſe, hee was brought to London, and on the eleventh of February committed to the Tower.
                     In the meane time the Queene iealous of the Londoners, eſpecially ſince BRET'S revolt, on the firſt of February attended by moſt of the Nobilitie, came to Guild hall, where the Commons of the City were aſſembled in their Liveries, to whom ſhe ſpake after this manner:
                     
                        The Queens oration to the Londoners.
                         Although Wee doubt not of your loyaltie, and ſo need not give an accompt of Our actions; yet having intelligence that many ſeduced by this Arch-traitours gay pretexts, do ſecretly favour his deſignes; Wee have, to giue ſatisfaction to all, condiſcended to this

dayes meeting with the Infant of Spaine is that forſooth, that muſt colour all his villanies. But his actions diſcover his deeper practices. For having now ſomewhat encreaſed his members, his madneſſe hath ſo tranſported him beyond the distaſte of Our Match, that hee now reſolves on the cuſtodie of Our Perſon, and abſolute power of removing, retaining, puniſhing of Our Counſaile whom hee liſt▪ Jn this great affaire of Our Marriage, Wee have done nothing but by the adviſe of Our Peeres. Wee have lived the greateſt part of Our age, ſingle. Neither do Wee now ſo long for a Husband, but that, if the Eſtates of Our Realme iudge it convenieut, Wee will continue Our Ʋirgin eſtate. For, that J ſhould ſeeke to indanger England, and to confound all things by an vnfortunate Match, the love of Our native ſoile, the long knowledge of Our peaceable diſpoſition, Our indevours for your good, will perſuade you to the contrarie. Perſiſt therefore in your loyall reſolutions, and aſsiſt vs in executing Our due revenge on theſe Monſters of men, who conſpire to take away the Head which was ordained to guide them, and to ſuffer with them:

 Neither are Our demands other then We may in reaſon expect from you, who ſo maturely, ſo vnanimouſly admitted of Our Gouernment, as deeming Ʋs the vndoubted Succeſſour to Our Royall Father and Brother.
                     Having thus confirmed the mindes of the Citizens, ſhee armes five hundred men (the greater part ſtrangers) to the choiſeſt whereof ſhe commits the defence of London-bridge, and diſpoſes of the reſt throughout the Citie. Two dayes after to London comes WYAT with an Army of three (or foure) thouſand, full of hope, that having preſent admittance into the Citie, ſucceſſe ſhould crowne his actions, and that without either perill or paines. But things anſwered not his expectation. For comming to the Bridge, hee found it cut downe, the Gates ſhut and made good againſt him by armed troupes, who diſdainfully bid the Traytour avaunt. Nevertheleſſe hee continued two dayes in Southwerke, hoping, that time and induſtry of ſecret practicers might worke ſome alteration.
                     But his hopes being here alſo fruſtrated, hee turnes his march for Kingſton, there to gaine paſſage over the Thames. But the woodden Bridge there was alſo brokeu, and the oppoſite banke defended by two hundred men, whom the ſight of two Peeces of Ordnance readie to be planted againſt them ſo terrified, that they left their ſtation, and gave WYAT libertie to finde out meanes to waft his Army. Having ſurmounted this difficulty, he once more reſolves for that Queene of Cities,

and repoſing all the ſucceſſe of this adventure in celerity, without ſuffering his ſoldiers to repoſe themſelues, makes with a round march for London, where he hoped to arrive before day, and to ſurpriſe the ſecure Queene. But God is the Protector of Princes, who more eſpecially are his Images and Lieutenants; ſo that the practiſes of Rebels and Traitors againſt their lawfull Soveraignes ſeldome prove ſucceſſefull. WIAT had (not improbably) beene maſter of his deſires, had not God by an vnexpected accident retarded him, or rather ſo blinded him, that by vnneceſſary delaies he overſlipped his opportunity. He was now within ſix miles of London, when the carriages of one of his braſſe pieces being broken, the piece became for the preſent vnſerviceable, becauſe immovable. In remounting this piece ſome howers were loſt, notwithſtanding their perſuaſions who adviſed him not to neglect more reall advantages, as indeed he did: for by this meanes he came ſhort of the time prefixed by thoſe Citizens who were fautors of his cauſe. The conſideration wherof made many deſpaire of ſucceſſe and relinquiſh him, ſo that his army was quickely contracted to a ſmaller groſſe. Among the reſt Sir GEORGE HARPER partaker of all WIATS ſtratagems, that he might wipe away the ſtaines of Rebellion and his diſſembled revolt by a loyall treachery, poſted away to the Queene, and revealed the whole ſeries of WIATS proiects. The Queene amazed at the apprehenſion of this imminent danger, gives Commiſſion to the Earle of Pembroke for the ſpeedy raiſing of ſome Forces, and makes him Generall of the field. WIAT hearing that the Earle of Pembroke was in armes, betooke himſelfe to a flower march, leaſt he ſhould be forced againſt theſe freſh ſouldiers to oppoſe his panting weary ones. So by noone he approched the ſuburbs, and planting his

 ordnance vpon a hill beyond Saint James, left there the greateſt part of his ſmall Army to guard them. He himſelfe with five Enſignes made toward Ludgate, and CVTBERT VAVGHAN with two other Enſignes toward Weſtminster, leaving S. Iames on the left hand: wherin I beleeve his chiefe end was, that by terrifying that part of the City, and conſequently diſtracting the Queenes forces, WIAT might gaine paſſage with leſſe difficulty. At Charing-Croſſe Sir IOHN GAGE Lord Chamberlaine, with part of the Guard and ſome other ſouldiers made head againſt WIAT. But at length, either the Queene for fea

                           •
                        h more then an orderly march he made toward the Court, and filled it with terror and amazement. The Earle of Pembroke followed WIAT, ſtill cutting him off behinde: by which kinde of fight WIAT, not turning head, loſt many of his ſouldiers. The reſt of the Rebells couragiouſly marching vp Fleetſtreet, with ioyfull acclamations cried out, Queene MARY, Queene MARY, God ſave Queene MARY, who hath granted▪ vs our petitions, and pardon. At length they came to Ludgate and deſired entrance: But by their fained acclamations they gained nothing but reprochfull language. Wherupon they intend to returne the ſame way, but are circumvented by the Earle of Pembrokes Horſe. Then CLARENTIEVX perſuaded him to yeeld, and not beyond all his former madneſſe, to ſurcharge himſelfe with the bloud of ſo many valiant men. WIAT'S ſouldiers ſeemed deſperatly bent to make their way, but his courage was quailed▪ So
                           Wiat is taken. he yeelded to Sir MAVRICE BARKLEY, who mounting him behinde him, carried him preſently to the Court. Their Captaine taken, the ſouldiers make no reſiſtance; ſome few of them eſcape by

flight, but the greater part fill the priſons of the City. Theſe were the accidents of the ſixt of February.
                     
                     
                        The Lady Iane beheaded. Having thus ſuppreſt the Faction, the puniſhment of the Conſpirators is next in execution. The firſt that was reflected on (as for whoſe ſake this Rebellion had been ſet on foot) was Lady IANE; who having beene condemned on the thirteenth of November, had her execution hitherto deferred, not without hope of pardon. But to take away all farther cauſe of ſedition, her death is now abſolutely determined. Wherupon FECKNAM Deane of Pauls, afterward Abbot of Westminſter, was ſent vnto her to admoniſh her to prepare for death, and withall to perſuade her to entertaine the Romiſh Religion. This ſad meſſage ſo little moved her, that ſhe profeſſed her ſelfe bound in this to acknowledge Gods infinite goodneſſe: as for diſcuſſing matters of controverſie in Religion, her time was ſo ſhort, that ſhe could not diſpence with the leaſt loſſe of it: that little that was allotted her, ſhe knew ſhe might better ſpend in her devotions to Heaven. FECNAM conceiving this anſwer to proceed from a deſire of longer date of life, prevailes with the Queene for three daies more; and returning to Lady IANE, certifies her what hee had done; beſeeching her to hearken vnto him, and to reforme her opinion in point of Religion. To whome ſhe anſwered with a ſmiling countenance; Alas Sir, it was not my deſire that her Maiesty ſhould be troubled with the report of my words: For thinke not that I am touched with any deſire of prolonging my dayes: No, I am ſo far from it, that ever ſince your departure life hath afflicted me with its tediouſ
                              •
                           eſſe; and as for death, being wholly intent to the attaining of life eternall, J vtterly deſpiſe it, and her Maieſties pleaſure being ſuch, I willingly
                        
                        vndergo it. FECKNAM againe reiterated his perſuaſions, that ſhe would imbrace the Religion of the Church of Rome: to whom her replies were ſuch, that whoſoever ſhall read the conference betweene them, (for it was after publiſhed) cannot without amaſement wonder, how ſo tender an age, eſpecially the Sex conſidered, ſhould be capable of ſuch conſtancy, learning, wiſedome, wit. Her Husband Lord GVILFORD being firſt to ſuffer, deſired leave to ſee her, converſe with her, and take his laſt farewell: whereto ſhee would by no meanes conſent, deſiring him to omit this foment of griefe, rather then comfort, in death; for they ſhould ſhortly behold each other more really vnited in a better place and more happy eſtate. Yet ſhe vnappalled ſaw him conducted to Tower-hill, and with the ſame ſetled ſpirit beheld his headleſſe trunke when it was returned to be interred in the Chappell of the Tower. The death of this innocent Lady, it was conceived, would not be without almoſt a generall diſtaſte. But to decline it as much as might be, it was thought good that ſhe ſhould not be publiquely beheaded; wherefore there was a ſcaffold erected within the Tower, wheron about an houre or two after her husband, on the twelfe of February ſhee ſubmitted her necke to the axe. When ſhe was conducted from the place of her impriſonment to the place of her ſuffering, the Lieutenant of the Tower deſired her to vouchſafe him ſomething or other which might ſerve as a monument to him, wherby to remember her; wherupon ſhe demanded writing tables, and therin writ three ſhort ſentences in Greeke, Latine, (in which languages ſhe was admirably skilled) and Engliſh, wherin ſhe ſignified her innocence; and although ſhe confeſſed ſhe had committed

an errour, which deſerved death, yet ignorance might among men without preiudice to the Lawes ſufficiently excuſe it. At laſt ſaluting the people as ſhe went, with a countenance ſetled and void of feare, and commending her ſelfe to their prayers, ſhe came to the place of execution, leading FECNAM by the hand, whome ſhe kindely embraced, ſaying, God I beſeech him abundantly reward you for your kindeneſſe toward me, although I muſt needs ſay it was more vnwelcome to me, then my instant death is terrible. Then having to the Aſſembly in very modeſt language diſcourſed of her action, ſhe ſaid,
                     J am condemned, not for having aſpired to the Crowne, but becauſe J refuſed it not being offered: and ſhall ſerve for a memorable example to poſterity, that Innocence excuſeth not great miſdeeds, if they any way tend to the deſtruction of the Weale publique; for he hath abundantly plunged himſelfe in ill, whoſoever even perforce hath become the Jnſtrument of anothers ambition.
                     Having ſpoken thus much, and implored God's mercy, by the helpe of her Gentlewoman ſhe firſt diſrobed her ſelfe of her gowne, then her attire, and vailing her eyes with her handkerchief, laied her head on the blocke, and exhorted the lingring Executioner to the performance of his office, which he at length did, his action drawing teares from the eyes of the ſpectators, yea even of thoſe, who from the very beginning were affected to Queene MARIE'S Cauſe. This was the end of IANE, a Lady renouned for the greatneſſe of her birth, but

 far more for her vertues and excellency of wit, who ſwayed by the ambition of her Father-in-law and imperious Mother, tooke on her that fatall title of a Queene; and being preſently hurried from a Kingdome to a Scaffold, ſuffered for the faults of others, having overcome all the frownes of adverſe fortune by conſtancy and innocence.
                     Much more iuſt was that execution which within three dayes after inſued. Twenty gibbets as well for terror of others as for preſent puniſhment, being erected in divers parts of the City, on the fourteenth and fifteenth of February fifty of the Kentiſh Rebells were hanged on them. On the eighteenth of the ſame moneth, ALEXANDER BRET who drew thoſe five hundred Londoners into a revolt from the Duke of Norfolke, was with a multitude of others (wherof many were of the Gentry) ſent into Kent, there to vndergo exemplary puniſhment. On the twentieth of February, foure hundred of the ſame crew with halters about their neckes, were preſented before the Queene, all humble ſuppliants on their knees, whome the Queene pardoned, and commanded their preſent liberty.
                     
                        The Duke of Suffolke beheaded. On the three and twentieth of February, HENRY GRAY Duke of Suffolke Father to Lady IANE, having beene condemned on the ſeventeenth of the ſame moneth, was publiquely beheaded: a man whoſe facility to by-practiſes had occaſioned all the troubles wherwith this Raigne had hitherto beene diſtracted; whoſe raſh ingratitude (the Queene having once pardoned him beyond expectation) diverted the current of the Queenes clemency toward his Daughter, and brought him to a deſerved end.
                     
                        Wiat executed.
                         The next turne was WIAT'S, and that on the

eleventh of Aprill. Who vpon a kinde of promiſe of pardon, if he would detect the reſt of the Conſpirators, ſuborned (as is conceived) by ſome malevolent perſons, among the reſt traduced yong COVRTNEY, as that having beene refuſed by Queene MARY, he aſpired to marry the Lady ELIZABETH, to depoſe the Queene, and ſo to raigne as it were in the right of his wife. This accuſation had procured their commitment, the Lady ELIZABETH'S on the eighteenth of March, COVRTEY'S on the twelfe of February. But WIAT finding himſelfe deluded, and being toucht with the horridnes of ſo treacherous an accuſation, going to the place of his execution, deſired the favour of a few words with the Marquis of Exceſter, which was granted him. Of the Marquis he on his knees craved pardon for that irreparable iniury which he had done him, not out of malice, but deſire of life. The Sherives of the City, with many others were then preſent, and after teſtified the certainty of this acknowledgement. But the Biſhop of Wincheſter Lord Chancellor (who out of feare of change of Religion if Queene MARY dying, ELIZABETH ſhould come to the Crowne, was content to lay hold on any occaſion to cut her off) affirmed in the Star-chamber, and therto cited the teſtimony of the Lord Chandois, that WIAT a little before his death exhorted the Marquis to acknowledge his crime, and to ſubmit himſelfe to the Queenes mercy. But what apparance of truth can there be in this, it being certaine, that WIAT having aſcended the fatall ſcaffold, ſeeing the inſtruments of death before his eyes, and having compoſed himſelfe for another world, did with ſincere proteſtations and religious aſſeverations acquit the Lady ELIZABETH and the Lord COVRTNEY from being any the leaſt way conſcious to his practiſes?
                     
                        
 On the ſeven and twentieth of Aprill, Lord THOMAS GRAY
                           and Lord Thomas Grey. was beheaded for having by perſuaſions as it were thruſt on his irreſolute brother the Duke of Suffolke to partake with WIAT in his ſeditious attempts.
                     On the ſixteenth of May the Lady ELIZABETH was removed from the Tower to Woodstock, and the Marquis of Exceſter to Foderingay, the place onely being altered, and nothing remitted of the ſtrictneſſe of their impriſonment.
                     
                        A Diſputation at Oxford,
                         About the ſame time that reverend CRANMER yet Archbiſhop of Canterbury, NICHOLAS RIDLEY lately deprived of the Biſhopricke of London, and HVGH LATIMER who ſo long ago reſigned his Biſhopricke of Worcester, were removed from the Tower to Windſore, and thence to Oxford, there ſolemnly to diſpute with the Divines of both Vniverſities concerning the Euchariſt. Their vſage was extreme almoſt beyond beleefe. Two dayes only were allotted them for their preparation; and thoſe two dayes were they in ſtraight cuſtody in ſeverall either dungeons or places little differing, debarred both the conference of any but their Gaoler, and the vſe of their owne papers and bookes. In the Schooles the behavior toward them was as barbarous as their vſage had beene tyrannicall: Shouts and outcries were the chiefeſt Arguments, many oppoſing one, without order, without manners, without modeſty. On the fourteenth of Aprill from the Priſon they were brought to S. Maries, and commanded to abjure; vpon their refuſall, a day is prefixed for publique diſpute: CRANMER'S day was the ſixteenth, RIDLEY'S the ſeventeenth, LATIMER'S the eighteenth of Aprill, each in their courſe to anſwer all Opponents; which each of them performed, &amp; that ſo, that notwithſtanding they were amaſed with rude

clamours, and diſtracted with variety of Opponents, all vrging and craving anſwer at the ſame time, although they were ſcoffed at, reviled, and overborne with multitude, yet did they force their Aduerſaries to admire them. CRANMER did learnedly, and according to the dignity wherein hee ſo many yeares flouriſhed, gravely: RIDLEY acutely and readily: LATIMER with a pleaſant tartneſſe, and more ſolidly then could be expected of a man ſo neere the age of foureſcore. The Diſputation ended, they are againe on the twentieth of Aprill brought to S. Maries, and demanded whether they would perſiſt in their opinions; vpon their reply, that they would, they were declared Heretiques, and condemnedCranmer, Ridley, and Latimer condemned.
                         to the fire. Their conſtancy was the more manifeſted by their contempt of death. LATIMER was ſcarce capable of the joy he conceived, that God was pleaſed he ſhould end his long life (whereto Nature would ſhortly ſet a period) with ſo happy a clauſe. As for their martyrdome, it falls in with the next yeare, and thither we remit it.
                     Preſently after thoſe forepaſſed tumults, the Queene ſends forth ſummons for a Parliament to begin the ſecond of Aprill. In this Parliament ſhee propoſeth two things, her Marriage and Subiection to Rome in matters Eccleſiaſticall; this laſt ſhe could not for a while obtaine, the other was aſſented vnto vpon conditions, That
                     
                        Additions to the former Nuptiall Compacts. 
                        PHILIP ſhould not advance any to any publique Office or Dignity in England, but ſuch as were Natives of England, and the Queenes Subiects: He ſhould admit of a ſet number of Engliſh in houſhold, whome he ſhould vſe reſpectively, and not ſuffer them to

 be in

                        red by Forainers: He ſhould not tranſport the Queene out of England but at her intreaty, nor any of the Jſſue begotten by her, who ſhould have their education in the Realme, and ſhould not be ſuffered but vpon neceſsity or ſome good reaſons, to go out of the Realme, nor then neither but with the conſent of the Engliſh: The Queene deceaſing without Children, PHILIP ſhould not make any claime to the Kingdome, but ſhould leave it freely to him, to whome of right it ſhould belong: Hee ſhould not change any thing in the Lawes either publique or private, the Jmmunities and Cuſtomes of the Realme, but ſhould be bound to confirme and keepe them: He ſhould not tranſport any Iewells, or any part of the Wardrobe, nor alienate any of the Revenues of the Crowne: He ſhould preſerve our Shipping, Ordnance, and Munition, and keepe the Caſtles, Forts, and Blocke-houſes in good repaire, and well manned: Laſtly, that this Match ſhould not any way derogate from the League lately concluded betweene the Queene and the King of France, but that the Peace betweene the Engliſh and the French ſhould remaine firme and inviolate: onely it ſhould be lawfull for PHILIP out of other Kingdomes

and Dominions belonging to his Father the Emperour, to ſend aides vnto him either for propelling iniuries, or taking revenge for any already received.
                     
                        Philip arriveth in England, All things being thus tranſacted, and no further impediment interpoſing betweene theſe Princes; PHILIP ſetting ſaile from the Groine on the ſixteenth of Iuly, with a good Southerne gale within three dayes arrived at Southampton with a Fleet of one hundred and ſixty ſaile, wherof twenty were Engliſh, and other twenty Flemings. Having reſted himſelfe there the ſpace of three dayes attended by a great company of the Engliſh and Spaniſh Nobility, on the fower and twentieth of Iuly being a very wet day he came to the Queene at Wincheſter. The feaſt day of S. Iames (the tutelary Saint of Spaine) was deſtined for the Nuptialls, which were celebratedand is marr

There Don IVAN FIGVEROA for the Emperor reſigned the Kingdomes of Naples &amp; Sicily, and conferred all his right thereto on PHILIP: and the Heralds proclaimed their titles in Latine, French, and Engliſh. About the beginning of Auguſt theſe two Princes came to Baſing, and thence to Windſore, where the King was inſtalled Knight of the Garter. On the eleventh of Auguſt they came to London, where the Citizens received them with moſt magnificent ſolemnity.
                     
                        Cardinall Poole comes into Englād.
                         O
                           •
                         the eleventh of November another Parliament began at Weſtminſter: about the beginning wherof Cardinall POOLE (who by King HENRY had beene proclaimed enemy to the Eſtate, was created Cardinall by PAVL the Third, had himſelfe beene Pope if he had but conſented in

 time, and in the opinion of many was thought a fit Husband for the Queene) arrived in England. Having beene put beſide the Papacy by others default more then his owne, craving leave of the new Pope IVLIVS, he withdrew himſelf to a Monaſtery in the territory of Verona called Maguzano, the Religious whereof were Benedictine Monkes, of which Order hee himſelfe while hee continued at Rome had beene Patron. Having decreed there to hide himſelfe and ſpend the remainder of his dayes, the fame of King EDWARD'S death and Queene MARY'S advancement to the Crowne, drew him againe out of the Cloiſter to Rome. He was not ignorant how MARY ſtood affected to the Sea of Rome, and therefore hoped (not without good cauſe) that IVLIVS, who much favoured him having by his delaies attained the Papacy, would ſend him into his Countrey with the honorable title and authority of a Legate. And now he fained to himſelfe a double hope of a Kingdome, if not ſecular, at leaſt Eccleſiaſticall, by vertue of his authority Legatine and the dignity of Archbiſhop of Canterbury. Queene MARY had her education for ſome yeares vnder MARGARET Counteſſe of Salisbury the Mother of POOLE (who was then a childe) and that by Queene CATHARINES meanes, who intended (as it was thought) to marry her Daughter the Lady MARY to one of the Counteſſes Sonnes, thereby to ſtrengthen her Daughters claime to the Crowne, if it ſhould happen that HENRY ſhould deceaſe without other lawfull iſſue, the Counteſſe being Daughter to GEORGE Duke of Clarence, who was brother to EDWARD the Fourth. The Cardinall, whether for this or ſome other reaſons, knowing himſelfe to be in

deere eſteeme with the Queene, was confident if not of the Crowne by marriage, yet at leaſt of all advantages of her favour. Neither was he therein deceived; for MARY having obtained the Crowne, earneſtly ſued vnto him to reſtore himſelfe to his Countrey; and the Pope, not ignorant how much he would advantage the Apoſtolique Sea, at the Queenes requeſt diſpatched him with moſt ample authority. But the Emperour having a proiect on foot for his Sonne, was ſomewhat jealous of the Cardinall: and therefore began ſeriouſly to treat with Cardinall DANDINO the Popes Legat with him, for the concluſion of a Peace betweene him and the French, that ſo he might give a ſtop to POOLE, whoſe comming into England, the Emperors affaires being not yet ſetled, might peradventure make all fly aſunder. DANDINO to gratify CHARLES, by FRANCISCO COMMENDONO ſends Letters to POOLE, adviſing him not to ſet forth as yet, foraſmuch as this Legacy vndertaken without the Emperours conſent, was diſpleaſing; and the Engliſh Nation for the moſt part, eſpecially the Londoners, did ſo hate the name of the Pope of Rome, that his Legacy would be held in contempt among them: a Legate therfore was not to be emploied vnto them, vntill perſuaſions had brought them to a better temper. POOLE having received theſe letters in his Cloiſter, thought it fitting to expect his Holineſſe pleaſure. The Pope not brooking the increaſe of the Emperors greatnes by the addition of ſuch Eſtates, and fretting that DANDINO had preſumed to ſtay the Cardinall, recalled DANDINO, and conferred on POOLE alone the Legacy both into England for the one affaire, and to the Emperour

 and the French for the treaty of a Peace. He willingly vndertaking it, preſently ſet forward from Trent, certifying the Emperour and the French of his large Commiſſion. The Emperour perceiving that theſe deviſes would be no longer availeable, ſent Don IVAN de Mendoza vnto him with letters, wherin he plainly diſcovered his feare, that the Cardinalls premature arrivall in England might prove an obſtacle to his proceedings there, which were great and hopefull: wherfore it was his deſire, that hee ſhould either there attend his pleaſure, or if hee would needs go further he might come to Liege, and there expect the event of his deſignes. The Cardinall vpon receipt of theſe letters returnes to Dilling, (not far from Trent) certifies his Holineſſe of the whole carriage of the buſineſſe, and ſends expoſtulatory letters to the Emperor, ſhewing therin what an indignity it was to the Apoſtolique Sea, that his Holineſſe Legat ſent vpon a treaty of Peace, and to reduce a Kingdome to the obedience of the Church, ſhould ſo diſgracefully, with contempt to his Holineſſe, and that by the Emperours command, be detained in the middeſt of Germany in the ſight of the enemies of the Church. That great Divine DOMINGO SOTO Ordinary Preacher to the Emperour was then at Dilling. By him hee perſuades the Emperour not to hinder this Legation, being it would ſo much hazard the eſtate of the Church, but eſpecially of the Kingdome of England. At length with much ado, and that not vntill the Emperour had intelligence, that the Articles concerning his Sonnes marriage were agreed on, hee obtained leave to come to Bruſſells, but on this condition, that he ſhould there reſide vntill the Emperour were aſſured, that the marriage betweene

PHILIP aad MARY were ſolemniſed. So to Bruſſells he came, where having ſaluted the Emperor, who received him very courteouſly, and that time might not paſſe vnprofitably, with him he begins to put in execution one part of his Legation, which was, to draw the Emperor and the King of France to ſome indifferent termes of peace. The Emperor profeſſing, that he would not reiect peace vpon any reaſonable conditions, the Cardinall goes into France, to treat with HENRY concerning the ſame thing: who made as faire ſhewes as did the Emperour; but their mindes exulcerated with inveterate hate, made all his paines fruitleſſe. HENRY at his departure embracing him, ſignified the ſorrow he had conceived, that he had not ſooner occaſion to be acquainted with his worth: for had he truly knowne him, his endeavours ſhould have beene totally for his advancement to the Papacy.
                     A little after his returne to Bruſſells, came the Lords Paget and Haſtings Embaſſadors to the Emperour from their Maieſties of England, who ſignified their joint longing to ſee the Cardinall, and therefore deſired he might be forthwith diſmiſſed, that by vertue of his authority he might rectify the Church of England wonderfully out of tune by reaſon of the Schiſme wherwith it had beene afflicted. So in September hee had leave to go for England, but was by contrary windes detained at Calais vntill November, in which moneth he at length arrived at Dover. His entertainment was moſt honorable, the Kings and Nobles alike ſtriving to manifeſt their joy. And becauſe being in the yeare 1539. by Parliament declared Enemy to the Eſtate, and by the ſame Law condemned to dy; the Eſtates then aſſembled in Parliament repealed that Act, and reſtored him to his Bloud, the Kings themſelves comming to the Houſe extraordinarily

 for the confirmation of the Act before his arrivall at London. A little after his comming, both Houſes were ſent for to the Court, where the Biſhop of Wincheſter lord Chancellor having in the preſence of the Kings and the aſſembly ſpoken ſomething concerning the Cardinalls gratefull arrivall, the CardinallCardinall Pooles Oration to the Farliament. himſelfe began a long oration in Engliſh, wherin Hee acknowledged how much he was bound to the Kings and the Estates of the Realme, by whoſe favor thoſe Lawes for his exile and proſcription were repealed, and he once more made a Native of the land: he was bound by the Lawes of gratitude to endeavour the requitall of this benefit, wherto an occaſion happily offered it ſelfe: The late Schiſme had ſeparated them from the vnion of the Church, and made them exiles from heaven; By the authority conferred on him by the Pope Saint PETER'S Succeſſor CHRIST'S Vicar, he would bring them backe into the Fold of the Church, the ſole meanes of attaining their celeſtiall Heritage. Wherefore he exhorted them ingenuouſly to acknowledge the errors of theſe later yeares, and to deteſt them, with ſincere alacrity of minde to accept of, and retaine this benefit, which God by his Vicar's Legate did proffer them. For now nothing elſe remained, but that hee being preſent with thoſe Keyes which ſhould open the gates of the Church, they ſhould alſo abrogate thoſe Lawes, which lately enacted to the preiudice of the Church, had rended them from the reſt of it's Body.
                     
                     Having ſpoken a great deale to this purpoſe, and ranſacked Antiquity for examples of our fore-fathers devotion to the Sea of Rome; his grave delivery, excellent language, and methodicall contexture of his ſpeech wrote ſo effectually in the mindes of thoſe who were addicted to Popery, that they thought not themſelves vntill this day capable of Salvation. But many of the lower Houſe, who deemed it a rare felicity to have ſhaken off the yoke of Rome, eagerly

withſtood the re-admittance of it. But by the endeavours of the King and Queene all things were at laſt compoſed to the Cardinalls liking. The authorityThe Realme freed from Interdiction. which the Popes heretofore vſurped in this Realme is reſtored, the title of Supreme Head of the Church is abrogated, &amp; a Petition drawne by the whole Court of Parliament, for the Abſolution of the People and Clergy of England from Schiſme and Hereſy is by the Biſhop of Winchester preſented to the Legate, who (they all kneeling) by the authority committed vnto him abſolved them. This being done, they went to the Chappell in Proceſſion ſinging Te Deum, and the next Sunday the Biſhop of Wincheſter in his Sermon at Pauls-Croſſe made a large relation of what had paſſed.
                     Theſe things being thus ſetled, the Queene intends an honorable Embaſſy to Rome, wherof ſhe had at her firſt comming to the Crowne made promiſe. For having reſolved to replant the Religion of Rome, ſhe had privily written to POOLE, requiring his advice therin. The Pope was therefore pleaſed to ſend into England GIOVANNI FRANCISCO COMMENDONO his Chamberlaine (afterward Cardinall) for the more perfect notice of the eſtate of the Realme. To him the Queene after much privat conference did vnder her hand promiſe obedience to the Sea of Rome, deſiring withall, that the Kingdome might be abſolved from the Interdict, for the obtaining wherof ſhe would by a ſolemne Embaſſy petition his Holineſſe as ſoone as the Eſtate was ſetled. So now about the end of this yeare the Biſhop of Ely, Sir ANTHONY BROWNE, and EDWARD CARNE Doctor of Law, are by the Kings ſent to proffer their obedience to the Sea of Rome. But theſe coſts and paines were fruitleſſe. For before they came to Rome the Pope was dead. In the meane

 time the Queene conſidering all her actions hitherto to have paſſed with full applauſe, began to treat with the Nobility, to condiſcend, that if not the Royall, at leaſt the matrimoniall Crowne of our Queenes might be impoſed on PHILIP. But it being a matter without precedent, and that might perchance to an ambitious Prince give ſome colour for claime to the Kingdome, they proved averſe, and ſhee content to ſurceaſe.
                     The next care was of reſtitution of Church lands. But HENRY had ſo divided them, and that among the Nobility, that nothing could be done therein. Only it was decreed, that the Firſt-Fruits and Tenths granted to the King by the Clergy Anno 1534, ſhould be remitted: which Decree vpon conſideration of the Treaſuries poverty, and of the many Penſions granted by HENRY to the eiected Religious Perſons, was quickly revoked.
                     
                        The Queene thought to be with childe. About the ſame time an abſurd (I might ſay ridiculous) accident happened by the Queens owne credulity and the flattery of fawning Courtiers. By reaſon of a diſeaſe, which Phyſitians terme a Mole, her belly began to ſwell: and ſome other reaſons giving her cauſe to coniecture that ſhe was with childe, ſhee not entertaining the advice of any Phyſitians, but of Mid▪wives and old women, beleeving what ſhe deſired ſhould be, affirmed that ſhe felt the ſtirring of the Embryo in her wombe. To thoſe that are affected with this malady, that fleſhy and informe ſubſtance which is termed Mola, doth ſeeme ſometimes to move, but that ſlowly, and with the generall motion of the whole belly. By this and other ſymptomes Phyſitians would quickly have diſcovered her diſeaſe, which vnleſſe very maturely prevented▪ is commonly incurable: ſo that in proceſſe of time her Liver being over-cooled, ſhe fell into a Dropſy, which as

FVCHSIVS and other Phyſitians write, doth vſually happen. But theſe flattering hopes betraied her to the laughter of the world, and to her grave. For on the ſeven and twentieth of November the Lords of the Counſaile ſent ſome Mandates to the Biſhop of London, to diſperſe certaine formes of Praiers, wherein after thankes given to God for his Mercies to this Kingdome, by giving hopes of an Heire to the Crowne, and infuſing life into the Embryo, they ſhould pray for the preſervation of the Queene and the Infant, and her happy delivery, and cauſe Te Deum to be ſung every where. Then by Parliament many things were enacted concerning the education of the Babe; and much clutter was otherwiſe kept about preparatious for the Childes ſwadling clouts, cradle, and other things requiſite at the Delivery; vntill in Iune in the enſuing yeare it was manifeſted, that all was little better then a dreame.
                     
                        Lords created. This yeare were many Barons created. On the eleventh of March, WILLIAM HOWARD was created Lord Howard of Effingam, he was Father to CHARLES Lord Admirall and late Earle of Notingham: on the fift of Aprill, IOHN WILLIAMS Lord Williams of Tame: on the ſeventh of Aprill, EDWARD NORTH Baron of Chartlege: on the eighth of Aprill, IOHN BRVGES Lord Chandois: on the fourteenth of May, GERARD FITZ-GERARD (of whome before) Earle of Kildare: and on the ſecond of September, ANTHONY BROWNE Viſcount Mountague: And in September deceaſed THOMAS Duke of Norfolke.

                     ON the eighteenth of Ianuary the Lord Chancellor comming to the Tower with ſix other Lords of the Counſaile ſet many brave priſoners at liberty, viz. the Archbiſhop of Yorke, Sir IOHN ROGERS, Sir IAMES CROFT, Sir NICHOLAS THROCKMORTON, Sir NICHOLAS ARNOLD, Sir GEORGE HARPER, Sir WILLIAM SENTLOW, Sir GAWIN CAREW, Sir ANDREW DVDLEY the Duke of Northumberland's Brother, WILLIAM GIBS, CVTBERT VAVGHAN, HARINGTON, TREMAINE, and others. The Archbiſhop having married a Wife, was deprived, and NICHOLAS HEATH ſometimes Biſhop of Worceſter, but deprived by King EDWARD, and (HOOPER being eiected and condemned to the fire) lately reſtored by Queene MARY, was ſubſtituted in his place. ROGERS and CROFT were afterward Privy Counſailers to Queene ELIZABETH, vnder whome they many yeares flouriſhed in great authority. THROCKMORTON (a▪ ſubtle man) was thought to have beene the plotter of WIAT'S Rebellion: his head was therefore eſpecially aimed at. But being indited, and ten whole howers ſpent in ſifting him, he by ſuch witty anſwers voided the accuſation of his Adverſary, that the Iurors found him not guilty; for which they were afterward ſoundly fined.
                     
                        Lady Elizabeth and Marquis of Exceſter ſet at liberty. About the beginning of Aprill, the Marquis of of Exceſter, and a little after, the Lady ELIZABETH were ſet at liberty. Concerning Lady ELIZABETH, it was long conſulted what courſe to take with her, wherein the reſolutions of the Papiſts were bloudily bent to make her away when any colourable occaſion

ſhould preſent it ſelfe. The Biſhop of Wincheſter vpon any ſpeech concerning the puniſhment of Heretiques, is repo

                        ted to have ſaid, We ſtrip off the leaves, or lop off the branches; but vnles we ſtrike at the Root that hope of Heretiques, (meaning Lady ELIZABETH) we do nothing. But after long ſearch into her actions, no ſufficient matter of accuſation being found, although there wanted not thoſe who ſought to perſuade the Queene, that her liberty would indanger the Queene; yet PHILIP aſpiring to the opinion of clemency, by his interceſſion toward the end of Aprill ſhe had her liberty, but ſo, that ſhe was bound to admit of into her Family Sir THOMAS POPE a Privy Counſailer, GAGE, and ſome others, who ſhould alwaies keepe watch over her actions.
                     This ſmall ſparkle of clemency was obſcured by a g

                         the fourth of February, IOHN ROGERS the Protomartyr of thoſe times was burned at London. He was TINDALL'S companion, after whoſe death fearing perſecution, hee would not returne into his Countrey, but went with his Wife to Wirtenberg, where having attained to the Germane Tongue, hee vndertooke the Cure of a certaine Church there, which he faithfully diſcharged, vntill vnder King EDWARD he was recalled from exile, by RIDLEY Biſhop of London made a Prebend of Pauls, and Lecturer there. Queene MARY having attained the Crowne, the Papiſts endeavored to affright him, and ſo to have once more forced him to a voluntary exile, commanding him not ſo much as to peepe into the ſtreets: and in this manner lived he a yeare, vntill at laſt refuſing to fly, he was impriſoned, and

 condemned to the fire; which cruell death (notwithſtanding that he was to leave a wife and ten children) he did moſt conſtantly vndergo.
                     
                        and Biſhop Hooper.
                         The like end on the ninth of February made IOHN HOOPER Biſhop firſt of Gloceſter, and then of Worceſter too, holding both Seas in Commendam, who tooke much paines about BONER'S deprivation, which thing now haſtened him to a ſtake. For as ſoone as Queene MARY was inthroned, he was ſent for to London, committed to the Tower, and condemned for an Heretique. HENRY reigning, he ſpent part of his life in Germany, where hee tooke to wife a Burguignon, and among other devout learned men, had intimate familiarity with HENRY BVLLINGER, by whome for his learning, godly and ſweet converſation he was held in d
                           •
                        ere eſteeme. After his condemnation hee was ſent to Gloceſter, there to ſuffer, where hee was thought moſt to have ſinned in ſowing ſeeds of error: He himſelfe not a little rejoicing that he ſhould by the teſtimony of his bloud confirme that Doctrine before their eyes, into whoſe eares hee had ſo often inculcated it.
                     
                        
                           Biſhop Farrar. The ſame courſe was taken with FERRAR Biſhop of S. Davids, who was brought downe frō 
                        London to his owne Dioces, there to be judged by the new Biſhop MORGAN, by whome he was condemned, and burned at Carmarden the third of March. He was a man rigid and of a rough behaviour, which procured him much trouble vnder King EDWARD, and now I beleeve proved his bane. For having been by the Duke of Somerſet advanced to that Dignity, after his death this good and learned man by his ſower behaviour drawing neere to arrogance (which with that Nation is a great indignity) raiſed againſt

himſelfe many accuſers, two whereof vnder Queene ELIZABETH became Biſhops, who after the death of the Duke of Somerſet eaſily prevailed with the adverſe Faction for his impriſonment. Being found in priſon when MARY came to the Crowne, and brought before the Biſhop of Wincheſter, he might (I beleeve) by pleaſing anſwers and a little yeelding to the ſeaſon, have honeſtly eſcaped their bloudy hands, as did many others, who having not waded too far in Lady IANE'S cauſe, nor otherwiſe given any grand affront to any of the Popiſh Prelates, by this meanes without impediment going into voluntary exile, or being taken, had their liberty eaſily procured at the interceſſion of Friends. But FERRAR according to his innate tartneſſe, anſwering freely (I will not ſay waiwardly) to his interrogatories, did ſo inrage the Biſhop of Winchester, that I do not much wonder at the hard proceedings againſt him.
                     
                        many others, Beſide theſe, ROLAND TAILOR Doctor of Divinity ſuffered at Hadley the ninth of February, LAVRENCE SANDERS an excellent Preacher, on the eighth at Coventrey, IOHN CARDMAKER Chancellor of the Church of Wells on the laſt of May at London, where alſo on the firſt of Iuly that godly and learned man IOHN BRADFORD vnderwent the tortures of his martyrdome.
                     
                        and Biſhop Ridley, and Latimer.
                         But not to go to a particular enumeration of all that ſuffered for their Faith, the number of them was almoſt incredible, the greater part whereof were executed out of BONER'S butchery. But among others we cannot omit thoſe Worthies RIDLEY and LATIMER, who having beene condemned the yeare before, were now on the ſixteenth of October conducted to execution, and at Oxford in the aſpect of the Academiques were in the Towne ditch neere Balioll Colledge tied to a ſtake and burned.

 CRANMER is reported from the higher part of his priſon to have beheld this dolefull ſpectacle, and with bended knees and elevated hands to have praied for their conſtancy of Hope and Faith, as alſo for himſelfe who was ſhortly hee knew to tread their path. But his execution was for a time deferred by the Biſhop of Wincheſters meanes▪ and that not out of pitty, but ambition, and reguard of his owne profit.

GARDINER being not ignorant of this contention, and the differences betweene them, deales vnderhand with this new Pope to honour him with a Cardinalls Hat, and to transfer on him the authority Legatine by IVLIVS conferred on POOLE. The Pope in reguard of his hatred to POOLE, eaſily condiſcended thereto, determining alſo to cite him to Rome, there to force him to acquit himſelfe of Hereſy, and to ſuffer as did Cardinall MORONO POOLE'S great Friend, whome this Pope detained in priſon as long as himſelfe lived. Hereby GARDINER well hoped to attaine to be Archbiſhop of Canterbury, the revenues of which Biſhopricke POOLE received as a Sequeſtratour, and would no otherwiſe as long as CRANMER lived. This was the reaſon that CRANMER'S execution

was deferred, to worke meanes that POOLE might not be inveſted in the Archbiſhopricke, which hee himſelfe for the former reaſons hoped to attaine. But while GARDINER was wholy intent to this proiect,Gardiner dieth.

                              •
                           ter being dead, Cardinall POOLE as yet the Pope's Legate appointed IAMES BROOKE Biſhop of Gloueester for CRANMER'S triall, foraſmuch as they iudged it vnlawfull to puniſh an Archbiſhop but by leave from his Holineſſe. IOHN STORY, and THOMAS MARTIN Doctours of Law Commiſſioners for the Queene, accompanied the Biſhop to Oxford, that the Authority Royall might countenance the Delegates proceeding. In Saint Maries Church, they had high ſeates purpoſely erected for them, BROOKE ſitting vnder the place, where the conſecrated Hoſt did vſually hang in a Pixe, beſide him ſate MARTIN and STORY, but a little lower, and CRANMER habited like a Doctour of Divinite, not like a Biſhop, was brought before them. Being told that there were thoſe who repreſented not only her Maieſties perſon, but alſo of the moſt holy Father the Pope, hee with due reverence ſaluted STORY and MARTIN, but would not ſo much as vouchſafe to caſt his eyes toward BROOKE, and that not (as he afterward confeſſed) of contempt of the man, whom hee formerly loved, but that hee might not ſeeme to acknowledge the Popes authoritie, hee having by oath to King HENRY obliged himſelfe to the contrary, eſpecially in England, where hee could make no pretence of right. Then each of them exhorted him to change his opinion, and returne to the

vnity of the Church: but hee not reguarding their admonition, they cite him to appeare within foureſcore dayes before his Holineſſe, which with her Maieſties conſent, he promiſed he would. But the Pope not expecting his comming, within twenty dayes after by letters to the King and Queene commanded him to be condemned, and committed to the Secular power. After the intercourſe of a few dayes, new authoritie is by the Pope granted to BONER Biſhop of London, and THIRLBY Biſhop of Ely for CRANMERS degradation from Orders both Presbyteriall and Archiepiſcopall and he then to be delivered over to the ſecular Magiſtrate to ſuffer for hereſie, which was accordingly performed on the fourteenth of February. Thoſe ſaintlike men, CRANMER, RIDLEY, and LATIMER, as long as they lived did by letters exhort each other to a generous conſtancie for the maintenance of the truth of the Chriſtian faith. But the other two Champions having made their way to heaven, and left him alone not plied with ſuch firme exhortations, out of deſire of longer life his conſtancy began at length to be ſhaken, and that by the ſubtilty and daily perſuaſions of a Spaniſh Frier. So being ſeduced with hope of pardon, he retracts what ever he had before written in defence of his Religion, which retractation was after printed &amp; publiſhed. But that little availed him. For whether that POOLE would not be longer excluded from the poſſeſſion of the Archbiſhopricke, or that (which ſeemes more probable) the Queenes inveterate hate and deſire of revenge for her Mothers Divorce, which could not bee otherwiſe ſatiated then with the bloud of this grave man, were the cauſe: he being now confident of life is preſently rapt to the place of execution, and there cruelly burned, where RIDLEY and LATIMER had five moneths before beene crowned with Martyrdome.

 On the day appointed for his execution, a Sermon by the appointment of the Cardinall was preached by Doctor COLE. Thither was CRANMER brought, and placed conveniently neere the Pulpit, where COLE exhorted him to a conſtancy in that faith, which hee was now content to acknowledge, and that even vnto death, which was now by the appointment of the Magiſtrate to be inflicted on him this very day. Gods wrath for the death of FISHER and MORE could not otherwiſe be appeaſed but by his bloud. But before his death, would he by a publique confeſſion teſtifie his ſincere converſion to the vnitie of the Church, hee ſhould do an act moſt acceptable to God and men. If with this vnexpected newes CRANMER were amazed, I do not at all wonder. But he recollecting himſelfe ſtood vp, and without any ſigne of feare, made a quicke Oration to the aſſembly, wherein having premiſed many things concerning morality and amendment of life, he repeates the principall points of his doctrine, briefly explaines his Faith, affirmeth, that vnder the authoritie Papall the Kingdome of Antichriſt was contained and establiſhed, and laſtly demonſtrates how much hee had offended God by the abnegation of the Truth: Hee profeſſeth therefore, that he had reſolved, that his right hand, wherewith he had ſo horribly ſinned by ſubſcribing to the doctrine propoſed by the enemies of Truth, ſhould firſt feele the ſmart of puniſhment; when hee would have proceeded to ſpeake more, the multitude of Romaniſts whoſe expectation he had ſo finely deluded, with clamors and ſcofs interrupted him, &amp; hurried him away preſently to the place of execution. There was then to be ſeene a ſad ſpectacle, and ſuch as would, I will not ſay, have extorted pittie from his very enemies, but have expreſſed teares from a flint: the chiefe Prelate of the Realme lately flouriſhing by reaſon of his power

and favour of Princes, a man of moſt holy converſation, for his age, aſpect, feature, learning, gravitie and rare guifts of minde deſervedly moſt Reverend, clad out of intent to expoſe him to mockery in an obſolete garment (for ſo had the Papiſts purpoſely arraied him) and bitterly taunted at to be dragged to death, and that death by the horrid tortures of fire. Being now faſtned to the ſtake, as ſoone as ever the flame began to aſcend, lifting vp his left hand to heaven, he thruſt forth his right hand into the flame, and there with admirable conſtancie continued it vntill it were conſumed, only once drawing it in, and with it ſtroaking his beard. At length the raging flame ſpreding it ſelfe, lifting vp his eyes toward heaven, hee cried out, Lord receive my ſpirit, and his bodie abiding as immovable as the ſtake whereto hee was faſtened, hee patiently indured the fines violence, vntill hee at laſt expired. His bodie being conſumed to aſhes, his heart was found intire and vntouch't. Had any of the Romaniſts found the like in any one of their faction, it ſhould have beene recorded for a miracle, and that miracle ſufficed to have Sainted him. Give me leave, though it be contrary to the method of Hiſtorie, to inſert a few verſes written by RALPH SKINNER concerning this great mans Martyrdome:

And PETER MARTYR'S wife, who died at Oxford, was diſinterred, and with barbarous and inhumane cruelty buried in a dunghill. To BVCER and PHAGIVS Queene ELIZABETH did afterward with great ſolemnitie reſtore their memorie and honour: And as for PETER MARTYR'S wife, ſhee cauſed her bones to be tranſlated from that vncleane place, to be reinterred in the Church, and commixed with the reliques of FRIDESWID (by Papiſts reputed a Saint) that the like occaſion of mockage might not againe be offered.

About the beginning of this yeare, arrived in England OSEP NAPEA Embaſſadour from BASILIWITZ Emperour of Ruſsia, for the Treatie of a perpetuall League betweene our Kings and his Prince. On the Scottſh coaſt hee had ſuffered wracke, and beſide merchandize of infinite value, hee loſt thoſe Preſents, which were from the Emperour deſtinated to their Maieſties. But the loſſe of RICHARD CHANCELLER was beyond all theſe ineſtimable, who being a moſt expert Pilot, firſt diſcovered the paſſage into thoſe Northerne Regions, and now more ſollicitous of the Embaſſadours ſafeguard then of his owne, this man moſt worthy of immortall memory was ſwallowed vp in the Seas inſatiate gulfe.

into the preſence of the Kings, declared the purport of his Embaſſie, and continued in London, vntill the third of May: and having then got a convenient ſeaſon, laden with guifts he ſet ſaile for his Countrey.

But by the diligence

 of NICHOLAS WOTTON Deane of Canterbury then Embaſſadour for their Maieſties with the French, all his deſignes were revealed to the Counſaile before his arrivall in England. So by the induſtry of the Earle of Weſtmerland hee was within ſix dayes taken, brought to London, and on the eight and twentieth of May beheaded, STRECHLEY, PROCTOR, and BRADFORD the next day following him but in a more due puniſhment (being drawne, hanged and quartered) whom they had followed in their treacherous attempts.

                        the inheritance of his hate to France with his Crowne, MARY could not long diſtinguiſh her cauſe from her Husband's. Wherefore on the ſeventh of Iune, the Queene ſet forth a Proclamation to this effect, that
                     
                     Whereas the King of France had many wayes iniured her by ſupporting the Duke of Northumberland and Wyat in their Rebellions against her; and that his Realme had beene a receptacle for Dudley and Aſhton, who with the privity of his Embaſſadour had in his houſe contrived their treacherous deſignes, and after their eſcape into France had beene relieby Penſions from the King; as alſo for having lately aided Stafford with ſhipping, men, money, and munition, thereby if it were poſsible to diſpoſſeſſe her of the Crowne: She gave her ſubiects to vnderſtand, that they ſhould not entertaine traffique with that Nation, whoſe Prince ſhe accompted her Enemy, and againſt whom

vpon farther grievances ſhee determined to denounce war.
                     Although theſe things were true, yet had ſhee abſtained from denunciation of warre, had not the five yeares Truce betweene PHILIP &amp; HENRY by the Popes inſtigation beene lately broken by the French, and ſo warre ariſing betweene them, ſhee would not make her ſelfe &amp; her Husband two. For the Pope having long ſince maligned the Emperour (knowing that he after the reſignation of his Eſtates to his Son PHILIP had withdrawne himſelfe into Spaine) by the Cardinall of Loraine ſtill ſollicited the French King to armes againſt the Spaniard, promiſing to inveſt him in the Kingdome of Naples. HENRY vpon theſe faire hopes vndertakes it, and MARY reſolves to aſſiſt her Husband.

                            Legantine abrogated, That MARY tooke armes in the behalfe of her Husband, Pope PAVL was much diſpleaſed. And being hee could not be revenged on her (who indeed was the ſole cauſe of our breach with France) he determined to powre out his wra hon POOLE, whom he ever hated; but now he thought he had more cauſe to manifeſt it, becauſe POOLE knowing that this war was ſet on foot by the Pope; had by letters and Embaſſadours ſought to appeaſe him, and that (though with moſt humble reverence) yet roundly and according to his conſcience. Having abrogated POOLE'S Legation, he repeales him to Rome; and for ſupply of his place hee creates one FRANCIS PETOW (a Franciſcan Frier) Cardinall and Legate, and a little after deſigned him Biſhop of Sarisbury. The Queene having intelligence of theſe proceedings, tooke eſpeciall care, that POOLE might have no notice of them, prohibiting not only this new Cardinall to enter the Realme, but all others whom ſhee ſuſpected to bring

 any Mandates to that purpoſe, &amp; with exact diligence cauſing his letters to be intercepted▪ by her Orators at Rome certified his Holineſſe what a hazard the Catholique Religion not yet fully eſtabliſhed would incurre, if he ſhould indevour the diſgrace of ſo great a man, whoſe authority had beene much available for the converſion of the Nation. But while there is this intercourſe betweene the Pope and the Queene concerning this matter, POOLE hauing ſome way or other had an inkling of it, abſtained from having the ſilv r Croſſe the Enſigne of his Legation borne before him, neither would he afterward exerciſe his authoritie Legantine, vntill by the interceſſion of ORMANETOand reſtored. the Popes Datary in England, hee was reſtored to his dignitie.
                     By this time the warre was very hot on both ſides, PHILIP beſieging Saint Quint in in Picardie with thirtie five thouſand Foot, and twelve thouſand Horſe, which number was after increaſed by a thouſand Horſe, foure thouſand Foot, and two thouſand Pioners out of England▪

                         HENRY ſome way to repaire his loſſes at Saint Quintin, reſolves an enterpriſe vpon Calais, which SENARPONT Governour of Bouloigne perſuaded him was not ſo fortified according to report, but that it might eaſily be taken. The Marſhall STROSSY having vnder the favour of a diſguiſe viewed the place, confirmed SENARPONT'S aſſurance of taking it. PHILIP whether having intelligence of HENRY'S deſignes, or elſe preſaging ſo much, had often admoniſhed the Queene to have an eſpeciall reguard to that Towne, voluntarie offering his aſſiſtance for the ſecuritie of it. But wee overwiſely ielous, leaſt PHILIP had a practice on it, it lying commodiouſly for his adioyning Netherlands, neglected both his advice and proffer. But the reality of his advice was manifeſted by the event. The Duke of Guiſe having by the King beene declared Lieutenant Generall in all his Dominions, leuying a great Armie flies ſudainly to the ſiege of Calais, before which he ſate downe on Newyeares day, and intrenched at Sandgate. Then dividing his Army into two parts he at the ſame time aſſaults Newnambridge and the Risbanke, two Forts wherein the chiefe ſtrength of that Towne conſiſted, the taking whereof would have cut of all poſſibilitie of relieving the beſieged either by land or ſea. The garriſons of each place terrified with ſo vnexpected a danger, hee at his firſt arrivall gaines Newnambridge, and the next day the Riſbanke. The French then batter the wall betweene the watergate and the priſon, not ſo much out of hope to gaine entrance that way, as to divert vs from garding that part of the Towne, where they really intended to give an aſſault. Having for a while battered that part,

and we little ſuſpecting an enterpriſe vpon the Caſtle, they ſudainly with fifteene peeces make a battery vpon the Caſtle, and continue it with ſuch fury, that the thunder of the Canon was all that day heard at Antwerp, which is diſtant from thence more then one hundred Engliſh miles. Having by that time night drew on made a ſufficient breach, and yet in reguard of the deepe dikes filled with water (wherin conſiſted the maine hopes of the defendants) not able to come to an aſſault, the Enemy with great toile and labour by a cut from thence to the ſea draw the dikes ſo low, that by that time the tide was gone out, they march not above navell high through the dikes to the wall (which wee little feared could be done) without reſiſtance: finding the place void of defendants they eaſily make themſelves maſters of the Caſtle, and had as eaſily taken the Towne, if Sir ANTHONY AGER Marſhall of the Towne had not with ſome few others made head againſt them, and forced them to retreat to the Caſtle, in which conflict that valiant Knight was ſlaine. The Lord WENTWORTH Governour of the Towne ſeeing little hopes of keeping the Towne, craved parley, which was granted; and at length yeilded the Towne vpon theſe Conditions: That the common ſouldiers and inhabitants ſhould depart without transporting or carrying away any thing with them, and that the Lord WENTWORTH with fifty others ſuch as the Duke of Guiſe ſhould appoint, ſhould remaine captives to be put to ranſon. So was Calais loſt, which had continued Engliſh above two hundred yeares:Calais yeilded.
                         neither was the ſiege long, the Enemy ſitting downe before i

                         on Newyeares day, and having it yeilded vp on Twelfe day.
                     Seven dayes after, the Duke marcheth toward Guiſnes, which Towne he tooke without any difficultie, but the Caſtle, which the Lord GRAY commanded,

 not ſo eaſily. But that and Hames Caſtle were at length taken alſo and diſmantled; ſo that of all the Kingdome of France, the greateſt part whereof was for a long time held by our Kings, and whereof HENRY the Sixt had beene crowned King at Paris, Anno 1431. nor in the Duchies of Normandie and Aquitaine, the ancient inheritance of the Kings of England, our Kings poſſeſſe nothing, but the Iſles of Ierſey and Guarneſey, which have proved loyall to vs ever ſince the Conqueſt. While the French proceeded thus in Picardie, the Queene certified thereof with great diligence prepares her Fleet to tranſport ſuccours for Calais: but contrary windes kept them backe ſo long, vntill Calais was irrecoverably loſt.
                     You ſhall not eaſily read of any action, wherein God hath by more manifeſt ſignes declared, how diſpleaſing thoſe wars are to him, which vndertaken for ambition or profit do diſſolve the publique peace: PHILIP (to begin with him) againſt whom HENRY and the Pope did moſt vniuſtly conſpire, inlarged himſelfe with a double victorie, each whereof were great and memorable. The Cardinall CARAFFA and the Duke of Paliane, who for their owne ends had perſuaded the doting Pope to throw the ball of diſcord betweene theſe Princes, were after for this very thing beheaded by PIVS the Fourth, who immediately ſucceeded PAVL. PAVL himſelfe in the meane time, the French being overthrowne at Saint Quintin was expoſed to the mercy of the Spaniard, whom he had irritated, the French being forced to withdraw his Army out of Italy. The raſh violation of the League by MARY, was puniſhed with the loſſe of Calais, and through griefe thereof (according to common beliefe) of life alſo▪ What happened to the French, who by the Pope's inſtigation firſt brake the five yeares Truce, wee have already declared. And

leaſt it might be conceived, that his loſſes at and of Saint QVINTIN were repaired by the taking of Calais, another overthrow given him within few moneths after, will take away much from the content of that victory.
                     
                        The battaile of Graueling.
                         In Iune the Marſhall De Termes (who ſucceeded STROSSY lately ſlaine) Governour of Calais, breaketh into Arthois and Flanders, with an Army conſiſting of neere about eleven thouſand men, leaving Graveling and Burburg at his backe, attempts Berghes, takes it, ſackes it, and ſo opens a way to Dunkirk, which hee alſo takes and ſpoiles; and the Countrey all about (for they feared not the French there, and the Townes which the Spaniard held thoroughout that Tract, were ill furniſhed) lying open to their mercy, they ranſacke it moſt miſerably, and march as far as Newport.
                     
                     PHILIP was affrighted with this Tempeſt, fearing eſpecially, leaſt the Duke of Guiſe then in Armes, ſhould joine with TERMES: but having intelligence that the Duke ſpent his time about Arlon and Vireton, hee reſolves to intercept the French in their returne. In this enterpriſe hee employes Count EGMOND, (his Lieuetenant generall in the Netherlands) who having ſpeedily out of the neighbour Garriſons of Betune, Saint Omer, Aires, Burburg, and others, aſſembled an Army of fifteene thouſand, puts himſelfe betweene Dunkirk and Calais. TERMES had hitherto expected the Duke of Guiſe, but vpon notice that the Countrey was vp in Armes, he ſomewhat too late bethought himſelfe of a retreate.

 Hee was now every way incloſed, and paſſage not to be gained but by dint of ſword. The French therefore valiantly charge their Enemies, and overthrow ſome Squadrons of Horſe; indeed diſpaire animated them to do wonders, and the Flemings were ſet on fire by the deſire of revenging late injuries. The Spaniſh Troupes renew the fight, which was with equall order long maintained on both ſides: in the heate whereof ten Engliſh Men of War fortunately ſailing by (for De TERMES had for his ſecurity betaken him to the ſhore, hoping that way with much leſſe hazard to have gained paſſage) vpon diſcovery of the French Colours, letThe French▪
                            overthrowne. fly their Ordnance furiouſly among the French, making ſuch a ſlaughter, that they began to give ground, were at laſt routed and overthrowne.
                     The French in this battaile loſt five thouſand. Their chiefe Commanders were almoſt all taken: the Marſhall himſelfe was hurt and taken, with D'ANNEBALT the Son of CLAVD the late Admirall, the Earle of Chaune, SENARPONT, VILLEBON Governour of Picardy, MORVILLIERS, and many others. Two hundred eſcaped to our Ships, whome they might have drowned, but giving them Quarter, they were brought Captives into England. This battaile was fought on the thirteenth of Iuly.
                     
                     The Queene deſirous by ſome action or other to wipe out the ſtaine of the ignominious loſſe of Calais, about the ſame time ſet forth a fleet of one hundred and forty Saile (whereof thirty were Flemings)

                         for Conquet, where he landed, tooke the Towne, ſacked it and ſet it on fire, together with the Abbey and the adiacent villages, and returned to his ſhips. But the Flemings ſomewhat more greedy after prey, diſorderly piercing farther into the Countrey, and reguardleſſe of martiall diſcipline, which commands obedience to their Generall, being incountred by the Lord of Ker

                     PHILIP about the ſame time lodging neere Amiens with a great Army, HENRY with a far greater attended each motion of his. They incampe at laſt, HENRY on the North of the river. Somme, PHILIP on the South of the river Anthy, ſo neere to one another, that it might be thought impoſſible for two ſuch ſpirited Princes commanding ſo great Armies, to depart without a battell. But divers conſiderations had tempered their heat. PHILIP being the weaker of the two, ſaw no reaſon why to ingage himſelfe. HENRY had an Army which had twice felt the other victorious, and was therefore loath on them to adventure his already ſhaken eſtate. Wherefore they ſo intrenched themſelves, and fortified their Campes with Artillery, as if they expected a ſiege from each other. Some moneths thus paſſed without any other exploits then inrodes and light skirmiſhes. At length they mutually entertaine a motion of peace, both of them conſidering, that their Armies conſiſting of ſtrangers, the fruits of the victory would be to the Aliens only, but the calamity and burthen of the defeat would light on the ſhoulders of the vanquiſhed, or

 (which comes all to one paſſe) of the ſubiects. Theſe motives drew together for a treaty on HENRY'S ſide, the Conſtable, the Marſhall of S. Andrew, the Cardinall of Loraine, MORVILLIERS Biſhop of Orleans, and AVBESPINE Secretary of Eſtate: for PHILIP the Duke of Alva, the Prince of Orange, RVYZ GOMES de Silva, GRANVELL Biſhop of Arras and others. Much altercation was had about the reſtoring of Calais, which the French were reſolved to hold, and PHILIP would have no peace vnleſſe it were reſtored to MARY, whom in point of honour he could not ſo forſake. But this difference was ended by the death of MARY, a little before whome on the one and twentieth of September died alſo the Emperour CHARLES the Fift, which occaſioned both the change of place and time for another Treaty.
                     
                        The Daulphin married to the Queene of Scots.
                         And if the continuall connexion of other memorable affaires had not tranſported me, I ſhould ere this have mentioned the marriage celebrated at Paris with great pompe on the eight and twentieth of Aprill, betweene the Daulphin FRANCIS and MARY Queene of Scots. But the fruits thereof were not laſting: For two yeares after died FRANCIS (the Crowne by the death of his Father HENRY having beene firſt devolved to him) and left his bed to a more auſpicious husband HENRY the eldeſt Sonne to the Earle of Lenox. Of theſe Parents was borne our late Soveraigne of ever ſacred memory, who was Nephew by his Mother to IAMES the Fift, by MARGARET the eldeſt Daughter Nephew to that wiſe King HENRY the Seventh, who, the Iſſue of HENRY the Eight being extinct, as the next vndoubted Heire, moſt happily

vnited the Crownes of England, Scotland, and Irland.
                     
                     But now at length to draw neerer home, this Autumne was very full of diſeaſes, Fevers (eſpecially quartane) raigning extraordinarily in England, wherby many, chiefely aged perſons, and among them a great number of the Clergy periſhed. Of the ſole Epiſcopall ranke thirteene died either a little before the Queene, or ſome few moneths after her. Among the reſt Cardinall POOLE ſcarce ſurvived her a day,The death of Cardinall Poole.
                         who having beene for ſome weekes afflicted by this kinde of diſeaſe, and brought to extreme weakeneſſe of body, as if he had at the newes of the Queenes death received his deaths wound, expired at three a clocke the next morning. His corps incloſed in lead, was buried in his Cathedrall at Canterbury, with this briefe Elogy on his Tombe, in ſteed of an Epitaph:

                           Depoſitum Cardinalis POLI.
                           
                        
He was a man admirably learned, modeſt, milde, of a moſt ſweet diſpoſition, wiſe, and of excellent dexterity in the managing of any affaires, ſo that hee had beene incomparable, if corrupted with the Religion of the Church of Rome he had not forced his nature to admit of thoſe cruelties exerciſed vpon the Proteſtants.
                     
                        The Queene dieth. The Queene died at S. Iames on the ſeventeenth of November ſome few houres before day. She was a Lady very godly, mercifull, chaſte, and every way praiſe-worthy, if you reguard not the errors of her Religion. But her Religion being the cauſe of the effuſion

 of ſo much innocent bloud, that of the Prophet was neceſſarily to be fulfilled in her, Bloud-thirſty men &amp;c. ſhall not finiſh halfe their dayes. For ſhe was cut off in the two and fortieth yeare of her age, hauing raigned onely fiue yeares foure moneths and eleuen dayes; wheras her Siſter, who ſucceeded her, moſt happily in a more milde gouernement ruled nine timesas long, and almoſt doubled her age. Concerning the cauſe of Queen MARIE'S death there are divers conjectures. To relate what I finde in approoved Authors, it is reported, that in the beginning of her ſickeneſſe her friends ſuppoſing that ſhe grieved at the abſence of her husband, whome ſhe ſaw ſo ingaged in wars abroad, that ſhe could not hope for his ſpeedy returne, vſed conſolatory meanes, and indevored to remove from her that fixed ſadneſſe wherewith ſhe ſeemed to be oppreſled. But ſhe vtterly averſe from all comfort, and giving her ſelfe over to melancholy, told them, That ſhe died, but that of the true cauſe of her death they were ignorant, which if they were deſirous to know, they ſhould after her death diſſect her heart, and there they ſhould finde Calais: Intimating thereby, that the loſſe of Calais had occaſioned this fatall griefe, which was thought to have beene increaſed by the death of the Emperor her Father-in-law. But the truth is, her liver being over-cooled by a Mole, theſe things peradventure might haſten her end, which could not otherwiſe be far from her, and caſt her by degrees into that kinde of Dropſy, which Phyſitians terme Aſcites. This Dropſy being not diſcovered in time, deceived her Phyſitians, who beleeved that ſhe had conceived by King PHILIP, whereas ſhe alas did breed nothing but her owne death. So mature remedies being not applied, and ſhe not obſerving a fit diet, ſhe fell into a Fever, which increaſing by little and little, at laſt ended in her death.

She lieth interred at Weſtminſter in the midſt of that Chappell which is on the North ſide of her Grandfather HENRY the Seventh his Monument, where her ſiſter Queene ELIZABETH was after buried with her, and over both by the pious liberality of that moſt munificent Prince King IAMES hath ſince beene erected a moſt ſtately Monument, well befitting the Majeſty of ſuch great Monarchs.
                  
                  
                     
                      Queene ELIZABETH, Anno 1558.
                     HAving thus briefely run over the Reignes of theſe three Princes, Queene ELIZABETH'S times in the next place offer themſelves; which deſervedly requiring a more accurate ſtile, I will here ſet a period to this worke, not ſo much with intent to pretermit them, as reſerving them for a more exact labour. In the meane time, to give ſome ſatisfaction to the Reader, I will make this ſhort addition.
                     Some few houres after the deceaſe of Queene MARY, the Eſtates then aſſembled in Parliament, on the ſeventeenth of November declared her Siſter the Lady ELIZABETH Queene, who was Daughter to HENRY the Eighth and ANNE BOLEN. Having moſt gloriouſly reigned forty foure yeares foure moneths and ſeven dayes, ſhe ended her life and Reigne on the foure and twentieth of March Anno 1603, the Crown being by her death devolved to the renouned King of Scots IAMES the Sixt, to whome it was ſo far from feeling it a burthen to have ſucceeded ſo good a Princeſſe, that never was any Prince received with greater applauſe and gratulation of his People. Many thinke their condition happy, if they exchange a CALIGVLA for a CLAVDIVS, or a NERO for a VITELLIVS or an OTHO. But that any Mortall ſhould pleaſe after ELIZABETH, may ſeeme a miracle: and is a great argument both of rare vertue in the ſucceeding King, and of a right iudgement in the ſubject. For this great Lady was ſo farre beyond example, that even the beſt Princes

come ſhort of her; and they who moſt inveigh againſt that Sexe, contend, that Woman is incapable of thoſe vertues (in her moſt eminent) Wiſdome, Clemency, Learning, variety of Languages, and Magnanimity equall to that of Men, to which I adde feruent Zeale of Piety and true Religion. But in theſe things peraduenture ſome one or other may equall her. What I ſhall beyond all this ſpeake of her (and let me ſpeake it without offence to my moſt excellent Soueraigne IAMES, the Paterne of Princes, the Mirrour of our Age, the Delight of Britaine) no age hath hitherto paraleld, nor (if my Augury faile not) none ever ſhall: That a Woman (and if that be not enough) a Virgin, deſtitute of the helpe of Parents, Brothers, Husband, being ſurrounded with enemies, the Pope thundring, the Spaniard threatening, the French ſcarce diſſembling his ſecret hate, as many of the neighboring Princes as were devoted to Rome, claſhing about her, ſhould containe this warlike Nation not only in obedience, but in peace alſo, and (beyond all this) Popery being profligated, in the true Divine worſhip. Hence it comes to paſſe, that England (which is among the reſt of it ſelfe a Miracle) hath not theſe many yeares heard the noiſe of war; and that our Church (which ſhe found much diſtracted) tranſcends all others of the Chriſtian world. For you ſhall at this day ſcarce finde any Church, which either defiled with Popiſh ſuperſtitions, or deſpoiled of thoſe Revenues which ſhould maintaine Profeſſors of the Truth, hath not laid open a way to all kinde of Errors, groſſe Ignorance in learning (eſpecially Divine) and at length to Ethnique Barbarouſneſſe. But to what end do I inſiſt on theſe or the like, they beeing ſufficiently knowne even to the Barbarians themſelves, and Fame having trumpetted them throughout the world. Which

 things when and how they were done, how bountifully ſhe aided and relieved her Allies, how bravely ſhe reſiſted, brake, vanquiſhed her Enemies, I have a deſire in a continued Hiſtory to declare, and will (God willing) declare, if I can attaine to the true intelligence of the paſſages of thoſe times, have leaſure for the compiling it, and that no other more able then my ſelfe (which I wiſh may happen) in the meane time ingage themſelves therein.
