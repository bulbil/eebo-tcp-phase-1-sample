            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               THE Iesuites being a new kinde of Sacrificers, and of mystery mungers: first in our age at Venice, of a certaine Spaniard a souldier (inriched with rapine and spoyles, without any religious restitution made of his wronges done) they tooke their off-spring. And they of that Pope Paulus the fourth were well approued, being apparantly worthy of such an Author: And therefore nothing deseruing the sir-name of our Sauiour Iesus, because they being male-content with the common commendable name of the Christians, doe vsurpe the tytle of Iesuites. Too much are they fruitefull and multiplying in our soyle of Germanie: But God wot only for the rooting out (as the swine vse) of the Cockle from the Corne, the very Tares and Darnell of all Heresies. And so to reduce wandring sheepe, wauering and lost into the soule and lap of theyr Mother Church. That no where but many of them are prepared and bent, that as soone as of one or an other forerunner any denne or starting hole is praeoccupied, by and by all the residue flocke thyther.
            A certaine Prince of ours did therefore nothing fondly after this manner iesting terme Iesuits, or rather as other

men after their deserts fitlie terme them Esauites: resemble them vnto those lice which of a secret part of the body they vse to offend, were called for their offence inginuals or Crab-lice, of which kinde euen of one, there remaining presently innumerable propagation &amp; multitudes of issue are stirring: a fit comparison for such a flocke. And not vnlike he did compare them vnto a game at Cardes in the which the gamsters like Loadam play, and bring them foorth last, that are of most price, to beate downe the aduerse party: or like the Ase of Harts at Mawe (the game is called with vs Kumstich). So the Pope with his fiue fingers, the Iesuites now at last when all is gone in Germany, sending foorth his craftes-masters of Embassage, vnto the

But I was about to name them Monkies, saue that is vnproper, yet Monkes, such as Franciscanes or other orders of the beggers, are called vnaptly Monkes, when they vse nothing else but onely a Imgring life in frequent and rich Citties, where the profit of vagrants is fruitefull, there they make their nestes neere to some Granar, like to mice or rattes: vt prodat seipsum sores: yet they differ from Franciscanes not onely in vesture or garment, shauing of their head, and in other apparrell of the body, lesse absurde and monstrous, and lesse enuied, and in hatred lesse abhominable, euen with the commons of our land.

And furthermore whether in chastitye they doe praeexcell these poore Whood-men or no, it may bee doubted (not without cause) sauing that sometimes at the Alter, whiles they missifie themselues and others with the Masse, whiles they preach in the Pulpet, whiles they teach in the chaire, then they appeare to al men to be continent.
            And moreouer if it be a braunch of chastity, voluntarily to sweare and vow a single life against God and nature, and euery man not to haue his owne wife, who then dare deny these Esauites truely to obserue chastimony?

            Neyther is it enough for these new Hypocrites to cloke themselues with this simuled and false chastety, and by it to sell themselues away in vaine ostentation vnto the foolish

credulous vulgar people. But not content with this, they defraude the Ministers of the reformed Churches, proudely and disdainefully, of their good names, as if they were incontinent and effeminate with their owne wiues, terming their children bastardes, because they fearing God doe yeelde to nature, the handy-worke of our good God obeying it in chaste matrimony, liuing married, (a remedy for that onely sinne, and an onely remedy for that sin of lust) and doe beget issue, and doe well bring them vp, and take care for their familyes, and for the most part do with great difficulty, care for them, and doe tolerate the matter with godly sorrow, while they without all oecononicall and housholde griefe of minde, or molestation of life in the commodities thereof, (without all discommodity) liue in abundance of pleasures, delicacy &amp; rioteousnes: Whence it is that necessarily must ensue (a consequent of time) that they acte these things warily and couertly, vntill time reuealing all thinges, doth also bring to open light and open shame, their misdeedes, euen as already with vs the filthy and vnciuil lustes of the Monkes, are at such a height gone vp, that they appeare to all men: wherevpon late fame of two in Polonia being Esauites, it is deliuered to vs that one of them hath brought forth a childe in their walkes: many neuer suspecting it, yea many maleuolent and back-biting our religion, haue thought it very agreeable, and recounting the condition of such a society of two and no more, and remembring the like euentes in the Monkes, especially in wandring runagates, &amp; land-leapers with their beggery, haue graunted it might be true: Neyther, yet is this rumour supplanted out of all mens mindes there from suspition: albeit by the Kinges owne edict, it was forbidden, any such wicked euent to be misdeemed of two so holy Fathers.

Meane while what do they? they indue the tender mindes of the youth of the pontificalitie, it is of corrupt religious doctrine, and corrupt loue, with hate and apostacie, of vtter forsaking of plaine and sincere truthe, which neuer after they vnlearne nor leaue: for what then thinke you of such men not feined nor coloured

            This verily is the indeuour of the sodalitie, the felowship of Esau, and of others his fellow seruants, more then diuelish, by which no more worthy nor efficient waye to depraue or ouerthrowe the doctrine of the church, could be premeditate and vsurped, because they not onely call in question, degrading certaine of the latter writers, such as Stapulensis, Erasmus, Polydorus, Capino, Caspiniarus, and others, these sometimes not reuerently reporting (like men of better note) against their pontificall and the wildes, tyrannie, pride, disdaine, and riot of their Prriests. And not resting there but in all vnrest and disquiet, they would musle vp the mouthes of the auncient Fathers, being the better sorte of the interpreters of the holy Scriptures.

consecration of a new high Priest, inwardly, outwardlye and most ridiculously to erre, and to be shamefully deceiued, in choosing without any discretion of sex a female Pope insteed of a male. For Leo the fourth being deceased, an Aedile and quaestor very industrious, (the Consultation for a successor being propounded) there was conuersing at Rome, one as it appeared, not one but two, a certaine yong man a Germaine borne at Mens, named Iohn English in Scholes, in some places and withall in Greece brought vp in erudicion. He or she, in wit, doctrine, eloquence, manners, habite, and comlinesse of body, to be admired at: at a worde, such an one, that the Primates and chiefe men there in Rome were beneuolent auditors, and did heare her in certaine Scholes where she red, there: and by their endeuours and sentence, she was preferred to the sacred Senate, designed and made a woman high Priest, in the steed of a man: so many prudent perspicuous sages, so many eyes and noses being by, yea without any admonishing of their holy spirit, so as they know not the womans sex from the mans, no not by a beard, which though it had beene rased after their owne fashion, yet me thinkes the stubbes should appeare, no not by voyce and other notes and tokens hidden and vnknowne. At last the fallacie was bewrayed in this plaine euent. In that her delicacie of licence to do what she list, lasciuious nature admitted into her embracing, eyther a Cardinall or some meaner man more familiarly, by whom she was begotten with childe. When her time was almost expired, &amp; her next neighbour the birth day was at her hand, so imprudently as a Heighfer not expert in her first calfe, on the day of their litamie and Procession (as they call it) she walked foorth, &amp; falling down in the very publique walke amongst the whole rou

This Iohn as it is affirmed was a woman. And when in her childhood of a certaine louer of hirs, shee was brought to Athens in mans apparrell, she did so profit in diuers Sciences, that no one was found to bee comparable vnto her, in so much that afterwardes shee reading at Roome openly, obtayned great Masters to be her schollers. And then in the Citty she

being of great fame by her conuersation and science, by counsell of them all, she was chosen to be Pope: But in the Papall seate by her familiar friend, shee became pregnant with childe, yet vnskilfull of the time that women recon for their birth-right: when shee was tending her iourney from Saint Peters vnto Lateran

            Now because that my Lord the Pope, dooth alwaies shunne that place, that way: it is beleeued on all sides that he doth it for detestation, and hate of that fact. Neyther is it put into the Catelogue of the holy high Priestes, as well for the sex of her womanhood, as for the deformity of so fowle a deede. These same wordes wholy in a manner are to be red in the booke of Richard the Monke of Cluniacens, the tytle whereof is, The number of the, Romane high-priestes, which is kept in the Librarie. Which words a man very honest certainely tolde vnto vs, that he saw them at that place written (being there) about sixteene yeere agoe. Richard was before Martine, and was his antecessor a hundred and fifty yeares, vpon Trithemius report.
            This same expresse and so cleare a narration of Martine, the Popes owne penitenciary, which office is not a little credite among these vaine Paper-puffed men, in which he behaued himselfe so, that for his reward, he was indued with an Archbishopricke, by the which no body could be more certaine of the Actes and Histories of the high Priestes then he might.

he but gathered these and other things too, as hee himselfe in the Proaeme, beginning his Chronicle doth well signifie? And besides that Mariane in the verie entry of his worke doth rehearse, out of whose monuments hee heaped vp this story, who were eyther all of them interred then, or else done to dust some where, or being dead, they were dismembred and lay hid, not any aliue. But if it were true that Martine was the first that euer commaunded this to writing, shall we therefore thinke it to be a fable? Many thinges certes in stories both diuine and prophane we read of, the which their owne Authors hauing heard it of olde men, their elders and betters, did first before any others comprehend it in writing.
            And should we therefore doubt in ambiguitie of the truth of all these writers and matters? Anastasins the keeper of the Librarie (they alleadge with others) in that same time suruiuers being Chroniclers, doe make no mention of Ione the woman High-priest. As though all men wished it, and as if no man, in his secret opinion and iudgment, could thinke it a thing so vnworthy of the Pontificall seate (euen at which themselues blushed) but would not be content to passe it to the sinke of obliuion in silence, to all posterity, slumber, and funerall, of such a fact. As touching certaine Greeke writers Zonaras and others, that they did decline (as the Esauites suppose) from their institute purpose, and that it was proposed by them only to handle the matters of theyr owne Emperours and Churches, and not of the Romane High-priestes, and for their hatred this cause of shame they opened.

what he had suspected to be false, he would not haue sent it for a truth in open tables, to all after times and prosperities. Out of his Chronicle written in Italian, and Printed at Florence in the yeere 1478. this I translated into Latine, in the yeare of our Lord God 855. Iohn English, helde the High Priesthood two yeares, fiue months and foure daies. The Church was vacant for one month. He is not placed in the Catelogue of the Popes, because he was a woman: who in her nonage, of a certaine louer of hers, was brought to Athens, in the habite of a man, there in diuers studies and sciences, she escaped their knowledge and did prooue excellent. After when she came to Roome, shee ascended such a height of fame, that she was had in admiration with all men, whence it happened by concord &amp; suffrage of the best, the supreame honour of a Pope was attributed vnto her. Which thing afterwardes betrayed it selfe to the world.
            
               In her time in the Citty of Brixie, three dayes and three nights it rayned meruailously blood: and in Fraunce appeared monstrous Locusts, hauing sixe winges and sixe feete, and teeth very hard, flying through the ayre admirably, which after were all drowned and suffocate in the Sea of Britaine.
                From whence the carcases of them were beaten to the shoare, and did so corrupt the ayre, that a great part of the inhabitants there dyed. This Petrarch dyed in the yeare of our Sauiour Christ, 1374.
            
               Iohn Bocace inwardest friend to Petrarch, both for his wit and for his similitude of study, and manners, an other he, doth rehearse this Ione, and describe her, first called Gilberta, as he saith in his booke of noble women, Chap. the 99. which in these words he concludeth. To detestation of whose filthy whood, and contynuance of memory of her name, euen vnto this day, the chiefe Priestes of the Rogation, with the rest of the Clergie, and people going to doe Sacrifice, they abhorre that place of her child, borne

in the middest of her iourney, and omitting it, they decline thorough by waies, and streetes, and so that detestable place spurned at, reentring home, they end theyr iourney which they began.

            But it is no more absurde, that such a Pontificall should confound the order of history, then that Pontifex puer pera, the woman Pope, with his Feminine name and nature shoulde disturbe all the Rules in Grammer.
            In the antique Chronicles (Augustiano) written in Latine hand I red this. Furthermore not farre from that tempestious tyme of the yeare of our Sauiour Christ 855▪ there was at Roome a Pope Iohn the eyght, named (qui mulier) a hee woman, yea that filthy harlot Gilberta of Mens, ledde about in mans apparell: of a certaine Monke of the Monasterye of Fulda, both thorough Greece and Italie, a beast moste littered, I would say lettered, and moste learned, moste changeable and crafty, Camelion like; escaped out, and indued with a Pope-doome, inscaped in the Citty likewise.
            
               Raphaell Ualaterane in his Commentaries, Dedicated to the verie Pope Iulius the second, was not afeard to write thus of Iohn: Iohn Englishe whome they call a woman, in her desembling habite, otherwise most famous for learning, they say was ouertaken in the way, where shee brought foorth a Childe.
            Now let vs produce Platina: who albeit hee had tryed the cruelty, and seueritie of the Pope Paule the second towardes him: yet hee feared not to write of Ione vnto Sextus the fourth, which story now as vaine these pield fellowes doe reprooue, so farre were they from indyting

            Touching the first of these obiections, I wil winke at it: for the second thus I thinke. That Seate to be prepared to this ende, that he that is constitute, and ordained in such a Magistrates place (for Magistracy wil soone shew what a man is) may know himselfe not to be a God, but to bee subiect to the necessities of nature: as for example, digestion and such like, whence the seate is called meritoriously A close stock, this that I haue said is commonly carried about, but by vncertaine and obscure Authors, which I therefore instituted, to set downe briefly, and barely, least obstinately and frowardly, I should seeme to omit, that which almost all men affirme. Let vs erre therfore with the multitude, in this matter: albeit it may appeare that this that I haue said, is out of those things, which may be, by possibility beleeued to be true. Hitherto Platina, whose latter words, whiles he saith fieri potuisse, do manifest why he said Erremus cum vulgo, least God wot, hee should offend his Lords in affirming the story directly. But the cause of the Popes declining the way, he confesseth to bee the young childe of the woman High-priest.

This Booke is imprinted in Latine at Venice Anno 1503. and there also in Italian, in the yeare of our Lord God 1540.
            The like things are red in Mathew Palmers continuation of Eusebius and Prosperus, which beginneth at the yeare 449. and endeth in the yeare 1471. The exemplarie was Printed at Basill 1549. neyther doe they differ from this, which of this Pope the Duke of Genua calde Baptista Fulgosus, of the same age that Palmer was of, noted in his Booke of Memorable sayings and deeds, set foorth at Basil in the yeare 1541.

And for that many would not place her amongst the Popes, as it were abhorting the vnworthy fact.

He in a Catalogue of the Priests, strictlie dooth note Ione in these words: Iohn English of Mens was a woman belying her owne sex, with an acute wit, with a prompt tongue, learnedly she could speake, in so much that she conuerted all mens mindes towards her, to the intent that she should obtaine the pontificall seate onely, one seruant had secret intelligence of her sexe, by himself made pregnant, compressed, it is said she brought forth at the Colossis, in the 2. yeare not expired of her raigne, in childe-birth she dyed.
            
               Carthusiane the Author of the Fardell of times (as the wiser sorte doe iudge) not to bee contempned, placed Ione without the number of the Popes, with this description. That Iohn English by Syr-name, but by birthe of Mens▪
                is sayde to bee about those times, and she was a woman cloathed in habite of a man.
            
               She did so proceed in diuine scripture
                  •
               , and profit withall, that none was found like vnto her, she was chosen to be Pope. But after being made pregnant with childe, when publiquely she should proceed in procession, she was deliuered and dyed. And this seemeth to be the sixt Pope that had the name of sanctitie without any desert to this daye. And like others of them (obserue the veritie of this man) she was plagued &amp; not placed in the Catalogue of Popes. Some trifle in this cause, that no Almaine should be chosen Pope, which appeareth to be false for Carthusiane the Monke dare say, yea that before Ione and before our age 800. yeares, there were wicked Popes, and well worthye the infamie of Ione. The same thing in this Esauiticall age a man, may say of Popes much more wicked then these were both Horrible, blaspheming, and heresie, worthye of fire and fagot.

He in his foorth volume of Antiquarie lections, numbering learned women nameth Ione, what saith he? doe not we know that in Chronicles it is resolued: that Ione English onely from the beginning of the world alone, in the forme of a man, durst inuade the seat Pontificall of Rome, in the shape of a man, Yea verilie, and admit one of her familiars, who onely inwardest, hit nayle on the head, knew the matter and the manner, was admitted vnto the bed and chamber, therfore vnto the bed chamber, and then shee with childe in the summe of dignitie and disdainfulnes, trauailed with child? This was done in the yeare of health, eight hundred, fiftie three. There is more fidelitie to be attributed to this man, yea and an Italian too, his testimonie, his affirmation more this matter, then to all the inficiation, all the deniall of the Esauites, which Parasites and hierlings will doe any thing to demerite the altar, and say any thing for their Lorde and maister.

            The Chronicle of Martin in Germany restored, reteineth the very same altogether, which is in the Latine. The exemplarie hand writing that I haue seene, is absolute in the yeare 1429. distinguished, and lined with titles euerie where.

            An other written at Constance with the proper language of the Heluetians, pertaining vnto the yeare 1400. saith, Ein Weib hiesse Ioannes von Mens was Bapst, &amp;c. A woman called Iohn of Mens was Pope, who dyed with child-birthe, which a Cardinall got in the yeare of our Lord 855. Iahre.
            
            
               And in another with somewhat greater Characters. Printed at Ulmes in the yeare 1486, there you may read Der Keyser Arnolphus (it seemeth it should be red Lotharius) when Casar or Emperour Arnolphus there was in that time a Pope that was a woman, &amp; in the open streets of Rome there shee laide her yong one. This was such a shame to the Popes, that they shunne to come any more that waye. This Chronicle dooth ende in the ouerrunning of Mens in the yeare 1462.

            Amongst the writers of the Actes and Iestes, one hath escaped mee, The Compiler of the Anonymies, that is, without names, in whome this is read. There was likewise an other false Pope, whose name and yeares are not knowne, for shee was a woman, as the

Romaines doe confesse, and of elegant fame and of great science, and in hypocrisie of wonderfull life: she vnder pretext of a mans habit, lurked, vntill she was chosen to be Pope, and in her Popehood conceiued with childe, and when she was great, the diuell in Consistorie court, publiquely before them all bewrayed the deede, exclaming Papa pater patrum▪ papissa pandite partum. To these aboue mencioned, and the like, or to the very same, their owne Isengrine dooth mention of this Pope, in his Chronicle of two Languages, euen in the kingdome of the Esauites, set foorth with Grace and priuiledge of the Caesars Maiestie, in the yeare of the Lorde 1564 whom their familiar friend, with what cauilations, or with what foyson or colour they could refute, saluing his estimation and honour, that he might not be offended (if he were liuing) they should perceiue it well enough.
            Now therefore the verdit followeth: Let indifferent readers and arbitrators giue sentence. Whether of so manie Histories, by so many worldes continued and consented, we must beleeue the affirmatiue of them, or the infection and negatiue of a few Freshmen, hyred as it appeareth therevnto, and whose profession it is by all wayes and meanes, with all force and pollicie, where the pontificall dignitie lyeth ouerthrowne, to raise it vp, where it is readie to flide (that is euery where) to vnderprop it, and for the most parte (Gentle Gentlemen) those whome I haue induced were Historians, Priests, Monkes, or otherwise sworne to the Pope, or bound to him. Yet notwithstanding, looke what was comelie for a storie, they remembred, which of their Auncestors rather they heard, or of theyr superiours in Bookes worthy of note and remembrance, and fit for all posteritie, they thought well of, that they brought into their bookes and volumes of greatest account and authoritie without all respect of persons,

nothing then fearing the offence of the potentate, who (it may be thought) was nothing offended with this verity. No man euer before this time did deny this history, no man tooke it greeuously, no man contradicted it, no man call it in question, it being Dedicated to the very Popes themselues to the Cardinals, to the Abbots, by the Authors of this story. And these for the most part were Italians, neighbours to the great Pope, and therefore more worthy of our beleefe in this, for that they might sooner and easier get notice of these matters, then other strangers, both by the relation and report of theyr seniors, as also by the Lybraries neare at hand.

               Laurentius Valla no stranger, but borne in the Citty of Rome a Canon, his reprehension of Popes of his time as liberall, so true and very true, that if you deny it, yet we and many other, neyther haue doubted nor euer will doubt. I say, (quoth he) and I exclaime (neither will I feare men being

accustomed with God) not one in my time, in the Pope-doome, was eyther faithfull dispensator of the misteries, or wise, who are so farre from giuing bread, that they giue a baite vnto the familie of God. The Pope himselfe, now wars is pacified, doth bring in warre vpon his owne people, and soweth discord betwixt the Citties and the Princes. The Pope both thirsteth after other mens goods, and suppeth vp his owne treasures. The Pope maketh profit, not onely of the common wealth, but also of the Ecclesiasticall wealth, and selleth the holy Ghost. And when he is warned of this, he denieth it not, but openly confesseth it, and glorieth in it, that it is so lawfull for him, vpon any reason to make sale of the patrimony of the Church, endued and giuen him by Constantine, to wrest it from any the occupiants of it. As if it would come to passe that it so being vsed, the Christian religion, would thereby become more blessed by it, and not rather as it is more cursed with all wickednes, luxuriousnes &amp; libidiousnes oppressed, if possibly it may be more oppressed, and if any farther place of misery be remaining. Thus Ualla feared not out of a Godly stomacke, all perill neglected to exprobate the papacy, to hit thē in the teeth in his time, now 1140. yeares ago, so vncorrected euer since▪ that dayly it is made worse and worse, and worse is like to be.

and whose endeuor it is, to amplyfie their priuate wealth to heape vp monie, and in feeding their carcases, to be well occupied, and yet whereas too too wretchedly they are couetous, yet no men eate more daintilye, nor clothe themselues more wantonlie then they do. Of late a priest a Cardinall sent his Cator to buie a Woolfe fish, or a Pike, and because he spared the money it being deare, for the price was three score crownes. O with what reproche did he reuile him, and had almost forbidden him his house as a seruant nothing carefull of his maisters life. And Charon, that you should not mistake me, they terme that life now, which heretofore was called death, the appetite. An other priest also of the same Colledge dying, bequeathed vnto a
