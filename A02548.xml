            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            TO THE MOST REVEREND FATHER IN GOD, AND MY MOST HONORED Lord, GEORGE, Lord Archbiſhop of CANTERBVRIE, Primate of all England, and Metropolitan, one of his Maieſties moſt Honourable Priuie Counſaile.
            
               MOST REVEREND FATHER, and no leſſe honored Lord,
               
            
            
               IT was my deſire and hope to ſpend the reſidue of my Time and thoughts in ſweete and ſacred Contemplation. Satan enuying me this

happineſſe, interrupts me by the malice of an importune Aduerſary. Twelue yeeres agoe I wrote a little Apologeticall Letter for the Marriage of perſons Eccleſiaſticall; and now thus late, when I had almoſt forgot that I had written it, a moodie Maſſe-prieſt drops out a tedious and virulent Refutation; thorow my ſides ſtriking at the moſt Honourable, and flouriſhing Clergie of the whole Chriſtian World; labouring not ſo much for my diſgrace (what would that auaile him?) as the diſhonour and ſcorne of our holy Profeſſion, in the eyes of our people. I could contemne it in ſilence, if the Quarrell were only mine; Now my wrong cannot bee diſtinguiſhed from thouſands: God and his Church are ingaged in this cauſe, which in my foile could not but ſuſtayne loſſe; neither may I be now ſilent with ſafetie, without miſconſtruction. Let this hand and Tongue bee no longer mine, then they may ſerue my Maſter in Heauen,

and his Spouſe on Earth. That which I wrote in ſome three houres, he hath anſwered in three quaternions of yeeres; and what I wrote in three leaues, he hath anſwered in no fewer Pages then 380. Should I follow him in this proportion, hee might after ſome Centuries of yeers expect an anſwere in Tostatus-hydes; whoſe firſt word ſhould be, Quis leget haec? Or if my patience would delay my reply to the iuſt paces of his anſwere, this Volume of his would perhaps▪ bee vaniſhed into Groſſers ſhops for waſte Paper in thuris piperiſue cucullos; and would no more need anſwere then now it deſerueth one. But hearing of the inſultation of ſome Popiſhly affected, who gloried and triumphed in this ACHILLES pro Catholicis, I addreſſed my ſelfe to the Worke, with no little indignation, and no leſſe ſpeed: That my ſelfe-conceited Aduerſarie, and his ſeduced abettors may ſee how little a well-ordered Marriage is guiltie of deadding our

ſpirits, or ſlacking our hands; at the beginning of this Summers Progreſſe, when it pleaſed his ſacred Maieſtie to take notice of this ſorrie Libell, and to queſtion with mee concerning it, I had not ſo much as read it ouer; ſo newly was it come to my hands, ere his happie returne, (bee it ſpoken to the only glorie of him that inabled me) I had not only finiſhed this Anſwere, but twice written it ouer with my owne hand; and yet made this but the recreation of the weightier buſineſſes of my Calling, which now did more then ordinarily vrge me.
            It was my purpoſe to haue anſwered (as beſeemeth the perſon à quo, not ad quem) mildely, according to my knowne diſpoſition, but vpon better deliberation, I found the inſolencie of my Refuter ſuch, that I could not fauour him, and not bee cruell to my cauſe. If therefore for many (it is his owne art and word) railatiue Pages, hee receiue from my vnwilling and enforced

Pen now and then, though not a Relatiue to ſuch an Antecedent, yet perhaps ſome drop of ſharper Vineger, then my Inke vſeth to bee tempered withall, hee may forgiue mee, and muſt thanke himſelfe: What needed this cauſe ſo furious an Inuectiue? As if the Kingdome of Heauen, and all Religion conſiſted in nothing but Mayden-head, or Marriage? Cardinall Bellarmine, when hee ſpeakes of the Greeke Church, wherein a marryed Clergie is both allowed and required, ſhuts vp moderately; That if this were all the difference betwixt them, and the Romane Church,Si errorem alium non haberent,

                they ſhould ſoone bee at peace. If my Refuter had ſo thought, this had not beene his firſt Controuerſie: Both eſtates meete in Heauen. Iohn the Virgin reſts in the boſome of marryed Abraham; This inordinate heate therefore of proſecution riſes from faction, not from holy Zeale: Hence it was that my Aduerſary cunningly ſingled out this point from many others,

ranged in my poore Diſcourſes, as that wherein (by Biſhop Iewels confeſſion) hee might promiſe to himſelfe the likelieſt aduantage of Antiquitie; and how gloriouſly doth he vaunt himſelfe in the oftentation of Fathers and Councels! which vaine flouriſh how little it auayles him, the proceſſe ſhall ſhew; where it ſhall appeare vpon what grounds no ſmall piece of Antiquitie was partiall to Virginitie, and ouer-harſh to Marriage,B.

                amids the throng of their late Tridentine Councell, and it is worth the while to obſerue on what grounds it receiued a repulſe. If Prieſts ſhould be allowed Marriage (ſay thoſe wily Italians) it would follow that they would caſt their affections on their Wiues and Children, and conſequently on their Families, &amp; Countries, whereupon would ceaſe that ſtrait dependance, which the Clergy hath vpon the See Apoſtolike; In ſo much as to grant their Marriages, were as much as to deſtroy the Hierarchie of the Church, and to reduce the Pope within the meere bounds of the Romane Biſhopricke. This was the plea of the Clergie; their thriftie Laitie, (together with them) enemies to the bleſſing, (or, as they conſtrue it, the curſe) of fruitfulneſſe, are wont to plead, Troppo teſte: our Gregorie Martin of old computes the preiudiciall increaſe

that might ariſe from theſe Marriages to the Commonwealth. It is not Religion, but wit that now lyes in our way. Fond men that dare thus offer to controll the wiſdome of their Maker, and will be tying the GOD of Heauen to their rules of ſtate. As it is, no Church in the whole World (except the Romane) ſtands vpon this reſtraint, whereof the conſequences haue beene ſo notoriouſly ſhamefull, that wee might well hope, experience would haue wrought, if not redreſſe of their courſes, yet ſilence of ours. And ſurely, if this man had not preſumed that (by reaſon of the long diſcontinuance of Popery) time had worne out of mens mindes the memory of their odious filthineſſes, he durſt not thus boldly haue pleaded for their abominable Celibate; The queſtion whereof, after all buſie diſcuſſions, and pretences of age, muſt bee reſolued into no other then this, How farre the Tradition of a particular Church is worthy to preuayle againſt

Scripture: yea, and againſt other Churches. A point, which a very weake iudgement will bee able to determine.
            In this returne of my Defence, I doe neither anſwere euery idle clauſe, nor omit any eſſentiall: This length of mine is no leſſe forced then my Aduerſaries continencie: wherein yet my Reader ſhall not ſigh vnder an irkſome loquacitie. I preſume to dedicate this vnworthy labour to your Grace, whome this famous Church daily bleſſeth, as her wiſe, faithfull, and vigilant Ouerſeer, as a renowned Patterne of holy Virginitie, and Patrone of holy Marriage. The GOD of Heauen (whoſe watch you carefully keepe) preſerue you long to his Church; and make vs long happie in your Grace, and you euer happie in his plentifull bleſſings. Such ſhall euer be the Prayers of

            THE ANSWERE TO the Aduertiſement.
            
               THE man beginnes with a threat, I may not but tremble; He frights me with an vniuerſall Detection of my errours. It is almoſt as eaſie to find faults, as to make them. Perhaps the Time had bin as well ſpent in toſsing of his Beades: How happie a man am I that ſhall ſee all my ouerſights? My comfort is, that if my Tree were fruitleſſe, there would be no ſtone throwne at it. In the meane while, how well doth the title of a Detector become him that hides himſelfe? If he be not afraid or aſhamed of his cauſe, let his name be known that his victories may be recorded. It is an iniurious and baſe aduantage to ſtrike and hide; and after a pitch't Duell to gall a fixed Aduerſary out of loop-holes. If his perſon bee vpon ſome

treaſonable act obnoxius, it is hard if ſome of his names be not free: But if I muſt needs bee matcht with the ſhaddow of a Libeller, I will ſo take him, as he deciphers himſelfe: C. E. Cauillator Egregius; and vnder this true ſtile of his, am readie to incounter him, and doe here bid Defiance to an inſolent, and vniust Aduerſary: And firſt let mee tell my Cauiller, this order is prepoſterous. If all my errours be at the mouth of the Preſſe, how is it that two or three of them are thus ſuffered to out-runne their fellowes? Was his malice ſo bigge with theſe, that it could not ſtay the time of the common deliuerie? Needs must they be notorious falſhoods, that are thus ſingled out from the rest. Let them appeare in their owne ſhapes, vgly, (doubtleſſe) and prodigious.

The firſt is, That moſt ſhameleſſe aſſertion that Bellarmine vnder his own hand acknowledges, 237. Contrarieties of Doctrine amongſt his Catholikes. Could the man but haue patience, he ſhould finde aboue three hundred: What ſayes my

Detector to this? Hee hath not ſeene the ſeuerals, yet (like a braue man at Armes) he profeſſes to kill his enemy ere hee can appeare; and tels vs thoſe 237. Contrarieties, are nothing but 237. lyes in one aſſertion. That there are in them ſo many vntruths I eaſily grant; for in Contradictions one part muſt needs be falſe; and Truth is but ſingle: They are vntruths then, (lyes are too broad a word) but their owne. My aſſertion ſhall only iuſtifie that they are told; let him take care for the reſt: But they are not in points belonging to Faith and Religion,
               Obiect. 
               only in matters vndecided, and diſputable; The ſequell ſhall try that ſhift;Sol. Why doe wee fore-ſtall our Reader? Who knowes not that there cannot bee ſo many points fundamentall? Let him take them as they are, I aggrauate nothing; It is but only in ſuch light chaffe, as this; In the number and extent of Bookes Canonicall, wherein DRIEDO, ERASMVS, GENEBRARD, CAIETAN, SIXTVS SENENSIS are acknowledged to oppoſe the reſt; In

the Popes infallibilitie of iudgement, wherein GERSON, ALMAYNE, Pope ADRIAN, ECKIVS, HOSIVS, PIGHIVS, WALDENSIS are at quarrell; In the reach and originall, of ſpirituall iuriſdiction, wherein ABVLENSIS, TVRRECREMATA, FRAN. A VICTORIA, ALPHONSVS DE CASTRO, &amp;c. proclayme to differ: what ſhould I inſtance in more? It is but in the Popes power in Temporalties, in the inerrableneſſe of Councels, whether particular confirmed by the Pope or Generall; in the authoritie of Councels aboue Popes, in the force of Vowes, in the worſhip due to Images, and the like. Theſe and ſuch other are the ſlight Trifles (ſince all cannot bee weightie) impertinent to faith, wherin the Romiſh Doctors varie.
            Neither doth my aſſertion of their diſcord gall him more, then of our Vnitie: O the fore-head of Heretikes! I ſaid that we in our Church differ only in Ceremonies, they in ſubſtance. Let him giue leaue to the contra-diuiſion
               
of theſe two, and I will take leaue to maintayne the indiuiſion of the Church of England, in the dogmaticall points of Faith.
            This boldneſſe, together with my eminent ignorance, makes him admire the ſcarcitie of learned men in our Countrey, that could finde no better Doctors to ſend to Dort-Conference then Master HALL. To your griefe, Sir, it was a Synode, and that noble and celebrious; Neither was it out of want that your ſilly Aduerſarie was ſent thither. This happie Iland (which hath no blemiſh but that it yeelds ſuch Vipers as your ſelfe) abounds (as you too well know) with ſtore of incomparable Diuines; ſuch as may ſet your Rome to ſchole. So, as the Meſſengers of PYRRHVS long ſince called your Italie, a Country of Kings,
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . and Egypt was wont to be called the Countrey of Phyſicians, ſo may this bleſſed Iland of ours iuſtly merit the title of The Region of DIVINES. For me, I can be content to bee baſe enough in mine owne eyes, but if my

diſparagement ſhall redound to my betters, I dare tell him it is my comfort, that I was ſent thither by a iudgement no leſſe infallible, then of PAVL the Fift. Let himſelfe or any of his Eaues-dropping companions (to whom that place ſtood open) ſay wherein I ſhamed thoſe that ſent me.

               for an auoucher of theſe Coozenages, who dares auerre that his fellow Xauier, not only healed the Deafe, Dumbe, and Blinde, but rayſed the Dead, to which I adde (whiles his Brother Acoſta, after many yeeres ſpent in thoſe parts, can pull him by the ſleeue, and tell him in his eare, ſo loud that all the World may heare, Prodigia nulla producimus.) This is my Indictment; Let me come to my Tryall: Caſt mee, if yee can, yee reuerend heads; I craue no fauour. Where lyes this ſo lewd lye, and malicious abuſe? That BELLARMINE ſayes thus of the Ieſuite XAVIER is not denyed; That ACOSTA ſayes thus of himſelfe, and his fellow Ieſuites, is granted; The firſt lye yet is, ACOSTA was neuer in the Eaſt-Indies at all, nor XAVIER in the Weſt; and how then could ACOSTA ſpend many yeeres in thoſe parts? A perilous Plea! Who euer, I beſeech you, mentioned either Eaſt or Weſt? I ſpake of the Indies in common; ſo did his BELLARMINE, from whom I

cited this,Bell. de notis Eccleſ. l. 4. c. 14.
                
               Claruit etiam in Indijs omni genere miraculorum, &amp;c. Here is not one of the Indies mentioned, but both or either; If both liued in the Indies, though not in one Towne, in one Countrey, in one Indie; wherein haue I offended; whiles ſpeaking of the Indies in generall, I ſaid that XAVIER and ACOSTA liued there? Yet this is one lye (he ſaith) and that ſo long a one, as that it reacheth as far as it is from the Eaſt to the Weſt, from the Artick to the Antarctick Pole; wherein I doubt not but your reuerences will eaſily marke the skill of this learned Coſmographer. Some parts of thoſe inſtanced Indies differ not ſo farre; not to ſpeake of the ſmall ſtrait of Anian; the mentioned Region of Mexico is not aboue foure-ſcore degrees from Iapan: Either your conſtruction must fauour him, or elſe this muſt goe into the Booke of ouerſights.
            The ſecond lye is, that ACOSTA pulled BELLARMINE by the ſleeue in this aſſertion, as if hee denyed thoſe

               Eaſterne Miracles, which hee elſewhere confeſſeth. Indeed, this ſaucines were dangerous. The red Hat (you ſay) is fellow to a Crowne. But ſhall I confeſſe where I erred? My dull head could not conceive that God ſhould bee the God of the Mountaynes; and not of the Valleys; Of the Eaſt-Indies, not of the Weſt; and yet be the Ieſuites God in both: Eſpecially,Ioſ. Acoſta l. 2. de ſal. Ind. c. 9.
                ſince the reaſon that IOSEPH ACOSTA fetches from the perſons (which ſhould be the ſubject of thoſe Wonders) holds as equally for both Indies, as an Almanack made for the Meridian of one Citie, ſerueth the Neighbours.
            Hitherto then the Prologue of my infamous falſhoods, ſuch, as if all my Writings could haue afforded any equally haynous, theſe had neuer beene choſen out to grace the front of his Detection; There muſt needes bee much terrour in the ſequell.
            The rest of this ſtorme falls vpon our learned Profeſſor, Doctor COLLINS; one of the prime ornaments of our Cambridge; the partnerſhip of

whoſe vniuſt diſgraces doth not a little hearten my vnworthineſſe. The World knowes the eminencie of that mans Learning, Wit, Iudgement, Eloquence; His Workes prayſe him enough in the Gate; Yet this Malapert Corner-creeper doth ſo baſely vilifie him, for ignorance, ſillineſſe, pratling, ruſticitie, lying, as if in theſe only he were matchleſſe. Indeed whom doth the aſperſion of that foule hand forbeare? Vilium eſt hominum alios viles facere? I appeale to all the Tribunals of Learning thorow the World, whether all Doway haue yeelded ought comparable to that mans Pen: whether hee haue not ſo This Booke of Doctor Coll. C.E. falſly inſinuateth to haue beene ſuppreſſed. All Stationers ſhops can conuince him of a lye: Nothing euer fell from that learned hand, without applauſe. coniured downe his CACO-DaeMON IOANNES, that he neuer dares to looke backe into the light againe; whether his EPHATHA bee not ſo powerfull, that if his Aduerſarie were any otherwiſe deafe then the blocke which he worſhips, it might open his eare to the Truth: It angers C. E. to heare that Kings ſhould not dye, or perhaps, that they whoſe heads are anoynted,

ſhould dye by any other then anoynted fingers; The ſentence of his Cardinall and Ieſuites both de facto, and de iure, of depoſing and murdering Kings, is now beſide our way; Only wee may reade afarre off in capitall Letters, Ariſe Peter, kill and eate: He knowes the word, with ſhame enough. I will not ſo much wrong that worthy Prouost, as to anticipate his quarrell; rather I leaue the ſuperfluity of this malice to the ſcourge of that abler hand; from whom I doubt not but C. E. ſhall ſmart and bleed ſo well, that hee may ſpare the labour of making himſelfe his owne Whipping-ſtock on Good-Fryday.

                   His twelue firſt Pages, are but the light froth of an impotent Anger; wherein he accuſeth my bitterneſſe, and

profeſſeth his owne. For me, I appeale vnto all Eyes; if my Pen haue beene ſometimes zealous, it was neuer intemperate: Neither can hee make me beleeue, that my Paſſions need to appeare to my ſhame, in calling Rome Prostitute,

Drurying of young Heires. There is neither Slander, nor Shame in Truth. For himſelfe, he confeſſeth to haue ſharpened his Pen, and to haue dipt it (perhaps too deepe) in Gall: But where his Inke is too thicke, he ſhall giue me leaue to put a little Vineger to it, that it may flow the better. In the meane time he ſhall goe away with this glory, That a fouler Mouth hath ſeldome euer wip'd it ſelfe vpon cleane Paper.
               After thoſe waſte flouriſhes, his thirteenth Page begins to ſtrike;Refut. p. 13.
                   wherein he chargeth me with odious baſeneſſe, and inſufficiencie, in

borrowing all my proofes from Bellarmines Obiections, diſſembling their Solutions. The Man were hard driuen, that would goe to borrow of an Enemie. If all my Proofes be fore-alledged and foreanſwered by his Bellarmine; to what purpoſe hath this Trifler blurred ſo much Paper? There (he ſaith) ſhall the Reader ſee all my Scriptures anſwered, the Doctrine of Deuils explicated; there, that other, Let him be the Husband of one Wife, and, Marriage is honourable: Anſwered indeed; but as he ſaid (
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ) anſwerleſſely. Such cleare Beames of Truth ſhine in the face of theſe Scriptures, that all the Cob-web Vayles of a Ieſuites ſubtiltie cannot obſcure them.
               Their very Citation confutes their Anſwer. And where had we this Law, That if a Ieſuit haue once meddled with a Scripture, all Pens, all Tongues are barred from euer alledging it? If Satan haue miſ-cited the Pſalme (He ſhall giue his Angels

charge ouer thee) for Temptation, may not we make vſe of it, for the comfort of Protection? Briefly, let my Cauiller know, that it is not the friuolous illuſion of any ſhuffling Ieſuite, that can driue vs from the firme Bulwarke of the holy Scriptures. In this, they are clearely ours, after all pretences of Solution (as he ſhall well feele in the Sequele) and ſhall ſecure vs againſt all humane Oppoſition. Before the diſquiſition whereof, ſomewhat muſt of force be premiſed, concerning the ſtate of our Queſtion.
            
            
               SECT. II.
               WHere, that all Readers may ſee, how learnedly my wiſe Aduerſarie hath miſtaken me, and himſelfe; I muſt tell my Detector, That all his tedious Diſcourſe ſits beſide the Cuſhion:Refut. p. 12.
                   For thus he writes of my Epiſtle (ſo as his whole Scope is to diſproue

the ſingle life of Catholike Priests, and thereby to impugne our Doctrine in that behalfe) vpon which conceit, he runs into a large proofe of the ſtrong Obligation of Vowes, the neceſſitie of their Obſeruation, the penaltie and danger of their Violation, the prayſe of Virginitie, the poſſibilitie of keeping it; and vpon this very ground builds he the tottering Wall of his whole enſuing Confutation: inſomuch, as (Pag. 130.) he ſayes, That Marriage all times, without contrary Iniunction, was lawfull, is not denyed; nor wil it be proued in haſte, That Prieſts, or ſuch as had vowed the contrary, might vſe that libertie: and we ſay not, that Virginitie is violently to be impoſed on any, for it commeth by free election; but where the Vow is free, the Tranſgreſsion is damnable. Thus he.
               Now let all indifferent Eyes ſee, whether the only drift of mine Epiſtle be, not to iuſtifie our Marriages, not to improue their Singleneſſe;

to defend the lawfulneſſe of the Marriage of our Clergie, not to iuſtifie the Marriages of the Romiſh; to plead for the Marriage of our Eccleſiaſtiques, not of Popiſh Votaries.
               In expreſſe termes, I diſ-auowed it. The interuention of a Vow makes a new ſtate. Let Baal plead for himſelfe. What is it to me, if the Romiſh Clergie may not be Husbands? or if, according to the French Prouerbe, They haue a Law not to marry, and a Cuſtome not to liue chaſte? Let it be their care whom it concernes; only I will haue leaue to ſpeake for our owne. Neither did I euer derogate ought from ſacred Virginitie, or lay it leuell (whether abſolutely, or in all circumſtances) with holy Matrimonie; neither did I euer conceiue of an impoſſibilitie of Continence in ſome perſons: Take away theſe three Grounds, (which I vtterly diſclayme before God and Men) together with his petulant Raylings, and idle Excurſions;

and what is become of the Volume of my great Aduerſarie? Thoſe three vaſt Paragraphes are ſhrunke into ſo few ſheets of Paper, that a Mouſe may as ſoone runne away with his Booke, as with his God.

One daſh of a Pen might thus iuſtly anſwer the moſt part of this bloughtie Volume; wherein, like a Drunken Man, hee makes a Fray with his owne ſhadow, and like an idle Whelpe, runnes about after his owne Sterne. But, that hee may not complayne to be caſt off too contemptuouſly, hee ſhall receiue a faire account or Particulars.
            
            
               
               SECT. III.
               THe Theme of my Epiſtle is plainely no other, then our Marriage cenſured; hee anſweres, of Theirs. I would there were ſuch cauſe of familiaritie and intireneſſe, that what is ſaid of one, might agree to both: But the World knowes wee are two. If I ſay our Clergie is heartily loyall to their King; will hee ſtraight take it, of theirs? If, that our Clergie is willingly ſubiect to more then the directiue Power of their Soueraigne, will he challenge this to theirs? The very Point which I purpoſely declined, he followes in hote chaſe. Euen moderate Papists (they are the words of my Epiſtle) will graunt vs free, becauſe not bound by Vow, not ſo farre as thoſe old Germanes, pró poſſe &amp; noſſe: And yet all my Detectors refutation ſtill driues at the ſuppoſition of a Vow. What haue we to doe with Votaries? Our Clergie is

free, whether as Clergie, or as ours: Firſt, as perſons Eccleſiaſticall (qua tales) For, Holy Orders, whether as Orders, or as Holy, are no hinderances of Matrimonie, as Cardinall Caietan truly, and with him, the whole Schoole. That which may be pretended for Impediment, is either a Vow annexed, or an Eccleſiaſticall Statute.

If there were a neceſſarie and inſeparable connexion of a vowed Continencie, with holy Orders, then would not, neither could the Roman Church acknowledge a true Prieſthood, where it finds coniugall Societie? Their act of allowance to the Greeke Church, implyes a faire independencie of theſe two, which ſome of their clamorous Clients plead to haue indiuiſibly coupled. So as now all the ſtrength of this neceſſary Celibate is reſolued into the power of a Church-Statute; and of what Church, but the Roman? All other Churches in the World,P. Venetus. Brocard. Lud.

                  Therefore (ſaith he) ſince the Pope may at his pleaſure looſe the Bond of that Statute, it followes neceſſarily, that if a Prieſt of the Weſterne Church ſhall marrie by the Popes leaue, without any reaſonable cauſe, that ſuch Marriage of his is a true Marriage, and the parties married are true Husband and Wife, and their Iſſue truly legitimate; although in ſo marrying, both the parties ſhould ſinne mortally, in doing

this act against the Vow of Chastitie, without a reaſonable,
                  Dubia cauſa. 
                  or at least a probable cauſe of their ſo licencing; and conſequently, neither ſhould the Pope himſelfe bee excuſed from mortall ſinne: But if there be any reaſonable cauſe of diſpenſing with this Vow of Chastitie; then the partie thus marrying, and diſpenſed with, may both ſafely marry, and liue in Marriage. And hereupon it appeares, That ſince a reaſonable cauſe of diſpenſing with this Vow of Chastitie, may be not onely the publike Vtilitie, whether Ciuill or Eccleſiasticall, but any other greater good then the obſeruing of that Chastitie; it iustly followes, that the Pope not onely may, but with a ſafe Conſcience may diſpenſe with a Priest of the Westerne (or Romane) Church, that he may marry; euen beſides the cauſe of a publike benefit. And therefore the determination of ſome hath beene too preſumptuous, in affirming, That abſolutely, and without ſuch cauſe, the Pope cannot diſpence: whereas (as we haue ſhewed)

the Pope may doe it without any cauſe, though in ſo doing he ſhould ſinne; and with any reaſonable cauſe, without ſinne: and in both, the Matrimonie ſtands firme. Thus he.

If therefore thoſe Superiours, which haue all lawfull and ſpirituall authoritie ouer vs, ſhall haue thought

good, vpon this reaſonable cauſe, to giue a generalitie of diſpenſation to all ſuch of our Clergie, as ſhall not after all carefull and ſerious indeuours, find themſelues able to contayne; allowing them by theſe lawfull remedies to quench thoſe impure flames: What can any Ieſuite or Deuill except againſt this?

                   Maſter Harding, was driuen to ſay, They did it by a Becke, if not by a Dieu-gard, but could neuer proue it done by either. Neither is it more worth my Readers note, then my Aduerſaries indignation, that the wiſe Prouidence of God ſo pleaſed to contriue it of old, as that from the beginning of the firſt Conuerſion of this happy Iſland, it rather conſpired with the Greeke Church, then with the Roman; After the Grecian account we kept our Eaſter, in ſo much, as Beda tells vs, that Pope Iohn the fourth (about the yeere 637.) was fayne to require of the Engliſh, that they would keep their Paſch after the Roman faſhion; a difference (as it was then taken) of no ſmall importance. The ſtorie of Saint Aidanus and Colmannus,
                  
may be herein an abundant witnes: And for the Britons, Beda left them in the Cloze, both of his Life and Hiſtorie; faſt to Greece, looſe from Rome.
               
               After the Grecian forme we celebrated the Sacrament of Baptiſme. After the Grecian Libertie wee continued the Marriages of perſons Eccleſiaſticall (through ſo many Centuries of yeeres) without the ſcandall, without the contradiction of the Chriſtian World; ſo as now we are but repoſſeſſed of the ancient right of our Forefathers, which the interpoſition of the Romiſh tyranny, for a while, iniuriouſly debarred. Our Aduerſaries haue wont to brand vs for the vncharitable cenſures of our Forefathers, and can they thinke the ſucceſſions of many Generations ſo faithleſſe, that they made ſolemne Vowes, for no other purpoſe, but onely to breake them? It was the queſtion of the rich and precious Iewell of England, to which his hardie Aduerſarie had neuer the

face to reply. My Refuters forehead is ſtronger, with a weaker wit; Let him trie here the power of his audacitie. And if the Church of this Iland, in the dayes of her forced ſeruitude to the Roman See, maintayned this libertie (as we proue in the ſequell) and deriued it to Poſteritie, how much more free ſhall it bee for vs to renue and inioy it, after the iuſt excuſſion of that ſeruile yoke?
               Let now C. E. goe waſte good houres, and marre cleane Paper in diſprouing the Marriage of Romiſh Votaries; and in the meane time come as neere my Queſtion, as Thames is to Tiber: What is this but to mocke the Reader, and abuſe himſelfe? How much wiſer is hee growne in the proceſſe of his diſcourſe, where hee graunts our Marriage, and denies our Clergie? from which weake and witleſſe Hold, if wee beate him not, in the due place, we ſuffer not enough from that rude Hand.

But ere I haue done, theſe ſhall appeare to bee but the fictions of a paſſionate fugitiue, the Man ſhall be cooler, I ſhall bee innocent, and my Reader ſhall ſay, that if that forehead had not beene ſo oft croſſed, it could not haue had ſo little ſhame.
               My firſt vntruth is, that I auouch Saint Paul to call the ſingle life of Prieſts, A Doctrine of Deuils. Reader, Is my Detector awake? I ſaid, That to maintayne the vnlawfulnes of the Marriage of the Miniſters of

God, is, according to Saint Paul, A Doctrine or Deuils; and now hee would perſwade the World, I ſaid thus of the ſingle life of his Prieſts. What can wee make of this? That ſingle life is a Doctrine? If not truth, yet let him learne to ſpeake ſenſe. But, that he may not alwayes refute what I neuer affirmed; I muſt gheſſe at what he meant: He would elude this charge, with that ſtale ſhift, worne out with the Pens of his Predeceſſors, that Saint Paul is to bee vnderſtood according to Theodoret, of thoſe which call Marriage execrable:Nuptias execrabiles, &amp;c. according to Saint Auſtin, that ſay, Marriage is euill, and of the Deuils making: according to Clemens Alexandrinus, Of thoſe that abhorre Marriage: Of Manichees, and other Heretikes, as Ambroſe and Epiphanius, from which Catholikes are ſo farre, that they approue it for a Sacrament.
               
               Firſt, the words of Saint Paul are (
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ) forbidding to marry, not condemning Marriage. Then,

we know well, what the Tacians, Ebionites, Encratites, Montanists, Marcionites, Manichees, Adamites, and Apostoliques held of Matrimonie. The Apoſtle brands them here: But what? Them onely? Whiles he condemnes them, doth hee free thoſe that partake with them? The Act is one, Forbiddance of Marriage; whether to ſome, or to more, or to all, S. Paul expreſſes not: The number doth not varie the qualitie. And if one be a part of all, then to condemne Marriage in ſome one kind of Men, can it be other then the partaking of an vniuerſall condemnation of it? This then onely hee hath gayned, that ſome others haue beene deeper in this euill, then themſelues.Obiect.

                  euill. Yet more, his owne example ſhall conuince him: He pleades out of Saint Auſtin, that this Text amongſt others, intends to ſtrike at the Manichees; Now, the Manichees allowed Marriage to their Auditors, that is (Analogically) their Laity, forbad it to their Electi, that is, their Clergie; So farre approuing it in their Layick-Clients, that no modeſt Pen may write Auguſt. de Haereſ. ad Quod-vult-Deum. whence they fetch't their Sacramentall Bread: Either then the Manichees muſt bee excluded, or Papiſts muſt bee taken in for company into this Doctrine of Deuils. It is true, they miſ-call Marriage a Sacrament; So as wee may well wonder at theſe two extremes in one Doctrine: and ſtudy in vayne how the ſame thing ſhould bee Sacred in a Ceremonious inchoation, and in the reall conſummation morally impure, how a Sacrament ſhould bee incompatible with a ſacred Perſon: Theſe Sphyngian

Riddles are for better Heads: With what Brow then can my Detector adde,Refut. p. 19.
                   
                  That with Saint CHRYSOSTOME and Saint AVSTEN, they doe but compare marriage, they doe not condemne it; Onely teaching Marriage to be good, Virginity better; with Fulgentius not ſo comparing Virginity to Corne, that they count Marriage Cockle? In this where ſhould they finde an aduerſary? But, if Luxury, Filthineſſe, Vncleaneneſſe, Contagion, Beaſtlineſſe, Vice, Obſcenity, bee the ſtiles of good, wee can well allow them to the honour of C. Es. Virginitie, and are content our Marriages ſhould paſſe; for euill.

My words are;
                     Refut. p. 19, 20. 
                  Were it not for this opinion, the Church of Rome would want one euident brand of her Antichristianiſme. The life is one thing, the opinion another. Single life is good, the opinion of the neceſſitie of ſingle life, and the vnlawfulneſſe of the Married, is Antichriſtian. What can bee more plaine; yet this wilfull Slanderer tells the World, that I make the profeſſion of Continence, Antichriſtian: Whereas wee doe willingly profeſſe, that true profeſſion of true Continency is truely laudable; that the forceable impoſition of it, as neceſſary to ſome ſtate of men, ſauours ſtrongly of that Man of ſinne: Now, let my Reader iudge, whoſe vntruths my Aduerſarie hath hitherto detected.
               Neither can I eate that word of mine, vnleſſe I would renounce the Apoſtle; who ſeemes purpoſely to decipher our Romaniſts by theſe lines. For, hauing immediately before deſcribed the condition of Biſhops, and Deacons, with their

Wiues &amp; Children (allowing them indifferently with others a married eſtate) hee preſently (as fore-ſeeing that Point which would bee moſt ſubiect to contradiction) fore-tells, that the ſeducing ſpirits of Antichriſtianiſme would forbid marriage; and this hee fore-propheſies ſhall bee done in the latter, or (as their Vulgar and Rhemiſts turne it) in the laſt Times;And if 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      may agree to all the Ages of the Church after Chriſt, yet moſt to the laſt, and that other addition ſeemes to ſtrengthen this ſenſe. and that by them, which ſhall ſpeake lyes in hypocriſie. Neither of which can ſo exactly agree to thoſe firſt Heretikes; who, as they were early in time, ſo alſo groſſe in their Doctrine; wherein there was more open impietie, then ſecret diſſimulation.

                  When they haue begun to waxe

wanton againſt Chriſt, they will marry, hauing damnation, becauſe they haue forſaken their firſt faith. In which place (boulted before to the Bran by many Controuerſers) mine Aduerſarie hath learned of his Bellarmine, to triumph aboue meaſure. This first faith (ſaith hee) all the Fathers, without exception, vnderſtand to be a Vow, or Promiſe, made to God of Continence, in the ſtate of Widdowhood. It is a wide word (All the Fathers.) I had thought I had read in holy L. 6. de Trinitate de Beat. tit. Dei ad Theophilum. Et inſtrumenta libertatis ſemel conceſſa per iterationem infirmatis. ATHANASIVS, Vae vobis qui primam fidem baptiſmi coelitus inſtitutam irritant facitis; Wo to you that make void the firſt faith of Baptiſme ordayned from heauen. I had thought Non ſunt digni fide qui primam fidem Baptiſmi irritam fecerunt, Marcionem loquor &amp; Baſilidem. Hier. Prooem. in Epiſt. ad Tit. 
                  Hierome had ſomewhere ſaid, They are not worthy of beliefe, which haue voyded their firſt beliefe, MARCION I meane and BASILIDES; whom yet I neuer found condemned for the breach of any Vow of Continence. I had thought, the Authour of the Interlinear Gloſſe, would not haue croſſed all the Fathers, in expounding

it, Fidem baptiſmi; The faith of Baptiſme, which is indeed the firſt Faith; and the Apoſtle ſaith (The firſt) not (the former;) as for that other, which he imagines, a Vow of continued Viduitie, it was neither Faith nor Firſt; let him inſtance (if hee can) where our Apoſtle takes Faith for a Vow. Rather, as if hee meant to expound his owne word in this very Scripture, and this occaſion, he cleeres this doubt, whiles he ſpeakes of the wilfully improuident Man, that he hath denyed the Faith, and is worſe then an Infidell; and now in the ſame Context, he ſpeaks of theſe peruerted Widdowes, that they haue forſaken the Faith.
               
               Much leſſe is it the Firſt, whether in Time, or Dignitie: For, they could not haue beene Church-widdowes, if not Chriſtians; and they could not bee Chriſtians, if they ſhould haue valued the Vow of their Widdowhood aboue the vow of their Chriſtendome; yea, ſo farre was this from the firſt Vow, (if it

had beene one) as that it was the laſt of all; for according to them; their firſt Faith muſt bee to their Husband, their ſecond to Chriſt, in their initiation to Religion; their laſt in the vow of Widdow-hood; So as here is a fayned vow made Faith, and laſt made firſt; and all to vphold a crazy conceit of our Romaniſts, which hath no other ground but this one ambiguity.Refut. p. 20.
                   
                  Chryſoſtome indeede calls it (
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ) ad Pactum; a couenant; but what couenant, or with whom, he expreſſes not; whether of Chriſtianity, or of Widdowhood, or of Miniſtration; Some of the others that follow'd him, ſpake according to the Gloſſe which the corrupt conceit of the Times had ſet vpon him.
               But what neede my Refuter ſtand vpon particular Authors (he ſayes) when he may bring 214.Refut. p. 21.
                   Biſhops all ſitting in Councell at Carthage, all agreeing in this expoſition, poynting vs to the fourth Councell of Carthage (Canone vlt.) His Gratian
                  
had wont to tell vs (for the more Grace) that it was in the third Councell of Carthage, Can. 4. Now he is taught to change his note; So doth C. E. with his Binius, tell vs it was the fourth Councell and the laſt Canon. Wee haue reaſon to ſuſpect it was in neither; The very ſtile and maner of diſcourſe ſo different from the reſt of thoſe briefe Canons, and the faſhion of thoſe Times, carry in it open likelihood of Baſtardie: It was an eaſie fraud to patch it to the end of thoſe Canons; neither (which learned Iunius taught me firſt to obſerue) is it found among the Greeke; then which there cannot be a worſe ſigne.
               But that I may at once anſwere this vaunt of Actiquitie, and ſtop the mouth of this Cauiller; Let me aske him whether thoſe Fathers, whom he cites for this ſenſe, doe not take thoſe yong Widdowes for Votaries? If they doe (as hee cannot denie) how can theſe two ſtand together, That they ſhould haue damnation

becauſe againſt their vow, they would marry; and yet that the Apoſtle ſhould wiſh them to marry? Can he imagine that Saint Paul would aduiſe them to incurre wilful Damnation?
               And if in this I ſhould haue diſſented from the interpretation of much Antiquitie, I ſhould but take to my ſelfe the liberty of his Maſters the Ieſuites, with whom this is no nouelty; for inſtance, his not vnlearned, and bold Maldonat. in Matth. 19.11.
                   
                  Maldonate (as we ſhall ſee afterwards) vpon a Text of this very Queſtion, confeſſing the current of the ſtreame of Antiquitie, can come in, at laſt, with a Doctorly wipe of Adduci non poſſum vt ſequar; I cannot goe with them: This priuiledge is for none but the Fathers of the Society,

               The ſtate then of theſe Widdowes was ſhortly this: They being for their pouerty ſuſtayned by Church-alms, vpon De his agit quae ad Eccleſiae ſtipem, vel miniſterium recipiebantur eius ſumptibus alendae, Espenc. de Cont. l. 4. c. 1.
                   condition of attendance

on the Saints, whether ſicke or trauelling, were to dedicate themſelues to this ſeruice; but, ſome of the yonger ſort being inueigled by Infidell-Louers, were drawn to leaue, not their Station only of their miniſtration, but their profeſſion of Chriſtianitie: Theſe had damnation moſt iuſtly, for caſting off their firſt Faith. Their marriage was accidentally faultie, becauſe it forced them from their holy imployment; Their Apoſtaſie was abſolutely and damnably ſinfull, in that they left Chriſt, and followed after Satan.
               
                  
                     Refut. p. 21, 22.The inextricable Dilemma then of my Detector is eaſily anſwered; (I demand now of Maſter Hall, whether theſe yong Widdowes, in breaking their Vowes, did ſinne, or not; If they did not; why ſhall they haue damnation; If they did ſinne (as indeed they did) then how is the Vow vnlawfull? how the brand of Antichriſtianiſme?) Nothing can bee more baſe then to beg the Queſtion; What doe we diſpute, but whether

any Vow were made? and if any, whether of Continence, or of Seruice? But why then ſhall they haue damnation? for waxing wanton againſt Chriſt, not meerely for marrying. If to marry, were to waxe wanton againſt Chriſt, why would the Apoſtle haue aduiſed it them? in a word, for abandoning both their Office and Religion.

Let their Shauelings (I ſaid) ſpeake for themſelues, vpon whom their vnlawfull Vow hath forced a wilfull and impoſſible neceſsitie. The man is angrie that I meddled with his crowne; but if his haire had not beene longer then his wit, this deepe offence had neuer beene; For, if he had taken my words, Cum grano ſalis, in the ſenſe which they will onely well beare: (Let ſuch of their Shauelings, as vpon whom an vnlawful Vow hath forced an impoſsible neceſsitie, ſpeake for themſelues) (none other neede ſpeaking for) he had found the ſentence ſo particular, that it might haue ſpared him both much ſplene and worke; ſince, neither was it in my heart euer to affirme the obſeruation of this Vow impoſſible to

any man, neither will hee (I hope) hold that it is kept by all: It is not in the power of the Razor, together with the Haires, to cut off inordinate affections; ſome Vow which cannot contayne: Vpon this ſuppoſition onely, I called this neceſſitie impoſſible, and this Vow vnlawful; I cannot therefore but pitty my paſſionate Detector, that hee hath ſet himſelfe all on a froth, in running this Wild-Gooſe chaſe alone, following nothing but his owne fancy, whiles hee purſues a certayne Chimericall Monſter, that holds Continence vtterly &amp; vniuerſally impoſſible. And that hee may the better repent him of this witleſſe waſte, and preuent the ſpoile of good Paper hereafter, let him know at once (which perhaps hath not hitherto beene allowed him) what wee hold concerning this Point. Wee doe therefore from our hearts honour true Virginitie, as the moſt excellent eſtate of life, which is incident to fraile Humanity; Gerſon hath taught

vs not to call it a Vertue, but it is Couſin-German to a Vertue; Neither doe wee thinke that the Earth affords any thing more glorious, then Eunuchiſme for the Kingdom of Heauen; which is therefore commended by our Sauiour, not as a thing meerely arbitrarie, by way of aduice, but of charge to the able. Qui potest capere, capiat; In this we can gladly ſubſcribe to Saint CHRYSOSTOME, Bonum eſt Virginitas, &amp;c. Virginitie is good, I yeeld it; and better then Marriage, I confeſſe it. Secondly, euery man therefore (not Eccleſiaſtiques onely) ſhould labour, and ſtriue to aſpire vnto this eſtate, as the better, vſing all holy meanes both to attayne, and to continue it: Neither doe wee thinke it any other then blameable, that yong Perſons (not ſo much as aduiſing with their owne abilities) without all indeuour and ambition of ſo worthy a condition, leape raſhly into the bands of Wedlocke. Thirdly, though euery man muſt

reach for it, yet euery man cannot catch it; ſince it hath pleaſed God to reſerue this as a peculiar gift for ſome perſons, not intending it as a common fauour to all Suiters. Fourthly, thoſe then, which are vpon good triall conſcious to themſelues of Gods call to this eſtate, and his gift inabling them vnto it, may lawfully make profeſſion therof to the glorie of the Giuer, and (if need be) may vow (God continuing the ſame grace vnto them) an holy perpetuation thereof to their end; the obſeruation whereof, if they through their owne neglect ſhall let fall, they cannot bee excuſed from

                  Now, my Detector by this time in our aſſertions ſees his owne folly; if againſt this hee can except ought, he knowes where to find an aduerſary: In the meane time, hee needed not to take it ſo highly, that in the Romiſh vſe of vowes, I made mention of vnlawfulneſſe, of impoſſibility; vnlawfulneſſe in the making, impoſſibility in keeping; I am readie to maintaine both, in reſpect of the indiſpoſition, yea incapacitie of the Votaries.
            
            
               SECT. VIII.
               BVt in ſpeaking of the impoſſibility of ſome mens continencie, it was not poſſible for my Refuter to containe himſelfe from a ſcurrill inuectiue againſt Luther, Pellican, Bucer; and it becomes him well. His Fathers,
                     Refutat. p. 25▪ 26, 27. like Sepulchrall dogges, tore vp the graues of Gods Saints, and gnawed vpon their dead bones, and now this

Whelpe of theirs commingit cineros, Bedribbles their aſhes.
               
               The heroicall Spirit of Luther (for I cannot be flouted out of that word) hated the brothelry of their Cloyſters; and choſe rather (which galls them to the heart) to be an honeſt Husband, then a fornicating Frier. What did hee other in this, then the holy Fathers haue aduiſed him, yea then hee learned in their owne Schoole? for caſting, perhaps, his eye vpon the Index of their Aquinas,
                  Votum Vergens in periculum perſonae, debet frangi ſecurè, ſi diſpenſatio non poſſit haberi. lnd. 3. in Ag. voce votum. he found there, Votum Vergens, &amp;c. A vow tending to the danger of the perſon, may be ſecurely broken, if a diſpenſation cannot bee had: What other then all their more ingenuous Caſuiſts would thinke fit to giue way vnto. If Luther would haue ſtill kept on his Cowle, &amp; but haue paid the fees of a Concubine, he had liued &amp; dyed an holy Auguſtinian: but now all his crimes ſinke downe out of ſight, vna vxor ſupernatat (as that Father ſaid) his wife onely floteth: and poore honeſt Katherine

                   then ten thouſand of their Curtizans. Neyther needs this man any other Inſcription on his graue to make him odious, then this, Here lyes the man that held marriage better then fornication. If now Doctor Luther in a vehement deteſtation of the impuritie of their holy Stewes, after the homely plaineneſſe of a blunt German libertie, vſed ſome ouer-broad ſpeeches to expreſſe his owne freedome, and their abominations; what is this to vs? If we honor the man, muſt wee hold his pen impeccable? This is enough to maintaine in their Vice-god of the Seuen hills. For vs, wee haue ſworne into the words of no Maſter, but that One in heauen, the eternall Word of his Father. But this we dare ſay, that this Aduerſaries Truth is no more in fathering all theſe reports vpon Luther, then in fathering Luther vpon an Incubus.

                   that Leonard Knoppen was his Bawd, and that his Katherine, for two yeeres together after her ſtealing away, was debauched by the Schollers of Wittenberge: And now laſtly, comes in that malicious Apoſtate (which ſhould rather haue changed the falſe name of Iuſtus,
                  Iuſtus Baronius, formerly called Caluinus. then the ouer-worthy name of Caluinus) and auouches, forſooth, that LVTHER was yeſterday a Monk, to day contracted, to morrow an Husband, the next day a Father. Goe on, yee brazen-faced Paraſites of Rome, Lyes and Bloud may bring you into the Kalender.
               
                  But this laſt, my Detector countenances by the teſtimonie of Eraſmus, who, in a Letter of his to his friend Daniel Mauchius of Vlmes, deliuers the ſame Storie in more words. Reader, bee intreated to looke ouer that large Volume of Eraſmus his Epiſtles, and if there be no ſuch man found there (as there is not) no ſuch Letter, iudge what to thinke of theſe mens fidelitie. Yea to the plaine contrarie,Tom. 2. Lat. Colloq. Tit. de morbis Lutheri. my Detector (hauing not memorie enough for a true Lyer) in the Page 173. Vpon another occaſiō, contemptuouſly citing Luthers brood out of his own Workes, confutes this ſpightfull Fiction. Anno 1525. Iunij 12. vxorem duxi, &amp;c. In the yeere, ſaith hee, 1525. on the 12. of Iune, I marryed; In the yeere 1526. my eldeſt Sonne IOHN was borne: In the yeere 27. my daughter ELIZABETH, and ſo the reſt. Eyther then my man hath a new Kalender of his owne, which contrarie to the Gregorian begins the yeere on Iune 13. or elſe Luther
                  
was not a Father the next day after he was an Husband. But what doe I trouble my Reader with this idle Scoganiſme? Scolds or Ieſters are onely fit for this combat.
               As for thoſe exceſſiue ſpeeches of compariſon,
                     Refut. p. 28.29. whereby Luther points forth the neceſſitie of carnall actions, they are ſpoken onely of ſuch perſons, as haue not the gift of continencie;Lib. 3. contr. Gent c. 126. Omnibus animalibus per

In all perfect liuing creatures there is a naturall inclination to carnall coniunction.
               
               But when Luther ſpeakes of men bleſſed from aboue with this gift, C. E. might haue heard him in another ſtraine; pleading both the poſſibility and worthineſſe of this condition. As in his Commentary vpon the Luth. in Pſ. 128. verſ. 3. Vnus idem

Let them therefore, to whom it is giuen to receiue this, abide in their ſingle life, and let them glorie in the Lord: On the other ſide, let them that are not ſo ſtrong, but know and feele their infirmitie, that they cannot liue both chaſte, and out of Matrimonie: Let theſe, I ſay, conſider more their owne infirmitie, then the diſcommodities and troubles that belong vnto Matrimonie. Thus hee grauely and holily.

that all theſe ſheets of Paper which he hath ſpent in this poynt, may ſerue for ſome neceſſarie vſe; this which he hath put them to, is fooliſhly ſuperfluous.

Idle head! Who euer denied it, but the exploded Lampetians? His owne Cardinall could haue taught him,Bell. l. 2. de Monachis c. 15.

                   that Luther and Caluin approue the vowing of things commanded, firſt; and then of things not commanded too, to the auoyding of Sinne, or other good purpoſes; Not the ſecond, which hee will proue by many arguments; ſome of them from the Fathers, extolling virginitie, and comparing it with the ſtate of Angels, and preferring it before marriage: And who eeuer thought otherwiſe, except Iouinian? and perhaps not hee: And

                   by the ciuill Lawes (as if theſe concerned vs ſo much as themſelues) he deſcends to this challenge; Let Mr Hall (if he be able) produce vs ſome proofe, although but one claſsicall authoritie of any one ancient Writer, where he hath euer perſwaded ſuch as haue ſolemnely vowed chastitie, to vſe Marriage as a meanes to ouercome temptations, and hee ſhall haue ſome excuſe for calling it a filthie vow; and his heroicall LVTHER for terming it a diabolicall thing: So hee. I take him at his word; onely let him not flye forth vpon the ſhift of ſolemnity, which their Scholer lately hatched; That were to ſeeke gray hayres in infancie; Firſt, I bring forth that famous place of Saint Cyprian in his Epiſtle written both in his owne name, and his fellow-Biſhops to Pomponius, concerning ſome vowed Virgins which were

found in bed with men, whereof one was a Deacon; of which Virgines he with his Brethren paſſe this ſentence, Epiſt. l. 1. Epiſt. 11.

                  and ſo couragiouſly and conſtantly expect the reward of their Virginitie; Si autem perſeuerare nolunt, vel non poſſunt, &amp;c. But if eyther they will not, or cannot perſeuere, it is better that they marrie,
                  Melius eſt vt nubant, quàm in ignem delicijs ſuis cadunt. 
                  then by their wantonneſſe fall into the fire; Let them giue no ſcandall to their Brethren and Sisters. What could Luther or Caluin write more directly? So that Eraſmus notes in the Margine, Etiam virginibus ſacris permitit nubere; Here CYPRIAN permits euen holy Virgines to marry. 
                  Lib. 2. de Monach. c. 34.
                   BELLARMINES ſhift hereof is ridiculous, That Cyprian, by occaſion of ſome Virgins which after their vow behaued themſelues dishoneſtly, aduiſed others, that if

they had not a firme purpoſe of perſeuering, they ſhould not vow, but marrie; whom we remit to the checke of his owne Pamelius, of his conſcience; Indeed, what is this but to mocke both the Author, and the Reader? For doth Cyprian at all varie the perſons of whom hee ſpeakes? Doth he not ſpeake plainly of Virgins deuoted to Chriſt? And what perſeuering could there be but in that which they had vndertaken? And what had they vndertaken, but a dedication of themſelues to Chriſt? What is this, Reader, but willingly to try his oares againſt the ſtreame of Truth?
               To the ſame purpoſe is that noted ſentence of Hierome, (Hieronymus impendio ſemper virgini
                        •

                  Whom we muſt openly charge that eyther they would marry, if they cannot containe, or, that they would contayne, if they will

not marrie. We know the eluſion of this place alſo; That Hierome ſpeakes of Virgins in purpoſe, not in vow; But whoſe name, I beſeech you, was defamed by their lewdneſſe? or, what was the heauenly and Angelicall Family, whoſe glory was blemiſhed herewith? Was it of any other then profeſſed Virgins? Or could the act of a purpoſed Virgin onely, ſhame Virgins profeſſed? To the ſame purpoſe is the aduice of Baſil. l. de virg.

And for that particular fact, it is no leſſe mis-taken. Hierome ſayes onely,He married his daughter, being a Virgin dedicated to Chriſt. 
                  Filiam virginem Chriſto deuotam, matrimonio copulauit; but Sophronius (who it ſeemes well know the Storie) turnes it (Coegit vt nuberet. Vide Eraſm. Schol. in Hier. Catalog. Scriptor. Eccle. So Syagria in Greg. Epiſt. mar

Not his opinion; How can wee be ſaid to admit marriage to an equall ſhare of merit with virginitie, when wee deny merit in eyther?

death) yet both then, and before his marriage, hee would take it in great ſcorne (as well he might) to be ſuſpected for diſhonest. True, and might defie Men and Deuils in that challenge. What of this? It followes then: If Master HALL could for ſo long together liue a chaste life, why no more? Why not alwayes? Demonſtratiuely concluded: As if a man ſhould ſay, C. E. doth ſpeake ſome wiſe words, how can he at any time write thus fooliſhly? A Chriſtian hath ſometimes grace to auoyd a Temptation, why not alwayes? Why doth hee not keepe himſelfe euer from ſinning? A good Swimmer may hold his breath vnder the Water for ſome portion of a Minute, why not for an Houre? why not for more? A deuout Papiſt may faſt after his Breake-faſt, till his Dinner in the after-noone, therefore why not a Weeke? why not a Moneth? why not ſo long as Eue the Maid of Meurs?
               
               The Spirit of God (if at leaſt hee

may bee allowed for the Author of Continency) breatheth where, and when he liſteth; and that God which makes marriages in Heauen, either auerts the hart from theſe thoughts, or inclines it at his pleaſure.

Why not alwayes? It is pitty, that no man would aduiſe the Apoſtle, how great a gap this Doctrine of his opens to all laſciuiouſneſſe.

ex puris ſunto; yea, his Eraſmus might haue taught him yet further, Eraſ. Apol. pro declam. Matr. Secundas gradus Virginitatis eſt Matrimonij caſta dilectio, Opus Imperf. in Matth. Refut. p. 64. Ab his duabus Columnis crede mihi difficile duellor. Ibid ex Bernardo C. E.
                   
                  E diuerſo nihil prohibet in coniugio Virginitati locum eſſe; that euen in Marriage there may bee Virginitie.
               Thirdly, The Fathers exhort to Virginity; eſpecially Saint Ambroſe and Saint Auſtin. Let him tell this to them that know it not, to them that diſlike true chaſtity in Virgins, not to them that condemne vnchaſtneſſe in a pretended Virginity.
               To what Vertue doe not the Fathers exhort? yet neuer ſuppoſing them to be within our lure. Laſtly, where is the ſhame of my Refuter, that cites Austin as the Man on whom hee depends for this vniuerſall poſſibility of Continency: when his owne Maldonate profeſſes that Saint Auſtin is the only enemie to this Doctrine?
               Fourthly,Refut. p. 64.
                   Where there is impoſſibility or neceſſity, there is no ſinne, no counſaile; as no man ſinnes in not making new Starres, in not doing

Miracles. A ſtale ſhift, that oft ſounded in the eares of Auſtin and Proſper from their Pelagians; The naturall man in this deprauedneſſe of eſtate cannot but offend God, therefore hee ſinnes not in ſinning: Counſell giuen ſhewes what wee ſhould doe, not what we can. Aug. l. de Nat. &amp; Grat. c. 43.
                   
                  Iubendo admonet, &amp;c. ſaith Austin; In commanding, he admoniſheth vs both to doe what wee can, and to aske that which wee cannot doe. In Continency then our indeuour is required for the attayning of that which God will giue vs; God neuer imployed vs in making of Starres; Though my Refuter is euery day ſet on greater Worke, then making of him that made Starres. Laſtly, it is true, there is no ſinne in marrying, there may be ſinne (after a vow) in not vſing all lawfull meanes of Chaſtity: The Fathers therefore ſuppoſing a Poſt multam deliberationem &amp; conſiderationem, &amp;c. Baſil. pre-required aſſurance of the gift, and calling of God in thoſe, whom mature deliberation, and long proofe had couered with

the vayle of Virginity, doe iuſtly both call for their continuance, and cenſure their Lapſes.
               Fiftly,Refut. pag. 65.
                   Vpon this ground the Father cannot blame his Childe for incontinence; To contayne implyes impoſſibility. Aske him wherfore ſerues Marriage? Yea, but to prouide an Husband or a Wife, is not a worke of an houres warning; in the meane time what ſhall they doe? Sure, the man thinks of thoſe hot Regions of his Religion, where they are ſo ſharpe ſet, that they muſt haue Stewes allowed of one Sexe at leaſt; Elſe what ſtrange violence is this that he conceiues? As our Iunius anſwered his Bellarmine, in the like, Hic homo ſibi videtur agere de equis admiſſarijs ruentibus in venerem, &amp; de hippomane, non de hominibus ratione praeditis; he ſpeaks as if hee had to doe with Stallions, not with Men, not with Chriſtians, amongſt whom is to bee ſuppoſed a decent order, and due regard of ſeaſonableneſſe, and expediency: A

doughty Argument, wherewith Maſter HALL is ſore preſſed.

                  Refut. p. 65.
                  Sixtly, The Husband and Wife are ſeparated vpon diſcord, or diſeaſe: What ſhall they doe? To liue continent with this man is impoſſible. I anſwere; If only their will ſunder them, that muſt yeeld to neceſſity; Diſſenſion may not abridge them of the neceſſary remedy of ſinne. If neceſſity, that findes reliefe in their prayers; If they call on him who calls them to continencie by this Hand of his, hee will heare them, and inable them to perſiſt.

And why not then in the neceſſitie of our Vowes? This is a neceſſitie of our owne making; that is of his; Hee hath bound himſelfe to keepe his owne promiſes, not ours.
            
            
               SECT. XIIII.
               WHiles his Fellow,Refut. p. 66.
                   or Maſter, Maldonate, talks of confuting Auſtin in this very point, by Austin himſelfe, this man will confute vs by him; whom hee no otherwiſe cites for himſelfe, then his Anceſtor Pelagius cites Lactantius, Hilarie, Ambroſe, Hierome, and Austin in this caſe. The thing (ſaith he) is in our power, and though it require the aſsistance of Gods grace, which ſtill preuenteth our will, yet that hinders not, but that wee may (if we list) liue chaste all the dayes of our life, as wee may vpon the ſame termes beleeue in God, and loue him. What impudency is this, to make him the Patron of the power of our

Free-will to God, whome all the World knowes to haue beene Malleus Pelagianorum? and who in ſo many Volumes damnes this conceit to the Pit of Hell; euermore ſo eſtabliſhing the naturall facultie and vſe of the Will againſt Stoicall neceſſitie, as that hee abandons any power of the act, or exerciſe of it vnto good (without grace) againſt humane preſumption. When hee ſpeakes of this, here is not a cold &amp; feeble preuention, but an effectuall inoperation, yea a powerfull creation.
               Since my Refuter then will needs bee paralelling our abilitie of contayning, and of beleeuing, let him heare that holy Father ſay, Aug. de Nat. &amp; Grat. 25.
                   
                  Non ſolùm Deus poſſe noſtrum, &amp;c. God doth not only giue, and helpe our power to good, but workes in vs both our will and working of good.

                  What doſt thou tell me of thy Free-will; which can neuer bee free to do good, except thou be a Sheep of God? Hee therefore that makes men to bee his ſheepe, frees the wills of men to the obedience of Pietie: But why doth he make theſe men ſheepe, and thoſe not, ſince with him is no reſpect of perſons?

                  Planè poſſumus dicere frontem haereticorum non eſſe frontem: And if there could bee any more on that holy Fathers ſcore, Father Maldonate hath paid it for vs. To conclude therefore for him; Arbitrium humanae voluntatis nequaquam deſtruimus:

Wee know no man doth well againſt his will; God was not to make Virgins by force; and the ſame goodneſſe that giues Chaſtity to the marryed, continues Virginity to the ſingle:Refut. p. 69.
                   
                  What of all this? Therefore (ſaith he) it is as wel in the power of al ſingle perſons to be alwayes continent, as of the marryed to keepe coniugall Chaſtitie: An illation and concluſion worthy of my Refuters Logike and Diuinitie; As if he argued thus for himſelfe; The ſame God that diſpoſes of Orders, diſpoſes of the Popedome: therefore I may as well looke to weare three Crownes, as one ſhauen. Or the ſame God giues both Life, and Grace, and Glorie. Therefore all thoſe that liue the naturall life, may alſo liue the ſpirituall, and glorious. Who ſees not the reaſon of theſe vnlike? Coniugall honeſtie is abſolutely commanded of God to all marryed perſons; perpetuation of Virginitie (hee grants) was neuer commanded; The breach of coniugall honeſtie, is of it ſelfe, a

ſinne to all; Marriage is not ſo. Againſt the one therefore, we may abſolutely pray in Chriſti erit ſi fides aderit qua impetrat à iuuente quod iuſſerit, Aug. de adult. con. l. 2. c. 19 Refut. p. 71.72.73.
                   faith, againſt the other but with condition; God hath promiſed to deliuer vs from our ſinnes, not from our Marriage.
               As for Saint Ambroſe, wee eaſily grant him large in the prayſe of Virginitie: But no one word of all his cited authorities toucheth our Aſſertion: The helpes of the Church, the ſeruice of Angels, the merit of the Prayers of our Sauiour we yeeld to bee good meanes of continence, where it is intended; but that it is meant to all commers, we deny; Let the ſucceſſe ſpeake.
               Neither doe we taxe the Vow for any improbitie in it ſelfe, but for the incapacitie of the perſons: The Vow were good, if the men were not eyther euill, or vnfit. And here Refut p. 71.

to rayſe rents from profeſſed filthineſſe? Can hee deny the vnnaturall beaſtlineſſe that raignes in his Italy? But what doe I ſtirre this puddle? Let me heare no more brags of their chaſtitie, no more exprobrations of our laſciuiouſneſſe.

                  AS if my Refuter had vowed to write no true word, hee challenges mee for tranſlating Iſidores Turpe votum, a filthie vow: I turne to my Epiſtle, and find it not engliſhed by mee at all. His owne conſcience, belike, ſo conſtrues it; or if ſome former Impreſſion of mine (which I beleeue not) had ſo turned it, here is neyther ignorance, nor vnfaithfulneſſe. Wherſoeuer is ſinne, there is filthineſſe: And if a lawfull vow be property de meliore bono, can there not therefore be an vnlawfull vow? What was that of Iepthaes, or that of Saint

                  Pauls fortie Conſpirators? But the word there (ſaith he) ſignifies a promiſe; As if euery vow were not a promiſe; and if Iſidore take votum for promiſſum,

               This vow of theirs therefore is metonymically filthie, becauſe it makes them ſuch. In one word, (that he may raue no more of Epicures, Turkes, Pagans) Their vow is in profeſſion glorious, filthie in effect. And now for a concluſion of this poynt, I muſt out of all theſe groſſe and ignorant paſſages of his (though vnproperly, yet) truely vow to the world, that a truer Bayard did neuer ſtumble forth into the Preſſe.

               HE hath done with their own vowes, and now deſcends to vs, whom he confeſſes vowleſſe;Refut. p. 89.
                   His ſcorne cannot ſtrip vs of the benefit of that Truth, which hee confeſſeth; Thus then hee writes; I freely with other Catholikes grant, that our Engliſh Miniſters, according to their calling, make no vowes; I grant their marriage to be lawfull; I grant that euery one of them may be the husband of one wife, &amp;c. And why did not this liberalitie of my wiſe Detector tye vp his Tongue in his purſe all this while? No more was required, no leſſe is yeelded; whereto is all this iangling? But, that his grant may proue worſe then a deniall, thus he proceeds: But wee denie them to bee truely Clergie-men, or to haue any more authoritie in the Church, then their wiues or daughters haue, and this, becauſe they want all true calling and Ordination; For,

they entred not in at the dore, like true Paſtors, but ſtole in at the window like theeues; We denie their miniſterie (I ſay) to bee lawfull, becauſe they did runne before they were ſent, tooke their places by intruſion, &amp;c. Let Maſter HALL diſproue this, and I will ſay, Tu Phyllida ſolus habeto. Thus he.
               A deepe crimination, and ſuch, as if it could bee proued, would robbe our queſtion of the State, and vs of our duely-challenged honour. Reader, this vehemence ſhewes thee where his ſhoo wrings him: It is the gall of Romiſh hearts that wee proſper, and are not theirs; Where they haue preſumed vpon credulitie, they haue not ſtucke to ſay, wee are not men like others, but more frequently and boldly, that wee are no Chriſtian men; and here moſt peremptorily, that we are no Clergie-men: There is no Church, no Chriſtianitie, no Clergie not theirs; Neyther can wee bee in Orders, whiles we are out of Babylon.
               
                  The man dreames of the Naggeshead in Cheap-ſide, where his lying Oracle Tradition hath not ſhamed to report, Iewell, Sands, Horne, Scory, Grindall, and others in the beginning of Queene Elizabeths time (beeing disappoynted of the Catholike Biſhop of Landaff) to haue layd hands mutually on each other; and that from hence haue flowed our pretended Orders. This our ſhameleſſe,Alias, Halywell the Ieſuite. 
                  Sacroboſco heard of ſome good old folkes, and they had it of one Neale, Profeſſor Ebrius in Oxford; Kelliſon tooke it of Sacroboſco, and C.E. of him. Concordat cum Originali; Diabolus eſt mendax &amp; pater eius. And is not this a worthie engine to batter downe the wals of a whole Church, to blow vp all our Ordination? Is it poſſible that any Chriſtian face ſhould bee ſo graceleſſe, as to beare out ſuch an apparent and ridiculous falſhood, againſt ſo many thouſands of witneſſes, againſt the euidence of authenticall Records; againſt

reaſon, and ſenſe it ſelfe? For can they hope to perſwade any liuing man, that theſe hauing at that time a lawfull Archbiſhop of their owne Religion, legally eſtabliſhed in the Metropoliticall Chayre, by an acknowledged authoritie, the ſway of the times openly fauouring them, when all Churches, all Chappels gladly opened to them, that they would be ſo mad as to goe and Ordayne themſelues in a Tauerne? He that would beleeue this, may be perſwaded that their adored blocks can weepe, and ſpeake, and moue; that their Cake is his God; Neuer truth could be cleared, if not this; No leſſe then the whole Kingdome knew, that Queene Mary died in the yeere 1558, Nouember 17; and her Cardinal (then Archbiſhop of Canterbury) accompanied her ſoule in death, the ſame day. The ſame day was Queene Elizabeths Initium Regni; her Coronation Ianuary 15. following. That leaſure enough might bee taken in theſe

great affaires, the See of Canterbury continued voide aboue a yeere. At laſt, in the ſecond yeere of Queen Elizabeth 1559. December 17. was Mathew Parker legally conſecrated Archbiſhop of Canterburie, by foure Biſhops: William Barlow formerly Biſhop of Bathe, then elect of Chicheſter. Iohn Scory before of Chicheſter, now elect of Hereford. Miles Couerdale Biſhop of Exceter. Iohn Hodgeskins Suffragan of Bedford. Mathew Parker thus irrefragably ſettled in the Archiepiſcopall See, with three other Biſhops, in the ſame Moneth of December, ſolemnely conſecrated Edmund Grindall, and Edwin Sands; The publique Records are euident and particular, relating the Time, Sunday morning after Prayers; The place, Lambeth-Chappell; The manner, Impoſition of hands; The conſecrators; Mathew Cant. William Chicheſter, Iohn Hereford, Iohn Bedford; The Preacher at the Conſecration, Alexander Nowell,
                  
afterwards the worthie Deane of Pauls; The Text, Take heed to your ſelues, and to all the flocke, &amp;c. The Communion, laſtly adminiſtred by the Archbiſhop.
               For Biſhop Iewell, he was conſecrated the Moneth following in the ſame forme by Mathew Cant. Edmund London, Richard Ely, Iohn Bedford.
               
               Laſtly, for Biſhop Horne, he was conſecrated a whole yeere after this, by Mathew Cant. Thomas S. Dauids, Edmund London, Thomas Couentry and Lichfield; The Circumſtances, Tyme, Place, Forme, Preacher, Text, ſeuerally recorded. The particulars whereof, I referre to the faithfull and cleare relation of Maſter Francis Maſon; whoſe learned and full diſcourſe of this ſubiect, might haue ſatisfied all eyes, and ſtopped all mouthes. What incredible impudencie is this then, for thoſe which pretend not Chriſtianitie onely, but the Conſecration of God, wilfully to rayſe ſuch ſhamefull

ſlanders from the pit of Hell, to the diſgrace of truth, to the diſparagement of our holy calling?
               Let mee therefore challenge my Detector in this ſo important a point, wherein his zeale hath ſo far out-run his wit, and with him all the Brats of that proud Harlot, that no Church vnder Heauen can ſhew a more cleere, eeuen, vncontrolable, vntroubled line of the iuſt ſucceſſion of her ſacred Orders, then this of ours; If his Rome, for her tyrannous Primacy, could bring forth but ſuch Cardes, the World would bee too ſtrait for her. He ſhall (maugre) be forced to confeſſe, that either there were neuer true Orders in the Church of England (which he dares not ſay) or elſe that they are ſtill Ours. The Biſhops in the time of King Henry the eight, were vndoubted; If they left Rome in ſome corrected opinions, their Character was yet, by confeſſion Quis ignorat Cathol. &amp;c. &amp; ſimiliten Ordinatos verè e

                  , indeleble. They laid their hands according to Eccleſiaſticall conſtitution, vpon the Biſhops

in King Edwards dayes; And they both, vpon the Biſhops in the beginning of Queene Elizabeth; They againe, vpon the ſucceeding Inheritors of their holy Sees, and they laſtly vpon vs; ſo as neuer man could ſhew a more certayne and exquiſite Pedigree from his great Grand-father, then we can from the acknowledged Biſhops of King Henries time, and thence vpwards to hundreds of Generations. I confeſſe indeede, our Archbiſhops and Biſhops haue wanted ſome Aaronicall accouſtrements, Gloues, Rings, Sandals, Miters, and Pall, and ſuch other traſh; and our inferiour Orders haue wanted Greazing and Shauing, and ſome other pelting Ceremonies. But let C. E. proue theſe eſſentiall which wee want, or thoſe Acts and Formes not eſſentiall, which we haue, Et Phyllida ſolus habeto. In the meane time, the Church of England is bleſſed with a true Clergie, and glorious; and ſuch a one, as his Italian Generation may

impotently enuie, and ſnarle at, ſhall neuer preſume to compete with, in worthineſſe and honour; And (as Doctor Taylor, that couragious Martyr, ſaid at his parting) Bleſſed be God for holy Matrimony.

The Greeke Church faith, He cannot bee in holy Orders that is not married: The Romiſh Church faith, Hee cannot bee in holy Orders that is married: The Church Reformed ſayes, He may be in holy Orders that is married, and conuertibly; Some good friends would needs fetch vs into this idle Greciſme, and to the ſociety of the old Friſons

If then (Let him bee the Husband of one Wife) argue that a Biſhop may bee a married man, I haue what I would, and paſſe not for the contrary from Men and Angels. Wee willingly grant with Luther,

Hee purpos'd in this to ſtop the mouthes of Heretikes, that condemned marriage, ſhewing that that estate is faultleſſe, yea, ſo precious, that with it a man might be aduanced to the holy Epiſcopall Chayre. Thus he; Whom their learned Eſp. vbi ſupra. Biſhop Eſpencaeus ſeconds; and by the true force of the Text cleereth this ſenſe, againſt all contradiction. Nec enim

For (ſaith he) thoſe places of Saint PAVL concerning Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons cannot be ſo eluded, as that they doe onely belong to men that haue beene ſometimes married, and are now Widdowers and ſingle; but the Text doth plainly note out Husbands; and thoſe that are now found in the preſent eſtate of marriage; which is implyed, both by the word eſſe, and by vnius vxoris vir; that is, hauing one Wife, not (as ſome haue vnderſtood it) which hath had one; for (as CHRYSOSTOME hath noted) the Apoſtle would by the ſociety of Marriage and Priesthood ſtop the mouthes of Heretikes that condemned Marriage; whereto adde, That the Apoſtle amongſt the vertues of a Biſhop reckons vp this, That he doth gouerne his owne houſe well, not, that hee did gouerne it. Thus he. Vnto which let me yet adioyne this other conſideration, that the Apoſtle deſcribes what manner of Wife a Biſhop ſhould haue; which as in other profeſſions

he hath not done, ſo in this would haue beene vſeleſſe, if he had onely aymed at an eſtate paſt, and not preſent.

Nothing is more playn, then that our Apoſtle (according to the iuſt interpretation of Chryſoſtome, Theodoret, Theophylact, and others) alludes to the looſe faſhion, as of the Greeks, ſo eſpecially of the Iewes, with whom Polygamie and re-marriages, after vniuſt diuorces, were in ordinarie vſe; Theſe the Apoſtolicall Spirit finds vnfit for the Man of God, whom hee therefore charges to be only, The Husband of one Wife.

                  Cainiſme, and ſuperſtition: Howeuer, euen the more vehement of the two, out of this place doth hold Marriage compatible with holy Orders, which is the onely thing I required:Refut. p. 95.

Ambroſe at all controll me herein,Ibid. whiles he teacheth that the Apoſtle doth not here inuite vs to beget children in the Prieſthood; Habentem enim dixit filios, non facientem; we did not challenge hence any command, wee challenge an allowance, which we haue and proclaime: That I may not ſay, ſome Copies of Ambroſe run (according as I haue learned of our eminent Doctor Fulke) Habentem filios, aut facientem; Hauing children, or begetting them: The difference is not worth ſtanding

for; Let it paſſe after his owne reading. I could ſtop his mouth with the ingenuous anſwere of his ESPENCaeVS: Habentem enim, &amp;c.

This Field were wonne, if either this were the Text and not the Gloſſe, or they that thus interpret it were Apoſtles, as they are not. Thus their owne Biſhop. But I neede not call for any ayde. The words of Ambroſe doe plainely driue againſt an inuitation, or command, which wee doe willingly diſclayme.

No, here is a direct allowance.

It is pittie that his Maſters the Ieſuites haue no more Trees for him to ſet with the Rootes vpward: Any thing rather then to wearie the World with this fooliſh clacking.
               Out of this indiſcreet and odious verboſitie (leſt hee ſhould want noyſe) he ſtumbles vpon the Councell of Constantinople before it come in his way, and ſpends a whole leafe only to tell vs, that he will talke of it hereafter. Hereafter hee ſhall receiue anſwere enough; What needes this diſorderly anticipation? To conclude then, this place of our Apoſtle ſtands for vs vnſhaken, by any the impotent blaſts of his friuolous

Eluſions, and ſhall warrant vs againſt Earth and Hell, that a Biſhop may bee the Huſband of one Wife.

Theſe are faire Nets to catch Fooles; Whiles hee heapes vp all the reprochfull termes that ſpight can deuiſe, againſt the verie ſtate of Marriage, in ſome callings, not ſo much as preiudiced by Vow; how doth hee grant Marriage honourable amongſt all?

               For vs, that it is honorable in all eſtates of men by Apoſtolicall warrant, is ſufficient aſſurance, that to no calling, or eſtate it can bee diſhonourable and vnlawfull. But to vntye Bellarmines trifling knot: I ſay, Marriage is honourable,

                  : in all, but not betweene all: That is, euery man may marrie with a woman, but not with any woman whatſoeuer: as with his Mother, or Siſter. So Father and Daughter may marry, but

not one the other. See now what a worthy Meſſe of Sophiſtrie is layd in Saint Pauls diſh by theſe Caruers, and how eaſily ouer-turned: So as I might very well proclaime to all the World (which I doe now confidently ſecond) that if God might be iudge of this Controuerſie, it were ſoone at an end.

to the Miniſters of his Sanctuarie. Herein, how am I refuted? If hee meane (ſaith my Detector) that for puritie and perfection of life, the Law of MOSES was more ſtrict then the Goſpell, the vntruth is notorious; To which he addes out of Hierome, that the greater perfection of the Euangelicall Sacrifice exacteth greater Holineſſe; and concludes, that the permiſsion of Wiues in the Aaronicall Priesthood, argues euidently the imperfection of that Law. So he. Surely, God wanted this Counſellour vpon Mount Sinai; he could haue aduiſed him better Rules of his miſ-contriued Prieſthood.
               Would my Refuter make himſelfe ſo ignorant, as not to know; that notwithſtanding the rather greater perfection of Moralitie required vnder the Goſpell, yet that Leuiticall Law placed impuritie in many of thoſe creatures and actions, wherein the Euangelicall findeth none? Did not the touch of ſome. Veſſels or Garments make a man

legally vncleane? Did not the lawfull act of Coniugall Beneuolence? Did not the accidents of the holyeſt Child-bed carry in them an expiable impuritie? If hee bee not a Iew, hee will not ſay it is ſtill thus vnder the Goſpell. How iuſtly therefore might I inferre, that if our holy God, vnto whoſe Wiſdome it ſeemed good to ſtand of old, vpon ſuch points of outward vncleanneſſes, did notwithſtanding allow Wedlocke to his Prieſthood, much more (at leaſt no leſſe) vnder the Goſpell, doth he allow it, when as all thoſe imputations of impuritie are vaniſhed.

                     Ref. p. 103.104.I Produced the Teſtimonie of their Pope, their Cardinall, their Doctor. Baſils Rule is a ſure one, that the Witneſſes of Enemies are moſt conuictiue. Their Cardinall was Panormitan, Their Pope Pius the ſecond. Their Doctor, Gratian.
                  
For Panormitan; My Refuter likes his words ſo well, that like a ſawcie Fellow he dare pull off his red Hat, and trample it in the Floore; denying his Cardinall-ſhip, and charging him With participation of the Schiſme.
               
               But firſt, hee cannot (I hope) denie him to haue beene their Abbot, then their Archbiſhop; As for his red Hat, it neuer came from Wittenberge nor Geneua; it was of their owne dying; FOELIX the falſe Pope (he ſayes) gaue it him. Reader, the famous Councell of Baſil, conſiſting of no leſſe then foure hundred reuerend Perſons; Cardinals, Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Doctors, gathered and allowed at firſt, by Pope Martin, then by his Succeſſour Eugenius the fourth, afterwards was vpon ſome Politike conſiderations called off by Eugenius; The Fathers of the Councell finding their owne ſtrength, ſtood vpon the right of their Superioritie, and (as they well might) cenſur'd the Pope; hee proceeded

to obſtinacie; thoſe braue ſpirits (vpon ripe conſideration) iuſtly depoſed him. In the roome of this Eugenius, (otherwiſe called Gabriel Condulmarius) was by iuſt number of voyces elected Amadeus the Deuout Duke of Sauoy, and named Foelix the Fift, a man too good for that See; neither had hee euer any ſo great blemiſh in all his life, as the name of a Pope: Volateran can tell vs, what a Kennell of Hounds hee ſhoued to the Ambaſſadours, namely, whole Tables of poore ſoules daily fed by him; All Hiſtories ſpeake of his Deuotion, and Pietie; This man called from his intended retyredneſſe, muſt carrie the Keyes. Hee makes choice of Archbiſhop Panormitan for one of his Cardinals: What offence is here? But hee was a falſe Pope. If the Councell of Baſil were a true Councell, then was Foelix a true Pope. It is in my Readers choice whether he will beleeue foure hundred Diuines repreſenting the whole Church, or

a Popes Paraſite. But Panormitan dyed in the Schiſme againſt Eugenius. The World knowes that the greateſt blot Panormitan euer had, was his violent plea for Eugenius; againſt the Biſhop of Argens, againſt eloquēt Segouius, againſt the whole ſtreame of that Councell; This is the thanke hee now carries away, FOELIX ſcelus virtus vocatur; If Eugenius had not dealt vnder-hand with the Dolphin of France, and Frederick of Auſtria, (then ambitious of the Empire) and tryed all his wits, both to make new Cardinals, and to diuert the Neutralls, Eugenius had not beene foelix; and Foelix had beene ſtill Eugenius, the true and vndoubted Succeſſour of Peter: How-euer, if th

and Writings? eſpecially thoſe which he wrote before hee was Cardinall or Archbiſhop, being onely Abbot: And yet may bee cited by vs vnder the name of Cardinall: as Bellarmines Dictates and Compoſures elder then his red Hat, yet are fathered vpon that Title.

               But in the meane time, ſee the cunning of my Catholike Cauiller; This is not the ſentence I ſtood vpon, of Panormitan; it was not this, whereto I proclaymed mine Oyez, but another, which hee ſlily ſmothers, not daring ſo much as to repeat it, leſt his Romanizing popular

ignorant Readers ſhould heare and ſee and ſmell, that the ſacred Celibate of Prieſts did ſtinke an hundreth yeeres before Luthers time. I will therefore here ſupply for him, and, hoping he will in his next take notice of the ſentence, will repreſent it here againe.

That is, It were better, and more wholeſome for the good and ſaluation of ſoules, if it were left to euery mans will; ſo as they which either cannot, or will not contayne, might marry. For wee finde by experience a contrarie effect to follow vpon that Law of Continencie;

ſince the greateſt part of (our Prieſts) at this day liue not ſpiritually, neither are chaste, but are defiled with vnlawfull copulations, not without their most hainous ſinne; whereas, with their owne Wiues it ſhould be Chaſtitie. Thus he. A ſentence worthie of that Epiphonema of mine, (Is this a Cardinall think you or an Huguenot?)

                  Wee tye not our ſelues to euery mans opinion; and, This ſentence is cenſured by BELLARMINE as erroneous; As if Panormitan were euerie bodie, and Bellarmine an Oracle. It is enough for vs, that one of their owne greateſt, learnedeſt, zealouſeſt Prelates iuſtifyeth our Marriages, and wiſheth them in vſe rather then their Continencie.
               To that other Teſtimonie of Panormitan, he anſwers by a graunt, yeelding vs freely, that if wee take

diuine Law for that which is expreſly determined in Scripture, it muſt needes bee ſaid, that there is no euident proofe ſet downe of continencie in Eccleſiasticall men by the Apoſtles; yet, that it is ſo inſinuated, and the obſeruation of it hath beene ſo ancient,

                  as BELLARMINE noteth, that it may be truely termed Apoſtolical; Thus hee. And euen for this are wee beholden to him; All his friends would not haue beene ſo liberall. His Ioannes Maior, his Clictouaeus, his Torrenſis, and all their rigorous Clients would not haue ſaid ſo: As, on the other ſide, the old Gloſſe was not ſo wiſe, that could onely ſay (which is now expunged) Apoſtoli docuerunt exemplo, The Apoſtles taught this by their example.

                   who becauſe he ſpeakes theſe words (by way of explication) in a continued tenor with a ſentence of Auſtin, is (to my mortall ſinne) cited by me as ſpeaking from Austin. The poſition and the inference of the words is ſuch, as might deceyue any eye that would truſt a Gratian; What might the price be (trow we) of ſuch a crime in the Apoſtolique chamber? In my next Shrift, he ſhal heare, meâ culpà; The words are Gratians, that Copula Sacerdotalis vel conſanguincorum, The marriage or (as this Clerkly Grammarian tranſlates it) the carnall copulation of Prieſts, or kinsfolkes is not forbidden by any Legall, Euangelicall, or Apoſtolicall authoritie, but by Eccleſiaſticall Law it is forbidden. Wee could not hyre a Proctor to ſay more. But herein C. E. hath detected

two foule faults of the citation; The one, that I truſted his Gratian ſo farre, as to make him ſpeake out of Auſtin, which (I truſt) a little Holy-water may waſh off; The other,Refut. p. 106.
                   
                  That I concealed the marriage of kinsfolke, within the prohibited degrees; which (ſaith hee) although onely forbidden by Eccleſiaſticall Law, yet dares not Maſter HALL (I thinke) tranſgreſſe it; ſo as this Law hath greater force then hee ſuppoſeth it to haue. So hee▪ Plainely, my Refuter knowes not what he ſaith, elſe hee would neuer thus palpably plead againſt himſelfe; For what euer thing was there in all the conſtitutiōs of his Church, more ſubiect to variation, then the legall ſupputation of the forbidden degrees? which was a long time confined to the third degree incluſiuely; another while extended to the fourth; and ſometime to the ſeuenth. Let him herein reconcile his Pope Nicholas and Gregorie, with Pope Innocent; Whereof the one

left all free that were without the pale of the fourth degree, the other reſtrayned all to the ſeuenth; And when he finds an vnalterableneſſe in the determination of theſe degrees, let him plead for an equally-fatall neceſſitie of his Eccleſiaſticall continence; in the meane time, let him take it patiently to be beaten with his owne rod.
               No diuine Law then (he grants) hath inioyned this Celibate, but an Eccleſiaſticall. What is this other then I ſaid? God neuer impoſed this Law of continencie; Who then?

                  The Church. And why may not I goe on, to aske, Whether a good wife would gain-ſay what her husband willeth? Flouriſhing will not anſwer this. All the prayſes of beautie and fidelitie which are giuen to the true Church, argue Rome to be the falſe. Whereas therefore the Prieſt ſhuts vp thus brauely; (And this Miniſter who would make the one to gainſay the other, ſhould bring ſome place or ſentence to ſhew the ſame, (which

hee may chance to doe the next morning after the Greeke Calends) or elſe neuer auouch ſo vnchriſtian a Paradoxe. Hee ſhall vnderſtand that his Greeke Calends are paſt. The Spirit of God ſaith, A Biſhop may be the Husband of one wife: The Church of Rome ſayes, A Biſhop may not bee the Husband of any wife at all: Whether is this a contradiction? The Spirit of God ſayes, Marriage is honourable amongſt all men: The Church of Rome ſayes, Marriage is diſhonourable to ſome. The Spirit of God ſayes, To auoyd Fornication, let euery man haue his wife: The Church of Rome, like a quick-huswife, ſayes, Some order of men ſhall not haue a wife, though to auoyd Fornication. Let my Maſſe-Prieſt ſhew theſe to be no contradictions (which he may chance to doe at the Greeke Calends) or elſe grant this to be neyther Paradox, nor vnchriſtian.

               My firſt manifeſt vntruth is, that PIVS the Second ſpake this as out of the Chayre. A witleſſe miſpriſion. I hope he ſate in PETERS Chayre that ſpake it; if hee ſpake it not as from the Chayre, I care for no more. Is not this ſufficient to win reſpect from a Catholique Prieſt?

                  tanquam in ſtercoraria, it is all one to mee. Themſelues

muſt firſt agree what it is to ſpeake as from the Chayre, ere I can affirme that Pius the Second ſo ſpake this. Id Populus curet, I referred the chayre to the man, not to the ſpeech: In the meane time C.

Or it may be he thinks of thoſe ancient ferule-fingred Boy-Popes; one of the Benedicts, a graue Father of ten yeeres old; or Iohn the Thirteenth an aged Stripling of nineteene. Or perhaps, hee alludes to thoſe learned times (within my compaſſe) which were acknowledged in the Councell of Rhemes; where when offer was made of requiring the Popes iudgement, it was publiquely replied, that beſides the expoſedneſſe of that Citie to ſale, Romae iam nullum ferè eſſe qui literas didicerit, There was ſcarce a man at Rome, that could ſpell his Letters.

                  Sacerdotibus magnâ ratione ſublatas nuptias, maiore reſtituendas videri; My firſt fault, is that I turne Sacerdotes, The Clergie, inſtead of Priests; which word is of a larger extent, including alſo Biſhops: The ſilly man ſees not that I tranſlated it to his aduātage, againſt my owne; For, euery Sacerdos is Clericus, not euery Clericus, Sacerdos. Very frequently are Biſhops comprehended vnder the name of Sacerdotes, as well as of Clerus; and no leſſe vſually vnder the name of Clerici, the ſuperior Orders are not comprehended. Hee is not worthy to write himſelfe Prieſt, that vnderſtands

his Orders no better.
               My ſecond error is, That I turned the laſt Clauſe of the Sentence, (Is to bee restored) whereas the words are, Restituendas videri. Here could be no fraud, whiles I ſet the Latin words in the Margine. The Man thinks of his (
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ) or his, Videtur quod ſic; probatur quod non; but if his Grammar had not been ill learned, he had known that (Videri) doth not alwayes ſignifie a doubtfull probabilitie, but ſometimes a certayne euidence, as, Viſum eſt Spiritui Sancto &amp; nobis; and, Qui videbantur columnae; Or (if his Logike had fully taught him the Diſtinctions of Sunt and Videntur) this quarrell had beene ſpared. This Seeming was Beeing; Or, if this lawleſſe Lurker had euer had any taſte of the Ciuill or Canon Law, hee might haue beene able to conſtrue that Maxime, Quod quis per alium facit, per ſe facere videtur: and that iudged Caſe, Qui nomen debitoris legatum viuens exegerit, legatum

ademiſſe videtur. In this ſtile ſpake this learned Pope, which my vnlearned Aduerſarie cannot reach vnto. For, if Pius, or Syluius, may haue leaue to Comment vpon himſelfe, when the Queſtion was of ſuffecting Amadeus, Duke of Sauoy, a married man, in the roome of Eugenius; Ex quo conſtat (ſaith he) &amp;c. It is apparant that not onely hee, which hath beene married, but hee that is married, may bee aſſumed to the Popedome; and a little after: Fortaſſe peius non eſſet, &amp;c. And perhaps it were not worſe if more Priests had wiues, for many would be ſaued in a married Priesthood, which now in a ſingle Priesthood are damned; hee ſaith directly, Damnantur, They are damned, not, They ſeeme to bee damned. And therefore to preuent this reall damnation, Marriage is really to bee reſtored to them, not that it ſhould onely ſeeme to bee reſtored. To conclude, take Videri, for bare Seeming, ſurely, it muſt be conſtrued, Videtur mihi; I Pope
                  
PIVS thinke, or iudge, that it were fit that Priests ſhould haue the liberty of marriage restored againe to them; which together with ſublatas implyeth, that in former times Prieſts were married, and as the caſe now ſtandeth ought againe ſo to be. Which is the very ſtate of this queſtion, which we auouch.
               And in his Epiſtle to Iohn Freûnd, Credimus te non inſulſo vti conſilio; I thinke it is no ill counſell for thee (ſince thou canſt not contayne) to ſeeke for a Wife; although that ſhould haue beene thought of, before thou didst enter into holy Orders; but we are not all Gods, that wee can fore-ſee future things; ſince it is comne to this, that thou canst not reſist the Law of thy Fleſh, it is better for thee to marry, then to burne. Thus he. For which aduice, doubtleſſe, hee found good cauſe in his owne experience; who hauing beene imployed formerly in this Iland of ours, left two Baſtards behind him, the one, begotten of an Engliſh woman, the other, of a Scottiſh;

The one wherof he commends to his Father Syluius, a Citizen of Syenna; the other he confeſſes to his friend P. de Noxeto: But this indeed was before his Prieſthood; Afterwards,Whiles he was Cardinall, he had his Concubine; to whom at laſt he gaue threeſcore Florens for her Dowry, Epist. 361. it is ſtrange what he confeſſes of himſelfe in his 92. Epiſtle: Mihi herclè parum meriti est in castitate; I cannot boaſt of any merit in my chaſtity, for to tell the truth (Magis me Venus fugitat, quàm ego illam horreo) Venus doth rather flie from mee, then I abhorre it. It was not therefore out of ſpeculation, but ſenſe, not out of ſeeming, but certaintie, that Syluius paſſes his Restituendas videri.
               
               So now to ſhut vp this point, the bleſſed Apoſtle Saint Paul, and (in his Attendance) Panormitan, Gratian, and Pius (in their cleere ſuffrages for vs) are fully acquitted from the vaine cauils of my Detector; and God is on my ſide, the Church of Rome, on his. Let Sinceritie iudge which Scale of the Ballance is heauier.

                  That which is first, is trueſt; My Detector finds here a flat contradiction, and cryes out, Doe theſe men wake or ſleepe when they write? There are none of his wiſe friends which will not bee aſhamed of this groſſe ſtupiditie; For whether of theſe two Sentences can he diſlike? and if both bee allowable, how can they be contradictorie? neither am I his Aduerſarie herein, but Tertullian. What ſurer way could there be, then to controll the pretences of a ſecondarie antiquitie by the firſt? And what contradiction is in this? The firſt is true, all vnder the firſt is

obnoxious to errour; The puiſne poſthumous Antiquitie hath beene a refuge for falſhood, the Primigenious Antiquitie (which proceeded from the ancient of Dayes) is certayne. Let this Trifler goe learne to ſpell Engliſh, ere he preſume to Diuinitie. This Antiquitie is the touch, whereby wee deſire all truth to bee tried; which eaſily finds all the gilded Coynes of Romiſh innouations, ſhamefully counterfait.
               Not to goe backe ſo farre as Paradiſe (though I well might) where God made the firſt wedding in perfect innocence. I began with Moſes and his Leuiticall Brotherhood; to which my Refuter replyes;Refut. p. 111.
                   
                  That yet in eating their Paſchall Lambe they had their loynes girt. Iuſtly concluded! All the Iewes did eate the Paſchall Lambe with their loynes girt, for the expedition, or moment of their flight, therefore their Prieſts and Leuites did not conuerſe with their Wiues. If his Superiours of Doway doe not bluſh at this Logike,

his wit and their ſhame are gone together.
               But, They abſtayned (hee ſaith) from their Wiues, whiles they did minister in the Sanctuarie; What if we yeeld this? Their miniſtration was by courſes, and had intermiſſions. There is an holy and decent modeſtie in all thoſe which are worthy to ſerue at the Altar, which teacheth them to giue God his due times, with reſpect euen of outward purity; which is all that Euſeb. de praep.

                      not read to haue had any wife at all; What of this? He, whom he prefigured was

onely a ſpirituall Huſband to his Church. If this Man bee not read to haue had a Wife; no more is he read to haue had Father or Mother. Nay, he is read to haue had neither. Why do they not thence infer that Prieſts ought to haue neither, but to be begotten and borne of Angels, not of humane kinde? which is as good for an inference, as that fopperie is for a Legendarie fable, that Luther was begotten by an Incubus. Yet had the Literall (not myſticall) Melchiſedec both Father and Mother: and if Sem were Melchiſedec (as wiſer men then mine Aduerſarie haue vpon good probabilities thought) he may paſſe, I hope, for a married man.
               As for the perfection of the new Law aboue the old, it onely barres thoſe inſtitutions which had in them an imperfection, not thoſe which God thought fit for Paradiſe it ſelfe. So as the practice of the Iewiſh Church, founded by God himſelfe, is an all-ſufficient warrant for the marriage of his Euangelicall Miniſters.

                  and they who were married before, did leaue their Wiues. I vrge Saint Pauls report of the reſt of the Apoſtles, and the Brethren of the Lord and Cephas, that they not onely had Wiues, but 1. Cor. 9.5. carried them along in their Trauels. He anſweres, They were not Wiues, but other deuout Women, which followed them to administer maintenance to them. A likely tale, if they could all agree in it; That the Apoſtles would caſt off their owne Wiues, and carry about ſtrange Women with them, vpon what-euer pretence. Credat Iudaeus apella, Non ego. Yet my ſhameleſſe Refuter cryes out of my pride and ignorāce in not allowing this, which hee dares proclaime for the receiued expoſition of all the Fathers, and

all that euer wrote in the Greek and Latin Church. When hee knowes that his Clem. Recognit. l. 7.

                  To lead about. The Apoſtle ſpeakes of a matter of charge to the Church, by this circumduction; Now that rich Matrones ſhould follow the Apoſtles, and miniſter to them of their ſubſtance, was a matter of eaſe to the Church. Neither was this attendance for miniſtration, ſo much an act of Cephas, and the other Apoſtles, as a voluntarie act of the women themſelues. To conclude, in this the Apoſtles practice ſhould haue croſſed their doctrine. For if Saint Paul gaue

that charge (of being the Huſband of one Wife) on purpoſe Chryſ. Hom. in Tit. praecitat. (as Chryſoſtome ſaith) to ſtop the mouth of the Enemies to Marriage; how muſt this needes open them againe, and breed a conceit of that impuritie, which Saint Paul meant to oppoſe, that the Apoſtles themſelues as aſhamed of their wiues, forſook them, and choſe rather to bee attended by Strangers?
               So as I muſt take leaue to bee euer in this Hereſie, that the Apoſtles had Wiues, and carryed them about.

The Teſtimonie of Saint Ignatius (ſaith hee) is a meere forgerie; eaſily anſwered. If Ignatius had either denyed or diſliked theſe Marriages, no mans word had beene more authentike; now, this clauſe hath made him falſified: Hee cannot (I hope) ſay that the ſentence came out of our Forge; wee take him as wee finde him; neither doth B. Eſpenceus, or any other ingenuous Writer, take ſuch exception, but finds the authority weighty.

                     Platin. in Cleto. ad finem. Luke liued 84. yeeres, hauing a Wife in Bithynia. Hauing not a Wife in Bithynia. 
                  Vxorē habens in Bithynia. Now comes the Onuphrian Edition ſet forth at Coleine. An. 1600. from the ſhop of Materuus Colinus, and reades, Vxorem non habens in Bithynia; with which authoritie Eſpencaeus himſelfe was deceiued, citing Hierome for it as the Fountaine, whence perhaps Platina might fetch it; but if my Reader pleaſe to turne to that Her. Catol. ſcript. Illuſtr. Catalogue of famous Writers, aſcribed (not vniuſtly) to Hierome, there ſhall hee finde the very ſame coozenage; the words run ſo indeed, in the Latine printed Copies; but not acknowledged, not mentioned by Sophronius in the Greeke Tranſlation; and Eraſmus, reading it either, Hauing, or not hauing, at laſt ſhuts vp; Haec verba videntur adiecta;

quandoquidem nec adduntur apud SOPHRONIVM, nec in exemplaribus emendatioribus. Theſe words (ſaith ERASMVS) ſeeme patched to the rest; ſince they neither are added in SOPHRONIVS, nor in the better Copies. Thus hee. It was fit my READER ſhould haue a taſte of the Romane integritie.
               I alleaged the learned Cardinall Caietan for the likelihood of S. Pauls Marriage; Can my Refuter denie this? The words are plaine: Caiet. Com. in Phil. c. 4. Quia omnes Apoſtoli exceptis Ioanne &amp; Paul

as I wonder they haue eſcaped the Romane Purgations. As for thoſe other nine or tenne noted Counterfeits, which I ioyned herewith for companie, in that Epiſtle, his ſhame would ſerue him to iuſtifie, if his leaſure would; whereas there is ſcarce one of them whome his owne Authours haue not branded.

                  My Refuter muſt haue a fling; In an idle excurſion therefore he iuſtly rayles on the Proteſtant practice, in reiecting thoſe Fathers for Baſtardie one while, whome otherwhiles they cite for currant; when his owne eminent impudencie in the very paſſage next going before, and in the next following (to goe no further) offends in the ſame kinde. The truth is; The Proteſtants take libertie to refuſe thoſe Fathers, whom euen ingenuous Papiſts haue cenſured as baſe; The Papiſts take libertie, when they lift, to reiect the authoritie of thoſe Fathers, whoſe Truth they cannot denie. The inſtances hereof would bee endleſſe.

But with what face can any Papiſt taxe vs for this, when all the World may ſee aboue three hundred and twentie of their Authours, whome after the firſt allowance they haue either ſuppreſſed, or cenſured? To their eternall and open conuiction, Doctor Iames (whome they may reuile, but ſhall neuer anſwere) hath collected and publiſhed the names, and pages.

That no Biſhop, Preſbyter, or Deacon ſhal forſake or caſt off his Wife in pretence of Religion, or Pietie, vpon paine of depoſition. Wherewith how much my Refuter is preſſed, appeares in that he is faine with Baronius
                  
to auoyd it, with, Apocryphorum non est tanta authoritas; There is no ſo great authoritie in Apocryphall Canons.

Hee hath caſt off Ignatius alreadie, anon you ſhal find him reiecting Socrates, Sozomen, Nicephorus, Gratian, Sigebert, H.

of Matrimoniall conuerſation, is apparantly expreſſed in thoſe Canons of Conſtantinople, how-euer the extent of it in regard of ſome perſons is reſtrayned. There is no way therefore to vntye this knot, but by cutting it; and my cauilling Prieſt with his Jeſuites may gnaw long enough vpon this bone, ere they ſuck in any thing from hence, but the bloud of their owne iawes.

ſhall not be lawfull for a Biſhop, Prieſt, or Deacon, vpon pretence of Pietie, to put away his Wife. Thus he.
               From all which it is not hard to ſee, that in thoſe yong dayes of the Church, the myſtery of iniquitie began in this point to worke; ſo as Marriage, according to the Apoſtles prediction, beganne to bee in an ill name, though the cleere Light of that Primitiue Truth would not indure the diſgrace.
               So as in all this I haue both by Moſes, and the Examples of that Leuiticall Prieſthood; by the Teſtimonie of the Apoſtles, by their practice, by their anciently-reputed Canons, &amp; by the teſtimony of the agedeſt Fathers, ſo made good the lawfulneſſe and antiquity of the Marriages of perſons Eccleſiaſtical, that I ſhall not need to feare a Diuorce either from my Wife, or from the Truth, in that my Confident and iuſt Aſſertion.

                   ſince in this poynt wee haue happily wonne the day, leſſe labour needs in the other. It is ſafe erring with Moſes and the Prophets, with CHRIST and his Apoſtles; Soone after (according to S. Pauls propheſie) Spirits of Errors were abroad; and whether out of the neceſſarie exigence of thoſe proſecuted

times, or out of an affectation to win fauour and admiration in the eyes of Gentiliſme, Virginitie began to rayſe vp it ſelfe in ſome priuate conceits, vpon the ruines of honeſt Wedlocke; neyther is it hard to diſcerne by what degrees; yet, neuer with ſuch abſolute ſucceſſe, as to proceed to any Law of reſtraint. I doe not therefore fayne to my ſelfe (as mine idle Refuter) golden ages of mirth and 
                  Though Amram the Leuite, father to Moſes, married in the heat of Pharaohs perſecution: and Dauid did the like in Sauls.
                   
                  marrying, vnder thoſe tyrannous perſecutions, but in thoſe bloudie ages, I doe auouch to him, and the World, an immunitie from the Tyrannous yoke of forced continencie. This if hee could haue diſproued by any iuſt inſtances, he had not giuen vs words.

The ſame perſwaſion (ſaith he) might bee made to S. PETERS daughter (as many are of opinion that he had one) yet will it not follow that hee knew his wife, after he was an Apoſtle. So he. But what needs this parentheſis, if the man bee true to his owne Authors? Did wee deuiſe the Storie of Petronilla? Did wee inuent the paſſage of her Sutor Flaccus; Of her Feuer, the cure whereof her father denyed? Of her Epitaph ingrauen in Marble, by her fathers owne hand; Aureae Petronillae, dilectiſsimae filiae, To my deare and precious PETRONILLA, my most beloued daughter, found by Paul the Firſt?

let him giue the lye to his Hiſtories, or elſe let him compute the Time when Flaccus, the Roman Count, was a Sutor to her, and ſee if he be not forced to grant that ſhee was begotten of S. Peter after his Apoſtleſhip: And ſo (for ought hee knowes) might thoſe ſonnes bee whom Origen thus dehorteth; This man was not their Mid-wife. The place of Origen which hee Orig. Homil. 13. in Numer. cites to the contrary, he tooke vp ſomewhat on truſt: let him goe and inquire better of his Creditor; by the ſame token, that in the Homily of Origen, whither he ſends vs, hee ſhall finde nothing but Balaams Aſſe; an obiect fit for his meditation.

                   to the purpoſe of my allegation. Origen ſpeakes of that Text, Many that are first, ſhall be last, &amp;c. Which he applyes as a cooling-card to the children of Chriſtian parents, eſpecially

                  Si fuerint ex patribus Sacerdotali ſede dignificatis, If they be the ſonnes of them which are dignified with Sacerdotall honour; The change of the Prepoſition is remarkeable, ex patribus, arguing that he ſpeakes not of their education, but their deſcent, and therefore implying no leſſe then I affirmed, that their parentage giues them a ſuppoſed cauſe of exaltation.

                   My wiſe Refuter, after hee hath idlely gone about the buſh a little, comes out with this dry verdict, What will Master HALL hence infer? That Biſhops and Priests may lawfully marrie? Saint ATHANASIVS ſaith it not, but onely recounteth the fact,

that ſome marryed of both ſorts, but whether they did well or ill, or whether himſelf did approue or condemne the ſame, there is no word in this ſentence. Thus he. We take what he giues, and ſeeke for no more; Wee cited Athanaſius in ſtead of many Hiſtories, not of many Arguments, Hiſtories de facto, not diſcourſes de iure; The lawfulneſſe was diſcuſſed before, the practice and vſe is now inquired of. This Athanaſius witneſſes, and C. E. yeelds; Wherein yet I may not forget to put my Refuter in minde, how brittle his memorie is; who in the ſame leafe contradicts himſelfe; For when hee had before confeſſed that ATHANASIVS doth neyther approue nor condemne the practice, eyther as good or euill,
                  Refut. p. 136.
                   now he plainely tels vs, that the words were not ſpoken by way of ſimple narration, but of miſlike and reprehenſion. He would be a good lyer if he could agree with himſelfe. Why of diſlike? For (ſaith hee) it was neuer lawfull for Monkes or

Biſhops to beget children. Ipſe dixit, wee muſt beleeue him;Chryſ. ad Hebr.

                  ) it is poſsible with marriage to doe the acts of Monkes: nor to conuince him with counter-teſtimonies, let him tel me what fault it is, to doe or not to doe miracles? Theſe in this ſentence of Athanaſ. ibid. We haue knowne Biſhops working miracles, and Monkes working none; Many Biſhops not to haue married, &amp;c. As likewiſe you may find Biſhops to haue beene fatherr of Children, and Monkes not to haue ſought for marriage. ATHANASIVS, goe in the ſame ranke with Marriage. But, to cleare Athanaſius, he brings Hierom againſt Vigilantius, (impudently called by him, The father of the Proteſtants, who would haue all Clergie-men to marrie; when his verie Rhemiſts haue checkt him for this ſlander) pleading againſt that neceſſitie, from which wee haue oft waſht our hands; when as the ſame Author againſt Iouinian affirmes de facto, the ſame with Athanaſius, and vs.
               To ſay then that Athanaſius ſpoke this only of lewd licentious Monks or Biſhops, is but the leud libertie of a licentious tongue that hath

ouer-runne both Truth and it ſelfe.
               From hence this Orator, this parcell of wit, flyes out into a pleaſant frumpe, as hee thinkes, but indeed an vgly, inhumane, lothſome ribaudrie, ill-beſeeming the mouth of any that was borne of a woman, I will not ſay whether ill or well beſeeming the pen of a Virgine-Prieſt, forſooth ſo pure and Angelical, that marriage would vn-Saint him. His vnmanly vnnaturall Stile belcheth thus:

had denyed to pay, Taxam Camerae. As for Ochius, allowing Polygamie, and perhaps other worſe obliquities in his opinions, what are they to vs? For the marriage of P.

Euen ſuch a one (good ſir Shorne) as is framed by the confidence of honeſt innocencie. God deale ſo with my ſoule, as it meanes nothing but ingenuous ſinceritie; neyther hath my penne ſwarued one letter

from the Text: My margine ſayd, Numidicus Presbyter;
                  
                     Numideus Prieſt. ſo doth Cyprian himſelfe, two or three lines before this report of his wife; ſo (beſides the Text) doth the margine of Eraſmus. And what trechery could it be to adde the word of CYPRIANS owne explication? But Numidicus was not then Prieſt when his wife was martyred; rather vpon that conſtancie was honoured with holy Orders. How appeares that, when Cyprian onely ſayes,Let Numid. the Prieſt be receiued into the number of the Prieſts of Carthage, &amp;c.
                   
                  Numidicus Presbyter aſcribatur Presbyterorum Carthaginenſium numero &amp; nobiſcum ſedeat in clero. He was before a Prieſt, for ought this Libeller, or any mortall man knowes, and now was aſcribed into the honoured Clergie of Carthage, ſoone after to be promoted to Epiſcopall dignitie. Before the report therefore of his wiues martyrdome, he is named a Prieſt. What haue I offended in ſeconding Saint Cyprian? Let this peremptory babbler proue this ordination to bee after that

noble proofe of his faith. I ſhall confeſſe my ſelfe miſtaken in the time, neuer falſe in mine intentions.

                   but he ſhall neuer anſwere it. After his old guiſe therefore hee falls to his Hatchet, and when hee hath tried to bow it a little and finds it ſtiffe, hee cuts it vp by the rootes. What one word can hee controll in the Relation of Socr. l. 1. c. 8. Sozom. l. 1. c. 22.
                   
                  Socrates, or mine Illation? The Biſhops went about to bring in a new Law of Continency to be impoſed vpon their Clergie, ſaith Socrates and Sozomen; therefore, before it was not. Paphnutius reclaymed, and called that yoke heauie and vnſupportable, the vſe of the Marriage-bed, Chaſtitie. The iſſue was, Potestas permiſſa cuique pro arbitratu; Euery man left to his owne libertie. The ſtorie is plaine, there is no place for cauils. The only comfort that my Detector and his Tutors finde in the Hiſtorie, is,Refut. p 143.
                   that Paphnutius is not all ours: He calls

for the vſe of Marriage to the wedded Clergie, not for wedlocke of the vn-married. True; therein I muſt retort the anſwere of Sotus, that the good Martyr gaue way to the corruption of the Times; wherein the wicked myſterie had begunne with Saint Pauls (
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  .) But in the meane time, let him know, that if Paphnutius plead but by halues for vs, hee pleads againſt them altogether; yea, this hee knowes alreadie, elſe he would neuer be ſo audacious as to condemne the authors for vnſincere, and fabulous, yea heretical; and to bring the clamours of his Bellarmine, to diſcredit Socrates in three groſſe vntruths, and Sozomen with Multa mentitur.
                  Refut. p. 146.
                   O impudency without meaſure, without example! Caſsiodorus, and Epiphanius, Socrates, Sozomen, Nicephorus, graue and approued Authors of our Eccleſiaſticall Storie, for but reporting one piece of an Hiſtorie, in fauour of Clergy-mens marriages, are ſpit vpon, and diſcarded with diſgrace.

This is no new Song; my Refuter hath learned it of Copus, Torrenſis, Bellarmine, Baronius, and others. All whoſe mouthes together with his, in theſe particular exceptions, let mee ſtop with that ingenuous anſwere of Eſpenc. l. 1. de Contin. B. Eſpencaeus, there needs no other Aduocate; Excipit Torrenſis, &amp;c. But TORRENSIS excepts againſt SOCRATES and SOZOMEN, as though they had lewdly, and ſhamefully belyed this ſtory of PAPHNVTIVS, and ſayes, the one was a friend of the Nouatians, the other an abettor of THEODORVS the Heretike; that both their Histories are in this void of credit, authoritie, probabilitie. As if they could not at once be bad Men, and yet good Historians; or, if they lie in any other place, they must needs lie in this; For SOZOMEN, TRITEMIVS commends him for a worthy furtherer of ſecular learning, &amp; well verſed in the Scriptures.

Wiues, whom they had before lawfully married. Thus he. A place that anſwers for it ſelfe, and many others. Wherin yet my Refuter finds ſome of my faultie concealements. Firſt, that the more, and more famous Biſhops and Prieſts did the contrarie. True, they did ſo, but voluntarily as with vs ſome of the Heads of our Clergie, and others of the Body, doe contayne, not forced,

Theſe hee will conuince of a double lye. The one, that HELIODORVS was the first authour of the law of Continency in Theſſalia, the other, that this Continency was arbitrary. His reaſon for the former is waightie; It is not likely (ſaith hee) that HELIODORVS, which would rather loſe his Biſhoprick then recall his laſciuious booke, would be ſo eager aboue the reſt for the continency of his Clergie. As if euer any men had beene more luxurious then the greateſt enemies to Marriage; as if it were impoſſible for Pope Iohn the thirteenth (from whom Dunſtan receiued his rigorous Commiſſion) to bee vnnaturally inceſtuous; as if it were impoſſible for his great Prelate of Crema, when he came to oppoſe

Ridiculous head! What Schole-boy, what apprentice knows not HELIODORVS? Noſque manum ferulae, &amp;c. If this learned Critick had but euer opened the Booke, hee had found

And now all in a rage my Refuter will proue againſt Socrates, that there was a Law for this; and to this purpoſe, he brings in two Canons of the Canſtantinopolitane Councell in Trullo: Marke, Reader, with what iudgment. The Trullan Councell was aboue two hundred yeers after: Socrates ended his Hiſtorie in the yeere Hiſtor. Sacr. ad finem. 443. The Trullan Councell was held (as their Binius computes it) in the yeer 692. and yet the Canon of the Trullan Councell, in a matter of fact, diſproues Socrates. The other Councels of Ancyra, Caeſarea, and Nice,
                  
are either Prouincial, or againſt him. As for the plea of Syneſius, that hee might not bee a Biſhop, becauſe hee would not leaue his Wife, it is anſwered by the fact of Syneſius, that hee was made a Biſhop, and left not his Wife. But what an idle and inſolent boldneſſe is this, for an obſcure Libeller, to goe about now almoſt 1200. yeeres after, to controll a graue approued Hiſtorian of the Church, in a matter of ordinary practice, which his owne eyes and the worlds did daily witneſſe; As if he durſt haue publiſhed ſuch a report of the cōmon vſe of his time, wherein all the Age he liued in, could haue conuinced him?

                  The time is ſhort.

               I Deſcend to the Teſtimonie of Gratian; Champion E. calls this, Picking of Strawes. If picking of Strawes be boyes-play, and argue that they which vſe it are foyled, and haue loſt all, as our Refuter merrily pipeth, let him acknowledge how beggerly the proofs are grown of the martyrdome of their Saintly

Ieſuites and Prieſts amongſt vs, did they not ſtoope to picke ſtrawes, to threſh out a miracle (when it was) for tranſlating Father Garnet from a Traytor to a Martyr; yea and that Chaffe, the gullery whereof themſelues ſmile at here, is deuoutly tranſported beyond the Seas, and enſhrined for a ſacred relique, and proclaymed by their Kornmānus for one of the great Wonders of the Dead; Ridet aruſpex vbi aruſpicem viderit.
               
               It is well that the great Compiler of the Canon Law of Rome is growne ſo baſe with Catholique Prieſts. He witneſſes plainely, that ſome Biſhops of Rome were the ſonnes of Prieſts not ſpurious, but begot in lawfull Wedlocke; Diſt. 56. Cenomanens em. &amp;c. Which was (according to Gratian) euery-where lawful to the Clergie, before the prohibition. C. E. bites the lip at this authoritie, and firſt he tells vs, it is the Palea,

                   not Gratian. But if this be chaffe, there is no Corne. Reader, try by this

the egregious impudence of this fellow. Turne to the place, thou ſhalt find the words to be none but Gratians; and the notes allowed by publique authoritie, openly to confirme it: Hic apertè oſtendit Gratianus ſe in ea fuiſſe opinione, &amp;c. Here GRATIAN openly ſhewes that he was in that opinion, that heretofore the Priests of the Latine Church might be marryed.

                  Secondly, my parentheſis diſpleaſes him (As now, a dayes) But what needes this quarrell? He muſt grant, if the Romiſh Prieſts haue ſonnes, they can bee no other then ſpurious. It is his beſt not to preſſe this poynt too farre. This idle iealouſie of his can argue no good. I touched not the continencie of his Paulus Quintus, ſo much as in my thought, I onely wiſh that his Holineſſe would beſtow ſome of the offals of his Nephewes great Benefices, vpon this Maſſe-Prieſt for the reward of his ſuperflouos Oleum peccatorum.

(and that a groſſe one) is, that I ſay many Biſhops of Rome followed their Fathers in the Pontificall Chayre: whereas in this Chaffe of Gratian, hee findes but one: Syluerius Pope, ſonne of Syluerius Biſhop of Rome. And what if in his chaffe hee finde but one, whiles I in my Corne-heape can finde more? Did I tye my ſelfe in this clauſe onely to Gratian? Was not Pope Iohn the Eleuenth, or, in ſome accounts, the Tenth, ſonne to Pope Sergius? And is there no Chayre Pontificall but the Romane? Was not Theodorus Pope, ſonne to Theodorus Biſhop of Ieruſalem? Faelix the Third, ſonne to Biſhop Valerius? Pope Adrian the Second, ſonne to Biſhop Taralus? His Platina can ſupply his Gratian in theſe.

                  ) or neither. It is enough for me, that Gratian, Caranza, Eſpencaeus, and other his owne great Maſters call it familiarly both Sixt, and Generall; In this I cannot but be ſafe enough. I grant, that (to ſpeake preciſely) the ſixt Synode vnder Conſtantine publiſhed no Canons, but afterwards many of the ſame Fathers, which had formerly met in the ſixt Synod, and others, to the number of 227. being called together by the then penitent and reſtored Iustinian (

                  Quae est haec ignorantia, &amp;c? What ignorance (ſaith hee) is this, wherewith many men are tainted, about theſe Canons? For it is a ſcandall to doubt whether they were the Canons of the ſixt Synod. Let theſe men therefore know, that the ſixt Synod was gathered in the time of CONSTANTINE, against thoſe which aſcribe one only action and will to Christ; The Fathers then condemning thoſe Heretikes, and confirming the Oxthodoxe Faith about the fourteenth yeere of CONSTANTINE, returned home: After foure or fiue yeeres, the ſame Fathers (being met vnder IVSTINIAN the ſon of CONSTANTINE) ſet forth the foreſaid Canons; Neither let any man doubt of this; For thoſe very ſame Fathers which in the time of CONSTANTIN ſubſcribed, did alſo vnder IVSTINIAN ſubſigne this preſent Paper; which thing is euident enough by the vnchangeable likeneſſe of their owne hands.

               Reader, compare the Canon with

the words of my ingagement, I vndertooke thou ſhouldeſt find no decree could bee made more peremptorie, more cautelous, more full and abſolute for the lawfulneſſe of the marriage of Eccleſiaſticall perſons.
               For firſt; The Fathers profeſſe herein to croſſe the practice and decree of the Roman Church. Secondly, They profeſſe the coniugall cohabitations of ſacred perſons to ſtand by the Apoſtolike Canons, and to bee a ſincere, exquiſite, and orderly conſtitution. What could be ſaid more? They (thirdly) ratifie this libertie for euer. They (fourthly) giue charge that no man by the cohabitation with his lawfull wife, bee hindred from aſcending to the higheſt degree of holy Orders.(Fiftly) That in the time of their Ordination. it be not ſo much as required of them, to abſtayne from the lawfull companying with their Wiues; which were (ſay they) to offer iniurie to marriage ordayned by God, and bleſſed by his preſence; and to

croſſe him that ſaid, Thoſe whom God hath ioyned together, let no man ſeparate
                  ▪ and, Marriage is honorable Amongst all, &amp;c. (Sixtly) That if any man ſhall preſume ſo farre, as to offer to debarre any Prieſt, Deacon, or Subdeacon, from the coniunction and ſocietie with his lawfull Wife, he ſhall be depoſed; Or if any Prieſt or Deacon ſhall voluntarily caſt off his wife, vpon pretence of Religion, that he ſhall be ſuſpended, and (if he goe on) depoſed. Iudge now whether herein my proteſtation haue erred; Not that there can be no circumſtance deuiſed, as of the extent of the perſons, or time, or manner, wherein curioſitie might inlarge the ſcope of this libertie (ſo I neuer meant:) but if this one point (That the marriage of perſons Eccleſiasticall is lawfull) can bee more fully and warily ſet downe, let mee lye open to cenſure; if not, hate the vanitie of this idle Mountebanke, and confeſſe with Ariſtophanes,

The Parlamentall Law in the time of King Edward, was (I grant) more full in extending the libertie, could not bee more full in auouching the lawfulneſſe of our Marriages. Where I muſt take leaue to tell my Refuter, that the compariſon he preſumes to make of King Edwards Parlament, with the proceedings of Iacke Straw, Wat Tiler, &amp;c. is, like himſelfe, ſedicious and trayterous. And what maruell if ſuch repyners blow out the foggy vaporous blaſt of ſedicious words, againſt our higheſt Court of Parlament, which ſome of their Companions haue attempted to blow vp with a blaſt of fire? This Conſtitution was not ciuill onely, but Synodicall: And may not a lawfull Synod or Conuocation, with the concurrence of the three States, and the ſway of Royall authoritie, make or re-eſtabliſh a Law agreeable

to the Word of GOD, and the receiued practice of their Progenitors, but euery Iacke-ſawce of Rome ſhall thus odiouſly dare to controll and diſgrace it? One of his Capitoline gods of Rome called England his Aſſe;Etiam Aſinus meus recalcitrat? So it was whiles it might beare nothing but his Trumperie, and goe but where his Groomes would either lead, or driue it: now that it hath taken heart, and (with Cardinall Campegius his Sumpter) caſt off this baſe lode; and hath haply ouerrunne this ſeruitude; they are readie, with the Keeper of metamorphoſed Apuleius, to ſeeke a deſperate remedie from the next Tree.

And now according to the old wont, (after hee hath tryed to ſhift off, Matrimonio copulantur, with the ſleeuleſſe euaſion of a falſe gloſſe (.i. vtuntur) which Caietan hath ſufficiently confuted for vs) he fals to a flat reiection of Gratian, and tels vs, out of BELLARMINE,Caiet.

                  That Canon to be perhaps of no authoritie, but an errour of the Collectors. Good God! what face haue theſe men? That none of their

receiued Authours can bee produced againſt them, but they are ſtraight counterfeit; and yet the very ſame, where they ſpeake for them, canonicall? Their Clyents, if they might but know theſe trickes, would be aſhamed of their Patrones.
               
                  Refut. p. 204.
                  That the Clergie not only of the Eaſt might Matrimonio copulari, but of the Weſt alſo might Matrimonium contrahere (which are the words they are vnwilling to know in their owne Canon Law) ſhew ſufficiently that they not only were marryed of old, but might marry; But for the Eaſterne Clergie, it is freely granted by all ingenuous ſpirits; in ſo much as Eſpencaeus tels vs, that neuer Authour, either olde or new imputed this for a fault vnto the Greeke Church, that their Clergie was marryed.
               
                  
                     Refut. p. 206.207.What ſhall wee ſay then to this bold Bayard, that compares this toleration of Marriage in the Greeke Church, with MOSESES permiſsion of the Bill of Diuorce vnto the Iewes?
                  
As if Marriage had beene only tolerated, not allowed; as if vniuſt Diuorce were a fit match for lawfull Wedlocke; whiles he here talkes of Duritia cordis, well may we talke of his Duritia frontis. It is true, euery Church, euery Countrey, hath their Cuſtomes and Faſhions; which Ioannes Maior pleades againſt Bedaes Cenſure of the Engliſh and Scottiſh and Brittiſh obſeruation of Eaſter,) and may bee as iuſtly in this caſe pleaded for vs; This was of olde no leſſe ours, then the Greekes; And if any Church will bee preſcribing againſt God, wee haue no ſuch Cuſtome, nor the Church of God;
                     Refut. p. 207.208. But what a ridiculous inſinuation it is, that the Greeke Prieſts are diſpenſed with by ſupreme authoritie Eccleſiaſticall? Forſooth, by the Pope of Rome. Faine would I learne wher
                     •
                   vpon what termes, at what rate the Graecians purchaſed in the Court of Rome Diſpenſation for their Marriages.
               I would my Refuter had the Office

appointed him to ſhuffle ouer all the Records of the Apoſtolike Chamber, till hee find ſuch a grant made propter duritiem cordis; then ſhould a great deale of good Paper eſcape the miſerie of being beſmeared by his Pen.
               What ſtrange fantaſtike Dreames are put vpon the World? Where the Papacie cannot preuaile, there forſooth his Holineſſe diſpenſeth. The Greeke Church admitteth marryed Prieſts, the Pope diſpenſeth with them; They deny and defie the Popes Supremacies; I trow he diſpē
                  ſeth with them for that too: and why not with the Church of England? Wee pay no Peter-pence; wee runne not to Rome-market to buy traſh, I hope his Holineſſe diſpenſeth with vs for theſe Peccadillo's; wee take libertie here to marrie rather then to burne, why ſhould wee not hope to receiue that Diſpenſation whereof wee heard the newes of late from a poore Bankrupt Carryer? Ad populum phaleras.

                   which his ſagacitie finds (not without much ſcorne) in the two Parlamentall Lawes of the Father, and the Sonne King Henrie the Eighth, and King Edward the Sixt; whereof the one forbids, the other allowes the Marriage of Eccleſiaſtiques, it needed not haue bin any wonder to a learned Prieſt, which might haue known Councels enow, diametrally oppoſite to each other: what fault was it in the recouerd blind man, that he firſt ſaw men walke like Trees, and after like men? Euen the beſt man may correct himſelfe. Neither was there here any contradiction. King Henrie ſpake with the Romane Church, (whoſe one halfe of him then was) King Edward ſpake with the Scriptures, and purer antiquitie: King Henry neuer ſaid, God diſallowed theſe Marriages, King Edward neuer

ſaid, they were allowed by the Romiſh Church.
               And why may not wee draw out the like abſurditie out of Queene Maries Parliaments; wherein ſhe reuerſed many things eſtabliſhed by King Edward; as in this very Caſe concerning Marriage of Prieſts? May not wee hereupon aske, What will you ſay to ſuch Parliaments wherein the Brother is thwarted by the Siſter, and that with the conſent of the moſt of the ſame Parliament-men enacting in a few yeeres contrarily?
               Or as if it were any newes with Popes reſcindere acta praedeceſſorum; euen of thoſe which immediately preceded them? Who knowes not the Storie of Pope Formoſus, and Stephanus, and the many and ſtrong contradictions of decrees in the frequent, long, and deſperate Schiſmes of the Romiſh Church?
               This laſh is indifferently fit for all backes; let him that hath no cauſe to ſmart, complaine.
               
                  What needed this foule mouth then to breake forth into ſo palpable ſlanders of that holy Archbiſhop and Martyr Doctor Cranmer,

                   charging him with deepe diſſimulation, in ſoothing vp both theſe Kings in their contrarie Decrees? When it is moſt manifeſt, that this worthy Metropolitan was the only man, which durſt for three daies together, openly in Parliament oppoſe thoſe wickedly proiected Articles of King Henrie; and this in ſpeciall. In ſo much, as hee was willed out of the houſe, till the act might paſſe; which (notwithſtanding hee well knew King Henry) hee ſtoutly refuſed. Would this man (thinke we) care to belye all the Saints in Heauen for an aduantage? What will not hee dare to ſay, that will obiect inconſtancie to him who ſealed Gods Truth with his bloud?
               The contradictions and weakneſſes that hee findes in this Synode of Constantinople,

                  Gangra, with the Decree of his Pope Hildebrand; The Councell ſayes flatly, Si quis diſcernit Presbyterum coniugatum, &amp;c.

mentions the Concilium Vaſenſe, which was yet later, in the time of Leo the Firſt. When his Authors can agree of the time, and make good the Synod, he ſhall receiue an anſwer to it: In the meane time, it was eyther before the Councell of Nice, or after it; if before, it was corrected by the Nicene; a Prouinciall muſt yeeld to a Generall; if after, it was preſumptuous, in decreeing that peremptorily which the generall determinately left free.

But to diſcuſſe the ſeuerall Councels, which he onely thinkes fit to name, and vtter by whole-ſale againſt vs, were a worke for a Volume apart.

But, if after the Tyrannicall impoſitions of his Siricius and Innocentius tooke place in the Church, he could name for euerie one of his prouinciall Synods, an hundred, it were all one to vs; wee are not the worſe, his cauſe no whit the better. This tradition, after that in an emulation of the Montaniſticall vaunt of Virginitie, it had gotten head in the Church, ran like fire in a trayne; Thoſe prouinces that held correſpondence at Rome, according to the charge of Ad ſimilitudinem ſedis Apoſtolicae, eos cuncta obſeruare conſtituat.

How thoſe men were Biſhops, and yet ſine ordinibus, is a riddle which (I confeſſe) I cannot aread.

                  YEt the man hauing vnmercifully cruſht me in pieces with this emptie bladder of windy and worthleſſe authoritie, crowes ouer me, thus, in concluſion, And truely to mee hee ſeemeth not to bee more mad, then blind; for otherwiſe he would neuer haue proclaymed this freedome of ſeuen hundred yeeres, ſeeing the very forme of words vſed by his own ſacred Councel, doth ſo ſtrongly withſtand his fond collection; For there it is decreed, Qui ſunt in ſacris, &amp;c. Wee will that the marriages of ſuch as bee in holy Orders, from this time forward bee firme and valid; For in caſe this freedome had beene common before: why did they ſay, Deinceps, from this time forward? Thus hee. Wherein I would his Superiors did but ſee how kindly

he buffets himſelfe. For if this bee the force of Deinceps, or A modò,
                  From this time forward. I thus argue againſt him; Hee hath pleaded before, that neither this nor any other Church euer allowed or euer practiſed the celebration of marriage after Ordination; Now, if hee turne to the ſixth Canon of this Councell of Conſtantinople, hee ſhall find Decernimus▪ vt nulli deinceps hypodiacono, &amp;c. Wee decree that from hence-forward no Sub-Deacon, Deacon, or Prieſt may marry after his Ordination; Therefore by the force of his inference before this time (for almoſt ſeuen hundred yeeres) this was commonly practiſed. And now to anſwer my Refuters Deinceps: If his wit had beene any way matchable with his malice, he might haue ſeene that this Deinceps had relation to the Romane Church, not to the Greeke; For, (if he know not) this Synod meant to preſcribe Laws to his Miſtreſſe, and to correct that their iniurious Tradition of reſtraynt, and to inlarge

this libertie through all the Territories of the Vniuerſall Church; For this purpoſe is the, Deinceps, of the Conſtantinopolitan Fathers, who well knew, how much it needed in the Weſterne Church, which had inthralled their Clergie in the bondage or that vnlawfull prohibition. So as the Refuter, whiles hee playes vpon my want of Logicke, in not deſcrying the dangerous neceſſitie of this inference vpon mee, plainely bewrayes his owne want of braines, in not deſcrying the Folly of his obiection;Refut. p. 236.
                   and where he tells me (like a dull Ieſter) That all the Walls and Windows, from the Hall to the Kitchin, may mourne to ſee an Vniuerſitie-man haue ſo little wit, I muſt tell him that all the Dores of Doway may leape off their hindges, to ſee their Champion ſo childiſhly abſurd.

                  Now then to anſwer his idle Epilogue; If it appeare that his owne Pope and Canoniſt, and the receyued Hiſtories of the Church, and the examples of ſeuerall nations and

perſons acknowledge this ancient libertie both in the Eaſterne and (ſome) Weſterne Churches de facto; And Moſes and the Prophets, Christ and his Apoſtles, the ancient Councels, with this ſixt of Conſtantinople, approue it de iure; it followes that the neceſſarie impoſition of profeſſed continencie, is but a part of that ſowre milke wherewith the Shee-Wolfe of the Seuen-hils feedes the faction of her Romuliſts and Rhemiſts, and none of that wholeſome ſuſtenance which God and his purer Church haue prouided for their Children.

Thoſe Churches that were not parties to the faction of Rome, could not but be much moued with ſo peremptorie a decree of a famous Councell,

reducing them, in this point, to the exactneſſe of Apoſtolique inſtitution, and profeſſing to rectifie that Roman deuiation; No maruell therefore, if not long after, there inſued a colliſion of oppoſite parts, and much ſcuffling betwixt the abettors of Antichriſtian ſeruitude,Refut. p. 241.

Boniface either neuer durſt, or at leaſt neuer did vrge theſe Rules to his Germans. So, I hope, his mouth is ſtopt for my forged Teſtimony of his Gregorie, which could not in his conceit be other, becauſe hee neuer ſaw it peepe forth before this in other mens books.

                   This charge of GREGORY (I ſaid) was according to that rule of Clerks, cited from ISIDORE, and renewed in the Councel of Mentz; but by our iuggling Aduerſaries clipped in the recitall: Here the man cryes out, as before, of forgerie, ſo now of ignorance, telling his Readers, that I haue only taken this vpon truſt from anothers note-booke. Reader, by this iudge of the ſpirit of my Detractor. It is true; Iſidore wrote no Booke of this title: But in the ſecond Booke of his Eccleſiaſticall Offices, he makes the title of his ſecond Chapter, De Regulis Clericorum; Of the Rules of Clerks. From this Chapter, I cite a confeſſed paſſage, and am thus cenſured; whereas the Councell of Mentz cites it by this very ſtile, Sicut in Regulâ Clericorum dictum eſt; As it is ſaid in the Rule of Clerks. Is it ſimplicitie that he knowes not this title of Iſidore?
                  
or maliciouſneſſe, that hee conceales it? One of them is vnauoidable. It is cleere then, to his ſhame (if hee haue any) that the teſtimonie is aright cited; and is it leſſe cleere that it is maymed, and cut off by the hammes in their Moguntine Councell? Compare the places,Cont. Mogunt. 1.
                   the fraud ſhall be manifeſt. That Councell in the tenth Chapter profeſſes to tranſcribe (verbatim) the words of Iſidore in the fore-cited Tract; and where Iſidore ſaith, Caſtimoniam inuiolati 2corporis perpetuò conſeruare ſtudcant, aut certè vnius matrimony vinculo foederentur; Let them liue chaste, or marry but one. Their good Clerks haue vtterly left out the latter clauſe, and make Iſidore charge his Clerks with perpetuall continency; Let them liue chaſte. He that denyes this, let him deny that there is a Sunne in the heauen, or light in that Sunne; what need I ſay more? Let the Books ſpeake.
               Here my Refuter doth ſo ſhuffle &amp; cut, that any man may ſee hee ſpeaks

againſt his owne heart; for (to omit his ſtrayned miſſe-interpretation of Iſidore, ſince wee now contend not of the ſenſe, but of the citation) how poorely doth hee ſalue vp the credit of his Moguntine Fathers, whiles he ſaith,Refut. p. 246, &amp; 249.
                   ISIDORE ſpake in generall, the Fathers in that Councell more ſtrictly; when he that hath but one halfe of an eye may ſee, that both ſpeake in one latitude of the ſame perſons? Thoſe Fathers giuing the ſame title to that Chapter, and profeſſing to follow the Letters and Syllables of Iſidore; both name onely Clericos in that rule without diſtinction. Away then with this graceleſſe facing of wilfull frauds in your faithleſſe Secretaries, which haue alſo fetcht two Canons out of Carthage to Wormes; and learne to bee aſhamed of your groſſe falſifications, and iniurious expurgations; elſe doubtleſſe the World will be aſhamed of you.

                   not as the foundation of my cauſe; my Refuter ſpends but one and thirtie whole Pages vpon him: How elſe ſhould he haue made a Volume? In all this what ſayes hee? Little in many words; and the ſame words thrice ouer for fayling.
               And firſt, hee wonders at my extreme prodigalitie of credit, and fearedneſſe of conſcience, in citing an Epiſtle ſo conuicted by Bellarmine, Baronius, Eckius, Faber, Fitz-Simons the Ieſuite, and others. Why doth he not wonder that the Moone will keepe her pace in the skie, whiles ſo many Dogs barke at her below? When theſe Proctors of Rome haue ſaid their worſt, there is more true authoritie in the very face of this Letter, and better Arguments in the body of it, then in an hundred Decretal Epiſtles which he adoreth.

Let the World wonder rather at his ſhameleſneſſe, who relating the occaſion of this fable (as he termes it) faynes it to be only a Lutheran fiction to couer their inceſtuous marriages, whereas their owne Cardinall Aeneas Syluius, almoſt two hundred yeeres agoe, mentions it, and reports the argument of it; whereas it is yet extant (as Illyricus) in the Libraries of Germany; whereas Hedio found an ancient Copie of it in Holland; and our Iohn Bale; Archbiſhop Parker, B. Iewell, Io. Foxe, had a Copie of it, remarkeable for reuerend Antiquitie, in aged Parchment here in England; which, I hope to haue the meanes to produce. Whereas, laſtly, the very ſtile importeth age. As well may hee queſtion all the Records of their Vatican, all report of Hiſtories, all Hiſtories of Times: He that would doubt whether ſuch an Epiſtle were written, may as well doubt whether Pope Zachary wrote to B. Boniface in Germany a direction when to eate Bacon:

may doubt whether Paul the fift wrote to his Engliſh Catholikes to perſwade them not to ſweare they would be good Subiects; may doubt whether Spider-catcher corner-creeper C.E. Pſeudo-Catholike Prieſt, wrote a ſcurrilous Letter of aboue two quire of Paper, in a twelue-yeers-anſwer to three leaues of I.H. It is not more ſure that there is a Rome, or that Gregory and Nicholas ſate there, then that ſuch an Epiſtle was written thither aboue ſeuen hundred yeeres agoe. It was extant of old, before euer thoſe Lutheran quarrels were hatched. Let him therefore goe fiſh for Frogs in the Pond of his Gregory, whiles hee deriues thence the vaine pleas of improbabilitie. If there were differences in relating the circumſtances of that ſtorie (as, I know none) muſt it needs thereupon bee falſe? Which of their Hiſtories is not lyable to varietie of report? To begin with the firſt: The ſucceſſion of Linus, and Cletus, and Clemens, is diuerſly

reported; is there no truth in it? To end with the laſt: The Title of Paul the Fift to the Chane of Peter in the lawfulneſſe of his Election, is diuerſly reported; hath he therefore no true clayme to his Seate? But who euer placed Gregories Pond in Sicilie? This is one of the fittens of his Fitz-Simons.

much more the witneſſe was theirs. There muſt needes bee much cauſe, when hee that ſo humbly ouer-titles the perſon, reſiſts the Doctrine ſo vehemently. But the truth is, that the Epiſtle ſtiles Pope Nicolas no otherwiſe in the ſuperſcription, then Sanctae Romanae Eccleſiae prouiſorem: Ouer-ſeer of the holy Romane Church. And in the bodie of the letter, Summae ſedis Pontificem; Biſhop of the chiefe See; to whome the examination of the common affaires of the Church doth appertaine; which is farre other, then in the now Romane ſenſe, the Supreme Head of the Church. Secondly, hee tels vs that this Epiſtle both grants and allowes a Vow of Continencie;He excepts none, but a profeſſor of Continence. 
                  Nullum excipit niſi profeſſorem continentiae; wherein we are no other then friends; we yeeld no leſſe; where there is good euidence of the gift and calling of God. But whiles our Voluſian grants the profeſſor of Continency bound, and pleads the Clergie to bee free, how plainly doth hee ſhew vs that there

was no ſuch Vow, then required of, no ſuch made by the Clergie.

Iwis, ſayes my Refuter, your Vdalricke is not the man you take him for; For thus hee there writes to the Pope; Wherefore, O reuerend Father, it ſhall be your part to cauſe and ouer-ſee, that whoſoeuer either with hand or mouth hath made a Vow of Continencie (as all Clergie men in holy Orders haue) and afterwards would forſake the ſame, ſhould bee either compelled to keepe his Vow, or elſe by lawfull authoritie

ſhould be depoſed from his Order. So he. But we are not ſo light of beliefe to loſe a friēd thus eaſily. Know then, Reader, that the (As all Clergie men in holy Orders haue.) Parentheſis (which is the harſheſt piece of this clauſe) is foyſted into the Text, and forged by this Cauiller; the quite contrarie whereof is affirmed in the former Period of our Vldaricke, where thus hee writes: Non parùm quippe, &amp;c. From this holy diſcretion thou haſt not a little ſwerued, when as thou wouldſt haue thoſe Clergie-men, whom thou oughteſt only to aduiſe to Abſtinence from Marriage, compelled vnto it by a certaine imperious violence; For is not this iustly in the iudgement of all wiſe men to be accounted violence, when as againſt the Euangelicall Inſtitution, and the charge of the Holy Ghoſt, any man is conſtrayned to the execution of priuate Decrees? The Lord in the old Law appointed Marriage to his Prieſt which hee is neuer read afterwards to haue forbidden; So he. Let my Refuter then reconcile his falſe Parentheſis,

with the true Text, (which hee can neuer doe, ſince it directly croſſeth the whole ſcope of Huldericks Epiſtle) and then hee ſhall ſee vs eaſily reconcile Huldericks propoſition with ours.
               But, not ſo long to delay my Readers ſatisfaction; the Truth is; The Authour pleades for an indifferent immunitie of Clergie men from the neceſſitie of this Vow, elſe the Epiſtle were contradictorie to it ſelfe: for if hee ſuppoſe that all the Clergie had vowed, and all that had vowed ſhould bee compelled to keepe their Vow, how could he plead that the Clergie ſhould not be compelled to Continence? The drift of Vldericke or Voluſian, then, is, that it may be equally lawfull, equally free for Prieſts either to vow, or not to vow Continencie; which granted, if any one hauing libertie not to haue vowed, or obſerued it, ſhall notwithſtanding prefixe this courſe to himſelfe in the Lord,
                  Praefixit hoc ſibi in Domino, ibid. out of a long-ſettled experience and aſſurance

of this calling and gift of God, and now, when hee hath thus ingaged himſelfe to the expectation of the Church, voluerit apoſtare, ſhall be froward wantonly to abandon this Vow, willingly neglecting all good meanes for the continued obſeruation thereof, ſuch a one ſhall bee lyable either to compulſion, or depoſition; As now, if any one of ours ſhould in the midſt of freedome bind himſelfe by a voluntary Vow, it were pittie and ſhame that hee ſhould play faſt and looſe at pleaſure with impunitie.
               What Wooll then is here worthy of this crie? Or wherein hath our Authour offended vs? whiles wee neither make this Vow, nor can therefore euer breake it, nor euer allowed the breakers of ſo▪ made Vowes, guiltleſſe?

                   And is it poſſible that any man ſhould riſe vp after ſo many hundred yeeres, to Canonize Saint Hildebrand, euen in that for which h
                     •
                   condemned himſelfe? My Reader muſt know the man a little from the witneſſe of his owne Conclaue,

his Cardinall Benno, Archprieſt of the Roman Church, then liuing: Others beſides, tell of his beginnings in wicked Necromancy, and murderous vnderminings, and tyrannicall ſwaying of the Keyes, ere he had them: Benno tells how he got them, how he vſed them gotten: Hee got them by fraud, mony, violence; vſed them with tyrannie. There was a knot, and a ſucceſſion of Necromancers in thoſe dayes. Gerberius, which was Sylueſter the ſecond, was the Maſter of the ſchole: His chiefe Schoilers in the blacke Arte, were Theophylactus (afterwards changed into Pope Benedict) and Laurentius, and Gratianus. Theſe were the Tutors of Hildebrands yonger times, of whom hee learned both Magike and Policy. It is a world to ſee what worke theſe Magicians made (like the ill ſpirits they rayſed) in Church and Common-wealth; oppoſing Emperors, ſetting vp what Popes they pleaſed, poyſoning whom they diſliked: At

laſt, it came to Hildebrands turne to take the Chaire: Ben

                  To which purpoſe he ſeparated firſt the Biſhops from the Cardinals auerſe from him: when he had done, he compelled them by terror and force to ſweare unto his part; which done, hee was elected in ſpight of the Canons, only by Lay perſons, by Souldiers; he expelled the Cardinals,

                     aſhly excommunicated the Emperor, of his owne head, without any Canonicall accuſation, without ſubſcription of any Cardinall; hyred a bloudy Villaine to murder the Emperour; conſulted with the Oracle of his breaden God, which, becauſe it anſwered not, hee cast it into the fire; hee exerciſed most horrible cruelties vpon many, hanging vp men at his pleaſure vnconuicted; in a word, quantis haereſibus mundum corruperit, &amp;c? ſaith Benno, in his concluſion, His hereſies, his periuries, can ſcarce be deſcribed by many Pens; Clamat tamen altiùs, &amp;c. But the Chriſtian bloud ſhed by his inſtigation and command (ſaith he) cryes yet lowder to God, yea, the

bloud of the Church, which the ſword of his tongue in a miſerable prodition hath ſhed, cryes out againſt him; for which things, the Church did most iustly depart from all communion with him. Thus Benno; who yet (to make amends)

A tricke that well beſeemed an Hellebrand, who ſet all the world on fire by his wicked impetuoſitie.

of our Engliſh Clergie with their DVNSTANS, about this time, are memorable. My Margin cites Henry of Huntingdon, affirming Anſelme to bee the firſt that forbad marriage: Betwixt theſe two, ſaith my Refuter, was an hundred yeeres difference. I grant it: But (had my words beene thus) if my Detector were not diſpoſed to ſeeke a knot in a Ruſh, hee had eaſily noted that in a generall ſuruay of all Ages, the phraſe (About that time) admits much latitude; and wil eaſily ſtretch without any ſtrayne to one whole Centurie of yeeres. Had the Quotation beene as he pleadeth, this anſwere were ſufficient. But my words need no ſuch reconciliation; I ſtand to the cenſure, and diſclaime the mercy of any Reader: For that citation of Anſelme hath plaine reference to the following words; Our Histories teſtifie how late, how repiningly our Clergie ſtooped vnder this yoke: it is for this that my Margin points to Henry Huntingdon, and

                  Fabian, reporting Anſelme the firſt man that prohibited theſe marriages. What contradiction now can his acuteneſſe detect in theſe two? The Engliſh Clergie had bickerings with their Dunſtans; and ſtooped late and repiningly to this yoke vnder Anſelme. See, Reader, and admire the equal Truth and Logique of a Catholique Prieſt, and iudge how well hee beſtoweth his Pages.

who himſelfe was; an Abbot; and therefore partiall to the Cloyſters; and who put him into this Commiſſion; Pope Iohn the thirteenth: a Monſter of men, yea, of Popes; one, who (as was articled againſt him in a generall Councell) had committed

And thirdly, what the ſtate of the Times were; wherein libertie was degenerate into ſtrange licentiouſneſſe; Euen change of Wiues (if wee may beleeue Hiſtories) was then no wonder; For the correcting whereof, the Reformers (according to the Philoſophers aduice) laboured towards the other extreme; as thoſe which to ſtraighten a ſticke, bow it as much the contrarie way: And laſtly,

how farre this act and indeuour extended: For Dunstan ſought not to thruſt marryed men out of the Clergie, but to thruſt Expulit malos Praesbyteros, introduxit pe

three Saints of theirs, and Anſelme: They by action, hee by Synodicall Decree perſecuted the Clergy; They bent their indeuours againſt Cathedrall Clerkes, hee againſt Prieſts; Their proiect was particular, his vniuerſall.

Prelates had perſwaded King Edgar to receiue, and in part to vrge vpon his marryed Prebendaries.

                  Dunſtan and Anſelme, I might ſafely ſay our Engliſh Clergie found the firſt machinations againſt their marriage, and at laſt ſtooped perforce to this yoke of conſtrayned continencie. Neyther doth my wit, or my Logique fayle mee in this collection. If theſe were the men that made the firſt oppoſition to the marriage of Clergie men in England, then it formerly obtayned here, without contradiction. The bare word of my Refuter, is a hote ſhot to batter this neceſſary illation;

and to aſſure the Reader that the forced Celibate of the Engliſh Clergie is of greater Antiquitie then theſe his Saints; To which he adds (in an ignorant begging of the queſtion) A thing ſo filthie, after a ſolemne vow to God, to take a Wife, as it neuer appeared without the brand of infamie. As if our Predeceſſors in the Engliſh Clergie had beene euer charged with a vow; As if the ſolemnitie of this vow had neuer had beginning? Chimericall fancies fit for a ſhorne head. 
                     D. Martins arg. is, Prieſts crownes ſignifie their vow; No other proofe can be brought worth talking

When as the ancient Saxon Pontificall makes not the leaſt mention of any ſuch profeſſion; yea, when Girardus (who was the ſecond Biſhop of Yorke after the conqueſt) writes flatly to Anſelme concerning his owne Canons,Antiquit. Britan. Def. of Pr. Marr. p. 282.
                   
                  Profeſsiones verò mihi penitus abnegant Canonici, &amp;c. My Canons (ſaith he) vtterly

deny to giue mee profeſsion of continencie, which without this profeſsion haue beene diſorderly aduanced to holy Orders; Cùm verò ad ordines aliquos inuito, durâ ceruice renituntur, ne in ordinando caſtitatem profiteantur; And when I doe inuite any to take Orders, they doe reſiſt me very ſtubbornely, that they will make no profeſsion of chaſtitie in their Ordination. Thus hee. Shewing vs playnely that the Clergie in thoſe times challenged no other then the libertie of their Predeceſſors. But well may he face vs downe in this more obſcure (though certaine) truth, when hee dares to ſay that Greece it ſelfe neuer tolerated this eſtate in their Clergie, till by bad life it fell to Schiſme, and from Schiſme to open Hereſie; whiles their owne Canon Law (beſides all Hiſtories) giue him the lye; and what Latinorum nomo vel veterium, vel recentiorum, inter Graecorum erreres, aut haereſes, aut ſchiſmata, hanc coniugalis vſus retentionem ſupputauit, non Hugo Eterianus, non Tho.

                   Monke of Malmesbury tell him, that the Clergie vrged this plea for themſelues, Ingens eſſe &amp; miſerabile

dedecus, vt nonus aduena veteres colonos migrare compellerit, &amp;c. That it was a great and miſerable ſhame, that theſe vpſtarts, the Monkes, ſhould thruſt out the ancient poſſeſſors of thoſe places; that this was neyther pleaſing to God, which had giuen them that long-continued habitation, nor yet to any good man, who might iuſtly feare the ſame hard meaſure which was offered to them: Thus they, whoſe plea and complaynt ſeemed ſo iuſt, that Alfgina the Queene, Prince Alfere, and others of the nobility ouer-threw many of thoſe new-founded monaſteries, and reinſtalled the Prieſts in their former right.
               His next proofe is from the Letters of Pope Gregorie,

This Beda in a generall ſpeculation ſpeakes his conceit of the voluntarie continencie which hee holds requiſite in the Prieſthood; ſayes nothing of the particular cuſtome of the Engliſh Clergie; rather in diuers paſſages inſinuating the contrarie.

I know, my Refuter wil plead the vniuerſalitie of this Canon, and will contend, that a Law generally made for all Chriſtians, is not without iniurie reſtrayned to Eccleſiaſtiques; But let my Reader wel conſider, both the Prologue and Epilogue

of that Synod, he ſhal ſee, that they who are required to keep theſe Lawes, are Conſacerdotes omnes; and that whoſoeuer ſhall violate them, Nouerit ſe ab omni officio Sacerdotali &amp; nostra ſocietate ſeparatum; muſt know himſelfe ſeparate from all ſacerdotall office and ſociety: ſo as it will neceſſarily follow, that this Law did (at leaſt) concerne the Clergy with others, though not apart; Neyther is there any other of thoſe Canons, which concernes not the Clergy only; except the firſt, concerning the obſeruation of Eaſter, which principally alſo belonged to them. Wherto it makes not a little,I forbeare the Saxon word, for lacke of their Characters. The Reader ſhall find them cited in Saxon by Mat. Parker. Def. of Pr. Mar.

Laſtly, my Aduerſarie cannot deny, that this Synode giues order for many accidentall matters, concerning the Clergie, for their fixed ſtation, for their maintenance, &amp;c. but except in this Canon, there is no one word of their ſtate of life; neyther is there in all thoſe Canons, one ſyllable of this pretended Celibate, as that, which the contrary receyued cuſtome of our Church would neuer haue indured; My Refuter da

If he thinke to inſinuate that his birth made him partiall; The Reader will eaſily conſider, that if ſuch Parentage had beene then accounted ſhamefull, the Hiſtorian would haue had the wit to haue ſuppreſſed it; And withall that he durſt not, writing in the times when this thing was ſo familiarly and vniuerſally knowne, haue offered ſuch a Propoſition to the light, out of a vaine

partialitie, to incurre the controllment of all eyes.

                   find him a Marchant, I finde him to haue beene Sheriffe of the Honourable Citie of London; A man whoſe credit would ſcorne to to bee poyſed with an hundred nameleſſe Fugitiues, paraſiticall pettie-chapmen of the late ſmall-wares of Rome. Neither can the name of a Citizen diſparage him to any wiſe iudge. How many haue our times yeelded of that ranke, whom both Academicall education, and experience and trauell, and ſtudie haue wrought to an eminent perfection in all Artes, eſpecially in Mathematickes, and Hiſtorie! Such was Fabian, whoſe fidelity (beſides his other worths) was neuer (that I find) taxed but by this inſolent Pen that hath learned to forbeare no man;

Hee was too old for vs to bribe, and too credible for C. E. to diſgrace. If he would haue lent Rome but this one lye, no man had beene more authenticall; now his truth makes him fabulous Fabian. That one fault hath marred our Archdeacon of Huntingdon alſo.
               
                  Ref. p. 348.
                  The Story which hee tels of the Cardinall of Crema the Popes Legate taken in bed (after his buſie indeuours, againſt the marryed Clergie) the ſame day with an Harlot, hath vndone his reputation. Why will C.E. ſtirre this ſinke? No man prouoked him: If hee did not long to blazon the ſhame of his friends, he had rather ſmothered this foule occurrence; but ſince hee will bee meddling, Res apertiſſima negari non potuit, celari non debuit, ſaith HVNTINGDON. The thing was moſt openly knowne, it could not bee denyed, it might not bee concealed. Yet now comes an Vpſtart-Nouice, and dares tell vs from Baronius, that this was a meere Fable; how publike and notorious

ſoeuer, Huntingdon makes it: with theſe men this rule is vniuerſal, whatſoeuer may tend to the diſhonour of the Church of Rome, is falſe and fabulous.
               Indeed, I remember what their Gloſſe ſaid of old, Diſt. 96. In ſcript. 
                  Clericus amplectens mulierem, praſumitur bene agere, ſi ergo Clericus amplectitur mulierem, interpratabuitur quòd cauſa benedicendi eam, hoc faciat: That is; A Clergie man imbracing a woman, must be preſumed to doe well; If therefore a Clerke take a woman by the middle, it must bee interpreted that hee doth it to giue her his bleſsing. 
                  So the Chronicle tels vs of Adelme, Abbot of Malmesbury, who when hee was ſtirred to the vice of the fleſh, had wont to deſpite the Deuill, and torment himſelfe with holding a fayre yong Virgin in his bed, ſo long as he might ſay ouer the whole Pſalter, 
                        Ʋid. Pask. Def. Polyd. ſuppreſſing the name, telleth the Hiſtory.
                   Perhaps, the good Legate was but beſtowing his ghoſtly bleſſing on ſo needfull a ſubiect, but that hee was found in bed with her, if C. E. were not as ſhameleſſe as that Cardinall, or his bed-fellow, he durſt not deny; For what impudencie is this, to caſt this relation only vpon H. Huntingdon, when ſo many vncontrollable Pens haue recorded it to the World? Men of their owne

ſtampe, for Religion, for Deuotion. Matthew Paris, Ranulfus Cestrenſis Roger Houeden, Polydore Virgill, Fabian, Matthaeus Weſtmonaſterienſis, otherwiſe called Florilegus; Dictus IOANNES, qui in Concilio, &amp;c. ſaith he; The ſaid IOHN which in the open Councell had grieuouſly condemned all the 
                  Viz. the married: ſo did the enemies of Marriage diſgracefully terme the marryed Clergy; and ſo are the words of the Legate to be vnderſtood, de latere meretricis; hee then railing againſt Marriage (not whoredome properly) was deprehended in whoredome. 
                  Concubinary Prieſts, was taken himſelfe in the ſame crime. Now let my Reader iudge, whether this Prieſts Truth, or that Cardinals honeſtie were greater.

               HIs third Ponderation is the ſame with the firſt; Euerie thing eekes. His Saint Dunſtan and Anſelme, Gregorie and Bede are againe layd in our diſh; wee cannot feed on theſe ouer-oft-ſod Coleworts. I am challenged here, to produce any Prieſt or Deacon that liued in Wedlocke before the times of Dunſtan; The man preſumes

vpon the ſuppreſſion of Records. For one, I name him hundreds. Who were they that Dunſtan and his fellow-Saints found ſeated in the Cathedrall Churches of this Land? whome did they eiect? Were they not marryed Prieſts? What did the eiected Clergie plead but ancient poſſeſſion? After that; in the Synode which Archbiſhop Ex Act. Concil. Wint. ſub. Lanfr. 
                  Lanfranck held at Winchester (which I wonder my Detectour would ouer-ſee: This neglect is not for nothing;) was it not decreed, that the Canons ſhould not haue Wiues, but that the Prieſts which dwelt in Townes and Villages, ſhould not bee compelled to put away their Wiues; though caution is put in for the future?
               What doth this imply, but that in thoſe ancient Times the Engliſh Clergie were inoffenſiuely married? To which adde that olde Record from an ancient Martyrologe of the Church of Canterbury:Martyrol. Cant. LANFRANCVS Archiepiſcopus reddidit Eccleſiae

Sancti ANDREae, &amp;c. LANFRANCK Archbiſhop hath reſtord to Saint ANDREWES Church; the Monaſterie of Saint MARIE with the Lands and Houſes which LIVINGVS Prieſt, and his Wife had in London, &amp;c. And before him, or Dustan either, in King Edmunds time, Fox. Act. &amp; Mon. Biſhop Oſulphus with Athelme and Vlrick, Laicks, thruſt out of the Monkes of Eueſham, and placed Canons (married Prieſts) in their roome.

               Now let my Refuter comfort himſelfe and his Catholikes, with the weake defence of Hereſie, and the ſtrong Bulwarkes of Romane Truth; who in the meane time muſt be put in minde, that he puts on me the burden which ſhould lye vpon his own ſhoulders; I haue produced Hiſtories which affirme peremptorily, that the Engliſh Clergie were

neuer forbidden to marrie vntil Anſelmes time; it is now his taske to diſprooue this aſſertion of theirs by equall authoritie to the contrarie, which till hee haue done, the day is ours.

                   is the difficultie of this grant in King Edwards Parliament. And is it poſſible the man ſhould not ſee the greater difficultie that was found in the inforcement of this glorious Celibate? How Alfere and the Nobles diſpoſſeſſed the Monkes of Dunſtan; iuſtly reſtoring the marryed Prieſts to their ancient right? How Lanfranck durſt not ſpeake it out; Anſelme did, but preuailed little: Let Vid. ſupra. Epiſt. ad Anſel. Neubr. l. 3. c. 5.

After whome Roger Archbiſhop of that See (as Neubrigenſis, records) thruſt out Pope Paſchalis writing to Anſelme, ſaith, that there was at this time ſo great a number of Prieſts Sonnes in England, that the greater part of the Clergie conſiſted of them. 
                  Anſelmes Monkes, and

ſtood for the libertie of Marriage: in ſomuch as in the ſucceſſion of Times, euen by Royall leaue alſo, Marriage of ſpirituall perſons yet continued; Neither could Anſelmes Succeſſours, Radulphus, Gulielmus de Turbine and the reſt, (notwithſtanding all their Canons and practices) preuaile againſt it. How plaine is that of the Chron. Saxon. Anno 1129.
                   
                  Saxon Chronicle? Thus did the Archbiſhop of Canterburie and the Biſhops, which were in England; And yet all theſe Decrees and biddings ſtood not; All held their Wiues by the Kings leaue, euen as they did. Inſomuch as Archbiſhop WILLIAM referr'd it to the King. The King decreed, that the Priests ſhould continue with their Wiues ſtill. Neither were any thing more eaſie then to giue ſtore of inſtances in this kinde. What need I giue more then that of Galfride B. of Ely,
                  Chron. Iornal. who was auouched before the Pope himſelf to haue maried a wife? which Habet excuſationem Euangelicam reſp. eſt ab Epiſ. Arelat. Alexandro Papae Euangelical excuſe (vxorem duxit) was made for his not appearing

at Rome with the reſt. Of Richard Biſhop of Chicheſter. ROBERT Biſhop of Lincolne marryed men, after theſe Decrees; yea, good Euidences of Ancient Charts are readie in our hands, to ſhew the vſe and legall allowance of theſe Marriages for no leſſe then two hundred yeeres after.
               As for thoſe idle wordes which his ſawcineſſe throwes after our reuerend Martyr, Archbiſhop Cranmer, (whome hee falſly affirmes to haue beene the firſt marryed Archbiſhop of this Kingdome,
                     Anno 1250. when as Archbiſhop Boniface ſate marryed in that See three hundred yeeres before him) and King Edwards Parliament, we anſwere them, with ſilence and ſcorne. Let leeſers haue leaue to talke.
               The approbation, and better expedience of ſingle life in capable ſubiects, we doe willingly ſubſcribe vnto; The lawfulneſſe, yea, neceſſitie of Marriage where the gift of Continence is denyed, our Sauiour, and

his choſen veſſel iuſtifie with vs. So as I ſtill conclude, He that made marriage, ſaith it is honorable, what care we for the diſhonor of thoſe that corrupt it?

                     Ref. 351.HIs laſt ponderation is leaden indeed; That from the bickerings of our Engliſh Clergy with their DVNSTANS, it will not follow that continencie was not ancient, but was repiningly, lately, vniuſtly impoſed.
                  
                     C. E. writes in the Margine, Maſter Halls looſe manner of diſputing. 
                  By this reaſon, he will proue there was neuer Theefe or Malefactor in our Countrey, before the time of King IAMES; ſince all Iudges haue yeerely bickerings with ſuch people. Thus he. But did euer ſuch looſe Beſome ſweep the preſſe before?
               Reader, vouchſafe yet once more to caſt thine eye vpon the cloſe of my Epiſtle; Doth my argument run thus wildly as hee makes it? The

Engliſh Clergie had bickerings with their DVNSTANS, therefore continencie was repiningly and vniuſtly impoſed? Canſt thou thinke I haue met with a ſober Aduerſarie? My words are; That our Hiſtories teach vs how late, how repiningly, how vniuſtly our Engliſh Clergie ſtooped vnder this yoke. And what can his ſophiſtrie make of this? Are ye not aſhamed (ye Superiors of Doway?) are ye not aſhamed of ſuch a Champion; fitter for a troupe of Pigmees to traile a reed in their bickerings with Cranes, then to be committed with any reaſonable or Scholler-like Antagoniſt? In the bickerings with his Dunſtans, the Patients pleaded preſcription (as we haue ſhewed out of Malmesbury) and taxed his Saints with nouelty; In my bickerings with him, I plead Antiquitie, Scripture, Reaſon; and taxe him moſt iuſtly with impudence, &amp; abſurditie. How well is that man, that is matcht but with an honeſt Aduerſary?

By them, let me be iudged: Thoſe haue made good to my Reader that C. E. hath accuſed much; and proued nothing, vanted much, and done nothing; rayled much, and hurt nothing, laboured much, and gayned nothing, talked much, and ſaid nothing.
                  
                     It is a large and bold word: but if any one clauſe of mine be vnproued if any one clauſe of mine be diſproued, any one exception againſt my defence proued iuſt, any one charge of his proued true, any one falſhood of mine detected, any one argument of mine refelled, any one argument or propoſitiō of his not refelled, Let me goe away conuicted with ſhame. But if I haue anſwered euery Challenge, vindicated euery I onely except that one ſlip of my pen, that I ſaid Gratian cited a ſentence out of Auſtin, which was indeed his owne. authority, iuſtified euery proofe, wiped away euery cauill, affirmed no propoſition vntruely, cenſured nothing vniuſtly; ſatisfied all his malicious obiections, and warranted euery ſentence of my poore Epiſtle: Let my Apologie liue and paſſe; and let my Refuter goe as he is, C. F. Cauillator Egregius: Let my cauſe be no more victorious then iuſt; and let honeſt Marriages euer hold vp their heads, in deſpite of Rome and Hell: With this Farewel, I leaue my Refuter, eyther to the acting of his vnbloudie executions of the Sonne of

God; or the plotting of the bloudy executiōs of the deputies of God, or (as it were his beſt) to the knocking of his Beads; But if he will needs be meddling with his pen, and wil haue me, after ſome Iubilies, to expect an anſwer to my ſixe-weekes labour, I ſhall in the meane time pray, that God would giue him the grace to giue way to the knowne Truth, and ſometimes to ſay true.
                  Yet to gratifie my Reader at the parting, I may not conceale from him, an ancient and worthie monument, which I had the fauour and happineſſe to ſee in the Inner Librarie of Corpus Chriſti Colledge in Cambridge; An excellent Treatiſe, written (amongſt ſeuenteene other) in a fayre ſet hand, by an Author of great learning and Antiquitie; Hee would needs (ſuppreſſe his name,Of Roane in France.

            An liceat Sacerdotibus inire Matrimonia.
            SCire volui quis primus inſtituit ne Sacerdotes Christiani inire deberent matrimonia. Deus an homo? Si enim Deus, eius certe ſententia &amp; tenenda &amp; obſeruanda eſt cum omni veneratione &amp; reuerentia. Si vero homo &amp; non Deus, de corde hominis &amp; non ex ore Dei talis egreſſa est traditio: Ideo

Non enim est hominis ſaluare vel perdere aliquem pro meritis, ſed Dei proprium vnius est, ſcilicet, quod Deus hoc instituerit, nec in veteri Testamento nec in Euangelio, ncc in Apostolorum Epistolis ſcriptum reperitur, in quibus quicquid Deus hominibus praecepit inſertum deſcribitur. Traditio ergo hominis est &amp; non Dei, non Apostolorum institutio. Quemadmodum

vero hoc donum gratiae minime percipiunt, qui cum intemperantia ſuae conſperſionis, tum etiam animi infirmitate per carnis deſideria diffluunt. Quod nullo modo facerent, ſi continentiae gratiam &amp; virtutem a Deo percepiſſent. Sentiunt anim &amp; ipſi alia

               grotis remedium. Neque enim quia incontinentia malum est ideo connubium,

vel quo incontinentes copulantur non est bonum. I mo vero non propter illud malum culpabile est bonum, ſed propter hoc bonum veniale eſt illud malum: quoniam id quod bonum habent nuptiae, &amp; quod bonae ſunt nuptiae, peccatum eſſe nunquam poteſt. Hoc autem tripartitum eſt, fides, proles, Sacramentum. In fide attenditur, ne praeter vinculum coniugale, cum altera vel cum altero concubatur. In prole, vt amanter ſuſcipiatur, benigne ſuſcipiatur, religioſe educetur. In Sacramento, vt coniugium non ſeparetur, &amp; demiſſus aut demiſſa ne cauſa prolis alteri coniugatur. Haec est tanquam regula nuptiarum, qua vel naturae decoratur foecunditas, vel incontinentiae regitur prauitas. Hanc autem regulam nuptiarum, &amp; hoc tripartitum bonum inſtituit aeterna veritas ordine decenti &amp; lege aeterna, contra quam quicquid fit, vel dicitur, vel concupiſcitur, peccatum est. Quod in libro contra Faustum Manichaeum Auguſtinus testatur, dicens, Peccatum eſt factum, vel dictum, vel concupitum contrae aeternam legem. Aeterna lex est diuina voluntas, ſiue ratio ordinem naturalem perturbari vetans, conſeruari iubens. Quicquid igitur ordinem naturalem perturbari iubet, conſeruari vetat, exercere nuptias &amp; earum tripartitum bonum, fidem, ſcilicet,

prolem &amp; Sacramentum eos habere prohibet, &amp; regulam illam aeternae veritatis qua naturae decoratur foecunditas, vel incontinentiae regitur prauitas, eos ſoluere praecipit, &amp;c. quibus naturalis ordo peragitur, abhomi
                  •
               ari iubet. Hoc inquam mandatum naturalem ordinem conſeruari vetat, perturbari iubet, &amp; ideo contra aeternam legem fit, et peccatum eſt: peccant enim qui mandatum tale instituunt, quo naturalis ordo deſtruitur. Nam etiam vt videtur, minime credunt quod de Sacerdotum filijs aſſumat Deus ad aedificandam ſupernam Ciuitatem, &amp; ad reſtaurandum Angelorum numerum. Si enim crederent, nunquam tale mandatum inſtituerent, quia ſcienter &amp; nimia temeritate id efficere conarētur, vt ſuperna Ciuitas nū
               quam proficiatur, &amp; Angelorum numerus nunquam reperaretur: ſi enim ſuperna Ciuitas de filijs etiam Sacerdotum perficienda eſt, &amp; ſi Angelorum numerus de ipſis etiam reperandus est, qui hoc efficere conatur vt nulli ſint, quantum in ipſo eſt, &amp; ſupernam ciuitatem deſtruit, &amp; Angelorum numerus ne perficiatur efficit. Quo quod peruerſius poteſt fieri? Hoc enim fit contra voluntatem &amp; praedeſtinationem illius, qui quae futura ſint fecit. Fecit enim praedestinatione quae futura ſunt in opere.

Quae cum ita ſint, neceſſe eſt vt ſicut Laici, ita etiam Sacerdotes de quibus homines creantur, ad ipſos creandos Ministerium exhibeant diuinae voluntati &amp; Praeordinationi.

            Which, for my Countrimens ſake I haue thus Engliſhed.
            I Would faine know who it was that firſt ordayned, that Chriſtian Prieſts might not marry, GOD, or Man? For, if it were GOD, ſurely, his determination is to be held and obſerued with all veneration and reuerence; But, if it were Man, and not GOD; and this Tradition came out of the heart of Man, not out of the Mouth of GOD, then neither is ſaluation got by it, if it be obſerued; nor loſt, if it bee not obſerued: For it doth not belong to Man either to ſaue or deſtroy any man for his merits, but it is proper only vnto GOD. That GOD hath ordayned this, it is neither found written in the Old Teſtament, nor in the Goſpell, nor in the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles, in all which is ſet downe whatſoeuer GOD hath inioyned vnto men. It is therefore a Tradition of Man, and not an inſtitution of GOD, nor of his Apoſtles: As the Apoſtle

inſtituted (rather) that a Biſhop ſhould bee the Husband of one Wife; which he would neuer haue appointed, if it had beene adulterie for a biſhop to haue at once a Wife, and a Church, as it were two Wiues, like as ſome affirme: Now, that which hath not authoritie from the holy Scriptures, is with the ſame facilitie contemned, that it is ſpoken: For, the holy Church is not the Wife, not the Spouſe of the Prieſt, but of Chriſt, as Saint Iohn ſaith, Hee that hath the Bride, hee is the Bridegroome. Of this Bridegroome, I ſay, is the Church the Spouſe; and yet it is lawfull euen for this Spouſe in part, to marry, by Apoſtolique Tradition; For the Apoſtle ſpeaks thus to the Corinthians, Becauſe of fornications, let euery man haue his owne wife. And I would that all men were as I am, but euery man hath his proper gift of GOD, one thus, another otherwiſe. For, all men haue not one gift, namely, of Virginitie, and Continency: But ſome are Virgins, and contayne; others contayne not; to whom he granteth marriage, leſt Satan tempt them through their incontinency, and they ſhould miſcarry in the ruine of their vncleanneſſe. So alſo of Prieſts, ſome are continent, others are

incontinent; and thoſe which are continent, haue receiued the gift of their continence from GOD, without whoſe Gift and Grace, they cannot be continent. But thoſe which are incontinent, haue not receiued this gift of grace, but, whether by the intemperance of their humour, or the weakneſſe of their mind run out into fleſhly deſires; which they would in no wiſe doe, if they had receiued from GOD the Grace and Vertue of Continence. For they alſo which are deliuered by the grace of GOD from the body of this death, feele another Law in their members rebelling againſt the Law of their minde, and captiuating them to the Law of ſinne, and compelling them to doe that which they would not. This Law therefore, holding them captiue, and this Concupiſcence of the fleſh prouoking them, they are com
                  •
               lled either to fornicate, or marry: whereof whether is the better, wee are taught by the authoritie of the Apoſtle, who tels vs it is better to marry then to burne. Surely, that which is the better, is to be choſen and held; now it is better to marry, becauſe it is worſe to burne; and becauſe it is better to marry then to burne, it is conuenient for thoſe which

contayne not, to marry, not to burne. For marriage is good, as Augustine ſpeaks in his Booke (ſuper Geneſin ad Literam) in it is commended the good of nature, whereby the prauitie of incontinence is ruled, and the fruitfulnes of Nature graced; For the weakneſſe of either Sexe declining towards the ruine of filthineſſe, is well relieued by the honeſty of marriage, ſo as the ſame thing, which may bee the office of the ſound, is alſo the remedie vnto the ſick: Neither yet, becauſe Incontinence is euill, is therefore Marriage (euen that wherewith the Incontinent are ioyned) to be reputed not good; yea rather not for that euill, is the good faultie, but for this good, is that euill pardonable, ſince that good which marriage hath, yea which marriage is, can neuer bee ſinne. Now, this good is three-fold, the Fidelitie, th
                  •
                
               
                  •
               ruit, the Sacrament of that eſtate; I
                  •
                the Fidelitie, is regarded: That beſides this bond of Marriage, there bee not carnall ſocietie with any other. In the Fruit of it, That it be louingly rayſed and religiouſly bred. In the Sacrament of it, That the marriage be not ſeparated, and that the diſmiſſed partie of either Sexe, bee not ioyned to any other, no not for iſſues ſake. This is

as it were the Rule of Marriage, whereby the fruitfulneſſe of Nature is graced, or the prauitie of Incontinence ruled. And this Rule of Marriage, and this three-fold good, the eternal Truth hath appointed in the order of his Decree, and that eternall Law of his, againſt which whatſoeuer is done, ſpoken, or willed, is ſinne; which Augustine in his Booke againſt Faustus the Manichee witneſſeth, ſaying, Sinne is either Deed, Word, or Deſire againſt the Law Eternal. This Eternall Law is the diuine Will or Decree, forbidding the diſturbance, and commanding the preſeruation of due naturall order; whatſoeuer therefore commands naturall Order to be diſturbed, forbids it to be conſerued, prohibits men to vſe Marriage, and to attaine to the threefold good thereof, Fidelitie, Iſſue, Sacrament; and commands them to breake that Rule of Eternall Truth, whereby the fruitfulneſſe of Nature is graced, or the prauitie of Incontinency ruled, commands men to abhorre thoſe things whereby naturall Order is held and maintayned. This Commandement, I ſay, forbids naturall Order to be obſerued, commands it to be diſturbed, and therefore is againſt the Law of GOD, and by conſequence, is ſinne:

For, they ſinne that ordayne ſuch a command by which naturall Order is deſtroyed.
            Theſe men doe not (it ſeemes) beleeue, that of the children of Prieſts, GOD takes for the building of his Citie aboue, and for the reſtoring of the number of Angels: For, if they did beleeue it, they would neuer ordayne ſuch a Mandate, becauſe they ſhould wittingly and ouer-raſhly goe about to effect, that the ſupernall City ſhould neuer be perfited, and the number of Angels neuer repayred. For if the ſupernall City be to be perfited euen of the ſons of Prieſts, and if the number of Angels be of them to be repayred, thoſe that indeuour to procure that they ſhould not be, doe (what in them lyes) deſtroy the ſupernall City, and labour that the number of Angels may not be perfited; Then which, what can be more peruerſely done? For this is done againſt the wil and predeſtination of him which hath done thoſe things, which ſhall be; for hee hath done in his predeſtination thoſe things which ſhall bee in effect; whoſoeuer therefore goes about to procure that GOD may not in effect doe thoſe things, which he hath done in his predeſtination, goes about to make

void the very predeſtination of GOD. If then GOD haue already in his Predeſtination decreed, that the ſons of Prieſts ſhall once bee in effect, hee that goes about to procure that they may not bee in effect, indeuours to deſtroy the worke of GOD, becauſe he hath already done it in predeſtination; and ſo ſtriues to ouerthrow GODS predeſtination, and to gainſtand that Wil of GOD which is Eternall: For GOD would from Eternitie, and before all Worlds, create all men in the World, in that certayne Order wherein he pre-conceiued, and predeſtinated, to create them; Hee doth nothing diſorderly, Hee createth nothing in the World which Hee hath not fore-ordayned, by diſpoſing it in the Predeſtination of His minde that went before all Worlds. Whatſoeuer therefore is by Him created in this world, doth neceſſ
                  •
               rily follow the Predeſtination of His minde prediſpoſing, and preordayning all things; becauſe it is impoſſible that ſhould not be done, which GOD from Eternitie hath willed and fore-ordayned to bee done; It is therefore neceſſary that all men ſhould bee created in that very Order, wherein He willed, and from Eternitie fore-ordayned; Or elſe, all men are not

created as GOD would haue them, nor as he fore-ordayned them; But becauſe this is inconuenient, it muſt needs bee that they are created as He willed from Eternitie, and fore-thought, and fore-ordayned; becauſe Hee hath done all things that He would, and neuer did any thing which Hee willed not from euerlaſting, and hath fore-conceiued in His certayne and vnchangeable Decree. For neither can his Will bee fruſtrated, nor his fore-thought deceiued, nor His fore-ordinations altered: Which, ſince it is ſo; need muſt it be, that as Laicks, ſo Prieſts alſo, of whom men are created, ſhould yeeld their ſeruice to the diuine Will and Preordination to the creating of them. For Parents are not the Authors of the Creation of their Children, but the ſeruants; who if they ſhould not yeeld their ſeruice, they ſhould (if it w
                  •
               re poſſible) make void the fore-thought of GOD, and reſiſt his Ordination; which if they ſhould wittingly do, they ſhould offend the more, if ignorantly, the leſſe; not only againſt GOD the Father, but alſo againſt the Heauenly Ieruſalem, the Mother of all Saints, becauſe (what in them were) they ſhould not ſuffer thoſe to be created of whom it is to bee builded, and

thoſe things to bee prepared, whereby that Celeſtiall Countrey is beſtowed. But from this offence their impotence frees them, becauſe they cannot reſiſt the Will of GOD, and croſſe his Preordination. For the Will and Predeſtination of GOD is that eternall Law, in which the courſe of al things is decreed, and the patterne wherein the forme of all Ages is ſet forth, which can by no meanes be defaced; Not to yeeld our ſeruice then hereunto, is euill, becauſe to yeeld it, is good, and eſpecially if it bee done with a good intent; which is then done, when as Parents meete together in a deſire of propagation of iſſue, not in an appetite of exerciſing their luſt. Of propagation, I ſay, that both the preſent Church may be multiplyed, and the Celeſtiall City built, and the number of the Elect made vp, none of which could be done▪ without ſuch coniugall meeting. For if the firſt Parents of the Saints had continued all either Continent, or Virgins, no Saint had beene borne of them in the World, none of them had beene crowned with glory and honour in Heauen, none of them aſcribed into the number of Angels. But ſince it is an ineſtimable good, that Saints are borne in the World, that

they are crowned with glory and honor in heauen, and that they are aſcribed into the number of Angels: thereupon the fruitfulneſſe of Parents is more bleſſed, and their meeting holyer. So then it is better for them to haue begotten ſuch Children, then not to haue begotten them, and to haue brought forth ſuch fruit of marriage, then to haue beene continent, or Virgins, without fruit. Although it is good for ſome to be continent, or Virgins, namely, for them whom GOD eternally willed and pre-ordayned to be ſo created in the world, that they ſhould remaine either in Continence, or Virginitie: For as hee hath eternally willed and fore-ordained that ſome ſhould be ſo created in the world, as that they ſhould yeeld the fruit of Marriage, and beget Children, ſo alſo hath he willed, and from eternitie fore-ordayned, ſome to bee ſo created, that they ſhould continue in Continency or Virginitie: And as thoſe other yeeld their ſeruice to the Will and Preordination of GOD, in the creation of children, ſo theſe alſo ſerue the Will and Preordination of GOD in conſeruing their Continence, and Virginitie; and hereupon is both the fruitfulneſſe of the one, and the Virginitie of the other

good, and laudable; which if it did not yeeld ſeruice to the Will and Preordination of GOD, would be neither good nor laudable: For whatſoeuer is contrary to the Will and Preordination of GOD, is neither good, nor laudable. If therefore GOD willed and predeſtinated ſome to bee Virgins, others to yeeld the fruit of Marriage (for if all were Virgins, no Saint that now is, or ſhall be borne, ſhould either be now or hereafter borne in the World, neither ſhould thoſe Virgins bee at all, becauſe they ſhould not be born; for of the fruitfulnes of the one ariſes the others Virginitie) therefore is fruitfulneſſe a great Good, from which holy Virginity hath proceeded: Now that there ſhould bee ſome Virgins, and others that ſhould beare the fruits of Marriage, the Word which GOD ſoweth in their hearts, teacheth vs. For in the hearts 
                  〈◊〉
                ſome hee ſoweth the Word of good fruitfulneſſe, yeelding the increaſe of Marriage, and in the hearts of others hee ſowes the Word of Virginitie; Thoſe then in whom hee ſowes the Word of Virginitie, they deſire to keepe Virginitie, but thoſe in whom hee ſowes the Word of Marriage, they deſire to yeeld the fruit of Marriage.

               Nam in totum quae ſunt humani iuris, quemadmodum in morbis remedia, &amp;c.FOr thoſe things which are altogether of humane conſtitution, muſt (like to remedies in diſeaſes) be attempered to the preſent eſtate of matters, and times. Thoſe things which were once religiouſly inſtituted, afterwards according to occaſion, and the changed qualitie of manners and

times, may bee with more Religion and Pietie abrogated; which yet is not to be done by the temeritie of the people, but by the authoritie of Gouernours; that tumult may bee auoyded; and that the publike cuſtome may be ſo altred, that cōcord may not be broken: the very ſame is perhaps to be thought concerning the Marriage of Priests of old, as there was great paucitie of Priests, ſo great Pietie alſo; They, that they might more freely attend thoſe holy Seruices, made themſelues chaste of their owne accord. And ſo much were thoſe Ancients affected to Chaſtitie, that they would hardly permit Marriage vnto that Chriſtian, whom his Baptiſme found ſingle, but a ſecond Marriage yet more hardly: And now that which ſeemed plauſible in Biſhops and Prieſts, was tranſlated to Deacons, and at laſt to Sub-deacons: which voluntarily receiued cuſtome was confirmed by the authoritie of Popes. In the meane-time▪ the number of Prieſts increaſed, and their Pietie decreaſed; How many

ſwarmes of Prieſts are maintayned in Monaſteries and Colledges?
                  Inter bos quanta raritas corum qui caſtè viuunt?

                and amongst them how few are there that liue chaſtly? I ſpeake of them which doe publikely keep Concubines in their houſes, inſtead of their Wiues. I doe not now meddle with the myſteries of their more ſecret lusts; I only ſpeake of thoſe things which are most notoriouſly knowne to the World: And yet, when we know theſe things, how eaſie are we to admit men into holy Orders, and how difficult in releaſing this conſtitution of ſingle life? when as contrarily S. PAVL teaches that hands muſt not bee raſhly layd vpon any; and more then once hath preſcribed 2what manner of men Priests and Deacons ought to bee, but of their ſingle life, neither Christ, nor his Apostles haue euer giuen any Law in the holy Scriptures. Long ſince hath the Church abrogated the nightly Vigils at the Tombes of Martyrs, which yet had beene receiued by the publike cuſtome of Christians, and that for diuers Ages; Thoſe Fasts, which were

wont to continue till the euening, it hath transferred to noone; and many other things hath it changed according to the occaſions ariſing:Cur hic humanam conſtitutionem vrgemus tam obſtinatè, praſertim cum tot cauſae ſuadeant mutationem? Primùm enim magna pars Sacerdotum viuit cum mala famâ; parumque requieta conſcientia tractat illa ſacroſancta myſteria, &amp;c. And why then doe wee ſo obstinatley vrge this humane constitution, eſpecially when ſo many cauſes perſwade vs to an alteration? For firſt a great part of our Priests liues with an ill name; and with an vnquiet conſcience handleth thoſe holy Mysteries; And then the fruit of their labours (for the most part) is vtterly lost, becauſe their doctrine is contemned of their people by reaſon of their ſhamefull life. Wheras, if Marriage might bee yeelded to thoſe which doe not contayne, both they would liue more quietly, and ſhould preach Gods Word to the people with authoritie, and might honeſtly bring vp their children, neither ſhould the one of them bee a mutuall ſhame to other, &amp;c.

of Soules. In the Place where I now liue (which my Libeller vpbraids me with) I receiue onely a free and liberall Annuitie from my Right Honorable Patron, the Lord Denny; vpon whoſe onely charges alſo my Aſſiſtent in theſe holy Labours hath been euer both prouided and maintayned; A truth which the Towne and Country can witneſſe with me: How could I therefore euer make here any ſuch agreement, how could that agreement offend, how could that offence be reproued? Many incouragements haue I had from my gracious Maſter, neuer yet any rebukes.
            For my eſtate (bleſſed bee GOD and the King) it is ſuch as affoords me no cauſe of complaint, much of thankfulneſſe; yet more tranſcending my merits, then the exigence of my charge: And is this Fellowes eye euill, becauſe my Maſters is good?

                of my Libeller are much alike; his

ſummes are as falſe as himſelfe. For my Sheepe and Beaſts, they might ſoone haue beene counted: I was neuer the Maſter of one Sheepe in all my life; they are Flocks of another nature, whereto I haue deuoted my thoughts: As for Beaſts, if this good piece had beene euer mine, I ſhould perhaps haue had foure; whereas now (ſince the World muſt needs know my ſtore) I haue but three. Iudge now, Reader, whether thou findeſt in the whole Clergie of this Kingdome, yea, in thine owne skin, a man to whom a Libell of this nature may with leſſe colour, yea poſſibilitie of truth bee applyed▪ Is not this then a worthy ſcrap of wit and honeſtie for ſome graue Benchers to ſtriue for Copies of for ſome Gentlemen that ſhould bee not vnwiſe, not irreligious▪ to make themſelues merry with

In the meane time I cannot but bee ſorry to ſee, that ſome Profeſſors of Religion, ſhould ſo lightly bee won to the beliefe of idle ſlanders againſt thoſe, which are readie both with Hand and Tongue to maintayne the cauſes of GOD, and ſincerely deſirous to liue that Goſpell which they preach. If there be any one of them whoſe good-name is Libell-proofe, let him make ſport at my wrong; but if the greateſt innocence and holineſſe of Earth, or Heauen, be no protection againſt miſ-report, let him not without indignation intertayne thoſe vniuſt reproches of another, which may, perhaps, ere to morrow, be his owne: Had this Libeller written Him, or Me, Traytor, or Murderer, or whateuer other Malefactor, I know no defence but Head and Shoulders, and the Conſcience of innocence: Neither can I promiſe my ſelfe ſecuritie, that hereafter the worſt crimes ſhall not bee laid vpon mee; But, farre bee it from honeſt Eares and Eyes to incourage

villany. For mee, my heart can accuſe it ſelfe of many ſinnes before my GOD, but for Couetouſneſſe, I euer deteſted it as a moſt ſordid and vn-ſchollerlike vice, and ſuch, as if I could thinke it lurked any where within me, I ſhould hate my ſelfe. If then ſome malicious Papiſt, finding no iuſt quarrell to be pickt at my life, haue thought good to caſt vpon mee this pleaſant and falſe diſgrace, let not the Fauourers of the Goſpell ſecond him in my cauſeleſſe Perſecution. For my Libeller, whoſoeuer hee is hee may ſecretly pleaſe himſelf with this poore flaſh of ſpightfull wit, but the GOD of Heauen (my iuſt Auenger) ſhall one day find him out, and pay my arrerages to his coſt▪ Vnto that righteous Iudgement I appeale, and ſince the Author cannot be known
