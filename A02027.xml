            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            ¶ To the right Honorable and his singular good Lord the Lord Sturton, Iohn Grange vvisheth health, vvelth, and prosperitie, vvith increase of Honour.
            
               I 
               Knowe (moste Honorable) your vvisedome may maruell, and not vvithout cause, that I vvho of all other am to be reputed the moste vnlearned, vvoulde take vpon me, hauing small skill, or little or none in Palmistrie, to discourse or rather intreate of the eleuation or declination of the Mount of Venus, seing both finer vvittes, and

                     que

                  utor vltra crepidam, lavvfully alluded of Apelles for the curious carping at his vndeserued pensell, I may (vvanting feete to runne) creepe, though as slovve as doth the Snayle, vvho refusing to come at the cal of Iupiter vnto his generall feast for all liuing creatures, vvas iustly punished as you see, vvith the cariage of hir house on hir backe, vvherby straying vvhether she list, is neuer the farther from home. Thus your vvisedome may see the great desire vvhich I had, somvvhat to set forth, and that, vvhat best might agree vvith your Honours youthfull yeeres, &amp;

not mislike my youthfull aucthoritie, vvho desirous to paint, as vvel the pleasure as displeasure of Loue, thought good (mingling the svveete vvith the soure) not onely to discourse of the eleuation, but also of the declinatiō of the Mount of Venus, for that they are dependant (as fellovv

And though (my Lord) nothing ought to be penned svvaruing or not proceding frō graue aucthoritie, yet often times vnder a defuse garmēt lieth a clodde of vvisdome. Likevvise, if vnskilfull heds shoulde frame thēselues to the limitation of this Greeke prouerbe, Quam quisque

Yea Democritus, and Anaxago

                  as, lofte bothe their goodes and patrimonies (as all men do knovv) onely for the desire of learning. Also Diodo

                  us the Stoike, is not much incōparable to these, vvho thorovv his continuall vvatch and excessiue studie, being blinde of long time, knovving nothing but vvhat vvas red vnto him by a little childe, yet gaue himselfe vnto the studie of Geometrie, teaching vvith vvordes vvho vvere desirous to learne, hovv and in vvhat māner each liue should be layed. VVherfore (O grafte of noble stocke) hauing the like desire (if so I might say) as these haue had to learning, my desire and not my skill, my good vvill and not my penne is to be accepted, as the simple Raddish roote vvrapped in a peece of greene Sarcenet vvas better accepted at the Prince his handes, than vvas a goodly fayre Horse gorgeously trapped giuen him of his marchaunt, for that in deede he knevv their vvilles vvere not alike: the

poore man gaue his Radish roote for pure loue, but the other his sumptuous Horse in hope of a greater benefite. Thus preacing (more boldly than vvisely) vpō your Honours curtesie, I haue brought vnto your Lordshippe a handfull of fragrant floures (though not gathered in Adonis garden). the chiefe vvhereof are Primeroses and Violettes. Your choyce is not great, yet chuse vvhat likes you best, the vvorst turne backe againe. For if some may please, and none displease, I shall not onely thinke my time vvel spent, and my diligence better imployed, but also my labour and trauell best of al bestovved. And vvheras I seeme (as you shall hereafter perceyue) to ground my Paganicall Pamphlet vpon the song of Apollo, most melodiously song vnto me (as me thought) in a visiō: I vvould not your Honour should thinke the painting of my pēne to be Verbatim spoken of Apollo his mouth, but rather the grounde thereof, vvhiche in most ample manner follovving I haue delated, vvherby eche one may see (as it vvere in a gorgeous garish glasse before their eyes) a pretie poeticall Pamphlet, shevving paganically, as vvell the lavvful copulacion betvveene Vulcano and Venus, as the vnlavvfull combat betvveene hir and Mars. Also in this mery meane a playne mirrour of youthful vanities shall play his parte, and the shade thereof shall bereaue you of your senses. In the ensigne likevvise of this army, your Honour shall finde vvritte (as it vvere vvith letters of pure Gold) a chiefe poynte of vvomens vanities, videlicet, looke vvhat they may haue, coste it neuer so muche, they esteeme not: but by a toy of light valevve, and not easily commen by, they

but vvhy seeme I (vvho as yet neuer receyued one poynt of discourtesie of any veneriall Dame) to display vvith penne and inke vpō the imbecillitie of their natures? God graunt (say I) Euripides may vvell vvithstand their boysterous blasts, vvho in his Tragedie intituled Medea, affirmeth that vvomens vvittes are vnapte to goodnesse, but very vvell inclined to vnhappinesse, bicause (sayde he) vvomen are creatures vnperfect, and vvhere perfectiō is not, there can nothing rest that is good. It seemeth the nebbe of my penne is long, and that I lesse do feare the stubbing therof. Such surmises (beleue me) assent to veritie, my yōg yeres say, I speake not by experience, but rather by heare say: and vvhat of this? riper yeares &amp; mellovver vvittes knovv I fayne not herein, for many of them vnvvillingly haue the proofe thereof. Yet vvould I not, vvho haue no title hereunto, should seeme to chalēge me as their vniust accuser, for I meane not generally, my surmise is not vnknovvne, Rubbe a gauld Horse on the backe and it is a chaunce if 
                     •
                  ee kicketh not. I vvill not say but that Dame Nature hath played hir part in deuiding and distributing hir gifts equally, as vvell to the one as to the other. For vve see, as vve haue Apollo and Mercurie for Goddes, so Pallas and Minerua for Goddesses of vvisdome as Mars so Bellona for vvar: as Cupide so Venus for loue: as Pan so Ceres for inuention of husbandrie: yea, as Morpheus so Murcas for sleepe. Thus (to be shorte) God hath appointed the pleasure of vvomen to conteruayle the toyle of man. Neither are the deedes of men more valiant than the mindes of vvomē, vvhose courage abateth no not vvith the fiercenesse of Tygres, as appeared by the vviues and matrones of Persia, vvho thorovv their valiant hartes, noble courage and impudencie, being ashamed of the flight of their husbandes, prouoked them

to returne againe vnto battel, and not onely to ouercome them of vvhome sometimes not onely they, but Cyrus him selfe stood in dread, but also in the same battell to take king Astyages prisoner. Moreouer, vvho hath not redde of the valiantnesse of Queene Thomyris? vvho hearing of the death of hir onely sonne, began not to reuenge the same vvith teares, sobbes, sighes, and pensiuenesse, as vvomen vse to do (Tullie testifying the same in his seconde boke of Tusculanes questions, vvho inferring vpon this proposition De tolerando dolore, afirmeth that Fletus muliebr

                   ingenio additus) but girded hir self vvith the svvorde, and armed hir body vvith the shielde of Mars, cutting off the heare of hir head, and attiring hir selfe in the manner of a man, vntill such time as shee had gotten the head of Cyrus, vvith the like vvyles that he vsed tovvard hir sonne. Also vvho knovveth not that the Amazones ruled their realme betvveene themselues of a long time vvithout the ayde of any man, cutting off their right dugges for hindring the casting of their dartes, vvherof they tooke this name Amazones (that is) vvanting their right dugges? But softe here I checke, least some sticke not to say behinde my backe, a blasing starre vvil shoote. But vvhat if they do? It is a greate winde that shaketh corns: neither do I thinke but that the standers by vvhiche heare this (hauing any iudgement at all) vvil easily descerne a difference betveene Orpheus and Pan. I knovv all men are not giuen to say vvell, neither to iudge alike. For (as Plato sayeth) Quot capitatet sunt sententiae▪
                some men vvill say, this poynt vvas penned to mystically: and an other vvill say behinde my backe, this shade vvas to grosse: here vvas to much learning shevved, and here vvas none at all: here Apollo and Pallas guided his penne: here Pan molested him vvith his oten pipe: here vvill th

               ogge, and not vvithout a cause, for I knovv they can not speake so euill of me as my penne deserueth. But yet vvhat so euer they say, the blinde man may see in this glasse, vvhat apishe vvittes vvomen haue to inuestigate by interrogatiue similitudes the perfect meaning and the sure grounde of their louers harte: and those vvhiche haue their cleare sight to looke stedfastly herein, shall see perchaunce an Ape vvhipped, vvhich somvvhat may delight him. VVherevpon certen yong Gentlemen and those of my professed friendes (vvell vievving this vvorke) requested me earnestly to haue intituled it A nettle for an Ape, but yet (being somvvhat vvedded as most fooles are) to mine ovvne opinion, vvho vvould hardly forgoe their bable for the Tovver of London) I thought it good (somvvhat to stop a zoilous mouth) to sette a more cleanly name vpon it, that is, Golden Aphroditis. For if the other had stoode, vvho most had bene bitten herevvith peraduenture vvould haue sought all the meanes they could to haue turned this vvhippe for mine ovvne tale. But stay here a little, I loue not to be coūted a ranger, least thorovv my appearing aboue the vvater, I seeme to prognosticate thereby (as doth the Dolphin) that some storme or tempest approcheth at hande. I trust though my penne dothe seeme to paint at large, yet not to lauishe. For vvhereas it seemeth to blase or painte the incineration of Veneriall dames and ruffling Nymphes, it proceedeth not of any spite, malice, hatred, melancholy, or euil vvill that I beare vnto the chaste Matrones, or vnto any one that may iustly chalenge vnto themselues one little sparke of the spice thereof. Therefore vvho are vvilling to vnderstande, I

If any one seemeth to be touched herevvith to the quicke, let them propounde their Quare, and I vvill alvvaies be at hande Reddere rationem therevnto. Yet on vvhome so euer it chaunceth to sounde forth this interrogation (vvhat outvvard countenaunce so euer she beare) yet can it not be sounded, but as it vvere Tragico boatu, therefore vvho listeth so to do, to ayde them in their enterprise, I thinke it best they cal vpō the dolefull Muse Melp

            For this I dare auouch, that oftentimes vyho seemeth most of al to blaze their chastitie vvith the Tergate of Medusa, they play more legerdemaynes vnder this cleane kind of conueyance, or at the least as many, as do those vvho neuer vvoore the necklace of Iasper, neither knevve so much as the cheyne of Diamantes and Topazes, vvhiche are counted the instrumentes of chastitie. And partly for a profe thereof, vvho marketh vvell each thing comprehended in this little volume, shal finde, that I haue somvvhat noted hereof by the conception of Diana, vvho alvvaies bore the name of Chastitie it self. Many other pointes (moste Honorable) might here be noted, but that I hate the checke of Ne quid nimis, and (as the Prouerbe goeth) Little sayde▪ soone amended. My good vvill I trust, shall suffice for this once, and though my vvell doing may not counteruaile the same, yet I trust your Honour vvill not sticke to defende me, in saying in my behalfe, Et voluisse sat est. Thus ceasing to trouble your Lordship any farther at this

time. I commit you to the tuicion of the highest, to direct your pathes in true Honour and dignitie: desiring also the Ladies of the destenie, so to prolong the fatall threde of this thy terestriall life: that thou mayst runne the race of hoarie Naestor, to the pleasure of the almightie, and the great comfort of those vvhiche vvishe thee vvell.

               Thus labour I with tooth and nayle of Lethe force to be:
               Then with obliuion might I force your carping cares to flee.

               Yet neare cold find what pen deserude, which was not known before.
               Thus dayly musing, where to finde whereon to wreake my spight,
               Me thought I harde Apollo sing full sweetely in the night,

Here resteth nowe (to goe consequently) the cause why Dame Diana named this Nymphe A. O. whiche is, bycause the Oracle of Apollo, (Alpha Omega) signified vnto hyr mother firste and laste, therefore did she call hyr by the firste letters of the same (videlicet) A. O. But nowe I knowe yee looke I shoulde returne to my matter (that is) to shewe in deede the firste originall acquayntaunce of Sir V. O. and the worthie Nymphe Alpha Omega, which as briefly as I can, I will declare. N. O. beyng a man of great possessions, detestyng alwayes the frothe of Venus, before such time as the wonderfull beautie of this Nymphe had not onely dasled his eyes, but also bestraught hym of hys former senses, hauing neither male nor female to inioy his goodes and landes, what tyme the fatall threede of this his terestriall lyfe was thorowly expired and ended, lamented sore the Metamorphosis of his cousin Hippomenes, and dayly repayred before the presence of all the homericall Gods, crāuyng moste earnestly vpon his knees his cousins shape to bee restored agayne, (whome Cibele the mother of the Goddes had turned into a whyte Lyons shape with the beautifull Atlanta his wyfe, for seekyng the fraytes of Venus in the woodde where hyr

dayly habitation was, without any reuerence of the place) whiche by no meanes hee coulde obtayne. Alpha Omega likewyse remaynyng in the Ilande Seiros, bryng praysed of all others for hyr wonderfull beautie (settyng no lesse thereby than in deede others did) hearyng of the fayre mayden Atlanta who lately liued in the sayde Ilande, whome Hippomenes thorowe the counsel of Venus wonne to be his wedded wife, desired vpō a time of the Goddes that hyr righte shape might bee restored agayne, meanyng thereby (as I suppose) to see which of their beauties were most to be esteemed, seyng they were bothe of all menne so highly allowed, and so greatly proued (for sure it is, one woman enuieth the beautie of an other) and thinketh hyr self fayrest of all. So frownyng fortune and cruell destinie yet withstoode hyr enterpryse, that naught hyr suyte before the Goddes coulde preuayle (Venus especially being hyr heauy friend (onely for hyr beauties sake.)

Wherefore I see, either I muste sinke in Syrtes sandes, tis drowne in Lethe lake. Thus is thy loue a Labyrinth to me for my likyng.

            This (being finished) he layed his drowsie head vpon his softe pillow to sleepe: but (God wote) it was so sore pestered with the tedious thoughtes of his fayre Ladie, that whilest he thought to haue rested his weried limmes in a bedde of security, his senses were rested (as it were to the thirde heauen) with feare of digression. Thus (as one being placed where pleasure was, and could not participate the same) with many a sobbing sighe, and skalding teare he wrested foorth the tedious night, in hope, that if the Muses Thaleia and Pelymneia fauoured his tong, as well as Phoebus and Calliope the direction of his penne, his rising shoulde be on the right side on that day: yet wresled he so his effeminate bande to the siege of backewarde affection, that both trumpe and drumme sounded nothing for their Larum, but Baccare, Baccare: yet as the sound of trumpe and stroke of drumme incourageth not a little the▪ henlyke man to martiall feates, blouddy actes, and warlike prowes, thinking thereby to rayse an euerlasting fame whiche neither the obliuion of memory should

The captaine seing his hand broken, and his armye scattered, standeth in a quandare, not knowing what to doe. Thus good Lady (my question being moued) my demaund is in this case, if you were captayn, which of these three companies would you hold withall? The Ladie marking well his proposition▪ made answere in thys sort: Syr knyght (quoth she) this case is playne, the valyaunt Souldioure hadde rather truste to the force of hys armes amiddest hys enimies, than in the fielde a fayre payre of heeles to shew. Therfore, who vsed that vayne of manhoode, I iudge were iustly serued: the

                  That hounde which seekes by ranging foote a virgins rule to spill.
                  Which lothsom death wt fearful mace cōmands to work my dome,
                  With ayde lykewise of sisters three to finish foorth my tombe.

Which seeing it came not according to his expectation, he mounted vpon his bayarde gray, making a poste iorney (being hotte on the spurre) partely to visite his Ladye, and partely to aunswere vnto hir obiections, whiche no doubte but in thundering wise soone after his comming she poured forth.
                  Note hereby howe harde it is for women to keepe any thing secrete, and the waightier the thing, the harder the restraint of blabbing the same,
                I might doe wel here to bring in the curiosity of louers &amp; the care they haue al things should be as neare as might at ye greting of their Ladies. But especially in things about their forehead, bycause it is yt fronte of their army which stādeth in case to make or marre, as in mundiflyng their beardes, cristalling their teeth, correcting their haires, cutting their sublabes, or in demediating the haires of their heads, some again in turning their monchachous the Turkie way, in washing their temples with rose water, &amp; other some desire to perfume their clothes, and set their ruffes after the french fashion. Thus to be short, euery one delighteth in one thing or an other wherby they should eleuate the spirites of their faire Dames, as with fragrante floures, which represent their Ladies, or else with sweete perfumes whiche giue occasion to the prouocation of pleasure, as in opening their appetites, or else they haue taken it of a custome of Venus

But softe bold you here contented with these foolish toyes, vntil occasion serue to bring such like in place. N. O. had no sooner greeted his Ladye with an humble salutation, but (she hardly forbearing the suppressiō of hir hart tolde him incontinently what she had hearde: Who answering sayde, the higher the Sun, the lesser our shadowes are, and Asterites keeping his light within, sheweth it foorth by little and little, yet who so beholdeth it thorowly shal find it in propertie most like to the star

For such was the force of the preuy stroke of affection (as hee sayth) that beauty hir self semed but vgly in his sighte, in comparison of the rosed cheekes of his lady, which his outward eyes and inward hart had chosen by vowe to be his wedded mate: whervpon he craued of his Trust (for so he had termed hir) that what soeuer he said in hir presence (as perforce constrained therunto) it might bee taken not to proceede of any dissimulation, but rather of a pure and contrite hart, who (refrayning hir tong for a season) said. As I finde so in time will I loose (meaning therby) (as I thinke) that if she found him loyal, faythful, and trusty as he had professed, then woulde she lose him from suspition of dissimulation. But tel me sir (quoth she) can the force of affection so rule in any creature, that what seemeth not only foule and filthy, but also thorow missehap of body vggly in others sight, the same should seeme moste beautifull and wel proportioned in his sight? why not Lady (quoth he) for if a womā hath matched hir selfe to one as vggly, misseshapen, and misfauored as Thersites, a

Such is the force of fonde affection. If this be true whiche stories make plaine, what maruell is it then (faire Ladye) that I with the sight of thee am rauisht? whose liuely countenance feedeth as well myne eye, as did the disputations of learned men in schooles feede the earen of the worthy Emperour Charles the fourth, who seemest in my sight faire Helen of Troy, Polixene, Caliope, yea Atlanta hir selfe in beautie to surpasse, Pandoras in qualities, Penelope and Lucretia in chastenesse to deface. Oh God why seeme I thus thy dower to disgrace? who seemest rather in honour Iuno, in wisedome Pallas, in beautie Venus, in shape of personage Aegeria, in chastitie Diana, &amp; to be short, in huswifery Minerua. Or how durst I presume to lay

my based finger vpon thy stately corps (I vnworthy thereof) whose relucent beames as yet Gradatim doe increace, whiche shewes by perfect plea thy courteous harte, and eke thy braue demeanure therwithal: These fonde fayned fansies (quod she) and wanton foolish eyes deserueth a glasse of dissemblyng water, but an x, or a nod shall serue for a due garde, &amp; yet what make you then of beautie by this quoth she?) Plato defined it lady (quoth he) to be a priuiledge of nature: Carneades a solitary kingdome: but Pomitius sayde, that there was nothing more acceptable in an honest woman: Aristotle affirmed, that beautie is more worth than all the letters of commendation: Homer commended it for a glorious gifte of nature, and Quid called it a grace of God. You seemed me thought (sayed A.O) to define this vpon the beautie of an honest woman: but what thinke you of a Curtisan? who answered: their beautie (sayeth Socrates) is a tyrannie of shorte tyme: Theophrastu

O. very well: but especially to heare hyr selfe commended of hyr bestbeloued before Atlanta, who sometyme bore the bell of beauties price in that hyr natiue soyle. Wherfore (his talke beyng ended) she sayde, his tongue was made of massiue golde, inferryng moreouer, that Apelles pensell, nor yet Sulpicia the Romayne dame, were able so to paynte or carue in tables of brasse, the stately corps of Venus rufflyng Nimphes, as was his tong their features to discrie. Not so (deare dame) I would (quoth he) my tongue such vigor had, as to expresse thy vertues all which harte could neuer thinke, ne penne much lesse (as I suppose) with ease might well subscribe, whome Marcia she, that all surpassed hath in perfect worke in imagerie, could not hyr pensell frame in hande thy outwarde shape to graue, although in deede (as stories doe vnfolde) she nought did vse in those hyr liuing dayes but caruing worke, to paynte, or else to drawe the shapes of those whose beautie was a patterne to beholde for rufflyng dames, yet woulde she neuer carue nor drawe the shape of any man, least that the sight of carnall things might rayse such carnall lustes, as might abridge hyr virgins lawes. Suche was hyr chosen pathe.

This praysing of N.O. his rolling tongue did encourage him not a little by polished phrase of filed style to feede his Ladies appetites or humors with some one thing or other, whereby he might fancie what fancie most requyred. And therefore fillyng his ladyes eares with wordes (occasion seruing him so) he fell from this treatise into the discourse of chaste Matrones, as in declaryng how that, when Atropos, Lachesis and Cloth

But (ladie quoth he) seyng the Musicke and company breaketh off our talke, remember the Prouerbe, Eate well of the Cresses. Whereby he meant, remember our talke, for Cresses is an hearbe whiche helpeth muche the memory. Away shee went, and nought she sayde but mumme. Gentles of all sorte bothe male and female wanted not in this company, who seyng supper tyme was paste, they sought to recreate theyr spirites, some in dauncing, some in cardyng, some in dycing, and some agayne in pleasantly arguyng of Ueneriall disputations, but N.O. thynkyng his Lady rather to delight in dauncyng than in any other exercise there vsed, (bycause the propertie of moste women is to delight in the same) he tooke hys Ladie by the tender fiste, fetchyng hyr from the place where she satte, and ledde hyr a stately daunce called Thias rounde, a daunce sometime dedicated vnto Bacchus, whereto the gentles gaue theyr whole consent, and helde by handes a rounde: It fell by course N.O. shoulde leade this trace, bycause he knewe it beste, the tracyng of this rounde requyred in the middle thereof a conge, whiche he (forsakyng his marroll) bestowed vpon an other Gentlewoman, holdyng with handes the rounde, but not dauncing, whether he mistooke the one for the other, or thought that at all times he might be bold to kisse his owne though not the other, so wel as then, bycause the daunce was as a cloke to couer the rayne as touchyng his desire to the same, or the daunce so requyred, I knowe not: but sure it is A.O. thought no small discourtesie herein, who for manners sake stayed till the daunce was ended.

                  What doth preuaile cōplainte or none, for nought therby I gaine?
                  Yet Poetes say that Triton can with sounding trumpe inforce
                  Eche thing that hath exceeded bandes receiue his former corce.
                  If this be true, then Triton come retreyte with me to blowe:

                  And like vnto the turtle Doue whiche changeth not for new.

                  Whose harte is like to Aetna hill which burneth day and night.

               N.O. fouldyng vp this letter in his chamber, Mistresse Angelica one of A.O. hyr gentlewomen hauyng occasion to goe thorow his chamber, and seyng him foulding vp these verses, snatched them away from him, but with his consent, for he knewe she woulde as well shewe them vnto hir Mistresse, as his heauy cheare and sadde countenaunce vsed for the nonce, whiche was his whole desire. For if she had not thus vsed him, he would haue layed them in the place of his other verses, priuily stealyng away vntill such tyme as this cloude were ouercast: which in deede he did. For willyng the yong gentlewoman to remember hir mistresse of this phrase, Eate well of the Cresses, vnknowing to any in the house, he secretely wente his way. A.O. perceyuing the beginning of these morning verses to depēd vpon the other poeticall cōmendation, she perswaded hir selfe then that she perfectly knew the aucthor thereof. N.O. within a day or two after his suddaine departure (as most woers do, sparing no coste) sent many a precious &amp; costly iewell vnto his Lady in token of his great good will towarde hyr. But she nought regarding the coste (by reason as it shoulde seeme of the easie commyng thereby) neglected his giftes, saying: Eche birde can haue corne in the haruest tyme, meanyng thereby (as I thinke) that whyle she lyued in that order, shee coulde not wante what mighte so easily be commen by, what soeuer it coste. Wherevpon he remembryng the commendation which sometime shee sette vpon a rare and sumptuous iewell whiche Venus wore vpon hyr fronte, whose lyke for vertue was not to be founde agayne, and remembryng the common Prouerbe and vsuall experience, Farre fette and deare bought doe fansie Ladyes moste of all, he sought by all meanes possible that mighte be inuented, some pretie deuice whereby to gette the same. Who seyng the wilde horses to haue gotten their raynes at will from vnskilfull Phaeton, who wilfully woulde haue the guyding of the Chariot whiche caried the radyant Sunne aboute the worlde: and knowing the same of force to prouoke a greate hurlyburly among the Goddes and Goddesses in heauen, repayred thether in haste, whome accordyng to his expectation hee founde almoste besides themselues, fearyng the consumyng bothe of Heauen and Earth

by fire. Where seyng the Goddesses most of all skuddelyng and sekyng to defende themselues longest from smothering, hee besought Diana vppon his knees, as shee loued hyr naturall daughter, to helpe him with the same. Who beyng moued with pittie, willed hym to goe vnto Venus, tellyng hyr that hyr temple is sette on fyre, and Cypres where shee was worshipped moste of all is consumed to naught, whereat (quoth she) shee will not onely rende hyr clothes, but also (neglectyng where) caste them here and there, whiche when you see hir doe, take the Iewell and goe your way. This precept lyked N.O. very well, who (doyng as she had commaunded him) founde eche thing to fall out in all respectes accordyng vnto hyr deuination before, wherefore he taking vp this Iewell, departed with great ioye and gladnesse, and sent it vnto his Lady for a token, who knowyng it at the firste sighte, receyued it ioyfully, although in the bryngers sighte but scornefully, by reason of hyr cloked countenaunce: for giuyng the seruaunt thankes, and rewardyng him liberally, shee sente his Master none at all. Thus eche man may see, though the louers purse be strung with the blade of a leeke, as the Poetes faine by Cupide dreaming of their to muche liberalitie, yet nothyng will please the froward mindes of their Ladyes, if affection beare not a stroke among them, or else the gifte be as hardly wonne as this. For Venus perceyuyng hyr Temple to stande, and the Ile of Cypres as yet vnwasted, and seyng the Father of Phaeton had taken vppon hym agayne the guydyng of the Sunne (at the earnest request of Iupiter) waxed very wrothe, with the misinformer of these things, sendyng Circes with a cuppe of all kynde of diseases to plague him for the same. Whiche hee thorowe the aduice of his stepmother Dian
                     •
                  
                vtterly refused. But Venus further perceyuing the Iewell whereof shee sette suche greate store, to be taken fro the place where shee flung hyr vpper garmentes, and knowyng well the bereauer thereof (for nothyng vnto the Goddes and Goddesses are vnknowne) she turned him for his suttlety in stealyng the same into a wylie Foxe. But Diana (perceyuing the same) werried him incontinētly with hir houndes, and of his bloud restored his shape againe.

Then fearing the discouery of hyr daughter for wearing the same: she changed not onely the colour, but also the propertie of the iewel, euen as it hanged on hir daughters fronte: So that dame Venus knewe not what was become thereof. But (ad propositum) whether these moning verses of N.O. moued his Lady to pitie or no, I can not tell, but sure they might, for the thing it selfe was pityfull. Nothing she sayde of a long time: but yet the smothering fire at length breakes forth in flame. For she seing his long absence, and hearing in deede howe heauily he tooke the matter, greatly regardyng also his giftes in token wise, coulde not refrayne, but spent hyr dayes in sobbing sighes for woe, and beyng aboute somewhat to haue written vnto him, whereby he mighte haue taken hartie grace, these verses following came vnto hir handes.

                  For tangled thus in Scyllas bandes, and whelmde in Lethe lake,
                  Who can me helpe but thou alone? tis onely for thy sake.
                  If nought may breede remorse, nor make your stony harte relent,
                  Then may I wake, &amp; wayle the night, my bed wt teares be sprent.

                  Then may I say as Sisiphus, I toyle to none effect,
                  As Theseus, and Ticius, with other of my secte.
                  Then is thy loue a Labyrinth vnto me for my liking:
                  Whome great good will hath grauelled, since Cupid fell a striking.
                  But yet in time I hope to finde such mercie at thy hande:
                  
                     That where thy wrath sometime bore sway, thy friendship once shall stand.

                  THy sudden departure (N.O.) seemed somewhat strange vnto me, and stranger would haue seemed, if not thy penne &amp; deedes bewrayed had the cause thereof. As touching the whiche thou knowest right well (N.O.) the Hauke whiche seemes to checke at fiste, deserueth well the losse of siluer belles, but yet, as thou seekest so shalte thou finde, I thyrste for no mans bloud. Your wounde as yet is greene, and I no Surgeon am, but yet if so you graunt your selfe my pacient for to be, if that to heale your griefe my arte may stande in steede, behold good will is preste this cure to take in hand. I haue not much to say, but where your wounde dothe finde his cure, in them repose your truste. And looke who gaue the sore, lette them prouide the salue. Thus fare you well from my lodge where I marche in dumpes of musing minde.

By this you seeme (sayde shee) to agree with Plato, who in wryting set downe that the sudden passions and extreeme rage of feruent louers was not only to be imbraced, but also to be desired and wished for, as the happiest and most blisfull life of al. Who answered, I graunt herevnto:

Who denying his Minor, hee answered: I meane not really but effectually. A O. (mistrustyng more than shee needed) woulde not seeme to graunt ouer hastily, but seekyng the pithe and grounde of euery thyng, asked him, what if thy friende bestowe an acre of grounde vpon thee (not hauing proofe thereof) you plowe it deepe, you harrow it well, and bestowe good sethe thereon, and yet (not fallyng out accordyng to your expectation) it yeeldeth no fruyte to requite your labour, much lesse the seede bestowed thereon?

he walked a pretie space in a groue buttyng or adioyning vpon the house, castyng as it were all suche obiections vnto himselfe as he thought by any meanes she could obiect vnto him in the morning, (whiche done) he labored earnestly to premeditate suche answeres as might refell the same. But being soone weary therof, he returned agayne: and standing in the dore of the Hall of cōmon assembly (none as yet sturring in the house saue he alone) he talked to himselfe as touching the great desire whiche he had of his good successe, which Dan Eccho (neuer sleeping) cut off diffusedly by the latter sillable. N.O. perceyuing this deuision of vocables, thought good to note the sense thereof, bycause (sayde he, as some say) it importeth not a litle to the Prognostication or foreshewing of things to come. Wherefore framyng his wordes in this order vnto himself, he noted Verbatim the clipping sounde of Eccho.

Wherfore his wits abashed at the firste to vtter his mynde vnto them, but Melpomene seyng him to stande in suche amaze, coniectured thereby hee had some matter to breake vnto them, whiche not the imbecilitie of witte, but the bashefulnesse of hys tongue forbidde hym there to vtter. Wherefore moste courteously shee cheared him on, saying: what is thy will? feare not but shewe it foorth at large: whereat N. O. takyng a better courage, tolde foorth his will and chiefe desire in this order. O Muses worthie of musing, by earnest suyte I craue of your wonted &amp; accustomed courtesie, to vnlace your liberalitie, extendyng your beneuolence in fillyng this Goblet of mine, with the heauenly and vnspeakeable dewe of your gratious Fountayne. Whereat Melpomene answered for them all as you shall heare. This sacred well (quoth shee) is of suche force, that who tasteth thereof partaketh of our vertues: and by this meanes if it shoulde be made common, wee shoulde in tyme bee had in the lesse reputation and honor. Also our father Iupiter gaue vs the same, condicionally, that none shoulde be partaker thereof, except they coulde define their race to haue descended from the mighty powers. Alas Goddesse (quoth hee) I craue it not for my selfe but for my vowed wyfe, whose byrthe I knowe to thee is not vnknowen. No sir (quoth shee) I knowe hyr race full well, thy Lady is in my libertie, and eke I know the cause of thy demaund.

Thou shalte not come in vayne, I graunt thee thy request, and herewith shee tooke hyr siluer pensell (and dippyng it in this well) shee graued within the couer of his Goblet in wauing manner these verses following.

            These verses N.O. receyued as thankefully, as worthily, and in as good parte as if they had bene a thing of greater pryce: and in shorte time after, he visited his Lady with his presence, whereas before he had greeted hyr with his giftes and good will. His cōming was somewhat late, and (according vnto the time) he founde them at supper, where after his salutation, due reuerence and courtesie he sat him downe: it chaunced in this supper (as a poynt of courtesie) he offered a Gentlewoman salte vpon hyr trencher, who at that profered curtesie weeped most bitterly, and would haue risen from the borde if hyr trencher had not bene quickly changed. But an other gentlewomā on the contrary nature, weeped bicause she was denayed salte after this at his handes, who made a vowe (for hyr sake) he would neuer giue women salte againe: their contrarietie of natures caused the Gentlemen to demaunde at the boorde, whiche seemed of them to be most▪ testie of nature? she to whome the salte was offered, or she to whome it was denayed? some helde that shee who loued it was most angry: and some helde the contrary, shewing how the Doue whiche delighteth most therein, is the gentlest, lowliest, louingest, meekest, and friendliest byrde that is. But the other side argued to proue their reason, that all those kynde of creatures whiche haue the gall, if they delight in salte, of force can not be testie, affirmyng also that the Doue hath no

of them would breake their heades (not a litle) to make full sense thereof. At the sight whereof all men mused, but none would take it in hande: at the length as an vnknowen Aucthor, he ended them thus:

                  Who will the curnell of the nutie,
                  must breake the shell:
                  Who will the spoyle of any towne,

            All men desired much to know the true Author of these verses, but muche more the sense and meanyng thereof. But N.O in no cace would be acknowne thereof. His meaning thereby was this, he perceyuing certen gentlemen to be inflamed with loue towarde a lusty yong Lady of the company, who were abashed to shewe their great good wil towards hyr, thought by the sight hereof pryuily to bolden them to giue the attempt: but the Ladyes burned so inwardly with a greedy desire of knowing the Author, that at the borde Alpha Omega with the reste of the gentlewomen, wished openly no greater treasure than his wisedome to counteruayle their beautie. Whereat three droppes of liuely bloudde fell downe from N.O. his nose, whiche (A.O. perceyuing) mistrusted thereby the Author: and meaning to discouer him in some secrete order (shee sayde) how cheare you (N O.) I see Apolloe sings, but not bewrayes his penne. Why Madame (quoth he) it is too freshe to be superfluous bloud, meaning thereby, that it was penned to mistically to intende to none effect.

For (accordyng vnto my iudgement) well might they be so termed, bicause (as yet) they are the first fruytes which my Muse hath yeelded. Notwithstanding, your Lordship knoweth right well, that of these Prymeroses and Uiolets, there be diuers and sundry kindes: whereof some are double, and some agayne are single: the double we see are peculiar to pryuate gardens, and become so double thorow theyr oft planting, but the single are wilde, and grow in the common fieldes: the one forte is farre more beautifull to the eye, and sweeter than the other. Whereof (moste Honorable) I counte these my Prymeroses to be of the worser and meaner sorte, by reason of their firste plantyng. But if your Honor shall lyke well therof, I do not double but that by oft mouing of them in their kindes, they may aspyre to some liuely sparkes of sauour, and become as double as the better sorte. But yet, thus much I doe coniecture, that if they were the sweetest floures of all, yet would they be mislyked of some, and, those of the greater sorte, whiche maketh some in deede for feare of their Z

But what neede I to blase thy golden giftes of nature, when as thy wisedome of it selfe doth counteruayle thy curtesie, and fame already hath incountered with thy worthinesse? stay therfore O Muse, least while I seeke to prayse him at the full, for wante of abilitie I seeme rather to diminishe his fame than otherwise: or to discommend in seeking to commend him. Your Honors wisedome may wel surmise that my homely stile is so plainly paynted without any shade or cannopie, that a great many will blushe in the reading thereof, and rather reape harme than profite thereby. Such bashfull youthes I exhorte to do as Socrates did, who when he heard any one talke dishonestly, did hide his head with his cloake vntill the tale was ended.

And sure in my minde he shewed no greater learnyng in any one booke of his penning, than he did in this. But I passe beyonde my boundes, thus much I thought good to bryng in for the allowing of my pleasaunt stile of wryting. And as for my rudenesse therein, I trust no reader will seeme to condemne me for the least faulte therein, as Domician the Emperour, who for euery faulte committed, woulde condemne the malefactor to die. Least thorowe their tyranny and rashe iudgement they purchase the lyke hatred as Domician whilom did: for Iudicium durum sequitur sententia dura. Beare therefore (gentle Reader) I beseeche thee with my bolde attempte in wrytyng, accepting rather my good will herein than the thing it selfe (vnlesse in your owne iudgement it deserueth to bee accepted) yet iudge thereof with equitie. And if it deserue

commendation, so it is, if not, then vse thy discretion therein. For I must needes say that such Tragedies as intend to inhumanitie, are not worthie of reading, neyther to be put in printe. But yet the Tragedies of Euripides and Sophocles interlaced with pretie Poemes and pleasaunt talke I condemne not, whose sweete language did as it were intermedle the graces with the Muses. Wherefore suche Paganicall histories and poeticall Pamphlets ought to be red

            ¶ A valiant yong Gentleman beyng trayned vp in Martiall provves, and allured by euill counsell to womens follies, bewayleth his life in this order.
            SOmetime in Martiall deedes, I set my whole delight:
            And eke my stedfast eyes did hate, of wāton dames the sight.
            But now I take delight, each blasing starre to vewe,
            My tongue likewise with sugred wordes, inquireth of their mewe.
            Then thither fast I hie, if hope doth giue me grace,
            And many wanton lookes I cast, to vewe hir comely face.
            Thus hath shee wonne my harte, my purse is neuer tide,
            Good will hath giuen a dasing dente, fro thence I may not bide.
            In hope I spende my time, in hope to gayne my will,
            I daunce attendance euery day, in hope to haue my fill.
            Sometime I haue my wishe, the bensell of hir bowe,
            Sometime I haue my hartes desire, of certen this I knowe.
            Sometime againe I wante, what is my hartes desire,
            Which as dry wood, and kindling coles, doth set my harte on fire.
            Then I to late repent my want on foolishe eye,
            Which gustheth forth like springs of teares, my cōstāt hart to trie.
            Than this, what greater griefe? to spende my winde in vayne,
            On those who nought regarde my harte, &amp; lesse regard my payne.
            Then wishe I all to late, that Mars had rulde my will,
            Then Cupid he, nor Venus had, not knowen my hart to kill.
            My goods are wasted whole, and I consumed am,
            Beware therefore by others harmes, a Tygre seemes a lam.
            
            But iudgement here I craue, who greater sorrowes sente,
            Of him who tyste me herevnto, or hir to whome I lente?
            If he, then all beware, of me who bought my witte,
            And shunne the counsell of the naught, a wise mans rule to hitte.
            If she, likewise eschewe, th'allurements of the nought,
            And learne by me, for sure it is, I haue my wisedome bought.
            Though tis a sugred bayte, it is but for the time,
            
               And riper yeares lamenteth much, the losse of former time.
            But youth regardeth not, the things that are to come,
            Oh would to God I followed had, the sound of trump &amp; dromme.
            For aged yeares forbid to runne this youthfull race,
            And warnde me oft, who wold not heare, for lighting in this cace.
            Yong men thinks old men fooles, but old men knoweth well,

            If she whome thus I kisse, did sayle in vertues barke,
            I crie you mercy then I sayde, I did mistake my marke.
            No harme, she would replie: thus I a kisse would gayne,

            NO foolishe fantasie through fonde affection, in this my sore faynting coulde I finde my (deare dame) to turne my payne to pleasure: wherefore, as one through stong with fierce Achidmas sting, requireth the second time to taste thereof, bicause playne proofe declares one poyson to driue forth an other: so I (as a foolish flie, who seing the bright flame of the candle, neuer linneth buzzing about the same till his wings are scortched with heate) perforce am constrayned willingly to enter the same, as a present remedie to mitigate my former grief. Whiche foreshewing vnto certain of my friendes, one among the rest whiche before that tyme had bene stong with the same sting, wished me rather to seeke forth some cū

But I (God knoweth) seeking this bathe at the Physitions hands was deceyued herein. For he (as it should seeme) delighting to see me pyne in payne, gaue me in steede hereof the iuyce of the hearbe Cresses whiche helpeth much the memory: which once perceyuing, I tolde it agayne to my former friende, who grieued thereat, tolde me moste comfortlesse there was no way for remedie but where I tooke my wounde. Wherefore (mine onely Castle of comforte) to thee I sue for grace. Thou knowst right wel (my Diamond deare) that twice before this tyme I haue bene arraigned at dame Venus hir barre, in which arraignment (Lady) as guiltlesse I haue helde vp my hande, standing to your curtesie as one accused I know not whereof but for loyalty. Thus as a poore prysoner haue I helde vp my hande, answeryng at the iudges call, and appealyng to your curtesie onely for some sparke of grace. But you as one willing to heare my pittyfull playn

Twise hope hath repreued me to appeale my chiefe dorrs herein, whiche as yet I woulde neuer. But the thirde time (in extremity of panges and dreadfull doubte of life) I am content. Braue beautie, demeanure, Cupid, and affection hath moued me herevnto. Loe, to thy demaund I haue yeelded, graunt therefore grace in tyme, else, I wishe not to liue but die. My gryping griefes would enioyne me to silence but that extremitie forceth me to speake: make answere therefore I pray thee to this demaunde, what should be the cause of the restrainte of your curtesie? as to base of byrth haue I clymed to hie? then the greater my fall.

But is there any mistrust of true meaning, constancie, greate good will or perfite loue? proofe declares this needed not, or thinke you extremity will cause me change? those mistrustfull handes of dissimulation doe but hinder your wittes of well thinking, and yet are no daynties for fine affection to feede vpon it so any curtesie rested in you. Wherefore thinke vpon my paineful pangs, and what I suffer for your sake, all is to little to gayne my wiche, and the least to muche to leese it. Graunt therefore with pittie what resteth to graunt, or else at the least in steede of a perfite yea, graunt but a weake denay. Then lingring hope wil perswade me, that where I tooke a deadly wound, there shall I finde a salue. Thus trusting to your vnknowne curtesie, wayling in woe and doubtfull of redresse, I leaue you to likyng. And yet my constancie commendes me thine owne for aye.

            The paynting of a Curtizan.
            
               IT is a worlde to see, eache feate displaying wise,
               Of Venus Nimphes, of Curtizans, whom folly doth disguise.
               Yea, how, and by what meanes, they doe allure the youth,
               To spend vpon thē all they haue, whose beauty whettes their tooth.
               Who listeth to beholde, and marke my painting penne,
               Shall see their garish trickes set downe, wherby they allure the mē.
               First with their lawnes, and calles of golde beset with spangs,
               With died, and frizeled perewigs, with hartes fro thence that hāgs,
               With veluet cappes, and plumes, they doe adorne their heddes,
               With red &amp; white they painte their face, to tice thē to there beddes.
               There partlets set with spangs, come close vnto their chinne,
               There gorgets fairely wrought without, inclose blacke neck

                   wtin.
               And from their eare there hangs, a pearle and siluer ring,
               As for a bell, the sounde whereof, such like to hir doth bring.
               About hir necke likewise, there hangeth many a chayne,
               Yea, many a costly iem they weare, thats giuē thē of their trayne.
               
                  Their gownes in fashion are, there vardingales are greate,
               Their gownes likewise which are so side, do sweepe alōg ye streate.
               Their pompes most oft are white, their pantables are blacke,
               Their wo
                     ••

                     •
                  w, thus nothing do they lacke.
               Their gloues are all befumde, with pure and perfect smell,
               Yea, all their clothes which smels of muske, loe here she goes they tel.
               Their smockes are all bewrought, about the necke &amp; hande,
               And (to be short) I tell you playne, all things in order stande.
               They onely walke the streates, to see and to be seene,
               Their wāton eyes caste here &amp; there, will tell you what they bene.
               But if hyr flanting lookes, hath trayned any one,
               Unto the mewe wherein she keepes, along as she hath gone,
               They shalbe sure to finde, all kinde of musicke there,
               And she hir selfe (at his request) to play she will not spare.
               Whiche doth inflame his harte, with flashing sparkes of heate,
               To trie with sugred wordes, if so, his harte would cease to beate.
               Then she to passe the time, at cardes will seeke to play,
               Or else 
                     〈◊〉
                   tables will they goe, to driue the time away.
               Then will they vaunt, and graunt, and for affinitie,
               At cardes they will vye, and reuye, each their virginitie.
               At Irishe game she will, contrary to the game,
               At bearing beare more than she should, by proofe I know the same.
               If that she taken be, with this, that hyr foule play,
               Then makes she straight thereof a ieste (I saw it not) to say
               But with this ouersight, she doth prouoke the man,
               To thinke the worste and trie the best, by all the meanes he can.
               Then must she haue such cheare, as may be got for quoyne,
               That by the foode of dayntie dishe, hir woes he might purloyne.
               To spende and make no spare, he must himselfe incline,
               No quoyne, good cheare, aray, nor gemmes, for cost he may define.
               For, giue me, and fetch me, this is their dayly song,
               But yet with this worde Adfer she driues him straight along.
               This worde for to fulfill, he settes on sale his lande,
               And nought he seeth hir wante, but buyth it out of hande.
               His presence doth deserue, remembraunce for to haue,
               
                  But out of sight so out of minde: good will doth presence craue.
               And if she grauntes him grace, to mitigate his woes,
               His handkercher she will bewet, with water of a rose.
               And then such wanton toyes, she wilbe sure to finde,
               That he perswades himselfe herewith, to him she is full kinde.
               Who would requyre more? it full requites his coste.
               And he likewise (as proude thereof) will make thereof his boste.
               Yea, yea, she treades so nice, she would not wafers breake,
               And maulte horse like she beares hir mayne, yt ayre hir armes doth streake.
               Thus as a floting fishe, she glides a long the streete,
               As laūcing ships she cuts ye seas, hir plumes the sayles doth greete.
               But if by candle light, she chaunce hir selfe to showe,
               Hir paynted forme so glistreth, as the starres appearde arowe.
               Such cousining trickes they haue, each man for to deceaue,
               That while they credite giue therto, hir wordes their wits bereaue.
               Wherfore let not thine eye, reduce thy wanton woe,
               Nor giue no credite to their wordes, whiche honie like doe flowe.
               Light wonne, light lost againe, be sure them thus to finde,
               For lightly comen, so lightly gone, this is a harlots kinde.
               Beleue a harlots wordes, and weaue a webbe of woe:
               No credite therefore giue thereto, beleue it is not so.
               She will not sticke to sweare she hath not knowen a man,
               And thou alone hir maydenhed, by filed phrase haste wan.
               And that no man aliue, could euer gayne his will,
               When many an one, yea, evry day, of hir hath had their fill,
               No man hath toucht hir skinne, excepting hande and face,
               Thus will they lie with euery breath, it is their wonted grace.
               Take heede therefore betime, least thou too late repent.
               And curse the time that ere you knewe, thereby what folly mente.
               Beleeue, my wordes are true, by proofe thou shalt them finde,
               Adewe at laste, I wishe thee well, take heede of womenkinde.

            For why? at length, when last of all I fall,
            My winde doth fayle, wherewith I burst my gall.
            My body then, so full as it may be
            With water store, then may each man me see
            All borne alofte, amid the fomyng froth,
            And dryuen to lande, if Neptune waxeth wrothe.
            
               But yet if so I cunnyng haue to swimme,
            When first I fall into the water brimme:
            With streakyng armes and eke with playing feete,
            My parte I play the water flouddes to grete.
            And then perchaunce, some shippe comes sayling 
                  •
               ye,
            Whiche saues my life▪ if me they doe espie.
            Perchaunce likewise I drowne before they come,
            Perchaunce the crampe my feete it maketh numme.
            If so it dothe, then sure I am to die,
            In this distresse the sea will ayde denie.
            Wherefore (I wishe) who well may liue by lande,
            And him forbid the sea to take in hande.

            The description of the loue of a Gentleman and a Gentlevvoman.
            IN the tyme of Lady Ver, the sweete and fragrant smell
            Of each delight, it doth a rangyng foote compell.
            For when the Aprill showers, descende with westerne windes,
            Each hearbe, ech floure, and plante, doe florish in their kindes.
            Each leafe vpon the tree, the grasse vpon the grounde,
            The Hatherne buddes new sprung, on earth what may be founde,
            Doth yeelde as pleasant scentes, as nature can deuise:
            All things in lusty greene, appeares displaying wise.
            And eurye birde that liues, then strayneth forth his voyce:
            So that of each delight, each man may take his choyce.
            Thus in this merry moneth, he tooke delight to vewe,
            Ought that of nature was, most pleasaunt in his hewe.
            Yea, many a tyme and oft, in springs and groues alone,
            
               Himselfe he would apply, as yet where none had gone.
            There in distilling wise, she tooke delight to see,
            The chirpyng birdes full ofte, from bushe to bushe to flee.
            Whose warbling notes him thought, inforced to beleue,
            That nothing vnder Sunne, such merry liues did liue.
            In euery bushe againe, the Primerose did appeere,
            The Uiolet at hande, was prest to be his feere:
            Which cast such fragrant smelles, amid this pleasant spring,
            That eury bushe it did, a newe delight forth bring.
            But walking all alone, in this his whole delight,
            The Primerose as him thought, and Uiolet did fight.
            Wherewith as one amazde, at large he them behelde,
            Hoping at length to see, the one or other yelde.
            But lighting in a vayne, which fortune had not tryed,
            Beholde euen neare at hande, a damsell he espied,
            Whose beauty was so braue, and eke so Christall cleere,
            That nature could not frame, the like to be hyr peere.
            Hir peere I neuer sawe, for beautie in the face,
            The like was neuer seene, such was hir comely grace.
            And where he tooke delight, before in fragrant scente,
            Now hir to gaze vpon, his minde was wholy bente.
            And as good fortune would, he stoode behinde a bushe,
            Where well he might beholde, and neede not starte the thrushe.
            For while she tooke delight, to vewe this pleasant fielde,
            He did obtayne his will, at large he hir behelde.
            And nought she did suspect, for here he lay vnknowne,
            Untill such time as loue, his kindling coles had blowne.
            Hir rounde and cherry lippes, and eke hir skarlet hewe,
            Hir crymson cheekes was cause, the more he did them vewe.
            Hir rosed lookes him thought, his tentiue eares forth folde,
            The more that them he did, the more he should beholde.
            So fell it forth at length, he could not haue his fill,
            The more he did hir vewe, the more he wisht his will.
            When long he vewed had through many a pleasant tune,
            Him thought this Aprill month, was turnde to 
                  •
               oly Iune.
            
               For in hir face him thought, the redde rose and the white,
            In liuely forme did seeme, with other for to fighte.
            The Columbine likewise, whiche commendable is,
            With Dasles did contend, that delectable blisse.
            And as a Marygolde amazde, he hyr behilde,
            Untill hir das
                  •
               ng dentes, his rufull harte it filde.
            Then out alasse he cried, but all it was in vayne,
            His harte fro him was gone, and did with hir remayne.
            This damsell single was, and eke did wante a mate,
            And he to feede hyr reume, did wante a dayntie date.
            But yet his harte was good, and loue did make him 
                  •
               olde,
            He spared not at length, his meanyng to vnfolde.
            For hir he went vnto, and greeted in this wise,
            Alhayle deare dame he sayde, the chiefe of vertues pryse.
            I see that Lady Ver, with sweete and fragrant scente,
            Inflames your harte to see, whereto dame nature lente.
            The Nightingale likewise, with hyr recorded song,
            Hath giuen you this desire, this groue to walke along.
            For now each thing that is, doth florishe in his kinde,
            And is of force (me thinkes) to recreate the minde.
            And eke no greater health, vpon the earth is founde,
            Then early and late to walke, vpon this pleasaunt grounde:
            The scente whereof will so, restore your liuely bloud,
            That you your selfe will say, therefore tis very good.
            A thousande fancies more, for to delight the minde,
            Within this pleasaunt groue, by walking you may finde.
            A floure by chaunce I spie, whose beautie freshe and gay,
            Doth force against my will, what I to you doe say.
            It rauisht hath my wittes, wherefore I craue your ayde,
            Herewith my garlande make, let me not be denayed.
            For you the floure are, wherewith agast I stande,
            And choyce there resteth none, for beautie at your hande.
            With you my harte shall reste, when as my corpse is slayne,
            Take pitie on my woe, take pittie on my payne.
            At which she stoode agast, not knowing what to say,
            
               She soone with loue was prickte, and coulde not say me nay.
            So friendly Venus is, so friendly Cupid was,
            That fancie brought hir soone, vnto my wisshed passe.
            She answered againe, a floure likewise I see,
            Wherein the profe declares, my constant harte to be.
            And where I heretofore, was mo
                  •
               de by many a voyce,
            Yet none my hart coulde gayne, so curious was my choyce.
            The sap now creepeth vp, and vapors do increace,
            Lust doth inforce the fleshe, to warre and not to peace.
            When Ver is in hyr pryme, each one desires a mate:
            And now the thing doth please, whiche I before did hate.
            For earst I did detest, to see a gallant dame,
            But now I take delight, of thee to heare the name.
            And sithe that none before, did please my gazing eye,
            Untill such time I did, your presence here espie.
            So now your loue I craue, my loue for to requite,
            Least cause I haue to curse, the canckred Cupides spight.
            Betake your selfe I say, vnto a trustie friende,
            In me repose such trust, as ye in me shall finde.
            For why, in you I liue, and in my selfe I dye:
            Whiche as a rampire is, your loue agayne to trye.
            My harmes so huge would crie, if it I should not gayne,
            And none aliue I thinke, should suffer the like payne.
            But hope a Castle is, for me to winter in,
            And biddes me not to feare, nor yet my suyte to lin.
            With this she walked home, vnto hir mansion place:
            And all the way he sued, of hir to purchace grace.
            Who fancide him asmuch, as he did fancie hyr,
            Though it she kept vnknowne, as best was thought to hyr.
            The end it tried all, such loue to him she bare,
            He was hir whole delight for him was all hir care.
            His sight it did hir good, his absence bredde anoye,
            His presence was hir meate, hir drinke, and all hir ioye.
            For if he missing were, at most but halfe a day,
            Hir eyes like springs of teares would runne i
                  •
                like 
                  〈◊〉
               .
            
               Or else lyke Xanthus streames, hir tricklyng teares ran downe,
            As salte as brine, and eke hir skalding sighes vnknowne,
            Most ready were sometimes, to ende hir lothsome life,
            Or els in haste she callde for Atropos hir knife.
            Thus nothing was to much for him that was so kynde,
            And yet the more he sought, the lesse his lucke to finde.
            Suche peeuishe lucke had he, in vayne to spende his winde,
            That, looke the more he ranne, the more he came behinde.
            
               Ioue would it so, I thinke, dame fortune beyng coye,
            Delay it daunger bred, and absence bredde anoye.
            Though eyther was most true, and faithfull eke in harte,
            If fortune turne hyr whele, then pleasure is but tarte.
            So quaynte by proofe she was, and to
                  ••
               ing in hir chaunce,
            That where Dame pleasure stoode, she rygor did aduaunce.
            For why? it hapned so, the trumpe of Muse had blowne,
            Unto hir eares, that he far forth was better knowne
            To other than to hir, and eke betrothed had
            His hande, his harte, and faith vnto an other Dame,
            So that she did dispayre, and yet he not in blame.
            But farther it was noysde, that he nought else did seeke
            Of hir, but for to haue his pleasure for a weeke.
            Whiche though it was most false, and blased in despight,
            Yet it hir rauisht had of all hir fore delight.
            For she beleeued straight, how that these wordes were true,
            And in this wise began to rage and eke to rue.
            Haue I long fostred vp, a naughtie soaring Hauke.
            That now forsakes the lure, when I to hir it shake?
            May whistling nought preuayle, needes wilt thou cheeke at fiste,
            Then soare alofte at will, and take thee vp whose list

            In deede thy slicknesse shewed, thou wast a rolling stone,
            Wherefore adewe my ioy, sith needes thou wilt be gone.
            Sithe fortune was so quaynte, and nothing could preuayle,
            With griefe she curste hir hap, and thus began to rayle.
            An other hath my right, and it inioyes perforce,
            The Goddes reuenge it wil, for this thy sought deuorce.

            The beste that now I can, is others to forewarne.

            And learne each one by me, whiche way to frame your loue,
            Be constant, iust and true, as is the turtle Doue.
            But yet beware on whome, ye let your loue to light,

            Let nothing be to deare, if so yee finde him iust.
            Spende not your loue on those, that will it not requite,
            For why? that wante of loue, it can no one delight.

            A Song whiche the Gentlewoman made, before she slevve hir selfe.
            O Cupide, why arte thou to me vnkynde?
            Unequall arte thou in thy raging moode,
            Why didst thou seeke with loue to make me blynde?
            By loue to die, it will doe thee no good,
            Unlesse perchaunce you ioy to see my woe,
            I gaue no cause to finde you such a foe.
            Did 
                  〈◊〉
                offend thy mother any time?
            Whereby she sought on me to wrecke hir spight,
            Did I commit at any time a crime,
            Whiche moued you to put my ioyes to flight?
            If so I haue, then didst thou serue me well,
            If not, me thinkes thy nature is to fell.
            
               Ioue knoweth all, but I doe feele the smarte,
            I haue the wounde whiche breedes my endlesse woe,
            Alas, alas, what meanes that dyrefull darte?
            It makes me loue whome neither may forgoe.
            Alas to late I may repent the time,
            Of my delight, when Ver was in hir pryme.
            For my delight hath giuen this deadly wounde,
            Whiche by no meanes agayne may cured be,
            Alas, alas, loue doth me nowe confounde,
            By parant proofe each man the same may see.
            And none aliue dothe rest to cure the same,
            Thee Cupid now full iustly may I blame.
            And Lady Ver, thou arte my mortall foe,
            
               For thy delights did force my feete to range,
            Thou arte the cause of all this endlesse woe,
            Though Fortune coy she seemed somewhat strange.
            Thus all alike did gyue this mortall wounde,
            And all alike hath sought me to confounde.
            If Lethe lake shoulde yeelde vnto my lore,
            Yet would it want in me his former force.
            It could not be a salue for suche a sore,
            For Cresses iuyce it would his wonte deuorce.
            Wherefore in vayne I crie and looke for ayde,
            For hope it selfe at neede hath me denayde.
            Come Ladies now, put on your mourning weedes,
            Mourne and lament the cause of my distresse,
            Through want of will my harte it dayly bleedes.
            For hope denies to yeelde me ought redresse.
            Mourne and lament each day with dolefull tunes,
            For I am she whome lingring loue consumes.
            What woman will in man repose hir trust,
            And findeth them so oft to be vniust?
            Worse than a beast is he that plights his troth,
            And then for to performe the same is loth:
            But worse is he that giues his faith to one,
            When long before to others it was gone.
            Falser art thou to me than Demophon,
            
            Theseus, Phaon, Aeneas, Iason:
            Falser to me, than euer any wight,
            Who waste my ioy, and eke my whole delight:
            And of my death thy falshoode is in blame,
            Whose bloud shall pay the ransome of the same.
            Come rue therefore with me ye wretched wightes,
            With dolefull tunes approche yee neare at hande,
            Weepe now and wayle forbidding all delightes,
            And pleasures eke at elbow yours to stande.
            For loue it seekes to make me now a tome,
            And loue it will me bryng vnto my dome.

               Alecto, and Tisiphone, Megera: these for feare
            He flattered much, to whome I know such credite did they giue,
            That they him taught with sops to feede (if so he sought to liue)
            The Triceps head of Cerberus the porter of his gate,
            But see within thou stay not long, least forth thou come to late.
            This councell did he keepe ful well, and as they had him tought
            He did, and saw what was his will, he founde eke what he sought.
            But what he foūd that restes vnknowne, but when he came againe
            Unto Thatheniensians, he gan to warne them playne,
            For wanton Lions fostryng vp within the Citie walles,
            Least while they thinke of Melt to feede, they taste of bitter galles,
            Thus likyng breedes extremitie, lulld in affections lappe,
            And looke what others pleaseth moste, therein I finde least sappe.
            Alas what one can 
                  •
               rame himselfe his youthfull race to spende,
            All in Mineruas comely courte? doth not Diana hende
            Sometime vnto Dame pleasures lawes? how then cā I withstād
            The firie force of Cupid
                     •
                  s bowe? doth not dame Venus stande
            At Beauties barre with comly crewes &amp; routes of dayntie dames?
            Whose smiling lookes &amp; prāking toyes, doth cast such fiery flames
            Before my greedy glauncing eyes, that rolleth here and there,
            That I poore soule do rest betrayde, as doth the fearfull hare.
            What shall I do poore sillie sotte? make answere in this cace:
            Where are thy wittes as now become, that arte so wan of face?
            If so they wandring be abrode, then call them home againe,
            A counsell generall to holde it asketh them no payne.
            Therein determine of my life, how I the same shall leade,
            But yet determine of thy selfe that perfite path to treade,
            That leades vnto the perfite ioyes, else thou thy selfe beshrowe
            Mayst soone perchaunce, &amp; vnawares the paine therof shalt know.
            
               Thus beyng set in counsell graue, this counsell did they giue,
            That I my running head to stay, and eke at ease to liue,
            A wife should wedde (oh waylfull woe) what could haue chaunced wurse?
            The wedded man best liues at ease, when fast bounde in his purse
            He hath the tongue of wedded wife, else will she clatter so,
            Bothe to his face and at his backe, that gladde he is to goe
            His way and leaue hyr all alone, for why a shrewishe tongue,
            Is like vnto an Aspen leafe, that nothing vayles to clangue.
            But yet for this they councellde me a wedded wife to take,
            That I the fishe of cōmon sewer might whole and cleane forsake.
            I was content, my wittes did serue, and would me so to doe,
            To wiue I wente, as bootelesse bente, a goslyng for to shoe.
            For looke whose wife in beautie braue, doth passe the middle sorte,
            Each thinkes hir nought, a secrete whore, and giues hir this report.
            But further yet of wiues to speake, thus much I haue to say,
            Whose wife in welth hir mate exceedes, she then wil beare ye sway,
            And treade vpon hir husbandes crowne, as for hir feete to lowe,
            Thou mightst haue beggde, this will she say (if so she be a shrowe)
            If not for me, thou knowest full well, thus will she beare the rule,
            And weare the breeches of hir mate, as wrapt in Friers cule.
            I did deserue a better man than euer thou wilt be,
            Why seekste thou then thy whole affayres or ought to hide fro me?
            Why should not I thy councell be, without restraint of will?
            So ought it be, and so it shall, till pleasure hath his fill.
            Then she disdayning of hir matche, some one will soone procure,
            To pay the boxe, and eke with salue, hir former wounde to cure.
            To Cuckoldes hall she will him sende, as warden for to be,
            With grifted hornes vpon his head, as euery one may see.
            Hir husbandes wealth shall wasted be, vpon hyr bilbowe boyes,
            Thus ouerfayre, and all to riche, doe wante no tedious toyes.
            Then who so wiues, whome beauty wāts, be she ere poore or ritche,
            He will hir lothe, she can not please, she is not for his pitche.
            Thus whiche way can a maried man at this day liue at ease,
            When neyther faire, the foule, nor riche, his fancy fond may please?
            Yet I a merry meane did finde, which is a berry Browne,
            
               Browne and louely (thus they say) she only beares the crowne.
            If so it be (as Goddes it graunt) then am I all to wedde,
            For Browne and louely haue I cought, taccompany me in bedde.
            New married wiues and yong men too, do thinke the day is long,
            Wherein they wedded be, and wishe for wante of other song
            The night were come, &amp; so did I, that Phebus to the west,
            With steedes were drawne on chariot wheles, and there to take his rest.
            His course was done, &amp; Vesper she with Luna playde their partes,
            Whiche pleasde vs well, for ioyes approcht, most meete for louing harts,
            But passing forth this pleasāt night, wt louely tricks I say,
            Alas to soone dan Phebus he did shewe, that it was day.
            And with his radiant glittering beames began for to display,
            It was not meete for louers, yet so timely for to ryse,
            But for to chat an houre or two, this is their wonted guyse:
            And playing thus with wātō toyes, ye Cuckow bad good morow,
            Alas thought I, a token tis, for me to liue in sorrow:
            Cuckow sang he, Cuckow sayd I, what destiny is this?
            Who so it heares, he well may thinke, it is no sacred blisse.
            Alas (quoth she) what cause haue you, as yet thus for to say,
            In Cuckow time few haue a charme, to cause his tongue to stay.
            Wherfore,
            Content your selfe as well as I, let reason rule your minde.
            As Cuckolds come by destiny, so Cuckowes sing by kinde.
            FINIS.
         
         
            The Louer forsaken, bewayleth his chaunce.
            IF euer man had cause to wayle,
            then haue I cause to mourne,
            Who ioyes to see my vowed foe,
            I like and am forlorne.
            
               I serue where no acceptance is
            and haue this seuen yeares space,
            And thryce seuen in yeares I would hir serue
            in hope to purchace grace.
            But all alas it is in vayne,
            I like but to my coste,
            For why the loue I haue bestowed
            I count it is but loste.
            I take delight to vewe that face
            whiche yeeldes my deadly wounde,
            I loue to serue in loyall thrall
            although no thankes are founde.
            O gulfes of care, O dolefull dumpes
            that sore oppresse my harte,
            Why doe yee runne in ragyng wise,
            haue I deserude a parte?
            No no, I see tis bootelesse now
            for me to call or crye,
            For none I see doth rest aliue
            whose ayde I meane to trye.
            Hir breath alone it doth suffise
            to ende my lothsome lyfe,
            For why the Coccatryce tis lyke
            and I deserue no wyfe.
            Sith Fortune quaynte hath graunted so,
            needes must I be content,
            No way there is for to withstande
            the chaunce she hath me sent.
            Sithe tis my hap my ioyes to cease
            dame Pleasure now adewe,
            And dolefull dumpes approch at hande.

            The Louer hearing his Lady to be caste in dumpes, vvriteth vnto hir in this order.
            LAdy, I heare of thy sadde perplexitie, but what shoulde be the cause thereof I know not, yet if Hartes ease may heale thee, the Dasle delectable delight thee, or the pleasant Pinke may please thee, beholde here I graunt thee the keye of my garden, gather them, vse them, and weare them at will: for euen the chiefest flower therin I afforde it thee willingly to furnishe forth thy garland. Leaue off therefore thy mournyng weedes, lette me be thy comforte, who am thine owne for aye. Trie and trust me, vse and weare me, I am thine owne and wilbe while life dothe laste. I wante the Rhetoricall termes of Polymneia to polishe forth my writing, my harte is true, my loue vnfained, wherfore beare with my rudenesse, for great good will dothe grauell me. Inke and paper blusheth not, wherefore if my penne were able, well might I here vnlace my loyaltie: but neyther tongue can tell, harte thinke, nor penne subscrybe the vnfayned loue whiche I beare vnto thee, who onely arte the Castle of my Comforte: wherefore I will omitte the shewyng thereof my selfe, committiing each surmise vnto thy after witte. For bashfulnesse in wryting incountreth with my Muse, and facilitie neglecteth to counteruayle good will. In secrete thought therefore thinke of my loyalty, perpende well my meaning, for constancie it buffeteth a wauering minde: more yours thā mine owne my tried troth shall binde me. Open therefore thy brest and let it shroude twoo faithfull hartes in one. Cupid hath cōmaunded me to be no changelyng, for as I am so will I be. O woulde thou couldest perceyue mine inwarde harte or else conceyue my secrete thought. But time

               Ie vou prie de bon ceur, take this that I owe,
            A verse tis or twayne, wherewith I meane to greete,
            Your mornings firste flight as loue hath thought it meete.
            
               Perliez bien ou perliez rien, you know my minde:
            Nothing will I speake, whiche shall not seeme full kinde.
            As hoarie Hyems froste, keepes backe with pining payne,
            Eache braue delight, till Ver doth shewe hir face agayne:
            Thy goyng so to bedde doth put my ioyes to flight,
            Till mornyng doth appeare, wherefore I hate goodnight.
            
               For as the fallyng sap whiche creepes into the earth,
            Disgrace the trees vntill returne of Ver hir bearth:
            As naked seemes the trees whiche gallant were of hew:
            So naked seemes the house when layde thou arte in mew.
            Thy bedde is lyke thy graue, the earth presents the sheetes:
            The fricking fleas are like, the wormes dead corpse which greetes.
            But when the liuely sap creepes vp in blowing thorne,
            And each delight doth seeme to laugh the frost to scorne:
            As Ver most freshe of hue, sendes forth hir newe delightes,
            With iust returne, and greetes vs all with pleasant sightes:
            So doth Aurora seeme, his giftes for to bes

            For as the spring delights each thing vpon the earth,
            Whiche moueth them to wishe and call vpon hir bearth:
            So doth the morne (me thinkes) vnclose and eke vnbinde,
            Each thing whiche in the night, are closed in their kynde.
            And nothing greeues me more, than when the night drawes on,
            For then I know full well we sunder most anone.
            And then in vayne I wishe the morne for aye remayne,
            That then my pleasure loste I might enioy agayne.
            For in the morne (me thinkes) I see the sap creepes vp,
            Whiche to my will, dothe seeke with ioyes to fill my cup.
            As great is my delight to vewe thy comely face,
            As is the birdes, to see the Lady Ver in place.
            And eury morne by course doth shewe me thee agayne,
            Whereas the night before vs parted hath in twayne.
            The brydegrome in his course doth take no more delight,
            Than I doe dayly take, of thee to haue a sight.
            
               Aue I say therefore, I ioy to see thy face:
            
               Aueto to reply, this poynt I aske of grace:
            For whyle my life doth last, with thee my darte shall rest;
            And for thy sake I will, all other choyce detest.
            For sure it is in time, the brasen walles will starte,
            And eke the water flouddes the craggy rockes will parte.
            In time the watrishe droppes, we see doth perce the stone.
            
               Wherefore I hope to finde, as yet where loue is none.
            This salutation print it within thy brest,
            And (as deserte deserues) therein so let it rest.
            As tyme it trieth troth, so then repose thy trust,
            I craue good will for aye, and not to serue my lust.
         
         
            His good night to the same A. T.
            
            I Brone in griefe my towre of truste
            to set Morpheus mace:
            For needes it will deuide vs bothe
            though for a litle space.
            Yet can it not so litle be,
            though for an howre or twayne,
            But sure me thinkes it is a yeare,
            asunder to remayne.
            For goyng to thy naked bedde
            thou goest to thy graue:
            And euery thing resembleth right
            the course whiche death doth craue.
            Within thy face consistes my ioyes,
            within thy harte my lyfe,
            When death dothe call vpon thy corpse
            then doe I ende my lyfe.
            At night my ioyes beginne to ende,
            bycause we must departe:
            And dolefull dumpes oppresse my minde,
            so lothe I am to starte.
            And when of force departe we must,
            with lingring steppes I goe:
            For why thy sweete abode I wishe
            whose wante doth breede my woe.
            My heauy hart within my corpse
            loth to departe doth daunce:
            
               And in my moning mynde me thinkes
            whole barkes of care doth launce.
            Thy mewe it is a hauen of hope
            whereto I cleaue and holde:
            Holde Cable ropes, and Ancor faste
            for hope dothe make me bolde.
            Sith dryuen by drifte we must departe,
            
               Morpheus thus muche graunt,
            That all the night I dreame on hyr
            whome in the day I haunt.
            And that in liuely forme hyr face

            tyme calleth vs away:
            Against my will we must departe,
            and that without delay.
         
         
            His Farewell to the same.
            A Greater griefe can hardly be,
            Then faythfull friendes for to departe,
            Thy tryed friendship biddes me say,
            That absence thyne will cut my harte.
            Thou arte my gem of all my ioye,
            The Fountayne eke of my delight.
            Thou arte the staffe whereto I leane▪
            
            How might I misse thee fro my sight?
            Though space is great and myles are long
            Whiche seemes to parte our corpse in twayne:
            Yet distaunce shall not parte our loue,
            Our hartes alike shall still remayne.
            O Titus true, O Phenix kynde,
            How lothe am I to bidde farewell?
            It grieues me that suche faithfull friendes
            For aye togither may not dwell.
            Shall we asunder parted be,
            Who thus haue livde in tryed troth?
            If needes we must, then fare you well,
            Yet to departe I am full lothe.
            No greater ioye on earth is founde
            Than faythfull friendes to liue in one.
            No greater griefe can likewise chaunce,
            Than when the one must needes be gone.
            
               Ten thousand times I rather had
            A grisly ghost to ende my lyfe:
            Come Atropos therefore in haste
            On me to vse thy shredding knyfe.
            Come lothsome death with fearefull mace,
            Spare not to worke my latter dome.
            Make haste, make haste, I liue to long,
            Breath yeelded hath, bryng me my tome.
            When thou arte dead, then all the worlde
            With me is gone, thou arte so kynde:
            Who would then willyng let thee goe?
            Suche faithfull friendes are harde to finde.
            My lingring feete no power haue
            Fro thee at all for to departe.
            Eache stone becomes a Mountayne huge
            My feete to stoppe, O faythfull harte.
            Loue it hath made mine eyes so blinde
            I can not see to finde the way.
            No maruell then if so I seeke
            A bad excuse to make delay.
            Eache howre I know will seeme a yeare
            Untill thou doest returne againe.
            Wherefore agaynst my will adewe.
            The want of thee doth breede my payne.
            Returne in haste, omitte no tyme,
            Thy absence spinnes a webbe of woe.
            Lothe to departe come let vs daunce,
            And make no haste away to goe.
            The time and tyde it tarieth none,
            Wherefore this suyte is but in vayne.
            Of force I see away you must,
            But yet make haste to come agayne.
            Adewe, farewell my faithfull friende,
            As deare to me as is my harte.
            Now griefe, now care, now endelesse woe
            
               Drawes on bycause thou must departe,
            But why seeme I thy steppes to stay?
            The longer stay the greater griefe:
            As good at first as at the laste
            Hope of returne will yeelde reliefe.
            No worse to thee than to my selfe,
            Adewe therefore God be thy speede.
            With faythfull harte and moning minde
            I wishe the Lorde to be thy guyde.
            Farewell.
         
      
      
         
            Epilogus.
            THe proude Pecocke (gentle Reader) strouteth and playteth his gorgeous tayle so long, till at the length he discouereth the filthe thereof: so some will thinke, and will not sticke to say, that whyle I indeuour to discouer the imbecillitie of other mens natures, I reueale thereby mine owne licencious liuyng, if so (at the least) I speake by experience. And what if I did? yet are they farre deceyued herein, and doe but dreame (as it were) vpon falshoode it selfe. For the market declareth how the coine is solde: and though I am but yong of yeares, yet may I dayly heare &amp; see that whereof by action I am not partaker. It seemeth also the vanities of this world are the greater, when as they lie so open, and are so manifest vnto my youthfull yeares. And though it hath not pleased Polymneia so to fauour my penne, as to counteruayle my well willing: yet I truste yee will accepte of me for my well meanyng, who am not therein &amp; s
