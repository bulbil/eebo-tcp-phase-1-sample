            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            ANNO. M. D.
XLIX.
         
         
            
            
            To the reader.
            
               APOLIE IT MAYE BE
thought in me to haue spent
tyme in englisshyng of this
boke, entitled the praise of Posie,
wheras the name it selfe
semeth to set foorth no wisedome,
or matter of grauitee:
vnlesse perhappes Erasmus,
the autour therof, delited to
mocke men, in callyng it one
thyng, and meanyng an other. To this I answeare,
that Folie in all poinctꝭ is not (as I take it) so strange
vnto vs, but that hir name maie well be abidden, aslong
as will we or nill we, she will be sure to beare a stroke
in most of our dooyngꝭ: how so euer a certaine secte
of faulte finders condemne all thingꝭ, that fully square
not with theyr owne rules, yea twyse blinde in this,
that amongꝭ the commen errours and infyrmitees of
mortall men, they will beare nothyng with their bretherne,
as who saieth, they were demigoddꝭ, and not
more than one or two waies lynked in Folies bandꝭ.
            I haue therfore bestowed an englisshe liuerey vpon this
latine boke, as well as I coulde: not so muche to please
all men, as rather to shew how euin this Foly toucheth
all men. Wherin I woulde not be noted as a carper of
any man particulerly (for what more vnsittyng than in
bokes or plaies to touche men by name?) nor that herein
I seke to haue any kinde of men noted for theyr trade of
lyfe, otherwyse than the abuse thereof deserueth, but

onely my meanyng is suche, as Erasmus in this booke
shall expresse for vs bothe. He of his modestee is content
to set no great face vpon it, nor woulde be noted to
haue spent great labour in makyng therof: sauyng as
in pastime to haue essaied, whether ought might be spoken
in praise of Folie, wheras wysedome the vertue
can praise it selfe. And therfore he imagineth, that
Folie shoulde be a Goddesse, who before all kyndes of
men assembled as to a sermon, shoulde declare how many
benefites they receiue at hir handꝭ: and how without
hir accesse, nothyng in this life is delectable, commodious,
or tollerable vnto vs, no not our owne life.
            This braue bost myght well come from Folie: and seyng
that wyser men are wont to take in woorth what
is saied by a foole, therfore is Erasmus also the bolder
to put that tale in Folies mouth, whiche vnder an other
person he woulde haue made more curtesie to haue spoken.
So what excuse he maketh the same I requyre
maie serue for me: that thyngꝭ spoken foolisshely, by
Folie, maie be euin so taken, and not wrested to any bitter
sence or ernest applicacion. For surely if the crabbedst
men that be, are wont to take a fooles woordꝭ as
in sporte, for feare lest others myght recken they would
not wynche without a galled backe: Than how muche
more is a domme booke written generally to be borne
withall? namely where the title pretendeth no grauitee,
but rather a toye to stirre laughter, without offence
in the boke, if the reader bringe none offence with hym.
For than truely he maie chaunce to see his owne image
more liuely described than in any peincted table.
            But if that waies he mislike the deformitee of his countrefaicte,

let hym muche more mislyke to be suche one
in deede. And seeyng the vices of our daies are suche
as can not enough be spoken against, what knowe
we, if Erasmus in this booke thought good betweene
game and ernest to rebuke the same? And chiefely to
persuade (if it myght be) a certaine contentacion in euerie
man, to holde hym agreed with suche lotte and
state of liuyng, as ariseth to hym. For whiche purpose
was I also soonest moued to englisshe it, to the end
that meane men of baser wittes and condicion, myght
haue a maner coumfort and satisfaction in theim selfes.
In as muche as the hie
                  ••
                god, who made vs all of one
earth, hath natheles ch
                  •
               en some to rule, and more to
serue. Wherat so muche lacketh that the inferiours
shoulde repine, as rather set in the meaner degree, they
should thanke god the more: without aspyryng to thinges
aboue theyr reache, whiche should draw more trouble
and perilles, than if they absteigned therfro, and
gaue place to others, who had greater giftes of God,
and were called by auctoritee of theyr prince or countrey
to welde the same. For surely, if a man of the
poorer sorte, whose eies is dased in beholdyng the fayre
glosse of wealth and felicitee, whiche the state of a great
lorde or counsailour in a commen wealth dooeth outwardly
represent, did inwardly marke the trauailes,
cares, and anxietees, whiche suche one is driuen to susteigne
(doyng as he ought to dooe) in seruyng his maister
and countrey, wherby he is nothyng lesse than his
owne man: now I beleue he would not muche enuie his
state, nor chose to chaunge condicions of life with hym.
But this were euin the chiefest poincte of wysedome,

though fooles (as Folie calleth theim) that is to saie
vulgare folke, are those, that vnwittyng of their treasure,
dooe in deede enioie this sweete quietnesse, and
greatest good tourne. And waiyng this foolishe 
                  •
               oke,
after this sence, I wene a profite also maie arise therethrough
to the readers, besides the delectacion, beyng so
pithilie pleasaunt as it is. For as Erasmus in all his
woorkes sauoureth of a liuelie quicknesse, and spareth
not sometyme in graue mattiers to sprincle his style,
where he maie suache oportunitee with meerie conceited
sentences: so in this booke, treatyng of suche a
Theme, and vnder suche a person, he openeth all his

                  •
               owget: So farfoorth as by the iudgement of many
learned men, he neuer shewed more arte, nor witte, in any
the grauest boke he wrote, than in this his praise of
Folie. Whiche the reader hauyng any considerance,
shall soone espie, how in euery mattier, yea almost euery
clause, is hidden besides the myrth, some deaper sence
and purpose. In deede I againe saie not, but he maketh
Folie to speake at randon, without sparyng of any
estate of men: but yet indifferent eares will heare their
faultes paciently, as long as they maie chose, whether
they will take the faulte vppon theim or not: or be a
knowne to be those, whom Folie noteth. But euin
this frankenesse of Folies taunting I haue presumed in
some poinctes to ytche to the beste: namely in two or
thre places, whiche the learned reader comparyng with
the latine boke, maie easely perceiue, how either I haue
slipped ouer a line or two, or eased the sowre sence of
the latine with some manerlier englishe worde. Wherin
I chose rather to be counted a skante true interpretour,

than otherwise to touche thynges, whiche were
better vnsaied, as long as it hurted not the grace of the
boke though they were omitted. Likewise in all my
translacion I haue not peined my selfe to render worde
for woorde, nor prouerbe for prouerbe, wherof many
be greke, such as haue no grace in our tounge:
but rather markyng the sence. I applied it
to the phrase of our englishe. And
where the prouerbes woulde take
no englishe, I aduentured to put
englisshe prouerbes of like
waight in their placꝭ,
Whiche maie be
thought by
some
cunnyng translatours a deadly sinne. But
I sticke not for all that, in this foolishe
booke to vse mine owne foolishe
caste. And if it be misliked,
I passe not greatly
though I lose
the praise of
my Folie.

Folie speaketh.
            
               HOwe so euermen
commonly talke of me (as
pardie I am not ignoraunt
what lewde reportes go on
FOLIE, yea euen amongꝭ
those that are veriest fooles
of all) yet that I am
she, I onely (I saie) who
through myne influence do
gladde both the Goddꝭ and
men, by this it maie appeare sufficiently: that as soone
as I came forth to saie my mynd afore this your so notable
assemblie,A fooles presence sterreth laughter. by and by all your lokes began to clere
vp: vnbendyng the frounyng of your browes, &amp; laughyng
vpon me with so merie a countinaunce, as by my
trouth me semeth euin, that all ye (whom I see here
present) doe fare as if ye were well whitled, and thoroughly
moysted with the Nectar wine of the Homericall
Goddꝭ, not without a porcion of the iuyce of that
meruaillous herbe Nepenthes, whiche hath force to put
sadnesse and melancholie from the herte: Where as
before ye satte all heauie, and glommyng, as if ye had
come lately from Trophonius caue, or sainct Patrikes
purgatorie. But lyke as whan Phebus displaieth his
golden bright raies vppon the earth, or whan after a
sharpe stormie wynter, the new primetyde flourissheth
with his caulme sweete Westerne wyndꝭ, than (loe) a
new lykenesse, a newe hewe, and a newe youthe (as it
were) retourneth vnto all thynges: Euen so, as soone

as I appeared, ye all beganne to loke vp lustily. So,
what thyng theis cunnyng Rhetoriciens for all theyr
longe, and forepenned oracions can hardly bringe about
(I meane to driue care, and pensiuenesse out of the hearers
myndes) that haue I with my onely loke, and presence
accomplisshed. And now ye shall wite, to what
eutent at this tyme, in this so straunge an apparell, I
am come foorthe amongꝭ you: vpon condicion ye will
not thinke muche to bestowe on me your eares a while.To trifuls better eare geuen, then to grauer matti
                     •
                  s.
I meane not those eares that ye carie with you to sermons,
but those ye geue to plaiers, to iesters, and to fooles.
Yea those (hardly) wherwith my friende Midas
whilom herkened to the rurall god Pan, in preferryng
his rusticall songe, before Apollos farre fyner Melodie.
For I purpose a season to become a Sophiste, mistake
me not I praie you, as if I saied Sophistrer, suche
as now a daies driue into childers headꝭ, certaine
tangled trifuls, with more than womens stubbournesse
and skoldyng in their disputacions. But I meane the
other, who to the ende they myght shonne that presumptuous
name of Sophi or wysemen, did rather take vpon
them to be called Sophistes: Whose study and profession
it was, to aduaunce, and set foorth in theyr writyngꝭ
the praises bothe of the Goddꝭ, and of men also,
suche as were famous and worthies here in earth. Ye
shall heare therfore the praise set foorth, not of Hercules,
nor yet of Solon, but rather of myne owne selfe,
That is to saie of Folie. In whiche poinct, a strawe
for all these cankerd philosophers, and sages, who saie
it is a moste outragious folie and presumpcion, for one
to praise hym selfe. For truly let them make it as foolisshe

a parte as they lyste, so longe as they can not denie
it to be congruent. And what (I praie you) maie
be more apt or better sittyng, than dame Foly to praise
hir selfe, and be hir owne trumpet? For who can liuelier
descriue me
                  •
                then I my selfe? Unles perhaps some
be better acquainted with me, then I my selfe am. Notwithstandynge,
euen this myselfepraise (as me semeth)
I maie well take vpō me with a more shamefast
grace, than to do as commenly theis great, and learned
men vse, who suborne some glosyng oratour,Oratours and poetes or vayne
spoken poete, hyred also for mede, to dilate and blaste
foorth their praises, or (rightlier to saie) peincted lies.
And yet shall one of those shamefast, maidenly men not
sticke than to d
                  •
               splaie his pecockes fethers, and rowse
hym selfe, whyles suche shameles flaterers dooe goe about
to make him, being a man lesse worth thā naught,
coequall yet vnto the Gods, in blasonnyng hym for a
paragonne, and absolute example of all maner vertues,
from which he knoweth hym selfe to be as farre wyde,
as from hence to the man in the moone. Namely whiles
those glorious glosers woulde decke the crow with
other burds fethers, or peyne theim to washe awaie a
Morions blackenesse, or labour of a sely fly to make an
Elephant. For shorte, I folowe in this poincte the
common prouerbe, whiche saieth, that he maie rightly
praise hym selfe, whom none other bodie will. All be
it to saie the trueth, I can not but meruaile at mens
ingratitude (shuld I call it) or negligence? that where
with one assent they all so frankely dooe obserue me,
and gladly peruse my commoditees, yet hath not one of
theim, now so many reuolucions of yeres passed, vnder

taken with some thankefull oracion to set foorthe the
praises of me Folie, where as some of theym haue
not wanted, who with solemne styles, and muche losse
of slepe and candell, shewed at lest theyr folie, what euer
theyr mattier was, in commendacion, some of this
notable tyranne, some of that, some in praise of the feuer
quartane, others in settyng foorth what commoditees
be in a flie, in baldnesse, or suche lyke hatefull
thyngꝭ. But at my hand, ye shall heare an vnaduised,
and sodeine tale tolde, thoughe so muche perhaps the
truer, Whiche I woulde not ye shoulde thynke were
saied of me for a colour, to aduaunce therby the rypenesse
of my witte, as commonly these learned men do.
Who puttyng foorthe (as ye knowe) some boke more
than whole .xxx. wynters had in cullyng,The vaine glorie of l
                     •
                  arned mē. ye and that
sometymes none of their owne doyng, will sweare yet,
that they made it but for a recreacion of theyr grauer
studies, or rather as fast as penne coulde renne. For
truly it hath euer best lyked me to speake streight what
so euer laie on my tongues ende. But this, to the ende
ye loke not for it, I doe warne ye of afore hande, that
I in no wyse will, accordyng to these common Sophisters
and Rhetoriciens maner, go about to shew by diffinicion
what I am, and muche lesse vse any diuision:
In as muche as I holde bothe the one, and the other
for vnluckie tokens, either to comprehende hir vnder
a certaine ende, or limite, whose influence stretcheth so
vniuersally, orels to diuide hir, in whose obseruaunce
all men dooe so wholy consent. And yet I can not tell
to what purpose it shoulde serue, to represent a certaine
shadow, or image of my selfe, where as presently ye

maie discerne me with your eies. For I am here (as
ye see) the distributrix and dealer of all felicitee, named

                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                in Greeke, in Latine Stultitia, in Englishe
Folie. But aye, what neded me to vtter thus muche?
as if I bare not signes enough in my face, and countinance,
what maner person I am: Or as if some one
contendyng that I were Minerua, or Sophia, myght
not straight with my onely loke be confuted, though I
helde my talke, whiche is no liyng myrrour of the mindes
disposicion. For in me (ye must thynke) is no place
for settyng of colours as I can not saie one thyng, and
thynke an other: but on all sydes I dooe resemble my
selfe.Folie dissembled. So that not so muche as they can dissemble me,
who take vpon theim most semblant of wysedome, and
walke lyke Asses in Lyons skynnes. That althoughe
they counterfeite what they can, yet on some syde their
longe eares pearyng foorth, dooe discouer them to come
of Midas progenie. The vnkyndest kynde of men liuyng,
who beyng in deede the verie standerd bearers of
my bande, woulde seeme yet afore folke to be so ashamed
of my name, as not seldome they cast it in others
teethe for a great reproche. Suche men therfore, that
in deede are archdoltes, and woulde be taken yet for sages
and philosophers, maie I not aptelie calle theim

Vulcane that lymphault smithe was borne, but rather
mixed in loue (as my Homere saieth) whiche I
take to be a copulacion not a little more pleasant than
the other is. Further, to the ende that ye mistake nothyng,
I dooe ye to wite that Plutus begatte me not in
his olde daies, whan he was blynde, and skarce able to
goe for age, and goutinesse, as the poete Aristophanes

in these delites, I beganne not my life with teares, but
straightwaies smyled sweetely on my mother, an euident
argument and token of good lucke as these byrthlotters
saie. Further as concernyng my bringynge
vp, I am not enuious that Iupiter the great god had a

verie well content to reherse theim vnto you. For this
mayde truely, whom ye maie beholde with browes vpcast,
lokyng euer as if she wondred at somethyng, is
called Selfloue. This next hir that fareth as if she flired
vpon you, and clappeth hir handꝭ together, is Adulacion.
This slouggerd, and drowsie head, is named
Obliuion. This than that leaneth on hir elbowes, claspyng

hir handꝭ togethers, is called Lythernes. This
besydes hir with the Rose garlande on hir head, and all
to perfumed with sweete sauours, is cleped voluptuousnes.
This with the rollyng and vnstedfaste eies,
is Madnes. This other with the slicke skinne, and
fayre fedde bodie, is called Delicacie. As for these
two Goddꝭ, whiche ye maie see also in the felowship of
my other traine, the one is named Belichere, the other
Soundslepe. Now if ye aske me, what stede these

of the same, whom shoulde ye thanke for, but me

lyke a plaier must disguise hym selfe into an other personage,
in case he woulde dooe the thyng, that almost

natheles gotes haue also, at least (I saie) laie asyde

his forehead, he must caste awaie those his yronlike

shoulde I not commen more familiarly with you, accordyng

the face? the breast? the handes? or the eares? which
partꝭ of the body are named honest, that engendre gods,
and men? I trow no. Naie, it is euin that selie membre,
so fonde, and foolisshe, as maie not without laughter

That, is the onely fountaine, whens all thynges
receiue life, a great deale sooner than from Pythagoras

how of this my dronken and ridiculous game, are procreate
(omittyng vulgare folke) bothe graue philosophers,

ye haue therin, I dooe not proue theim also
to procede of my goodnesse. For as touchyng this life
here, maie it woorthily be called a life (I praie you) if
ye take pleasure and delight awaie? dooe you nodde
vpon me? well saied: I wyst there was none of you
all so wyse, or rather so foolysshe, naie wyse sooner, as
wolde be of any other opinion. How be it, euen these
sage Stoikes dooe not in deede, so greatly despise pleasure,
as outwardly thei dissemble, and afore folkꝭ doe

baite hir with a thousande repreues, to none other entent

But I wolde thei shulde tell me, what any part of this
life there is, not heauie, not vnpleasant, not vrkesome,
not vnsauourie, vnles ye put Pleasure, that is to saie,
the Saulce of Folie vnto it? for proufe wherof as I could
alleage the sufficient auctoritee of Sophocles, whose
noble sentence in my fauour, is neuer enough praised,
where he saieth, that In knowyng least, the blisfulst lyfe is
ledde. So I am content yet for your better instruction,
to disclose euery thyng more particularly vnto you.
            And fyrst,Infancie, foolisshe. who is he but will confesse Childhode, the
fyrst age of man, to be most gracious and acceptable vnto
all folkꝭ? for els, what is it in younge babes that
we dooe kysse so, we doe colle so, we dooe cherisshe so,
that a verie enemie is moued to spare and succour this
age, vnles it be the allurement of Folie? whiche, natures
circumspection, euin purposedly, hath adioigned
to children, to the ende that with some reputacion of
pleasure, thei might supple the trauaile of theyr bringers
vp, and prouoke the beneuolence of suche as tende
vnto theim. The next age than that succedeth hereto,
I meane Youthe,
               Youthe. how acceptable (I praie you) is it
to all folkꝭ? how is eche enelined to it? how willyngly
dooeth euery wight set it forwarde? how diligently
dooe all men put to theyr healpyng handꝭ: And wherof
(trow ye) procedeth this grace of Youthe, but of me
onely? through whose benefite, a younge man knoweth
least, and therfore taketh least thought. Take me
for a lier, vnles as soone as be waxeth elder, beginnyng

throughe experience and disciplines to sauour of Manhode,
than in continent the floure of his beautie decaieth,
his myrth fadethe, his grace waxeth colde, his
strength diminissheth, so that the farther, and farther
he is retired from me, the lesse, and lesse he liueth, vntill
at last, tedious olde age dooe crepe vpon hym, not onely
vrkesome to others, but hatefull also to him selfe: whiche
Olde age (on my conscience) no mortall man wold
endure to byde out, if I againe takyng compassion at
theyr so great labours and encombrances, did not somwhat
releue the same. That like as these goodꝭ of the
poetes, are wont with some transformacion or likenesse
tournyng, to succour men readie to perisshe, so I also
(that in me lyeth) dooe reuoke suche aged men as are
at deathes dore, and next the pitte, backe againe vnto
childhode? Wherupon, not causeles, folkꝭ call theim
twyse children.
               Returne of olde age to Childhode. Now and if some woulde aske me how
I dooe transforme theim so, I will not hyde so muche
as that from you. For I bringe them to the fountaine
of my mayden Obliuion, called Lethes, whiche springeth
in the Isles fortunate (for as for the other that renneth
through the fieldes Elisiꝭ, is but a small branche
of this former) to the ende that as soone as they there
haue dronken longe forgetfulnesse of thingꝭ passed, thei
maie, by little and little, wasshyng awaie all the troubles
and carefulnesses of the mynde, become chilhisshe
agayne. But some perhaps will obiecte to me, and
saie, that suche olde men dooe dote now, and are paste
theyr wittꝭ. Yea, be as be maie, yet this is euin the
plaine recourse vnto childbode. For is the same ought
els (suppose you) than dotage, or ignorance? is it ought

els in children that deliteth you, than their indiscrecion?
For who is he that wolde not eschew, and abhorre,
no lesse then a monster, a child being endued with manlyke
reason and capacitee? Wherunto accordeth this
common prouerbe, I hate the childe, whose witte ripeneth
before the tyme. Or who wold gladly susteine to haunt,
or kepe company with that olde man, who vnto his so
longe practise, and experience in thyngꝭ, had added also
lyke quicknesse of the mynde, and lyke sharpnesse of
discourse? Conclude therfore, that old age doteth thorough
my benefite, and yet ye see howe these my good
dotardꝭ, shall in the meane whyle rest vacant and discharged
of all suche cares and anxieties, wherwith
wisemen of fressher sprites are wrongen continually, &amp;
in the meane whyle become cherisshers eche of other,Dotage in elde men.

happy, beyng also deare, and welcome to theyr friendꝭ,
amongꝭ other respectꝭ, for this, that commonly they are
verie pleasant in company, and merily bespoken. For
in Homer ye maie reade, howe out of Nestors mouthe
there flowed woordes sweeter than honie, wheras Achilles
langage byted bitter. In Homer also, olde men leaning
ouer Troie walles put foorthe a swetedelyuerid voyce. As to
whiche regarde, theirs maie be preferred before the
verie grace of infancie, whiche sure is muche gracious,
but yet partly disgraced, when it lacketh speache, and

chattyng, that are euin the chiefest recreacions of mans
life. Adde hereto, that olde age ioyeth muche in children,
and children lykewyse will euer bee about oldefolkꝭ.
Suche is nature, in couplyng lyke, and lyke together,
for what other thing is there vnlike betwix them? saue
that Elde, is fuller of wrincles, and noumbreth more
yeeres? Els,
               Olde men like childrē. their white heares, their totheles iawes,
lesse proporcion of theyr bodies, mylklongyng, fumblyng
in the mouthe, chattyng, fondnesse, forgetfulnesse,
rechelousnesse, for briefe, all other condicions be
of one degree, so that the nearer men aproche to olde
age, the nearer retourne thei to the forme of childhode,
till at laste, euin lyke children, no tediousnesse of life,
nor sence of death felt, they depart out of this worlde.

because vplandisshe hobbes in sport are wont at bringyng
home of haruest, to besmere his image sette before

with what iestes the writers of the olde Comedies doe
taunt hym? O fonde God (saie thei) and woorthy who
shoulde issue out of the grine of Iupiter: Yet who woulde
not rather chose, if choise were offred, to bee suche a

foole, and popie as he is, beyng euer merie conceited,

sodaine fraimentꝭ and tumultꝭ, bringeth age ouer all

with his ouerthwarte woordꝭ, to prouoke theim all to
laughter. Than cometh Silenus that horeheadded louer,
treadyng the hornepipe, with Poliphemus boisteously

The Satyres halfe gotes dauncyng the Antikes, And
Pan with his oten flute singyng some rurall songe,

the goddꝭ doe after suche compotacions? thyngꝭ so foolisshe,
as I my selfe can scant refreine from laughter.
It is best therfore that herein I remembre Harpocrares
for his silence, lest some euisdropper god, doe herken
me blabbyng foorth suche thyngꝭ of theim, as not
Momus hym selfe spake euer vnpunisshed. So now
it is tyme, that (folowyng Homers example) I leaue
the goddꝭ aboue, and make returne to the earth, to discusse,
how nothyng here is either gladsome, or desirable,Foly naturall to man kynde.
vnlesse the same begin at me. For fyrst, ye se with
how great prouidence, Nature the foundresse of mankynde
hath forcast, that no where, in any part of mans
lyfe the saulce of Folie shulde be wanted. For if wisedome,
accordyng to the Stoikes diffinicion, is naught els,
than to be ruled by reason: and folie, to be ledde as affection will.
Consider now (I praie you) how muche more Affection,
than Reason, Iupiter hath put in men, to the ende
theyr lyfe shulde not altogethers be heauy, and vnpleasant.
As if ye shoulde compare an ounce to a pounde.
Furthermore, he shutte vp Reason within the narowe
compasse of mans head, leauyng all the rest of the bodie
to affections: settyng also, two most violent tyrannes
against hir, that is to saie, Anger, raignyng in the
fortresse of the hert: and concupiscence, whiche euin
to the lowest part of the bealy, dooeth occupie a large
possession. Against these two so stronge champions,
how muche Reason maie resiste, the commen trade of
mens lyues declareth sufficiently. That wheras Reason,
as muche as lieth in hir, dooeth crie against them,

furiously done repyne at hir, till at last she also, beyng
weried, is faine to yelde for vanquisshed. But in so
muche as to man, borne to gouerne, and rule, Iupiter
thought it meate to distribute Reason somewhat in a
larger assise, to the ende yet he myght partly alaie the
excesse, he called me (as he is wont) amongꝭ the other
goddꝭ to counsaile:Iupiter called Folie to coūsail. and by and by I gaue hym aduise
lyke my selfe, that a woman shoulde be associate vnto
hym.Folie of women. A creature (god knoweth) bothe foolisshe, and
vnwittie, but natheles pleasaunt, and gracious. To
the ende that throughe daiely company, and dwellyng
together, she with hir Folie myght relesse, and make
doulcet the sadnesse of mans courage. For where Plato
semeth to doubte, whether he shoulde putte a woman amongꝭ
reasonable, or vnreasonable creatures, it was no more,
but to shew and expresse the notable Folie of that sexe:
So that if any woman studieth to be counted wyse, she
dooeth naught els but labour to be twyse foolishe, as if
ye wold force a cowe against hir nature to scape through a hoope.
For the fault is doubled, whan so euer one against kind,
woulde counterfaite a glosse of vertue, to writhe the
mynde otherwyse than of nature it plieth. Accordyng
as the greke prouerbe saieth, An ape, is an ape, be she clothed
in purpre, so a woman is a woman (that is to saie) a
foole, what so euer parte she plaie. Yet I thinke not
that women are so verie fooles, to be angrie with me
herefore,What cō
                  moditees women haue by Folie, that I beyng Folie hir selfe, and a woman also,
doe arrect Folie vnto theim. For and if they waie
all thyngꝭ indifferently, they shall soone perceiue, how

muche I am to be thanked, that for many respectꝭ thei
are farre happier, than men be. Fyrst, for theyr beauties
sake, beautie (I saie) whiche not without good
cause is had in so great price by theim, as vnder whose
shielde and protection, they doe exercise tyrannie, yea
ouer tyrannes theim selfꝭ. For els, whence cometh to
men that sternes of their visages, roughnesse of skinne,
and thickenesse of theyr beardes, beyng a verie representacion
of oldnesse, sauyng of the excesse, or rather
disease of wisedome? wheras women with their smoth
chekes, small voices, and fiue skinnes, dooe euer shew
a certaine youthlikenesse. Againe, what is it in this
life that women sooner coueite, than to be belyked of
men? Tende not (trow ye) to this effect, so many their
attyres? so many peinctyngꝭ, so many bathyngꝭ? so
many heare curlyngꝭ, so many glisshes? so many perfumes?
so many waies of nyce simpring, nycer smilyng,
nycest goyng, be it but on an yntch of lether, and
all to sette theim selfes foorth to the shewe? Further,
what greatter priuilege haue women ouer men, than
their foolisshenesse? For what is it, that men permitte
not as leafull, or at least to be borne with, in women?
but vnder what other title, than of delectacion? But
how dooe they delite men, sauyng with their Folie?
This to be true, can not be denied, who so will consider
with hym selfe, what fonde talke and deuises, a
man is faine to fynde out, as often as he entendeth to
take fruicion and pleasure of a woman. And thus I
haue declared you from what springe the first and chiefest
recreacion of this your life is deriued.Foly of fea

some persons there be, namely olde men, rather good

maltwormes, than women haunters, who contrarie to
my supposicion will putte theyr greatest felicitee in tipling,
and good fate. As touchyng whiche poincte, I
referre it to others iudgement if any feast or banket be
made in the right kynde, vnles women are at the same.
But of this I am sure, how without the sauice of Folie,
no banket can be to the somme. In sort that there
want one, who with his owne, or counterfaite Folie,
maie sturre the gestꝭ to laughter, than straight is some
iester, or other madde knaue sent for, with his bald and
foolisshe skoffes, to put awaie the sadde stylnesse of the
feast. For els, what booted so many ionkettꝭ, sweete
meates, and daintries to balace the belie withal, vnles
the eies, the eares, and the whole mind, were also fedde
with laughter, sporte, and merie conceites? But of
all suche knackes I am the onely deuisour, like as this,
that now is solemnely taken vp at bankettes, to chose a
kynge by lottes, to plaie at tables, to bringe good lucke, to quasse
about the bourde, to synge carosses; with suche like obseruances,

throughe myne inuencion, for the conseruacion, and auaile

suche deuises, and ye shall see, that the more folie they
smell of, the more they dooe profite the life of mortall
men. Whiche life, in case it be ouerwaied with sadnesse,

Dialectical quaynt subtiltes, but euiu of the plainest
and bluntest facion, poyncte you to it, as it were
with my finger? Fyrst therfore whan you see a man
flatter, dissemble, or wynke at his friendꝭ faultꝭ, yea,
and sometyme owe fauour, or rather wonder at some
great vices of his, takyng theim for vertues: doe you
not count hym (I praie you) next sybbe to a foole?
            What if an other take some deformitee that his sēman hath,
for a great grace, or a father, whose childe is squynt eied, calleth
hym natheles his pretie pinkeied boie, is not this (trow
ye) plaine folie?Folie the glew of friendship. Let sages crie againe and againe,
that it is folie, yet this same folie is the glew that souldreth,
and interteigneth friendꝭ together. I speake
of mortall men, of whom none lyueth without some
faultꝭ. So that, he maie well be holden for the best,
that is combred with the smallest. Wheras amongꝭ
these Goddꝭ of wysedome, either no friendship can fasten

And friendship is neuer properly knitte, but betweene
men of egall estate and condicion. That admitte

these thingꝭ are doen, and commenly laughed to

All this, and woorthily, is arrected to Folie.

For nature not in few poinctꝭ rather a stepdame

despise what qualitee is theyr owne, and sette more by

that all the giftes, and graces, of this lyfe, are quite
lorne and defaced. For what auaileth beautee? beautie

eloquent speaker, the fowlest stammerer in a countrey,
and for a courtlyke felow, the rudest hobbe that maie
be piked from the plough. So behouable is it (loe)
that euery man dooe clappe hym selfe on the backe, and
with some flattrie be commendable to hym selfe, ere he
can be commended of others. Finally wheras it is the
greattest parte of felicitee, for a man to desyre to bee,
as he is in deede, that dooeth Selfloue procure you by a

his enemies in the face, threw downe his shielde and
tanne awaie, as cowardly a warriour, as he was a
wyse oratour. But Counsaile in warres (saie they) is
of great importaunce, and as for that I sticke not muche,
that counsaile in a capitaine is requisite, so it be warlyke,
and not philosophicall. For commenly thei that
bringe any valiant feate to passe, are good blouddes, venturers,
compaignions, swasshes, dispatchers, bankrowtes, with
suche lyke, and none of these Philosophers candel wasters.
Who how vnmete thei be to serue for any commen affaire,
or purpose amongꝭ men, we maie be taught by
the example of Socrates hym selfe, the onely wiseman,
but vnwysely iudged by Apollos oracle. That wheras
on a tyme he went about to haue saied his minde in
a certaine mattier to the commens of Athenes, he lefte
of sodeinly, beyng all to laught to scorne. How be
it this Socrates, as in one poinct (me semeth) was not
all wyde, in that he wolde not take vpon hym the name
of a wyseman, but rather ascribed the same vnto god
onely, and thought it best for a wyseman not to busie
him selfe or medle with matters of the commen weale,
vnles perhaps he myght haue saied more rightly, that
who so woulde be taken amongꝭ the noumbre of men,
shoulde not medle to muche with wysedome. For I
pray you, what draue Socrates vpon his araignment, to
drinke poyson, for the death he was condempned to, sauyng
onely that his excellent, that his goodly qualitee
of wysedome? Because, whiles whole daies together
he trifled out the tyme, in disputacions vpon the cloudes, vpon
Idees, and by geometrie peyned hym selfe to meate a flies

fecte, discussyng also how a gnatte, beyng so little a vermine,
myght yelde so great a sounde, he neuer applied hym selfe
to learne thyngꝭ perteignyng to this commen trade of
lyfe. But now cometh Plato his disciple to defende
his maister at the barre: a gaie Aduocate (I promyse
you) who beyng offended with the noyse of the people
throungyng about hym, coulde scante make an ende of
the fyrst clause of his tale. And what saie you by
Theophrastus? who takyng vpon hym to speake vnto
a great assemblie,Wysemen dastards, either to fyght, or speake in a prease, as soone as he stode vppe, by and by
coulde saie neuer a woorde, as if he had seen a woulfe at
vnwares: and how shuld he than haue encouraged souldiours
to fight? Or els Isocrates? Who of a certaine
naturall timorousnesse, durst neuer afore audience open
his lippes? Marcus Tullius, the father of Romaine
eloquence, euer with an vnsemely tremblyng began his
oracions, as it were a sobbyng childe, whiche Quintilian
enterpreteth to be the signe of a ware and wyse Oratour,
who pondred well the waightinesse of his mattier. But whan
he saieth so, dooeth he not plainely confesse, wisedome
to be an obstacle against any bolde feate. For what
will suche shrimpys she bodies dooe (trow ye) whan it
cometh to handstrokes, that are almost dead for feare,
whan they striue but with bare woordꝭ? And yet after
all this (on goddꝭ name) is that woorthy sawe of
Plato muche commended, how those commen weales most
happily shoulde flourishe, that were gouerned by philosophers, or
whose gouernours applied them selfes to philosophie. No no, if
ye loke in histories, ye shall fynde, no rulers were euemore
pestilent to a commen weale, than if the same at any
tyme fell into the handꝭ of suche one, as was geuen

to any scet of philosophie. For proufe wherof, I alleage
vnto you the two Catons, thone wherof, with
his headie and frantike accusacions, disturbed greatly
the quiete of Rome citee: the other, in goyng about ouer
wysely to protecte the same, did vtterly subuert it.
And ioigne ye hardly to theim bothe Brutus and Cassius,
with the two Gracchi, yea and Cicero hym selfe,
for as pestilent a citesein amongꝭ the Romains, as Demosthenes
was to the Atheniens commen weale.
            Lykewyse, whattrowye by Marcus Aurelius? I admitte
he was a good emperour, and yet coulde I wrest
that praise also from hym, because his to muche philosophership
made hym odious and hatefull to the people.
But admitte (I saie) he was good, yet truly more
peruicious was he to the commen weale, in leauyng so
vngracious an ympe, as Comodus was, for successour
in his state, than euer he was profitable throughe his
owne good wealdyng of the same.Wisemēs children commenly

or briefely doe ought of those thyngꝭ, without whiche

take hym for a blocke, than a reasonable creature. So

commen opinion, and maners of the other people. Per
consequent wherof,Wysdome bredeth hatred. he must nedes deserue theyr hatred

to iudge indifferently, is there ought doen here amongꝭ
mortall men not full of foly, bothe by fooles, and afore

pithie perswasions, that the myghtie madbeast the communaltee

I haue saied hereby,Foly inuen tresse of sciences. aswell I maie saie by artes and

I goe about to mingle fyre and water. But for all
that I hope to bringe it to passe, if as hitherto you
haue dooen, ye vouchesaue me your eares, and attentiuenesse.
And fyrst of all, if Prudence consisteth in
longe practise and experience of thyngꝭ. vnto whether
of these maie the honour of that name better square?
Either to this wyseman, who partly for shame, and
partly for dastardnesse of herte, attempteth nothyng,
or els that foole, whom neither shame, beyng shameles,
nor petill, beyng reckeles, maie feare from prouyng any
thyng. A wyseman reportꝭ hym selfe to his bokes,
and there learneth naught but mere triflyng distinctions
of woordꝭ. A toole in ieopardyng, and goyng
presently where thyngꝭ are to be knowne,Fooles iudge right lier than wisemen. gathereth
(vnles I am deceiued) the perfect true prudence. Whiche
Homer seemeth, notwithstandyng his blindnesse
to haue seen, whan he saied thus, A foole knoweth the
thyng, that is ones dooen. For there be two stronge lettes
against suche knowlage of thyngꝭ to be gathered,
that is to saie, shame and dreade: shame, that castꝭ a mist
before mens myndꝭ: and dreade, that shewyng the pertiles,

discounsaileth men from ventryng any enterprises.
But I Folie maie, and am wonte to wype those lettes
cleane awaie. Yea, few men consider, how many ways

after the rate, as whan it testeth in iudgement and discourse
of thyngꝭ, herken ye (I praie you) howe farre
they are wyde therof, who dooe make it their chiefest
profession. For fyrst it is not vnknowen, how all humaine

that what outwardly seemed death, yet lokyng within
ye shulde fynde it lyfe: and on the other side what semed
life, to be death: what fayre, to be foule: what
riche, beggerly: what cunnyng, rude: what stronge,
feable: what noble, vile: what gladsome, sadde: what
happie, vnlucky: what friendly, vnfriendly: what
health some, noysome. Briefely the Silene ones beyng
vndone and disclosed, ye shall fynde all thyngꝭ tourned
into a new semblance. If these woordꝭ to some seme
spoken to clerkly, goe to, I will expounde theim more
plainely. I praie you, who is he that confesseth not a
prince to be bothe riche, and a great lorde? but set case
he hath no good qualitees of the mynde, nor with all
those gooddꝭ he hath, can be satisfied: now is he not riche,
but poorst than the poorest. Than againe admit he
begeuin to sundrie vices: now is he no lorde, but more
subiecte than a seruaunt: and after this rate maie ye
skanne also the others. But this is enough for exemple.
Now it maie be, ye muse what I meane hereby,
but geue me leaue yet a little further. If one at

a solemne stage plaie, woulde take vpon hym to plucke
of the plaiers garmentes, whiles they were saiyng
theyr partes, and so disciphre vnto the lokers on, the
true and natiue faces of eche of the plaiers, shoulde he
not (trow ye) marre all the mattier? and well deserue
for a madman to be peltid out of the place with stones?
ye shoulde see yet straightwaies a new transmutacion
in thyngꝭ: that who before plaied the woman, shoulde
than appeare to be a man: who seemed youth, should,
shew his hore heares: who countrefaited the kynge,
shulde tourne to a rascall, and who plaied god almightie,Errour auailyng.
shulde become a cobler as he was before. Yet take
awaie this errour, and as soone take awaie all togethers,
in as muche as the feignyng and counterfaityng
is it, that so delighteth the beholders. So likewise,
all this life of mortall men,This world a stage play of Folie. what is it els, but a certaine
kynde of stage plaie? wheras men come foorthe
disguised one in one arraie, an other in an other, eche
plaiyng his parte, till at last the maker of the plaie, or
bokebearer causeth theim to auoyde the skaffolde, and
yet sometyme maketh one man come in, two or three

all this is dooen vnder a certaine veile or shadow, whiche
taken awaie ones, the plaie can no more be plaied.

basest sort, seyng willyngly he obeith so many, and so vise vices

mourned for his fathers or friendes decease, rather to laughe, and
he merie, because suche diyng to this worlde is the beginnyng of
a better life, wheras this here, is but a maner death as it were.
Furthermore, wolde call an other gloriyng in his armes and aun

discentes disalied from vertue, whiche is the onely roote of true
nobilitee. And in suche lyke sorte woulde raile vpon
all the rest. I praie you, what shulde he preuaile therby,
but make men take him for frantike &amp; distraught?
For surely as nothing can be more foolisshe than wisedome
out of place, so is nothyng more fonde than prudence
out of season. And dooeth he not out of season
(trow ye) that plieth not him selfe as the world goeth?
nor will not take the market as it ryseth? nor at least
remembre the law of quassyng, Other drinke thy drinke,
or rise, and goe thy waie? On the other side, it is a verie
wysemans part to coueite to know nothyng beyond
his bandꝭ, and either as the whole multitude of other
men dooe, to dissemble gladly, or to erre, and be deceiued
with the most. But euin this is Foly (saie thei).
And in good faieth I will not muche denie it, vpon condicion
againe they graunt me, that to dissemble, or erre
so, is the right plaiyng of the pageantꝭ of this life.
            But (Lorde) a thing now is come to my remembrance,
shall I speake it, or kepe it in? and why shulde I kepe
it in, syns it is truer than trueth it selfe? but it is best

Muses in myne ayde, whom poetes call vppon oftentimes

no man can attaine vnto that excellent. Sapience, the
verie castell (as they name it) of felicitee, vnles I Folie
be theyr guide aud leader. Inprimis, I take
it for all readie granted, that all the affections of man,
pertaine vnto Folie. In as muche as philosophers
put this distinction betwene a myseman, and a foole,
that the one is ledde by reason,The dissetence betwene a foole and a wyseman. the other by sensualitee. and
therfore dooe the Stoikes seclude all affections from a
wyseman, as so many diseases of the mynde. But
that notwithstandyng, these affections are not onely
sette in steede of pilottꝭ to suche as woulde recouer the
porte of wysedome, but also in any acte of vertue, are
lyke certaine prickꝭ, or incitacions prouokyng a man to
dooe well. How euer in this poinct the Archestoike
Seneca strongly againsaieth me, who in no wyse will
a wyseman shoulde haue any maner affection in hym,
but whan he taketh that away, he leaueth man, no man,
but rather a newfounde god without bodily sence, such
as neuer was, nor neuer shall be. Yea, to speake plain
               
                  •
               ier,
he dooeth naught els than fourme a stone image of
a man, without fealyng, or any maner inclinacion perteinyng
to a man in deede. Let the Stoikes therfore
(if they list) take theyr wyseman to theim selfes, and
make muche on hym alone, or (if they thynke good) go
and dwell with hym in Platos citee, or in the lande of
Fairie, or Vtopia. For whiche of you woulde not
lothe, and blisse you from the company of suche mance
a man, as were mortified, and benummed in all those sensis and
vnderstandynges, that naturally other men are ledde by? that

had no affections reignyng in him? nor woulde no more bee sterred
with loue, or compassion, than if he were a flint stone? that
in nothyng could euershoote him selfe, but rather lyke Argus see,
and cast all thynges to the vttermost? Forgeue no man? be onely
pleased with hym selfe?

               esteeme him selfe onely to be riche?
onely to be a kynge? onely to be a freeman? briefly, onely all
thynges, but in his owne conceite onely? that cared for no friendes?
friende him selfe to no man? Wolde not sticke to defie the
Gods? and what so euer is dooen of other men in this present life,
to laugh at it and dispise it, as a verie madnesse? Yet suche
a maner quaynt beaste is this complete wyseman of
theirs. I praie you, if the choice went by voyces,
what citee woulde haue suche a gouernour? What armie
suche a capitaine? naie what woman wolde desire
suche an husbande? or who woulde bydde suche a gest
to his house? or what seruaunt pike hym out, or continue
with a maister of so monstruous condicions? On
the other syde, who woulde not sooner preferre any one
chosen euin amonges the thickest of the people? who
beyng a foole, could aptly either gouerne, or obey fooles,
please the myndes of suche as be lyke vnto hym,
whiche is the moste parte, be treatable to his wyfe,
gladly seen of his friendes, mearie in companie, and
lastly woulde thinke nothyng vnbecomyng hym, that
other men vse commenly to dooe. But I wene,
ye be werie now of this theyr wyseman, as I, for my
part, was a good whyle agoe. Let vs passe therfore
ouer to some other mattier. Admitte than, some one,Onely Folie releueth the miseries of this lyfe.
(as the Poetes feigne by Iupiter) shulde out of an high
high place behold and see in how many miseries mans
life is wrapped, how wretched and vile his byrthe is,

how harde his bringyng vp, how weake and pewlyng
his childhode, how trauailsome his youthe, how heauy
his age, and last how feareful his death were. Further,
duryng all his lyfe, what bandꝭ of sickenesses doe
assaile hym, what narow chauncꝭ hange ouer his head,
what displeasures come vpon hym, how in all thyngꝭ
he fyndeth more galle than hony, besydes the miuries
whiche one of you scourgeth an other withall, as pouertee,
enprisonment, worldely shame, rebukyng, rackyng,
gyle, treason, sklaunder, discencion, disceite (but
now I goe about to tell the grauell of the sea) that for what
offencꝭ men deserued suche miseries, or what god beyng
theyr heauie lorde, condemned theim to leade theyr lyues
so pestred and plonged in the same, ye shall perdon
me, from expressing, as not leeful for me at this present
to vtter vnto you. but who so shoulde (I saie) consider
all these thynges accordyngly, myght it not moue
hym to approue the example, and deede of the virgins
of Milesia, be it neuer so piteous to reherse? For ye
shall vnderstande, that willyngly, vppon no apparent
cause why, they all hunge theim selues. But seeyng
we chaunce to speake of voluntarie death, I axe
you, who were those, that for tediousnesse of this life,
did rathest preuent death with theyr owne handes?
            Were thei not suche as bordred nearest vpon wisedome?
amongꝭ whom (to let passe Diogenes, Xenocrates, Cato,
Cassius, Brutus, and suche lyke) Chiron, the wyse
Centaure, hauyng graunt of the goddꝭ, to liue euer (so
lykyng hym) in theyr state of immortalitee, woulde
none of it, but chose rather to die. Ye maie see therfore
what inconuenience shulde ensue, if men were commenly

wise. So that we had nede of a new Prometheus,
a new mowld, and a new earth, to make men of,
vnles I partly through ignorance, partly through vnreckefulnesse,
not seeldome through obliuion of peines
passed, sometyme through hope of better fortune, yea
and now and than sauouryng theyr bittred taste with a
little hony of pleasure, did not in so manyfolde euillꝭ
releue and succour theim. In sort, that lothe they are
to die yet,Olde men desyrous to liue yet. though the fatall spyndell of theyr lyfe beyng
tonne out and expyred, Charons bote hath more
than quarter ebbe taried for their passage hence. So
that how lesse cause they haue, why they shoulde lyue,
yet so muche leefer is life vnto theim, not that they fele
any combraunce of the same. For it procedeth of my
goodnesse (I warrant you) that commenly ye see olde
men, of so hore and tremblyng age, as scant the figure
of a man remaineth vnto theim, beyng bothe fumblers,
dotardes, totheles, griselles, bald, (or rather to descriue them
by Aristophanes termes) Nastie, crokebackt, wrincled, totheshaken,
and lame of their best limme (whiche for womanhode 
                     •

one of theim will die his white heares, and shaue hym
selfe twise a daie: an other will decke his bald crowne
with a peruke: an other sette new tethe in his head, taken
perhaps out of some hoggꝭ chappes: an other fall
in loue with some yonge pygꝭnie, vsyng more fondnesse
in suche kynde of daliaunce than any youngman wold.
For as touchyng suche Deathes dettours, and veraie
Graueporers, as euin at theyr last cast wedde younge
wenches vndowed, but meter to serue other mens turnes
than theyrs, that is a thyng so commenly had in

vse, as in a maner now it is arrected for a great praise
and charitable kyndnesse vnto theim. But this is nothyng,

little lyke theim selues herein, takyng it for a singuler
and onely delight, as if they swamme vp to the chinnes
in a sea of hony, wherin who but I doeth vphold them?
and yet these deinty wisemen for all theyr scornefulnes,
I woulde they shoulde no more but perpend thus with
them selues, whither it be better through suche folie to
lede a sugred life, or elles standyng euer vppon narow
poynctꝭ of wysedome, to seke (as a man woulde saie)
an halter to hange withall? For how so euer suche foolisshe
pranckes are thought to brede an euill name, I
praie you, what mattier is that to my fooles, who eyther
feele not what the inconuenience of an ill report
meaneth, or if thei fele it can so little set by it, and easely
passe it ouer? If a Mylstone fall vpon thy head,
that is an euill in deede; but as for shame, reproche, losse

of reputacion, or euill speche, these maie do the as muche
hurt as thou felist theim: that and if thou felist theim
not, than are they no euils at all. For what hurteth the,
the proples hissing, as longe as thou clappest thy selfe on the backe?
yet who hath the grace to do so vnlesse I Folie do arme
him therto? But now (me thinkꝭ) I haue the philosophers
ones more in my toppe. For that is (saie they)
euin the greattest miserie of all, to be blinded so with Folie, to
erre so, to be deceiued so, to be ignorant so. Naie verilier,
that is it to be a man. And yet I see not why thei shuld
call you miserable therfore, in as muche as ye be borne
so, ye be ordeigned so, and made so, and such is the commen
destiney lotted to euery of you. For nothyng maie
proprely be called miserableMyserable it is not that agreth with Nature. that agreeth with the kind
it cometh of, vnles perchaunce some woulde thynke a
mans nature were to be lamented, because he can not
flie as burdes dooe, nor goe on all foure as other beastes
dooe, nor fence hym with his hornes as bulles doe.
But than by lyke argument, why call they not a faire
horse miserable: because he neuer learned grammer? or
eateth no rostmeate? or els a buile vnhappie, because
he is not shapen to throw the barre? Ergo, as an horse,
who can not his grammer, is not wretched, no more a
man for his Folie is myserable, because it agreeth so
aptly with his nature. But ones againe these cluishe
Sophistrers heaue at me. The knowlage (saie they) of

induceth that wyse Aegyptien kynge to argue,

therfore, sciences came in fyrst, with the residue of the
plages of mans lyfe, and founde out by the verie same
authours, who lykewise are authours of all mischiefe,
that is to saie, by diuelles: wherupon also they haue
their name grounded. for Daemon, signifieth cunnyng,
or a knower. But the good simple people of
the olde golden worlde, without any disciplines at all,
liued onely as Nature taught, and instincted theim.
            For what neded thei any grammer, whan all the world
vsed but one speche? whiche made also to none other
purpose, saue that one myght vnderstande an other?
Or wherto serued Logike, whan no controuersie of
woordes myght make a double meanyng? Or, what
place had Rhetorike, whan none contended with others?
Or to what effect stode Law, seeyng as yet
euill maners reigned not, wherupon good lawes (no
doubt) were fyrst grounded? Further, they were more
religious, and godly, than with an vngodly curiositee
to ensearche the secretꝭ of Nature, the 
                  •
               uantitee of the
sterres, theyr courses, or influences, or the hydden causes
of thyngꝭ, supposyng it against goddꝭ forbode, that
they beyng mortall and erthly men, shoulde struggle to

know beyonde theyr degrees. Muche lesse that euer
any suche madnesse came in theyr braines, as ones to
thynke vpon the inquirey of thyngꝭ set aboue the sterres.
But whan by little and little the purenesse of
the golden age decaced, than were sciencꝭ inuented (as
I saied) by wicked sprites, but right fewe as yet, and
practised by as few. Than afterwardꝭ, the supersticion
of the Chaldees, and idle newfanglednesse of the
Grekes added (I wene) more than six hundred others,
beyng mere vexacions of mens braines, in so muche as
Grammer alone, is hable to kepe a man taske whiles
he liueth. And yet (loe) euin amongꝭ suche sciences,
those we see had in most price, than draw nearest to the
commen sence and capacitee of all men (that is to saie)
to Folie. For as for Diuines, they maie well enough
walke an hungred: Mathematicall professours blowe
theyr nayles: Astronomers are laught to scorne: Sophistrers
are naught set by: Onely a Phisicion (as
Homer saieth) is more woorth than twentie of the rest. Yea
and commenly the rassher, the vncunnynger, &amp; lesse circumspect
the vndertaker of any of those vsuall sciencꝭ
is, the more yet is he regarded &amp; allowed euin amonges
great men also. Lyke as Phisike, accordyng as many
now a daies dooe wrest it, is naught els than a membre
of Adulacion, as well as Rhetorike: Next place
wherunto is geuin to Ciuilians and Lawiers: but I
am in doubt, whether it be the seconde, or the fyrst, by
the rules and 
                  •
               statutes of the vniuerfitee: of whose
profession as I will saie nothyng, so other men are
went with one consent to haue it in derision, as a certaine
kynde of Asselyke philosophie: but yet these

               Asseheades be they, that rule all the rost, and enlarge
their possessions, wheras a Diuine in the meane while
lookyng ouer all his bookes of diuinitee, can hardly
pyke hym out a radisshe roote for his diner, doyng battaile
continually with gnattꝭ and lyse. And therfore
lyke as sciences are the more happie, and auailable, the
nearer affinitee they haue with Folie. So are those
men most happie, who altogethers maie abstaine from
medlyng with any sciences, and folow Nature onely
for theyr guide and maistres, who in no parte of hir is
lame, or insufficient, as longe as it suffiseth vs to kepe
our selues within hir bandꝭ. For Nature abhorreth
counterfeityng,Thynges without arte the morehappely flourish. and farre more towardly doeth it flourisshe,
that with least arte and cure is tended to. For
see you not how amongꝭ brute beastes, and burdes also,
those lyue most wealthily, that haue least to dooe
with disciplines? nor are subiect to any others gouernment,
sauyng Natures? The verie Bees (trow ye)
how happy and merueilous is theyr propretee? and yet
(pardic) they haue not all theyr senses. What housewright
by Geometrie founde euer out suche maner
buildyng, as theyr commes are of? What Philosopher
did euer fourme suche a commen weale as theyrs
is? Contrary, an horse because he draweth nerest
to mans sense, and is conuersant amongꝭ men, is therfore
pertaker also of suche miseries as men are subiecte
to. As who not seeldome, whiles he is ashamed to be
ouer ronne for the belle, dooeth ryre hym selfe, and in
battaile whiles he seketh victorie, dooeth oftentymes
draw his guttꝭ after hym. Besydes the snafles and
bittꝭ, he is broken with, the spurres he is gyrded with,

the stables enprisonment he is hampred with, the whippes
he is lasshed with, the cogillꝭ he is 
                  •
               asted with, the
halters he is tyed with, the ryders he is laden with,
and briefly, all that tragedie of his bondage, whiche
willingly in a maner he toke vpon him (if we geue credite
to Aesopes fables) whiles (as these valiaunt men
dooe) his desyre was to be wroken on the hart his enemie.
Now bow muche leefer is the life of these prettie
small burdꝭ? who onely as Nature pricketh theim,
lyue from hande to mouthe, in depe quietnesse, as long
as men will let theim alone? That and if they fortune
to be taken, and made to syng in a cage, yet (lord)
how muche they want than of theyr natiue grace, and
properuesse? So farre more liuely ye shall fynde it, that rather
nature induceth, than that arte constreigneth. I can neuer
therfore fully commende Pythagoras,
               Pythagoras counted any brute creature to be happier than man. who whan
vnder diuerse bodies and likenesses he had ben all thinges,
a Philosopher, a man, a woman, a kynge, a priuate person,
a fisshe, an horse, a frogge, yea (I wene) a sponge also,
iudged yet no kynde of creature more miserable than
man, because all the reste were content to liue as Nature
had limitted theim. Onely man woulde preasse to
passe his bandꝭ. Yea and therfore amongꝭ men, he
preferred also the Ideote, and simple vulgars, before
other learned and reputed persons. So Grillus (I
thynke) was better aduised, than Vlisses, for all his
deepe witte, in that he had rather grunt still in the stie, beyng
cha
                     •
                  nged into a hogge through Circes sorceries, than waifaryng
with hym, to suffre so many wretched, and greenous chaunces.
In whiche poinct I take it, that Homer also the father of
fables, dooeth consent with me: that where in many

places he calleth all mortall men bothe wofull, and wretched.
and than againe speakyng of Vlisses, the exemple
(as he makes hym) of a perfite wyseman, geueth
hym the addicion of sighyng, or pensiue, whiche in
no place ye fynde attributed to Paris, or Aiax, or Achilles.
But wherfore trow ye dooeth he so? Saue
for that Vlisses beyng double, and craftie, vsed Pallas
aduyse in all his procedyngꝭ, and was ouerwyse, as he
that toke the fa
                  •
               dest drifte he myght from Natures
course. Wherfore lyke as amongꝭ mortall men they
are fardest remoued from blisfulnesse, that geue theim
selues to the studie of wysedome, yea, twyse foolishe
in this, that beyng borne men, they woulde possiblie if
they could, vsurpe the state of the immortall Gods, and
(as poetes feigne the Geantes did) with theyr engins of
sciences moue warre against Nature. So thei on the other
syde seeme least miserable, and wretched, who drawe
nearest to the bluntnesse of brute beastes, and attempte
nothyng beyonde mans degree. For proufe wherof
I will not blinde you with these Stoikes Syllogismes,
but rather induce you by some familiar exemple.
And by the faieth ye owe to the immortall goddꝭ, maie
any thyng to an indifferent considrer be deemed more
happie, and blisfull, than is this kynde of men,Naturall 
                     ••
                  oles the happiest of all men. whom
commenly ye call fooles, doltes, ideotes, and paches? by
most fayre and goodly names as I take theim? Peraduenture
I moue a thyng without purpose, and verie
fonde at the fyrst syght, but ere I haue dooen, ye will
graunt I haue cause to saie it. Seeyng fyrst suche
ideotes are free, and exempt from all feare of death,
whiche feare is no small corrosiue, to a mind that mindeth

it I warrant you. Lyke as they fele not what
a twitching turment it is, to haue a grudged conscience,
and shrinke as little at these old wiues tales of sprites,
of diuellꝭ, of hobgoblyne and the fayries, neither mournyng
to theim selues for feare of euillꝭ and aduersitees
impendyng, nor braggyng ouermuche vpon hope of any
good lucke commyng. To be briefe, they are not
tawed, nor plucht a sunder with a thousande thousand
cares, wherwith other men are oppressed. Thei blushe
at nothyng, they doubt nothyng, they coueite no dignitee,
they enuie 
                  •
               o mans fortune, they loue not peramours:
and lastly if they be veraie brute Naturalles,
now they sinne not, as doctours doe affirme. Here,
I woulde my Maisters of sapience, naie rather Maister
fooles, shoulde repute with theim selues, how on all sydes
theyr myndes are vexed continually. Yea lette
theim but gather to accompt, to what a noumbre of
discommoditees, inconueniences, and difficulties the
state of theyr lyfe is endebted, and so they shall soone
summe vp, from howe many, and howe great euillꝭ I
haue subtraied these my sel
                  •
               e paches. Who not onely
them selues are euer mery, plaiyng, singyng, and laughyng:
but also what euer they dooe, are prouokers of others
lykewyse to pleasure, sport, and laughter, as
who saieth, ordeined herefore by the goddꝭ of theyr be
               
                  •
               euolence,
to recreate the sadnesse of mens lyues.
            That wheras diuerse amongꝭ them selues are diuersly
enclined, yet dooe all men generally with one assent
owe fauour to these poore fooles, coueit them, fede thē,
stroke them embrace them, yea so muche lacketh that auy
wight of reason will do them any great iniurie, as

the verie wildbeastꝭ (experience teacheth) haue been
seen to spare and forbeare from hurtyng of theim, thorough
a certaine naturall sense of theyr innocencie.
            For suche Naturals are holy, and consecrate vnto the
goddꝭ, specially to me: and not without cause therfore
dooe folke so esteme theim. Lyke as many great lordes
there be,Great lordes delite in fooles. who set so muche by theim, as scant they
can eate theyr meate, or byde a minute without theim,
cherisshyng them (by iysse) a little better, than thei are
went to dooe these frounyng philosophers. A few of whiche
sort also for honours sake, and furniture of theyr
courte, they vouchesaue to enterteine. But why they
vse to make more of the other, I thynke it soone gessed,
and ought not to be meruailed at. For these waiwarde
wysemen neuer come foorth but with admonicions,
and boke lessons, yea and throughe confidence of
theyr learnyng, are not sometyme ashamed to saie the
trouth: wheras my fooles supplie a farre more gracious
and acceptable office, to delite men with theyr plaiyng,
daliyng, fonde talke, and deuises. Yea and aboue
all this, haue a meruailous propretee, in that they
onely are plainsaiers, and south speakers. And what
is more laudable (at least as outwardely ye commende
it) than plainesse of speche? For although Alcibiades
prouerbe in Plato ascribeth trouth to children and dronkennes,
yet maie all the praise therof be chiefly appended
to me, as Euripides can well testifie, who wrote
thus: A foole speaketh like a foole (id est) plainely. For
what soeuer he hath in his thought, that sheweth he also
in his countinaunce, and expresseth it in his talke.
            Wheras these wisemen are thei, that ar double tounged,
               
as the aforesaied Euripides telleth vs, with the one of
whiche they speake the trueth, with the other, thyngꝭ
mete for the tyme and audience. Theyr propretee it
is to chaunge blacke into white, and out of one mouthe
to blow bothe hote and colde: and thynke vnhappeliest
in their hertꝭ, whan they speake smotheliest with their
toungꝭ. How be it me seemeth that princꝭ, how euer
the haboundant felicitee of theyr estate is wont to

                  •
               ase meane folkꝭ etes, maie yet as to this respecte be
counted right miserable, because they want, of whom
to here the trouthe, and are faiue therefore to take
flattrers for their friendꝭ. But some will saie, trouth
maie not at all tymes be spoken, and therfore are these
wysemen so eschewed, because without respecte they
speake frankly. Now so it is in deede, trueth (for
the most part) is hatefull to princꝭ. And yet we see,
that of fooles oftetymes,True talke of fooles vnpunished. not onely true tales, but euin
open rebukes are with pleasure declared. That
what woorde comyng out of a wisemans mouthe were
an hangyng mattier, the same yet spoken by a foole
shall muche delight euin hym that is touched therwith.
Suche a liuely grace to content men hath veritee, as
longe as it be mixed with naught els that maie offende.
But without offence to dooe the same the goddꝭ haue
graunted to fooles onely.Women delite in fooles. And so in a maner vppon
lyke causes, haue women lyke pleasure in theim, in as
muche as naturally the Feminine Sexe is bended all to
pleasure, and trifles. That what so euer they do with
these fooles, although sometyme (maie chaunce) it be
past sporte, yet haue they the easie to expounde it to be
nothyng but a plaiyng toy, or a thing to make daliance,

as euer women be redie witted to tourne and excuse the
mattier. But now to retourne to my purpose, my Ideotes
hauyng thus ledde foorth theyr tyme, in muche
triumphe, and solace, at last without any feare or sense
of death, dooe passe hence the right waie to paradise,
there also to disporte theyr quiet and innocent soules in
continuall plaie. Now goe to if ye list, and conferre
any wyseman of theym all, with these my symple,
and least regarded fooles, as touchyng theyr state of
blisfulnesse. Or rather let vs draw on the other side,
for a comparison betwixe theim, the extract of a man
of wisedome. For exemples sake, a caitiue (so I maie
call hym) that hath worne out all his childhode,The image of an absolute wiseman. and
youthfull yeres in learnyng of disciplines, hauyng lost
so the swetest part of his life in continuall watches, cares,
and trauailes, nor in all the residew that euer tasted
one dramme of pleasure, beyng euer niggardly, euer
poore, melancholike, and frounyng: as harde and
wrongfull to hym selfe, as insupportable and odious
to others, pale, meigre, sikely, and blereyed, wasted awaie
with elde, and horenes, whiche his owne wilfull
studie auaunced to him before his tyme: yea and before
his tyme postyng (as it were) out of life, although it
skilleth not how soone he dieth, who neuer yet liued.
            And this (loe) is that goodly image of theyr wyseman.
But ones againe these Philosophers, or verelier (Soike
frogges dooe crocke at me), For nothyng (saie thei) is
more miserable than madnesse: but a notable folie is nexte sybbe
vnto madnesse, or ratber madnesse it selfe. For what is madnesse
els, sauyng a generall errour and abusion of the mynde?
            
            Tusshe, tusshe, these calues are euer in a wronge boxe:

but let vs proue yet, by the Muses leaue, how we can
refelle this Syllogisme of theyrs, whiche (in deede)
thei haue subtilly knit togethers, but as in Plato, Socrates
teacheth vs, to deuide one venus into two, and one
Cupide, into two Cupides. So lykewise these Logiciens,
if they had dooen right, shulde haue deuided or distingued
one kinde of madnesse from an other. In as muche
as euery madnesse,Euery errour of the mynde is not madnesse. is not straight therfore miserable.
For than Horace wolde not haue saied, Is it not a
swete, and pleasaunt madnesse that deceiueth me? Nor Plato
likewyse woulde haue put the rauyng of poetes, prophetes, and
louers, amonges the principall weales, and benefites of this life.
Nor yet the prophetesse in Virgise woulde haue called the longe
wandryng, and peregrinacion of Aeneas, a madde labour. But
ye must vnderstande, that there be two kyndes of madnesse.Two kyndes of madnesse.
One is that rage, whiche the Furies of hell,
beyng punisshers of the wicked, doe bringe with them,
as often as thei graffe, and fasten in the mindꝭ of mortall
men, either feruente desyre of an vniust reuengement,
or vnsaciate couetousnesse of golde, or cursed and
vnleefull loue, or parent slaughter, or treason, with suche
other plages sent by the iust iudgement of the gods,
for the punisshyng of misdooers. Or whan those Furies
do trouble, and vexe the giltie conscience of a man,
with the pricke of dredefull furiousnesse. But there
is an other kynde of madnesse, farre vnlike the former,
whiche procedeth from me wholy, and most is to be embraced.
As often as a certaine pleasant rauing, or errour
of the mynde, deliuereth the herte of that man,
whom it possesseth, from all wonted carefulnesse, &amp; rendreth
it dyuers waies, muche recreated with new delectacion.

Now this saied Errour of the mynde, as
a speciall iewel, and benefite of the goddꝭ, was wisshed
after, euin of Cicero hym selfe, in a certaine epistle he
wrote to Atticus, to the ende he might haue no sense, nor vnderstandyng
of so great euils, as at those daies oppressed his countrey.
Lykewyse Argiuus, he whom Horace writeth
of, iudged not muche amysse. Who this far
                  •
               oorth raued,
that whole daies togethers he woulde sitte alone
in the Theatre (a place where the commen plaies were
plaied) laughyng, and clappyng his handes, and reioysyng
muche to hym selfe, because hym seemed verily
that some excellent Tragedies were in plaiyng there,
wheras in deede he sawe nothyng at all. Whan yet
for all that as to other respectꝭ, he behaued hym selfe
wysely enough, beyng welbeloued of his friendꝭ, gentill
to his wyfe, and easie to his seruantꝭ, without fallyng
in any rage with theim, whan he founde a backe
faulset set in his wyne vessell. Now whan his kinsfolkes
procurement, geuyng hym medecines therfore,
had healed his disease, and restored hym to his former
wittes, marke ye, how he fell out with theim, in blamyng
their thanklesse and double diligence. Ye haue
slaine, and not saued me; ô my friendes (quod he) in wrestyng
my pleasure from me in this sort, and by force bereuyn gme suche
a most delectable errour of my mynde. And well mought
thou saie it (good Argiue). For it was thei that raued,
and had more nede than thou of Elleborus to purge
theim, who toke in hand to driue and expell out of the,
so pleasaunt, and happie a madnesse, in stede of a great
disease, as thei toke it. How be it, I am in doubte
yet, whether euery Errour of the mynde and senses,

deserueth to bee called madnesse.Euery errour is not madnesse. For if one that is

                  •
               andblynde woulde take an asse, for a moyle, or an other
praise a rime of Robyn hode, for as excellent a makyng,
as Troilus of Chaucer, yet shoulde they not straightwaies
be counted madde therfore. But he that not
onely erreth in his senses, but is deceiued also in iudgement
of the mynde, and that extraordinarely, and of
custome, he (I saie) maie well be bolden madde, and
out of his right mynde. As if some man so often as he
heard an asse rore, did perswade hym selfe, he heard
meruailous chauntyng of the Chapell: or a poore cai
               
                  •
               iue
borne of beggers, beleued he were Cresus the rich
kynge of Lidia. And yet, cum this platte kynde of
madnesse, so it tende (as for the most part it dooeth) vnto
pleasure, than bringeth it no small delectacion, as
well to theim that are deteined therwith, as those also
that perceiue it to be in others, hauyng theim selues no
espece therof. For this maner madnesse is largelier
sprede abrode, thau most folke wene it is. But in the
meane while one madde man mocketh an other, and not
seeldome you shall see the more madman, the lowdelier
laugh the lesse to scorne. Yet for all that, so muche is
eche of theim the more happie,No ma

he is deceiued, so in his owne foolisshe iudgement, as
long as he continueth still in that kind of madnesse, that
is peculier to me, whiche surely is so largely deuided,
as I doubt whether of the whole multitude of mortall

                  •
               n, ye can pyke me out one onely, who at all tymes
maie auant him selfe to do wisely, and not to be grudged
with some spece of madnesse. Albeit this is the difference,
that who so seeth a Goorde, and beleueth it is

a woman, hym doe men geue the name of a madde man,
because few are accustomed to erre so outtakyngly.
            But whan we see an husbande take his wyfe, in whom
he hath many Coparteners, to be chaster yet than euer
was Penelope, muche reioysyng in his good happe,
but right happely mistakyng the mattier, hym nowe
dooeth no man call madde, because that maried men are
commenly disposed to suche diseases.Folie of hunters. Muche after
whiche rate do such folkes also raue pleasantly, as preferre
huntyng before all other pastimes, protesting what
an incredible pleasure thei cōceiue, so often as thei here
that foule musike, which a horne maketh, beyng touted
in, or the howlyng of a meny of doggꝭ. yea I thynke
the verie stenche of the houndes kenuell, senteth muske
vnto theyr noses. For as touchyng the death of a
deare, or other wilde beast, ye know your selues, what
ceremonies they vse about the same. Euery poore man
maie cutte out an oxe, or a shepe, wheras suche benaison
maie not be dismembred but of a gentilman: who
bareheadded, and set on knees, with a knife prepared
proprely to that vse, (for euery kynde of knife is not
allowable) also with certaine iestures, cuttes a sunder
certaine partes of the wildbeast, in a certaine order verie
circumstantly. Whiche duryng, the standers by,
not speakyng a worde, behold it solemnly, as if it were
some holy Misterie, hauyng seen the like yet more than
a hundred tymes before. Than (sir) whose happe it
be to eate parte of the flesshe, marie he thynkes verily
to be made therby halfe a gentilman. So therfore
wheras these hunters through continuall chasyng and
catyng of theyr venerie, gaine nothyng, but in a maner

dooe them selfes also degenerate into wilde and saluage
propretees, ye maie see yet, how through this errour of
mine, thei repute theyr lyues ledde in more than princely
pleasure. And lykewyse, are not they most madly,
but natheles pleasantly occupied,Builders. that wholy sette
theyr study on buildyng? to set vp, and plucke downe
againe, now square, now rounde, now of this cast, now
of that, neuer makyng ende, till brought at last therby
to extreme pouertee, they haue not so muche lefte them
as a cotage, where to put in theyr headꝭ, nor one crosse
of comfort, to bie theim breadde withall. But what
therof? forsouth a few yeres haue they spent yet, in
great wanhope, and pleasure. Not farre vnlyke these
Alcumistes, or multipliers,Multipliers, who by theyr newfound secrete
science, go about to chaunge metall into metall,
serchyng bothe by sea and by lande, a certaine Quintessence.
These men are so enticed by an hope they
haue to bringe theyr feate to passe, as neither labour,
nor cost maie withdraw theim from the same, but wittily
euer they dooe deuise some new thyng, wherwith to
begyle theim selues againe, till at last, hauyng spent all
they could make, there remaineth not to theim so muche
siluer, as wherwith to bie bechen coles for their
fornace. Natheles they leaue not to dreame still of
wonderous pleasant inuencions, encourageyng others,
as muche as in theim lieth, to the same trade of felicitee.
That whan at last all hope forsaketh theim, yet
haue they this prouerbe in theyr mouthes, in steede of a
great comfort and recompence, Saiyng, how in hiegh enterprises,
euin the good wyll alone is sufficient. And than
(loe) in theyr excuse, accuse they the shortnesse of mans

life, whiche suffiseth not for the great waight of so
depe a cunnyng to be fully serched out. Moreouer
these dyse plaiers,Dyse plaiers, though I doubt whether theyr madnesse
be foolisshe, or furious, yet surely it is a foolissh,
and ridiculous sight, to beholde many of theim so geuin
to the plaie, that as soone as they but here ones the
sounde of the dysespringyng vpon the boorde. (Lorde)
how by and by theyr hertes beginne to lepe and throbbe
in theyr belies. Further, through a certaine suckling
hope of gaine, hauyng made shipwrcke of all theyr
goodꝭ, whan theyr shippe strikes vpon the Dyserocke,
(a daunger farre more perilous, than is the race of Britaine)
theim selues hardely escaryng in theyr hose and
theyr doubletꝭ, yet sooner will they begyle theyr owne
brother, than hym that nycked theim of theyr money,
lest els perchaunce they might be counted foule gamesters.
Yea, and beyng olde now, and almost blinde,
yet plaie they still with glasen eres: and lastly hauyng
theyr fyngers so knobbed with the goute, as rendreth
them impotent, yet hyre thei some other to cast the dyse
for them. In whiche kinde of madnesse (I wen
                  •
               ) thei
myght passe theyr tymes right pleasantly, if it did not
for the most part burst into a rage, and so pertaine rather
to the Furies of hell, than to me. But those men
(no question) are wholy of my retinew, that put theyr
sole delyte in tellyng or hearyng of these feigned miracles,lnuentors of old wyues tales and feigned miracles, or
verilier monstrous lies, beyng neuer satisfied
therwith, as whan they feigne certaine terrible tales of
gostes, sprites, fairies, and dinels, with thousande suche
other old wyues inuencions, whiche the further thei
sounde from trueth, are the gladlier beleued, and more

pleasantly dooe fede mens eares. For surely suche
fables are not onely doulcet to passe the tyme withall,
but gainfull also to theyr practisers, suche as perdoners
and limittours be. Than againe next neyghbours to these,
are suche as haue a foolisshe, but yet a pleasant perswasion
to theim selues, that what daie thei see a woodden
or a peincted image of the geant saincte Christopher,
no nuschaunce shall betide theim. Or if thei grete the
grauen image of saincte Barbara, with some praier prescribed
for that vse, they can not but retourne hurtelesse
from the warres. Or if vpon the sondaies they
woorship saincte Erasmus, with certaine tapers and
Paternosters, thei shall in short space become riche men.
For what speake I of others, who with feigned Perdones,
               Perdones,
and remissions of sinnes dooe pleasantly flattre
theim selues, takyng vpon theim to measure the space
and continuance of soules abode in Purgatorie, as it
were by houreglasses, settyng out, bothe the yeres, the
monthes, the d
                  ••
               es, the houres, and the lest minutes,
without missyng, as if they had cast it by Algrysme?
Or what of those, that vnder confidence of certaine
Magike praiers, and charmelyke Rosaries,
               Rosar
                     •
                  es, whiche
some deuoute deceiuour inuented fyrste, either for his
pleasure, or his profyte, dooe promyse theim selues all
gladde thyngꝭ, richesse, honour, pleasure, good fare,
longe health, lenger life, greene age, yea, and the next
seate in heauen to ged almightie, whiche seate yet by
theyr willes thei wolde not possesse to timely, I meane,
that whan the pleasures of this life haue lefte theim
muche against theyr willes, yea holdyng theim backe
as it were by the teeth, than are thei at last content, to

haue those heauenly ioies succede in the others places.
And here now I maie bringe in the foolisshe wanhope
(imagine we) of some vsurer, or man of warre, or corrupte
iudge, who castyng foorth one halfpenie of all his
euill gotten goodꝭ, will straight thynke that the whole
hoorde of his former mislife, is at ones forgeuin hym,
and that his periuries, his lecheries, his drunkennesses,
braulyngꝭ, deceitꝭ, trumperies, and treasons, whiche
infinitely he by all his life committed, are therby
as vpon a Quitꝭ est redeemed, yea and so redeemed, as
it maie be leefull for hym, therupon to retourne a freshe
to a new worlde of vices. Further, how foolisshe,
naie rather how happie are those good soules? whiche
in saiyng daily the .vii. verses pyked out of the whole
Psaltier, beleeue they can not mysse of too too great a
good tourne at goddꝭ handes? Whiche verses (it is
saied) Sainct Bernard learned fyrst of a certaine mery
conceited diuell, yet lenger tounged, than craftie, for
the poore wretche let Sainct Bernard begyle hym. But
as for the verses, beyng in deede so balde, and nothyng
correspondent to the braue title they beare, as welnere
I my selfe am ashamed of theim, yet are they allowed,
not onely of the people, but also of my great presidentes
of religion. Moreouer,Supersticious worshipping of sainctes, sauoureth it not of the same
saulce (trow ye) whan euerie countrey chalengeth a
seuerall sainct for theyr patrone, assignyng further to
eche sainct a peculier cure and office, with also sundrie
waies of woorshippynge? as, this sainct helpeth for the
totheache: that socoureth in childbyrth: she restoreth stolne goodꝭ:
an other aydeth shipmen in tempestes: an other taketh charge of
husband mens hogges: and so of the rest: for to longe were

it to reherse all. Than some sainctꝭ there be, that are
generally sued to for many thynges: amongꝭ whom
chiefely is the virgin mother of god: in whom vulgar
folke haue an especiall confidence, yea almost more thā
in hir sonne.Uulgar folke praie not to sainctes for wysedome. But what is it (I praie you) that men
make peticion for vnto these sainctꝭ? sauyng for thynges
perteinyng rather to Folie, than ought els? Or amongꝭ
so many peincted tables, images of waxe, and
other offringꝭ, wherwith all the walles, and roofes of
some pylgrimage chapels are decked, in token of daungers
escaped, sawe ye euer any man yet escape folie, or
made one heare the wyser? Some one (perchaunce) was
saued from drowning: an other striken through with a pot gonne,
recouered: an other, whiles bothe partes were together by the
eares, no lesse happely, than manfully, fledde from the battaile:
an other, beyng hanged on the galowes, through the fauour of
some sainct, good maister to thenes, brake the haulter and ranne
his waie, to the ende he myght ones more helpe to discharge
suche, as are ouercharged with theyr money
baggꝭ: An other, breakyng prison escaped: An other in spyte
of the phisicion waxed whole of his longe botched sickenesse:
An other, that dranke two sortes of poyson at ones, through the
conflict of theyr contrarie operacions, beyng driuen into a laxe,
founde theim rather medicinable, than deadly, vnto hym, full
sore against his wiues will, who lost bother hir labour and cost about
it: An other, whan his carte ouertourned, brought his horses
home in sauetie: An other, beyng passhed with the fall of an
house, lost not (thankes be to the sainct) his life: An other,
founde a bedde with a mans wyfe, had the grace yet to shifte
from hir husbande. But none of all these (I warrant
you) yeldeth thankꝭ for his folie laied asyde. So

sweete a thyng is it, to be cumbred with no wysedome,
as men had rather axe perdone of any other thyng, than
that. But how am I entred thus farre, into this
Sea of supersticions? That if I had an hundred tounges, as many
mouthes, and a voyce therto of yron, yet coulde I neuer des

                  iue
halfe the kyndes of fooles, nor recken vp halfe the names of
theyr folies. So swarmeth on all sydes the life of christen
men, with this blindnesse: whiche natheles priestes
not onely dooe admitte gladly, but also set it forwardꝭ,
because they know well enough on whiche side
theyr breade is buttred. But now, if some one
of these cumbrous wysemen shoulde ryse vp, and saie
(and saie truely) thou shalt neuer die ill, as longe as thou liuest
well: Thou redeemest thy synnes, in case to one halfpennie
geuin to the poore, thou addest repentaunce of thy misdeedes, together
with teares, praier, and fastyng: and changest all the trade
of thy syfe: this sainct will helpe the, if thou liuest as he did.
These aduertisementes, and suche semblable, if this
wyseman (I saie) shoulde barke vnto the people: See
than straight from howe sweete a felicitee, into howe
great a trouble and confusion, he shoulde plucke backe
the myndes of mortall men. To this college doe thei
also pertaine,Funerall

                  ompes. who by theyr liue daies, dooe seriously
enacte, with what pompe and ordre they woulde be buried.
So farfoorth as by tale also they expresse the
noumbre of the torches, tapers, mourners, priestes, and
orders of friers to synge at theyr funerallꝭ: And than,
how many hyred for money must lament and howle for
theim. As who saieth, any maner sense of this spectacle
shoulde redounde vnto the deade. Or as if they,
shoulde blusshe and be ashamed, vnles the corps were

woorshipfully enterred, with none other desyre in this
poyncte, than if beyng made maiors or sheriues they
shoulde ordeine a midsomer syght. And truely, make
I neuer so muche haste, yet I can not passe ouer in silence
those pecockes, whiche in deede are nothyng different
from the poorest coblers that clowte shoone, and
yet vnder a vaine title of nobilitee doe wondersly stand
in theyr owne conceites. One of theim bringꝭ his petigrew
from Aeneas, an other from Brutus, an other
from Arthur: They shew the grauen and peincted armes
of theyr auncestours: they speake of theyr graundfathers,
great graundfathers, belgraundfathers, and great belgraundfathers,
wheras they theim selues stand lyke blockes,
in a maner lesse worth, than those peincted signes,
whiche they glorie in. And yet, through this sweete
perswasion of Selflykyng, they leade a golden life:
namely since suche there want not, as verie fooles as
the other, that haue these kynde of calues in veneracion,
as if they were goddꝭ. But what speake I now
of one, or two exemples? as though this Selflykyng
made not most men, manifoldly, by wonderous meanes,
most happie in theyr owne opinion: as whan one fowler
than any marmoset,Euery wight lyketh beste hym selfe. thynkꝭ hym selfe to be goodlier
than Absalon. Or some other, as soone as he can
draw three lynes with a compasse, takes hym selfe to be
as good in Geometrie as euer was Euclides. An other
lyke an asse to the harpe, though he syng no better
than a Gynee cocke, weneth yet to be Hermogenes,
that excellent musicien. Than againe, this (no faile)
is a sweete kynde of madnesse, whiche we see in diue
                  •
               s
fooles, who what euer qualitee theyr friendes, or seruauntes

haue, dooe glorie as muche therin, as if they
coulde dooe it theim selues. Not muche vnlike that
wealthie richeman, whom Seneke writeth of, Who
takyng vpon hym to tell a tale, had euer his seruauntꝭ
at hand to prompt him where he missed: and beyng him
selfe so feble, as scantly he coulde stande on his leggꝭ,
woulde not feare yet vpon confidence of so many poudredbefe
lubbers, as he fedde at home, to make a mache
with any man at footeball. Furthermore I thynke
in nedelesse for me,Graduates of artes. to touche any whit these graduates
of artes, and sciences. Seyng that Self loue is altogethers
so muche theyr alie, as any of theim will sooner
be driuen from the enheritance his father lefte him,
than geue place in cunnyng to any others: but chiefely
these Syngyng men, Sophistrers, Rhetoriciens, and poetes
dooe excell therin: amongꝭ whom, the vncunnynger,
the more lyketh hym selfe, and the franklier bosteth
what he can dooe. And lyke setuce, lyke lippes: for the
balder the thing be, the more are men wont to be in loue
with it: as commenly the woorst thyngꝭ are best fantesied,
because (as afore I saied) the most parte of men
are subiecte vnto Folie. And therfore, if so be that a
man the vncunnynger he is, the deeper yet standeth in
his owne conceite, and is of moste men the more accepted,
now I see not to what entent he shoulde rather
coueite the true and perfite knowlage of the thyng
that he professeth, whiche fyrst shoulde cost hym longe
labour and expence before he atteine it, and beyng ones
had, should make hym the lesse vnderstanded, the more
fearefull to misse in vttryng of it, and lastly commended
of a farre fewer noumbre, because most mens rudenesse

can not reche to the fines of the same. Moreouer,
wee see how nature as in singular men,The commen self likyng of eche Nacion. so also in eche
Nacion, and almost in eche citee, hath graffed a certaine
commen selflikyng. And so it commes to passe, that
Englisshemen peculierly before all other thyngꝭ, dooe
vindicate vnto theim faire shape of the bodie, musike,
and well farsed tables. Scottes, dooe bost theim selues
in theyr nobilitee, and nerenesse of bloudde to their
prince, not a little also flattryng theim selues in theyr
Duns doctrine. Frenchemen, woulde be counted ciuile,
and curteis of maners. Parisiens, all other names
set asyde, desyre yet that the science of Theologi
                     •
                  
               
be peculierly annexed to theyr vniuersitee. Italians, aboue
all men count theim selues learned in humanitee
and eloquence, chiefely gloriyng in this, that amongꝭ
all other nacions, they be not Barbarous. In whiche
kynde of felicitee the Romains are principall, who euin
yet, dreame pleasauntly of the triumphes of theyr
olde Rome. Venecians, put great confidence in their
nobilitee. Grekes, as authours of all sciences, doe
magnifie theim selues in so many famous men, as whilom
flourished in theyr countrey. Turkes, and all that
frothe of the verie Barbariens, wolde be commended
yet euin for theyr religion, laughyng christen men to
scorne, as rather full of supersticions. But muche more
sweetely are the Iewes deceiued, who constantly loke
yet after theyr Messias, and euin till this daie stande
obstinately by theyr Moyses law. Hispanierdes,
wolde be taken for good men of warre. Allemaignes,
dooe faune vpon theim selues for theyr talnesse, and
knowlage in artmagike. Thus, as it were to longe to

repete all, so you see (I trow) how muche this arrogance
of Self loue dooeth delite all men, in all places.
With whom in a maner hir syster Adulacion may compare.
For Self loue is naught els, but whan a man
fauneth on hym selfe. Whiche if thou dooest to an other,
than is it Adulacion, or flaterie. But now a
daies Flaterie (on gods name) is taken for a vite fault,
but of suche as are moued rather with the name,Flaterie a most requisite and commodious thyng to mans conuersacion. than
with the thyng it selfe. They thinke how faieth, may
euill ioygne with flaterie, whiche to be otherwyse, we
maie learne through the exemple of brute beastes. For
what can be more faunyng, and flattryng to a man,
than a dogge? but than againe, what is more faiethful?
What is fuller of daliance than a squyrell? but than
againe what is lesse hurtfull? Unlesse perchaunce ye
will saie, that Lyons, Tygres, or Leoperdꝭ are meter
for mans recreacion. How be it there is in deede a
certaine kynde of flaterie, wherby some traitours and
deceitfull villaines, dooe traine simple folkes oftentymes
to theyr vndoyng. But this Adulacion of myne
procedeth wholy from a certaine gentilnesse, and easie
whitenesse (as it were) of a friendly good will, and
draweth muche nearer to a vertue, than dooeth hir contrarie,
that is to saie, a roughe plainesse, or vnmanerly crabbednesse,
to beare with no man. This Adulacion encourageth
a weake sprite, comforteth one droupyng in sadnesse,
quickeneth a langwisshyng thought, wakeneth a
dulle head, reiseth vp a sicke mynde, mollifieth a stubbourne
hert, getteth loue, and ones gotten, reteineth it
still, enticeth children with a good wil to lerne their bokes,
gladdeth olde folkes, teacheth, and admonissheth

princꝭ of theyr duities, vnder coulour of praise, without
offendyng, briefely, it maketh that eche man to him
selfe is bothe dearer, and more acceptable: whiche effect
maie well be taken for the chiefest membre of felicitee.
And what can be more faunyng, than whan one
man praiseth an other? lyke moyles clawyng eche others
backe? Or what nedeth me to alleage vnto you, how
this flaterie supplieth a great good porcion of that famous
Eloquence, greatter percell of Philike, &amp; greatest
of Poetrie? at ones, that she is euin the verie hony, and
conserue of mans societee and companiyng togethers?
But Philosophers saie it is a miserable thyng to be begyled,
and erre so. Naie, most miserable is it (I saie) not
to erre,Mans life dependeth vpon opinions of thynges, and not to be deceiued. For too too are thei deceiued,
who wene that mans felicitee consisteth in thinges
selfe, and not rather in the opinion how the same
are taken. In as muche as in all humaine thynges, there is
so great darkenesse and diuersnesse, as nothyng maie be clerely
knowne out, nor discouered: lyke as truely was affirmed
by my Academicall philosophers, the lest arrogant amonges
all theyr Sectes. Or if that ought maie be
knowen, the same yet not seeldome disauaileth to the
gladsomenesse and pleasure of the lyfe. Lastly, so is
mans mynde framed, as muche more it deliteth in thynges
to the shew, than in suche as are in deede. Wherof
who so list to haue a liuely prouffe, let hym no more
but goe to a sermon, wherin if ought be saied grauely,
and to the mattier, he shall see straight all the audience,
other slepe, or gaspe, or be vrkesome. But and if the
skreker (the preacher I woulde haue saied) falleth out
of his purpose, as commenly their vsage is, into some

tale of Gesta Romanorū, or suche lyke, than by and by
they lift vp their headꝭ, they stande vp, and geue good
care. Also if any sainct amongꝭ other, semeth rathest
to be newfounde or poeticall, admitte it be sainct Brandon,
saint Christophre, or sainct Barbara, the same yet
shall ye see more deuoutly woorshipped, and vowed to
of the people, than Peter, or Paule, yea or Christ hym
selfe. But these mattiers perteine not to this place.
            Consider you therfore, how muche lesse costeth the acquirey
of this felicitee, whiche dependeth on the semblance
and opinion of a thyng, as if it were had, than
that other of the thyng selfe, beyng had in deede, whiche
be it of neuer so small value and estimacion, as
Grammer, yet you see how longe a man must sweate
ere he gette it, wheras the semblaunce of the same ye
maie easelie conceiue, and come by, through your owne
perswasion: and yet shall that conceipte as muche, or
more auaile you towardꝭ felicitee. For admitte that
one eateth stinkyng saltfisshe, wherof some other could
scant byde the smelle, and yet to his mouthe it tasteth
sweeter than a partrich, now (I praie you) what difference
is there, as touchyng the felicitee he taketh
therin? Or an other abhorred to eate of a Carpe, or
some other delicate kynde of fisshe, did that any thyng
hyndre the blisfull state of his life? If a man hath a
wyfe as vglie as maie be, who yet in his conceipt maie
compare in beautie with Venus, is it not all one now
vnto hym, as if she were fayre in deede? If he that
beholdeth a table daubed with a little durt and redde
Okre, did perswade hym selfe it were a pece of Apelles
or Hans Holbyns peinctyng, is he not happier (trow

ye) than some other, who at great price haue bought
some of those woorkmens woorkꝭ? and peraduenture
take lesse pleasure in regardyng of the same, than he
dooeth of his? I know a gentilman, that presented
his new wedded wife with certaine counterfeict stones
set in ringꝭ, perswadyng hir (as he could dooe finely enough)
that not onely they were true, and orient, but
also of great value. Now I praie you, what skilled
that to hir? Seyng she contented bothe hir eies
and fantesie with those counterfeictꝭ, kepyng them for
a great treasure, wheras the housbande in the meane
season bothe spared cost, and toke pleasure at his wynes
errour, who natheles conned him as great thanke,
as if they had been right iewels. Is there any difference
(trow ye) betweene suche as Plato feigneth sittyng in a
caue vnder the grounde, to see nothyng but shadowes and representacions
of thynges, so that they dooe coueite naught els, and
content theim selues therwith, and that wyseman, he imagineth
shoulde come out of the caue, and so see verie thynges as they are
in deede? That and if Micillus in Lucians dialogues
had euermore dreamed that his golden &amp; riche dreame,
than neded he not to haue wisshed for any other felicitee.
Conclude therfore, that no difference is betwene
a thyng it selfe, and the opinion or semblaunce of the
same: or if there be, than are my fooles yet in the happier
trade. Fyrst because theyr felicitee costeth theim
as little as can be, as onely an easy perswasion and belefe
that they haue, or can dooe a thyng. Nexte than,
for that they eni

others, and pardie ye knowe, how vnpleasaunt the
possession of any weale is, without felowship, as if a

man dwelled without company in the fayrest platte of
the whole earth. Wherunto I maie lyken these wisemen.
For who is he that knoweth not how scarce the
                  •
               
are to fynde, in case ye fynde any at all? In deede the
Grekes in so many hundred yeres coulde pyke out but

               y

of a wiseman amongꝭ theim all. Therfore, if amonges
many commoditees whiche my cosyn Bacchus doth
endue you with,Drunkennesse. this (and woorthily) is reputed the
chiefest, that throughe drunkennesse he wypeth all cares, and
anxietees from the mynde, but for a season onely, (for as soone
as one hath slept a while vpon his drinke, and tempred
so his braines, than returne in post haste his former troubles
and vexacions). How farre more ample, and redie
than is my benefite of Folie vnto you?Folie a cō
                  tinuall drunkennesse. whan thorough
a continuall drunkennesse (as it were) I replenishe
your myndꝭ, with muche ioie, delite, and pleasure,
yea and that so easelie brought about? Whiche benefite
of myne I dooe distribute to all men, wheras other
Goddꝭ gyftes are deriued sundrely vpon sundrie
men. Pardie, these noble and fine wiues that are hable
to resolue sadnesse, and make men plucke vp theyr
stomakes, dooe not grow in euerie place. Few haue
the gyfte of beautie through Venus fauour. Fewer
haue eloquence at Mercuries handꝭ. Hercules maketh
not all men riche. Iupiter graunteth not kyngdomes
to euery bodie. Oftentymes Mars fauoureth neither
partie. Many retourne discomforted from Apollos
oracle. Not seeldome Ioues thunder destroieth men:
and Phebus launceth his arowes of plage amonges

you. Neptunus drowneth more folkꝭ than he saueth
(for what shoulde I speake of these Veïoues, Plutones,
Ates, Peynes, Feuers, and suche other, not goddes,
but rather helhoundꝭ and turmentours vnto you).
But I Folie am she,Folies power embraceth all men. that egally dooe comprehende all
men vnder the compasse of my so great a good gifte.
And loke not yet to be praide vnto, nor am not angrie,
nor seke amendꝭ, whan any parte of my sacrifice is
misdoen, or ouerslipped. Nor I mingle not heauen and
earth together, if any one biddyng the other Goddꝭ to
a sacrifice banket, leaueth me onely behynd, and alloweth
me not my porcion of the smoke, and sauour of the
burnt offryngꝭ. For of the other Goddꝭ in this poinct
suche is the morositee and ceremoniousnesse, as in a maner
it is easier, yea and lesse perill for a man to let them
alone, than to medle with theyr rites, and obseruauncꝭ.
Lyke as some men there be, so waywarde of nature,
and so testi
                  •
               e, as better it were not to vse theyr company,
than to claime any acquaintance of theim. But no
man (saie they) maketh sacrifice vnto folie, nor buildeth hir a
temple. Now surely I meruaile not a little, (as afore
I saied) at suche ingratitude of men. But yet of my
gentilnesse I take this also in good part. Albeit to saie
the trouth I fynde no want therof at all. For why
shoulde I requyre, either frankensence, or leuained meale, or
a gote, or a hogge for my sacrifice? Wheras all mortall
men, in euerie region, doe yelde me that woorshippyng,
whiche euin by these scripture doctours is wonte to be
moste approued? Unlesse perchaunce I shoulde enuie
Diana, because hir altars ar besprent with mans bloud.
Naie, I thinke my selfe to be than moste amplie, and

religiously woorshipped, whan euerie where, all men

kynde of woorshippyng is not verie rife, no not amongꝭ

that at noone daies whan lest nede is? But than againe,
how few of theim goe about to folow hir steppꝭ

be woorshipped. Moreouer, why shoulde I fynde
lacke of a temple,All the worlde a temple to Folie. seeyng all this worlde is in maner
of a temple most goodly (as I take it) vnto me? And
as for priestꝭ of my law, and other ministers of my religion,
I am sure I want none in any place, wheras
men want not. Than, I am not altogether so foolish,
to demaunde any grauen or peincted images representyng
me,Grauen &amp; Peincted images. whiche rather shoulde derogate than aduance

as they that are thruste out of theyr roumes, by
theyr deputies. But I take it, that so many imagꝭ
are erected in my name, as there be liuyng men, bearyng
the liuely representacion and image of me about
theim, will they, or will they not. Wherfore, I haue
no cause to be agreeued with the other Goddꝭ, though
they be woorshipped sundrely, in sundrie partes of the
earth: and that at tymes of the yere prefixed. As Phebus
in the Isle of Rhodes, Venus in Cypres, Iuno
at Argos, Minerua at Athenes, Iupiter in Olympus,

Neptunus at Tarentum: and Priapus at Lampsacum,
Wheras all the worlde vniuersally offreth me daie by
daie farre dearer, and more digne sacrificꝭ, than theirs
are. That and if I seme to some folkꝭ, to haue spoken
these woordꝭ more stoutly, than truely, goe to, let
vs but view a little, and consider the veraie lyues, and
doyngꝭ of men, and so it shall manifestly appeare, how
muche thei are endebted vnto me, and how muche I am
made of, bothe of hiegh and low degrees. Yet I entend
not to accoumpt euery mans life, for that were an endlesse
labour, but a certaine onely of the moste notable,
wherby ye maie easely gesse, what the rest are. For
what nede I to alleage vulgar people? who altogethers
(without any question) aperteine to my bande?The commen life of men full of Folie.
            
            So many veines of Folie they abounde in, and so many
new mynes they dooe fresshe and fresshe seke out, as a
thousand suche as Democritus was, shulde not suffice
to laughe at theim, although yet those verie laughers
had nede of an other Democritus to laugh theim also
to scorne. Yea, and it passeth, to see what sporte and
passetyme the Goddꝭ theim selues haue, at suche Folie
of these 
                  •
               elie mortall men. For as for the forenoone,
and sobre houres of the daie, those the Goddꝭ spende in
counsaile mattiers, and hearyng of mens vowes, and
supplicacions. But after diuer oues, whan they haue
drunken merily of theyr Nectar, and list not to treate
on ernest affayres, than whiche syde of heauen bendeth
most towardꝭ the earth,How the Gods out of heauen beholde mens folies in earth. there sitte they, and intentiuely
beholde what mortall men dooe: and surely no spectacle
can be more pleasaunt vnto theim. Good lorde,
what a Theatre is this worlde? how many, and diuers

are the pageantes that fooles plaie therin? For I also
not seeldome am wont to sitte amonges the Goddꝭ to
marke mens dooyngꝭ. One man see they redie to die
for loue of a woman, and the lesse he is beloued, the
more hotely to pursue hir. An other marieth the goodꝭ,
not the wydow. He settꝭ his wife to sale. An other
ielous wretche lyke Argus, kepeth his in mewe.
            This man mourneth, and lorde, what folies saieth he,
and dooeth he, hyryng also some plaiers (as it were)
to wepe and howle for the nones. An other, what so euer
he can rape and rende, slingeth it into his bealy
gutte, whan not longe after he woulde gladly skamble
for a pece of biskette. An other puttꝭ all his delite in
slepe, and slouth. There be some suche also, as busie
them selues busely in other mens businesse, not lokyng
ones how theyr owne goeth. Some coumpt theim selues
riche men, in borowyng of Peter to clothe Paule, whan
soone after they fynde not one fardyng left, wherwith
to blisse them. An other thinkꝭ nothyng better, than
liuyng hym selfe wretchedly, to make Iohn̄ his sonne
riche. This man for a little lucre, and that also incertaine,
skymmeth all the seas committyng his life to the
waues and the wyndes, whiche no money maie restore
to hym, ones beyng forlorne. He had rather seke him
riches in the warres, than slepe in a whole skynne at
home. There be some, that in pliyng, and geuyng attendaunce
on olde men childerlesse, wene to become riche
through executourship. Suche want not also,
that in wowyng of these wealthy olde trottꝭ, thynke to
speede sooner of their purpose. Either of whiche
than surely make most pastyme to the Goddꝭ theyr beholders,

whan of those that they goe about to traine,
they also are trained, and bayted with crafte for craft.
But aboue all others, vsurersUsurer

               lest that can be, and therto handled
by them after as vile a maner, with liyng, forswearing,
bribyng, begylyng, and shiftyng, yet coumpt they them
selues to be head men of theyr parisshes, because they
weare hoopes, and goldryngꝭ on theyr fyngers. And
no meruaile, whan these blinde minions, these friers,
can so faunyngly vpholde theim in their sermons to the
people, callyng theim worshipfull, and venerande maisters,
in hope that some porcion of those euill gotten
goodꝭ, maie somewhat in compensacion of theyr golden
glosyng, fall vnto theyr couent. You shall see againe
some others so muche geuin to Pythagoras secte, (who
wolde haue all thynges amonges friendes to be in commen) that
what so euer they fynde liyng at large, with as free a
conscience they will take it, as if it came to theim by
inheritaunce. There be some also, who onely with
wisshyng and wouldyng are riche in theyr owne fautesie,
as whan they imagine certaine sweete dreames of
gladde thynges to befall theim, whiche they take sufficient
for theyr whole felicitee. Many reioyse to be
holden richmen abrode, liuing at home with an Orenge,
or an Oynion. This skapethrifte, throweth his goodꝭ
against the walles. That pennie father, skrapeth it
togethers, bothe by God, and by the diuell. He, is
driuen through ambicion, to seke fauour at hym, and
hym. He, is no medlar, but sittꝭ by his owne fyre at
home. Many fooles, tangle theim selues in the law,

and can neuer gette out of it, but holde and shoue on
bothe sydes, onely to make fa
                  •
               te these adiournyng
iudges, and Ambidexter Aduocates. This man loketh
for a new worlde. That man compasseth some
depe drifte in his head. Some one hath an especiall
deuocion to goe to Ierusalem, to Rome, or to sainct
Iames in Galice, leuyng his wife and children succourlesse
in the meane while at home. Briefely, if one
(as Menippus did) lokyng out of the moone, behelde
from thence the innumerable tumultꝭ, and businesses
of mortall men, he shoulde thynke verily he saw a meny
of flies,
               Mortall men compared to a meny of flies. 
               or gnattes, braulyng, fightyng, begilyng, robbyng,
plaiyng, liuyng wantonly, borne, bredde vp, decaiyng, and diyng:
So that it is scant beleuable, what commocions,
and what Tragedies, are sterred vp, by so littell, and
so short liued a vermyn as this man is. For sometimes
a small storme of warre, or pestilence, swopeth awaie
and dispacheth many thousandes of theim togethers.
But I were plainely moste foole of all, and woorthy
whom Democritus, with many laughters shuld poinct
to scorne, if I toke vpon me to tell vppe all the fortꝭ of

of madnesse. For surely these Grammerteachers are not
pestred with one, or two euils, but rather with centum
grauamina. As who euer in theyr scholes, their scholes,

a meny of boies, waxe death with noyse and criyng,
kyll theim selues with stenche and filthinesse.
            And yet through my benefite, they coumpt no men like
theim selues. So lordely a thyng they take it, whan
their feare their feareful flocke, with a thretenyng voice
and countenaunce. So princely an execucion, to teare
the poore boyes arses with roddes, and ferules, plaiyng
the tourmentours, and termagantꝭ amonges them,
muche lyke the asse wrapped in a lyons skynne. But yet,
whiles they are thus occupied, that their filthinesse semeth
more than clennesse vnto theim, that stenche, and
fyslyng, smelleth ambre grise, that bondage of bondages
is taken by theim for a kyngdome: So farfurth
as they wolde not chaunge theyr tyrannisshe estate, neither
with Phalaris nor Dionysius. But farre more
blisfull yet be they, throughe a certaine conceipt they
haue taken of a newe trade in teachyng, eche therin folowyng
his owne deuise. That wheras they put in
to childerns heades, naught but mere trifles, and fonde
rules of theyr owne, yet (Lorde) what Palaemon, or
what Donate will not they dispise, in regarde of them
selues. But (thanked be God) they fynde the meanes
yet, by what crafte I can not tell, to make the foolisshe
mothers, and ignoraunt fathers beleue, that they
are suche in deede, as they hoste theim selues to be.
            
               Adde also hereunto, this kynde of delite they haue, as
often as any of theim chaunceth in some olde boke to
fynde out the name of Anchises mother, or some other
Latine woorde not commenly vsed, as Bubsequa, Bouinator,
Manticulator, or diggeth vp some gobbet of an
olde stone grauen with Romaine or greke letters somewhat
defaced, (Lorde) than what exultacion, what triumphes,
what commendacions make they of it? as if
they had wonne all Afrike, or taken the great citee of
Babylon. What thynke you also, whan they sette vp
and shew abrode theyr versis? versis (god knoweth)
most balde, and foolisshe, but neuer the more faile thei
of some as verie asses as they, who will hieghly commende
the same: whiche putteth theim in suche a
flusshe, as plainly they beleeue they haue recouered
Virgiles owne vaine in poetrie. But this is the sweetest
poincte of all, to see theim flatter, and praise eche other,
clawyng theim selues by courses. That and if
(as is possible enough) it chanceth one of them to stumble
at some woorde, and an other beyng more aduised
than he to take hym with the maner, (Oh Hercules)
what Tragedies, what Disputacions, what Inuectiues
are tossed than and retossed betwixe theim? Let
neuer grammarian be my friende, if I lie ought herein.
I know a certaine learned man, beyng bothe a Grecian,
and a Latiniste, a Geometricien, a philosopher, and a phisicien, yea
a kyngꝭ phisicion, now almost .lx. yeres old, who settyng
all other thyngꝭ a parte, hath whole twentie yeres
togethers, gone about the makyng of a new Grammer:
estemyng hym selfe right happie, if he maie yet
liue so longe, as to sette a perfite rule and distinction

betweene the eight partes of speche: whiche hitherto
none of the Greke, nor Latine grammarians could fully
bringe to passe: As who saieth, it were deadly sinne,
if one make a Coniunction a distinction perteinyng to
the nature of Aduerbes. And for this cause, thoughe
alreadie there be as many Grammers, as Grammer-teachers,
naie m
                  •
               e, for my friende Aldus alone hath
more than fiue times set out a grāmer, yet ouerslippeth
he no grammerboke, be it neuer so tedious, and barbarously
written, whiche he l

throughly, enuiyng any man that in this kynde shoulde
goe one ace beyonde hym, as if he feared lest some other
might take the glorie hereof from him, and so his twentie
yeres labours shoulde be spent in vaine. Now whether
call you this a madnesse, or a Folie? For as to me
it skilleth not, so ye confesse it to procede all of my goodnesse,
that these poore wightꝭ, these Grammarians, and
Scholemaisters, who els shulde be as wretched as wretchednesse
it selfe, wene yet they are mounted into suche
a felicitee, as gladly they woulde not chaunge liues,
nor estates,Poetes. no not with the riche kynges of Persia. Poetes
are somewhat lesse beholding vnto me, notwithstandyng,
euin by theyr profession they shew theim selues to
be of my secte, a free kynde of men, that lyke peincters
maie feigne what they list, whose studie tendeth naught
els, than to fede fooles eares with mere trifles and foolisshe
fables. And yet it is a wonderous thyng to see,
how through fame therof, they wene to be made immortall,

               nexed familiarly,

and of no kynde of men am I obserued more
plainly, nor more constantly. Moreouer Oratours,
and Rhetoriciens,
               Rhetoriciens. notwithstandyng that a littel they
seeme to swarue from me, cleuyng to the philosophers,
yet I can proue theim also to be of my faction, as well
by other argumentes, as by this, that in the preceptes
of theyr arte, amonges diuers other trifles, they haue
written so largely and exactly, how to prouoke laughter in
an audience, and of the cast, or meanes of scoffyng: So farfurth
as he what so euer he was, that wrote the boke
of Rhetorike to Herennius, maketh folie also to be a membre
and parcell of Rhetorike. And Quintilian, the verie
headman of this ordre, in his boke of the institucion of
an Oratour, hath made one chapitre all of laughtersterryng,
lenger I wene than is Homers Iliade. yea, so
muche dooe Rhetoriciens attribute to foolisshenesse, as
oftentymes what obiection by no argumentꝭ maie be refelled,
the same yet with some laughyng and scoffyng
conceitꝭ, thei wolde haue shifted of. Unlesse perchance,
ye will saie, that folie hath naught to doe therin, whan
with suche tauntꝭ and meritourned aunswers, they prouoke
men to laughter, yea and that by rules and preceptes
geuin therof for the nones. Of this grape are

doe fisshe for a praise and glorie. These men as
generally they are muche bounden vnto me, so in especiall
are suche of theim, as dooe blotte theyr papers
with merest trifles. For as for those that take vpon
theim to write cunnyngly to the iudgement of a fewe,
and care not what learned men loke vpon theyr doyngꝭ,
theim take I to be rather miserable, than blisfull, seyng

how continually thei are faine to writhe their wittes
in and out, in puttyng to, in chaungyng, in blottyng
out, in laiyng theyr woorke aside, in oueruewyng it againe,
in shewyng it to some for a prouffe, and yet kepyng
it in theyr handꝭ whole nyne yeres togethers, so
that they are neuer satisfied with theim selues, whiles
they goe about to purchase so vaine a rewarde as praise
is, yea and that geuin theim by a few, onely so dearely
bought with many nightꝭ labors, and losse of slepe, the
sweetest thyng that can be, and with so many trauailes,
and beatyng of theyr braines about it: besides the
hurt thei susteine in their bodies, decaie of beautie, marryng
of theyr eiesight, or also blindnesse, together with
pouertee, enuie, forbearyng of pleasures, vntimely age,
hasted death, and suche like disaduantages, whiche natheles
these wisemen sticke not at, so they maie haue
theyr writyngꝭ allowed at one or two of these blereied
bokewormes handꝭ. But my Scribes on the other side,
haue not a little more commoditee and pleasure of their
folie. Wheras takyng no great leysure in pennyng
of theyr mattier, naie rather what so euer toie lighteth
in their head, or falleth in their thought, be it but theyr
dreame, they doe put the same straight in writyng, with
small dispence or none, sauyng waste of paper? knowyng
(I warrant you) what will come of it, that the fonder
the trifles be, whiche thei entreate of, the more commendacion
shall thei gette of most men, fooles as thei &amp;
vnlearned. And what maistrie is it for them to set light
store by two or three of those learned mens repriues,
if so be yet they rede theyr woorkes? Or what auaileth
theim, so few wysemens allowaunce? where so

great a multitude of fooles on the other syde will disalow
it. That in case thei haue the feate to set furth
other mens doyngꝭ for theyr owne, and can be contented
to beare the name of that, whiche others toke the
peines about, marie sir than I thynke they haue good
skille: for though it chaunce theim at laste to be taken
with the maner, yet for a season thei maie kepe theyr reputacion.
And it is a pleasure to marke how muche
these men esteeme theim selues, whan they are praised
so of the people, and whan they are poincted out in a
great company, as, this is the wonderous felow ye here of:
and whan in euery bokebynders shoppe theyr woorkes
are set to the sale, and whan they rede theyr names, surnames,
and bynames, set in the fyrst fruntꝭ of euery boke,
whiche titles also they dooe counterfeicte, and tourne
into some contrarie language, as strange as maie be deuised.
Yet, I praie you, whan all is dooen, what be
they els but names? and how few shall know those names,
hauyng regard to the worldꝭ wydenesse? and how
many lesse commende theim? namely suche diuersitee
beyng in iudgementꝭ: yea amongꝭ vnlearned men also?
But what saie you to this, that not feeldome
they feigne those names, or borow theim out of olde
A
                     •
                  tours? for one of theim ioyeth to be named Telemachus,
an other Stelenus, or Laertes, he Polycrates, he
Thrasymachus, and suche lyke. So that now it skilleth
not how they entitle theyr bookes, for by as good
reason myght they call it a goorde, or a radisshe roote, or
name it A, or B, as philosophers dooe by theyrs. But
this is the best sporte of all, to see theim present eche
others with epistles, with verses, and with mattiers of praise,
               
sent from fooles, to fooles: and from asses, to asses.
Here, he in his iudgement is as good a Poete as Alcaeus

the ende that in contendyng togethers, theyr fame maie

               ill at last bothe the Capitaines hauyng buckled manfully
togethers, wolde be taken for Victours, and both
partꝭ pretende to Triumph therfore. These thynges
of wysemen are counted to be mere folies, as in deede
thei are, who can denie it? But yet there while through
my benefire they lede a pleasaunt and glorious life, as
not willyng to chaunge theyr Triumphes, skarcely (I
beleue) with those of the Scipions. How be it, suche
as are learned in deede, are not a little also beholdyng
vnto me, whiles with great pleasure they maie
laugh at the other, and take fruicion of their madnesse,
whiche they can not againe saie, vnlesse they be to vnkinde,
and the veriest chorles of all. Next these now,Lawiers of Ciuile and canon.
               Ciuilians, and Canonistes chalenge no meane place amongꝭ
learned men. And who than they stande depelier
in Selflikyng? For whiles continually thei turne,
and retourne Sisyphus stone in rehersyng vp an hundred
lawes and Paragraphes all with a breath, it skilleth
not howe littell to purpose, and whiles they adde
glose vpon glose, and opinions vpon opinions, they
make as though theyr law science were most hard, and

difficult to be atteined to. So what so euer is hardly
dooen, that they recken straight to be moste excellent.
            And ioigne we (hardily) to theim these Sophistrers and
Logiciens,
               Logiciens. beyng a race of men more kackeling than a meny
of dawes: eche of whom in bablyng maie compare
with tenne women chosen for the nones, and farre more
happie shoulde be, in case they were onely bablers, and
not skoldꝭ also: in sorte that oftentymes for the moone
shyne in the water, they striue whole daies together, and
with to muche arguyng, lette the trueth of the mattier
slippe by theim. Natheles through Selflikyng they
are bathed all in felicitee, so that armed onely with
three Syllogismes, they dare boldly prouoke any man, as
well assured that thei wil neuer geue ouer, though Stentor
hym selfe were matched against theim. Nexte
theim come these Philosophers,
               Philosophers. venerable for theyr
longe beardꝭ, and clokes downe to the feete, protestyng
theim selues onely to haue knowlage and wysedome,
wheras other men stande for no more than Ciphres in
Algorisme. But (lorde) how sweetely doe they raue
in theyr owne opinion: whan constauntly they affirme
there be worldꝭ innumerable? Or whan they take
vpon theim to measure the sonne, the moone, the planetes
and theyr compasses, as it were by ynchemeale, or
drawne with a line: Or whan they expounde the causes
of thunder, of wyndes, of eclipses, and suche other inexplicable
thyngꝭ, nothyng doubtyng, as if they had
crepte into natures bosome, or were of counsaile with
the Goddꝭ. And yet dooeth nature lowdely laughe
theim to scorne, with all theyr coniectures: coniectures
I saie, and no certaine knowlage, whiche appereth by

this, that one secte of theim agreeth not with an other,
but rather contendeth togethers vpon euery little thing.
And yet these men, who in deede know nothing, wil take
vpon them to know all thyng. Yea wheras they know
not theim selues, nor see not oftentymes a pitte, or a
stone liyng in theyr waie, either for poreblyndnesse, or
because theyr witte is not at home, yet make thei theyr
auaunt to see and perceiue plainely theyr Idees, theyr
vniuersals, formes separate, fyrst mattiers, quidditees, and Ecceites,
thynges so subtile, and so fine, as not Lynceus
hym selfe could espie theim out, though it be saied how
he could see through a stone walle. But than chiefely
doe these Philosophers disdeigne other vulgar people,
as often as with triquetre, and tetragon circles,
or with suche lyke Mathematical figures, drawne one
vpon an other, and entangled in maner of a mase, with
letters also set as it were in order of battaile, and with
liues drawne hither and thither, they dooe cast a miste

also of this kynde of men, that take vpon theim by lokyng
on the sterres, and planetes, to tell vs aforehand,
what shall happen and betide a hundred yeres after.
            Declaryng by theyr Prognosticacions, the successe of
certeine wonderous accidentꝭ, straunger than any wyche
crafte, or artmagike. yet suche is their happe, to
fynde out men, who of theyr singular grosnesse geue
credence also to this their so plaine illusion. Now
hauyng reached thus farre, and comen to the place of
doctours of diuinitee, I stande in doubt whether I maie
speake of theim,Doctours of diuinite
                     ••
                  
                or rather passe theim ouer, and not

                  ••
               urre at all theyr pacience, beyng a neste of men so

crabbed and waspelyke, lest els perchaunce thei shulde
all at ones fall vpon me with sixe hundred conclusions,
driuyng me to rec
                     •••
                  ; that in case I refused so to doe,
than wolde they by and by denounce me for an heretike.
For that is the thunderbolt, wherwithall they threten
suche, as stande not best in theyr fauour. But surely
although none other sorte of men dooe with lesse good
will than these, acknowlage my goodnesse vnto theim:
Yet can I proue these Doctours also to be more than
one or two waies in my daunger, beyng so propped vp
with theyr owne Arrogance and Selflikyng, as if thei
dwelled amongꝭ the sterres, or loked downe from aloft,
and in a maner toke compassion vppon other seely men
lyke wourmes crepyng by the grounde. Namely
whiles thei are hedged in on all sides, with suche a gard
of Magistral diffinicions, conclusions, corollaries, explicite
and implicite proposicions, with so many startyng
holes, as not Vulcanes nettꝭ were hable so fastly
to holde theim, but they wolde wynde theim selues out
againe with Distinctions, wherwith thei carue al knottes
asunder, as smothely as a rasour dooeth the heares
of a mans beard. Suche a noumbre of newfounde
monstrous termes haue they thicke and threefolde inuented.
Also whiles thei expounde the secrettꝭ of scripture
at theyr pleasure, disputyng how the worlde was
fyrst create, and proporcioned, by what chanels sinne was deriued
into Adams posteritee,
               The foolisshe questions or 
                     ••
                  hole doctours. 
               what waies, by what measure, and
in how short space Christ was complete in the wombe of Marie
the virgin: And how in the sacrament of the altare, the accidentes
of breade and wyne, remaine whan the substance is goen:
but these questions are for euerie young beginner. Other

haue thei more mete for great and illuminate doctours,
whiche if at any tyme in disputacions or talkyng after
diner they doe stumble vpon, straight thei shake of theyr
slepie noddyng, and doe rowse theim selfꝭ. As, whether
any instant was in the generacion of god the secounde person?
whether in Christ there be more filiacions than one? whether
this proposicion be possible? God the father, hateth
the sonne, or whether Christ might possiblie haue taken to hym
the likenesse of a woman, of a feende, of an asse, or of a goorde?
Or how that goorde shoulde haue preached, doen miracles, or been

                     •
                  anged on the crosse? Or what shoulde Peter haue consecrated,
if he had consecrated what time Christes body hunge on the crosse?
Or whether Christ beyng transformed so into a goorde, might at
the same tyme be called man also? Or whether after the resurrection
it be leefull for men to eate or drinke? as who saith, prouidyng
for hungre and thurst afore hand. Innumerable
suche fine toyes haue they, muche more subtile than
these, of Instantes, formalitees, quidditees and Ecceitees, whiche
no man I beleue could espie out, vnlesse he were so
clere eied, as to see out in a deepe depe darkenesse those
thingꝭ that be no where. I maie adde also here to their
sentences or sawes, whiche are so estraunge and beyonde
all expectacion, as the verie Stoikes sentences called
Paradoxes, beyng compared to theyrs, seme grosse, and
more than vulgar. (For exemple) Lesse sinne is it, (saie
they) to slea a thousande men, than ones on a sondaie to clowte
a poore mans shoe. Or rather shoulde we let all the worlde goe
to wreke bothe with dogge and catte (as thei saie) than ones
to make a lesyng, be the mattier neuer so lyght. Now againe,
these theyr subtile subtilties, doe 
                  〈◊〉
                make yet more subtile,
through so many sortes of Scholemen as thei haue.

So that easier you shall finde it to wind out of a mase,
then out of their intricate names of Reales, Nominales,
Thomistes, Albertistes, Occanistes and Dunsmen,
               The sectes of schole doctours. yet
these be not all, but the principal onely. But turne you
to whiche sect of thē ye will, and ye shall proue the same
to be so cunnyng, so difficult, and so full of hiegh Misteries,
as I wene the apostles theim selues had nede to
be enstructed by a new sprite, in case vpon these matters
they were compelled to argue with this new kynde of
doctours. Paule coulde expresse what faieth was:
yet whan he saied thus, faieth is the substance of thynges to
be hoped after, and an euidence of thynges not yet appearyng.
This Diffinicion (saie they) was not Magistraliter (idest)
doctour like sette foorth by hym. And, as Paule
coulde verie well teache what was Charitee, so did he
not yet (saie thei) halfe lyke a Logicien either diffine, or deuide
the same, in the fyrst epistle, and .xiii. chapitte to
the Corinthiens. The apostles likewyse did holily
and deuoutly enough consecrate the sacrament of Christes
bodie: and yet, who so had apposed them in terminus
à quo, and t
                     •
                  rminus ad quem, or in transubstanciacion,
or by what meanes the selfe same body of God may be in diuers
places at ones? or of the difference thei put nowe betweene
Christes bodie as it is 
                     〈◊〉
                   heauen, as it was on the crosse, and in the
sacrament of the altare: Or at what instant the transubstanciacion
is made, seyng the praier, by vertue wherof it is made, is euer
passyng ouer as it is on saiyng? These quaynt questions
(wene I) the apostles woulde neuer haue soluted with
lyke quickenesse of engin, as our Dunsmen do
                  •
               e bothe
argue, and diffine 
                  〈◊〉
                the same. The apostles
knew the virgin mother of Iesus
                     •
                  
                but whiche of them

did euer expounde so clerkly, how she was preserued
from Originall sinne, as our doctours doe? Peter receiued
heauen keies: yea receiued theim at his handes (saie
they) that woulde neuer haue committed the same to one vnwoorthie
theim. Now whether he knew so muche or
no, I can not tell: but this I am sure of, that he neuer
touched this narow poinct, how it cometh to passe, that
he also maie haue the keie of science, who hath no science at all.
The apostles Baptized euery where, and yet thei neuer
taught what is the formal, material, efficient, or finall
cause of Baptisme: nor euer made mencion of the character
delible and indelible. The apostles praied, but
praied in the sprite, folowyng that saiyng of the gospell,
God is a sprite, and who so woorship hym, must worship all
in the sprite, and in tr
                     •
                  uthe. But now it appeareth, that it
was not than reueled vnto theim, how we ought with
all one praier, and lyke reuerence, woorship an Image
drawne perhaps with a cole on the wall, as if the same
were Christ hym selfe. So it be made with .ii. blissing
fyngers of the right hand streched out, and a ball in the
other, with longe heare sheded and a coronet in maner
of a platter vpon his noddle, decked with thre sonnebeames.
For who is he so pregnant witted, that might euer
grope out these misteries, vnles he had spent whole
xxxvi. yeeres togethers in studiyng the Physicals and
Vltramundans of Duns, and Aristotle? The apostles
also preached grace vnto the people: but yet they
neuer made so narow distinction betwene gratia gratis
data, and gratia gratificans. They exhorted men to
good woorkꝭ, yet neuer put difference betwene opus operans,
and opus operatum. Thei bydde vs in many

places kepe charitee: but neuer deuide the same into
Charitas infusa, and Charitas operata, nor expeund not
whether it be an accident, or a substance, a create, or
an vncreate thyng. Thei dishort vs from sinne, but
I renie my selfe, if euer they coulde cunningly di
                  •
               fine,
what that shoulde be, we call sinne? Unlesse thei were
inspyred with the sprite of these Duns doctours. For
I can neuer beleue, that Paule, vpon whose writyng we
maie gesse what mynde the other apostles had therin,
woulde euer so often haue reproued and condempned,
such questions, disputacions, genealogies, and conflictꝭ
of woordꝭ (as he calleth theim) in case him selfe had
euer been instructed in theyr fine quidditees. Namely
in as muche as all the contencions, and debates in arguyng,
whiche chaunced in his tyme, were but blunte,
and verie grosse, in comparison of these twise syfted
subtiltees, that our Maister doctours vse now a daies.
How be it they can so muche theyr good, that where in
any place they finde ought written by the apostles not
formally, and Magistraliter, that they reproue not, but
handsomely rather dooe interpretate it as best serueth
for theyr purpose: bearyng (as who saieth) thus muche
reuerence partly to the antiquitee, aud partly to the
name of apostleship. And surely it were to muche to
requyre so hiegh mattiers at the apostles handes, who
neuer heard one worde therof mencioned by theyr maister
Christ. But in case they take either Chrysostome,
Basile, or Hierome with the lyke trippe, tha
                  •
               
they take it sufficient for theim to subscribe, that they
allow it not. And yet those ancient good fathers, rather
through theyr holie life and miracles, than by any

argumentes and Syllogismes, confuted bothe Ethenikes,
and Philosophers, and Iewes, beyng bent of nature
to stubbournesse, yea and those also, neuer a one of
whom were able to compasse and vnderstande the lest
quodlibet of Duns. But now, haue ye any painem,
or beretike, that will not geue place and yelde straight
to so many fine fine argumentꝭ of our maister doctors?
Unlesse he were so grosse, that he wiste not what they
ment? or so shamelesse to hisse at theim? or rather fensed
with lyke armour? so that now they were matches,
as if ye shulde set one enchaunter against an other, or an Olyuer
for a Roland. For than the battaile were euer new to beginue.
And surely in my iudgement christen princes
shoulde doe politikely, in stede of these bendes of grosse
Lausknightꝭ, who not seeldome (prouffe sheweth) dooe
speede as well euill as better, to arme, and sende foorth
all these baulyng Dunsmen, and stubbourne Occanistes,
and inuincible Albertistes, together with the whole
tablement of Sophistrers, against the Turkes and Sarasius.
They shoulde see (I thynke verily) a strange
kynde of skyrmisshe, with suche a victorie as neuer was
heard of. For who is he so colde herted, that would
not straight be enflamed with theyr pregnant deuises?
Or who is he so blunt, and restiue, that could not with
theyr pickant spurres be quickened? Or who so clere
sighted, that maie not with suche darke mistes as they
cast, be blynded? But all this perchaunce ye wene I
speake halfe in mocage. And truely no meruaile.
            Seeyng euin amongꝭ these Diuines ye shall fynde out
some suche, as beyng institute in a better trade of learnyng,
dooe lothe, and abhorre suche riddles and Sophistical
               
trifles of these Dunsmen. Some other againe
that dooe curse and detest the same, as a kinde of
Sacrilege, estemyng it plaine wickednesse and impietee,
to speake so vnreuerently by so hiegh secretes of
Scripture, whiche rather we shoulde haue in veneracion,
than after suche rate goe about to expounde theim,
or with so prophane Ethnical problemes to dispute vpon
theim, or arrogantly diffine theim, defilyng and
bespottyng the maiestee of holy scripture with so cold,
naie rather filthie woordꝭ and sentences. But this
notwithstandyng, the other coddes heddꝭ in the meane
while stande moste pleasauntly in theyr owne grace, or
verilier stroke theim selues on the head. So that occupiyng
them selues bothe nightꝭ and daies, about these
foolisshe toyes, they haue neuer thus muche leisure,
ones to reade ouer the gospell, or Paules epistles: and
yet in triflyng out the tyme thus in theyr scholes, they
beleue verily it is they, that proppe vppe holy churche,
whiche els shoulde goe to ruine, none otherwise with
their Syllogismes, than poetes feigne that Atlas the
geaunt susteigneth heauen vpon his shoulders. But
now, how lordly is their felicitee (trow ye) whiles thei
take vpon theim to forme and refourme holy scripture
at their pleasure, as if it were a nose of waxe, or a Welshemans
hose? and whiles they woulde their conclusions,
wherunto a certaine of some vniuersitee haue subscribed,
shoulde be holden for more than estatutes, yea
more fyrme and inuiolable, than the bishop of Romes
Decretals? And whiles also like iudges ouer the whole
worlde, they call eche thyng to recantacion, that one
heare bredth disagreeth from theyr explicite, and implicite

conclusions: Pronouncyng as if it came from a
prophetes mouthe, how this proposicion is sklaunderous, this
not reuerent, this smelleth of the fagote, this soundeth naught.
            
            So that now a daies, not Bapti

                  me, nor the gospell,
nor Paule, ne Peter, nor Hierome, ne Augustine, nor
yet Thomas of Alquyne, who is euin Aristotles heyre
and one hand, are able to make a man christian, vnlesse
these father bachelars of diuinitee, dooe vouchesaue
to subscribe vnto the same. So narow and profounde
iudgement haue thei, in discussyng of all maner doubtꝭ.
For who woulde euer haue thought hym to be of no catholyke

had taught vs the contrarie? Or who els might

errours, whiche no man I thinke wold euer haue redde,
or loked on, vnlesse they vnder the great seales of their
vniuersitees, had in condemnyng discouered theim?
            But are they not most blisfull (trow ye) whiles they
busie theim selues hereabout? and moreouer whiles
they descriue and peinete vnto vs all thynges dooen in
hell, so exactly as if many yeres they had seiourned in
the diuels court? Or whiles as liketh theim they doe
builde new heauens, addyng also one heauen set aboue
all the other, most fayre and rowmie, least els perchance
sainctꝭ soules shoulde haue no elbowroome to walke, or
bankette, or plaie at tenes also if theim listed. With
these, and with two thousande suche other trifles, are
theyr headꝭ so stuffed, and swolne vppe, as not Iupiters

And therfore haue ye no meruaile at all, though at their
Actes and Comencementꝭ ye dooe see theim swadled
in with so many cappes,The solēne weade of schole doctours. coyu
                  •
               s, and furde hodes as
they weare, for els I thinke plainely theyr headꝭ wolde
riue asunder. One thyng, I my selfe am wonte to
laugh at, so often as I here theim speake theyr barbarous
brasse latine, wherin natheles they wolde be compted
most doctourlike. That whan they fumble it out
in suche a sort, as none but fumblers as thei, may vnderstande
theim, yet dooe they call it a certaine grace and
finesse, whiche euerie body can not attaine vnto. For
(saie they) it is not for the dignitee of holie writte, our
profession, that we shoulde be compelled to folow any
grammer rules: whiche surely (so beyng) is a great
maiestee of these Duns doctours, if to theim onely it
be lawfull to speake false latine. notwithstanding that
many coblers and clowters can doe that as well as thei.
Lastly now, they take theim selues in a maner for Gods
peres, whan they are saluted solemnely by the name of
maister doctours, or Magister noster: wherin thei wene
lyke misterie to be included, as the Iewes saie there is
in 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               : and therfore they affyrme it to be
a muche great offence, if one doe write, MAGISTER
NOSTER otherwyse than with great letters, that
and if ye tourne the woordꝭ, saiyng noster Magister, in
steede of Magister noster, than all at ones ye disorder
the maiestee of the Theological name. Now next
vnto the felicitee of these maister doctours, suche dooe
aproche as people calle Religious men,
               Religious men. and Monkes,
that is to saie, solitarie liuers, but by bothe names euill

applied: seyng the greatest part of them are most farre
from religion, and none so commenly shall you mete rouyng
abrode, euin in euery a
                  •
               ehouse. Whose trade and
obseruaunce surely were most miserable and abiect, vnlesse
that I did many waies releue them. For though
this kynde of men be commenly so abhorred, as euin to
mete with theim at vnwares, or next a bodies risyng,
it is taken for a signe of euill lucke all the daie after: yet
(lorde) how they make theim selues to be more than
Cherubyns. For fyrst they hold it a great holinesse,
to medle so little with bookes, and learnyng, as scarce
they know how to read theyr owne names. And whan
they rore foorth (lyke a meny of asses) in theyr monasteries,
a noumbre of psalmes not vnderstanded, than
they wene verily to fede sainctes eares with a meruailous
melodie. Moreouer, some orders of them (namely
Friers) dooe take a pride in theyr beggerie in goyng
from dore to dore to a
                  •
               e theyr breade with a great lowyng
voyce, pestryng men euery where, bothe in innes, in
wagens, and in passengers, not a little (I promise you)
to the hyndrance of other begsters. And thus (loe) the
blinde minious, what with theyr gresinesse, doltisshenesse,
rudenesse, and shamelesse hangyng on men, dooe
represent vnto vs (as theim selues saie) the life of the
apostles. But is it not a comelinesse (trow ye) whan
they dooe all thynges by certaine presidentꝭ of theyr
orders, muche ly
                  ••
               e Mathematicall rules, whiche in no
wyse without offence, they maie alter, or swerue fro.
            As for example, how many wyndowes they muste make to
theyr shooes? what colour, and noumbre of knottes goeth to their
gurdelles? with what difference, and wherof must their wedes be

made? of what breadth their lether thounges? how many busshelfuls
their couses? how many ynches longe, their notted heare?
and how many houres for slepyng? Now who is he that seeth
not how vnequall this equalitee of theyrs is, namely
in suche a diuersnesse of bodies, and disposicions?
            Yet vnder confidence of these trifles, they not onely set
laie men as light as butterflies, but euin amongꝭ theim
selues despise eche other. So that for all the apostolyke
charitee, whiche thei professe, ye shall not see them
sticke to fall together by the eares, either for a gurdell
of a contrary facion, or a garment somewhat of a browner
or lighter colour. Yea, some of theim beyng of a
straighter rule, are so sore punisshers of theyr flesshe,
as outwardly they weare naught but sacke clothe, and
inwardly no better than fine holland. Some others
againe dare as soone touche poyson as money, neuer
the more forbearyng from wyne, nor contrectacion of
women. Finally all theyr delite is to accorde in nopoinct
as touchyng the rules of theyr religions. Nor
they loke not how to resemble Christe, but sooner how
amongꝭ theim selues to be dissemblable: estemyng further
a great parte of theyr felicitee to consiste in the names
of theyr orders. For some of them reioise to be called
grey friers, some white, these Colletes, thei Minors,
other Obseruauntꝭ, other Crossed, some Benedictines,
some Bernardines, these Carmelites, those
Augustines, these Guilhelmites, those Iacobites. &amp;c.
            
            As who saieth it were to sklender a name for theim to
be called bare Christians. Now againe moste part of
theim are so geuin to their ceremonies, and tradicions
of men, as maketh theim wene, that one heauen is not

a condigne, and sufficient rewarde for so great merites
of theyrs, little remembring that Christe nothyng regardyng
theyr supersticions, will onely call to accompt
how they haue obserued his precept of charitee. Here
one of theim (maie chance) will for his discharge shew
foorth a trowgh stuffed full of all kynde of fisshe. An other,
will poure foorth an hundred quarters of psalmes. An other,
will noumbre vp millions of fastynges, castyng God in the tethe,
that so often with eatyng but one meale a daie, his belie was nere
burst. An other, will bringe foorth whole packes of ceremonies,
so many as scarce might be freyghted in .vij. great bulkes.
An other, will make his auaunt, that whole .lx. yeeres togethers
he neuer touched money, but (at least) his handes were fensed
with two paire of gloues. An other, will shewe foorth
his cowle, or scapularie so sweatie, and full of grese, as no mariner
would gladly put it on. An other, will saie that sins time
of his nouiceship be neuer passed the 
                     •
                  andes of his cloyster, muche
like a sponge cleuyng euer to one place. An other, that
he is hoarce with daiely singyng. An other, how through to
muche solitarinesse, he is fallen into a benummednesse. An other,
how his tounge throughe continuall silence hath loste his
vse. But Christ iuterruptyng theyr Selfebostes, whiche
els woulde neuer take ende, whence cometh (will he
saie) this new race of Iewes, I dooe acknowlage but one lawe
and rule for myne, wherof I here neuer a woorde spoken. For
whilom plainly, and by no shadow of parables, I promised my
fathers kyngdome not to Cowles, nor Rosaries, not set fastyngꝭ,
but rather to the woorkes of charitee: not I know none suche, as
to muche know their owne good woorkes. These men woulde
be coumpted holier than my selfe: let them dwell therfore if thei
list in Pasquilles heauen. Or dooe they cause those to prepare

a new heauen for theim, whose tradicions thei haue preferred before
my preceptes. Now whan they here Christe saie
thus, and see bothe carters, and ploughmen, preferred
before theim, with what countenance (suppose ye) will
one of theim beholde an other? Natheles in the meane
tyme they are happie in theyr owne hope, not without
my helpe largely employed on theim. Specially seyng
for all they are dead (as they saie) to this worlde,
no man dare yet contemne theim, and lest of all fr
                  •
               ers,
in as muche as they are maisters of mens secretes by
vertue of that thei call confession: whiche secretꝭ thei
coumpt it great sinne to discouer, vnlesse at some tymes
hauyng tasted a little of the ale, thei thynke good to recreate
theim selues with sportyng tales a crasshe, onely
by coniectures and lykelihoodꝭ to poincte you to the
thyng, suppressyng yet mens names of theyr modestie.
That and if any man sterreth vp these hornettꝭ, than in
sermons to the people haue they a readie waie to wreke
theyr tene, by touchyng theyr ennemies not directly,
but in parables, so closely I warrant you, as no man
could not perceiue theim, but if he perceiued nothyng at
all. And neuer will they make an ende of barkyng till
some fatte morsell be cast them, to stoppe their mouthꝭ.
But who in the meane while wolde not gladlier behold
one of these frier preachers how they counterfeicte the
Rhetoriciens in their sermons (lowsely god knoweth)
but yet fetely folowyng those rules that Oratours leue
written of the Arte of pronouncyng, than any stage plaier,
or Italian pardoner? Good lorde, what straunge iestures
they frame? how they singe theyr woordꝭ? how
they caste theyr armes hither and thither? how they

chaunge the copie of their conntenaunces? how they
mingle all thyngꝭ with outcries? whiche theyr saied
arte in preachyng, conueied by one frier to an other, as
it were from hande to hand, for a muche priuey thyng,
all be it vnleefull for me to know, yet I shall make you
a gesse at it as nere as I can.Preachers In the beginnyng
therefore of theyr sermons, they vse some Inuocacion,
but that they borow of the Poetes. Than admitte
theyr Theme reune on charitee, they fetche theyr proheme
from Nilus the great riuer in Aegypt. Or entenyong
to exprunde the misterie of the crosse, they beginne
aptly with Beel the dragon of Babylon. Or disputyng
of fastyng, they fetche theyr race from the .xii.
signes of the Zodiake. Or purposyng to speake of
faieth, they make a longe preamble how a circle in Geometrie
maie be made quadrate.

                  e of a preacher. I my selfe heard ones a
solemne lowre, (I crie you mercie) a solemne learned
man I shoulde haue saied, who in his sermon, before a
great assemblie, takyng vpon him to declare the mistery
of the Trinitee, to the ende he myght bothe shew his
learnyng to the people, and satisfie the eares of some
doctours there present, toke a new fet
                  •
               he in his mattier.
For what from letters, to sillables, and to dictions,
and than the concordes betwene the Nowne and the
Verbe, the Nowne adiectiue and Substantiue (diuers
of the audience now meruailyng, and saiyng to theim
selues, what the diuell ayleth he) at last he brought it
to this passe, that he shewed the figure of the whole trinitee
to be so exactly described and expressed in the rules of grammer,
as no geometricien myght plainlier draw it with his finger in the
duste. Whiche sermon the saied doctourlike doctour

whole eyght monthes together so ernestly had sweatte
about, as vntill this daie he is as poreblinde as a betle.
And no meruaile, seyng he drew vp all the sharpenesse
of his eie sight, to the poinct of his engin: but for
all that he nothyng forthinketh his blindnesse, rather
takyng the same for to chepe a price of suche a glorie as
he wanne therby. Lykewise, not longe agone I
was present at the sermon of an other famous doctour,
beyng almost .80. yeres old, and therto so doctourlike,
as if Duns were new arisen in hym, who entendyng to
disclose the misterie of the name of Iesu, with great subtiltee
shewed, how euin in the verie letters was as muche
pithe included, and might be gathered therof. For wheras it
is declinable but in three cases, as Iesus, Iesum, Iesu,
that (saied he) was a manifest representacion of the Trinitee.
Than because the fyrst terminacion of Iesus endeth in
S, the secounde in M, the thyrde in V, thereby
laie a right secrete misterie, in as muche (quod he) as
the verie letters dooe declare that Iesus, is Summus, Medius,
and Vltimus, (that is) the fyrste, the middest, and
the last. An other mistery he alleged farre more strange
than these, diuidyng this woorde Iesus as it were by
geometrie into two egall partꝭ, leuyng S, in maner
of a stickler in the middle: whiche letter in the Hebrews
ABC, is W, and thei call it Syn. Now
synne (quod he) in englisshe is as muche to saie as a deadly offence
against God. so hereby it appeared, that Iesus was the stickler
or mediatour, that toke on hym the synnes of this worlde.
            
            This so strange and farre fetched a beginnyng, all men
did gape at so, chiefely the doctours there present, as
little lacked that they were not chaunged throughe astonnednesse

into stones as poetes feigne by Niobes.
            
            wheras I for my parte through laughter, had almoste
let goe a skape, as Priapus did for feare of the .li. witches
Canidia, and Sagana, whan it chaunced hym to
see their sorceries by night season: and who could haue
blamed me if I hadde so dooen? For whan didde euer
Demosthenes or Cicero, vse the lyke farre fetche
in any of theyr oracions? Thei toke that Proheme to
be faultie, whiche hunge not apliablie with the reste of
theyr matter: as who saieth, there be any man so grosse
that euin of nature is not instructed to dooe so muche.
            But my doctours now adaies take their preamble (so
they call it) to be most Rhetorical, whan it ioigneth lest
with any other part of theyr Theme: whiche maketh
the hearer, meruailyng at the estrangenesse of the deuise
oftentymes to murtre to him selfe, now whither the diuell
wilt thou. Thyrdly in stede of a narracion, they
expounde somewhat of the gospell, but that very briefely,
and shortely passed ouer, wheras they ought to entreate
therof onely, all theyr sermon through. In
the fourth place, fallyng as it were into a new mattier,
thei moue some doctorall question, sometyme suche as
toucheth neither heauen nor earth, whiche they take yet to
serue muche to theyr purpose. And here (loe) they beginne
to spreade theyr armes, in allegyng auctoritees
out of solemne doctours, subtile doctours, most subtile doctours,
seraphicall doctours, holy doctours, irrefragable doctours, and
suche other goodly bigge names of theyr Schole pillers.
And here thei spowte out theyr Syllogismes, theyr maiors,
minors, and conclusion, theyr corollaries, and
most balde supposicions, with suche other trifles before

the rude people, as if they were in theyr most ruffe
disputyng Pro, et contra in theyr Scholes. Resteth
now the fifte Acte or parte, wherein it behoueth
them to shew foorth all their cunnyng and profundi
                     •
                  ee.
Here now (maie chaunce) they come foorth with some
foolisshe tale taken out of Vitas patrum, or gesta Romanorum,
moralisyng the same bothe Allegorically,
Tropologically, and Anegogically. And thus muche
after this rate dooe they knitte vp all theyr Chimera,
or straunge shapen beast, with sundrier sortes of formes
and facions, than euer Horace described it, in the begiunyng
of his boke De arte poetica. But they
haue learned, I wotte neuer of whom, that the entrie
and beginnyng of an oracion must be caulmely vttred
without any lowde voyce, or exclamacion. So they
therfore beginne theyr preambles so stilly, as scarce
they can here theyr owne voices, perhaps because it auaileth
theim to speake somewhat, that none shoulde
vnderstande. They haue heard also how criyngꝭ
out must sometymes be vsed to moue vppe mens affections:
and therfore speakyng a pretie while all stilly, euin
at a brunt they fall into a skrekyng keie, and fill
mens eares with a criyng shrillenesse, where they haue
least nede at all. Moreouer because they haue redde
in Rhetorike bokes, that an Oracion shoulde somewhat
kindle, aud waxe hote in processe of argumentꝭ,
They, in euery part of theyr Sermons, the entrie into
the same beyng somewhat more demurely pronounced,
by and by dooe fall into a wonderous lowde chafyng
voyce, be the mattier they entreate of neuer so colde,
aud leaue of so, as if theyr brethes failed theim. Lastly

hauyng vnderstode, that Rhetoriciens geue certaine
preceptꝭ of laughter sterryng, they also peine theim selues
to enterlace theyr Sermons with some mery conceites:
but (O the will of god) how full of grace be the
same? and how aptly brought in theyr right places?
as if an asse were set to plaie on a gyttarne. Sometymes
also they fare as they woulde nippe folke with theyr
quippies, but so f
                  •
               inctly (god knoweth) as rather thei
dooe ticle, than pynche depelier. But neuer dooe thei
flatter more kyndly, than whan thei pretende to speake
most frely, and without respecte. Finally all theyr
cast in preachyng is suche, as a man wolde sweare thei
had gone to schole with these Ceretans, suche as in Italie
are wont in markette places standyng on stalles, or
where thei maie be seen best, to preache vnto the people
in commendacion of some pardone, feigned medecines,
or suche lyke toyes of theyr owne inuencion, to gette
money withall, and bleare the simples eies. Whiche
Ceretans natheles doe farre passe theim in theyr grace:
All be it (to speake indifferently) the one of theim is so
lyke the other, as none will doubt, but either they haue
learned at those, or those at these againe. But what
nede these my frier preachers to passe theron? seeyng
through my procurement thei neuer misse of suche, as in
hearyng theim, beleue verily they heare Demosthenes,
and Cireros matches:Merchanꝰtes and women. of whiche opinion chiefely be
merchauntꝭ, and good wiues, whose eares and likyng,
friers dooe wholy studie to satisfie. For merchauntes
in case they be handsomely glosed, are wonte to geue
theim in Commendum some porcion of theyr misgotten
goodꝭ, and women besides many other consideracions

are specially enclined to theim, for that they are
wont to poure into theyr bosomes what euer euill will
they beare in theyr hertes against theyr husbandꝭ.
            Thus, ye consider (I trow) how muche this race of
Religious men, is endebted vnto me, whan now with
theyr Ceremonies and fonde fantesies of theyr owne,
now with theyr baulyng and criyng out in pulpites,
they dooe exercise a maner tyrannie amongꝭ men, and
woulde be coumpted for more than Paules, or Antonies.
But seeyng they be suche iuglers, as can no lesse
vnkyndely dissemble, and seeme not to acknowlage my
benefites employed on theim, than they are otherwise
craftilie counterfetctours of holinesse, I holde it best
to speake no more of theim. For I longe sore a little
now to treate of kynges and princes liues,Kynges &amp; Princis. who most
plainely and gentilmanly, as gentilmen
                  •
                dooe enterteine
me. Wheras if thei considred well what belongeth
to theyr estates, now I see not what life might be
more carefull than theyrs, nor lesse to be desyred. For
suche shall neuer thinke that a kyngdome shoulde either
by vsurpacion, or any other wrongfull title be sought
for, as dooe waie with theim selues, what a charge he
susteigneth on his shoulders, that rightly will execute
the office of a prince: who takyng vpon him the rule of
thyngꝭ dooeth now administer not his owne, but rather
the affaires of many, wherby he shulde thinke of naught
els but the commen weale: obseruyng iustly the lawes,
wherof he is bothe founder, and ouerseer, to the ende
his vprightnesse, and integritee maie be a president to
his vnderrulers and officers, whan either beyng iuste
and vertuous, like a blisfull sterre of lucky aspecte he

maie bringe bothe health and coumfort to all his subiectes,
or otherwyse, lyke a pestilent Comete, be theyr
ruine and destruction. In as muche as meaner mennes
vices be not so muche marked, nor so largely diuu
                  •
               ged.
But a prince is set in that place, whereas if he wrie him
selfe neuer so little from that becometh hym, straight
waies the infection of the exemple crepeth contagiously
to many men. Besydes that, how muche more the
height of a princꝭ fortune maie be a meanes to peruert
hym from the right trade, either through pleasure, libertee,
adulacion, or delicatenesse, so muche the warelier
shoulde he resist theim, watchyng diligently, lest at
any tyme beyng seduced, he dooe swerue from his duitee.
And lastly (omittyng treasons, hatredꝭ, and other
perillꝭ or dreades, wherwith a prince is infested) if he
remembre how the dome also of the heighest, and most
rightfull kyng of all, hangeth ouer his head, who soone
after will call hym to accoumpte for the least faulte he
hath doen, yea and that the narowlier, the greater state
he had committed to hym: These thyngꝭ (I saie)
and many like hereto, if a prince do perpende wel, (and
perpende theim he must nedes if he hath wisedome) I
beleue surely he shoulde take his slepe and fode, with
lesse gladnesse, than a farre meaner person dooeth.
            But now, how many princꝭ haue you, whiche through
my procurement, remittyng all care and charge hereof
to the goddꝭ, dooe for the most parte onely tende theyr
owne pleasure? So that admitte we feigne now the
image of some one prince, suche as not seeldome hath
been, a man (for exemple) vnskilled in the lawes, enemie
in a maner to the commen weale, geuin onely to his

peculier profite, addicted all to voluptuousnesse, an hater
of learnyng, an hater of libertee, and of the trueth,
caryng nothyng lesse than for the aduauncement of his
countrey, but rather appliyng all thyngꝭ to his owne
pleas
                  •
               s
                  •
               e and commoditee. And now (on gods name)
geue hym a chayne about his necke,The apparaile of a prince. for token that all
vertues woulde agreablie be euchayned in hym: geue
hym also a crowne frette with perle and stone, in signe
he ought to excelle others in all princely vertues: than a
sceptre in his hand betokennyng iustice with an vpright
mynde on all sydes: lastly a Robe of purpre, whiche signifieth
zeale and feruent affection towarde his subiectes:
This maner apparaile (I saie) if that prince
shulde duely conferre with his liuyng, I wene he wold
be ashamed to weare it, fearyng lest some fine expositor
myght tourne all his pompe and solemuesse of royall
robes into a derision: namely whan he hath no maner
part of a prince in hym, sauyng-onely the clothyng.
            Now lykewyse what saie you to Courtiers?
               Courtiers. these minion
gaibeseen gentilmen, who beyng for the most part
as fawnyng, as seruile, as witlesse, and as abiect as
can be deuised, woulde be taken yet amongꝭ all men for
the principall. But although theyr pride in other
poynctꝭ excedeth, yet herein surely they shew a great
modestee, whan beyng contented to haue theyr bodies
outwardly garmsshed with golde, with gemmes, with
silkes, and with other representacious of vertue and
wysedome, they geue ouer the studie, and vse of the
thyngꝭ selfe to other men, not caryng how they leaue
theyr myndes naked, without any apparaile of disciplines:
reputyng theim selues moste happie, for that

they haue learned the phrase of courte speche, at euery
woorde to choppe in these goodly titles of honour, your
noble grace, your royall hieghnesse, your excellent maiestee:
and that theyr faces lyke visers will blusshe at nothyng:
and finally that in bourdyng, and in flyryng,
thei can flatter pleasauntly. For these be the qualitees
they holde most mere for a kynde gentilman, and
rufler of the courte. But nowe who so narowlier
woulde approche, and enserche theyr trade of liuyng,
shoulde fynde theim I warrant you, to be more blunte
and vnwittie, than euer were the auncient people of
Phoeacia, and thereto more dissolute than those wowers
were that desyred Penelopes in mariage. Sponsi

                  . ye know what foloweth in the verse, whiche
I had rather that Eccho (as she euer doeth the later
woordes) shoulde declare vnto you, than I.
            These my hoglyngꝭ slepe euery daie till midnoone, and
hauyng euin yet theyr eies full of slepe, thei sende than
for some huntyng chapleine, who whiles thei are in makyng
ready, or rather risyug out of theyr beddꝭ, maie
slynge theim vp a post masse. In the necke whereof
commes theyr breakefast, and that scantly finisshed, go
they to diner. After that to the dyse, to tables, to cardes,
or to boules, nowe with iesters, nowe with fooles,
now with courtisanes, daunces, and daliauncꝭ to trifle
out the tyme, not without one, or two collacions afore
supper, and after supper theyr bankettꝭ one vpon
an other. And thus without felyng any tediousnesse
of theyr life, thei passe easily ouer, bothe houres, daies,
monthes, yeres, and whole ages. In sort that I my
selfe am not seeldome throughe hauntyng with theim

made the fatter, and gladly woulde neuer part company,
sauyng that sometyme seyng how amonges the damoysels
and Madames of the court, they shew theim
selues in theyr mastresses colours, and commenly dooe
vaunt theim selues of that they haue not, or neuer did,
I can not kepe my selfe from laughter. Moreouer seyng
how amongꝭ those Nymphes and Madames, eche
reputeth hir selfe the more woorthie of honour and estate,
the longer taile she traineth after hir. Seeyng
also how the gentilmen of the court dooe shoue one an
other, aud prease for a shew of estimacion to be nexte
theyr prince, as who saieth depeliest in his fauour. And
seyng lastly how thei stande in theyr owne conceite, muche
estemyng theim selues, as the more worthy a cappe
and reuerence, the greatter chaynes thei haue, as if thei
desyred not onely to shew their richesse in wearyng thē,
but also theyr strength of shoulders in bearyng theim.
But now (on goddꝭ halfe) lenger than of late daies,
Pope holie fathers of Rome, Skarlet cardinals, and
blessyng bishops,
               Cardinals 
                     •
                   bishops. haue not onely folowed the steppes
of princes, as touchyng theyr pompe and magnificence,
but dooen also what they can to surpasse theim. Yet
surelie if a bishop perpended with hym selfe, what is
ment by the linen rochet so purely of white that he weareth?
Mary that his liuyng likewise shoulde be nete,
and cleane from any spotte of sinne:The apparaile of a bishop. Or if he thought
thus, that his mytre beyng deuided so into two hornes,
eche typpe wherof is with the lyke knobbe gathered together,
were set for a figure of the perfect knowlage he
ought to haue bothe in the olde and new Testament:
Or if he wiste that the gloues on his handꝭ did signifie,

how he ought as purely, and without any soyle of
woordlinesse to administer the sacramentꝭ: Aud how
his crossers staffe admonished him of the wakery charge
he shoulde take ouer his flocke: And how his crosse
borne before hym (be he an archebishop) pretended victorie
ouer all woordlie affections: These figures
(I saie) and many lyke hereto, in case a bishop did conster
&amp; conferre accordyngly, I beleue he could not chose
but leade an heauie and carefull life: Yea but at these
bais (I can tel you) thei take as little thought herefore,
as all theyr thought is how they maie fayre fede theim
selues, remittyng all care of theyr flocke vnto Christe,
or rather resignyng the same to suche as they call their
vicares, and Suffragans. In whiche case they remembre
little theyr name. For Episcopus, is as muche to
saie, as a superintendent or wacheman, who vus
                  •
               ly tended
and toke hede to his charge and commission.
            How be it (in dede) as touchyng fisshyng for money,
and heapyng vp of treasour baggꝭ, they furnisshe fully
that theyr names importeth, and therin shew theim selues
to be no blinde wachemen. Moreouer, if
Cardinals likewise did consider (seyng thei chalenge to
succede in the apostles places) how at theyr handꝭ also
is requyred that sanctitee and perfection, that the apostles
were of: And further, how they are no lordꝭ,
but rather stewerdꝭ and administratours of spirituall
giftes and graces, for the whiche soone after they must
duely and exactly render accoumpte:The apparaile of cardinals. Yea if they did
but argue a whyle vnto theim selues vpon theyr garmentꝭ,
and thinke thus: Pardie the whitenesse, and
pure netenesse of this rochet I weare on, signifieth how

I also shoulde leade a pure and ryght innocent life.
            This cramoysen gow
                  •
               e, whiche I haue vnderneth it,
admonissheth me I shoulde be as feruently enflamed in
the loue of god. This vtter robe also beyng so large
and so longe trained, as suffiseth to ouerspred myne, the
most reuerende fathers moyle, were she as lofty as any camell,
doeth it not pretende, that charitee shulde abouisd,
and be so largely spreadde in me, as I shoulde offre my
selfe to helpe and releue all men? be it in teachyng, exhortyng,
coumfortyng, rebukyng, or aduerrisyng my euen
Christen: or be it in appeasyng of watres betwene
countreis, or resistyng of wicked princꝭ, yea or in spendyng
of my bloudde for Christes sake, muche more my
worldly goodꝭ with a gladde hert: How be it I see not
by reason, what I shoulde dooe with worldly goodꝭ, I,
that take vpon me wholy to imitate and represent the
apostles, who like good soules went poorely aud barefooted.
These thyngꝭ (I saie) if Cardinals did consider
aud take well to hert, they wolde not gape so gredily
after that dignitee, naie willynglier woulde refuse
it, or at lest, as did the Primitiue apostles, leade a trauailsome
and carefull life, in attendyng to their offices.
Moreouer if these thrise holy fathers,Bishops of Rome. 
               Popes of Rome
and Christes vicares (as they name theim selues) did
as eruestly folow the exemple of Christes life, in enbracyng
of pouertee, or peinefull teachyng of the people,
or in bearyng of his crosse, and contempt of this world,
or if they didde but thynke a while vppon the name of
Pope, whiche they chalenge peculierly, and is as muche
to saie, as father, or the title of most holy father, as thei

to deale in bribes to the Cardinals for their voices: or
hauyng ones purchased that roume with theyr pennie,

shoulde folow, whan therby the princꝭ selfe, and pillers
of the churche, yea the verie Lampes (on gods name)
whiche light the worlde, shoulde be called backe againe
to a bagge and a staffe? wheras els thei haue founde out
so good a shyfte, and conueighance, what euer labour or
toyle belongeth to theyr offices, to cast it wholy on Peter
and Paules shoulders, who haue leysour enough to
welde it, whiles they maie so good chepe reserue vnto
theim selues all the pleasure and commoditees of the
same? wherby it cometh to passe, and all through my
drifte, that no kynde of men lyue more delicately, nor
with lesse care than these holy fathers dooe. For as
for Christ, he (thei thynke) maie easily enough be pleased,
so long as thei shew them selues like popes in their
Misticall Pontificalibus, bolstred vp with ceremonies,
aud titles of blissednes, reuerendnes, and sanctitee,
to blisse and curse whom thei liste: what for the rest, it
is stale with theim, and out of vse at these daies to doe

myracles: peynefull, to teache the people scholerlyke,
to expounde scripture: to ydle a thyng, to praie: farre
more milkesoplyke and womannisshe, to cast foorth teares:
vile, to be nedie: dishonourable, to be ouercome:
and most vnsittyng for theim who scantly will admitte
kyngꝭ and emperours to the kyssyng of theyr feete:
            Finally it is an vnsauoury thyng, to die: and as reprocheable,
to be hanged on the crosse: So that refusyng
to stande to any of these harde condicions, thei rest
onely vpon feates of armes, with also those sugred and
doulcet benedictions of theirs, mencioned by Paule,
with a thousande wherof I wene they woulde parte
more liberally, than with one pennie: and sticke hardily
to theyr interdictions, suspencions, aggrauacions,
redaggrauacions, anathemisacions, and peincted pictures
set vp in churches, representyng suche as thei note
for cursed, or heretikes, with also that theyr dredefull
thunderbolt of excommunicacion, the dynt wherof at
theyr onely becke is hable to dyng downe sely soules a
thousande myles beyonde the depest dongeon in hell:
whiche thunderbolt they leuell yet against no men so
vehemently, as against those, who through the diuelles
instinction dooe go about to croppe Peters patrimonie:
               Peters patrimonie,
whiche (for all Peters owne woordes in the gospell,
Lorde, we haue lefte all to folow the) they expounde to be
landes, citees, taxes, customes, and dominions. For maintenaunce
wherof whiles kyndled with the feruent zeale
of Christ, they fight bothe with sworde, and with fyre,
than they wene they dooe gaily, and apostolically defende
Christes espouse the churche, in rebuttyng and manfully
(as they saie) forchasyng of hir enemies. As who

saieth, there be any enemies more pernicious to Christꝭ
churche, than wicked bishops theim selues? who suffre
Christes name for lacke of theyr daiely remembring,
to grow out of the peoples knowlage: &amp; do binde Christ
to certaine money lawes of theyr owne: and with wrested
gloses and exposicions dooe bastard him: and lastly
through the abhominable president of theyr life doe
eftesoones crucifie hym. In sort, that wheras Christes
churche was fyrst founded vpon the bloudde of him
hir autour, and reised vp with the bloudde of the apostles,
and enlarged with the bloud of so many martyrs:
now, as though Christ were no Christ, or that he were
not hable as before to conserue his chosen, they in hir
defence dooe trie theyr quarels onely at the swoordes
poincte. That wheras warre (to speake absolutely)
is so cruell and despiteous a thyng, as rather it becometh
wilde beastꝭ, than men, therto so furious and rageyug,
as the verie Poetes doe feigne, that the Furies
of hell dooe let is slippe: also so pestilent a thyng, as
draweth for traine all frothe and corrupcion of maners
after it: Further so vniust a thyng, as for the moste
parte is best executed by the veriest theues and distressours
that be: and lastly so vnchristian a thyng, as in nothyng
accordeth with Christe. Yet dooe these my Romyshe
prelates, settyug all other thyngꝭ a syde, onely
studie and employe their tyme on warre. In whiche
exercise ye shall see some of theim beyng so olde and
wasted, that theyr bones rattle in theyr skinnes, so liuely
yet turmoylyng, and pronely bent therto, as if they
were waxen younge againe: neyther sparyng for coste,
nor weried through labours, ne any thyng grudged in

mynde or agaste at it, though therby all lawes, religion,
peace, and tranquillitee in humaine thyngꝭ be tourned
topsetturuie. For woorke they neuer so vngodly,
yet faile they not of some glosers learned men, who in
hope of promocion, will name and expounde this theyr
open madnesse to bee a Zeale, to be a Pietie, to bee a
Spirituall manhode in them, bringyng it by a new found
meanes to passe, that now a man maie thrust his swoord
into his brothers bealy, obseruyng neuerthelesse that
loue and perfite charitee, whiche Christe byddeth eche
Christian to owe an other. And truely I am as yet in
doubte, whether bishops in Almaine haue geuin, or rather
taken exemple hereat: seyng that somewhat plainelier,
and without any obseruaunce at all, vsed either in their
wede, or blissyng, with suche lyke ceremonies as bishops
woulde be knowen by, they dooe plainely shewe
theim selues to be temporall princꝭ, in sort that in a maner
they coumpt it vilitee for theim to yelde theyr valiaunt
soules to God, any where els than in a foughten
fielde. And now, dooe not syngle priestes
               Priestes, (trow ye)
clinge as nere as they can to theyr prelates deuocion?
for (loe) how warlyke bothe with swoordes, with stanes,
and with stones, yea and by the teeth also the good
vicares can striue for theyr tytherightꝭ? and how narowly
loke thei to finde in olde writte or in doctours, any
sentence seruyng for theyr purpose, to geue terrour
therby to theyr simple parissheners, yea and beare them
downe, that thei ought to paie more than theyr tenthes
limitted. But for all theyr diligence in that behalfe,
they are as indiligent remembrers what is written in
many places of scripture concernyng theyr duities, and

what they on the other part ought to render and re
                  •
               paie
vnto the people. No not theyr shauen crownes at lest
can warne theim, howe priestes muste be free from all
worldlinesse, to passe on nothyng els, sauyng heauenly
treasure. But sooner at these daies my Iolie sir Iohns
doe take it for a sufficient furniture of their roomes, as
longe as they mumble ouer theyr portes seruice, thei care
not how rasshely, whiche (on my faith) I wonder what
god heareth, or vnderstandeth? seeyng they theim selues
dooe almost neither heare, nor wote what they saie,
whan onely with theyr lippes thei make a certaine buszyng,
no whitte procedyng from the hert. How be
it (to saie the trouthe) it is a commen tatche naturally
geuin to all men as well as priestꝭ, to watche well for
theyr owne lucre: for none is so vnskilfull, that in this
poinct can not skanne the lawes to the vttermost. But
in case there be any waight or charge thereon dependyng,
that the clergie hath politikely learned to cast on
others shoulders. For like as princes are wont to
ordeine vnder theim many Deputies and officers, who
likewyse dooe substitute Subdeputies in theyr steedes,
so dooeth the Clergie of theyr goodnesse and singuler
modestee, remitte all care of holinesse to the laie people,
and laie folke charge suche therwith as thei call Ecclesiasticall
or churchemen, as who saieth all maner Christians
had not to dooe with the churche, or as if thei professed
no suche thyng by theyr fyrst vowe of Baptisme.
Than againe priestꝭ that are named Seculers, as dedicate
to the worlde and not to Christ, dooe laie all this
burden on reguler priestꝭ, who likewyse tourne it ouer
to Religious men, and religious men of an easier rule

commende the same to those of a straighter rule. But
all with one assent dooe can theyr charge on Friers neckes,
who natheles finde a meanes yet to conueigh the
same to monkes of the charterhouse, in whiche onely order,
holinesse as in hir graue lyeth hydden, yea and so hydden,
as scant at any tyme she can be seen. Likewise
holy fathers of Rome in tendre consideracion of the
daiely businesse, wherwith thei are occupied about their
money haruest, are faine to put bishops in trust with all
other too too Apostolike labours. But bishops disdeigne
not through humilitee to let persones supplie theyr roomes:
And persones like good felowes wolde theyr vicares
shoulde haue the dooyng therof: Than vicares
sticke not to suffre friers to encroche vpon theim: And
they againe make resignement therof, to suche as daiely
dooe shere the woulle of Christes poore flocke.
            But (hola) it is best for me to stoppe here, seyng I toke
not vpon me to boult out the maner of bishops and priestes
liuynges now a daies: lest any man shoulde deme

as if she crammed the same into theyr mouthes whiles
they are slepyng. Ye remembre (I trow) what

the Atheniens, whose good happe and successe in thinges
gaue fyrst place to this prouerbe, Slepe he neuer so
fast, his nette catcheth for hym. (For ye shall vnderstande,
that of his continual prosperous fortune peincters toke
occasion to pourtray his image slepyng, and fortune in

in beggery and necessitee, and fedde with smoke, leadyng
foorth theyr tymes as vnregarded, vnestemed, and vnaccepted.Fooles obtaine promocions before wise men.
Wheras my fooles on the other syde dooe
flow in richesse and promocions, and for short doe flourisshe
on all sydes. For surely, and if ye coumpt it
no small parcell of felicitee to stande in good grace with
great men, and liue familiarly amongꝭ those my golden
gods: now I see not what wisedome can auaile you, nay
rather how it shoulde not muche disprofite you, seeyng
they for the most parte beyng vnlerned, doe reproue lernyng,
as that they know not. Or if Rychesse be to
be sought for, I praie you what gaine can the merchant
haue, whan as wysedome biddeth, his conscience at any
tyme shoulde stagger at a false othe, or beyng taken
with a plaine lie, he did blusshe therat, or set but a barly
corne by all those grudgeyng doubtes, that wysemen
put vpon thefte and vserie. Moreouer, who so
gapeth after spiritual dignitees and promocions, (as there
be rauins enough that watche for suche carein) let hym
thinke that an asse or a cowherde shall sooner be aduanced
to the same than any wyse, or learned man. Than
in case thou estemest womens loue and daliaunce (whiche

that Maister Sage be shutte out of the dores, and sooner

let in any maner beast than him. Finally, what euer
side ye tourne you to, be it to Prelates, to Princes, Iudges,
Rulers, friendes, or enemies, all thyng is gotten
for money,Moneys force. whiche like as a wiseman despiseth, so I
thinke it be, because he can not come by it, it standeth
so farre from his reache, as if the foxe would eate no grapes.
Well, all be it there be no ende nor measure
of my praises, yet it must behoue me at last to make
an ende of my talke, I will leaue therfore. So that
fyrst I maie briefely touche vnto you, how I want not

perchaunce ye might iudge, that foolisshely I stande in
myne owne conceite, or lawiers myght vse cauillacions
against me, saiyng, I alleged no bokes for my prouffe.
Goe to therfore, let vs allege somewhat for our selfe,

                  . So fyrst I saie, that none will denie
this olde sawe to be true, how wheras the thyng selfe
wanteth, there it is best at lest to countrefaict the same, wherupon
younge children that goe to schole, haue for one of
theyr fyrst lessons this verse of Cato taught them, whiche
saieth: It is most wysedome for a man in place to countrefaicte
Folie. Now therfore I praie you consider with
your selues, how great a weale and benefite must Folie
in deede be, wheras the countrefaictyng and shadowe
onely of the same, deserueth so muche praise at learned
men. Amongꝭ whom myne owne good Horace, as a
fatte and fayre fedde hoglyng of Epicures herde, aduiseth
men to myngle Folie with their graue counsailes, (all be
it the addicion he maketh of short Folie, was not all of

the cunnyngest.) Also in an other place he saieth, It is
a sweete thyng to be a foole whan place requyreth: And than
againe he confesseth, he had rather be holden for a foole and
an Ideote, than beyng wyse, to be barked at, and bytten of euerie
bodie. And Homer likewyse, wheras in all condicions
he praiseth and commendeth Telemachus, yet in
dyuers places he is wont to call hym childisshe and imprudent,
whiche name these writers of Tragedies dooe
gladly for a token of good lucke geue to boyes, and
stripelyngꝭ. But for Gods sake, what is els conteigned
in Homers whole Poesie of the sacred boke called Ilias,
saue onely the contencious debates of foolisshe kynges,
and foolisshe people? wherby it appeareth, that all the world
is full of fooles, as Cicero saied rightly, in whiche so few
woordes he gaue me as absolute and ample a praise,The worth full of foo

                   les. as
myght be. For who is he that knoweth not the value
and goodnesse of a thyng to be the more acceptable, the
largelier and more copiously that the same is spread into
all partes? But it maie be (ye will saie) that Christen
men geue no credence to these painem autours:Auctoritees out of scripture for folie. in

            Next than because I take a great charge in hand, and it
were no good maner to call the Muses eftesoones from
theyr fountaine of Helicon, to come backe so great a
iourney as is from thence hither, namely for a mattier
smally perteignyng to theyr facultee, peraduenture it
were better wisshed of me, whiles I plaie the Doctresse

of diuinitee, and passe through these brambles, that the
soule of Duns woulde a little leue Sorbone College,
aud enter into my brest, be he neuer so thornie, and fuller
of pricles than is any vrcheon, to departe againe
whan I haue dooen ones, and if he list to the galowes.
            
            That woulde god I myght proprely take a new conutenance,
and were cladde in a doctourlike apparaile: sauyng
I feare lest some of you woulde laie thefte to my

Diuinitee without boke. But haue ye no meruaile
though my continuall and daiely conuersacion amonges
doctours, maketh me to beare awaie some one woorde
or other: seyng the fygtree image of Priapus coulde in processe
of tyme, as his maister redde Homer, marke and
remembre some Greke vocables. And likewyse Lucyans
cocke throughe longe continuaunce and conuersyng
amongꝭ men, did learne so perfectly theyr speche.
But now (ou gods name) to our mattier: Salomon
the Ecclesiaste writeth in his fyrste chapitre, that the
noumbre of fooles is infinite. Now where he speaketh of
an infinite noumbre, is it not as muche, as if he comprehended
all men therin, sauyng onely a certaine, so
few, as I can not tell if at any tyme they were seen at
all? Muche more expressely dooeth Ieremie confesse
the same: for eche man (saieth he) is made a foole in his
owne wysedome: So onely vnto God he loweth wysedome,
and assigneth folie for peculier vnto all men.
            Than againe a little abou
                  •
                that, he would no man shuld
glorie in his owne wysedome: and why so mine owne good
Ieremie? Fo

                  so

                  the (will he saie) for that man 
                     •
                  ath no

wysedome at all. But to retourne againe to the Ecclesiaste.
what ment he (trow ye) by his protestacion, when
he lowdely cried out so, Vanitee of vanitees, and all is vanitee?
what? but (as afore I saied) that this humaine
life is naught but a certaine great plaie of Folie? confirming
(as who saieth) that noble sentence of Cicero 
               
                  •
               
little afore recited, how all this world is full of fooles. Moreouer,
where the other wyse Ecclesiasticus saied, A foole
changeth like the moone, but a wiseman abydeth in one state as the
sonne? what signified he els hereby? but that mankynd
is altogethers foolisshe, and God onely deserueth the
name of wisedome. For ye shall vnderstand, that by the
moone (accordyng to the exposicion of doctours) is figured
mankynde: and by the sonne, whiche is the head
and fountaine of all light, is ment god him selfe the father,
and originall of all sapience. Wherunto this maketh
greatly, that Christ hym selfe in the gospell, denied
any man ought to be called good; sauyng god hym selfe.
            
            Now therfore if euery man that is not wyse, muste be
holden for foolishe, aud who so euer is good, is wife also,
(accordyng as the Stoikes do affyrme) than per consequeut
ye must nedes confesse, that mortall men are altogethers
wrapped in the bandes of Folie. Furthermore,
Salomon in his .xxv. chapitre saieth: Folie maketh
fooles gladde: wherin he confesseth plainely, that nothyng
in this life can be sweete or pleasant, vnlesse that
folie yelde the same vnto you: and hereunto maketh
that saieyng also: who exhorteth you to wysedome, exhorteth
you to sorow: and in muche vnderstandyng, is muche indignacion:
and doeth not this noble preacher plainly confirme
the same, saiyng in his .vii. chapitre: That the hert of a

wyseman is wheras sorow is, and the hert of a foole wheras gladnesse
is. Therfore Salomon thought it not sufficient to
consume time about the knowlage of wysedome, vnlesse
he further shoulde busie hym selfe to know me also.
            That in case ye smally beleue myue, marke I praie you
his owne woordꝭ in the fyrst chapitre: And I haue applied
my hert (saieth he) to know wysedome and learnyng,
and lykewyse to know errours and folie: wherin ye must note
this well, how it maketh muche for my dignitee, that he
putteth folie in the latter place, namely seyng the Ecclesiaste,
or churche preacher wrote it, and pardie ye
know how the church ordre willeth, that who so is first
in dignitee, shall goe last in place, to the ende, that how
euer in other poinctes, yet herein at lest he dooe obserue
the precepte of the gospell. But folie to be farre more
noble and excellent than wisedome, I wene I can proue
you by witnesse of the Ecclesiasticus, who so euer was
autour of that boke in the .xliiii. chapitre of the same:
whose text surely I holde it not best to recite vnto you,
before ye somewhat shall haue ayded the induction of
myne argument, with aunswearyng handsomely vnto
me, lyke as Plato introduceth those that dispute with
Socrates to dooe. So fyrst I demaunde of you, what
thyngꝭ to your iudgement ought soonest to be kept close
and hydden, other those that are precious and rare to be
gotten, or other that are vile &amp; dogchepe in euery place?
dooe you holde your peace? Now surely how euer ye
woulde dissemble, yet shall this olde greke prouerbe answeare
for you: the waterpotte is sette behynde euerie dore:

so madde, to leue golde or precious stones in the hiegh
waie: naie rather ye laie theim vp in your most secrete
closettꝭ, and yet, that snot uffisyng, ye double locke them
in the strongest coffers ye haue, wheras durt ye leue liyng
still on the dunghill. Ergo, if that be hydden,
that is more precious, and the other vile thyngꝭ are left
abrode as vntended to, is it not manifest now, that wisedome
whiche he forbyddeth to be hydden, is farre more
vile than folie, whiche muste accordyng to his rede be
locked vp and kept as close as maie be? And now I am
content to reherce you his owne woordꝭ, (whiche are)
Better is the man that hydeth his folie, than he who hydeth his
wysedome. But what saie you to this that scripture attributeth
to fooles a certaine benignitee, and gentill
whitenesse of nature, condemnyng wysemen for proude
and despisours of all others saue theim selues? For so
dooe I plainely take the meanyng of the Ecclesiaste in
the .x. chapitre. But a foole (saieth he) that walketh in
the strete, beyng hym selfe vnwise, supposeth all men to be fooles
as he. Now is it not (I praie you) a signe of an excedyng
gentilnesse in hym to make euery body his matche
and felow? that wheras none so base wil not meanely
stande yet in selfe reputacion, his curtesie is suche to
dele euery man a fleese of his praise. Therfore Salomon
beyng so great a kynge, was naught ashamed of
my name whan he saied in his .xxx. chapitre, I am most
foole of all men: Nor Paule doctour of the gentiles thought
scorne therof, when writing to the Corinthians he said:
I speake it as vnwise, that I more than others. &amp;c. as who

saieth it were a great dishonour for him to be ouercome
in folie. But here (loe) me thynkꝭ I heare how I am
hissed at by some of these greke professours, who study
scripture in that tounge, and make as though other doctours
at these daies saw nothyng, nomore than crowes
dooe whan their eies ar peckt out, whiles with certaine
Annotacions of their owne, they goe about to duske
mens eies as with smoke, amongꝭ whiche sorte of notemakers,
my friende Erasmus, whom often for honours
sake and good will I dooe mencion, maie be counted the
seconde, if not the fyrst. They (like enough) will reproue
me, and (ô) what a foolisshe allegacion is this (will
they saie)? and how mete a witnesse for dame Folie to bringe
in? wheras the apostles meanyng is farre otherwyse, than she
dreameth it to be: for in these woordes he wolde not be taken for
more foole than other, but whan he had saied, They are ministers
of Christ, and so am I also, to the ende yet he shuld not be holden
for a vainglorious vaunter in that he made him selfe coequall with
the other, he added as by correction, I more than other, signifiyng
therby, how not onely he was matche to the other apostles,
but somewhat also their superiour: whiche althoughe he woulde
shoulde be taken for verie trueth, yet lest the arrogant auowyng
therof might partly haue offended mens 
                     •
                  ares, he did first shelde
the same with the pretexte of Folie, (saiyng) I speake it as the
vnwyser, because he wist what priuilege fooles haue to speake
trouthe without offence. Well, what euer Paule mente
whan he wrote thus, I leaue hardly to theim to dispute

                  〈◊〉
               : because I will ynglier dooe folow the auctoritee of
other grosse and fatte doctours, who amonges vulgar
folke, are in greatest reputacion, so farfoorth as a great
part of learned men also had leuer (by god) for more

suretie be deceiued with theim, than iudge vpon righter
knowlage with these studiers of the scripture in the thre
toungꝭ. For no man setteth more by these smatterers in
the Greke tounge, than thei wold do by as many chatteryng
iaes: chiefely seyng that a certaine glorious doctour,
whose name I dooe suppresse for the nones,Nicola
                     ••
                   de Lyra. leste
els these iaies woulde chatter this greke taunt against
hym, An asse to the harpe, doeth in expoundyng bothe magistrally
and theologically this selfe same texte from
this poincte forwarde, I more than others, make it to be
the head of a new sentence, puttyng also a new clefte
and diuision in the same, whiche sure he coulde neuer
haue dooen, without a wonderous conueighance of Logike.
But for more plainesse I will repete vnto you his
owne woordes, not onely in forme, but also in matter,
(as scholemen saie): And this was his exposicion. I
speake it as the more vnwise, that is to saie (quod he) in case
I seeme vnwise vnto you because I doe coequall my selfe vnto the
false apostles, than more vnwise will you coumpt me, in auauncyng
my selfe afore theim. Neuerthelesse this goodly e
                  •
               
               positour
not muche bynethe that, as if he had forgotten
him selfe, falleth quite into an other sense. But wherabout
goe I now? Shall I stande to one onely exemple
in my defence,Holy 
                     〈◊〉
                   likened to a Cheuere
                     •
                   skynne. seyng all doctours take it commenly
for theyr priuilege, to streche out heauen (that is to saie)
holy writte lyke a cheuerell skynne? Seyng also how
in Paules epistles, the woordꝭ of scripture fare as if
they were of contrary senses, wheras beyng set in their
right places, they doe varie neuer a dele, if we geue credite
to Hierome. For whan Paule saw at Athenes an
Altare dedicate to the Goddꝭ, the entitlyng wherof he

thought good to bringe in for a prouffe and corroboracion
of the Christen beleefe, leauyng all the rest that made
against his purpose, he toke onely the two latter woordes
of the same, (which were these) to the vnknowne god,
yet in some parte he was content to chaunge theim to:
for the whole superscripcion was set vp in this maner.
            
               To the gods of Asia, Euro
                     •
                  a, and Africa, to the vnknowne, and
estraunge Gods. So vpon this exemple of Paule I
wene it procedeth, that commenly at these daies my faire
broode of doctours do enterprise to nippe of here and there,
foure or fiue woordꝭ of the whole, yea and those some
thyng altered and corrupted (if it stande theim vpon) to
applie the same so botched together to theyr owne sense
and commoditee, how euer that that goeth before, and
that that foloweth, dooeth nothyng serue to purpose,
or rather make clea
                  •
               e against them. Whiche their saied
iugglyng they conueigh yet by so happie an vnshamefastnesse,
as in this poinct Ciuilians haue cause oftentymes
to enuie doctours of diuinitee, whan now in Allegacions
nothyng makyng for the mattier, they bee so
farre passed by theim. For I praie you (of friendship)
tell me, what thyng maie be to harde for these doctours
to bringe about? seeyng how that great aforesaied doctour
(I had almost blabbed foorth his name againe,
but I feare me I tell you of the greke adage) coulde
draw out of Lukes woordes, the construction of a sentence
nomore agreable vnto Christes meanyng therin,
than fyre is with water? For Christe whan the imminent
daunger of his death aproched, what tyme, or neuer,
it becometh good seruauntꝭ most constantly to take
theyr maisters part, and defende hym to theyr powers,

as confederates in league dooe one for an other, to the
ende yet he myght driue all confidence in suche maner
defence out of his Apostles hertꝭ, axed of theim, whether
thei wanted ought, what tyme he sent theim foorth so barely
without any maner prouision, not geuyng theim so muche as
shoes to saue their feete from thornes and stones, nor yet a wallet
to put their meate in? wherunto whan thei had aunswerd, that
thei lacked nothyng: But now (quod he) who so of you hath
a wallette, let him self it, and his bagge also, yea and who so hath
not, make he sale at lest of his cote, to bie him a swoorde. Now
wheras it is manifest enough, that all Christes doctrine
pretendeth naught but mekenesse, pacience, and contempte
of this mortall lyfe, whiche of you perceiueth
not, what he ment in this place? For I take it plainely
that he saied thus, to geue his Ambassadours the Apostles,
the better courage, to the ende that they not onely
shoulde set no store by shoes, nor by vitailyng bagges,
but should cast awaie theyr cotes also, the nemblier and
more deliuerly to goe about theyr charge and commission
of the gospell preachyng, prouidyng theim selues
of naught els but onely a sworde, not that sworde that
theues and murderers dooe occupie, but the swoorde of
the sprite, beyng whetted all on Charitee, whose poinct
perseth into the inwarde partꝭ of mans hert, and cutteth
all flesshely affections thence, so clene, as naught remaineth
sauyng pietie, and ardent loue towardes god.
But marke ye now (of felowship) how warlyke this
famous doctour wresteth the plaine &amp; clere sence hereof.
For by the swoorde (saieth he) is ment defence against
persecucion: and by the wallette is vnderstode competent prouision
we shoulde make of thynges necessarie to liue withall. As

who saieth, Christes mynde were chaunged, because
hym seemed that he sent foorth his Ambassadours not
halfe royally furnisshed, and therfore did recant here,
and call backe his fyrst Instructions geuin theim. Or
as if he had here forgotten those woordes, whiche afore
he spake vnto theim with suche a vehemencie, ye shal be
blissed whan ye be persecuted withall kynde of oultrage and turment,
but make ye no resistence against those euisses ye shall suffer:
for blissed be the meke in sprite, not those that are fierce, and
stubb
                     •
                  urne herted. Or as if it were quite out of his remembrauce,
that in other places he likeneth them to sparowes,
and lilies, as touching the small care that thei shuld
take for theyr liuyng. Now, so muche lacked that he
would haue theim goe weponlesse, as rather thei shulde
sell theyr cotes from theyr backes to bie the same: and
sooner goe naked, than without a swoorde by theyr side.
Moreouer lyke as vnder the name of Swoorde (as he
expoundeth it) all maner of defence is conteigned, that maie repell
iniurie, and violence, so vnder the name of bagge, is comprised
what euer prouision is made to liue withall. And thus
(loe) this depe expositour of Gods will and meanyng
setteth foorth the apostles complete armed, with iauelins,
bowes and arowes, slinges, and haulfe hakes, to
preache the gospell, and Christes crosse. Ladyng them
moreouer with great males, and paniers well stuffed
with vitailes, lest els perchaunce they might sometyme
departe from theyr innes vndyned. No not so muche
as this, myght any thyng moue this gaie learned man,
that Christ hym selfe shortly after rebukyng Peter biddeth
the swoorde shoulde be put vp againe, whiche afore he
commaunded so ernestly to be bought: and that it neuer

was hearbe how the apostles did at any tyme occupie
sworde and buckler, to resist theyr aduersaries violence,
whiche nathelesse they woulde not haue sticked to dooe,
in case that Christes meanyng in these aforesaied woordes
had been suche, as he expoundeth it to be.
            There is an other doctour likewyse of no lesse reputacion
than this former, but for honours sake I name hym
not, who interpretyng a place of Abacuc the prophete,
where he saieth, The skinnes of the lande of Madian shall be
disparcled and torne asunder: nothing consideryng that the
Prophete spake of the M

for the fielde, whiche were made of beastes skinnes, as
aunciently men in warrefare vsed, writeth plainly, that
Abacuc did prophecy there of the fleayng of Sainct Barthelmeus
skynne. I my selfe not longe agoe
                  •
               
was present (as many times I am wont to be) at a certaine
disputacion, where dyuers doctours were assembled.
There whan one of them by chance had put forth
a question, by what auctoritee of scripture heretikes ought sooner
to be coumptrolled by the fire, than confuted by argumentes?
An other auncient father, that satte by hym, beyng so
crabbed faced, as onely the complexion of his hangyng
browes might tell you straight he was maister doctour,
aunswerde in a great cholere, that Paule him selfe was
the fyrst ordeigner of that lawe, wheras in one of his
epistles it is redde, Haereticum hominem post vnam et
alteram correptionem deuita (But I axe perdone at
your delicate eares, because I can not otherwise than
in the latine phrase expresse it vnto you) I exhorte you
(saieth Paule) to deuite or shonne the company of heretikes,
after you shall haue ones or twise reproued theim for their erronius

opinions. Now whan this doctour had thundred
foorth this texte in a bigge voyce, makyng often repeticion
of this latine woorde (deuita) so that many merua

now what the diuell he ailed, at last he concluded,
that heretikes muste be lifted de, vita, makyng two
woordes therof, as who saieth lifted out of life.
            Many laughed at this his fine exposicion, and some
there were yet, who toke the same for a verie Theologass
inuencion. But wheras others (that notwithstandyng)
beganne to replie, by and by rose vp an other muche solemne
and irrefragable doctour to take his part. And
thus lieth the case (quod he) It is written, Suffer thou no
misdooer to liue, now sins that euery heretike misdooeth, ergo
thou must suffer no heretike on liue. This Syllogysme
beyng thus trussed vp by hym, (lorde) how all the assistence
beganne to wonder at his wittinesse, thoroughly
coufyrmyng his sentence, yea and that the sooner, seyng
none of theim 
                  •
               ad the witte or learnyng to consider,
how that law was fyrste ordeined against lottemongers,
enchaunters and sorcerers, suche as the Hebrews in theyr
tounge name witches. For els why shoulde not fornicatours,
and drunkardes by as good reason, be punished
with the lyke peine of death? But I plaie the verie
foole in goyng about to tell vnto you, all suche balde
deuises of these furde hoodedmen, beyng in deede so innumerable,
as woulde not (on my conscience) be comprehended
in all the large volumes of Crisyppus, and
Didymus, takyng hardly Fytzharbertꝭ abregementes for
aduantage. Onely my meanyng was, to aduertise you,
that seing those diuine maister doctours durst take vpon
theim to wrest and mistake scripture in suche sort, than

muche more I must be borne with, beyng but a younge
doctresse, and lyke a woman shotyng foorthe my bolte
at the gainest, if sometyme maie chaunce I laie not all
my allegacions fully by leuell. But now at last I lepe
backe againe to sainct Paule, and Gladly (saieth he)
ye dooe beare with vnwise men, (speakyng it by him selfe)
also in an other place, receiue you me, as vnwise that I am:
and further, I speake not this precisely as vpon gods precepte,
but rather in mine owne vnwisedome. Than againe, we
(saieth he) are become fooles for Christes sake: Dooe you
here now how great praises of Foly this so great an autour
alleageth, yea and that more is, he plainely enioygneth
Folie vnto vs, for a thyng moste necessarie, and
right, importyng to saluacion? For who so semeth (saieth
he) to be wise amonges you, let him become a foole, to the ende
he be wise in deede. How saie you my maisters, woulde
ye any more euident prouffes than this, or an other exemple
also in Lukes gospell, where Iesus calleth the
two disciples fooles, with whom he ioigned company
by the waie? This in especiall maie be taken for a
meruaile,These argumentes must be taken as spoken by Folie, not that Erasmus ment so in deede. how Paule so great a diuine spareth not to
attribute a maner foolisshenesse, yea vnto god also:
where he saieth, what euer of god is foolisshe, is wyser yet
than any thyng in men: in expoundyng of whiche texte
Origene denieth it to be possible, that this foly maie be
referred to the generall opinion of men vpon the same.
As appeareth by this other text of Paule, to reason of the
misteries of the crosse, is surely to suche as beleue it not and dooe
perisshe in their pe
                     •
                  uersnesse, naught els but Folie. But aye,
what ayleth me to seke so many textes of Scripture for
witnesses of my woordes, seeyng Christ hym selfe in

the psal
                  •
               ier dooeth plainly speake thus vnto the father,
Thou knowest myne vnwysedome? So, not without some
cause and respecte we see in scripture, howe fooles and
simple soules stande hieghly in Goddꝭ fauour, whiche
I take to be, that lyke as great princes haue wysemen
in ielousie and suspicion, as Iulius Caesar had Brutus
and also Cassius, wheras he nothyng helde hym selfe
adradde of drunken Marke Anthony, and as Nero
mistrusted Seneca, and Dionysius stode in doubte of
Plato, wheras freely on the other syde they gaue them
selues to the pleasant company of men, of a grosser and
more simple capacitee: So in like rate dooeth Christe
blame and reproue these worldly sages, who fully cleue
and stande to theyr owne wysedome. This by Paules
woordꝭ is confyrmed, where he saieth, God hath chosen
hym out those that the worlde reputed for fooles.
               By Folie in these places is ment godly symplicitee and by wysedome a worldly 
                     •
                  o 
                     〈◊〉
                  . And in an
other place: God hath disposed to saue the worlde by foolishnesse,
seyng that by wisedome it might not be conserued. Yea
God him selfe doeth sufficiently confesse the same, wheras
he crieth by the mouthe of the prophete, I shall confounde
the wisedome of wisemen, and reproue the prudence of
Sages: So Christ in an other place rendeth thankꝭ vnto
the father, that he had hidden the misterie of saluacion from
wisemen, and disclosed thesame to youngelinges, (That is to
saie) to fooles, (For so the Greke woorde signifieth.)
            And hereto serue the manyfolde nippes and tauntes,
wherwith Christ in diuers places of the gospell, bayteth
Pharisees, and Scribes, and Doctours of the law, takyng
ernestly yet the part of simple and vnlearned folkes.
For is it not as muche to saie, Woo be vnto you,
ye Scribes and Pharisees, as woo be vnto you, ye wisemen
                  •
               
               
But where finde you that euer he charged either yong
                  •
               
               lynges,
or women, or fisshers, with that so heauie a
woorde? For it semeth proprely that he delited muche
in theyr simplicitee, euin lyke as those kindꝭ of dumme

                  ••
               astes were most acceptable vnto hym, that were fardest
remoued from all Forelike wylinesse. And therfore
chose he rathest to ryde on an asse, all be it (so pleasyng
hym) he myght as safely haue bestridden a Lyons
backe. We reade also that the holy ghoste descended 
                  〈◊〉
               
the lykenesse of a Culuer, and not of an Egle, or a Puttocke.
And besydes this, scripture in many places maketh
mencion of hertes, of faunes, of lambes, and suche sely
beastes. Lyke as Christe dooeth call his elect and
chosen by the name of Shepe, whiche beaste is of all others
the vnwysest (witnesse this prouerbe of Aristotle)
his maners sauour of the shepe, or he hath shepishe condicions:
whiche quippie in waie of reproche is vsed against
blockeheades of the verie sklendrest capacitee. And yet
we see, how Christ professeth hym selfe to be the herdeman
of suche a flocke: Yea and that more is, delited
hym selfe in the name of Lambe, that Iohn the Baptist
gaue hym, whan he poincted hym thus to the people:
Lo
                     •
                   here the lambe of God: whiche ressemblaunce is lykewyse
cited in many places of the Apocalipse. Now
all these textes that I haue alleaged, doe thei no
                  •
                plainly
testifie, that mortall men beyng 
                     •
                  ooles, are godly also? and
that Christ hym selfe mindyng the relefe and redempcion
of mankyndes folie, although he was the ineffable
wisedome of the father, became yet a maner foole, wheras
takyng mans nature vpon hym, he was founde bothe
in fourme and habite lyke vnto other men. Euin as

Paule saieth, he was made sinne also, to cure and heale the
synnes of the worlde: to whiche sinnes yet it pleased him
to ministre none other medecines, than the Folie of the
crosse, by the handes of the Apostles, beyng grosse and
vnskilled men: whom 
                  •
               atheles he as diligently did perswade
vnto foolisshenesse, as otherwyse he retired and
dishorted theim from wysedome, in alluryng theim by
exemples shewed vpon Children, vpon burdes of the ayre,
and other thynges smallie sensed or no whitte, as whiche liue
by no arte nor fordrifte, and likewyse in warnyng them
to take no care how thei shoulde vse their woordes, whan thei
were brought afore iudges and presidentes, and further in forbiddyng
theim to seke out the accoumpt of times, or the smallest
momentes of times. To the ende (as who saieth) they
shulde not leane to their owne prudence, but with whole
thought and mynde depende on hym, remittyng all vnto
his discrecion. Wherunto this also maie be applied,
that god the Creatour and fyrst former of all thynges
forbadde Adam vnder penaltee of death he shulde not
taste of the fruite of the tree of Science or knowlage.
As who saieth Science were the mere poyson to felicitee: Accordyng
wherto, Paule also dooeth openly reproue science
for a thyng most hurtesome and pernicious,
               The tasting of the fruite of the tree of knowlage brought in 
                     •
                  eath. 
               seyng it puffeth
vp the minde of man with selfe glorie: Lyke as sainct Bernard
also folowyng (as I take it) Paules saied opinion,
expoundeth the hille, wheron Lucifer establisshed his seate,
to be the hille of Science. And perchaunce it shoulde not
be the feblest argument, to saie that fooles finde so muche
grace and fauour afore god, as to Folie onely is geuin
perdone and forgeuenesse of trespasses, wheras to
wysedome not so muche as the leastiote is remitted.
            
               In sort that who so euer dooe axe at god forgeuenesse
of theyr sinnes, although they wittyngly did committe
the same, yet will they vse a certaine colour and pretext
of Folie for theyr excuse. For so dooeth Aaron in the
boke of Numbres (if I well remembre me) desire perdone
of the punisshement that his wiues faultes deserued, Saieyng,
I praie the (O lorde) not to laie to our charge this sinne,
whiche we haue foolisshelie committed. And so dooeth Saul
praie Dauid to forgeue hym, For it appeareth (saied he)
that I haue dooen foolisshely. Thau againe the selfe Dauid
speaketh fayre and humbly to the lord, in this wise,
But I praie the (O lorde) to perdone the iniquitee of thy seruaunt,
seyng we haue dooen foolisshely. As if he thought he
shoulde obteine no mercie, vnlesse he had laide Folie and
inconsidraunce to b
                  ••
               e. But what speake we of Dauid?
knowyng how Christ the sonne of god hangyng
on the crosse did in this wise make intercession for his
enemies, Father, forgeue them, and laide none other excuse,
than, for thei know not what thei dooe. So Paule in like
maner writyng to Timothe saied, But herefore haue I obteined
the mercy of god, in as muche as ignorantly I offended in
mine incredulitee. Now what is it to saie, I offended ignorantly,
but that, I did it through folie and not thorough
malice? or what other exposicion can ye make,
of herefore haue I obteined mercie, than that els I shoulde
not haue obteined it, not hauyng laide the wyte on Folie?
And no lesse maketh for vs, that saiyng of Dauid
in the Psaltier, Lorde, take not to herte the trespasses of my
youth, and mine ignorauncies remembre not. Doe you marke
now what two colours he bringeth in for his purgacion?
that is to saie Youthe, whiche age I dooe euer accompany,

and ignorancies, speakyng it in the Plural numbre,
to expresse therby the greatter copie and habounbance
of his Folie. Finally, as it were an endlesse labour
to tell you infinite suche exemples, so to knitte vp
shortly, I saie in my conceite, that Christian Religion
seemeth to haue a certaine sybship with simplicitee, and
deuoute foolisshenesse,These wordes muste not be wrested to any 
                     •
                  uill sense otherwise than the autour

                  ent. in nothyng agreyng with worldly
wysedome. But if ye axe me, as how? than doe no
more but consider how children, old folkes, women, and
fooles, are those amongꝭ others that shew theim selues
deuoutest, and most enclined to churche seruice, and holy
thyngꝭ, reioysyng to be present therat, in sort that euer
at Masse tyme ye shall see theim approche nerest vnto
the altars, euin through a certaine instinction of naturall
selinesse prouokyng theim to god. Thinke also
how the verie fyrst autours and founders of Christen
Religion were as sharpe aduersaries of all Science, and
men trustyng to theyr owne cunnyng, as otherwyse
frendly embrasorus of simplicitee and plainesse. Lastly
perpende ye thus, how no maner fooles are in apparence
more ideotelike, than suche as are totally rauisshed, and
enflamed with the ardent zeale of Christian charitee. So
loueshly thei deale their goodes abrode, forgette all iniuries doen
vnto theim, suffre theim selues to be deceiued, put no difference
betwene friendes and foes, abhorre all pleasures and delites of the
bodie, are fedde vp and made fatte with fastyng, watchyng,
teares, labours, and despites, despise their owne life, end desire
death aboue life, briefely seme to be so astonned and past all commen
sensis, whiche men liue by, as if their soules dwelled not in
those bodies thei beare about with theim, but rather in some other
mansion place. Whiche straunge trade of theyrs I

know not how to call, but well maie it to the commen
iudgement of men, appeere to be a verie madnesse, or ra

wine. And that Paule likewise was holden for madde, of Festus
the president of Iurie, in these woordes, Thou rauest

But seeyng I haue ones taken vpon me to

               ctresse, puttyng on a Lyons hide (as they saie)
let me not sticke now to goe through withall, and to teache
you this also, that the selfe same felicitee, whiche
Christians doe so hotely desyre,Foly speaketh. and by so many labours
dooe seke for, is naught els than a certaine kynde of rauyng,
in the sprite, and godly foolisshenesse. Whiche
woordes I would not ye should grate on, nor take them
at the woorst, but rather note the thyng in deede as it lieth.
For fyrst ye must thinke, how Christians in this
poinct dooe fully agree with the opinion of Platos Sectatours,
how the soule of man beyng drowned and entangled
in the fleshely bandes of the bodie, can not as being dusked with
the grosenesse of the same, beholde and take fruicion of the fight
of verie thynges as thei are in deede. Wherupon Plato
defineth Philosophie to bee a meditacion or remembraunce of
death, in as muche as it plucketh and retyreth the mind
of man from visible and corporall thyngꝭ, to those that
are inuisible and ghostly. Whiche effect is in death also.
Therfore so longe as the soule within man doeth
rightly and in due wyse peruse the Organs of the bodie,
so longe is that man called sounde, and of good discrecion:
but whan some of those bandes or conduite
                  •
               
               
beyng ones perisshed, she dooeth busily labour to recouer
hir freedome, minding a certaine flight (as it were)
and breakyng lose from that hir flesshely prison the bodie,
by whiche struglyng the whole frame of the sensis,
and inwarde powers is disioygned, you dooe holde him
for madde and out of his right mynde: whiche passion
if it come perhaps through infyrmitee, or faultinesse of
any of those Organs, than dooe all men precisely agree,Diuinitee 
                     〈◊〉
                   rauers.
that it is plaine Madnes: How be it we see that
euin this kynde of rauers dooe sometyme also prophecie
of thyngꝭ commyng, and sodeinly become knowers
of tounges, and artes, whiche erste they neuer learned,
shewyng to haue in theim I wote neuer what espece of
new inspiracion and diuinitee: whiche vndoubtedly chanceth,
because the soule beyng somewhat enlarged, and
made freer from the bodies yoke and contagiousnesse beginneth
a little to exercise and welde hir selfe accordyng
to the propretee of hir owne nature. And vpon
like occasion many folke labouring in the extreme pangꝭ
of death, are muche subiect (as I take it) to somewhat
like hereto, as often as if thei were rauished in a traūce,
they dooe speake of certaine wonderous thyngꝭ perteignyng
to an other worlde. But and if the saied
wandryng of the wittꝭ dooe befalle a man for that he
is right passyngly moued a
                  •
               d stirred vp with the loue
of heauenly thyngꝭ, I doubte now whether it maie be
called the selfe same kynde of madnesse, yet sure it is so
nere sybbe therto, as many men now a daies will doubt
neuer a whitte to repute that his feruent affection towardꝭ
god, for a verie dotage of the mynde. Namely
seyng a smalle numbre of suche sely good soules as are

deteigned therwith, dooe in all theyr deedes, and liuyng
repine, and disagree from the whole bande of other mortall
men. Wherfore (I suppose) they are serued, as
Plato feigneth, that one of those prisoners was, that satte
bounden in a darke denne vnder grounde (as before I recited vnto
you) wheras naught was seen els, sauyng shadowes and representacions
of thinges. That where by chaunce the saied
prisoner escaped out of the denne, and so commyng abrode into
this worlde, saw verie thinges as thei were in deede, returning
of good will to his felowes, to aduertise theim of the errour thei
were in, he was no whitte beleeued of theim, but rather laught
to scorne: For wheras he like a man of wisedome and experience
seemed to pitie their madnesse and great blindnesse in mistakyng
so of thynges, thei on the otherside did potte at him, and
thrust him out of their companie, for a frantike foole. So fareth
it by the vulgar sorte of men, who commenly haue
those thyngꝭ in greatest price and admiracion,The difference betwene worldly &amp; goldly men. that are
most sensuall and bodily, as whiche thei take to be onely,
and none other: wheras goddꝭ folkes on the other
part, what euer draweth nerest to the bodily vse, do the
sooner therfore despise and set lyght by it, forsomuche
as they are holy rauisshed aud geuin to the contemplacion
of inuisible thyngꝭ. For as worldlyngꝭ haue richesse
in best reputacion, next therto estemyng the weale
of theyr bodies, and lest regardyng the profite of theyr
soules, in case thei regarde it at all, for some of them beleue
there is no soule, because they can not see it at the
eie: So againe deuout persons put theyr whole confidence
in god, beyng the simplest and most pure thyng of
all others, and secondly do chearishe that, that draweth
nerest to hym, I meane the sprite, bestowyng no cost nor

               
                  •
               endance on their bodies, nor on pleasures belongyng to
the same. But money of all thyngꝭ they neglect, and
set no store by, nomore than ye woulde dooe by thynges
superfluous, or rather noysome. That and if (maie
chaunce) at any time thei be enforsed to go about worldly
affayres, I can tell you yet, that they doe it euil willyngly,
and with a spyced stomake. So that (Paule
saieth) thei haue goodes, as not hauyng goodes: and possesse
theim, as not possessyng theim, by reason thei varie so muche
from the vniuersall and vulgar sorte of men. For
although the Senses haue all a certaine parentage a
                  •
               d
kynneship with the body, yet be there of the same, some
grosser in substaunce, as are fealyng, hearyng, seeyng, smellyng,
and tastyng: some againe more seuered and remoued
from the body, as is memorie, vnderstandyng, and freewill.
Now seeyng that the soule of man hath therin
most strength and vigour, wherunto she moste applieth
hir selfe, therfore it cometh to passe, that holy men, the
force of whose sprites is wholy bent vpon thynges contemplatiue,
whiche are most distaunt and aliened from
the grosser senses, dooe fare in the rest, as if they were
benummed, or brute of iudgement, as domme beastꝭ are.
Wheras contrary the soules of vulgar people are most

beyng as blunt and dulle yet, in the other fiue powers
of the witte. And herevpon (I thynke) it cometh,Saincte Bernard dranke oyle in stede of wyne.
that some deuoute persones (as it is written of theim)
did without apperceiuyng the difference, drinke lampe
oyle in steede of wyne. So likewyse as conceruyng the
affections of the minde, some of them be of faster league
aud aliaunce to the body, as are flesshely luste, appetite to

fode or slepe, yre, pride, and enuie, with suche other disordinate
mocio
                  •
               s, wherwith holy men are euer at vnpeasible
warre, but the vulgars not onely dooe not eschew,
but rather embrace theim,Diuersitee of affections. as supposyng they can not
liue without them. Than againe, some other affections
are entredeux and indifferent to bothe partes, whiche
we maie name Naturall, as the reuerence a man beareth
towardes father and mother, the charinesse he hath ouer his children,
the loue he oweth to his kinnesfolkes and friendes, with
suche lyke. Whiche saied Middle affections are had also
in some degree and price amonges commen people,
though not so muche as the other. But holy men will
struggle to race theim also out of theyr hertꝭ, sauyng as
farfoorth as they be ghostly, and make rather towardes
the hieghest part of man, whiche is the Sprite, than
any other flesshely appetites: by whiche conueighance
they maie loue theyr parentꝭ not as theyr parentꝭ, (for
what els begate thei sauyng theyr bodies? yet euin that
also ought to be referred to god the maker of all thynges)
but loue theim rather as good folkes, in whom
the image of the sprite of god resplendissheth. Whiche
saied ressemblance they call verie felicitee, as the greattest
good that maie he had, yea suche (thei saie) as onely,
and none other, shulde be beloued, required, and wished
after. And so by this saied rule, dooe thei measure
lykewyse all the other partes and duities of this life:
wherby it cometh to passe, that what euer thyng is seen
here presently at the eie, if so be thei doe not fully contemne
the same, yet sure they sette muche lesse therby,
than by other thynges, whiche maie not outwardly be
seen. Yea thei saie also, that euin in the churche sacramentes,

and woorkes of charitee there maie be tried out
bothe a ghostlinesse and a bodilinesse: As for exemple, In
fastyng thei holde it not sufficient for a man to absteine from eating
of flesshe, whiche vulgar folke suppose to be the entiere and
perfect faste, vnlesse that he rebate somewhat also from his affections,
in geuyng lesse raines than before to his anger, or in cuttyng
his prides combeshorter, or in lightnyng him selfe of his bodily
peize, to the ende his sprite maie the nemblier climbe vp to
the gripe and fruicion of heauenly thinges. Likewise in howsell, and receiuyng of the sacrament, albeit (saie thei) the ceremonies
and circumstaunces vsed about the same, ought not to be
neglected, yet must we take them of them selfe alone to be little
auailable, or rather hartfull, vnlesse the other part, whiche is spirituall,
be added also therunto: that is to saie, the thyng it selfe,
whiche by those outwarde signes is represented. For represented
is the death of Christ therby, whiche death all Christen men
are bounde to folow and expresse, bothe in dauntyng, fordooyng,
and buriyng of all bodily affections, to the end thei maie rise againe,
beyng restored to a new life, as vnited therby vnto Christ,
and made all one amonges theim selues. These misteries
are by godly and spiritual meaners scanned in this sort:
but leude folke commenly do take the M
                     •
                  sse sacrifice to
be of none other effect, than as it were a certaine church
seruice, wherin they fully did their duities, aslonge as
they be present at it, standyng as nere the altare as thei
maie, to here the woordꝭ of the priest, or chauntyng of
the quyre, with other lyke ceremonies and obseruauncꝭ
vsed about the same. Now, not onely in these two poinctes,
whiche for exemples sake I haue set to fore you,
but generally throughout all their liuyng, holy men wil
flie from those thyngꝭ, that sauour of the bodie, as beyng

rapte and drawen vp to the other, that are ghostly
and inuisible. Insomuche therfore as there is suche
diuersitee and discencion in all poinctes betwene these
two trades of men, it cometh to passe, that eche of them
dooe take other for madde and distraught,Marke how Folie dalieth in hir wordes whiche are to be construed to 
                     •
                   good sense or els to be but as a talke of Folie. notwithstandyng
(in my conceipte) that name maie rightlier be applied
vnto holy men, than vulgar people: whiche ye
shall plainlier perceiue why, as soone as I haue briefly
(accordyng to my promyse) declared vnto you, how the
finall mede and gwerdone, that Christen men dooe loke after, is
naught els than a certaine sweete rauyng, and simple alienacion
of the minde: wherin eftesoones I requyre you, not to
be ouer scrupulous graters at the bare woordꝭ without
takyng the sense withall. Fyrst therfore ye must thinke,
that Plato didde euin than dreame of suche a thyng,
whan he wrote, that the passion and extreme rage of feruent
louers was to be desired and embrased, as a thing aboue all others
most blisfull: because that a vehement louer liueth
not now in hym selfe, but rather in that that he loueth,
so that the further &amp; further a louers hert is distraught
from him selfe, to dwell with the beloued, the more and
more he reioyseth. And whan the minde seketh to wander
from the body, nor occupieth the powers of the same
in the due vse, who will call this otherwyse than plaine
madnesse? For els why dooe you vse commenly this
phrase of speche? he is out of him selfe, and retourne man to
thy selfe, and he is come againe to him selfe. It foloweth
therfore, how muche more perfect, and the depelier suche
loue is impressed, that so muche the greatter, and
the blisfuller is the rage also. Whiche so beyng that
soulꝭ yet pinned within these bodily foldꝭ maie smacke

a little of suche a felicitee, consider ye than what a life
the sainctꝭ soules leade in heauen? whervnto the mindes
of godly persons dooe with suche feruencie aspyre?
Seeyng there the sprite as vanquissher, and farre more
puissaunt, shall wholy drawe vp, and conuert the body
into hir owne nature: Whiche she maie dooe the easilier,Transformacion of the body in 
                     〈◊〉
                   the sprite
seeyng euin in this life here, she had clensed and purified the same through fastynges and other deuout meditacions, to be the meter and more apte to receiue suche
a ghostly transformacion. And than againe, the
sprite selfe shalbe meruailously rauisshed and soked vp
by the farre more stronge and attractiue power of the
hieghest sprite of all, whiche is God. So that now
those holy men shalbe altogether transformed and alterated,
by none other meanes yet to so hiegh a degree in
felicitee, sauyng onely because they as wholy beyng issued
out of theim selues, shall enioy and be participant
of that vnspeakeable heauenly sweetenesse, procedyng
from a pure and tight perfecte pleasure, throughe the
myght of god, the greatest good of all, that rauissheth
and attyreth all thyngꝭ to it selfe. Now albeit this
saied felicitee is than moste amply and absolutely enioied,
whan the soules at the resurrection daie beyng restored
to theyr owne bodies,The life of good Christians a meditation of the life 
                     〈◊〉
                   come. shall ioynctly receiue immortalitee: yet inasmuche as the life of good Christians
is naught els than a continuall meditacion or certaine
shadow as it were of that life to come, it chanceth, that
they yet liuyng, haue for theyr coumforte permission at
sometymes to discerne a taste or sauour of that hieghest
rewarde behight vnto theim: Whiche saied smacke or
sente, be it but a little droppe in respecte of that large

flowyng well of eternall felicitee, yet surely it surpasseth,
and incomparablie excedeth all other bodily pleasures,
yea although all the delices of all men were wholy
ioigned and put in one. So muche (loe) are spirituall
thynges to be preferred before flesshely thinges, and
the inuisible before the other visible. For this vndoubtedly
is euin the very gwerdone that the Prophete promyseth,
Saiyng, was neuer mans eie sawe, nor eare heard,
not thought of hert yet compassed, what, and how great felicitee
god hath prepared vnto suche as dooe loue him. And this
is Mary Magdalens porcion, whiche by chaunge of
life shall not be plucked awaie, but rather be more perfitely
confyrmed. Who so euer therefore haue suche
grace (whiche sure is geuin to few) by theyr life tyme
to tast of this saied felicitee, they are subiecte to a certaine
passion muche lyke vnto madnesse or witrauyng,
whan rauisshed so in the sprite, or beyng in a traunce,
thei dooe speake certaine thyngꝭ not hangyng one with
an other, nor after any earthly facion, but rather dooe
put foorth a voyce they wote neuer what, muche lesse to
be vnderstode of others: and sodeinely without any apparent
cause why, dooe chaunge the state of theyr countenaunces.
For now shall ye see theim of glad chere,
now of as sadde againe, now thei wepe, now thei laugh,
now they sighe, for briefe, it is certaine that they are
wholy distraught and rapte out of theim selues. In sort
that whan a little after thei come againe to their former
wittes,Godly men in a kynde of traunce. thei denie plainly thei wote where thei became,
or whether thei were thā in theyr bodies, or out of theyr
bodies, wakyng or slepyng: remembring also as little,
either what they heard, saw, saied, or did than, sauyng

as it were through a cloude, or by a dreame: but this
thei know certainely, that whiles their mindes so roued
and wandred, thei were most happie and blisfull, so that
they lament and wepe at theyr retourne vnto theyr former
senses, as who saieth, nothyng were leefer vnto
theim than continually to raue a
                  •
               d be deteigned with
suche a spece of madnesse. And this is but a certaine
smacke or thinne taste of theyr blisse to come. But ones
more forgettyng my selfe, I passe my boundes. Howbeit
if ought shall seeme vnto you to haue been saied of me
more knappisshely than became me, or with more wordꝭ
than neded, thynke I praie you, that I was the speaker,
beyng bothe Folie, and a woman. Yet for all that
remembre the Greeke prouerbe, that oftentimes a foole maie
speake to purpose, vnlesse perchance ye thinke that this maketh
no whitte for women. I perceiue ye loke for an
Epiloge or knotte of my tale, but than sure ye are
verie fooles, if ye wene that I yet remembre
what I haue spoken, after suche a rablement
of wordꝭ powred foorth. The old
prouerbe saieth, I hate a talebearer
from the boorde: But I saie,
I hate hym that remembreth what he
hath sayd.
Fare
ye well therfore, clappe your handꝭ in token
of gladnesse, liue carelesse, and
drinke all out, ye the trustie
