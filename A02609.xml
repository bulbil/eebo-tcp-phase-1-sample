            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

            TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE SIR OLIVER SAINT-IOHN Knight, Lord Deputie of IRELAND.
            
               MOst honoured Lord: I haue taken boldneſſe to dedicate vnto your Lordſh. theſe Meditations concerning the Creation, Fall, and Reſtitution of Man, for the honor I beare to your high place: and to teſtifie my humble and thankefull acknowledgements of your manifold, noble, and readie fauours done both to my ſelfe in particular, and to this poore Church of Ireland in generall: She, being in the qualitie of a Pupill (as that condition is fatall to the Church) and ſeuered with vaſt Seas from the comfortable ſight of her gratious Guardian,

was forced to flie to your defence that beare his Sword. hath often beene refreſhed by it, and ſeldome implored ayde in vaine. Proceede with diligence and conſtancie, in this honourable protecting of Chriſt his Miniſters. The cheerefull respects or entertainements giuen in that kind, make you reſemble him the better which putteth you in truſt: they will make true Religion ſhine in the Church, pietie, obedience, tranquillitie flouriſh in the land, and accumulate God his bleſsings, the Churches, and Common-weales vpon your perſon and Gouernement: which no man can wiſh more cordially then
            
               Your Lordſh. moſt affectionate, to doe you honour, ARMAGH.
            
         
      
      
         
            
            
               THE GLORY OF MANS CREATION.
               
                  
                     
                        GEN. 1. VER. 26.
                     
                     Furthermore God ſaid, Let Vs make man in our owne Image, according to our likeneſſe.
                  
               
               
                  TWo things are conſiderable in this Text: firſt, the Creator: ſecondly, the Creature. And ſo it will helpe vs in the knowledge of God, and of our ſelues.
               Concerning the former, S. Hilarie ſaith, Perfecta ſcientia est ſic Deum ſcire, vt licet non ignorabilem, tamen inenarrabilem ſcias. creden̄dus est, intelligendus eſt, adorandus eſt, &amp; his officijs eloquendus eſt; This is a perfect knowledge ſo to know God, not as one that could not be knowne at all, but as one that cannot be expreſſed. he muſt be beleeued, he muſt be vnderſtood, hee muſt be worſhipped, and with theſe offices hee muſt be ſpoken of.
               Poets write that Prometheus made man of clay; Res eos non fefellit, ſed nomen artificis, miſtaking not the thing it ſelfe, but the artificers name:1. Cor. 15.47. for the firſt man was of the earth earthie. Prometheus was not the Architect in

this building; for the Holy Ghoſt teacheth vs here, by the pen of Moſes, that it was God which ſaid, Let vs make man, therefore it is he that hath made vs and not we our ſelues.
                  Pſal. 100.3.
               
               Yet he might haue the concurrence and ayde of others with him,
                     No helpe in our creation.
                     
                        Eſa 44. I am the Lord that made all things that ſpread out the heauens alone, and ſtretched out the earth by myſelfe.
                     
                        Rom. 11.34.35 He ſpake not to the Angels.
                   becauſe he ſaith, Let Vs make man; as if manie were ioyned together in the buſineſſe. Not ſo neyther: for, Who hath knowne the minde of the Lord? or was his Counſailor, and hath taught him? who hath giuen him firſt, and he ſhall be recompenſed? When hee ſaid, Let Vs make man, hee ſpake not vnto the Angels. Are they not all miniſtring Spirits? and then how ſhould they be creating powers? They are our fellow ſeruants, creatures as we are, and beneficiaries of God his graces with vs; not conſorters or companions of his glorie. They are ſent forth to miniſter for their ſake that be heyres of ſaluation, not to be founders or coadiutors of our creation. They cannot be ſeruants in the one, and maſter workmen in the other: they cannot be creatures and creators: they cannot be Gods meſſengers and his compeeres too.
               So man ſhould be created in the likeneſſe of Angels; for he ſaith, Let vs make man in our Image. That Moſes confuteth in the next verſe. In the Image of God hee made man,God and Angels haue not one image. not in the image of Angels; vnleſſe any ſhould be ſo vaine to imagine that there is one and the ſame image common to God and Angels. Some of them did affect to bee like vnto the Almightie, and it was adiudged robberie, for a document of inſtruction to terrifie euery creature from ſuch preſumptuous compariſons, and to conteine all ſorts within the liſts of their vocation. Verily none but God is like vnto God:

the Sonne vnto the Father: the Holy Ghoſt vnto them both. He only hath the character &amp; image of the inuiſible God, that is the firſt begotten of all creatures. Philip, he that ſeeth me, ſeeth the Father: againe,Ioh. 14 9. Ioh. 10.30. 
                  I and the Father are one; without inequalitie, without diſsimilitude: When he ſaith, Let vs make man, he leaueth no inequalitie. reddidiſti authorem cum ſocium profeſſus es. When he addeth, in our image, where can be diſsimilitude?
               
                  Eſt enim Dei filius Deo patri natura aequalis, habitu minor: In forma ſerui quam accepit, minor est patre:Aug. de Trinit lib. 1. cap. 7. In forma Dei in quo erat etiam antequam hanc accepiſſet, aequalis eſt patri: In forma Dei, verbum per quod facta ſunt omnia: In forma ſerui factus ex muliere, factus ſub lege, vt eos qui ſublege erant redimeret. Proindè in forma dei fecit hominem, in forma ſerui factus eſt homo, nam ſi pater tantum ſine filio feciſſet hominem, non ſcriptum eſſet faciamus hominem ad imaginem &amp; ſimilitudinem nostram For the Sonne of God is equall to the Father in nature, inferior by habite: In the ſhape of a ſeruant which he did take, he was leſſe then the Father: In the forme of God which he had before he tooke that ſhape, he was equall to the Father: in the forme of God, hee was that Word by whom all things were made: in the ſhape of a ſeruant he was made of the ſubſtance of a woman, made vnder the law, to redeeme thoſe that were vnder the lawe. Therefore being in the forme of God he made man, &amp; being in the ſhape of a ſeruant was himſelfe made a man: for if the Father alone had made man without the Sonne, our Text wold not haue ſet it downe in theſe termes, Let vs make man in our owne image, according to our likeneſſe.
               
               Seeing then that here a Noune ſingular, dixit Deus, is ioyned with a Verb plurall, faciamus hominem; and that

the Scripture ſpeaketh of God in the one number, and the other particularly as of one, and by the name of a multitude, as of manie: I neede not trouble you with further ſearch to whom he ſpeaketh when he ſaith,
                     Faciamus hominem: Many perſons in the vnitie of the Godhead. 
                  Let vs make man, but may rather call you to obſerue, that there be manie perſons in this vnitie of Godhead, and yet but one ſubſtance in this pluralitie of perſons.
               The Father eternall maketh and preſerueth all things by his coeternall Wiſedome, with his ſubſtantiall vertue. Chriſt teacheth vs this cooperation of Father and Sonne:Ioh. 5.17. 
                  My Father worketh as yet, and I worke. Now Father and Sonne work not without their loue, their gladneſſe and eſſentiall power, which is the Holy Ghoſt. If all theſe perſons doe concurre and ioyne together in the worke of mans creation, we ſee the perſons that are ſpoken vnto, and the pluralitie comprehended vnder faciamus. Againe, by the concluſion of their decree, that this excellent creature ſhould be ſtamped with the print of their owne image, you may diſcerne the vnitie of their ſubſtance; becauſe all three haue but one image, ad imaginem noſtram.
               
               
                  But one God.And indeed there can be but one thing that is infinite. Will you make more then one? Conſider firſt where they ſhall be conteyned: for one infinite muſt be conteyned euery where, and fill all places; But God is infinite, therefore there can be but one God. Other things increaſe by multiplication; ſo doth not the Godhead: whatſoeuer is added to it, doth not multiplie, but diminiſh it.
               
                  It is not good for man to bee alone, therefore God made him a helpe meet for him.
                  Gen. 1.18. With God it is contrarie, good for him to be alone, and neceſſarie too: otherwiſe hee

cannot be ſuch as the Scripture deſcribeth him: three ſacred perſons without confuſion, and one bleſſed Deitie without diuiſion. Noli intellegere vt credas, ſed crede vt intelligas: intellectus enim est merces fidei. Vnderſtand not that you may beleeue, but beleeue that you may vnderſtand; for vnderſtanding is thereward of faith.
               The worke of creation belongeth to none but to this Godhead alone. Ierem. 10.
                  
                     The worke of creation belongeth to the Godhead alone.
                     
                        Ierem. 10.11. Reuel. 14.7.
                     
                   
                  Let the gods periſh that made not heauen and earth. And on the other ſide, he that did it, the Angell would haue adored, Worſhip him that made heauen and earth.
               
               It is attributed to the Father partcularly,
                     How it is attributed to the Father.
                     
                        Act. 4.24.27.
                     
                   
                  Act. 4. Thou O Lord God which haſt made heauen and earth &amp;c. doubtleſſe againſt thy holy Sonne Ieſus, Herod and Pontius Pilate gathered. The like is aſcribed to him alſo in the articles of our faith, where we profeſſe a Beliefe in God the Father Almightie, maker of heauen and earth: and yet wee hold firmely that the workes of the Godhead Quoad extra, be 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , actions common to the whole Trinitie, wherein all three perſons doe ſo concurre, and keepe correſpondencie, that euery one hath neuertheleſs ſome peculiar operation apart. As for example: The incarnation of the Sonne of God, was an action or common worke of the whole Trinitie; yet the Father had a peculiar part in it, namely, to ſend his Sonne: And the Sonne againe had his parte, to take fleſh, and to combine it into the vnitie of his perſon; which is not communicable to either of the other two perſons: for neyther Father nor Holy Ghoſt could be incarnate. It was not the Nature of God that did take the Nature of man, for then all three perſons muſt haue beene incarnate. The Word onely, being the ſecond perſon in Trinitie,

was made fleſh, and tooke the ſeed of Abraham; the perſon onely was incarnate, which is peculiar to the Sonne alone, and cannot bee communicated to the Father or Holy Ghoſt.
               The Holy Ghoſt had another part in that buſineſſe; he came vpon the bleſſed Virgin, ouerſhadowed her, and by purifying that part of her ſubſtance, built vp a bodie fit for the Word.
               So we doe ſay in this worke of creation, It was a common action of the whole Trinity; and neuertheleſſe for diſtinction and order ſake, we ſay, That there was one operation of the Father, another of the Sonne, and another of the Holy Ghoſt. The Father, as Baſil writeth, is 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , the Sonne 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , the Holy Ghoſt 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . The Father the commaunding cauſe, the Sonne the working cauſe, and the Holy Ghoſt the finiſher. The Father createth by his will, the Sonne by his operation and worke, the Holy Ghoſt by giuing life and motion. The beginning of the worke is in the Father, and hee createth all things by his Wiſedome or Word, and the Holy Ghoſt nouriſheth, hatcheth, houereth ouer the creatures to infuſe life and motion into them.The Father doth not exclude Sonne or Holy Holy Ghoſt. In the Creed and whereſoeuer elſe the Father is called creator of heauen and earth, it doeth not exclude the Sonne and Holy Ghoſt out of this buſineſſe, but ſheweth the manner and order of the action, and which perſon hath precedence.
               
                  The firſt worke of the Godhead fitly attributed to the firſt perſonIs not the creation, which was the firſt outward work of the God-head, fitly attributed to the firſt perſon, that is of himſelfe and of no other? Surely this work ſorteth beſt with the Maieſtie of the Father. But that doth not exclude the other two perſons, as if they had no part in

the matter of creation. 1. Cor. 8.
                  1. Cor. 8.6. the Sonne is called the onely Lord. How? Surely not to infringe the Fathers power, but to exclude Idols and fained gods. So is the creation giuen to the Father, to exclude creatures and vaine gods; not for derogation of any thing from Son and Holy Ghoſt. Act. 14. Wee preach vnto you,
                  Act. 14.15. 
                  that you ſhould turne from theſe vaine idols, vnto the liuing God that made heauen and earth.
               
               They were ioyned therefore in the creation of all things elſe.Three perſons ioyned together in creation of all things. But the Holy Ghoſt did ſo direct the Secretarie of this buſines, that here it is conſpicuous: the firſt reuelation of the Trinitie appeareth in the creation of man,Firſt reuelation of Trinity in the creation of man. that he might ſo worſhip and acknowledge God.
               Beſides other things that be extraordinarie here, &amp; different from his former courſe: there hee ſpake the word and they were made; he commanded &amp; all things elſe were created: here hee taketh a greater worke in hand, becauſe he ordereth all aboue the vulgar: there he left the beaſts and trees vnto the earth to be faſhioned; here he taketh the worke into his owne handes, and frameth man himſelfe: he performeth the office of a true parent; he made the body, he infuſed the ſoule, Illius est totum quicquid ſumus. There hee biddes other things come out of the earth aliue inſtantly; here the producing of man hath a priuiledge, and is not done ſo ſuddenly: there was nothing but producat terra; here the buſineſſe is not paſſed ouer with a bare mandate, but we haue the ſummons of a Councell, Faciamus hominē. O the deepeneſſe of the riches both of the wiſedome &amp; knowledge of this Councell! O great Senate, where all things were determined! Circumſpect, where euerie

occurrent was foreſeene! Holy, where nothing was done vpon aduantage! Iuſt, where place is not left for any complaint!
               What could eſcape ſuch a conſultation, where the Father aduiſeth with his Wiſedome, conſidereth ſeriouſly with his holy Spirit? not for difficultie that was found in this buſineſſe, more then in the reſt: Naturae imperat, poſsibilitati non obtemperat: What was hard to him, cui velle eſt feciſſe, whoſe will was powerfull, that hath done whatſoeuer he pleaſeth both in heauen and earth? Whereto then ſerueth this deliberation? Verily to teach vs that our creation was eminent.
               The skilfull hand of great Beſaleel the cunning artificer of all the world, makes it eminent: the deuiſe held by theſe three ſacred perſons for the adorning of it, makes it eminent: the arreſt &amp; reſolution of their conference, that they would make man according to their own image &amp; ſimilitude, makes it moſt eminent. Can any thing be more excellēt then the image of him that is authour of all excellencies? Nothing certainly but the patterne it ſelfe. And if he be magnified of all things elſe, there is yet more cauſe that his praiſe ſhould neuer goe out of our mouthes:Aug. in Pſa. 70. In proſperitie, becauſe he doth comfort vs: in aduerſitie, becauſe he doth correct vs: before we were, becauſe he hath made vs: afterward, becauſe he adorned vs: when we ſinne, becauſe he forgiueth vs: when wee turne againe, becauſe he helpeth vs: when we perſiſt, becauſe he crowneth vs. To him be all honour and glorie both here and throughout all generations. Amen.
               
               Thus I leaue the Creator, with thankeſgiuing, and come now to treate of the creature.
               
                  In the next Chapter Moyſes recordeth mans creation; The Lord God alſo made man of the duſt of the earth:
                  Gen. 2.7.
That none ſhould pleaſe themſelues too much in the fleſh, it was made of duſt, and returneth to duſt againe.Why man was made of duſt and turneth to duſt againe.
But this Text calleth vs to conſider of the qualitie, ornament, and faſhion, rather then of the matter or ſubſtance of our creation, Let vs make man according to our image.
               
               The Scripture giueth this Image, both to the Sonne of God, and vnto man; not alike:The Son of God and man beare the image of God. for man is not the whole image of God; the Sonne is: Man is not the eſſentiall image, nor coeternall, nor of equall Maieſtie with God, as Chriſt is: man is the created, finite, and image of gratuitie; not the naturall or ingrauen image made vnto the image of God: the Sonne is the verie image of God, not made, nor created, but begotten.
               In the beginning God made man right; Hee looked vpon all that he had made, and they were very good.
                  Geneſ. 1.31. Beſides this generall goodneſſe;Man had ſome extraordinarie perfection. it ſeemeth here that in particular man had ſome extraordinarie perfection, as it were a Sunne of brightnes ſhining in him: for Moyſes relateth not a bare creation, but a creation accompliſhed with the image of God.
               I ſee you are not vnwilling to heare my poore meditation and diſcourſe hereof: let mee begge the aſsiſtance of your prayers alſo; then I truſt God will guide it to his glorie, &amp; your better ſatisfaction: otherwiſe it is a hard province that I take in hand. For what experience can we haue of this light, that feele nothing but darkeneſſe within our ſelues? Wee can haue no knowledge of this image by fruition, but by want of it. And what if the light of Scripture faileth too? Verily either

my eyes be dimme or there is not much ſet downe in preciſe termes, wherein Adam his perfection did conſiſt; Yet we may happily eſpy aglimpſe thereof in the darknes that poſſeſſeth vs. Contraries ſet together, do cleere one another: and by the reparation of mankinde, ſome eſtimate will bee made, what dignitie it was from whence he fell.
               
                  Flaccius Illiricus, a man otherwiſe notably learned; when he comes to conſider the nature and condition, as well of originall righteouſneſſe (which is certainely a great part of the image we ſeeke for) as of originall ſin: dares not ſay they be accidents, leſt he ſhould extenuate them. So by Flaccius his implication, this image muſt be the very ſubſtance of man, and then neceſſarily eyther body or ſoule. Sure not the bodie; that is but a lumpe of earth,The body of man is not the image of God. and hath no repreſentation of God at all: vnleſſe we ſhould make him a muddie God, as wee are called earthie by reaſon of theſe bodies of clay.
               Againe, when the image of God is defaced, yet wee ſee the bodie remaineth whole and entire. Anthropomorphites and Iewes may entertaine ſuch opinions: Chriſtians will eaſily conceiue that the bodie can be no image of God.
               Neither is it the ſoule of man; ſo when a man hath loſt the image of God,The ſoule is not the image of God. he ſhould looſe his ſoule withall: and after his fall man ſhould haue no ſoule vntill his regeneration and new birth.
               Are not the ſoules of many wicked ones in hell? Surely the image of God ſhall neuer come into hell, but that ſubſtance of man onely, which is deſtitute of Gods image. The image of God ſhall be with God in life, and euerlaſting ioy.
               
                  Let no man imagine that this image is any part of the ſoule now deſtroyed, and loſt by mans fall:No part of the ſoule is the image of God. the other powers of the ſoule remayning ſafe and without hurt. Forſeeing the ſoule is Tota in toto, &amp; tota in qualibet parte, it cannot be that any part of the ſoule ſhould be loſt, but that the whole ſubſtance muſt periſh with it; yea, and this inconuenience would follow (for contraries muſt be ſub eodem genere) that original ſinne, which is oppoſite to this image, ſhould be reckoned onely for a part of mans ſoule: &amp; ſo the corruption thereof ſhould not ſpread it ſe
                     •
                  fe to the whole man, but be reſtrayned only to one part of him, and the reſt abide ſound without infection.
               You ſee that the image of God, is neyther body nor ſoule, nor any part of one or other. What then? Verily the rightneſſe and perfection, connaturall and concreated in both.
               A faithfull Secretarie ſayth here, that man was made to the image of God; therefore it was no one portion of him that was made to that image, but the whole man. If the ſoule onely had beene made to the image of God, then muſt it be the ſoule alone that offended,The ſoule onely not made to the image of God. the ſoule onely that is puniſhable for the guilt of ſinne: But the Scripture teſtifieth that it was not the ſoule alone, that offended in eating the forbidden fruit; for the eyes alſo were in that treſpaſſe, the eares, the hands, the heart, and the whole body, as we ſee by the ſequell.
               The ſoule certainely is the fayrer ſubiect,The body is not vncapable of the image of God. 1. Cor. 6.19.
                   and the more beautifull harbour: but the bodie was not incapable of the image of God; then how ſhould it be the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt? That which receiueth God, is capable of his image.
               
                  I wil not be contentious in the cauſe, for the Church of God hath no ſuch cuſtome: but it ſeemeth verie reaſonable, for that to carrie the image of God before mans fall,That bare the image before mans faſt, which is redeemed and ſanctified to beare 
                        •
                     t againe, 1. Cor. 6.20.
                   which is redeemed by the pretious bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, and ſanctified to beare this image againe. And Chriſt hath redeemed the whole ſubſtance of man, bodie and ſoule; Know yee not that yee are bought with a price? glorifie God therefore in your bodies, and in your ſpirits, which are Gods: therefore the image of God was in both.
               What ſhall I ſay of our Regeneration? Doth it not ſhew where the image of God was placed? Is it not a reſtitution and reparation of that which was decayed or loſt? And we are regenerate both in body &amp; ſoule; therefore the image of God was in both. If the bodie be renued, if it be redeemed, if it be the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt, if it looke to be glorified; why ſhould it be vnworthie to beate ſome portion of Gods image?
               
                  The image of God.The image of God in my vnderſtanding, is that high perfection of whole Adam, and the integritie of all the powers both of his bodie and of his ſoule, and that conformitie or congruitie that he had with God his founder and Architypus.
               
               In that which followeth you doe expect, and I will endeuour to ſhew, what things they be that this image doth comprehend.
               
                  Theodoret.Some ſay that man was made to the image of God, in that dominion and power which was giuen him. The words following our Text, doe fauour that opinion; Let vs make man in our image, and let him rule ouer the fiſh of the Sea,
                  Image of God in dominion. 
                  and ouer the fowle of the heauen, and ouer the beaſts, and ouer all the earth, and ouer euery thing

that creepeth and moueth vnder the earth.
               
               S. Baſil. Mox atque creatus es, princeps creatus es: Aſſoone as thou waſt created, thou waſt made a Prince. again, Illud, Faciamus et Dominetur, declarat ibi eſſe imaginem Dei vbi potentia eſt dominandi: Thoſe termes, Let vs make, and, Let him haue rule, declareth the image of Cod to be, where the power of gouernement is. And who can doubt of this in Adam, that reades how the beaſts came to doe their homage and fealtie to him, as to the Lord and great maiſter of all the world?
               The Apoſtle would haue the man to pray bare headed, for as much as he is the image and glorie of God:
                  1. Cor. 11.7. 
                  but the woman is the glorie of the man, and not the image of God. This may not be vnderſtood of the integritie and rightneſſe of the inner man; thereof the woman was partaker as well as the man: in the Lord there is neyther male nor female. Therefore it muſt be vnderſtood of the glorie of dominion; that eccleſiaſticall and oeconomicall power was giuen to the man, and denyed to the woman.
               So then, to be created to the image of God, is to be placed in authoritie and gouernement. Hereupon the Magiſtrates in Scripture are called gods, Pſal. 82.
                  Pſal. 82.6. becauſe of their power.
               Behold one portion, not the whole image of God; whereunto vnleſſe inward rightneſſe be added, that power may ſoone degenerate into crueltie; and then it is ſo much the more dangerous in man then in any other creature, becauſe his iniuſtice is armed with reaſon. Therefore in the image of God, we do ioine, with that power which I haue ſpoken of, knowledge &amp; righteouſneſſe, as guardians and moderators of his power.
               
                  
                  Epheſ. 4.24.
                  S. Paul, Epheſ. 4. placeth the image of God in righteouſneſſe and holineſſe, figuratiuely by Synecdoche. For albeit theſe be principall and ſpeciall partes of the image of God, yet more is requiſite: they are not all, but ſuch as we ought chiefly to ſeeke, becauſe the reſt doe follow them. And now if you pleaſe to make triall, you may finde them both very plentifull in Adam.
               
               Firſt of his knowledge: if it may be eſteemed by the obiects, it will bee plaine that hee knew God, the creatures, and himſelfe. Was it poſſible that he, carrying the image of God, receiuing rules of his life immediatly from God, hauing moſt ſweete and familiar conference and conuerſation with God, ſhould be ignorant of any thing that pertayned to God, and meet for him to know? Againe, knowing God truely and rightly, what could he want in the knowledge of the creatures? He that gaue names to euery beaſt, according to their diſpoſition and nature, and hee that receiued charge from God to dreſſe the Garden; needed no Geſner, no Plinie, no Aristotle to inſtruct him de Historia animalium, or to informe him of the natures of any of the creatures. And was his knowledge like hypocrites eyes, that ſee, extramittendo, non intromittendo, quicke abroad and dull at home; able to diſcerne moates in others, and not beames in themſelues? No, Adam was not ſo; he vnderſtood as much of himſelfe, as he did of anie thing elſe.
               Though hee was in a deepe ſleepe when Eue was taken out of him, and felt nothing; though the rib which ſhe was made of, was cloſed vp again, and fleſh put into the place thereof, that he miſſed nothing; yet aſſoone as the woman was brought vnto him, he cryed out by

and by, This is fleſh of my fleſh, and bone of my bone: which he could neuer haue done, without an admirable light and knowledge of himſelfe and his owne nature.
               I haue giuen you a taſte of his knowledge: conſider now, and looke if it were eclipſed by anie waywardnes or indiſpoſition of his will.Gen. 2.17. The faſhion of the commaundement proues the contrarie; At what day ſoeuer thou eatest the fruite, thou ſhalt die the death. Sure the iuſtice of God is ſo vnreproueable, that he would neuer haue mentioned, much leſſe inflicted penaltie, had not the will of man bene moſt free to performe all that was required.
               God made man right; and what rightneſſe could he haue without a free will? Hee was created to the image of God; and is any thing more agreeable thereunto, then true and perfect libertie? Hee was crowned with glorie and honour; and what honour can there be, where libertie and freedome wanteth?
               To conclude this point then: As Adams mind did rightly know God, that he would be worſhipped with feare and loue; ſo did his heart and will accord to doe it affectionately with all their power. Neyther was there any thing at all in the whole nature of man (for then he did not ſo much as thinke of ſinne) but that his minde might vnderſtand all righteouſneſſe, and that which he vnderſtood the whole man might deſire, and that which he deſired, he might performe alſo, without any interruption or let. Marke then the righteouſneſſe of that bleſſed man: As God was all 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , and imbraced man with a fatherly affection; ſo Adam in a kind of interchange of pietie, was all 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , and interteyned the loue of God with true loue againe.
               
                  Oh that he had beene as firme and conſtant to the end as he was ſtaight and right in the beginning. Improbitas illo fuit admirabilis aeuo. He was created to the image of God, and therefore alſo to immortalitie &amp; perpetuall ſocietie with God.
               If man had beene mortall by his creation, he had not then beene made to the image of God: Mortall nature is not the image of God immortall; neyther is the immortall God a patterne of a mortall creature.
               Beſides, death and mortalitie came of ſinne, and are the rewards of ſinne. And then Adam was ſo free from ſinne, that he thought not of it before his fall; therefore no place left for death: and where death cannot enter, there muſt be immortalitie. You will aske then, how he ſhould haue bin preſerued from age, from infirmitie, and from death? Well enough, if nothing had come to procure them.
               
                  Si enim vestibus Iſraelitarum praeſtitit Deus per annos quadraginta ſine vllo detrimento proprium ſtatum:
                  Aug. de bono Coniugal. c. 2. 
                  quanto magis praestaret corporibus obedientium praecepto ſuo foeliciſsimum quoddam temperamentum certi ſtatus: donec in melius conuerterentur, non morte hominis qua corpus ab anima deſeritur, ſed beata commutatione ab animali ad ſpiritualem vitam: For if God by the ſpace of fourtie yeares gaue a continuance to the Iſraelites attire, without any hinderance or wearing them out; how much more would he haue giuen a moſt happie temperature of a certaine perpetuitie to their bodies, obeying his commaundement, vntill they had receiued a better chaunge; not by death, wherein the ſoule doth forſake the bodie, but by a bleſſed chaunge from the naturall to the ſpirituall life.
               
                  This is the receiued opinion of Diuines; That if Adam had not ſinned, then aſſoone as the number of Saints had beene accompliſhed, men ſhould haue been tranſlated from earth to heauen;Heb. 11.
                        •
                     . 2. Reg. 2.11. from their naturall life to the ſpiritual life, as we reade of Henoch and Elias.
               
               Immortalitie is the laſt beame, and as it were the cloſe of Adams brightneſſe, to giue continuance to the reſt of his endowments; and by them alſo immortalitie it ſelfe is illuſtrated. For if it be ſeuered from the reſt, then is it a detriment, and no benefite: as in the wicked and damned, immortalitie ſhall be no radiant beame of light, but a perpetuitie of darkeneſſe. This is one point to be conſidered in Adams immortalitie.
               Another, that his immortalitie muſt not be meaſured by the extent thereof: for ſo you ſhall finde it but ſhort, narrow, diarie; an immortalitie peraduenture of one dayes continuance. But looke vpon it in the foundation, and there you may finde matter to proue it. For if Adam, after hee was made infirme and bruiſed by ſinne, adiudged to death, and expulſed out of Paradiſe, did yet for all that linger in the earth,Gen. 5.5. &amp; 27. after it was curſed too, nine hundreth and thirtie yeares; Iared nine hundreth ſixtie two yeares, Methuſalem nine hundreth and ſixtie nine yeares: might they not haue liued more eaſily ſo many thouſands or millions of yeares, in their healthfull Parke, if they had perſiſted with integritie? No doubt they might. That holy place which caſt out ſinners, would neuer haue admitted death. For aſſurance hereof, hee had an infallible pawne and pledge in the Tree of life, as a Sacrament that conſigned immortalitie to him: So he had this complemēt of Gods image, becauſe it was in his power not to die.
               
                  Farewell then mortall and immortall Adam: immortall from God, and mortall by your ſelfe: immortall in creation, and mortall in treſpaſſe, mortall in acte, but immortall in poſsibilitie and power.
               Now you haue, according to the ſlenderneſſe of my vnderſtanding, the whole quadrant of mans perfection; the height, and depth, and length, and breadth, euen all the dimentions of the image of God: ſquared on one ſide with abſolute authoritie ouer all the creatures, on the other ſide with the perſpicacie of knowledge, on the third, with ſinceritie of righteouſneſſe, on the fourth, with poſſeſsion of immortalitie; that which way ſoeuer he be placed, you may finde him a perfect and happie man.
               And who could haue deſired more? I gheſſe what you think; but ſo it would not haue bin well: I would haue all Praedicatores, non argumentatores, Magnifiers rather then diſputers of Gods workes.
               Peraduenture you wiſh that theſe rich iewels might haue beene ſo faſtened to our parents, that they ſhould not haue loſt them; and that man when he had all this honour, might haue beene no changling. If the creature had receiued this, what ſhould the Soueraigne haue reſerued for himſelfe? Immutabilitie is ſo peculiar to God alone, that it cannot be communicated to any other.Eſa. 42.8. Doth he not ſay, Gloriam meam alteri non dabo? I will not giue my glorie to another? Doth hee not ſay,Mal. 3.6. 
                  Ego Deus, &amp; non mutor? I am God, and in me is no change? Doth hee not therein plainely let vs vnderſtand, that all things elſe muſt be variable? Doth not our Text tell vs, that his purpoſe was to make a man, and not a God? Was it not ſufficient that God made

him right? I, but hee left man power to ſinne alſo. True: yet in that he ſinned, the fault was not in God that left him power, but in the man himſelfe, that abuſed this power, and converted it to the vſe of ſinne, which he receiued for the glorie of not ſinning. Albeit he ſinned by meanes of the freedom which he receiued, yet did he ſinne, not becauſe he could, but becauſe hee would ſinne: will you haue that proued?
               When the Deuill and his complices tranſgreſſed, the holy Angels did not tranſgreſſe: Why? Not becauſe they could not, (for they had free-will too) but becauſe they would not. O malum liberum arbitrium, quod adhuc incolume parum habuit firmitatis: O vnhappie free-will, which had ſo little conſtancie when it was ſound.
               Let vs put the caſe, that God had giuen man ſuch a light as hee could not extinguiſh: What praiſe? what glorie? what retribution ſhould he haue expected for doing well, if he could not haue done otherwiſe? what then? If God made man right, and afterward left him in the hand of his owne counſell; was it not that his well doing ſhould be the more glorious, when hee had power to doe otherwiſe?
               When the kinde father had giuen one moytie of his goods to an vnthriftie ſonne,Luc. 15.12.13. which waſted it by prodigalitie, Where was the fault, in the father that gaue it, or in the ſonne that ſpent it to his ouerthrow?
               
                  Cur ergo non faceret Deus hominem, quamvis eum peccaturum praenoſceret: cum &amp; ſtantem coronaret,
                  Aug. de catechiſ. rudib. cap. 18. 
                  &amp; cadentem ordinaret, &amp; ſurgentem adiuvaret, ſemper &amp; vbique glorioſus bonitate, iuſtitiâ, clementiâ? Wherefore then ſhould not God make man, although hee had a foreknowledge

that the man would ſinne? when as hee crowned the man ſtanding, ordered his fall, and did helpe his riſing; euen God that is alwayes and euerie where glorious in goodneſſe, righteouſneſſe and clemencie. So let him be acknowledged and prayſed in the Church through all generations. AMEN.

               THE MISERY OF MANS FALL.
               
                  
                     
                        ROM. 5. VERS. 9.
                     
                     As by one mans diſobedience many were made ſinners; ſo by the obedience of one, ſhall many alſo be made righteous.
                  
               
               
                  THE obedience of Chriſt is much magnified, and very iuſtly: it fayled not in the leaſt tittle; it continued to the laſt period of humane, things, euen vnto death: he preferred it aboue life, and was content to loſe his life rather then his obedience; therefore it was great euery way. But how we may reckon ſo ſecurely of it, as if we had performed it our ſelues; or how one mans obedience may ſerue ſo many thouſand beleeuers, euen good conſciences ſometimes wauer; others that haue not beene inſtructed, wonder, and certaine ſcoffe at it as a Paradox. For ſatisfaction of all, the Apoſtle here maketh the matter plaine, by a golden compariſon of the ruine and reſtitution of mankind. Theſe two, being contraries, muſt follow one rule: But there is no other courſe taught, no manner deliuered for the reſtitution, ſaue

that which happened before in the ruine of mankind; Therefore all doubts, wonderments, and ſcoffes may ceaſe. Chriſt is no leſſe effectuall to bring righteouſneſſe into the world, then Adam was to bring ſinne: But by one, that is, by Adam alone, ſinne entred ouer all; And is it poſsible then that Chriſts righteouſneſſe ſhould be defectiue? The Apoſtle ſaith no to it: As by one mans diſobedience many were made ſinners: So by the obedience of one, ſhall many alſo be made righteous.
               
               
                  Quem ſupplantavit aliena malitia, prodeſſe ei poteſt charitas aliena. If one mans diſobedience wounded mee, may not another mans obedience heale me? Yes verily: Euen ſo then (ſweet Lord) let it be thy good pleaſure to deliuer me. For I was taken by theft out of the land of the Ebrewes,
                  Gen. 40.15. and caſt into this dungeon, if not altogether guiltleſſe, yet in reſpect of him that ſeduced me, ſomewhat innocent. Is not this Naomie, that beautifull creature, that was like a little god vpon earth? adorned with his image, armed with his authoritie, inſpired with his righteouſneſſe, furniſhed with an abilitie and power of immortalitie? Yes verily But the voyce of the Turtle doue is now he

                      our land:
                  Cant. 2.12. a voice of ſorrow and heauineſſe, therefore call him not Naomie,
                  Ruth. 1.20. that is, beautifull (as ſhe ſaith in Ruth) but call him Mara, that is, bitter. For he that might haue perpetuated our glorie, in ſtead thereof hath left vs much bitterneſſe.
               Is it not a grieuous neceſsitie, that he hath conueyed guiltineſſe ſooner then life? that wee ſhould be ſinfull before we haue ſinned? tranſgreſſors ere wee haue treſpaſſed? that one man ſhould eate of the ſoure grape, and all our teeth be ſet on edge?Iere. 31.29.
               
               
                  But complaints are not pleaſing, when they be neceſſary: and I would not begin my tunes with a dump. The conſideration of Gods purpoſe and counſaile herein is of ſweeter conſequence. And yet the holy One of Iſrael is ſo free from any charge in Adams fall, or other heauie occurrents in the diſpenſation of the Olde Teſtament, that his principall intents are onely in the New. Here is the bodie, there be but ſhadowes: here is the accōpliſhmēt, there is but the A, B, C, &amp; beginnings. the truth is here, there are but figures: or if truth be there too, it is ſo muffled vp with ceremonies, that it cannot be eaſily diſcerned, without ſome luſtre from hence. For the Law was giuen by Moyſes, but grace and truth came by Ieſus Christ.
                  Ioh. 1.17.
               
               
                  Adams reuolt, and the contagion thereof, regiſtred in the Old Teſtament, are not the principall matters of God his intendment: if we ſhould reſt there and go no further, what can they yeeld vs but aſtoniſhment, horror, and ſad impreſsions?
               The chiefe decree, purpoſe, and counſaile of God from all eternitie, was to elect men to ſaluation for his glorie. In the execution of this decree Adam fell, not without the foreſight of God, who in his vnſpeakeable bountie would neuer haue ſuffered it, as S. Augustine writeth, vnleſſe he had beene alſo of omnipotent wiſedome, to extract good out of euill, and to bring light out of darkeneſſe. Therefore he ſubordinated it, made it ſerue his purpoſe, and ſet Adam for a ſigne. So our Apoſtle writeth, that hee is a figure of him that is to come, Verſ. 14.
               
               The firſt man did ſhadow out the ſecond: the earthy man repreſented the heauenly: that which ſhould bee

performed in the one, was foreſhewed in the other. Adams diſobedience was a typicall prophecie of Chriſt his obedience: the propagation of his ſinne, and the puniſhment thereof a propheticall teſtimonie of the imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, and the efficacie thereof.
               Seeing then that it pleaſed God in our verie fall to reueale the goodneſſe of his counſell, for our reſtitution: to propound Adam as a type of Chriſt, and by wofull experience of that wee feele come from the former, ſweetly to forewarne and inſtruct vs comfortably, what to expect from the other; wee haue the more encouragement to attend to this compariſon, that is auowed with ſo good authoritie:Pſal. 126.5. 
                  If we begin in teares, wee ſhall reape in ioy. If the entrance, propagation, and puniſhment of ſinne be tragicall and ſorrowfull; the profligation of it, and the reentry, diffuſion, certaintie and glory of righteouſneſſe will exceed in comfort.
               The compariſon offereth vs a view of both: of the beginning and progreſſe of ſinne, &amp; righteouſneſſe too. The Apoſtle beginneth firſt with ſinne; not for order, or any originall prioritie that it had in the beginning: he ſaith, that by the diſobedience of one man, many were made ſinners; at the firſt therefore was nothing but righteouſneſſe.
               Now the courſe is prepoſterous: for that is not firſt which is ſpirituall,
                  1. Cor. 15.46. 
                  but that which is naturall, &amp; then that which is ſpirituall.
               
               Euen ſo the Apoſtle proceedeth; not to righteouſneſſe, which was firſt in order, but to ſinne, which hath gotten to be the firſt by diſorder: Eſau got precedence, but Iacob hath the bleſsing.
               
                  
                  As by one mans diſobedience &amp;c. It is ſpoken indefinitely: therefore for this one man, if we make ſearch and enquire who he was, it is not altogether without cauſe. In the Epiſtle to Timothy,
                  1. Tim. 2.14. Saint Paul qualifieth Adam his offence: for hee ſaith that Adam was not deceiued, but the woman was deceiued, and was in the tranſgreſsion. Eccleſiasticus cap. 25. A muliere initium factum est peccati, &amp; per illam omnes morimur:
                  Ecclus. 25.24. Sinne had beginning from the woman, and by her meanes wee doe all die.
               In like ſort S. Augustine writeth alſo, lib. 4. de ciuit. Dei cap. 11. Non existimavit Sathan. The Deuill did not thinke that the man would be eaſily credulous, or ſoone to be beguiled, but by yeelding to the error of another. As it was with Aaron, who in likelyhood would not conſent to the peoples errour, for making of an Idoll, by inducements of perſwaſion; but was faine to yeelde to the importunitie of their ſway. As alſo it is not credible that Salomon did ſerue idols of ignorance, but that he was drawne to ſuch ſacriledge by feminine flatteries &amp; inticements: So S. Aug. conceiueth of Adam, that he beleeued not the Serpent, but conſented to his wife of matrimoniall indulgence, and would not bee ſeuered from his onely conſort and companion, not in the communion of her ſinne. Etſi credendo non ſunt ambo decepti, peccando tamen ambo capti ſunt &amp; Diaboli laqueis implicati: Although man and woman both were not deceiued in beleeuing the Serpent; yet both of them were catched and intangled in the Deuils ſnares.
               But when God ſayth in Geneſis,
                  Gen. 3.22. 
                  Behold Adam is become like to one of vs, knowing good and euill, it confuteth S. Augustines coniecture, and ſheweth manifeſtly that

                  Adam alſo was circumvented with errour, and ouertaken in fraude: elſe why is this worke put vpon him? Wherefore doth God vpbraid him ſo ironically, that he is now like vnto God? This Sarcaſmus, in my vnderſtanding, is a taxation of his credulous temeritie, in beleeuing the Serpents promiſe. Irridens vtique Deus non approbans hoc dixit, quod putabas te ſimilem fore nostri; ergo quia voluisti eſſe quod non eras, deſijsti eſſe quod eras. S. Ambr. de Elia &amp; ieiun. For God ſpeakes it by deriſion, not by allowance: Thou haddeſt a conceit to become like vnto vs; therefore in affecting to be more then thou waſt indeede, thou haſt loſt euen that excellencie which thou didſt receiue.
               
                  1. Tim. 2.14.When S. Paul writ to Timothie, that Adam was not deceiued, but the woman; he meant not to extenuate the mans offence, or to exempt him from the fraude or impoſture of the Deuill: but to ſhew whether ſexe was more credulous, infirme, and like to be ſeduced. Herein he concludeth the woman to be the weaker veſſell, and forbiddeth her to teach in the Church, becauſe that when ſhe was yet perfect and ſound, the Serpent began with her as the eaſier to be deceiued.
               Saint Paul did thinke that the Serpent would reſort to his former inſtrument, and ſo hold the miniſtrie in leſſe regard, for the weakeneſſe of their ſexe. Behold S. Pauls proiect in the words to Timothy.
               
               Here in this Text another matter is in hand. No queſtion here, whether the man or woman was firſt in preuarication: were that the point, the Deuill in his pride would haue the ſtart of both; Hee was a ſinner from the beginning. The propagation of ſinne is the thing now conſiderable, and what perſon it was that brought

a ſucceſsion of ſinne throughout all mankinde. And as well here, as in all other places, the Scripture attributeth the matter of propagation, not to women but to men.
               Therefore we will diſmiſſe Eue, if you pleaſe, as our Sauiour Chriſt diſmiſſed the woman taken in adultery;Ioh. 8.11. not for an innocent, but becauſe ſhe is not here impleaded: Adam is the man which the Apoſtle now chargeth. Wherewith is it? For gluttonie, or intemperance of his throate? No: there was affluence of all other delicacies in Paradiſe to ſatisfie ſuch deſires. Is it for his curioſitie and vaine loue of knowledge? Neyther: For although that be a fault, to be wiſe beyond ſobrietie, yet could it not haue brought ſo heauie a ſequele. What was it then? He affected that fruite, Non veſcendi libidine, ſed animoſitate exultandi; not in any lingering deſire to the meate, but in a kind of luſtineſſe to breake out. What greater luſtineſſe, then that this childe of the earth was not content to be like vnto God, vnleſſe he might alſo be equall with him?
               
                  Quid huic deerat, quem miſericordia custodiebat, docebat veritas, regebat iustitia, pax fouebat. Sed heu ad multam inſipientiam &amp; perniciem ſibi ac poſteris ſuis deſcendit de Hieruſalem in Hiericho. Siquidem incidit in latrones à quibus legitur deſpoliatus. Annon deſpoliatus qui domino veniente nudum ſe eſſe conqueritur. nec vero poterat reveſtiri, vel ablata ſibi recipere veſtimenta, niſi Chriſtus amitteret ſua. O venenum quod non curatur niſi veneno.
               
               Saint Paul heere frameth two inditements againſt him: the one for diſobedience; the other for tranſmitting his ſinne. By one mans diſobedience many were made ſinners. Obſerue the right valuation, and true qualitie

of Adam his treſpaſſe: that it was not any light errour, but an abſolute prevarication of both Tables; a diſobedience to God, and a grieuance vnto men.
               
                  Primordialis lex eſt data in paradiſo quaſi matrix omnium praeceptorum: That firſt Law (ſaith Tertullian) giuen in Paradiſe, was the ſumme and comprehenſion of the whole diuine Law, that was publiſhed afterwards. Therefore in the breach thereof, all manner of offences are conteyned.
               But if the fruite were good, why ſhould it not be taſted? if it were euill, what did it in paradiſe? The fruit certainely was good, but obedience better; becauſe the whole law is performed with obedience.
               Indeed nothing is more expedient for the ſoule then obedience. And if it behooue euery ſoule to obey: the ſeruant his Lord, the childe his father, the wife her huſband; all to obey the Prince: how much importeth it man to obey God?1. Sam. 15.23. for rebellion is as execrable as witchcraft, which is a manifeſt reuolt and diſauowing of God: and he hateth nothing more then the diſobeence of his commaundements. That now is this one mans caſe.
               
                  As by the diſobedience of one man &amp;c. If I ſhould here diſcuſſe, where his diſobedience began firſt; whether in his minde, or in his body: ſome happily would ſay,Hieron. ep. 29. as S. Auguſtine writeth, That it were more worth our labour, to ſeeke remedie to get out, then to argue how or by what part we came firſt into the pit of ſinne. And that, God willing, ſhall not bee omitted in the fit place, but reſerued to another time. In the meane while, Quod ſi quiſquam dicat, If any man thinke (ſaith S. Auguſtine) that the bodie is the firſt cauſe of all

ſinnes, certainely he hath not well conſidered the whole nature of mankind. Indeed the bodie that is corruptible, aggrauateth the ſoule, and the earthy manſion keepeth downe the minde. Vt vidi, vt perij, vt me malus abſtulit error?
               
               Oftentimes our right eyes offend vs, becauſe they roll, they wander; they are regenerate but in part, and death entreth into the ſoule

                   that window.Matth. 6.23. 
                  Si oculus tuus fuerit nequam, totum corpus eſt tenebroſum: If thine eye be euill, thy whole body is full of darkeneſſe.
               Shut that window in the name of God, make a couenant with it, turne it away that it behold not vanitie;Rom. 6.13.
                  Giue not your members as weapons of vnrighteouſneſſe vnto ſinne.
               
               
                  Surgit ira: noli dare irae linguam ad maledicendum, noli dare manum aut pedem ad feriendum. non ſurgeret iſta ira irration abilis, niſi peccatum eſſet interius, ſed tolle illi regnū, non habeat arma vnde contra te pugnet: diſcet etiam non ſurgere, cum arma non coeperit inuenire. S. Aug. Tract. in Ioh. 41.
               
               The bodily members are the inſtruments, they are not the originall of ſinne. Will you haue a proofe thereof in the matter we handle? It is not to be doubted, but this one man, and the woman too, had ſeene the Tree of the knowledge of good and euill formerly without any luſt or deſire to taſte the fruite: the faith that he then bare to God, was a guardian to his heart; and that to all his ſenſes. But after his heart had once reuolted from faith and loyaltie, all the outward ſenſes were corrupted with it inſtantly.
               
                  Euerie man is tempted,
                  Iam. 1.14. 
                  when hee is drawne away by his owne Concupiſcence, and is entiſed.
                  
Then when luſt hath conceiued, it bringeth forth the act of ſinne, but the beginning is from the mind within.Matth. 15.19. 
                  Out of the heart come euill thoughts, murthers, adulteries, fornications, thefts, falſe teſtimonies, ſlanders. Non poteſt fieri (ſaith S. Auguſtine) vt habeat mala facta, qui habet cogitationes bonas; facta enim de cogitationibus procedunt: It is not poſsible that a man exerciſed in good thoughts, ſhould be much tainted with ill actions; for all actions proceed from our thoughts. Then keepe thine heart with all diligence,
                  Prou. 4.23. 
                  for thereout commeth life.
               
               Therefore I cannot hold with them, that make all the ſinnes of the ſoule to proceede from the bodie: ſo the wicked Angels wanting bodies, ſhould want ſinne too; and the ſpirits of the damned aſſoone as they bee ſequeſtred from their bodies, ſhould ceaſe alſo from their ſinne. It is but a Poets opinion concerning ſoules puritie:

                     Igneus eſt ollis vigor &amp; Coeleſtis origo
                     
                        Aeneid. lib. 6.Seminibus: quantum non noxia corpora tardant;
                     Terrenique hebetant artus, moribundaque membra.
                  
                  Virgil is no claſsicall authour in matters of doctrine: the Fathers of the Church are more authenticall S. Bernard ſpeaking of the ſoule, ſaith otherwiſe; Prior reparanda eſt, quam conſtat corruiſſe priorem. Anima ſiquidem corrupta in culpam, fecit quo
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      vt corpus corrumperetur in poenam. So S. Auguſtine reſolueth the doubt; that the corruption of the fleſh, which ladeth the ſoule, was not the cauſe, but the puniſhment of the firſt ſinne: and it was not the corruptible fleſh that made the ſoule ſinfull, but it was the ſinne of the ſoule that made the

bodie corruptible. Eſt mens primum veteris hominis membrum, &amp; primus peccati adminiſter, nativa prauitate infecta, &amp; ſuggeſtionum Sathanae capax; hinc motus praui, mali &amp; de malo, quamvis nihil acceſſerit vltra his mens impellit voluntatem, quae tunc altera peccati miniſtra efficitur, &amp; concupiſcentias parit, tunc tandem corpus ab animo impulſum totum accenditur, huc atque illuc tranſuerſum rapitur; omnes ſenſus adeoque omnia corporis tyranni arbitrio ſe ſiſtunt,
                  Gal. 5.19.20. 
                  ad perpetranda omnia quae imperat. hinc fructus amari qui Gal. 5. recenſentur. The minde is the firſt member of the old man, and miniſter of ſinne, infected certainly with originall prauitie, and capable of Sathans ſuggeſtions; from hence come ill motions which are euill, and proceede from euill, if there were nothing elſe: but with theſe the minde ſtirreth the will, which is then made another miniſter of ſinne, and bringeth forth concupiſcence: then the bodie, being ſummoned by the mind, is kindled,is tranſported hither and thither; ſo the ſenſes, and all parts of the bodie, offer themſelues at the tyrants pleaſure to do all his commands: thereout ſpring thoſe bitter fruits that are rehearſed in the fift of the Galathians.
               
               Whether it were the one or the other: that the bodie were in diſobedience before the ſoule, or the ſoule before the bodie: whether the blinde did leade the lame, or the lame were guide to the blinde; behold now both are fallen into the ditch, and ouerſhadowed, not with a cloud, but with a verie night of darkeneſſe.
               In this one mans diſobedience we ſee that verified, which Chriſt ſaith in the Goſpel,Ioh. 3.20. 
                  They that doe euill ſhun the light, becauſe their workes are euill. He is no ſooner fallen, then he becommeth Lucifuga, affecteth darkneſſe,

and flyeth to the couert to hide himſelfe. His body and the parts thereof, are the ſame that they were before; but then they were ſeene with glorie, and now they are couered with ſhame: his wil is auerſe, his heart is full of feare and diſtruſt, his very minde is darkened, which ſhould be the light, the watchman, the Centinel both of body and ſoule; and if the light thereof be turned into darkeneſſe,
                  Matth. 6.23. 
                  O how great muſt that darkeneſſe be? Greater verily then the darkneſſe of Egypt, which was not ſo vniuerſall, but that there was light left in the land of Goſen,Exod. 10.23. where the children of Iſrael were.
               But here, after mans diſobedience darkeneſſe preuailed ouer all. No power of the minde, no part of the bodie free or cleere: hee is not abſolutely depriued of naturall faculties, and endowments of reaſon, iudgement, will, as if he were become a blocke; but they are depraued and decayed: he knowes ſtill, marie it is but in part; and what part? his mind doth vnderſtand, but humane things, &amp; not diuine; earthly, &amp; not heauenly buſineſſe: his will doth affect alſo and deſire; &amp; what? ſure bodily pleaſures or delights, not ſpirituall ioyes.
               Wiſt ye not that when the fountaine of all goodnes was forſaken, nothing would remaine but ſinne? when the father of lights was left, that darkeneſſe would couer all?
               
                  Sine tuà luce ô lux beatiſsima non eſt veritas, adeſt error, adeſt vanitas:
                  Aug. Soliloq. ca. 3. 
                  non est diſcretio, adeſt confuſio: adest ignorantia, non eſt ſcientia: adest caecitas, non eſt viſio: adest invium, non eſt via: adest mors, non eſt vita. S. Aug. Solil. cap.3. Without thy light, ô bleſſed light, there is no truth, all is error, all is vanitie: there is no diſtinction, all is confuſion: all is ignorance, there is no knowledge:

all is blindneſſe, there is no ſight: all impaſsible, there is no way: all is death, there is no life. When he beleeued that which the Deuill promiſed, was hee not very worthie to finde that which God threatned?
               You haue heard the mans diſobedience to God: It reſteth now to ſhew, how alſo he offended his neighbor therein, namely, by tranſmitting ſinne to his poſteritie. By his diſobedience many were made guiltie: Here I doe willingly call you to remembrance, that Adam did not ſinne as an ordinarie perſon; for ſo his ſinne had reſted in himſelfe, and determined there. It was Iobs perſwaſion in his owne particular:Iob 19.4. 
                  Though I had indeed erred, mine errour remaineth with me. Doth it not hold good correſpondencie with the rule of Iuſtice?Ezech. 18.20. 
                  The ſoule that ſinneth, that ſoule ſhall die. Adams caſe is not ſo, it is extraordinarie.
               As God had beautified the whole nature of mankind with excellent gifts in this one man, vpon the condition of his loyaltie and obedience: ſo was he reſolute to bereaue it of them all in him againe, aſſoone as he began to be refractorie or diſobedient.
               Who can diſtaſte this iuſtice, or finde any harſhnes in it, when both were propounded vnto the man vpon equall termes?
               Hereby alſo it may appeare that Adam ſinned, not as a priuate man: but as the common root or ſtocke of mankind; as a publique perſon, and father of vs all. When ſinne had once got hold of his perſon, muſt it not needes taint vs all that are partakers of his nature? Becauſe we were all encloſed in his loines when he ſinned, hee branded vs all with the prints and tincture of his rebellion. So this diſobedience reſted not in Adam,
                  
but became hereditarie: it was not perſonall in him alone, but naturall to vs all, and a matter of ſucceſsion. It made him a treſpaſſer, &amp; vs all ſinners with him; whether Pelagius will or no. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . None is free, not a childe of a day olde, though Anabaptiſts be mad for it.
               We doe all die; neither doth there liue a man vpon earth, which ſhall not ſee death: and therefore we doe all ſinne, For death is the reward of ſinne; or elſe ſome ſhould be equal vnto Chriſt,Rom. 6.23. and die without guiltines. It is cleare and manifeſt that many die before any act of guiltineſſe be committed; as infants: therefore they muſt haue the guiltineſſe of their death deriued from others: That the Apoſtle auoweth here to be originally from Adam. As in one perſon there be diuerſe members, which be all guiltie when the perſon is conuicted: ſo in the nature of mankind, there be many perſons, as it were ſeuerall members and parts thereof, and when the whole was corrupted, euery particular, communicating therewith, muſt needes haue the ſame tainture. And as a cankred roote, doeth ſend foorth cankred boughes; a maſſe of leauen, leuened loaues; the egges of a Cockatriſe, venemous ſerpents: ſo Adam entring into diſobedience, begetteth diſobedient children. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ; of an ill bird, worſe chickins.
               
                  Gen. 5.3.The holy Ghoſt is my warrant, that Adam did beget a ſonne, not according to the image of God, whereunto he was created himſelfe; for that was then aboliſhed, but in his owne image, when it was fowly degenerated.
               Iudge now whether we doe beare the puniſhment of another mans tranſgreſsion, or are guiltie in our owne

faults. If one mans diſobedience brought ſuch an Iliade of ſorrowes; what muſt our guiltineſſe be that haue added many, and many actuall tranſgreſsions to his originall corruption? Much euery way, &amp; too too much.
               Let no man then qualifie Adams ſinne, or his owne, with vaine excuſes; as if his diſobedience had not bene capitall, but veniall, and a trifle to eate of an apple. The leſſe the thing was that God did forbid, the more eaſily he might haue forborne, and kept the commandement. No, no, there is not any thing light, not any thing little, not any thing of ſmall regard in diſobedience, and diſobedience of God, and of ſuch a God as he had ſhewed himſelfe to Adam: all is heynous, all horrible, all heauie, all a talent of lead.
               Yet in this paſſage I will commend a caution vnto you, and wiſh diligent heed to be taken of two extremities; That we neyther extend our corruption too farre, leſt we depraue the glorie of our Creator: nor eleuate it too much, leſt wee depreſſe the benefite of our Redeemer.
               The Scholemen and Church of Rome, runne too much on the left hand, and offend in the latter; whileſt they goe about to make originall ſinne (that is, the venome which Adam hath conveyed vnto vs) to be but a light and ſuperficiall accident, eaſily remoued; and, as they termed it in their late Councell of Trent, not true ſinne, but only the froth and ſcumme of ſinne, Seſsion. 5. can. 6.
               
               When originall ſinne is thus extenuated, conſider (I beſeech you) what, and how little it is that they leaue to the redemption and benefit of Chriſt? Not actuall,

not any great or enormious ſinne; ſuch muſt be holpe by our owne penance, prayers, almes, and ſatisfaction: Nor my foule ſpots of originall ſinne; that they account to be but an abilitie, or diſpoſition to ſinne, and a matter of nothing. So by their doctrine, the Sonne of God watched and prayed, and faſted, was tempted with hunger, thirſt, buffets, ſcourges, indignities, and with a moſt painefull and ſhamefull death, for a matter of nothing.
               What is contumelious to the gratious benefit of our redemption, if this be not? Is not this to giue a thouſand to our Redeemer, and ten thouſand to our ſelues?
               
                  Illyricus runneth vpon the rocke, which is on the other ſide, and goeth too far on the right hand; perſwading that the ſinne which Adam hath conueyed to vs, to be our very ſubſtance.
               Sure there cannot be any thing added to the diſeaſe in this kinde, but that which muſt detract from the Creator: our ſubſtance is of his building. And is it not a ſtrange amplification of the diſeaſe, that brings diſhonour, inſtead of glory to the Phyſitian? If original ſinne be of mans ſubſtance, muſt it not needs haue tainted Chriſt? it is moſt certaine that he tooke our whole ſubſtance: how could he be true man, without the ſubſtance of man?
               This ſinne which is tranſmitted to vs all, is no part of mans nature, but a deprauation of it, ſpreading it ſelfe ouer all, &amp; creeping into our marrow and moſt hidden entrailes.
               There is a ſecret poiſon within vs, like vnto the graines of Muſtard ſeede, little in the beginning, but groweth to a great tree. There want no ſubtile practiſes

without vs, according to the depthes of Sathan, inſinuated ſo couertly, that they are ſcarce marked from whence they come, nor whither they tend.
               I would I were able to diſtinguiſh them vnto you: but I cannot deliuer that which I haue not receiued. There is morbus Mentis, and morſus Serpentis: malum innatum, and malum ſeminatum: pactus Cordis, &amp; ſeminarium hoſtis. They are not one, but agree in one: both are the ſower fruites of this mans fatall diſobedience. Thereby hee receiued the one, admitted the other, and tranſmitted both vnto vs all: And they are ſufficient, eyther for conception or production of ſinne. So by one mans diſobedience wee are all made ſinners.
               
               Peraduenture ſome will ſay, that this man, by whom ſinne came, was receiued into fauour againe. And what queſtion ſoeuer others may make, my opinion is verily according to charitie, that Adam was ſaued, and had preſent forgiueneſſe of his ſinne. Then you will aske, how he ſhould tranſmit that ſinne to his poſterity, that was remitted to himſelfe?
               Saint Augustine anſwereth, that the Saints children diſcend from their parents by carnall generation, not by ſpirituall regeneration. But Adams ſinne was forgiuen: I graunt it, yet that was not a matter of nature, where the fountaine of generation reſted; the forgiueneſſe of his ſinne was a matter of Grace, in the power of GOD, not in Adams fleſh.
               For how was his ſinne forgiuen? not by taking ſinne abſolutely away from him, but by not imputing it vnto him. This imputation was not in

                  Adams power, but in Gods good pleaſure; therefore he could not tranſmit it to his poſteritie: He tranſmitted onely his owne tainture and mortalitie.
               You know how the Husbandman doth purge and cleanſe the ſeede that hee caſteth into the ground; he threſheth it from the ſtraw, winnoweth it from the chaffe, ſiftieth it from all hoore, and ſo ſoweth bare and cleane corne: yet it commeth vp not pure corne, but ioyned with ſtraw, and couered with eares. How ſo? Becauſe it had theſe purifications, not naturally, but outwardly, by the paines and endeuours of the Huſbandman. And as it was amongſt the circumciſed Iewes; their children were borne with the foreskin againe vncircumciſed, becauſe their circumciſion was not inward or naturally in the parent, but added outwardly by humane violence: So it ſtood with Adam; though his ſinne were forgiuen, yet becauſe his righteouſneſſe was altogether in Gods imputation, not in his owne nature, he tranſmitted ſinne and mortality, which he had in himſelfe: and could not tranſmit righteouſneſſe or immortality, becauſe they were altogether outward, in the power of God.
               Another Item the Apoſtle giueth vs, that ſeeing our ſinne commeth from our ſelues, God is not authour thereof. Dauid ſpeaketh truely of the holy One of Iſrael;Pſal. 5.4. 
                  Thou art not a God that louest wickedneſſe, Pſal 5. Were it not ſtrange then for him to be authour of that which he doth not loue?
               S. Iohn reduceth all the ſinnes in the world to three heads,1. Ioh. 2.16. 
                  the concupiſcence of the fleſh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life. Theſe, the ſame Apoſtle ſaith, are not of the father, but of the world.
               
                  Sinne is a thing repugnant to the nature of God, and contrarie to all his properties. It cannot ſtand with his goodneſſe: for being the chiefe and ſoueraigne good, he cannot be authour of euill; ſeeing euerie one affecteth, not that which is oppoſite, but that which is conformable and agreeable to his nature,1. Ioh. 1.5. 
                  And God is light, and in him dwelleth no darkeneſſe at all.
               
               Againe, it were ſome impeachment of his power, to be authour of ſinne: for without any euill God is able to doe what good he will.
               The wiſedome of God will not admit him to be authour of ſinne. Good is the proper obiect that draweth euery one his deſire (as the Philoſopher diſputeth truely) and euill is neuer deſired nor ſought after, but through error, when that which hath but the face and outward appearance of good, is miſtaken for it, which hath the true nature of good indeed. So God cannot be the author of ſinne, vnleſſe you derogate ſome thing from his wiſedome; And O Lord thine eyes be cleere,
                  Hab. 1.13. 
                  thou canst not ſee euill.
               
               If he were authour of ſinne, hee ſhould diuert and turne men away from himſelfe; and that were a plaine deniall of himſelfe, not fit, not poſsible to comply with his truth.
               Neither can it hold correſpondencie with his mercie: for he pittieth and is mercifull to them that ſinne; therefore he cannot be author thereof.
               To be ſhort, it will not ſort with his iuſtice: for hee puniſheth ſinne, becauſe he is iuſt; and then he cannot be authour of it, but he muſt needes be vniuſt. And is there any vnrighteouſnes with God? That is an abſurditie to be deteſted, not confuted. God forbid. God

forbid,
                  Iob. 34.10. ſaith Elihu vnto Iob, that wickedneſſe ſhould be in God, or iniquitie in the Almightie. He ſent his ſonne to take away the ſinnes of the world, and to diſſolue the workes of the Deuill; therefore he createth them not: for if I build againe the things which I haue deſtroied, I make my ſelfe a treſpaſſer.

                  , that is to ſay, a depriuation of that rightneſſe which the law requireth in our actions:Exod. 3.14. and God which calleth himſelfe 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , i. Ens, is cauſa eſſendi, non deficiendi, of being, and not of fayling. Seeing God is Ens, men of indifferent iudgement may ſee that non eſſe ad Deum non pertinet.
               
               
                  Lux non potest gignere tenebras: Sol illuminat ſua natura ſed non inducit tenebras; recedente vero Sole ſponte ſequuntur tenebrae. Ita Deus qui natura ſua bonus est, ſi recedat a nobis, hoc est, iustis de cauſis gratiam ſuam nobis ſubtrahat, vel vt puniat nos, vel vt alijs gratia ſua magis ſit conſpicua, ſponte peccatum ſequitur. Nec neceſſe est vt cauſam peccati alibi inquiramus, quum interiorem habeamus malam voluntatē, ad quam accedit ſuggestio Diaboli. Light cannot breede darkeneſſe, the Sunne lightneth properly, and induceth not darkeneſſe; but when the Sunne goeth away, darkeneſſe followeth of their owne accord. So it is with God, who is good in himſelfe; when hee withdraweth his graces from vs vpon iuſt cauſes, eyther for our puniſhment, or to make his goodneſſe more conſpicuous vnto others: when God hath retyred himſelfe from vs vpon any occaſion, ſinne is at

hand by and by to take place of it ſelfe. Let vs therefore lay the blame of ſinne vpon the Deuill that deuiſed it, and vpon our ſelues that conſented vnto him: let vs not charge God fooliſhly, but magnifie and praiſe him for his infinit goodneſſe and mercies, in aboliſhing the workes of the Deuill, and beſeech him to beate downe that crooked Serpent more and more vnder our feete, euen for his Chriſt his ſake. AMEN.

                        ROM. 5. VERS. 19.
                     
                     As by one mans diſobedience many were made ſinners; ſo by the obedience of one, ſhall many alſo be made righteous.
                  
               
               
                  THE laſt Sabbath I diſcuſſed the former part of this Text vnto your moſt honourable houſhold, and now, by the aſſiſtance of God his holy Spirit, &amp; your Princely patience, doe purpoſe to vnfold the ſecond.
               Three points are here to be cleared; firſt, who this obedient perſon was; ſecondly, the manner of his obedience; thirdly, the validitie. As to the firſt: This age doth not affoord ſuch plentie of obedience, as may make the perſon here ſpoken of, doubtfull or ambiguous. If bare profeſsion were good obedience, Chriſt would neuer haue told the Iewes,Matth. 21.31. that Publicans and Harlots ſhould goe into the Kingdome of God before them: Saul, neuer intending obedience, pretends it all in vaine.1. Sam. 13.13. Some Philoſophers left all they had that when they were rid of worldly cares, they might haue

the more libertie to follow vanitie: Et nolebant cenſu abundare terreno, vt abundarent magis ſenſu ſuo. S. Bern.
               
               If ſome certain religious people, haue deuoted themſelues to obedience, their vowes make the title fayrer, but not the obligation ſtronger. S. Bernard decyphered ſuch vanities long agoe, Sine defectu pauperes, ſine deſpectu humiles, ſine labore diuites eſſe volunt: Holy and obedient people indeed, that will be poore without want, humble without contempt, rich without labour, and obedient without any reknowledgement of allegiance. They will not be like vnto other men; therefore ſauing our Aphoriſme againſt retaliation and Chriſtian charitie, that nothing be done in reuenge, if other men wil be as peremptorie againe, not to be like vnto them, there ſhall be no great cauſe left (as I ſuppoſe) for Church or Common-wealth to complaine.
               
                  Difference in the obedient.The importunitie of their challenges, makes mee to put difference in thoſe that be obedient: the perſon that our Text ſpeaketh of, is obedient vnto God; theſe pretenders, are obſequious vnto men, to S. Frauncis, Benedict, Dominick, Ignatius Loyola, and their ſuperiours. But why ſhould Chriſtians, that are borne of God, take names from men? Non ad hominis nomen ambulo, Chriſti nomen teneo. Perirem ſi eſſem de parte Pauli; quomodo non perirem, ſi eſſem de parte Donati. His obedience ſtood in performing his fathers will; theirs is exerciſed in vpholding mans inuentions, or if they labor in obeying God, it is but in part, and he was obedient perfectly: his perſon was infinite, theirs is finite; his innocent, theirs ſinfull: his obedience is applicable, and beneficiall vnto others: if theirs be memorable for imitation, it is well; it can neuer be applicable for expiation.
               
                  The obedience that maketh others righteous,Complete obedience. muſt be complete, abſolute, continuall; ſo was neuer any humane obedience: it is interrupted often, it hath manie intermiſsions, therefore I maruaile what ſecurity they can finde, that follow after it. I ſhould be the more affraid for ſuch a helpe: without it, I haue nothing to feare but my cauſe alone; if I ſhould repoſe my ſelfe vpon this broken ſtaffe, I muſt feare it, and my cauſe too. Refugium nostrum non est tale: The obedience of Ieſus Chriſt, is perfect obedience, full of ſecuritie, voyde of feare. He is the perſon then, by whoſe obedience many are made righteous.
               His obedience was admirable, and it ſutes well with his perſon, which is wonderfull, ſingular, and not to be matched: Dauids ſonne, and Dauids Lord; the ſonne of Mary, and the father of eternitie; the ſonne of man, and the ſonne of God, Who being in the forme of God,
                  Phil. 2. v. 6, 7, 8. 
                  thought it no robberie to be equall with God: but he made himſelfe of no reputation, and tooke vpon him the forme of a ſeruant, and was made like vnto men, and was found in ſhape as a man. He humbled himſelfe, and became obedient vnto the death, euen the death of the Croſſe. Two entyre &amp; perfect natures, combined &amp; glewed together in one perſon, Emmanuel, God and man.
               This makes another doubt, whether his obedience was performed in the humanitie, or in the diuinitie, or in both together: I anſwer, that he was obedient in the humane nature alone, not in the diuine. If the diuine nature could haue yeelded obedience, had not his incarnation beene ſuperfluous? If the diuinitie had bene obedient, it muſt haue died too; for he was obedient vnto death: and is it poſſible to haue a mortall diuinitie?

There was no congruitie, that one nature ſhould vndertake the obedience impoſed on the other: behold a confuſion, for the Godhead to entertaine and handle the buſineſſe of the manhood.
               
                  Ioh. 2.19.Therefore his obedience was performed in the humanitie; Destroy this Temple, and I will raiſe it vp in three dayes:
                  1. Pet. 2.24. This hee ſpake of his bodie. So S. Peter ſaith,That he bare our ſinnes in his body; and our Text teacheth vs, That it was the obedience of one man. It was not then diminutio diuinitatis, no abatement of his godhead, but depoſitio corporis, an humiliation of his bodie alone. And that had not auayled without an vnion, and concurrence of both natures in one perſon.
               
                  Tolerare paſsiones nunquid poſſet niſi homo? Mori &amp; crucifigi &amp; humiliari poſſet niſi homo? S. Aug. in Pſal. 90. If he had bene God onely, he could not haue bene obedient if man onely, he had not beene ſufficient. But when the ſame perſon that was creator of all things, became obedient, and obedient vnto death: what is it that his obedience could not worke? the death of all the creatures of the world, is not equiualent: it is preponderant, and preferred in the ballance of Gods iuſtice.Leo epiſt. 41. 
                  Tam potens fuit ad priuilegium, tam diues ad pretium, vt ſi vniuerſitas captiuorum in redemptorem ſuum crederet, nullum tyrānica vincula retinerent. The obedience that the ſonne of God performed in his humanity, was ſo potent for priuiledge, ſo rich for price, that if the whole multitude of captiues had beliefe in him, none could remaine in the tyrants bands. But of the validitie more hereafter: now we are confined to the affaires of his perſon.
               If man had not ouercome the enemie, hee had not

beene ouercome iuſtly. Againe, if God had not giuen ſaluation, we could not hold it firmely,Pſal. 60.11. 
                  vana ſalus hominis. And if this man had not bene God, he ſhould not haue beene partaker of incorruptibilitie, and then hee could not tranſmit it to vs: hunc hominem Deus, non vt alios regebat, ſed gerebat. This man, as Saint Augustine ſaith excellently, had a prerogatiue aboue all others: God did not gouerne him barely, as he doth euery one elſe, but he bare him too.
               His manhood was inſeperably conioyned and ſupported in the vnitie of the godhead; ſo as death it ſelfe, that ſeuereth man and wife aſunder, that deuideth bodie and ſoule, and parteth all things elſe, could yet make no ſeperation here: but then, euen in the death of his bodie, the diuinitie did adhaere, and was coupled with it in the graue; otherwiſe it had followed the condition of all fleſh elſe, ſeene corruption, and abid in death.
               Seeing then that there is ſo firme an vnion of the Godhead and manhood in one perſon, the obedience which the manhood performed, may rightly be valued at an infinite rate, as if it had beene done by the Deitie it ſelfe.
               If Dauid thought he did Saul wrong,1. Sam. 24.5. and was touched at the heart, when he had cut off the lap of Sauls garment; and yet the garment was not himſelfe, but neere vnto him: then may the Godhead much more iuſtly reckon euerie thing done vnto himſelfe, that was done vnto this fleſh, which cannot be ſeuered from himſelfe.
               Concerning the manner of his obedience,Spontanea obedientia. manie things are of profitable conſideration, which I ſuppoſe you haue heard lately: but none more memorable, then the alacritie and cheerefulneſſe of his obedience;

which I purpoſe to inſiſt on.Luc. 22.15. 
                  Deſiderio deſideraui, I haue earneſtly deſired to eate this Paſſeouer with you: Hee was ſure that he himſelfe ſhould then alſo be made a Paſſeouer, and be offered vp as the Lambe of God, that taketh away the ſinnes of the world: hee knew then that he ſhould ſuffer a moſt painefull and ignominious death; which any man elſe would haue deſired as earneſtly to auoide, as he did vehemently long to vndertake. Not that death was any way pleaſing to him in it ſelfe, but to declare his affectionate readineſſe in obedience to his father, and his great thirſt of our ſaluation. You may reade of the like profeſsion that he maketh in the Pſalmes: Sacrifice and meate offering thou wouldest not haue, but haſt fitted me vp a body.
                  Pſa. 40. v. 6, 7, 8. 
                  Then ſaid I, lo, I come. In the beginning of the booke it is written of me, that I ſhould fulfill thy will: O my God I am content to doe it. In which words, I may commend three things to your obſeruation:
               
                  1. That God neuer appointed the ſacrifices of the Olde Teſtament for ranſomes of ſinne, but for figures of the true Sacrifice.
                  2. That the obedience of his Sonne, is a full propitiation to appeaſe his wrath.
                  3. That the Sonne offereth that ſweete ſmelling ſacrifice of his obedience, with all cheerefulneſſe. In this point, the Metaphor wherewith the Sonne of God doth expreſſe the voluntarie addiction of his obedience, is emphaticall, and worthy of reuiew.
               
               
                  Aures perforasti mihi: He alludeth to the ciuill ordinance,Exod. 21.5, 6. 
                  Exod. 21. If a ſeruant care not for his freedome, and ſay, I loue my Maister, and will not goe out of his houſe: Then his Maiſter ſhall bring him to the Iudges, and ſet him

to the dore, or to the post, and his Master ſhall bore his eare through with an awle, and he ſhall ſerue him foreuer. I ſay too little, when I ſay Chriſt obliged himſelfe to ſuch obedience. He profeſſeth more in the Pſalme,Pſal. 40.6. 
                  aures perforasti mihi, that both his eares were bored through, &amp; the obligation of his obedience doubled aboue all others. How? Sure hee addicted himſelfe not to outward obſequies alone, as voluntarie ſeruants vſed to do; but to obey the very inward thoughts, &amp; intendments of his fathers will, he left no tittle vnperformed. Where ſhall we finde the like?Gen. 22.9. 
                  Iſaac his obedience is commendable: hee was not refractorie when his father would offer him vp in ſacrifice, but yet he was bound: And, O Lord, thine hands needed no bands, nor thy feete to be tyed in fetters of braſſe.
               
                  Ioſeph would not contend with his brethren, when they had agreed to put him to death: but did hee not vſe deprecations? They acknowledge it, Gen. 42.21.
                  Gen. 42.21. 
                  We haue verily ſinned against our brother, in that we ſawe the anguiſh of his ſoule, when he beſought vs, and we would not heare him.
               
               Mee thinks I ſee how pittifully he ſtood in the midſt of them, when they began to ſtrip him out of his coat; how his colour went away with the apprehenſion and feare of death; how his cheekes were all to be raied with teares; how his eyes were turned euery way: ſometimes to one brother, ſomtimes to another, ſometimes to all at once; ſometimes to the ground where his bodie ſhould fall, ſometimes to the heauens, that ſhould receiue his ſoule. Did not theſe wofull lookes pleade for him? were they not vocall? Yes indeed, and patheticall Orators. And after that with beating his

breaſt, hee had gained paſſage for his voyce, hee added words to this effect: Alas! what haue I done worthie of this that you goe about? If I tolde any thing of you, it was but truth, and tended to your reformation: if my dreames be offenſiue, they came by the inſtinct of God: if you miſlike my cōming, it was my fathers pleaſure; I came to ſee how you did, and ſhall I now die? O ſpare my life for the reſpect you haue to your owne bloud: ſpare it (I beſeech you) for the reuerence you beare to my fathers age; is hee not alſo yours? Spare it, if you regard not men, yet for the feare you haue of God: or if none of all theſe can moue your bowels, for my life; let me haue my coate, this partie-coloured coate, the ornament of my youth, and the pledge of my fathers loue, for an hearſe to ſhroude and couer me when I am dead.
               Maruaile not at Ioſephs obteſtations; he was but a figure of obedience, and the figure muſt euer be inferior to the truth. Chriſt himſelfe vſed no tergiuerſation, no deprecation:Mat. 27.12.14. he is accuſed, and holds his peace; he is charged,Iſa. 53.7. and ſaith nothing to it. But as a ſheepe led to the ſlaughter, ſo opened he not his mouth. He died willingly.
               Saint Peter, and the reſt that dyed for the teſtimonie of this obedience, did it patiently, but not altogether willingly: I haue warrant and authoritie enough for it,Ioh. 21.18. 
                  When thou art old, another ſhall gird thee, and leade thee whither thou wouldst not. If there were any other means for vs to come to Chriſt, who would die?
               
                  Indeed (ſaith another great Apoſtle) wee that are in this tabernacle,
                  2. Cor. 5.4. 
                  ſigh and are burthened, becauſe we would not be vnclothed, but be clothed vpon.
               
               
                  Saint Paul would be like Henoch, Elias,
                  1. Cor. 15.51. or thoſe that be aliue at the day of iudgement: they ſhall not die, but they ſhall be chaunged. So S. Paul deſireth, not to be vnclothed, but to be clothed vpon, that mortality might be ſwallowed vp of life.
               
               Although we go from labour to reſt; from expectation to poſſeſsion; from the race to the gaole; from faith to fruition; from a pilgrimage to our countrey; from the world to God: yet the paſſage being rugged, mingled with aſperitie, hauing ſome of the gall and vineger in it, that the Iewes gaue vnto Chriſt,Matt. 27.34. maketh it vnpleaſing vnto vs: But theſe lets and rubbs, could neyther hinder nor abate any thing of his cheerefulneſſe.
               
                  Oblatus est quia voluit: if he had beene vnwilling, he was not vnable to hold his life againſt all the world. When the Iewes ſent their Sergeants to apprehend him, he meetes his aduerſaries in the mid-way; he offereth himſelfe, and askes them whom they ſeeke. When they ſaid, Ieſus of Nazareth, he denied not,Ioh. 18.5. but acknowledged himſelfe, and ſaid, I am hee.
               
               No perſwaſions could diuert him from this obedience: his diſciples ſay, Maſter, the Iewes did ſeeke for thee of late to ſtone thee, and wilt thou go to Hieruſalem againe?
                  Ioh. 11.8, 9, 10. He anſwereth roundly, Are there not twelue houres in the day? If any man walke in the day time, he ſtumbleth not, becauſe he ſeeth the light of this world. God his calling is like this day light, which ſuffereth not a man to wander, or to goe aſtray out of his way: in obedience of this calling, he goeth on to Hieruſalem couragiouſly, and feares no ſwords, nor ſtaues, but offereth himſelfe the ſecond time, and askes them, whom they ſeeke?
                  Ioh. 18.7. Here

is no vnwillingneſſe or puſillanimitie; that was rat her with his aduerſaries:Verſ. 6. they did ſhrinke, goe backe, and fell to the ground.
               Where is the terror and defence of their armed men? forſooth with one word, and acknowledgment of himſelfe, and with his bare voyce, ſaying nothing, but, I am hee; the whole multitude that came againſt him, fierce in hatred, and terrible in power, were ſmitten, repelled, and ouerthrowne without any weapon at all: Was there euer ſuch a Hee?
               
               You may eaſily accompt what this Hee will doe, when he iudgeth, that did ſo much when he was iudged: what he may doe when he raigneth, that could doe this when he obeyed. When he ſaw the wrath of God ſtirred vp againſt all creatures for our ſinne, I cannot tell you whether it was with more pietie or wiſedome; with greater mercie or iuſtice (for I thinke all the vertues in the world, did concurre together in this one action) but I am ſure that it was with great willingnes,Ion. 1.12. and powerfull ſucceſſe that he cryed, Si propter me haet tempestas orta ſit, tollite me, &amp; mittite me in mare.
               
               And what tempeſt could be raiſed for his ſake? that I will alſo ſhew. It was not without a robberie of the Sonne of God, that Lucifer did affect his greatneſſe: it was not without a robberie of the Sonne of God, that our firſt parents did affect that knowledge, eritis ſicut dij:
                  Gen. 3.5. And the Father would not diſſemble, nor paſſe ouer his ſonnes iniuries without reuenge;Ioh. 3.35. 
                  For the Father loueth the Sonne alwayes. For him hee deſtroyed many Angels, and ſentenced all men: What did the Sonne when he ſaw the Father ſo iealous for him, that he ſpared no creature? To the intent that it may be knowne

(ſaith he) that I alſo loue the Father, behold, by me he ſhall receiue againe many of thoſe, that forme he had in a manner loſt.
               
                  Therefore ſeeing this tempest is riſen for my ſake,
                  Ion. 1.12. 
                  take me and cast me into the ſea, and you ſhall haue a great calme. Indeed he did ſee the aſſault of the rauening Wolfe, and tarrieth not vntill hee had ſurpriſed the ſheepe, but maturely interpoſeth himſelfe in the gap.Ioh. 10.11. 
                  O good ſheapheard, that giueth his life for his ſheepe.
               
               
                  Peccat iniquus, &amp; punitur iuſtus, delinquit reus,
                  Aug. med. ca. 7. 
                  &amp; vapulat innocent, offendit impius, &amp; damnatur pius: Quod meretur malus, patitur bonus: Quod perpetrat ſervus, exoluit dominus, quod committit homo, ſuſtinet Deus.
               
               It was not nothing that God gaue, when hee ſent his Sonne vnto vs, but gaue vs all things with him, who of God is made vnto vs, wiſedome, righteouſneſſe,
                  1. Cor. 1.30. 
                  ſanctification, and redemption. And the other three graces may ſerue for other ſubiects; the gift of righteouſneſſe belongeth properly to the obedience of Chriſt, as our Text witneſſeth.
               
                  By the obedience of one, many are made righteous. His obedience is not like the oyle which the wiſe Virgins had, that would not ſerue themſelues and others.Matth. 25.9. Whoſoeuer drinketh thereof ſhall thirſt againe,Ioh. 4.13. Hab. 2.4. Ioh. 4.14. 
                  For the iuſt ſhall liue by his owne faith. But he that drinketh of the water that I giue vnto him, ſhall neuer thirſt.
               
               The ſoule that receiueth Chriſt, is content with him onely; for his obedience is like the widdowes oyle,2. King. 4.6. that did runne as long as there was any veſſell to receiue it; Tam pleno fonti vas inane admouendum. It is no ſhort or narrow mantell; for that, according to the Prophet,Pſal. 119.142. cannot couer two; His righteouſneſſe is an euerlasting

righteouſneſſe; and what is larger then eternitie? Nothing. Then it will couer him and vs. Et in nobis quidem operit multitudinem peccatorum: In te autē domine, quid niſi pietatis theſauros, diuitias bonitatis?
               
               Chriſt being man, was mortall alſo, and capable of death; but being iuſt, he needes not doe it freely. One ſinner cannot die for another; but he that had no cauſe to doe it for himſelfe, doth it not for another in vaine: No, no, the more vnworthily that he dyed, that deſerued no death, the more iuſtly we liue, for whom hee dyed.
               
                  Magna res anima, quae Chriſti ſanguine redempta eſt, grauis animae caſus, qui non niſi Chriſti cruce potuit reparari: Si rurſum corruerit peccato duntaxat ad mortē, vnde iam reparabit? nunquid aut alter Chriſtus, aut idem iterum habet crucifigi pro ea? Hee held his peace before Pilate,
                  Matth. 27.14. becauſe that Court held plea for his death only, which the Sonne of God would not decline. Pilate had no competent tribunal, to enquire of the validitie of his death, or what retaliation and amends ſhould be giuen for it: that was to be determined in the high court of his fathers iuſtice. And doe you thinke that he is ſilent there too?Rom. 8.34. &amp; Heb. 7.25. Hebr. 12.24. No beloued, There he maketh interceſsion continually; &amp; ſpeaketh better things then the bloud of Abel. That cryed for vengeance, this for indulgence; that for iuſtice, this for mercy; that for puniſhment, this for remiſsion of ſinnes.
               So Lord Ieſus, ſo continue thy pietie ſtill, and we ſhal neuer be forced to pay that againe, which thou haſt payed for vs alreadie. If his obedience be ſufficient, there needes no more; if it be not, where is the defect? Is there any invaliditie in the Fathers acceptation?

None at all. You remember what the good father ſaies in Gen. 27. when hee touched Iacob and ſented Chriſt, Behold, the ſmell of my ſonne is like the ſmell of a field,
                  Gen. 27.27. 
                  which the Lord hath bleſſed. The father may accept that of fauour, that is no competent ſatisfaction. Nay, nay, ſo the father might haue accepted any part of his obedience; and then there had beene no full, no reall, but a formal ſatisfaction for ſinne, and as they ſay, dicis cauſa. The forgiueneſſe of our ſinne is not for faſhion ſake:Epheſ. 1.7. S. Paul calls it not 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , but 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , that is to ſay, an abſolute remiſsion, as in the yeare of Iubile. And wee haue it by this obedience that was complete and perfect, euen vnto death, which is the period and laſt line of all things.
               Whileſt Ioſeph liued, there is no expreſſe mention that the Iſraelites increaſed, but after his death, as appeareth Exod. 1. So it ſtood with our Ioſeph;
                  Exod. 1.6.7. before he dyed there was but few Iſraelites: The dew fell vpon Gideons fleece onely, and all the floore was drye;Iudg. 6.39, 40. but after his death, the dew fell vpon all the floore: the fleece alone is now drie, and the Iſraelites of God are encreaſed and multiplyed ouer all the world, by the heauenly dew and influence of this obedience.1. Cor. 15.36. Indeed except the graine of Wheate fall into the ground, and dye, it abideth alone; but if it dye, it bringeth forth much fruite▪ you may iudge of his cauſe by the words of his mouth: for after this pretious graine dyed in obedience, Out of the eater came meate, and out of the ſtrong came ſweetneſſe:
                  Iudg. 14.14. out of the obedience of his death, the harueſt of the Church, ſhooteth vp plentifully in euerie quarter. O virtus occulta! vnam animam emiſſam in tormento innumerabiles extrahere de inferno: hominem mortem corporis

ſuſcipere, &amp; animarum mortem perimere.
               
               
                  2. Cor. 5.14.The Apoſtle giueth a reaſon of it, If one dyed for all, then all dyed in that one: and it is certus ſermo, a ſure ſaying,Rom. 6.8. Rom. 8.17. 
                  that if we be dead with him, we ſhal alſo liue with him: if we ſuffer, we ſhall alſo raigne with him.
               
               Aduerſaries may quarrell this imputation, but they will neuer bee able to diſproue it: for by the ſame meanes that Chriſt was made ſinne for vs, are we made the righteouſneſſe of God in him. Now it is out of doubt, that he was made ſinne for vs, not by inherence, but by imputation of our ſinnes: therefore are wee alſo made righteous, not by any inherent righteouſneſſe, but by imputation of his obedience. This is the righteouſneſſe that was prefigured in the old Teſtament.
               What ſignified the ſweete treitment that was giuen to Iacob and his children in Egypt?Gen. 47. Why did the gracious King, that knew them not before they were brought vnto him, make them Denizens of ſtrangers; and Citizens of aliens? Why did he receiue them, not onely into his common-wealth, but alſo into his neere familiaritie, and loue? Was it for any reſpect of themſelues? Alas, they brought nothing with them, but pouertie and famine: Was it not altogether for Ioſephs ſake, whom hee loued? If Pharaoh were intreated for thoſe that he neuer knew, the Father of mercies will not be inexorable for the people that he hath made: If Ioſeph could preuaile with a King, for his parentage and friends, the onely begotten Sonne ſhall neuer be refuſed for the children that God hath giuen him.
               Two things in Ioſeph were eminent and perſpicuous; He deſerued well, and ſuffered ill: but if compariſon be made, you ſhall finde Ioſeph and all things hee

had, inferiour to Ieſus Chriſt.Gen. 39.17, 18. 
                  Ioſeph was innocent in one particular imputation obiected; Chriſt was innocent in all things elſe.Verſ. 21. 
                  Ioſeph found fauour with him that kept the priſon, &amp; ſo his puniſhment was the eaſier; Chriſt could turne no way to receiue commiſeration. The ſonne of Iacobs wrongs went no further then to bands and priſon; the ſonne of God had the whip, and buffets, and a crowne of thornes, and ſpittings, and contumelies, and all the gall of the Croſſe it ſelfe: vae tibi amaritudo peccatorū noſtrorum propter quae ſoluenda tanta amaritudo neceſſaria eſt. S. Bernard. Opus ſine exemplo, gratia ſine merito, charitas ſine modo: If the father, to redeeme ſeruants, ſpared not his only ſonne: if the ſonne, for ſatisfaction of his father, offered his life in obedience: if both ſend the Holy Ghoſt to apply the mercies of the father, and obedience of the ſonne; and the ſpirit maketh interceſsion for vs,
                  Rom. 8.26. 
                  with groanes that cannot be expreſſed, raiſing vs vp to God with confident pietie, and bowing God vnto vs, in the clemencie of his mercie: if euery perſon of the Trinitie, confer ſome thing to our iuſtification, who ſhall diſanull it, or lay any thing to our charge? Shal Sathan? Indeed he is an implacable aduerſarie, and cannot endure that poore man, made of the duſt of the earth, ſhould obtaine that place which he could not hold that was created in heauen. But in this cauſe we haue his owne ſtipulation againſt himſelfe.
               When he came to the Sonne of God with ſwordes &amp; ſtaues, did not the innocent Lamb aske them whom they ſought? did not they anſwer, Ieſus of Nazareth? Did not he condition with them, that if they ſought him, they ſhould let his diſciples goe?Ioh. 18.5. did not they admit

of this condition, and let them all eſcape? S. Matt. is cleare in this point,Matth. 26.56. 
                  The Diſciples all left him, and fled away. That (gratious Lord) was thy good meaning; euen that was thy ſweet condition: and the aduerſaries conſent appeareth manifeſtly by the ſeale of their fact. For that which was done by his Attornies, is reputed to be done by himſelfe:Verſ. 57. ſo when Chriſt was left alone, he onely was taken, bound, led away, put to death, that the chastiſement of our peace might be vpon him onely;
                  Iſa. 53.5. for of all people there was none with him. Where be they then that will needes bee ioynt-purchaſers with Ieſus Chriſt? where be they that implore ayde of S. Peter, or S. Iames, or S. Iohn, or any Saint in theſe affaires?
               When this matter was in hand, no creature did aſſiſt the Sonne of God; all did forſake him, euery man. Iudge then what iniuſtice it is to transfer any honour of the battaile, to them that ſate at the baggage, &amp; were neuer in the field.
               
                  1. Sam. 30.24.Wee reade that Dauid did diuide the ſpoyle indifferently, and ſaid, As his part is that goeth downe to the battaile, ſo ſhall his part be that tarrieth by the ſtuffe: they ſhall part alike. That Dauid made a law, and a ſtatute in Iſrael vnto this day: But it is againſt law and reaſon, that he which putteth on his harneis,
                  1. King. 20.11. 
                  ſhould boast himſelfe, as he that putteth it off.
               
               Are we not liberally dealt withall, to haue the fruite of the victorie, and to be exempted from the hazard of fight? Liberally brethren; liberally O bountifull Ieſu. Therfore we accept of thy condition with thankes; becauſe they ſought thee, we goe away contented abundantly with the prey, and ſhall euer aſcribe the glorie of the victory, &amp; all our righteouſneſs to thine obedience
               
                  If Laban purſue vs, and accuſe vs, that we went priuily from him: our anſwer is ready, That we came priuily to him; and therefore went priuily from him againe. A ſecret cauſe of ſinne brought vs to his ſubiection, and a more ſecret courſe of iuſtice hath withdrawne vs from him: if we were ſold to him for grammercie, yet were wee not redeemed for naught: if he ſay, Our father hath enthralled vs; may we not anſwer, Our brother hath redeemed vs? Why ſhould not righteouſneſſe come from another, when guiltineſſe commeth from another?
               It was one that made vs ſinners; it is one that makes vs righteous: prior in ſemine, alter in ſanguine: it was man that forfeited, it is man that ſatisfied; the head for the members, Chriſt for his owne bowels. But the righteouſneſſe of the righteous, ſhall be vpon himſelfe: what is that to thee? Be it. Then muſt the ſinne of the ſinner be vpon himſelfe too: and what is that to mee? Shall the righteouſneſſe of the righteous be vpon himſelfe? and ſhal not the ſinne of the ſinner be vpon himſelfe too? There is no congruity that the ſonne ſhould beare the iniquitie of the father, and be debarred from the righteouſneſſe of his brother. Let there be indifferencie both wayes: and then by man comes ſinne; by man comes righteouſneſſe: in Adam all are made ſinners; in Chriſt many are made righteous. And I doe not belong ſo to the former, but that I haue a dependancie alſo on the latter: if I pertaine to the one by the fleſh, I reach alſo to the other by faith. Why ſhould I haue anie ſurpluſage from the ſinner? if it be for my generation; behold my regeneration to oppoſe againſt it, and there is no oddes, ſaue that the former is carnall, the latter

ſpirituall: that more conſpicuous to the fleſh, this more certaine becauſe of faith.
               Amongſt other properties of Faith this is not the leaſt,Matth. 13. that it neuer varieth, as the parable of the ſeede teacheth vs. If true faith could faile, the elect might periſh,Ioh. 10.28. which is impoſsible; for Chriſt ſaith, That none can take them out of his hand. If faith ſhould fayle, the elect might be often regenerated, who are borne of incorruptible ſeede; and as the ſeede is, ſo muſt the regeneration be: therefore once a new creature, and euer a member of Chriſt.1. Ioh. 3.9. &amp; 5.18. Faith cannot faile, becauſe He that is borne of God ſinneth not, neyther can he, becauſe the ſeede of God abideth in him, Ioh. 5.18.
               
               How ſhould faith be variable, that hath Gods promiſe,Ier. 32.40. 
                  I will put my feare into their hearts, that they ſhall not go from me: that hath the efficacy of Chriſts praier, Keepe them in thy trueth,
                  Ioh. 17.11. 
                  Ioh. l7. and, I haue prayed for thee,
                  Luc. 22.32. 
                  that thy faith faile not? Luc. 23.
               
               
                  Montes mouebuntur, &amp; colles nutabunt, miſericordia autem mea a te non recedet, et faedus pacis meae non nutabit dicit miſerator tuus Iehouah.
               
               
                  Ioh. 15.16.
                  You haue not choſen me, but I haue choſen you, and ordained you that you goe and bring forth fruite, and that your fruite remaine.
               
               
                  Christo ſic eos ponente vt eant, &amp; fructum offerant, &amp; fructus eorum maneat: quis audeat dicere, forſitan non manebit?
                  Rom. 11.29. 
                  The giftes and graces of God are without repentance.
               
               Of Dauids faith, and Peters, and others that fell into enormious ſinnes, I ſay with Tertullian, Caepit areſcere, ſed non exaruit: mota fuit, ſed non amota: concuſſa, ſed non excuſſa.
               
               
                  
                  Adam peraduenture may be thought to haue loſt faith and grace wholly, till he was reſtored againe: but if it were ſo, his loſſe inferreth not ours; becauſe wee haue gained a better eſtate by Chriſt, then we loſt in Adam: for his Garden and Paradiſe, we haue heauen; for his mutable felicitie, we haue an vnchangeable inheritance; for his image of God, we haue the ſame image againe in more glorious faſhion; not ſeuered from God, as it was in him formerly, but now inſeperably coupled to the Sonne of God: O neceſſarium Adae peccatum: ô felix Adae culpa, quae talem ac tantum meruerit habere redemptorem.
               
               Here is all the aduantage that Adam hath (if there be any aduantage in that which is euill) his diſobedience is generall and vniuerſall, not in power alone, but in acte too: it maketh all ſinners. The obedience of Chriſt hath a potentiall vniuerſalitie, and is ſufficient to make all righteous; but actually, it iuſtifieth the faithfull onely.
               
                  By the obedience of one many are made righteous. The reaſon of this difference is manifeſt: Adams diſobedience is deriued by propagation, &amp; ſo reacheth vnto all: Chriſt his obedience is beneficiall to ſo many as haue their hearts open to receiue it by faith; becauſe it comes of grace. And that is not common vnto all: for then it ſhould be turned into nature. Communis est omnibus natura, non gratia: natura non putetur gratia ſed ſi putetur gratia, ideo putetur gratia, quia &amp; ipſa gratis conceſſa est. Saint Augustine alloweth no vniuerſalitie of grace. The winde bloweth, not euerie where,Ioh. 3.8. but, where it listeth. Neyther can all heare, but thoſe that haue an eare to heare: Neyther haue

all faith,2. Theſ. 3.2. Rom. 9.16. but thoſe that are predeſtinated vnto life: neyther is it in him that willeth, or in him that runneth, but in God that hath mercie. Quare hunc trahit &amp; non illum: noli iudicare, ſi non vis errare.
               
               This continuance and ſoliditie of faith, ſortes well with S. Peter, with S. Paul, and ſuch as were guides: we are farre inferiour to thoſe ſhining lights, and may not expect the like grace of righteouſneſſe. Thus ſome Rabbins of the Societie, would beare the world in hand; that where ſanctification is not alike, there iuſtification cannot be equall: and ſo robbe poore ſinners of comfort that need it moſt. Doe they not withall ſteale one moletie of our iuſtification from God, and transfer it to workes? It was a harlot, and not the true mother, that cryed,1. King. 3.26. 
                  Nec mihi, nec tibi, ſed diuidatur. Tutiores viuimus, ſi totum deo damus. If Chriſt were a changeling; if he were one to S. Peter, and another to S. Paul: fauourable to the Centurion,Matt. 8.13. 
                  Matth. 8. and difficult to the Ruler, Ioh. 4.
                  Ioh. 4.50. Matth. 15.28. Flexible to the woman of Canaan for her faith that was heroicall; and immoucable to the faint faith of the father, that cryed, Lord I beleeue, helpe mine vnbeleefe,
                  Mar. 9.24. 
                  Marc. 9. there were ſome colour for this inequality of iuſtification; becauſe he is made of God righteouſneſſe vnto vs.
               
                  Hebr. 13.8.But ſeeing Ieſus Christ is yesterday, to day, and the ſame for euer, Heb. 13. ſeeing he is God, and doth not alter, Mal. 3 the ſame,
                  Mal. 3.6. Pſal. 102.27. 
                  and his yeares doe not faile, Pſal. 102. ſeeing he is euerlasting righteouſneſſe, Dan. 9. And that which is eternall, muſt needs be free from all variation: Let no man imagine his iuſtification to be greater or leſſe, according to the ſtrength or imbecilitie of his faith. The poore loſt ſheepe,Luc. 15.5. that was brought home vpon the

ſhepherds back, had no great ſtrength of faith to walk. And they that did looke vnto the braſen Serpent,Num. 21.8. were not all alike ſighted, yet they all had one and the ſame benefite of health.
               The difference of degrees and meaſure, neither increaſeth nor abateth the nature or being of anie thing. A ſmall droppe is as well and truely water, as the maine Sea: a little ſparke, is as truely fire, as the mightieſt flame: the hand of a little childe may receiue a pearle, as well as the pawe of great Goliah; and a weake faith, euen a graine of Muſtard ſeede, may be a true iuſtifying faith, as well as the full perſwaſion and height of aſſurance.
               It is not the qualitie of faith that makes vs righteous, that is but the worke of one commandement, that is inherent in vs; that would giue vs matter of boaſting: But the obiect of faith, namely, Chriſt imputed vnto vs, is that which makes vs righteous.
               A counter that is not worth three pence of it ſelfe, when it ſtands in the right line, is reckoned for tenne thouſand pounds: ſo is the valuation of our righteouſneſſe taken, not for the perfection of faith; that is but a three pennie counter, in reſpect of righteouſneſſe, but from the line of Chriſts obedience.
               The Publicans righteouſneſſe ſtood not in the perfection of vertues; fot he cryed,Luc. 18.13. 
                  Lord be mercifull vnto me a ſinner, and he went home iuſtified. How? S. August. Nihil boni fecisti &amp; datur tibi remiſsio peccatorū: It ſtood in remiſsion of ſinne: And is not forgiueneſſe of ſinne graunted to all alike? If there be any difference, they ſhould haue greateſt iuſtification, that haue moſt forgiuen. What is it then that can make inequalitie in our

iuſtification? Is it the leſſe for the multitude of ſinnes? No, S. Paul giues vs ſweeter diuinitie, Where ſinne doth abound,
                  Rom. 5.20. 
                  there grace exceeds it in aboundance. Or is it leſſe for the infirmitie of our faith? Neither: there S. Peter relieueth vs, when he ſayes, We haue obtained 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ,
                  2. Pet. 1.1. 
                  2. Pet. 1. like pretious faith with the Apoſtles. Do you think that the ſtrangers which dwelt here &amp; there thoroughout Pontus, Galatia. Cappadocia, Aſia, &amp; Bythinia; had puritie of faith, eyther amongſt themſelues, or with S. Peter? No ſure, there will euer be a diuerſitie in graces. Why then doth hee call their faith like pretious? Forſooth becauſe that by faith we doe all poſſeſſe the ſame Ieſus Chriſt, with his righteouſneſſe and obedience. So he ſaies we haue obtained like pretious faith, by the righteouſneſſe of our God and Sauiour Ieſus Christ. If Ieſus Chriſt his righteouſneſſe, his obedience make our faith like pretious; then God puts no difference, as touching adoption and iuſtification, betweene them and vs: And therefore, for concluſion, we beleeue thorough the grace of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, to be ſaued euen as they doe.
               It is plaine by the Text, that all righteouſneſſe is incloſed in the obedience of Chriſt: His doctrine is the fountaine of wiſedome; his iuſtice the worke of righteouſneſſe; his life the mirrour of temperance; his death the ſtandard of fortitude. And in vaine doe yee labour in the purſuit of any vertue,Ioh. 15.5. if you ſeeke it anie where but from the Lord of vertue. Sine me nihil potestis facere. Without him, all the vertues of the heathen, were like golden Nutts that wanted kernells. Currebant (ſaith S. Augustine) tanquam athletae validiſsimi, ſed praeter metas &amp; carceres: They did runne like valorous

               Thoſe gifts were not vulgar and common, but beſtowed vpon certaine of the Heathen, as the ſpeciall graces and fauours of God, not ſanctifying, but adorning and perfuſing them: as he did with Beſaleel and
