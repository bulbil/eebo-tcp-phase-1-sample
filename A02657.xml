            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

your goodnes with the abhominable, wicked and detestable behauior
of all these rowsey, ragged rabblement of rakehelles, that vnder the
pretence of great misery, diseases and other innumerable calamities,
which they fayne through great hipocrisie, doe win and gayne great
almes in all places where they wyly wander, to the vtter deludinge of
the good geuers: deceyiing and impouerishing of al such poore housholders
both sicke and fore, as neyther can or may walke abroade for
reliefe and comfort (where in deede most mercy is to be shewed,) And
for that, I (most honorable Lady) being placed as a poore gentleman,
haue kept a house these twenty yeares, where vnto pouerty dyily hath
and doth repayre, not without some reliefe as my poore callinge and
habilitie may and doth extende: I haue of late yeares gathered a great
suspicion that all should not be well: and as the prouerbe sayeth:
Some thing lurcke and laye hyd that dyd not playnely appeare. For I hauing
more occasion (through sicknesse) to tary and remayne at home.
then I haue bene accustomed, doe by my there abyding, talke and conferre
daily with many of these wyly wanderars, of both sortes, as well
men and women, as boyes and gyrles: by whom I haue gathered and

derstand their depe dissimulation and detestable dealing, being maruelous
suttle and crafty in their kinde, for not one amongest twenty
will discouer, eyther declare their scelerous secretes: yet with fayr flattering
wordes, money, and good chere, I haue attained to the typpe by
such as the meanest of thē, hath wādered these xiii. yeres, &amp; most xvi.
&amp; som xx. and vpward, and not without fatihful promisse made vnto
them, neuer to discouer their names or any thinge they shewed mee:
for they would all saye, if the vpright men should vnderstand thereof,
they should not bee onely greeuously beaten, but put in daunger of
their lyues, by the sayd vpright men. There was a fewe yeares since a
small breefe set foorth of some zelous man to his countrey, of whom
I knowe not, that made a little shewe of their names and vsage, and
gaue a glymsing light not sufficient to perswade of their peuish pelting
and pyncking practyses, but well worthy of prayse. But (good
ma
                  ••
               me) with no lesse trauell then good will, I haue repayred and rigged
the ship of knowledge, and haue hoyssed vp the sayles of good fortune, that shee may safely passe about and through all parts of this
noble realme, and there make porte sale of hir wished wares, to the
confusion of their drowsey demener, and vnlawfull lāguage, pylfring,
pycking, wyly wandering and lyking lechery, of all these rablement
of rascales that raunges about all the costes of the same, so that their
vndesent dolefull dealing and execrable exercyses may appeare to all
as it were in a glasse, that thereby the Iusticers and Shreeues maye in
their circuites be more vigilant to punishe these malefactores, and the
Constables, Baylifes and housholders, setting asyde all feare, slouth, &amp;
pitie, may bee more circumspect in executing the charge gyuen them
by the aforesayd Iusticers. Then will no more this rascall rablement
raunge about the countrey. Then greater reliefe may be shewed to the
pouerty of eche parishe. Then shall wee keepe our horses in our pastures
vnstolen. Then our lynnen clothes shall and may lye safely on
our hedges vntouched. Then shall wee not haue our clothes and linnen
hooked out at our windowes, as well by daye as by night Then
shall wee not haue our houses broken vp in the nyght, as of late one of
my neyghbours had and twoo great buckes of clothes stolen out, and
most of the same fyne linnen. Then shall wee safely keepe our pigges
and poultrey from pylfering Then shall wee surely passe by the high
wayes leading to markets and faires vnharmed. Then shall our shops
and bothes be vnpicked and spoiled. Then shall these vncomely companies
bee dispersed and set to labour for their lyuing, or hastely hang
for their demerites. Then shall it encourage a great number of gentlemen

and others, seeinge this securitie, to set vp houses and keepe hospitalitie
in the countrey, to the comfort of their neighbours, reliefe of
the poore, and to the amendement of the common wealth. Then shal not
sinne and wyckednes so much abounde among vs. Then will gods
wrath be much the more pacified towards vs. Then shall wee not taste
of so many and sundry plagues as now daylye raigneth ouer vs. And
then shall this famous Empyre be in more welth and better floryshe,
to the inestimable ioye and comforte of the Queenes most excellente
maiestitie, whom God of his infinite goodnes, to his great glory, long
and many yeares make most prosperously to raygne ouer vs, too the
great felicitie of all the Peeres and nobles, and to the vnspeakable ioy,
reliefe and quietnes of mynde of all hir faythfull commons and subiectes.
Now, me thinketh I see how these peuish, peruerse and pestilent
people begin to freat, fume, sweare, and stare at this my booke, theyr
lyfe beinge layde open and apparantly paynted out, that their confusion
and end draweth on apace: where as in deede if it be well wayed, it
is set forth for theyr singular profyt and commoditie, for the sure sauegard
of their liues here in this world, that thei shorten not the same
before their time, and that by their true laboure and good lyfe, in the
world to come they may saue their soules, that Christe the second person
in Trinitie hath so derely bought with his most precious bloudso
that hereby I shall do them more good then they could haue deuised
for themselues. For behold, their life being so manifest wicked, &amp;
so apparantly knowne: the honorable will abhorre them: the woorshipfull
will reiecte them: the yeoman will sharplye tawnte them:
the husband men vtterly defye them: the labouringe men bluntlye
chyde them: the wemen wyth a loude exclamation wonder at them:
And all children wyth clappynge handes crye out at them. I manye
tymes musing with my selfe at these mischeuous myslyuers marueled
when they toke their original and beginning, howe longe they haue
exercised their execrable wandringe about: I thought it meete to confer
with a very olde man that I was well acquainted with, whose witte
and memory is maruelous for his yeares, being about the age of foure
score, what hee knewe when he was yonge of these lousey lewterars.
And he shewed mee that when hee was yonge, he wayted vpon a man
of much worship in Kent, who dyed immediatly after the last Duke
of Buckingham was beheaded, at his buryall there
                  •
                was suche a number
of beggers, besides poore housholders dwelling there abouts, that
vnneth they myght lye or stand aboute the house: then was thereto
prepared for them a great and a large barne, and a great fatte oxe sod

out in Furmenty for them with bread and drinke aboundantly to furnish
out the premisses, and euery person had two pence for such was
the dole VVhē night aproched the pore housholders repaired hom
                  •
               
to their houses, the other wayfaring bold beggers remained all night
in the barn, and the same barne being serched with light in the night
by this old man and then yonge and others, they tolde seuen score
persons of men, euery of them hauing his woman, except it were two
wemen that lay alone togyther for some especiall cause. Thus hauing
their makes to make mery withall: the buriall was tourned to bousing
and belly cheere, mourning to myrth, fasting to feasting, prayer
to pastyme, and pressing of paps and lamenting to lecherye. So that
it may appeare this vncomly company hath had a long continuance
but then nothinge geuen so much to pylferinge, pyckinge and spoling,
and as far as I can learne or vnderstande by the examination of a
number of them, their language which they terme peddelers Frenche
or Canting, began but within these xxx. yeres or litle aboue, and that
the first inuenter thereof was hanged all saue the head, for that is the
finall ende of them al, or elles to dye of some filthy and horrible diseases:
but much harme is done in the meane space by their continuance
as some x. xii. and xvi. yeares before they be consumed; and the number
of them doth dayly renew. I hope their sinne is nowe at the hyghest,
and that as short and as speedy redresse wilbe for these, as hath
bene of late yeares for the wretched, wyly wandering vagabonds calling
and naming them selues Egyptians, deeply dissembling and long
hyding and couering their depe deceiteful practises, feeding the rude
common people wholly addicted and geuen to nouelties, toyes, and
new inuentions, delyting them with the straungenes of the attyre of
their heades, and practising paulmistrye to such as would knowe their
fortunes. And to be short, all theues and hoores (as I may well write)
as some haue had true experience, a number can well witnesse, and a
great sort hath well felte it. And nowe (thankes bee to God) through
wholsome lawes and the due execution thereof, all bee dispersed, banished,
and the memory of them cleane extinguished, that when they
bee once named hereafter, our Chyldren will muche marueill what
kind of people they were: and so I trust shall shortly happen of these.
For what thing doth chiefely cause these rowsey rake helles thus to
continew and dayly increase? surely a number of wicked persons that
keepe typling houses in all shiers, where they haue succoure and reliefe,
and what so euer they bryng, they are sure to receyue money for
the same, for they sel good peny worthes. The byers haue the greatest

gayne, yea yf they haue neither money nor ware, they wylbe trusted,
their credit is much I haue taken a note of a good many of them, and
will send their names and dwelling places to such Iusticers as dwelleth
nere or next vnto them, that they by their good wisedomes may
displace the same, and authorise such as haue honesty. I will not blot
my booke with their names, because they be resident. But as for this
fleeting fellowship, I haue truly set forth the most part of them, that
be doers at this present with their names that they be knowne by.
Also I haue placed in the end therof their leud language, callinge the
same pedlers French or Canting. And now shall I ende my prologue,
making true declaration (right honorable Lady) as they shall fall in
order of their vntemely tryfelinge tyme, leude lyfe, and pernitious
practises, trusting that the same shall neyther trouble or abashe your
most tender, tymerous and pytyfull Nature, to thinke the smal mode
should growe vnto you for such almes so geuen. For God our mercyfull
and most louing father, well knoweth your harte and good entent,
the gyuer neuer wanteth his rewarde, accordinge to the sayinge
of Sainct Augustin: as there is (neyther shalbe) any sinne vnpunished
euen so shall there not be any good deede vnrewarded But how
comfortably speaketh Christ our Sauiour vnto vs in his gospell (giue
ye and it shalbe gyuen you agayne) behold further, good Madam that
for a cup of colde water, Christ hath promised a good rewarde. Nowe
sainct Austine properly declareth why Christ speaketh of cold water,
because the poorest man that is, shall not excuse him selfe from that
charitable work, least he would peraduenture saye that he hath neyther
wood, pot nor pan to warme any water with. See further what
God speaketh in the mouth of his prophet Esaye. Break thy bread to
him that is a hungred, he sayth not giue him a whole lofe: for peraduentute
the poore man hath it not to gyue, then let him gyue a piece.
This much is sayd because the poore that hath it should not be excused,
now how much more then the riche. Thus you see good Madame,
for your treasure here dispersed, where neede and lacke
is, it shalbe heaped vp aboundantly for you in heauen,
wher neither rust or moth shal corrupt or destroy
the same. Vnto which triumphant place after
many good happy, and fortunat yeres prosperously
here dispended, you may for
euer and euer, thero most ioyfully
remayne.
            Amen.

            The Epistle to the Reader.
            ALthough; good Reader I wryte in playne termes,
and not so playnely as truely, concerninge the matter,
meaning honestly to all men, and wish them as
much good, as to myne owne harte, yet as there hathe
bene, so there is now, and hereafter wilbe curious heades
to fynde faultes: wherefore I thought it necessary nowe
at this second Impression, to acquaynt thee with a great
faulte, as some taketh it, but not as I meane it, callinge
these Uagabondes Cursetors, in the Intytuling of my
booke, as runners or rangers about the Countrey, deriued
of this Latin word (C V R R O) neyther do I write it
Cooresetores with a double oo, or Cowresetors wyth a
w, which hath an other signification: is there no diuersitie
betwene a gardein, and a garden, maynteynance, and
maintenance: Streytes, &amp; stretes: those that haue vnderstanding,
knowe there is a great difference: who is so ignorant
in these dayes, as knoweth not the meanynge
of a vagabone? and if any ydell leuterar should so bee called
of any man, woulde not hee thinke it bothe odyous
and reprochfull? will he not shon the name? ye and where
as he may and dare with bent browes, will reuenge that
name of ignominy: yet this playn name vagabone is deriued
as others be of Latin wordes, and now vse makes
it common to all men: but let vs loke backe foure hundred
yeares sithens, and let vs see whether this playne worde
vagabon, was vsed or no? I beleue not, and why? because
I read of no such name in the old estatuts of this realme,
vnlesse it be in the margent of the Booke, or in the Table,
which in the collection and printing was set in, but these
were then the common names of these leud leuterars, say
tores, Robardesmen, Drawlatches, &amp; valiant beggers.
If I should haue vsed such wordes, or the same order of

writing, as this realme vsed in King Henry the thyrd, or
Edward the firstes time. Oh what a grose, barbarous fellowe
haue we here, his writing is both homely &amp; darke,
that we had nede to haue an enterpreter, yet then it was
very well and in short season, a great change we see, well
this delycatage shall haue his time on the othersyde, eloquence
haue I none, I neuer was acquaynted with the
Muses. I neuer tasted of Helycon. But accordinge to my
playne order, I haue set forth this worke, simply and truly
with such vsuall wordes and termes, as is amonge vs
well knowne and frequented. So that as the prouerbe
sayth (althoughe truth bee blamed, it shall neuer bee shamed,)
well good reader, I meane not to be tedious vnto
thee but haue added fyue or sixe more tales, because some
of them were donne whyle my Booke was fyrste in the
presse, and as I truste I haue deserued no rebuke, for my
good will, euen so I desire no prayse for my payne, coste,
and trauell. But faythfully for the profyt and benefyte
of my country, I haue donne it, that the
whole bodye of the Realme, may see and
vnderstand their leud lyfe and pernitious
practises, that all maye
speedely helpe to amende
that is amisse. Amen
say all with me.

            A Rufflar.
            THe Rufflar, bicause he is first in degre of this odious
order: and is so called in a statut made for the punishment
of vagabonds: In the xxvij. yeare of king Henry
the eight late of most famous memory: He shalbe
first placed as the worthiest of this vnraly rablemēt.
And he is so called when he goeth first abroad, either
he hath serued in the warres, or els be hath ben a seruing man and
weary of well doing, shaking of all payne, dooth chuse him this ydle
lyfe, and wretchedly wanders about the most shyres of this realme.
And with stout audacity h
                  •
                demaundeth where he thinketh he may
be bolde, and circumspecte ynough, as he seeth cause to aske charity,
rufully and lamentably, that it would make a fiynty hart to relent,
and pitte his miserable estate, how he hath bene maymed and broused
in the warres, &amp; peraduenture some will shew you som outward
wounde, which he gotte at some dronken fraye, eyther haltinge of
some pre

                  •
               estred with a fylthy firy flankard. For be well
assured that the hardiest souldiers be eyther slayn or maymed, either
if they escape all hassardes, and retourne home agayne, if they bee
without reliefe of their friends, they wil surely desperatly robbe and
steale, or eyther shortly bee hanged or miserably dye in pryson, for
they be so much ashamed and disdayne to beg or aske charity, that
rather they wil as desperately fight for to lyue and mainteyne them
selues as manfully, and valiantly they ventred them selues in the
Princes quarell. Now, these Rufflars the outcastes of seruinge men
when begginge or crauinge fayles, then they picke and pylfer from
other inferiour beggers that they mée
                  •
               e by the way, as Roges, Pal

               yardes,
Mortes, and Dores: yea if they méete with a woman alone
ridinge to the market, eyther old man or boye, that hée well knoweth
will not resiste, such they filche and spoyle. These Rufflars after
a yeare or two at the farthest become vpright men, vnlesse the

                be
preuented by twinde 
                  •
               empe.
            I had of late yeares an old man to my tenant, who customablye
a great tyme, went twise in the wéeke to London, eyther with fruit
or with pescodes, when time serued therefore. And as hee was comming
homewarde on blacke heathe, at the ende thereof next to shooters
hill, he ouertoke two Rufflars, the one manerly waiting on ye
other, as one had ben the maister, and the other the man or seruant

carying his maister cloke: This olde man was very gladde that hée
might haue their cōpany ouer the bill, bicause that day he had made
a good market, for he had seuen shillings in his purse, and an olde
angell, which this pore man had thought had not bene in his purse,
for he willed his wife ouer night to take out the same Angell, and
lay it vp vntill his comming home againe. And he verely thought
that his wyfe had so done, which in deed forgot to doe it. Thus after
salutations, had this maister rufflar entred into cōmunication with
this simple olde man, who ryding softly beside them commoned of
many matters. Thus feding this old man with pleasant talke, vntill
they were on the toppe of the hyll where these rufflars myghte
well behold the coaste about them cleare, quickly steppes vnto this
poore man, and taketh holde of his horse brydell, and leadeth him in
to the wode, and demaundeth of him what and how much money he
had in his purse. Now by my troth quoth this old man, you ar a mery
gentleman, I knowe you meane not to take awaye any thinge
from me, but rather to giue me some if I should aske it of you. By
and by this seruant thiefe casteth the clok that he caried on his arms
about this poore mans face, that he should not marke or vew them,
with sharp words to deliuer quicly that he had and to confesse truly
what was in his purse. This poore man then al abashed yelded and
confessed he had but iust seuen shillinges in his purse and the truth
is be knew of no more. This old angel was falen out of a little purse
into the botome of a great purse. Now this seuen shillings in whyt
money they quickly found, thinkinge in deed that there had bene no
more, yet farther groping and searching, found this old angell. And
with great admiration this gentle man theese began to blesse him,
saying: good Lorde what a worlde is this, howe maye (quoth hee) a
man beleue or trust in the same, see you not (quod he) this old knau
                  •
               
tolde me that he had but seuen shillinges, and here is more by an angell,
what an old knaeu and a false knaue haue we here (quoth this
rufflar) our lord haue mercy on vs, will this worlde neuer bee better,
and therewith went their waye, and lesse the olde man in the
wood doing him no more harme. But sorowfull sighinge this olde
man returning home declared his misaduenture, with al the words
and circumstances aboue shewed, whereat for the tyme was great
laughing, and this pore man for his losses among his louing neighboures
well considered in the ende.
            
               ¶ A Upryght man, Cap. 2.
               
                  A Upright man the second in secte of this vnsemely sort must be
next placed of these rainging rablement of rascales, some be
seruing men, artificers, and laboring men, traded vpp in husbādry:
These not minding to get their liuing with the sweat
of their face, but casting of all payne, wil wander after their wicked
maner, through the most shyres of this realme.
               As Sommerset shyre, Wyll shyre. Barke shyre, Oxforde shyre,
Harforde shyre, Myddilsex, Esse
                     •
                  , Suffolke, Northfolke, Suffex,
Surrye, and Kent, as the chiefe and best shyres of reliefe. Yea not
without punishment by stockes, whyppinges, and imprisonment,
in most of these places aboue sayd: yet notwithstandinge they haue
so good lyking in their lewde lecherous loyteringe, that full quicklye
all their punishmentes be forgotten. And repentaunce is neuer
thought vpon, vntill they clyme thrée trées with a ladder. These vnrewly
rascales in their roylinge, disperse them selues into seuerall
companies, as occasion serueth, sometime more and sometime lesse.
As if they repayre to a poore husbandmans house, hée will go alone
or one with him, and stoutely demaund his charitie, eyther shewing
how he hath serued in the warres and their maymed, eyther that he
seeketh seruice and sayth he would be gladde to take payne for hys
lyuinge, althoughe he meaneth nothing lesse: If he be offered anye
meate or drinke, he vtterly refuseth scornefullye, and will nought
but money, and if he espye yong pygges or poultry, he well noteth
the place, &amp; then the next night or shortly after, he wil be sure to haue
some of them, which they bringe to their stawlinge kens, whiche is
their tippling houses, as well knowen to them according to the olde
prouerbe (as the begger knows his dishe.) For you must vnderstand
euery Typplyng ale house will neither receiue them or their wares
but some certayne houses, in euery shyre, especially for that purpose,
where they shalbe better welcome to them, then honester men For
by such haue they most gayne, and shalbe conuayd eyther into some
loft out of the way, or other secret corner not common to any other,
and thither repayre at accustomed tymes their barlotes which they
terme mortes and Dores, not with emty hands, for they be as skilfull
in picking, riffling &amp; filching, as the vpright men, and nothing
inferior to them in all kinde of wickednes, as in other places herafter
they shalbe touched. At these foresaid pelting penish places and
vnmanerly meetings, O how the pottes walk about, their talking
tounges talke at large: They howle and howse one to anther, and
for the tyme bowsing belly chere. And after their ruysting recreatiō
                  
if there be not rome ynough in the house, they haue cleane straw in
some barne or backe house nere adioining, where they couch comly
togither, as it were dogge and byche, and he that is hardyest mays
haue his choyse, vnlesse for a litlte good maner, some wil take their
owne that they haue made promyse vnto
                     •
                   vntill they be out of sight,
and accordinge to the olde adage (out of minde) Yet these vpright
men stand so much vpon their reputatiō, as thei wil in no case haue
their wemen walke with them, but seperate themselues for a time,
a moneth or more. And mete at fayres or great markets where they
mete to pilfer and steale
                     •
                   from staules, shoppes, or boothes. At these
fayres the vpright men, vse commonly to lye, &amp; lingar in hye wayes
by lanes, some prety way or distance frō the place, by which wayes
they be assured that company passeth still to and fro, and there they
will demaund with cap in hand and comly curtesye, the deuotion &amp;
charitie of ye people. They haue ben much lately whipped at fayrs.
If thei aske at a stout yemans or farmers house his charity, thei wil
goe strong as thre or foure in a company: where for feare more then
good will they often haue reliefe, they seldome or neuer passe by a
Iuststes house, but haue by wayes, vnlesse he dwell alone, and but
weakely manned, thither will they also goe strong after a slye suttle
sorte, as with their armes bounde vp with kercher or lyste, hauinge
wrapt about the same filthy clothes, eyther their legges in such maner
be wrapped halting down right, not vnprouided of good codgils,
which they cary to sustayne them, and as they fayne to kéepe dogges
from them, when they come to such good gentlemens houses, if any
searthe be made or they suspected for pilfering clothes of hedges, or
breaking of houses which they commonly do, when the owners bée
eyther at the market, church, or other wayes occupied about their
busines, eyther robbe some sely man or woman by the hye way, as
many times they do. Then they hygh them into wodes, great thickets,
and other ruffe corners where they lye lurking three or foure
dayes togyther, and haue meate and drinke brought them by theyr
mortes and Dores: and whyle they thus lye bidden in conert, in the
night they be not idle neither as ye common saying is (wel occupied)
for then as the wyly fore, creping out of his den, seketh his praye for
pultery, so do these for 
                     •
                  nnen and any thing else worth money, that
lyeth about or nere a house. As somtime a whole buck of clothes caried
away at time. When they haue a greatter booty, then they
may cary away quickly to their stawlinge kennes as is aboue said,
they will hyde the same for a thre dayes in some thicke, couert and

in the night time cary the same lyke good water Spannels to their
foresayd houses, to whom they will discouer where or in what places
they had the same where the markes shalbe picked out cleane, &amp;
conuayd craftely far of to sell if the mā or woman of the house want
money themselues: and if these vpright men haue nether mony nor
wares, at these houses they shalbe trusted for their vitalles and it amount
to twenty or thirty shillinges: yea if it fortune any of these
vpright men to be taken, either suspected or charged with fellony or
pety brybrye don at such a time or such a place, he will saye he was
in his hostes house. And if the mā or wyfe of that house be examined
by an officer, they boldely vouche that they lodged him such a time,
whereby the truth cannot apeare. And if they chance to be retained
into seruice, through their lamentable wordes, with any welthy mā
they will tary but a small time, eyther robbing his maister, or some
of his fellowes. And some of them vseth this policy, that althoughe
they trauaill into all these shyres aboue said, yit will thei haue good
credite, especially in one shyre, where at diuers good farmers houses
they be well knowne, wher thei worke a moneth in place or more
and will for that time behaue themselues very honestly &amp; paynfully.
And may at any time for their good vsage haue woorke of them, and
to these at a dead lift or last refuge, thei may safely repayre vnto, &amp;
be welcom, when in other places for a knacke of knauery that they
haue plaid thei dare not tary. These vpright mē wil sildom or neuer
want, for what is gotten by any Morte or Dore, if it please him hée
doth commaund the same: and if he mete any begger, whether he be
sturdy or impotent, he will demaund of him whether euer hee was
stalled to the roge or no. If he say he was, he will know of whom, &amp;
his name y• stalled him. And if he be not learnedly able to shew him the whole circumstance thereof, he will spoyle him of his money, either
of his best garment if it be worth any money, and haue him to
the bowsing ken: which is, to some typpling house next adioyninge
and layeth ther to gage the best thing that he hath for twenty pence
or two shillings: this man obeyeth for feare of beating. Then dooth
this vpright man call for a gage of bowse, which is a quarte potte of
drinke and powres the same vpon his peld pate, adding these words
I. G. P, do stalle thee W. T. to the Roge, and that from hencefoorth
it shalbe lawfull for thee to Cant, that is to aske or begge for thi liuing

wel house which standeth on the backeside of my house a great cawdron
of copper being then full of water, hauinge in the same halfe a
dosen of pewter dishes well marked and stamped wt the con

being of such bignes that one man vnlesse he wer of great strength

                  erres that no such vessell should be eyther
conueyed to London, or into Essex, promising the lyke reward,
to haue vnderstanding therof. This my doing was well vnderstand
in many places about, and that the feare of espying so troubled th

               THese hokers or Anglers be perillous and most wicked knaues,

they walk a day times from house to house to demaund charitie, thei
vigilantly mark where, or in what place they may attayne to there
pray, casting their eyes vp to euery window, wel noting what they
sée ther, whether apparell or linnen, hanging neere vnto the sayde
wyndows, and that wil they be sure to haue y• next night folowing,
for they customably cary with them a staffe of v. or vi. foote long, in
which, within one inch of y• top therof is a little hole 
                     •
                  ored through:

in which hole they putte an yron hoke, and with the same they will
pluck vnto them quikly any thing yt thei may reach therwith, which
hoke in the day time they couertly cary about thē, and is neuer sene
or taken out till they come to the place where they worke their feat,
such haue I sene at my house &amp; haue oft talked with them and haue
handled their staues not thē vnderstanding to what vse or intent thei
serued, although I had and perceyued by their talke and behauiour
great likelihode of euill suspition in them, they wil either leane vppon
their staffe to hyde the hole therof, when they talk with you, or
hold their hande vpon the hole, and what stuffe either wollen or linnen,
they thus hoke out, thei neuer cary the same forthwith to their
stauling kens, but hides the same a iii. daies in some secret corner, &amp;
after conueis the same to their houses abouesaid where their host or
hostys giueth them money for the same but half the value that it is
worth, or els their Doxes shal a far of sell the same at the like houses.
I was credibly informed that a hoker came to a farmers house
in the dead of the night, and putting abacke a drawe windowe of a
low chamber, the bed standing hard by the said window, in whiche
lay thrée persons, a man and two bigge boyes: this hoker wyth hys
staffe plucked of their garments which lay vpon them to kepe them
warme, with the couerlet and shete, and left them lying a slepe naked
sauing their shyrtes, and had away all cleane &amp; neuer could vnderstand
where it became. I verely suppose that when they were
wel waked with cold, they surely thought that Robin good fellow,
(according to the old saying) had bene with them that night.

And all this fayned, because without feare they woulde wickedly

with short curtesie (when they came into the house) such as thei
saw fitting there: in which cōpany was the parson of the parish, and
calling for a pot of the best ale, sat down at the tables end: the liquor
liked them so well that they had pot vpon pot, &amp; sometime for a little
good maner would drink and offer the cup to such as thei best fancied
and to be short they sat out al the cōpany, for ech man departed home
about their busines: when they had well refreshed themselues, then
these rowsy roges requested the good man of the house with his wife
to sit down and drink with them: of whom thei inquired what priest
the same was and wher he dwelt, then thei faining that they had an
vncle a priest, &amp; that he should dwell in these partes which by al presumptions
it should be he, and that they came of purpose to speak wt

               ¶ A Wylde Roge. Cap. 5.
               A Wilde Roge is he that is borne a Roge, he is more subtill and
more gyuen by nature to all kind of knauery then the other, as
heastly begotten in barn or bushes, and from his infancy traded vp
in trechery: yea and before rypenes of yeares doth permit, wallowing
in lewd lechery, but that is counted amongst them no sin. For
this is their custome, that when they méete in barne at night, euery
one getteth a mate to lye withall, and there chaunce to be twentye
in a company, as their is sometime more, and sometime lesse: for to
one man that goeth abroad, there ar at the least two women, which
neuer make it straunge when they bee called, although shee neuer
knew him before. Then when the day doth appeare, hée rouses him
vp and shakes his eares, and away wandering where he maye gette
ought to the hurt of others. Yet before he skyppeth out of his couche
and departeth from his darling (if he like her well) he will appoynte
her where to méete shortly after, with a warning to worke warely
for some chetes, that their méeting might be the merier.
               Not long sithens, a wild roge chaunced to mete a pore neighbor of
mine who for honesty &amp; good nature surmounteth many. This pore
man riding homeward from London, where he had made his market:

this roge demaunded a peny for Gods sake to keepe him a tru

                  ied him
as he sayd to see him want, for he was well able to serue his prince
in the warres. Thus being moued with pitie, loked in his purse too
find out a peny, and in loking for the same, he plucked out viii. shillings
in whyt money, and raked therin to find a single peny, and at
the last finding one, doth offer the same to this wild roge but he séeing
so much money in this simple mans hand, beeing striken to the
hart with a couetous desire, hid him forthwith to deliuer all that hée
had, or else he would with his staffe beat out his braynes: for it was
not a peny would nowe quench his thirst séeing so much as he dyd:
thus swallowing his spittell gredely down, spoyled this poore man
of all the money that hee had, and lept ouer the hedge into a thicke
wood, and went his way as merely as this good simple man came
home sorowfully. I once rebucking a wilde Roge, because he wente idelly about:
he shewed me that he was a begger by inheritance, his
Grandfather was a begger, his father was one, and he must nedes
be one by good reason.
            
            
               A Prigger of Prauncers. Cap. 6.
               A Prigger of Prauncers be horse stealers, for to prigge signifieth
in their language to steale, &amp; a Prauncer is a horse, so being put
togither, the matter was playn. These go commonly in Ierkins of
leather or of whyt fréese, &amp; cary little wands in their hands, and wil
walke through grounds and pastures, to search and sée horses méete
for their purpose, and if they chaunce to be met &amp; asked by the ownners
of the ground what they make there, they fayne strayghte that
they haue lost their way and desire to be instructed the best waye to
such a place. These will also repayre to gentlemens houses &amp; aske
their charitie
                     •
                   and will offer their seruice. And if you aske thē what
they can doe, they will say that they can kepe two or three Geldings
and wayte vpon a Gentleman. These haue also their women that
walking from them in other places, marke where and what they sée
abroade, and sheweth these Priggars therof, whē they méet, which
is within a weeke or two, and looke where they steale any thinge,
they conuey the same at the least thrée score myles of or more.
               ¶ There was a Gentleman, a very friend of myne, ryding from
London homeward into Kent, hauinge wyth in thrée myles of hys
house businesse, alyghted of his horse, and his man also, in a pretye

village, where diuers houses were, and looked about him where he
might haue a conuenient person to walke his horse, because hee
would speake wt a Farmer that dwelt on the backe side of the sayde
villag
                     •
                   litle aboue a quarter of a myle from the place where he lighted
and had his man to waight vpon him
                     •
                   as it was mete for his callinge,
espying a Priggar there standing, thinking the same to dwel
there, charging this prety prigging person to walke his horse well,
and that they might not stand still for taking of colde, and at his returne
(which he said should not be longe) he would giue him a peny
to drinke, and so went about his busines. This pelting Priggar,
proud of his praye, walketh his horse vp and downe, tyll hee sawe
the Gentleman out of sight, and 
                     •
                  eapes him into the saddell, and away
he goeth a mayne. This Gentleman returninge, and fynding
not his horses, sent his man to the one end of the village, &amp; he went
himselfe vnto the other end
                     •
                   and enquired as he went for his horses
that were walked
                     •
                   and began somewhat to suspecte, bicause neither
he nor his man could sée nor find him. Then this getleman diligently
enquired of three or foure town dwellers there, whether any such
person, declaring his stature, age, apparell, with so many linaments
of his body as he could call to remembrance. And vna voce all sayde
that no such man dwelt in their streat, neither in the parish that thei
knew of, but somy did wel remember that such a one

                   and marched home manerly in his botes
far from the place he dwelt not. I suppose at his comming home he
sent such wayes as he suspected or thought méete to searche for thys

to my house to common with me about certayne affaires. I inuited
the same to dinner, and dinner being done, I demaunded of him
some newes of these parties were hee dwelt. Thankes bee to God
syr (saith he) all is well &amp; good now. Now (quoth I) this same nowe

declareth y• some things of late hath not bene wel. Yes syr (q he) the
matter is not great, I had thought I should haue bene well beaten
within this seuenth night: how so (quoth I) mary syr sayd hee, I am
Constable for fault of a better, and was commaunded by the Iusticer
to watch. The watch being set, I toke an honest man one of my
neighbours with me and went vp to the end of the town as farre as
the spittle house: at which house I heard a great noyse, and drawing
neere stode close vnder the wall, and this was at one of the clocks
after midnight
                     •
                   where he harde swearinge, pratinge, and wagers
laying, and the pot apace walking, and xl. pence gaged vpon a matche
of wrastling, pitching of the barre, and casting of the sledge: and
out they go in a fustian sume into the back syde, where was a great
Axiltry, and there fell to pitching of the bar, being thrée to three: the
Moone did shyne bright, the Constable with his neighboure might
sée and beholde al that was done. And howe the wyfe of the house
was rosting of a Pyg, whyle her gestes were in their match. At the
last they could not agrée vpon a caste and fell at wordes, and from
wordes to blowes. The Constable wyth his fellowe runnes vntoo
them to parte them, and in the parting lyckes a drye blowe or two.
Then the noyse increased, the Constable would haue had them too
the stockes. The wyfe of the house runnes out with hir good man to
intreat the Constable for her grstes, and leaues the Pyg at the fyre
alone. In commeth two or thrée of the next neighboures being waked
with this noyse, and into the house they come and fynde none
therein but the Pygge well rosted, and carieth the same away with
them, spit and all, with such breade and drinke also as stoode vppon
the table. When the goodman and the good wyfe of the house had
intreated and pacified the Constable, she winge vnto him that they
were Proctors and Factors, all of Spyttle houses, and that they taryed
there but to breake their faste, and woulde ryde away immediately
after, for they had farre to goe, and therefore mente to ryde so
earely. And comminge into their house agayn, fyndinge the Pygge
with bread and drinke al gone, made a great exclamation, for they
knew not who had the same.
               The Constable returning and hearing the lamentable words
of the good wyfe how she had lost both meate and drinke, and sawe
it was so indeed, he laughed in his sleue, and commaunded her to
dresse no more at vnlawfull houres for any gestes: for he thought if
better bestowed vpon those smel feastes his pore neighbours, then
vppon suche sturdye Lubbares. The next morninge betymes, the

the spitte and pottes were set at the Spittle house doore for the owner?
Thus were these Factours begyled of their breakfast, and one
of them had well beaten an other: and by my troth (quoth this Constable)
I was glad when I was well ryd of them. Why quoth I,
could they cast the barre and sledge well? I will tell you syr (quoth
hée) you know there hath bene many games this sommer, I thinck
verely, that if some of these Lubbars had bene there, and practysed amongest
others. I beleue they would haue caryed aways the best
games: for they were so stronge and sturdy that I was not able to
stand in their handes. Well (quoth I) at these games you speak of,

man, and when he was executed for very pensiuenes of minde

he fell out of his witte, and so continued a yeare after and more, and
that with the very gréefe and feare, he was taken with a maruelous
palsey, that both head and handes will shake when he talketh with
any and that apace or faste, whereby he is much pytied, and getteth
greatly. And if I hadde not demaunded of others both men and women,

               THese fresh water Mariners, their shippes were drowned in the
playne of Salisbury. These kinde of Caterpillers, counterfet
great losses on the sea, these be some Western men, and moste bee
Irish men. These will runne about the countrey with a counterfet
licence, fayninge eyther shipwracke, or spoyled by Pyrates, neare

towne there, hauing a large and formall writinge, as is aboue
sayd, with the names and seales of such men of woorshippe at the
least foure or fiue as dwelleth neare or next to the place where they
fayne their landing. And neare to those shyeres will they not begge

ryuer to seeke for their shippe and goods that they neuer hadde, then
passe they through Surrey, Sussex, by the sea coastes, &amp; so into kent,
demaunding almes to bringe them home to their countrey.
               Sometime they counterfet the seale of the Admiraltie, I haue diuers
times taken awaye from them their licences of bothe sortes,
with suche money as they haue gathered, and haue confiscated the
same to the pouertie nighe adioyninge to me. And they will not be
longe without an other, for at any good Towne they will renewe
the same. Once with muche threatninge and fayre promises, I required
to knowe of one companye who made their licence. And they
sware that they bought the same at Portsmouth of a Mariner
there, and it cost them two shillings, with such warrants to bee so
good and effectual, that if any of the best men of lawe or learned aboute
London shoulde peruse the same, they were able to fynde no
faute therewith, but would assuredly allow the same.

most pitiously. And if any clothes be giuen them they immediately
sell the same, for weare it they will not, because they would be the
more pitied, and we are filthy clothes on their heads, and neuer goe
without a péece of whyte sope about them, which if they sée cause or
present gayn, they will priuely conuay the same into their mouth, &amp;
so worke the same there, that they will fome as it were a Boore, and

               ¶ Uppon Alhallonday in the morning last Anno Domini 1566. or
my boke was halfe printed, I meane the first impression, there came
earely in the morninge a counterfet Cranke vnder my lodginge at
the whyte Fryers within the cloyster, in a little yard or court wherabouts
lay two or thre great Ladyes, being without the liberties of
London, wherby he hoped for the greatter gayne: this Cranke there
lamentably lamenting, and pitifully crying to be relieued, declared
to diuers there his paynful and miserable disease. I being rysen and
not halfe ready, hard his dolful words and ruful mournings, hear i
                     •
                  
him name the fallen sicknes, thought assuredlye to my selfe, that hée
was a depe desembler: so comming out at a sodayne, and beholding
his ougly and yrksome attyre, his lothsom and horible coūtinance, it
made me in a maruelous perplexity what to think of him, whether
it were fained or trueth for after this maner went he: he was naked
from y• wast vpward, sauing he had an old Ierkin of leather, patched
and that was lose about him, that all his bodye lay out bare a filthy
soul cloth he ware on his head, being cut for the purpose, hauing a narow
place to put out his face, wt a bauer made to trusse vp his beard,
and a string that tyed the same down close about his necke, with an
old felt hat which he still caried in his hand, to receyue the charitye
and deuotion of the people, for that would he hold out from him, hauing
his face from the eyes downward, all smerd with fresh bloud,

as though he had new fallen, and bin tormented with his paynefull
panges, his ierken being all berayde with durte and myre, and hys
harte and hosen also, as thoughe hée hadde wallowed in the myer:
surely the sight was monstrous and terrible. I called him vnto me
and demaunded of him what he ayled. A good maister, quoth he, I
haue the gréeuous and payneful disease called the falling sickenes:
why, quoth I, how commeth thy ierkin, hose and hat so berayd wyth
durt and myer, and thy skin also? A good maister I fell down on the
backesyde here in a fowle lane harde by the water syde, and there I
laye almost all night, and haue bled all moste all the bloude out in
my body. It raynd that morninge very faste: and whyle I was thus
talking with him, a honest poore woman that dwelt thereby, brought
him a fayre lynnen cloth, and bid hym wype his face therewith,
and there being a tobbe standing full of rayn water, offered to giue
him some in a dishe, that he might make himselfe cleane, he refuseth
the same: why dost thou so quoth I? A syr saith he, if I shoulde washe
my selfe, I should fall to bleding a fresh agayne, and then I shoulde
not stop my selfe: these words made me the more to suspecte hym.
               Then I asked of him where he was born, what his name was, how
long he had this disease, and what time he had ben here about London,
and in
                     •
                   what place 
                     •
                   syr (sayth he) I was borne at Leycestar, my
name is Nicholas Genings, and I haue had this falling sicknes viij
yeares, and I can get no remedy for the same, for I haue it by kind,
my father had it and my friends before mee, and I haue bene these
two yeares here about London, and a yere and a half in Bethelem:
why wast thou out of thy wittes, quoth I? yea syr that I was.
               What is the kepers name of the house? his name is (quoth he) Iohn
Smith
                     •
                   then quoth I, hée muste vnderstande of thy disease, if thou
hadest the same for the time thou wa
                     •
                  t there, he knoweth it wel, ye
not only he, but all the house besyde, quoth this Cranke, for I came
thens but within this fortnight. I had stand so longe reasoning the
matter with him, that I was a cold and went into my chamber and
made me ready, and commaunded my seruant to repayr to bethlem
and bring me true word from the kéeper there, whether anye suche
man hath ben with him as a prisoner, hauing the disease aforesayd,
and gaue him a no
                     •
                  e of his name &amp; the kéepers also: my seruant returning
to my lodging, dyd assure me that neyther was there euer
any such man there, neither yet any keper of any suche name, but
hee that was the kéeper sent mée his name in writing, affirminge
that he letteth no man depart from him, vnlesse he be fet aways by

his friendes, and that none that came from him begged aboute the
Citie: then I sent for the Printer of this booke, and shewed him of
this dissembling Crank, and how I had sent to Bethelem to vnderstand
the tr
                     •
                  th, and what aunsweare I receiued againe, requiringe
him that I might haue some seruant of his to watch him faythfully
that daye, that I might vnderstand trustely to what place he would
repaire at night vnto, and thyther I promysed to goe my selfe, to see
their order, and that I would haue him to associate me thyther: hée
gladly graunted to my request, and sent two boyes that bothe diligently &amp;
vigilantly, accomplisht the charge giuen them, &amp; found the
same Cranke about the Temple, where about the most parte of the
day he begged, vnlesse it were abou
                     •
                   xii. of the clocke, hee wente on
the backsyde of Clementes Ine without Temple barre, there is a
lane that goeth into the Fieldes, there hée renewed his face agayne
with freshe bloud, which he caried about him in a bladder, and dawbed
on fresh dyrte vpon his, ierken, hat and hosen.
               And so came backe agayne vnto the Temple, and sometyme to
the Water syde, and begged of all that passed by: the boyes behelde
how some gaue grotes, some sire pence, some gaue more: for hée
looked so ougley and yrksomly, that euery one pitied his miserable
case that beheld him: to be shorte, there he passed all the daye tyll
night approched
                     •
                   and when it began to be some what dark, he went
to the water syde and toke a Skoll
                     •
                  er, and was set ouer the water
into Saincte Georges fieldes, contrary to my expectation: for I had
thought he would haue gonne into Holborne, or to saynt Gylles in
the field: but these boyes with (Argues and Lynces tyes) sette sure
watch vppon him, and the one toke a Boate and followed him, and
the other went back to tell his maister.
               The boy that so folowed him by water, had no money to pay for
his boate hyre, but layd his Penner and his 
                     •
                  nckhorne to gage for
a penny, and by that tyme the boye was set ouer: his maister wyth
all celeritie had taken a Boate and followed him a pace. Now had
they a syght still of the Cranke, whiche crossed ouer the fieldes towardes
Newington, and thither the went, &amp; by that time they came
thether, it was very darke. The Printer had there no acquaintance,
neyther any kinde of weapon about him, neyther knewe he howe
farre the Cranke would goe, because hee then suspected that they
dogged him of purpose, hee there stayed him, and called for y• Constable,
which came foorth diligently, to inquire what the matter
was. This zelous Printer charged this officer with him as a malefactor,

and a dissembling vagabond: the Constable woulde haue
layd him all night in the Cage that stode in the streat: nay saith this
pytyfull Printer, I pray you haue him into your house, for this is
lyke to be a cold night and he is naked, you kepe a vittelling house,
let him be well cherished this night, for he is well able to paye for
the same, I knowe well his gaynes hath ben great to day, and your
house is a sufficient pryson for the tyme, and we will there searche
him: the Constable agreed thereunto, they hadde him in and caused
him to washe himself: that done, they demaunded what money hée
had about him, sayth this Cranke, so God helpe me I haue but xij.
pence, and plucked out the same of a little purse. Why haue you no
more quoth they? no sayth this Cranke, as God shall saue my soule
at the day of iudgment. We must sée more quoth they and began to
strip him, then he plucked out another purse wherein was xl. pence.
Tush sayth this Printer I must sée more, this Cranke sayth, I pray
God I be damned both body and soule, if I haue any more: No saith
this Printer, thou false knaue here is my boye that did watch thée al
this day, and sawe when suche men gaue thée péeces of sire pence,
grot
                     •
                  s and other money, and yit thou hast shewed vs none but smal
money. When this Cranke heard this, and the boy vowing it to his
face, he relented and plucked out another purse wherein was eight
shillings &amp; od money, so had they in the whole that he had begged y•
day. xiij. shillings iij. pence half peny: then they stript him starke naked,
and as many as saw him, sayd they neuer saw hansommer mā,
with a yellow fleren beard, and fayre skinned without any spot or
greffe, then the good wyfe of the hause fet her goodmans old cloke,
and caused the same to be cast about him, because the sight shoulde
not abashe her shamefast maydens, nether loth hir squaimish sight.
Thus he set him downe at the Chemnes end, and called for a pot of
Béere and dranke of a quart at a drafte, and called for another, and
so the third, that one had ben sufficient for any reasonable man: the
drynk was so stronge, that I my self the next morning tasted therof,
but let the reader iudge what, and how much he would haue dronke
if he had bene out of fear. Then when they had thus wrong water
out of a flint, in spoylīg him to his euill gottē goods, his passing pence

and deuised to search a barne for som roges, &amp; vpright men, a quarter
of a myle from the house, that stode alone in the fieldes, &amp; wente
out about their busines, leauing this cranke alone with hys wyfe

hauing got once the tast of this lewed laysy lyfe, for al this fayr
admonition but deuised other suttell sleights to maintaine his ydell

Mariners apparel, went abroad to aske charity of y• people, fayning
they hadde loste their shippe with all their goods by casualty on the

Genings, and I came from Lecester to séekeworke, and I am a hat
maker by my occupation, and all my money is spent, and if I coulde
get money to paye for my lodging this night: I would seke work tomorowe

Cranke that ranne away vpon Alholon daye last. The Constable
being very loth to medle with him, but the printer knowing

the Debutie asked the Printer what he woulde laye vnto hys
charge, he answered &amp; aleged him to be a vagabond and depe deceyuer
of the people, and the counterfet Crank that ran away vpon Alhallon
day last from the Constable of Newington and him, and requested
him earnestly to send him to ward: the debuty thinking him
to be deceiued, but neuerthelesse laid his cōmaundement vpon him,
so that the Printer should beare his charges if he could not iustifie it
he agréed thereunto. And so he and the Constable went to cary him
to the Counter, and as they were going vnder Ludgate, this crafty
Crank toke his héeles &amp; ran down the hill as fast as he could dryue,
the Constable and the Printer after him as fast as they coulde, but
the Printer of ye twayn being lighter of fote, ouertoke him at fleete
bridge, and with strong hand caried him to the Counter, and safely
deliuered him. In ye morow ye printer sent his boy that stripped him
vpon Alhalon day at night to view him because he would b

                  e sure,
which boy knew him very well: this Crank confessed vnto the Debuty,
ye he had hosted the night before in Kent stréet in Southwarke
at the signe of the Cock, which thing to be true, the printer sente to
know &amp; found him a lyer, but further, inquiring at length found out
his habitation, dwelling in maister Hilles rentes, hauinge a pretye
house well stuffed with a fayre ioyne table, and a fayre Cubbard
garnished with peuter, hauing an old auncient woman to his wife.

The Printer being sure therof, repaired vnto the Counter, and rebuked
him for his beastly behauiour, &amp; told him of his false fayning,
willed him to confesse it and aske forgiuenes: he perceyued him to
know his depe dissimulation, relented and confessed all his disceit, &amp;
so remayning in the counter thrée dayes, was remoued to Brydwel
where he was stript starke naked, and his ougly attyre put vpō him
before the maisters thereof, who wondred greatly at his dissimulation:
for which offence he stode vpon the Pillery in Cheapsyde, both
in his ougly and handsome attyre. And after that went in the myll
whyle his ougly picture was a drawing, and then was whypped at
a Cartes tayle through London, and his displayd banner caried before

their remayned for a time, &amp; at length let at libertie on that condiciō

               A Dommerar. Cap. 12.
               THese Dommerars are leud and moste subtill people, the moste
part of these are Walch men, and will neuer speak, vnlesse they
haue extréeme punishment but will gape, and with a marucious
force will hold downe their toungs doubled, groninge for your charitie,
and holding vp their handes full piteously, so that with their
déepe dissimulation they get very much. There are of these many, &amp;
but one that I vnderstand of hath lost his toung in déed: hauing on a
tyme occasion to ryde to Dartford to speake with a priest there, who
maketh all kind of cōserues very well, and vseth stilling of waters.
And repayring to his house, I found a Dommerar at his doore, and
the priest himselfe perusing his licence, vnder the seales and handes
of certayne worshipfull men, had thought the same to bee good and
effectual. I taking the same writing and reading it ouer and no

where I dwelt, for there was no other way for him. And comming
homeward, I found them in the towne accordinge to my expectation,
wher they where staid, for there was a Palliard associate

with the Dommerar and partaker of his gaynes, which Pallyards
I saw not at Darford. The staiers of them was a gentleman called
Chayne, &amp; a seruant of my Lord Kéepers, called Wostestow, which
was the chief causer of the staying of them, being a Surgien &amp; cunning
in his science, had séene the like practises, and as he sayd hadde
caused one to speake afore that was dome. It was my chaunce to
come at the beginnīg of the matter. Syr (q this Surgien) I am bold
here to vtter some part of my cunning, I trust (quoth he) you shall sée
a myracle wrought anon: for I once (quoth he) made a domme man
to speak. Quoth I you are wel met, and somwhat you haue preuented
me
                     •
                   for I had thought to haue done no lesse or they hadde passed
this towne, for I well knowe their writing is fayned, and they depe
dissemblers. The Surgien made him gape, &amp; we could sée but halfe
a toung. I required the Surgien to put his finger in his mouth, &amp; to
pull out his toung, and so he did, notwithstanding he held strongly
a prety whyle: at the length he pluckt out the same, to the great admiration
of many that stode by: yet when we sawe his tounge, hée
would neither speake nor yet could heare. Quoth I to the Surgien,
knit t
                     •
                  o of his fingers togither and thrust a stycke betwene them,
and rubbe the same vp and downe a little whyle, and for my lyfe he
speaketh by and by. Syr quoth this Surgien, I pray let me practise
an other way, I was well contented to sée the same. He had him into
a house, and tyed a halter aboute the wrestes of his handes and

                     •
                  oysed him vp ouer a beam, and their did let him hang a good while
at length for very paine he required for gods sake to let him downe.
So he that was both deafe and dume could in short tyme both heare
and speake. Then I tooke that money I could find in his purse, and
distributed the same to the poore people dwelling there, which was
xv. pence halfpeny, being all that wee coulde finde. That done, and
this mery myracle madly made. I sent them with my seruant to the
nect Iusticer, where they preached on the pyllery for want of a pulpet,
and were well whypped, and none did bewayle them.
            
            
               A Dronken Tinckar. Cap. 13.
               THese dronken Tinckars called also prygges, be beastly people, &amp;
these yong knaues be ye worst: these neuer goe wtout their dores
and if their woman haue any thing about them, as apparell or linnen
that is worth the selling, they lay the same to gage or sell it out
right (for bene house) and their bowsing ken. And full sone will they

bée weary of them, and haue a new When they happen one worke
at any good house, their Dores lynger alooft, and tarry for them in
some corner, and if he taryeth longe from her, then the knoweth he
hath worke, and walketh neare, and sitteth downe by him. For besydes
money he loketh for meate and drink for doing his dame pleasure.
For if she haue thrée or foure holes in a pan, hee will make as
many more for spedy gayne. And if he see any olde kettle, chafer or

liue with deceyte.

mingled with a little worke for a colour, they passe their time
            
            
               ¶ A Swadder or Pedler. Cap. 14.
               THese Swadders and Pedlers be not all euill, but of an indifferent
behauiour. These stand in great awe of the vpright men,
for they haue often both wares and mony of them. But for as much
as they seeke gayne vnlawfully agaynst the lawes and statutes of
this noble realme, they are well worthy to be registred amonge the
number of vacabonds: and vndoutedly I haue hadde some of them
brought before me when I was in commission of the peace as malefactors
for brybering and stealing. And now of late it is a greate
practice of the vpright man, when he had gotten a bo

                  ye to bestowe
the same vpon a packeful of wares, and so goeth a time for his pleasure,
because he would lyue without suspicion.
            
            
               A Iarke man, and a Patrico. Cap. 15.
               FOR as much as these two names a Iarkeman and a Patrico be
in the old briefs of vacabonds, and set forth as two kindes of euil
doers, you shall vnderstande that a Iarkeman hath hys name of a
Iarke, which is a seale in their Language, as one should make writings
and set seales for licences and pasports. And for trueth there
is none that goeth about the countrey of them that can eyther wryte
so good and fayre a hand, eyther indite so learnedly as I haue sene &amp;

handled a number of them: but haue the same made in good townes
where they come, as what can not be had for money, as the prouerbe
saith, Omnia venalia Romae, and many hath confessed the same to me
Now also there is a Patrico
                     •
                   and not a Patriarcha, whiche in their
language is a priest that should make mariages till death did depart
but they haue none such I am well assured. for I put you out of dout
that not one amongst a hundreth of them are maried, for they take
lechery for no sinne, but naturall felowship and good liking loue, so
that I will not blot my booke with these two that be not.
            
            
               A Demaunder for glymmar. Cap. 16.
               THese Demaunders for glymmar be for the most parte women,
for glymmar in their language is fyer: these goe with fayned lycences
and counterfayted writings, hauing the hands and seales of
suche Gentlemen as dwelleth neare to the place where they fayne
themselues to haue bene burnt, and their goods consumed with fyre.
They will most lamentably demaund your charity and wil quickly
shed salt teares
                     •
                   they be so tender harted. They will neuer begge in
that shyre where their losses (as they saye) was. Some of these goe
with states at their backes, which is a sheete to lye in a nights. The
vpright men be very familiar with these kinde of women, and one
of them helpes another.
               A Demaunder of glymmar came to a good towne in Kente, to
aske the charitie of the people, hauing a fayned licēce about her that
declared her misfortune by fyer done in Somershet shyre, walkinge
with a wallet on her shoulders wherin she put the deuotion of such
as hadde no money to gyue her, that is to say, malte, wooll, baken,
bread and cheese: and alwayes as the same was full, so was it ready
money to her when the emptyed the same, wher so euer shee traueled.
This harlot was (as they terme it) snowt fayre, and hadde an
vpright man or two alwayes attending on her watche (which is on
her person) and yet so circumspect, that they would neuer be seene in
her company in any good Towne, vnles it were in small villages,
where typling houses where, eyther traueling togither by the high
wayes, but the truth is by report) she would wéekely be worth vi. or
seuen shillings with her begging and bychery. This glymmerynge
Morte repayring to an Ine in the said town where dwelt a widow
of fifty yeare old, of good wealth, but shee had an vnthrifty sonne,
whom she vsed as a chamberlaine to attend gestes whē thei repaired

to her house, this amerous man beholding with ardant eyes: thys
glymmering glauncer, was presently piteousely persed to the hart,
and lewdly longed to be clothen vnder her liuery, and bestowing a
fewe fonde wordes with her, vnderstood straight that she would be
easely perswaded to liking lechery, and as a man mased, mused how
to attayne to his purpose, for be hadde no money. Yet considering
with him selfe that wares would bee welcome where money wanteth,
he went with a wanion to his mothers chamber and there séeking
about for odde endes, at length found a little wishell of siluer
that his mother did vse customably to weare on, and had forgot the
same for haste that morning, and offeres the same closely to this manerly
marian, that if she would méete him on the backesyde of the
town, and curteously kys him without constraint, she should be mystresse
therof and it were much better: wel sayth she you are a wanton,
and beholding the wishell, was farther in loue therewith, then
rauisht with his person, and agréed to méete him presently and to
accomplish his fond fancy: to be short and not tedious, a quarter of a
myle from the towne he merely toke measure of her vnder a baudy
bush (so she gaue him that she had not, and he receyued that he could
not) and taking leaue of ech other with a curteous kisse, she pleasantly
passed forth on her iorney, and this vntoward lecherous chamberlayne repayred homeward. But or these twoo tortylles tooke their
leaue, the good wyfe had missed her whishle, &amp; sent one of her maydens
into her chamber for the same, and being long sought for, none
could be found, her mystres hearing that, diligent search was made
for the same, and that it was taken a way, began to suspecte her vnblessed
babe, and demaunded of her maydens whether none of them
saw hir sonne in her chamber that morning, and one of them aunswered
that she saw him not there but comming from thence, then
had she ynough, for well she wist that he had the same, and sente for
him, but he could not be found: then she caused her hosteler, in whō
she had better affiance in for his trueth, and yet not one amongest
twenty of them but haue well left their honesty (as I heare a greate
sort say) to come vnto her, which attended to know her pleasure, goe
séeke out saith she my vntoward sonne, and bid him come speake
with me. I saw him goe out saith hee, halfe an houre sithens on the
backsyde, I had thought you had sent him of your arrant. I sent him
not quoth she, goe looke him out.
               This hollow hosteler toke his staffe in his neck, and trudged out
apace that way he saw him before go, and had some vnderstanding

by one of the maydens that his mistres had her wishell stolen &amp; suspected
her sonne, and he had not gon far but that he espyed him comming
homeward alone, and meting him, asked where he had bene?
where haue I ben q he, and began to smyle, now by the masse thou
hast ben at some baudy banquet: thou haste euen tolde troth q this
chamberlayne: surely q this hosteler, thou haddest the same woman
that begged at our house to day, for the harmes she had by fire, wher
is she q he? she is almost a myle by this tyme q this chamberlayne,
where is my mistres whishel quoth this hosteler, for I am wel assured
that thou haddest it, &amp; I feare me thou hast giuen it to that harlot.
Why, is it missed quoth this chamberlayn? yea q this hosteler,
and shewed him al the whole circumstance what was both said and
thought on him for the thing. Well I wil tel thée quoth this chamberlayne,
I will be playne with thée. I had in dede &amp; haue giuen the
same to this woman, and I pray thée make the beste of it, and helpe
now to excuse the matter, and yet surely and thou wouldest take so
much payne for me as to ouertake her, for she goeth but softly and is
not yit farre of and take the same from her, &amp; I am euer thyne assured
friend. Why then go with me quoth this hosteler, nay in fayth
quoth this Chamberlayne what is frear then gift, and I had preaty
pastime for the same: hade
                     •
                  t thou so quoth this hosteler? now by the
masse and I will haue some to, or I will lye in the duste or I come a
gain. Passing with hast to ouertake this paramoure within a myle
frō y• place wher he departed he ouertoke hir hauing an vprightmā
in her company a strong and a sturdy vacabond, somewhat amased
was this hosteler to see one familiarly in hir company, for he had wel hoped
to haue had some delicate daliaunce as his fellow hadde, but
séeing the matter so fal out, and being of good corage, and thinking
to him selfe that one true man was better then two false knaues, &amp;
being on the high way thought vpon helpe if nede had bene, by such
as had passed to and fro: demaūded fiersely the whishel that she had
euen now of his fellow: why husband quoth she, can you suffer this
wretch to slaunder your wife? auaunt verlet quoth this vpright man
and letes dryue withall his force at this hosteler, and after half a dosen
blowes he stricks his staffe out of his hand, and as this hosteler
stept backe to haue taken vp his staffe agayne: this glymmerynge
Morte flinges a great stone at him and strake him on the head, that
downe he fales with the bloud about his eares, and whyle hée laye
thus amased, the vpright man snatches awaye his pursse, where in
he hadde money of his mistresses, as well as of his owne, and there

let him lye and went away with spede, that they were neuer hearde
of more. When this drye beaten hosteler was come to himselfe hée
fayntly wandereth home, and créepeth into his couche and restes
his ydell head: hys mystres heard that he was come in, and layd him
downe on his bed, repayred straight vnto him, and asked him what
be ayled, and what the cause was of his so sodden lyinge on his bed?
what is the cause q this hostele, your whyshell, your wishell, speaking
the same piteously thrée or foure tymes: why sole quoth his mystres,
take no care for that for I do not greatly way it, it was worth
but thrée shillings four pence. I would it had ben burnt for sour yeeres
agon. I pray thée why so quoth his mystres? I thinke thou arte
mad. Nay not yet quoth this hostler, but I haue ben madly handled:
why, what is the matter q his mystres, and was more desirous to
know the case: and you will forgiue my fellow &amp; mee. I will shewe
you, or els I will neuer do it: she made him presently faythfull promise
that she would, then sayth hée send for your sonne home again,
which is ashamed to looke you in the face. I agree thereto sayth she,
well then quoth this hosteler, your sonne hath geuen the same mort
that begged here, for the burninge of her house, a whishell, and you
haue giuen her fyue shillings in money, and I haue geuen her ten
shillings of myn own: why so quoth shee, then he sadly shewed her
of his mishap, with all the circumstance that you haue hearde before,
and how his purse was taken away, and xv. shillinges in the
same, whereof v. shillings was her money, and x shillings his owne
money. Is this true quoth his mystres? I by my trouth quoth thys
hosteler and nothing gréeues me so much, neyther my beatynge,
neyther the losse of my money, as doth my euill &amp; wretched lucke.
Why, what is the matter quoth his mystres? your sonne sayth this
hostler had some chere and pastime for that whishell, for he lay with
her, and I haue ben well beaten and haue had my pursse taken from
me, and you know your sonne is mery and pleasaunt and can kéepe
no great councell, and then shall I be mocked &amp; laoghed to skorn in
all places, when they shall heare how I haue ben serued. Nowe out
vpon you knaues both, quoth his mystres, and laughes out the matter,
for she well sawe it would not otherwyse preuayle.
            
            
               A Baudy Basket. Cap. 17.
               THese Baudye Basketes bée also women, and goe with baskets
and Capcases on their armes, where in they haue Laces,

pinnes, nedels, whyte inkel, and round sylke gyrdels of all colours.

And for their tryfles they will procure of mayden seruaunts, when
their mistres or dame is out of the ware, eyther some good péece of
béefe, bakē or cheese, that shalbe worth xii. pēce for ii. pence of their
toyes. And as they walke by the way, they often gaine some money
with their instrument, by such as they sodaynly mete withall. The
vpright men haue good acquayntance with these, and wil helpe and
relieue them when they want. Thus they trade their liues in leude
lothsome lechery. Amongst them all is but one honest woman, and
she is of good yeares: her name is Ione Messenger I haue had good
proofe of her, as I haue learned by the true report of diuers.
               There came to my gate the last sommer Anno Domini 1566. a
very miserable man and much deformed as burnt in the face, bler
                     •
                  
eyde, and lame of one of his legges that he went with a crouche. I
asked him wher he was borne &amp; wher he dwelt last, and shewed him
that thither he must repaire and be releued, and not to range about
the countrey, &amp; seeing some cause of charity, I caused him to haue
meate and drink, and when he had dronk, I demaunded of him whether
he was neuer spoyled of the vpright man or roge, yes that I
haue q he, but yet these seuen yeres, for so long haue I gon abroad
I had not so much taken from me nor so euil hādled as I was within
these iiij. dayes why, how 
                     •
                  so q I? in good fayth sir quoth hée, I
chaunced to mete with one of these baudy baskets which had an vpright
man in hir cōpany: and as I would haue passed quietly by her,
man saith she vnto her mate, do you not sée this ilfauored windshaken
knaue? yes q the vpright man, what say you to him, this knaue
oweth me ij. shillings for wares he had of mee halfe a yere a go, I
think it well said this vpright man: syrra saide he, pay your deths,
said this poore man I owe hir none, nether did I euer bargayne wt
her for any thing, and as I am aduised I neuer saw her before in all
my lyfe, mercy god quoth she what a lying knaue is this, and he wil
not pay you husband beat him surely, and the vpright man gaue mee
thre or foure blowes on my back and shoolders and would haue beat
me worse and I had not giuen him all the money in my purse, and
in good faith for very feare I was fayn to giue him xiiij. pens which
was al the money that I had: why said this baudy basket hast thou
no more, then thou owest ten pence styll, and be well assured that
I will be payde the next tyme I meete with thee. And so they let me
passe by them. I pray god saue and blesse me &amp; all others in my case

from such wicked persons quoth this poore mā, why whether went
they, then quoth I, into east Kent, for I met with them on thys side
of Rochester. I haue diuers tymes bene attempted but I neuer lost
much before. I thanke God ther came still company by, afore this
vnhappy time. Well quoth I, thanke God of all, and repaire home
into thy natiue countrey.

               THese Autem Mortes be maried wemen, as there be but a fewe:
For Autem in their language is a Church, so shee is a wyfe maried
at the Church, and they be as chaste as a Cowe: I haue y• gooeth
to Bull euery moone, with what Bull she careth not. These walke
most rymes from their husbands company a moneth and more togither,
being associate with another as honest as her selfe. These will

died either at Newhauen Ireland, or in some seruice of the Prince.
These make laces vpon staues &amp; purses that they cary in their hands
and white vallance for beddes. Many of these hath hadde, and haue
children: when these get ought, either with begging bychery or brybery
as money or apparell, they are quickly shaken out of all by the
vpright men, that they are in a maruelous feare to cary any thing about
them that is of any value. Wherefore, this pollicy they vse,

iiij. or v. shillings, yea x. shillinges left in a place, and the same will
they come for againe within one quarter of a yere or some time not

pollicie: for when they bye them lynnen or garmentes, it is taken away
from them and worse giuen them, or none at all.
               The last Sommer Anno Domini 1566. beinge in familiar talks
with a walkīg Mort, that came to my gate. I learned by hir what I
could, &amp; I thought I had gathered as much for my purpose as I desired,
I began to rebuke her for hir leud life and beastly behauior, declaring
to her what punishment was prepared &amp; heaped vp for her in
the world to come for hit filthy liuing and wretched conuersation.
God helpe q she how should I liue, none will take me into seruice,
but I labour in haruest time honestly. I think bat a whyle with honesty
q I. Shall I tell you q she, the best of vs may bee amended,
but yit I thanke God, I did one good déed within this xii. monthes,
wherin q I. Saith she I would not haue it spoken of again: if it be
méete and necessary, q I, it shall lye vnder my feete: what mean you
by that quoth she. I meane q I, to hide the same and neuer to discouer
it to any. Well q she and began to laugh as much as she could &amp;
sware by the masse that if I disclosed the same to any she would neuer
tell me any thinge. The last sommer q she I was greate wyth
childe and I traueled into east kent by the sea coast, for I lusted maruelously
after oyster and m
                     •
                  skels and gathered many, &amp; in the place
where I found them, I opened them and eate them still, at the laste
in séeking more, I reached after one and stept into a hole and fel in,
into the wast &amp; their did stick, and I had ben drowned if the tide had
come, and espying a man a good way of, I cryed as much as I could
for helpe. I was alone, he hard me and repaired as fast to me as hee
might, and finding me their fast sticking, I required for Gods sake
his helpe, and whether it was with stryuing and forcing my self or
for ioy I had of his comming to me, I had a great colour in my face
and loked red and well coloured. And to be playne with you, hee lyked
me so well (as he said) that I should there lye still, and I would
                     •
                  
not graūt him that she might lye with me. And by my trouth I wist
not what to answere, I was in such a perpleritie, for I knew ye man
well, he had a very honest womā to his wyfe and was of som welth
and on the other syde, if I were not helpe out, I shoulde there haue
perished, and I graunted him that I would obeye to his will, then
be plucked me out. And because there was no conuenient place néer
hand, I required him that I might go washe my selfe and make me

somewhat clenly, and I would come to his house and lodge al night
in his barne, whether he might repayre to me and accomplishe his
desire, but let it not be quoth she before nine of the clocke at nyght,
for then there wilbe small styrring. And I may repayre to the town
q she to warme &amp; drye my self, for this was about two of the clocke
in the after none, do so quoth he, for I must be busie to looke out my
cattell here by before I can come home. So I went away from him
and glad was I, and why so quoth I, because quoth she his wife my
good dame is my very friend, and I am much beholding to hir And
she had donne mee so muche good or this, that I were loth nowe to
harme hir any way. Why so quoth I? what and it had ben any other
man and not your good dames husband. The matter hadd bene the
lesse quoth she. Tell me I pray thee quoth I, who was the father of
the childe, she studied a whyle and sayd that it had a father, but what
was hee quoth I? Nowe by my troth I know not quoth shee, you
bring me out of my matter, so you do, well say on quoth I, then I
departed strayte to the towne and came to my dames house. And
shewed her of my misfortune, also of her husbands vsage in al pointes
and that I showed her the same for good will and bydd her take
better héed to her husband and to her selfe, so shee gaue mee great
thankes and made me good chéere, and byd me in anye case that I
should be redy at the barne at that time and houre we had apointed
for I know well quoth this good wife my husband will not breake
with thée. And one thing I warne thée that thou giue me a watche
word a loude when he goeth about to haue his pleasure of thée, and
that shalbée fye for shame fye, and I will bee harde by you, wyth
helpe. But I charge thee kepe this secret vntill all be finished, and
hold sayth this good wyfe here is one of my pe
                     ••
                  cotes I giue thee.
I thanke you good dame quoth I, and I warrante you I will bee
true and trusty vnto you. So my dame left me sittinge by a good
fyer with meate and drinke, and wyth the oysters I brought wyth
me, I hadde great chéere, she went strayte and repayred vnto her
gossipes dwelling thereby, and as I did after vnderstand, she made
her mone to them, what a naughtye lewed lecherous husband thee
hadde, and how that she could not haue his companye for har
                     •
                  ottes,
and that she was in feare to take some filthy disease of him, he was
so common a man, hauing little respect whom he h
                     •
                  dde to do with
all, and quoth she now here is one at my house a poore woman that
goeth about the countrey that he would haue hadde to doe with all,
wherfore good neighboures and louinge gossypes as you loue mee

and as you would haue helpe at my hand another tyme, deuyse some
remedy to make my husband a good man, y• I may liue in som suerty
without disease, and that hée may saue his soule that God so dearely
bought. After shée had tolde her tale they cast their perstnge eyes all
vpon her, but one stout dame amongst the rest had these wordes: As
your pacient bearing of troubles, your honest behauiour among vs
your neighbours, your tender and pitifull harte to the poore of the
parish, doth moue vs to lament your case, so the vnsatiable carnaliti
of your faithlesse husband doth instigate and styrre vs to deuyse and
inuent some spedy redresse for your case and the amendment of his
lyfe. Wherfore this is my counceld and you wil be aduertised hyme
I say to you all, vnlesse it be this good wyfe, who is chefely touched
in this matter I haue the next cause, for hée was in hande with me
not longe agoe, and company had not ben present whiche was by a
maruelous chaunce, he had (I thinke) forced me. For often he hadde
ben tempting with me, and yet haue I sharpely sayd him nay, therfore
let vs assemble secretly into the place where hée hath appointed
to méete this gyllot that is at your house and lyrke pryuely in some
corner tyll he begin to goe about his busines. And then me thought
I hard you say euen now, that you had a watch word, at which word
we will all stepp forth beinge fiue of vs besides you, for you shalbe
none because it is your husband, but get you to bed at your accustomed
houre, and we will carry eche of vs a good byrchen rod in oure
laps, and we will all be muffeled for knowing, and sée that you goe
home and acquaint that walking mort with the matter forwe must
haue her helpe to hold, for always foure must hold and two lay on.
Alas saith this good wyfe, be is to strong for you al, I would be loth
for my sake you should receiue harme at his hande: feare you not q
these stout wemen, let her not giue the watch word vntill his hosen
be about his legges, and I trow we all wilbe with him to bring before
he shall haue leasuce to plucke them vp agayne: they with one
voyce agréed to yt mattēr that ye way she had deuised was the best: so
this good wife repaired home: but before she departed frō hir gosseps
she shewed thē at what hour they shuld priuely cum in on ye backside
&amp; ther to tary their good hour, so by ye time she cam in, it was almost
night and found the walking morte still sitting by the fier &amp; declared
to her al this new deuise aboue said, which promised faithfullye
to fulfill to her small power as much as they had deuised, within a
quarter of an houre after, in cōmeth ye good man who said yt hee was
about his cartell, why what haue we here wife sitting by the fire, &amp;

if she haue eate and dronk send her into the barne to hir lodging for
this night, for she troubleth the house: euen as you will husbande,
saith his wife, you know she commeth once in two yeres into these
quarters. Away sayth this good wyfe in your lodginge: yes good
dame saith she as fast as I can, thus by loking one on the other eche
knew others mynd, and so departed to her comely couche, the good
man of the house shrodge him for ioy, thinkinge to him selfe I will
make som pastime with you an one. And calling to his wyfe for his
supper set him downe and was very pleasant &amp; dranke to his wife &amp;
fel to his mammerings and moūched a pace, nothing vnderstāding
of the banquet that was a preparing for him after supper, &amp; accordīg
to the prouerbe (that swéet meat will haue sowre sauce,)
                     •
                   thus when
he was well refreshed, his spirites being reuiued entred into familiar
talk with his wyfe, of many matters how well he had spent that
day to both their profytes, saying some of his cattell were lyke to
haue bin drowned in the diches, dryuing others of his neighboures
cattel out that were in his pasturs, &amp; mending his fences that were
broken down. Thus profitably he had consumed the daye, nothinge
talking of his helping out of the walking mort out of the mier, neither
of his request nor yit of hir promise. Thus feding hir wt frendly
fantasies consumed two houres and more. Then fayning howe hes
would sée in what case his horse were in and how they were dressed,
repaired couertly into the barne whereas his friendly foes lyrked
priuely vnlesse it were this manerly Morte, that comly couched on a
bottell of straw. What are you come q she, by ye masse I would not
for a hundreth pound that my dame should know that you wer here
either any els of your house. No I warrant thée saith this good man,
they be all safe and fast inough at their work, and I will be at myne
anon And lay downe by her and straight would haue had to do with
her, nay fye saith she, I like not this order, if ye lye with me you shal
surely vntxusse you &amp; put down your hosen for that way is most easiest
and best, saiest thou so quoth he, now my troth agréed: and whē
he had vntrussed himself and put down, he began to assalt the vnsatiable
sort, why quoth she that was without shame, sauinge for her
promes, and are you not ashamed? neuer a whyt sayth he, lye downe
quickely, nowe fye for shame, fye sayth shée aloude (which was the
watch word) At the which word these fyue furious sturdy muffeled
gossips flynges out and takes sure holde of this betrayed person,
sone plucking his hosen down lower, and bindinge the same fast about
his féete, then binding his handes and knittinge a hande char
                  
                     •
                  her

about his eyes, that hée should not sée, and when they had made
him sure and fast, then they layd him on vntill they were windles:
be good saith this Morte vnto my mayster for the passion of God, &amp;
layd on as fast as the rest, and still ceased not to crye vpon them too
be mercyfull vnto him, and yet layd on a pace, and when they hadde
well beaten him that the bloud braste plentifully out in most places
they let him lye still bounde, with this exhortation, that he shoulde
from that tyme foorth knowe his wyfe from other mens, and that
this punishment was but a flebyting in respect of that which should
follow, if he amended not his manners. Thus leauing him blustering,
blowing and foming for payne and malencolye, that hée neyther
might or could be reuenged of them: they vanished awaye and
had this morte with them, a
                     •
                  d safely conuayd her out of the towne:
soone after commeth into the barne one of the good mans boyes to
set some haye for his horse. And fynding his maister lying fast boūd
and gr
                     •
                  euously beaten with roddes, was sodainly abashed and wold
haue runne out agayne to haue called for helpe, but his maister hyd
him come vnto him and vnbinde him, and make no woordes quoth
he of this. I wilbe reuenged well ynough, yet notwithstandinge after
better aduyse, the matter being vnhonest, he thought it méeter
to let the same passe, and not as the prouerbe sayth (to awake the
sléeping dogge.) And by my troth quoth this walking morte, I com
now from that place and w is neuer there sythens this parte was
playd, which is somewhat more then a yeare. And I heare a verye
good report of him now, that he loueth his l
                     •
                  yfe well and vseth hym
selfe very honestly: and was not this a good acte, now how say you?
It was pretely handeled quoth I, and is here all? yea quoth shee,
here is the end.

And afterward she is common and indifferent for any that will vse
her, as homo
                     •
                   is a commō name to al men. Such as be fayre and somwhat
handsome, kepe company with the walking Mortes, and are
redy always for the vpright men, and are chiefly maynteined by
them, for others shalbe spoiled for their sakes, the other interior sort
will resorte to noble mens places, and gentlemens houses standing
at the gate, eyther lurking on the backsyde about backe houses, eyther
in hedge rowes or some other thycket, expectynge their praye,

which is for the vncomly company of some courteous gest of whom
they be refreshed with meate and some money, where eschaunge is
made ware for ware: this bread and meate they vse to carye in their
great hosen, so that these beastly brybinge bréeches, serue many tymes
for bandy purposes. I chaunced not long sitbens familiarly to
common with a Dore that came to my gate, and surely a pleasaunt
harlot, and not so pleasant as witty, and not so witty as boyde of all
grace and goodnes I found by her talk that she had passed her tyme
lewdly eightene yeares in walking about. I thought this a necessary
instrument to attayne some knowledge by, and before I woulde
grope hir mind, I made her both to eate and drynk well, that done
I made her faithfull promise to gyue her some money if she woulde
open and discouer to me such questions as I would demaund of hir
and neuer to bewraye hir, neyther to disclose her name. And you
should sayth shee I were vndone: feare not that quoth I. but I pray
thée quoth I, say nothing but truth. I will not sayth shee, then firsts
tell me quoth I, how many vpright men and roges dost thou know
or hast thou knowne and bene 
                     •
                  dnuersant with, and what their names
be? she paused a while and sayd, why do you aske me, or wherefore?
For nothing els as I sayd, but that I would knowe them whē
they come to my gate. Now by my troth (quoth she) then are yes neuer
the nearer, for al myne acquaintance for the most part are dead,
Dead quoth I? how dyed they for want of cherishing or of paynfull
diseases? Then she sighed and sayde they were hanged. What all
quoth I, and so many walke abroad as I dayly sée? By my trouth
quoth she I know not paste six or seuen by their names, and named
the same to mee. When were they hanged quoth I? Some seuen
yeares agone, some three yeares, and some with in this fortnight,
and declared the place where they weare erecuted, which I knewe
well to be true, by report of others. Why (quoth I) dyd not this
sorrowfull and fearefull sight much gréeue thee, and for thy tyme
long and euill spent. I was sory quoth shee, by the masse, for some of
them were good louing men, for I lacke not when they had it, and
they wanted not when I had it, and diuers of them I neuer did forsake,
vntill the Gallowes departed vs. O mercyfull God quoth I,
and began to blesse me. Why blesse ye quoth she? Alas good genttleman,
euery one must haue a liuing. Other matters I talked of,
but this now may suffice to shewe the reader as it were in a glasse
the bolde beastely lyfe of these Doxes. For suche as hath gonne any
tyme abroade, will neuer forsake their trade, to dye therefore.

of seruice, eyther she is naturally borne one, and then she is a wyld
Dell: these are broken very yonge, when they haue ben lyen withall

wylde Dels being traded vp with their monstrous mothers, musts

               Their vsage in the night. Cap. 24.
               NOw, I think it not vnnecessary to make the Reader vnderstand
how and in what maner they lodge a nights in barnes or back-houses,
and of their vsage there, for asmuch as I haue acquaynted
them with their order and practises a day tymes. The arch and chief
walkers that hath walked a long tyme, whose experience is great,
because of their continuing practise, I meane all Mortes &amp; Doxes,

for their handsomnes &amp; diligence, for making of their couches. The
men neuer trouble themselues with that thing, but takes the same
to be the duty of the wyfe. And she shuffels vp a quantitie of strawe
or hay, into some prety corner of the barne where she may conueniently
lye, and well shaketh the same, making the heade some what
bye, and dryues the same vpon the sydes and set lyke a bed: then she
layeth her wallet or other little pack of ragges, or scryppe vnder hir
head in the strawe, to beare vp the same, and layeth her peticote or
cloke vpon and ouer the strawe, so made lyke a bedde and that serueth
for the blanket: then she layeth her slate which is her shéete vppon
that, and shée haue no shéete, as fewe of them go without, then
she spreddeth some large cloutes or rags ouer the same, and maketh
hir ready and layeth her drousely downe. Many will plucke of their
smockes and lay the same vpon them in stéede of their vpper shéete,
and all her other pelte and trashe vpon her also, and many lyeth in
their smockes. And if the rest of her clothes in cold weather bee not
sufficient to kéepe her warme, then the taketh strawe or hay to performe
the matter. The other sorte that haue no slates, but toumble
down and couche a hogshead in their clothes, these be still lou

shall neuer be without vermin, vnlesse they put of their clothes, and
lye as is aboue said. If the vpright man come in where they lye, hee
hath his choyse, and créepeth in close by his Dore, the roge hath his
leauings. If the Mortes or Dores lye or be lodged in some Farmers
barne, and the dore be eyther locked or made fast to them, then will
not the vpright man presse to come in, vnles it be in barnes and out
houses standing alone, or some distance from houses, which

away with the same with great selerity, and maketh port sale

morning, for wante of their Casters and Togemans. Where in
stede of blessing is cursinge, in place of praying, pestilent pratinge
