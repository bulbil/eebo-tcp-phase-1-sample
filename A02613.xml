            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            To the moste noble, most excellent, and mooste vertuous Lady Elizabeth. Quene of Englande, Fraunce, and Irelande, defender of the faith. &amp;c. Thomas Paynel wisheth all felicity.
            
               ALthough youre gracious life to all mens iudgementes, is so cleane and pure that it neade no maner of incitatyon or ensample of vertue to vertuous &amp; charitable liuinge: yet when I bethought me how corrupt, how caduke, how bryttle, and howe sliding from vertue

to vice, mans nature is euen from the beginning, &amp; with how diuers and manifold instigations the concupiscences and lustes of this deceitfull worlde doth embrace and intangle mā with all, and that our aduersary the deuill is moste vigilante and diligente daily to deuoure the soul of manne, and to alure him to his waies and tradityons:

                were but lost labor, but exhort your grace to the continuance of your godly and vertuous liuing, and iudged my sel
                  •
                vnblameable, if I in this tempes
                  •
               ious and blustryng time shuld send your grace, as it were an anker, or a staffe to stay you by, and fermely to stablyshe

your grace, least that your grace should (that God forbid) wauer or slide from the Catholike and true faith of God, from his true and liuelye worde, or from the trace of your charitable and vertuous liuinge. For who is sure to stand fast, and not to fal? Paule saith. Let him that standeth take heede he fall not. Or who can say, I am without syn, or my harte is cleane? What is more surer then to auoide thys fall, than to leane to thinfallible and mighty word of God, than to ensue the life of Christ our sauior &amp; and redeamer, and the ensamples and vndoubted hystories, gathered out of holy scripture, &amp; by me your highnes most hable &amp; obedient subiect trāslated for the vtilitye &amp; consolation of the vnlearned into english: this

is doubtlesse a verye profitable colection, and the anker &amp; staffe that I spake of, containing most compendiously the wonderfull miracles, the noble historyes, the worthy actes, the wise sayinges, the politike stratagemes the wicked cōspiracies, the due obedience, faith and fidelitye of a christian, with other innumerable and meruelous thynges, and ye parables of all scripture. Rede it therfore most gratious Ladye, and take good holde at the godlye ensamples and doctrines there of, for in so doing, youre grace shall not neade to slide from the faithe of Christe, nor yet from the trace of youre godlye and vertuous life, but shall stand as Christes souldier against sathan, the worlde, and

the flesh to your eternal felicity and comfort most victoriously. For where there is no pain nor battaile, there can be no victory nor no triumphe. For Sayncte Paule saithe,
                  Act. 14. that we throughe muche tribulation and payne, must enter into the kingdom of God. And again he saithe,2. Cor. 4 that this our tribulation and aduersity which is momentanye and light, prepareth an exceadynge and an eternall waight of glory vnto vs: yea and that a crowne of righteousnesse is laide vp for all those that suffer tribulation and aduersity,
                  1. Timo. 4. and haue fought a good fyghte, and haue kepte their faith, the which our Lord that is a righteous iudge shall geue vnto all theym that loue his comming. And for as much

as this our slidinge life, is as it were but a warfare and a continual battail against our ghostly enemi the deuil, fight ye must yea and that earnestly and continually euen to the latter end, for so your grace shal ouerturne sathan your enemye moste victoriouslye, and be crowned with the crowne of eternal ioy and felicity.

               THou shalt shewe thy sonne in that daye, saying.
                  Deute. 12. Thys is that which our Lord did vnto me, when I came oute of Egipt. And it shall be as a signe vnto thee vpon thine hād, and for a remēbraunce before thine eyes, that our Lordes law may be alwayes in thy mouthe. For in a strong hand our lord brought thee out of Egipt.
            Ye shall not do that, that semeth good in your owne eyes,
                  Deute. 13. but that I commaund you, that do you only vnto our lorde, nor thou shalt put nought thereto, nor take ought there from.
            
               Thou shalt read thys
                  •
                lawe before al Israell in their eares.
                  Deute. 31 Gather the people together, men, women, and chyldren, and the stranger that is within thy gates, that they may heare and learne, and fear our Lord your God. And kepe and obserue all the wordes of thys law.
            Let not the boke of this law depart oute of thy mouthe, but record therin day and nyghte, that thou maist obserue and do according to al that is wrytten therin, for then thou shalt make thy waye prosperous, and then shalte thou doe wiselye.
                  Iosu. 1. Thou shalt not decline from the wordes of thys law neyther to the ryght hand, nor to the left, that thou maist do al thinge wiselye that thou takest in hand.
            
               All the wordes of God are pure and clean, for he is a shield vnto all them,
                  Prouer. 30. that putte theyr trust in him. Put thou nothyng vnto hys wordes, leaste he reproue thee, and thou be found a lier.
            Crye nowe as loud as thou canste, leaue not of, lyfte vp thy voyce lyke a trompet, and shew my people theyr offences,
                  Esay. 58 and the house of Iacob their sinnes.
            Wo be vnto those folish prophets that followe theyr owne spirite,
                  Ezech. 13 and speake where they se nothing.
            Searche the scriptures,
                  Iohn. 5. for they are they, whych testifye of me.
            What so euer thynges are wrytten,1. Mat. 15. they are wrytten for our learning, that we thorowe

pacyente and comforte of the scriptures, might haue hope.
            
               2. Timo. 4.Al scripture geuen by inspiration of God, is profytable to teache, to improue, to amende, and to instruct in rightwisenes that the man of God maye be perfecte and prepared vnto al good workes.

               THe creatyon of thynges was so meruelous, that the knowledge thereof coulde not come to man, but by reuelation. For after the minde of S. Gregory,
                  Greg. super zac. homeli. 1. Moses prophecied of those thinges that wer past, saying. In the beginninge God created heauen and earth.
                  Genesis. 1. Nor that, because he forspoke the thinges that were to come, but because he disclosed those thinges that were seacreat.

            Our Lord repressed the presumpteousnesse of men,
                  Gene. 11. that would builde

a tower vnto heauen: confoundinge their language.

                  Exodus. 14It was a terrible, and a Myracle worthye to be spoken of, that the red sea was deuided, and so dried vp, that the children of Israel went ouer drye footed, and the Egyptyans ouerwhelmed in the myddest of the sluds.

                  Deute. 26. and theyr clothes waxed not old, nor their shoes were not consumed vpon their fete.

            In the daies and time of Antiochus Epiphanius,1. Macha. 6 the which destroyed the Temple, and made it Prophane, did cruelly handle many of ye Iewes, and slue them. It mighte apeare and seme to manye, that the whole world was in a confusion, and euil ordained and ruled. But for all that our Lorde out of those euils, could bring the punishmente of the wicked, and the corruption of certain other. And againe the vertue and merites of manye of those that were slaine, were diuersly increased.

            Our Lord did miracles in Chorasin and Bethsaida,

Let vs go, that we may dye with him, doubted of our Lordes resurrection, whereof it came that Peter was the more meke and gentle to sinners, and that the faithfull, and they that stackard in the faithe, were the better stablished there in. And of this it is gathered, that no manne should presume vpon his stedfastnes. And that no man, whether he be fallen from his faith, or doubteth therin should despair of the mercye, or of the forgeuenesse of God. And by this that Iudas the Apostle and dispensator of God did slide into suche an eanorme

crime, nor rose not againe, al presūpteous security is deminished and broken: by the whiche no manne for the state &amp; condition that he is in, nor for the dedes that he hath done oughte to be hie mineded, but in fear. For why the Apostles wer the faithful leaders of the people, and yet they were kept in prysonne wythal diligence.
            It might seme to such as be weake, that God shuld not haue suffred such thinges to haue bene done in the beginning of the faith.

                  •
               t semed to be a great detriment or hinderāce to ye honour of the christiane religion. But the Discyples that were scattered abroade dyd so preache and sette forthe the worde of God, that the Churche there by was a greate deale the more enlarged.
            
               
                  Actes. 13.For as much as the Iewes, when Paule and Barnabas preached the woorde of God vnto them, refused it, and put it from them, they tooke an occasyon to preache vnto the Gentyles.
            There was a dissentyon betwene Paule and Barnabas for Ihō whose sirname was Marke, whome Paule woulde not receyue, because he wente

from thē, but Barnabas toke Marke wyth hym,
                  Actes. 15. and so they departed a sunder one from the other. Where by shoulde haue folowed, as it was thoughte, some greate rebuke and shame. But God disposing the matter, there ensued greate frute and profite. For the worde of God was opened &amp; preached to manye.
            They committed a verye haynous deede and faute, that putte that excellente doctoure Paule in prison, cō
               pellynge hym to cease from Preachinge, the whyche thynge myghte seme to many, a great inconuenience, and that God should not haue suffred it.
            And yet it is to bee greatly noted, that the deuine prouidence by suche impedimentes and losses, hath shewed and caused greate frute and profyte.
            For as the merites of Paul did therby increase, so likewise he left the mo examples of vertue, and taughte muche better by his woorkes, then before

time by his wordes. For beynge in prison, he wrote to those that were absent and in farre countries, nether was he so profitable vnto the church by his preachinge, as he was by sending of his Epistles. And therefore if he in any one city or prouince had ben honoured of all men, and gladly hardt he should not yet haue had such occasions to haue gone and visited so diuers and many nations as he visited. Therfore when that the Iewes, or any other did persecute him frō towne to towne, he preached the woorde of God to manye. And when he was in hold, he wrote his Epistles, and when the Iewes resisted him,
                  Actes. 13. he turned him self to the gentiles.
            And againe, because that in Syria, he founde Festus and Felix vnrightfull Iudges,
                  Actes. 25. hee was enforced to appeale to Cesar, and so hee came to Rome, and throughe his predication and doctrine was greatly illustred, and luckelye by hys passion made mooste famous.
         
         
            
            ¶Of the benignitie of God to hys seruauntes. ¶The third Chapter.

            Our Lord moste gentlye appeared vnto Iacob flying and eschuynge hys brothers anger,
                  Gene. 31. and deliuered hym from his father in lawes insecution, returning again to his brother.
            Iacob vsed a greate audacitye and bouldnes in his prayer to our Lorde,
                  Gene. 38. saying. I wyl not let thee go, excepte thou blesse me.
            And oure Lorde saide vnto Moses, I haue seene this people,
                  Exodus. 32. and behold, it is a stiffe necked people: suffer me,

that my wrath may wax hot against them. As thoughe he wold saye: thou holdest me, nor I cannot consume these wicked sinners, excepte thou let me go.
            And our Lord spake vnto Moses, as a man speaketh to his frende,
                  Exodus. 33. and did defend him from his enemies and detractours.

            This was to be maruailed at, that oure LORDE, when he hym selfe was abiected and refused,2. regum. 7. disdayned not there at, but in the contempte of the seruauntes of GOD, he estemed him self to be contemned. As it is manifest and plaine in Samuel.1. regum. 8.

            The Bethsames lifted vp their eyes, and spyed the Arke and reioysed,1. regu. 6. and offered a burnt offering vnto our Lord. And although they semed to do a good worke, yet oure Lorde plaged them with a greate plague, because they had seene the Arke, the whiche they should not haue seene.

            Notwythstandynge it is a verye good thinge to offre incence vnto our Lorde,2. para. 16. yet it pertayneth notte to euery man to doe the same. For Ozias the kynge of Iuda was smytten with ye leper, because he would burne insence vppon the aulter of insence.

                  Esa. 1. that he hym selfe dyd institute to be offerde, and that, because of the wickednesse of those that offerde. Why offer ye so manye sacryfyces vnto me, sayeth our Lord? Then there foloweth. Your handes are full of bloude.
            Oure Lorde preferd the offering of the widdowe which cast two mites in to the treasury,

            Our Lord Iesus walkynge on the sea, commaunded Peter to come vnto him.

            Our Lorde was tempted by the deuil, that he shuld cast hym self downe headlyng from the pinacle of the temple.
                  Mat. 4. But he saide to him:

            ABraham most humbly, discretelye,
                  Gen. 18. constantly and mekely dyd

praye oure Lorde, to spare the Sodomites.
            At some tyme we must praye oure Lord for such thinges,
                  Gen. 25. as he hath purposed to doe. As Isaac made intercession vnto our Lorde for his wife, because she was barren. And yet oure Lorde purposed that she should conceaue and bring forth chyldren.
            It is greatlye to be thought vpon. How thankeful,
                  Gen. 32. how lowly, and how importune that Iacobbe was in hys prayer, saying, Lord I am not worthy of the least of all thy mercies. And afterwardes how he sequestrated him selfe from his wiues and all his familye, and remayned there alone in the nyghte.
            Moyses prayde our Lorde oftentymes,
                  Exo. 7.8.9.10. that he would remoue the plagues from Egipt, and was heard, notwithstāding that the people wer euil.
            Moyses in the warre that the chyldren of Israel made against Amelech,
                  Exo. 17. dydde more by prayer, than Iosua by fyghtynge.
            The onelye prayer of the mynde

doth cry and ascende vnto God, as it well appeareth when our LORD saide vnto Moses that spake nothyng vnto him,
                  Exo. 14. wherefore cryest thou vnto me.
            After the adoration made vnto the caulfe.
                  Exo. 32. Oure Lorde as it appeared, would haue vtterly destroied the people, but Moses by reason of instante prayer abtained theyr pardone. But yet note, the manner of hys praying, ether (quoth he) forgeue them theyr sinne: or wipe me out of thy booke.

            THe obseruation of the Saboth had his originall beginning of that,
                  Gen. 2. that is saide and wrytten in Genesis. God blesseth the seuenth daye, and sanctified it, because that in it, he reasted from al his worke.
            And the children of Israel gathered in the wyldernesse on the .vi. daye a double quantitye of Manna.
                  Exo. 16. Because that on the Sabboth they should reast from all worke.
            And amonge all the ten commaundementes,
                  Exo. 20. there is only a reason geuen of thobseruay
                  •
               on of the Saboth, because that amonge carnall men, it semed to haue lytle reason. And thys precept is very often times founde in the law, to thintent that man should diligentlye obserue and keepe it, and laboure to get and obtayne the true reast.
            And on the Sabboth day ther wer offred two lambes,
                  Nume. 28. and vppon other

daies but one except in solempne feastes &amp; kalendes. And that, to declare, yt in festiual daies men shuld honor god more reuerently and aboundauntlye then other daies.
            The man that was takē gathering of stickes vpon the Saboth day,
                  Nume. 15. was by Goddes commaundemente stoned with stones of all the people.
            Nehemias saw some treading wine presses,2. Esd. 13. and bringing of burthens to be solde vpon the Saboth day, and he rebuked them as breakers of the Sabothe.
            The gentiles which held with Antiochus appoynted to fighte vpon the Sabboth daies against certen Iewes that were fled out of Iewry,1. mach. 2. but they casted not one stone at thē, nor made faste theyr preuy places: but said, we will die all in oure innocencye. But yet it is to be obserued and noted, that notwythstandynge that in thys thing they shewed a Deuotyon towardes Goddes commaundemente, yet inas much as they perceiued afterwardes that therby Gods people myghte

be scattered and loste, they toke better counsel: sayinge. What soeuer he be that cometh to make battell wyth vs vpon the saboth day, we wil fight against him, for why to fighte for the defēce of mans life, or for the lawe of God, is no seruile worke or labour.
            Iudas Machaheus &amp; his companye fought against Nicanor &amp; his hoste,1. mach. 7. &amp; slue 5000. men, &amp; put the rest to flit

                  Luke. 12. to saue ones lyfe, or to destroy it. The thyrde that he myghte edifye and profet all that sawe hym and hard him.
            When Christe had healed the woman which was bowed together, the ruler of the Sinagoge disdayned,
                  Luc. 13. because that he had healed on the Sabbothe daye, and saide. There are syxe daies, in which men ought to worke, in them come that ye maye be healed and not on the Sabboth day. But the Lord answered hym, and said. Thou hipocrite, doth not eche one of you on the Sabboth day lose his Oxe or hys Alfe from the stal, and lead him to the

water? And ought not this doughter of Abraham, whome Sathan hathe bound, lo 18. yeares, be loosed frō this bonde on the Sabboth day? And when he thus sayd, all his aduersaries were ashamed, &amp; all the people reioysed on all the excellent deedes that wer done by him.
            The holy women which had prepared swete odours,
                  Luke. 23. to anoynt our lords body, kept the sabboth day so strictly, that on that they would not anoynte so precious and holy a bodye. So they rested the Sabboth daye, according to the commaundement.

            ¶Of euill Spirites. Ca. xxxii.
            
               EUil spirites are sayd to be oure Lords,1. regu. 16. because they are in gods power, and what so euer they do, they do it by God. The euil spirit of God vexed Saule.
            The deuyll killed Saras Raguels daughter vii. husbandes,
                  Tobi. 3.8. but yet by the comming of Raphael the good angel was eiected.
            Sathan had euen so muche power vpon Iobs cattell his house wherein his children did eat,
                  Iob. 1.2. and vpon his body, how much the deuine prouydence did suffer him to haue.
            The euil sprite made the mā fearce and cruel.
                  Mat. 8. And also he maketh a man vncleane, for those ii. demoniakes, or possessed with deuils wer out of measure fearce,
                  Luke. 8. &amp; dwelt &amp; laye in graues. And the deuils desired to goe into the swine, not into Lambs. One of those ii. was more famous then thother, he ware no clothes: he abode in no hous but in graues, he was bounde wyth chaines, &amp; kepte wyth fetters, and he brake the bandes, and was caryed of the fende into wildernesse.
            
               This euel sprite maketh a manne bothe deafe and domme,
                  Mar. 7. and when the spirite taketh hym, he knocketh and teareth him and he fometh and gnasheth with his tethe &amp; pineth away,
                  LuKe. 9.
               
                  Mar. 9. &amp; often times he casteth him into fire &amp; water, to destroy and lose him.
            Oure Lorde refused the laude and praise of maligne spirites.
                  LuKe. 8. Holde thy peace (quod he) &amp; come out of the mā.
                  Mar. 1.
            
            Our Lord dyd forbid his discyples to reioyce that the euill spirites were vnder them,
                  Luke. 10. and subdued vnto them, as though they shuld not esteme that thing very greatly.
            A certaine damsel possessed wyth a sprite ye prophesied,
                  Act. 19. cryed out many a day after Paule &amp; hys fellowes. But Paule being heuy therfore, turned about and said to the sprite, I commād the in the name &amp; vertue of Iesu christ yt thou come oute of her, and he came out the same hour. And note yt Paule would not that the doctrine of truthe shuld be confirmed by the spirit of deceitfulnesse and falshode.
            Certain of the Iewes toke vpon thē to cal ouer thē, which had euil sprites

the name of our Lord Iesus, sayinge, 
                  Act. 19.we adiure you by Iesu whome Paule preacheth. And the euyl spryte answered and said, Iesus I know, and Paul I know: but who are ye? and the man in whome the euyll spryte was, ran on them, and ouercame them, and preuailed againste them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded
         
         
            ¶Of the immortality of the resonable soule. Ca. xxxiii.
            FOr as much as it is saide of Abraham, that he was put to his people,
                  Gen. 25. it is supposed that he had people in a nother world, that is, men, which liued wel as he dyd.
            We haue the lyke saying of Isaac. He was put vnto hys people.
                  Gen. 35.49. And of Iacob.
            And when Iacob beleued that hys sonne Ioseph was deade,
                  Gen. 37. he sayde, I wil go downe into hel vnto my sonne mourninge. So then, he beleued that he was there in spryte.
            Iosephes brethren hauynge in wil and mynde to saye, that one of theyr

brethren was deade, said. We are xii. brethren,
                  Gen. 42. the sonnes of one man, the yongest is with oure father, and one no man wotteth wher he is.
            Our lord appearing vnto Moses in a bush,
                  Exo. 3. sayd, I am the God of Abrahā Isaac, and Iacob. &amp;c. by thys our sauiour proueth the resurrectyon of the dead.
                  Mat. 22. He is not a God of the dead saith he, but of the liuyng.
            It is sayd of Chore and hys companye, that they wente down alyue into hell,
                  Nume. 16. and the earth closed vpon them, and they pearyshed from amonge the congregation. By thys it appeareth that the euil, as touchyng theyr soules do lyue in hel.
            If Saule had surelye beleued that Samuel had bene extincte and deade as touchyng hys soule,1. regu. 28. he woulde not haue desyred hym to haue bene reuyued and called againe.
            When that Dauids seruauntes, maruailed why he wepte not for hys yonge sonne that was dead, he said, I shal go to him rather thē he shal come again to me.
            
               When that Dauids seruaunts, meruailed why he wept not for his yong sonne that was dead,2. regu. 12. he said, I shall go to him, rather then he shall come againe to me.
            When Absolon was hanged, and thrust thorowe with iii. speares,2. regu. 18 Dauid be wailed &amp; lamented him mournfully. And s. Augustine in his boke de doc. chri. sayth. That Dauid bewaild not the lack and deathe of hys sonne. But because he knew to what pains that adoulterous and Paracide soule shoulde be drawen vnto. But for his other sonne that died an Innocente, and for whose sicknesse hee was sore afflicted,2. regu. 12. he reioysed.
            
               3. regu. 17.Helias praid for the reuiuification of hys hostes chylde, saying. O Lord my God, let thys childes soule come into hym againe.
            Oftentimes we read in the bookes of the kynges,3. regu. 14. he was layde a sleape wyth hys fathers. The whiche thing by no meanes maye be vnderstanded or spoken of brute beastes:4. regu. 13. and therefore ther by it is proued that they liue

after theyr death, and that here after they shal arise again, as it appeareth in those that slepe.
            It is manifest and open by Thobias wordes which he spake rebuking the folishnesse of his kinsfolkes, that the soule liueth after that it is seperated from the body.
                  Tobi. 2. We are, saythe Toby, the children of holy men, and loke for the life, which God shal geue vnto them that neuer tourne their be lefe from him. And afterwardes in his oration and prayer he saithe.
                  Tobi. 3. O Lord, deale not wyth me accordynge to thy wil, and commaund my sprite to be receiued in peace.
            Our Lord gaue Iob double of al ye euer was his.
                  Tobi. 42. And at length he gaue him vii. sonnes, and iii. doughters.
            The preacher (after the mynd of s.
                  Eccle. 11. Gregory in the laste of his Morales) spake expresly and plainly, sayinge. Let the dust be tourned agayne vnto earthe, from whence it came, and the spryte shall retourne vnto God, whiche gaue it.
            By those woordes that the dampned do saye in hell, they declare and

And many mo thinges ar wrytten there, by the whyche it is euidente that he pearished not vtterly, but that his soule went downe into hel.

            That thing which our Lord dothe shew of the rych man and Lazarus semeth to be no parable or symilitude,
                  Luke. 16. but a manifest hystorye. And so it appeareth that the soules bothe of the good and euyll be immortall, and receyue after the separatyon from the bodye, euen as they deserued beynge in the body.
            Our Lorde by the ensample of the vniust steward that made hym frendes wyth hys masters goodes,

The which saying was of none effect, if the soule after the seperation from the body, or after the death of ye body, had no receptacle or place to be receiued vnto.
            Blessed saint Steuen had a deuout and a right opinion and faithe of the soule,
                  Act. 7. the whyche when they stoned him, saide, Lorde Iesu, receyue my spryte.

            And the selfe same man saythe. O wretched man that I am, who shall

deliuer me from this bodye subdued vnto death?

                  Act. 20. These handes haue ministred vnto my necessities, &amp; to them that were wyth me. For it is more blessed to geue, then to receiue: and al though it was a worke of supererogation, considring he might haue receiued somwhat of them, yet he did it

to spare those he preached vnto. I am ready saith he,2. Corin. 12 to come vnto you, and yet wil I not be chargeable vnto you for I seke not yours, but you. Secondarely he toke nothynge, that he myght cut of from the Pseudapostles the occasion of gloryfying. In all things I kept my self so that I should not be chargeable to any man,2. Cor. 11. and so wyl I kepe my self. What I do, that wyll I do, to cut away occasyon from them, which desire occasiō, that they might be found lyke vnto vs, in that wherin they reioyse. And again he procured that thereby he shoulde haue the greater rewarde. We haue not vsed thys power to receiue any reward of you.1. Cor. 9. What is my reward then. Uerely that when I preach the Gospell, I make the Gospel of Christ fre. Paule procured also of the congregatyon of Achaia, to dystrybute &amp; geue to the pore that were in Iewry, and therefore he caused collectyons,1. Cor. 16. 2.

            Furthermore Paule euen wyth hys owne body did meruelous thynges to conuert hys neighbours to the faith and to spiritual health by preaching, disputing, and iournyinge frō Damasco to Arabia and Ierusalem, and to Antioche. And then by the cō
               maundement of the holy ghost, wyth Barnabas he wente from Antioche to Cipers, and from thence they sayled by Cicill, and came to Persida. Iconium, Lycaoniam, and ordeyned prestes and elders in euerye congregation. And after that they had done muche good, they retourned to Antioche. Afterwardes Paule purposing to visite his brethren vnto whom he

had preached the word of god, he toke Sila with him, and went to Siria &amp; Cilicia, and from thence to Phrygia and Galatia, and came to Mysia, and after that beinge called, he sailed into Macedonia. And when he had done muche good at Thessalonia, and in many other cities of that regyon, he went to Athens, and ther he disputed with certayn curious Philosophers. And from thence he wente to Corinthum, and there he conuerted muche people to our Lord. And then he toke his iourny to Ephesus, and entred in to the sinagoge and dysputed wyth the Iewes. And from thence he went to Cesaria,
                  Act. xvii.
                and from Cesaria he cam to Antioche, and after hee had taryed there a certaine time, he tooke hys iourny towardes the country of Galatia and Phrigia, and confirmed &amp; stablished al the disciples. And when he had wandred ouer all the hye partes of the country, he came agayne to Ephesus, and taried there two yere, disputing of the kingdome of God, &amp; did so much, that all they that dwelte

in Asia both heathen and Iewes dyd heare the worde of God. From thēce he returned by Macedonia, Troyade and Miletum, &amp; passing by manye other cities and Iles, he came to Tire and from Tire he toke his iorney by Ptolomaidem, and Cesaria, &amp; came from thence to Ierusalem. And there the Iewes toke hym, drew hym, bet him, and falsly accused him, before diuers iudges, and manifestlye greued, was constraind to appele vnto Cesar He was deliuered vnto the captain, &amp; after the shyppe was broken, &amp; many other pearyls, he being boūd wt chaines, came to Rome, &amp; ther beyng geuen to preaching and teachynge, purposed to go into Spain. Behold now how he loued those, for whose sakes he suffred such and so manye paynes and pearils. And Paule sayth, we do all thynges dearly beloued for your edifying.

                  Eccle. 12 sustain and bear it.
            Out of these forsaide wordes, it is open, that Paule suffred wonderfull thinges for his neyghboures profits.2. Timo. 2. I suffer (saith Paule) all thynges for the electes sakes, that they mighte also obtayne saluatyon. Of thys loke in the title of tribulation, for there thou shalt fynde manye thynges as touchyng thys matter.
            It appeareth by S. Ihons wordes, that he had greate loue to his neyghboures. For his mouthe spake, of the haboundance of hys hart, when that he so often repeated charitye, as it apeareth in hys fyrst Epystle. Capit. iii.iiii.

            Likewise in dedes he hathe suffred greuous iniuries, for as he was preching, all they in the Sinagoge were

filled with wrath, and thrusting him out of the city,
                  Luke. 4. they would haue caste him downe headling from the toppe of the mountaine.

Iohn saith,
                  Iohn. 19. And Iesus in the middes.
            Forthermore we must way &amp; ponder, that he was afflicted and punyshed in all the members and sences of his body. His eies behelde and sawe those cruell tormentors. And also his mooste mekest mother the whiche in soule was crucified, &amp; his derely beloued disciple, and the deuoute wemen that in minde suffered with him. His eares did heare blasphemouse, mocking, iniurious, and dispising wordes. Likewyse hys nose, by reason of the place in the whiche he was crucified, where the misdoers were beheaded, might with filthy slenche be offēded. His tast was noied because they gaue him wine mingled with myrre, or vineger with gall to quenche his thurst withall, wherby we may well vnderstand, that the drinke which thei gaue him was very bitter. His sense of feeling or touching sprede thorowout all his body, felte paine in his members which wer scourged, &amp; in his handes and feete. Which were borde thorow with nayles.
            
               It may be likewise cōsidered,
                  Iohn. 19. that he sustained losse in things longing and pertayning to his bodye. For he was spoyled of hys raiment: &amp; his frendes went from him.
                  Mar. 14. For his disciples for soke him, &amp; ran awaye. Thus he was afflicted, as it is sayed in all partes of his body, by his most bytter passion:
            Also in hart and minde he suffered, for he was sorye for his frendes that stode by: and for his enemies that ignorauntly did crucify him.
            And againe in a maner he sufferd &amp; was hurte in his good name &amp; fame.
                  Mat. 27. For they called him a seductor of the people. Sir sayd the chefe of ye priestes to Pilate, we remēber yt this deceiuer said while he was yet a liue. &amp;c.
            And yet we muste marke as touching the helthfull passiō of our Lord Iesu Christ, that it was most fylthy &amp; most ignominius &amp; shameful, be reasō of ye place, because it was done in Ierusalem. Wher he was knowen and honored, and wher he had done many miracles. Item because of the time &amp; day, for it was done in the solempne

feast of Ester, when a greate multitude came together vnto the feast, and he was led vnto his crosse and passion at nyne of the clocke, to then
                  •
               ent he myghte bee sene and knowen of all menne. And agayne it was most fylthy cōsidering the kinde of death. For it was the deathe of the crosse, a death dewe vnto yll spoken menne, yll doers, and vniuste menne. And the maner of goynge to his deathe. Iesus wente forth bearynge his crosse the whiche thinge is not red of other two wicked persones which wer led with him.
                  Iohn. 19. And again bi reason of his cōpanions. For he was crucyfied betwixt ii. theues, asthough he had ben one of thē, or the greatest or maister of them.
            Forthermore the bitternes of hys blessed passyō was increased by ye naturall complection of our lords body. For manifest it is yt his holi bodi was of ye best &amp; most purest cōplectiō: made &amp; fashioned by the worke of the holye goost, without any faute or errour of nature, and so his holye fleshe had no rebellion or fyght against the spirite:

And therfore the spirit did loue, &amp; not without a good cause, his body, more then any other mans spirite or soule shuld loue his body. Item the bitternes of his passion was agrauate by ye continuaunce of the same. For many mar
                  •
               irs that wer burnt, or drowned, or beheaded, did accomplish and ende their martirdome very shortly. But oure Lordes passion endured euen in a manner from thinstance of his conception, vntil the houre of his death. For he foreknewe mooste certenlye, what his humanity shulde suffer: but specially it continued from the tyme of his laste supper, vntill the nynthe hour of the syxte daye folowyng, And also it was aggrauate by the quality of the members, in the which he suffred, that is, in his fete and handes, ye whiche are members full of neaues &amp; sinewes, &amp; most ready to receiue dolor and pain. And that our lordes passyō was most bitter, and very greuous, it may be most chefely gathered by this yt Luke sheweth, for in his oration &amp; prayer had after supper, hys sweate

throughe the vehement imaginacion of the anguishe and paines that were to come,
                  Luc. 22. wer like droppes of bloude, trickeling downe to the ground.
            But that our Lord went frely and willingli vnto his passion, that made it most gratious:

excusinge them,

            And all this he suffred not for hym self, but for vs. For he prayd that the sinnes might be taken away, whych he neuer committed. And so hee dyed for our necessity and vtilitye, and not for hys owne, but for all hys frendes. For why, to deliuer vs, he would be taken, to redeme vs, he wold be sold, that we might be honored, he would be confounded and crucified. He was bound, that we might be losed, scourged, that we shoulde not be scourged, he died, that we shoulde not die eternally.

                  Numer. 7. the whyche the lordes of the tribes of Israell had offred. But he gaue nothing to the children of Caath, althoughe they were nearer of kin vnto hym, because their office was to heare all thynges vpon their shoulders.
            Moses wished and desired that all the Lordes people could Prophecye.

Notwithstanding that his honor, as it semed,
                  Nume. 11. should therby haue bene deminished.
            After that the spies were retorned, our Lord said to Moses,
                  Nume. 14 how long do thys people prouoke me, &amp; how long will it bee or they beleue me? I wyll smite them therefore with the pestylence, and wyl make of the a prince of a greater nacion, and mightyer then this is. But Moses wold be preserde no hier.
            The people pearishing for the tumult &amp; murmuringe that they made againste Moses and Aaron,
                  Nume. 16. Moses saide to Aaron. Take a censare, and put fire therin out of the aultare, and pour on cense. and goe quicklye vnto the congregacion, that thou mayste praye and obtayne the forgeneuesse for them.
            When Moses shuld dye,
                  Nume. 27. he prayed our Lorde mooste diligentlye that he woulde prouide the people of a meete and a good captain. But yet in speciall he would name none.
            Israell serued oure Lorde all the

dayes of Iosue. &amp;c.
                  Iosu. 24. For why a good prelate is very mete to direct the people in the waye of our Lorde.
            Samuel iudged al Israel and went about Bethel. Calgala,1. regu. 7. and Masphat, that they whiche hadde nede of hym, might the easlyer come vnto hym.
            Samuel saied vnto the people. God kepe me from this synne,1. regu. 12. yt I shoulde cease to pray for you, and I wil teach you a ryght waye and a good.
            When Dauid sawe the Aungell yt smote the people,2. regu. 24. he offerd him selfe to be beate for them, let thyne hād (I praye the) tourne agaynst me.
            Al they of Israel hard of the iudgement, whyche the kynge had iudged betwene the two wemen,3. regu. 3. and they feared the kynge, for they saw that the wysedome of God was in him to do iustice.
            It is a signe and a token that oure Lorde dothe loue the people when he geueth them a good prelate.3. regu. 9. For the Quene of Saba saied, our Lord loued Israell, and therefore he made ye king ouer it, to do equity &amp; righteousnes.
            
               
               3. regu. 20.Oure Lorde beynge purposed and wyllinge to deliuer the king of Siria into the kinge of Israels handes, sent him worde by his prophet, that the kinge shoulde beginne to fighte and geue battaile.
            As longe as Ioiada the byshoppe lyued,4. regu. 12. Ioas the kynge of Iuda was good, and did that whyche was good in the sighte of oure Lorde. But the byshoppe beynge dead, he did muche harme.
            Iosaphat the kinge of Iuda, set iudges in the lande ouer the people, and dyd faithfullye,2. Para. 19. and wysely instruct them. Take hede, sayeth he, what ye do, for ye execute not the iudgemēt of man, but of God, whiche is wyth you in the iudgemente. Wherefore nowe, let the feare of God bee vpon you, and take hede, and be doynge the thinge that pleaseth hym, for there is no vnrighteousnesse with the Lord oure GOD, that he shoulde haue any respecte of persons, or take rewardes.
            Hezechias kinge of Iuda caused th

brasen serpent to be broken in peces:4. regu. 18. because it was vnto the people an occasion of committinge ydolatry.
            The postes wente with letters thorowoute all Israell and Iuda at the kynges commaundemente and hys Lordes,2. Para. 30. sayinge. Turne againe vnto oure Lorde. &amp;c.
            As Esdras was prayinge and wepyng for the transgression of the people,1. Esd. 9. there resorted vnto him a greate company of men and women, and the people folowinge his ensample wept and lamented very sore.
            Eliachim the hye preast hearinge of the power of Holofernes,
                  Iudith. 4. wente rounde aboute all Israell: and spake vnto them sayinge. Be ye sure, that oure Lorde wyll heare youre petitions, if ye contynue stedfaste in fasstinges and prayers in the syghte of oure LORDE. And thus he comforted the people wyth good exhortations.
            A good prelate must be as a good father vnto ye people cōmitted vnto him For it is writtē by Esai of Eliachim,

whome oure lorde set and dyd constitute in Sobnas the rulers place:
                  Esa. 22. he shall be as a father of such as dwel in Ierusalem.
            After that Iudas Machabeus was dead,1. mach. 9. ther spronge vp wicked persons throughout all costes of Israell, and exhorted all such as did euyll, to wickednes. And in those daies there was greate hunger. &amp;c.
            When men thought that Ionathas was slayne by Tryphon.1. Mach. 12. Then all the heathen that were rounde aboute them, soughte to destroye them. For they saied, now haue they no captain, nor any man to helpe them. Therfore now let vs ouercome them, and rote out their name from amonge men.
            It is well sayed, that the prudencye and pitye of Onias the hye preaste,1. Mach. 3. and the goodnesse of other godly subiectes, was the cause of peace, and good estate of the holy citye.
            Onias did wel resyste Heliodorus, goynge aboute to spoyle the temple,2. mac. 3. and to take awaye suche thynges as was layed vp for wyddowes and fatherlesse

chyldren.
            Our sauiour and lord Iesus, where he calleth him selfe a good shepherde,
                  Iohn. 10. by and by he submitteth the cause, sayinge, a good shepharde geueth his lyfe for the shepe. And agayne I geue my lyfe for the shepe. Whereby he dothe vs to vnderstande, what thinge is required, that a mā may be called a good shephearde.
            When our Sauiour, after his resurrection, was mynded to committe the cōgregation of the church to Peter: first he proued him,
                  Iohn. 22. saying, Simō, louest thou me more then these? And note, that he examined him of dilection, &amp; not of knowledge, not of practice, or contemplation, but of the dede, not of the lawe. Nor he asked hym not once, but thryee. If thou loue me, fede my shepe, clyppe them not, nor slaye them. For whye a good prelate muste feede hys shepe, wyth worde, example, and bodely foode.
            Peter perceyuinge that the Iewes marueled, and iudged euyll of the discyples,

lifted vp his voyce, and sayde vnto them.
                  Act. 1. Ye menne of Iewrye. &amp;c. where he defendeth his flocke mooste constantly, and most holsomlye ouercommeth his aduersaries.
            We maye consider here by Paule, the prelate of all excellent goodnesse, that dilection dothe mooste specyallye pertaine to a good prelate.
                  Iohn. 10. For the prince and chefest of all pastoures did so loue his sheape, that hee gaue hys life for hys sheape. The whych loued theym euen to the latter ende. And Paule was meruelous feruente in that kynde of dilectyon and loue. And therefore he saide. I wyll verye gladlye bestowe, and wyll be bestowed for your soules,2. Cor. 12. thoughe the more I loue you, the lesse I am loued agayne.
            Item there oughte to bee in a prelate the science &amp; knowledge of scripture. Chuse and loue the lyghte of wisedome,
                  Sapi. 6. the which doth profyt the people. Or elsse howe can he dyscerne Leprosy,1. Cor. 
                  
                     •
                  .3. from no Leprosye, or iudge the people cōmitted vnto him. Paule

had an excellent knowledge bothe in deuine &amp; humain matters, he gaue vnto babes in Christ milke to dryncke, &amp; spake wisdome among those that are perfect. And he was takē vp into the third heauen,2 Cor. 12. &amp; harde secreat wordes which no man can vtter.
            The loue of subiectes, and knowledge of scriptures, causeth a presydent or a prelate to be dilygent.
                  Roma. 12. Lette him, saithe Paule that ruleth, doe it with diligence. The which solicitude and diligence Paule vsed mooste feruently towardes his neighbors. And therfore he saithe, beside the thynges whych outwardlye happen vnto me, I am combred dailye, and do care for all Congregatyons.2. Cor. 11. And in a nother place. I woulde ye knewe how great solicitude &amp; care that I haue for you.
                  Collo. 2. Of and by these three foresayd thynges thinstruction of the learned doth follow, and therfore our Lorde dothe promyse by Ieremy: sayinge, I wyll geue you herdmen after mine owne minde, whiche shall 
                  •
               eade you wyth learning and wisdome.
            
               As Artaxerzes said to Esdras, and to the iudges of the people.1. Esd. 7. Teache the vnlearned frelye, the whiche thynge Paule the doctor of the heathen hath done euidently, teaching the vniuersall world other by word or wryting a teacher of the gentiles wyth faythe &amp; verity and openeth the sauor of hys knowledge by vs in euery place.
                  i. Timo. 2.
               2 Cor. 2.
            
            Also a good prelate ought to dispose and orden his offices among his subiectes,
                  Exo. 18. as Moses did, the which by the counsell of Iethro made amonge the people rulers ouer hundreds, ouer fifty, and ouer ten. Paul dyd the lyke in ye church.
                  i. Cor. 11 Other thinges wyl I set in order when I come. And for yt thyng he said vnto Tite. For thys cause left I thee in Creta, that thou shouldest reforme the thinges that are vnperfect,
                  Tite. i.
                and shouldest ordayne elders and priestes in euery city, as I had apoynted thee.
            Item a good Prelate must animate and comfort the weaklings and fearful,
                  exo. 14. as Moses did, when he saide vnto the fearful people, feare not, our lord

shal fyght for you. And Paul did that thing very wel, sayinge. Be stronge and of good comfort in our Lord,
                  Ephe. 6. and through the vertue and power of hys might, put on al the armor of god. &amp;c. And again. Consider how that he endured such speaking against hym of synners,
                  Heb. 12. least ye should be wearyed &amp; faint in your mindes.
            A good Prelate should defende the oppressed: as Onias the hie priest did, the which did constantly resist Heliodorus going about to spoyle the temple,2. mach. 3 and how valiantly Paule wythstode the false Prophets,2. Cor. 11. it is manyfest in the Actes. And he saith, wher in so euer any man dare be hold, I dare be bold also. And therefore he sayde yt he fought. So fight I. not as one that beateth the ayre. And I haue fought a good fyghte.2. Timo. 4. I haue fulfylled my course.
            A good Prelate shoulde be a comforter of thafflicted, as Eliachim did, when Holofernes besieged Bethelia. And Paule was equal wyth hym in this part, and saithe. Blessed be God

the father of our Lord Iesus Christe, which is the father of mercy, and the God of all comfort,2. Cor. 1. which comforteth vs in all our tribulation, in so muche that wee are able to comforte them, whiche are in any maner of trouble. And againe. I beseche you brethren, suffer the worde of consolation or exhortation.
                  Heb. 13. And such wordes of consolation he vsed specially to the Philippians and Thessaloniās, as it is manifest to those that wyl searche &amp; loke for it.
            It good prelate must stirre vp those that be flouthful and colde.
                  Gen. 42 As Iacob the Patriarch did, the which hearing that there was vitailes and corne to be sold in Egypt, said to his children. Whye do you neglecte it? And that thyng could that noble Paule do full well. It is nowe time (sayeth Paule) that we should awake oute of sleape. And he saythe: Awake thou that sleapest, and stande vp from deathe,
                  Roma. 13. and Christe shall geue thee lyghte. And againe.
                  Ephe. 5. I warne thee that thou stirre vppe the gyfte of GOD whiche is

in thee, by the puttynge on of my handes.
            A good prelate in as muche as hee maye,2. Timo. 1. muste helpe the neady to haue that that is necessarye for them. We haue an ensample of that in Elizeus, the whyche dyd distribute to the children of the prophets twentye loues.4. regu. 4 The whyche thynge Paule dyd fulfyll moost diligentlye, hauyng in remembraunce these words. It is more blessed to geue,
                  Act. 20. then to receyue, as he saithe. And when he had not what to geue, he procured it of other mē, as it doth wel apeare to the Corinthians.1. Cor. 16. Concerning the gathering. &amp;c. and againe. He whiche soweth lyttle,2. Cor. 9. shall reape little.
            It pertaineth to a good prelate to brynge those lowe that are proude. And Moses purposing to do the same sayed rebukyngly.
                  Nume. 16. Ye make much to doe, ye children of Leuy. And Samuell sayde vnto Saule. Wherfore hast thou not harkened vnto the voyce of our Lord.
            
               And Paule was very well learned in this art, saying. Some swel as thoughe I wold come no more to you,
                  i. regu. 15. but I wil come to you shortly, if God wil, and wil know not the words of them which swell,1. Cor. 4. but the power. And in another place. Charge them whyche are riche in this worlde, that they be not proud and hie mineded.1. Timo. 6.
            
            Againe a good Prelate ought personally to viset those which are farre of,
                  i. regum. 7 and are not able to come vnto him the which thing Samuel dyd fulfyll. For he went about Bethel, Calgala, and Masphat, and iudged the people. And who at anye time exercysed that thing as Paule did? the whyche from Ierusalem to the latter sea,
                  Roma. 15. fylled all places wyth the Gospel of Christ, and so, that he named hys lyfe a certayne course.
                  i. Cor. 9. I therfore so run, not as at an vncertaine thing.2. Timo. 4. And I haue fulfylled my course.
            Also a good Prelate oughte to punish transgressors,
                  exo. 31. as Moses did, whē they worshipped and prayed vnto the molten calfe. Nor Paul was not neglygente

in this parte, but sayde. The weapons of oure warfare are not carnall thinges,2. Cor. 10. but thinges myghty in God. Then there foloweth. And are ready to take vengaunce on all dysobedyence. And also.
                  i. Cor. 4. Shal I come vnto you with a rod, or elsse in loue, and in the spryte of softnesse?
            A good Prelate oughte to extirpe &amp; wede oute the stubburne and pestyferous from amonge the people: as Moses did with Chore and hys, whyche claue vnto hym.
                  Nume. 16. Seperate sayeth he, and stand thou and all the congregation alofe. And then vnto thother he sayd. Depart from the tentes of these wycked men. And Paule saith of him that kept hys mother in lawe. I haue determined to deliuer him vnto Sathan for the destruction of the fleshe.1. Cor. 5. And afterwardes. Pourge ye the old leuen. And he deliuered vnto Sathan Hymeneus and Alexander,1. Timo. 1. to learne not to blaspheme.
            And to make an end, this good prelate must pray for all men,
                  Exodi. 32. as Moses dyd, the whych prayed vnto our lord.

And as Samuel did. God forbid that I should synne againste oure Lorde,1. regu. 12. and cease praying for you. And Paul did fulfil this thyng most diligently,
                  Roma. 1. wythout ceasing I make mention of you in my prayers. And againe. We praye alwaies for you that oure God wyl make you worthy of his calling,2. Thes. 1. &amp;c. And he exhorted that it mighte be done. I pray you that aboue all thynges, prayers may be had for all men,
                  i. Timo. 2. and kynges.
         
         
            ¶Of euil princes and prelates. Capi. Cii.
            OUr Lord commaunded Moses saying:
                  Nume. 15 Take all the heades of the people, and hange them vp before the Lord against the sonne:
            Moses said vnto Aaron, what dyd this people vnto thee,
                  Exodi. 32. that thou haste brought so great a sin vpon them? as though he wold say, ye prelate should sin greatly against his subiects, that would incline to theyr euil wyll and purposes.
            
               Elye corrected hys sonnes but slenderlye, the whyche thynge dyspleased oure Lorde verye sore,1. regu. 2. and yet wyth wordes he corrected and reprehended them, but he did it but softely. and not profitably nor sharply, what shall we then say of those that fauour men in mischefe, or of those that geue men an occasion of euyll?
            The whole wayt of the battayle tourned vppon Saule, and so he fell and was slayne.
                  i. regu. 31.
            
            For Dauids synne that he comitted whē he nūbred his people,2. reg. 24. there dyed of the people seuenty thousande men.

            Subiectes by the occasion of euyll prelates and rulers are at some times temporallye punished.3. regu. 18. Wherevpon Helias saied to Achab. Thou troublest al Israel, and thy fathers house.
            
               The kinge of Siria commaunded the captaines of his Charettes,3. reg. 22. thus. Fight neyther with small nor great, saue only against the kyng of Israel. And that was only against that most wicked Achab.
            Manasses made Iuda and the inhabiters of Ierusalem to erre,2. Para. 33. and to do worse then the Heathen, whome our Lord destroyed before the chyldren of Israel.
            Esay hathe exprest the synnes and fautes of the euel rulers and prelates that dwelt in Ierusalem,
                  esa. i.

            Sobna the ruler of the temple beleued that he should lyue long in Ierusalem, and when he shoulde dye, to be honourably buried. But oure Lorde sayde thus vnto hym. What hast yu to do here, and whome hast thou here?

And a non after there foloweth. I wil dryue the from thy station and dwellynge place.

            Sedechias sayed vnto hys estates that desyred the death of Ieremy.

But the Aungel of oure lorde by nyghte, broughte them forthe. Then wente the Magistrates with ministers and broughte them agayne. And after manye and longe counsailes thei calde the Apostles vnto them, beate them, and cōmaunded that they shoulde not speake in the name of Iesu.
            The Iewes caughte Steuen, and brought him to the counsell, and whē the chefe preastes hadde obiected and layed many thynges vnto hym,
                  Act. 6.7. then sayed they, is it euen so? When he hadde truly &amp; faithfully defended him selfe, and sharply reproued them, they stoned him to death.
            Certaine menne hauinge a damsel, whome Paule delyuered of a spryte whyche Prophesied,

The Magistrates and Iudges with out any probation there of, cōmaunded thē to be beaten, and to be thruste into the hard and inner prison.
            When Paule was broughte into the counsell he beganne to speake resonablye, but euen at the fyrst worde that Paule spake,
                  Act. 23. the hye preaste cō

            Paule had euyll and wycked Iudges, Felyx and Festus,

            It was oure Lordes wyll, that the Iewes should be afflycted &amp; punyshed

            After that Manasses was in tribulation, and bound with chains in Babilon: he humbled hym self excedingly before our Lord,2. Para. 33. and God hard his prayer.

            Iudith speaking of her owne people, said.
                  Iudi. 8. Ye ought to remembre, that whan your father Abraham was tēpted, and tried thorow manye tribulations that he was made, and found a

louer and a frend of God.
            Iob sustained tribulatyon by hys wyfe: and by the reproches and contumelious woordes of his frendes: the which thing ought to haue prouoked him to heauines.

And in the losse of his substaunce and chyldren. In the taking away of hys solace and comfort, for hys wife abhord him and could not abide his breath. Other yōg and vile persons derided him, &amp; staind his face with spittle.
            Ieremy which was sāctifyed in his mothers wombe,

            Ieremy for preaching the truth vnto the people,
                  Iere. 16.18 was now and then punyshed, and ofte imprysonned, and at lengthe the people stoaned hym to deathe.
            
               Ezechiel being in Caldea as a banyshed man,
                  Ezech. 1.5. saw in the middes of the Captiues the wonderfull visions of God. Wherby it appeareth, that god doth oftentimes comfort those whych are in tribulation.
            It appeareth wel by Daniels cōpanions that our Lord is with him that is in tribulation:
                  Dani. 3. for Nabuchodonozor saw wyth theym a fourth lyke the sonne of God.
            Nabuchodonozor in hys prosperity was arrogant and proud,
                  Dani. 4. and therefore he was cast out of mens companye, and chaunged into a beast. But after that he recouered hys vnderstā
               ding, the which he, being in dignity &amp; honour, lost by elation and pryde, he praysed the hyest, whome before hee blasphemed.
            Our Lord was as highlye, or more praysed throughe the pacience of the iii. children,

            After the death of Iudas Machabeus, wicked men came vp, &amp; ther was a great dearth in the land.1. mach. 9. And wycked Bachides toke away the Lordes &amp; rulers of the country. And there be came great trouble in Israel.
            There went forth a very vniust decre and commaundement against the Iewes,2. mach. 6. that who so would not do sacrifice, after the lawes of the gentils, shuld be put to death. And there was great tribulation in Israel.
            Antiochus being in good healthe, was a cruell and a proude homicide,2. mach. 9. but afterwards smytten by god with a greuous and vncurable plague: he chaunged bothe hys wordes, and his purposes.
            After that our Lord was borne, he sone after felt and suffred ye pressures

            The Apostles beyng scourged by ye precepte and commaundement of the Magestrates:
                  Act. 5. departed from the coū
               sel, reioysing, that they were counted worthy, to suffer rebuke for the name of Iesu.
            And although Paul was not euen thē wyth the Apostles,
                  ii. Corin. xii
                yet he sayde afterwardes of him self: we reioyce in our tribulations. And again. Uery gladly wyl I reioyce of my weaknes, that the strength of Christe may dwell in me.
            
               
                  Act. 8.After that Steuen was stoned too death: there was a great persecutyon agaynste the Congregatyon whiche was at Ierusalem: and they were all scattred abrode thorow out the regyons of Iewry and Samaria, excepte the Apostles. But yet note. That it was muche profytable for the dinulgation

of the gospell.
            It may be well knowen by the actes of the Apostles, that Paule after his conuersion suffered tribulations and persecutions.
                  Act. 9. For ye Iewes toke counsell together,2. Corin. 11. to kyll hym by nighte. And when they went aboute their deceitfulnesse, he was let downe thorowe the wall in a basket.
            When Paule and Barnabas wer in Antioche Pisidia,
                  Act. 13. they sowed and preached the word of God, thorowout al the country. But the Iewes raysed persecusion agaynst them, and were expelled oute of theyr coastes. But they shoke of the dust of their feete against them, and came to Iconium.
            In the citye of Li
                  •
               tris they wer had in such honoure,
                  Act. 14. because of ye creapel, whome Paule healed, that they wold haue done sacrifice vnto thē. But thyther came certain Iewes, which whē they had obtained ye peoples consent, &amp; had stoned Paul, thei drewe him out of ye city, supposing he had bene dead.
            And in Macedonia, by the occasion of a damsell, oute of whome Paule

cast forth a sprite that prophesied, her master beynge heauye for the gayne that they lost thereby:
                  Act. 16. they apprehended and toke Paul, and his felow Silas, and saied yt thei wer disturber
                  •
                of ye citye. The rulers cōmaunded thē

               o be chastened with rods, &amp; to be cast in prison, &amp; to set their feete in ye stockes.
            Afterwards at Thessalonica, when many of them beleued, the disdainfull Iewes, by certaine euell men, slyrde vp,
                  Act. 17. and set all the citye in a roar. But the brethren immediatly sent awaye Paule and Silas vnto Berrea. But when the Iewes perceyued that they had receyued also the word of God at Berrea: they came and moued &amp; troubled the people there. And thē immediately the brethren sent away Paul, and by sea brought him to Athens.
            Paule in lyke manner preached at Corinthe, and testified to the Iewes that Iesus was very Christ. And whē they saide contrary &amp; blasphemed,
                  Act. 18. he shoke hys raymente, and sayed vnto them: youre bloude bee vpon youre owne headdes.
            
               When Callio was a ruler of the countrey of Acaia, the Iewes made insurrection with one accorde against Paule,
                  Act. 18. and brought him to the iudgement seate, sayinge. This felowe counceleth men to worship God contrary to the lawe.
            Paule departinge from Ephesus, and preachinge boldely the worde of God, and doynge there many myracles:
                  Act. 19. A certain manne named Demetrius a siluer smyth, which made syluer shrynes for Diana, called together the workmen of like occupation, and styrde vp a great number of people agaynst Paule, whome he sayed dyd tourne muche people from the worshippinge of the goddes. When they hearde these sayinges, they wer full of wrathe, and cryed oute sayinge: Greate is Dyana of the Ephesians.
            As Paule was saylynge oute of Grece into Siria, the Iewes layed wayte for him:
                  Act. 20. and he was counseled to retourne thorowe Macedonia.

And there accompanyed hym many brethren of dyuers and sondrye places.
            When certayne Iewes of Assyria hadde seene Paule in the Temple, they moued all the people, and layed handes on hym, cryinge. Menne of Israel, help. And they toke Paul and drewe him out of the temple.
                  Act. 21. And as they went about to kil hym, tydinges came vnto the hye capitayne, that all Ierusalem was moued: the whyche toke soudiers, and ranne vnto them. When they sawe hym and the soudyers, they lefte smytynge of Paule. Then the captayne toke Paule, and commaunded him to be bounde with two chaynes.
            As the Iewes cryed against Paul, and caste of theyr clothes and threw duste into the ayer:
                  Act. 22. the capitayne commaunded hym to be broughte into the castell, and bad that he shoulde be scourged, and examyned, that they myght knowe wherefore they cryed so on hym.
            
               When the hye captaine had Paule in holde: mo then fortye Iewes sayd vnto the hye priest. We haue made a vowe that we wyll taste nor eate nothinge, vntyll we haue slayne Paule. Cause hym therefore to be broughte forthe. For wee are readye or euer hee come near,
                  Act. 23. to kyll hym. But the Capitayne beynge monyshed of thys by Paules systers sonne, caused him wyth stronge hande and warelye to bee conueyed vnto Felyx the hye debitye.
            Paule standinge before Felyx the Debity, the Iewes accused him that he was a pestilente felowe and a seditious,
                  Ac. 24.25 and when he had oftentymes harde hym and the Iewes, and that the tyme was sore spente, and that Festus should succede him in Cesaria:
                  Act. 27.28 hee wyllynge to shewe the Iewes a pleasure, lefte Paule bounde, the whiche perceyuinge that Festus dyd hym wronge, appealed vnto Cesar.
            After this appeale, he suffered shipwrack, and at Rome was bound with

chaynes, and sufferd great anguyshe and tribulation.
            
               
                  Act. 14.Paul and Barnabas exhorted them to continue in the faythe, affirminge that we must thorow muche tribulation enter into the kingdome of God.
            
               2. Corin. 1.The Apostle wrytinge of him selfe sayeth, Brethren I woulde not haue you ignorant of oure trouble, which happened vnto vs in Asia. Where with we were greued out of mesure, passinge strength, so greatlye that it yrked vs to lyue.
            When we were come into Macedonia, our fleshe had no rest,2. Corin. 7. but we wer troubled on euery syde, outward was fightinge, inwarde was feare.
            And the Apostle commendinge the Thessaloniās, sayd. Ye became folowers of vs,1. Thes. 1. and of our Lord, receauinge the worde with much affliction with ioye of the holy ghost.
            There was aboute a fytye yeares from the tyme of the cōminge of the holy ghost vnto the disciples,
                  Apo. 1.5. Per totum.
                and the time that Domitian exyled Iohn the Apostle. And yet we rede not, that

he hadde in all that tyme so many dyuine consolations, as hee hadde in the lyttle tyme of his tribulation. As it is euident in the fyrste of the Apocalipse.

Then were Paule and his felowes in great daunger of body, but the town clarke speaking faire, and discreatlye to the people, ceased them, and let the congregation

depart euerye man to hys owne house.

Afterwardes when hee had declared what thinges had chanced vnto hym, al they of Damasco lift vp their voyces, and said. Away with him,
                  Act. 21.22.23. for it is no reason that he should liue. The next day following, Paule cryed out in the counsel, men and brethren, I am a Pharisey, the sonne of a Pharisey, then there arose a debate betwene the Phariseis and the Saduces, and the multitude was deuided. And certaine Phariseis rose vp and fought, saying. We fynde no euell in thys man. Though a spryte or an angel hath appeared and spoken to him let vs not striue against God.
            When that Paule, after the shypwracke that happened in the wynter, was warminge him selfe at the fyre:

ther came a viper out of the heat, and caughte him by the hande, when the straungers saw that, they sayd amōg them selues:
                  Act. 28. No doubte this man is a murtherer: whome though he haue escaped the sea, yet vengaunce suffreth not to lyue. Paule shoke of the viper into the fyre, and felt no harme. But when they sawe no harme come to him, they chaunged their mynds, and said that he was a God.
