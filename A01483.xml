            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

               It may Please Your Highnesse,
            
            
               In part of my acknowledgment to Your Highnesse, I haue endeuoured to doe Honour to the Memory of the last King of ENGLAND, that was Ancestour to the King your Father, and Your selfe; and was that King to whom both Unions may in a

sort referre: That of the Roses beeing in him Consummate, and that of the Kingdomes by him begunne. Besides, his Times deserue it. For hee was a Wise Man, and an Excellent King; and yet the Times were rough, and full of Mutations, and rare Accidents. And it is with Times, as it is with Wayes. Some are more Vp-hill and Downe-hill, and some are more Flat and Plaine; and the One is better for the Liuer, and the Other for the Writer. I haue not flattered him, but took him to life as well as I could, sitting so farre off, and hauing no better light. It is true, Your Highnesse hath a Liuing Patterne, Incomparable, of the King your Father. But it is not amisse for You also to see one of these Ancient Peeces. GOD preserue Your Highnesse.
            
            
               Your Highnesses most humble and

            THE HISTORIE OF THE REIGNE OF King HENRY the Seuenth.
            
            
               AFter that RICHARD the third of that name, King in fact onely, but Tyrant both in Title and Regiment, and so commonly termed and reputed in all times since, was by the Diuine Reuenge, fauouring the designe of an Exilde man, ouerthrowne and slaine at Bosworth-field: There succeeded in the Kingdome the Earle of Richmond, thence-forth stiled HENRY the Seuenth. The King immediately after the Victorie, as one that had beene bred vnder a deuout Mother, and was in his nature, a great Obseruer of religious formes, caused Te Deum Laudamus to be solemnely sung in the presence of the whole Armie vpon the place, and was himselfe with generall applause, and great Cries of Ioy, in a kind of Militar Election, or Recognition, saluted King. Meane-while the body

of RICHARD after many indignities and reproches (the Dirigies and Obsequies of the common people towards Tyrants) was obscurely buried. For though the King of his noblenesse gaue charge vnto the Friers of Leicester to see an honourable interrment to be giuen to it, yet the Religious People themselues (being not free from the humors of the Vulgar) neglected it; wherein neuerthelesse they did not then incurre any mans blame or censure. No man thinking any ignominie or contumely vnworthy of him, that had beene the Executioner of King HENRY the Sixth (that innocent Prince) with his owne hands; the Contriuer of the death of the Duke of Clarence, his Brother; the Murderer of his two Nephewes (one of them his lawfull King in the Present, and the other in the Future, fayling of him) and vehemently suspected to haue beene the Impoisoner of his wife, thereby to make vacant his Bed, for a Marriage within the Degrees forbidden. And although he were a Prince in Militar vertue approued, iealous of the honour of the English Nation, and likewise a good Law-maker, for the ease and solace of the common people: yet his Cruelties and Parricides in the opinion of all men, weighed downe his Vertues and merits; and in the opinion of wise men, euen those Vertues themselues were conceiued to bee rather fained, and Affected things to serue his Ambition, then true Qualities ingenerate in his Iudgement or Nature. And therfore it was noted by men of great vnderstanding (who seeing his after Acts, looked backe vpon his former Proceedings) that euen in the time of King EDWARD his Brother, he was not without secret Traines and Mines to turne Enuie and Hatred vpon his Brothers Gouernement; as hauing an Expectation and a kind of Diuination, that the King, by reason of his many disorders, could not be of long life, but was like to leaue

his Sonnes of tender yeares; and then hee knew well, how easie a step it was, from the place of a Protector, and first Prince of the Bloud, to the Crowne. And that out of this deepe root of Ambition it sprang, that aswell at the Treatie of peace that pussed betweene EDWARD the Fourth, and LEWIS the Eleuenth of France, concluded by Enteruiew of both Kings at Piqueny, as vpon all other Occasions, RICHARD then Duke of Glocester, stood euer vpon the side of Honour, raising his owne Reputation to the disaduantage of the King his Brother, and drawing the eyes of all (especially of the Nobles and Souldiours) vpon himselfe; as if the King by his voluptuous life and meane marriage, were become effeminate and lesse sensible of honour, and Reason of State, then was fit for a King, Andras for the Politique and wholesome Lawes which were enacted in his time, they were interpreted to be but the Brocage of an Vsurper, therby to wooe, and winne the hearts of the people, as being conscious to himselfe that the true obligations of Soueraigntie in him failed, and were wanting. But King HENRY in the very entrance of his Reigne, and the instant of time, when the Kingdome was cast into his Armes, met with a Point of great difficultie, and knotty to solue, able to trouble and confound the wisest King in the newnesse of his Estate; and so much the more, because it could not endure a Deliberation, but must be at once deliberated and determined. There were fallen to his lot, and concurrent in his person, three seuerall Titles to the Imperiall Crowne. The first, the title of the Lady Elizabeth, with whom, by precedent Pact with the Partie that brought him in, he was to marry. The second, the ancient and long disputed Title (both by Plea, and Armes) of the House of Lancaster, to which he was Inheritour in his owne Person. The third, the

Title of the Sword or Conquest, for that he came in by victorie of Battaile, and that the King in possession was slaine in the field. The first of these was fairest, and most like to giue contentment to the people, who by two and twentie yeares Reigne of King EDWARD the Fourth, had beene fully made capable of the clearnesse of the Title of the White-Rose or House of Yorke; and by the milde and plausible Reigue of the same king toward his Latter time, were become affectionate to that Line. But then it lay plaine before his Eyes, that if he relied vpon that Title, he could be but a King at Curtesie, and haue rather a Matrimoniall then a Regall power: the right remaining in his Queene, vpon whose decease, either with Issue, or without Issue, he was to giue place, and bee remoued. And though he should obtaine by Parliament to bee continued, yet hee knew there was a very great difference betweene a King that holdeth his Crowne by a cicuill act of Estates, and one that holdeth it originally by the Law of Nature, and descent of Bloud. Neither wanted there euen at that time secret Rumors and whisperings (which afterwards gathered strength and turned to great troubles) that the two young Sonnes of King EDWARD the Fourth, or one of them (which were said to be destroyed in the Tower) were not indeed murthered, but conueyed secretly away, and were yet liuing: which if it had beene true, had preuented the Title of the Lady ELIZABETH. On the other side, if he stood vpon his owne Title of the House of Lancaster, inherent in his Person; hee knew it was a Title condemned by Parliament, and generally preiudged in the common opinion of the Realme, and that it tended directly to the disinherison of the Line of Yorke, held then the indubiate Heires of the crowne. So that if he should haue no Issue by the Lady ELIZABETH, which should bee

Descendents of the Double-Line, when the ancient flames of Discord and intestine Warres vpon the Competition of both Houses, would againe returne and reuiue.
            As for Conquest notwithstanding, Sir WILLIAM STANLEY, after some acclamations of the Souldiers in the Field, had put a Crowne of ornament (which RICHARD wore in the Battaile, and was found amongst the Spoiles) vpon King HENRIES head, as if there were his chiefe Title; yet he remembred well vpon what Conditions and Agreements hee was brought in, and that to claime as Conquerour, was to put as well his owne Partie, as the rest, into Terror and Feare; as that which gaue him power of disanulling of Lawes, and disposing of Mens Fortunes and Estates, and the like points of absolute power, being in themselues so harsh and odious, as that WILLIAM himselfe, commonly called the Conquerour, howsoeuer he vsed and exercised the power of a Conquerour, to reward his Normans, yet he sorbare to vse that Claime in the beginning, but mixed it with a Titularie pretence grounded vpon the Will and designation of EDWARD the Confessor. But the King out of the greatnesse of his owne minde, presently cast the Die, and the inconueniences appearing vnto him on all parts; and knowing there could not be any Interreigne or suspension of Title; and preferring his affection to his owne Line and Bloud, and liking that Title best which made him independent; and being in his Nature and constitution of minde not very apprehensiue or forecasting of future Euents a-farre off, but an Intertainer of Fortune by the Day; resolued to rest vpon the Title of Lancaster as the Maine, and to vse the other two, that of Marriage, and that of Battaile, but as Supporters, the one to appease secret Discontents, and the other to beat downe open murmur and dispute: not

forgetting that the same Title of Lancaster had formerly maintained a possession of three Descents in the Crowne, and might haue proued a Perpetuitie, had it not ended in the weaknesse and inabilitie of the last Prince. Whereupon the King presently that very day, being the two and twentieth of August, assumed the Stile of King in his owne name, without mention of the Lady ELIZABETH at all, or any relation therunto. In which course hee euer after persisted, which did spin him a threed of many seditions and troubles. The King full of these thoughts, before his departure from Leicester, dispatched Sir ROBERT WILLOVGHBY to the Castle of Sheriffe-Hutton in Yorkeshire, where were kept in safe custodie by King RICHARDS commandement, both the Lady ELIZABETH daughter of king EDWARD, and EDWARD PLANTAGENET, Sonne and Heire to GEORGE Duke of Clarence. This EDWARD was by the Kings warrant deliuered from the Constable of the Castle to the hand of Sir ROBERT WILLOVGHBY; and by him with all safetie and diligence conueyed to the Tower of London, where he was shut vp Close-prisoner. Which Act of the Kings (being an Act meerely of Policie and power) proceeded not so much from any apprehension he had of Doctor Shawes tale at Pauls Crosse, for the bastarding of EDWARD the fourths Issues, in which case this young Gentleman was to succeed (for that Fable was euer exploded) but vpon a serled disposition to depresse all Eminent persons of the Line of Yorke. Wherin still the King out of strength of Will, or weaknesse of Iudgement, did vse to shew a little more of the Partie, then of the King.
            
            For the Lady ELIZABETH shee receiued also a direction to repaire with all conuenient speed to London, and there to remaine with the Queene Dowager
               
her Mother; which accordingly she soone after did, accompanied with many Noble-men and Ladies of Honour. In the meane season the King set forwards by easie iourneys to the Citie of London, receiuing the Acclamations and Applauses of the People as he went, which indeed were true and vnfained, as might well appeare in the very Demonstrations and Fulnesse of the Crie. For they thought generally that hee was a Prince as ordayned and sent downe from Heauen, to vnite and put to an end the long dissentions of the two Houses; which although they had had in the times of HENRY the Fourth, HENRY the Fifth, and a part of HENRY the Sixth on the one side, and the times of EDWARD the Fourth on the other, Lucide-interuals and happy Pauses; yet they did euer hang ouer the Kingdome, readie to breake forth into new Perturbations and Calamities. And as his victorie gaue him the Knee, so his purpose of marriage with the Lady ELIZABETH, gaue him the Heart; so that both Knee and Heart did truely bow before him.
            Hee on the other side with great wisedome (not ignorant of the affections and feares of the people) to disperse the conceit and terrour of a Conquest, had giuen order that there should be nothing in his iourney like vnto a warlike March, or manner: but rather like vnto the Progresse of a King in full peace and assurance.
            Hee entred the Citie vpon a Saturday, as hee had also obtained the Victorie vpon a Saturday, which day of the Weeke first vpon an Obseruation, and after vpon Memorie and Fancie, hee accounted and chose as a day prosperous vnto him.
            The Major and Companies of the Citie receiued him at Shore-ditch: whence, with great and Honorable attendance and troups of Noble-men, and Persons

of Qualitie hee entred the Citie; himselfe not being on Horse-backe, or in any open Chaire, or Throne, but in a close Chariot, as one that hauing beene somtimes an Enemie to the whole State, and a Proscribed person, chose rather to keepe State, and strike a Reuerence into the people then to fawne vpon them.
            He went first into Saint Paules Church, where not meaning that the people should forget too soone that hee came in by Battaile, hee made Offertorie of his Standards, and had Orizons and Te Deum againe sung, and went to his Lodging prepared in the Bishop of Londons Palace, where he stayed for a time.
            During his abode there, he assembled his Counsell, and other principall persons, in presence of whom, he did renew againe his promise to marrie with the Lady ELIZABETH. This hee did the rather, because hauing at his comming out of Britaine giuen artificially, for seruing of his owne turne some hopes, in cale he obtained the Kingdome, to marrie ANNE Inheritresse to the Duchie of Britaine, whom CHARLES the Eight of France soone after married; It bred some doubt and suspicion amongst diuers, that he was not sincere, or at least not fixed in going on with the match of England so much desired: which Conceit also though it were but Talke and Discourse did much afflict the poore Lady ELIZABETH her selfe. But howsoeuer he both truly intended it, and desired also it should be so beleeued, (the better to extinguish Enuie and Contradiction to his other purposes) yet was he resolued in himselfe not to proceed to the Consummation thereof till his Coronation and a Parliament were past. The one, least a ioynt Coronation of himselfe and his Queene might giue any countenance of participation of Title; The other, least in the intayling of the Crowne to himselfe, which he hoped to obtaine by Parliament, the

Votes of the Parliament might any wayes reflect vpon her.
            About this time in Autumne, towards the end of September, there began and reigned in the Citie and other parts of the Kingdome a Disease then new: which of the Accidents and manner thereof, they called the Sweating Sicknesse. This Disease had a swift course both in the Sicke-Body and in the Time and Period of the lasting therof: for they that were taken with it, vpon foure and twentie houres escaping were thought almost assured. And as to the Time of the malice and reigne of the Disease ere it ceased; It began about the one and twentieth of September, and cleared vp before the end of October, insomuch as it was no hinderance to the Kings Coronation, which was the last of October: nor (which was more) to the holding of the Parliament, which began but seuen dayes after. It was a Pestilent-Feuer, but as it seemeth not seated in the Veynes or Humors, for that there followed no Carbuncle, no purple or liuide Spots, or the like, the Masse of the Bodie being not tainted: onely a maligne Vapour flew to the Heart and seased the vitall Spirits; which stirred Nature to striue to send it forth by an extreme sweat. And it appeared by experience that this Disease was rather a Surprise of Nature, than obstinate to remedies, if it were in time looked vnto. For if the Patient were kept in an equall temper, both for Clothes, Fire, and Drinke, moderately warme, with temperate Cordials, wherby Natures worke were neither irritated by Heat, nor turned backe by Cold, hee commonly recouered. But infinite Persons died sodainly of it, before the manner of the Cure and attendance was knowne. It was conceiued not to bee an Epidemicke Disease, but to proceed from a malignitie in the constitution of the Aire, gathered by the predispositions

of Seasons: and the speedie cessation declared as much.
            On SIMON and IVDES Euen the King dined with THOMAS BOVRCHIER, Arch-Bishop of Canterburie, and Cardinall: and from Lambeth went by Land ouer the Bridge to the Tower, where the morrow after hee made twelue Knights-Bannerets. But for Creations hee dispensed them with a sparing hand. For notwithstanding a Field so lately fought, and a Coronation so neere at hand, hee onely created three: IASPER Earle of Pembroke (the Kings Vncle) was created Duke of Bedford; THOMAS the Lord STANLEY (the Kings Father-in-law Earle of Darbie; and EDWARD COVRTNEY Earle of Deuon; though the King had then neuerthelesse a purpose in himselfe to make more in time of Parliament; bearing a wise and decent respect to distribute his Creations, some to honour his Coronation, and some his Parliament.
            
            The Coronation followed two dayes after vpon the thirtieth day of October in the yeare of our Lord 1485. At which time INNOCENT the Eight was Pope of Rome; FREDERICKE the Third, Emperour of Almaine; and MAXIMILIAN his sonne newly chosen King of the Romans; CHARLES the Eight, King of France; FERDINANDO and ISABELLA, Kings of Spain; and IAMES the Third, King of Scotland: with all which Kings and States, the King was at that time in good peace and amitie. At which day also (as if the Crowne vpon his head, had put perils into his thoughts) he did institute for the better securitie of his person a Band of fiftie Archers vnder a Captaine to attend him, by the name of Yeomen-of-his-Guard: and yet that it might be thought to be rather a matter of Dignitie, after the imitation of that hee had knowne abroad, then any matter of Diffidence appropriate

to his owne Case, hee made it to be vnderstood for an Ordinance not temporarie, but to hold in succession for euer after.
            The seuenth of Nouember the King held his Parliament at Westminster, which hee had summoned immediately after his comming to London. His Ends in calling a Parliament (and that so speedily) were chiefly three; First, to procure the Crowne to bee entayled vpon himselfe. Next, to haue the Attaindors of all of his Partie (which were in no small number) reuersed, and all Acts of hostilitie by them done in his quarrell, remitted and discharged: and on the other side to attaine by Parliament, the Heads and Principals of his Enemies. The Third, to calme and quiet the feares of the rest of that Partie by a Generall-Pardon: not being ignorant in how great danger a King stands from his Subiects, when most of his Subiects are conscious in themselues, that they stand in his danger. Vnto these three speciall Motiues of a Parliament was added, that hee as a prudent and moderate Prince, made this iudgement; that it was fit for him to hasten to let his people see, that hee meant to gouerne by Law, howsoeuer hee came in by the Sword: and fit also to reclaime them to know him for their King, whom they had so lately talked of as an Enemie or Banished-man, For that which concerned the Entayling of the Crowne; (more then that he was true to his owne Will, that hee would not endure any mention of the Lady ELIZABETH: no not in the nature of Speciall-Intaile,) he carried it otherwise with great wisdome and measure. For he did not presse to haue the Act penned by way of Declaration or Recognition of right: as on the other side, he auoyded to haue it by new Law or Ordinance; but chose rather a kind of middle-way, by way of Establishment, and that vnder couert and indifferent words; That the inheritance
               
               of the Crowne should rest, remaine, and abide in the King, &amp;c. which words might equally be applied; That the Crowne should continue to him: but whether as hauing former right to it, (which was doubtfull) or hauing it then in Fact and possession (which no man denied) was left faire to interpretation eyther way. And againe for the limitation of the Entaile, he did not presse it to goe further then to himselfe and to the Heires of his body, not speaking of his right Heires; but leauing that to the Law to decide: so as the Entaile might seeme rather a personall fauour to him, and his children, then a totall Dis-inherison to the House of Yorke. And in this forme, was the Law drawne and passed. Which Statute hee procured to be confirmed by the Popes Bull the yeare following, with mention neuerthelesse (by way of Recitall) of his other Titles; both of Descent and Conquest. So as now the wreath of Three was made a wreath of Fiue, for to the three first Titles of the two Houses, or Lines, and Conquest, were added two more; the Authorities Parliamentarie and Papall.
            
            The King likewise in the Reuersall of the Attaindors of his Partakers, and discharging them of all offences incident to his seruice and succour, had his Will: and Acts did passe accordingly. In the passage whereof, exception was taken to diuers Persons in the house of Commons for that they were attainted, and therby not legall, nor habilitate to serue in Parliament, being disabled in the highest degree; And that it should bee a great incongruitie to haue them to make Lawes, who themselues were not Inlawed. The truth was, that diuers of those which had in the time of King RICHARD beene strongest and most declared for the Kings Partie, were returned Knights and Burgesses for the Parliament; whether by care or

recommendation from the State, or the voluntarie inclination of the People: many of which had beene by RICHARD the third attainted by Outlawries, or otherwise. The King was somewhat troubled with this. For though it had a graue and specious Shew, yet it reflected vpon his Partie. But wisely not shewing himselfe at all moued therewith, hee would not vnderstand it but as a Case in Law; and wished the Iudges to be aduised therupon: who for that purpose were forthwith assembled in the Exchequer-Chamber (which is the Councell-Chamber of the Iudges) and vpon deliberation they gaue a graue and safe Opinion and Aduice, mixed with Law and Conuenience; which was, that the Knights and Burgesses attainted by the course of Law, should forbeare to come into the House, till a Law were passed for the reuersall of their Attaindors.
            
            It was at that time incidently moued amongst the Iudges in their Consultation, what should be done for the King himselfe, who likewise was attainted? But it was with vnanimous consent resolued, That the Crowne takes away all defects and stops in bloud: and that from the time the King did assume the Crowne, the fountaine was cleared, and all Attaindors and Corruption of bloud discharged. But neuerthelesse for Honours sake it was ordained by Parliament, that all Records wherein there was any memorie, or mention of the Kings Attaindor, should be defaced, cancelled, and taken off the File.
            
            But on the part of the Kings Enemies there were by Parliament attainted; the late Duke of Glocester, calling himselfe RICHARD the Third, The Duke of Norfolke, the Earle of Surrey, Viscount LOVEL, the Lord FERRERS, the Lord ZOVCH, RICHARD RATCLIFFE, WILLIAM CATESBY, and many others of degree and qualitie. In which

Bills of Attaindors, neuerthelesse there were contained many iust and temperate Clauses, Sauings, and Prouisoes, well shewing and fore-tokening the wisdome, stay, and moderation of the Kings spirit of Gouernment. And for the Pardon of the rest, that had stood against the King; the King, vpon a second aduice, thought it not fit it should passe by Parliament, the better (being matter of Grace) to impropriate the thankes to himselfe: vsing onely the opportunitie of a Parliament time, the better to disperse it into the Veines of the Kingdome. Therfore during the Parliament, hee published his Royall Proclamation, offering Pardon and Grace of restitution, to all such as had taken Armes, or beene participant of any Attempts against him; so as, they submitted themselues to his mercie by a Day, and tooke the Oath of Allegeance and Fidelitie to him. Whereupon many came out of Sanctuary, and many more came out of Feare, no lesse guiltie then those that had taken Sanctuarie.
            
            As for Money or Treasure, the King thought it not seasonable, or fit to demand any of his Subiects at this Parliament: both because he had receiued satisfaction from them in matters of so great importance: and because hee could not remunerate them with any Generall Pardon, being preuented therin by the Coronation Pardon, passed immediatly before: but chiefly, for that it was in euery mans eye, what great Forfeitures and Confiscations he had at that present to helpe himselfe: Wherby those Casualties of the Crowne might in reason spare the Purses of the Subiect; especially in a time when he was in peace with all his Neighbours. Some few Lawes passed at that Parliament, almost for forme sake: amongst which there was One, to reduce Aliens, being made Denizens, to pay strangers Customes; and another, to draw to himselfe the Seisures and Compositions of Italians Goods, for not imployment being

Points of Profit to his Coffers, whereof from the very Beginning he was not forgetfull; and had beene more happie at the Latter End, if his early prouidence (which kept him from all necessitie of exacting vpon his people) could likewise haue attemp'red his nature therin. He added during Parliament, to his former Creations, the Innoblement or aduancement in Nobilitie of a few others: The Lord CHANDOS of Brittaine, was made Earle of Bathe; and Sir GILES DAWBENY was made Lord Dawbeny; and Sir ROBERT WILLOVGHBY Lord Brooke.
            
            The King did also with great Noblenesse and Bountie (which Vertues at that time had their turnes in his Nature) restore EDWARD STAFFORD (eldest sonne to HENRY, Duke of Buckingham, attainted in the time of King RICHARD) not onely to his Dignities, but to his Fortunes and Possessions, which were great: to which he was moued also by a kind of gratitude, for that the Duke was the man that moued the first Stone against the Tyrannie of King RICHARD, and indeed madethe King a bridge to the Crowne vpon his owne Ruines. Thus the Parliament brake vp.
            The Parliament being dissolued, the King sent forthwith Money to redeeme the Marquesse Dorset, and Sir IOHN BOVRCHIER, whom hee had left as his Pledges at Paris, for Money which hee had borrowed, when he made his Expedition for England. And thereupon hee tooke a fit occasion to send the Lord Treasurer and Master BRAY (whom hee vsed as Councellor) to the Lord Maior of London, requiring of the Citie a Prest of six thousand Markes: But after many Parlees, hee could obtaine but two thousand pounds. Which neuerthelesse the King tooke in good part; as Men vse to doe, that practise to borrow Money, when they haue no need. About this time, the

King called vnto his Priuie-Councell, IOHN MORTON, and RICHARD FOX, the one Bishop of Elie, the other Bishop of Excester, vigilant men, and secret, and such as kept watch with him almost vpon al men else. They had beene both versed in his Affaires, before hee came to the Crowne, and were partakers of his aduerse Fortune. This MORTON soone after vpon the death of BOVRCHIER, he made Archbishop of Canterbury. And for FOX, hee made him Lord Keeper of his Priuie-Seale, and afterwards aduanced him by Degrees, from Excester to Bathe and Wells, thence to Durham, and last, to Winchester. For although the King loued to imploy and aduance Bishops, because hauing rich Bishopricks, they carried their Reward vpon themselues: yet he did vse to raise them by steps; that hee might not lose the profit of the First-fruits, which by that course of Gradation was multiplied.
            At last, vpon the eighteenth of Ianuarie was solemnized the so long expected and so much desired Marriage, betweene the King &amp; the Lady ELIZABETH: Which Day of Marriage was celebrated with greater Triumph, and Demonstrations (especially on the peoples part) of Ioy and Gladnesse, than the dayes eyther of his Entrie, or Coronation; which the King rather noted, than liked. And it is true, that all his life time, while the Lady ELIZABETH liued with him, (for she died before him) hee shewed himselfe no very indulgent Husband towards her, though shee was beautifull, gentle, and fruitfull. But his auersion towards the House of YORKE was so predominant in him, as it found place, not only in his Warres and Counsells, but in his Chamber and Bed.
            
            Towards the middle of the Spring, the King, full of confidence and assurance, as a Prince that had beene victorious in Battaile, and had preuailed with his Parliament
               
in all that hee desired, and had the Ring of Acclamations fresh in his eares, thought the rest of his Raigne should bee but Play, and the enioying of a Kingdome. Yet as a wise and watchfull King, hee would not neglect any thing for his safetie; thinking neuerthelesse to performe all things now, rather as an Exercise, then as a Labour. So hee being truly informed, that the Northerne parts were not onely affectionate to the House of YORKE, but particularly had beene deuoted to King RICHARD the third; thought it would bee a Summer well spent to visit those Parts, and by his presence and application of himselfe, to reclaime and rectifie those humors. But the King, in his accompt of Peace, and Calmes, did much ouer-cast his Fortunes, which proued for many yeares together full of Broken Seas, Tides, and Tempests. For he was no sooner come to Lincolne, where he kept his Easter, but he receiued newes, that the Lord LOVEL, HVMPHREY STAFFORD, and THOMAS STAFFORD (who had formerly taken Sanctuarie at Colchester) were departed out of Sanctuarie, but to what place, no man could tell. Which aduertisement, the King despised, and continued his Iourney to Yorke. At Yorke there came fresh and more certaine aduertisement, that the Lord LOVEL was at band with a great power of men, and that the STAFFORDS were in Armes in Worcestershire, and had made their approaches to the Citie of Worcester, to assaile it. The King, as a Prince of great and profound iudgement, was not much moued with it; for that hee thought it was but a Ragge or Remnant of Bosworth-Field, and had nothing in it of the maine Partie of the house of YORKE. But hee was more doubtfull of the raysing of Forces to resist the Rebels, then of the Resistance it selfe; for that hee was in a Core of People, whose affections he suspected. But the Action enduring no delay, hee did speedily

leuie and send against the Lord LOVEL to the number of three thousand men, ill armed, but well assured (being taken some few out of his owne Traine, and the rest out of the Tenants and Followers of such as were safe to bee trusted) vnder the Conduct of the Duke of Bedford. And as his manner was to send his Pardons rather before the Sword then after, hee gaue Commission to the Duke, to proclaime pardon to all that would come in: Which the Duke, vpon his approach to the Lord LOVELS Campe, did performe. And it fell out as the King expected; the Heralds were the Great-Ordnance. For the Lord LOVEL, vpon Proclamation of pardon, mistrusting his men, fled into Lancashire, and lurking for a time with Sir THOMAS BROVGHTON, after sailed ouer into Flanders, to the Ladie MARGARET. And his men, forsaken of their Captaine, did presently submit themselues to the Duke. The STAFFORDS likewise, and their Forces, hearing what had happened to the Lord LOVEL (in whose successe their chiefe trust was) despaired, and dispersed. The two Brothers, taking Sanctuarie at Colnham, a Village neare Abington; which Place, vpon view of their Priuiledge in the Kings Bench, being iudged no sufficient Sanctuarie for Traitors, HVMPHREY was executed at Tiburne; and THOMAS, as being led by his elder brother, was pardoned. So this Rebellion proued but a Blast, and the King hauing by this Iourney purged a little the Dregs and Leauen of the Northerne People, that were before in no good affection towards him, returned to London.
            
            In September following, the Queene was deliuered of her first sonne, whom the King (in honour of the Brittish-Race, of which himselfe was) named ARTHVH, according to the Name of that ancient worthie King of the Britaines; in whose Acts there is truth enough to make him Famous, besides that which is

Fabulous. The Childe was strong and able, though hee was borne in the eight Moneth, which the Physicians doe preiudge.
            THere followed this yeare, being the Second of the Kings Reigne, a strange Accident of State, whereof the Relations which wee haue, are so naked, as they leaue it scarce credible; not for the nature of it (for it hath fallen out oft) but for the manner and circumstance of it, especially in the beginnings. Therfore wee shall make our Iudgement vpon the things themselues, as they giue light one to another, and (as wee can) digge Truth out of the Mine. The King was greene in his estate; and contrarie to his owne opinion, and desert both, was not without much hatred throughout the Realme. The root of all, was the discountenancing of the House of YORKE, which the generall Bodie of the Realme still affected. This did alienate the hearts of the Subiects from him daily more and more, especially when they saw, that after his Marriage, and after a Sonne borne, the King did neuerthelesse not so much as proceed to the Coronation of the Queene, not vouchsafing her the honour of a Matrimoniall Crowne; for the Coronation of her was not till almost two yeares after, when Danger had taught him what to doe. But much more, when it was spread abroad (whether by Errour, or the cunning of Male-Contents) that the King had a purpose to put to death EDWARD PLANTAGENET closely in the Tower: Whose case was so neerly paralleld with that of EDWARD the Fourths Children, in respect of the Bloud, like Age, and the very place of the Tower, as it did refresh and reflect vpon the King a most odious resemblance, as if hee would bee another King RICHARD. And all this time it was still whispered euery where, that at least one of the Children of EDWARD

the Fourth was liuing. Which Bruit was cunningly fomented by such as desired Innouation. Neither was the Kings nature and customes greatly fit to disperse these Mists; but contrariwise hee had a fashion rather to create Doubts, then Assurance. Thus was Fuell prepared for the Sparke: the Sparke that afterwards kindled such a fire, and combustion, was at the first contemptible.
            There was a subtill Priest called RICHARD SIMON, that liued in Oxford, and had to his Pupill a Bakers sonne named LAMBERT SIMNELL, of the age of some fifteene yeares; a comely Youth, and weli fauoured, not without some extraordinarie dignitie and grace of aspect. It came into this Priests fancie (hearing what men talked, and in hope to raise himselfe to some great Bishopricke) to cause this Lad to counterseit and personate the second sonne of EDWARD the Fourth, supposed to be murdered; and afterward (for he changed his intention in the manage) the Lord EDWARD PLANTAGENET then prisoner in the Tower, and accordingly to frame him and instruct him in the Part hee was to play. This is that which (as was touched before) seemeth scarcely credible; Not that a False person should be assumed to gaine a Kingdome, for it hath beene seene in ancient and late times; nor that it should come into the mind of such an abiect Fellow, to enterprise so great a matter; for high Conceits doe sometimes come streaming into the Imaginations of base persons, especially when they are drunke with Newes, and talke of the people. But heere is that which hath no apparance; That this Priest being vtterly vnacquainted with the true Person, according to whose patterne hee should shape his Counterfeit, should thinke it possible for him to instruct his Player, either in gesture and fashions, or in recounting past matters of his life and

education; or in fit answers to questions, or the like, any wayes to come neare the resemblance of him whom hee was to represent. For this Lad was not to personate one, that had beene long before taken out of his Cradle, or conueighed away in his infancie, knowne to few; but a Youth that till the age almost of ten yeares had beene brought vp in a Court where infinite eyes had beene vpon him. For King EDWARD touched with remorse of his brother the Duke of Clarences death, would not indeed restore his sonne, (of whom wee speake) to bee Duke of Clarence, but yet created him Earle of Warwicke, reuiuing his honour on the mothers side, and vsed him honourably during his time, though RICHARD the Third afterwards confined him. So that it cannot bee, but that some great Person, that knew particularly, and familiarly EDWARD PLANTAGENET, had a hand in the businesse, from whom the Priest might take his ayme. That which is most probable, out of the precedent and subsequent Acts, is, that it was the Queene Dowager, from whom this action had the principall source and motion. For certaine it is, shee was a busie negotiating woman, and in her withdrawing Chamber had the fortunate Conspiracie for the King against King RICHARD the Third, beene hatched; which the King knew, and remembred perhaps but too well; and was at this time extremely discontent with the King, thinking her daughter (as the King handled the matter) not aduanced, but depressed: and none could hold the Booke so well to prompt and instruct this Stage-Play, as she could. Neuerthelesse it was not her meaning, nor no more was it the meaning of any of the better and sager sort that fauoured this Enterprise and knew the Secret, that this disguised Idoll should possesse the Crowne; but at his perill to make way to the Ouerthrow

of the King: and that done, they had their seuerall Hopes and Waies. That which doth chiefly fortifie this Coniecture, is, that as soone as the matter brake forth in any strength, it was one of the Kings first Acts to cloister the Queene Dowager in the Nunnery of Bermondsey, and to take away all her lands and estate; and this by close Councell without any legall proceeding, vpon farre-fetcht Pretences; That shee had deliuered her two daughters out of Sanctuarie to King RICHARD contrarie to promise. Which Proceeding being euen at that time taxed for rigorous and vndue, both in matter and maner; makes it very probable there was some greater matter against her, which the King vpon reason of Policie, and to auoid enuy would not publish. It is likewise no small argument that there was some secret in it, and some suppressing of Examinations; for that the Priest SIMON himselfe, after hee was taken was neuer brought to execution; no not so much as to publike Triall (as many Clergiemen were vpon lesse Treasons) but was only shut vp close in a Dungeon. Adde to this that the after Earle of Lincolne (a principall Person of the House of YORKE) was slaine in Stoke-field, the King opened himselfe to some of his Councell, that he was sorie for the Earles death, because by him (hee said) hee might haue knowne the bottome of his danger.
            But to returne to the Narration it selfe; SIMON did first instruct his Scholler for the part of RICHARD Duke of Yorke, second sonne to King EDWARD the Fourth, and this was at such time as it was voiced that the King purposed to put to death EDWARD PLANTAGENET prisoner in the Tower, whereat there was great murmur. But hearing soone after a generall bruit that PLANTAGENET had escaped out of the Tower, and thereby finding him so much beloued amongst the people, and such reioycing at

his Escape, the cunning Priest changed his Copie, and chose now PLANTAGENET to bee the Subiect his Pupill should personate, because hee was more in the present speech, and votes of the people; and it pieced better, and followed more close and handsomley vpon the bruit of PLANTAGENETS escape. But yet doubting that there would bee too neare looking and too much Perspectiue into his Disguise, if hee should shew it here in England, hee thought good (after the manner of Scenes in Stage-Playes and Maskes) to shew it a farre of; and therfore sailed with his Scholler into Ireland, where the Affection to the House of YORKE was most in height. The King had beene a little improuident in the matters of Ireland, and had not remoued Officers and Councellors, and put in their places, or at least intermingled persons, of whom hee stood assured, as he should haue done, since hee knew the strong Bent of that Countrey towards the House of YORKE; and that it was a ticklish and vnsetled State, more easie to receiue distempers and mutations, then England was. But trusting to the reputation of his Victories and Successes in England, hee thought hee should haue time enough to extend his Cares afterwards to that second Kingdome.
            Wherefore through this neglect, vpon the comming of SIMON with his pretended PLANTAGENET into Ireland, all things were prepared for Reuolt and Sedition, almost as if they had beene set and plotted before hand. SIMONS first addresse was to the Lord THOMAS FITZ-GERARD, Earle of Kildare, and Deputie of Ireland: before whose Eyes hee did cast such a Mist (by his owne insinuation, and by the carriage of his Youth, that expressed a naturall Princely behauiour) as ioyned perhaps with some inward Vapours of Ambition and Affection in the Earles owne minde, left him

fully possessed, that it was the true PLANTAGENET. The Earle presently communicated the matter with some of the Nobles and others there, at the first secretly. But finding them of like affection to himselfe, hee suffered it of purpose to vent and passe abroad; because they thought it not safe to resolue, till they had a taste of the Peoples inclination. But if the Great ones were in forwardnesse, the People were in furie, entertayning this Airie bodie or Phantasme with incredible affection; partly out of their great deuotion to the House of YORKE; partly out of a proud humour in the Nation, to giue a King to the Realme of England. Neither did the Partie in this heat of affection much trouble themselues with the Attaindor of GEORGE Duke of Clarence; hauing newly learned by the Kings example, that Attaindors doe not interrupt the conueighing of Title to the Crowne. And as for the daughters of King EDWARD the Fourth, they thought King RICHARD had said enough for them: and tooke them to bee but as of the Kings Partie, because they were in his power and at his disposing. So that with maruellous consent and applause, this Counterfeit PLANTAGENET was brought with great solemnitie to the Castle of Dublin, and there saluted, serued, and honoured as King; the Boy becoming it well, and doing nothing that did bewray the basenesse of his condition. And within a few dayes after hee was proclaimed King in Dublin, by the name of King EDWARD the Sixt; there beeing not a sword drawne in King HENRY his quarrell.
            The King was much moued with this vnexpected accident, when it came to his eares, both because it strooke vpon that String which euer he most feared, as also because it was stirred in such a Place, where hee could not with safetie transferre his owne person, to

suppresse it. For partly through naturall valour, and partly through an vniuersall suspition (not knowing whom to trust) he was euer readie to wait vpon all his atchieuements in person. The King therefore first called his Councell together at the Charter-house at Shine. Which Councell was held with great secrecie, but the open Decrees thereof, which presently came abroad, were three.
            The first was, that the Queene Dowager, for that she, contrarie to her Pact, and Agreement with those that had concluded with her concerning the Mariage of her daughter ELIZABETH with King HENRY, had neuerthelesse deliuered her daughters out of Sanctuarie into King RICHARDS hands; should be cloistered in the Nunnerie of Bermondsey, and forfeit all her lands and goods.
            The next was, that EDWARD PLANTAGENET then Close-prisoner in the Tower, should be in the most publike and notorious manner, that could be deuised, shewed vnto the people: In part to discharge the King of the Enuie of that opinion and bruit, how he had beene put to death priuily in the Tower; But chiefly to make the people see the leuitie and imposture of the proceedings of Ireland, and that their PLANTAGENET was indeed but a puppit, or a Counterfeit.
            
            The third was, that there should be againe proclaimed a Generall-Pardon to all that would reueale their offences, and submit themselues by a day. And that this Pardon should be conceiued in so ample and liberall a manner, as no High-Treason (no not against the Kings owne person) should be excepted. Which though it might seeme strange, yet was it not so to a wise King, that knew his greatest dangers were not from the least Treasons, but from the greatest. These resolutions of the King and his Councell were immediatly

put in execution. And first, the Queene Dowager was put into the Monasterie of Bermondsey, and all her estate seized into the Kings hands, whereat there was much wondering; That a weake woman, for the yeelding to the menaces and promises of a Tyrant, after such a distance of time (wherein the King had shewed no displeasure nor alteration) but much more after so happie a mariage, betweene the King and her Daughter, blessed with Issue-male, should vpon a sodaine mutabilitie or disclosure of the Kings mind be so seuerely handled.
            This Lady was amongst the examples of great varietie of Fortune. Shee had first from a distressed Suitor, and desolate Widdow, beene taken to the Mariage-Bed of a Batchellour-King, the goodliest personage of his time; and euen in his reigne she had endured a strange Eclipse by the Kings flight, and temporarie depriuing from the Crowne. Shee was also very happie, in that she had by him faire Issue, and continued his Nuptiall loue (helping her selfe by some obsequious bearing and dissembling of his pleasures) to the very end. Shee was much affectionate to her owne Kindred, euen vnto Faction; which did stirre great Enuie in the Lords of the Kings side, who counted her Bloud a disparagement to be mingled with the Kings. With which Lords of the Kings bloud, ioyned also the Kings Fauorite the Lord HASTINGS; who, notwithstanding the Kings great affection to him, was thought at times, through her malice and Splene, not to be out of danger of falling. After her husbands death, she was matter of Tragedie, hauing liued to see her Brother beheaded, and her two Sonnes deposed from the Crowne, Bastarded in their bloud, and cruelly murthered. All this while neuerthelesse shee inioyed her libertie, State, and Fortunes. But afterwards againe, vpon the Rise of the

               Wheele, when she had a King to her Sonne-in-Law, and was made Grand mother to a Grand-child of the best Sexe; yet was she (vpon darke and vnknowne Reasons, and no lesse strange Pretences) precipitated, and banished the World, into a Nunnery; where it was almost thought dangerous to visit her, or see her; and where not long after she ended her life: but was by the Kings Commandement buried with the King her husband at Windsore. Shee was Foundresse of Queenes-College in Cambridge. For this Act the King sustained great obloquie, which neuerthelesse (besides the reason of State) was somwhat sweetned to him by a great Confiscation.
            
            About this time also EDWARD PLANTAGENET was vpon a Sonday brought throughout all the principall Streets of London, to be seene of the people. And hauing passed the view of the Streets, was conducted to PAVLS Church, in solemne Procession, where great store of people were assembled. And it was prouided also in good fashion, that diuers of the Nobilitie, and others of Qualitie (especially of those that the King most suspected, and knew the person of PLANTAGENET best) had communication with the young Gentleman by the way, and entertayned him with speech and discourse; which did in effect marre the Pageant in Ireland with the Subiects here, atleast with so many, as out of error, and not out of malice, might be mis-led. Neuerthelesse, in Ireland (where it was too late to goe backe) it wrought little or no effect. But contrarivvise, they turned the Imposture vpon the King, and gaue out, That the King, to defeat the true Inheritor, and to mocke the World, and blinde the eyes of simple man, had tricked vp a Boy in the likenesse of EDWARDPLANTAGENET, and shewed him to the people, not sparing to prophane the Ceremony of a Procession, the more to countenance the Fable.
            
            
               
The Generall-Pardon likewise neere the same time came forth; and the King therewithall omitted no diligence, in giuing straight order, for the keeping of the Ports; that Fugitiues, Male-contents, or suspected Persons might not passe ouer into Ireland, and Flanders.
            
            Meane while the Rebels in Ireland had sent priuie Messengers both into England, and into Flanders, who in both places had wrought effects of no small importance. For in England they wonne to their Partie IOHN, Earle of Lincolne, sonne of IOHN DE LAPOLE, Duke of Suffolke, and of ELIZABETH, King EDWARD the Fourths eldest sister. This Earle was a man of great wit and courage, and had his thoughts highly raysed by Hopes and Expectations for a time. For RICHARD the third had a Resolution, out of his hatred to both his Brethren, King EDWARD, and the Duke of Clarence, and their Lines, (hauing had his hand in both their blouds) to disable their Issues vpon false and incompetent pretexts; the one, of Attaindor; the other, of Illegitimation: and to designe this Gentleman (in case himselfe should die without Children) for Inheritor of the Crowne. Neither was this vnknowne to the King, who had secretly an Eye vpon him. But the King hauing tasted of the Enuie of the people, for his imprisonment of EDWARD PLANTAGENET, was doubtfull to heape vp any more distasts of that kind, by the imprisonment of DE LAPOLE also; the rather thinking it Policie to conserue him as a Corriuall vnto the other. The Earle of Lincolne was induced to participate with the Action of Ireland, not lightly vpon the strength of the Proceedings there, which was but a Bubble, but vpon Letters from the Lady MARGARET of Burgundie, in whose succours and declaration for the Enterprise; there seemed to be a more solid foundation, both for Reputation

and Forces. Neither did the Earle refraine the Businesse, for that he knew the pretended PLANTAGENET to be but an Idoll. But contrariwise, hee was more glad it should be the false PLANTAGENET then the true: because the False being sure to fall away of himselfe, and the True to be made sure of by the King; it might open and paue a faire and prepared way to his owne Title. With this Resolution hee sayled secretly into Flanders; where was a little before arriued the Lord LOVEL, leauing a correspondence here in England with Sir THOMAS BROVGHTON, a man of great Power and Dependencies in Lancashire. For before this time, when the pretended PLANTAGENET was first receiued in Ireland, secret Messengers had beene also sent to the Lady MARGARET, aduertising her what was passed in Ireland, imploring Succoures in an Enterprise (as they said) so pious and iust, and that God had so miraculously prospered the beginning therof; and making offer, that all things should be guided by her will and direction, as the Soueraigne Patronesse and Protectresse of the Enterprise. MARGARET was second sister to King EDWARD the Fourth, and had beene second Wife to CHARLES, surnamed the HARDY, Duke of Burgundie; by whome, hauing no Children of her owne, she did with singular care and tendernesse intend the Education of PHILIP and MARGARET, Grand-children to her former Husband; which wonne her great loue and authority among the Dutch. This Princesse (hauing the Spirit of a Man, and Malice of a woman) abounding in Treasure, by the greatnesse of her Dower, and her prouident Gouernment, and being childlesse, and without any neerer Care, made it her Designe and Enterprise, to see the Maiestie Royall of England once againe re-placed in her House, and had set vp King HENRY as a Marke, at whose

ouerthrow all her actions should ayme and shoote; insomuch as all the Counsells of his succeeding troubles came chiefly out of that Quiuer. And shee bare such a mortall hatred to the House of LANCASTER, and personally to the King, as she was no wayes mollified by the Coniunction of the Houses in her Neeces marriage, but rather hated her Neece, as the meanes of the Kings ascent to the Crowne, and assurance therein. Wherefore with great violence of affection she embraced this Ouerture. And vpon Counsaile taken with the Earle of Lincolne, and the Lord LOVEL, and some other of the Partie, it was resolued with all speed, the two Lords assisted with a Regiment of two thousand Almaines, being choice and Veterane Bands, vnder the command of MARTIN SWART (a valiant and experimented Captaine) should passe ouer into Ireland to the new King. Hoping, that when the Action should haue the face of a receiued and setled Regalitie (with such a second Person, as the Earle of Lincolne, and the Coniunction and reputation of forraine succours) the fame of it would imbolden and prepare all the Partie of the Confederates and Malecontents within the Realme of England, to giue them assistance, when they should come ouer there. And for the Person of the Counterfeit, it was agreed, that if all things succeeded well, he should be put downe, and the true PLANTAGENET receiued: Wherein neuerthelesse the Earle of Lincolne had his particular hopes. After they were come into Ireland, and that the Partie tooke courage, by seeing themselues together in a Bodie, they grew very confident of successe, conceiuing and discoursing amongst themselues, that they went in vpon farre better Cards to ouerthrow King HENRY, then King HENRY had to ouerthrow King RICHARD. And that if there were not a Sword drawne against them in Ireland, it

was a Signe the Swords in England would be soone sheathed, or beaten downe. And first, for a Brauery vpon this accession of power, they crowned their new King in the Cathedrall Church of Dublin; who formerly had beene but proclaimed onely; and then sate in Councell what should further be done. At which Councell though it were propounded by some, that it were the best way to establish themselues first in Ireland, and to make that the Seat of the Warre, and to draw King HENRY thither in person, by whose absence, they thought there would be great alterations and commotions in England, yet because the Kingdome there was poore, and they should not be able to keepe their Armie together, nor pay their Germane. Soldiers, and for that also the sway of the Irish-men and generally of the Men-of-warre, which (as in such cases of Popular tumults is vsuall) did in effect gouerne their Leaders, was eager, and in affection to make their fortunes vpon England; It was concluded with all possible speed to transport their forces into England. The King in the meane time, who at the first when he heard what was done in Ireland, though it troubled him, yet thought hee should bee well enough able to scatter the Irish as a Flight of Birds, and rattle away this Swarme of Bees, with their King; when hee heard afterwards that the Earle of Lincolne was embarqued in the action, and that the Lady MARGARET was declared for it, he apprehended the danger in a true Degree as it was, and saw plainly that his Kingdome must againe be put to the Stake, and that he must fight for it. And first, he did conceiue, before he vnderstood of the Earle of Lincolnes sayling into Ireland out of Flanders, that he should be assailed both vpon the East-parts of the Kingdome of England by some impression from Flanders, and vpon the North-west out of Ireland. And therefore

hauing ordered Musters to be made in both Parts, and hauing prouisionally designed two Generals, IASPER Earle of Bedford, and IOHN Earle of Oxford, (meaning himselfe also to goe in person, where the Affaires should most require it) and neuerthelesse not expecting any actuall Inuasion at that time (the Winter being farre on) he tooke his iourney himselfe towards Suffolke and Northfolke, for the confirming of those parts. And being come to S. Edmonds-bury, hee vnderstood, that THOMAS, Marquesse Dorset (who had beene one of the Pledges in France) was hasting towards him, to purge himselfe of some Accusations which had beene made against him. But the King, though hee kept an Eare for him, yet was the time so doubtfull, that hee sent the Earle of Oxford to meet him, and forth with to carry him to the Tower; with a faire Message neuerthelesse, that hee should beare that disgrace with patience, for that the King meant not his hurt, but onely to preserue him from doing hurt, either to the Kings seruice, or to himselfe; and that the King should alwayes be able (when hee had cleared himselfe) to make him reparation.
            From S. Edmonds-bury he went to Norwich, where he kept his Christmas. And from thence he went (in a manner of Pilgrimage) to Walsingham, where hee visited our Ladies Church, famous for miracles, and made his Prayers and Vowes for helpe and deliuerance. And from thence he returned by Cambridge to London. Not long after, the Rebels, with their King (vnder the Leading of the Earle of Lincolne, the Earle of Kildare, the Lord LOVEL, and Colonell SWART) landed at Fouldrey in Lancashire, whither there repaired to them, Sir THOMAS BROVGHTON, with some small companie of English. The King by that time (knowing now the Storme would not diuide, but fall in one place) had leuied Forces in good

number; And in person (taking with him his two designed Generals, the Duke of Bedford, and the Earle of Oxford) was come on his way towards them as farre as Couentry, whence he sent forth a troupe of Light-Horsemen for discouerie, and to intercept some straglers of the Enemies, by whom he might the better vnderstand the particulars of their Progresse and purposes, which was accordingly done; though the King otherwise was not without intelligence from Espials in the Campe.
            
            The Rebels tooke their way towards Yorke, without spoyling the Countrie, or any act of Hostilitie, the better to put themselues into fauour of the people, and to personate their King: who (no doubt, out of a princely feeling) was sparing, and compassionate towards his Subiects. But their Snowball did not gather as it went. For the people came not in to them: Neither did any rise or declare themselues in other parts of the Kingdome for them, which was caused partly by the good taste that the King had giuen his People of his Gouernement, ioyned with the reputation of his Felicitie; and partly for that it was an odious thing to the people of England, to haue a King brought in to them vpon the shoulders of Irish and Dutch, of which their Armie was in substance compounded. Neither was it a thing done with any great iudgement on the Party of the Rebels, for them to take their way towards Yorke: Considering that howsoeuer those parts had formerly beene a Nurserie of their friends; yet it was there, where the Lord LOVEL had so lately disbanded, and where the Kings presence had a little before qualified discontents. The Earle of Lincolne deceiued of his hopes of the Countries concourse vnto him (in which case he would haue temporized) and seeing the businesse past Retract, resolued to make on where the King was,

and to giue him battaile; and therupon, marched towards Newarke, thinking to haue surprized the Towne. But the King was somewhat before this time come to Nottingham, where he called a Councell of Warre, at which was consulted, whether it were best to protract time, or speedily to set vpon the Rebels. In which Councell the King himselfe (whose continuall vigilancie did sucke in sometimes causelesse suspitions, which few else knew) inclined to the accelerating a Battaile. But this was presently put out of doubt, by the great aides that came in to him in the instant of this Consultation, partly vpon Missiues, and partly Voluntaries from many parts of the Kingdome.
            The principall persons that came then to the Kings aide, were the Earle of Shrewesburie, and the Lord STRANGE, of the Nobilitie: and of Knights and Gentlemen to the number of at least threescore and tenne persons, with their Companies, making in the whole, at the least six thousand fighting men, besides the Forces that were with the King before. Wherupon the King, finding his Armie so brauely re-enforced, and a great alacritie in all his men to fight, was confirmed in his former resolution, and marched speedily, so as hee put himselfe betweene the Enemies Campe and Newarke; being loth their Armie should get the commoditie of that Towne. The Earle nothing dismayed, came forwards that day vnto a little Village called Stoke, and there encamped that night, vpon the Brow or hanging of a hill. The King the next day presented him Battaile vpon the Plaine, the fields there being open and champion. The Earle couragiously came downe and ioyned Battaile with him. Concerning which Battaile, the relations that are left vnto vs are so naked, and negligent (though it be an action of so

recent memorie) as they rather declare the Successe of the day, then the Manner of the fight. They say, that the King diuided his Armie into three Battailes, whereof the vant-guard onely well strengthened with wings, came to fight. That the Fight was fierce and obstinate, and lasted three houres, before the victorie inclined either way; saue that Iudgement might be made, by that the Kings Vant-guard of it selfe maintained fight against the whole Power of the Enemies, (the other two Battailes remaining out of action) what the successe was like to bee in the end. That MARTIN SWART with his Germanes performed brauely; and so did those few English that were on that side, neither did the Irish faile in courage or fiercenesse, but being almost naked men, only armed with Darts and Skeines, it was rather an Execution, then a fight vpon them; insomuch as the furious slaughter of them was a great discouragement and appalement to the rest; That there died vpon the place all the Chiefetaines; That is, the Earle of Lincolne, the Earle of Kildare, FRANCIS Lord LOVEL, MARTIN SWART, and Sir THOMAS BROVGHTON; all making good the fight without any ground giuen. Onely of the Lord LOVEL there went a report, that he fled and swam ouer Trent on horsebacke, but could not recouer the further side, by reason of the steepnesse of the Banke, and so was drowned in the Riuer. But another Report leaues him not there, but that he liued long after in a Caue or Vault. The number that was slaine in the field, was of the Enemies part, foure thousand at the least; and of the Kings part, one halfe of his Vant-guard, besides many hurt, but none of name. There were taken prisoners amongst others, the Counterfet PLANTAGENET (now, LAMBERT SIMNELL againe) and the crastie Priest his Tutor. For LAMBERT, the King

would not take his life, both out of Magnanimitie, taking him but as an Image of Wax, that others had tempered and moulded; and likewise out of wisdome, thinking that if he suffered death, he would be forgotten too soone; but being kept aliue, he would be a continuall Spectacle, and a kind of remedie against the like Inchantments of People, in time to come. For which cause hee was taken into seruice in his Court to a base office in his Kitchin; so that (in a kind of Mattacina of humane fortune) Hee turned a Broach, that had worne a Crowne. Whereas Fortune commonly doth not bring in a Comedie or Farce after a Tragedy. And afterwards hee was preferred to be one of the Kings Falconers. As to the Priest, he was committed Close prisoner, and heard of no more; the King louing to seale vp his owne dangers.
            After the Battaile, the King went to Lincolne, where he caused Supplications and Thanksgiuings to be made for his Deliuerance and Victorie. And that his Deuotions might goe round in Circle, he sent his Banner to bee offered to our Ladie of Walsingham, where before he made his Vows. And thus deliuered of this so strange an Engine &amp; new Inuention of Fortune, he returned to his former confidence of minde, thinking now, that all his misfortunes had come at once. But it fell out vnto him according to the Speech of the Common people in the beginning of his reigne, that said; It was a token he should reigne in labour, because his reigne began with a sicknesse of Sweat. But howsoeuer the King thought himselfe now in a Hauen, yet such was his wisdome, as his Confidence did seldome darken his Fore-sight, especially in things neare hand. And therefore awakened by so fresh, and vnexpected dangers, hee entred into due consideration, aswell how to weed out the Partakers of the former Rebellion, as to kill the Seeds of the like in time to come:

and withall to take away all Shelters and Harbours for discontented Persons, where they might hatch and foster Rebellions, which afterwards might gather strength and motion. And first, he did yet againe make a Progresse from Lincolne to the Northerne Parts, though it were indeed rather an Itinerarie Circuit of Iustice, then a Progresse. For all along as he went, with much seueritie and strict inquisition, partly by Martiall Law, and partly by Commission, were punished, the Adherents, and Ayders of the late Rebels. Not all by death, (for the Field had drawne much bloud) but by Fines and Ransomes which spared Life, and raised Treasure. Amongst other Crimes of this nature, there was diligent Inquirie made of such as had raised and dispersed abruit and rumour, a little before the Field fought, That the Rebels had the day; and that the Kings Armie was ouerthrowne, and the King fled. Whereby it was supposed that many Succours, which otherwise would haue come vnto the King, were cunningly put off, and kept backe. Which Charge and Accusation, though it had some ground, yet it was industriously embraced and put on by diuers, who hauing beene in themselues not the best affected to the Kings part, nor forward to come to his aid, were glad to apprehend this colour, to couer their neglect and coldnesse, vnder the pretence of such discouragements. Which cunning neuerthelesse, the King would not vnderstand, though he lodged it, and noted it in some particulars, as his manner was.
            But for the extirpating of the Roots and causes of the like Commotions in time to come, the King began to find where his Shooe did wring him, and that it was his depressing of the House of YORKE, that did rancle and fester the affections of his People. And therefore being now too wise to disdaine perils any longer, and willing to giue some concentment in

that kind (at least in Ceremonie) he resolued at last to proceed to the Coronation of his Queene. And therefore at his comming to London, where he entred in state, and in a kind of Triumph, and celebrated his Victorie, with two dayes of Deuotion, (for the first day he repaired to Pauls, and had the Hymne of Te Deum sung, and the morrow after he went in Procession, and heard the Sermon at the Crosse) the Queene was with great solemnitie crowned at Westminster, the fiue and twentieth of Nouember, in the third yeare of his reigne, which was about two yeares after the marriage; Like an old Christning, that had stayed long for Godfathers. Which strange and vnvsuall distance of time, madeit subiect to euery mans note, that it was an Act against his stomacke, and put vpon him by necessitie and reason of State. Soone after, to shew that it was now faire weather againe, and that the imprisonment of THOMAS Marquesse Dorset, was rather vpon suspicion of the Time, then of the man, hee the said Marquesse was set at libertie without examination, or other circumstance. At that time also the King sent an Ambassadour vnto Pope INNOCENT, signifying vnto him this his Marriage, and that now (like another AENEAS) he had passed through the flouds of his former troubles and trauailes, and was arriued vnto a safe Hauen: and thanking his Holinesse, that he had honoured the Celebration of his Marriage with the presence of his Ambassadour: and offering both his Person and the forces of his Kingdome vpon all occasions to doe him seruice.
            The Ambassadour making his Oration to the Pope, in the presence of the Cardinals, did so magnifie the King and Queene, as was enough to glut the Hearers. But then he did againe so exroll and deifie the Pope, as made all that he had said in praise of his Master and

               Mistresse seeme temperate and passable. But hee was very honourably entertained, and extreamly much made on by the Pope. Who knowing himselfe to bee Lazie and vnprofitable to the Christian world, was wonderfully glad to heare that there were such Ecchoes of him sounding in remote parts. Hee obtained also of the Pope a very iust and honorable Bull, qualifying the Priuiledges of Sanctuarie (wherewith the king had beene extreamely gauled) in three points.
            The first, that if any Sanstuarie man did by night or otherwise, get out of Sanctuarie priuily, and commit mischiefe and trespasse, and then come in againe, hee should lose the benefit of Sanctuarie for euer after. The second, that howsoeuer the Person of the Sanctuarie-man was protected from his Creditors, yet his Goods out of Sanctuarie should not. The third, that if any tooke Sanstuarie for case of Treason, the King might appoint him Keepers to looke to him in Sanctuarie.
            
            The King also for the better securing of his estate, against mutinous and malecontented Subiects (wherof He saw the Realme was full) who might haue their refuge into Scotland, which was not vnder Key, as the Ports were; For that cause, rather then for any doubt of Hostilitie from those parts, before his comming to London (when he was at Newcastle) had sent a solemne Ambassage vnto IAMES the third, King of Scotland, to treate and conclude a peace with him. The Ambassadors were RICHARD FOXE Bishop of Excester, and Sir RICHARD EDGCOMBE Comptroller of the Kings House, who were honourably receiued and entertained there. But the King of Scotland labouring of the same disease that King HENRY did (though more mortall, as afterwards appeared) that is, Discontented Subiects, apt to rise, and raise Tumuh, although

in his owne affection hee did much desire to make a Peace with the King; Yet finding his Nobles auerse, and not daring to displease them, concluded onely a Truce for seuen yeeres; giuing neuerthelesse promise in priuate, that it should bee renewed from time to time, during the two Kings liues.
            
               HItherto the King had beene exercised in setling his affaires at home. But about this time brake forth an occasion that drew him to looke abroad, and to hearken to forraine businesse. CHARLES the eight the French King, by the vertue and good fortune of his two immediate Predecessors, CHARLES the seuenth his Grand-father, and LEWES the eleuenth his Father, receiued the Kingdome of France in more flourishing and spread Estate, than it had beene of many yeares before; being redintegrate in those principall Members, which anciently had beene portions of the Crowne of France, and were after disseuered, so as they remained onely in Homage, and not in Soueraigntie (being gouerned by absolute Princes of their owne) Angeou, Normandy, Prouence, and Burgundie. There remained only Brittaine to be revnited, and so the Monarchie of France to be reduced to the ancient Termes and Bounds.
            King CHARLES was not a little inflamed with an ambition to repurchase, and reannex that Duchie. Which his ambition was a wise and well weighed Ambition; not like vnto the ambitions of his succeeding enterprizes of Italie. For at that time being newly come to the Crowne, he was somewhat guided by his Fathers Counsels (Counsels, not Counsellors) for his Father was his owne Counsell, and had few able men about him. And that King (be knew well) had euer distasted the designes of Italie, and in particular had an eye vpon Brittaine. There were many circumstances

that did feed the ambition of CHARLES, with pregnant and apparant hopes of Successe. The Duke of Britaine old, and entred into a Lethargie, and serued with Mercenarie Counsellors, father of two only daughters, the one sickly and not like to continue. King CHARLES himselfe in the flower of his age, and the Subiects of France at that time well trayned for Warre, both for Leaders and Souldiers; men of seruice being not yet worne out, since the warres of LEWIS against Burgundie. Hee found himselfe also in peace with all his Neighbour-Princes. As for those that might oppose to his enterprise; MAXIMILIAN King of Romans, his Riuall in the same desires, (as well for the Duchy, as the Daughter) feeble in meanes; and King HENRY of England aswell somwhat obnoxious to him for his fauours and benefits, as busied in his particular noubles at home. There was also a faire and specious occasion offered him to hide his ambition, and to iustifie his warring vpon Britaine, for that the Duke had receiued, and succoured LEWIS Duke of Orleance, and other of the French Nobilitie, which had taken Armes against their King. Wherfore King CHARLES being resolued vpon that Warre, knew well he could not receiue any opposition so potent, as if King HENRY should either vpon Policie of State, in preuenting the growing greatnesse of France: or vpon gratitude vnto the Duke of Britaine, for his former fauours, in the time of his distresse, espouse that quarrell, and declare himselfe in aide of the Duke. Therfore hee no sooner heard that King HENRY was setled by his victorie, but forth with he sent Ambassadours vnto him, to pray his assistance, or at the least that hee would stand neutrall. Which Ambassadours found the King at Leicester, and deliuered their Ambassage to this effect. They first imparted vnto the King the successe that

their Master had had a little before against MAXIMILIAN, in recouerie of certaine Townes from him: which was done in a kind of priuacie, and inwardnesse towards the King; as if the French-king did not esteeme him for an outward or formall Confederate, but as one that had part in his affections and fortunes, and with whom he tooke pleasure to communicate his businesse. After this Complement, and some gratulation for the Kings victorie, they fell to their errand; declaring to the King, that their Master was enforced to enter into a iust and necessarie Warre with the Duke of Britaine, for that hee had receiued and succoured those that were Traitors, and Declared Enemies vnto his Person and State. That they were no meane, distressed, and calamitous Persons that fled to him for refuge, but of so great qualitie, as it was apparant that they came not thither to protect their owne fortune, but to infest and inuade his; the Head of them being the Duke of Orleance, the first Prince of the bloud, and the second Person of France. That therfore, rightly to vnderstand it, it was rather on their Masters part a Defensiue Warre, then an Offensiue; as that, that could not bee omitted or forborne, if he tendred the conseruation of his owne Estate; and that it was not the first Blow that made the Warre inuasiue, (for that no wise Prince would stay for) but the first Prouocation, or at least the first Preparation. Nay that this Warre was rather a Suppression of Rebels, then a Warre with a iust Enemie, where the case is; That his Subiects, Traitors, are receiued by the Duke of Britaine his Homager. That King HENRY knew well what went vpon it in example, if Neighbour-Princes should patronize and comfort Rebels, against the Law of Nations and of Leagues. Neuerthelesse that their Master was not ignorant, that the King had beene beholding to the

               Duke of Britaine in his aduersitie; as on the other side, they knew he would not forget also the readinesse of their King, in ayding him when the Duke of Britaine, or his mercenary Councellors failed him, and would haue betrayed him; And that there was a great difference betweene the courtesies receiued from their Master, and the Duke of Britaine; for that the Dukes might haue ends of vtilitie and Bargaine; whereas their Masters could not haue proceeded but out of entire Affection. For that, if it had beene measured by a politicke line, it had beene better for his affaires, that a Tyrant should haue reigned in England, troubled and hated, then such a Prince, whose vertues could not saile to make him great and potent, whensoeuer he was come to be Master of his affaires. But howsoeuer it stood for the point of obligation, which the King might owe to the Duke of Britaine, yet their Master was well assured, it would not diuert King HENRY of England from doing that, that was iust, nor euer embarke him in so ill grounded a quarrell. Therefore, since this Warre which their Master was now to make, was but to deliuer himselfe from imminent dangers, their King hoped the King would shew the like affection to the conseruation of their Masters estate, as their Master had (when time was) shewed to the Kings acquisition of his Kingdome. At the least, that according to the inclination which the King had euer professed of peace, he would looke on, and stand Neutrall; for that their Master could not with reason presse him to vndertake part in the Warre, being so newly setled and recouered from intestine seditions. But touching the Mysterie of reannexing of the Duchy of Britaine to the Crowne of France, either by Warre, or by marriage with the Daughter of Britaine; the Ambassadors bare aloofe from it, as from a Rocke, knowing that it made most against them. And therefore by all

meanes declined any mention thereof, but contrariwise interlaced in their conference with the King, the assured purpose of their Master, to match with the Daughter of MAXIMILIAN; And entertained the King also with some wandring Discourses of their Kings purpose, to recouer by Armes his right to the Kingdome of Naples, by an expedition in Person; All to remoue the King from all iealousie of any Designe, in these hither Parts vpon Britaine, otherwise then for quenching of the fire, which hee feared might bee kindled in his owne estate.
            The King after aduice taken with his Coùncell, made answer to the Ambassadors. And first returned their Complement, shewing hee was right glad of the French Kings reception of those Townes from MAXIMILIAN. Then hee familiarly related some particular passages of his owne aduentures and victorie passed. As to the businesse of Britaine, the King answered in few words; That the French King and the Duke of Britaine, were the two persons to whom hee was most obliged of all men; and that hee should thinke himselfe very vnhappie, if things should goe so betweene them, as he should not be able to acquite himselfe in gratitude towards them both; and that there was no meanes for him as a Christian King and a Common friend to them, to satisfie all obligations both to God and Man, but to offer himselfe for a Mediator of an Accord and Peace betweene them; by which course he doubted not but their Kings estate and honour both, would be preserued with more Safetie and lesse Enuis then by a Warre, and that hee would spare no cost or paines, no if it were To goe on Pilgrimage, for so good an effect; And concluded, that in this great Affaire, which he tooke so much to heart, hee would expresse himselfe more fully by an Ambassage, which he would speedily dispatch vnto the French King for that purpose.

And in this sort the French Ambassadors were dismissed; The King auoiding to vnderstand any thing touching the re-annexing of Britaine, as the Ambassadors had auoided to mention it; saue that hee gaue a little touch of it in the word, Enuie. And so it was, that the King was neither so shallow, nor so ill aduertised, as not to perceiue the intention of the French, for the inuesting himselfe of Britaine. But first he was vtterly vnwilling (howsoeuer hee gaue out) to enter into Warre with France. A Fame of a Warre he liked well, but not an Atchieuement; for the one hee thought would make him Richer, and the other Poorer: and hee was possessed with many secret feares, touching his owne people, which hee was therfore loth to arme, and put weapons into their hands. Yet notwithstanding (as a prudent and couragious Prince) he was not so auerse from a Warre, but that he was resolued to choose it, rather then to haue Britaine carried by France, being so great and opulent a Duchy, and situate so opportunely to annoy England, either for Coast, or Trade. But the Kings hopes were, that partly by negligence, commonly imputed to the French (especially in the Court of a young King) and partly by the natiue power of Britaine it selfe, which was not small; but chiefely in respect of the great Partie, that the Duke of Orleance had in the Kingdome of France, and therby meanes to stirre vp Ciuill troubles, to diuert the French-king from the enterprise of Britaine: And lastly, in regard of the power of MAXIMILIAN, who was Corriuall to the French King in that Pursuit, the Enterprize would eyther bow to a pace, or breake in it selfe. In all which, the King measured and valued things amisse, as afterwards appeared. He sent therefore forth with to the French King, CHRISTOPHER VRSWICKE, his Chaplaine, a person by him much trusted and imployed: choosing him the rather, because

he was a Church-man, as best sorting with an Ambassie of Pacification: and giuing him also a Commission, That if the French King consented to treat, hee should thence repaire to the Duke of Britaine, and ripen the Treatie on both parts. VRSWICK made declaration to the French King, much to the purpose of the Kings answer to the French Ambassadours here; instilling also tenderly some ouerture of receiuing to grace the Duke of Orleance, and some taste of Conditions of Accord. But the French King on the other side proceeded not sincerely, but with a great deale of art and dissimulation, in this Treatie; hauing for his end to gaine time, and so put off the English-Succors, vnder hope of Peace, till he had got good footing in Britaine, by force of Armes. Wherefore he answered the Ambassadour, That hee would put himselfe into the Kings hands, and make him Arbiter of the Peace: and willingly consented, that the Ambassadour should straight wayes passe into Britaine, to signifie this his consent, and to know the Dukes minde likewise; well fore-seeing, that the Duke of Orleance, by whom the Duke of Britaine was wholly led, taking himselfe to be vpon termes irreconcileable with him, would admit of no Treatie of Peace. Whereby hee should in one, both generally abroad veyle ouer his Ambition, and winne the reputation of iust and moderate proceedings; and should withall endeare himselfe in the Affections of the King of England, as one, that had committed all to his Will: Nay, and (which was yet more fine) make Faith in him, That although he went on with the Warre, yet it should be but with his Sword in his hand, to bend the stiffenesse of the other party to accept of Peace: and so the King should take no vmbrage of his arming and prosecution; but the Treatie to be kept on foot; to the very last instant, till hee were Master of the Field.
            
            
               
Which grounds being by the French King wisely laid, all things fell out as he expected. For when the English Ambassadour came to the Court of Britaine, the Duke was then scarcely perfect in his memorie, and all things were directed by the Duke of Orleance; who gaue audience to the Chaplaine VRSWICK, and vpon his Ambassage deliuered, made answer in somewhat high termes: That the Duke of Britaine hauing beene an Host, and a kind of Parent or Foster-father to the King, in his tendernesse of age, and weaknesse of fortune, did looke for at this time from King HENRY (the renowned King of England) rather braue Troupes for his Succours, then a vaine Treatie of Peace. And if the King could forget the good Offices of the Duke done vnto him aforetime; yet he knew well, he would in his wisdome consider of the future, how much it imported his owne safetie, and reputation, both in forraine parts, and with his owne people, not to suffer Britaine (the old Confederates of England) to be swallowed vp by France, and so many good Ports, and strong Townes vpon the Coast, be in the command of so potent a Neighbour-King, and so ancient an Enemie. And therefore humbly desired the King to thinke of this businesse as his owne; and therewith brake off, and denied any further conference for Treatie.
            
            VRSWICK returned first to the French King, and related to him what had passed. Who finding things to sort to his desire, tooke hold of them, and said; That the Ambassadour might perceiue now, that which he for his part, partly imagined before. That considering in what hands the Duke of Britaine was, there would be no Peace, but by a mixt Treatie of force and perswasion. And therfore he would goe on with the one, and desired the King not to desist from the other. But for his owne part, he did faithfully promise, to bee still in the Kings power, to rule

him in the matter of Peace. This was accordingly represented vnto the King by VRSWICK at his returne, and in such a fashion, as if the Treatie were in no sort desperate, but rather stayed for a better houre, till the Hammer had wrought, and beat the Partie of Britaine more pliant. Whereupon there passed continually Packets and Dispatches betweene the two Kings, from the One out of desire, and from the other out of dissimulation, about the negotiation of Peace. The French King meane while inuaded Britaine with great forces, and distressed the Citie of Nantes with a strait siege, and (as one, who though hee had no great Iudgement, yet had that, that hee could dissemble home) the more he did vrge the prosecution of the Warre, the more he did at the same time, vrge the solicitation of the Peace. Insomuch as during the siege of Nantes, after many Letters and particular messages, the better to maintaine his dissimulation, and to refresh the Treatie; he sent BERNARD DAVBIGNEY (a person of good qualitie) to the King, earnestly to desire him, to make an end of the businesse howsoeuer.
            The King was no lesse readie to reuiue and quicken the Treatie; And therupon sent three Commissioners, the Abbot of Abington, Sir RICHARD TVNSTAL, and CHAPLEINE VRSWICK formerly imployed, to doe their vtmost endeuours, to manage the Treatie roundly and strongly.
            About this time the Lord WOODVILE, (Vncle to the Queene) a valiant gentleman, &amp; desirous of honor, sued to the King, that he might raise some Power of Voluntaries vnder-hand, and without licence or pasport (wherein the King might any wayes appeare) goe to the aide of the Duke of Britaine. The King denied his request, (or at least seemed so to doe) and layed strait commandement vpon him, that hee

should not stirre, for that the King thought his honour would suffer therein, during a Treatie, to better a Partie. Neuerthelesse this Lord (either being vnruly, or out of conceipt that the King would not inwardly dislike that, which he would not openly auow) sailed secretly ouer into the Isle of Wight, whereof hee was Gouernour, and leuied a faire Troupe of foure hundred men, and with them passed ouer into Brittaine, and ioyned himselfe with the Dukes Forces. The Newes whereof when it came to the French Court, put diuers Young Bloods into such a furie, as the English Ambassadors were not without perill to bee outraged. But the French King both to preserue the Priuiledge of Ambassadors, and being conscious to himselfe that in the businesse of Peace, hee himselfe was the greater dissembler of the two, forbade all iniuries of fact or word, against their persons, or Followers. And presently came an Agent from the King, to purge himselfe touching the Lord WOODVILES going ouer, vsing for a principall argument, to demonstrate that it was without his priuitie, for that the Troupes were so small, as neither had the Face of a succour by authoritie; nor could much aduance the Brittaine affaires. To which message, although the French King gaue no full credit, yet he made faire weather with the King, and seemed satisfied. Soone after the English Ambassadors returned, hauing two of them beene likewise with the Duke of Britaine, and found things in no other termes, then they were before. Vpon their returne, they informed the King of the state of the affaires, and how farre the French King was from any true meaning of Peace; and therefore he was now to aduise of some other course. Neither was the King himselfe lead all this while with credulity meerely, as was generally supposed: But his Error was not so much facility of beleefe, as an ill measuring of the forces of the other Partie.
            
            
               
For (as was partly touched before) the King had cast the businesse thus with himselfe. He tooke it for granted in his owne iudgement, that the Warre of Britaine, in respect of the strength of the Townes, and of the Partie, could not speedily come to a Period. For he conceiued that the Counsels of a Warre, that was vndertaken by the French King, then childlesse, against an Heire-apparant of France, would be very faint and slow. And besides, that it was not possible, but that the state of France should be imbroiled with some troubles and alterations in fauour of the Duke of Orleance. Hee conceiued likewise, that MAXIMILIAN, King of the Romans, was a Prince warlike and potent; who (he made account) would giue succours to the Britaines roundly. So then iudging it would be a worke of Time, hee laide his plot, how hee might best make vse of that Time, for his owne affaires. Wherein first hee thought to make his vantage vpon his Parliament; knowing that they being affectionate vnto the quarrell of Britaine, would giue treasure largely. Which treasure, as a noise of Warre might draw forth; so a peace succeeding might cofer vp. And because hee knew his people were hot vpon the businesse, hee chose rather to seeme to bee deceiued, and lulled asleepe by the French, then to be backward in himselfe; considering his Subiects were not so fully capable of the reasons of State, which made him hold backe. Wherefore to all these purposes hee saw no other expedient, then to set and keepe on foot a continuall Treatie of Peace; laying it downe, and taking it vp againe, as the occurrence required. Besides, he had in consideration the point of Honour in bearing the blessed person of a Pacificator. Hee thought likewise to make vse of the Enuie, that the French King met with, by occasion of this Warre of Britaine, in strengthening himselfe with new alliances;

as namely that of FERDINANDO of Spaine, with whom he had euer a consent euen in nature and customes; and likewise with MAXIMILIAN, who was particularly interessed. So that in substance hee promised himselfe Money, Honour, Friends, and Peace in the end. But those things were too fine to be fortunate, and succeed in all parts; for that great affaires are commonly too rough and stubborne to be wrought vpon by the finer edges, or points of wit. The King was likewise deceiued in his two main grounds. For although he had reason to conceiue, that the Councel of France wold be wary to put the King into a Warre against the Heire-apparant of France; yet hee did not consider, that CHARLES was not guided by any of the principall of the Bloud or Nobilitie, but by meane Men, who would make it their Master-peece of Credit and fauour, to giue venturous Counsels, which no great or wise Man durst, or would. And for MAXIMILIAN, he was thought then a Greater-matter then he was; his vnstable and necessitous Courses being not then knowne.
            After Consultation with the Ambassadors, who brought him no other newes, then he expected before (though he would not seeme to know it till then) he presently summoned his Parliament, and in open Parliament propounded the cause of Britaine to both Houses, by his Chancellor MORTON Arch-Bishop of Canterburie, who spake to this effect.
            
               MY Lords and Masters; The Kings Grace our Soueraigne Lord, hath commanded me to declare vnto you the causes that haue moued him at this time to summon this his Parliament; which I shall doe in few words,
               
crauing pardon of his Grace, and you all, if I performe it not as I would.
            His Grace doth first of all let you know, that he retaineth in thankefull memorie the loue and loyaltie shewed to him by you, at your last Meeting, in establishment of his royaltie; freeing and discharging of his partakers, and confiscation of his Traytors and Rebels: more then which could not come from Subiects to their Soueraigne, in one action. This he taketh so well at your hands, as he hath made it a Resolution to himselfe, to communicate with so louing and well approued Subiects, in all Affaires that are of publike nature, at home or abroad.
            Two therefore are the causes of your present assembling: the one, a forraigne Businesse; the other, matter of gouernment at home.
            The French King (as no doubt yee haue heard) maketh at this present hot warre vpon the Duke of Britaine. His Armie is now before Nantes, and holdeth it straitly besieged being the principall Citie (if not in Ceremonte and Preheminence, yet in Strength and Wealth) of that Duchie. Yee may guesse at his Hopes, by his attempting of the hardest part of the Warre first. The cause of this Warre he knoweth best. Hee alleageth the entertaining and succouring of the Duke of Orleance, and

some other French Lords, whom the King taketh for his Enemies. Others diuine of other Matters. Both parts haue by their Ambassadours diuers times prayed the Kings Aids: The French King Aides, or Neutralitie; the Britons Aides simply; for so their case requireth. The King, as a Christian Prince, and blessed Sonne of the Holy Church, hath offered himselfe as a Mediator, to treat a Peace betweene them. The French King yeeldeth to treat, but will not stay the prosecution of the Warre. The Britons, that desire Peace most, hearken to it least; not vpon confidence or stiffenesse, but vpon distrust of true meaning, seeing the Warre goes on. So as the King, after as much paines and care to effect a Peace, as euer he tooke in any Businesse, not being able to remoue the Prosecution on the one side, nor the Distrust on the other, caused by that Prosecution, hath let fall the Treatie; not repenting of it, but desparing of it now, as not likely to succeed. Therefore by this Narratiue you now vnderstand the state of the Question, whereupon the King prayeth your aduice: which is no other, but whether hee shall enter into an auxiliarie and defensiue Warre for the Britons against France.
            
            
               
                  〈◊〉
                the better to open your vnderstandings

in this Affaire, the King hath commanded mee to say somewhat to you from him, of the Persons that doe interuene in this Businesse; and somewhat of the Consequence thereof, as it hath relation to this Kingdome; and somewhat of the Example of it in generall: making neuerthelesse no Conclusion or Judgement of any Point, vntill his Grace hath receiued your faithfull and politique aduices.
            First, for the King our Soueraigne himselfe, who is the principall Person you are to eye in this Businesse; his Grace doth professe, that he truly and constantly desireth to reigne in Peace. But his Grace saith, he will neither buy Peace with Dishonour, nor take it vp at interest of Danger to ensue; but shall thinke it a good Change, if it please God to change the inward Troubles and Seditions, wherewith he hath beene hitherto exercised, into an honourable Forraigne Warre. And for the other two Persons in this Action, the French King, and the Duke of Britaine, his Grace doth declare vnto you, that they be the Men, vnto whom be is of all other Friends and Allies most bounden: the one hauing held ouer him his hand of Protection from the Tyrant: the Other hauing reacht forth vnto him his hand of helpe, for the recouerie of his Kingdome. So that his affection toward them in his naturall

Person, is vpon equall tearmes. And whereas you may haue heard, that his Grace was enforced to flie out of Britaine into France, for doubts of being betrayed; his Grace would not in any sort haue that reflect vpon the Duke of Britaine, in defacement of his former benefits: for that hee is throughly informed, that it was but the practice of some corrupt Persons about him, during the time of his sicknesse, altogether without his consent or priuitie.
            But howsoeuer these things doe interesse his Grace in his particular, yet hee knoweth well, that the higher Bond that tieth him to procure by all meanes the safetie and welfare of his louing Subiects, doth dis-interesse him of these Obligations of Gratitude, otherwise then thus: that if his Grace be forced to make a Warre, he doe it without passion, or ambition.
            For the consequence of this Action towards this Kingdome, it is much as the French Kings intention is. For if it be no more, but to range his Subiects to reason, who beare themselues stout vpon the strength of the Duke of Britaine, it is nothing to vs. But if it be in the French Kings purpose, or if it should not be in his purpose, yet if it shall follow all one, as if it were sought, that the French King shall make a Prouince of Britaine, and ioyne it to the

Crowne of France: then it is worthy the consideration, how this may import England, as well in the increasement of the greatnesse of France, by the addition of such a Countrey, that stretcheth his Boughes vnto our Seas, as in depriuing this Nation, and leauing it naked of so firme and assured Confederates, as the Britons haue alwayes beene. For then it will come to passe, that whereas not long since, this Realme was mightie vpon the Continent, first in Territorie, and after in Alliance, in respect of Burgundie and Britaine, which were Confederates indeed, but dependant Confederates; now the one being already cast, partly into the greatnes of France, and partly into that of Austria, the other is like wholly to be cast into the greatnesse of France, and this Island shall remaine confined in effect within the salt Waters, and girt about with the Coast-Countries of two mightie Monarchs.
            For the Example, it resteth likewise vpon the same Question, vpon the French Kings intent. For if Britaine be carried and swallowed vp by France, as the world abroad (apt to impute and construe the Actions of Princes to Ambition) conceiue it will; then it is an Example very dangerous and vniuersall, that the lesser Neighbour Estate should bee deuoured of the greater. For this may bee the case of Scotland
               
towards England; of Portugal, towards Spaine; of the smaller Estates of Italie, towards the greater; and so of Germanie; or as if some of you of the Commons, might not liue and dwell safely, besides some of these great Lords. And the bringing in of this Example, will be chiefely laid to the Kings charge, as to him that was most interested and most able to forbid it. But then on the other side, there is so faire a Pretext on the French Kings Part (and yet Pretext is neuer wanting to Power) in regard the danger imminent to his owne Estate is such, as may make this Enterprise seeme rather a Work of Necessitie, then of Ambition, as doth in reason correct the Danger of the Example. For that the Example of that which is done in a mans owne defence, cannot be dangerous; because it is in anothers power to auoid it. But in all this businesse, the King remits himselfe to your graue and mature aduice, whereupon he purposeth to relye.
            
               This was the effect of the Lord Chancellors Speech touching the Cause of Britaine: For the King had commanded him to carrie it so, as to affect the Parliament towards the Businesse; but without engaging the King in any expresse declaration.
            
            
               The Chancellor went on:
            
            
               
FOr that which may concerne the Gouernement at home, the King hath commanded me to say vnto you; That he thinketh there was neuer any King (for the small time that hee hath reigned) had greater and iuster cause of the two contrarie Passions of Joy, and Sorrow, then his Grace hath. Joy, in respect of the rare and visible Fauours of Almightie God, in girting the Imperiall Sword vpon his side, and assisting the same his Sword against all his Enemies; and likewise in blessing him with so many good and louing Seruants and Subiects, which haue neuer fayled to giue him faithfull Counsell, readie Obedience, and couragious Defence. Sorrow, for that it hath not pleased God to suffer him to sheathe his Sword (as hee greatly desired otherwise then for Administration of Justice) but that he hath beene forced to draw it so oft, to cut off Trayterous and disloyall Subiects, whom (it seemes) God hath left (a few amongst many good) as the Canaanites among the People of Israel, to be thornes in their sides, to tempt and trie them; though the end hath beene alwayes (Gods Name bee blessed therefore) that the destruction hath fallen vpon their owne heads.
            Wherefore his Grace saith; That hee seeth, that it is not the Bloud spilt in the Field, that

will saue the Bloud in the Citie; nor the Marshals Sword, that will set this Kingdome in perfect Peace: But that the true way is, to stop the Seeds of Sedition and Rebellion in their beginnings; and for that purpose to deuise, confirme, and quicken good and holesome Lawes, against Riots, and vnlawfull Assemblies of People, and all Combinations and Confederacies of them, by Liueries, Tokens, and other Badges of factious Dependance; that the Peace of the Land may by these Ordinances, as by Barres of Iron, bee soundly bound in and strengthned, and all Force both in Court, Countrey, and priuate Houses, be supprest. The care hereof, which so much concerneth your selues, and which the nature of the Times doth instantly call for, his Grace commends to your Wisdomes.
            And because it is the Kings desire, that this Peace, wherein he hopeth to gouerne and maintaine you, doe not beare onely vnto you Leaues for you to sit vnder the shade of them in safetie; but also should beare you Fruit of Riches, Wealth and Plentie: Therfore his Grace prayes you, to take into consideration matter of Trade, as also the Manufactures of the Kingdome, and to represse the bastard and barren Imployment of Moneyes, to Usurie and vnlawfull Exchanges, that they may be (as their naturall

vse is) turned vpon Commerce, and lawfull and Royall Trading. And likewise, that our People bee set on worke in Arts and Handycrafts; that the Realme may subsist more of it selfe; that Idlenesse be auoided, and the drayning out of our Treasure, for forraine Manufactures, stopped. But you are not to rest heere onely, but to prouide further, that whatsoeuer Merchandize shall bee brought in from beyond the Seas, may bee imployed vpon the Commodities of this Land; wherby the Kingdomes stocke of Treasure may be sure to bee kept from being diminished, by any ouer-trading of the Forrainer.
            And lastly, because the King is well assured, that you would not haue him poore, that wishes you rich; he doubteth not, but that you will haue care, as well to maintaine his Reuenues, of Customes, and all other Natures, as also to supply him with your louing Aides, if the case shall so require. The rather, for that you know the King is a good Husband, and but a Steward in effect for the Publike; and that what comes from you is but as Moisture drawne from the Earth, which gathers into a Cloud, and fals back vpon the Earth againe. And you know well, how the Kingdomes about you grow more and more in Greatnesse, and the Times

are stirring; and therefore not fit to finde the King with an emptie Purse. More I haue not to say to you; and wish, that what hath beene said, had beene better exprest: But that your Wisdomes and good Affections will supply. GOD blesse your Doings.
            IT was no hard matter to dispose and affect the Parliament in this businesse; aswell in respect of the Emulation betweene the Nations, and the Enuie at the late growth of the French Monarchie; as in regard of the Danger, to suffer the French to make their approaches vpon England, by obtaining so goodly a maritime Prouince, full of Sea-townes, and Hauens, that might doe mischiefe to the English, either by inuasion or by interruption of Traffique. The Parliament was also moued with the point of Oppression; for although the French seemed to speake reason, yet Arguments are euer with multitudes too weake for Suspitions. Wherefore they did aduise the King, roundly to embrace the Britons quarrell, and to send them speedy aides, and with much alacritie and forwardnesse granted to the King a great rate of Subsidie, in contemplation of these aides. But the King both to keepe a decencie towards the French King, to whom he profest himselfe to be obliged, and indeed desirous rather to shew Warre, then to make it; sent new solemne Ambassadors to intimate vnto him, the Decree of his Estates, and to iterate his motion, that the French would desist from Hostilitie; or if Warre must follow, to desire him to take it in good part, if at the motion of his people, who were sensible of the cause of the Britons as their ancient

Friends, and Confederates, hee did send them succours; with protestation neuerthelesse, that to saue all Treaties and Lawes of Friendship, hee had limited his Force, to proceed in aide of the Britons, but in no wise to warre vpon the French, otherwise then as they maintained the possession of Britaine. But before this formall Ambassage arriued, the Partie of the Duke had receiued a great blow, and grew to manifest declination. For neere the Towne of Saint Alban in Britaine, a Battaile had beene giuen, where the Britons were ouerthrowne, and the Duke of Orleance, and the Prince of Orange taken Prisoners, there being slaine on the Britons part six thousand Men, and amongst them the Lord WOODVILE, and almost all his Souldiers, valiantly fighting. And of the French part one thousand two hundred, with their Leader, IAMES GALEOT, a great Commander.
            
            When the newes of this Battaile came ouer into England, it was time for the King (who now had no subrerfuge to continue further Treatie, and saw before his Eyes, that Britaine went so speedily for lost, contrarie to his hopes, knowing also that with his People and Forreiners both, he sustained no small Enuie and disreputation for his former delayes) to dispatch with all possible speed his succours into Britaine; which hee did vnder the conduct of ROBERT Lord BROOKE to the number of eight thousand choise Men, and well armed; who hauing a faire wind, in few houres landed in Britaine, and ioyned themselues forthwith to those Briton-Forces, that remained after the Defeat, and marched straight on to find the Enemie, and incamped fast by them. The French wisely husbanding the possession of a Victorie, and well acquainted with the courage of the English, especially when they are fresh, kept themselues within their Trenches, being strongly lodged, and resolued not to giue battaile.

But meane while, to harrasse and wearie the English, they did vpon all aduantages set vpon them with their Light-Horse; wherein neuerthelesse they receiued commonly losse, especially by meanes of the English-Archers.
            
            But vpon these atchieuements FRANCIS Duke of Britaine deceased; an accident that the King might easily haue foreseene, and ought to haue reckoned vpon, and prouided for, but that the Point of Reputation, when newes first came of the Battaile lost (that somewhat must bee done) did ouerbeare the Reason of Warre.
            
            After the Dukes decease, the principall persons of Britaine, partly bought, partly through faction, put all things into confusion; so as the English not finding Head or Bodie with whom to ioyne their Forces, and being in iealousie of Friends, as well as in danger of Enemies, and the Winter begun, returned home fiue moneths after their landing. So the Battaile of Saint Alban, the death of the Duke, and the retire of the English succours were (after some time) the causes of the losse of that Duchie; which action some accounted as a blemish of the Kings Iudgement; but most but as the misfortune of his times.
            But howsoeuer the temporarie Fruit of the Parliament in their aid and aduice giuen for Britaine, tooke not, nor prospered not; yet the lasting Fruit of Parliament, which is good and wholsome Lawes, did prosper, and doth yet continue to this day. For according to the Lord Chancellours admonition, there were that Parliament diuers excellent Lawes ordained, concerning the Points which the King recommended.
            
               First, the authoritie of the Star-chamber, which before subsisted by the ancient Common-Lawes of the Realme, was confirmed in certaine Cases by Act of

               Parliament. This Court is one of the sagest and noblest Institutions of this Kingdome. For in the distribution of Courts of Ordinarie Iustice (besides the High-Court of Parliament) in which distribution the Kings-Bench holdeth the Pleas of the Crowne, the Common-Place, Pleas Ciuill, the Exchequer Pleas concerning the Kings Reuenue, and the Chancery the Pretorian power for mitigating the Rigour of Law, in case of extremitie by the conscience of a good man; there was neuerthelesse alwaies reserued a high and preheminent power to the Kings Counsell, in Causes that might in example, or consequence, concerne the state of the Common-wealth, which if they were Criminall, the Counsell vsed to sit in the Chamber, called the Star-Chamber; if Ciuill, in the White-Chamber, or White-hall. And as the Chancery had the Pretorian power for Equitie; so the Star-chamber had the Censorian power for Offences, vnder the degree of Capitall. This Court of Star-chamber is compounded of good Elements; for it consisteth of foure kindes of Persons: Councellors, Peeres, Prelates, and Chief-Iudges. It discerneth also principally of foure kinds of Causes; Forces, Frauds, Crimes various of Stellionate, and the Inchoations or middle acts towards Crimes Capitall, or hainous, not actually committed or perpetrated. But that which was principally aimed at by this Act was Force, and the two chiefe Supports of Force, Combination of multitudes, and Maintenance or Headship of great Persons.
            
            From the generall peace of the Countrie, the Kings care went on to the peace of the Kings House, and the securitie of his great Officers and Counsellors. But this Law was somwhat of a strange composition and temper. That if any of the Kings seruants vnder the degree of a Lord, doe conspire the death of any of the Kings Counsell, or Lord of the Realme, it is made Capitall. This Law was thought to bee procured by the Lord
               
               Chancellor, who being a sterne and haughtie man, and finding he had some mortall Enemies in Court, prouided for his owne safetie; drowning the enuie of it in a generall Law, by communicating the priuiledge with all other Councellors and Peeres, and yet not daring to extend it further, then to the Kings seruants in Checkrowle, lest it should haue beene too harsh to the Gentlemen, and other Commons of the Kingdome; who might haue thought their ancient Libertie, and the clemencie of the Lawes of England inuaded, If the will in any case of Felonie should be made the deed. And yet the reason which the Act yeeldeth (that is to say, That hee that conspireth the death of Councellors may be thought indirectly, and by a meane, to conspire the death of the King himselfe) is indifferent to all Subiects, as well as to Seruants in Court. But it seemeth this sufficed to serue the Lord Chancellors turne at this time. But yet hee liued to neede a Generall Law, for that hee grew afterwards as odious to the Countrie, as hee was then to the Court.
            
            From the peace of the Kings House, the Kings care extended to the peace of Priuate Houses and Families. For there was an excellent Morall Law moulded thus; The taking and carrying away of Women forcibly, and against their will (except Female-Wards and Bond-women) was made Capitall. The Parliament wisely and iustly conceiuing, that the obtaining of Women by force into Possession (howsoeuer afterwards Assent might follow by Allurements) was but a Rape drawne forth in length, because the first Force drew on all the rest.
            There was made also another Law for Peace in generall, and repressing of Murthers and Man-slaughters, and was in amendment of the Common Lawes of the Realme, being this: That wheras by the Common Law, the Kings-suit in case of Homicide, did expect The
               
               yeare and the day, allowed to the Parties Suit by way of Appeale; and that it was found by experience, that the Partie was many times compounded with, and many times wearied with the Suit, so that in the end such Suit was let fall, and by that time the matter was in a manner forgotten, and therby Prosecution at the Kings suit by Indictment (which is euer best, Flagrante crimine) neglected; it was ordained, That the Suit by Indictment might bee taken as well at any time within the yeare and the day, as after, not preiudicing neuerthelesse the Parties Suit.
            
            The King began also then, as well in Wisdome as in Iustice to pare a little the Priuiledge of Clergie, ordaining, That Clarkes conuict should bee burned in the hand, both because they might taste of some corporall punishment, and that they might carry a Brand of infamie. But for this good Acts sake, the King himselfe was after branded by PERKINS Proclamation, for an execrable breaker of the Rites of Holy Church.
            
            Another Law was made for the better Peace of the Countrey; by which Law the Kings Officers and Farmors were to forfeit their Places and Holds, in case of vnlawfull Retainer, or partaking in Routs and vnlawfull Assemblies.
            These were the Lawes that were made for repressing of Force, which those times did chiefely require; and were so prudently framed, as they are found fit for all succeeding times, and so continue to this day.
            There were also made good and politicke Lawes that Parliament against Vsurie, which is the Bastard vse of Money; And against vnlawfull Chieuances and Exchanges, which is Bastard Vsurie; And also for the securitie of the Kings Customes; And for the imployment of the Procedures of Forraine Commodities, brought in by Merchant-strangers, vpon the Natiue Commodities of the Realme; Together with some other Lawes of lesse importance.
            
               
But howsoeuer the Lawes made in that Parliament did beare good and holesome Fruit; yet the Subsidie granted at the same time, bare a Fruit, that proued harsh and bitter. All was inned at last into the Kings Barne; but it was after a Storme. For when the Commissioners entred into the Taxation of the Subsidie in Yorkeshire, and the Bishopricke of Duresme; the people vpon a sudaine grew into great mutinie, and said openly, that they had endured of late yeares a thousand miseries, and neither could nor would pay the Subsidie. This (no doubt) proceeded not simply of any present necessitie, but much by reason of the old humour of those Countries, where the memorie of King RICHARD was so strong, that it lies like Lees in the bottome of mens hearts; and if the Vessell was but stirred, it would come vp. And (no doubt) it was partly also by the instigation of some factious Male-contents, that bare principall stroke amongst them. Hereupon the Commissioners being somewhat astonished, deferred the matter vnto the Earle of Northumberland, who was the principall man of Authoritie in those Parts. The Earle forthwith wrote vnto the Court, signifying to the King plainely enough in what flame hee found the people of those Countries, and praying the Kings direction. The King wrote backe peremptorily, That hee would not haue one penny abated, of that which had beene granted to him by Parliament, both because it might encourage other Countries to pray the like Release, or Mitigation, and chiefely, because hee would neuer endure, that the base Multitude should frustrate the Authoritie of the Parliament, wherein their Votes and Consents were concluded. Vpon this dispatch from Court, the Earle assembled the principall Iustices and Free-holders of the Countrey; and speaking to them in that imperious Language wherein the King had written to him,

which needed not (saue that an Harsh businesse was vnfortunately fallen into the hands of a Harsh-man) did not onely irritate the People, but make them conceiue, by the stoutnesse and haughtinesse of deliuerie of the Kings Errand; that himselfe was the Author or principall Perswader of that Counsell. Whereupon the meaner sort routed together, and suddenly assayling the Earle in his House, slew him, and diuers of his seruants. And rested not there, but creating for their Leader Sir IOHN EGREMOND, a factious person, and one that had of a long time borne an ill Talent towards the King; and being animated also by a base Fellow, called IOHN A CHAMBER, a very Boutefeu, who bare much sway amongst the vulgar and popular, entred into open Rebellion, and gaue out in flat termes, that they would goe against King HENRY, and fight with him for the maintenance of their Liberties.
            
            When the King was aduertised of this new Insurrection (being almost a Feuer, that tooke him euery yeare) after his manner little troubled therewith, hee sent THOMAS Earle of Surrey (whom hee had a little before not onely released out of the Tower, and pardoned, but also receiued to speciall fauour) with a competent Power against the Rebels; who fought with the principall Band of them, and defeated them, and tooke aliue IOHN A CHAMBER, their firebrand. As for Sir IOHN EGREMOND, hee fled into Flanders, to the Ladie MARGARET of Burgundie; whose Palace was the Sanctuarie and Receptacle of all Traitors against the King. IOHN A CHAMBER was executed at Yorke, in great state; for he was hanged vpon a Gibbet raised a Stage higher in the midst of a square Gallowes, as a Traitor Paramount; And a number of his men that were his chiefe Complices, were hanged vpon the lower Storie round

about him; and the rest were generally pardoned. Neither did the King himselfe omit his custome, to be first or second in all his warlike Exploits; making good his Word, which was vsuall with him when he heard of Rebels; that He desired but to see them. For immediatly after he had sent downe the Earle of Surrey, he marched towards them himselfe in person. And although in his iourney hee heard newes of the Victory, yet hee went on as farre as Yorke, to pacifie and settle those Countryes. And that done returned to London, leauing the Earle of Surrey for his Lieutenant in the Northerne parts, and Sir RICHARD TVNSTALL for his principall Commissioner, to leuie the Subsidie, whereof he did not remit a Denier.
            
            About the same time that the King lost so good a Seruant, as the Earle of Northumberland, hee lost likewise a faithfull friend and Allie of IAMES the third, King of Scotland, by a miserable disaster. For this vnfortunate Prince, after a long smother of discontent, and hatred of many of his Nobilitie and People, breaking forth at times into seditions and alterations of Court, was at last distressed by them, hauing taken Armes, and surprised the person of Prince IAMES his sonne, partly by force, partly by threats, that they would otherwise deliuer vp the Kingdome to the King of England, to shadow their Rebellion, and to bee the titular and painted Head of those Armes. Whereupon the King (finding himselfe too weake) sought vnto King HENRY, as also vnto the Pope, and the King of France, to compose those troubles, betweene him and his Subiects. The Kings accordingly interposed their Mediation in a round and Princely manner: Not only by way of request and perswasion, but also by way of protestation of menace; declaring, that they thought it to be the common Cause of all Kings, If Subiects should be suffered to giue Lawes
               
               vnto their Soueraigne; and that they would accordingly resent it, and reuenge it. But the Rebels that had shaken off the greater Yoke of Obedience, had likewise cast away the lesser Tye of Respect. And Furie preuailing aboue Feare, made answer, That there was no talking of Peace, except the King would resignehis Crowne. Whereupon (Treatie of Accord taking no place) it came vp to a Battaile, at Bannocks Bourne by Striuelin. In which Battaile the King transported with wrath and iust indignation, inconsideratly fighting and precipitating the charge, before his whole numbers came vp to him, was (notwithstanding the contrarie expresse and straight commandement of the Prince his sonne) slaine in the Pursuit, being fled to a Mill, scituate in the field, where the Battaile was fought.
            As for the Popes Ambassie, which was sent by ADRIAN DE CASTELLO an Italian Legate) and perhaps as those times were might haue preuailed more) it came too late for the Ambassie, but not for the Ambassador. For passing through England, and being honourably entertained, and dreceiued of King HENRY; (who euer applied himselfe with much respect to the See of Rome) hee fell into great grace with the King, and great familiaritie and friendship with MORTON the Chancellor. In so much as the King taking a liking to him, and finding him to his minde, preferred him to the Bishopricke of Hereford, and afterwards to that of Bath and Wells, and imployed him in many of his affaires of State, that had relation to Rome. Hee was a man of great learning, wisedome, and dexteritle in businesse of State; and hauing not long after ascended to the degree of Cardinall, payd the King large tribute of his gratitude, in diligent and iudicious aduertisement of the occurrents of Italie. Neuerthelesse in the end of his time, hee was

partaker of the conspiracie, which Cardinall ALPHONSO PETRVCCI, and some other Cardinalls had plotted against the life of Pope LEO. And this offence in it selfe so hainous, was yet in him aggrauared by the motiue therof, which was not malice or discontent, but an aspiring minde to the Papacie. And in this height of impietie there wanted not an intermixture of leuitie and follie; for that (as was generally belieued) hee was animated to expect the Papacie, by a fatall Mockerie, the prediction of a Southsaier, which was; That one should succeed Pope LEO, whose name should bee ADRIAN, an aged man of meane birth, and of great learning and wisdome. By which Character and figure, hee tooke himselfe to bee described though it were fulfilled of ADRIAN the Flemming, sonne of a Dutch Brewer, Cardinall of Tortosa, and Preceptor vnto CHARLES the Fift; the same that not changing his Christen-name, was afterwards called ADRIAN the Sixt.
            But these things happened in the yeare following, which was the fift of this King. But in the end of the fourth yeare the King had called againe his Parliament, not as it seemeth for any particular occasion of State. But the former Parliament being ended somewhat sodainly, in regard of the preparation for Britaine, the King thought hee had not remunerated his people sufficiently with good Lawes, which euermore was his Retribution for Treasure. And finding by the Insurrection in the North, there was discontentment abroad, in respect of the Subsidie, hee thought it good to giue his Subiects yet further contentment, and comfort in that kind. Certainly his times for good Common-wealths Lawes did excell. So as he may iustly be celebrated for the best Law giuer to this Nation, after King EDWARD the first. For his Lawes (who so markes them well) are deepe, and not vulgar;

not made vpon the Spurre of a particular Occasion for the Present, but out of Prouidence of the Future, to make the Estate of his People still more and more happie; after the manner of the Legislators in ancient and Heroicall Times.
            First therfore he made a Law, sutable to his owne Acts and Times. For as himselfe had in his Person and Marriage made a finall Concord, in the great Suit and Title for the Crowne; so by this Law hee setled the like Peace and Quiet in the priuate Possessions of the Subjects. Ordaining, That Fines thence-forth should bee finall, to conclude all Strangers Rights; and that vpon Fines leuied, and solemnely proclaimed, the Subiect should haue his time of Watch for fiue yeares after his Title accrued; which if hee fore-passed, his Right should be bound for euer after; with some exception neuerthelesse, of Minors, Married-Women, and such incompetent Persons.
            This Statute did in effect but restore an ancient Statute of the Realme, which was it selfe also made but in affirmance of the Common-Law. The alteration had beene by a Statute, commonly called the Statute of Non-claime, made in the time of EDWARD the Third. And surely this Law was a kind of Prognostick of the good Peace, which since his time hath (for the most part) continued in this Kingdome, vntill this day. For Statutes of Non-Claime are fit for times of Warre, when mens heads are troubled, that they cannot intend their Estate; But Statutes, that quiet Possessions, are fittest for Times of Peace, to extinguish Suits and Contentions, which is one of the Banes of Peace.
            Another Statute was made of singular Policie, for the Population apparantly, and (if it bee throughly considered) for the Souldiery, and Militar Forces of the Realme.
            
            
               
               Inclosures at that time began to be more frequent, whereby Arrable Land (which could not be manured without people and Families) was turned into Pasture, which was easily rid by a few Heards men; and Tenancies for Yeares, Liues, and At Will (whereupon much of the Yeomanrie liued) were turned into Demesnes. This bred a decay of People, and (by consequence) a decay of Townes, Churches, Tithes, and the like. The King likewise knew full well, and in no wise forgot, that there ensued with all vpon this a decay and diminution of Subsidie and Taxes; for the more Gentlemen, euer the lower bookes of Subsidies. In remedying of this inconuenience, the Kings Wisdome was admirable, and the Parliaments at that time. Inclosures they would not forbid, for that had beene to forbid the improuement of the Patrimonie of the Kingdome; nor Tillage they would not compell, for that was to striue with Nature and Vtilitie. But they tooke a course to take away depopulating Inclosures, and depopulating Pasturage, and yet not by that name, or by any Imperious expresse Prohibition, but by consequence. The Ordinance was, That all Houses of Husbandry, that were vsed with twentie Acres of Ground, and vpwards, should bee maintained and kept vp for euer; together with a competent Proportion of Land to be vsed and occupied with them; and in no wise to be seruered from them, as by another Statute, made afterwards in his Successors time, was more fully declared. This vpon Forfeiture to be taken; not by way of Popular Action, but by seizure of the Land it selfe. by the King and Lords of the Fee, as to halfe the Profits, till the Houses and Lands were restored. By this meanes the Houses being kept vp, did of necessitie inforce a Dweller; and the proportion of Land for Occupation being kept vp, did of necessitie inforce that Dweller; not to be a Begger or Cottager, but a man

of some substance, that might keepe Hiends and Seruants, and set the Plough on going. This did wonderfully concerne the Might and Manner-hood of the Kingdome, to haue Fermes, as it were of a Standard sufficient to maintaine an able Body out of Penurie, and did in effect amortize a great part of the Lands of the Kingdome vnto the Hold and Occupation of the Yeomanrie or Middle-people, of a condition betweene Gentlemen, and Cottagers, or Peasants. Now, how much this did aduance the Militar Power of the Kingdome, is apparant by the true Principles of Warre, and the examples of other Kingdomes. For it hath beene held by the generall Opinion of men of best Iudgement in the warres (howsoeuer some few haue varied, and that it may receiue some distinction of Case) that the principall Strength of an Armie consisteth in the Infanterie or Foot. And to make good Infanterie, it requireth men bred, not in a seruile or indigent fashion, but in some free and plentifull manner. Therefore if a State runne most to Noblemen and Gentlemen, and that the Husband-men and Plough-men be but as their Work-folkes and Labourers, or else meere Cottagers (which are but Housed-Beggers) you may haue a good Cauallerie, but neuer good stable Bands of Foot; like to Coppice-Woods, that if you leaue in them Staddles too thicke, they will runne to Bushes and Briars, and haue little cleane Vnderwood. And this is to be seene in France, and Italie, and lome other Parts abroad, where in effect all is Noblesse, or Pesantrie, I speake of People out of Townes, and no middle People; and therefore no good Forces of Foot: Insomuch, as they are inforced to imploy Mercenarie Bands, of Switzers and the like, for their Battalions of Foot: Whereby also it comes to passe, that those Nations haue much People, and few Souldiors. Whereas the King saw, that contrariwise

it would follow, that England though much lesse in Territorie, yet should haue infinitly more Souldiours of their natiue Forces, then those other Nations haue. Thus did the King secretly sow Hidraes teeth, wherevpon (according to the Poets fiction) should rise vp Armed men for the seruice of this Kingdome.
            The King also (hauing care to make his Realme potent, as well by Sea as by Land) for the better maintenance of the Nauie, ordained; That wines and woads from the parts of Gascoigne and Languedocke, should not be brought but in English bottomes; Bowing the ancient Policie of this Estate, from consideration of Plentie, to consideration of Power. For that almost all the ancient Statutes incite by all meanes Merchant-Strangers, to bring in all sorts of Commodities; hauing for end Cheapnesse, and not looking to the point of State concerning the Nauall-power.
            
            The King also made a Statute in that Parliament Monitory and Minatory, towards Iustices of Peace, that they should duly execute their office, inuiting complaints against them, first to their Fellow-Iustices, then to the Iustices of Assise, then to the King or Chancellor; and that a Proclamation, which hee had published of that Tenor, should be read in open Sessions foure times a yeare, to keepe them awake. Meaning also to haue his lawes executed, and therby to reape either Obedience or Forfeitures; (wherein towards his latter times hee did decline too much to the left hand) he did ordaine remedie against the practice that was growne in vse, to stop and dampe Informations vpon Penall Lawes, by procuring Informations by collusion to be put in by the Confederates of the Delinquents, to be faintly prosecuted, and let fall at pleasure, and pleading them in Barre of the Informations, which were prosecuted with effect.
            He made also Lawes for the correction of the Mint,
               
and counterfaiting of forreine Coyne currant. And that no payment in Gold, should bee made to any Merchant-stranger, the better to keepe Treasure within the Realme, for that Gold was the mettall that lay in leastroome.
            He made also Statutes for the maintenance of Draperie, and the keeping of Wools within the Realme; and not only so, but for stinting, and limiting the prices of Cloth, one for the Finer, and another for the Courser sort. Which I note, both because it was a rare thing to set prices by Statute, especially vpon our Home-Commodities; and because of the wise Modele of this Act, not prescribing Prices, but stinting them not to exceed a rate, that the Clothier might drape accordingly as he might affoord.
            Diuers other good Statutes were made that Parliament, but these were the principall. And here I doe desire those, into whose hands this worke shall fall, that they do take in good part my long insisting vpon the Lawes, that were made in this Kings reigne. Whereof I haue these reasons; Both because it was the preheminent vertue and merit of this King, to whose memorie I doe honour; and because it hath some correspondence to my Person; but chiefly, because (in my iudgement) it is some defect euen in the best writers of Historie, that they doe not often enough summarily deliuer and set downe the most memorable Lawes, that passed in the times whereof they write, being indeed the principall Acts of Peace For though they may bee had in Originall Bookes of Law themselues; yet that informeth not the iudgement of Kings and Councellors, and Persons of Estate, so well as to see them described, and entred in the Table and Pourtrait of the Times.
            About the same time, the King had a Loane from the Citie of Foure thousand pounds; which was double

to that they lent before, and was duely and orderly payd back at the day, as the former likewise had beene. The King euer choosing rather to borrow too soone, then to pay too late, and so keeping vp his Credit.
            Neither had the King yet cast off his cares and hopes touching Britaine, but thought to master the occasion by Policie, though his Armes had beene vnfortunate, and to bereaue the French King of the fruit of his Victorie. The summe of his designe was, to encourage MAXIMILIAN to goe on with his suit, for the marriage of ANNE, the heire of Britaine, and to aide him to the consummation therof. But the affaires of MAXIMILIAN were at that time in great trouble and combustion, by a Rebellion of his Subiects in Flanders; especially those of Bruges and Gaunt, wherof the Towne of Bruges (at such time as MAXIMILIAN was there in person) had sodainly armed in tumult, and slaine some of his principall Officers, and taken himself prisoner, and held him in durance, till they had enforced him, and some of his Councellors, to take a solemne oath, to pardon all their offences, and neuer to question and reuenge the same in time to come. Neuerthelesse FREDERICKE the Emperour would not suffer this reproach and indignitie offered to his sonne to passe, but made sharpe warres vpon Flanders, to reclaime and chastise the Rebels. But the Lord RAVENSTEIN, a principall person about MAXIMILIAN, and one that had taken the oath of Abolition with his Master, pretending the Religion therof, but indeed vpon priuate ambition, and as it was thought) instigated and corrupted from France, for sooke the Emperour and MAXIMILIAN his Lord, and made himselfe an Head of the Popular Partie, and seized vpon the Townes of Ipre and Sluce, with both the Castles. And forthwith

sent to the Lord CORDES, Gouernour of Picardie vnder the French King, to desire aide, and to moue him, that hee on the behalfe of the French King would bee Protector of the United Towns, and by force of Armes reduce the rest. The Lord CORDES was readie to embrace the occasion, which was partly of his owne setting, and sent forthwith greater Forces, then it had beene possible for him to raise on the sodaine, if hee had not looked for such a summons before, in aide of the Lord RAVENSTEIN, and the Flemmings, with instructions to inuest the Townes betweene France and Bruges. The French Forces besieged a little Towne called Dixmue, where part of the Flemmish Forces ioyned with them. While they lay at this siege, the King of England, vpon pretence of the safety of the English Pale about Calice, but in truth being loth that MAXIMILIAN should become contemptible, and therby bee shaken off by the States of Britaine about this marriage, sent ouer the Lord MORLEY with a thousand men vnto the Lord DAVBIGNY, then Deputie of Calice, with secret instructions to aide MAXIMILIAN, and to raise the siege of Dixmue. The Lord DAVBIGNY (giuing it out that all was for the strengthning of the English Marches) drew out of the Garrisons of Calice, Hammes, and Guines, to the number of a thousand Men more. So that with the fresh Succours that came vnder the Conduct of the Lord MORLEY, they made vp to the number of two thousand, or better. Which Forces ioyning with some Companies of Almaines, put themselues into Dixmue, not perceiued by the Enemies; and passing through the Towne with some reenforcement (from the Forces that were in the Towne) assailed the Enemies Campe, negligently guarded, as being out of feare; where there was a bloudy fight, in which the English and their Partakers
               
obtained the victorie, and slew to the number of eight thousand Men, with the losse on the English part of a hundred or there abouts; amongst whom was the Lord MORLEY. They tooke also their great Ordnance, with much rich spoiles, which they carried to Newport, whence the Lord DAVBIGNY returned to Calice, leauing the hurt Men, and some other Voluntaries in Newport. But the Lord CORDES being at Ipre with a great power of Men, thinking to recouer the losse and disgrace of the fight at Dixmue, came presently on, and sate downe before Newport, and besieged it; and after some dayes siege, hee resolued to trie the fortune of an Assault: Which hee did one day, and succeeded therein so farre, that hee had taken the principall Tower and Fort in that Citie, and planted vpon it the French Banner. Whence neuerthelesse they were presently beaten forth by the English, by the helpe of some fresh Succours of Archers arriuing by good fortune (at the instant) in the Hauen of Newport. Whereupon the Lord CORDES discouraged, and measuring the new Succours (which were small) by the Successe (which was great) leuied his Siege. By this meanes, matters grew more exasperate betweene the two Kings of England and France, for that in the warre of Flanders, the auxiliarie Forces of French and English were much blouded one against another. Which Bloud rankled the more, by the vaine words of the Lord CORDES, that declared himselfe an open Enemie of the English, beyond that that appertained to the present Seruice; making it a common byword of his, That hee could bee content to lie in Hell seuen yeares, so hee might winne Calice from the English.
            The King hauing thus vpheld the Reputation of MAXIMILIAN, aduised him now to presse on his

Marriage with Britaine to a conclusion. Which MAXIMILIAN accordingly did, and so farre forth preuayled both with the young Lady, and with the principall persons about her, as the Marriage was consummate by Proxie, with a Ceremonie at that time in these Parts new. For shee was not onely publikely contracted, but stated as a Bride, and solemnly Bedded; and after shee was laid, there came in MAXIMILIANS Ambassadour with letters of Procuration, and in the presence of sundry Noble Personages, Men and Women, put his Legge (stript naked to the Knee) betweene the Espousall Sheets; to the end, that that Ceremonie might bee thought to amount to a Consummation, and actuall Knowledge. This done, MAXIMILIAN (whose propertie was to leaue things then, when they were almost come to perfection, and to end them by imagination; like ill Archers, that draw not their Arrowes vp to the Head: and who might as easily haue bedded the Lady himselfe, as to haue made a Play and Disguise of it) thinking now all assured, neglected for a time his further Proceeding, and intended his Warres. Meane while, the French King (consulting with his Diuines, and finding that this pretended Consummation was rather an Inuention of Court, then any wayes valide by the Lawes of the Church) went more really to worke, and by secret Instruments and cunning Agents, as well Matrons about the young Lady as Councellors, first sought to remoue the Point of Religion and Honour out of the minde of the Lady her selfe, wherein there was a double labour. For MAXIMILIAN was not onely contracted vnto the Lady, but MAXIMILIANS daughter was likewise contracted to King CHARLES. So as the Marriage halted vpon both feet, and was not cleare on either side: But for the Contract with King CHARLES, the Exception lay plaine and faire; for that MAXIMILIANS

daughter was vnder yeares of consent, and so not bound by Law, but a power of Disagreement left to either part. But for the Contract made by MAXIMILIAN with the Lady her selfe, they were harder driuen: hauing nothing to alledge, but that it was done without the consent of her Soueraigne Lord, King CHARLES, whose Ward and Client shee was, and Hee to her in place of a Father; and therfore it was void, and of no force, for want of such Consent. Which defect (they sayd) though it would not euacuate a Marriage, after Cohabitation, and Actuall Cosummation; yet it was enough to make void a Contract. For as for the pretended Consummation, they made sport with it, and said: That it was an argument, that MAXIMILIAN was a Widdower, and a cold Wooer, that could content himselfe to be a Bridgrome by Deputie, and would not make a little Iourney, to put all out of question. So that the young Lady, wrought vpon by these Reasons, finely instilled by such as the French King (who spared for no Rewards or Promises) had made on his side; and allured likewise by the present Glory and Greatnesse of King CHARLES. (being also a young King, and a Batchelor) and loth to make her Countrey the Seat of a long and miserable Warre; secretly yeelded to accept of King CHARLES. But during this secret Treatie with the Ladie, the better to saue it from Blasts of Opposition and Interruption, King CHARLES resorting to his wonted Arts, and thinking to carry the Marriage, as hee had carried the Warres, by entertaining the King of England in vaine beliefe, sent a solemne Ambassage by FRANCIS Lord of Luximburge, CHARLES MARIGNIAN and ROBERT GAGVIEN, Generall of the Order of the Bonnes Hommes of the Trinitie, to treat a Peace and League with the King; accoupling it with an Article in the nature of a Request, that the

               French King might with the Kings good will (according vnto his right of Seigniorie and Tutelage) dispose of the Marriage of the young Duchesse of Britaine, as hee should thinke good; offering by a Iudiciall proceeding to make void the Marriage of MAXIMILIAN by Proxie. Also all this while the better to amuse the world, hee did continue in his Court and custodie the Daughter of MAXIMILIAN, who formerly had beene sent vnto him, to bee bred and educated in France; not dismissing or renvoying her, but contrariwise professing and giuing out strongly, that hee meant to proceed with that Match. And that for the Duchesse of Britaine, hee desired onely to preserue his right of Seigniory, and to giue her in Marriage to some such Allye, as might depend vpon him.
            When the three Commissioners came to the Court of England, they deliuered their Ambassage vnto the King, who remitted them to his Councell; where some dayes after they had Audience, and made their Proposition by the Prior of the Trinitie (who though hee were third in place, yet was held the best Speaker of them) to this effect.
            
               MY Lords, the King our Master, the greatest and mightiest King that raigned in France since CHARLES the Great (whose Name he beareth) hath neuerthelesse thought it no disparagement to his Greatnesse, at this time to propound a Peace, yea, and to pray a Peace with the King of England. For which purpose hee hath sent vs his Commissioners, instructed and enabled with full and ample power,
               
               to treat and conclude; giuing vs further in charge, to open in some other businesse the secrets of his owne intentions. These be indeed the precious Loue-tokens betweene great Kings, to communicate one with another the true state of their affaires, and to passe by nice Points of Honour, which ought not to giue Law vnto Affection. This I doe assure your Lordships; It is not possible for you to imagine the true and cordiall Loue, that the King our Master beareth to your Soueraigne, except you were neare him, as we are. He vseth his Name with so great respect; he remembreth their first acquaintance at Paris with so great contentment; nay, hee neuer speakes of him, but that presently he falls into discourse of the miseries of great Kings, in that they cannot conuerse with their Equalls, but with Seruants. This affection to your Kings Person and Vertues, GOD hath put into the Heart of our Master, no doubt for the good of Christendome, and for purposes yet vnknowne to vs all. For other Root it cannot haue, since it was the same to the Earle of Richmond, that it is now to the King of England. This is therefore the first motiue that makes our King to desire Peace, and League with your Soueraigne: Good affection, and somewhat that hee findes in his owne Heart. This affection is also armed
               
with reason of Estate. For our King doth in all candour and franknesse of dealing open himselfe vnto you; that hauing an honourable, yea, and a holy Purpose, to make a Voyage and Warre in remote Parts, he considereth that it will be of no small effect, in point of Reputation to his enterprise, if it be knowne abroad, that hee is in good peace with all his Neighbour Princes, and specially with the King of England, whom for good causes he esteemeth most.
            But now (my Lords) giue me leaue to vse a few words to remoue all scruples and misse-vnderstandings, betweene your Soueraigne and ours, concerning some late Actions; which if they be not cleared, may perhaps hinder this Peace. To the end, that for matters past, neither King may conceiue vnkindnesse of other, nor think the other conceiueth vnkindnesse of him. The late Actions are two; That of Brittaine, and that of Flanders. In both which, it is true, that the Subiects swords of both Kings, haue encountred and stricken, and the wayes and Inclinations also of the two Kings, in respect of their Confederates and Allies, haue seuered.
            For that of Brittaine; The King your Soueraigne knoweth best what hath passed. It was a Warre of necessitie on our Masters part. And though the Motiues of it were sharp and piquant

as could be, yet did he make that Warre rather with an Oliue-branch, then a Laurel-Branch in his Hand, more desiring Peace then Victorie. Besides, from time to time he sent (as it were) Blank-papers to your King, to write the conditions of Peace. For though both his Honour and Safetie went vpon it, yet he thought neither of them too precious, to put into the King of Englands hands. Neither doth your King on the other side make any vnfriendly interpretation, of your Kings sending of succours to the Duke of Brittaine; for the King knoweth well, that many things must bee done of Kings for satisfaction of their People, and it is not hard to discerne what is a Kings owne. But this matter of Brittaine is now (by the Act of GOD) ended and passed; and (as the King hopeth) like the way of a Ship in the Sea, without leauing any impression in either of the Kings mindes; as hee is sure for his part it hath not done in his.
            For the Action of Flanders; As the former of Brittaine was a Warre of necessitie, so this was a Warre of Justice; which with a good King is of equall necessitie, with danger of Estate, for else hee should leaue to bee a King. The Subiects of Burgundie are Subiects in Chiefe to the Crown of France, and their Duke the Homager and Vassall of France. They had wont to bee good

Subiects, howsoeuer MAXIMILIAN hath of late distempered them. They fled to the King for Justice, and deliuerance from oppression, Justice hee could not denie; Purchase hee did not seeke. This was good for MAXIMILIAN, if he could haue seene it in people mutined, to arrect Fury, and preuent Despaire. My Lords, it may bee this I haue said is needlesse, saue that the King our Master is tender in any thing, that may but glance vpon the friendship of England. The amitie betweene the two Kings (no doubt) stands entire and inuiolate. And that their Subiects swords haue clashed, it is nothing vnto the publike Peace of the Crownes; it being a thing very vsuall in auxiliarie Forces of the best and straitest Confederates, to meet and draw bloud in the Field. Nay, many times there bee Aides of the same Nation on both sides, and yet it is not (for all that) A Kingdome diuided in it selfe.
            
            It resteth (my Lords) that Jimpart vnto you a matter, that I know your Lordships all will much reioyce to heare; as that which importeth the Christian Common-weale more, then any Action that hath hapned of long time. The King our Master hath a purpose and determination, to make Warre vpon the kingdome of Naples; being now in the possession of a Bastardslip of

               Arragon, but appertaining vnto his Maiestie, by cleare and vndoubted right; which if hee should not by iust Armes seeke to recouer, hee could neither acquite his Honour, nor answer it to his People. But his Noble and Christian thoughts rest not here. For his Resolution and Hope is, to make the Re-conquest of Naples, but as a Bridge, to transport his Forces into Grecia; and not to spare Bloud or Treasure (If it were to the impawning of his Crowne, and dis-peopling of France) till either hee hath ouerthrowne the Empire of the OTTOMANS, or taken it in his way to Paradise. The King knoweth well, that this is a designe; that could not arise in the minde of any King, that did not stedfastly looke vp vnto GOD, whose quarrell this is, and from whom commeth both the Will, and the Deed. But yet it is agreeable to the Person that hee beareth (though vnworthy) of the Thrice-Christian King, and the eldest Sonne of the Church. Whereunto he is also inuited by the Example (in more ancient time) of King HENRIE the Fourth of England, (the first Renowned King of the House of LANCASTER; Ancestour, though not Progenitour to your King) who had a purpose towards the end of his time (as you know better) to make an Expedition into the Holy-Land;
               
and by the Example also (present before his eyes) of that Honourable and Religious Warre which the King of Spaine now maketh, and hath almost brought to perfection, for the recouerie of the Realme of Granada from the Moores. And although this Enterprise may seeme vast and vnmeasured, for the King to attempt that by his owne Forces, wherein heretofore a Coniunction of most of the Christian Princes hath found worke enough; yet his Maiestie wisely considereth, that sometimes smaller Forces being vnited vnder one Command, are more effectuall in Proofe (though not so promising in Opinion and Fame) then much greater Forces, variously compounded by Associations and Leagues; which commonly in a short time after their Beginnings, turne to Dissociations &amp; Diuisions. But my (Lords) that which is as a Voice from Heauen that called the King to this Enterprise, is a Rent at this time in the House of the OTTOMANS. I doe not say, but there hath beene Brother against Brother in that House before, but neuer any that had refuge to the Armes of the Christians, as now hath GEMES, (Brother vnto BAIAZETH, that reigneth) the fore brauer Man of the two; the other being betweene a Monke and a Philosoper
               
and better read in the Alcoran and Auerroes, then able to weild the Scepter of so warlike an Empire. This therefore is the King our Masters memorable and heroicall Resolution for an Holy Warre. And because he carrieth in this the Person of a Christian Souldiour, as well as of a Great Temporall Monarch; hee beginneth with Humilitie, and is content for this cause, to begge Peace at the hands of other Christian Kings. There remaineth onely rather a Ciuill Request, then any essentiall part of our Negotiation, which the King maketh to the King your Soueraigne. The King (as the World knoweth) is Lord in Chiefe of the Duchie of Britaine. The Marriage of the Heire belongeth to him as Guardian. This is a priuate Patrimoniall Right, and no Businesse of Estate: yet neuerthelesse (to runne a faire course with your King; whom he desires to make another Himselfe, and to bee one and the same thing with him) his Request is, That with the Kings Fauour and Consent, he may dispose of her Marriage, as he thinketh good, and make void the intruded and pretended Marriage of MAXIMILIAN, according to Justice. This (my Lords) is all that I haue to say, desiring your pardon for my weakenesse in the deliuerie.
            
               
THus did the French Ambassadors with great shew of their Kings affection, and many sugred words seeke to adulce all matters betweene the two Kings, hauing two things for their ends; The one, to keepe the King quiet till the Marriage of Britaine was past, and this was but a Summer fruit, which they thought was almost ripe and would be soone gathered. The other was more lasting; and that was to put him into such a temper as he might be no disturbance or impediment to the voyage for Italie. The Lords of the Councell were silent; and said only, That they knew the Ambassadors would looke for no answer, till they had reported to the King; And so they rose from Councell. The King could not well tell what to thinke of the Marriage of Britaine. He saw plainly the ambition of the French King was to impatronize himselfe of the Duchie; but he wondred he would bring into his House a litigious Marriage, especially considering who was his Successor. But weighing one thing with another, he gaue Britaine for lost; but resolued to make his profit of this businesse of Britaine, as a quarrell for Warre; and that of Naples, as a Wrench and meane for Peace; being well aduertised, how strongly the King was bent vpon that Action. Hauing therefore conferred diuers times with his Councell, and keeping himselfe somewhat close; he gaue a direction to the Chancellor, for a formall answer to the Ambassadors, and that hee did in the presence of his Councell. And after calling the Chancellor to him apart, bade him speake in such language, as was fit for a Treatie that was to end in a Breach; and gaue him also a speciall Caueat, that he should not vse any words, to discourage the voyage of Italie. Soone after the Ambassadors were sent for to the Councell, and the Lord Chancellor spake to them in this sort.
            
               
               MY Lords Ambassadours, I shall make answer by the Kings Commandement, vnto the eloquent Declaration of you my Lord Prior, in a briefe and plaine manner. The King forgetteth not his former loue and acquaintance with the King your Master. But of this there needeth no repetition. For if it bee betweene them as it was, it is well; if there bee any alteration, it is not words that will make it vp.
            
            
               For the Businesse of Britaine, the King findeth it a little strange that the French King maketh mention of it, as matter of well deseruing at his hand. For that Deseruing was no more, but to make him his Instrument, to surprize one of his best Confederates. And for the Marriage, the King would not meddle in it if your Master would marry by the Book, and not by the Sword.
            
               For that of Flanders, if the Subiects of Burgundie had appealed to your King, as their Chiefe Lord, at first, by way of Supplication; it might haue had a shew of Justice. But it was a new forme of Processe, for Subiects to imprison their Prince first, and to slay his Officers, and then to be Complainants. The King saith, That sure he is, when the French King, and himselfe sent to the Subiects of Scotland (that
               
had taken Armes against their King) they both spake in another Stile, and did in princely manner signifie their detestation of Popular Attentates, vpon the Person or Authoritie of Princes. But my Lords Ambassadors, the King leaueth these two actions thus: That on the one side, hee hath not receiued any manner of satisfaction from you concerning them; and on the other, that he doth not apprehend them so deepely, as in respect of them, to refuse to treat of Peace, if other things may goe hand in hand. As for the Warre of Naples, and the Designe against the Turke; the King hath commanded me expressely to say, That hee doth wish with all his heart, to his good Brother the French King, that his Fortunes may succeede according to his Hopes, and honourable intentions. And whensoeuer he shall heare, that he is prepared for Grecia, as your Master is pleased now to say, that he beggeth a Peace of the King, so the King will then begge of him a part in that Warre.
            But now my Lords Ambassadours, I am to propound vnto you somewhat on the Kings part. The King your Master hath taught our King what to say and demand. You say (my Lord Prior) that your King is resolued to recouer his right to Naples, wrongfully detained from him.

And that if hee should not thus doe, he could not acquite his Honour, nor answere it to his People. Thinke (my Lords) that the King our Master saith the same thing ouer againe to you touching Normandie, Guien, Angeou, yea and the Kingdome of France it selfe. I cannot expresse it better then in your owne words: If therefore the French King shall consent, that the King our Masters Title to France (at least Tribute for the same) be handled in the Treatie, the King is content to goe on with the rest; otherwise he refuseth to Treat.
            THe Ambassadors being somwhat abashed with this demand, answered in some heat; That they doubted not, but the King their Soueraignes sword would be able to maintaine his Scepter: And they assured themselues, he neither could nor would yeeld to any diminution of the Crowne of France either in Territory or Regalitie. But howsoeuer, they were too great matters for them to speake of, hauing no Commission. It was replied, that the King looked for no other answer from them; but would forth-with send his own Ambassadors to the French King. There was a question also asked at the Table, Whether the French King would agree to haue the disposing of the Marriage of Britaine with an exception &amp; exclusion, that he should not marry her himselfe? To which the Ambassadors answered; That it was so farre out of their Kings thoughts, as they had receiued no Instructions touching the same. Thus were the Ambassadors dismissed, all saue the Prior; and were followed immediatly by THOMAS Earle of Ormond, and THOMAS GOLDENSTON Prior of

               Christ-Church in Canterbury; who were presently sent ouer into France. In the meane space, LIONELL Bishop of Concordia, was sent as Nuntio from Pope ALEXANDER the sixth to both Kings, to mooue a Peace betweene them. For Pope ALEXANDER finding himselfe pent and lockt vp, by a League and Association of the Principall States of Italie, that hee could not make his way for the aduancement of his owne House (which he immoderatly thirsted after) was desirous to trouble the waters in Italie, that hee might fish the better; casting the Net, not out of Saint PETERS, but out of BORGIA'S Barke. And doubting lest the feares fom England, might stay the French Kings voyage into Italie, dispatched this Bishop to compose all matters betweene the two Kings, if he could. Who first repaired to the French King, and finding him well inclined (as he conceiued) tooke on his Iourney towards England, and found the English Ambassadors at Calice, on their way towards the French King. After some conference with them, he was in Honourable manner transported ouer into England, where he had audience of the King. But notwithstanding hee had a good Ominous name to haue made a Peace, nothing followed. For in the meane time, the purpose of the French King to marry the Duchesse could be no longer dissembled. Wherefore the English Ambassadors (finding how things went) took their leaue, and returned. And the Prior also was warned from hence, to depart out of England. Who when he turned his backe (more like a Pedant, then an Ambassadour) dispersed a bitter Libell, in Latine Verse, against the King; vnto which the King (though hee had nothing of a Pedant) yet was content to cause an answer to bee made in like Verse; and that as speaking in his owne Person, but in a style of Scorne and Sport. About this time also was borne the Kings second Son

HENRY, who afterward reigned. And soone after followed the solemnization of the marriagee between CHARLES, and ANNE Duchesse of Britaine, with whom he receiued the Duchie of Britaine as her Dowry; the Daughter of MAXIMILIAN being a little before sent home. Which when it came to the Eares of MAXIMILIAN (who would neuer beleeue it till it was done, being euer the Principall in deceiuing himselfe, though in this the French King did very handsomely second it) and tumbling it ouer and ouer in his thoughts, that he should at one blowe (with such a double scorne) be defeated, both of the marriage of his daughter, and his owne (vpon both which hee had fixed high imaginations;) he lost all patience, and casting of the Respects fit to be continued betweene great Kings (euen when their bloud is hottest, and most risen) fell to bitter Inuectiues against the person and Actions of the French King. And (by how much he was the lesse able to do, talking so much the more) spake all the Iniuries he could deuise of CHARLES, saying; That he was the most perfidious man vpon the Earth, and that he had made a marriage compounded between an Aduoutry and a Rape: which was done (he said) by the iust iudgement of God; to the end, that (the Nullitie thereof being so appparant to all the World) the Race of so vnworthy a person might not reigne in France. And forthwith he sent Ambassadors as well to the King of England, as to the King of Spaine, to incite them to Warre, and to treat a League offensiue against France, promising to concurre with great Forces of his owne. Hereupon the King of England (going neuerthelesse his owne way) called a Parliament, it being the seuenth yeere of his Reigne; and the first day of opening thereof (sitting vnder his Cloth of Estate) spake himselfe vnto his Lords, and Commons in this manner.
            
               
MY Lords, and you the Commons, When I purposed to make a Warre in Britaine by my Lieutenant, I made declaration thereof to you by my Chancellor. But now that I meane to make a Warre vpon France in Person, I will declare it to you my Selfe. That Warre, was to desend another mans Right, but this is to recouer our owne; And that ended by Accident, but we hope this shall end in Victory.
            
            The French King troubles the Christian World. That which he hath, is not his owne, and yet he seeketh more. He hath inuested himselfe of Britaine. Hee maintaineth the Rebels in Flanders; and he threatneth Italy. For Our Selues, he hath proceeded from Dissimulation, to Neglect; and from Neglect to Contumely. He hath assayled our Confederates: He denieth our Tribute: In a word, he seekes Warre. So did not his Father, but sought Peace at Our Hands; and so perhaps will hee, when good Counsell or Time, shall make him see as much as his Father did.
            Meane while; let Us make his Ambition, our Aduantage; and let vs not stand vpon a few Crownes of Tribute, or Acknowledgement, but (by the fauour of Almighty GOD) try Our Right for the Crowne of France it selfe; remembring that there hath beene A
               
French King Prisoner in England, and a King of England Crowned in France. Our Confederates are not diminished. Burgundie is in a mightier Hand then euer, and neuer more prouoked. Britaine cannot helpe vs, but it may hurt them. New Acquests are more Burthen, then Strength. The Male-contents of his owne Kingdome haue not beene Base, Popular, nor Titularie Impostors, but of an higher Nature. The King of Spaine (doubt yee not) will ioyne with vs, not knowing where the French Kings Ambition will stay. Our Holy Father the Pope, likes no Tramontanes in Italie. But howsoeuer it bee, this Matter of Confederates, is rather to bee thought on, then reckoned on. For GOD forbid, but England should bee able to get Reason of France, without a Second.
            
            At the Battailes of Cressy, Poictiers, Agent-Court, wee were of our selues. France hath much people, and few Souldiours. They haue no stable Bands of Foot. Some good Horse they haue; but those are Forces, which are least fit for a Defensiue Warre, where the Actions are in the Assailants choice. It was our Discords onely, that lost France; and (by the Power of GOD)
               
it is the good Peace which wee now enioy, that will recouer it. GOD hath hitherto blessed my Sword. I haue in this time that I haue Reigned, weeded out my bad Subiects, and tryed my good. My People and I know one another; which breeds Confidence. And if there should bee any bad Bloud left in the Kingdome, an Honourable Forrain Warre will vent it, or purifie it. In this great Businesse, let me haue your Aduice, and Aid. If any of you were to make his Sonne Knight, you might haue aid of your Tenants by Law. This concernes the Knighthood and Spurres of the Kingdome, whereof I am Father; and bound not only to seeke to maintaine it, but to aduance it. But for Matter of Treasure, let it not be taken from the Poorest Sort; but from those, to whom the Benefit of the Warre may redound. France is no Wildernesse: and I, that professe Good Husbandrie, hope to make the Warre (after the Beginnings) to pay it selfe. Goe together in GODS Name, and loose no time; for I haue called this Parliament wholly for this Cause.
            
               
THus spake the King; But for all this, though hee shewed great forwardnesse for a Warre, not onely to his Parliament and Court, but to his Priuie-Councell likewise, (except the two Bishops and a few more) yet neuerthelesse in his secret intentions, hee had no purpose to goe through with any Warre, vpon France. But the truth was, that hee did but traffique with that Warre, to make his Returne in money. Hee knew well, that France was now entire, and at vnitie with it selfe, and neuer so mightie many yeares before. Hee saw by the taste that he had of his Forces sent into Britaine, that the French knew well enough how to make warre with the English; by not putting things to the hazard of a Battaile, but wearing them by long Sieges of Townes, and strong fortified Encampings. IAMES the Third of Scotland, (his true friend, and Confederate) gone; and IAMES the Fourth (that had succeeded) wholly at the deuotion of France, and ill affected towards him. As for the Coniunctions of FERDINANDO of Spaine, and MAXIMILIAN; hee could make no foundation vpon them. For the One had Power, and not Will; and the Other hath Will, and not Power. Besides that, FERDINANDO had but newly taken breath, from the Warre with the Moores; and merchanded at this time with France, for the restoring of the Counties of Russignon and Perpignian, oppignorated to the French. Neither was hee out of feare of the Discontents, and ill bloud within the Realme; which hauing vsed alwaies to represse and appease in person, hee was loth they should find him at a distance beyond Sea, and engaged in warre. Finding therfore the Inconueniences and Difficulties in the prosecution of a Warre, hee cast with himselfe how to compasse two things. The one, how by the declaration, and inchoation of a warre, to make his Profit. The other, how to come off from the warre,

with sauing of his Honour. For Profit, it was to bee made two wayes; vpon his Subiects for the Warre, and vpon his Enemies for the Peace; like a good Merchant, that maketh his gaine, both vpon the Commodities Exported, and Imported backe againe. For the point of Honour, wherein hee might suffer, for giuing ouer the Warre; hee considered well, that as hee could not trust vpon the aides of FERDINANDO and MAXIMILIAN for supports of Warre: so the impuissance of the one, and the double proceeding of the other, lay faire for him for occasions to accept of Peace. These things hee did wisely fore-see, and did as artificially conduct, wherby all things fell into his lappe, as hee desired.
            For as for the Parliament, it presently tooke fire, being affectionate (of old) the Warre of France; and desirous afresh to repaire the dishonour, they thought the King sustained by the losse of Britaine. Therfore they aduised the King (with great alacritie) to vndertake the Warre of France. And although the Parliament consisted of the First and Second Nobilitie (together with principall Citizens and Townesmen) yet worthily and iustly respecting more the People (whose deputies they were) then their owne priuate Persons, and finding by the Lord Chancellours speech the Kings inclination that way; they consented that Commissioners should goe forth, for the gathering and leuying of a Beneuolence, from the more able sort. This Tax (called Beneuolence) was deuised by EDWARD the Fourth, for which hee sustained much Enuie. It was abolished by RICHARD the Third by Act of Parliament, to ingratiate himselfe with the people; and it was now reuiued by the King, but with consent of Parliament, for so it was not in the time of King EDWARD the Fourth. But by this way hee raised exceeding great summes. Insomuch

as the Citie of London (in those dayes) contributed nine thousand pounds and better; and that chiefly leuied vpon the wealthier sort. There is a Tradition of a Dilemma, that Bishop MORTON the Chancellour vsed, to raise vp the Beneuolence to higher Rates; and some called it his Forke, and some his Crotch. For hee had couched an Article in the Instructions to the Commissioners, who were to leuie the Beneuolence; That if they met with any that were sparing, they should tell them, That they must needs haue, because they laid vp; and if they were spenders, they must needs haue, because it was seene in their Port, and manner of liuing. So neither kinde came amisse.
            This Parliament was meerly a Parliament of Warre; for it was in Substance, but a declaration of Warre against France and Scotland, with some Statutes conducing thereunto; As the seuere punishing of Mortpayes, and keeping backe of Souldiours wages in Captaines. The like seueritie for the departure of Souldiours without licence; Strengthening of the Common-Law in fauour of Protections, for those that were in the Kings seruice; And the setting the gate open and wide, for men to sell or Morgage their lands without Fines for Alienation, to furnish themselues with money for the Warre; And lastly, the voiding of all Scottishmen out of England. There was also a Statute, for the dispersing of the Standard of the Exchequer, throughout England; therby to size Weights and Measures; and two or three more of lesse importance.
            After the Parliament was broken vp (which lasted not long) the King went on with his Preparations for the Warre of France; yet neglected not in the meane time the affaires of MAXIMILIAN, for the quieting of Flanders, and restoring him to his authoritie amongst his Subiects. For at that time, the Lord of Rauenstein being not onely a Subiect rebelled, but a

               Seruant reuolted (and so much the more malicious and violent, by the aide of Bruges and Gaunt) had taken the Towne, and both the Castles of Sluice; as wee said before.
            And hauing (by the commoditie of the Hauen) gotten together certaine Ships and Barkes, fell to a kind of Pyraticall Trade; robbing and spoyling, and taking Prisoners the Ships and Vessels of all Nations, that passed alongst that Coast, towards the Mart of Antwerpe, or into any part of Brabant, Zeland, or Freezland; being euer well victualled from Picardie, besides the commoditie of Victuals from Sluice, and the Countrey adjacent, and the auailes of his owne Prizes. The French assisted him still vnder-hand; and hee likewise (as all men doe, that haue beene of both sides) thought himselfe not safe, except hee depended vpon a third Person.
            
            There was a small Towne some two miles from Bruges, towards the Sea, called Dam; which was a Fort and Approch to Bruges, and had a relation also to Sluice. This Towne the King of the Romans had attempted often, (not for any worth of the Towne in it selfe, but because it might choake Bruges, and cut it off from the Sea) and euer failed. But therewith the Duke of Saxonie came downe into Flanders, taking vpon him the Person of an Vmpire, to compose things betweene MAXIMILIAN and his Subiects; but being (indeed) fast and assured to MAXIMILIAN. Vpon this Pretext of Neutralitie and Treatie, hee repaired to Bruges; desiring of the States of Bruges, to enter peaceably into their Towne, with a Retinue of some number of men of Armes, fit for his Estate; being somewhat the more (as hee said) the better to guard him in a Countrey, that was vp in Armes: and bearing them in hand, that hee was to communicate with them of diuers matters of great importance, for

their good. Which hauing obtained of them, hee sent his Carriages and Harbingers before him, to prouide his Lodging. So that his Men of Warre entred the Citie in good Array, but in peaceable manner, and he followed. They that went before, enquired still for Innes and Lodgings, as if they would haue rested there all Night, and so went on, till they came to the Gate, that leadeth directly towards Dam; and they of Bruges only gazed vpon them and gaue them passage. The Captaines and inhabitants of Dam also suspected no harme, from any that passed through Bruges; and discouering Forces a farre off, supposed they had beene some Succours, that were come from their Friends, knowing some Dangers towards them. And so perceiuing nothing but well, till it was too late, suflered them to enter their Towne. By which kinde of Sleight rather then Stratageme, the Towne of Dam was taken and the Town of Bruges shrewdly blockt vp, wherby they tooke great discouragement.
            The Duke of Saxonie hauing wonne the Towne of Dam, sent immediatly to the King to let him know that it was Sluice chiefely, and the Lord RAVENSTEIN, that kept the Rebellion of Flanders in life; And that if it pleased the King to besiege it by Sea, he also would besiege it by Land, and so cut out the Core of those Warres.
            The King willing to vphold the Authoritie of MAXIMILIAN (the better to hold France in awe) and being likewise sued vnto by his Merchants, for that the Seas were much infested by the Barkes of the Lord RAVENSTEIN; sent straightwayes Sir EDWARD POYNINGS, a valiant man, and of good seruice, with twelue Ships, well furnished with Souldiers and Artillerie, to cleare the Seas, and to besiege Sluice on that part. The Englishmen did not only coupe vp the Lord RAVENSTEIN, that hee

stirred not, and likewise hold in strait Siege the Maritime part of the Towne; but also assailed one of the Castles, and renewed the assault so for twentie dayes space (issuing still out of their Ships at the Ebbe) as they made great slaughter of them of the Castle; who continually fought with them to repulse them, though of the English part also were slaine a brother of the Earle of Oxfords, and some fiftie more.
            But the Siege still continuing more and more strait, and both the Castles (which were the principall strength of the Towne) being distressed, the one by the Duke of Saxonie, and the other by the English; and a Bridge of boats, which the Lord RAVENSTEIN had made betweene both Castles, whereby Succours and Releefe might passe from the one to the other, being on a night set on fire by the English, hco despairing to hold the Towne, yeelded (at the last) the Castles to the English, and the Towne to the Duke of Saxonie, by composition. Which done, the Duke of Saxonie and Sir EDWARD POYNINGS treated with them of Bruges, to submit themselues to MAXIMILIAN their Lord; which after some time they did, paying (in some good part) the Charge of the Warre, whereby the Almaines and forraigne Succours were dismissed. The example of Bruges, other of the Reuolted Townes followed; so that MAXIMILIAN grew to be out of danger, but (as his manner was to handle matters) neuer out of necessitie. And Sir EDWARD POYNINGS (after he had continued at Sluice some good while, till all things were setled) returned vnto the King, being then before Bulleigne.
            
            Somewhat about this time came Letters from FERDINANDO, and ISABELLA, King and Queene of Spaino; signifying the finall conquest of

               Granada from the Moores; which action in it selfe so worthie, King FERDINANDO (whose manner was neuer to lose any vertue for the shewing) had expressed and displayed in his letters at large, with all the particularities, and religious Punctoes and Ceremonies, that were obserued in the reception of that Citie and Kingdome: Shewing amongst other things, That the King would not by any meanes in person enter the Citie, vntill hee had first aloofe seene the Crosse set vp vpon the greater Tower of Granada, whereby it became Christian ground: That likewise before hee would enter, he did Homage to God aboue, pronouncing by an Herauld from the Height of that Tower, that hee did acknowledge to haue recouered that Kingdome, by the helpe of GOD Almightie and the glorious Virgin, and the vertuous Apostle Saint IAMES, and the holy Father INNOCENT the Eight, together with the aides and seruices of his Prelates, Nobles, and Commons: That yet he stirred not from his Campe, till hee had seene a little Armie of Martyrs, to the number of seuen hundred and more Christians (that had liued in bonds and seruitude as Slaues to the Moores) passe before his Eyes, singing a Psalme for their redemption, and that he had giuen Tribute vnto GOD by Almes, and releefe, extended to them all, for his admission into the Citie. These things were in the Letters, with many more Ceremonies of a kind of Holy Ostentation.
            
            The King euer willing to put himselfe into the Consort or Quire of all religious Actions, and naturally affecting much the King of Spaine, (as farre as one King can affect another) partly for his vertues, and partly for a counterpoise to France; vpon the receipt of these Letters, sent all his Nobles and Prelates, that were about the Court, together with the Maior and Aldermen of London, in great solemnitie to the Church

of Pauls; there to heare a Declaration from the Lord Chancellor, now Cardinall. When they were assembled, the Cardinall (standing vpon the vppermost step or Halfe-pase before the Quire; and all the Nobles, Prelates, and Gouernours of the Citie at the foot of the Staires) made a Speech to them; letting them know, that they were assembled in that Consecrate place, to sing vnto God a New-song; For that (said he) these many yeares the Christians haue not gayned new ground or Territorie vpon the Infidels, nor enlarged and set further the Bounds of the Christian-world: But this is now done, by the prowesse and deuotion of FERDINANDO and ISABELLA, Kings of Spaine; Who haue (to their immortall Honour) recouered the great and rich Kingdome of Granada, and the populous and mightie Citie of the same name, from the Moores, hauing beene in possession thereof by the space of seuen hundred yeares, and more. For which, this Assembly and all Christians are to render laud and thankes vnto God, and to celebrate this noble Act of the King of Spaine; who in this is not only Victorious, but Apostolicall, in the gaining of new Prouinces to the Christian Faith. And the rather, for that this Victorie and Conquest is obtained, without much effusion of bloud. Whereby it is to bee hoped, that there shall bee gained, not only new Territorie, but infinite soules, to the Church of Christ; whom the Almightie (as it seemes) would haue liue to bee conuerted. Herewithall hee did relate some of the most memorable Particulars of the Warre and Victorie. And after his Speech ended, the whole assemblie went solemnely in Procession, and Te Deum was sung.
            Immediately after the Solemnitie, the King kept his May Day at his Palace of Sheine, now Richmond. Where to warme the blood of his Nobilitie, and Gallants,
               
against the warre, hee kept great Triumphs of Iusting and Tourney, during all that Moneth. In which space it so fell our, that Sir IAMES PARKER, and HVGH VAVGHAH, (one of the Kings Gentlemen-Vshers) hauing had a Controuersie touching certaine Armes, that the King at Armes had giuen VAVGHAN, were appointed to runne some Courses one against an other. And by accident of a faultie Helmet, that PARKER had on, he was stricken into the mouth at the first course, so that his tongue was borne vnto the hinder part of his head, in such sort that hee died presently vpon the Place. Which because of the Controuersie precedent, and the Death that followed, was accounted amongst the Vulgar, as a Combate or Tryall of Right. The King, towards the end of this Summer, hauing put his Forces, where with hee meant to inuade France, in readinesse, (but so as they were not yet met or mustered together) sent VRSWICK (now made his Almoner) and Sir IOHN RISLEY, to MAXIMILIAN; to let him know, that hee was in Armes, ready to passe the Seas into France, and did but expect to heare from him, when and where he did appoint to ioyne with him, according to his promise made vnto him by COVNTEBALT, his Ambassador.
            
            The English Ambassadors, hauing repaired to MAXIMILIAN, did finde his power and promise at a very great distance; hee being vtterly vnprouided of Men, Money, and Armes, for any such enterprize. For MAXIMILIAN, hauing neither Wing to flie on (for that his Patrimony of Austria was not in his hands, his Father beeing then liuing: And on the other side, his Matrimonial Territories of Flanders being partly in Dowre to his Mother-in-law, and partly not seruiceable, in respect of the late Rebellions) was thereby destitute of meanes to enter into Warre. The Ambassadors
               
saw this well, but wisely thought fit to aduertise the King thereof, rather than to returne themselues till the Kings further pleasure were knowne: The rather, for that MAXIMILIAN himselfe spake as great, as euer hee did before, and entertained them with dilatory Answers; so as the formall part of their Ambassage might well warrant and require their further stay. The King hereupon (who doubted as much before, and saw through his businesse from the beginning) wrote backe to the Ambassadors, commending their discretion in not returning, and willing them to keepe the State wherein they found MAXIMILIAN, as a Secret, till they heard further from him; And meane while went on with his Voyage Royall for France, suppressing for a time this Aduertisement touching MAXIMILIAN'S pouertie and disabilitie.
            By this time, was drawne together a great and puissant Armie into the Citie of London. In which were THOMAS Marquesse Dorset, THOMAS Earle of Arundell, THOMAS Earle of Derby, GEORGE Earle of Shrewsbury, EDMOND Earle of Suffolke, EDWARD Earle of Deuonshire, GEORGE Earle of Kent, the Earle of Essex, THOMAS Earle of Ormond, with a great number of Barons, Knights, and Principall Gentlemen; and amongst them, RICHARD THOMAS, much noted for the braue Troupes that hee brought out of Wales; The Armie rising in the whole to the number of fiue and twenty thousand Foot, and sixteene hundred Horse. Ouer which, the King (constant in his accustomed trust and imployment) made IASPER Duke of Bedford, and IOHN Earle of Oxford, Generals vnder his owne Person. The ninth of September, in the eighth yeere of his Reigne, he departed from Greenwich, towards the Sea; all men wondring, that hee tooke that Season (beeing

so neare winter) to begin the Warre; and some thereupon gathering it was a Signe, that the Warre would not beelong. Neuerthelesse, the King gaue out the contrarie, thus: That he intending not to make a Summer businesse of it, but a resolute Warre (without terme prefixed vntill bee recouered France; it skilled not much when bee began it: especially, hauing Calice at his backe; where he might winter, if the reason of the Warre so required. The sixt of October, hee imbarqued at Sandwich; and the same day tooke land at Calice: which was the Rendezvous, where all his Forces were assigned to meet. But in this his Iourney towards the Sea side (wherein, for the cause that we shall now speake of, he houered so much the longer) hee had receiued Letters from the Lord CORDES: who the hotter he was against the English in time of Warre, had the more credit in a Negociation of Peace; and besides was held a man open, and of good faith. In which Letters there was made an Ouerture of Peace from the French King, with such Conditions, as were somewhat to the Kings Taste: but this was carried at the first with wonderfull secrecie. The King was no sooner come to Calice, but the calme windes of Peace began to blow. For, first, the English Ambassadors returned out of Flanders from MAXIMILIAN, and certified the King, that he was not to hope for any aide from MAXIMILIAN, for that he was altogether improuided. His will was good; but he lacked mony. And this was made knowne, and spread through the Army. And although the English were therewithall nothing dismaied; and that it bee the manner of Souldiers, vpon bad newes to speake the more brauely: yet neuerthelesse, it was a kind of Preparatiue to a Peace. Instantly in the neck of this (as the King had laid it) came newes that FERDINANDO and ISABELLA, Kings of Spaine, had concluded a Peace with King CHARLES;

and that CHARLES had restored vnto them the Counties of Russignon and Perpignian, which formerly were Morgaged by IOHN King of Arragon (FERDINANDOES Father) vnto France, for three hundred thousand Crownes: which debt was also, vpon this Peace, by CHARLES clearely released. This came also handsomely to put on the Peace: both because so potent a Confederate was fallen off, and because it was a faire example of a Peace bought; so as the King should not bee the sole Merchant in this Peace. Vpon these Aires of Peace, the King was content, that the Bishop of Excester, and the Lord DAVBIGNEY (Gouernour of Calice) should giue a meeting vnto the Lord CORDES, for the Treatie of a Peace. But himselfe neuerthelesse, and his Armie, the fifteenth of October, remooued from Calice, and in foure dayes march sate him downe before Bulloigne.
            
            During this Siege of Bulloigne (which continued neare a Moneth) there passed no memorable Action, no
                  •
                Accident of Warre: onely Sir IOHN SAVAGE, a valiant Captaine, was slaine, riding about the Walls of the Towne, to take a View. The Towne was both well fortified, and well manned; yet it was distressed, and ready for an Assault. Which if it had beene giuen (as was thought) would haue cost much Bloud; but yet the Towne would haue beene carried in the end. Meane while, a Peace was concluded by the Commissioners, to continue for both the Kings Liues. Where there was no Article of importance; being in effect, rather a Bargaine, than a Treatie. For, all things remayned as they were: saue that there should bee payed to the King seuen hundred fortie fiue thousand Duckats in present, for his Charges in that Iourney; and fiue and twentie thousand Crownes yearely, for his Charges sustained

in the Aides of the Britons. For wich Annuall, though he had MAXIMILIAN bound before for those Charges; yet hee counted the alteration of the Hand, as much as the principall Debt. And besides, it was left somewhat indefinitely, when it should determine or expire: which made the English esteeme it as a Tribute, carried vnder faire Tearmes. And the truth is, it was paid both to the King, and to his Sonne King HENRY the Eight, longer than it could continue vpon any computation of Charges. There were also assigned by the French King, vnto al the King's principal Counsellors, great Pensions, besides rich Gifts for the present. Which whether the King did permit, to saue his owne Purse from Rewards, or to communicate the Enuie of a Businesse, that was displeasing to his People, was diuersly interpreted. For certainly, the King had no great fancie to owne this Peace. And therefore, a little before it was concluded, he had vnder-hand procured some of his best Captaines, and Men of Warre, to aduise him to a Peace vnder their Hands, in an earnest manner, in the Nature of a Supplication. But, the truth is, this Peace was welcome to both Kings. To CHARLES, for that it assured vnto him the possession of Britaine, and freed the enterprise of Naples. To HENRY, for that it filled his Coffers; and that hee foresaw at that time a storme of inward troubles comming vpon him; which presently after brake forth. But it gaue no lesse discontent to the Nobilitie, and principall persons of the Armie; who had many of them sold or engaged their estates, vpon the hopes of the Warre. They stucke not to say, That the King cared not to plume his Nobilitie and People, to feather himselfe. And some made themselues merrie with that the King had said in Parliament: That after the Warre was once begun, he doubted not but to make it pay it selfe; saying hee had kept promise.
            
               
Hauing risen from Bulloigne, hee went to Calice, where hee stayed some time. From whence also hee wrote Letters, (which was a Courtesie that hee sometimes vsed) to the Maior of London, and Aldermen his brethren; halfe bragging, what great summes hee had obtayned for the Peace; knowing well, that full Cofers of the King, is euer good Newes to London. And better Newes it would haue beene, if their Beneuolence had beene but a Loane. And vpon the seuenteenth of December following, hee returned to Westminster, where he kept his Christmasse.
            
            Soone after the Kings returne, he sent the Order of the Garter, to ALPHONSO Duke of Calabria, eldest sonne to FERDINANDO King of Naples; An honour sought by that Prince, to hold him vp in the eyes of the Italians: Who, expecting the Armes of CHARLES, made great account of the Amitie of England, for a Bridle to France. It was receiued by ALPHONSO, with all the Ceremonie and Pomp that could bee deuised; as things vse to be carried, that are intended for Opinion. It was sent by VRSWICK: vpon whom the King bestowed this Ambassage, to helpe him, after many drie Employments.
            AT this time the King began againe to be haunted with Sprites, by the Magicke and curious Arts of the Lady MARGARET: Who raysed vp the Ghost of RICHARD, Duke of Yorke, second Sonne to King EDWARD the Fourth, to walke and vex the King. This was a finer Counterfeit Stone, than LAMBERT SYMNELL, better done, and worne vpon greater hands; being graced after, with the wearing of a King of France, and a King of Scotland, not of a Duchesse of Burgundie onely. And for SIMNELL, there was not much in him, more than that

hee was a handsome Boy, and did not shame his Robes. But this Youth (of whom wee are now to speake) was such a Mercuriall, as the like hath seldome beene knowne, and could make his owne Part, if at any time hee chanced to bee out. Wherefore, this being one of the strangest Examples of a Personation, that euer was in Elder or Later Times; it deserueth to bee discouered, and related at the full: Although the Kings manner of shewing things, by Peeces and by Darke Lights, hath so muffled it, that it hath left it almost as a Mysterie to this day.
            The Lady MARGARET (whom the Kings Friends called IVNO, because shee was to him as IVNO was to AENEAS, stirring both Heauen and Hell, to doe him mischiefe) for a foundation of her particular Practices against him, did continually, by all meanes possible, nourish, maintaine, and divulge the flying Opinion, That RICHARD, Duke of Yorke (second Sonne to EDWARD the Fourth) was not murthered in the Tower (as was giuen out) but saued aliue; For that those, who were imployed in that barbarous Fact, hauing destroyed the elder Brother, were stricken with remorse and compassion towards the younger, and set him priuily at libertie, to seeke his Fortune. This Lure shee cast abroad, thinking that this Fame and Beleefe (together with the fresh Example of LAMBERT SIMNELL) would draw at one time, or other, some Birds to strike vpon it. Shee vsed likewise a further diligence, not committing all to Chance. For, she had some secret Espials (like to the Turks Commissioners for Children of Tribute) to looke abroad for handsome and gracefull Youths, to make PLANTAGENETS, and Dukes of Yorke. At the last she did light on one, in whom all things met, as one would wish, to serue her turne, for a Counterfeit of RICHARD, Duke of York.
            
            
               
This was PERKIN WARBECK whose Aduentures wee shall now describe. For, first, the yeares agreed well. Secondly, hee was a Youth of fine fauour and shape. But, more than that, hee had such a craftie and bewitching fashion, both to mooue Pitie, and to induce Beleefe, as was like a kind of Fascination, and Inchantment, to those that saw him, or heard him. Thirdly, he had beene from his Child-hood such a Wanderer, or (as the King called him) such a Land-loper, as it was extreme hard to hunt out his Nest and Parents. Neither againe could any man, by companie or conuersing with him, be able to say or detect well what hee was; he did so flit from place to place Lastly, there was a Circumstance (which is mentioned by one that wrote in the same time) that is very likely to haue made somewhat to the matter; which is, That King EDWARD the Fourth was his God-father. Which, as it is somewhat suspicious, for a wanton Prince to become Gossip in so meane a House; and might make a man thinke, that hee might indeed haue in him some base Bloud of the House of YORKE: so at the least (though that were not) it might giue the occasion to the Boy, in being called King EDWARDS God-sonne, or perhaps in sport, King EDWARDS Sonne, to entertaine such Thoughts into his Head. For, Tutor hee had none (for ought that appeares) as LAMBERT SIMNELL had, vntill hee came vnto the Lady MARGARET, who instructed him.
            Thus therefore it came to passe: There was a Townes-man of Tourney, that had borne office in that Towne, whose name was IOHN OSBECKE, a Convert-Iew, married to CATHERINE DE FARO; whose businesse drew him, to liue for a time with his wife at London, in King EDWARD the fourths daies. During which time hee had a sonne by her: and being knowne in Court, the King either out of a religious

Noblenesse, because hee was a Conuert, or vpon some priuate acquaintance, did him the Honour, as to bee Godfather to his child, and named him PETER. But, afterwards, proouing a dainty and effeminate Youth, hee was commonly called by the Diminutiue of his name; PETER-KIN, or PERKIN. For, as for the name of WARBECKE, it was giuen him when they did but guesse at it, before examinations had been taken. But yet hee had been so much talked on by that name; as it stucke by him after his true name of OSBECKE was knowne. While hee was a young child his Parents returned with him to Tourney. Then was hee placed in a house of a kinsman of his, called IOHN STENBECK, at Antwerpe: and so roued vp and down betweene Antwerp and Tourney, and other Townes of Flanders, for a good time; liuing much in English Companie, and hauing the English Tongue perfect. In which time, beeing growne a comely Youth, hee was brought by some of the espialls of the Lady MARGARET vnto her Presence. Who viewing him well, and seeing that hee had a Face and personage, that would beare a noble fortune: And finding him otherwise of a fine spirit, and winning behauiour; thought she had now found a curious Peece of Marble, to carue out an Image of a Duke of Yorke. Shee kept him by her a great while; but, with extreme secrecy. The while, shee instructed him, by many Cabinet-Conferences. First, in Princely behauiour and gesture; teaching him how hee should keepe State, and yet with a modest sense of his misfortunes. Then shee informed him of all the circumstances and particulars, that concerned the Person of RICHARD Duke of Yorke, which hee was to act: Describing vnto him the Personages, Lineaments, and Features of the King and Queen, his pretended Parents; and of his Brother, and Sisters, and diuers others, that were neerest him in his Childhood;

together with all passages, some secret, some common, that were fit for a Childs memorie, vntill the death of King EDWARD. Then she added the particulars of the time, from the Kings death, vntill hee and his brother were committed to the Tower, aswell during the time hee was abroad, as while he was in Sanctuarie. As for the times while hee was in the Tower, and the manner of his Brothers death, and his owne escape; shee knew they were things that a verie few could controll. And therfore she taught him, onely to tell a smooth and likely Tale of those matters; warning him not to vary from it. It was agreed likewise betweene them, what account he should giue of his Peregrination abroad; intermixing many things which were true, and such as they knew others could testifie, for the credit of the rest: but, still making them to hang together, with the Part hee was to play. Shee taught him likewise how to auoid sundry captious and tempting questions, which were like to bee asked of him. But, in this shee found him of himselfe so nimble and shifting, as shee trusted much to his owne wit and readinesse; and therefore laboured the lesse in it. Lastly, shee raysed his thoughts with some present rewards, and further promises; setting before him chiefly the glorie, and fortune of a Crowne, if things went well; and a sure refuge to her Court, if the worst should fall. After such time as shee thought hee was perfect in his Lesson, shee began to cast with herselfe from what coast this Blazing-starre should first appeare, and at what time it must bee vpon the Horizon of Ireland; for, there had the like Meteor strong influence before: The time of the Apparition to bee, when the King should bee engaged into a Warre with France. But well she knew, that whatsoeuer should come from her, would bee held suspected. And therfore, if hee should goe out of Flanders immediately into Ireland,
               
shee might bee thought to haue some hand in it. And besides, the time was not yet ripe; for that the two Kings were then vpon tearmes of Peace. Therefore shee wheel'd about; and to put all suspicion a far off, and loth to keepe him any longer by her (for that shee knew Secrets are not long liued) shee sent him vnknowne into Portugall, with the Lady BRAMPTON, an English Ladie, that embarqued for Portugall at that time; with some Priuado of her owne, to haue an eye vpon him: and there hee was to remaine, and to expect her further directions In the meane time, shee omitted not to prepare things for his better welcome, and accepting, not onely in the Kingdome of Ireland, but in the Court of France. Hee continued in Portugall about a yeare; and, by that time, the King of England called his Parliament (as hath beene said) and declared open Warre against France. Now did the Signe reigne, and the Constellation was come, vnder which PERKIN should appeare. And therefore hee was straight sent vnto by the Duchesse, to goe for Ireland, according to the first designement. In Ireland hee did arriue at the Towne of Corke. When hee was thither come, his owne Tale was (when hee made his Confession afterwards) That the Irish-men, finding him in some good Clothes, came flocking about him, and bare him downe, that he was the Duke of Clarence, that had beene there before, And after, that hee was RICHARD the Thirds base sonne; And lastly, that he was RICHARD Duke of Yorke, second sonne to EDWARD the Fourth: But that hee (for his part) renounced all these things, and offered to sweare vpon the holy Euangelists, that hee was no such man; till, at last, thy forced it vpon him, and bade him feare nothing, and so forth. But the truth is, that immediately vpon his comming into Ireland, hee tooke vpon him the said Person of the

               Duke of York, and drew vnto him Complices, and Partakers, by all the meanes hee could deuise: Insomuch, as hee wrote his Letters vnto the Earles of Desmond and Kildare, to come in to his Aide, and bee of his Partie; the Originalls of which Letters are yet extant.
            Somewhat before this time, the Duchesse had also gayned vnto her, a neare seruant of King HENRY's owne, one STEPHEN FRION, his Secretarie for the French Tongue; an actiue man, but turbulent, and discontented. This FRION had fled ouer to CHARLES the French King, and put himselfe into his seruice, at such time as hee began to bee in open enmitie with the King. Now King CHARLES, when he vnderstood of the Person and Attempts of PERKIN (readie of himselfe to embrace all aduantages against the King of England; instigated by FRION, and formerly prepared by the Ladie MARGARET) forthwith dispatched one LVCAS, and this FRION, in the nature of Ambassadors to PERKIN; to aduertise him of the Kings good inclination to him, and that hee was resolued to aide him, to recouer his right against King HENRY, an Vsurper of England, and an Enemie of France; and wished him, to come ouer vnto him at Paris. PERKIN thought himselfe in heauen, now that hee was inuited by so great a King, in so honourable a manner; And imparting vnto his Friends in Ireland for their incouragement, how Fortune called him, and what great hopes hee had, sayled presently into France. When hee was come to the Court of France, the King receiued him with great honour; saluted, and stiled him by the name of the Duke of Yorke; lodged him, and accommodated him in great State; And the better to giue him the representation and the countenance of a Prince, assigned him a Guard for his Person, whereof the Lord CONGRESALL was Captaine. The Courtiers
               
likewise (though it bee ill mocking with the French) applyed themselues to their Kings Bent, seeing there was reason of State for it. At the same time there repaired vnto PERKIN diuers Englishmen of Qualitie; Sir GEORGE NEVILE, Sir IOHN TAYLOR, and about one hundred more: and amongst the rest, this STEPHEN FRION, of whom wee spake; who followed his fortune both then and for a long time after, and was indeed his principall Counsellor, and Instrument in all his Proceedings. But all this, on the French Kings part, was but a Tricke, the better to bow King HENRY to Peace. And therefore vpon the first Graine of Incense, that was sacrificed vpon the Altar of Peace at Bulloigne, PERKIN was smoked away. Yet would not the French King deliuer him vp to King HENRY (as hee was laboured to doe) for his Honors sake, but warned him away, and dismissed him. And PERKIN on his part was as readie to bee gone, doubting hee might bee caught vp vnder hand. Hee therefore tooke his way into Flanders, vnto the Duchesse of Burgundie; pretending, that, hauing beene variously tossed by Fortune, hee directed his course thither, as to a safe Harbour: No wayes taking knowledge, that he had euer beene there before, but as if that had beene his first addresse. The Duchesse, on the other part, made it as new and strange to see him: pretending (at the first) that she was taught and made wise by the example of LAMBERT SIMNELL, how shee did admit of any Counterfeit Stuffe; though euen in that (she said) she was not fully satisfied. Shee pretended at the first (and that was euer in the presence of others) to pose him and sift him, thereby to trie whether hee were indeed the very Duke of Yorke, or no. But, seeming to receiue full satisfaction by his answers, shee then fained her selfe to be transported with a kind of astonishment,

mixt of Ioy and Wonder, at his miraculous deliuerance; receiuing him, as if hee were risen from Death to Life: and inferring, that GOD, who had in such wonderfull manner preserued him from Death, did likewise reserue him for some great and prosperous Fortune. As for his dismission out of France, they interpreted it not, as if hee were detected or neglected for a Counterfeit Deceiuer; but contrariwise, that it did shew manifestly vnto the World, that hee was some Great matter; for that it was his abandoning, that (in effect) made the Peace: being no more but the sacrificing of a poore distressed Prince vnto the vtilitie and Ambition of two Mightie Monarchs. Neither was PERKIN for his part wanting to himselfe, either in gracious and princely behauiour, or in ready and apposite answers, or in contenting and caressing those that did applie themselues vnto him, or in prettie scorne and disdaine to those that seemed to doubt of him; but in all things did notably acquite himselfe: Insomuch as it was generally beleeued (aswell amongst great Persons, as amongst the Vulgar) that he was indeed Duke RICHARD. Nay, himselfe, with long and continuall counterfeiting, and with oft telling a Lye, was turned by habit almost into the thing heesee med to bee; and from a Lyer, to a Beleeuer. The Duchesse therefore (as in a case out of doubt) did him all princely honour, calling him alwaies by the name of her Nephew, and giuing him the Delicate Title of the White-rose of England; and appointed him a Guard of thirtie Persons, Halberdiers, clad in a Party-coloured Liuerie of Murrey and Blue, to attend his Person. Her Court likewise, and generally the Dutch and Strangers in their vsage towards him, expressed no lesse respect.
            The Newes hereof came blazing and thundering ouer into England, that the Duke of Yorke was sure

aliue. As for the name of PERKIN WARBECK, it was not at that time come to light, but all the newes ranne vpon the Duke of Yorke; that hee had beene entertayned in Ireland, bought and sold in France, and was now plainly auowed, and in great honour in Flanders. These Fames tooke hold of diuers; In some vpon discontent, in some vpon ambition, in some vpon leuitie and desire of change, and in some few vpon conscience and beleefe, but in most vpon simplicitie; and in diuers out of dependance vpon some of the better sort, who did in secret fauour and nourish these bruits. And it was not long, ere these rumours of Noueltie, had begotten others of Scandall and Murmur against the King, and his gouernment; taxing him for a great Taxer of his People, and discountenancer of his Nobilitie. The losse of Britaine, and the Peace with France were not forgotten. But chiefly they fell vpon the wrong that hee did his Queene, in that hee did not reigne in her Right. Wherefore they said, that GOD had now brought to light a Masculine-Branch of the House of YORKE, that would not bee at his Curtesie, howsoeuer hee did depresse his poore Ladie. And yet (as it fareth in things which are currant with the Multitude, and which they affect) these Fames grew so generall, as the Authors were lost in the generalitie of Speakers. They being like running Weedes, that haue no certaine root; or like Footings vp and downe, impossible to be traced. But after a while, these ill Humours drew to an head, and setled secretly in some eminent Persons; which were Sir WILLIAM STANLEY Lord Chamberlaine of the Kings Houshold, The Lord FITZ-WATER, Sir SIMON MOVNTFORT, Sir THOMAS THWAITES. These entred into a secret Conspiracie to fauour Duke RICHARDS Title. Neuerthelesse none engaged their fortunes in this businesse openly, but two; Sir

ROBERT CLIFFORD, and Master WILLIAM BARLEY, who sailed ouer into Flanders, sent indeed from the Partie of the Conspiratours here, to vnderstand the truth of those things, that passed there, and not without some helpe of monies from hence; Prouisionally to bee deliuered, if they found and were satisfied, that there was truth in these pretences. The person of Sir ROBERT CLIFFORD (being a Gentleman of Fame and Familie) was extremely welcome to the Ladie MARGARET. Who after shee had conference with him, brought him to the sight of PERKIN, with whom hee had often speech and discourse. So that in the end wonne either by the Duchesse, to affect, or by PERKIN to beleeue, hee wrote backe into England, that he knew the Person of RICHARD Duke of Yorke, as well as hee knew his owne; and that this Young-man was vndoubtedly hee. By this meanes all things grew prepared to Reuolt and Sedition here, and the Conspiracie came to haue a Correspondence betweene Flanders and England.
            
            The King on his part was not asleepe; but to Arme or leuie Forces yet, he thought would but shew feare, and doe this Idoll too much worship. Neuerthelesse the Ports hee did shut vp, or at least kept a Watch on them, that none should passe to or fro that was suspected. But for the rest, hee choose to worke by Countermine. His purposes were two; the one, to lay open the Abuse. The other, to breake the knot of the Conspirators. To detect the Abuse, there were but two wayes; The first, to make it manifest to the world, that the Duke of Yorke was indeed murthered: The other, to prooue, that were he dead or aliue, yet PERKIN was a Counterfeit. For the first, thus it stood. There were but foure Persons that could speake vpon knowledge, to the murther of the Duke of Yorke: Sir IAMES TIRREL (the employed-man from King RICHARD)

IOHN DIGHTON, and MILES FORREST, his seruants (the two Butchers or Tormentors) and the Priest of the Tower, that buried them. Of which foure, MILES FOREST, and the Priest were dead, and there remained aliue onely Sir IAMES TIRREL, and IOHN DIGHTON. These two the King caused to bee committed to the Tower, and examined touching the manner of the death of the two innocent Princes. They agreed both in a Tale, (as the King gaue out) to this effect: That King RICHARD hauing directed his warrant for the putting of them to death to BRACKENBVRIE the Lieutenant of the Tower, was by him refused. Whereupon the King directed his Warrant to Sir IAMES TIRREL, to receiue the keyes of the Tower from the Lieutenant (for the space of a night) for the Kings speciall seruice. That Sir IAMES TIRREL accordingly repaired to the Tower by night, attended by his two Seruants afore-named, whom hee had chosen for that purpose. That himselfe stood at the staire-foot, and sent these two Villaines to execute the murther. That they smothered them in their bed; &amp; that done, called vp their Master to see their naked dead bodies, which they had laid forth. That they were buried vnder the Staires, and some stones cast vpon them. That when the report was made to King RICHARD, that his will was done, hee gaue Sir IAMES TIRREL great thankes; but tooke exception to the place of their buriall, being too base for them that were Kings children. Whereupon another night by the Kings warrant renued, their bodies were remoued by the Priest of the Tower, and buried by him in some place, which (by meanes of the Priests death soone after) could not be knowne. Thus much was then deliuered abroad, to be the effect of those Examinations. But the King neuerthelesse made no vse of them in any of his Declarations; whereby (as

it seemes) those Examinations left the businesse somewhat perplexed. And a for Sir IAMES TIRREL, hee was soone after beheaded in the Tower-yard, for other matters of Treason. But IOHN DIGHTON (who it seemeth spake best for the King) was forthwith set at libertie, and was the principall meanes of diuulging this Tradition. Therefore this kind of Proofe being left so naked, the King vsed the more diligence in the latter, for the tracing of PERKIN. To this purpose, hee sent abroad into seuerall parts, and especially into Flanders, diuers secret and nimble Scouts and Spies; some faining themselues to flie ouer vnto PERKIN, and to adhere vnto him; and some vnder other pretences, to learne, search, and discouer all the circumstances and particulars of PERKINS Parents, Birth, Person, Trauailes vp and downe; and in briefe, to haue a Iournall (as it were) of his life and doings. Hee furnished these his imployed-men liberally with Money, to draw on and reward Intelligences: giuing them also in charge, to aduertise continually what they found, and neuerthelesse still to goe on. And euer as one Aduertisement and Discouerie called vp another, hee employed other new Men, where the Businesse did require it. Others hee employed in a more speciall nature and trust, to be his Pioners in the maine Counter-mine. These were directed to insinuate themselues into the familiaritie and confidence of the principall Persons of the Partie in Flanders, and so to learne what Associates they had, and Correspondents, either heere in England, or abroad; and how farre euery one ingaged, and what new ones they meant afterwards to trie, or board. And as this for the Persons; so for the Actions themselues, to discouer to the Bottome (as they could) the vtmost of PERKINS and the Conspiratours their Intentions, Hopes, and Practices. These latter Best-be-trust-Spies
               
had some of them further instructions, to practise and draw off the best Friends and Seruants of PERKIN, by making remonstrance to them, how weakly his Enterprize and Hopes were built, and with how prudent and potent a King they had to deale; and to reconcile them to the King, with promise of Pardon, and good Conditions of Reward. And (aboue the rest) to assayle, sappe, and worke into the constancie of Sir ROBERT CLIFFORD; and to winne him (if they could) being the man that knew most of their secrets, and who being wonne away, would most appall and discourage the rest, and in a manner breake the Knot.
            
            There is a strange Tradition; That the King being lost in a Wood of Suspicions, and not knowing whom to trust, had both intelligence with the Confessors and Chaplaines of diuers great men, and for the better Credit of his Espialls abroad with the contrarie side, did vse to haue them cursed at PAVLS (by Name) amongst the Bead-roll of the Kings Enemies, according to the Custome of those Times. These Espials plyed their Charge so roundly, as the King had an Anatomie of PERKIN aliue; and waslikewise well informed of the particular correspondent Conspiratours in England, and many other Mysteries were reuealed; and Sir ROBERT CLIFFORD in especiall wonne to bee assured to the King, and industrious and officious for his seruice. The King therfore (receiuing a rich Returne of his diligence, and great satisfaction touching a number of Particulars) first diuulged and spred abroad the Imposture and iuggling of PERKINS Person and Trauailes, with the Circumstances therof, throughout the Realme. Not by Proclamation (because things were yet in Examination, and so might receiue the more or the lesse) but by Court-fames, which commonly print better than printed Proclamations. Then thought hee it also time to send an Ambassage vnto

Archduke PHILIP, into Flanders, for the abandoning and dismissing of PERKIN. Heerein hee employed Sir EDWARD POYNINGS, and Sir WILLIAM WARHAM, Doctor of the Canon Law. The Archduke was then young, and gouerned by his Councell: before whom the Ambassadours had audience, and Doctor WARHAM spake in this manner.
            
            MY Lords, the King our Master is very sorie, that England and your Countrey here of Flanders hauing beene counted as Man and Wife for so long time, now this Countrey of all others should be the Stage, where a base Counterfeit should play the part of a King of England; not onely to his Graces disquiet and dishonour, but to the scorne and reproach of all Soueraigne Princes. To counterfeit the dead Image of a King in his Coyne, is an high Offence by all Lawes: But to counterfeit the liuing Image of a King in his Person, exceedeth all Falsifications, except it should bee that of a MAHOMET, or an Anti-Christ, that counterfeit Diuine Honour. The King hath too great an Opinion of this sage Counsell, to thinke that any of you is caught with this Fable (though way may be giuen by you to the passion of some) the thing in it selfe is so improbable. To set Testimonies aside of the Death of Duke RICHARD, which the King hath vpon Record,

plaine and infallible (because they may bee thought to bee in the Kings owne Power) let the thing testifie for it selfe. Sense and Reason no Power can command. Is it possible (trow you) that King RICHARD should damne his soule, and foule his Name with so abominable a Murther, and yet not mend his Case? Or doe you thinke, that Men of Bloud (that were his Instruments) did turne to Pitty in the middest of their Execution? Whereas in cruell and sauage Beasts, and Men also, the first Draught of Bloud doth yet make them more fierce, and enraged. Doe you not know, that the Bloudie Executioners of Tyrants doe goe to such Errands, with an Halter about their necke: So that if they performe not, they are sure to die for it? And doe you thinke, that these men would hazard their owne liues, for sparing anothers? Admit they should haue saued him: What should they haue done with him? Turne him into London Streets, that the Watch-men or any Passenger that should light vpon him, might carry him before a Iustice, and so all come to light? Or should they haue kept him by them secretly? That surely would haue required a great deale of Care, Charge, and continuall Feares. But (my Lords) I labour too much in a cleare

Businesse. The King is so wise, and hath so good Friends abroad, as now hee knoweth Duke PERKIN from his Cradle. And because hee is a great Prince, if you haue any good Poet here, hee can helpe him with Notes to write his Life; and to parallel him with LAMBERT SIMNELL, now the Kings Faulconer. And therefore (to speake plainely to your Lordships) it is the strangest thing in the World, that the Lady MARGARET (excuse vs, if wee name her, whose Malice to the King is both causelesse and endlesse) should now when she is old, at the time when other Women giue ouer Childbearing, bring forth two such Monsters; being not the Births of nine or tenne Moneths, but of many yeares. And whereas other naturall Mothers bring forth Children weake, and not able to helpe themselues; she bringeth forth tall Striplings, able soone after their comming into the World, to bid Battaile to mightie Kings. My Lords, wee stay vnwillingly vpon this Part. Wee would to GOD, that Lady would once taste the Joyes, which GOD Almightie doth serue up vnto her, in beholding her Neece to Reigne in such Honour, and with so much Royall Issue, which shee might bee pleased

to accompt as her owne. The Kings Request vnto the Archduke, and your Lordships, might bee; That according to the Example of King CHARLES, who hath already discarded him, you would banish this vnworthy Fellow out of your Dominions. But because the King may iustly expect more from an ancient Confederate, than from a new reconciled Enemie; hee maketh his Request vnto you, to deliuer him vp into his hands. Pirates and Impostures of this sort, beeing fit to bee accounted the Common Enemies of Mankinde, and no wayes to bee protected by the Law of Nations.
            
            
               After some time of Deliberation, the Ambassadours receiued this short Answer.
            
            THat the Archduke, for the loue of King HENRY, would in no sort aide or assist the pretended Duke, but in all things conserue the Amitie hee had with the King. But for the Duchesse Dowager, shee was absolute in the Lands of her Dowrie, and that hee could not let her to dispose of her owne.
            
               
THe King, vpon the returne of the Ambassadours, was nothing satisfied with this Answer. For well he knew, that a Patrimoniall Dowrie carried no part of Soueraignty, or Command of Forces. Besides, the Ambassadors told him plainly, that they saw the Duchesse had a great Party in the Arch-Dukes Counsell; &amp; that howsoeuer it was carried in a course of conniuence, yet the Arch-Duke vnder hand gaue aid and furtherance to PERKIN. Wherefore (partly out of Courage, and partly out of Policie) the King forthwith banished all Flemmings (as wel their Persons, as their Wares) out of his Kingdom; Commanding his Subiects likewise (and by name his Merchants-Aduenturers) which had a Resiance in Antwerpe, to return; translating the Mart (which commonly followed the English Cloth) vnto Calice, &amp; embarred also all further trade for the future. This the King did, being sensible in point of honour, not to suffer a Pretender to the Crowne of England, to affront him so neare at hand, and he to keep termes of friendship with the Countrie where he did set vp. But he had also a further reach: for that hee knew well, that the Subiects of Flanders drew so great commoditie from the trade of England, as by this Embargo they would soon waxe weary of PERKIN, and that the Tumults of Flanders had bin so late &amp; fresh, as it was no time for the Prince to displease the People. Neuerthelesse for formes sake, by way of requitall, the Arch-Duke did likewise banish the English out of Flanders; which in effect was done to his hand.
            The King being well aduertised, that PERKIN did more trust vpon Friends and Partakers within the Realme, than vpon forraine Armes, thought it behooued him to apply the Remedy, where the Disease lay; &amp; to proceed with seueritie against some of

the principall Conspirators here within the Realme; Thereby to purge the ill Humours in England, &amp; to coole the Hopes in Flanders. Wherefore hee caused to bee apprehended (almost at an instant) IOHN RATCLIFFE Lord Fitz-water, Sir SIMON MOVNTFORD, Sir THOMAS THWAITES, WILLIAM DAWBIGNEY, ROBERT RATCLIFFE, THOMAS CHRESSENOR, &amp; THOMAS ASTWOOD. All these were arraigned, conuicted and condemned for High-Treason, in adhering, and promising aide to PERKIN. Of these, the Lord FITZWATER was conueighed to Calice, and there kept in hold, and in hope of life, vntill soone after (eyther impatient, or betrayed) he dealt with his Keeper to haue escaped, &amp; thereupon was beheaded. But Sir SIMON MOVNTFORD, ROBERT RATCLIFFE, and WILLIAM DAWBIGNEY were beheaded immediately after their Condemnation. The rest were pardoned, together with many others Clerkes and Laikes, amongst which were two Dominican Friars, and WILLIAM WORSELEY, Deane of Paules: which latter sort passed Examination, but came not to publike triall.
            The Lord Chamberlaine at that time was not touched; whether it were, that the King would not stir too many humours at once, but (after the maner of good Physitians) purge the head last; or that CLIFFORD (from whom most of these Discoueries came) reserued that Piece for his own cōming ouer: signifying only to the King in the meane time, that he doubted there were some greater ones in the businesse, whereof he would giue the King further accompt, when he came to his presence.
            Vpon Al-hallowes-day-euen being now the tenth yeare of the Kings Reigne, the Kings second Sonne

HENRY was created Duke of Yorke; &amp; as well the Duke, as diuers others, Noblemen, Knights-Batchlours, &amp; Gentlemen of Quality were made knights of the Bath, according to the Ceremony. Vpon the morrow after Twelfth-Day, the King remoued from Westminster (where he had kept his Christmas) to the Tower of London. This he did as soon as he had aduertisement, that Sir ROBERT CLIFFORD (in whose Bosom or Budget most of PERKINS secrets were layed vp) was come into England. And the place of the Tower was chosen to that end, that if CLIFFORD should accuse any of the Great-ones, they might without suspition, or noise, or sending abroad of Warrants, be presently attached; the Court &amp; Prison being within the cincture of one Wal. After a day or two, the king drew vnto him a selected Councel, &amp; admitted CLIFFORD to his presence; who first fell downe at his feet, and in all humble manner craued the Kings Pardon, which the King then granted, though hee were indeed secretly assured of his life before. Then commanded to tell his knowledge, he did amongst many others (of himself, not interrogated) appeach Sir WILLIAM STANLEY, the Lord Chamberlaine of the Kings Houshold.
            The King seemed to be much amazed at the naming of this Lord, as if he had heard the Newes of some strange and fearfull Prodigie. To heare a Man that had done him seruice of so high a nature, as to saue his life, &amp; set the Crown vpon his head; a Man, that enioied by his fauor &amp; aduancement so great a fortune, both in Honour &amp; Riches; a Man, that was tied vnto him in so near a Band of alliance, his Brother hauing married the Kings Mother; and lastly, a Man, to whom he had cōmitted the trust of his Person, in making him his Chamberlain. That this Man, no waies disgraced, no waies discontent, no waies

put in feare, should be false vnto him. CLIFFORD was required to say ouer again, &amp; againe, the Particulars of his accusatiō; being warned, that in a matter so vnlikely, &amp; that concerned so great a Seruant of the Kings, he should not in any wise go too far. But the king finding that he did sadly, &amp; constantly (without hesitation or varying, &amp; with those ciuill Protestations that were fit) stand to that that he had said, offering to iustifie it vpon his soule and life; he caused him to be remoued. And after he had not a litle bemoaned himself vnto his Councel there present, gaue order that Sir WILLIAM STANLEY should be restrained in his own Chamber, where he lay before, in the Square Tower. And the next day he was examined by the Lords. Vpō his Examination, he denied little of that wherewith he was charged, nor endeauoured much to excuse or extenuate his fault. So that (not very wisely) thinking to make his Offence lesse by Confession, hee made it enough for Condemnation. It was conceiued, that he trusted much to his former merits, and the interest that his brother had in the king. But those helpes were ouer weighed by diuers things that made against him, &amp; were predominant in the Kings nature and minde. First, an Ouer-merit; for conuenient Merit, vnto wch reward may easily reach, doth best with kings: next the sense of his Power; for the King thought, that he that could set him vp, was the more dāgerous to pul him down. Thirdly, the glimmering of a Confiscation; for he was the richest subiect for value in the kingdome; There being found in his Castle of Holt forty thousand Marks in ready mony, and plate, besides Iewels, Houshold-stuffe, Stockes vpon his grounds, &amp; other Personall Estate, exceeding great. And for his Reuenue in Land and Fee, it was three thousand pounds a yeere of old Rent, a great matter in those

times. Lastly, the Nature of the Time; for if the King had been out of feare of his own Estate, it was not vnlike he would haue spared his life. But the Cloud of so great a Rebellion hanging ouer his head, made him worke sure. Wherefore after some six weekes distance of time, which the King did honorably interpose, both to giue space to his Brothers Intercession, &amp; to shew to the World, that he had a conflict with himself what he should do; he was arraigned of High-Treason, and condemned, and presently after beheaded.
            Yet is it to this day left but in dark memorie both what the Case of this Noble Person was, for wch he suffred; and what likewise was the ground &amp; cause of his defection, &amp; the alienation of his heart from the King. His Case was said to be this: That in discourse between Sir ROBERT CLIFFORD and him, he had said; That if he were sure, that that young man were King EDWARDS Sonne, hee would neuer beare Armes against him. This Case seemes somwhat an hard Case, both in respect of the Conditionall, and in respect of the other words. But for the Conditional, it seemes the Iudges of that time (who were learned men, &amp; the three chief of them of the Priuy Councel) thought it was a dangerous thing to admit Ifs and Ands, to qualifie words of Treason; wherby euery man might expresse his malice, and blanch his danger. And it was like to the Case (in the following times) of ELIZABETH BARTON, the Holy-maid of Kent: who had said, That if king HENRY the eighth did not take KATHERINE his Wife againe, he should be depriued of his Crown, and dye the death of a Dogge. And infinite Cases may be put of like nature. Which (it seemeth) the graue Iudges taking into Consideration, would not admit of treasons vpō 
               condition. And as for the Positiue words, That he would not bear arms
               
               against King EDWARDS Son; though the words seeme calme, yet it was a plain &amp; direct Ouer-ruling of the Kings Title, either by the Line of LANCASTER, or by Act of Parliament. Which (no doubt) pierced the King more, than if STANLEY had charged his Lance vpon him in the fielde. For if STANLEY would hold that opinion, that a son of King EDWARD had still the better right, he being so principall a Person of authoritie, and fauor about the King; it was to teach all England, to say as much. And therfore (as those times were) that speech touched the Quicke. But some Writers doe put this out of doubt; for they say, That STANLEY did expresly promise to aide PERKIN, &amp; sent him some helpe of Treasure.
            Now for the Motiue of his falling off from the King; It is true, that at Bosworth Field the King was beset, and in a manner inclosed round about by the Troupes of King RICHARD, &amp; in manifest danger of his life; when this STANLEY was sent by his brother, with three thousand men to his Rescue, which he performed so, that king RICHARD was slaine vpon the Place. So as the condition of Mortal men is not capable of a greater benefit, than the king receiued by the hands of STANLEY; being like the benefit of CHRIST, at once to Saue, and Crowne. For which seruice the King gaue him great gifts, made him his Counsellor, &amp; Chamberlain; and (somwhat cōtrary to his nature) had winked at the great spoiles of Bosworth Field, wch came almost wholly to this mans hands, to his infinite enriching. Yet neuerthelesse blown vp with the conceit of his Merit, he did not think he had receiued good Measure frō the King, at least not Pressing-downe, and runningouer, as he expected. And his ambition was so exorbitant, and vnbounded, as he became Sutour to

the King for the Earledome of Chester. Which euer beeing a kinde of Appennage to the Principalitie of Wales, and vsing to goe to the Kings Sonne; his suit did not only end in a Deniall, but in a Distaste. The King perceiuing thereby, that his Desires were intemperate, and his Cogitations vaste, and irregular, and that his former Benefits were but cheape, and lightly regarded by him. Wherefore the King began not to brook him wel. And as a litle Leauen of new Distaste doth commonly sowre the whole Lumpe of former Merits, the Kings Wit began now to suggest vnto his Passion, that STANLEY, at Bosworth Field, though he came time enough to saue his life, yet hee stayed long enough to endanger it. But yet hauing no matter against him, he continued him in his Places, vntill this his Fall.
            
            After him was made Lord Chamberlaine, GILES Lord Dawbeny, a man of great sufficiencie and valour; the more, because he was gentle and moderate.
            There was a common Opinion, That Sir ROBERT CLIFFORD (who now was become the State-Informer) was from the beginning an Emissary, and Spie of the Kings; and that hee fled ouer into Flanders with his consent and priuitie. But this is not probable; both because hee neuer recouered that Degree of Grace, which he had with the king before his going ouer; and chiefly, for that the Discouerie which hee had made touching the Lord Chamberlaine (which was his great Seruice) grew not from any thing he learn'd abroade, for that hee knew it well before he went.
            These Executions (and especially that of the Lord Chamberlaines, which was the chiefe strength of the Partie, and by meanes of Sir ROBERT CLIFFORD, who was the most inward man of Trust amongst

them) did extremely quaile the Designe of PERKIN, and his complices, as well through Discouragement, as Distrust. So that they were now (like Sand without Lyme) ill bound together; especially as many as were English: who were at a gaze, looking strange one vpon another, not knowing who was faithfull to their Side; but thinking, that the King (what with his Baits, and what with his Nets) would draw them all vnto him, that were anything worth. And indeede it came to passe, that diuers came away by the Thred, sometimes one, and sometimes another. BARLEY (that was Ioint-Commissioner with CLIFFORD) did hold out one of the longest, till PERKIN was farre worne; yet made his Peace at the length. But, the Fall of this Greatman, beeing in so high Authoritie and Fauour (as was thought) with the King; and the manner of Carriage of the Businesse, as if there had beene secret Inquisition vpon him, for a great time before; and the Cause for which hee suffered, which was little more, than for saying in effect, That the Title of YORKE was better than the Title of LANCASTER; which was the Case almost of euery man (at the least in Opinion;) was matter of great Terrour amongst all the Kings Seruants and Subiects: Insomuch, as no man almost thought himselfe secure; and men durst scarce commune or talke one with another: but there was a generall Diffidence euery where. Which neuerthelesse made the King rather more Absolute, than more Safe. For, Bleeding Inwards and shut Vapours strangle soonest, and oppresse most.
            
            Hereupon presently came forth Swarmes and Volies of Libels (which are the Gusts of Libertie of Speech restrayned, and the Females of Sedition) contayning bitter Inuectiues, and Slanders against the King, and some of the Councell. For the contriuing and dispersing whereof (after great Diligence of Inquirie)

fiue meane Persons were caught, and executed.
            Meane while, the King did not neglect Ireland; being the Soyle where the Mushromes and Upstart-Weedes (that spring vp in a Night) did chiefly prosper. Hee sent therefore from hence (for the better settling of his affaires there) Commissioners of both Robes: The Prior of Lanthony, to bee his Chancellour in that Kingdome; and Sir EDWARD POYNINGS, with a Power of Men, and a Marshall Commission, together with a Ciuill Power of his Lieutenant, with a Clause, That the Earle of Kildare, then Deputie, should obey him. But, the Wilde-Irish (who were the principall Offenders) fledde into the Woods and Bogges, after their manner: and those, that knew themselues guilty, in the Pale, fledde to them. So that Sir EDWARD POYNINGS was enforced to make a Wilde-Chase vpon the Wilde-Irish: Where (in respect of the Mountaines and Fastnesses) hee did little good. Which (eyther out of a suspicious Melancholy vpon his bad Successe, or the better to saue his seruice from Disgrace) hee would needes impute vnto the Comfort, that the Rebels should receiue vnder-hand from the Earle of Kildare; euery light suspicion growing vpon the Earle, in respect of the KILDARE that was in the Action of LAMBERT SIMNELL, and slaine at Stoke-field. Wherefore hee caused the Earle to bee apprehended, and sent into England; where, vpon Examination, hee cleared himselfe so well, as he was re-placed in his Gouernment. But, POYNINGS (the better to make compensation of the Meagernesse of his Seruice in the Warres, by Acts of Peace) called a Parliament; where was made that memorable Act, which at this day is called POYNINGS Law, whereby all the Statutes of England were made to bee of force in Ireland. For, before they were not: neither

are any now in force in Ireland, which were made in England since that time; which was the tenth yeare of the King.
            About this time, beganne to be discouered in the King that Disposition, which, afterward nourished and whet-on by bad Counsellers and Ministers, proued the Blot of his times; which was, the course he tooke, to crush Treasure out of his Subiects Purses, by forfeitures vpon Penall-Lawes. At this, men did startle the more at this time, because it appeared plainely to bee in the King's Nature, and not out of his Necessitie, hee beeing now in Float for Treasure; For that he had newly receiued the Peace-money from France, the Beneuolence-money from his Subiects, and great Casualties vpon the Confiscations of the Lord Chamberlaine, and diuers others. The first-noted Case of this kinde, was that of Sir WILLIAM CAPEL, Alderman of London: Who, vpon sundry Penall-Lawes, was condemned in the summe of seuen and twenty hundred pounds, and compounded with the King for sixteene hundred: And yet after, EMPSON would haue cut another Chop out of him, if the King had not dyed in the Instant.
            The Summer following, the King, to comfort his Mother (whom he did alwaies tenderly loue and reuere) and to make Demonstration to the World, that the proceedings against Sir WILLIAM STANLEY (which was imposed vpon him by necessitie of State) had not in any degree diminished the affection he bare to THOMAS, his brother; went in Progresse to Latham, to make merry with his Mother, and the Earle, and lay there diuers dayes.
            During this Progresse, PERKIN WARBECKE finding, that time and Temporizing, which (whilest his practices were couert and wrought well in England) made for him; did now, when they were discouered

and defeated, rather make against him (for that when matters once goe downe the Hill, they stay not without a new force) resolued to trie his aduenture in some exploit vpon England; hoping still vpon the affections of the Common-People towards the House of YORKE. Which Body of Common-People hee thought was not to bee practised vpon, as Persons of Qualitie are; But, that the only practice vpon their affections, was, To set vp a Standard in the fielde. The Place where hee should make his Attempt, hee chose to be the Coast of Kent.
            
            The King by this time was growne to sueh an height of Reputation for cunning and Policie, that euery Accident and Euent, that went well, was laid and imputed to his foresight, as if hee had set it before: As, in this Particular of PERKINS Designe vpon Kent. For, the world would not beleeue afterwards, but the King, hauing secret Intelligence of PERKINS intention for Kent (the better to draw it on) went of purpose into the North, a farre off, laying an open side vnto PERKIN, to make him come to the Close, and so to trip vp his heeles, hauing made sure in Kent before hand.
            But so it was, that PERKIN had gathered together a Power of all Nations, neither in number, nor in the hardinesse and courage of the Persons, contemptible; but, in their nature and fortunes, to bee feared as well of Friends as Enemies; being Bankrupts, and many of them Felons, and such as liued by Rapine. These hee put to Sea, and arriued vpon the Coast of Sandwich and Deale in Kent, about Iuly.
            
            There he cast Anchor; and to prooue the affections of the People, sent some of his men to land, making great boast of the Power that was to follow. The Kentish-men (perceiuing that PERKIN was not followed by any English of name or accompt, and that his

forces consisted but of strangers borne, and most of them base People, and Free-booters, fitter to spoile a Coast, than to recouer a Kingdome) resorting vnto the principall Gentlemen of the Countrie, professed their loyaltie to the King, and desired to bee directed and commanded for the best of the Kings seruice. The Gentlemen, entring into Consultation, directed some forces in good number, to shew themselues vpon the Coast; and some of them to make signes, to entice PERKINS Souldiers to land, as if they would ioyne with them: and some others to appeare from some other Places, and to make semblance as if they fledde from them; the better to encourage them to land. But, PERKIN (who, by playing the Prince, or else taught by Secretarie FRION, had learned thus much, That People vnder Command, doe vse to consult, and after to march in order; and Rebells contrariwise runne vpon an Head together in confusion) considering the delay of time, and obseruing their orderly, and not tumultuary Arming, doubted the worst. And therefore the wily Youth would not set one foote out of his Ship, till hee might see things were sure. Wherefore the Kings Forces, perceiuing that they could draw on no more than those that were formerly landed, set vpon them, and cut them in pieces, ere they could fly backe to their ships. In which Skirmish (besides those that fledde, and were slaine) there were taken about an hundred and fifty persons. Which, for that the King thought, that to punish a few for example was Gentlemans-play, but for Rascall-People, they were to bee cut off euery man, especially in the beginning of an Enterprize; and likewise for that hee saw, that PERKINS Forces would now consist chiefly of such Rabble and scumme of desperate People; hee therefore hanged them all, for the greater terrour. They were brought to London, all rayl'd in

Ropes, like a Teame of Horses in a Cart; and were executed some of them at London, and Wapping, and the rest at diuers places vpon the Sea-Coast of Kent, Sussex, and Norfolke, for Sea-markes or Light-houses, to teach PERKINS People to auoyd the Coast. The King, being aduertised of the landing of the Rebels, thought to leaue his Progresse: But, being certified the next day, that they were partly defeated, and partly fled, hee continued his Progresse, and sent Sir RICHARD GVILFORD into Kent in message. Who, calling the Countrie together, did much commend (from the King) their fidelitie, manhood, and well handling of that seruice; and gaue them all thankes, and (in priuate) promised Reward to some particulars.
            Vpon the sixteenth of Nouember (this beeing the eleuenth yeare of the King) was holden the Serieants-Feast, at Elie-Place; there being nine Serieants of that Call. The King, to honour the Feast, was present with his Queene at the Dinner; being a Prince, that was euer ready to grace and countenance the Professors of the Law; hauing a little of that, That as he gouerned his Subiects by his Lawes, so he gouerned his Lawes by his Lawyers.
            This yeare also the King entred into League with the Italian Potentates, for the defence of Italie, against France. For, King CHARLES had conquered the Realme of Naples, and lost it againe, in a kinde of Felicitie of a Dreame. Hee passed the whole length of Italie without resistance: so that it was true which Pope ALEXANDER was wont to say; That the Frenchmen came into Italie, with Chalke in their hands, to marke up their lodgings, rather than with swords to fight. Hee likewise entred and wonne, in effect, the whole Kingdome of Naples it selfe, without striking stroke. But, presently thereupon, he did commit and multiply so many Errours, as was too great a taske for the best

fortune to ouercome. Hee gaue no contentment to the Barons of Naples, of the Faction of the Angeouines; but, scattered his rewards according to the mercenarie appetites of some about him. He put all Italie vpon their Guard, by the seizing and holding of Ostia, and the protecting of the Libertie of Pisa: which made all men suspect that his purposes looked further, than his title of Naples. He fell too soone at difference with LVDOVICO SFORTIA; who was the Man that carried the Keyes which brought him in, and shut him out. Hee neglected to extinguish some reliques of the Warre. And lastly, in regard of his easie passage through Italie without resistance, hee entred into an ouermuch despising of the Armes of the Italians: Whereby he left the Realme of Naples, at his departure, so much the lesse prouided. So that not long after his returne, the whole Kingdome reuolted to FERDINANDO the younger, and the French were quite driuen out. Neuerthelesse, CHARLES did make both great threats, and great preparations, to re-enter Italie once againe. Wherfore, at the instance of diuers of the States of Italie (and especially of Pope ALEXANDER) there was a League concluded, betweene the said Pope, MAXIMILIAN King of Romanes, HENRY King of England, FERDINANDO and ISABELLA, King and Queen of Spaine (for so they are constantly placed in the originall Treaty throughout,) AVGVSTISSIMO BARBADICO, Duke of Venice, and LVDOVICO SFORTIA, Duke of Millan, for the common defence of their estates. Wherein though FERDINANDO of Naples was not named as principall; yet, no doubt, the Kingdome of Naples was tacitly included, as a Fee of the Church.
            There dyed also this yeare CECILE, Duchesse of Yorke, mother to King EDWARD the Fourth, at her Castle of Barkhamsted, beeing of extreame yeares;

and who had liued to see three Princes of her bodie crowned, and foure murthered. Shee was buried at Foderingham, by her husband.
            This yeare also the King called his Parliament: where many Lawes were made, of a more priuate and vulgar nature, than ought to detaine the Reader of an Historie. And it may bee iustly suspected, by the proceedings following, that as the King did excell in good Common-wealth Lawes; so neuerthelesse hee had, in secret, a designe to make vse of them, as well for collecting of Treasure, as for correcting of Manners; and so, meaning thereby to harrow his People, did accumulate them the rather.
            The principall Law, that was made this Parliament, was a Law of a strange nature: rather Iust, than Legall; and more magnanimous than prouident. This Law did ordaine, That no person, that did assist in Armes, or otherwise, the King for the time beeing, should after bee impeached therefore, or attainted, either by the course of the Law, or by Act of Parliament: But, if any such Act of Attainder did happen to bee made, it should bee voyde, and of none effect; For that it was agreeable to reason of Estate, that the Subiect should not enquire of the iustnesse of the Kings Title, or Quarrell; and it was agreeable to good Conscience, that (whatsoeuer the fortune of the Warre were) the Subiect should not suffer for his Obedience. The spirit of this Law was wonderfull Pious and Noble: beeing like in matter of Warre, vnto the spirit of DAVID in matter of Plague, who said, If I haue sinned, strike mee; but what haue these sheepe done? Neither wanted this Law parts of prudent and deepe fore-sight. For, it did the better take away occasion, for the people to busie themselues, to prie into the Kings Title; for that howsoeuer it fell, their safety was alreadie prouided for. Besides, it could not but greatly draw

vnto him, the loue and hearts of the people, because hee seemed more carefull for them, than for himselfe. But yet neuerthelesse, it did take off from his Partie, that great Tie and Spurre of necessity, to fight and goe Victors out of the fielde; considering their liues and fortunes were put in safety, and protected, whether they stood to it or ranne away. But the force and obligation of this Law was in it selfe Illusorie, as to the latter part of it; by a precedent Act of Parliament, to binde or frustrate a future. For a supreme and absolute Power cannot conclude it selfe, neither can that which is in nature reuocable bee made fixed; no more than if a man should appoint or declare by his Will, that if hee made any Latter will, it should bee voyde. And for the Case of the Act of Parliament, there is a notable President of it in King HENRIE the Eight's time. Who doubting hee might dye in the minoritie of his Sonne, procured an Act to passe, That no Statute made during the minoritie of the King, should binde him or his Successours, except it were confirmed by the King vnder his great Seale, at his full age. But the first Act that passed in King EDWARD the Sixth his time, was an Act of Repeale of that former Act; at which time neuerthelesse the King was Minor. But things that doe not binde, may satisfie for the time.
            There was also made a shoaring or vnderpropping Act for the Beneuolence; to make the summes which any person had agreed to pay, and neuerthelesse were not brought in, to bee leuiable by course of Law. Which Act did not only bring in the Areres, but did indeed countenance the whole businesse, and was pretended to bee made at the desire of those, that had beene forward to pay.
            This Parliament also was made that good Law, which gaue the Attaint vpon a false Uerdict betweene Partie and Partie, which before was a kinde of Euangile,
               
irremediable. It extends not to causes Capitall, as well because they are for the most part at the Kings Suite; as because in them (if they bee followed in Course of Indictment) there passeth a double Iurie, the Indictors, and the Triers; and so not Twelue Men, but Foure and twentie. But it seemeth that was not the onely reason; for this reason holdeth not in the Appeale. But the great reason was, lest it should tend to the discouragement of Iurors in Cases of Life and Death; if they should bee subiect to Suite and Penaltie, where the fauour of Life maketh against them. It extendeth not also to any Suite, where the Demand is vnder the value of fortie pounds; for that in such Cases of pettie value, it would not quite the Charge, to goe about againe.
            There was another Law made against a branch of Ingratitude in Women, who hauing beene aduanced by their Husbands, or their Husbands Ancestors, should alien, and thereby seeke to defeate the Heires, or those in Remainder, of the Lands, whereunto they had bin so aduanced. The remedie was, by giuing power to the next, to enter for a forfeiture.
            There was also enacted that Charitable Law, for the admission of poore Suiters In Forma Pauperis, without Fee to Counsellor, Atturney, or Clerke, whereby poore men became rather able to vexe, than vnable to sue. There were diuers other good Lawes made that Parliament, as we said before: but we still obserue our manner, in selecting out those, that are not of a Vulgar nature.
            The King this while, though hee sate in Parliament, as in full Peace, and seemed to account of the designes of PERKIN (who was now returned into Flanders) but as a May game; yet hauing the composition of a wise King (Stout without, and apprehensiue within) had giuen order for the watching of Beacons vpon the

Coasts, and erecting more where they stood too thin, and had a carefull eye where this wandering Cloude would breake. But PERKIN aduised to keepe his fire (which hitherto burned as it were vpon greene Wood) aliue, with continuall blowing; Sailed againe into Ireland, whence he had formerly departed, rather vpon the hopes of France, than vpon any vnreadinesse or discouragement hee found in that People. But in the space of time betweene the Kings Diligence and POYNINGS Commission, had so settled things there, as there was nothing left for PERKIN, but the blustring affection of wilde and naked people. Wherefore hee was aduised by his Councell, to seeke aide of the King of Scotland; a Prince yong, and valourous, and in good termes with his Nobles and People, and ill affected to King HENRY. At this time also both MAXIMILIAN and CHARLES of France began to beare no good will to the King. The one beeing displeased with the Kings Prohibition of Commerce with Flanders: The Other holding the King for suspect, in regard of his late entrie into league with the Italians. Wherefore besides the open Aides of the Duchesse of Burgundy, which did with Sayles and Oares put on and aduance PERKINS designes, there wanted not some secret Tides from MAXIMILIAN and CHARLES, which did further his fortunes. In so much as they, both by their secret Letters, and Messages, recommended him to the King of Scotland.
            
            PERKIN therefore comming into Scotland vpon those hopes, with a well appointed company, was by the King of Scots (beeing formerly well prepared) honourably welcommed, and soone after his arriuall admitted to his Presence, in a solemne manner. For the King receiued him in State in his Chamber of Presence, accompanied with diuers of his Nobles. And PERKIN well attended, as well with those that the King

had sent before him, as with his owne Traine, entered the roome where the King was, and comming neare to the King, and bowing a little to embrace him, hee retired some paces backe, and with a loud voyce (that all that were present might heare him) made his Decla
               ration in this manner.
            HIgh and Mighty King, your Grace, and these your Nobles here present, may be pleased benignely to bow your Eares, to heare the Tragedie of a young Man, that by Right ought to hold in his hand the Ball of a Kingdome; but by Fortune is made Himselfe a Ball, tossed from Miserie to Miserie, and from Place to Place. You see here before you the Spectacle of a PLANTAGENET, who hath beene carried from the Nurserie to the Sanctuarie; from the Sanctuarie, to the direfull Prison; from the Prison, to the Hand of the cruell Tormentor; and from that Hand, to the wide Wildernesse (as I may truely call it) for so the World hath beene to mee. So that hee that is borne to a great Kingdome, hath not Ground to set his foote vpon, more than this where hee now standeth, by your Princely Fauour. EDWARD the Fourth, late King of England, (as your Grace cannot but haue heard) left two Sonnes; EDWARD, and RICHARD, Duke of Yorke, both very

young. EDWARD, the eldest succeeded their Father in the Crowne, by the name of King EDWARD the Fift. But RICHARD, Duke of Glocester, their vnnaturall Vnckle, first thirsting after the Kingdome, through Ambition, and afterwards thirsting for their Bloud, out of desire to secure himselfe; imployed an Instrument of his (confident to him, as hee thought) to murther them both. But this Man that was imployed, to execute that execrable Tragedie, hauing cruelly slaine King EDWARD, the eldest of the two, was mooued partly hy Remorse, and partly by some other meane, to saue RICHARD his Brother; making a Report neuerthelesse to the Tyrant, that hee had performed his Commandement for both Brethren. This Report was accordingly beleeued, and published generally. So that the World hath beene possessed of an Opinion, that they both were barbarously made away, though euer Truth hath some sparkes that flye abroade, vntill it appeare in due time, as this hath had. But Almighty GOD, that stopped the Mouth of the Lion, and saued little JOAS from the Tyrannie of ATHALIAH, when shee massacred the Kings Children; and did saue ISAACK, when the hand was stretched forth to sacrifice him; preserued the

second Brother. For I my selfe, that stand heere in your presence, am that very RICHARD, Duke of Yorke, Brother of that infortunate Prince, King EDWARD the Fift, now the most rightfull suruiuing Heire-Male to that Uictorious and most Noble EDWARD, of that Name the Fourth, late King of England. For the manner of my Escape, it is fit it should passe in silence, or (at least) in a more secret Relation: for that it may concerne some aliue, and the memorie of some that are dead. Let it suffice to thinke, I had then a Mother liuing, a Queene, and one that expected dayly such a Commandement from the Tyrant, for the murthering of her Children. Thus in my tender age escaping by GODS Mercie out of London, I was secretly conueyed ouer Sea. Where, after a time, the Partie that had mee in Charge, (vpon what new Feares, change of Minde, or Practice, GOD knoweth) suddenly forsooke mee. Whereby I was forced to wander abroade, and to seeke meane Conditions for the sustaining of my Life. Wherefore distracted betweene seuerall Passions, the one of Feare to bee knowne, lest the Tyrant should haue a new Attempt vpon mee, the other of Griefe and Disdaine to bee vnknowne, and to liue in that

base and seruile manner that I did; I resolued with my selfe, to expect the Tyrants Death, and then to put my selfe into my Sisters hands, who was next Heire to the Crowne. But in this Season, it happened one HENRIE TIDDER, sonne to EDMOND TIDDER Earle of Richmond, to come from France, and enter into the Realme, and by subtile and foule meanes to obtaine the Crowne of the same, which to mee rightfully appertained. So that it was but a Change, from Tyrant to Tyrant. This HENRIE, my extreame and mortall Enemie, so soone as hee had knowledge of my beeing aliue, imagined and wrought all the subtill waies and meanes hee could, to procure my finall Destruction. For my mortall Enemie hath not onely falsly surmised, mee to bee a fayned Person, giuing mee Nick-names, so abusing the World; but also, to deferre and put mee from entrie into England, hath offered large Summes of Money, to corrupt the Princes and their Ministers, with whom I haue beene retayned; and made importune Labours to certaine Seruants about my Person, to murther or poyson mee, and others to forsake and leaue my Righteous Quarrell, and to depart from my Seruice, as Sir ROBERT CLIFFORD, and others. So that euery

Man of Reason may well perceiue, that HENRIE, calling himselfe King of England, needed not to haue bestowed such great Summes of Treasure, nor so to haue busied himselfe with importune and incessant Labour and Industrie, to compasse my Death and Ruine, if I had beene such a fained Person. But the truth of my Cause beeing so manifest, moued the most Christian King CHARLES, and the Lady Duchesse Dowager of Burgundie, my most Deare Aunt, not onely to acknowledge the truth thereof, but louingly to assist mee. But it seemeth that GOD aboue (for the good of this whole Island, and the knitting of these two Kingdomes of England and Scotland in a strait Concord and Amitie, by so great an Obligation) had reserued the placing of mee in the Imperiall Throne of England, for the Armes and Succours of your Grace. Neither is it the first time that a King of Scotland hath supported them, that were bereft and spoyled of the Kingdome of England; as of late (in fresh memorie) it was done in the Person of HENRY the Sixth. Wherefore for that your Grace hath giuen cleare Signes, that you are in no Noble qualitie inferiour to your Royall Ancestours; I, so distressed a Prince, was hereby mooued to come and put my Selfe into your

               Royall Hands, desiring your Assistance to recouer my Kingdome of England; promising faithfully to beare my Selfe towards your Grace no otherwise, than If I were your owne Naturall Brother, and will vpon the Recouerie of mine Inheritance, gratefully doe you all the Pleasure that is in my vtmost Power.
            
            AFter PERKIN had told his Tale, King IAMES answered brauely and wisely; That whatsoeuer hee were, hee should not repent him, of putting himselfe into his hands. And from that time forth, though there wanted not some about him, that would haue perswaded him, that all was but an Illusion; yet notwithstanding, either taken by PERKINS amiable and alluring behauiour, or inclining to the recommendation of the great Princes abroade, or willing to take an occasion of a Warre against King HENRY, hee entertained him in all things, as became the person of RICHARD Duke of Yorke; embraced his Quarrell; and (the more to put it out of doubt, that hee tooke him to bee a great Prince, and not a Representation onely) hee gaue consent, that this Duke should take to wife the Lady KATHERINE GORDON, daughter to the Earle Huntley, beeing a neare Kinswoman to the King himselfe, and a young Uirgin of excellent beautie and vertue.
            Not long after, the King of Scots in person, with PERKIN in his company, entred with a great Armie (though it consisted chiefly of Borderers, beeing raysed somewhat suddenly) into Northumberland. And PERKIN, for a Perfume before him as hee went,

caused to be published a Proclamation of this tenor following, in the name of RICHARD Duke of Yorke, true inheritor of the Crowne of England.
            
            
               IT hath pleased GOD, Who putteth downe 
               The Originall of this Proclamation remaineth with Sir Robert Cotton, a worthy Preseruer and Treasurer of rare Antiquities: from whose Manuscripts I haue had much light for the furnishing of this Worke. 
               the Mightie from their Seate, and exalteth the Humble, and suffereth not the Hopes of the Iust to perish in the end, to giue Us meanes at the length, to shew Our Selues armed vnto Our Leiges and People of England. But far bee it from Us, to intend their hurt and dammage, or to make Warre vpon them, otherwise than to deliuer Our Selfe and them from Tyrannie and Oppression. For, our mortall Enemie HENRY TIDDER, a false Vsurper of the Crowne of England, (which to Vs by Naturall and Lineall Right appertaineth) knowing in his owne Heart Our vndoubted Right, (Wee being the very RICHARD, Duke of Yorke, younger Sonne, and now suruiuing Heire-male of the Noble and Uictorious EDWARD the Fourth, late King of England) hath not onely depriued Us of Our Kingdome, but likewise by all foule and wicked meanes, sought to betray Us, and bereaue Us of Our Life. Yet if his Tyrannie onely extended it selfe to Our Person (although Our Royall Bloud teacheth Us to bee sensible of Iniuries) it should bee lesse to Our Griefe. But this
               
TIDDER, who boasteth himselfe to haue ouerthrown a Tyrant, hath euer since his first entrance into his Vsurped Reigne, put little in practice, but Tyrannie and the feats thereof.
            
            
               For King RICHARD, our Vnnaturall Uncle, although desire of Rule did blinde him, yet in his other actions (like a true PLANTAGENET) was Noble, and loued the Honour of the Realme, and the Contentment and Comfort of his Nobles and People. But this our Mortall Enemie (agreeable to the meanesse of his Birth) hath troden under foote the honour of this Nation; selling our best Confederates for Money, and making Merchandize of the Bloud, Estates, and Fortunes of our Peeres and Subiects, by fained Warres, and dishonourable Peace, onely to enrich his Coffers. Nor vnlike hath beene his hatefull Mis-gouernement, and euill Deportments at home. First, hee hath (to fortifie his false Quarrell) caused diuers Nobles of this our Realme (whom hee held Suspect, &amp; stood in dread of) to be cruelly murthred; as our Cousin Sir VVILLIAM STANLEY Lord Chamberlain, Sir SIMON MOVNTFORT, Sir ROBERT RATCLIFFE, WILLIAM DAWBENEY, HVMPHREY STAFFORD, and many others, besides such as haue dearely bought their liues with intolerable Ransomes.

Some of which Nobles are now in the Sanctuary. Also hee hath long kept, and yet keepeth in Prison, our right entirely welbeloued Cosen EDWARD, Sonne and Heire to our Unckle Duke of Clarence, and others; with-holding from them their rightfull Inheritance, to the intent they should neuer be of might and power, to aide and assist vs at our neede, after the dutie of their Liegeances. Hee also married by Compulsion certaine of our Sisters, and also the Sister of our said Cosen the Earle of VVarwicke, and diuers other Ladies of the Royall Bloud, vnto certaine of his Kinsmen and Friends of simple and low Degree; and putting apart all Well-disposed Nobles, he hath none in fauour and trust about his Person, but Bishop FOX, SMITH, BRAY, LOVEL, OLIVER KING, DAVID OWEN, RISELEY, TVRBERVILE, TILER, CHOLMLEY; EMPSON, IAMES HOBART, IOHN CVT, GARTH, HENRY WYAT, and such other Caitifes and Uillaines of Birth, which by subtile inuentions and Pilling of the People, haue beene the principall Finders, Occasioners, and Counsellors of the Mis-rule and Mischiefe now reigning in England.
            
            Wee remembring these Premisses, with the great and execrable Offences daily committed, and done by our foresaid great Enemie, and his

               Adherents, in breaking the Liberties and Franchises of our Mother the Holy Church, vpon pretences of Wicked and Heathenish Policie, to the high displeasure of Almightie GOD; besides the manifold Treasons, abominable Murthers, Man-slaughters, Robberies, Extortions, the dayly Pilling of the People, by Dismes, Taxes, Tallages, Beneuolences, and other vnlawfull Impositions, and grieuous Exactions, with many other haynous Effects, to the likely destruction and desolation of the whole Realme: shall by Gods Grace; and the helpe and assistance of the great Lords of our Bloud, with the Counsell of other sad Persons, see that the Commodities of our Realme bee imployed to the most aduantage of the same; the entercouse of Merchandise betwixt Realme and Realme, to bee ministred and handled, as shall more bee to the Common weale, and prosperity of our Subiects; and all such Dismes, Taxes, Tallages, Beneuolences, vnlawfull Impositions, and grieuous Exactions, as bee aboue rehearsed to bee fore-done and layd apart, and neuer from henceforth to bee called vpon, but in such cases as our noble Progenitors Kings of England, haue of old time bin accustomed to haue the Ayde, Succour, and helpe of their Subiects and true Liege-men.
            And further, wee doe out of our Grace and

               Clemencie, hereby as well publish and promise to all our Subiects Remission and free Pardon of all By-past Offences whatsoeuer, against our Person, or Estate, in adhering to our said Enemie, by whom (wee know well) they haue beene mis-led, if they shall within time conuenient submit themselues vnto Us. And for such as shall come with the foremost, to assist our Righteous Quarrell, wee shall make them so farre partakers of our Princely Fauour and Bountie, as shall bee highly for the Comfort of them and theirs, both during their Life, and after their Death. As also wee shall by all meanes, which GOD shall put into our hands, demeane our selues to giue Royall contentment to all Degrees and Estates of our People, maintaining the Liberties of Holy Church in their Entire, preseruing the Honours, Priuiledges, and Preheminences of our Nobles, from Contempt or disparagement, according to the Dignitie of their Bloud. Wee shall also vnyoake our People from all heauie Burthens, and Endurances, and confirme our Cities, Boroughes, and Townes, in their Charters &amp; Freedoms, with inlargement, where it shalbe deserued; and in all points giue our Subiects cause to thinke, that the blessed and debonaire Gouernment of our Noble Father King EDWARD (in his last times) is in vs reuiued.
            
               
And for as much as the putting to death, or taking aliue of our said Mortall Enemie, may bee a meane to stay much effusion of Blood, which otherwise may ensue, if by Compulsion or faire Promises, hee shall draw after him any number of our Subiects to resist vs; which wee desire to auoyd (though wee bee certainely informed that our said Enemie is purposed and prepared to flye the Land, hauing already made ouer great Masses of the Treasure of our Crowne, the better to support him in Forraine Parts) Wee doe hereby declare, That whosoeuer shall take or distresse our said Enemie (though the Party bee of neuer so meane a Condition) hee shall bee by Us rewarded with a Thousand Pound in Money, forthwith to bee laid downe to him, and an Hundred Markes by the yeare of Inheritance; besides that hee may otherwise merit, both toward God and all good People, for the destruction of such a Tyrant.
            
            
               Lastly, wee doe all men to wit, and herein wee take also God to witnesse, That whereas GOD hath mooued the Heart of our Dearest Cousin, the King of Scotland, to aide vs in Person, in this our righteous Quarrell; it is altogether without any Pact or Promise, or so much as demaund of any thing, that may preiudice our Crowne or Subiects: But contrariwise

with promise on our said Cousins part, that whensoeuer hee shall finde vs in sufficient strength to get the vpper hand of our Enemie (which wee hope will bee very suddenly) hee will forthwith peaceably returne into his owne Kingdome; contenting himselfe onely with the glorie of so Honourable an Enterprise, and our true and faithfull Loue and Amitie. Which wee shall euer (by the Grace of Almightie GOD) so order, as shall bee to the great comfort of both Kingdomes.
            BVt PERKINS Proclamation did little edifie with the people of England; neither was hee the better welcome for the company hee came in. Wherefore the King of Scotland seeing none came in to PERKIN, nor none stirred any where in his fauour, turned his enterprise into a Rode; and wasted and destroyed the Countrie of Northumberland, with fire and sword. But hearing that there were Forces comming against him, and not willing that they should finde his Men heauie and laden with bootie, hee returned into Scotland with great Spoyles, deferring further prosecution, till another time. It is said, that PERKIN acting the part of a Prince handsomely, when hee saw the Scottish fell to waste the Countrey, came to the King in a passionate manner, making great lamentation, and desired, That that might not bee the manner of making the Warre; for that no Crowne was so deare to his minde, as that hee desired to purchase it with the bloude and ruine of his Countrey. Whereunto the King answered halfe in sport; that hee doubted much, hee was carefull for that that was none of his, and

that hee should bee too good a Steward for his Enemie, to saue the Countrie to his vse.
            By this time, beeing the Eleuenth yeare of the King, the Interruption of Trade betweene the English and the Flemmish, beganne to pinch the Merchants of both Nations very sore. Which mooued them, by all meanes they could deuise, to affect and dispose their Soueraignes respectiuely, to open the Entercourse againe. Wherein, time fauoured them. For the Arch-Duke and his Councell beganne to see, that PERKIN would prooue but a Runnagate, and Citizen of the World; and that it was the part of children to fall out about Babies. And the King on his part, after the Attempts vpon Kent and Northumberland, beganne to haue the businesse of PERKIN in lesse estimation; so as hee did not put it to accompt, in any Consultation of State. But that that mooued him most, was, that beeing a King that loued Wealth and Treasure, hee could not endure to haue Trade sicke, nor any Obstruction to continue in the Gate-veine, which disperseth that bloud. And yet he kept State so farre, as first to bee sought vnto. Wherein the Merchant-Aduenturers likewise, (beeing a strong Companie at that time, and well vnderset with rich Men, and good order) did hold out brauely; taking off the Commodities of the Kingdome, though they lay dead vpon their hands for want of Vent. At the last, Commissioners met at London, to Treate. On the Kings part; Bishop FOXE Lord Priuy Seale, Viscount Wells, KENDAL Prior of Saint IOHNS, WARHAM Master of the Rolles, who beganne to gaine much vpon the Kings opinion; VRSWICK, who was almost euer one; and RISELY. On the Arch-Dukes part, the Lord BEVERS his Admirall, the Lord VERVNSEL President of Flanders, and others. These concluded a perfect Treatie, both of Amitie and Intercourse,
               
betweene the King and the Arch-Duke; Contayning Articles both of State, Commerce, and Free-Fishing. This is that Treatie, which the Flemmings call at this day, Intercursus Magnus; both because it is more compleat, than the precedent Treaties, of the Third and Fourth yeares of the King: and chiefly to giue it a difference, from the Treatie that followed in the One and twentieth yeare of the King: which they call Intercursus Malus. In this Treatie, there was an expresse Article against the Reception of the Rebels of either Prince by other; purporting, that if any such Rebell should bee required by the Prince whose Rebell hee was, of the Prince Confederate, that forthwith the Prince Confederate should by Proclamation command him to auoyde the Countrey. Which if hee did not within fifteene daies, the Rebell was to stand proscribed, and put out of Protection. But neuerthelesse in this Article, PERKIN was not named, neither perhaps contained, because hee was no Rebell. But by this meanes his wings were clipt of his Followers, that were English. And it was expresly comprised in the Treatie, that it should extend to the Territories of the Duchesse Dowager. After the Intercourse thus restored, The English Merchants came againe to their Mansion at Antwerpe, where they were receiued with Procession and great Ioy.
            The Winter following, beeing the Twelfth yeare of his reigne, The King called againe his Parliament: where hee did much exaggerate both the Malice, and the cruell Predatory Warre lately made by the King of Scotland; That that King, being in Amitie with him, and no wayes prouoked, should so burne in hatred towards him, as to drinke of the Lees and Dreggs of PERKINS Intoxication, who was euery where else detected and discarded: And that when hee perceiued it was out of his reach, to doe the King any hurt,

hee had turned his Armes vpon vnarmed and vnprouided People, to spoyle onely and depopulate, contrary to the Lawes both of Warre and Peace: Concluding, that hee could neither with Honour, nor with the safety of his People, to whom he did owe Protection, let passe these wrongs vnreuenged. The Parliament vnderstood him well, and gaue him a Subsidie, limited to the summe of one hundred and twentie thousand Pounds, besides two Fifteenes. For his Warres were alwaies to him as a Mine of Treasure, of a strange kind of Ore; Iron at the top, and Gold and Siluer at the bottome. At this Parliament (for that there had beene so much time spent in making Lawes the yeare before, and for that it was called purposely in respect of the Scottish Warre) there were no Lawes made to bee remembred. Onely there passed a Law, at the Sute of the Merchant-Aduenturers of England, against the Merchant-Aduenturers of London, for Monopolizing and exacting vpon the Trade: Which it seemeth they did, a little to saue themselues, after the hard time they had sustained by want of Trade. But those Innouations were taken away by Parliament.
            
            But it was fatall to the King, to fight for his money. And though hee auoyded to fight with Enemies abroad, yet hee was still enforced to fight for it with Rebels at home. For no sooner beganne the Subsidie to bee leuied in Corne-wall, but the People there began to grudge and murmure. The Cornish being a Race of Men, stout of stomacke, mighty of Bodie and Limme, and that liued hardly in a barren Countrey, and many of them could (for a neede) liue vnder ground, that were Tinners; they muttered extreamely, that it was a thing not to be suffered, that for a little stirre of the Scots, soone blowne ouer, they should be thus grinded to Powder with Payments: And said, it was for them to pay, that had too much, and liued idly. But

they would eate the bread they got with the sweat of their browes, and no man should take it from them. And as in the Tides of People once vp, there want not commonly stirring Windes to make them more rough: So this People did light vpon two Ring-leaders, or Captaines of the Rout. The one was one MICHAEL IOSEPH, a Black-smith or Farrier of Bodmin; anotable talking Fellow, and no lesse desirous to bee talked of. The other was THOMAS FLAMMOCKE, a Lawyer; who by telling his neighbours commonly vpon any occasion, that the Law was on their side, had gotten great sway amongst them. This Man talked learnedly, and as if he could tell how to make a Rebellion, and neuer breake the Peace. Hee told the People, that Subsidies were not to be granted nor leuied in this case; that is, for Warres of Scotland (for that the Law had prouided another course, by seruice of Escuage, for those Iourneyes) much lesse when all was quiet, and Warre was made but a Pretence to poll and pill the People: And therefore that it was good, they should not stand now like Sheepe before the Shearers, but put on Harnesse, and take Weapons in their hands: Yet to doe no creature hurt; but goe and deliuer the King a Strong Petition, for the laying downe of those grieuous Payments, and for the punishment of those that had giuen him that Counsell; to make others beware how they did the like in time to come: And said, for his part hee did not see how they could doe the duetie of true English-men, and good Liege-men, except they did deliuer the King from such wicked Ones that would destroy both Him and the Countrey. Their ayme was at Arch-Bishop MORTON, and Sir REGINOLD BRAY, who were the Kings Skreens in this Enuy.
            After that these two, FLAMMOCKE and the Blacke-smith, had, by ioynt and seuerall Pratings, found

tokens of consent in the Multitude, they offered themselues to leade them, vntill they should heare of better men to be their Leaders; which they said would be ere long: Telling them further, that they would be but their seruants, and first in euery danger; but doubted not but to make both the West-end and the East-end of England to meete in so good a Quarrell; and that all (rightly vnderstood) was but for the Kings seruice. The People, vpon these seditious Instigations, did arme (most of them with Bowes, and Arrowes, and Bills, and such other Weapons of rude and Countrey People) and forthwith vnder the Command of their Leaders (which in such cases is euer at pleasure) marched out of Corne-wall, through Deuonshire, vnto Taunton in Somersetshire, without any slaughter, violence, or spoyle of the Countrey. At Taunton they killed, in furie, an officious and eager Commissioner for the Subsidie, whom they called The Prouost of Perin. Thence they marched to Wells: where the Lord AVDLEY (with whom their Leaders had, before, some secret Intelligence) a Noble-man of an ancient Family, but vnquiet and popular, and aspiring to Ruine, came-in to them, and was by them (with great Gladnesse and cries of Ioy) accepted as their Generall; they beeing now proud, that they were ledde by a Noble-man. The Lord AVDLEY ledde them on from Wells to Salisbury, and from Salisbury to Winchester. Thence the foolish people, who (in effect) led their Leaders, had a minde to beeled into Kent; fansying, that the People there would ioyne with them, contrary to all reason or iudgement; considering, the Kentish-men had shewed great Loyaltie and Affection to the King so lately before. But the rude People had heard FDAMMOCKE say, that Kent was neuer Conquered, and that they were the freest People of England. And, vpon these vaine Noises, they looked for great matters at their hands,

in a cause which they conceited to be for the libertie of the Subiect. But when they were come into Kent, the Countrey was so well settled, both by the Kings late kind vsage towards them, and by the credit and power of the Earle of Kent, the Lord ABERGAVENNIE, and the Lord COBHAM, as neither Gentleman nor Yeoman came-in to their aide; which did much dampe and dismay many of the simpler sort: Insomuch, as diuers of them did secretly flie from the Army, and went home. But the sturdier sort, and those that were most engaged, stood by it, and rather waxed Proud, than failed in Hopes and Courage. For as it did somewhat appall them, that the people came not in to them; so it did no lesse encourage them, that the Kings Forces had not set vpon them, hauing marched from the West vnto the East of England. Wherefore they kept on their way, and encamped vpon Blacke-heath, betweene Greenwich and Eltham; threatning either to bid Battell to the King (for now the Seas went higher than to MORTON, and BRAIE) or to take London within his view; imagining with themselues, there to finde no lesse Feare, than Wealth.
            
            But to returne to the King. When first hee heard of this Commotion of the Cornish-men, occasioned by the Subsidie; he was much troubled therewith: Not for it selfe, but in regard of the Concurrence of other Dangers, that did hang ouer him at that time. For hee doubted lest a Warre from Scotland, a Rebellion from Corne-wall, and the Practices and Conspiracies of PERKIN and his Partakers, would come vpon him at once; Knowing well, that it was a dangerous Triplicitie to a Monarchie, to haue the Armes of a Forreiner, the Discontents of Subiects, and the Title of a Pretender, to meete. Neuerthelesse, the Occasion tooke him in some part well prouided. For as soone as the Parliament had broken vp, the King had presently raysed a

puissant Armie, to Warre vpon Scotland. And King IAMES of Scotland likewise, on his part, had made great Preparations eyther for defence, or for new assayling of England. But as for the Kings Forces, they were not onely in preparation, but in readinesse presently to set forth, vuder the Conduct of DAWBENEY, the Lord Chamberlaine. But as soone as the King vnderstood of the Rebellion of Cornwall, hee stayed those Forces, retaining them for his owne seruice and safetie. But therewithall hee dispatched the Earle of Surrey into the North, for the defence and strength of those Parts, in case the Scots should stirre. But for the course hee held towards the Rebels, it was vtterly differing from his former custome, and practice; which was euer full of forwardnesse and celeritie, to make head against them, or to set vpon them as soone as euer they were in Action. This hee was wont to doe. But now, besides that hee was attempered by Yeares, and lesse in loue with Dangers, by the continued Fruition of a Crowne; it was a time when the various appearance to his Thoughts of Perils of seuerall Natures, and from diuers Parts, did make him iudge it his best and surest way, to keepe his Strength together, in the Seate and Centre of his Kingdome. According to the ancient Indian Embleme; in such a swelling Season, To hould the hand vpon the middle of the Bladder, that no side might rise. Besides, there was no necessitie put vpon him, to alter this Counsell. For neither did the Rebels spoyle the Countrey; in which case it had beene dishonour to abandon his People: Neyther on the other side, did their Forces gather or encrease, which might hasten him to precipitate and assayle them, before they grew too strong. And lastly, both Reason of Estate and Warre seemed to agree with this course; For that Insurrections of base People are commonly more furious

in their Beginnings. And by this meanes also hee had them the more at Vantage, beeing tyred and harrassed with a long march; and more at Mercie, being cut off farre from their Countrey, and therefore not able by any sudden flight to get to Retrait, and to renew the Troubles.
            
            When therefore the Rebels were encamped on Blacke-Heath, vpon the Hill, whence they might behold the Citie of London, and the faire Valley about it: the King knowing well, that it stood him vpon, by how much the more hee had hitherto protracted the time in not encountring them, by so much the sooner to dispatch with them, that it might appeare to haue beene no Coldnesse in foreslowing, but Wisedome in choosing his time; resolued with all speede to assayle them, and yet with that Prouidence, and Suretie, as should leaue little to Venture or Fortune. And hauing very great and puissant Forces about him, the better to master all Euents and Accidents, hee diuided them into three parts. The first was ledde by the Earle of Oxford in chiefe, assisted by the Earles of Essex and Suffolke. These Noblemen were appointed, with some Cornets of Horse, and Bands of Foot, and good store of Artillerie wheeling about, to put themselues beyond the Hill, where the Rebels were encamped; and to beset all the Skirts and Descents thereof, except those that lay towards London; whereby to haue these Wilde Beasts (as it were) in a Toyle. The second part of his Forces (which were those that were to bee most in Action, and vpon which hee relyed most for the Fortune of the Day) hee did assigne to bee ledde by the Lord Chamberlaine, who was appointed to set vpon the Rebels in Front, from that side which is toward London. The third part of his Forces (beeing likewise great and braue Forces) hee retained about himselfe, to bee ready, vpon all Euents, to restore the Fight, or

consummate the Victorie; and meane while, to secure the Citie. And for that purpose hee encamped in Person in Saint GEORGES Fields, putting himselfe betweene the Citie, and the Rebels. But the Citie, of London (specially at the first) vpon the neare encamping of the Rebels, was in great Tumult: As it vseth to bee with wealthy and populous Cities (especially those, which, for greatnesse and fortune, are Queenes of their Regions) who seldome see out of their Windowes, or from their Towers, an Armie of enemies. But that which troubled them most, was the conceit, that they dealt with a Rout of People, with whom there was no Composition, or Condition, or orderly Treating, if neede were; but likely to bee bent altogether vpon Rapine and Spoyle. And although they had heard that the Rebels had behaued themselues quietly and modestly, by the way as they went; yet they doubted much, That would not last, but rather make them more hungry, and more in appetite, to fall vpon spoyle in the end. Wherefore there was great running to and fro of People, some to the Gates, some to the Walles, some to the Water-side; giuing themselues Alarmes, and Panick feares continually. Neuerthelesse, both TATE the Lord Maior, and SHAW, and HADDON, the Sheriffs, did their parts stoutly and well, in arming and ordering the People. And the King likewise did adioyne some Captaines of experience in the Wartes, to aduise and assist the Citizens. But soone after, when they vnderstood that the King had so ordered the matter, that the Rebels must winne three Battells, before they could approach the Citie, and that hee had put his own Person betweene the Rebels and them, and that the great care was rather how to impound the Rebels, that none of them might escape, than that any doubt was made to vanquish them; they grew to bee quiet and out of feare.

The rather, for the confidence they reposed (which was not small) in the three Leaders, OXFORD, ESSEX, and DAWBENEY; All, men famed and loued amongst the People. As for IASPER Duke of Bedford, whom the King vsed to employ with the first in his Wars, he was then sicke, and dyed soone after.
            It was the two and twentieth of Iune, and a Saturday (which was the Day of the weeke the King fansied) when the Battaile was fought; though the King had, by all the Art hee could deuise, giuen out a false Day, as if hee prepared to giue the Rebells Battaile on the Monday following, the better to find them vnprouided, and in disarray. The Lords, that were appointed to circle the Hill, had some daies before planted themselues (as at the Receipt) in places conuenient. In the afternoone towards the decline of the day (which was done, the better to keepe the Rebells in opinion that they should not fight that day) the Lord DAWBENEY marched on towards them, and first beat some Troups of them from Detford-bridge, where they fought manfully; But beeing in no great number were soone driuen backe, and fled vp to their maine Armie vpon the Hill. The Armie, at that time hearing of the approach of the Kings Forces, were putting themselues in Array, not without much Confusion. But neither had they placed vpon the first high-ground towards the Bridge, any Forces to second the Troupes below, that kept the Bridge; neither had they brought forwards their Maine Battaile (which stood in array farre into the Heath) neare to the ascent of the Hill. So that the Earle with his Forces mounted the Hill, and recouered the Plaine, without resistance. The Lord DAWBENEY charged them with great furie; Insomuch, as it had like (by accident) to haue brandled the Fortune of the Day. For, by inconsiderate Forwardnesse in fighting in the head of his Troupes,
               
he was taken by the Rebells; but, immediately rescued, and deliuered. The Rebells maintained the Fight for a small time, and for their Persons shewed no want of courage: but beeing ill armed, and ill led, and without Horse or Artillerie, they were with no great difficultie cut in peeces, and put to flight. And for their three Leaders; the Lord AVDLEY, the Black-smith, and FLAMMOCKE (as, commonly the Captaines of Commotions are but halfe-couraged Men) suffered themselues to bee taken aliue. The number slaine on the Rebells part, were some two thousand Men; their Armie amounting (as it is said) vnto the number of sixteene thousand. The rest were (in effect) all taken; for that the Hill, as was said, was encompassed with the Kings Forces round about. On the Kings part there dyed about three hundred; most of them shot with Arrowes, which were reported to bee of the length of a Taylors yard: So strong and mighty a Bow the Cornish-men were said to draw.
            The Victorie thus obtained, the King created diuers Bannerets, as well vpon Black-heath, where his Lieutenant had wonne the Fielde (whither hee rode in Person to performe the said Creation) as in Saint GEORGES Fieldes, where his owne Person had bin encamped. And for matter of Liberalitie, he did (by open Edict) giue the goods of all the Prisoners, vnto those that had taken them; either to take them in Kinde, or compound for them as they could. After matter of Honour and Liberalitie, followed matter of Seueritie and Execution. The Lord AVDLEY was led from Newgate to Tower-hill, in a Paper Coate painted with his own Armes; the Armes reuersed, the Coate torne, and hee at Tower-hill beheaded. FLAMMOCKE, and the Black-smith vvere hanged, drawn, and quartered at Tiburne; The Black-smith taking pleasure vpon the Hurdle (as it seemeth by vvords

that hee vttered) to thinke that hee should be famous in aftertimes. The King was once in minde to haue sent downe FLAMMOCKE, and the Blac-smith, to haue beene executed in Corne-wall, for the more terrour. But, beeing aduertised, that the Countrey was yet vnquiet and boyling, hee thought better not to irritate the People further. All the rest were pardoned by Proclamation, and to take out their Pardons vnder Seale, as many as would. So that, more than the bloud drawn in the Field, the King did satisfie himselfe with the liues of onely three Offenders, for the expiation of this great Rebellion.
            
            It was a strange thing, to obserue the varietie and inequalitie of the Kings Executions and Pardons. And a man would thinke it, at the first, a kinde of Lotterie or Chance. But, looking into it more nearely, one shall find there was reason for it; much more perhaps, than (after so long a distance of time) wee can now discerne. In the Kentish Commotion (which was but an landfull of men) there were executed to the number of one hundred and fiftie; and, in this so mighty a Rebellion, but three: Whether it were, that the king put go accompt the men that wereslaine in the Fielde: or that hee was not willing to bee seuerein a popular Cause; or that the harmelesse behauiour of this People (that came from the West of England, to the East, without mischiefe almost, or spoyle of the Countrey) did somewhat mollifie him, and mooue him to Compassion, or lastly, that he made a great difference betwoene People, that did Rebell vpon Wantonnesse, and them that did Rebell vpon Want.
            
            After the Cornish-men were defeated, there came from, Calice to the King, an honourable Ambassage from the French King, which had arriued at Calice a Moneth before, and there was stayed in respect of the troubles, but honourably entertained and defrayed.
            
               
The King, at their first comming, sent vnto them, &amp; prayed them to haue patience, till a little Smoake, that was raised in his Countrie, were ouer; which would sonne bee: Slighting (as his manner was) that openly, which neuerthelesse he intended seriously.
            This Ambassage concerned no great Affaire; but only the Prolongation of Dayes for payment of Monies, and some other Particulars of the Frontiers. And it was (indeed) but a wooing Ambassage; with good respects to entertaine the King in good affection: but nothing was done, or handled, to the derogation of the Kings late Treatie with the Italians.
            
            But, during the time that the Cornish-men were in their march towards London, the King of Scotland (wel aduertised of all that passed, and knowing himselfe sure of Warre from England, whensoeuer those Stirs were appeased) neglected not his opportunitie; But, thinking the King had his hands full, entred the Frontiers of England againe with an Armie, and besieged the Castle of Norham in Person, with part of his Forces, sending the rest to Forrage the Countrie. But FOX, Bishop of Duresme (a wise man, and one that could see through the Present, to the Future) doubting as much before, had caused his Castle of Norham to bee strongly fortified, and furnished, with all kinde of Munition: And had manned it likewise, with a very great number of tall Souldiours, more than for the proportion of the Castle; reckoning rather vpon a sharpe Assault, than a long Siege. And for the Countrey likewise, hee had caused the People to withdraw their Cattell and Goods into Fast Places, that were not of easie approach; and sent in Post to the Earle of Surrey (who was not farre off, in Yorkeshire) to come in diligence to the Succour. So as the Scottish King both failed of doing good vpon the Castle, and his men had but a Catching Haruest of their Spoyles. And

when hee vnderstood, that the Earle of Surrey was comming on with great Forces, hee returned backe into Scotland. The Earle finding the Castle freed, and the enemie retired, pursued with all celeritie into Scotland; hoping to haue ouer-taken the Scottish King, and to haue giuen him Battaile; But not attaining him in time, sate downe before the Castle of Aton (one of the strongest places, then esteemed, betweene Barwicke and Edenborough) which in a small time hee tooke. And soone after, the Scottish King retyring further into his Countrey, and the weather being extraordinarie foule and stormie, the Earle returned into England. So that the Expeditions on both parts were (in effect) but a Castle taken, and a Castle distressed; not answerable to the puissance of the Forces, nor to the heat of the Quarrell, nor to the greatness of the Expectation.
            
            Amongst these Troubles both Ciuill and Externall, came into England from Spaine PETER HIALAS, some call him ELIAS (surely hee was the forerunner of the good Hap, that we enioy at this day. For, his Ambassage set the Truce betweene England and Scotland; the Truce drew on the Peace; the Peace the Marriage; and the Marriage the Union of the Kingdomes) a Man of great wisedome, and (as those times were) not vnlearned; sent from FERDINANDO and IS ABELLA Kings of Spaine vnto the King, to treate a Marriage betweene KATHERINE their second daughter, and Prince ARTHVR. This Treatie was by him set in a very good way, and almost brought to perfection. But it so fell out by the way, that vpon some Conference which hee had with the King touching this businesse, the King (who had a great dexteritie in getting sodainely into the bosome of Ambassadours of forraine Princes, if he liked the men; Insomuch as he would many times communicate with them of his

owne affaires, yea and employ them in his seruice) fell into speech and discourse incidently, concerning the ending of the Debates and differences with Scotland. For the King naturally did not loue the barren Warres with Scotland, though he made his profit of the Noise of them. And he wanted not in the Councell of Scotland those that would aduise their King to meet him at the halfe way, and to giue ouer the War with England; pretending to bee good Patriots; but indeede fauouring the affaires of the King. Onely his heart was too great to beginne with Scotland for the motion of Peace. On the other side, he had met with an Allie of FERDINANDO of Arragon, as fit for his turne as could bee. For after that King FERDINANDO had, vpon assured Confidence of the Marriage to succeed, taken vpon him the person of a Fraternall Allie to the King, hee would not let (in a Spanish grauitie) to counsell the King in his owne affaires. And the King on his part not being wanting to himselfe, but making vse of euery mans humours, made his aduantage of this in such things as hee thought either not decent, or not pleasant to proceede from himselfe; putting them off as done by the Counsell of FERDINANDO. Wherefore hee was content that HIALAS (as in a matter mooued and aduised from HIALAS himselfe) should goe into Scotland, to treate of a Concord betweene the two Kings. HIALAS tooke it vpon him: and comming to the Scottish King, after hee had with much Art brought King IAMES to hearken to the more safe and quiet Counsells, wrote vnto the King, that hee hoped that Peace would with no great difficultie cement and close, if hee would send some wise and temperate Counsellour of his owne, that might treate of the Conditions. Whereupon the King directed Bishop FOX (who at that time was at his Castle of Norham) to conferre with HIALAS, and they both to treate with

some Commissioners, deputed from the Scottish King. The Commissioners on both sides met. But after much dispute vpon the Articles and Conditions of Peace, propounded vpon eyther part, they could not conclude a Peace. The chiefe Impediments thereof was the demand of the King, to haue PERKIN deliuered into his hands, as a Reproach to all Kings, and a Person not protected by the Law of Nations. The King of Scotland, on the other side, peremptorily denied so to doe; saying, That he (for his part) was no Competent Iudge of PERKINS Title: But that he had receiued him as a Suppliant, protected him as a Person fled for Refuge, espoused him with his Kinswoman, and aided him with his Armes, vpon the beleefe that hee was a Prince; And therefore that hee could not now with his Honour so vnrippe and (in a sort) put a Lye vpon all that hee had said and done before, as to deliuer him vp to his Enemies. The Bishop likewise (who had certaine proud instructions from the King, at the least in the Front, though there were a pliant clause at the Foote, that remitted all to the Bishops discretion, and required him by no meanes to breake off in ill tearmes) after that he had fayled to obtaine the deliuerie of PERKIN, did mooue a second point of his Instructions; which was, that the Scottish King would giue the King an Enteruiew in Person at Newcastle. But this being reported to the Scottish King, his answer was; That he meant to treate a Peace, and not to goe a begging for it. The Bishop also (according to another Article of his Instructions) demanded Restitution of the Spoyles taken by the Scottish, or Damages for the same. But the Scottish Commissioners answered; That that was but as Water spilt vpon the ground, which could not bee gotten vp againe; and that the Kings People were better able to beare the losse, than their Master to repaire it. But in the end (as Persons capable of reason)

on both sides they made rather a kinde of Recesse, than a Breach of Treaty, &amp; concluded vpon a Truce for some moneths following. But the King of Scotland, though hee would not formally retract his iudgement of PERKIN, wherein he had engaged himselfe so farre; yet in his priuate opinion, vpon often speech with the English-men, and diuers other aduertisements, began to suspect him for a Counterfeit. Wherefore in a Noble fashion hee called him vnto him, and recounted the Benefits and fauours that he had done him, in making him his Allie, and in prouoking a Mighty and Opulent King by an Offensiue Warre in his Quarrell, for the space of two yeares together. Nay more, that he had refused an Honourable Peace, whereof he had a faire Offer, if he would haue deliuered him; and that to keepe his promise with him, he had deepely offended both his Nobles and People, whom he might not hold in any long discontent. And therefore required him to thinke of his own Fortunes, and to choose out some fitter place for his Exile: Telling him withall, that he could not say, but the English had forsaken him before the Scottish; for that vpon two seueral Trials, none had declared themselues on his side. But neuerthelesse hee would make good what he said to him at his first receiuing, which was; That hee should not repent him, for putting himselfe into his hands; For that he would not cast him off, but helpe him with Spipping and meanes, to transport him where he should desire. PERKIN, not descending at all from his Stage-like Greatnesse, answered the King in few words; That he saw his time was not yet come: But whatsoeuer his Fortunes were, he should both thinke and speake Honour of the King. Taking his leaue, hee would not thinke on Flanders, doubting it was but hollow ground for him, since the Treatie of the Arch-Duke concluded the yeare before; but tooke his Ladie, and such Followers

as would not leaue him, and sailed ouer into Ireland.
            
            This Twelfth yeare of the King, a little before this time, Pope ALEXANDER (who loued best those Princes that were furthest off, and with whom he had least to doe) taking very thankefully the Kings late entrance into League, for the defence of Italie, did remunerate him with an Hallowed-Sword, and Cap-of-Maintenance sent by his Nuncio. Pope INNOCENT had done the like, but it was not receiued in that Glory. For the King appointed the Maior and his Brethren to meet the Popes Orator at London-Bridge, and all the Streets between the Bridge-foote and the Palace of Paules (where the King then lay) were garnished with the Citizens, standing in their Liueries. And the Morrow after (being All-hallowes day) the King, attended with many of his Prelates, Nobles, and Principall Courtiers, went in Procession to Paules, and the Cap and Sword were borne before him. And after the Procession, the King himselfe remaining seated in the Quire, the Lord Archbishop vpon the greece of the Quire, made a long Oration, setting forth the greatnesse and Eminencie of that Honour, which the Pope (in these Ornaments and Ensignes of Benediction) had done the King; and how rarely, and vpon what high deserts they vsed to bee bestowed. And then recited the Kings principall Acts and Merits, which had made him appeare worthy in the eyes of his Holinesse of this great Honour.
            
            All this while the Rebellion of Cornewall (whereof wee haue spoken) seemed to haue no relation to PERKIN; saue that perhaps PERKINS Proclamation had stricken vpon the right Veine, in promising to lay downe Exactions and Payments, and so had made them now and then haue a Kind-thought on PERKIN. But now these Bubbles by much stirring began to meete, as

they vse to doe vpon the top of Water. The Kings lenitie (by that time the Cornish Rebels, who were taken and pardoned, and (as it was said) manie of them sold by them that had taken them, for twelue pence and two shillings a-peece, were come downe into their Countrey) had rather imboldened them, than reclaymed them. Insomuch, as they stucke not to say to their Neighbours and Countrey-men, that The King did well to pardon them, for that hee knew hee should leaue few Subiects in England, if hee hanged all that were of their minde: And beganne whetting and inciting one another to renew the Commotion. Some of the subtilest of them, hearing of PERKINS being in Ireland, found meanes to send to him, to let him know, that if hee would come ouer to them, they would serue him.
            When PERKIN heard this Newes, hee beganne to take heart againe, and aduised vpon it with his Councell, which were principally three; HERNE a Mercer, that had fledde for Debt; SKELTON a Taylor, and ASTLEY a Scriuener: for, Secretarie FRION was gone. These told him, that hee was mightily ouerseene, both when hee went into Kent, and when hee went into Scotland: The one being a place so neare London, and vnder the Kings Nose; and the other, a Nation so distasted with the People of England, that if they had Ioued him neuer so well, yet they would neuer haue taken his part in that Companie. But if hee had beene so happie, as to haue beene in Cornewall at the first, when the People began to take Armes there, hee had beene crowned at Westminster before this time. For, these Kings (as hee had now experience) vvould sell poore Princes for shooes: But hee must relye wholly vpon People; and therefore aduised him to sayle ouer with all possible speede into Cornewall. Which, accordingly hee did; hauing in his Companie

foure small Barks, with some sixe score or seuen score fighting men. Hee arriued in September at Whitsand-Bay; and forthwith came to Bodmin, the Black-smiths Town: Where there assembled vnto him to the number of three thousand men of the rude People. There he set forth a new Proclamation, stroaking the People with faire Promises, and humouring them with Inuectiues against the King and his Gouernment. And, as it fareth with Smoke, that neuer loseth it selfe till it bee at the highest; hee did now before his end raise his Stile, intituling himself no more RICHARD, Duke of York; but RICHARD the Fourth, King of England. His Councell aduised him, by all meanes, to make himselfe Master of some good walled Towne; as well to make his Men finde the sweetnesse of rich Spoyles, and to allure to him all loose and lost People, by like hopes of Bootie; as to bee a sure Retrait to his Forces, in case they should haue any ill Day, or vnluckie Chance in the Field. Wherefore they tooke heart to them, and went on, and besieged the Citie of Excester, the principall Towne for Strength and Wealth in those Parts.
            When they were comne before Excester, they forbare to vse any Force at the first; but made continuall Shouts and Out-cries, to terrifie the Inhabitants. They did likewise in diuers places call and talke to them from vnder the Walls, to ioyne with them, and be of their Partie; telling them, that The King would make them another London, if they would bee the first Towne that should acknowledge him. But they had not the wit to send to them, in any orderly fashion, Agents or chosen Men, to tempt them, and to treat with them. The Citizens on their part shewed themselues stout and loyall Subiects. Neyther was there so much as any Tumult or Diuision amongst them: but all prepared themselues for a valiant Defence, and making

good the Towne. For, well they saw, that the Rebels were of no such Number or Power, that they needed to feare them as yet: and well they hoped, that before their Numbers encreased, the Kings Succours would come-in. And, howsoeuer, they thought it the extreamest of Euils, To put themselues at the mercy of those hungry and disorderly People. Wherefore, setting all things in good order within the Towne, they neuerthelesse let-downe with Cords, from seuerall parts of the Walls priuily, seuerall Messengers (that, if one came to mischance, another might passe-on) which should aduertise the King of the State of the Towne, and implore his aide. PERKIN also doubted, that Succours would come ere long; and therefore resolued to vse his vtmost Force to assault the Towne: And for that purpose, hauing mounted Scaling-Ladders in diuers places vpon the Walls, made at the same instant an Attempt to force one of the Gates. But, hauing no Artillery nor Engines, and finding that hee could doe no good by ramming with Logges of Timber, nor by the vse of Iron Barres and Iron Crowes, and such other meanes at hand, hee had no way left him, but to set one of the Gates on fire: which hee did. But the Citizens, well perceiuing the Danger, before the Gate could bee fully consumed, blocked vp the Gate, and some space about it on the inside, with Fagots and other Fuell: which they likewise set on fire, and so repulsed fire with fire; And, in the meane time, raised vp Rampiers of earth, and cast vp deep Trenches, to serue in stead of Wall and Gate. And for the Escaladaes, they had so bad successe, as the Rebels were driuen from the Wals, with the losse of two hundred men.
            The King, when hee heard of PERKINS Siege of Excester, made sport with it, and said to them that were about him, that The King of Rake-hells was landed in the West, and that hee hoped now to haue the honour
               
               to see him, which hee could neuer yet doe. And it appeared plainely to those that were about the King, that he was indeed much ioied with the newes of PERKINS being in English Ground, where hee could haue no retrait by Land; thinking now, that hee should bee cured of those priuie Stitches, which hee had long had about his Heart, and had sometimes broken his Sleeps in the middest of all his Felicitie. And, to set all mens hearts on fire, hee did by all possible meanes let it appeare, that those, who should now doe him seruice to make an end of these troubles, should bee no lesse accepted of him, than hee that came vpon the Eleuenth Houre, and had the whole Wages of the Day. Therefore now (like the end of a Play) a great number came vpon the Stage at once. He sent the Lord Chamberlaine, and the Lord BROOK, and Sir RICEAP THOMAS, with expedite Forces to speed to Excester, to the Rescue of the Towne, and to spread the Fame of his owne following in Person with a Royall Army. The Earle of Deuonshire, and his Son, with the CAROES, and the FVLFORDES, and other principall Persons of Deuonshire (vncalled from the Court, but hearing that the Kings heart was so much bent vpon this Seruice) made haste with Troupes, that they had raysed, to bee the first that should succour the Citie of Excester, and preuent the Kings Succours. The Duke of Buckingham likewise, with many braue Gentlemen, put themselues in Armes, not staying eyther the Kings or the Lord Chamberlaines comming on, but making a Bodie of Forces of themselues, the more to indeare their merit; signifying to the King their readinesse, and desiring to know his pleasure. So that according to the Prouerbe, In the comming downe, euerie Saint did helpe.
            
            PERKIN, hearing this Thunder of Armes, and Preparations against him from so many Parts, raised

his Siege, and marched to Taunton; beginning already to squint one eye vpon the Crowne, and another vpon the Sanctuarie: Though the Cornish-men were become, like Metall often fired and quenched, churlish, and that would sooner breake than bow; swearing and vowing not to leaue him, till the vttermost drop of their blood were spilt. Hee was at his rising from Excester betweene sixe and seuen thousand strong, many hauing come vnto him, after he was set before Excester, vpon fame of so great an Enterprise, and to partake of the Spoyle; Though vpon the raysing of his Siege, some did slippe away. When hee was come neare Taunton; hee dissembled all feare, and seemed all the day to vse diligence in preparing all things ready to fight. But about Midnight, hee fled with threescore Horse to Bewley in the New-Forrest, where hee and diuers of his Companie registred themselues Sanctuarie-men, leauing his Cornish-men to the Foure Windes; But yet thereby easing them of their Vow, and vsing his wonted Compassion, Not to bee by when his Subiects bloud should bee spilt. The King, as soone as he heard of PERKINS Flight, sent presently fiue hundred Horse to pursue and apprehend him, before hee should get either to the Sea, or to that same little Island, called a Sanctuary. But they came too late for the latter of these. Therefore all they could doe, was to beset the Sanctuary, and to maintaine a strong Watch about it, till the Kings pleasure were further knowne. As for the rest of the Rebels, they (beeing destituted of their head) without stroke stricken, submitted themselues vnto the Kings Mercie. And the King, who commonly drew Bloud (as Physitians doe) rather to saue life than to spill it, and was neuer Cruell when he was Secure; now he saw the Danger was past, pardoned them all in the end, except some few desperate persons which hee

reserued to bee executed, the better to set of his Mercie towards the rest. There were also sent with all speede some horse to Saint MICHAELS Mount in Cornwall, where the Ladie KATHERINE GORDON was left by her Husband, whom in all Fortunes shee entirely loued; adding the vertues of a Wife, to the vertues of her Sexe. The King sent in the greater diligence, not knowing whether she might be with Childe; whereby the businesse would not haue ended in PERKINS person. When shee was brought to the King, it was commonly said, that the King receiued her not onely with Compassion, but with Affection; Pitie giuing more Impression to her excellent Beautie. Wherefore comforting her (to serue as well his Eye, as his Fame) he sent her to his Queene, to remaine with her; giuing her very honourable Allowance for the support of her Estate: which shee enioyed both during the Kings life, and many yeares after. The name of the White-Rose (which had beene giuen to her Husbands False-Title) was continued in common speech to her true Beautie.
            
            The King went forwards on his Iourney, and made a ioyfull entrance into Excester, where hee gaue the Citizens great commendations and thankes: and taking the Sword hee wore, from his side, he gaue it to the Maior, and commanded it should bee euer after carried before him. There also hee caused to bee executed some of the Ring-leaders of the Cornish-men, in sacrifice to the Citizens, whom they had putin feare, and trouble. At Excester the King consulted with his Councell, whether he should offer life to PERKIN, if hee would quit the Sanctuarie, and voluntarily submit himselfe. The Councell were diuided in opinion. Some aduised the King to take him out of Sanctuary perforce, and to put him to death, as in a case of Necessity, which in it selfe dispenseth with Consecrated Places and

things. Wherein they doubted not also, but the King should find the Pope tractable to ratifie his Deed, either by Declaration, or (at least) by Indulgence. Others were of opinion (since all was now safe, and no further hurt could bee done) that it was not worth the exposing of the King to new Scandall and Enuy. A third sort fell vpon the opinion that it was not possible for the King euer, either to satisfie the world well touching the Imposture, or to learne out the bottome of the Conspiracie, except by promise of Life and Pardon, and other faire meanes, hee should get PERKIN into his hands. But they did all in their Preambles much bemone the Kings Case, with a kind of Indignation at his Fortune; That a Prince of his high Wisedome and Vertue, should haue beene so long, and so oft exercised and vexed with Idols. But the King said; that it was the Vexation of GOD Almightie himselfe, to be vexed with Idols, and therefore that that was not to trouble any of his Friends. And that for himselfe, hee alwayes despised them; but was grieued that they had put his People to such trouble and misery. But (in Conclusion) hee leaned to the third opinion, and so sent some to deale with PERKIN. Who seeing himselfe Prisoner, and destitute of all hopes, hauing tried Princes and People, Great and Small, and found all either false, faint, or vnfortunate, did gladly accept of the Condition. The King did also (while hee was at Excester) appoint the Lord DARCIE, and others, Commissioners, for the Fining of all such, as were of any value, and had any hand or partaking in the aide or comfort of PERKIN or the Cornish-men, either in the Field or in the Flight.
            
            These Commissioners proceeded with such strictnesse and seueritie, as did much obscure the Kings mercie in sparing of Bloud, with the bleeding of so much Treasure. PERKIN was brought vnto the Kings Court,

but not to the Kings presence; though the King (to satisfie his Curiositie) saw him sometimes out of a window, or in passage. Hee was in shew at libertie, but guarded with all care and watch that was possible, and willed to follow the King to London. But from his first appearance vpon the Stage, in his new person of a Sycophant or Iugler, in stead of his former Person of a Prince, all men may thinke how he was exposed to the derision, not onely of the Courtiers, but also of the Common-People, who flocked about him as hee went along; that one might know a farre off, where the Owle was, by the Flight of Birdes. Some mocking, some wondring, some cursing, some prying and picking matter out of his Countenance and Gesture, to talke of. So that the false Honour and Respects which hee had so long enioyed, was plentifully repaied in Scorne and Contempt. As soone as hee was come to London, the King gaue also the Citie the solace of this May-Game. For hee was conueighed leasurely on Horse-backe (but not in any ignominious fashion) through Cheape-side, and Cornwall, to the Tower; and from thence backe againe vnto Westminster, with the Churme of a thousand taunts and reproches. But to amend the Show, there followed a little distance of PERKIN, an inward Councellour of his, One that had beene Seruant Farrier to the King. This Fellow when PERKIN tooke Sanctuarie, chose rather to take an Holy-Habit, than an Holy-Place, and clad him selfe like an Hermite, and in that weede wandered about the Countrie, till hee was discouered, and taken. But this Man was bound hand and foote vpon the Horse, and came not backe with PERKIN, but was left at the Tower, and within few dayes after Executed. Soone after, now that PERKIN could tell better what himselfe was, he was diligently examined; and after his Confession taken, an Extract was made of such parts of them,

as were thought fit to be divulged, which was Printed and dispersed abroad. Wherein the King did himselfe no Right. For as there was a laboured Tale of particulars, of PERKINS Father, and Mother, and Grandsire, and Grand-mother, and Unckles, and Cosens, by Names and Sirnames, and from what places hee trauailed vp and downe; so there was little or nothing to purpose of any thing concerning his Designes, or any Practises that had beene held with him; nor the Duchesse of Burgundie her selfe (that all the World did take knowledge of, as the Person that had put Life and Beeing into the whole Businesse) so much as named or pointed at. So that men missing of that they looked for, looked about for they knew not what, and were in more doubt than before. But the King chose rather not to satisfie, than to kindle Coales. At that time also it did not appeare by any new Examinations or Commitments, that any other Person of qualitie was discouered or appeached, though the Kings closenesse made that a Doubt-Dormant.
            
            About this time, a great Fire in the night time sodainely began at the kings Pallace of Shyne, neare vnto the kings owne Lodgings, whereby a great part of the Building was consumed, with much costly Houshold-stuffe; which gaue the king occasion of Building from the ground that fine Pile of Richmond, which is now standing.
            Somewhat before this time also, there fell out a memorable Accident. There was one SEBASTIAN GABATO, a Venetian, dwelling in Bristow, a man seene and expert in Cosmographie and Nauigation. This Man seeing the successe, and emulating perhaps the enterprise of CHRISTOPHERVS COLVMBVS in that fortunate discouerie towards the Southwest, which had beene by him made some sixe yeares before; conceited with himselfe, that Lands
               
might likewise bee discouered towards the Northwest. And surely it may bee hee had more firme and pregnant Coniectures of it, than COLVMBVS had of this at the first. For the two great Islands of the Old and New world, beeing (in the shape and making of them) broad towards the North, and pointed towards the South; it is likely, that the discouerie first beganne where the Lands did nearest meet. And there had beene before that time a discouerie of some Lands, which they tooke to bee Islands, and were indeed the Continent of America, towards the Northwest. And it may bee, that some Relation of this nature comming afterwards to the knowledge of COLVMBVS, and by him suppressed, (desirous rather to make his Enterprise the Child of his Science and Fortune, than the Follower of a former Discouerie) did giue him better assurance, that all was not Sea, from the West of Europe and Africke vnto Asia, than either SENECA'S Prophesie, or PLATO'S Antiquities, or the Nature of the Tides, and Land-winds, and the like, which were the Coniectures that were giuen out, whereupon hee should haue relyed. Though I am not ignorant, that it was likewise laid vnto the casuall and windbeaten Discouerie (a little before) of a Spanish Pilot, who died in the house of COLVMBVS. But this GABATO bearing the King in hand, that hee would find out an Island endued with rich Commodities, procured him to man and victuall a Ship at Bristow, for the discouerie of that Island, With whom ventured also three small Shippes of London-Merchants, fraught with some grosse and sleight Wares, fit for Commerce with barbarous people. Hee sayled (as hee affirmed at his Returne, and made a Card thereof) very farre Westwards, with a Quarter of the North, on the North-side of Tierra de Labrador, vntill hee came to the Latitude of sixtie seuen Degrees and an halfe,

finding the Seas still open. It is certaine also, that the Kings Fortune had a tender of that great Empire of the West-Indies. Neither was it a Refusall on the kings part, but a Delay by accident, that put by so great an Acquest. For CHRISTOPHERVS COLVMBVS refused by the king of Portugall (who would not embrace at once both East and West) imployed his Brother BARTHOLOMEVS COLVMBVS vnto king HENRY, to negotiate for his Discouerie. And it so fortuned, that hee was taken by Pirats at Sea, by which accidentall impediment hee was longere hee came to the king. So long, that before hee had obtained a Capitulation with the King for his Brother, the Enterprise by him was atchieued, and so the West-Indies by Prouidence were then reserued for the Crowne of Castilia. Yet this sharpned the king so, that not onely in this Voyage, but againe in the sixteenth yeare of his Raigne, and likewise in the Eighteenth thereof, hee granted forth new Commissions, for the Discouerie and inuesting of vnknowne Lands.
            
            In this Fourteenth yeare also (by GODS wonderfull prouidence, that boweth things vnto his will, and hangeth great Weights vpon small Wyers) there fell out a trifling and vntoward Accident, that drew on great and happie effects. During the Truce with Scotland, there were certaine Scottish young Gentlemen, that came into Norham Towne, and there made merrie with some of the English of the Towne. And hauing little to doe, went sometimes forth, and would stand looking vpon the Castle. Some of the Garrison of the Castle, obseruing this their doing twice or thrice and hauing not their minds purged of the late ill bloud of Hostilitie, either suspected them, or quarrelled them for Spies. Whereupon they fell at ill Words, and from Words to Blowes; so that many were wounded of either side, and the Scottish-men (beeing

strangers in the Towne) had the worst. In so much as some of them were slaine, and the rest made haste home. The matter beeing complained on, and often debated before the Wardens of the Marches of both sides, and no good order taken, the King of Scotland tooke it to himselfe, and beeing much kindled, sent a Herald to the king to make protestation, That if Reparation were not done, according to the Conditions of the Truce, his king did denounce Warre. The king (who had often tryed Fortune, and was inclined to Peace) made answer; That what had been done, was vtterly against his will, and without his Priuitie. But if the Garrison-Souldiers had been in fault, he would see them punished, and the Truce in all points to bee preserued. But this answer seemed to the Scottish king but a Delay, to make the Complaint breathe out with time; and therefore it did rather exasperate him, than satisfie him. Bishop FOX, vnderstanding from the king, that the Scottish king was still discontent and impatient, beeing troubled that the occasion of breaking of the Truce should grow from his men, sent many humble and deprecatorie Letters to the Scottish King to appease him. Whereupon King IAMES, mollified by the Bishops submisse and eloquent Letters, wrote back vnto him; That though he were in part moued by his Letters, yet he should not bee fully satisfied, except hee spake with him; as well about the compounding of the present differences, as about other matters, that might concerne the good of both Kingdomes. The Bishop aduising first with the king, tooke his Iourney for Scotland. The meeting was at Melrosse, an Abbey of the Cestersians, where the king then abode. The king first roundly vttered vnto the Bishop his offence conceiued for the insolent Breach of Truce, by his men of Norham Castle. Whereunto Bishop FOX made such an humble and smooth answer, as it was like Oyle into

the wound, whereby it began to heale. And this was done in the presence of the King and his Councell. After, the King spake with the Bishop apart, and opened himselfe vnto him, saying; That these temporarie Truces and Peaces were soone made, and soone broken: But that hee desired a straiter Amitie with the King of England, discouering his mind; that if the King would giue him in Mariage, the Ladie MARGARET, his eldest Daughter, That indeede might bee a Knot indissoluble. That hee knew well what Place and Authoritie the Bishop deseruedly had with his Master. Therefore, if hee would take the businesse to heart, and deale in it effectually, hee doubted not but it would succeed well. The Bishop answered soberly, that hee thought himselfe rather happie, than worthy, to bee an Instrument in such a matter; but would doe his best endeauour. Wherefore the Bishop returning to the King, and giuing account what had passed, and finding the King more than well disposed in it, gaue the King aduice; first to proceed to a Conclusion of Peace, and then to goe on with the Treatie of Marriage, by degrees. Hereupon a Peace was concluded, which was published a little before Christmasse, in the Fourteenth yeare of the Kings Raigne, to continue for both the Kings liues, and the ouer-liuer of them, and a yeare after. In this Peace there was an Article contained, that no English-man should enter into Scotland, and no Scottish-man into England, without Letters Commendatorie from the Kings of eyther Nation. This at the first sight might seeme a meanes to continue a strangenesse betweene the Nations; but it was done, to locke in the Borderers.
            
            This yeare there was also borne to the King a third Sonne, who was christned by the name of EDMVND, and shortly after dyed. And much about the same time came newes of the death of Charles the French-King;
               
For whom there were celebrated Solemne and Princely Obsequies.
            
            It was not long, but PERKIN (who was made of Quick-siluer, which is hard to hold or imprison) began to stirre. For deceiuing his Keepers, hee tooke him to his heeles, and made speede to the Sea-coasts. But presently all Corners were laid for him, and such diligent pursuit and search made, as hee was faine to turne backe, and get him to the House of Bethleem, called the Priorie of Shyne, (which had the priuiledge of Sanctuarie) and put himselfe into the hands of the Prior of that Monasterie. The Prior was thought an Holy Man, and much reuerenced in those dayes. Hee came to the King, and besought the King for PERKINS life only, leauing him otherwise to the Kings discretion. Many about the King were againe more hot than euer, to haue the King to take him forth, and hang him. But the King (that had an high stomacke, and could not hato any that hee despised) bid, Take him forth, and set the Knaue in the Sockes. And so promising the Prior his life, hee caused him to bee brought forth. And within two or three daies after, vpon a Scaffold, set vp in the Palace-Court at Westminster, he was fettered and set in the Stockes, for the whole day. And the next day after, the like was done by him at the Crosse in Cheape-side, and in both places he read his Confession, of which we made mention before; and was from Cheap-side conueighed and layed vp in the Tower. Notwithstanding all this, the King was (as was partly touched before) growne to be such a Partner with Fortune, as no body could tell what Actions the One, and what the Other owned. For it was beleeued generally, that PERKIN was betrayed, and that this Escape was not without the Kings priuitie, who had him all the time of his Flight in a Line; and that the King did this, to picke a Quarrell to him to put him to death, and to be ridde

of him at once. But this is not probable. For that the same Instruments who obserued him in his Flight, might haue kept him from getting into Sanctuary.
            
            But it was ordained, that this Winding-Iuie of a PLANTAGENET, should kill the true Tree it selfe. For PERKIN, after hee had beene a while in the Tower, began to insinuate himselfe into the fauour and kindnesse of his Keepers, Seruants to the Lieutenant of the Tower, Sir IOHN DIGBIE, being foure in number; STRANGVVAIES, BLEVVET, ASTVVOOD, and LONG-ROGER. These Varlets, with mountaines of promises, hee sought to corrupt, to obtaine his Escape. But knowing well, that his owne Fortunes were made so contemptible, as hee could feede no mans Hopes (and by Hopes hee must worke, for Rewards he had none) he had contriued with himselfe a vast and tragicall Plot; which was, to draw into his Companie EDVVARD PLANTAGENET Earle of Warwicke, then Prisoner in the Tower; whom the wearie life of a long Imprisonment, and the often and renewing Feares of being put to Death, had softned to take any impression of Councell for his Libertie. This young Prince hee thought these Seruants would looke vpon, though not vpon himselfe. And therefore after that by some Message by one or two of them, hee had tasted of the Earles Consent; it was agreed, that these foure should murder their Master the Lieutenant, secretly in the night, and make their best of such Money and portable Goods of his, as they should finde readie at hand, and get the Keyes of the Tower, and presently let forth PERKIN and the Earle. But this Conspiracie was reuealed in time, before it could bee executed. And in this againe the Opinion of the Kings great Wisedome did surcharge him with a sinister Fame, that PERKIN was but his Bait, to entrap the Earle of Warwicke. And in the very Instant while

this Conspiracy was in working (as if that also had been the Kings industrie) it was fatall, that there should breake forth a Connuerfeit Earle of Warwicke, a Cordwainers Sonne, whose name was RALPH WILFORD; a young man, taught and set on by an Augustine Friar, called PATRICKE. They both from the parts of Suffolke, came forwards into Kent, where they did not onely priuily and vnderhand giue out, that this WILFORD was the true Earle of Warwicke, but also the Friar finding some light Credence in the People, tooke the boldnesse in the Pulpit to declare as much, and to incite the People to come in to his Aide. Whereupon they were both presently apprehended, and the young Fellow executed, and the Friar condemned to perpetuall Imprisonment. This also hapning so opportunely, to represent the danger to the Kings Estate, from the Earle of Warwicke, and thereby to colour the Kings seueritie that followed; together with the madnesse of the Friar, so vainely and desperately to divulge a Treason, before it had gotten any manner of strength; and the sauing of the Friars life, which neuerthelesse was (indeed) but the priuiledge of his Order; and the Pitie in the Common People (which if it runne in a strong Streame, doth euer cast vp Scandal and Enuie) made it generally rather talked, than belieued, that all was but the Kings deuice. But howsoeuer it were, hereupon PERKIN (that had offended against Grace now the third time) was at the last proceeded with, and by Commissioners of Oyer and Determiner, arraigned at Westminster, vpon diuers Treasons committed and perpetrated after his comming on land within this Kingdome (for so the Iudges aduised, for that he was a Forreiner) and condemned, and a few dayes after executed at Tiburne. Where hee did againe openly read his Comfession, and take it vpon his Death to bee true. This was the end of this little Cockatrice
               
of a King, that was able to destroy those that did not espie him first. It was one of the longest Playes of that kind, that hath beene in memorie; and might perhaps haue had another end, if hee had not met with a King both wise, stout, and fortunate.
            As for PERKINS three Councellors, they had registred themselues Sanctuarie-men when their Master did. And whether vpon pardon obtained, or continuance within the Priuiledge, they came not to bee proceeded with.
            There was executed with PERKIN the Maior of Corke, and his Sonne, who had beene principall Abettors of his Treasons. And soone after were likewise condemned eight other Persons, about the Tower-Conspiracie, whereof foure were the Lieutenants men. But of those Eight but two were executed. And immediatly after was arraigned before the Earle of Oxford (then for the time High-Steward of England) the poore Prince the Earle of Warwicke; not for the Attempt to escape simply (for that was not acted; And besides, the Imprisonment not beeing for Treason, the Escape by Law could not bee Treason) But for conspiring with PERKIN to raise sedition, and to destroy the King. And the Earle confessing the Inditement had Iudgement, and was shortly after beheaded on Tower-hill.
            
            This was also the end not onely of this Noble and Commiserable Person EDVVARD the Earle of Warwicke, eldest Sonne to the Duke of Clarence, but likewise of the Line-Male of the PLANTAGENETS, which had flourished in great Royaltie and Renowne, from the time of the famous King of England King HENRIE the Second. Howbeit it was a Race often dipped in their owne Bloud. It hath remained since onely transplanted into other Names, as well of the Imperiall Line, as of other Noble Houses. But it was

neither guilt of Crime, nor reason of State, that could quench the Enuie that was vpon the King for this Execution. So that hee thought good to export it out of the Land, and to lay it vpon his new Allie FERDINANDO King of Spaine. For these two Kings vnderstanding one another at halfe a word, so it was that there were Letters shewed out of Spaine, whereby in the passages concerning the Treatie of the Marriage, FERDINANDO had written to the King in plaine termes, that hee saw no assurance of his Succession, as long as the Earle of Warwicke liued; and that hee was loth to send his Daughter to Troubles and Dangers. But hereby, as the king did in some part remoue the Enuie from himselfe; so hee did not obserue, that hee did withall bring a kind of Malediction and Infausting vpon the Marriage, as an ill Prognosticke. Which in euent so farre proued true, as both Prince ARTHVR enioyed a verie small time after the Marriage, and the Ladie KATHERINE, her selfe (a sad and a religious woman) long after, when King HENRIE the Eight his resolution of a Diuorce from her was first made knowne to her, vsed some words; That shee had not offended: but it was a Iudgment of GOD, for that her former Marriage was made in bloud; meaning that of the Erale of Warwicke
            
            This fifteenth yeare of the king there was a great Plague, both in London and in diuers parts of the Kingdome. Wherefore the king after often change of Places (whether to auoide the danger of the Sickenesse or to giue occasion of an Enteruiew with the Arch-Duke, or both) sayled ouer with his Queene to Calice. Vpon his comming thither, the Arch-Duke sent an honourable Ambassage vnto him, aswell to welcome him into those parts, as to let him know, that (if it pleased him) hee would come and doe him reuerence. But it was said withall; That the King might bee pleased to

appoint some place, that were out of any Walled Towne or Fortresse, for that hee had denied the same vpon like occasion to the French king. And though hee said, he made a great difference betweene the two kings, yet hee would bee loth to giue a President, that might make it after to bee expected at his hands, by another whom hee trusted lesse. The king accepted of the Courtesie, and admitted of his Excuse, and appointed the place to be at Saint PETERS Church without Calice. But withall hee did visit the Arch-Duke with Ambassadors sent from himselfe, which were the Lord Saint IOHN, and the Secretarie; vnto whom the Arch-Duke did the honour, as (going to Masse at Saint Omers) to set the Lord Saint IOHN on his right hand, and the Secretarie on his left, and so to ride betweene them to Church The day appointed for the Enteruiew, the king went on Horse backe some distance from Saint PETERS Church, to receiue the Arch-Duke. And vpon their approaching, the Arch-Duke made hast to light, and offered to hold the kings Stirrope at his alighting; which the king would not permit, but descending from Horse backe, they embraced with great affection, and withdrawing into the Church to a place prepared, they had long Conference, not onely vpon the Confirmation of former Treaties, and the freeing of Commerce, but vpon Crosse Marriages, to bee had betweene the Duke of Yorke the Kings second Sonne, and the Arch-Dukes Daughter; And againe betweene CHARLES the Arch-Dukes Sonne and Heire, and MARIE the Kings second Daughter. But these Blossoms of vnripe Marriages, were but friendly wishes, &amp; the Aires of louing Entertainement; though one of them came afterwards to Conclusion in Treatie, though not in Effect. But during the time that the two Princes conuersed and communed together in the Suburbs of Calice, the Demonstrations

on both sides were passing heartie and affectionate, especially on the part of the Arch-Duke. Who (besides that hee was a Prince of an excellent good nature) beeing conscious to himselfe, how driely the King had beene vsed by his Councell in the matter of PERKIN, did striue by all meanes to recouer it in the Kings Affection. And hauing also his eares continually beaten with the Councels of his Father and Father-in-law, who (in respect of their iealous hatred against the French King) did alwayes aduise the Arch-Duke to anchor himselfe vpon the Amitie of King HENRY of England; was glad vpon this occasion, to put in vre and practice their precepts, calling the King Patron, and Father, and Protector, (These very words the King repeates; when he certified of the louing behauiour of the Arch-Duke to the Citie) and what else hee could deuise, to expresse his loue and obseruance to the King. There came also to the King the Gouernour of Picardie, and the Bailiffe of Amiens, sent from Lewis the French King to doe him honour, and to giue him knowledge of his victorie and winning of the Duchie of Millan. It seemeth the king was well pleased with the honours hee receiued from those parts, while hee was at Calice. For hee did himselfe certifie all the Newes and Occurrents of them in euerie particular, from Calice, to the Maior and Aldermen of London, which (no doubt) made no small talke in the Citie. For the King, though hee could not entertaine the good will of the Citizens, as EDVVARD the fourth did; yet by affabilitie and other Princely Graces, did euer make very much of them, and apply himselfe to them.
            This yeare also did IOHN MORTON, Arch-Bishop of Canterburie, Chancellor of England, and Cardinall. He was a Wise man, and an Eloquent, but in his nature harsh, and haughtie; much accepted by the King, but enuied by the Nobilitie, and hated of the

               People. Neither was his name left out of PERKINS Proclamation for any good will, but they would not bring him in amongst the Kings Casting-Counters, because hee had the Image and Superscription vpon him of the Pope, in his Honour of Cardinall. Hee wanne the King with Secrecie and Diligence, but chiefly because hee was his olde Seruant in his lesse Fortunes: And also for that (in his affections) hee was not without an inueterate malice against the House of YORKE, vnder whom hee had beene in trouble. He was willing also to take Enuie from the King, more than the King was willing to put vpon him. For the King cared not for Subterfuges, but would stand Enuy, and appeare in any thing that was to his mind; which made Enuie still grow vpon him more vniuersall, but lesse daring. But in the matter of Exactions, time did after shew, that the Bishop in feeding the Kings humour, did rather temper it. He had beene by RICHARD the third committed (as in Custody) to the Duke of Buckingham, whom hee did secretly incite to reuolt from King RICHARD. But after the Duke was engaged, and thought the Bishop should haue beene his chiefe Pilot in the Tempest, the Bishop was gotten into the Cockeboat, and fled ouer beyond Seas. But whatsoeuer else was in the Man, hee deserueth a most happie Memorie, in that hee was the principall Meane of ioyning the two Roses. Hee died of great yeares, but of strong health and Powers.
            
            The next yeare, which was the Sixteenth yeare of the King, and the yeare of our Lord one thousand fiue hundred, was the yeare of Iubile at Rome. But Pope ALEXANDER, to saue the Hazzard and Charges of mens Iourneys to Rome, thought good to make ouer those Graces by Exchange, to such as would pay a conuenient Rate, seeing they could not come to fetch them. For which purpose was sent into England
               
IASPER PONS, a Spaniard, the Popes Commissioner, better chosen than were the Commissioners of Pope LEO, afterwards imployed for Germanie; for hee carried the Businesse with great wisedome, and semblance of Holinesse. In so much as hee leuied great summes of Money within this Land to the Popes vse, with little or no Scandall. It was thought the King shared in the Money. But it appeareth by a Letter which Cardinall ADRIAN, the Kings Pensioner, wrote to the King from Rome some few yeares after, that this was not so. For this Cardinall, beeing to perswade Pope IVLIVS on the Kings behalfe, to expedite the Bull of Dispensation for the Marriage betweene Prince HENRIE and the Ladie KATHERINE, finding the Pope difficile in granting thereof, doth vse it as a principall Argument concerning the Kings merit towards that Sea, that hee had touched none of those Deniers, which had beene leuied by PONS in England. But that it might the better appeare (for the satisfaction of the Common people) that this was Consecrate Money, the same Nuntio brought vnto the King a Briefe from the Pope; wherein the King was exhorted and summoned to come in Person against the Turke. For that the Pope (out of the care of an Uniuersall Father) seeing almost vnder his eyes the Successes and Progresses of that great Enemie of the Faith, had had in the Conclane, and with the Assistance of the Ambassadours of forraine Princes, diuers Consultations about an Holy Warre, and a Generall Expedition of Christian Princes against the Turke. Wherein it was agreed, and thought fit, that the Hungarians, Polonians, and 
                  
                     ••••
                  nians should make a Warre vpon Thracid; The French and Spaniards vpon Grecia; and that the Pope (willing to sacrifice himselfe in so good a Cause) in Person and in Companie of the King of England, the Venetians, and such other States as were great in maritime


Power, would saile with a puissant Nauie through the Mediterrane vnto Constantinople. And that to this end, his Holinesse had sent Nuncio's to all Christian Princes; Aswell for a Cessation of all Quarrels and Differences amongst themselues, as for speedie Preparations and Contributions of Forces and Treasure for this Sacred Enterprize.
            
            To this the King, (who vnderstood well the Court of Rome) made an Answer rather Solemne, than Serious. Signifying,
            
               THat no Prince on Earth should bee more forward and obedient, both by his Person, and by all his possible Forces, and Fortunes, to enter into this sacred VVarre, than himselfe. But that the distance of Place was such, as no Forces that hee should raise for the Seas, could be leuied or prepared, but with double the charge, and double the time (at the least) that they might be from the other Princes, that had their Territories nearer adioyning. Besides, that neither the manner of his Ships (hauing no Gallies) nor the Experience of his Pilots and Mariners could bee so apt for those Seas, as theirs. And therefore that his Holinesse might doe well, to mooue one of those other Kings, who lay fitter for the purpose, to accompany him by Sea. Whereby both all things would be sooner put in readinesse, and with lesse Charge, and the Emulation and Diuision of Command, which
               
               might growe betweene those Kings of France and Spaine, if they should both ioyne in the VVarre by Land vpon Grecia, might bee wisely auoyded. And that for his part, hee would not bee wanting in Aydes and Contribution. Yet notwithstanding, if both these Kings should refuse, rather than his Holinesse should goe alone, hee would waite vpon him, as soone as hee could bee readie. Alwaies prouided, that hee might first see all Differences of the Christian Princes amongst themselues, fully laide downe and appeased (as for his owne part hee was in none.) And that hee might haue some good Townes vpon the Coast in Italie put into his hands, for the Retrait and safeguard of his Men.
            
            With this Answer IASPER PONS returned, nothing at all discontented. And yet this Declaration of the King (as superficiall as it was) gaue him that Reputation abroad, as hee was not long after elected by the Knights of the Rhodes, Protector of their Order; All things multiplying to Honour in a Prince, that had gotten such high Estimation for his Wisedome and Sufficiencie.
            
            There were these two last yeares some proceedings against Her etiques, which was rare in this Kings Reigne, and rather by Penances, than by Fire. The King had (though hee were no good Schooleman) the Honour to conuert one of them by Dispute at Canterburie.
            
            
               
This yeare also, though the king were no more haunted with Sprites, for that by the Sprinckling partly of Bloud, and partly of Water, hee had chased them away; yet neuerthelesse hee had certaine Apparitions, that troubled him, still shewing themselues from one Region, which was the house of Yorke. It came so to passe, that the Earle of Suffolke, Sonne to ELIZABETH, eldest Sister to king EDVVARD the fourth, by IOHN Duke of Suffolke, her second Husband, and Brother to IOHN Earle of Lincolne, that was slaine at Stocke-field, being of an hastie and Cholericke Disposition, had killed a man in his furie; whereupon the king gaue him his Pardon. But either willing to leaue a Cloud vpon him, or the better to make him feele his Grace, produced him openly to plead his Pardon. This wrought in the Earle, as in a haughtie stomacke it vseth to doe; for the Ignominie printed deeper than the Grace. Wherefore hee beeing discontent, fled secretly into Flanders, vnto his Aunt the Duchesse of Burgundie. The king startled at it. But being taught by Troubles, to vse fare and timely Remedies, wrought so with him by Messages, (The Ladie MARGARET also growing by often failing in her Alchymie, wearie of her Experiments, and partly being a little sweetned, for that the king had not touched her name in the Confession of PERKIN) that hee came ouer againe vpon good termes, and was reconciled to the king.
            In the beginning of the next yeare, beeing the seuenteenth of the king, the Ladie KATHERINE, fourth Daughter of FERDINANDO and ISABELLA, King and Queene of Spaine, arriued in England, at Plimouth, the second of October and was married to Prince ARTHVR in PAVLES, the foureteenth of Nouember following. The Prince being then about fifteene yeares of age, and the Ladie about eighteene. The manner of her receiuing, the manner

of her Entrie into London, and the Celebritie of the Marriage were performed with great and true Magnificence, in regard of Cost, Shew, and Order. The chiefe man that tooke the care was Bishop Fox; who was not onely a graue Councellor for Warre or Peace, but also a good Surueyour of Workes, and a good Master of Ceremonies, and any thing else that was fit for the Actiue part, belonging to the seruice of Court, or State of a great King. This Marriage was almost seuen yeares in Treatie; which was in part caused by the tender yeares of the Marriage-couple, especially of the Prince. But the true reason was, that these two Princes, being Princes of great Policie and profound Iudgement, stood a great time looking one vpon anothers Fortunes, how they would goe; knowing well that in the meane time, the verie Treatie it selfe gaue abroad in the World a Reputation of a straite Coniunction, and Amitie betweene them; which serued on both sides to many purposes, that their seuerall Affaires required, and yet they continued still free. But in the end when the Fortunes of both the Princes did grow euerie day more and more prosperous and assured, and that looking all about them, they saw no better Conditions, they shut it vp.
            The Marriage Monie the Princesse brought (which was turned ouer to the King by Act of Renunciation) was two hundred thousand Ducats Whereof one hundred thousand were payable ten dayes after the Solemnization, and the other hundred thousand at two payments Annuall; but part of it to bee in Iewels and Plate, and a due course set downe to haue them iustly and indifferently prized. The Ioynture or Aduancement of the Lady, was the third part of the Principality of Wales, and of the Dukedome of Cornewall, and of the Earledome of Chester; to be after set forth in seueraltie. And in case shee came to bee Queeene of England, her Aduancement
               
was left indefinite, but thus; That it should bee as great, as euer any former Queene of England had.
            In all the Deuises and Conceits of the Triumphs of this Marriage, there was a great deale of Astronomie. The Ladie beeing resembled to HESPERVS, and the Prince to ARCTVRVS, and the old King ALPHONSVS (that was the greatest Astronomer of Kings, and was Ancestor to the Ladie) was brought in to bee the Fortune-teller of the Match. And whosoeuer had those Toyes in Compiling, they were not altogether Pedanticall. But you may bee sure that King ARTHVR, the Britton, and the descent of the Ladie KATHERINE from the House of LANCASTER, was in no wise forgotten. But (as it should seem) it is not good to fetch Fortunes from the Starres. For this young Prince (that drew vpon him at that time, not onely the Hopes and Affections of his Countrie, but the Eyes and Expectation of Forreiners) after a few Moneths, in the beginning of Aprill, deceased at Ludlow Castle, where he was sent to keepe his Resiance and Court, as Prince of Wales. Of this Prince, in respect hee died so young, and by reason of his Fathers manner of Education, that did cast no great Lustre vpon his Children, there is little particular Memorie. Onely thus much remaineth, that hee was very studious and learned, beyond his yeares, and beyond the Custome of great Princes.
            
            There was a Doubt ripped vp in the times following, when the Diuorce of King HENRIE the Eighth from the Ladie KATHERINE did so much busie the world, whether ARTHVR was bedded with his Ladie or no, whereby that matter in fact (of Carnall Knowledge) might bee made part of the Case. And it is true, that the Ladie her selfe denied it, or atleast her Counsell stood vpon it, and would not blaunch that

Aduantage, although the Plenitude of the Popes power of Dispensing was the maine Question. And this Doubt was kept long open, in respect of the two Queenes that succeeded MARIE and ELIZABETH, whose Legitimations were incompatible one with another, though their Succession was settled by Act of Parliament. And the times that fauoured Queene MARIES Legitimation would haue it beleeued, that there was no Carnall Knowledge betweene ARTHVR and KATHERINE. Not that they would seeme to derogate from the Popes absolute power, to dispence euen in that Case; but onely in point of honour, and to make the Case more fauourable and smooth. And the Times that fauoured Queene ELIZABETHS Legitimation (which were the longer, and the latter) maintained the contrarie. So much there remayneth in Memorie, that it was halfe a yeares time betweene the Creation of HENRY Prince of Wales, and Prince ARTHVRS death; which was construed to bee, for to expect a full time, whereby it might appeare, whether the Ladie KATHERINE were with Child by Prince ARTHVR, or no. Againe, the Ladie her selfe procured a Bull, for the better Corroboration of the Marriage, with a Clause of (vel forsan cognitam) which was not in the first Bull. There was giuen in Euidence also, when the cause of the Diuorce was handled, a pleasant passage, which was; That in a Morning Prince ARTHVR, vpon his vp-rising from Bed with her, called for drinke, which hee was not accustomed to doe, and finding the Gentleman of his Chamber that brought him the drinke to smile at it, and to note it, hee said merrily to him; That hee had been in the middest of Spaine, which was an hot Region, and his Iourney had made him drie, and that if the other had beene in so hot a Clime, hee would haue been drier than hee. Besides, the Prince was

vpon the point of Sixteene yeares of Age when hee died, and forward, and able in Bodie.
            The Februarie following, HENRY Duke of Yorke was created Prince of Wales, and Earle of Chester and Flint. For the Dukedome of Cornewall deuolued to him by Statute. The King also beeing fast handed, and loath to part with a second Dowrie, but chiefly being affectionate both by his Nature, and out of Politicke Considerations to continue the Alliance with Spaine, preuailed with the Prince (though not without some Reluctation, such as could bee in those yeares, for hee was not twelue yeares of Age) to bee contracted with the Princesse KATHERINE. The secret Prouidence of GOD ordaining that Marriage, to bee the Occasion of great Euents and Changes.
            The same yeare were the Espousals of IAMES King of Scotland, with the Ladie MARGARET, the Kings eldest Daughter; which was done by Proxie, and published at PAVLES Crosse, the fiue and twentieth of Ianuarie, and Te Deum solemnly sung. But certaine it is, that the Ioy of the Citie thereupon shewed, by Ringing of Bells, and Bon-fires, and such other Incence of the People, was more than could be expected, in a Case of so great and fresh Enmitie betweene the Nations; especially in London, which was farre enough off from feeling any of the former calamities of the Warre. And therefore might bee truely attributed to a Secret Instinct and Inspiring (which many times runneth not onely in the Hearts of Princes, but in the Pulse and Veines of People) touching the happinesse thereby to ensue in time to come. This Marriage was in August following consummate at Edenborough. The King bringing his Daughter as farre as Colli-Weston on the way, and then consigning her to the Attendance of the Earle of Northumberland; who with

a great Troupe of Lords and Ladies of Honour, brought her into Scotland, to the King her Husband.
            This Marriage had beene in Treatie by the space of almost three yeares, from the time that the King of Scotland did first open his mind to Bishop FOX. The Summe giuen in Marriage by the King, was ten Thousand pounds. And the Iointure and Aduancement assured by the King of Scotland, was two Thousand pounds a yeare, after King IAMES his Death, and one Thousand pounds a yeare in present, for the Ladies Allowance or Maintenance. This to be set forth in Lands, of the best and most certaine Reuenue. During the Treatie, it is reported, that the King remitted the matter to his Counsell; And that some of the Table in the Freedome of Counsellors (the King beeing present) did put the Case; that if GOD should take the Kings two Sonnes without Issue, that then the Kingdome of England would fall to the King of Scotland, which might preiudice the Monarchie of England. Whereunto the King himselfe replied; That if that should bee, Scotland would bee but an Accession to England, and not England to Scotland, for that the Greater would draw the lesse. And that it was a safer Vnion for England, than that of France. This passed as an Oracle, and silenced those that moued the Question.
            
            The same yeare was fatall, as well for Deaths, as Marriages, and that with equall temper. For the Ioyes and Feasts of the two Marriages, were compensed with the Mournings, and Funerals of Prince ARTHVR (of whom wee haue spoken) and of Queene ELIZABETH, who died in Child-bed in the Tower, and the Child liued not long after. There dyed also that yeare Sir REGINOLD BRAY, who was noted to haue had with the King the greatest Freedome of any Counsellor; but it was but a Freedome, the better to set off

               Flatterie. Yet hee bare more than his iust part of Enuie, for the Exactions.
            
            At this time the Kings Estate was verie prosperous, Secured by the Amitie of Scotland, strengthened by that of Spaine, cherished by that of Burgundie, all Domesticke Troubles quenched, and all Noyse of Warre (like a Thunder afarre off) going vpon Italie. Wherefore Nature, which many times is happily contayned, and refrained by some Bands of Fortune, beganne to take place in the King; carrying (as with a strong Tide) his affections and Thoughts vnto the gathering and heaping vp of Treasure. And as Kings doe more easily find Instruments for their Will and Humour, than for their Seruice and Honour; Hee had gotten for his purpose, or beyond his purpose, two Instruments, EMPSON and DVDLEY, (whom the people esteemed as his Horse-Leeches and Shearers) bold men, and carelesse of Fame, and that tooke Toll of their Masters Grist. DVDLEY was of a good Family, Eloquent, and one that could put Hatefull Businesse into good Language. But EMPSON, that was the Sonne of a Sieue-maker, triumphed alwayes vpon the Deede done, putting off all other respects whatsoeuer. These two Persons beeing Lawyers in Science, and Priuie Councellors in Authoritie (as the Corruption of the best things is the worst) turned Law and Iustice into Worme-wood and Rapine. For first, their manner was to cause diuers Subiects to bee indicted of sundrie Crimes, and so farre forth to proceed in forme of Law; But when the Bils were found, then presently to commit them. And neuerthelesse not to produce them to any reasonable time to their Answer, but to suffer them to languish long in Prison, and by sundrie artificiall Deuices and Terrours, to extort from them great Fines and Ransomes, which they termed Compositions and Mitigations.
            
            
               
Neither did they (towards the end) obserue so much as the Halfe-face of Iustice, in proceeding by Indictment; but sent forth their Precepts to attache men, and conuent them before themselues and some others, at their priuate Houses, in a Court of Commission, and there vsed to shuffle vp a Summarie Proceeding by Examination, without Tryall of Iurie; assuming to themselues there, to deale both in Pleas of the Crowne, and Controuersies Ciuill.
            
            Then did they also vse to enthrall and charge the Subiects Lands with Tenures in Capite, by finding False Offices, and thereby to worke vpon them for Ward-ships, Liueries, Primier Seisines, and Alienations, (being the fruites of those Tenures) refusing vpon diuers Pretexts and Delayes, to admit men to trauerse those False Offices, according to the Law. Nay, the Kings Wards after they had accomplished their full Age, could not bee suffered to haue Liuerie of their Lands, without paying excessiue Fines, farre exceeding all reasonable Rates. They did also vexe men with Informations of Intrusion vpon scarce colourable Titles.
            
            VVhen men were Out-lawed in Personall Actions, they would not permit them to purchase their Charters of Pardon, except they paid great and intolerable summes; standing vpon the strict Point of Law, which vpon Out-lawries giueth Forfeiture of Goods. Nay, contrarie to all Law and Colour, they maintained, the King ought to haue the halfe of mens Lands and Rents, during the space of full two yeares, for a Paine in Case of Out-lawrie. They would also ruffle with Iurors, and inforce them to finde as they would direct, and (if they did not) Conuent them, Imprison them, and Fine them.
            These and many other Courses, fitter to be buried than repeated, they had of Preying vpon the People; both like Tame Hawkes for their Master, and like Wild
               
               Hawkes for themselues; in so much as they grew to great Riches and Substance. But their principall working was vpon Penall Lawes, wherein they spared none, great nor small; nor considered whether the Law were possible, or impossible, in Vse or Obsolete. But raked ouer all old and new Statutes, though many of them were made with intention rather of Terrour, than of Rigour; hauing euer a Rabble of Promoters, Questmongers, and leading Iurors at their Command, so as they could haue any thing found either for Fact, or Valuation.
            
            There remayneth to this Day a Report, that the King was on a time entertained by the Earle of Oxford (that was his principall Seruant, both for Warre and Peace) nobly and sumptuously, at his Castle at Henningham. And at the Kings going away, the Earles Seruants stood (in a seemely manner) in their Liuerie Coats, with Cognisances, ranged on both sides, and made the King a Lane. The King called the Earle to him, and said; My Lord, I have heard much of your Hospitalitie, but I see it is greater than the speech. These handsome Gentlemen and Teomen, which I see on both sides of me, are sure your Meniall Seruants. The Earle smiled, and said; It may please your Grace, that were not for mine ease. They are most of them my Retainers, that are come to doe me seruice at such a time as this, and chiefly to see your Grace. The King started a little, and said; By my faith (my Lord) I thanke you for my good Cheare, but I may not endure to haue my Lawes broken in my sight. My Atturney must speake with you. And it is part of the Report, that the Earle compounded for no lesse than fifteene thousand Markes. And to shew further the kings extreme Diligence; I doe remember to haue seene long since a Booke of Accompt of EMPSONS, that had the kings hand almost to euery Leafe, by way of Signing, and was in some places Postilled in the

               Margent with the Kings hand likewise, where was this Remembrance.
            
            Item, receiued of such a one, fiue Markes, for the Pardon to be procured; and if the Pardon doe not passe, the Monie to bee repaied; Except the Partie bee some other-wayes satisfied.
            
            And ouer against this Memorandum (of the Kings owne hand)
            
               Otherwise satisfied.
            
            Which I doe the rather mention, because it shewes in the king a Nearenesse, but yet with a kind of Iustnesse. So these little Sands and Graines of Gold and Siluer (as it seemeth) helped not a little to make vp the great Heape and Banke.
            
            But meanewhile (to keepe the king awake) the Earle of Suffolke hauing beene too gay at Prince ARTHVRS Marriage, and sunke himselfe deepe in Debt, had yet once more a mind to bee a Knight-Errant, and to seeke Aduentures in Forraine parts. And taking his Brother with him, fled againe into Flanders. That (no doubt) which gaue him Confidence, was the great Murmur of the People against the Kings Gouernement. And beeing a Man of a light and rash Spirit, he thought euerie Vapour would bee a Tempest. Neither wanted hee some Partie within the Kingdome. For the Murmur of People awakes the Discontents of Nobles, and againe, that calleth vp commonly some Head of Sedition. The King resorting to his wonted and tried Arts, caused Sir ROBERT CVRSON, Captaine of the Castle at Hammes (beeing at that time beyond Sea, and therefore lesse likely to bee wrought vpon by the king) to flie from his Charge, and to faine himselfe a seruant of

the Earles. This Knight, hauing insinuated himselfe into the Secrets of the Earle, and finding by him vpon whom chiefly hee had either Hope or Hold, aduertised the King thereof in great secrecie. But neuerthelesse maintained his owne Credit and inward trust with the Earle. Vpon whose Aduertisements, the King attached WILLIAM COVRTNEY, Earle of Deuonshire, his Brother-in-Law, married to the Ladie KATHERINE, daughter to King EDVVARD the Fourth; WILLIAM DE-LA-POLE, Brother to the Earle of Suffolke; Sir IAMES TIRREL, and Sir IOHN WINDHAM, and some other meaner Persons, and committed them to Custodie. GEORGE, Lord ABERGAVENNIE, and Sir THOMAS GREENE, were at the same time apprehended; but as vpon lesse Suspition, so in a freer Restraint, and were soone after deliuered. The Earle of Deuonshire, being interessed in the bloud of Yorke, that was rather Feared than Nocent; yet as One, that might bee the Obiect of others Plots and Designes, remained Prisoner in the Tower, during the Kings life. WILLIAAM DE-LA-POLE, was also long restrained, though not so straitly. But for Sir IAMES TIRREL (against whom the Bloud of rhe Innocent Princes, EDVVARD the Fifth, and his Brother, did still crie from vnder the Altar) and Sir IOHN WINDHAM, and the other meaner ones, they were attainted and executed; The two Knights beheaded. Neuerthelesse, to confirme the Credit of CVRSON (who belike had not yet done all his Feates of Actiuitie) there was published at PAVLES Crosse, about the time of the said Executions, the Popes Bull of Excommunication and Curse, against the Earle of Suffolke, and Sir ROBERT CVRSON, &amp; some others by name, and likewise in generall against all the Abettors of the said Earle. Wherein it must be confessed, that Heauen was made too much to bow to Earth, and Religion
               
to Policie. But soone after, CVRSON (when hee saw time) returned into England, and withall into wonted Fauour with the King, but worse Fame with the People. Vpon whose returne the Earle was much dismayed, and seeing himselfe destitute of hopes (the Ladie MARGARET also by tract of Time, and bad Successe, being now become coole in those Attempts) after some wandering in France, and Germanie, and certaine little Proiects, no better than Squibbs of an Exiled man, being tired out, retired againe into the Protection of the Arch-Duke PHILIP in Flanders, who by the death of ISABELLA was at that time King of Castile, in the right of IOAN his Wife.
            This yeare (beeing the Nineteenth of his Raigne) the King called his Parliament. Wherein a man may easily guesse, how absolute the King tooke himselfe to bee with his Parliament, when DVDLEY that was so hatefull, was made Speaker of the House of Commons. In this Parliament, there were not made any Statutes memorable, touching publike Gouernement. But those that were, had still the Stampe of the Kings Wisedome and Policie.
            
            There was a Statute made for the disanulling of all Patents of Lease, or Grant, to such as came not vpon lawfull Summons, to serue the King in his Warres, against the Enemies or Rebels, or that should depart without the kings license; With an Exception of certaine Persons of the Long-robe. Prouiding neuerthelesse, That they should haue the kings Wages, from their House, till their Returne home againe. There had beene the like made before for Offices, and by thin Statute it was extended to Lands. But a man may easily see by many Statutes made in this kings time, that the king thought it safest, to assist Martiall Law, by Law of Parliament.
            
            Another Statute was made, prohibiting the bringing

in of Manufactures of Silke wrought by it selfe, or mixt with any other Threed. But it was not of Stuffes of whole piece (for that the Realme had of them no Manufacture in vse at that time) but of Knit-Silke, or Texture of Silke; as Ribbands, Laces, Caules, Points, and Girdles, &amp;c. which the People of England could then well skill to make. This Law pointed at a true Principle; That where forraine materials are but Superfluities, forraine Manufactures should bee prohibited. For that will either banish the Superfluitie, or gaine the Manufacture.
            
            There was a Law also of Resumption of Patents of Gaoles, and the Reannexing of them to the Sherifwicks; Priuiledged Officers beeing no lesse an Interruption of Iustice, than priuiledged Places.
            
            There was likewise a Law to restraine the By-lawes or Ordinances of Corporations, which many times were against the Prerogatiue of the King, the Common-law of the Realme, and the Libertie of the Subiect, beeing Fraternities in Euill. It was therefore Prouided, that they should not bee put in Execution, without the Allowance of the Chancellor, Treasurer, and the two Chiefe-Iustices, or three of them, or of the two Iustices of Circuit where the Corporation was.
            Another Law was (in effect) to bring in the Siluer of the Realme to the Mint, in making all clipped, minished, or impayred Coines of Siluer, not to bee currant in payments; without giuing any Remedie of weight, but with an exception onely of a reasonable wearing, which was as nothing in respect of the incertaintie; and so (vpon the matter) to set the Mint on worke, and to giue way to New Coines of Siluer, which should bee then minted.
            There likwise was a long Statute against Vagabonds, wherein two things may bee noted; The one the Dislike the Parliament had of Gaoling of them, as

that which was chargeable, pesterous, and of no open Example. The other, That in the Statutes of this Kings time, (for this of the Nineteenth yeare is not the onely Statute of that kind) there are euer coupled, the punishment of Uagabonds, and the Forbidding of Dice, and Cards, and vnlawfull Games vnto Seruants and meane people, and the putting downe and suppressing of Ale-houses, as Strings of one Roote together, and as if the One were vnprofitable, without the Other.
            As for Riot and Retainers, there passed scarce any Parliament in this time without a Law against them, The King euer hauing an Eye to Might, and Multitude.
            
            There was granted also that Parliamemt a Subsidie, both for the Temporaltie and the Clergie. And yet neuerthelesse, ere the yeare expired, there went out Commissions for a generall Beneuolence, though there were no Warres; no Feares. The same yeare the Citty gaue fiue thousand Markes, for Confirmation of their Liberties; A thing fitter for the Beginnings of Kings Raignes, than the latter Ends. Neither was it a small matter, that the Mint gained vpon the late Statute, by the Recoinage of Groats and Halfe-groats, now Twelue-pences and Six-pences. As for EMPSON and DVDLEY'S Mills, they did grinde more than euer. So that it was a strange thing, to see what Golden Showres powred downe vpon the Kings Treasurie at once. The last paiments of the Marriage-money from Spaine; The Subsidie; The Beneuolence; The Recoinage; The Redemption of the Cities Liberties; The Casualties. And this is the more to bee marueiled at, because the King had then no Occasions at all of Warres or Troubles. Hee had now but one Sonne, and one Daughter vnbestowed. Hee was Wise; Hee was of an High Mind; Hee needed not to make Riches his Glorie. Hee

did excell in so many things else; saue that certainely Auarice doth euer finde in it selfe matter of Ambition. Belike hee thought to leaue his Sonne such a Kingdome, and such a Masse of Treasure, as hee might choose his Greatnesse where hee would.
            This yeare was also kept the Serieants Feast, which was the second Call in this Kings Dayes.
            
            About this time ISABELLA, Queene of Castile, deceased; a right Noble Ladie, and an Honour to her Sexe, and Times, and the Corner-stone of the Greatnesse of Spaine, that hath followed. This Accident the King tooke not for Newes at large, but thought it had a great Relation to his owne Affaires; especially in two points. The One, for Example; the Other for Consequence. First, hee conceiued that the Case of FERDINANDO of Arragon, after the death of Queene ISABELLA, was his owne Case, after the death of his owne Queene: and the Case of IOAN the Heire vnto Castile, was the Case of his owne Sonne Prince HENRY. For if both of the Kings had their Kingdomes, in the right of their Wiues, they descended to the Heires, and did not accrew to the Husbands. And although his owne Case had both Steele and Parchment, more than the other (that is to say, a Conquest in the Field, and an Act of Parliament) yet notwithstanding, that Naturall Title of Descent in Bloud, did (in the imagination euen of a Wise-man) breed a Doubt, that the other two were not safe nor sufficient. Wherefore he was wonderfull diligent, to inquire and obserue what became of the King of Arragon, in holding and continuing the Kingdome of Castile. And whether he did hold it in his owne Right, or as Administrator to his Daughter; And whether he were like to hold it in Fact, or to bee put out by his Sonne-in-Law. Secondly, hee did reuolue in his minde, that the Stateof Christendome might by this late Accident haue a turne. For whereas before time Himselfe, with

the Coniunction of Arragon and Castile (which then was one) and the Amitie of MAXIMILIAN and PHILIP his Sonne the Arch-Duke, was farre too strong a Partie for France; hee beganne to feare, that now the French King (who had great Interest in the Affections of PHILIP the young King of Castile) and PHILIP himselfe, now king of Castile, (who was in ill Termes with his Father-in-law about the present Gouernment of Castile) And thirdly MAXIMILIAN, PHILIPS Father (who was euer variable, and vpon whom the surest Aime that could bee taken, was that hee would not be long, as hee had beene last before) would, all three being potent Princes, enter into some strait League and Confederation amongst themselues. Whereby though hee should not be endangered, yet hee should be left to the poore Amitie of Arragon. And whereas he had beene heretofore a kind of Arbiter of Europe, he should now goe lesse, and bee ouer-topped by so great a Coniunction. Hee had also (as it seemes) an inclination to marrie, and bethought himselfe of some fit Conditions abroad. And amongst others, hee had heard of the Beautie and vertuous Behauiour of the young Queene of Naples, the Widdow of FERDINANDO the younger, being then of Matronall yeares of seuen and twentie. By whose Marriage he thought that the Kingdome of Naples (hauing beene a Gole for a time betweene the king of Arragon, and the French King, and being but newly setled) might in some part be Deposited in his hands, who was so able to keepe the Stakes. Therefore hee sent in Ambassage or Message three Confident Persons; FRANCIS MARSIN, IAMES BRAY-BROOKE, and IOHN STILE, vpon two seuerall Inquisitions rather than Negotiations. The One, touching the Person and Condition of the young Queene of Naples. The Other touching all particulars of Estate, that concerned

the Fortunes and Intentions of FERDINANDO. And because they may obserue best, who themselues are obserued least, hee sent them vnder Colourable Pretexts; giuing them Letters of Kindnesse and Complement from KATHERINE the Princesse, to her Aunt, and Neece, the Olde and Young Queene of Naples, and deliuering to them also a Booke of new Articles of Peace; which notwithstanding it had beene deliuered vnto Doctor de PVEBLA, the Leigier Ambassadour of Spaine here in England, to be sent; yet for that the King had beene long without hearing from Spaine, hee thought good those Messengers, when they had beene with the two Queenes, should likewise passe on to the Court of FERDINANDO, and take a Copie of the Booke with them. The Instructions touching the Queene of Naples were so curious and exquisite, beeing as Articles whereby to direct a Suruey, or framing a Particular of her Person, for Complexion, Fauour, Feature, Stature, Health, Age, Customes, Behauiour, Conditions, and Estate, as if the King had beene young, a Man would haue iudged him to bee Amorous; but being ancient, it ought to be interpreted, that sure he was verie Chaste, for that hee meant to finde all things in one Woman, and so to settle his Affections, without ranging But in this Match hee was soone cooled, when hee heard from his Ambassadors, that this young Queene had had a goodly Ioynture in the Realme of Naples, well answered during the time of her Vnckle FREDERICKE, yea, and during the time of LEVVIS the French King, in whose Diuision her Reuenue fell; But since the time that the Kingdome was in FERDINANDO'S hands, all was assigned to the Armie, and Garrisons there, and shee receiued only a Pension or Exhibition out of his Coffers.
            The other part of the Inquirie had a graue and diligent

Returne, informing the King at full of the present State of King FERDINANDO. By this report it appeared to the King, that FERDINANDO did continue the Gouernment of Castile as Administrator vnto his Daughter IOAN, by the Title of Queene ISABELLA'S Will, and partly by the Custome of the Kingdome, as he pretended. And that all Mandates and Grants were expedited in the name of IOAN his Daughter, and himselfe as Administrator, without mention of PHILIP, her Husband. And that king FERDINANDO, howsoeuer hee did dismisse himselfe of the Name of King of Castile, yet meant to hold the Kingdome, without Accompt, and in absolute Command.
            It appeareth also, that hee flattered himselfe with hopes, that king PHILIP would permit vnto him the Gouernement of Castile during his life; which hee had layed his plot to worke him vnto, both by some Councellors of his about him, which FERDINANDO had at his deuotion, and chiefly by Promise, that in case PHILIP gaue not way vnto it, hee would marrie some young Ladie, whereby to put him by the Succession of Arragon and Granada, in case hee should haue a Sonne. And lastly, by representing vnto him that the Gouernement of the Burgundians, till PHILIP were by continuance in Spaine made as Naturall of Spaine, would not bee indured by the Spaniards. But in all those things (though wisely layed downe and considered) FERDINANDO failed; But that PLVTO was better to him, than PALLAS.
            In the same Report also, the Ambassadours beeing meane men, and therefore the more free, did strike vpon a String which was somewhat dangerous. For they declared plainely, that the People of Spaine, both Nobles and Commons, were better affected vnto the part of PHILIP (so hee brought his wife with him)

than to FERDINANDO; And expressed the reason to bee, because hee had imposed vpon them many Taxes, and Tallages, whith was the Kings owne Case betweene him and his Sonne.
            There was also in this Report a Declaration of an Ouerture of Marriage, which AMASON the Secretarie of FERDINANDO had made vnto the Ambassadours in great secret, betweene CHARLES Prince of Castile and MARIE the Kings second Daughter; assuring the king, that the Treatie of Marriage then on foot, for the said Prince and the Daughter of France, would breake; and that shee the said Daughter of France should bee married to ANGOLESME, that was the Heire apparant of France.
            
            There was a touch also of a speech of Marriage betweene FERDINANDO and Madame de FOIS, a Ladie of the Bloud of France, which afterwards indeed succeeded. But this was reported as learned in France, and silenced in Spaine.
            
            The King by the returne of this Ambassage, which gaue great light vnto his Affaires, was well instructed, and prepared how to carrie himselfe betweene FERDINANDO King of Arragon, and PHILIP his Sonne-in-law, King of Castile; resoluing with himselfe, to doe all that in him lay to keepe them at one within themselues; But howsoeuer that succeeded, by a moderate Carriage and bearing the Person of a Common-friend, to loose neither of their Friendships; but yet to runne a Course more entire with the King of Arragon, but more laboured and officious with the King of Castile. But hee was much taken with the Ouerture of Marriage with his Daughter MARIE; Both because it was the greatest Marriage of Christendome, and for that it tooke hold of both Allies.
            
            But to corroborate his Alliance with PHILIP, the Windes gaue him an Enter-view. For PHILIP

choosing the Winter-Season, the better to surprise the King of Arragon, set forth with a great Nauie out of Flanders for Spaine in the Moneth of Ianuarie, the one and Twentieth yeare of the Kings Raigne. But himselfe was surprised with a cruell Tempest, that scattered his Ships vpon the seuerall Coasts of England. And the Ship wherein the King and Queene were (with two other small Barkes onely) torne, and in great perill to escape the Furie of the weather, thrust into Waymouth. King PHILIP himselfe, hauing not beene vsed (as it seemes) to Sea, all wearied and extreame sicke, would needes land ro refresh his Spirits, though it was against the Opinion of his Councell, doubting it might breed Delay, his Occasions requiring Celeritie.
            
            The Rumour of the Arriuall of a puissant Nauie vpon the Coast, made the Countrie Arme. And Sir THOMAS TRENCHARD with Forces suddenly raised, not knowing what the matter might bee, came to Waymouth. Where vnderstanding the Accident, hee did in all Humblenesse and Humanitie inuite the King and Queene to his House; and forthwith dispatched Posts to the Court. Soone after came Sir IOHN CAROE likewise, with a great troupe of Men well armed; vsing the like Humblenesse and Respect towards the king, when hee knew the Case. King PHILIP doubting that they, being but Subiects, durst not let him passe away againe, without the Kings Notice and Leaue, yeelded to their Entreatie
                  •
               , to staie till they heard from the Court. The king as soone as hee heard the Newes, commanded presently the Earle of Arundell, to goe to visite the king of Castile, and let him vnderstand; That as hee was verie sorrie for his Mishap, so hee was glad that hee had escaped the Danger of the Seas, and likewise of the Occasion himselfe had to doe him Honour; and

desiring him, to thinke himselfe as in his owne Land; and that the king made all hast possible to come and imbrace him. The Earle came to him in great Magnificence, with a braue Troupe of three hundred Horse; and (for more State) came by Torch-Light. After hee had done the Kings Message, King PHILIP seeing how the world went, the sooner to get away, went vpon speed to the King at Windsore, and his Queene followed by easie iourneys. The two kings at their meeting vsed all the Caresses, and louing Demonstrations, that were possible. And the king of Castile said pleasantly to the King; That hee was now punished, for that he would not come within his walled Towne of Calice, when they met last. But the king answered, That walles and Seas were nothing, where Hearts were open; and that hee was here no otherwise, but to bee serued. After a Day or two's refreshing, the kings entred into speech of renewing the Treatie; The King saying, That though King PHILIPS Person were the same, yet his Fortunes and State were raised. In which Case a Renouation of Treatie was vsed amongst Princes. But while these things were in handling, the king choosing a fit time, and drawing the king of Castile into a Roome, where they two onely were priuate, and laying his hand ciuilly vpon his arme, and changing his Countenance a little from a Countenance of Intertainment, said to him; Sir, you haue beene saued vpon my Coast, I hope you will not suffer mee to wracke vpon yours. The King of Castile asked him, What hee meant by that speech? I meane it (saith the King) by that same Harebraine wilde Fellow, my subiect, the Earle of Suffolke, who is protected in your Countrie, and begins to play the Foole, when all others are wearie of it. The King of Castile answered; I had thought (Sir) your Felicitie had beene aboue those thoughts. But if it trouble you, I will banish him. The King replied; Those
               
               Hornets were best in their Nest, and worst then when they did stie abroad, that his desire was, to haue him deliuered to him. The King of Castile here with a little confused, and in a studie, said; That can I not doe with my honour, and lesse with yours; for you will bee thought to haue vsed mee as a Prisoner. The King presently said; Then the matter is at an end. For I will take that dishonour vpon me, and so your honour is saued. The King of Castile, who had the king in great Estimation, and besides remembred where hee was, and knew not what vse hee might haue of the kings Amitie, for that himselfe was new in his Estate of Spaine, and vnsetled, both with his Father-in-Law, and with his People, composing his Countenance, said; Sir, you giue Law to mee; but so will I to you. You shall haue him, but (vpon your honour) you shall not take his life. The king embracing him, said; Agreed. Saith the king of Castile, Neither shall it dislike you, if I send to him in such a fashion, as hee may partly come with his owne good will. The king said; It was well thought of; and if it pleased him, hee would ioyne with him, in sending to the Earle a Message to that purpose. They both sent seuerally, and meane while they continued Feasting and Pastimes. The King beeing (on his part) willing to haue the Earle sure before the king of Castile went; and the king of Castile beeing as willing to seeme to bee inforced. The King also with many wise and excellent Perswasions, did aduise the king of Castile, to bee ruled by the Councell of his Father-in-Law FERDINANDO; a Prince so prudent, so experienced, so fortunate. The King of Castile (who was in no verie good termes with his said Father-in-Law) answered; That if his Father-in-Law would suffer him to gouerne his Kingdomes, hee should gouerne him.
            
            There were immediatly Messengers sent from both Kings to recall the Earle of Suffolke: Who

vpon gentle wordes vsed to him was soone charmed, and willing enough to returne; assured of his Life, and hoping of his Libertie. Hee was brought through Flanders to Calice, and thence landed at Douer, and with sufficient Guard deliuered and receiued at the Tower of London. Meane while King HENRY (to draw out the time) continued his Feastings and Entertainments, and after hee had receiued the king of Castile into the Fraternitie of the Garter, and for a Reciprocall had his Sonne the Prince admitted to the Order of the Golden-Fleece, hee accompainied King PHILIP and his Queene to the Citie of London; where they were entertayned with the greatest Magnificence and Triumph, that could bee vpon no greater warning. And as soone as the Earle of Suffolke had beene conueyed to the Tower (which was the serious part) the Iollities had an end, and the Kings tooke leaue. Neuerthelesse during their beeing heere, they in Substance concluded that Treatie, which the Flemings terme Intercursus malus, and beares Date at Windsore; for that there bee some things in it, more to the Aduantage of the English, than of them; especially, for that the Free-fishing of the Dutch vpon the Coasts and Seas of England, granted in the Treatie of Undecimo, was not by this Treatie confirmed. All Articles that confirme former Treaties beeing precisely and warily limitted and confirmed to matter of Commerce onely, and not otherwise
            It was obserued, that the great Tempest which draue PHILIP into England, blew downe the Golden Eagle, from the Spire of PAVLES, and in the fall it fell vpon a Signe of the Blacke Eagle, which was in PAVLES Church-Yard, in the

place where the Schoole-House now standeth, and battered it, and brake it downe. Which was a strange stooping of a Hawke vpon a Fowle. This the People interpreted to bee an Ominous Prognosticke vpon the Imperiall House, which was (by Interpretation also) fulfilled vpon PHILIP the Emperours Sonne, not onely in the Present Disaster of the Tempest, but in that that followed. For PHILIP arriuing into Spaine, and attaining the Possession of the Kingdome of Castile without resistance, (insomuch as FERDINANDO, who had spoke so great before, was with difficultie admitted to the speech of his Sonne-in-Law) sickned soone after, and deceased. Yet after such time as there was an Obseruation by the wisest of that Court, That if hee had liued, his Father would haue gained vpon him in that sort, as hee would haue gouerned his Councells, and Designes, if not his Affections. By this all Spaine returned into the power of FERDINANDO in state as it was before; the rather, in regard of the infirmitie of IOAN his Daughter, who louing her Husband (by whom shee had many Children) dearely well, and no lesse beloued of him (howsoeuer her Father, to make PHILIP ill beloued of the People of Spaine, gaue out that PHILIP vsed her not well) was vnable in strength of minde to beare the Griefe of his Decease, and fell distracted of her Wittes. Of which Maladie her Father was thought no wayes to endeuour the Cure, the better to hold his Regall Power in Castile. So that as the Felicitie of CHARLES the Eighth was said to bee a Dreame; so the Aduersitie of FERDINANDO was said likewise to bee a Dreame, it passed ouer so soone.
            
               
About this time the King was desirous to bring into the House of LANCASTER Celestiall Honour, and became Suitor to Pope IVLIVS, to Canonize King HENRY the Sixt for a Saint; the rather, in respect of that his famous Prediction of the Kings owne Assumption to the Crowne. IVLIVS referred the matter (as the manner is) to certaine Cardinalls, to take the verification of his Holy Acts and Miracles. But it died vnder the Reference. The generall Opinion was, that Pope IVLIVS was too deare, and that the King would not come to his Rates. But it is more probable, That that Pope (who was extremely iealous of the Dignitie of the Sea of Rome, and of the Actes thereof) knowing that King HENRY the Sixth was reputed in the world abroad but for a Simple Man, was affraide it would but diminish the Estimation of that kinde of Honour, if there were not a distance kept betweene Iunocents and Saints.
            
            The same yeare likewise there proceeded a Treatie of Marriage betweene the King and the Ladie MARGARET Duchesse Dowager of Sauoy, onely Daughter to MAXIMILIAN, and Sister to the King of Castile; a Ladie wise, and of great good Fame. This Matter had beene in speech betweene the two Kings at their meeting, but was soone after resumed; and therein was imployed for his first piece the Kings then Chaplaine, and after the great Prelate THOMAS WOLSEY. It was in the end concluded, with great and ample Conditions for the king, but with promise De Futuro only. It may be the king was the rather induced vnto it, for that he heard more and more of the Marriage to goe on betweene his great Friend and Allie FERDINANDO of Arragon, and Madame de FOIS, whereby that King beganne to piece with the

               French King, from whom hee had beene alwayes before seuered. So fatall a thing it is, for the greatest and straitest Amities of Kings, at one time or other to haue a little of the Wheele. Nay thereis a further Tradition (in Spaint, though not with vs) That the King of Arragon, after hee knew that the Marriage betweene CHARLES, the young Prince of Castile, and MARIE the Kings second Daughter went roundly on (which though it was first mooued by the King of Arragon, yet it was afterwards wholly aduanced and brought to perfection by MAXIMILIAN, and the Friends on that side) entred into a iealousie, that the King did aspire to the Gouernment of Castilia, as Administrator during the Minoritie of his Sonne-in-Law; as if there should haue beene a Competition of Three for that Gouernment; FERDINANDO, Grand-father on the Mothers side; MAXIMILIAN, Grand-father on the Fathers side; and King HENRIE; Father-in-Law to the young Prince. Certainely, it is not vnlike, but the Kings Gouernment (carrying the young Prince with him) would haue beene perhaps more welcome to the Spaniards, than that of the other Two. For the Nobilitie of Castilia, that so lately put out the King of Arragon, in fauour of King PHILIP, and had discouered themselues so farre, could not bee but in a secret Distrust and Distaste of that King. And as for MAXIMILIAN, vpon Twentie respects hee could not haue beene the Man. But this purpose of the Kings seemeth to mee (considering the Kings safe Courses, neuer found to bee enterprizing or aduenturous) not greatly probable, except hee should haue had a Desire to breathe warmer, because hee had ill Lunger. This Marriage with MARGARET was protracted from time to time, in respect of the Infirmitie of the King, who now in the two

and Twentieth of his Raigne beganne to bee troubled with the Goute. But the Defluxion taking also into his Brest, wasted his Lungs, so that thrice in a Yeare (in a kinde of Returne, and especially in the Spring,) hee had great Fitts and Labours of the Tissicke. Neuerthelesse, hee continued to intend Businesse with as great diligence, as before in his Health. Yet so, as vpon this warning, hee did likewise now more seriously thinke of the World to come, and of making himselfe a Saint, aswell as King HENRIE the Sixth, by Treasure better imployed, than to bee giuen to Pope IVLIVS. For this Yeare hee gaue greater Almes than accustomed, and discharged all Prisoners about the Citie, that lay for Fees or Debts, vnder fortie shillings. Hee did also make haste with Religious Foundations; and in the Yeare following (which was the Three and Twentieth) finished that of the Sauoy. And hearing also of the bitter Cryes of his People against the Oppressions of DVDLEY and EMPSON, and their Complices; partly by Deuout Persons about him, and partly by publicke Sermons (the Preachers doing their Dutie therein) Hee was touched with great Remorse for the same. Neuerthelesse, EMPSON and DVDLEY, though they could not but heare of these Scruples in the Kings Conscience; yet as if the Kings Soule and his Money were in seuerall Offices, that the One was not to intermeddle with the Other, went on with as great rage as euer. For the same three and Twentieth Yeare was there a sharpe Prosecution against Sir VVILLIAM CAPEL now the second time; and this was for Matters of Misgouernment in his Maioraltie. The great Matter beeing, that in some Payments hee had taken knowledge of False Moneys, and did

not his diligence to examine, and beate it out, who were the Offendours. For this and some other things layed to his Charge, hee was condemned to pay Two Thousand Pounds; and beeing a Man of stomacke, and hardened by his former Troubles, refused to pay 2 Mite; and bee like vsed some vntoward Speeches of the Proceedings, for which hee was sent to the Tower, and there remayned till the Kings Death. KNESVVORTH likewise, that had beene lately Maior of London, and both his Sheriffes, were, for Abuses in their Offices, questioned, and imprisoned, and deliuered, vpon one Thousand foure hundred pounds payed. HAVVIS, an Alderman of London, was put in Trouble, and died with Thought, and Anguish, before his Businesse came to an end. Sir LAVVRENCE AILMER, who had likewise beene Maior of London, and his two Sheriffes, were put to the Fine of one Thousand Pounds. And Sir LAVVRENCE, for refusing to make payment, was committed to Prison, where hee stayed till EMPSON himselfe was committed in his place.
            It is no marueile (if the Faults were so light, and the Rates so heauie) that the Kings Treasure of store, that hee left at his death, most of it in secret places, vnder his owne Key and keeping, at Richmond, amounted (as by Tradition it is reported to haue done) vnto the Summe of neare Eighteene hundred thousand pounds Sterling; a huge Masse of Money, euen for these times.
            The last Act of State that concluded this kings Temporall Felicitie, was the Conclusion of a Glorious Match betweene his Daughter MARIE, and CHARLES Prince of Castile, afterwards the

great Emperour, both beeing of tender yeares Which Treatie was perfected by Bishop FOXE, and other his Commissioners at Calice, the yeare before the Kings Death. In which Alliance, it seemeth hee himselfe tooke so high Contentment, as in a Letter which hee wrote thereupon to the Citie of London (commaunding all possible demonstrations of ioy to bee made for the same) hee expresseth himselfe, as if hee thought hee had built a Wall of Brasse about his Kingdome. When hee had for his Sonnes-in-law, a King of Scotland, and a Prince of Castile and Burgundie. So as now there was nothing to bee added to this great Kings Felicitie, beeing at the top of all worldly Blisse, (in regard of the high Marriages of his Children, his great Renowne throughout Europe, and his scarce credible Riches, and the perpetuall Constancie of his prosperous Successes) but an opportune Death, to withdraw him from any future blowe of Fortune. Which certainely (in regard of the great Hatred of his People, and the Title of his Sonne, being then come to Eighteene yeares of age, and being a bold Prince, and liberall, and that gained vpon the People by his very Aspect and Presence) had not beene impossible to haue come vpon him.
            To crowne also the last yeare of his Raigne, as well as his first, hee did an Act of Pietie, rare, and worthy to bee taken into Imitation. For hee granted forth a Generall Pardon, as expecting a second Coronation in a better Kingdome. Hee did also declare in his Will, that his minde was, that Restitution should bee made of those Summes, which had beene vniustly taken by his Officers.
            
            And thus this SALOMON of England (for SALOMON also was too heauie vpon his People
               
in Exactions) hauing liued two and fiftie yeares, and thereof Raigned three and twentie yeares, and eight Moneths, beeing in perfect Memorie, and in a most Blessed Minde, in a great Calme of a Consuming Sickenesse passed to a better World, the two and twentieth of Aprill, 1508. at his Palace of Richmond, which himselfe had built.
            
               
                  
                  THis King (to speake of him in Tearmes equall to his Deseruing) was one of the best sort of VVonders; a Wonder for VVisemen. Hee had parts (both in his Vertues, and his Fortune) not so fit for a Common-place, as for Obseruation. Certainly hee was Religious, both in his Affection, and Obseruance. But as hee could see cleare (for those times) through Superstition, so he would be blinded (now and then) by Humane Policie. Hee aduanced Church-men; hee was tender in the Priuiledge of Sanctuaries, though they wrought him much mischiefe. Hee built and endowed many Religious Foundations, besides his Memorable Hospitall of the Sauoy. And yet was hee a great Almes-giuer in secret; which shewed, that his VVorkes in publique were dedicated rather to GODS Glorie, than his owne. Hee professed alwaies to loue and seeke Peace; and it was his vsuall Preface in his Treaties; That when CHRIST came into the World, Peace was sung; and when HEE went out of the World, Peace was bequeathed. And this Vertue could not proceede out of Feare, or Softnesse; for he was Valiant and Actiue, and therefore (no doubt) it was truely Christian and Morall. Yet hee knew the way to Peace, was not to seeme
                  
                  to bee desirous to auoyde Warres. Therefore would be make Cffers, and Fames of Warres, till hee had mended the Conditions of Peace. It was also much, that one that was so great a Louer of Peace, should be so happie in VVarre. For his Armes (eyther in Forraine or Ciuill VVarres) were neuer Infortunate; neyther did be know what a Disaster meant. The VVarre of his Comming in, and the Rebellions of the Earle of Lincolne, and the Lord AWDLEY were ended by Victorie. The VVarres of France and Scotland, by Peaces sought at his hands. That of Brittaine, by accident of the Dukes death. The Insurrection of the Lord LOVEL, and that of PERKIN at Excester, and in Kent, by flight of the Rebells, before they came to Blowes. So that his Fortune of Armes was still Inuiolate. The rather sure, for that in the quenching of the Commotions of his Subiects, hee euer went in Person, Sometimes reseruing himselfe to backe and second his Lieutenants, but euer in Action; and yet that was not meerely Forwardnesse, but partly Distrust of others.
               
               
                  Hee did much maintaine and countenance his Lawes. Which (neuerthelesse) was no Impediment to him to worke his VVill. For it was so handled, that neyther Prerogatiue, nor
                  
Profit went to Diminution. And yet as hee would sometimes straine vp his Lawes to his Prerogatiue, so would hee also let downe his Prerogatiue to his Parliament. For Minte, and Warres, and Marshall Discipline, (things of Absolute Power) hee would neuerthelesse bring to Parliament. Iustice was well administred in his time, saue where the King was Partie: Saue also, that the Councell-Table intermedled too much with Meum and Tuum. For it was a very Court of Iustice during his time, especially in the Beginning. But in that part both of Iustice and Policie, which is the Durable Part, and cut (as it were) in Brasse or Marble (which is The making of good Lawes) he did excell. And with his Iustice, hee was also a Mercifull Prince. As in whose time, there were but three of the Nobilitie that suffered; the Earle of Warwicke, the Lord Chamberlaine, and the Lord AWDLEY. Though the first two were in stead of Numbers, in the Dislike and Obloquie of the People. But there were neuer so great Rebellions, expiated with so little Bloud, drawne by the hand of Iustice, as the two Rebellions of Black-heath and Excester. As for the Seueritie vsed vpon those which were taken in Kent, it was but vpon a Scumme of
                  
People. His Pardons went euer both before, and after his Sword. But then hee had withall a strange kinde of Interchanging of large and inexpected Pardons, which seuere Executions. Which (his Wisedome considered) could not bee imputed to any Inconstancie, or Inequalitie; but either to some Reason which we do not now know, or to a Principle hee had set vnto himselfe, That hee would varie, and try both wayes in turne. But the lesse Bloud hee drew, the more hee tooke of Treasure. And (as some construed it) hee was the more sparing in the One, that hee might bee the more pressing in the Other; for both would haue beene intollerable. Of Nature assuredly hee coueted to accumulate Treasure, and was a little Poore in admiring Riches. The People (into whom there is infused, for the preseruation of Monarchies, a naturall Desire to discharge their Princes, though it bee with the vniust charge of their Councellours and Ministers) did impute this vnto Cardinall MORTON, and Sir REGINOLD BRAY. Who (as it after appeared) as Councellours of ancient Authoritie with him, did so second his Humours, as neuerthelesse they did temper them. Whereas EMPSON, and DVDLEY that followed, beeing Persons that had no Reputation with him (otherwise

than by the seruile following of his Bent) did not giue way onely (as the first did) but shape him way to those Extreamities, for which himselfe was touched with remorse at his Death, and which his Successour renounced, and sought to purge. This Excesse of his, had at that time many Glosses and Interpretations. Some thought the continuall Rebellions wherewith hee had beene vexed, had made him grow to hate his People. Some thought it was done to pull downe their Stomackes, and to keep them low. Some, for that hee would leaue his Sonne a Golden fleece. Some suspected he had some high Designe vpon Forraine parts. But those perhaps shall come nearest the truth, that fetch not their reasons so far off; but rather impute it to Nature, Age, Peace, and a Minde fixed vpon no other Ambition or Pursuit. Whereunto I should adde, that hauing euery day Occasion to take notice of the Necessities and Shifts for Money of other great Princes abroad, it did the better (by Comparison) set of to him the Felicitie of full Cofers. As to his expending of Treasure, he neuer spared Charge which his Affaires required; and in his Buildings was Magnificent, but his Rewards were very limitted. So that his Liberalitie was rather vpon his owne State and Memorie, than vpon the Deserts of others.
               
                  
                  Hee was of an High Minde, and loued his owne Will, and his owne VVay; as One that reuered himselfe, and would Reigne indeed. Had hee beene a Priuate-man, hee would haue beene termed Proud. But in a wise Prince, it was but keeping of Distance, which indeede hee did towards all; not admitting any neare or full Approach, neither to his Power or to his Secrets. For hee was gouerned by none. His Queene (notwithstanding shee had presented him with diuers Children, and with a Crowne also, (though hee would not acknowledge it) could doe nothing with him. His Mother hee reuerenced much, heard little. For any Person agreeable to him for Societie (such as was HASTINGS to King EDWARD the Fourth, or CHARLES BRANDON after to King HENRY the Eight) hee had none: Except wee should account for such Persons, FOXE, and BRAY, and EMPSON, because they were so much with him. But it was but as the Instrument is much with the VVorke-man. Hee had nothing in him of Vaine-glorie, but yet kept State and Maiestie to the height; Being sensible, That Maiestie maketh the People how, but Vaine-glorie boweth to them.
               
               
                  To his Confederates abroade he was Constant

                  and Iust, but not Open. But rather such was his Inquirie, and such his Closenesse, as they stood in the Light towards him, and hee stood in the Darke to them. Yet vvithout Strangenesse, but with a semblance of mutuall Communication of Affaires. As for little Enuies or Emulations vpon Forraine Princes (which are frequent with many Kings) hee had neuer any; but went substantially to his owne Businesse. Certaine it is, that though his Reputation was great at home, yet it was greater abroad. For Forrainers that could not see the Passages of Affaires, but made their Iudgements vpon the Issues of them, noted that hee was euer in Strife, and euer a Loft. It grew also from the Aires, which the Princes and States abroad receiued from their Ambassadours and Agents here; which were attending the Court in great number. Whom hee did not onely content with Courtesie, Reward, and Priuatenesse; but (vpon such Conferences as passed with them) put them in Admiration, to finde his Vniuersall Insight into the Affaires of the World. Which though hee did sucke chiefely from themselues; yet that which hee had gathered from them all, seemed Admirable to euery one. So that they did write euer to their Superiours in high tearmes, concerning

his Wisedome and Art of Rule, Nay, when they were returned, they did commonly maintaine Intelligence with him. Such a Dexteritie hee had to impropriate to himselfe all Forraine Instruments.
               
                  Hee was carefull and liberall to obtaine good Intelligence from all parts abroad. Wherein hee did not onely vse his Interest in the Leigers here, and his Pensioners which hee had both in the Court of Rome, and other the Courts of Christendome; but the Industrie and Vigilancie of his owne Ambassadours in Forraine parts. For which purpose, his Instructions were euer Extroame, Curious, and Articulate; and in them more Articles touching Inquisition, than touching Negotiation. Requiring likewise from his Ambassadours an Answer, in particular distinct Articles, respectiuely to his Questions.
               
                  As for his secret Spialls, which hee did imploy both at home and abroade, by them to discouer what Practices and Conspiracies were against him, surely his Case required it: He had such Moles perpetually working and casting to vndermine him. Neither can it bee reprehended. For if Spialls bee lawfull against lawfull Enemies, much more against Conspirators, and Traitors. But indeede to giue them
                  
Credence by Othes or Curses, that cannot bee well maintayned; For those are too holy Vestments for a Disguise. Yet surely there was this further Good in his employing of these Flies and Familiars; That as the vse of them was cause that many Conspiracies were reuealed, so the Fame and Suspition of them kept (no doubt) many Conspiracies from being attempted.
               
               
                  Towards his Queene hee was nothing Vxorious, nor scarce Indulgent; but Companiable, and Respectiue, and without Iealousie. Towards his Children bee was full of Paternall Affection, Carefull of their Education, aspiring to their High Aduancement, regular to see that they should not want of any due Honour and Respect, but not greatly willing to cast anie Popular Lustre vpon them.
               
               
                  To his Councell hee did referre much, and sate oft in Person; knowing it to bee the Way to assist his Power, and informe his Iudgement. In which respect also hee vvas fairely patient of Libertie, both of Aduise, and of Vote, till himselfe were declared. Hee kept a strait hand on his Nobilitie, and chose rather to aduance Clergie-men and Lawyers, which were more Obsequious to him, but had
                  
lesse Interest in the People; which made for his Absolutenesse, but not for his Safetie. In so much as (I am perswaded) it was one of the Causes of his troublesome Raigne: for that his Nobles, though they were Loyall and Obedient, yet did not Co-operate with him, but let euery man goe his owne Way. Hee was not affraid of an Able Man, as LEWIS the Eleuenth was. But contrariwise, hee was serued by the Ablest Men that were to bee found; vvithout which his Affaires could not haue prospered as they did. For VVare, BEDFORD, OXFORD, SVRREY, DAWBENEY, BROOKE, POYNINGS. For other Affaires, MORTON, FOXE, BRAY, the Prior of Lanthony, WARHAM, VRSVVICKE, HVSSEY, FROWICKE, and others. Neyther did hee care how Cunning they were, that hee did imploy; For hee thought himselfe to haue the Master-Reach. And as hee chose well, so hee held them vp well. For it is a strange thing, that though hee were a Darke Prince, and infinitely Suspicious, and his Times full of Secret Conspiracies and Troubles; yet in Twentie foure yeares Raigne, hee neuer put downe, or discomposed Counsellor, or neare Seruant, saue onely STANLEY, the Lord Chamberlaine.
                  
As for the Disposition of his Subiects in Generall towards him, it stood thus with him; That of the Three Affections, which naturally tye the hearts of the Subiects to their Soueraignes, Loue, Feare, and Reuerence; hee had the last in height, the second in good measure, and so little of the first, as he was beholding to the other Two.
               
               Hee was a Prince, Sad, Serious, and full of Thoughts, and secret Obseruations, and full of Notes and Memorialls of his owne hand, especially touching Persons. As, whom to Employ, whom to Reward, whom to Enquire of, whom to Beware of, what were the Dependencies, what were the Factions, and the like; keeping (as it were) a Iournall of his Thoughts. There is to this day a merrie Tale; That his Monkey (set on as it was thought by one of his Chamber) tore his Principall Note-Booke all to pieces, when by chance it lay forth. Whereat the Court (which liked not those Pensiue Accompts) was almost tickled with sport.
               Hee was indeed full of Apprehensions and Suspitions. But as he did easily take them, so hee did easily checke them, and master them; whereby they were not dangerous, but troubled himselfe more than others. It is true, his Thoughts were so many, as they could not well

                  alwayes stand together; but that which did good one way, did hurt another. Neither did bee at some times waigh them aright in their proportions. Certainely; that Rumour which did him so much mischiefe (That the Duke of Yorke should be saued, and aliue) was (at the first) of his owne nourishing; because hee would haue more Reason not to raigne in the Right of his Wife. Hee was Affable, and both Well and Faire-spoken; and would vse strange Sweetnesse and Blandishments of Words, where bee desired to effector perswade any thing that he tooke to heart. He was rather Studious than Learned; reading most Bookes that were of any worth in the French-tongue. Yet he vnderstood the Latine, as appeareth in that Cardinall 
                     〈◊〉
                  , and others, who could very well haue written French, did vse to write to him in Latine.
               
                  For his Pleasures, there is no Newes of them.  And yet by his Instructions to MARSIN and STI
                     ••
                  , touching the Queene of Naples, it seemeth hee could Interrogate vvell touching Beau
                     ••••
                   
                  Hee did by Pleasures, as great Princes doe by Banquets, come and looke 
                        〈◊〉
                      vpon them, and turne away. For neuer Prince was more wholly giuen to his Affaires, 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      them more of himselfe. In so much, as
                  
                  in Triumphs of Iusts, and Tourneyes, and Balles, and Masques (which they then called Disguises) hee was rather a Princely and Gentle Spectator, than seemed much to bee delighted.
               
               
                  No doubt, in him as in all men (and most of all in Kings) his Fortune wrought vpon his Nature, and his Nature vpon his Fortune. Hee attained to the Crowne, not onely from a priuate Fortune, which might indow him with Moderation; but also from the Fortune of an Exiled Man, which had quickned in him all Seedes of Obseruation and Industrie. And his Times being rather Prosperous, than Calme, had raysed his Confidence by Successe, but almost marred his Nature by Troubles. His Wisedome, by often euading from Perils, was turned rather into a Dexteritie to deliuer himselfe from Dangers, when they pressed him, than into a Prouidence to preuent and remoue them a farre off. And euen in Nature, the Sight of his Minde was like some Sights of Eyes; rather strong at hand, than to carrie a farre off. For his VVitt increased vpon the Occasion; and so much the more, if the Occasion were sharpened by Danger. Againe, whether it were the shortnesse of his Foresight, or the strength of his VVill, or the dazeling
                  
                  of his Suspitions, or what it was; Certaine it is, that the perpetuall Troubles of his Fortunes (there being no more matter out of which they grew) could not haue beene without some great Defects, and maine Errours in his Nature, Customes, and Proceedings, which hee had enough to doe to saue and helpe, with a thousand little Industries and VVatches. But those doe best appeare in the Storie it selfe. Yet take him with all his Defects, if a Man should compare him with the Kings his Concurrents, in France and Spaine, he shall finde him more Politique than LEWIS the Twelfth of France, and more Entire and Syncere than FERDINANDO of Spaine. But if you shall change LEVVIS the Twelfth, for LEVVIS the Eleuenth, who liued a little before, then the Consort is more perfect. For that LEVVIS the Eleuenth, FERDINANDO, and HENRY, may be esteemed for the Tres Magi of Kings of those Ages. To conclude, If this King did no greater Matters, it was long of himselfe; for what he minded, he compassed.
               
               
                  Hee was a Comoly Personage, a little aboue Iust Stature, well and straight limmed, but flander. His Countenance was Reuerend, and a little like a Church-man: And as it was not strange or darke, so neyther was it
                  
Winning or Pleasing, but as the Face of one well disposed. But it was to the Disaduantage of the Painter; for it was best when he spake.
               
               
                  His VVorth may beare a Tale or two, that may put vpon him somewhat that may seeme Diuine. When the Ladie MARGARET his Mother had diuerse great Sutors for Marriage, shee dreamed one Night, That one in the likenesse of a Bishop, in Pontificall habit, did tender her EDMVND Earle of Richmond (the Kings Father) for her Husband. Neyther had she euer any Child but the King, though shee had three Husbands. One day when King HENRY the Sixth (whose Innocencie gaue him Holines) was washing his hands at a great Feast, and cast his Eye vpon King HENRY, then a young Youth, he said; This is the Lad, that shall possesse quietly that, that wee now striue for. But that that was truely Diuine in him, was, that hee had the Fortune of a True Christian, as well as of a Great King, in liuing Exercised, and dying Repentant. So as hee had an happie Warrefare in both Conflicts, both of Sinne, and the Crosse.
               
                  Hee was borne at Pembrooke Castle, and lyeth buried at VVestminster, in one of the Statelyest and Daintiest Monuments
                  
of Europe, both for the Chappell, and for the Sepulchre. So that hee dwelleth more richly Dead, in the Monument of his Tombe, than hee did Aliue in Richmond, or any of his Palaces. I could wish he did the like, in this Monument of his Fame.
