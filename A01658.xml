            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

                     IT IS VVRITTEN (RIGHT Honorable and my singular good Lady) that Philip King of Macedonia reioyced greatly vvhen his sonne Alexander vvas borne, bicause his Empyre shoulde not lacke a gouernour after his death, but herein he reioyced much more, that his sonne vvas borne in the time of Aristotle that learned Philosopher, by vvhome he vvas taught and instructed ten yeares: And in lyke maner it fareth novv vvith me, as vvith the King of Macedonia, and no lesse is my ioye▪ than the delight of that mightie Prince. Herein I doe reioyce, that this vvorke of Dystillation is novve finished to the profite of my countrie, vvherein great studie and long labour hath bene earnestly bestovved. But I reioyce much more that it is finished in the time of you my Honourable, vertuous, and good Ladie, to vvhose learned vevve and fauourable protection I offer this Booke, as a due testimonie of my seruiceable heart, and as some fruites of my poore paynfull studie and practise, vvishing that it vvere in value counteruayle able to the condigne demerites of your so Honourable expectation, so as euery lyne, in respect of my loyaltie, might supplye a nevve Iewell for your Nevve yeares gift, albeit, you haue no neede of Golde and Ievvels, abounding honourably in all riches: Notvvithstanding, this booke maye be truely termed the nevve Iewell of health, vvhich before this daye vvas neuer seene or published abroade by anye other man. This nevve Iewell vvyll make the blynde to see, and the lame to vvalke. This nevv Iewell
                     
vvill make the vveake to become strong, and the olde crooked age appeare yong and lustye. This nevve Iewell vvill make the foule seeme beautifull, and the vvithered faces shevve smoothe and fayre, yea, it vvill heale all infirmities, and cure all paynes in the vvhole bodie of man. VVhat is it to haue landes and houses, to abounde in siluer and golde, to be decked vvith Pearles and Diamondes, yea, to possesse the vvhole vvorlde, and lacke health the principall Ievvell. Not vvithout cause therfore Agamemnō the vvyse and famous Captaine of the Greekes did highly esteeme and revvarde Machaon and Podalirius, by vvhose cunning skill in Chirurgerie, thousandes vvorthie Creekes vvere saued alyue, and healed, vvhich else had dyed and perished. But vvhy doe I here name Agamemnon, or the Grekes, vvhen as no age can be vvithout Phisicke, no person can lyue vvithout Chirurgerie, no countrie can mysse these noble mysteries. VVherefore I at this time to pleasure my countrie and friendes, haue published this nevve Iewell vnder your Honourable protection, that it maye more easily bee defended against Sycophants and fault finders, bicause your vvit, learning, and authoritie hath great force and strength in repressing the curious crakes of the enuious and bleating Babes of Momus charme.

            ¶ George Baker to the Reader.
            
               GEntle Reader, although I haue giuen the onset to publish in our owne naturall tongue, this most excellent worke of Distillation, for which cause, it should not be the lesse estéemed, although some more curious than wyse, estéeme of nothing but that which is most rare, or in harde and vnknowne languages. Certainly these kynde of people cannot abyde that good and laudable Artes shoulde be common to many, fearing that their name and practise should decay, or at the least shoulde diminishe. The intension truely of such persons séemeth much like them which gape for all, and woulde all haue, leauing nothing to anye body, but that which they must néedes forgo, not considering that we are not borne for our selues onely, as Plato sayth, but for the profite of our countrie. Surely, if that I did not feare to be to long in this Preface, I would prooue howe all Artes and sciences may be published in that tongue which is best vnderstanded: as for example, Hippocrates, Galen, Paulus Aegineta, Aecius, were Grecians, and wrote all in the Gréeke, to the perfect vnderstanding of their countrie men. Also Cornelius Celsus being a Latinist, wrote in the Lati
                  •
               e. Auicen and Albucrasis, Arabians, wrote in the Arabicke tongue. The eternall fame of which worthye men shall neuer be extinguished or drowned in obliuion, nor their noble works for euer be out of remembrance. For what man is as yet aliue that euer was able to counteruayle them, yea the best learned in our dayes, doe most hyest estéeme of them aboue all, without whose, workes all Phisitions in the worlde be but blynde, and not able to make any perfite Arte. Peraduenture some will obiect and saye, that if we were without their works, there are other of later wryters which shoulde suffice. To the which I will aunswere, that they haue written nothing, but that their grounde was first layde by them, &amp; further, as M. Iohn Canape D. of Phisicke sayth, I wyll giue them this gyft, except they first reade Hippocrates and Galen, they shall neuer vnderstande what they reade, nor make any perfect worke. Therefore not without good cause Guido calleth Galen the lanterne of light. And nowe in these our dayes, we sée howe other Nations doe followe their examples. For what kinde of science or knowledge euer was inuented by man, which is not nowe in the Italian or French▪ And what more prerogatiue haue they than we English men (of the which many learned men haue made sufficiēt proofe within th
                  •
               se few yeres, fully to furnish &amp; satisfie our Nation with many goodly works.) For our English is as méete &amp; necessary for vs, as is the Greeke for the Grecians, though in the translation we be constrayned to make two or three words sometyme for one. For if it were not permitted to translate but word for word, thē I say, away with all translations, yt which were great losse to the cōmon weale, considering that out of one language into another haue ben turned many most excellent works, the which the best learned haue both receyued &amp; approoued to the

singular commoditie of all men. And among all the workes which haue bene translated into our natiue tongue, I doe thinke concerning the matter, there was neuer the lyke to this as yet. For herein you shall learne the manner to separate by Arte the pure and true substance as well manifest as hidden, the which in Phisicke is a great helpe to the taking away of diseases, harde or rebellious to be cured. And moreouer, that by the Chimicall Arte, those medicines which are harde and hidden, their forces and vertues are plainly manifested and prooued, and the grosse iuyce being mingled with the subtill and fine substance, are thereby digested and separated, as we may sée by the drawing of the oyle of Golde, Iron, Copper, or Tynne. Also by Distillation are corrected the malignitie or venimous qualities therof, as in oyles of Quicksiluer, of oyle of Vitrioll, Antemonie, artificiall Saltes, and many other purging medicines. Furthermore, we sée plainely before our eyes, that the vertues of medicines by Chimicall distillation, are made more vailable, better, and of more efficacie than those medicines which are in vse, and accustomed. In tryall of the which, we doe daily prooue to our great credite, and our pacients comfort. For make tryall betwéene the one and the other, and you shall sée that the decoctions, Iuices, Syrupes, or such lyke, shall neuer come neare to the dystilled waters, Oyles, Balmes, artificiall Salts, and extraction of Rootes, leaues, flowers, and fruites, of woode, Barkes, Gummes, Mettals, and such others, so that two or thrée drops of the oyle of Sage doth more profite in the Palsie: Thrée droppes of the oyle of Corrall for the falling sickenesse: Thrée drops of the Quintessences of Pe
                  •
               rle for the Sincope or swounding: Thrée droppes of the oyle of Brimstone or Turpentine for the Astmatikes: One droppe of the oyle of Cloues, for the colde payne in the téeth: Thrée droppes of the oyle Ammoniacke for the diseases of the splene: One dramme of the water of the oyle or salt of Guaiacum, for the French poxe. One dram of the oyle of Walwort for the goute: Thrée droppes of the oyle of Iron for the Dysenteria, or other whyte fluxes: Thrée droppes of the oyle of Crystall for the stone: Thrée droppes of the oyle of Cloues or Baye berries for the Cholicke: Thrée droppes of the oyle of Antimonium for the Leprosie, doth more than one pound of those decoctions not dystilled. And another thing is to be noted, that the diseased people, principally those which are delicate, doe detest all things which doe not agree to their myndes, and delight not onely in the pleasantnesse of the taste, but also the sight of the eye, and the littlenesse of the quantitie of the medicine, the which I thinke, no man will denie. But this I will say, that thorowe the fire there is some hote qualitie in the medicine, but that qualitie is easie to be corrected, as in the administring of them are plainlye taught. Peraduenture some in the sight of the furnaces, and other vessels wyll bee lothe to meddle with so busie matters, as the preparing of the Mettalles, and drawing of Quintessences. For the which looke what excellent medicine any standeth in néede of, there be in this Citie which are most excellent in the preparing or drawing of any of them, to whom if you resort, they will

faithfully deale, among whome none to be dispraysed. I doe know some most excellent, as one mayster Kemech an Englishe man dwelling in Lothburie, another, mayster Geffray, a French man dwelling in the Crouched friers, men of singular knowledge that waye, another named Iohn Hester dwelling on Powles wharfe, the which is a paynfull traueyler in those matters, as I by proofe haue séene, and vsed of their medicines to the furtheraunce of my Pacients healthes, and also one Thomas Hyll, who for his excellent knowledge in this Arte, is not to be left out, who dyd also take paynes in this worke, but before it coulde be brought to perfection, God tooke him to his mercie: There are yet others excellent men, which for breuitie I leaue at thys present. so finishing this my simple Preface, desiring God to further the studie of all those which faithfully and truely meane in the exercyse of this so noble an Arte, desiring all those which shall finde any fault, that they will friendlye admonishe me thereof, or else to note them in the margent of their owne bookes for their priuate vse and commoditie, till such time as it shall be new printed agayne, and then if it shall please them to giue me their olde Bookes so corrected, I will deliuer them newe for them. And as for those finde faultes, which will doe nothing themselues, I wey them not, for I had rather be seruiceable to my Countrie, than to please some particular persons, as the Lorde doth knowe, who rules and guydes vs all in the right way. Amen. From my house in Bartholmewe lane beside the Royall exchaunge in London, this xxj. day of Februarye. 1576.

And they not only were first inuentors (although the worthy man Mathiolus be of a contrarie opinion, that none of the auncient Phisitions left any monument of this Arte) but by their search, diligence, and long continuance of time, endeuoured to encrease the same with many worthy secrets, and other matters right profitable: and those to none other intent and end, than for the only health and benefite of man. But Dystillation, as wryteth Ioannes Langius in his Epystles, is the seperating and running forth of a subtill moysture. First, by the force of heat into a vapour, which hanging in the head, and thickeneth after by the colde ayre, is so caused to fall downe to the Chanell or Gutter of the heade, and from thence guided to runne vnto the nose, doth on such wyse dystill by dr

                  ame, to sublyme, which signifyeth no other matter, than to seperate the partes more lyght and thynne, from those heauyer and thicker, and the working of this requireth so to doe, that the bodyes or matters whose substaunce is impure and grosse, be 
                     〈…〉
                   pure, fayre, and cleare, or the earthly partes euilly

                   and conioyned, or otherwyse ouermuch confused, and shedde through all the substance of the Bodies, be drawne, gathered, and better fixed togither, in such maner, that those seperated by heate, eche may abyde a part at the bottome of the Lymbecke.
               An other Chymiste (as it shoulde séeme of more experience) doth define this maner of working to sublyme, on this wyse, that the same (being a seconde degrée very principall vnto the ch
                     ••
                  nging of many naturall matters) serueth to seperate the thynne and pure partes, from the grosse and heauie substaunces, as Distillation doth: so that thro
                     •
                  gh this doing, is the aptest substance of the grosser Bodies extenuated and fyned, that is, the thynnest, lightest, and purest part, from the superficiall matter, being next to the grosser substance of the Bodie, raysed and drawne vp to the heade by force of the heate: next to which, are those partes, that in purenesse nyghest agrée to the first substance: so that the thirde and last matter being both heauyest and grossest, and contayning the earthly parts in it, requireth then a mightyer force and stronger heate of fire, through which, the same so seperateth

and sendeth forth wholye all the liquide matter or substance yet remayning, which throughly drawne forth, there doth after remayne none other, than a substance wholy drye (muche like to ashes) in the bottome of the Cucurbite or Glasse body: Insomuch that out of euery moyst substance, or Bodie by distillation, there is a certaine crude or rawe waterishnesse, or rather Flegmaticke matter, at the first sent forth, next to which, by diligence, is a substance drawne forth, rather better digested, and purer: and last, a matter of Oylynesse, drawne forth by the stronger heate of fire: By which may euidently appeare, that not only out of massie partes, but euen out of Bones, by Sublimation, may a lyke matter be had and gotten: although certaine moyst
                     •
                   partes there are so light, and thynne of substaunce, that these in a maner sende vp (by the heate of fire) their whole moysture and strength at the first drawing: Such moist substances and licours are gotten without ayde of the Sunnes heate, the fire, or any putrifying, as through the dropping caused by a Lyste, or péece of Woollen cloth, cut and fashioned into the forme of a Tongue, which maner of dooing (the Chymistes name Fyltring) or otherwise by a Spunge, Strayner, Ipocras bagge, fine Searse, rawe earthen Potte or Panne, through which anye moyst substaunce may eyther distill or droppe, as the lyke is thought and hath bene tryed by an Iuie vessell made of the woode for the onely purpose, through which, wyne soketh or distilleth, lyke to sweating drops, leauing behinde onely the water that tofore was myxt with the wyne, yet such a drawing of moystures or lycours, ought not properly to be named a Distillation, but rather the same maye rightly be termed a Distilling, when a Cucurbite or Glasse Bodie filled with Flowers, and set into Sande, doth by the mightie heate of the Sunne, yéelde forth a lycour or water, by little and little, into a receyuer, fastened or luted (after Arte) to the nose of the Lymbecke, which as Mathiolus wryteth, sauoureth neare to the smell of the Flowers, through the gentle and easie drawing of that heate: But if you mynde to distill a moyst substance or any other thing, in an Earthen, Tynne, Glasse, or Copper Bodie tynned within, set into a Furnace, then prepare before fine sifted sande or ashes, for your Bodie to stand in halfe couered (in a maner:)

Or thus, let your Bodie be set into the Sande, that thrée partes appeare frée and aboue the Sande, and the heade to haue a long necked Receyuer, aptly luted or fastened to the Nose, that

the same retching a good distance from the heate of the fire, may thereby yéelde and sende forth the more plentie of moysture, drawne by force of heate of the fire, which raysed of the same into a vapour extenuated, and this agayne thickned through the coldnesse of Ayre compassing the heade, is on such wise conuerted into a lycour, which from thence by droppes falling into the Chanell or Gutter of the heade, doth so distill and runne forth by the Nose into a long necked Receyuer standing vnder, and this we properly name a Distillation: Or thus, Distillation (as writeth the former Fumanellus in his Booke of the Composition of Medicines) is the drawing or running forth of a thynner and purer humour by little and little, or droppe by droppe, by force of the heate, out of the iuice or thicke substance contained in the Cucurbite, or other vessell, for the onelye purpose: through which, as by a certaine Boyling, is a separation and ascention, caused of many matters mixed togither, and the drawing forth sometimes of certaine secrete matters and hidde properties, into one speciall substance gathered and thickened into a water or other thinne

licour, properly in the heade, which, after distilling downe into the Receyuer, serueth for the commoditie and vse of sundrie griefes and sickenesses. Not vnlyke wryteth Iohannes Mesue, where he affirmeth that many matters of sundrie kyndes conteyned, and as they were congealed into one bodie, in the Cucurbite or Glasse bodie, are by force of the heate separated, in working, according to the industrie of the Chymistes, and Distillers of Quintessence. And for troth such Ascentions, Distillations, or Sublimations of Bodies, are not wholy a water, nor thorowly an oylie or vnctuous licour, but a certaine substance sufficiently differing from the same matter, which tofore you had put and mixed togither, to be distilled. In this place it is not to be forgotten, nor ouerpassed, that this worde to Sublyme, may be vsed in an other signification with the Chymistes: as when they mention of Mercurie sublymed. &amp;c. The signification of which, shall after at large be taught. And although yt in euery Distillation, many &amp; diuers considerations are necessary to be learned, yet ought these two things to be specially regarded at all tymes of euery workman (which foreséene at the beginning of the work, that the industrious Artificer be diligent to compasse and bryng to an ende the same) the one is the matter which he myndeth to deale withall, as to finde and trie out of what condition the same is, and whether of hys owne nature it is proper to indure, or doe: The other is to such ende, that the worke which is pretended, may come to a good and happy successe: and then is required to choose and make readie, séemely and apt vessels. If the Dystiller will carefully consider and haue regarde vnto these two poyntes (as méete and right it is) then néedeth he not to doubt, but that he shall bring his worke vnto the same perfection and desired ende, which he hopeth after: For as in the vniuersall or generall nature of thinges in this worlde, all Bodies are not made and formed indifferently of euery sort and condition of matter, nor the Craftesman can indifferently cut out &amp; carue the ymage of Mercurie, of euery woode (as by many &amp; singular reasons the learned Phisitions do perswade and prooue to vs) but all things are made &amp; formed of a certayne matter, apt and proportioned to receyue a forme appointed, by the meanes &amp; aide of many causes; euen so in

this Chymicall Arte, it behooueth him which wyll drawe out of any matter, Oyle, or water, or any other lyke thing, that he afore knowe the matter, if the same be such, as he maye hope to drawe forth of it, a Water or Oyle, or any other lyke thing: after to searche and choose those Instrumentes or vesselles for the worke, which séemeth apte
                     ••
                   for the turne, and according to hys desire: That if a man woulde Distill any matter, which is destitute or lacking, the same moisture or licour that he searcheth and hopeth after: what is it any other thing (I pray you) than to desire wooll from an Asses backe, or to wryng water out of a Pummyse stone, (which two, are well knowne) to be matters impossible to be attayned. Wherefore séeing that all mixt Bodies, be constituted and formed of the foure Elements: and that among those, the one more partaketh of the Ayre, the other more of the water, some more of the fire; others more of the earth, according to the necessitie of ech compounde predominant and gouerning: for which cause it behooueth to regard, and diligently to consider in eche Bodie, what Element surmounteth the other: These well considered, it shall be an easie matter by force of the fire, to separate and drawe a water out of those substances, which are of nature waterie: as also with lyke easinesse it is possible to drawe an Oyle, by the Arte of Distillation, out of others that be of qualitie Aeriall or fierie: For the heate of the fire is such, that it gathereth togither those things which are of like kinde and nature, &amp; separateth such as be disagréeing. There be also many Bodies or substances that be earthly and drie, out of which, to draw a water or Oyle, is not onely harde to be done, but is altogither impossible: yet are there some Bodies or substances, out of which, a water doth easilye distill, as all such matters which shall be moyste and waterie: Others there are, out of which, an Oyle may be drawne, but no water at all, as all those substaunces or Bodies, which be very tough and harde through drynesse.
               Howe often the vertues of certaine substantiall partes are lost, or chaunged in the Distillations, and why that Distillation came but of later tyme into vse: this borowed of the learned Ioannes Langius.
               
            
            
               
               The seconde Chapter.
               
                  NO Person néedeth to doubt, that all Bodies which growe and take increasement in the earth, are compounded of diuers, and in a maner, infinite small parts (which ye Gréekes properly name Atomes) of the Elements, and that in those rest differing and contrarie vertues: neuerthelesse, vnder one maner of forme of all the Bodies compounded: as the lyke appeareth, and is confirmed in that roote of Rubarbe, so much regarded and estéemed in all places, which doth both loose the Bellie, and bynde the same, yet this deliuereth and openeth the obstructions and stoppinges of the Liuer. The same also is knowne to be in the iuice of Roses, which purgeth the bellye of Choler, where contrarywise, the distilled water, and the drye powder of the leaues, doe bynde and harden the Belly: the lyke to this is found in the bitternesse of the nayles, or white endes of the leaues, which boyled and applyed vp in Glyster forme (after the mynde of the learned Mathiolus) doth mightily stay the fluxe of the Belly, and by giuing it to drinke, this healeth the perillous vlcers of the Lunges: The yelowe séedes within the Rose, and the heares hanging to them, boyled in Wyne, and drunke, doth staye (as he affirmeth) the styllings downe to the Gummes, and marueylously helpeth the running of the Whites in women. He also reporteth that the whole heads of the Rose sodden in Wyne, and drunke, helpeth the fluxe of the Bellie, and stayeth the spitting or casting vp of bloude: the séedes within the peares of the Rose, are knowen (of experience) to be astringent, for which cause, the yelowe, and all the whole Peares sodden in wyne, doth greatly profite the fluxe of the Bellie, and such abundance of the Whytes in women, yea, marueylously stayeth the tedious Gonorrhea, these hitherto Mathiolus. And is it not euidentlye séene and knowne, that the outwarde part of the Nettle procureth ytching and burning, in that part of the bodie, as the same toucheth: where contrarywise, the iuice drawen out of the inner substance, applyed on the arteries of the armes, doth refresh and

coole the burning of the Feuer, or feuerous burning of the heart: Besides, dryed and brought into powder, and giuen to a maryed man to eate, causeth him after to loue dearely his wyfe and children: and the same vsed, fortifieth the veneriall acte, and purgeth the Matrix in women, by the dayly eating in meate: yea, wasshyng the Bodie with the decoction of it, mitigateth all paynes caused of colde, and healeth scabbes. And doe we not daylye vnderstande &amp; sée, that out of one

                  olten and separated in the Furnace, diuers kyndes of Mettals, that is, of Leade, of Siluer, Copper, &amp; Golde, of which always the greater part is conuerted into Fumes. When therefore after in the Distillation, the grosser and excrementuous partes abyde in the bottome of the Lymbecke, then doe the Aereall vanysh into spirits, and the moysture thickened through the cooling of the couer or heade of the Lymbecke, fall from the Gutter of the heade, and runne downe drop by droppe into a Receyuer standing vnder. It is not to be marueyled at, if distilled waters doe not yéelde their proper sauour, taste, and all other vertues, or but little that they ought, of those matters, out of which they are distilled. For which cause the learned Phisition Mesue reporteth, that the water drawne by distillation out of Roses, doth greatly comfort and strengthen: yet doth the same nor lyke loose and purge the bodie, as the iuice gotten out of the freshe Roses, or the infusion of them done after Arte, by reason that their subtill heate vanisheth with the fire. To these adde, that the hydde or secrete propertie which procéedeth of the forme (that the Phisitions terme particular) as in the Lode stone, Colocynthis, Scamonie, and others lyke, equally shedde throughout the whole substaunce of his subiect, insomuch that when the forces and vertues be lost of the other partes of the subiect, it cannot then retayne his proper strength, but that hys action and working perysheth: as by a lyke the water distilled by a Lymbeck of the Colocynthis, or Rubarbe, cannot then loose or purge the Belly: where the lycour at all times, or either of them infused for certayne houres, and ministred, will easily perfourme the lyke working. By the same maner, all herbes of a hote and drie qualitie, doe yéelde or giue forth in their Distillation, the best

waters of propertie, kéeping neuerthelesse their naturall heate and drynesse: but the herbes colde and moyste, doe not reteyne so well their coldenesse and moysture, by reason they attayne or purchase a certayne straunge heate of the fire of the Lymbecke, which abateth and taketh awaye from the waters their proper nature and vertue: so that the same water, which is distilled, doth not any thing reteyne, or but little of the nature and vertue of that simple, out of which it is distilled. Whereof it commeth to passe, that although the waters of Endyue, Lettuce, or Nightshade, are accustomed or woont to coole: yet doe these alwayes performe the same but a little: where otherwyse, if these kept the proper qualities of the Herbes, from which they are distilled, woulde then greatly coole: to the ende that the Herbes, the same which are of temperature 
                     〈◊〉
                  , maye kéepe their proper qualities, they ought rather to be

If at anye time, the distilled waters are more agréeable and pleasanter in taste, than the decoctions of the Herbes: it behooueth to vnderstande, that these loose lesser of their moysture and coldnesse (in that they néede but a temperate fire) if they be distilled in the Furnace, named

By the same discourse eche man may easily conceiue and iudge, that all formes cannot wholy resist and doe their workings a long tyme in mixt bodies, if the qualities abyde not perfite and hole. For which cause, it is no marueyle, if the waters of Plants and Iuices, especiallye those which are distilled, by a drie heate of fire: doe disagrée, and seuer from the vertues of their Simples: which for troth more troubled, and mooued rather the skilfull to be abashed, than the ignoraunt Phisitions, and caused that a long tyme after it was, or they anye thing (to purpose) attempted to put in vse Distilled waters: yet others, for to recompence the default, which they knewe to be in them, sought out and practised many wayes, how and by what meanes these might best retayne and kéepe their vertues after the Distilling. But among the Arabians, the Noble Mesue first made mention of Sublimation or Distillation of ye waters of Wormwoode and Roses. For, sayth he, water of Wormewoode is distilled after the maner as is out of Roses, and such lyke, which are done in vesselles of Sublimation. But in processe of tyme, when Rhasis, Serapio, and Auicen, had taken in hande the practise of Alchymie: then began these waters to be vsed in Phisicke.
            
            
               Of the kyndes and differences of Distillations. The thirde Chapter.
               
                  FOrasmuch as we haue sufficiently vttered in the first Chapter, that the Bodies which we desire to separate by Distillation, are not of one nature and qualitie: yet it often commeth to passe, that some lightly suffer, and others resist mightilye, through the action of the causes agent, and these yéelde not, but by a great force and violence: so that not without

good occasion, the first inuentors of the Arte of Distilling, and their successors, which made a matter of the sayde Arte, deuised diuers kyndes of Distilling, according to the diuersitie of things proper to be distilled, by the meanes of which, they might the more easily come vnto the intended scope which they purposed. Agayne, séeing it is certaine, that for the diuersitie of the kyndes and fashions of Distilling, there néedeth diuers instrumentes proper and commodious to eche fashion of Distilling. Good reason it is (in my opinion) that we intreate of the kyndes of Distillations, before we make mention of the Instruments.
               Séeing that euery Distillation is done by the resolution and separation of the substantiall partes, through the force of the outwarde heate: The Chymicke Authours haue purposed two wayes, and the rule certayne of the sayde separation. For they vnderstoode and knewe by reason and experience, that some Bodies or substances, with greater payne doe yéelde or sende forth a lycour: and others more easilye, and with lesser traueyle. For which cause they inuented one maner verye easie, and another harder, and with greater payne, according to the necessitie and condicion of the matter or substaunce to be drawne. The one of

these they woulde to be done in the Discending, which the Latine

Chymistes terme, per Descensum: the other in the Ascending, of the Latynes named per Ascensum: so that for eche of these, they gaue the same apte names. By this reason we saye in generall, that euery Distillation to be done in the Descending, or in the Ascending, so that eyther of these two wayes are to be applied i
                     •
                  differently to these things that a man woulde distill: and according as eche person may herein be perswaded, after the capacitie of his wytte, or by experience. But the oftner Distillation that is exercysed in the Ascending, is done of the séedes of Herbes, which spread into bredth, bearing flowers &amp; séedes, as the Annise, the Dill, the Fennel, &amp; such others. In like maner of the fragrant and comfortable spices, the Teares, Gummes, Rosins, &amp; lycors. For those which are done in the Descending, or by Discention, are the oyles drawen out of ye woodes of Iuniper trée, Aloe, Guaicum, Ashe, Tamaricke, Medler trée, Pyne trée. &amp;c. although true it is, that sundrie waters are distilled into the Descending, or by Discention, as those of Roses, Flowers, and tender Herbes. &amp;c.
               Further, although that the Chymisticke Authors doe teache and shewe diuers fashions of Distilling by Ascention, yet maye all these ways &amp; fashions be brought into thrée orders, according to the difference of the cause agent or efficient, which is heate.
               The first maner is, when we distill any liquide substance or flowers in the Sunne by force of his heate. The seconde, when the Distillation is done, by force of the heate of fire. The thirde is perfourmed by the

heate, which consisteth in putrified and rotten matters or substaunces, of which particularlye, and by order, we shall after intreat.
               First, the Distillation that is done in the Sunne, when the vessell or Lymbecke of Glasse filled with the matter, which a man woulde distill, is set fully in the hote Sunne

on fine sifted Sande or Ashes hote, to the nose of which, is a receyuer hanging or fastened: But this maner of Distillyng in Englande and Germanie, and in colde Countries, cannot so well be perfourmed. Yet sundrie Chymistes are woont to prepare manye Oyles by Sunning, that is, by setting them in the hote Sunne, which perhaps maye more commodiouser be prepared and done by decoction, to the ende that the facultie and propertie of the Symples maye the better be drawne forth by a stronger heate.
               Secondlye, there be manye maners and wayes of drawing forth waters and Oyles of compounde thinges, by the vehemencie &amp; force of the heate of fire. For eyther the thinges to be distilled, are put vp or closed simply in a Cucurbite or Retort (which are instruments of Glasse for distilling, beyng large at the bottome) and set ouer the heate of fire: or the same substance closed

vppe in a Cucurbite or Glasse bodie, set into that Furnace named Balneum Mariae, or else bestowed in sifted Ashes, or fine Sande, a desired Lycour is drawne forth, by force of the drye heate of fire put vnder. This maner of Distilling, as it is verye excellent, and euery where vsed: euen so is the same moste at large set forth, as in the instructions following, shall further be

learned.
               Thirdly, the forme of Distilling by Ascention, is done in Distillatorie vessels, filled with the purposed medicines or substances, déepe set, or standing couered, in a heape or little hyll of newe pressed Grapes with the Kirnelles, or in the refuse of Olyues, after the Oyle pressed forth, or in Horse, or other Cattels dung. For by the rotten heate of any of these kyndes, being one and the selfesame continuall for certayne dayes. The Chymistes not onlye purge and separate their Quintessences, by a small labour and cost, but infuse in a Glasse bodie (with a narrowe necke and mouth, for a long tyme) their singular Medicines and Balmes, with Oyle, Aqua vitae, or other Lycoure, with which they affirme to cure diuers desperate diseases and sickenesses. They also affirme by the sayde forme of Distilling, that certaine waters maye be attayned for the restoring of youth, and prolonging of lyfe, and I cannot tell what maner of Defensatiues, and worthy Drinckes (sayth Ioannes Langius in his Epistles) for expelling of the Plague, and all maner of poysons, to which as they gaue the name of Golde, or termed Golden: euen so they woulde those to be rewarded with gyftes of Golde. And these thrée manners of Distilling, may by good right be named Sublimations, bicause these make their vapors to ascende on high.
               
               The other forme and maner of Distilling, which the Chymistes often haue in vsage, named of Albertus by Discention, is wrought or done on this wyse, a round hole and déepe, must be dygged in the earth, after two Potts prepared, glased within for the onely purpose, the vpper Pot, hauing manye small hoales in the bottome, and that filled wyth the matter or chyppes of the woode to be distilled, which after sette into the mouth of the nether Potte, standing in the grounde, luting diligently

Which done, make an easie fire at the first rounde about the vpper Potte with coales, or drie clouen woode, not smoking (least with too stronge a heate at the first, you drie vp much of the lycour or Oyle in the Dystilling, therfore increase the fire by little and little, vntill the worke be ended. For as soone as the woode or thyppes in the vpper pot shall be heated, the Oyle or lycour then beginneth to distill through the little holes into the nether Potte. And by this maner or waye, d

               Of the Instruments or vessels which serue to the Dystillations. The .iiij. Chapter.
               
                  ALthough that all maner of Dystillations, may diuersly be performed, according to the iudgement and industrie of the Distillatour, and according to the pleasure and opinion of eche person: yet euermore the workman &amp; Practiser, howe ingeniouser and better aduysed he shall be, so much the more carefully and diligently he ought to searche before all things, the same which he knoweth to be necessarie for the guyding and perfourming of the worke happily. And he shall in lyke maner weye, and consider in his mynde, what Instrumentes are for him more commodious for Dystilling, before that he taketh in hande or begynneth the worke of Dystilling. Nowe of the Instrumentes, some are in generall, and for the same cause▪ require all one maner of Distillation, which is the heate. But the others are particular, appoynted onely to certaine fashions of Distilling, which

are these, Infusion, Putrifaction, Fermentation, the Furnace

                        •
                      of cutting the neckes of diuers Glasses, when néede requyreth, with the apt Instrumentes seruing to that vse, shall hereafter appeare. First with that stone (which the Glasiers vse) being set into some handle, drawe about the necke of the Glasse, in the same place where you couet to breake it of. After the Instrument formed, hauing thrée or foure edges, according

to the figure here described) and the same made glowing hote, worke about the raced place vnto the time it be through hote. After by dypping your finger in water, and letting a droppe or two fall, the Glasse incontinent will cracke in the sayde place marked: and drawing after that instrument (which we haue aboue demonstrated) rounde about, you may lightly breake of the p
                        •
                     ece without daunger to the Glasse. The lyke of this haue I knowne to be wrought with a poynted Diamonde set in a Ring: but a waxed thréede was fastened about that place, by which (the Diamonde guided) shoulde runne, for the strayghter and euener racing of the Glasse, which done in such order, and the place heated hote rounde about with the flame of a waxe Candle, or other Candle, if a man will, was sodainlye cracked through the falling of a droppe or two of colde water, on the place marked. Another more easie waye to cut Glasse, haue I knowne experienced with a bygge Wyer wreathed rounde at the one ende (like to a Ring) which heated glowing hote, and turned often rounde on the place marked, caused the Glasse (through his heating) by a droppe or two of colde water falling on it, to cracke about the sayde raced place. Some vse to breake off the necks of Retorts,

with a double waxed thréede twisted hard, and made in the forme of a Ring, which put harde on the necke, they heate the same rounde about with the flame of a waxe Candle, and by pouring a drop or two of water on the place, the Glasse is caused to cracke.
                  And some vse other Instruments lyke to those before descrybed, which heated glowynge hote, after they drawe sundrye tymes about the place of the Glasse raced, and doe the rest aboue taught.
                  If you couet to seale vppe or shutte close the mouthes of narrowe necked Glasses, that no vapours or spirites maye breath forth, and that these maye appeare to be whole on euerye part, then prepare a little Furnace (lyke to this here descrybed) in

whose bottome let a Grate of Iron bee coutched, wyth a hoale made in the side aboue the Grate, to thruste in the necke of the Glasse, and retching vp to the top of the Furnace, set a strong payre of Tonges, and broade at the ende, which done, and the necke of the Glasse made hote, wryng with the glowing Tonges the Glasse togither, then sweating by occasion of the heate, which shall so be vnited at the top, as the same there were whole, or that it séemed lyke as it were closed togither in the Glasse makers shoppe.
               
            
            
               Of the heate being the Instrument in generall, necessarie to all kyndes and formes of Distilling. The fift Chapter.
               EVery Distillation is especially perfourmed and done by two wayes or meanes: as the first by heate and Drynesse, and

the other by heate and moysture. And of both these, there are thrée degrées constituted: the first is of gentle heate, or of qualitie weake: the seconde more strong, yet with some mediocritie: the thirde heate is mightie and violent. Therefore it behooueth to gouerne the fire, and to moderate the same, according to the nature and qualitie that the skilfull may haue, of the thing or substance which he would distill: Herein not neglecting how much &amp; howe little the seconde and thirde qualities are to be moderated. Wherefore those, which are of a tender and thynne substaunce, as the Lettuce, Endyue, Sorrell, Maydenheare, Harts tongue, and such lyke Symples, doe not endure a heate but moderate, and which is of the first degrée: those which are thick and grosse, and of a substance more firme and solide, as the Wormewoode, Mugwoort, Egrimonie, Sothernwoode, the Aromaticke things, the Spyces, and others lyke, require a heate more mightie. The Antimonie contrarywyse, and all kyndes of Mettals, desire one maner of fire. By the heate moderate, in the Distillation of Wyne, and all Herbes, doe the watrie partes ascende: but by the heate more mightie and violent, doe the thynner partes onely shewe, and the watrie tarie behynde. Further conceyue, that the flame it selfe as well as the Coales, doe not a little differ, not by reason only of the same being greater or lesser, but by occasion of the woodes rottennesse, or yll smelling, or otherwyse sounde and well smelling, gréene or dry. To these, the greatnesse or smalnesse of the Furnace: the forme and closing of it, hath a great force in chaunging or altering of the heate. The Coales also made of smothered and halfe burnt woode, yéelde a certaine yll 
                     •
                  auour and straunge qualitie in the thynges distilled: as the lyke in boyling, and otherwyse preparing of matters with them is perceyued. For which cause the Coales ought to be thorow kyndled, and halfe burnt, whereby the malignitie or yll sauour of them, maye (in the dooing) breath forth, before that anye matter be distilled with them, to be ministred especially into the Bodye, were the same outwarde applyed, it forceth not so much. There is as great a matter to be considered in the difference of Coales: for that the Coales made of the woode growing in the valleyes are supposed to be woorthyer and farre better, than those made of

the woode on the Hlles: and the woode in the valleys is the thynner, for which cause are the Coales the lyke, yet doth the fire lyghtly and soone waste all thynne matters. And in makyng the

best Coales, they ought not to be done vnder the Grounde (as the custome of many is) but made aboue the Earth, for that they burne better, and are more profitable. Also the Coales made of the Béeche, Birche, and Fyrre trée, are accounted best, for their swéeter and sooner burning, although Coles of the Iuniper trée, doe last farre longer, as of experience knowne: besides, the Coales made of the Oke and Ashe trée, are not in cases of necessitie to be refused, especially where the store of the Béeche, and other trées are not. Moreouer, it behooueth the Distillatour to haue a speciall regarde and care about the bestowing of fire vnder hys vessels, that the same be not made of cleft woode halfe rotten, or euill smelling (as we haue aboue declared) nor of Coales smoothered within a déepe pit or hole of the Earth, or euill burned, or of Coales gotten out of Caues, whether those be of Stone, or of Earth, for feare that the vessels of Distilling, and the lycours be not taynted and infected of their vapour, filthie and stynking. A lyke reason may be gathered, that if waters or Oyles be distilled with any of those, they after purchase a sauour and qualitie

disagréeing, yea, farre vnlyke the substances that are to be distylled, as the same maye well be perceyued and tasted, by the matter boyled with any of them. Further, the Chambers, Parlours, Stoues, Hote houses, heated wyth such woode or Coales, doe sufficiently witnesse howe noyous and hurtfull such a vapour and sauour is, which not onely bryngeth an intollerable payne of the heade, but mooueth vomiting, and causeth passions of the heart, to those which be conuersant and abyde any tyme in such places: as I the lyke (sayeth the worthie Gesnerus) haue experienced in my selfe, to the perill of my health, at the Bathes of Oenosponte, where I abode a certayne season with the Noble Prince Palatine. Of the lyke occasion Galene séemed worthilye to reprehende Erasistratus, which perceyued that the inhabitants of his Countrie to peryshe, through the ouermuch subtilnesse or thyckenesse of the ayre. He also learned and knewe that these came much sooner to their death, by reason of the excéeding déepe Caues and Pyttes of Charon, which breathed forth pestilent exhalations and vapors: or through their houses newlye plastered, and whytened with Lyme: or for the euill sauour of the Coales, which sent forth vapors verye daungerous: this out of Ioannes Langius. It is besides reported, that many are molested by the stynking sweate of the féete, after the shooes newly shyfted of in any close roome, whether the same be Parlour or Chamber: but affirmed to be more daungerous, where Coales burning in any close roume, breath forth a stincking sauour: yet some there are of a contrarie opinion, which suppose that neyther the fume, nor fauour of the Coales burning, can any thing harme nor alter the matters which a man distilleth, when the Cucurbite (or Glasse Bodie with his heade) is well luted and stopped rounde about, according vnto Arte: but that sooner the vapour may be annnoyance to the Distillatour, and to those which gouerne the Distillation, than to the matters which any distilleth.
            
            
               Of the other Instruments particular. The sixt Chapter.
               THere are other Instrumentes, by which the qualitie fierye, is encreased, or diminished in the Distillation, whyche

is the cause that the Dystyllation is made or done, sometymes by meanes of the hote vapoure of boyling water, as Manardus in his Epystles instructeth: sometymes through the

                  
                     •
                  elpe of boyling water, when as the Glasse bodie standeth in that Bath, named Balneum Mariae: sometymes by a drye meanes, as by sifted Ashes, fine Sande, small Stones finely grounde, fylings, or drosse of soft mettals, sometymes by these thyngs mixed togyther, as when water is mixed with the Sande. In such maner the Distillation is not wholye wrought or done in the Bathe named Balneum Mariae, nor yet onely in Sande. There are some which wylleth a quantitie of sande to be myxed with the water of Balneum Mariae, to the intent the heate may be the greater, and more vehement: for in such a maner of Distillation, maye twoo waters be obtayned, as the first thynne and waterie, the other more redde and thycker, as the learned Mathiolus reporteth. To these it behooueth to note, that the Distillation which is done with the fine syfted powder of Bryckes or Tylestones, is the better and more sure of all others, according to the iudgement of some skylfull persons, for that it nourisheth and mayntayneth equally the heate, and breaketh not so lightly and soone the Glasse bodies: which two thyngs are verye necessarie in Distillations: But of

all these varieties, we mynde at large to intreate in the particular Distillations, and to shewe in what, and when it is néedefull to vse nowe the one, and nowe the other meanes.
               For the Distillation of matters, sometymes the infusion is necessarye, sometimes

the Putrifaction, sometymes the grynding of things, and other lyke preparations.
               The infusions by whyche the dryer matters are prepared to distill, for the more easie drawing forth the Water or Oyle: are done eyther in simple water labored, that is, running by pypes a long way: or in water dystilled, or in water of Lyfe, or Wyne, or in water distilled of Herbes simply, or vinegar, or in any other lycour: on such wyse infused, let them stande and abyde in the hote Sunne, or on the fire, for the space of halfe an houre, or more houres, a whole night, a whole daye, twoo dayes, thrée dayes, one, or many Monethes, accordyng to the nature of the medicine, and diuers intention of the Phisition, and necessitie present. We wring out sometymes before the Distillation the thyngs infused, and distill the lycour wrynged forth, or the same we distill in a Glasse body, or other like Instrument, the infusion altogither, that is, the same which is infused, and the lycour in which the infusion is made.
               The waters and Oyles which are drawne forth of pleasaunt Spyces, ought to be done by infusion in simple water, not in Wyne, nor in Aqua vitae, for that these doe ouer spéedily ascende, and carie not with them the force and vertue of the Aromaticke

Spyces: but the simple water, (in a contrary maner) ascendeth not, without carying with it the Aromaticke vertue. Sometimes we put to putrifie the thyngs to be Distilled, and after that they

are putrified, we distill them: although that sometimes the same putrifaction is a kynde of Distillation, as we haue afore vttered, and shall after intreate more at large in the proper place.
               The Fermentation of matters, is done after the maner of infusions, by an outwarde heate increased, which worketh into moysture, whereby a certayne common qualitie with the hote spirite causing bubbles, may be myxed and extended thorowout the whole bodye: and this eyther wrought in the Sunnes great heate at the Dogge dayes (if the Sunnes heate in the meane tyme, be not sufficient) or on the Furnace of Balneo Mariae, carefully gouerned, or in hote Horse dung. The Fermentation hath néede of many dayes, as of foure or more: and howe much the better shall the Fermentation and preparation be done, somuch the greater quantitie shall a man drawe forth of water or Oyle.

                  IT is not our determination nor purpose at this present to declare at length, but a part of the Instruments materiall, which serue for Chymistes workinges to Distill the water and Oyles: séeing that many Authors haue at large intreated of all these: It shall suffice vs to make mention of some more rare Instruments in generall, and to set forth duers fashions of Distilling; not knowne to manye, as shall after appeare in this first Booke.
               The best and most commodious forme of a Furnace, among all others, is the same (which within) is rounde all about: whether the same be buylt into length and squarenesse, with a conuenient bredth, for the better contayning of sundrie bodies togyther, or as many as you wyll. And after the maner of one, maye you frame sundrie furnaces of lyke condicion. For the buylding of this Furnace, whether it be one alone, or sundrie togither (to serue as well for Balneo, as Sande or sifted Ashes) it behooueth

to choose vnbaked Bryckes and Tyles, yet those very well dried and hardened in the Sunne, for that they are more tractable and

softer than the baked, and that a man maye better cutte them with the yron Trowell or lyke instrument, to frame them into what forme he will: the hollowe hole within (reaching to the grounde) ought to be so large as the Earthen Panne not baked, or of Copper, maye stande or hang to the bryncke in it, whose forme shall be broade aboue and narrowe beneath (after the maner

of the Iellyflower Potte with vs, hauing a large edge) the bottome of the Potte to staye or stande on a little barre fixed ouerthwart in the walles, and in eche corner a little hole for the breathing forth of the fume, as the lyke in all Furnaces are made: let the thyckenesse of the walles be framed more or lesse, according as you shall thynke necessarye. For how much the thicker the compasse about, or walles shall be, so much the more heate they retayne wythin. The vnbaked Bryckes ought first to be layde in a moyst place, as in a Celler, to the ende that those maye more easily be cut and fashioned, with the edge of the Trowell, or some other apt Instrument of yron. The Bryckes ought so to be couched and layde one vpon another, that the ioynts (in the lying of them) méete not, but are vnequall, as the ende of one reaching to the myddle of another: for by the same maner couched, the buylding and walles shall be the stronger. The Bryckes and Tyles shall be ioyned or couched with Morter made of the fattest Cley, myxed with a quantitie of Woollen flockes (shoren off broade Clothes or Carsies) and newe Horse dunge well stamped togyther, and that the Morter be tempered in water verye saltie, when any will vse and occupie of the same. A certayne Chymist teacheth another maner of making common Lute for the strong erecting of all maner of Furnaces, and the Philosophers tower, which is on this wyse. Take of Cley being clammie and tough, to which 
                     •
                  dde or put a little Sande or fyne Grauell, after myxe Woollen flockes and Horse dung, so much as shall suffyce, and labour diligently the whole togither, that the same maye rather be soft, than styffe or harde, and this he nameth a Lute common,

for all Furnaces. The lute of wysedome, with which the Chymistes dawbe their Glasse bodies, for to resist a mightie heate of fire, shall after be taught in that Chapter, where we mynde to intreate at large of all maner of Lutes for the distilling Instruments. The forme of which long Furnace, beholde here vnder lyuely descrybed to the eye.
               
               The description of another Furnace, to be vsed as well for Oyles, as other Lycours, and Mynerall waters done by Sublimation, which may on such wyse be buylt, that the same
                     •
                  maye be remooued from place to place, in any chamber, or other roome of the house: if the foundation of the vnbaked Brycke and Tyles be cowched on a square thycke Planckeboorde with foure féete, (marked with the letter G.) and the walles (of a sufficient thycknesse) raysed two foote high, with Brickes mortered in the forme aboue taught. After this, that the roumes wythin be made, a foote distaunt one from the other. Which done, to make an Arch doore beneath, (marked with A.) where the Ashes falling from the Coales, may be drawen or gotten forth. Aboue the same (a foote distant) another doore made, (noted with this letter B.) opening

aboue the Grate, and the Grate figured with the letter D. on which the Coales ougth to lye, and the entrance of this doore néedeth to be no larger, than that a man maye hardlye thrust in his hande. Aboue this, that two small barres of Iron (marked with E.) be fixed a crosse, or but one onely, and those to serue for the stronger staying of the Panne or Potte. Towards the toppe in eche corner aboue (marked with F.) that foure ventes or breathing holes be made, and into the largest hole in the middle (marked with H.) a Panne set (being broade aboue and narrowe beneath) reaching to the crosse barre, and the edge about mortered strongly, that no heate of fire passe forth, betwéene the heade of

the Panne and Furnace: after to poure into it water, if a man myndeth to distill herbes, Rootes, or other tender thinges. But contrarywise, Oyles or other matters, yt requyre a myghtier heate: then to put in fine sifted Sande or Ashes, and to begynne your Dystilling. The forme of this Furnace seruing for one Cucurbite or Glasse body, is here liuely described.
               Also if a man will builde a rounde Furnace, it behooueth him to place the vent holes about, to ryse from the bottome of the Panne, and the Cucurbite, of Glasse, Tynne, or thynne Copper well tynned within, to be set halfe full of lycour into the Panne,

about which two or thrée narrow bands of leade to be hanged on with a cloth, that the Bodie start not vp through the moouing of the water. This done, laye two halfe couers of Leade (cutte iust in the myddes) in such maner, that these close in the Glasse bodie, whereby the heate of the séething water maye the commodiouser abyde, and longer continue. On the bodye (being eyther T
                     •
                  nne or Copper) set on a Glasse head (which is accounted best) for the sight of the lycour, and the same so close about with fine Lynnen clothes, that no vapors at all may breath forth, and the Receyuer of pure Glasse set to it, that the water Distilling, may runne into it, being lyke luted to the nose of the Heade. And this kynde of Furnace wrought with water, is named Balneum Mariae: but working with a drye heate (as in Ashes or Sande) there néedeth no such halfe couers to guyde or staye vp the bodye. The Cucurbite and heade may wholy be made of Tynne, which are more commodious, in that the Glasse bodye is lightly broken through heate, and to much colde. In

manye rounde Furnaces, the Grate hath eyght or nyne ouerthwart barres of Iron, that the Ashes may the cōmodiouser fall thorowe: and this Grate ought to be made according to the proportion of the Furnace, that it maye agrée most aptlye to the roundenesse and largenesse of the same. The pan (wheth
                     •
                  r the same be of Copper or Earth) ought to be of a lyke depth and breadth (although it shall be commodious, that the depth be somewhat more than the bredth) with a Pype standing out at the toppe, by which the hote water maye runne forth, without harme to the Furnace. And this Copper Panne ought so to be set into the Furnace, that it hangeth well a spanne distant from the Grate vnderneath.
               The Tower of the Philosophers, is a Furnace that hardlye can be learned by wordes, nor by long wryting, wythout full sight of the same in the buylding: for if any happeneth to sée the whole making of it, yet maye he fayle to co
                     •
                  ceyue and vnderstande the secret consisting in it, in that there are many thynges

in it, framed and made after such maner, that a man may hardly attayne to the knowledge of them. But to declare wholy (and to thende) howe the same is to be made, and that anye conceyueth this my wryting and demonstration, to his profite be it, and he that vnderstandeth not the same, to his harme be it. The maner of erecting and framing of the sayd Tower, is on this wyse, that the foundation be laide foure square with rawe or baked Bricks, on a playne and euen grounde, and thrée foote broade on euerye side, and that a hollowe space (in crosse maner) be left, to the bredth of a baked Bricke, and of heygth so much, as is the heygth of the sayde Bricke in largenesse set on edge: and this Pype or Gutter, is the same, where the fire or flame passeth, and ouer the myddes of the sayde crosse Pype, lay an iron Grate, and aboue the same buylde a rounde Furnace of a spanne in breadth, and a yarde and a halfe of heygth: and this is named the Tower, and to the fower holes (appearing forth) buylde and frame in like maner fower little Furnaces rounde, but lower than the hoales, and without little Grates of iron in them: that the fire or flame may passe by those pipes, &amp; enter within the sayd small furnaces, on which, may be placed or set Glasse bodies, Retortes, or other vessels. When you will bestowe Coales, and make fire in the myddle Tower, doe the same after this maner, that is, take kindled coales, and put them in at the bottome of the Tower, and after fill vp the sayd Tower with dead or vnkindled coales: and shut close aboue with a couer of Iron, the head of the tower, that no ayre breath forth: for by this dooyng, the fire shall burne only belowe, so much as the pypes which extende to the Furnaces can receyue, and no more: and on such wyse, in a Tower of this greatnesse full of Coales, will the fire indure twelue or fourtéene houres, without putting in of any Coale. With this Tower may a man Distill, Circulate, drye vp, and Sublyme, with great facilitie: And this is the Philosophers Tower aboue named, which serueth, and is very necessarie in the Arte of Alchymie.
               Another skilfull Chymist, teacheth a very ingenious maner of Distilling, by which a man may with one onely fire drawe togither, and all at one tyme, both Water and Oyle, besides the commoditie of Sublyming, and Distilling by Balneo Mariae: and

this is named a Distillation in the tower, by reason of the forme of the Furnace, or rather named the Philosophers Tower, for great commodities of the same, which is made after this maner: that is, in any playne and euen grounde, let the forme of a tower be buylt, eyther rounde or square, or fixe cornered, or of some other forme, with vnbaked or baked Bryckes, and in heygth about a yarde and a halfe, or twoo or three, or so hygh and large as a man pleaseth, in such condicion alwayes, that the same maye receyue and contayne a fire sufficient great and burning: In the sayde Tower, distant from the ground, about a handbredth and a halfe, let be layde a Grate of iron, which maye beare vppe the Coales, with a wyndowe or square hole, by which the ayre may enter to kyndle the Coales. After that done, let be buylt of eyther side, and round about the tower, many Furnaces regarding the outwarde face of the tower, of such a bygnesse as he thinketh good and necessarie, and of such heygth from the ground, as answereth aptly to the Grate of iron, which shall be in the myddes of the tower, and on eche side of the tower, which shall be in the myddes of these Furnaces, let holes be made sufficient great, and somewhat higher than the Grate of iron, to the ende, that by those the heate of the fire might be communicated and extended to the Furnaces. These Furnaces ought to be buylt after the forme of the Bulwarkes of a warrelike Towne: to eche of the holes running and extending within the Tower, before that the Furnaces are set or ioyned too, ought a Plate or Register of Iron to be made, boared with thrée, or sixe holes, or more, and those of lyke greatnesse and distance, one directly aboue the other: to the ende, that those maye be drawne wholye forth of the Furnace, when néede shall require the same, or thrust downe so déepe, as the Chymist woulde that the force of the fire to extende to the Furnaces without, whether the same be by two or thrée, or one onely hole, or by the great or least hole: At the toppe of the myddle Tower, ought there to be made lyke to a vaulte, by which the Furnace or the tower may be exactly closed, to the ende that the ai
                     •
                  e which entreth by the lower part of the Tower, may not breath and yssue out by the toppe: and this after such maner alwayes guyded, that those may be drawne vp, and put downe agayne, according

as he shall thynke néedefull. The things on such wyse prepared, the holl
                     •
                  we place of the Tower in the myddes, ought to be filled with Coales, and the toppe close shutte or stopped wyth the couer, to be strongly luted or mortered rounde about. At the hole or doore belowe shall he put in the fire, for by that meanes the Coales which shall be nearer the sayde holes, wyll be consumed by the fire, and on such wyse consumed, that those which shall be at the toppe of the Tower, shrynking and falling downe by little and little, kyndle and burne one after the other, and in the lyke maner doe the others consequently burne, vntill all shall be kyndled and wasted. The person which will occupie such a fashion, and the lyke Furnaces to distill in, it shall suffice that he visite or looke to his fire once in the daye. Such a buylding is not only ingenious and delectable to beholde, but also very commodious and necessarie. I haue séene sometymes (sayth the Chymist) that a Balneum Mariae, hath bene placed on the sayde buylding, or toppe of the Tower, and a vessell to Sublyme: besides a Furnace for Reuerberating, and Cymenting, and a Furnace for Melting, according as a man may learne &amp; know, by the figure herevnder descrybed. Another Furnace I sawe of meaner cost in the building,

which had a Tower in the myddes, lyke to this abouesayd,

being foure square, and very playne of workemanship, at whose corners were foure vessels placed, as at eche corner one, and Registers made for them, as to the other Furnaces afore descrybed: so that little differing in vses, sauing in the forme and bewtie, for which cause, this Furnace is to be ordered in all poynts lyke to the aforesayde: in gouerning the Registers, and heate of the fire, that this may easier be conceyued, I haue ioyned it with the figure before descrybed, as the same maye euidentlye appéere on the other side to the eye, borowed both out of the singular worke, intituled Pirotechnia.
               
               The sayde Chymist in his worke of Pirotechnia, descrybeth two other Furnaces, seruing to sundrie vses: the one to be built after this maner: That is, a square Turret to be raysed wyth Bryckes, and the same made rounde wythin, the hole for the drawing forth of the Ashes, to be halfe a foote from the foundation, aboue which (nygh a foote) thrée or foure small Barres to be layde (in the forme of a Grate) well a finger bredth distant one from the other, that the Ashes may the lightlyer fall through, for hyndring of the fire to burne and gyue his heate, on this Grate all about laye Tyles in handsome maner, leauing but a hands bredth vncouered, for the fire to burne through: after this, about a foote higher, make your Ouen open in the toppe, but in fashion lyke to the Bakers Ouen, which leaue hollowe downewarde to the Grate, that the Coles in the nether Ouen (hauing a lesser mouth than the vpper) kyndled, may burne and flame vp: to the mouth of this nether Ouen, must a doore be set, whereby it may be opened for the putting in and taking out of Coales, &amp; shutting the same agayne, when néede shall require: but the mouth of the vpper and greater, must alwayes be left open, for the flame to passe forth: ouer the inner mouth of this greater Ouen, must two Iron barres more be layde, so wyde one from the other, that a man may handsomelye set on them a melting Crucible, or other vessell to calcyne withall, as it behooueth: Ouer the head of this square Turret remayning open, must so large a slate stone be layde, as may wholy couer the same, yet may you not make fast the slate with morter, to the heade or top of the Ouen or Turret, in that when néede requireth, the same is to be taken of. After

all these done, the Ouen must (within and without) be well playstred with fast and strong Lyme, that the same chop not, which perfourmed, the Furnace is then finished. The Crucible with the matter that you woulde calcyne, shall you sette on the Iron Barres, and laye downe the Slate close on the Ouens heade: after kyndle fire in the nether Ouen, that the flame extending vp, and about the Crucible, maye so passe forth of the mouth of the

vpper Ouen, for on such wyse, it calcyneth the better, in that the flame must burne about the matter, before it extendeth forth of the mouth of the Ouen. The vses of these two Ouens, are for the calcyning of Metalline Bodies, or other Mixtures, which are lyke calcyned, as the Saltes, and all maner of stones. And without the lyke Furnaces, may a man performe no work, where as calcination néedeth: for if hée shall attempt to calc
                     •
                  ne Bodies by another meanes, it wil be very hard to bring to passe: wherfore the Philosophers at the first, inuented such a Furnace, for the lyke intent and purpose, and named it properly the Furnace of Reuerberation for calcyning, and cymenting.
               The other Furnace made rounde and hollow to the bottome, differeth but little from the abouesayde, sauing that this in the working, is left open and vncouered at the toppe for the fumes to passe forth: neare to the bottome must a square hole be formed, and a doore to the same, whereby the fire by it maye so be gouerned, that the same maye be increased great or small, as néede shall requyre. Aboue this, a Grate of Iron for the Coles to burne vpon, and vent holes rounde about, for the ayre to come in, aswell as the heade remayning all open for the large passing forth of the smoke: which otherwyse woulde not burne, for the lacke of vent holes to let the smoke passe, that séeketh yssue forth,

so that nothing séemeth, nor is more enimie to the fire, than the smoke. And for this reason, if Furnaces had not their ventes of breathing holes, it were not possible that they coulde worke or doe their effect: and if these in like maner had not their breathing forth belowe, the fire with great difficultie woulde burne: for which cause, it behooueth to haue breathing holes on eyther side, that the Furnace maye worke with more easinesse. The vessell standing on the Grate ought to be well defended with lute round about, before the Coales be poured vppon to kyndle and burne: the doore of the same requireth to be opened reasonable wyde for a tyme, to thende the fire maye kyndle &amp; burne the fréelyer, and the smoke passe forth at the toppe. The Furnace thus finished, serueth as well for the

Distilling of waters and oyles (by the help of a Panne set on the heade, and filled wyth Sande or water) as for Sublyming, and the melting of Mynerals: for which cause the Aucthour thought good (by reasō of their profytable vses) to place them by the waye a part, that their formes liuely descrybed to the eye, might the easier and perfiter be conceyued of all parsons.
               A commended Furnace for distiling of the Oyle of Vitríoll, and other Oyles, is made after this maner: First, with baked Brickes and Tyles a foundation layde foure square, on which, a wall raysed a foote high, or thereabout, and a doore made belowe for the drawing forth of Ashes: aboue this (wythin the Furnace) a Grate couched of the sayde heygth, distant from the bottome a foote and a halfe, or thereabout. After this, bestowe ouerthwarte the myddle of the same, a long &amp; sufficient stronge Barre of yron, mortered with the best Lute, and that it extendeth from one side vnto another of the Furnace. Betwéene the Grate and the sayd

Barre of Iron, frame of the one side of the Furnace, a slowe Harrie, euen as the figure following demonstrateth: Which ought to be of such a greatnesse, that a man maye in a manner thrust in his heade. The things thus prepared readie, set forward the building of the Furnace of the Barre of Iron, vnto the heygth of a foote and a halfe, and leaue it on such wyse open, vntill you haue bestowed the Glasse, in which the Vitrioll is conteyned. Here conceyue, that the side of the Furnace towarde the flowe Harrie, ought to be left open from the Grate, vnto the top of it, vntill such tyme as the Glasse is bestowed within the Furnace. The Furnace thus buylt and prepared in a readynesse, set in the Glasse strongly fenced with Lute, and filled with the prepared substance, of that side of the Furnace which remayneth open: in such maner place it within, that the bottome staying on the yron Barre, the neck may be caused to bende downwarde, so much as may be, in the ouerthwart standing of it in the furnace: But not so much downward, that ye substance in the Glasse may spill forth. The necke of the Retorte (if you will drawe the Oyle of Vytrioll) ought to lye or extende forth, nigh halfe a foote, to the ende that it may after be verye well luted and fastened with the Receyuer hanging without. The thinges on such wyse prepared, close vp all that part open of the Furnace, from the Grate vnto the toppe of it, and conioyne with Morter by the same meanes very diligently, the Glasse with the Furnace. After that (in this closing vp) you are come vnto the top, make a great hole at one of the foure corners, of the greatnesse of an Egge, and a couer formed to it, that the same may be set on and taken away, when néede requireth, at the other thrée corners, make in lyke manner ventes or breathing holes, but those much lesser (
                     〈◊〉
                   so small) that a man can not put in his thumbe at any of the

                  ▪ 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   this, he must by little and little close vp the Furnace, and fashion the same (from the holes) narrower and narrower, vntill he come vnto the toppe, where he must fashion a rounde hole of suche a greatnesse, that a manne maye easily put in his hande, to which hole prepare in lyke maner a couer, that a manne maye stoppe and open the hole, when he lusteth. After that you haue thus buylt the Furnace, and in the same bestowed the Glasse, as is aaforesayde.

It shall be requisite and néedefull, to haue another great Glasse, able to receyue and holde eight or ten measures of lycour (to be as the receyuing vessell) which he shall verye well fasten with the necke of the Bodie hanging without, after such manner, that the necke of this be entred sufficient déepe into the Receyuer: which twoo on such wyse ordered, lute diligentlye (rounde about) with the strongest lute, as the common manner is. But the figure following shall shewe to the eye all the sayde description of the Furnace, and the vesselles before mentioned. In which it behooueth to note, that the slowe Harrie ought not so exactly to extende vnto, and touche the Iron Grate: but sufficient it shall be, if the same caryeth the Coales thither, or to the Grate. A. representeth the doore, by which the Ayre entreth to nourishe and mayntayne the fire. B. the grate of Iron which sustayneth or beareth the Coales. C. the slowe Harrie, by which the Coales are poured in. D. the place where is layde the long

Barre of Iron, which beareth the Bodie. E. the neck of the Bodie lying forth, whiche bendeth downewarde. F. representeth the great vessell receiuing. G. the vent or breathing holes, situated in the .iiij. angles or corners. H. the great hole, whiche is formed on the toppe of the Furnace. I. the couer seruinge for the greater hoale on the toppe.
               After that the thinges shall be on

such wyse prepared, lette the Furnace be heated with the fire of Coales, and the slowe Harrie filled vp with great Coales: which done, shut or stoppe close with his couer the vpper hole, and lyke the other vent holes, except the thrée little ones afore mentioned. At the same tyme, shutte or put to halfe the doore, which is placed vnder the Grate, marked with the letter A. by reason of the ayre, for to preserue the fire. &amp;c.
               The other vesselles which commonly serue in the Arte of Distilling, and be put in vse euery where, as well for matters of Alchymie, as the drawing of medicinable things, which are all maner of Waters, Oyles, Baulmes, Aqua vitae, Quintessences, and all other compounde matters, shall after be liuely demonstrated: and the maner howe to order them in the distilling of things, with the apt names for eche vessell, and the formes, shall in order be faithfully set forth.
               First,

this Instrumēt or Vessell, is named a Crooked Body or Retort: and where alwayes mencion is made of a Retort, there is ment a Vessell of suche a forme, whether the same be great or small, according as it shall séeme to the workeman, that it is agréeable for the qualitie, and quantitie of the matter, that he woulde distill with such a kind of Vessell as this is: And in such a kinde of Vessell, the Chymistes distill matters that are vnctuous, which not so aptly sublyme, or ascende on high: as all the kyndes of waters, that are easily distylled with a Cucurbite and heade, bycause these sublyme with much easinesse: wherefore the things vnctuous and heauie, that cannot sublyme or ascende, but with great difficultie, are distilled with this maner of Vessell, in that the same hath but a short and small rysing, before the passing and falling into the Receyuer, and for that cause, this is a Vessell verye

commodious and necessarie in such an Arte, as to ech person may well appeare, by working with the same.
               
               Thys Vessell is named the Glasse body with a long necke, and where at any time is mentioned of a Body (which in Latine is named Cucurbita) there this Vessell is vnderstanded and ment, whether the same be greater or lesse, according as the workeman shall thynke necessary: and this is a Vessell common, muche occupyed of them which Dystill diuers matters in the Arte: and thys is as much vsed for Phisicke matters, as for the working of Alchymie: So that this commeth to occupying often, as a thyng most commodious, for the dooyng of all manner of workinges in a maner, and maye as well serue for a Receyuer, as for a Bodie to dystill withall: Of which, it maye be sayde, that thys is a principall Vessell in the Arte of Dystilling, seruing (as it doth) for two Vessels, and beyng commodious in so many things, so that more néedeth not to be spoken of it. Wherefore we wyll procéede to descrybe herevnder, that Vessell, which (of the Chymistes) is named a Heade, without the which a man can not distill anye matter by the Cucurbite or Bodie of Glasse, as after shall playner appeare.
               
               This Vessell named a Heade, is well knowne to most persons, and in the Arte of Dystilling verye necessarie: Bycause (as I haue aforesayd) it is impossible, that a man maye distill any thing without it: and

of such Vessels, the workeman maye choose or cause to be made wyth narrower and larger mouthes, according to the condicion of the Bodie standing vnder, yet these requyre to be fashioned all after one manner, and the lyke to be made with one manner of Nose: which Nose requyreth to be after thys maner, that is, fashioned long, and that (put in) it maye reach a good way into the Receyuer, for by entring very déepe in the Dystilling, and the spirites yssuing out of the Bodie, will not be so apt to passe forth of the Receyuer: for thys cause the sayde heade will be much better when the Nose shall be formed long: herein considering that it hath the lyke similitude, wyth the Nose of the Heade, here afore descrybed, and being on suche wyse fashioned, it is a perfite Vessell, for the Distilling of tender and Flegmaticke matters.
               This

Vesselle (the Chimystes name) ye Vrinall, whyche but little differeth from the Cucurbite (afore described) as to the eie, may euidently be perceyued: for there is no other difference, sauing that the Vrinall is formed with a larger necke and mouth, than the Cucurbite hath: and this made the lyke, for that intent, whereby a man myght dystill wyth more facilitie: for by this, the vapors ascende farre better on hygh, through the large head set vpon, lyke to the same afore described. And into thys vessell may the workman put his hande, to drawe out the matter remayning, which resteth at the bottome, without losing of the Vessell: when a man dystilleth not those thyngs, which it behooueth hym to burne, and to rest cleauing to the bottome, so that when the workeman néedeth not to dystill those thyngs, whych requyre a drying vp: in such a case (the contrarie) may he clense the Vrinall, and make it serue for another tyme, yea, for many tymes. In this Vessell may a man

dystill Herbes, Wyne, Flowers, Honie, Waxe, and all other matters, that he thyncketh may aptly be dystilled: for the workeman may order and apply it, in a manner to all woorkyngs, that he woulde attempt to doe, as well in Alchymie, as in Phisicke matters: so that this Vrinall Bodie, is a Vessell very necessary, as we haue afore declared.
               
               This Instrument named the Pellicane, which is a Vessell for Circulating, serueth to none other ende and purpose, than for to Circulate the Quintessence, which by the Arte of dystilling is drawen: so that thys Vessell on such wyse made, is not apt for the dystilling of any matter, but only serueth for the Circulating of Aqua vitae, and other compounde lycours. Where in anye place you find written to be done in a Pellicane, the same is ment to be wrought in the sayde Vessell: and in all the Arte, there is no other kynde of Vessels, that are more necessarie than these fiue, whych we haue afore descrybed, although many other Vessels, and of those diuers are occupyed of sundrye Chymistes, yet all consist and serue to the lyke woorkyng, which the aboue named doe, that is, the Retorte, the narrowe necked Bodie, the Heade, the Vrinall, and Pellicane, wyth which a man may doe all maner of workes that are required in the Arte, as Dystillations, Sublimations, Fixations, Circulations, and other lyke woorkyngs. And for that cause I thynke it not néedefull to make a long description of so manye straunge sortes, as of those long, short, rounde, square, and so dyuers formes, which rather are occupyed to marueyle at, than for vtilitie or profite: But I thys affirme, t
                     •
                  at these fiue Instrumentes to be the fundament of the whole Arte of Distilling, and Alchymie, as I haue afore declared. Therfore let it not mooue you to marueyle at so many sortes of Glasses that manye Chymistes vse, whych for this respect, I leaue to demonstrate in thys place.
               
                  
                  
               
               This is a Bagge which the Chimistes make of whyte Woollen cloth (whether the same be Pennystone or Karsie) shaped and sowen after this manner, and name it a Fylter. And it is a verye necessarye thing, in that a man can not woorke in a manner, anye thynge without it, that consisteth thycke: and in any place whereas a man findeth wrytten to dystill by Fylter, the same is ment to be in thys Instrument, which he shall lyke do when the matters are dissolued into water, for to cleare them from their Faecies, that they maye remayne neate and purified: which maner of Purifying, he shall woorke and doe after this order, that is, when the matter shall be dissolued, it behooueth vs to poure the same into thys Bagge, letting it passe and runne through by it selfe, which passed through (by this maner of dystilling) wyll be most cleare and pure, and this is named the dystillation by Fylter, that also is verye necessarye in the woorke of Alchymie, and the Apothecaries besides doe often vse this maner of Dystilling, for to separate dyuers matters, as are the Iuleps, Syrupes, Decoctions, Iuices of Herbes, and other Infusions, whereby they might come purified and neate: and in thys dooing, there is nothing that maye hynder their woorking: wherefore if such matters were not sufficiently purged, they woulde soone fall to putrifying and corrupting: which they doe not, being well Fyltred, and cléered thorowe the Bagge: As by a lyke in that Syrupe, which compounded of the Iuice of soure Cytrone, ought first to be dystilled by the Bagge aboue descrybed, or by a Lyste put into the Lycour: for this otherwyse curdeth, when it shall be colde: and the lyke doth the Iuice of Orenges and Lemmons, beyng not ordered as abouesayde.
               The other Instruments necessary for dystillation, not afore

descrybed, shall after be liuely demonstrated, and their vses orderly taught, borowed out of Adamus Louicerus, of Dystillation. The Instruments (sayth he) whose vse is required vnto Dystillation, are made of diuers matter, as of Glasse, Earth, or Mettals. But the Instruments of Glasse, doe excell all others, and for that cause are warily to be vsed: therefore for a more safegarde of the Glasse, the Chymistes wyll to draw ouer it, a hose or Cote of vnshoren clothe (which resisteth by that meanes, the stronger heate of Balneo Mariae) and after the Dystillation it maye be drawen of, and the Vessell made cleane. Such mynding to dystill by a drye heate of fire in Ashes or Sande, ought afore to fence their Instruments wyth the Lute of wysedome, made of Cley, Horsedung, Salt &amp; Flocks: but of thys Lute shall more at large be vttered, in the proper place hereafter. The sayde Instruments are to be formed of the best Earth that maye be founde in anye Countrie, for these in many causes are much commended, so that they be occupyed wyth heades of Glasse, for they be better, séeing that through them the matter as it is in 
                     •
                  ystilling, may be séene, as it is before declared. Wherefore who so is mynded to make Dystillation of Arsenick, Orepment, Cinnaber, Mercurie, Sulpher, or any such lyke Bodyes, he must remember afore to buyld a common Furnace for dystilling, rounde or square, according to

                  
the wyll of the Dystillatour, and that two rounde holes of a finger bygnesse, be made of eche side the Furnace, for the venting or breathing forth of the fire. These done, on the mouth or myddle hollowe place of the Furnace, shall you bestowe a déepe Earthen panne, filled wyth fine sifted Sande or Ashes, for the staying vpryght of the Glasse Bodie: vnder the bottome of whych Panne, let be cowched an yron Barre ouerthwart or crosse the hole, retching from thone side to thother, for the stronger bearyng of the weyght of the Panne: and the lyppes of the Panne so stronglye mortered wyth the head of the Furnace, that the fire breath not forth, betwéene the Earthen panne and the Furnace. After this, put in Coales by the myddle doore, and kyndle the fire, whiche ought to be at the first gentle and soft, vnto the tyme that the Furnace waxeth hote, and that the matter contayned in the Bodie beginneth to dissolue and melt. After may a manne encrease and fortifie the heate more and more, for so long tyme as that he séeth not rysing any more fumes, by the mouth of the Bodye, otherwyse named a Gourde or Cucurbite.
               As touching the Copper Vessels, sayd in an Empericke Chymist, that there néedeth no tynning of them wythin: bycause the Tynning draweth somewhat to it of the Waters and Oyles,

which hanging to, so consumeth the more, that the Copper Vessels

simply doe not.
               The Cucurbites or Glasse bodies ought sometymes to be verye long necked, as when we séeke and couet a purer and subtiller lycour: Which sort of most long necked Bodies (as wryteth Cardane) serue for the onely turne and purpose of dystilling the Quintessence, when as we woulde that the subtiller partes or spirites, and not the grosser and more earthlye, to ascende from the bottome of the Cucurbite or Glasse Bodie.
               In the tyme of dystilling any substaunce, a man must nowe and then coole the Lymbecke or heade of the Glasse, wyth Lynnen clothes dypped or wette in meane colde water, and those after the gentle wrynging forth, to lappe wittily about the Heade, that the vapors and spirites (through the same dooing) maye the sooner thicken and fall downe into the Gutter about: But a man maye auoyde this labour and traueyle, if he ordereth the Lymbecke or heade of the Cucurbite, after the manner which the skylfull Louicerus descrybeth in his Treatyse of the Arte of Dystilling, vnder these wordes.
               
               Choose a Vessell of Copper, hauing the forme of an Helmet, for so it is named of ye Germanes, or of a Limbeck (which is the Couer or Heade of a Distillatorie Vessell) as the same is here marked here wyth the figure B. Aloft the sayd Lymbeck, put another round Couer (hauing an hoale on the top) of the fashion which the letter A. here demōstrateth, that it toucheth nothing at all the aforesayde Couer or Lymbeck, whych fill with colde water, that the compasse about of the couer C. may refresh &amp; coole the neck and gutter of the Limbeck. The nose of the Limbeck must retch through the necke of this Couer that cooleth, as the figure C. playner sheweth. And if it commeth to passe, that the water contayned in the Couer, which compasseth the Lymbecke or Heade, be hote through the continuance of tyme, of the heate of the Lymbecke, drawe the same forth by the Tappe or Cocke fastned to the bottome of the Couer, as the figure D. here demonstrateth, and into it poure other colde water: thys so often

coole and drawe by the Cocke, vntill the woorke be ended. Or you 
may put certayne drawing pypes into the Couer, such as you sée here liuely descrybed, which wythin short tyme will draw forth al the hote water of the Couer, by putting the shorter ende into the hole of the Couer: after into it poure cold water, dooing the lyke (when néede requyreth) as aboue taught. He further setteth forth, another maner of cooling the heade of the Lymbecke, on this wyse: put an Oxe bladder on the Helmet, which drawne aloft, tye hard and close with a sure Corde, about the necke of the 
                     ••
                  mbecke: thys done, poure colde water into it, filling the same rounde about the necke and Gutter of the Lymbecke, which being come hote by heate of the Lymbecke, emptie by the Tappé fastened in the Bladder: after fill the same agayne, and doe the lyke, as aboue taught. Herein remembring that the toppe of the Bladder, be fastened with a string, for the better retayning of the water.

Such manner of coolinge profite and auayle very much, when any draweth forth by Dystillation of the Symples, pure, and tender, which are the Flowers, Herbes, Rootes, and Fruites, yea, the Aqua vitae, and separating of the Quintessence. Some there are of a contrarie opinion and mynde, which in no maner wyll agrée to the drawing of a Cappe aloft the Helmet, nor to anye outwarde cooling of the Heade, nor Nose of the Lymbecke, bycause that such coolinges repulse and put backe the Oyles ascending on hygh, and cause them to fall into the Cucurbite or Glasse Bodie, from whence they ascended and came, that afterwarde they can no more be eleuated, nor yet brought into a vapour, but drye and

waste awaye in the Bodie.
               The Beake or Nose of the heade, ought not to be longer (for the more part) than from twelue vnto eyghtene ynches of the Thumbe, before that it toucheth the water: where otherwyse if the Gutter be longer, as well the Oyles as the Waters shoulde consume somewhat the more.
            
            
               The maner of Dystilling in the Sunne. The .viij. Chapter.
               
                  THe singular man Adam Louicer in hys treatyse of the Arte of Dystilling, setteth forth an easie maner of Dystilling by the heate of the Sunne beames, which also may be vsed (howsoeuer a man wyll) in colde Countries: if so be he myndeth at all tymes to dystill Flowers, and such lyke matters, to the ende that those maye retayne their sauour and other qualities. And the same is to be wrought on this wyse: take (sayth Louicer) a hollowe burning Glasse, which directlye place towarde the hote beames of the Sunne, after (betwéene the Beames of the Sunne, and the burning Glasse) set the Glasse Bodie filled with the Flowers or other lyke matter (and to stand in a small Earthen panne of sifted Sande or Ashes) in such maner,

that the Beames of the hote Sunne fallyng into the hollowe Glasse, maye so beate backe and extende to the Glasse Bodie with the proper matter (as to the obiect standing ryght agaynst) whych so causeth that lighter and purer matter ascending, to Dystill forth, as more liuely appeareth by this figure here descrybed.
               
                  T
                     •
                  e Italians haue inuented another maner and way of Dystilling waters in the Sunne, which wyth them is often vsed after this maner. They take two Glasse Bodies wyth narrowe

neckes and mouthes, the one being emptie, and the other filled with Herbes or Flowers. Thys Glasse so filled, they close or 
                     ••
                  op with a fine Lynnen cloth (bounde about) through which the lycour may aptly passe or dystill. After that, they thrust the necke of this Glasse, into the necke of the emptie Glasse standing vnder, and then diligently ferment and stop the passages and wayes rounde about, with Lute or Potters Claye, or other lyke matter, to the ende, that no vapour nor vertue of the substance may breathe forth: This done, set these twoo Glasses on such wyse ioyned and bounde togyther in the beames of the Sunne, after such maner, that the same Glasse which conteyneth the Herbes or Flowers, maye séeme to be aboue, and the other whych is emptie, to stande vnder, for to receyue the lycour which is heated and decocted by the Sunnes force, that so dystilleth downe into the Glasse. And on such wyse, doe the women of Bononie in Lumbardie, prepare and purchase the water of Bremble flowers, for the benefit and singular comfort of the eyes. As touching another maner or waye of Dystilling in the Sunne, reade hereafter in the proper place taught.
            
            
               The maner of Dystilling by Ascention, and what especially behooueth to be obserued in the sayde working. The .ix. Chapter.
               
                  WE haue afore taught, that the Dystillation, whyche is a separation of the subtill partes from the grosser and heauyer, to be wrought &amp; done especially after two meanes &amp;

wayes, as by the Ascending and Descending. Further, of the same which is wrought in the Ascending, is one waye done, in that named Balneum Mariae: in another manner by Ashes or Sande, another way in Horse dung, and in another manner, by another meane heate seruing betwéene these. This by the waye in euery Dystillation ought to be obserued (that how often Oyles especially are to be drawne out of substances) that the Dystillation in the meane tyme, be in no maner hyndered or stayde. For if this Dystillation begun, be once letted, insomuch that the matter or substaunce be cooled, the woorke or Dystillation after can neuer be perfourmed, in that the same can no more ascende. For which cause, it behooueth that this woorking or Distillation, be diligently and carefully followed vnto the ende.
            
            
               The maner very commodious, for the retayning without great payne and impediment, that the Cucurbites flote or swymme not aloft the Kettle or Panne full of hote water, when any myndeth to Dystill in Balneo Mariae. The .x. Chapter.
               
                  TO doe the lyke, prepare an Earthen Vessell, or déepe Potte glased wythin, and the same so large, that it maye well receyue or contayne the Cucurbite, which it behooueth you to fill with water (in a maner to the brynke) at ye bottome of which, within let foure Tyles be layde, as the one lying right

agaynst the other, and those formed with certaine rysinges boared through, to the ende that by the holes of ech of th
                     •
                  se eminencies or rysings vp, a corde or string maye passe, after thys forme in a maner here described: After you haue thus put through the cordes

in ech hole, place the Cucurbite in the mydle of the Tyles, before that you poure in the water (as afore taught) &amp; after the same maner tye the said Corde rounde about the neck of the Cucurbite, to which equally fasten the foure small cordes tyed &amp; retching from the foure tyles lying in the bottome of the vessell, after such maner, that these foure cordes may be loosed or stiffned, and fastened shorter or longer, according as the woorkeman wyll haue, that the Cucurbite or Glasse bodie to stande déeper, or hygher in the Water. And by this meanes maye the Cucurbite be commodiouslye retayned, which otherwyse woulde not so well be stayed vnder the water. But if the Cucurbite shall be of Copper, and not of Earth, in the steade or place of that coarde, which compasseth the necke of the Cucurbyte maye a man bestowe and fasten a Copper bande, hauing foure small Rynges hanging equidistant, to which eche Corde retching (from the bottome of the Vessell) may easily be tyed: and on such wyse, shall the Cucurbite or Bozia be stayed in the bottome of the Vessell, as the same figure aforesayde, liuely demonstrateth to the eye.
            
            
               Howe a great yeelde and quantitie of waters, may with a small cost, fewe Instrumentes or Vessels, and in a very short tyme, be dystilled in Balneo Mariae. The .xi. Chapter.
               
                  IF the necessitie present be suche, that anye hath to make a great quantitie of waters dystilled in Balneo Mariae, he may accomplyshe the same with small charge
                     •
                  , little payne, fewe Instruments, and in shorte tyme, such a yéelde and quantitie as he woulde haue by this meanes▪ in preparing a Wooden bowle or Tubbe, of a sufficient compasse and largenesse ouer, and placed on a forme or Benche being lyke made of woode: in the myddes of which Tubbe, erect and set from the bottome vnto the edge or bryncke of the same (or rather aboue it) a great Copper Vessell, in the forme of a hollowe pype, sufficient large, bored wythout rounde about, and all ouer with little holes. Vnder the bottome of the Tubbe, make a Furnace, within

which emptie part or space, let a part of the Copper Pype descende, in such sort and maner, that the water be contayned

betwéene the outwarde bored wall of the Pype, and the parte within of the Tubbe: But wythin that part of the Pype, which descendeth by the bottome of the Tub, let the fire be put and kyndled, for the heating of the water, which being in such wyse handled and done, round about the Pype, and in the rest of the space of the Tubbe which is full of Water, let many Lymbeckes with their Helmets be placed (after such maner) that the Beakes and Noses may reach beyonde the edge of the Tubbe rounde about, for the easier and handsommer setting to, and fastening of the Receyuing vessels. The water wythin the Tubbe must he cause so long to séeth, vnto the tyme all the matters and substances in the Cucurbites, be wholy dystilled. The forme of makyng the abouesayd Balneum Mariae, is borowed out of that skilfull worke named Pirotechnia, which in Englysh is called the Arte of Firie workes, or working by fire.

It séemeth vndoubtedly (sayth the woorthie Gesnerus) the same to be the better fashion of all others, for the Dystilling in Balneo Mariae, but much more commodious, than if the fire were putte vnder the Dystilling vesselles, Consider and marke the other forme, lyke in a maner to this, hereafter among the Oyles.

               TAke foure or fiue measures of the best whyte wine, or of simple water, or of Maye dewe, or of other lycour pure, according

to the greatnesse and largenesse of the Bozia or Cucurbite, in such sort, that a thirde part of the Glasse bodie remayne emptie: which done, set the Lymbecke or Heade on the Vessell, fast luted about, with the whytes of Egges Flowre or Meale, and water myxed togither, and spred on a Lynnen cloth: the Bodie

of Glasse on such wyse trymmed and prepared, let be set into Balneum Mariae, after dystilling by a small or most soft fire, daye and night, vntill the tyme that the fiue measures be come to the one halfe, the same keepe, that you haue thus dystilled fo

                   the extractions: you shall haue a signe or note certayne of the perfite Dystillation of the Quintessence, if you cast a heare of the Eye browe into the same, and that it sinketh or falleth to the bottome incontinent: then haue you brought the Quintessence to a perfection, commodious, and apt for other Dystillations. The lyke may you bring to passe and doe with water

                   earthly spirites, ascende not on hygh. The same Dystillation must be repeated fiue or seauen tymes ouer, or so often, vntill that it be perfite. And such a fashion or way séemeth verie excellent: for that the sa

                  e infecteth nothing at all the extractions (infused in it) wyth anye

straunge qualitie: you shall also obtayne a water wyth expedition, if on any iuyce or lycour heated, you set a Goblet or Bowle of Glasse, into which the fume ascended, turneth it selfe into sweating drops, and those drops gathered togither of the sweatings, are on such wyse conuerted into water. By the lyke meanes and waye, is the Vineger easily conuerted into water: euen so the vapor of Herbes boyled in Wyne, is gathered rounde about the bottome of Platters or Dyshes couered ouer: such a Quintescense is very excellent, for the clensing of spottes, and Webbe or Pearle of the eyes, especially if a man boyle of the Rue, or herbe Grace in whyte Vineger, us the worthie Phisition Cardanus affirmeth.

                  BEstowe the matter which you will distyll wythin a Glasse body stopping the mouth wyth Paste, that no ayre at al may breath forth, after do the like, as followeth: Set the Cucurbite into a Kettle or Copper panne full of water, and fresh Oten strawe; which cause to séeth softly, vntill the time that the matter or substance boyleth no more (as the same perhaps maye be, at the consumption

of all the water in the Kettell) after remooue the Kettle with the Cucurbite from the fire, and assoone as the Cucurbite is through colde, put the same a newe into another vessell full of Sande, in which let it be compassed about, and couered with Sande vp vnto the necke: after bestowe the same in a sunnie place, where the sunne all the day shyneth very hote, and in that hote place let this stande for fortie dayes togither, which tyme expired, take it forth

of the Sande, and set the Glasse againe on the Sande only, without a vessell, for the space of eyght dayes: at the tyme ended, let it runne through a newe Lynnen cloth, and wring the substance harde, in a Presse for the purpose. &amp;c. This manner of Dystillation ought rather to be wrought and done in the Monethes of Iuly and August.
            
            
               A forme very rare, of Dystilling by Dung, borowed out of the worke Pyrotechnia. The .xv. Chapter.
               
                  
                  THere is also another fashion and maner of distilling (sayth a certaine Author) much vsed of the Chymistes, which is wrought in Horse dung, whose heate is to be increased by the fume or vapour of Boyling water: after thys order. Lette a wooden Coffer or Chest be made, of sixe Flemishe Elles in length, (or not aboue foure yardes and a halfe of our measure) and of such a breadth, that the same maye commodiously contayne of eyther side the Vrinall bodies of Glasse: and that there be no more left, than a space, by which the Pype maye passe and retch betwéene the rowes of the Glasses, standing on eyther side. This long Chest fill with dry dung, myxed with short chopped straw: after lift vp and set the same on a wooden Forme or Benche, to the ende, that it may stande the higher and commodiouser, for the performance of the worke.

                  Body to the Furnace, that no matter fall through, the Coales then are to be layde vpon all about, and on such wyse kindled, that the fire be very gentle. For a small fire sufficeth in this work at the first, but when it toucheth and is come to the Bozia, let the fire be after increased by little and little. Before the Dystillation, it behooueth to thrust &amp; couch strongly togither, the matter wythin the Bozia, or to drye throughly the same, or with the whyte of an Egge, or

by long running to staye the matter in the Bozia turned vpside

downe, to the ende that it shedde not forth: During the tyme of the Dystillation, the matter cleaueth to the necke of the Bozia. &amp;c. Thys maner of Dystilling is so much the more perfite and excellent, bycause the matter séemeth to be sublymed often and many tymes, as nygh a thousand thousande tymes wrought and dryuen vp and downe, a hygh and belowe, during the time of the Dystillation: yet maye it not cause that such an agitacion and moouing, to render and yéelde a perfite Sublimation of the Quintessence of the matter, that is to saye, the Elementarie conuerted into the name Elementall, and of a corruptible matter rendred an incorruptible. After this maner of Dystilling by Discention, may a man attayne Oyles out of Woods, and halfe Mynerals: If so be the mouth of the Bozia strong luted, be close stopped with a Plate of yron tynned, and stricken full of small holes: That you may the readyer conceyue the manner and Instruments of this Dystillation, beholde the Figure here before descrybed, borowed out of the woorke intituled Pyrotechnia.

hole, and the mouth of it diligently stopped, to be sette into the mouth of a larger vessell lyke glased, standing vnder: which done, to close and stoppe with diligence, the bottome of the Bottell (wythin the mouth of the other vessell) with good Lute or morter of Potters earth, and to burie both the Pottes wholy wythin the Earth, leauing these so couered for a yeare. The yeare being ended, to drawe them forth of the Earth, and in the nether vessell shall be founde a verye cleare Oyle, which is dystilled by vertue of the heate and fumes of the Earth.

And thys water is heated wythin hys vessell▪ with the same fire that the Balneum is heated: for so much as the wall of the Columne is hollow and emptie vnto the bottome of that nether vessell. This sort or fashion of Balneum Mariae, is commended for the dystilling and yéelde of waters in great quantitie, by reason of the colde water whyche thyckeneth and conuerteth incontinent the vapours into water.

or beatings of Iron (flying from the Anuill) Lyme, the bloude of a Bull, or Wether: of these well myxed and wrought togither, couch and erect your Furnaces with Tyles and Bryckes.
               A Lute or Morter, for to parget, couer, and arme or fence the vessels, to thende that those cracke not by violence of the fire: Take the fine pouder and well searsed of Tyles, the pouder searsed of the beatings of Iron about the Anuyll, the pouder searsed and very fine of Sande, of eche one pounde, of fat Lute or Cley

well cleauing thrée poundes: all these diligentlye temper wyth Lye, after myxe them carefully, by stirring the whole strongly togither wyth a staffe: to whych (in the working) adde alwayes a thirde part of shoren floxe, brought very small and myxed as it were in pouder: which done, let the whole be well stirred and myxed togither. The vesselles pargetted and couered with thys Lute or Morter, maye well abyde the violence of fire, without breaking or cracking at all, if it be somewhat thycke layde, and euen spred about the Bodies.
               The Glasse Bodies for to be pargetted or couered wyth Lute, requyre to be wrought cleare, smooth and wythout knots or bladders: in that otherwyse they be in daunger of breaking, for the weakenesse of composition, and may lesser or weakelyer indure

the heate of fire. These on such wise strongly made by the Glassemakers, ought to be fenced with the best Lute (named the Lute of wysedome) vp to the narrower part of the Glasse body, or thrée fingers bredth higher for Aqua fortis, and such lyke, and spredde rounde about of a reasonable thicknesse: to the ende the Coates made strong; and the choppes filled with the best Morter all about (after the well drying of them diuers tymes) maye the aptlyer abyde the forte of fire: The commended Lute or Morter for the vessels of glasse, is to be made of Potters earth, with a fourth part to the same added of shoren floxe, and an eyght part of whyte Ashes, with a fourth part of drye Horse dung, all these well incorporated togither, ought to be well beaten with an Iron rodde. For this on such wyse ordred, is the composition that the Chymistes name the Lute of wysedome, with which they couer and fence the bottomes of those bodies, that they mynde to occupie vnto Dystillation. There be some that adde to this composition, the pouder of Brycke finely beaten and searsed, and the scales or beatings of Iron searsed: and for the apt drying of the vesselles thus fenced, doe make a long Wooden forme, bored full of holes all along, into which they thrust or put the neckes of the Glasse

Bodies, with the mouthes turned downewarde: and on such

wyse they set all the vessels togither to drye in the Sunne, or in the wynde, or by the fire, or in some hote place▪ which on suche wyse throughly drie, they applie to diuers vses, or as pleaseth them for the dystilling of matters: That the forme of drying the vessels may readyer be conceyued, beholde the Figure before demonstrated to the eye.
               Another fashion of Lute or Morter, often vsed of a certayne skylfull man: Take of the fine pouder of Sande searsed, one pound: of the scales or beatings of yron (about the Anuill) brought into fine pouder, so much: of Glasse beaten into fine pouder, as much: of fat Potters Earth and cleauing, thrée poundes: to which adde a third part of a pound of the shoren flox of cloth, with olde water of Tartar, or Salt water: which done, myxe the whole togither, and worke it strongly with an yron rodde, as afore taught.
               Another. Take of Venice Glasse, and of Tartar, of eche a lyke quantitie: of Salt Armonjacke a little, these beate and labour well togither. Of this shall you vse, when that you will diligently Lute any thing, or seale glasse with glasse, by smearing it rounde about the vessels when they are hote.
               Another for to defende that the Glasses breake not by the force of fire: Take what quantitie you will of Allum, putting the same into an earthen Potte, on which poure cleare water to putrifie, after boyle the whole with diligence, and skimme it: which done, let this throughly coole, then smeare or dawbe with the▪ sayde mixture the Glasses without, vntill that you may well and safely bestowe them in the fire, or on Sande: these let to drye by themselues, and doe the lyke vnto a thirde tyme.
               Another Lute or Morter for to defende the vesselles, that they cracke or breake not in péeces, by force of the fire, or by violence of the spirits, and that p
                     •
                  rpetually they may contayne and kéepe Aqua fortis, or the strong water. The vessels smeared or dawbed with the sayd Morter, ought to be well dryed in the Sunne: It is also profitable for the conglutinating or fastening togither of Glasses or vessels broken: Take of Glasse and V
                     •
                  rmilon, of ech a lyke quantitie, these labour into moste fine pouder, after sift it through a fine searse, then incorporate the same with Vernishe:

adding to it a little of the Oyle of Lynséede, and making of the whole like to a soft Pultise: which done, spread the same on a fine Lynnen cloth, and applye or wrappe it about the Orifices of the vessels, or their ioyntes, letting them so to drye in the Sunne by themselues: which although it be very slowly done, yet doth it retayne and kéepe the fyre, the strong water (named Aqua fortis) and the kyndes of the strong water. This is very true, and experienced by the Author of the worke named Pyrotechnia.
               
               For the fast closing and stopping of Glasses, the groundes and thicker substance of that Morter of other Glasses made, is verye commodious: the selfe same doth the Meale, Lyme, and Bole Armoniacke myxed togyther, in the forme of Paste like auayle.
               Another Lute or Morter to be applyed about the ioynts, which so letteth or stoppeth, that the vapors in no manner breath forth: Take the fine pouders of Glasse, and Litarge of Golde sifted thorowe a searse, of eche a pounde: the Meale of Wheate, twoo poundes, myxe these diligentlye, and woorke or labour them very well with the whytes of Egges in the forme of Paste, extended and spredde on the one side of a wette Lynnen cloth, for to apply about the ioyntes: after that it shall be through drye, bestowe or laye yet another Lynnen cloth vpon, and on such wyse the spirites shall be retayned.
               If the Glasse that any hath to set on the fire, happeneth to be cracked, it may be stopped by this meanes, that the spirits breath not forth: wette or stéepe diuers Lynnen clothes in the whytes of Egges well beaten, those applye on the cracke of the Glasse hote, the one after the other, of such sort, that as soone as the one shall be drie and harde as any crust, to bestowe an other, and in lyke maner another consequently: Such a kynde and forme of Morter is commended for the Luting and fencing all about of vessels, when as any will dystill Aqua fortis, or strong water, or the Oyle of Vitrioll.
               A Lute or Morter of wysedome on this wyse: Take fat Cley, and Horsedung, these strongly myxe and worke togither wyth Wyne, Ale, or Béere: and in the seconde labouring togither, adde shoren floxe of Clothe: and in the thirde working togither, myxe pure Wheaten Meale and Flower, with the whytes of

Egges diligently tempered: and on such wyse shall you make the Lute of wysedome.
               Or thus, take two partes of Clay, so much of Horse dung, and one part of the scales or drosse of Iron about the Anuyll: all these diligently bring to fine pouder, dissoluing after a part of Salte in water: with that water worke the whole togither, spreading the same after on a Lynnen cloth, which apply rounde about the vessell.
               Another Lute: Take a fast and tough earth, which after the through drying, bring into fine pouder, the same sprynckle with a little quantitie of water, to which adde Horse dung, brought to pouder: after the well myxing of all these with the whytes of Egges, diligently labour them togither, then of both ioyned, make one myxture, with which you shall Lute round about your vesselles.
               Another Lute: take of the excrement or vpper drosse of the Iron, one pounde and a halfe: of the Meale dust, halfe a pounde: of Glasse brought to fine pouder, one pounde: of the whytes of Egges as much as shall suffyce to myxe the whole throughlye, vnto the forme of Paste.
               A Lute of wysedome is made on this wyse, according to Fyerauant the Italian, in his booke of secret inuentions, with which a man maye lute vesselles of Glasse to resist a mightie heate of fire. Take of the best and finest Chalke, to which adde the drosse of Iron brought to fine pouder, and the common whyte Ashes, the shoren floxe, and Horse dung, these Artely myxe togither: For this is the true composition of the Lute of wysedome, which resisteth the fire marueylously.
               Another Lute or Morter of wysedome, that is much commended by an Empericke, which prepareth of the Antimonie: Take of the best Cley, beaten and wrought with the powder of Tyles or Brycke, the drosse of yron in pouder, and the Hartes or Oxe heares, all which diligently myxe and labour with the whytes of Egges, vnto the forme of Paste,
            
            
               The correction of Waters and Oyles dystilled. The .xxvi. Chapter.
               
                  
                  IN euerye kynde of Dystillation, it oftentymes commeth to passe, for the vehemencie of the cause agent, that is, the heate, or the default of Instruments, or the ignorance of the workeman, that the waters or Oyles dystilled, attayne some fierie heate, or some incommoditie excrementuous or superfluous, or other such straunge qualitie; as taste, and euill sauour: For which cause it is very requisite and necessarie (for the kéeping of them a long time) to know how it behooueth to correct all their defaults. For in that fashion of dystilling, which is wrought and done by force of the fire agent (saith Ioannes Languis) although that the matters which are naturally colde, as the Nightshade, Succorie, Endyue, Lettuce, and such others are dystilled, yet those purchase or conceyue an Empyreuma, that is, a heate and dryth accidentall, lyke to thynges burned: Of which (Galen affirmeth) that no one of burned thynges, is perfitely cold bycause in them is left a fierie qualitie, which Aristotle reporteth to be Empyreuma: After this maner the blacke Choler or Melancholie, although the same be Earthly and naturally colde, forsomuch as it is engendred of bloude adust or burnt, yet is it not altogither wythout heate, no otherwyse than the Ashes and Vyneger. For this reason, the Chymistes more expert, to the ende that the same

heate may be lessened and caused (as it were) mylder, and that the vertues of matters colde, doe not euaporate away, dystill such things, in vessels hanging ouer water boyling, that they name Balneum Mariae, which fashion of Dystilling, they learned of the auncient Apothecaries of the Gréekes: which

for the same causes procured to boyle softly or gently the Oyles, the Oyntments of Spykenarde, of Lauander, of Beniamin, and other medicines of swéete sauour in a double vessell: Also the same in a clear ayre, on the fire without smoke, and of Coales well kyndled. After which manner, they more boyled in tyme past the medicines Arteriacall and Stomaticall, that the Arabians named Loch: These hitherto borowed out of Ioannes Langius. Nowe not only the Dystillation bringeth with it thys adustion to waters or Oyles, but they also attayne by the same meanes a watery and excrementuous moysture, which by the Sunning, ought to be corrected in this maner.
               The waters set in the Sunne for certayne dayes, in Glasses well stopped with Lynnen cloth, or Parchment hauing sundrye holes, to the ende that all the same which is excrementuous in them, may so be consumed: and by the sayde meanes, that what the dystilled waters haue of straunge heate, may in lyke manner be breathed away. In colde Countries for correcting the moysture excrementuous of waters, which can not be rectified nor sufficiently euaporated by the gentle heate of the sunne &amp; the aire: set the Glasse or vessell which contayneth the things dystilled into a vessell full of water, causing it gently to boyle for two or thrée dayes togither, vnto the consumption of a third part of the Oyle (if the same shall be Oyle) but if it be water dystilled, then by the lyke meanes the moysture excrementuous (if any such remayne) shall easily be consumed, and the Oyle, or the Water rectified. This Rogerius. Or rather that the Chymists doe and obserue in the water of Lyfe, by Balneum Mariae: the moysture watrie (that they name Fleume) is receyued a part, and separated from the subtill lycour. But of the other maners of rectifying lycours, we shall more at large hereafter intreate in the proper place.
               Nor there is no lesse daunger in the Dystillation, which is wrought or done by the heate of dung stynking and rotten: least that there may▪ remayne some smatch of rottennesse or foystynes in the lycour dystilled. Hereof it commeth also (that Langius in his Epistles maketh mention) that many worthie Phisitions (in learning and skill of matters) doe abhorre vtterly this 
                     •
                  aner of Dystilling, by reason of the rottennesse of heate, and euaporation

of the dung stynking, which maye easily or lightly infe
                     •
                  t the medicines: for which cause the matters stynking, are alwayes dangerous to the body. To these the same Author answereth on such wyse, that when the things be emptyed out of the vesselles of putrifaction,

and at the last dystilled by a Lymbecke, are then purified wholy from the contagion and annoyance of this rottennesse: forsomuch as the heate of fire resisteth the poyson, and correcteth the same: For Hera also (a worthie Phisition of Cappadocia) reporteth, that when he purposed to correct the styptickenesse and astriction of his proper medicine, did afore bestowe and burie vnder the earth, the same for thrée whole Monethes, and there left it in a maner to putrifie: hoping by the sayde industrie, that the substance of the medicine might be restored of the more subtill partes. Wherefore a man may perswade and beléeue, that if the matters by happ
                     •
                   shall gather and attayne any infection by the putrifaction, all the same maye be taken away, and corrected by the Dystillation following.

                  Of Vineger dystilled. The first Chapter.
                  
                     BEstowe or put the best Vinegar that you can choose, into a Lymbecke, set after into Balneum Mariae, or on fine sifted Ashes, hauing the lyppes or edges (rounde about) well stopped with Paste or Meale tempered in water, or with Paper pasted: which done, make vnder it a soft fire for the space of thrée or foure houres, in which tyme the flewme, that is; the moysture excrementuous is separated from the Vinegar, which you ought to cast awaye as a matter vnprofitable. And a man maye knowe that the Flewme is taken away and gone, when the Vineger shall be consumed vnto a thirde or fourth part: After, let all the ioyntes of the Lymbecke be well stopped, to thende that it maketh no euaporation, then increase the fire by little and little: By the same meanes shall you dystill forth (for the seconde draught) a Vinegar verye good, and most whyte vnto the Lyes, of which you shall haue a signe or note certayne, if you sée the Fecies blacke, and that there commeth forth any Lycour which hath the consistence of Honie or Pytch: you may drawe the lyke of Vinegar, Rosate, of the Elder, of the Cloue Gellyflowers, and others: If any shall infuse all a night in Vineger (which is drawne the seconde tyme) the Pellitorie, Staphisagre (or Iuye brused) in Balneo Mariae, after the expression made, and the grosser substance throwne away, dystill with diligence the Lycour poured into a Lymbecke: This third extraction or draught (besides a number of experiences that a man may worke with it) doth greatlye preuayle agaynst the

myghtie ache and dolour of the téeth: This borowed out of the Booke of an Alchymister of Paris. In the Dystillation of Vinegar only I suppose (sayth the worthie Practicioner Leonarde Fiarauante) that the part wateryshe first runneth forth, after the better sort, in ordering the Dystillation, as aboue vttered: Thys seconde draught of Vineger, is a matter incorruptible, whych Artely separated from the Fecies, becommeth of such force, that it cannot after corrupt. It also dissolueth precious Stones, and Mynerals, that are layde to stéepe in it, as Iron, Tynne, Lattone, Copper, and other lyke things. It serueth for the clensing and cléering of womens faces, washyng sometymes with it, in that this corrodeth and weareth away all spottes: It serueth effectuously, for making the Sirupe of Vineger: It preserueth all matters corruptible put into it, as are Fleshe, Egges, Gourdes, Melons, Cucumbers, Orenges, Lemmons, Fennell, and to be briefe, whatsoeuer thing a man will put into it. This in lyke maner dissolueth the Rheume, maketh a good and cleare voyce by drincking a little at a tyme: It mittigateth the payne in all sores, and in effect is helping in euerye matter, and neuer harmeth in none. If the Vineger shall be dystilled by a Lymbecke, vnto the tyme that the Fecies remayne drie, and they after burned so long in the fire, vnto the tyme that they become whyte Ashes, which after bestowed in a moyst Celler, or other moyste place, dissolueth (as the Tartare prepared doth) into an Oyle, which is of so excellent vertue, for the health of mans bodie, that a man would hardly beléeue. For gyuing a little quantitie of this by the mouth, it dissolueth the Stone of the Kidneys, and wasteth the Stone in the Bladder: The Vineger dystilled with a lyttle quantitie of the Oyle of Tartare, and pure Aqua vitae togither, preserueth the faces of women, and maketh them to appéere most comely. Sundry other great matters maye be wrought with the dystilled Vineger, which here for breuitie are omitted: and referred to the wysedome of skilfull practicioners to finde out.
                  The Sea or Salte water maye a man make swéete, by this meanes: If he filleth a vessell or Pot with Salt water, and causing it to boyle a tyme by the fire, doth after dystill the same by a Lymbecke, as the Rose water, and the Salt shall remayne a

the bottome. But to make a great quantitie in short tyme, it behooueth

to dystill the same by a Lymbecke hauing a Bucket on the heade, which fill with colde water, and as the water waxeth hote in the dystilling, drawe it forth by the Tap or Cocke, and poure colde water immediately into the Bucket: For by this often cooling of the heade, shall you purchase the more yéelde. And thys is the secrete to dystill much at once with a small cost: and the Instrument being not of this maner fashioned, a man can not dystill but a small quantitie at a tyme.

                     A Man maye dissolue after two fashions, the waters of Mynurall Bathes by Dystillation: the one in Balneo Mariae, but such a resolution is hard to bring to passe: the other by a Distillation drie, which is done in vessels of Glasse, whether they be Vrinall Bodyes, or those named (of the Arabians) Bozia, it much forceth not, as I haue sayde: It is sufficient that by this Dissolution of the water, which is wrought by the Dystillation of drie heate, that all those thyngs are knowen, myxed in such waters, without excluding or excepting the vapors or spirites, which are knowne by this reason. Haue a Furnace wholy in a readynesse, the fire represented by the letter A. let be

kyndled beneath, a high on the Furnace, as in the hollownesse, set a vessell of strong Earth very large, (in fashion of a Carnation potte) full of sifted Sande expressed by B. fill the Bozia or, Vrinall vessell declared by C. (it forceth not much whether of them) with the Mynerall or

Bathe water, and that the vessell be set vnto the myddle in the sand, which is wythin the Earthen potte: let the Bozia be couered with his head, hauing a nose sufficient long, signified by the note D. Both these Lute well togyther, to the ende that there be no cleftes, nor any space betwéene the two vessels: After purchase a Pype of Glasse about the bygnesse of a finger, hollowe and open at both endes, descrybed by E. into the one ende of this Pype thrust the nose of the heade, and wrap a Lynnen cloth many times about that ioynt, to the ende that the passages and pores may on such wyse be stopped, that no vapour at all breath forth: then haue in a readynesse a baled Payle, or other lyke vessell of woode, expressed by the letter F. full of colde water▪ and bored of eyther side directlye, that the Pype descending from the nose of the Heade, may passe ouerthwhart this Paile along, within the colde water: By this meanes and waye shall you knowe what maner of Spirites haue bene commixed with the Mynerall water. For the Sande contayned in the Earthen pot, heated by the fire, doth make hote by his heate the Bozia or Vrinall bodie and the water contayned in the same, from which many vapors continually are sent, which ascending and flying to the head, are there thickened and conuerted into water, which running downe by the Pype, retayneth as yet the vapors, bycause that the water descending by this Pype, is somewhat cooled, by the colde as well of the Pype, as of the 
                        〈◊〉
                      water whych is in the wooden vessell (ouerthwart the whych, the Pype extendeth and

passeth along) that toucheth the water: so that the cooling of the one and the other, doth not permit that the vapours being in the water which descende, to breath forth: Thus procéede with that fire vnder the Furnace, vntill all the water shall be dystilled forth, and consumed in the Glasse bodie. Thys done, drawe the Bozia out of the Earthen pot, in whych you shall finde and sée yet remayning some moysture, the same let to drye and consume away in the sunne, after set in the Sunne the Fecies or groundes which shall be at the bottome of the vessell, and let them throughlye drie. When the Fecies shall be thus dryed in the Sunne, then it behooueth to consider &amp; marke what in them is contained. Certayne wyll that the sedunents or groundes be layde abroade on a fayre smooth Table, and beholde them in the Sunne, to the ende that what bright and shyning Bodie shall be there, the same may appeare more easily in the Beames of the Sunne. As touching my mynde in this, I rather wyshe that another matter be afore done: First, so soone as the Bozia shall be drawne forth of the Furnace, the sediments or grounds being yet hote, it behooueth to approch and put downe the Nose to the mouth of the Bozia, for a man shall easily knowe and perceyue by the smell, whether the same be of Cleye, or of Earth, which is impossible to knowe by any other meanes: In lyke maner the sauour of the groundes yet being hote, bryngeth or yéeldeth a knowledge of the redde Chalke (that we name Ruddell) which rendreth a sauour swéete, and by the same note is the presence of the Oker perceyued. After that, the sedimentes shall be somewhat more cooled, take a portion of the same, rubbing it betwéene the fingers: By the same meanes shall you discerne and knowe the Sandaraca, Brymstone, Orpyment, and others lyke: In the ende let the groundes being drye, be spredde on a Table in the Sunne, for if there shall be any small Bodyes of Alumne, those will be made manifest by the Sunne, so that on such wyse shall they apparantly shewe and be séene: By this maner and fashion shall you perceyue the Salt, if it be gathered in bygge graynes, the Nytre lykewise if it be in great quantitie, for that in small quantity the same is very hardly discerned. The Brymstone, if it be pure, is knowne by his colour, in that it is somewhat yelow, or

palyshe: euen so may a man haue iudgement or perceyueraunce of Ashes and Stones, clotted and hardned togither. As touching other Mettals, as the Golde, Siluer Tin, Iron, and such like, are not knowne: for that those are sometymes so much myxed with Marble, Ashes, and such lyke things, that they cannot be iudged or perceyued by any sense: yea, although that you taste the sediment, yet may you knowe nothing by the same. For which cause it behooueth to procéede and trie by another meanes and way: as to spreade that sediment on a Lamyne of Iron polyshed and burning, or redde hote: for on such wyse shall it be 
                        •
                     asie to dyscerne the Ashes, Marble, Gypsum, Lyme, Brymstone, Salt, Nytre, and Ceruse: Forsomuch that if it hath of the Lyme, or Marble, they will not be burned at all, but after that some one of the others shall be burned, they will remayne, &amp; possesse a colour more white than they had afore. And if you discerne or sée that it hath any matter, which cannot be burned, but rather incontinent becō
                     meth very white, know for troth that ye same is Gypsū: for which cause, the Lyme, Marble, and Gypsum agrée and partake in this, that they be not burned at all, but remayne, and be caused more whyte: yet this difference there is, that the Lyme and Marble are slowly caused whyte, and their whytenesse is not much more increased than it was before: But contrarywise the Gypsum attayneth incontinent a whytenesse, whych is much greater tha
                        •
                      the same was before. The Brymstone is also easily knowne by this experience, forsomuch as that it m

                     lteth and representeth his proper sauor: The Salt likewyse and the Nytre are knowne, for that their sediments (if they be there) are burned, and will cast forth sparckles: But thys difference there is, for if there be Salt, it wyll sparckle and cracke lykewise, if onely Nytre, it wyll sparkle wythout cracking: If the matter be myxed of Salt and Nytre, whyles the sediment is in burning, part of it wyll sparckle and cracke, and part of it wyll sparckle wythout cracking: I neuer yet founde the Leade by this experience, but I suppose that if it were founde in the s

                     e of Iron burning. If there be in it of the Ceruse, the groundes then wyll render or be caused redde, whych is also a note of the Leade, for so much as these two are verye

lyttle dyffering: For the Ceruse is made of Leade, and of Ceruse the Vermillon, that is, a like quantitie of Ceruse and Ruddell or redde earth burned togither: If you sée that the sediment is molten, and become so whyte as Mylke, you maye not perswade and gather incontinent, that there is in it of the Allum, for although that there be sometymes a note that there is of the Allum with his stone, yet may it be caused there to be without m
                        •
                     lting, for the Allum is molten one whyles by heate, an other whyles by moysture: The other Mettals cannot be knowne by any of these experiences.
                  I neuerthelesse haue founde an Arte, which I haue experienced at the Aponitaine Bathes, Lucensis, and the water of Villensis, which is on such wyse: When you will examine and trye, if any water hath of the Vitrioll, or of Allum, or other lyke Mynurall, cause the water first to boyle, not in a vessell of Glasse, but of Tynne, or Iron: after that the water shall be boyled a certaine tyme, let it settle, then after the boyling yet a little more, incontinent throwe or poure into it the iuice or decoction of Gall nuttes, in small quantitie: If the water hath of Vitrioll, or of Allum, it will incontinent become blacke: Or else take some composition black, as is the medicine (named Verzinum) knowne in Italie, causing it to boyle in water, vnto the tyme that the water taketh a colour in maner blacke: after strayne the same, and sprinckle a quantitie of this water on the groundes, and if there be of the Allum, that colour blacke, will incontinent be restored or caused more cleare. And what I haue sayde of the colour left of the medicine Verzinum, as much it behooueth to vnderstande of any other matter, in such sort that the water for to worke or doe such an experience, may be made of euery matter, which may dye the water into a blacke colour: and the water so that it be blacke, it forceth not of what matter the same be caused blacke. As touching the astriction, which consisteth in the Allum, I report nothing of it, in that the Allum beyng in the sediment, cannot be knowne by the taste: For it commeth often to passe, that when you taste the sediment, and that you féele an astriction, yet the same procéedeth or commeth not of the Allum, but perhappes of Salt or some other thing: The Iron, the Copper,

and such lyke Mettals, cannot by other meanes be known
                        •
                     , but by the corruption and resolution of the groundes, in such sort that euery Mettall (that there shall be) maye be turned into hys proper excrement, and so of his proper excrement, shall you after knowe this or that Mettall to be in it. By the selfe same fashion and manner is knowne the Iron, the Syluer, the Golde, the Chrysocolla, that is, the Saulder of Golde, the Copper, and such lyke. For these reasons it behooueth to ioyne and myxe the groundes with some medicine, or sharpe lycour, to the ende that euery Mettall which shall be contayned in the sediment, maye be turned into his proper excrement. Nowe the sharpe and corrosiue medicine that a man may finde, apt and fitte to doe the same, shall be the strong Vinegar, the Aqua fortis, and such lyke. Take therefore the sediment, and bestowe the same into Aqua fortis, or other such medicine corrosiue, and when you shall see the water to be dryed vp and consumed, regarde and marke diligently, if the excrement of any Mettall, be not on the sediment: as if you sée on the Groundes, the excrement of Iron to be coagulated and heaped togither, you shall easily iudge the Iron to be in the sediment or groundes. If you there sée of the excrement of Copper, or a matter gréene cankered, the same is a note that there is of the Copper, and euen so of the others. Therefore the Mettalles are knowne by the corruption, and mutation, or chaunging of them into their proper excrements: And this shall you knowe to be a sure experience and a troth of the matter (as you may easily trie in the doyng) if you take a portion of any Mettall, as the Fylings of Iron, and shall myxe the same with the groundes of any matter, and bestowe a payne about it, that the fylinges maye be corrupted, then shall you sée that the same wyll be corrupted into his proper excrement, which is named (of the Latynes Ferrugo) that is, the rust of Iron. After this maner are knowen how much and what are the things which are myxed with the Mynurall waters, that serue to Bathes, which is especially tryed by the industrie and worke of Dystillation: But consider and take héede that the gréene colour doth not deceyue you, which appeareth sometymes in the sediment, although that it hath nothing of the Copper myxed: for oftentymes this colour is there ingendred of

some Bole, which is myxed amongst the grounds: for that cause throughly examine and make the proofe, if this colour procéedeth of the Copper myxed, or Iron, or the excrement of Iron, or of some Bole, in this sort: Take the sediment of that water, and poure the same into Vineger dystilled, and consider or marke what colour the Vineger representeth or draweth vnto, the lyke consider what the colour is of the sediment, after that it shall be through dryed. For if it hath there the excrement of Iron, the colour shall be blacke: If Bole, the colour shall be redde, that is, lesse blacke, and tending or drawing to a rednesse: I here vtter nothing of the sauour and taste, for that so dyuers is the sauour and taste of Mynurall waters, that a man cannot know of them, what those are myxed wythall. All these hitherto haue I borrowed out of the learned worke of Mynurall Bathes of Fallopius, which I haue endeuoured to penne or wryte worde for worde, as things appertayning to the matter, of which we haue entreated, in respect that we so oftentymes entreate of Mettals in this Booke, which are things worthie to be examined diligently, for the vtilitie and profite of most men.

                     THe congruent tyme of dystilling the Hempe, is, that the toppes as yet tender and gréene, shredde small, be dystilled by Balneo Mariae. This water greatly helpeth the paynes of the heade procéeding of a hote cause, if the heade, the foreheade, and Temples, be often laboured with the same. Thys also profiteth agaynst any heate, in what part or member

of the Bodie it shall be, especially the Goute, if a Lynnen clothe dypped in the water, be applyed on the place: and thys in the

Wynter vse twyse in the day, but in the Summer thrée tymes of the day. Take of the water of the gréene Walnuts one ounce, of the water of Egrimonie an ounce and a halfe, of the water of Rewe, halfe an ounce, of the water of Hysope thrée ounces, of the water of Hempe foure ounces, these myxe togither, of which take halfe an ounce, adding to it halfe a dramme of Mumia, halfe an ounce of Sugar Candie, and a dramme of the Conserue of Roses, this after the drinking warme to bedde, and lying downe well couered with clothes to sweete, expelleth those wicked humors of which the plague procéedeth: the same potion helpeth the Dropsie, taken in the same manner, and preserueth a man from such sickenesses: A water dystilled of the Hempe séede with the iuice of Garlicke, of the same fashion that the Rose water is dystilled, which is Cosemeticall, that is, profitable for garnishing, for it causeth heares to growe in the bare and balde places, being often applyed.

                  The water of the greater Celondine. The .Lxxxi. Chapter.
                  THe congruent time of dystilling the Celondine, is, that when the herbe bearing flowers, the whole substance gathered and shredde small, be dystilled in a Cucurbite of glasse by Balneo Mariae, about the middes of May. This water druncke morning and euening, to the quantitie of fower ounces at a time, deliuereth the yelowe Iaundise, and helpeth the grypings of the bellie. The water druncke in the same manner, mitigateth the Ague, and putteth away scabbednesse procéeding of colde, if the places be annoynted with the same. The water druncke twyse or thryse a daye, to the quantitie of twoo ounces at a tyme, swéetened with Sugar, recouereth the stopping of the lyuer and mylt. The water (after the infusion of the herbe for sixe dayes in good Aqua vitae) druncke for certaine dayes morning and euening, to the quantitie of an ounce at a time, preserueth the bodie long in health, and expelleth euill humors. The water dropped into the eyes, recouereth spottes, the pynne and webbe, deliuereth the rednesse of them, preserueth and causeth a sharpe and readie sight, and restoreth the same in a maner lost: If the mouth be washed with the water, it ceaseth the grieuous payne of the téeth, and putteth away spottes, if the face be often washed with the same. The water dryeth and healeth a Canker, and lykewise the Fistula, and putteth away pestilent pushes, if a lynnen cloth wet in it, be applyed twyse or thrice a day. The water of the greater Celondine, that hath the propertie of helping diseases, as well the hote as colde; giueth strength to the spirituall members, expelleth poysen from the heart, deliuereth the lunges of that which to it is noyous, healeth it vlcered, and by drincking sundrie tymes of it, stayeth the fluxe of bloude. I am in doubt (sayth a certaine skilfull Phisition) whether a man may beléeue, that all these properties be in the dystilled water of Celondine; séeing that according to Dioscorides and Galen, it is

of qualitie mightily clensing, and very hote, by reason whereof this causeth the veynes to be the cléerer of all grosse humors, and deliuereth the obstructions of the lyuer in the Iaundyse: This also is the reason, why the learned Mathiolus in his commentarie vpon Dioscorides, doth so greatly reprehend the Chymists, which take vpon them to drawe forth a Quintessence of this herbe, that they affirme to be not only commodious for their extractions, but as woonderfully profitable for the preseruing of health, and expelling of infinite diseases. Séeing that this herbe can worke no such matter, it is possible that the Chymistes abuse the same, where they in steade of rightly naming this herbe Chelidonium, doe name it Caelidonum, (rather deuising for it such a worde Caelidonum) as if this herbe were a gyft from heauen, to which are attributed all these great vertues. This water is on such wyse distilled, take the rootes, leaues and flowers, which shredde small, and put into a vessell of glasse, well fenced with Lute, burie the vessell couered with his heade in horse dung, for the space of ten dayes: After the taking forth, dystill it in ashes according to Arte: the lycour that shall first runne forth, will be waterishe, the seconde as an oyle, which you shall dystill yet once againe, and kéepe for your vse.
               
               
                  The water of Strawberies. The .Lxxxij. Chapter.
                  THe time most agréeable for distilling of the berries, is, when they are rype, yet not ouer soft: and those which growe and are gathered in the hyllie woodes, be accounted the better. These full rype, shall you putrifie in a Cucurbite of glasse, by strawing vpon them a good quantitie of Sugar brought to powder, which let so long stande (close couered with the heade) vntill they appeare hoarie, after dystill the whole by Balneo Mariae. This singular water asswageth burning humors, putteth awaye spottes of the eyes newe growne, eyther of a hote or colde humor, so that they be not ouergreat. It also stayeth the watring and running of the eyes, procéeding of heate or colde, and lyke restoreth the sight to a clearenesse, decayed or lost by eyther of the causes. This water druncke in the morning fasting, to the quantitie of thrée ounces

at a time, with a little wyne, doth marueylously preuayle against the inwarde heates of the lunges and lyuer, and extinguisheth thirst. It also comforteth nature, expelleth poysons, &amp; procureth the termes in women. The water drunck in like quantitie morning and euening, swéetened with a little Sugar, recouereth an euill heate of the stomacke, and asswageth the great desire to drincke. The water druncke morning and euening, to the quantitie of fower ounces at a time, with a dramme weyght of pure Aqua vitae, recouereth and healeth the Leprie, for that the same druncke in wyne, or otherwise eaten with breade, purgeth the bloude, and remooueth a noysome scabbednesse of the bodie. The water in the same manner taken, helpeth the inflammations of the lyuer, the yelowe Iaundise, the stone in the loynes, kidneyes and bladder. It also looseth the breast, comforteth the heart, and clenseth the bloud. The water holden a little whyle in the mouth, and gargelled in the throte, strengtheneth the gummes, fasteneth the téeth loose, and stayeth the dystillations from the brayne: It also profiteth against vlcers, and swellings in the throte, sorenesse of the mouth, and a stincking breath. The water marueylously recouereth and healeth blysters and pymples on the face, which procéede of heate, by often washing it with the same. This also asswageth the swelling of the face, by washing and often applying lynnen clothes wette in the water. The water recouereth that person whose legge is broken, by drincking euery morning fasting (for a certaine space) to the quantitie of fower ounces at a time, swéetened with Sugar, and to apply often lynnen clothes wette in the same. The water healeth all foule legges, if they be washed morning and euening with the same, or that the water often applyed with linnen clothes: It also cureth filthie wounds, if they shall be often washed with the same, and that the pacient in the meane season, doth daylie drinck twyse a day of this water. The water mixed with pure white salt, and distilled once againe in a Cucurbite of glasse by Balneo Mariae, is highly cōmended for the eyes, in that it cooleth, cléereth, and putteth awaye the dymnesse of them. The water of the Strawberies, is a souereygne and an effectuous oyntment for the eyes, if they especiallye be grieued by an extreme heate, or hote dystillings from the heade.

The water of the herbe (dystilled by Balneo Mariae, about the middes of May) druncke morning and euening, to the quantitie of fower ounces at a time, recouereth the yelowe Iaundise, procureth vrine, stayeth the fluxe Dysenteria, and the termes in women, and helpeth the splene. The water lyke druncke, looseth the breast, purgeth the lunges, helpeth the Cough, and putteth away the Leprie. The water dropped into burning eies with a rednesse, morning and euening, doth greatly mittigate the heate of them. The water druncke, asswageth the ouermuch sweating of body. For the burning and obstruction of the lyuer, there is nothing more profitable, nor holesommer.

After set on a head with his receyuer well luted togither, which you shall dystill in ashes with a soft fire, by little and little, and that which commeth, kéepe charily.

Which after the drawing forth, set into ashes, luting diligently the receyuer to the nose of the heade.

This druncke, helpeth spéedily the falling sicknesse, namely if their heades be annoynted therewith. This water also applyed on Impostumes with towe, spéedily breaketh them. If ministred with a quantitie of Lyme dissolued in it, breaketh the stone. This water druncke, helpeth the Dropsie. This water spéedily healeth the byte of anye venimous dogge being madde, or other beast venimous, if the harmed person dryncke thereof: If this water be druncke by and by after poyson receyued, it deliuereth the person.

                  The water of mans ordure or dung, of a sanguine man dystilled, being orderly applyed, doth helpe the hastie chaunging of the heare of the head to a whitenesse, and the shedding of it, corrosiue vlcers, the canker, and spottes of the eyes. This also druncke, recouereth the falling sicknes, amendeth the stone of the kidneys and bladder, the Dropsie, and the byte of any venimous beast.

                  The dystillation of a Capon Maystriall, of D. Peter Vnormatiensis. he first boyled the Capon in water vnto a sufficiencie (on such wyse) that twoo pyntes remayned of the broth, after he powred the broth and fleshe into a glasse bodie close-luted, which he dystilled after Arte in ashes, and hauing distilled about a pinte, or a pinte and a half, ceased of, without adding to this water eyther spices▪ eyther herbes or rootes: which water he often ministred and vsed to weake bodies, in Agues, and was delectable without

abhorrement to the pacients.

                  The dystillation of a Capon, borowed of a certaine doctour. Take an auncient Capon, of sixe, seuen, or eyght yeares of age, the same drie pull and bare, which after the drawing, stéepe or soke in pure water for a night, the whole put after into a newe earthen pot glased, which containeth fower measures of water, this in the séething skym diligently, and the fatnesse take carefully of, remembring alwayes to fill vp the pot boyling: After the fleshe t

                  Another water of a Capon, out of the same author, recouering bodies lowe brought by the ague: Take the pulpe or tender flesh of the Capon, being chased and coursed vp and downe, and to and fro, before the strangling, from which drawe or plucke both

the fatte and skinnes, then washe both in the waters of the water Lillie (named of the Latines Nenuphar) and the Lettuce, adding thereto the conserue of Violets new made, and the flowers of the Nenuphar, of eche one ounce, of the conserues of Borage and Buglosse, of eche one ounce and a halfe, of the whyte Poppie and Lettuce séedes, of eche one ounce, of the powder of the colde Diamargariton, one dramme and a halfe, of the iuice of pleasant Apples, twoo ounces, all these diligently mixte togither, and put in a double vessell, dystill according to Arte, which dystilled lycour vse after the maner aboue taught.
                  Another water of a Capon, of the same authors, for the recouering strength, in a colde sickenesse: Take the pulpe of the Capon throughly wearied, and after washed diligently in whyte wine, or else in Malmesie, if so be the sickenesse shall be colder, adding therevnto of the conserue of Sage flowers one ounce, of the conserue of Staechas, Anthos, and Acorus, of eche halfe an ounce, of the ryndes of the Cytrons prepared with sugar, and finely shred, sixe drammes, of the inner part of the Cinamone, and of Nutmegs, of eche one dramme, let all these be put in Balneo Mariae, and dystilled according to Arte: let certaine spoonefulles of thys lycour, be ministred for a certaine time, to the weake and féeble bodies.
                  There be some Authors, which in certaine sickenesses, especially of the heade, and in colde diseases, with the weakenesse, and decayed strength: that highly commende the waters of Capons dystilled on such wyse, yea, the Author hath experienced to haue auayled somtimes in the Collick passions, especially those which were wyndie of bodie: for the distilled water giuen to such, much perplexed with wynde of the bodie, it spéedily ceaseth and stayeth the winde from any more molesting, if so be the water shall rightly be prepared. Thus diuers and sundrie medicines may skilfully be deuised by a learned Phisition, in the varietie of sickenesses.
               
               
                  For what cause the brothes of Capons, and other fattes, seeing they be fluxible, and of an ayreall substance, are so slowly eleuated.

                  THe reason of this, is, in that the fatnesse floting or swimming aboue, doth of the same procure and drawe ouer a thyn skin, which so kéepeth the moysture resting vnder, that the humor can hardly euoporate through: and euen the like, doth the oyle poured into a vessell with eyther wine or pleasant waters, by the floting aboue, suffer not any of them to breath through: and the Radish roote also eaten with oyle, causeth then not the lyke belchings or reastinges of the stomacke to insew, as did otherwise without the oyle: and euen the like of iuices may be learned, which when any woulde haue kept for a time, they doe couer it with oyle, that neyther the spirites (through the same) keeping in the iuice, doe breath forth, nor maye be drawne awaye of the outwarde ayer: this written of Langius in his Epistles.
                  A dystilled water restoring weake bodies, and most profitable in consumptions, out of the secrete conclusions of Fierauantus: Let a good yong henne be gotten that neuer layde egge, this pull alyue, whereby hir bloude may so be stirred vp, and spersed thorowout all the bodie: thus being plucked bare, and deade, drawe forth the bowels only, beating after both the fleshe and bones togither in a morter, adding so much of the crummes of whyte breade, as the weyght of the fleshe and bones beaten, beate these well togither, putting therevnto also one handfull of the gréene or drie Scabious, and so many leaues of golde as wey a French or Englishe crowne, to these after adde so much of the water of the garden Nightshade or petie Morell, as is the weyght of the whole substance, which after let so stande togither for a whole night, putting it then into a glasse bodie with a heade diligentlye luted, and thrée pyntes of the best and mightiest wyne also added before the dystilling, which (after the fastening of the receyuer to the heade) dystill in Balneo Mariae, vnto the fecies remayne thorowe drie, and then haue you the water. Nowe to euery pynte of this water, adde one ounce of our water of the honye (of which shall after be taught in the proper place of this booke) which let be kept in a glasse close stopped, that the ayre breath not forth. The vse of it serueth to be druncke both in the meales, and betwéene

meales: which helpeth the drye cough of the persons diseased and sicke of the Ague, and women traueyling in childebed, and many other like matters, doth this dystillation worke, greatly to be woondered at.

                  A remedie against the Leprie, prepared and made of frogges: This one singular remedie and medicine, I will not hyde from the worlde (sayth Fumanellus) nor lightly ouerpasse the confection of frogs, which ought before to be fleaed, and the bowels drawne forth, then put into a Copper vessell tynned within, and hauing sundrie small holes in the bottome, lyke to the forme of a watering pot, vnder which must another pot be set, in such sort, that the vpper standing within the mouth of the nether pot; and diligently luted rounde about, that no ayre at all breath forth, these so ordred, set into the earth vnto the mouth of the nether pot, and couering the earth close and harde, make a fire of coles rounde about the vpper pot, the mouth of it, like close luted: which so long continue with fire, vntill the whole substance and moysture of the frogs shall be dystilled: The licour may be ministred or druncke

euery morning fasting, for a certaine tyme, vnto the quantitie of the thirde part of an ounce: And if oppurtunitie and iust occasion shall so mooue me, I intende to make an attempt of the dystilling also of Snakes, in lyke order (as aboue taught) of the frogges. Nowe the forme of the vessels, which Nicholaus Florenti teacheth to be made in his large commentarie (in fermo. 7.) fift treatise, and xxxix. Chapter, is on this wyse: He first writeth the vessel or potte (in which the frogges prepared be) to be filled vnto the mouth with them: and the mouth all ouer filled and couered with butter: with this dystilled lycour, being a noble medicine, he instrudeth to annoynt the Canker, that healeth it in short time.

                     Gesnerus distilled a water out of hony, whose first water sauoured somewhat of waxe, where besides it was sufficient delectable and cleare, and whytish, which perhaps may séeme auayleable in the Cholicke passions. The seconde water which dystilled forth, had a certaine sowrenesse. The thirde water which came forth, tasted as it were vinegar. The fourth water which came forth, tasted in a maner as sowre as vinegar: he began dystillation in the morning at the seauenth houre, and out of halfe a measure of honie, he purchased two small vials full in a daye, in the euening he began to dystill, and continued vnto noone in a maner, he also prepared and made his fire to last vnto the ninth houre of the night: and from that houre he renued the fire vnto the sixt houre of the next morrowe: and following the fire from the sixt houre of the morning vnto twoo in the after noone: then began a great fume or smoke to arise and yssue forth into the receyuet, and that somewhat stincking, and a substance also to ascende (as when nothing remayned of the watrie substaunce, then did the honie ascende) then drewe I forth the Cucurbite (sayth the author) which I shoulde not haue done (but rather haue set or lyfted him hygher in the ashes) and then came the droppes forth redde, and burnt in the Limbeck, yea sowre, and in sauour or smell lyke to the oyle of the Iuniper woode in a maner: and of it fast cleauing to the sides and bottome of the Cucurbite: The remnant in the Cucurbite, was the honie of a blackish redde colour, burnt, somwhat sowre, and colouring yelowe.
                  Maister Gesnerus dystilled the oldest Hydromell in ashes, and left in the Cucurbite a substaunce tending or declyning vnto a blackenesse, and swéete in taste, yet sowre or lothsome in smell. The first water which dystilled forth, was odoriferous, &amp; had the hote and quicke taste of Aqua vitae, yet the same conceyued nor tooke no flame. The seconde water which came forth, séemed wateryer, with a certaine sowrenesse: so that a small quantitie of water, he dystilled of the same.

And it singularly auayleth in all colde poysons, as of the Tode, the Spyder, the Adder, and Scorpion, nor it is possible that they may harme a man, if he be eyther stinged or poysoned of any of them, so that the pacient applie vpon the place one droppe warme of it.

It cureth and healeth the swelling of the féete, the legges, and also the gréefe or payne of the ioynts, applyed thereon, it helpeth any colde comming of a colde cause, or of corrupt bloud. This liquour also is named the mother of Baulme, which if you will prooue the same, take a Pullet plucked bare, &amp; cleane drawne within, or the guttes taken out, after heate him so long, vntill you can hardly abyde the holding of him in your hande, which then annoynt with the sayde oyle, &amp; lay after in the sunne for two howers to dry, which through dry annoynt agayne with

But our later practysioners, that they might make the water stronger, and vehementer, added to it Salt peter. Bellonius vttering, and wryting of those medycines or compoundes, preseruing dead bodyes: affyrmeth that if yron or any other mettallyne matter, bee put into the strong water, that it forthwith boyleth, and ryseth vp to faste, that if it hath not vente to breathe out, it then breaketh the vessel or doubble Glasse. But yf you throwe Golde into it, then doth it not lyke boyle vp, but dyssolue the same into the fourme of Sande, and all the other mettalles in the fourme of a lycour. When Syluer shall be dyssolued in this water, then put into it Copper plates, and the Syluer wyll cleane to it, which after stryke of with a brushe: and in the ende, this in the melting wyll ioyne.
                  A strong water is thus made: take of Vitryoll, and of Salt peter, a lyke quantitye, of these drawe a water by distyllacion, into which if you put parsyll or doubble gylt ruppes or pottes, the Syluer shortlye after wyll bée dyssolued, but the Golde remayneth vndyssolued, or as I may saye whole, which after strayne, and if you wyll stryke or wype of the Golde, then adde vnto the abouesayd water, of the Salt, &amp;c. * after drye eache, and prepare orderlye.

distylled with it: this then is named the regall water, or water of a kyng, which seperateth Golde. But the common Aqua fortis or strong water, doth only seperate Syluer: so that it doth both leaue the Gold, and maketh it apparaunt.

The sayde water, is stronger then the water of the worlde, and hath maruaylous workinges in it. For this water dyssolueth, corrodeth the fleshe, and reduceth or chaungeth all thinges of the worlde, into a powder and water: as the stones, and mettalles. If this bée heated, it then gyueth vp a verye redde, and myghtie fume. This water, if it toucheth by it selfe, eyther the fleshe, or a garment, it dyeth or coloureth the same yellowe to Saffron, which spotte wyll neuer bée gotten out: for the colour or stayne on the fleshe contynueth many dayes, and if you washe the stayne with Lye, it becommeth verye redde of colour. Further if you shall put a lyttle piece of good Luna, that is of syluer, into this water, it dyeth then the same of a blacke colour, which after cannot be gotten out or clensed away. And if you shal put a lytle of Mercurie, which is quicksyluer, into it▪ that it bée molten, it is then caused mightyer then the fyre.

If yron also bée put into the sayde water, it forthwith heateth &amp; boyleth without fyre▪ and if you put into it yron, it causeth a redde water, by the intermedling &amp; dissoluing of the yron.

And if you shall drawe or distyll the water by a bodye of glasse fensed, the yron then wyll remayne in the bottome of the vessel, and wyll be a verye redde powder, which properlie is named, Marses, Saffron. If also in the above sayd water you shall put Venus, that is to say Copper, it lyke boyleth, and of the same is made a greene water. And if you wyll draw that water forth by a Lymbecke, then wyll a most blacke powder of Venus, remaine in the bottome of the vessell, which properlye is named Venus Lyme. Note that if you shall put Saturne that is Leade, in the sayde water, it causeth the water cleare, &amp; if you shall draw that water forth by Limbeck, there wyl remaine a whyte Salt in the bottome, &amp; that bytter. Also if you shall put Iupiter, that is tynne into it, it wyll then cause of it a paste lyke to butter: and if you shall drye the same (as aboue taught) the powder then wyll be whyte in the bottome. And if you shall put Mercurie, that is quicksyluer, into it, it maketh then a cleare water of the same: and if you shall let the water of Mercurie to settle, it wyll then fall to the bottome lyke to yse: and if you wyl drye the same, then remayneth a whyte salt in the bottome, and strong as the styffest waxe. And if you wyll recouer your Syluer, when it is in the water, put then in the same water crude Mercurie, and the good Syluer wyll incontinent enter within the Mercurie, after emptye the water, and take the myxion, which put into a Goates skynne, wryng the substaunce verye harde, and the Mercurie or quicksyluer wyll then issue forth: the substaunce which shal remayne in the skinne, put into a Crucible to be molten, and you shall then finde the good syluer. Also if you shall put Golde in the same water, it causeth the water yelowe of it, and if you shall drye the same, then is a golden salt caused bytter as the earth, that auayleth in the drying of Fistulaes. If also you shall dyssolue one part of good Luna or syluer in the sayde water, and so muche of Mercurie or quicksyluer, and so much of the whyte sublymed Syluer, and a fowrth part of one of these, of Tutia Alexandrina, and shall drawe this water by a Lymbecke, all these then shall remayne in the bottome of the glasse, vnto the fourme of a stone: of which stone put one part, vpon fowre parts of Copper molten, and it shall soone after become so whyte, as the syluer

All which come in the receauer, emptie then into another Glasse bodie pure within, &amp; stronglye luted and fensed without: to the headde of which set a Receauer fastened with lute, and standing vnder: the same cause to distyll againe, and the water when it shall be gathered in the Receauer, powre the same againe into the bodie in which Mercurie yet remayned, and you shall often repeate and goe ouer with this, vntyll a Mercurie come to rednesse, &amp; being thus come redde, take the Cake forth, and washe it with Cordiall waters, as the water of Rosemarye, Buglosse, Baulme, and such lyke. But washe the Mercurie before (and that often tymes) in spring, Cunduite, or well water being before distylled: which Mercurie thus corrected and prepared, you shall mynister to the sicke and grieued persons, after this order and maner.
                  If the person shall be sufficientlye strong of bodie, then mynister (after the mynde of Gabriell Fallopius) of Aloes cicotri halfe a scruple, of Myrre and Masticke fowre graines, of precypitate fyue graynes: myxe these with rosed Hony, or rather with the conserue of Roses, framing of the whole, eyther three or fowre pylles, which gyue fasting in the morning, and dryncking a draft of whyte wyne warmed after them. If the bodie shall be meane of strength, then mynister but fowre graynes with a lytle swéet

                      butter, Sugar, and three graynes of Masticke. If the body shalbe feeble and through crased, then onely thrée graynes, with halfe a scruple of Aloes

                     ycotrine powthered, and myxed with Rhodosaccharū, which made into thrée pylles, minister as aboue taught. But if you minde to minister this to a Childe, then vse but fowre graynes, or rather applye of it, according to the strength and weakenesse of the Chyldes body, Further learne &amp; note, that you ought to myxe the precypitate before with Triacle, and to mynister the same then to the pacient poysoned, to the dropsie person▪ and pacient taken with the Pestilence, or any other sicknesse.

And that more to be vnderstanded, if a healthfull and sound man shall yearely, or euery thyrd yeere vse this precypitate, as neede &amp; occasion shall requyre the same, with a prudent digestion of humours, that is, the preparation of the purgation, the pacient then shall auoyde disseases, and from being sicke.
                  Here conceyue, that in the place of precypitate, you may vse the myxture named Amalgama, which (after the mynde of the Chymistes) is made of sire partes of quicksyluer, and of one parte of Golde: with which thus prepared, you may doe the greater marueyles. And note, that with the fyrst, and second precypitate, you may cure woundes, by vsing the same after this maner, as to put of it about the woundes, &amp; within. Besides the water remayning after the precypitate made, taketh away the paine of all filthye wounds, if they be bathed with the same, &amp; a droppe of this water put with coten into a hollowe tooth, which greuouslye aketh and payneth, it doth sodaynlie astonishe &amp; mortifye the marow of the tooth, and delyuereth the payne for euer. Also this water mixed with whyte wine, &amp; wetting the heyres of the head or beard with it being hoarie whyte, causeth them to come yelow. And sundry other matters besides this worketh, which for breuitye here omytted.
                  The maner of making the Philosophers stone, which healeth all disseases in man, or woman, is on this wyse: take of Salt nyter prepared, of roche Alome, &amp; of Romaine vitryoll▪ of each two poundes, drye the vitryoll before in an earthen panne, and being dryed, beate altogyther into pouder, vnto which adde fowre ounces of Salt gemme, after put the whole into a bodie luted or fensed about with the lute of wisedome, and the head close ioyned &amp; clayed about, which set in an open Furnace, making a fyre vnder with cleft wood if you wyl, vnlesse you had rather vse coales, then to the nose of the headde artlye fasten the Receauer that no ayre breath forth: which done, kyndle the fyre, &amp; when it begynneth to distyl, wet then lynnen cloathes easilye wringed out, which shall applie both vpon the head and Receauer, vnto this ende, that the spy

I haue giuen fowre Barlie cornes wayght, sometimes of this powder, with conserue of Roses, tymelie in the morning, but the pacient after refrained meate vnto dynner time, and made then a small meale or dynner, but a better supper. Through the benefite of which, for the space of two yeares after, yea thrée yeares and more, the pacient had perfite health of bodie, as he reported. Yet the mynde of the best practysioners is, that the precypitate, how so euer the same be corrected, doth alwayes painefully torment the head and stomacke, especially of tender bodies. Wherefore although this may séeme to helpe sundrie disseases, to purge the belly mightily, &amp; to procure strong vomytes: yet doth it many tymes procure the blooddy flixe to insue, and a veyne to breake in the breast, through the painefull inforsing, and strayning to vomyte, Which neuerthelesse thought meete for husband menne, that haue strong stomacks to abyde the drawing of it: so that to them it is porfitable, and maye helpe sundrye grieffes and disseases.

                  MAny needeth as much of oyles as waters, vnto the benefite and preseruation of health, as for other necessarye commodityes of bodie, besydes. For seeing of these which wée nowe possesse, that certaine especially auaile to healthfull persons, for the preseruation and maynteynaunce of the health of bodye, as those on which we féede, by which a helpe to be cloathed, and defended by shoes, and that strengthen our bodyes, as well as certayne helping the sycke: and others also there be of such sorte, which both auayle to the healthfull, and sicke personnes, as the oyle Olyue doth: which as Galen wytnesseth, is of such condicion, that the same so necassarilye serueth the healthfull, as the sicke persons, in applying of it as well within, as without the bodye: For among those medycines, which are applyed on the outwarde partes, the Oyles beare not the least swaye, as well this symple, as the compounde oyles. And the vse of them is verye often, insomuch that wée are occasioned and procured sometymes to vse them alone, but wée often are mooued to vse them in the making of oyntments, Ceroltes, and playsters. And there be oyles and oyntmentes, that not onelye for theyr consistencie or styfuesse, but for theyr neere agreeing in vertue, that the oyles are often named of Dioscorides oyntinentes, as is the oyntment Nardinum Mastichinum, and such lyke, which many rather name oyles than oyntmentes, Yet many kyndes of oyles there bee.

Let the same pype passe bowingly or after a leaning maner (a slope) through the vessell, which hath in it colde water, that in the distylling the vapour issuing or going forth with the oyle, may so be cooled: before the distylling, remember to close dilygently the wyntes, with thicke paper or a lynnen cloath wette, and set vnder a Receauer or Glasse at the ende of the pype. After make an easie fyre, and take héede in the tyme of your distylling, that the substance in the glasse body, riseth not vp through a rashe heate, nor boyleth. Yet certaine seedes as the Annise, through the thynnesse of his substaunce, and clamminesse togyther which they haue, doe largely boyle, and for that cause may not the head be set on by and by or soone after: but rather when you see bubles aryse, and that a vapour to ascende withall, then prepare &amp; take of your head, and sturre the stuffe about with a small sticke, that the bubles and some may so be resolued into vapour, which may after by a meane fyre be moderated, aswaged, &amp; dryed vp▪ Which done, set on the head againe, and dilygently luted about, distyl orderlye so long, vntyll you thinke no more oyle to be contayned within: which both by syght and taste you shall by &amp; by perceyue, for when by taste the droppes distylling, carrye or haue no more

sauour nor taste of the spyce, then leaue of or ceasse, least the spice burne then to the bottome of the glasse. After seperate dilygently the oyle contayned in the distylled water, as after shalbe taught. But this note &amp; learne, that certaine of these oyles, doe swym on the water, and othersome doe syncke and fall to the bottome. Of which ye oyles of the black pepper, of the newe Cardamomū, &amp; the Annyse swymme aboue. But those which sincke &amp; fall to the bottome, be the oyles of Cynamon, of Mace, &amp; of Cloues, &amp;c. The water of Cynamon &amp; Annyse, when they are distylled, haue a mylkie coulour, and this mylkie substaunce is by lytle &amp; lytle chaunged into an oyle: this hytherto borrowed out of Valerius Cordus.
               
               Further vnderstande, that two matters or poyntes especially are required in the drawing out of oyles fyrst, that the substance haue plentie or sufficient water powred vpon, that the same may so be lyfted and caryed vpwarde, through which it maye the lesse be burned, or cōsumed. The other is, that eyther the head, yt pype, or long nose, be continually cooled, with most cold water, standing in some apt vessell fast by. Which two necessary helpes yeeld &amp; giue this vse, that the spyrites of the oyle, which be very subtyll and most hote, that as soone as they inflame and mightilye heate in a burning maner the headde, they forthwith by the cooling are repressed, and conuerted into an oyle.

And make the same of what largenesse, and bygnesse you wyll: yet seeing for two poundes of spyces, there ought twentie pyntes of water be

powred vpon (and that the Copper vessell must so be fylled, that a thyrde parte or a lyttle lesse be lefte emptie) euen as by this quantitie which seenieth a meane, you wyll distyll in it oyther more or lesse, make the bygnesse accordinglye of the earthen vessell: in whose bottome let fyne Sande be powred, vnto the thicknesse of a finger, or rather two fingers, and round about the bodie, for the drawing of oyles, out of spyces and seedes: but for hearbes, this maner needeth not.

               By what deuise and meanes an oyle which distylleth forth with the water, may be artlie seperated. The .vj. Chapter.
               THe seperation of an oyle, maye aptlie be done from the water, eyther with a syluer spone, especiallye if the oyle shall swym on the face of the water: or otherwyse which is by a more dilygēce &amp; skill, in preparing a peculyar instrument or funnel of glasse, seruing to the same purpose, as is this instrument or funnel, here placed,

right against, which hath in the bottom a hole stopped with waxe▪ or a vessell hauing three smal pypes contained in it, as the one retching to the bottome of the vessell, another to yt midle

of it, &amp; the thyrde to the highest of it. But further doth Bessonius vtter, in his lytle treatyse of the drawing of oyles, after this manner. Fyrst, he willeth the practisioner, to consider &amp; learne that the receauer ought to be made somwhat sharpe toward the bottom, &amp; to be like the poynt of a thing bored or stricken through, with many strokes of a small punchin or smal nayle. This hole then in the tyme of the distyllacion, stoppe dilygentlye with wrought waxe. The water &amp; oyle after distylled, &amp; set a tyme to coole in the ayre, marke then in the cleare receauer of glasse, what place the oyle occupyeth in the water. Which you shall well perceyue, by the dyuersitie of the colour. That if the same occupyeth the bottome, in taking or plucking away of the waxe frō the hole of the receauer, forthwith doeth the oyle yssue or runne into the viall or glasse set vnder, &amp; the water wyll rest behynd: if so be you mynd to kéepe, or to stay the water, by stopping the hole spéedily with waxe. But if the oyle occupyeth aboue the water, then in opening the hole agayne, the whole water shall be drawne forth softlye▪ and by lytle

               It is to be considered and noted, that out of thrée poundes of Turpentyne, myxed with one handfull of Salt, and a lytle of the essence of wyne, are fowre ounces and a halfe of the oyle of Turpentyne, distylled and gotten in Balneo Mariae. Yet they ought to stande, for certayne dayes before, to putrifye. Further that Turpentyne gyueth or yeeldeth more oyle of it selfe, if the same be distylled by a small pype, than by boyling water, is to be doubted.

which throughlye come, seperate then the oyle from that blacke water, and eache kéepe a parte by it selfe; and the lyke doe with the fyrst water, in seperating the oyle, and kéeping eache a part. The first water, which is whyte, is named the baulme water, the oyle seperated from that water, is named the baulme oyle. The seconde water blackishe, is named the mother of baulme, the lycour seperated from that water, is named the artificiall baulme▪ which ought to be kept, as a most precious Iewell. And this composition haue I gathered, and dygested into such a perfection, as in (my opinion) séemeth not no defull of any further addicion: besydes I haue made many practises and tryals, of all these matters, here vnder vttered. The first water come, and dropped into the eyes, doth marueylously cleare, and preserue the sight of the eyes: and washing the face with this water, maketh after a most comely &amp; bewtyfull face, it preserueth youth, and putteth of olde age, it breaketh and dyssolueth the stone of the kydneys, and causeth the pacient to pysse, which otherwyse is letted by a certayne fleshie stopping in the way: this also cureth all maner of wounds happening in any part of the bodye, and of what condicion so euer they be, by the washing with this water, and the applying vppon of Lynnen cloathes wette in this water, which sundrye tymes exercised, wyll shewe so marueylous a working, (as though the same were done by the blessed hand of God onely.) This besydes mightily helpeth the personnes in a consumption, and all maner of rewmes, and the coughe. This water also bathed or rather fomentedon the Sciatica or ache in the hyppe, causeth the payne forthwith to ceasse. That other water named the mother of baulme, fomented on scabbes, doth speedily and with marueilous easinesse heale them: and worketh the lyke on the fowle scurfe, the Leprie: and all maner of vlcers, which are not corrosyue, this water marueylously cureth, &amp; that without tediousnesse: and vnto infinite other grieffes also this serueth, that the Aucthour here ouerpasseth. The baulme oyle serueth vnto infinite matters and purposes, and especiallye for woundes of the headde, where bones be perished or harmed, and the pannickles: by powring into, and applying on it on the woundes. This preserueth the fa
                     •
                  e, by annoynting (after dyscretion) with it.
               This also doth marueylouslie helpe the Plewrisse, by giuing one

dramme with water at a tyme▪ and many other matters this worketh besydes. The Baulme is a marueylous lycour, for who that hath paine of the flankes or bowelles, by taking two drammes of this Baulme in the mouth, shall spedilie be eased and deliuered: this doth lyke helpe the cough, the rewme, the coldnesse of the head, and the stomacke: and for all woundes of the headde, this is a most synguler remedie, by annoynting all the headde about once a daye, for this pierceth into the brayne, and euen to the stomacke alowe. This also dissolueth any swelling happening in any part of the bodye, and in short tyme. This besides cureth the quartaine Ague, by annoynting all the bodie with it, in omytting no part vntouched, and the same in a shorte tyme: to be briefe, the Aucthour knewe at no tyme, any sicknesse or dissease, which he dyd not cure with this Baulme: in that this auayleth as well in the hote sicknesses, as in the colde: for the colde this heateth, and the hote sicknesses this (of a certayne hydde propertie) cooleth. To conclude I haue (sayth the Aucthour) founde and tryed such synguler vertues in this p

Wherefore I wyshe all menne and women (being of abilytic) to be alwayes prouided, and to carrie of this treasure with them, whether so euer they traueyle or iourney, for the health of bodie: in that the vse of this, defendeth them a long time, from any sicknesse or dissease, &amp; this is a most certayne truth, as the Aucthour of tryall knoweth.

               A Baulme lycour of Iohan Mesue, verye excellent, and most profitable vnto many grieffes and disseases: he tooke of thosen Myrre, of Aloes hepaticke, of Spykenarde, of Dragons blood, of pure Frankencense, of Munia, of Opobalsamum, of Bolellium, of Carpobalsamum, of Ammoniacum, of Sarcocolla, of Saffron, of Masticke, of gumme Arabicke, of Lyquide storax, of each two drammes (otherwyse two drammes and a halfe) of chosen Ladanum, of Succi castorei of eache two drammes and a halfe, of Muske halfe a dram, of the best Turpentyne, vnto the wayght of all: these artlie brought to powder, and myxed with the Turpentyne, and powred into a Glasse bodie with a headde, and the same strongly fensed with the lute of wisedome: distyll in the begynning with a softe fyre, and increasing the heate after, according to skyll and discretion: the lycour which aryseth by distyllacion, and artlye gathered, preserue in a strong Glasse, close stopped. This lycour draweth nighe, vnto the true iuyce of Baulme. Guido a cauliaco, dyd sometymes to this precious lycour, adde the hearbes appoynted and vsed to the Palsie, and then the worthyer, and much more effectuous (as he wytnesseth)

practyses, he wrought and did: And with this lycour alone, in the palsie, Mesue many times dealed, without the addition of any others, and had good successe, by annoynting the pacientes nape of the necke, and all the rydge bone of the backe downwarde, and that part affected or taken. For in this maner doyng, it marueylously helpeth the great debilitie of the backe, &amp; decayed strength of all the partes, and the depriuation of the synewes and bones. So that it much profiteth the Palsie, all the griefes of the synewes, the beating and trembling of the hearte, and a manyfest loosenesse of partes, through the secrete propertie incredible. And this conceaue, that there can no medycine bée inuented, nor founde worthier then it. For at any tyme, when the heart needeth any speedie comforting and strengthening, vse this as a singular and diuine remedie, if we may credite the learned practisioner Mesue.
               
               An oyle of the Philosophers, drawen out of Turpentine and Waxe, which is a certaine secrete Baulme hauing infinite vertues, excéeding all other lycours, that can be inuented and made, in that the same is made of two symples, which be but litle subiecte to corruption, or in a maner incorruptible, the one is Turpentine, which is a lycour dystilled and gotten of the Fyrre trée, and the other is the waxe, which is a celestiall matter, that discendeth or falleth from heauen, and that this is true, we throughly know, that nature neither produceth the honny nor waxe, but rather prepared and sent from heauen. And we after see that the Bees by their woonderfull skill and Arte (farre aboue mans towardnesse) gather the one, and the other, and carrie them to their home, which man by no industrie can gather one droppe the lyke, but to abreuiate this, the preparyng and makyng of this precious lycour, is on thys wyse, take of cleare Turpentyne eyghtene ounces, of sweete yealow waxe, twelue ounces, of the Ashes of the Wyne tree sixe ounces, these put togyther into a Retorte or crooked neckte glasse, artely luted and fensed, which after the setting into Ashes, distill accordyng to Arte, mayntayning a stranger and stronger heate, vnto the ende of the worke. And when no more wyll dystyll forthe, you shall then see aboute the necke of the Retorte

within waxe courded, which is a manifest sygne, of the distyllation perfourmed. This nowe distylled and gathered, stoppe dilygentlye with waxe, and kéepe to your vse, for you haue then a lycour lyke to Baulme in properties, which is of a syngular vertue, and much piersing. If any with this lycour, shall be annointed all the bodie ouer, it then by the sundrye tymes vsing, preserueth and mayntayneth youth a long tyme, and kéepeth all things put in it from corrupcion, and putrifying: and doth also kéepe the bodie a long tyme in health, and preserueth dead bodyes imbaulmed with it a long tyme. And a person wounded in any member or parte of the bodye, by onelye annoynting on the wounde thrée or fowre tymes, with this oyle, shall throughly be cured. And that personne which can not pysse, by taking onely two drammes of this lycour by the mouth, shall forthwith pysse plentifullye: and this the lyke mynistred, helpeth the greeuous payne of the flankes, stitches in the sides, the wormes in the body, the cough, the rewme, and pestilent Ague, and other lyke grieffes and disseases, by mynistring the abouesayd quantytie by the mouth, shall speedilye be delyuered. This borrowed out of the skylfull practyses, of the Greeke Leonarde Fierouant.
               
               A water or Baulme of Hermes, borrowed out of that booke, named Trotula, in the ende of the woemens passions: where he wylleth to take of Turpentyne thrée tymes distylled ouer, and at last all togyther one pounde, of Lignum aloes lykewyse three tymes distylled ouer one pounde, of crude Amber one pound, of Nutmegs beaten and grynded on a marble, vnto the maner of an oyntment, with the oyle of the same added, vnto the full incorporating of these to a masse: the whole distyll nine tymes ouer. This Baulme dilygentlie kéepe to vse, for it is then perfite and susteyneth all tryall of fyre and water: it soketh thorowe the hande, and by annoynting the face with it, the same preserueth youth, closeth and cureth any cutte or wounde, cleareth marueylouslie the sight: and by annoynting all the bodie with it, doth defende the same from putrifying, and from wormes feeding on it: these hytherto hath the Aucthour sundrie tymes done and experienced, and founde a most certaintie in them.
               
                  An oyle of Baulme maystriall, borrowed out of the dispensatorie of the colledge of Phisitions of Florence: which wylleth to take of Turpentyne one pounde, of olde Oyle sixe ounces, of the oyle of Bayes fowre ounces, of Spykenarde, and of Cynamon, of eache two ounces, of newe Tyles well baked eyght ounces, these after the well beating and labouring togyther, distyll in a Lymbecke after arte. This sendeth forth vryne, breaketh the stone, kylleth wormes in the bodie, the rynging and noyse of the eares procéeding of a grosse wyndinesse, the palsie, the fierce crampe, the ache of the hyppes, the payne in the knées, &amp; grieffes of the other ioynts: this speedily deliuereth and helpeth by drincking and annoynting with it, but a small quantitye at a tyme, and mynister of it, myxed with that water apte to the dissease, in the taking by the mouth.
               A marueylous oyle of Baulme, that cureth all manner of woundes, borrowed out of the practices of that synguler man Gabriell Fallopio Modouese: take of Turpentyne one pounde, of pure Frankensence, of Masticke, of Myrre, and of Sarcocolla, of eache one ounce, of good Aqua vitae eyght ounces, all these dilygentlye beaten and myxed togyther, put into a Retorte stronglie luted, with the lute of wisedome, the same after the setting in Ashes, distyll according to arte, begynning with a soft fyre, and increasing the fyre after by lyttle and lyttle, vnto the ende of the worke: the same substaunce gathered, wyll be an oyle and water, which orderlye seperate, and kéepe the one from the other a

parte: this seperacion may you make and doe on this wyse, take a Glasse funnell fylling it vp in a maner to the brymme with the distylled substance, holding one finger in the meane time vnder, and that stopping the neather hole: by this meanes, the water wyll fall to the sharper ende, and the oyle flote or swymme aboue: which by warylye shyfting your fynger (stopping the hole) now and then, the water wyll slyde or shedde forth, leauing the oyle fullie behynde, if you be carefull in the dooing.

These thus seperated, kéepe in seuerall glasses dilygentlye stopped. The Oyle is of such a vertue, that it healeth all maner of woundes, in a verie short tyme, and without payning at all. And of this hath Fallopio made the proofe many tymes, and especially on woundes of the head, in closing or stitching first the wounde, and applying after on the cutte, with lynt dypped in the Oyle: for this synguler Oyle dryeth the wounde, defendeth it from putryfiyng, and corrupting: and to be briffe, this Oyle worketh miracles. This secrete dyd he attayne of one M. George Catelyne a Genua, in Fraunce.

It easeth bruses, the crampe and palsie of a cold cause, &amp; a droppe mynistred to a person lying (or at the poynt of death) reuyueth him.

This helpeth poysoning, and comforteth al the members, and preserueth the blood in good colour, and from any maner putrifying, and helpeth a stincking breath.

The vse of this is, that the pacient vexed with the Palsie, convulsions, the crampe, and trembling of members, be layd vpryght, and of this oyle temperatelye hote powred vpon the bellye into the hollowe and bottome of his nauell: and you shall see after a marueylous working that may rather be accoumpted a dyuine, then naturall, and verye much helpeth the palsie, after a collicke.

                  ft fire, according to art.
               A precious water and marueylous, which auayleth in wounds, vlcers, and Fystulaes, and preuayle against the plague or Pestilence, and the vertue of it besydes is marueylous, but the whole

must be distylled by a glasse bodye with a head: For in such a maner of distyllation, doe then thrée lycours appeare, hauing dyuers colours, and eache ought properlye to be gathered a parte, and powred into sundrye glasses. And note, that the first water which commeth, auayleth against the plague, and ought daylye to be druncke in the plague tyme with a fasting stomacke: this also comforteth the brayne, by drawing vp of the water by the nosethrelles: this besydes destroyeth the piece of fleshe growne within the nosethrell causing a stynking ayre to yssue, and all other defaultes or euylles, growing within the Nosethrelles, in daylye touching this piece of fleshe within the Nosethrell with the sayde water. If daylye the temples, and the pulses, be fomented with this water, and the rydge or backe bone the lyke, in a warme place (as a hote house) shall spéedilye be cured. If any were fallen from any place, let him then be annoynted with the sayde water. If any hath a weake brayne or memorye, let the headde then be annoynted all about, but the forepart especiallye (being shauen) many tymes fomented warme with it, and he shall throughly bée cured. The sayd water drunck, maystreth and expelleth poysons forthwith. The sayde water auayleth, agaynst vlcers and woundes. Agaynst the Palsie of the tongue or other members, if they bée impostumated or cankered, and against any maner of sycknesse of the bodye. The seconde water which commeth, is lyke to oyle, and is an oyle, with which wée maye applye on places of the bodye, in steede of the Baulme: for if you styll one droppe into water, this droppe then goeth or falleth to the bottome, and maye be had or gotten agayne. If you also throwe a needle into the sayde lycour, it shall swymme aboue. This also cowrdeth mylke, and hath all the vertues, which seeme to be and are in a Baulme. The thyrde water, may be named a Baulme, whose vertues bée infinite. This borrowed of the learned Bertapalia: Take of the finest Turpentyne (in the steede of Oleum vici or Lachryma, of which two seemeth a contrauersie, whether to vse, and yet in the ende concludeth, that for the lacke of eyther, to vse Turpentyne, as not much dygressing from the purpose) of this therefore two poundes, of pure Hony skymmed two poundes, of good

                  Aqua vitae one pynte, of Lignum aloes pure, of Santali muscati, of Mace, of Cubebae, of Galingale, of Nutmegges, of Cloues, of Spykenard, of Masticke, of Gynger, of Cynamon, of Saffron, of graynes of Paradize, of eache thrée drammes, of gum Arabicke thrée ounces, of fine Muske halfe a dram.
               An oyle seruing vnto sundrye disseases, hauing the vertue of a Baulme, thus discrybed of D. Gesnerus (as I thincke:) take of the best whyte wyne two measures and a halfe, of newe Cowe mylk (new milked) thrée ounces, of good Hony eyght ounces, of the rootes of the Gentiane eyght ounces, of Astrantia thrée ounces, of Angelica two ounces, of chosen Baye berries one ounce &amp; a halfe, of Rue, of Iuniper berryes, of drye redde Roseleaues, of each one handfull, of Helycampane rootes one ounce, of Cloues, of the swéete ryndes of the Cytrone, of Calamus aromaticus, of Cynamon, of Annyse, of Fennell seedes, of Masticke, of Beniamyne, of eache halfe an ounce, these after the finely shredding and beating togyther, stiepe in a large glasse, or glasses (if you wyll) close luted, and set in a hote place for seuen or eyght dayes. After dystyll the whole with a head, &amp; Receauer, close luted in the ioynts, so great and large, that a thyrde part or more of the body remaine empty. This body set in fine sifted ashes, and distyll in the beginning with a softe fire, after increase the fire by lytle and lytle, vnto the ende of the worke. But the Aucthour supposeth the first distyllacion ought to be done a parte in another vessell, and that the wyne and mylke to bée first distylled togyther. Out of this distyllation, are also thrée lycours gotten and gathered. This water wyll auayle against poysons, the Pestilence, the stone, the quartayne, the cotydiane Ague, vnto sweating, moouing, &amp;c. This also helpeth the harde fetching of breath, and the obstructions or stoppings of the bowelles, vnto all flewmaticke matters, and vnto the Falling sycknesse, and to defende or preserue also the pacient from the Fallyng sycknesse. A man maye lyke coniecture, that this Baulme, for the makyng of a perfite Tryacle, to bée aptlye and to good purpose appoynted.
               The Aucthor of Nouia viatici, in the Chapter of the palsie, discribeth a like licour to the baulme: take of the whitest Frākensence, and of Mastick, of each two ounces, of Lignum aloes one ounce, of

Cloues, of Galingale, of Cynamon, of Zedoaria, of Nutmegges, and of Cubebae, of eache sixe drams, of Myrre, of Aloes, of Ladanum, of Sarcocolla, of Castorie, of each halfe an ounce, of Bay berries, of the kernels of the Pyne aple, of each one ounce, of gumme Elemi, of Opopanax, and of Beniamen, of each two ounces, of the iuyces of Iua, and the hearbe Paralycis or Cowselyp, of each three ounces, of good Turpentyne vnto the wayght of all, the whole dystyll in a glasse bodye, after arte. The first which commeth, is a water: the second, lyke to oyle: the thyrde lyke to Hony.
               A compounde oyle borrowed out of Aristotle, against the hote and colde gowte, and against the incuruacions of the synewes, so that the synewes be not cutte a sunder, borrowed out of an Italian booke written: take of Aqua vitae thryse distylled, and of the iuyce of Byttonie, of each three ounces, of Saffron, of the iuyce of Mugwoort, of the iuyce of walwoort, of the iuyce of Capreni or Caprellae, of eache fowre ounces, of the iuyce of march mallowes eyght ounces, of Cloues, of Carpobalsamum, of Xylobalsamum, of each two ounces, of Ceruse, of Frankensence, of the Tartare of the whyte wyne, of each thrée ounces, of chyldes vrine, and of good Hony▪ of eache eyght ounces, of the oyle of Turpentine thrée ounces, of the oyle of Egges fowre ounces, of the oyle of Brymstone two ounces, of the oyle of wormes sixe ounces, of the oyle of Rosemary halfe an ounce, of the oyle of Bayes three drams: let al these be distylled by a Lymbeck: the first which commeth, delyuereth the person from the hote gowte: the seconde▪ from the cold gowte, and healeth any maner payne, in what part of the bodye so euer the same shall happen, and bée.
               An oyle or water, which is named of vertue, &amp; a drinck of youth: borrowed out of a highe Dutche or Germayne booke written, of one Michaell Schricke. Take of Sage leaues three quarters of a pounde, of Cynamon, of Cubebae, of Galingale, of long pepper, of Annise, of Mace, of Nutmegs, of Gynger, &amp; of graynes of Paradize, of each halfe an ounce▪ these brought to powder, myxe artlye, which powre into sixe times so much wayght of good wyne as the whole, being in a tynne vessell, the same couer close, that nothing vapour or breath forth, &amp; let so stand in a hote place for fowreteen dayes. At the ende of that tyme, seperate the wyne frō the spyces,

by a strayner, &amp; beate the spyces then finer, that of the whole may be made lyke to a thicke broth or gruell, and with the aforesayde wyne ioyne the whole agayne, which then distyll according to art. This water distilled &amp; come, powred eyther on fleshe or fishe, and lying couered in it, doth defend and keepe eyther from putryfying: and wyne commyxed with it, doth not suffer it to corrupt, but rather cleareth it, and if the wyne presently be corrupt, this spéedily restoreth it vnto perfection. This druncke fasting in the morning, consumeth impostumes, and all inner disseases, &amp; healeth also the outwarde grieffes, by fomenting on the places: it amendeth besydes any maner grieffes of the eyes: and woundes, by applying of it vppon, within eyght dayes this closeth. This druncke, causeth myrth, and mayntaineth youth. This besydes auayleth in the disseases of the head, and apoplexie. This water (to be briefe) may be compared to baulme, for it swymmeth aboue any other lycour myxt with it, except oyle: dropped on the fire, this burneth. It cureth the spottes of the face, and druncke, defendeth or kéepeth backe the Leprie.
               A certaine sublymaciō like to a baulme, in procuring of memory, borrowed out of (Michael angelus Blondus) of memory. In remē
                  bring to orderly purge the stomack &amp; head before, which done, prepare of Frankensence, of Cubebae, of Cloues, of Nutmegs, of Galingale, &amp; of Iuniper berries, of eache halfe a dram, of Cynamon three drams, of Castorie fatte, three drams, of Costus, and of long Pepper, of eache a dramme: all these brought to powder, myxe a due proporcion of Aqua vitae answerable to the whole: these put vp togither in a glasse body couered, set into horse doong to digest, for the space of a. xi. dayes or more, &amp; longer time if you wyl: after this tyme ended, sublyme then this in Balneo Mariae, and to the sublymation adde, of Mellis anacardini two or thrée small ounces, and this then sublymed with the Hony, let be buryed againe in a glasse body vnder doong for ye space of two or thrée monethes, but let this doong be chaunged euery eyght dayes, least too much or to strong a heate may breake or cracke the glasse: by such a space of tyme, thi
                     •
                   sublymacion shalbe then perfite, vnto the sharpning &amp; quickening of memory. The vse of it is on this wyse, before you would apply for memory by a dayes space, annoynt the temples

and hinder part of the head, and instyll one droppe into the nosethrelles, after that, eate downe fasting in the morning certayne droppes, before you would reherse or vtter your Oration, or in any other manner (exercise of memory) for this is the worthyest medicine of procuring memory.
               An holly oyle, which is very singular vnto diuers diseases, for it especially auayleth against any Canker and Fistula, &amp; all olde griefes or diseases, borrowed out of a booke of secretes in written hande. Take of olde oyle Olyue two pyntes, of olde whyte wyne and the best, fowre pintes, of cleare &amp; the best Turpentine one pounde, of the seedes of Hypericon or Saint Iohns worte two pounds and one dram, of the white Dittanie, of the Tormentill rootes, and of the Gentian, of each one ounce: all these brought to pouder, and mixt togyther, putting the whole into a glasse bodie well stopped with paste, that no matter breath forth, procure that they may boyle in this manner. Let the said vessell be set into a c
                     •
                  uldron filled with water and straw and boyle there a time softly, after rayse it from the fier, and when it shalbe colde, put that vessel into a potte filled with sand, in such sort, that the whole vessell be compassed and couered vnto the necke with the said sande, which set in a place where the sunne al the day shineth, and there let it stand, for fortie dayes. After drawe it out of the said sande, and set it in the vessell of sand, in such order and maner, that the sunne for eyght dayes fully, may with his beames wholly compasse about it, which time ended, straine ye whole through a newe lynnen cloath, and presse out strongly the remnant in a presse, the oyle after seperate from the wyne, and the same kéepe a part, put vp into a glasse close stopped. This distillation ought rather bée done in the moneth of Iuly or August, then in any other tyme. This oyle gotten, auayleth against the Fistula and Canker, if eyther be washed before with the abouesayd wyne, and annoynted after with the sayde oyle, shall speedily and soone be cured. This 
                     •
                  yle also, helpeth all griefes, and paines of the synowes. This 
                     •
                  elpeth the ache of the hippes, the paynes of the ioyntes, &amp; a colde gowte. And if a plaister be made of it, and Ammoniacum, doth then dissolue the impostumes of the spléene, and the hardnesse of it, in a shorte tyme, it doth the lyke helpe, all other hard impostumes.

Thys auayleth in all passions of the eares procéedyng of a colde cause, it kylleth the wormes of the eares, and helpeth spéedily the hyssing, noyse, and deafenesse of them. This also helpeth the Palsie and drawyng awrye of the mouthe, if the same bee often annoynted wyth it. It prouoketh the termes, if of the same bee aptly applyed into the Matrice, and draweth forth the Embryo quicke or deade. If a lyttle of it be druncke, it dissolueth the curded blood in the bodye. If a small quantitie of thys oyle be commixed wyth the Syrope of Roses, doth then purge the Lunges of grosse and clammie humors, and such shorte winded. This marueylously helpeth all infirmities, and diseases of the eyes, but especially, the Cataractes. This druncke auaileth against poysons: for if the pacient shal drink a little of it, it extinguisheth any person. It speedily cureth the quartane and tertian Ague, if the backe and rydge bone bee annoynted wyth it agaynst the fyre, in the begynnyng of the fitte. Thys doth immediately take away &amp; delyuer the crampe or cōvulsion of wounds, if the same bée applyed warme on the place. This to conclude, healeth all woundes as well olde as new, yea better and perfecter in one day, then any other medicyne in a moneth.
               A Lyniment or thynne oyntment, as M. Michael Angelus Blondus wryteth in his booke of memorie, which in vertue may bee compared to a Baulme choose (sayeth he) of the beste Turpentyne thyrtie ounces, of the oyle of Bayes, sixe ounces, after that bring to powder, of gumme Elemi, of the Rosen of the Pyne apple trée, sixe drammes, of Sarcocolla two drammes, of gumme yuie, of Ammoniacum, of Bolellium, and of Frankencense, of eache two drammes, of Masticke, of Aloes Hepaticke, of Castorie, and of Ladanum of eache one dramme, of Galbanum syxe drammes, of Xyloaloes an ounce and a halfe, of Cynamon, of Cloues, of Nutmegges, of Mace, of Gynger, of Pepper, of Galingale, of graynes of Paradize, of Cubebae, and of Zedoaria, of eache one ounce, Xylobalsamum, Carpobalsamum, of tormentill rootes, of the whyte Dyttanye▪ of Liuerwort, of Celondine, of both the greater &amp; lesser Cons

                     lida, of eache one ounce and a halfe, these after the dilygent beating, myxe togyther, addyng to so much of Aqua vitae, as to make and

bring the whole into a fourme and bodie, which leaue so for thrée dayes, the fourth day following, adde to it the Turpentyne, the oyle, and Rosen, &amp; other of the gums which can not be powdered, these then sublime in a glasse body according to Arte, making in the beginning a soft fire, but continuing the fire vnto the end, and for that three kind of lycours are sublimed and gottē of the whole, as in the same, that the first which shall come, will then appeare yelowishe, the second and next oylie, but the third of a swartyshe colour, and as the chaunging of colours, euen so put vnder other receauers, kéeping each seuerall and a part, and those close stoppe with waxe, that no ayre breath forth. But this one thing doth the Authour admonishe and giue vs to vnderstande, that the fyre bee studiously cared for and looked vnto, vntill the sublimation of the whole shall be performed, for in the stopping or slaking of fyre in that time, the lycours could then not be throughly drawen &amp; gathered. These three lycours to be briefe, or rather this sublimation tryple wise, be indewed with properties, agreeable or answerable to their degrees, yet the first of these lycours, is of lesser power in properties, then the other, and ye second weaker in vertue then the thirde, so that the thirde is mightier and worthier then both, or the other two. The report is, that besides the quickning and helping of memory, they represse the hollow vlcers, mayster the canker that it cleaueth not to the bone, they also sease convulsions, helpe colde rewmes, vanquishe the langours and griefes of the stomacke, and the colde tormentings of the body, especially of the Bowells, they cure also the noyse of the eares, the grieuous paynes of the teeth, helpe the synew drawen togyther or shrunke, and they dissolue harde gatherings and swellings they mayster and helpe many colde langours, and recouer memorie lost, by annoynting the hynder parte of the heade wyth it, it draweth downe and purgeth the heade of all humours offending, through the helpe of the roote Cyclaminus, put vp with it into the nosethrells, as the Authour reporteth and instructeth. After this, let the pacient swallowe downe, of the pilles of Hiera Mag▪
                   with Agaricke, one dram, and the day after draw vp certaine drops of this oyle into the nosethrells, in that this procureth ye vertues of the braine, quickneth vnderstanding, &amp; recouereth memory. If so

be the temples and hynder part of the head, be annointed for certayne bayes with it.
               This also is a certaine composition of a baulme: take of cleare Turpentine seuen ounces, which washe well in wyne, after take of Hony whyte, thrée pyntes, cleane skymmed ouer a softe fyre with a lytle wyne, to the same well clarifyed myxe very well the Turpentyne, powring vpon fowre pyntes of good Aqua vitae, to these then adde of Borrage, of Buglosse, of Baulme, of Sage, and of Lauender, of eache one handfull, of Hysope, of Camomyll, of Yarrow, of redde Roseleaues, of each halfe a handfull, of wormewoodde one dram, of Rosemary two handfuls: to these after adde of Lignum aloes, of Xylobalsamum, and of the thrée Saunders, of each one dram, of Mace, of Nutmegs, of Cynamon, of Galingale, of Cloues, of Cubebae, of whyte Ginger, of long Pepper, of Saffron, of Spykenard, of graynes of Paradize, of Cardamomum, of eache one dram, of Zedoaria halfe an ounce, of Squinanthum half a dram, of the ryndes of the cytrone, the séedes of the cytrone, of Stoechas, of eache one dram, of Calamus aromaticus, halfe a dram, of Carlina that is cardopacia two ounces, of Bistorta two drams, of Ireos or the flowre De luce, halfe an ounce, of Baye berryes, of Valerian, and of Polypodie, of eache halfe an ounce, of Lycoryse, and of Annise, of each halfe a dram, of Fennel séedes two ounces, of Colyander séedes prepared halfe an ounce, of that wythie on the mountaine, and of Cummine, of each one dram, of blaunched Almondes, halfe a pound, of Reysons of the Sunne washed with wyne, halfe a pounde, all these orderly stamped and beaten togyther, put into the abouesayd bodye or Cucurbyte with the Hony &amp; others. And if there be not sufficient of Aqua vitae, powre then more vpon the whole, letting these stand to digest for seuen dayes close stopped, after distyll the substance in syfted ashes, set within thrée fingers breadth of the bottome of the potte, &amp; the ashes artly put about the bodye, the head and Receauer being artly luted in the ioyntes, that no ayre breathe forth, which after sublyme for fowre howers, with a verie soft &amp; easie fyre (least the Hony boyleth vp) and a cleare water then yssueth &amp; is gathered in the Receauer: after which, increase the fyre, and you shall see come a yellowe water, then drawe awaye the Receauer, putting vnder

If you will apply of this white water to the head, then adde to it of Bytonie or of Buglosse water one ounce, which mixe and drinke in the morning fasting. For this fortifyeth all ye members. To an ounce of Malmesie or good wine, adde a sponefull of this water, which myxed togyther will bée whyte as milke, the same drynke with a fasting stomacke two howers before meate, and it preserueth all the members.

It cureth the Canker by annoynting with it, and dropped into the Fistula spéedily healeth it: this helpeth a colde ache in any of the ioyntes, by applying of it vpon. In Agues, adde to it of Folefoote halfe a handfull, which put into a glasse with a quarter of a pynte of Alome water, letting these stande to dygest for three dayes, which after shyfte into another glasse, then of these an hower before the comming of the fytte of the Ague, drincke one sponefull, and annoynt the Temples, the Nose, the pulses, the backe, and the Mylte.

And Falloppio on a time, cured a scholler (being a young man) with this lycour, which had fourteene woundes, &amp; of these eyght were deadly, by sowing or stitching all the wounds, and applying only of this lycour vpon, was in the space of thyrtie dayes throughly cured, without annoyance to the pacient.

For this vndoubtedly is, a diuine lycour in such an accident, in which as you perceyue the Scorpions be, that are venemous beastes, and theyr venome auayleth against venome, &amp; such as are poysoned, euen as one poyson (of propertie) driueth out another, &amp; as we dayly sée that a person through druncke, by drincking after the iuyce of the Cabbedge with wyne, doth sone after become sober, which the wyne alone doth not. A lyke to this, that if a man happen to be burned in any place with fire, that the presentest remedie is, to burne the same place againe, as a soueraigne helpe experienced. And a lyke also to this, that if a man happen to be deepe wounded, that he sheddeth of the same much blood, the next remedie then is, as hath bene

many tymes tryed, to let the pacient bléede of a veyne.

But in such maner prepared, that the matter alter not, &amp; be by that meanes, a more harme to the poysoned. For that cause, the maner of applying the oyle against poyson, ought on this wyse be done: when any needeth ye vse of this remedy, let the paciēt then be outwardly annoynted with it, and take immediatly two drams of it by the mouth, with whyte vineger, as well in the morning, as at night before the going to bedde, &amp; he shall throughly be cured of any great poyson. Vnlesse it be eyther Sublimatum, or dyamonde, which this remedy helpeth not, in that they be no poysōs, yet deadly myneralles, that in no maner can dygest, nor their euyl effect but lytle mytigated. Notwithstanding if any shall be intoxicated with Sublimatum, he needeth then no other, but to bath him selfe in Vineger, to drincke plenty of mylke, to eate often butter, &amp; to drinck the whaye of mylke, at a sure &amp; true remedy experienced. It shall also be good &amp; necessary, that the pacient vomitte once a day for a tyme, for the readier purging &amp; emptying of the stomacke of that matter.

And if through the oyle, the care shall be heated, or swell, in so much that some rottennesse or matter beginneth to yssewe forth: conceaue then that onely a lytle of this oyle hote, put thus euery nyght in the eare, may so cure such Scroffles, &amp; the matter of them by the same shall so be emptied and wholy purged. And vse or perseuere with this oile, after the abouesayd maner, vntyll the pacient be throughly cured. But if the eare shall neyther swell, nor runne any thing, then may you vse other

apte reméedies to the purpose.
               An oyle, or certaine great lycour of the famous gréeke Leonarde Fiorauant, being a composition of most excellent vertue, in sundry workings: the making of which, is on this wyse. Take of oyle Olyue twenty pyntes, of whyte wyne two pynts, these boyle gently togyther vnto the consumpcion of the wine, or vnto al the wyne be gone away in smoake. Which after powre into an earthen potte glased, stopping the mouth very close with clay, the same then bury two cubites déepe or more in the earth, and let it there so stand couered with earth for sixe monethes. But the tyme when to bury or set this potte into the earth, ought to be about the first or second day of August, &amp; to be drawne or taken forth of the earth agayne, must be in the moneth of Februarie: which opened, the oyle wyll then appeare, as if it were fyftie yeares olde. But when you mynde to bury the potte, then put in these insewing: of Rosemary flowers, three poundes, of Lignum aloes sixe ounces, of Frankensence, and Bolellium, of each ten ounces. And after the drawing forth of the potte, and setting it in the Sunne, adde these folowing: of Sage, of Rosemary, of Rue, of Byttonie, of yarrow, of the roote of Campherie, of Tamarisci, &amp; of Bryonie, of each one handfull, of Galingale, of Cloues, of Nutmegs, of Spykenard, and of Saffron, of each one ounce, of Sarcocolla, of Dragons blood, and of Masticke, of each two ounces, of Aloes hepaticke, and of Rosen of the Pyne trée, of eache eyght ounces, of Gréeke pytche one pound, of yellow waxe, and of Barrowes greace, of ech eyghtéene ounces, of S. Iohns woort with the seedes two pounds, of Muske one dram, these after the dilygent myxing togyther, boyle in Balneo, vntyll the hearbes appeare drye in it, and that no more substaunce seeme to bée gotten out of them, which after the being on such wyse, drawe them forth, and straine them through a cloath: to the lycour adde for ech pound wayght, sixe drams of the natural baulme (of Fiorauants inuention.) And when September is come, to it adde (in that moneth) two pounds of the freshe fruites, of that hearbe named Balsami which be redde: this done, you haue then the greater lycour prepared and in a redinesse, which dilygently stoppe that no ayre breath forth: and this lycour also, the older it shal be before the occupying, the better it worketh. For this is of such a vertue, that it healeth consumpcions, and

dropsies, in the ministring foure drams waight of it, with one oūce of the syrupe of Roses hote by the mouth, euery morning fasting: which for forty dayes thus giuen, doth throughly cure them. This also is a true &amp; perfite oyntmēt, with which Petechiae are throughlie cured, by annoynting the places sundry tymes with it. And any wounded, and hauing the veynes, the sinewes, and bones cutte, by closing or stitching the wounds, &amp; applying of this oyle vpon hote, shall in short tyme be cured, without any alteracion or great paine to the pacient. This also cureth the scurfe, by annoynting those places of the head with it. For the coldnesse of the head, &amp; rewmes, by applying of it to the nosethrelles morning and euening, shall spéedily be cured, without the vse of any other thing: and this it doth through his sharpe sauour and piersing, which entereth and flyeth to the head &amp; stomacke, and doth so dissolue those corrupt humours, both in the head &amp; stomacke: in that this is a lycour, which preserueth from any corruption. And if the stomacke be annoynted rounde about with the oyle, it procureth a good digestion of meate: it also mooueth vryne retained, or that cannot pysse, through a fleshinesse stopping it, or the Gonorrhaea, or of any other cause. This causeth besydes the heyres to growe, &amp; preserueth the beard blacke a long tyme, and auayleth against wormes, artly applyed. And all these practises are most true, and proued many tymes in the abouesayd diseases &amp; grieffes, and in many others, and neuer harmed nor pained any pacient with it, except such infected with ye French disease: for annoynting any such with this, it mightily paineth him: by which at any time you shal throughly be perswaded, whether the pacient be vexed with the same, or any other disease.

               THe oyle of Spyke is thus prepared, if so be the Spyke be infused in wyne, and distylled, an oyle fyrst followe, where a water otherwyse by distyllacion (I gesse in Sande) shoulde be seperated. This oyle annoynted on the region of the kydneys, helpeth the Gonorrhaea. A certayne friend (of the Aucthours) hauing his wyfe nowe and then sicke, procured to be ministred to hir in a draft of wyne, but two drops of the distylled oyle of Spyke, which

after shée had druncke downe, was brought by it in great hazard of lyfe, but through it, shee voyded soone many worms, and recouered within short space.
               The oyle of the common Spykenarde, which is brought out of Fraunce, doth Brassanolus commend: but he affyrmeth that lyttle woorth, or of lesser accoumpt to be made of, which certayne prepare &amp; make of the Lauender in Italie: the same (writeth he) that many name a Balsamyne, &amp; vse it in the stéede of a naturall baulme. Of the oyle of Spyke, which many vsed in the steede of baulme, and of his properties: was fullie and at large vttered in the other booke, or first part of the treasure of Euonimus.
               
               The oyle of the flowers of Verbascum, is thus made: stampe the flowers in a morter, which after the putting into a glasse, set in the Sunne close stopped, for fiue or sixe wéekes: this oyle much auayleth &amp; is right profitable for the gowte in the feete and other members. It cureth also freshe wounds, &amp; if the same be infused in the oyle Olyue, it wyll then serue vnto many grieffes. The flowers ought to be gathered, when they be drie, for the vertues sake.

               The oyle of S.

The preparing &amp; making of the oyle, is on this wyse, borrowed out of the naturall hystorie, of Adamus Leonicerus. Take of the tops being presently full rype, of S. Iohns woort three ounces, let these be stieped in pleasant wyne for thrée dayes, after let those boyle in a double vessell, stopping dilygentlie the mouth of the vessell, which in a redynesse wryng hard out, putting in a lyke wayght of the Hypericon freshe gathered, and infusing it in lyke order, as aboue taught, which after boyle, &amp; strayne, and doe this a thyrde tyme: and if the wyne be dyminished before the ende, then adde a lyttle more, according to discretion.

This also dissolueth bruses, auayleth agaynst poyson, and helpeth any crude kynde of venymous Ague, by annoynting all the pacientes bodye, without omytting any part: and many other vertues hath this oyle, which for breuitye are here omytted: the making of which, is on this wyse. Take of the Flowers, Leaues, Stalkes, and rootes of Saint Iohns woort, as much as you wyll, which stampe togyther in a morter, stieping it after in the best whyte wyne, as much as wyll well couer the substaunce, the same let stande in the Sunne for tenne whole dayes, powring into it after of oyle Olyue, as much as the wayght of the whole with the wyne, these then let stande in the Sunne for other tenne dayes: herein considering, that the oyle before be wayed, whereby a iust wayght of it may be knowne. This done, adde for euerie pounde of the oyle, two ounces of good Turpentyne, of Saffron one dram to euery pound, of the Nutmegs and Cloues, of each halfe an ounce to euery pound, of Myrre, &amp; Rosen of the Pyne trée, of eache fifteene ounces for euery pounde, of Vitecella two ounces

for euery pound: let all these be put into a body of glasse, well incorporated togyther, which after set into Balneo Mariae, letting it there boyle, with the head close set on, and the Receauer artly luted to the nose of the head. The note when this is sufficiently boyled, when the head distylleth no more forth, and this wyl be within twentie howers or there about: this seene, drawe forth the body, &amp; whyles the substaunce yet boyleth, strayne the whole through a cloath, keeping this lycour close stopped in a glasse, as a precious iuel: for with this (as we haue aboue vttred) may many matters be done, so that you lay of this hote on the vpper face of wounds, with out the applying of tentes within: &amp; in such maner doing, you shall wynne great praise, &amp; haue prosperous successe at al times. For the Aucthour (many &amp; sundry wise) proued this oyle, to his estimation.
               The oyle of Hypericon (although the same may many wayes be prepared and made) yet this waye and maner is the perfitest, inuented by a singuler Chirurgian of Dadna, named Gabriell Fallopio: take of Bolellium, of Opopanax, of Galbanum, of gum Serapinum, of gum Elemi, of each one dram, of Turpentine, of Rosen of the Pyne tree, &amp; of Masticke, of each one ounce, of the earth worms washed with white wine two ounces, of Antimoniū, of the flowers &amp; leaues of Hypericon, of playntaine, of the greater &amp; lesser Consolida, of the greater and lesser Centorie, of the yarrow, &amp; of Canda aequina or horse tayle, of ech thrée ounces: al these yt are to be beatē, somwhat broken afore, which then myxe togyther in a glasse body, with so much oyle (but better the same shal be, if it be with the oyle of Roses) as wyll well couer the whole substaunce, &amp; infused thus in the oyle, let the glasse stande in the Sunne, for fifteene dayes. This oyle with the whole substaunce put into a Retort, which dystyll with a soft fire, for the first that commeth is a water, the next yt foloweth (by a stronger fire increased) wyl be an oyle, at the comming of which change the receauer, &amp; maintayne the fire vnto the ende of the worke: the distyllacion ended, adde the water &amp; oyle togither in a glased pan, which boyle for an houre: to which after adde one ounce of Madder, of Graua sina halfe an ounce, of Saffron two drams, &amp; a handfull of the flowers of S. Iohns woort, putting it againe into the glasse, where the whole substance stāding in ye Sun was. But if you wyll make a most precious oyle of it, burye the glasse with the lycour in the earth or horse doong, for sixe moneths:

of which after apply on any wound, &amp; you shall then sée a miraculous working of this oyle, for it seaseth the paine of woundes, it drieth vp, cleanseth, and comforteth, and doth the same which may be wrought by any, and is especiallie profitable to woundes of the synewes. The vse of this oyle is, that it ought to be applyed hote on the grieued places.
               Another mastryall cōposition, of the oyle of Hypericon, right profitable for woundes, borrowed out of the Italian secretes, of the abouesayd Aucthor: take of cōmon oyle Oliue, that is sweete, &amp; pleasant of tast, as much as you thinke needeful, into which put so much of the Hypericon, the flowers, &amp; seedes, as yt oyle wyl well receyue, this let so stande in a glasse, vntyll the oyle appeareth redde, into which after put these: of Turpentine one ounce for euery pounde of the oyle, of Nutmegs, of Saffron, &amp; of Beniamine, of ech one drā, for euery poūd of the oyle, of claryfied Barrowes greace, two ounces for euery pound of the oyle, of yarrow, of redde Roseleaues, of Campherie, &amp; of Cummine, of ech one ounce and a halfe, for euery pound of the oyle, of the best wyne two ounces, for euery pound: let these infuse togyther, for the space of a moneth, after shyft all the substaunce into a glasse body, with a couer which set into Balneo, letting the substance there boile, vnto the cōsumption of the wine, &amp; drynesse of the hearbes: after the taking forth, strayne the whole through a lynnen cloath, which preserue in a glasse close stopped. This oyle is marueylous, vsed on woundes: if so it be applied hote with lint, or a fine lynnē cloth vpon yt woūd. This oile also auaileth against poyson, &amp; helpeth Petechiae, &amp; swellings or knobs, by anointing of it on the places, &amp; that with expedicion. And with this oyle hath ye Author done many singular practises, to his high cōmēdatiō.

                  The oyle of the Iasemyne flowers maye in a lyke maner bée purchased, by ordering the flowers as aboue vttered: and if you thincke the yéelde not sufficient at a tyme, then maye you increase the same (in my opinion) with the iourdaine Almondes cleane scraped, and broken after discrecion.
               An oyle of the Damaske Roses, maye in a lyke maner be obtayned: if so be you breake Almondes into small partes, being cleane scraped before (and not blaunched) and ordered as aboue taught, of the oyle of Orrendge flowers: which after put into bags, presse forth an oyle.
               An oyle of Roses by sunning, is prepared and made on this wyse, as Rogerius in his fowrth treatyse and eyght Chapter instructeth. Take the Flowers of gréene Roses, and fyll the glasse with the flowers and oyle, in such maner: that to one pounde of Roseleaues, be two poundes of oyle added, which dilygently stopped, set the glasse in the Sunne, for fortie dayes, sturring about the flowers once a daye. After such a decoction, strayne it through a Lynnen cloath, into a Bason of fayre colde water, and labour or styrre the oyle about with a Hasill sticke whyte scraped, after shift the oyle into another Bason of cold water and sturring it, and this doe tenne tymes togyther. For through this often washing, it purchaseth a coldnesse in working, and a lesser drynesse. By which it doth after more coole, and moysten. Also the substaunce put into a glasse &amp; set in the Sunne, vntyll the moysture which entreth the powres, may through the same be consumed. In a colde countrey, where through a weake heate of the ayre this can not be decocted, let the glasse be set into a panne of water, that it may there softlye boyle for two or three dayes, vnto a thyrde part of the oyle awaye: &amp; if that countrey hath not oyle Olyue, then draw an oyle of freshe Nuttes scraped, with which make your oyle of Roses: or otherwise vse olde Nuttes scraped cleane, and stieped for two dayes in colde water, after let an oyle be pressed forth. Whereof the Aucthour alleageth, that the mylke drawne or made of freshe Nuttes, may so safely be giuen to the sicke of the Ague at all tymes, in a cold countrey: as the Almonde mylke, in a hote countrey. This oyle also aboue taught, hath sundrye properties, for if a pacient vexed with the Ague, be daylye or often annoynted about the forehead, and

temples, and paulmes of the handes, the soles of the féete, and on the beating veynes of the wrestes, this note onely represseth the payne of the head, and other partes, but altereth the heate and procureth sléepe, yet this in no case, may be done in the sick day, where you hope of the vniuersall or particular action. A singuler remedie cōmended, that the yolkes of Egges be laboured with the oyle of Roses, and layde playster wyse on the region of the Lyuer, or vpon a fyrie impostume: which being once, or twyse applyed, doth marueylouslie mitigate paine, and doth dissolue the fumositie, and sharpnesse of matter. And the same cleanseth the place or swelling to fal, &amp; remooueth the rednesse from the place. This oyle also mixt, with a lyke wayght of the iuyce of plaintayne, for a glyster in the blooddy fluxe, or perylous scouring with blood is greatly commended, this doth spéedily bring woundes to a scarre, and mytigateth the payne, by repressing the matter.
               These oyles afore placed, although they be prepared and gotten without distyllation, or but by pressing out, or otherwyse made by the Sunne: yet would I not omytte them, in that these formes and wayes, séeme easie, comely, and to skyll inuented: and oyles being thus prepared, may aptly be applyed to mens vse, and vtilytie.
               The oyle of Violettes, is prepared &amp; made of Violettes, in the lyke maner, as the oyle of Roses (out of Rogerius) and serueth to lyke purposes, as the oyle of Roses, sauing that the one ofter the newe making is laxatiue, and the other bynding. If with a lyke wayght of ye iuyce of Mercurie, this oyle be applied in glyster wise, in the sharpe daylie, and renewing Agues, and Tertians, the same gently doth louse the bellie, and easilye expelleth the superfluities, by the excrements sent forth. This out of Rogerius.
               
               An oyle helping the spottes of the face, which commonly we name Lyntelles: take a sufficient quantitie of the flowers of Rosemarie (which put into a glasse) burye it in hote horse doong, in a place frée or safe from rayne, for thyrtie dayes, or vnto the time, the flowers be dyssolued, after set the glasse in the Sunne for o
                     ••
                  er nyne dayes: putting into it then of the powder of Pollypodie, so much as you maye take vp with thrée fyngers: of which let the pacient euery day take, for one whole moneth.
               An oyle of the Rosemary flowers not distylled, may be drawne

and made after the maner ensewing, borrowed out of a certayne written booke in the Italian tongue: take of Rosemarie flowers, a good quantitie, putting them into a potte, and thrusting them harde downe with a staffe. After powre vpon of oyle Olyue, so much as shall be sufficent, that a part of the potte remayne emptie: which done, close and stoppe dilygently the mouth of the potte with paste, that no ayre breath forth. The potte ordered on this wyse, set or burie in horse doong, not made of haye: in such wyse letting the potte stande, that the doong be more then thrée fingers aboue the mouth of the potte: the same so standing for fortie dayes, drawe after forth, and kéepe the oyle carefully. When you wyll vse of the oyle, strayne it through a cloath. This mightily helpeth in the grieffes and paynes of the Loynes, the ache in the hyppes, the Armes, and other partes. It is in the lyke maner appoynted, and prepared of the Erle De alta villa.
               
               
            
            
               Of the oyles out of Seedes. The .xiij. Chapter.
               SEeing that sundry Spyces, and the séedes of all hearbes in a maner, be rather of a hote, thinne &amp; ayreall substaunce: for that cause, it must néedes insewe, that these possesse a certaine oyly substance. In that euery oyle in a maner, hath a lyke myxture. Nowe oyles distylled or gotten out of séedes, as well hote, as colde, are purchased in this maner.
               These oyles by distyllacion drawne in Sande, ought on such

wyse be prepared, that the séedes before the putting into the Cucurbite be brused, and the glasse verie well fensed about with the lute of wysedome. And there may, sixe, or seuen, or eyght ounces of any seedes brused, be put into the glasse at a tyme, or more if you wyll, but this according to the greatnesse of the Cucurbite. After powre fyue, or sixe, or seuen pyntes of the clearest water at a tyme on the seedes, myxing the whole dilygently togyther. Which thus myxed dilygently in the infusion, let stande to infuse, or dygest, or putryfye, in some hote place, for certayne dayes, as eyther eyght, or tenne dayes, after set the Cucurbyte into a potte apte to the Furnace, which fyll so with Sande, that the Cucurbyte standing in it, toucheth not the bottome, by two fyngers breadth, and that a good thycknesse of Sande be rounde about the bodie. And let the oyle be distylled in the same maner, and with the same vesselles, as shall after be vttered: whereas wee teach the order of drawing of oyles, out of Spyces and wooddes. This by the waye doth the Aucthour warne you of, that at the fyrst you make a softe fyre: and take heede, that the substaunce contayned in the Cucurbyte, boyleth not vp vnto the Lymbecke or headde. For certayne seedes, as the Annise séedes, through the thynnesse of theyr substaunce, and clammynesse togyther which they possesse, doe myghtilye boyle vppe: for which cause, you maye not by and by fyxe on the headde: but after you see bubbles aryse, and the vapour carryed vpwarde, take of the Lymbecke, and puttyng in a fayre stycke, sturre the substaunce well about. And on such wyse may the fome or bubbles be resolued into vapour, and breath vp, which maye after with a meane fyre, bée qualyfied, and increased, at the wyll of the Practysioner. Which thus mytygated or alayde, set on your Lymbecke close luted about, and distyll or drawe so long vntyll you suppose that no more oyle bée contayned wythin, which by syght and taste, you shall easilye and soone perceyue. For when the droppes distylling, in taste, carrie with them no more vertue of the manifest qualitye of the seedes and Spyces put in, then must you ceasse gathering any more, least the matter sticke, or burne in the bottome of the Cucurbyte: this borrowed out of Cordus.
               
               
                  A preparation of oyles out of séedes, as of the Fennell, Annise, &amp;c. Is wrought after this maner, as the Aucthour gathered &amp; learned, by the sundrie letters written vnto the singuler Gesnerus in the Germaine tongue. Fyrst, I tooke (sayth he) such a quantitie of seedes, as I thought necessarye, but a fiue or sixe poundes alwaeys: those I so stamped or beate in a grosse manner, that I left no one seede vnbroken, which I then powred into the Cucurbyte. After I powred vpon so much scalding or verie hote water, that well couered the seedes, and then set on the Lymbecke or head, close luted in the ioynt about, and stopped the nose, that no ayre breathed forth: which standing to putrify for thrée or fowre dayes, I after distylled with a soft fyre, &amp; a fayre oyle followed (so that the water by which the oyle passeth, be very colde) as you were afore taught. This one matter is worthy to be considered, that the oyle of Annise séedes can not in the Summer tyme be distylled at all, for that theyr spyrites then are ouer subtyll, &amp; the Fennell seedes at that tyme much subtyller then them: which they euaporate through the heate in that season, howe easie so euer you make your fire vnder, or labour you
                     •
                   distyllacion. So that the aptest and meetest tyme for the dystyllacion of these, is in the wynter: in that the colder the ayre shall then be, so much the sooner, when the oyle shall fall into the Receauer, wyll it be cowrded togyther, lyke to Camphora. Which when after you shall strayne through a fayre cloath, all the water then runneth through, but the oyle remayneth on the cloath: which I after (sayth the Aucthour) dyssolued in a gallie or broade mouth glasse set in a stewe or hote house, and the flewme so seperated.
               In the distylling of such maner of oyles, must first be considered and noted, that a man may not prepare and distyll more then halfe a pounde at a tyme. After remembring, that the matter to be dystylled, be brayed or broken in a morter, after a grosse maner, and not in a subtyll or fine powder. To this matter then let a due quantitie of pure water be powred, that it maye couer the séedes, which after powre into a copper Cucurbite, and well myxed togyther, set on a copper head, close luted to the bodye in the ioynt, that no ayre breath forth. This distyllacion then ought to be done through a vessell fylled with colde water, the tynne or leaden pype retching to the nose of the head, whereby the oyle (in the distylling)

may not burne. All which thus prepared, make a very soft or slow fire in the begynning, vntyl the Furnace waxeth hote, then increase your heate or fire, more &amp; more, as the matter beginneth to distyll: the water &amp; oyle all come, seperate the one from the other, after art. When this begynneth to distyll, you may withdraw some of the fire, and marke whether the fyre being at that stay, the distyllacion neuerthelesse procéedeth, then must the strō
                  ger heate or fyre be left, and the other followed and mayntained: but if otherwise, then let the heate be increased. Thyrdly must be considered &amp; learned, that the oile fyrst distilleth, so that at the cō
                  ming of the second, or thyrde oyle, the receauer may be changed. And within an howres space in a maner, wyll halfe an ounce be distilled and gathered in the receauer. So that when no more lyquidnesse appeareth on high, in the Cucurbite, then wyl no more matter distyll forth: and the work vpon this sight, is fully ended.
               The oyle of Annise seedes, is thus prepared &amp; drawne: take of Annise seedes (for this is a cōmon forme &amp; waye, vnto the distylling also of oyles, out of other séedes) one pounde, these after ye grosse beating, r
                     •
                  t into a horned or croke necked body, to which let the receauer be artly closed &amp; fastned, setting the body thē into a pot of ashes, the same distyl with a most soft fyre, &amp; you shall gather a water &amp; an oyle in the receauer. The water you shal draw forth by a reuoluing or repeting againe of the whole substance: yt oyle remaining or tarrying behind in the body, whose vse serueth vnto the collicke passion, &amp; paine of the bowels. But of the water is an electuary made with Sugar, in the forme of losings or Manus christi, of which one table at a tyme, eyther after dynner, or after supper may be giuen or taken. For this strengthneth ye stomack &amp; digestion, &amp; putteth away or expelleth wynd. This at any time takē or vsed profiteth, but in ye morning especially: &amp; helpeth the lungs, the cough, &amp; the obstructions or stoppings of choller, &amp; helpeth the inward parts. The vse of it properly, is in droppes.
               The oyle of Annise is much more in property, then the Annise it selfe, and in working myghtier. Yet the naturall heate, of the whole Annise seede, can neuer be so exactly purchased, as to draw forth &amp; seperate a perfite substance: although an artificiall preparation may be wrought, &amp; the same by mans industry. For like

as any meate, that the same may be taken &amp; eaten, without daunger or harme, it néedeth before an outward preparation: euen so must a lyke preparation be wrought in medicines, that the subtyller parts be seperated from the grosser, before those be applied or taken within the body: for on such wyse prepared and ordered, may any medicine worke the easier, &amp; performe the proper action in the body, without harme to the pacient. The vse of this oyle much auayleth in the gyddinesse of the head, the harde fetching of breath, procéeding through a dangerous Rewme in a maner suffocating or choking the person, in the weaknesse of stom
                     •
                  ck and wyndinesse, in the dropsie, in other colde diseases, and those procured of wynd. This also much profiteth the members lacking blood; and the synew partes, as the stomack, the veynes, the bladder, the bellye, and the whyte fluxe of the wombe this mightilye stayeth. This oyle may be taken or ministred by droppos, in gyuin certain droppes of it eyther in wine, or in breath in the morning, or in tyme of necessitie.
               The oyle of Fennell séedes helpeth the head, but the eyes especially, the kydneys &amp; bladder: Tables may be made of the same, of lyke propertyes, and vnto the same vses: or certayne droppes may be mynistred alone, at any time: or else taken morning, and euening. And an oyle is drawne, out of the drye séedes, without any other addicion, it is very pleasaunt and swéete of taste, as the Aucthour prooued and felt of the same: the same also in colour is whyte, that first distylleth.
               The oyle of Cummyne drawne, is profitable to woundes, ioyning néere vnto the Mylt, the swellings of the body procéeding of a colde cause, which sometymes happeneth and is the cause, why the vryne is stayed backe: vnto this vse may a droppe, or two, be mynistred in Ferne water, or in Tables, if they be made with it.
               The oyle out of Henbane séedes, prepared in the same maner, as the oyle of Roses, by the discription of Rogerius, auayleth the lyke, that the oyle of the apples of Mandrake doth. It auayleth also in the hote ioynt aches, in repressing mightily the payne, and causing an astonishment to those places applyed: in burning and in excoriations, it may procure and make a lyttle scarre, and mytigate

the burnings, out of the same Aucthour.
               The selfe same Aucthour, doth otherwyse prepare the oyle, which worketh stronger and to greater purpose in the abouesayd burning. Take on Mydsomer eue, the toppes, flowers &amp; leaues, with which let a new potte be fylled, hauing in the bottom a lytle

hole, and let the mouth of the vpper pot be dyligently stopped, which set into ye mouth of another pot standing vnder, the mouth of which lute round about with the other, that no ayre breath forth: this done, set the pots so deepe into the earth that they may wholy be couered and buried in the earth, after let them stande for a whole yeare in the grounde: at the ende of which tyme, drawe the pottes forth, and you shall finde in the neather potte a cleare oyle, which by the heate of the fumosities of the earth, is drawne forth from the Henbane. This maner of instruction is founde perfiter, in the discription of the oyle of yuie berries (where is otherwyse lefte in the earth for sixe monethes) with this are members labouring and sore payned with dayly fluxes falling to them, annoynted.
               A compounde oyle out of Séedes, procuring sléepe: Take of the Seedes of Lollij, of Henbane, of the whyte and blacke Poppie, of the Lettuce and Purcelane séedes, of eache fowre small handfulles, of the séedes of Faba inuersa, which is Telephium, two small handfulles: let all these be distylled togyther: of this distylled, mynister two scruples wayght at a tyme, with a lytle or small quantity of Opium.
               
            
            
               Of the oyles out of Fruytes. The .xiiij. Chapter.
               THe oyle of Iuniper berryes, is distylled in the same maner, as the Aqua vitae, by powring water vpon, and it then spéedilye and easilye distylleth. As an oyle fyrst commeth, and a

water next inseweth: euen in the lyke maner, as whē the Spike is distylled. But it behooueth to breake the berries before. Some also distyll them in a bodie: this auayleth vnto many grieffes, vnto the gripings of the belly, vnto the mattering of the yarde, which is as the same were the Gonorrhaea, vnto the paynes or grieffes of the necke, procéeding of Rewme. Agyrtae or Iuglers publishe marueylous matters of the same oyle, which who that lyste may reade theyr tables imprinted with them. But the maner howe this oyle ought to be distylled, is on this wyse: I tooke (sayth the Aucthour) a pynt full of Iunyper berryes, which I brake somewhat small, vpon which I powred pure water, such a quantitie as verie well couered them, after I powred the whole into such a copper vessell, as the same is, in which the Aqua vitae most commonly is distylled, and with a copper pype also passing through colde water, dyd I distyll, hauing vnder a bygge Receauer, fastened to the pype, which myght well receyue or holde fowre measures of lycour: and on this wyse, dyd the oyle distyll &amp; come, with the water. But another instrument I vsed standing on the head, which I fylled with colde water, for ye better cooling of the spyrites, that they burned not in the comming. Out of the abouesayde quantity of berryes, I neuer drew aboue three ounces of perfite oyle. There is a further instruction, for the drawing of this oyle, in the first part of distyllations.
               By pressing out also in this maner or on this wyse, we drawe &amp; get an oyle not euyll sauouring: take of Iuniper berryes broken, fyrst myxt with burning water, and after with oyle Olyue: let them boyle a lyttle, or at the least let these be infused togyther, often sturring them with a spattle, for eyght dayes, then powring them into a bodie, distyll in a Furnace after art, the oyle after swymmyng aboue, gather into another glasse: you may then put into it a lytle of Angelica, or some other thing a lyttle brused before.
               The Mandrake apples are cut into quarters, &amp; boyled in oyle, in a double vessel, in a colde coūtrey as afore of the oyle of Roses, out of Rogerius was taught, or you may otherwyse prepare the Oyle, by the heate of the Sunne. This Oyle auayleth the lyke in contynuall and burning Agues, which the Oyle of Roses

doth: but in that this oyle stupyfieth and mightier altereth, more then the oyle of Roses doth, it ought (for that cause) that the malyce or hurt be repressed, with womans mylke myxed, the same oyle also auayleth, in the hote aches, and gowte. This borrowed out of Rogerius.
               
               An oyle out of Bay berries, doth Rogerius instruct to make many wayes: take the gréene berries, those breake small, which after the sufficient boyling, straine through a cloath, &amp; kéepe the lycour in a glasse. Otherwyse, take a quantity of rype bay berries, &amp; those after the finely breaking, boyle with bay leaues after art, and the same strayned, kéepe dilygently in a glasse. Or after the baye berries be finely broken, &amp; infused for sixe or eyght dayes in wyne, and then put vp into bagges, &amp; an oyle drawne by a presse. Or the rype &amp; fresh berryes broken, which after the putting into bagges, an oyle pressed forth. This oyle (as wytnesseth Rogerius) auayleth against the Collick, the Ilyacke, and Sciaticke passion, or payne in the hyppe bone.
               An oyle out of yuie berryes, is gotten and made many wayes, especially by those wayes taught aboue, in the drawing an oyle out of bay berryes: this oyle purchased, auaileth against cold causes, especially against the cold ioynt aches. Wherefore I affirme (sayth Rogerius) that whatsoeuer consisteth in the yuie, auayleth against ache of the ioynts: whereof the oyle, that myghtier worketh, is on this wyse prepared and made: take of the drye wood, the berries, and gum of the yuie, if you can purchase altogyther, &amp; the wood small cutte, put into an earthen potte, being ful of hooles in the bottome, or at the least hauing three holes passing through in the bottome, which set into the mouth of another potte glased, the mouthes of which stoppe close, with potters clay or past: these two so ordered, set to deepe into the earth, that the vpper pot stand wholy aboue the earth, &amp; the mouth of the neather potte couered ouer with the earth: which done, make a fire about the vpper pot, and a blacke oyle wyll after distyll into the neather pot.
               A Rape oyle gotten, by pressing out: take a Rape, which after the making of a hollowe deepe hole in the roote, fyll that hollownesse vp with oyle Olyue, on which set the cappe or couer of the roote, afore cutte of, &amp; being thus close stopped on the head, wrap

the whole roote dilygently about with towe wette, which after bury in the hote ymbers with a few coales vpon: this done, let it there lye for halfe an howre: after which tyme drawe it forth, and taking of the cappe, preserue the oyle strayned, and the roote also strayned togyther through a lynnen cloath. This oyle auayleth against cleftes and choppes of the handes, caused of colde. This borrowed out of a written booke.
               Out of the Pyne aple kernelles (I sawe) an oyle drawne or gotten by discencion, which serueth for the wrincles of womens faces: this out of Manaraus.
               
               An oyle out of the Onyon and Triacle, prouoking sweate in the pestilence, take a bigge white Onyon, in the myddle of which make a déepe hole, filling the same with good Triacle, after the cappe set on and a wet lynnen cloth wrapped rounde about▪ put it vnder the hotte ymbers to rost for half an howre, which after ye distilling in a Limbecke, giue of this lycour, vnto the quantity of two ounces, to the paciēt. The same effect worketh; sixe ounces of the distylled lycour▪ of the greene Nuts. This out of Fumanellus.
               
               
            
            
               Of the oyles out of Spyces: but the oyle or water, to be gotten out of Cynamon, see and reade hereafter among the Barks. The .xv. Chapter.
               THis generall precept, ought to be obserued, in ye distillacion of all spyces in a maner: yt what spices soeuer you chose, bray thē first into fine powder, powring vpon a quātity of cunduite or spryng water, which after the same shall be coloured with the spyce, shyft into another glasse, into which powre other fresh spyces broken: &amp; so oftē do the same, vntyl ye water purchase no further colour, then distyl it in Balneo Mariae, &amp; seperate after the water from the oyle: this G. Rast. But the waters &amp; oyles, which are preapared &amp; gotten out of spyces, ought to be done by the infusion in simple water, &amp;

not in wyne, or Aqua vitae in that those doe hastily ascend, &amp; not carry the force of the spyces with them: but the water contrarywyse ascendeth not, without the spyce. And to be briefe, those are here to be applyed, which are afore taught, of the oyles out of séedes, in the begynning vttered to be done.
               The oyle out of Cloues, Nutmegs, Pepper, Mace, &amp; Cinamō, are made &amp; wrought through the spyces before broken, &amp; put into a Cucurbite wel luted, or into a copper body, with a head set close on: which you shall distyll by a pype retching through a vessell of colde water: for on such wyse cooled, wyll a water and oyle come, which after seperate, as the one from the other. For the oyle euermore swymmeth aboue the water, except the oyle of Cloues, which falleth to the bottome.
               An oyle out of Nutmegs, vnto the imitaciō of this general rule, which a certaine Empericke teacheth to be in a maner lyke prepared. Take a thyrd, or fowrth part of good Aqua vitae distylled, &amp; the Nutmegs finely broken, put altogither into a glasse body, filled with the Aqua vitae, three fingers aboue the Nutmegs, which let stand couered to infuse for .xxiiii. howres, &amp; that the Aqua vitae hath attayned a yellow colour, the same then shyft into another glasse: into which poure after fresh Aqua vitae, so much as before, &amp; the same so often repeate with fresh Aqua vitae, vntyl it wyl colour the Aqua vitae no more. Which done, powre all ye 
                  Aqua vitae thus colored into a glasse body, which after the setting into Balneo Mariae, distyll according to art, that the Aqua vitae may ascend, &amp; the oyle of Nutmegs remayne in the bottome of the body: and on such wyse, shal you attaine the oyle prepared. In the lyke maner, may an oyle be altogyther distylled, out of all other spyces.
               I saw, sayth one of Gesnerus friends, a distyllation of the oyle of Nutmegs, which was an oyle drawne most pleasant &amp; swéet, and of a great yéeld, by an Alchymist, after this maner. He tooke the Nutmegs &amp; brought thē to fine powder, on which he powred two measures of simple pure water, after he shyfted the whole into a glasse Cucurbite fensed about with yt lute of wysedome (this lute was made with simple clay, to which he mixed the shorne floxe of cloath tempred with salt water) euē as the Alchymists are woont to lute theyr bodies, for the purchasing of strong water: after the head set on, he lyke luted the ioynt of the head round about, &amp; the

ioynt of the receauer in the same maner, that no spirites shoulde breath forth. The body thus fenced he set into the Furnace, making vnder a soft fyre in the begynning, but next a bygger, &amp; last a strong fire: euen as they doe, which distyl the strong water: and drawne, it was for truth an oyle most excellent of sauour, swymming aboue the water come in the Receauer, which he dilygentlie gathered: for he affirmed the same to be of great vertue in sundry matters.
               The oyle of Mace, is of a hote quality, &amp; for that cause the vse of it is ryght profitable in the collicke passion, procéeding of a colde cause, and of the rewme distylling or descending from the head: it comforteth also the heart, the stomacke, &amp; matrice. But a most singular helpe in especiall, is felt of this oyle, in the tremblings of the heart proceeding of feare, or through the stopping of the bladder, or matrice, it auayleth besides in the strangurie, and helpeth all diseases proceeding of a colde matter. A thrée or fowre droppes may be ministred or taken by the mouth at a tyme, prepared with some other dayntye matter, or in an yron Ladle or great spoone ouer the fyre: or in a freshe draft of good wyne: this borrowed out of an vnknowne Aucthor, in the Germain tongue.
               An oyle out of Mace may be gotten, by pressing forth, in the same maner, as shall after be taught, in the fourme and way of preparing the oyle of Cloues.
               An oyle distylled out of Pepper, hauing all those propertyes, which the Pepper it self, sauing that the same burning which the Pepper procurrth on the tongue, is not the lyke fealt (by tast) in yt oyle. This oyle of the pepper is none other matter, then an ayriall element seperated frō the other elements: euen as the lyke wee proue in the distylled oyle of the vitryoll, &amp; brymstone. In the same maner, is the oyle of pepper throughly seperated from his burning, &amp; consisteth or hath greater properties then the Pepper it selfe, &amp; hath the singular propertie of piersing. In the Collicke passion, and partes stuffed with much soft &amp; clammy flewme, let two or three droppes of it be ministred or taken with broth, vnto the cutting a sunder, and breaking away of it. I gaue (sayth a certayne Practisioner) in the Tertiane ague, after a purgation, &amp; the bleeding by vaine done, thrée droppes of this oyle, with one

scruple of Mina, two howres before the sytte began: and it letted within once or twyse taking▪ yea and maystred the cold, the shaking, &amp; the Ague it selfe, to the wonder of the pacient. And he further affyrmeth of it, that if this auayleth not in the first giuing, it wholy cureth in the second tyme.
               An oyle of Cloues is lyke prepared &amp; gotten as the oyle of Iuniper berries, and not as the oyle of Cinamon. This oyle is farre sooner and easier purchased, if the same distyllatinn be done with waters, as oyther 
                     •
                  ayne, or ponde waters, or other more dayntie waters. The Cloues besydes haue a farre more moysture contained in them, then hath the Cinamon. There be some (yea many) which doe lyke prepare and get an oyle of Cloues, by onely pressing forth.
               Take of Cloues what quantity you wyl, those beate in a grosse maner, which after stiepe in Rosewater so long, vntil you thinke it hath throughly purchased the qualities &amp; effectes of the Cloues. Then take a quantity of good Almondes, cleane &amp; whyte scraped with a knyfe, those lightly cutte into pieces, which after infuse in the sayde water, that they may throughly drinck in of the sauour and taste of the Cloues, those then lay a sunder to drie: which dryed, infuse againe in the sayd water, and those drye againe, &amp; this doe for fowre tymes togyther. After put into bagges, presse an oyle forth, which set in the Sun to purify for a tyme. And in this maner also may many profitable oyles be prepared &amp; gotten, as an oyle out of Muske, Amber, and Beniamine, Storax, Cynamon &amp; Mace. This borrowed out of a written booke, of the Aucthours.
               An oyle of Cloues, that is as the Cloues it selfe, being hote and drye, in the thyrde degrée, which helpeth the stomack, the Lyuer, the heart, the humorall fluxe of a cold cause, &amp; all cold diseases of the stomacke. The Cloues put away Melancholie spirites, and cleare the grosse: but the oyle doth these farre excellenter, and as I may soothly affirme (sayth the Aucthour) it hath all the vertues of a Baulme. For this doth heale outwardly freshe and gréene wounds. It stateth, the yssewing of blood &amp; water, out of wounds. It comforteth within the naturall partes, it purgeth Melancholy blood, it comforteth the heart &amp; head, and doth especially helpe, the gyddynesse of the head, and weaknesse of sight: if in the morning

thrée or fowre drops of it be taken fasting in a spoone, with some pleasaunt syrupe, or other daynty thing, or in wyne.
               Of the oyle of Cloues, wryteth another: who thus sayth, this I dare affyrme, that it hath the vertues of baulme: I saw (sayth he) a wound closed and healed by it, without stitching, by one Ioachimus Rhoeticus. And as touching the other worthie effects of this oyle, I (by sylence ouer passe) which this doth in strengthning, &amp; in restoring especially decayed strength. The oyle of Cloues druncke, to the quantity of two or thrée droppes, in the broath, or 
                     •
                  ulleys of a Capon, doth then auaile in the Collick, &amp; suffocations of the wombe. Tables or losings prepared and made of the oyle of Cloues, and eating of them morning, &amp; euening, doe strengththen the head, and staye rewmes.

And in the same maner rectyfy oyles drawne out of wooddes, the séedes, and Baulme. Lullius distylleth an oyle out of a gumme, or gummie matter, being before well brayed, and infused for a daye, in sowre verguice, or sharpe vineger.
               
               An oyle out of Masticke, is gotten by descentiō, in a Retorte: in such manner ordred, that ye fyre be made both aboue, and vnder it, and you shall so purchase an oyle of Mastick, which after may be rectifyed, as aboue taught. A certayne Practisioner in ye worthy Citie of Auguste, distylleth it on this wyse: in taking whole Masticke, and it alone putteth into a Retorte luted, vnto that parte shewing and lying without the Furnace, which hath fowre vente holes, and couered aboue: this with a softe fyre distyll: for that which commeth, is a marueylous Baulme vnto woundes. Note, I haue distylled (sayth a certaine person, forgotten of the Aucthour) Masticke by a pype, but the same woulde yéelde no more, then a sauour or taste. Yet was that Masticke, neuerthelesse lyght and

                  The water also which remained in the bottome of the Cucurbite, was of a yelowishe colour, &amp; bitterishe. And to conclude, the Masticke in the boyling (then by a Limbecke) looseth a vertue, powred into the same matter, in which it is boyled. Séeyng ye essence of it, yéeldeth a greater vertue by a Lymbecke.
               A confection of the oyle out of Frankensence, and Carabe, peraduenture also out of Assa dulcis, Caphora, styrax calaminta, &amp;c. Take first a body very well luted, but of small length, &amp; the necke somewhat broken of or cut away with a bigge wyer redde hotte, that the mouth of the glasse may be the wyder (for into the mouth of it must another glasse be thrust) into which powre your fyne pouder of Frankensence, or of Carabe, vnto the waight of halfe a pounde. After this, prepare another white glasse of Christall, hauing a broade mouth like to our pewter quarte potte, into which you may powre the hotte water, and into this set the first Cucurbyte, in such order, that the same may stand vpright in the myddle of it. Then close the Cucurbite about his ende, beyng bored in the toppe, into which hole set an apte Tunnel, that may haue a tappe somewhat higher than the hole whose narrower part, &amp; end, may regard or leane toward the glasse with ye hotte water, which thus prepared &amp; done, powre the whote water into the Tunnel, and by opening or plucking forth the tappe, the hote water may not then distyll downe▪ by droppes softlie, into the vessell standing vnder: &amp; on such wyse gouerne your water, that ye glasse be not drowned, for through this with the helpe togither of the vapour of the hote water, a most sweet &amp; pleasant oyle ascendeth into the Lymbeck, bearing with it, or hauing the very sauour of the Frankensence, which without ye working with this vapor, doth most filthily smel.

               An oyle of Myrre, that mayntaineth the person long youthfull,

euen as the naturall baulme doth: for this oyle by his naturall vertue defendeth &amp; preserueth all things from putrifying, which are layd into it: and this also annointed on the face, mayntaineth a freshe &amp; comely face, and that long youthful appearing. This besides healeth woundes marueylous soone, and cureth all inwarde grieffes, or at the least, a marueylous nūber of diseases, in giuing vnto the quantity of two drams at a tyme by the mouth. This helpeth the defnesse of the eares, by powring certaine drops into them: and mightily auayleth against all maner of aches, proceeding of a cold cause: it preserueth the sight, by being distylled into the eyes, and especially one drop at a tyme: and marueylous singular for women payned with the griefe &amp; disease of the matrice: and it stayeth the sheding of heyre, by anoynting the places with it: and annoynting all the parts of the body of him which hath a grieuous Ague, and procuring him to sweate, shall speedily be cured of his ague: and many other sicknesses, doth this precious oyle cure, if those be wrought after knowledge. The making of which singuler oyle is on this wyse: take of chosen Myrre, that in no maner is falsyfied, sixe ounces, of pure Aqua vitae which hath no flewme in it twelue ounces, these after the myxing togyther in a glasse body, set into hote horse doong to digest, for sixe dayes. After the taking forth, distyl the substance in Balneo with an easie fyre at the first, vntyll all the Aqua vitae be distylled and come forth: for then wyll the oyle carry behinde in the bottome of the bodye, which strayne through a fyne lynnen cloath, the same dilygently kéepe in a glasse to your vse. And when any person wyll annoynt of it on the face, to make it seeme at one staye, and comelynesse, a long tyme: let him or hir make a decoction of Nettles in common water, and whyles the same boyleth, let the partie holde ouer his face, that it may by the same meanes strongly sweate, after in drying the face verye well, annoynt forthwith the face all about with the oyle: and the lyke maner may be obserued and vsed, in annoynting the breast, the handes, &amp; other partes of the creature, in preseruing that those appeare not wrincled, and yll fauoured: as commonly they doe in olde age. This borrowed out of the worthy Gréeke, Leonarde Fiorauant.
               
               This precious oyle of Myrre, is otherwyse prepared and made

by a certayne practisioner, helping the aches and paynes of the Gowte, &amp; seruing vnto many other maters afore vttered. Take of new layd egges ten in number, which after the hard seething, cutte into iust halfes: the yolkes taken forth, fyll those hollowe places with so much fyne powder of Myrre in eache, as wyll well contayne the half of the yolke. Which done, close the two halfes of the whites of the egges togyther, &amp; putting or laying them in a glasen vessel, set after into a deepe seller, which let there remaine for fifteene dayes, or longer, and a lycour wyll then yssew forth, which keepe dilygently to your vse.

Take one pound of Beniamine, of Leuanute, or the East Musk one dram, of most pure &amp; fine Aqua vitae ten ounces, of the Ryuer sand wel washed &amp; dried before, fowre oūces, all these after the myxing togither, put into a Retort of glasse, of such a bygnesse, that the same may remayne three fowrth partes emptie, after the substaunce put in, which then distyl in Balneo, vntyl all the substaunce be come: and when no more wyll distyll forth, draw away your Receauer, &amp; seperate the water from the oyle, keeping eache a part by it selfe: for you shall then inioye a water ryght pleasant, and oyle of Beniamine myraculous.

And in the end of ye distyllatiō, when certayn fumes come into the retort which sauor, draw away the receauer, putting vnder another, for the odoriferous oyle otherwyse would be spylt &amp; lost: after seperate the oyle from the Aqua vitae, which keepe in a glasse.

In this, it

behooueth to vse your owne discretion in permitting it to boyle, eyther a longer or shorter tyme, according to the quantitie of the substance, put into the body. And before you draw the oyle forth, let it throughly coole in the body, which after kéepe in a glasse to your vse.

This also is profitable in the gathering of matter in the bulke of the stomacke, and in all maner of paynfull griefe in the breast, procéeding of flewme: the Collicke passions also, &amp; all grieffes that commeth of wynde: it correcteth besydes, and bringeth to fayre passe, the scarres of wounds. Very fayre is the oyle of Turpentyne, and hath few Feces or grounds in the bottome of the body, after the distyllacion, for it is in a maner all oyle of it selfe, and the greatest part of it, is by distillacion gotten or drawne into oyle. For an oyle is purchased out of it, eyther by force of an extreame colde laboured, or of an extreame hotenesse done: euen as out of all matters in a maner, this may be drawne.
               Also this distylled oyle of Turpentyne, healeth scabbes, and the choppes of them: the brayne it heateth &amp; comforteth, by putting vp a feather into the nosethrelles dypped in it, and draweth forth flewme without snysings: this healeth besydes, the chops of womens breastes. For the recouering of memory, defnesse, and the crampe, this obtayneth principalitie. That woundes may speedily bee healed, take the oyle of Turpentyne, and heated by the fyre, myxe with it an equall part of Viridis aeris, which after keepe to vse. This learned out of the written booke, of a notable Empericke.

And let your Receauer be of a sufficient bygnesse, and strong, for if it shall otherwyse bée ouer small, then through the vehemencie of the spyrites, it wyll lyghtlie breake. In the begynning procéede with a softe fyre, and with the same fyre perseuere or continew so long, vntyll all the moysture of the Sage shall be distilled &amp; come, for after the same, there is no daunger in the force of the fyre. But whyles the dystyllacion is in doing, the neck of the Retort wyll be vehemently hote: when as in it shall no other be contayned or remaine, then the excrementes of the Sage, and the remnaunt or Feces of the Turpētine, which are none other, than that named Colophonia▪
                  
                  
the necke shall then be cooled, although it may appeare very hote, in that no more doth after ascende, which may heate the necke. Yet that the whole distyllacion may be performed and done by a easier way, and with lesser danger, and that the fyre also may by a better meanes be gouerned according to the necessitie and wyl

of the workeman. For that cause are here two furnaces placed, standing one by the other, of which the one serueth for the fyre, &amp; the other is for the Retort▪ this (for the Retort) receyueth the fyrie heate, by an apte hole framed vnto it, placed in the myddle betwéene both, which may one whyles shutte, and another whyles open, according to the necessitie of the worke, through the helpe of a certayne plate or wyndowe of yron, hydde betwéene both the Furnaces.
               And when any matter is in the distylling, both the Furnaces in the meane time ought to be closed and shutte in all places, except certayne vent holes in both the Furnaces, that the fume may so passe by them. And that these Furnaces, may appeare playner to vnderstanding, conceyue this figure, here aboue discrybed. With this oyle (purchased by the meanes aboue taught) the payned members ought moderatelie to be annoynted.
               An oyle by distillacion of the shyppe pytch, annointed on places, doth auayle vnto the extenuation of resolued &amp; weake members, yet doth it not lyke resolue, as the pytche lying a long tyme togyther. An oyle out of the whyte pytche, by distyllacion may be gotten, ryght precious: this borrowed out of an Empericke, vnknowne to the Aucthour.
            
            
               
               Of the oyles gotten out of Barkes. The .xviij. Chapter.
               A Water or oyle of Cynamon, is to be requyred and coueted before other waters, and Oyles: as the Cynamon it selfe in respect to other spyces. And the Cynamon is of a subtyll heate, through which it especially auayleth in the wynter, in that it strengthneth then more the stomacke, and marueylously putteth away all euyll and corrupt moystures of the stomacke, and defendeth it from corrupting at all: it also sharpeneth the sight, and openeth any maner stopping of the veynes and marueylously comforteth the heart. But an oyle distylled of it, doth answere in generall to a naturall baulme, which within helpeth all putrifaction, and without the body cureth all freshe woundes or vlcers. And the distylled water mightily auayleth in all colde diseases, as well of men, as women, especially which haue a stomacke so affected, that they haue no appetyte. When the spirites also bée weakned, or the pacient weake, a draft of this water, with a litle of good Malmesie, o
                     •
                   of the iuyce of the Pomegranate, taken by the mouth, woonderfully auayleth and helpeth. Men in a maner dead, by dropping or powring a droppe or two into the mouth, doth recouer the person in a swoone or traunce: especially which to olde men many tymes hapneth, this is the presentest remedy. Mydwiues and other motherlye women with vs, carry of this water with them, and vse of the same with prosperous successe, to yong women in the daungerous traueyle of chylde. For doth in the hastening, and helping forward of the byrth, it is the worthyest remedy. The sundry maners, that a water and oyle may be distylled &amp; gotten out of the Cynamon, shal by a few examples here be vttered. Some there be which stiepe the Cinamon before in Rosewater, others in whyte wyne▪ many drawe it in a Cucurbyte luted about, but then is the substaunce lightly burned. If the same be distylled in a bladder (which the Apotetaryes vse) it can not then be done without the great quantity of Cynamon. The best maner and waye of drawing these, is in the vapour of boyling water: but as touching the rehersall of these, is here sufficient.
               
                  The Poticaries (certaine yeares past) were woont, to stiepe the Cynamon for certayne dayes, in Rosewater, as that which regarded the heart, and was alwayes applyed for the recouerie of strength: and for that a lyttle quantity of the water, hath not his smell, the water is estéemed of the lesser value with many. And for that cause better it is, that the Cynamō be stieped before the distyllation, in olde pleasaunt whyte wyne, for a certayne tyme: For on such wyse prepared, the distylled water is caused the excellenter, and in piercing more effectuous.
               The maner of preparing a water out of Cynamon, which Gesnerus receiued of a certaine friend of his, that made great tryals, and often distylled the same. Let one pound of chosen Cynamon be gotten, which beat so fyne, that the powder may passe through a fine sieue, yet the whole you may not worke to powder: after put al into a Cucurbite, on which powre of the water of Borrage of Buglosse, of Endiue, and of baulme, of each halfe a pynt, these let stand to infuse in a glasse close stopped, for fowre or fiue daies. After out of this Cucurbite or glasse body, let the whole be shyfted into a copper body, which you shall place in a Furnace with his head set vpon, &amp; cooling beake fastened to after art: and beware that the body stand not ouer nigh the fyre, but that an yron plate full of holes, be fyxed in the myddle betweene, that the fyre may so vent through, and the vapour be sent vpwarde▪ Fyrst kyndle or beginne with a soft fyre, vntyll the distyllacion be somewhat come, but increase after the fyre bygger and bygger, that it may the spéedilyer distyll forth. When a measure is come or dystilled forth, seperate yt a part, as principal, setting vnder another Receauer, for ye same which next distylleth &amp; is gathered, is much inferiour to the first, and may serue for new Cinamon, to be styeped in the same. And in the same maner, may a water be distilled out of Cloues. Where to be noted, that a maner and way of cooling be vsed: as when the water beginneth to waxe hote; to draw forth the same, and powre in colder water.
               A water of Cinamō, if any wyl distyl by a bladder made of copper, togyther with a pype fyxed to it, passing through a vessell of cold water: a great quantity then shal be distylled togyther, for it would not easily be drawne in a small quantity. But in a Cucurbite

dilygently luted, this speciall care is to be had, that your stuffe burne not to the bottome, whereby your water then distylling forth may sauour of the burning. That if the fyre shall be hoter increased, an oyle also distylleth, and so much the more, if the Cynamon shall be stieped in good whyte wyne. A water distylled in a Cucurbite, is gathered whyte in the receauer.
               I doe take (sayth the Aucthour)

                   quantity of Cynamon, euen so much as I thinck good, and put the same into a Cucurbite or glasse body not luted, togyther with water, to stiepe for certayne dayes, after I distyll the substaunce by the vapour of boyling water, in such sort that the Cucurbite in which the Cynamon is contayned, doth not touch the water, as the lyke Manardus teacheth: and on such wyse I distylled and gathered a cleare water, not troubled, nor the spirites also of the Cynamon heated to much. Sometymes when I would haue the water myghtyer, I then adde to it a lytle of Gynger. And in this maner, a certaine Poticarie (with the Aucthour) distylleth the water of Cynamon.
               Certayne others there be, which follow &amp; vse this maner: take of water sixteene partes, of Cynamon one parte, which grosely was powdred togyther, the same after put into a Cucurbite to stiepe close stopped, for a certayne tyme, as eyther fowre, or fiue dayes: after this set on the head close to the body, and distyll the substaunce with a most temperate heate in Balneo Mariae, which excéedeth not the heate of mans vryne in the fyrst cōming forth, for so may a most pleasaunt water be drawne and purchased. In the tyme of this boyling, may hote water be powred in, that a lyke quantity continew styll, for doubte of wasting awaye, and you shall gather into a Receauer the distinct waters: as the fyrst a mightie water, the second of lesser strength, and the thyrd feble. And in the lyke maner may all other spyces be ordered and dystilled: and many distyllers there be, which purchase by the same doing, an oyle and water.
               Another maner brieflie, in purchasing the water of Cynamon: take of chosen Cynamon two ounces, of water, a fowrth part of a measure, of wyne so much, these after the myxing, distyll, as afore taught.
               Others prepare a water of Cynamon, after this mamer:

                  
they take of Cynamon, one pounde grosely beaten, on which they powre a Sextarie and a halfe, that is (about a wyne quarte) of pure water, which close couered, they let stand to infuse, for .xviii. howres, after they set the body on a soft fyre, &amp; distylled the water, euen as wée doe Aqua vitae, by a pype passing thorowe a woodden vessell or tubbe fylled with colde water, which crooketh or wryeth in an out (after the fygure here playner dyscribeth) least the spyrites should burne. This fourme also may serue all those distyllacions, which ought to be done, by cooling meanes, thorow a vessell of colde water.
               A certayne woman well practised, and skylfull in distyllation, prepared and drewe Cynamon water, on this wyse: but it lyttle dyffereth, from the wayes afore vttered: take of the best Cynamon fynelye brought to powder in a morter, but not searsed, halfe a pounde, this so charilye powre into the distyllatorye bodie, that none cleaue on the sydes falling in, on which powre one measure and a halfe of cleare Cundui
                     •
                  te water, then set the headde close to the bodye: after distyll in the begynning with a verye softe fyre, and increase the fyre by lyttle and lyttle, as you see the droppes come, eyther quicke, or slowly: to the Nose of the Lymbecke or headde, let a Pype bee fastened (as afore taught, and demonstrated) passing or retching through colde water, at the ende of which a Receauer fastened.
               
                  When the water thus commeth, you shall néede thrée persons to stand by, the one and first to consider &amp; tende the head, and pype, that he or shee alwayes cooleth them, with lynnen cloathes wette in colde water &amp; applied after discretion on the head and pype, the other standing by the Receauer, let him obserue and marke the colour of the water distylling into the receauer: the thyrde, that he marke and tende the glasse in such maner, as when neede shall be, to retche or put vnder speedily another Receauer, &amp; to take the other againe, &amp; stop dilygently. The water distilling hath fowre differences, for which cause it shal neede fowre sundry receiuers. The first water that cōmeth, is somewhat fattie and strong, and of this, is the best: and as this proceedeth in distylling, &amp; a mylkie colour beginneth to come, then gather the second water, which in his fortitude lacketh of the first, or is of a weaker vertue: &amp; when this colour is vanished, &amp; that the water comming forth, as a water distylled out of other matters, remember &amp; consider the thirde water, which must lyke be gathered a part or seuerall by it selfe. When this water shalbe turned into a yellowe colour, or chaunged yellowishe, gather then the fowrth water, which distylleth or commeth forth in a small quantity: and the worke is at an ende, when certayne droppes begynne to appeare of a redde colour, at which sight ceasse, for the rest behynd is of no force, nor serueth to any vse or purpose. Besides take héede, least through the force of the fyre your substance ouer high boyleth vp, &amp; through the same may the distyllacion procéede amysse, &amp; in daunger of losing the whole stuffe. Of which to be out of doubt, you shall auoyde &amp; end that care (by good gouernment) in the space of one howre.
               Thrée droppes of this water, myxed to other waters of lyke propertie aunswering, doe helpe the falling sicknesse. If with this, the veynes vnder the tongue be aptlie rubbed, doth helpe the palsie persons in a short tyme.
               Out of the Cynamon may by distyllacion, but a lyttle oyle be gotten, for which cause in the steede of it, we may often vse the water of Cynamon, especially the same which is first gathered, for this hath singular properties contayned in it.
               An oyle of Cynamon, is prepared &amp; gotten on this wyse, borrowed out of a certaine written coppie, of an vnknowne Aucthor:

take of the best Malmesie thrée measures, and the same distylled twyse ouer. After let it be a thyrd tyme, that one measure onelye resteth in the Cucurbite. Let it be distylled once agayne, that a lesser quantity may remaine in the Cucurbite. Then let it be yet once agayne distylled, that one measure onely remayneth: by so often repiticion shal you haue the wyne very wel rectifyed, which kéepe to your vse. The same done, take of Cynamon what quantity you thinke necessary, the same breake smally, after powre the Cynamon with the rectifyed wyne into a Cucurbite, that it may be two fingers aboue the Cinamon. Let the Cucurbite then be dilygently closed with a blynd Lymbecke, and setting it into Balneo Mariae, make a soft fyre vnder for thrée dayes. Which time ended, powre yt wyne warely forth, in regarding that none of the Feces or grosser substaunce be powred forth withall, &amp; the wyne kéepe a part. Then powre other rectifyed wyne vpon, and worke as you did with the other before. These done, mixe eyther Aqua vitae or both togyther, in a Cucurbite, which dilygently couer with a head, and begyn to distyll with a very soft fyre, and so slow, that nynes stroks or knockes with the finger, may be made betwéene drop and drop falling: and on this wyse you shall continew, vnto the tyme that all the wyne be ascended: for in the bottome then of the glasse, you shall haue an oyle, which dilygently kéepe.
            
            
               The maner of preparing and drawing a water of Cynamon, and an oyle of the same: which a most singular Phisition named Maister Iohn Crato a Krafftheim, gently opened and taught to the Aucthour. The .xjx. Chapter.

this maner for a certaine space, in that or ouer that hote vapour, vntyll the Cynamon hath sufficiently drawne and gathered to it of moysture. After the Cynamon thus prepared and moystned with the vapour of the boyling water, let it be agayne beaten ouer, and as it were, a certayne paste made thereof, and the same togyther with the impressed lycour, which it before gathered and receyued, let be put into a Lymbecke: if néede shall requyre, you may yet powre in some more hote water, but ye lesser water you powre in or occupye, so much the worthier water of Cinamon you shall possesse, and somwhat also of the Oyle. But if you couet to haue a more store of water, and lesse precious, then powre in the more water, as certayne (at this daye) doe, to purchase them rather a more gayne, then mennes commoditye and health: but ordering it thus, you shall then obtayne, eyther none, or very lytle of the Oyle.

That if the same lyke can not be gotten or wrought, in putting a stycke ouerthwart the head of the potte, it may to the stycke be tyed and hang. And the couer stoppe dilygently about▪ that no ayre breath forth.

In the same maner, as the water of Cynamon is prepared and drawne; may also the Annise, the Fennell, the Cummyne, &amp;c. be distylled and gotten.

And vnto vse, must not the ponde, but ryuer water be taken.
               Againe the oyle of Cynamon, certaine doe affyrme, that the same to be prepared and made of some, with Aqua vitae: and that it ought to be applied to them that are encombred with the falling sicknesse, by gyuing of the oyle for three monethes, as daylye a droppe with Maiorome water, or some other lyke.
               An oyle out of the ryndes of the Orrendges dryed, is made most singular: but whether the same ought only be done in the Sun, or by distyllacion properly, as yet is not knowne to the Aucthour. But this the Aucthour learned and knew, that the Oyle is whytishe and sweete smelling, and hath very lytle sowrenesse, or in a maner nothing at all, that the Aucthour could taste or féele.
               An oyle out of the ryndes of Nuttes: take the drye rynders of Nuttes, which after the beating in a morter, put into a Retorte very well luted about, the same set ouer a fyre not ouer bygge, &amp; you shall then drawe forth an Oyle and water out of the ryndes. After shall you seperate the oyle, from the water, by Balneo Mariae. And last, you shal purge the oyle, by distylling of it in a smal glasse in Sande, three or fowre tymes ouer. This is in a maner better, then the oyle of Vitryoll, especially in the pestilence, and in poyson, G. Ras.

               AN oyle of Tartare is on this wyse drawne &amp; made: take of the Tartare of the whyte wyne, or Malmesse, if you can get the same (for it shall be ye better) as much as you think good, the same calcyne in a glasse Furnaces: vntyl it be so white as Meale: which done, prepare &amp; get a marble stone into moyst place, this so order, that it may seeme to hang, on which lay your Tartare calcyned, that wyl of it selfe dyssolue &amp; conuert into oyle, within sixe or eyght dayes, which gather and let runne through a strayner or

ypocrasse bagge, into a vessell or panne set right vnder, &amp; this wyl be whyte of colour, which keepe in a glasse close stopped. This is the true oyle of Tartare, but the same is most strong &amp; corrosiue: when any womā wyll vse of this to bewtifye the face, let hir then myxe a litle of it with some other water proper to the face, with which wash morning &amp; euening the face, for it corrodeth &amp; clenseth all maner spots of yt face, cleareth &amp; whyteneth the face, and taketh awaye the rednesse of the same. This oyle cleareth the hands, of any fowle spots: it mundifieth matrie &amp; fowle vlcers, by washing them sundry tymes with it. This also helpeth the euyl dispositions of the stomak▪ by taking one scruple of it, with two ounces of rosed Hony, and thrée ounces of Rosewater by the mouth, in the morning fasting. This besides serueth for fixation, in Alchimye matters. This borrowod out of the Italian secretes, of that singular Gabriell Fallopio.
               
               Another oyle of Tartare, borrowed out of the same Aucthour: take of Tartare, cleauing to the sydes of the vessels, especially of the whyte wyne, which beaten before, calcyne in an earthen pan,

after the calcynation, beate againe, which being put into an ypocrasse bagge, hang in a colde &amp; moyst seller, setting vnder a deepe glased panne: the same let there hang for sixe, or eight dayes, vntyll you see the oyle come. This oyle thus purchased, helpeth all maner of spottes of the face, maketh a cleare, &amp; smooth skynne: it healeth the fowle scruffe, scabbes, &amp; ryngwoormes, the rednesse of the face, through a saltmatter, and such lyke.
               An oyle of Tartare▪ that auayleth against the pushes, or lyttle wheales of the eyes, proceeding of the Leprie. Take of Tartare beaten, three poundes, this put into a glased potte with twentye ounces of vineger, boyle for halfe an howres space, which in the meane tyme dilygently skym, after take the pot from the fyre, in stopping it dilygently, that no vapour breath forth. Then set the potte againe an whote ymbers or hote coales, which let there so long boyle, or calcyne, vntyll the Tartare may be brought into powder againe. The same after the cooling, or being colde, bring to powder, which the powre into a Sugar strayner, or ypocrasse bagge, and hang it in a cold and moyst place, or wyne seller, some glased panne set vnder. The vse of this oyle, is on this wyse: let the pacient before enter into bathe, &amp; at night when he goeth to bedde, annoynt the places vnder the eyes, where the wheales or bladders appeare, &amp; couer them dilygently with a lynnen cloath, that they may not be touched of the ayre before the drying vp of it. This continew in lyke order, morning and euening, for eyght dayes togyther.
               For to calcine the Tartare on a sodaine, that with nyter it may be whyte, which auayleth aygainst wartes: out of a writtē Germaine booke. Take of salt peter &amp; Tartare brought to powder, of each a lyke quantity. After heate an oarthen pan not glased, into which powre the nyter and Tartare, &amp; when they make a

This Tartare thus calcyned, after the lying in a bagge, you shall hang in a moyst Seller, and an Oyle wyll dystyll forth into the panne standing vnder. This oyle thus gathered, doth remoue &amp; put away the wartes on the handes, and other parts, if with it they be annointed. Here is to be noted, that when you shall myxe lesser togither of nyter, then of the Tartare, the substance after the calcynation, wyll not be so whyte: although fowre ounces of salt

peter, with one pound of Tartare, myxed togyther, may calcyne the Tartare, but not reduce it into a whytenesse, but that the same wyll after remayne blacke, out of which an oyle notwithstanding is woont also to be distylled.

But if you wyll, that it should be mightyer wrought, and that the same may be worthier, distyl then the substance by a Retort, and your oyle shal after be very fayre, and piercing, and sone entering, where so euer it is applyed.
               An oyle out of the wood Guaicum, or (that better succéeded) out of the Polly wood (sayth Manardus) I vsed in the French grieffes or vlcers, or in Aches: vnto which vse, doth the oyle also out of the Iuniper woodde, not a lytle auayle.
               An oyle out of the wood of the Ashe trée, is prepared &amp; made in the same maner, as out of the Guaicum: the vse of it serueth, in a colde ache of the ioyntes, and bringeth to a scarre the excoriatiōs: it doth properly dissolue and put away the whyte morphew, and maketh it appeare blacke. And in the lyke maner, may an oyle be gotten, out of all wooddes: this Rogerius. Such an oyle besydes, cureth the palsie persons. Manardus also reporteth, that the oyle of the Ashe wood, not onely annoynted, but druncke also, to helpe the persons diseased with the Splene or Mylt.
               An oyle out of the yuie woodde, howe the same may be prepared &amp; gotten, was afore taught in the place, where wee instructed

the maner of drawing an oyle, out of the Iunyper berryes, borrowed out of Rogerius.
               
               An oyle out of the Iunyper woodde, is obtayned in the same maner, as the oyle out of the yuie woodde, that remooueth or represseth the causes of coldnesse, and the type or fygure of the quartayne: but more singuler and especiall it is, by annoynting from the nauell, vnto the pryuie place: for it auayleth and hath the propertie, to comfort the kydneys, and matrice, and to drye vp the moysture of it, and to prepare also the partie meete vnto conception: this Rogerius.
               
               The Oyle of Iuniper, doth auayle in Fistulaes, in cuttes of the skyn, in that named, Malum mortuum: the Serpigo &amp; Canker of the Legges, in wounds &amp; euyll vlcers. Take of the small chyppes of the Iuniper wood, a sufficient quantitie, which put into a bigg

                   glased pot or great pytcher glased within, &amp; fylling the pot full, whose mouth ought to be narrowe: after make a deepe hole in the earth, and prepare the walles of it with potters earth, after set the other potte glased within to the bottome of the hole, and vpryght standing, hauing a large mouth, and couered with a plate stricken full of small holes, after sence and stoppe the mouthes of these two pottes, set one within the other, with potters earth, that no ayre breath forth of neyther potte, which couered close about with earth, kyndle, and maintayne the fyre cleare for thrée howres, vntyll ye shall haue yéelded the best oyle of the Iunyper woodde, into the lesser and shorter vessell standing vnder.
               An oyle of the Iunyper woodde rectified, is wrought in the first distyllation by discention: after the whole powred into a glasse bodie, distylled ouer agayne, and that vpward, in Balneo Mariae, which although it be the slower waye, yet is it the comelyer maner, and causeth a bewtyfuller oyle, then eyther in Sand or ashes, in that it causeth the oyle readyer in them.
               An oyle out of the small chyppes or pieces of the woodde which the Germaines name Hobelspon, prepared and drawne on this wyse, helpeth sundrie grieffes of the eyes: take of the good mother of Pearles, which laye for a nyght, eyther in a wyne Seller, or into colde water, after let it be throughly dryed: which done, to this mother of pearles, put in so many chyppes of the

wood as the potte wyll well receyue, the same drawe with a fire by descention, or by (a shorter way) kyndle the chyppes, &amp; an oyle wyll come, of a yellow colour for the eyes.

               AN oyle out of Paper is thus purchased, take a pewter dyshe, in which put so much paper as you mynde to burne: after the paper burnt, you shall finde a yelowishe some running out of the dyshe, the same gather, and annoynt the wryncled or folded eye lyddes: or otherwyse vse for the spottes, the whitneses, and other grieffes of the eyes.
               An oyle otherwise purchased out of paper, make a long hoode rolled togither of whyte paper, the very top of which cutte of: and the sharpe ende folded many tymes about, holde with a payre of sheeres or long nyppers, on such wise that the broder edge &amp; ende hang or be within the dyshe, vntyll the halfe, or greater part be burnte, yet suffer not the flame to fall into the dyshe, vnto the ende of the worke.
               An oyle out of lynnen pieces, take a fine lynnen cloath cleane washed, the same kindle or burne ouer a pewter dysh, &amp; a canstick oyle wyll come, with which annoynt vlcers: after dissolue chalke in vyneger, into the maner of a whyte oyntment, with which annoynt rounde about, as a defensiue to the place.
               
            
            
               Of the oyles out of Beastes, or their partes, togyther with an Epistle of Arnoldus de villa noua, of mans blood distylled. The .xxiij. Chapter.
               MY dearelye beloued friende Maister lacobus, of late you required of mée, that I would open to you my secrete of mannes blood, which the dyuine power fauouring and helping mée, and by my owne industry (although not wholy) and by many experiences, with the manifold labors bestowed, I haue founde some

worthy practises, of which I haue tried, and those by my letters, I mind to vtter to you. And although I haue béen a long time occupyed about the same, yet for that I now waxe aged, &amp; set rancour or enuie aside, for that cause, will I fully open to you, what I many times, haue experienced, by this worthy secrete. Therfore giue eare, and heare the chosen secretes, and wordes of my mouth in that the holy Ghost, where (it him best liketh) breatheth his diuine gifte▪ and of this, let it be recluded in the pitte of a penitent breast, if any will make common, or reueile this secret, to either a foolishe, or negligent person, which the auncient in times past, so carefully and busily sought, and yet could not attaine the same yea they many wayes practised, and yet could not retche to, nor purchase the same high secret. For it is celestiall gift, reuealed to vs vnworthy of God, which neither ye Phisitions before knew, nor the Philosophers also which laboured in the déepe secretes of Alchymie, found. But I take God to witnesse, that by sundry traueiles, which a I long time haue bestowed (as you know) in the secrete Art of Alchymie, haue nowe brought to passe, that I haue knowen by experience, such an efficacie to be of this matter, that ye full to vtter of the singuler vertues of it, my wittes will not extend, &amp; for that cause I reclude thē, in the pit of a penitent breast.
               To come to the matter, conceaue this secrete, yt is, mans blood, and let the blood be of healthfull men, about xxx. yéeres of age, out of which draw according to Art, the fowre Elements, as you wel haue learned and know by the rules of Alchymie, and diligently stoppe eche Element a part, that no ayre breath forth.
               For the water of it auayleth in all sicknesses, as well hotte as colde, in yt the same is of a hid nature &amp; propertie, &amp; reduceth vnto a temperament the qualitie decayed, and doth especially auaile in pacients corrupted in the spirituall members, &amp; expelleth poyson from the heart. It hath also the vertue to enlarge, and moysten the Arters, &amp; this I say, through the manifest working, that it dissolueth the grosse flewme contained in ye Lungs, without harme, and the same vlcered (no mightie matter hindering) it throughly healeth. And briefely, all matters found in the Lungs, and spirituall members, this singularly purgeth, &amp; preserueth those purged. It clenseth the blood, without any other medicine ministred. It cureth also, any fluxe of the belly, and spéedily delyuereth and

healeth any impostume of the side.
               The Ayre also distylled of it, much auayleth vnto the aforesaid matters, &amp; perhaps more, then the water, &amp; doth especially auayle in young persons, that they may perseuer &amp; continue in the same state of strength &amp; youthfull comlinesse, if they vse now &amp; than of it, &amp; in a little quantitie at a time. And it is in a manner of such a vertue, that it suffereth the blood by no meanes to putrifie, nor flewme to superabound or haue the ouerhand, nor that choller to burne. Further it doth increase blood aboue measure, and for that cause, it behoueth such vsing it, to blede often by vaine. The same Element besides doth open the vaine &amp; synewes, &amp; if any vertue shall be deminished in them, this reduceth it vnto a dew temperament. I haue besides these prooued (saith the Aucthour) that if a young person, before the state and rypnesse of his age, as in the growing tyme, shall haue the sight perished▪ let hym euery day put one droppe of this Element into the eye, and kéepe him quiet for a moneth togither, shall recouer his sight without doubt. If in any member also, any superfluous matter consisteth, or commeth apt to putrifying, this forth with dissolueth and taketh it awaye, and if it findeth any thing, that is diminished, it strengthneth the same by restoring. And this Element auayleth in the Ap
                     •
                  plexie, the falling sicknesse, the dymnesse of sight, the mygrynie, the gyddinesse of the head, and in all these it ought to be ministred with some apt electuarie, auailing vnto the purpose.
               But the fyre purchased of it, is more precious and marueylousser, and auayleth vnto all those, which the ayre helpeth, yea and vnto that which more is, of the man dead, that it restored to lyfe; this is here so ment and vnderstanded. That if in the howre of death (yet resting or ye
                     •
                  ing) be giuen of this fyre, vnto the waight or quantitie of a wheate graine, distempered or myxed with wine, in such maner entered downe, that it be past ye throte, it shall forthwith cause the person to reuyue againe, &amp; shall at the instant enter to the heart it selfe, in expelling the superfluous humours, and with this reuyueth the naturall heate of his Lyuer, and quickneth so all the partes, that it moueth the pacient &amp; very weake person, as it were within an howre to speake, and to dispose and vtter his will, &amp;c. And on this maner, I saw (sayeth the Aucthour) a myracle wrought on the noble Earle and deputie of

Paris, which before laye in a manner as dead, and immediately after he had receaued this downe, became agayne to himselfe somewhat, and within an howre after dyed. And this I ministred, and tryed in many the lyke. If olde men also vse of this fyre euerie daye, in a lyttle quantitie, it maketh olde age lustie, and to continew in lyke estate a long tyme, in that this cheareth their heartes, in such manner: that they wyll thincke themselues to possesse In 
                     •
                  enyle heartes and courages. And for that cause thys fyre, is named the Elixir vitae: yet is not this the Alchimisters Elixir▪ in that this is prepared and drawen of putrifyed blood. If the same also were made of putrifyed blood, then mans nature would ouermuch abhorre such a medicine. This conceaue, that if the Elementes shalbe distilled a seconde time ouer, they shall then be most excellent, &amp; through them may a man lyue, vnto ye vttermost peryode of his life, without disease or sickenesse, if of these be vsed, euery other day. And such a skill and knowledge consisteth in these last distillations, euen as is in the distillations of Alchymie.
               Here note of this mans blood, that I doe myxe the same freshe drawen, wyth the strongest and best Aqua vitae, and doe distill 
                     〈◊〉
                  , and the same shall serue, for the fyrst Elemente. And vpon the Feces, I powre another most strong water of lyfe, and distyll in lyke manner, and the same shall be, for the seconde Elemente. Here somewhat (séemeth to lacke) and thys I proone, sayth the Aucthour; in that he wryteth, let a latten cuppe bée made, and set on a Table, and if poyson be layde or set néere to it, the cuppe wil, then chaunge into sundry colours, like to ma

               An Oyle out of mannes ordure, doth cure the Canker, and mortifyeth the Fistula. Of the properties of the water, drawne out of mane ordure, reade among the waters out of Beastes.
               An Oyle or fatnesse, gotten out of a fatte Goose, auayleth against the colde ioynt ache, &amp; gowte: and I beléeue also (sayth the

Aucthor) that this mightily helpeth the extenuation of members. An old Goose stuffed or fylled with swynes blood, shéepes sewet, pytche, larde or common fatte of the hogge, of each two ounces, of Frankensence three ounces, &amp; a lytle waxe: this Goose so ordred, roste according to discretion, vnder which set a panne glased, to gather the fatnesse distilling, the same dilygently kéepe, and with it often annoynt the grieued place. In the lyke maner, they doe distyll a fatnesse out of a fatte whelpe, stuffed with Iunyper berryes, Beares grease, &amp;c.
               An oyle or distylled licour, gotten by discention, out of the Badgare or Graye, helping members shruncke, through synewes shrunck, borrowed out of a written booke in the Germaine tōgue. Take a Graye or Brocke, whose skynne flaye of, &amp; cutting of the head &amp; feete, and throwing away the bowels: this then so ordred, put into a glased earthen potte ful of holes in the bottome, which set into another wyder mouth potte glased within, the same after bury in the earth, when they be close luted in the seame or edge, and the mouth of the vpper potte close stopped, that no ayre out of eyther poste may passe. Which done, let a fyre of cleare coales, be made round about the vpper potte, that all the fatte by such a meanes &amp; way may from the vpper, distyll through the holes into the neather potte: and when all (by coniecture) shalbe thought distylled and come: then after with that fatnesse kept, annoynt the shruncke members.
               An oyle marueylous, gotten out of the Beuer, that helpeth any palsie, &amp; extenuacion of partes: take a Beuer, the same let be put into the strongest Aqua vitae, that it may putrifye, which after distyll with a soft fyre, with which let the partes be annoynted.
               For the extenuation of a member (resolued) distyll the féete or fatnesse, &amp; the Lyuer of a Calfe new kylled, with fine handfulles of Sage, &amp; one ounce of Pepper: with this annoint the member.
               A marueylous oyle distylled of Egges, &amp; experienced on many matters, the Aucthor not knowne: take of the yolkes of Egges sodden harde, fiftéene in number, those breake betwéene the fingers, with one dram of Pelytorie brought to powder, these distyl togyther in a glasse, but first begyn with a soft fyre, after by lytle &amp; lytle increase the fyre, so that in the ende, let the fyre be strong, vntyll all the lycour be drawn
                     •
                   and come. Which done, take of

whyte Frankensence, of Castorie, and of Ladanum, of each halfe a ounce, althese brought to pouder, mixt with ye oyle new drawē, and let these togither be distilled fowre times againe, euer powring the oyle vpon the pouders. The fire of the first and second distillation, let it be but weake, this oyle in the end kept stopped diligently in a glasse, kéepe to your vse. For this is a great secrete, and a proued matter or practise, vnto these which ensue. First this healeth the defaults &amp; griefes of the eyes, if a drop at a time shalbe instylled into them. This mortifyeth &amp; cureth by annoynting the Fistulaes. It healeth the Canker, &amp; vlcers hard to close, and doth besides that which other remedies cannot ouercome. It destroyeth and maistereth the griefe named the figge or sort, lyke to a skabbe, which groweth in the places of a mans body where heyre is▪ It taketh away the prickings of any part of the body, &amp; cureth thē. It healeth the mattery skabbe on the head, if ye heyres afore be shauen away, &amp; that the skinne be rubbed with a lynnen cloth wette in lye, &amp; that dried in, annoynt the places after wyth the oyle. This also profiteth the Apoplexie &amp; especially the gowte if the places be annointed with it twise a day, for fowre dayes togither. This also speedily healeth the burning of fire, by annoynting the places with it, &amp; cureth the disease called the woulfe.
               An oyle out of egges: take sixe egges, which boyle vnto a hardnesse, after the shelles pylled of, cut away the whites, the yolkes after with your fingers, breake into smal péeces, those put into a frying panne, which whilest they heate &amp; fry sturre to and fro, by little &amp; little, with a spone, vntill they begin so to melt, &amp; runne in the panne, yet doth the substance remaine, of a yelow colour, whē the whole shall be in this redinesse, powre the substance into lynnen bagges, which wring hard in a presse, &amp; you shall possesse a lycour or yelow oyle, with which annoynt the burnings.
               Others, after the yolkes be so heated &amp; molten in a pan, vnto the time the substance run about the pan, yet do they further heate, &amp; as it were fry thē, vntill they appeare dry and blacke in the pan, which they assoone after as these shall thus be dried, and become blacke, do melt them againe, &amp; by that meanes cause a plentifull moisture, &amp; blacke, to run forth, yet ill sauoring. Thē with a spone those which be in the frying pan, they stur grossoly togither, yt the oyle &amp; all the humour fallen to the one side of the frying pan, may

like fall into the other side, and be so gathered to vse.

Take the hard yolkes of seuentie egges sodden, out of which let an oyle be drawen after this maner: let them be put into a frying panne on the fyre, which stur to &amp; fro with a spone diligently, and let the same so long frye, vntyll it be well molten, the whole after put into lynnen bagges, wette before in water, which wring harde out in a presse, and an oyle will distyll forth.

               A Iuyce or lycour, pressed out of the hard yolkes of Egges sodden, and instilled or dropped into the eares, doth much helpe the ringing and sounding of the Eares. The oyle of the yolkes of egges druncke, before meate, putteth away drunckennesse, howe mightily any drincketh. If paine vexeth a person, by the cutting of any member, if is cured by the oyle of the yolkes of egges, and Goose grease incorporated togyther, vnto the forme of an oyntment, and of it applyed vpon, which doth marueylously asswage the paine, and causeth sléepe. This also mytigateth the payne of the priuie member, annoynted with it. The vse of it also serueth in Alchymical works, in that the same fixeth certaine medicines.

The water distilling, wyll then come redde as blood: which at the ende of the distyllacion, powre into a glasse, dilygently stopping it, &amp; letting it there stand, vntyl the water come most cleare, &amp; be of a Rubine colour. The same then distyl agayne by Balneo Mariae, aboue sixe or seuen tymes, thorow which it loseth the redde colour, &amp; receyueth a golden colour, and it then obtayneth a most sweete &amp; fragrant sauour. This quyntisence, doth dyssolue gold, and maketh it potable or to be drunck, &amp; the lyke, it dyssolueth all precious stones infused or put in it. For this is a blessed water, which giuen to the quantity of two or thre drams, vnto a person lying at the poynt of death, maketh him speedily recouer &amp; come to him selfe againe. If with it wounds or other fores be washed, or applyed wet vpon, are spéedily cured. This the lyke healeth the cough, the rewme, &amp; sicknesses of the splene. If it shalbe twē

I have (sayth the Aucthour) giuen it to a person of ye palsie, xlvi. dayes, through which he was thorowly cured. This besides healeth the falling sicknesse, &amp; preserueth the body from putrifying. To whome I gaue this by the mouth, I ministred it so closelie (in that I would not be sene of any standing about) thorow my which doing, and the successe that followed, they supposed me to vse some maner of incantacions. This borrowed out of the gréeke Leonarde Fiorauant.

But washing the face with the fyrst water, maketh it comely and fayre, and preserueth the skynne a long tyme, from appearing olde. These two, haue many noble women vsed, and founde great vtility by them: as well for the face, as colouring the heyre, to their great admiration, as wryteth the Aucthour, Leonarde Fiorauant.

The oyle is on this wyse prepared: take new waxe (&amp; Gesnerus iudgeth virgin waxe to be takē) &amp; the same especially fat, which you shall leasurely melt in some vessel▪ with a soft fyre, &amp; the same you shall often washe, and thryst hard togyther in wine, which you shal melt agayne, and into the same molten, shall you put many small pieces broken, of Tyles made glowing hote, which may so drinck vp much of the waxe, and this doe a second, and thyrd tyme, if néede shall requyre, vntyll all the waxe be thus druncke vp: which done, put al your small and fine pieces of Tyles, into that croked body named a Retorte, the same

dilygently fence with the lute of wysdome, to which fasten a receauer, to receyue the drops distylling: the first which commeth, wyll be a water, but in the end wyl a most pure oyle distyl forth, which you may vse vnto the mollifying &amp; softning of members: this Bartholomeus Maggius, in the cure of harde swellings. I learned (sayth the Aucthour) of a certaine Alchymister in Padua (in Italie) that Sande very well washed, after syfted and myxed with the waxe molten, would let the rysing and boyling vp of the waxe. There be some, which to waxe, &amp; all other Rosen substances to be distylled, put to glasse fyne brought to powder▪ by which meanes it letteth the rysing of the waxe, but this then causeth in the distyllacion, that the oyles after distylled with it, purchase a certayne strange and an vngratefull sauour, through the salt Alkali, for which cause, this ought vtterly to be refused. Some say that in the distylling it maketh a noyse, as it woulde breake the glasse. The oyle of waxe worketh myracles, in the ceasing of paynes, as of the gowte, and ioynt aches. This to conclude, is a singuler remedy to many grieffes, and a most temperate oyle: for which cause, it is highly commended in wounds, and vlcers.

For there are three kynds of remedies, prepared of the Antymonie: which eyther gyuen within ye body, or applied without, doe cause myracles.

               Of the oyle of Antymonie. The .xxv. Chapter.
               THe preparing and making of an Oyle of Antymonie, which I receyued and learned of a certayne friend, is on this wyse: take of crude Antymonie, and of crude Tartare, of each halfe a pound, these after the beating togyther in a morter, or labouring on a stone, put into a pot well glased before, the mouth of which let be close couered, with a couer &amp; lute, that no ayre after breath forth, and the pot so prepared, giue to the potter, to set among other pottes to bake in his Furnace. For by this burning it is made a paste, and blackishe or swartishe redde of colour, rounde formed, and easily brought to powder: which after the potte is through colde, &amp; the pot opened, let the substaunce be taken forth, beaten, &amp; brought agayne into fine powder, after powred againe into another pot well glased, on which powre distylled vineger so much, that it may lie two fingers breadth aboue the substance: this pot then set on a Furnace to be heated, that the vyneger may approche &amp; drawe to a rednesse, and with the same coloured. And it ought to stande on the Furnace, for thrée or fowre howers, the vyneger after shyfted into a distyllatory of glasse, &amp; other vineger powred vpon: and the same so often doe (I suppose sixe, or eyght tymes) vntyll the vyneger be no more coloured. All that coloured vineger powred forth, distyll by a Lymbecke, that the vyneger may so be seperated by distyllacion, &amp; the redde substaunce abyde or remaine in the bottome. Which done, breake the glasse, taking the whole forth, which cleaueth or sticketh to the glasse, &amp; put into an ypocrase bagge made of whyte cloath, the same hang in a cold &amp; moyst Seller, where the oyle wyll distyll forth drop by drop, into a glasse standing vnder. And in this maner, was a certayne Practisioner, woont often to prepare and make the same.
               
                  An oyle of Antimonie also is gotten after this maner, cōmunicated to Gesnerus, by a most skylful practisioner, in the making of this matter. Let ye 
                  Antimonie be brought into most fine powder, and powred into a glasse bodie, on which a most sharpe wyne vyneger powred, and the same distylled, stiepe on a soft heate of fire, (least the glasse breake) so long tyme, vntyll the vineger be chaunged redde. The same thus coloured, powre into another glasse, and on the Feces powre new distylled vineger, vntyll the same in lyke maner hath purchased a redde colour. These powrings vpon, and addicions of new vineger on the Feces, ought so often to be repeated, vntyl the powders send out of them no more rednesse. The vineger all gathered ought to be distylled with a soft fyre, vntyll the rednesse begynning a lytle &amp; lytle to thicken, seame to aryse &amp; appeare in the head. Then are the vessels to be cooled, &amp; the redde lycour, set to dygest vnder hote horse doong for xl. dayes, vntyl it attayneth ye perfite forme of an oyle. The same some affyrme, to be so sweet as sugar: to cease al paints of woūds, &amp; to heale them perfitly as certayne wryte: besydes it doth marueylously cure throublesome and tedious vlcers▪ &amp; such Cankred.
               Another secrete of Antimonie, which also vnto the white work, not meanly auayleth: take af Antimonie brought to powder, ▪xi. ounces, of Tartare calcyned .ix. ounces, these after the myxing togyther, put into a goldsmythes melting pot, which closely luted &amp; stopped, set into a Furnace for two howres, &amp; it wyl well be calcyned, the same after it be cooled, and the mouth of the pot opened, you shall finde the substance in the pot, to be of a darcke ashie colour, myxed with certayne yellow spottes. This then beaten in a morter, put into hote water, and boyled in an yron panne, let the whole be after distylled by fyltering, which distylleth lyke to lye. The first water yssewing is redde &amp; troubled, which poured after on the Feces, wyll distyll &amp; be gathered cleare. This water then euaporate in a glasse Cucurbite in sande, vntyll the substance be left drye, or the moysture resolued. But this matter left in the sande distyll, as first with a soft fyre, after with a stronger, vntyll the spirites of the Antimonie begyn to ascend, &amp; begyn as it were to colour the necke of the Lymbeck lyke golde. Then set the matter in it selfe, be cyrculated. Some report, that if thynne syluer plates be layd in this that they are wholye gylded, &amp; appeare like golde, in such maner, that rubbed with the touch stone, they yet

appeare as gold. But I suppose (sayth the Aucthour) that it wyll be farre better, if the first troubled water coloured be kept a part, and new powred on the Feces: for peraduenture the seconde and thyrd water, would draw &amp; carry with them more of the rednesse of the Antimonie, which after gathered into one, may then be drawne with a soft fyre, vntyll the oylie rednesse appearing.
               Another maner, which a certaine practisioner often exercised &amp; vsed: let first the rednesse of the Antimonie, drawne many tymes by the distylled vineger, as is aboue taught, &amp; let the exhaltacion of the vineger be after done on a soft fyre, and the redde powder preserued in the bottome. Let the Quintessence then of wyne be powred to it, &amp; stande to cyrculate togyther for forty dayes: this after may safely be ministred by the mouth, into the bodie.
               Another maner, of the same Aucthor: take the Tartare calcyned vnto a whytnesse, let it runne with the Antimonie in a gold
                     •
                  smit
                     •
                  es Crucible, this after brought into powder, dissolue in hote water: and you shal so finde a certayne rednesse to swym aboue ye water, all which gathered, &amp; put into a retort, a water first ysseweth, &amp; a most bewtiful redde oyle after foloweth, let ye same be cyrculated for ▪xl. dayes, &amp; the best oyle of Antimonie wyl thē be purchased, lesse corros
                     •
                  ue. And this maner, who that can be vnderstand and compasse, shall attaine a rytch oyle, singular in many causes.
               Another oyle of Antimonie, learned of a Frenche Empericke: take of Antimonie two poūds, of Tartare, &amp; of salt nyter, of each thrée ounces, of copper Incisi one pound, al these grinded togither, put after into a glasse body, &amp; not vnglased body, which set into a furnace, make a great fire for three howres. After ye cooling of the vessell by the owne accord, breake the vessel, &amp; you shal find in the bottom ye 
                  Mercurie of the Antimonie seperated from ye brimstone, which you shal seperate from the vpper: this done, burne after the vpper face so lōg, vntyl it be come impalpable, &amp; of a redde color, ye same thē put into a glasse Lymbeck wel luted, if it afore be dissolued in most strong vineger. Which distyll after the maner &amp; order of strong water, &amp; you shall possesse a most precious oyle lyke to blood. Note, that the Mercurie drawne out of the Antimonie, is a most pure golde, with which if you wyll colour, take then of the oyle of Antimonie one ounce, of Aeris v

                  : which put vnto the royall cemente, after vnto Capella, and you shal obtayne most pure golde. But these royall cements, and the Capellas also, doe goldsmythes prepare and make.
               Another discription of the Oyle of Antymonie, not to be contempned, cōmunicated to Gesnerus by a skylfull practisioner, and very studious in these matters. Take of Antymonie thrée poūds or fowre, which dyssolue in a goldsmythes pot, that it may rūne. After powre a measure of vineger, into an earthen glased vessell: which done, and the Antymonie molten, let him then instyll by great care &amp; dyligence, a little of this molten Antymonie into the vineger (taking diligent care, that you instyll not to much at one tyme, in that the vessell then breaking, you should lose both oyle &amp; your labour) &amp; a red fume wyl breath forth, &amp; the vineger also wyl become so red as blood. So that by times, &amp; a litle &amp; lytle, and euen by drops as it were, must the whole Antimonie be thus instilled. For ye same is in a glasse bodie, that the vineger floting aboue it, must alwayes be seperated, &amp; so often, as it is molten in the goldsmythes vessell. The Antimonie then must be againe molten in the Crucible, as afore, &amp; as the same shall be molten, it must then by lytle and lytl

                     •
                  e instylled into the vineger▪ as aboue taught, &amp; the same ought to be repeated seuen tymes, that it may so drawe and gather both the property and rednesse. The vineger is consumed by the same order, &amp; for that cause must other vineger be powred vpon (for if the pot or vessell shall remayne eyther emptie, or bée ouer fylled, the vessell breaketh: for which cause, you must especially take heede of the excesse) least the vessell by such meanes breaketh. That if it shall be repeated seuen tymes, let the redde vineger in a glasse body dilygently luted, be distilled in ashes: and a whyte vineger wyl yssew, but the oyle remaineth behynd in the bottome. Which on this wyse done, and the spring or Cunduicte water left so with the oyle for a tyme, that softly powred forth, and distylled againe, the sauour af the vineger may so be taken from the oyle. The same after it shall be thus twyse togyther ordred, that is, the second tyme Cunduite water shalbe powred vpon, &amp; by distyllacion shall after seperate the same, you

shall then obtayne a swéete oyle of Antimonie, in the bottome of the Cucurbite or glasse bodie. But this forme and maner of dystylling, can not so well be vttered and discrybed in wordes, as by demonstracion to the eye, and syght of the same done.
               This waye and manner also of making the Oyle of Antimonie, is not to be contempned: which as it should seame, Theophrastus Paracelsus, accoumpted for a rare secrete. He tooke of Antimonie halfe a pounde, of Sugarcandie sixe ounces, these brought to fine powder, distyl in sande, or in Balneo, according to arte. Of this oyle take one ounce, of Aloes succotryne halfe an ounce, of Amber two drams, of Saffron thrée drams, these after reduce into a masse, of which make small pylles, according to discretion: let thrée of these be mynistred or gyuen by the mouth, with the conserue of Borrage, before the fytte of the Ague, and the pacient procured to sweate, if it be possible.
               I heare of an oyle of Antimonie, to be distylled in the worthy Citie of Vlmes in Germanie, by a notable Phisition, in the lyke order and maner, as the strong water (or water of seperation) is woont to be made. Which afore wrought into most fine powder, and myxt with a small quantity of good Aqua vitae: for thus prepared, it may aptlie be applyed and giuen by the mouth, for the healing of vlcers within the bodie. Such an oyle also is exercysed and vsed of the Chyrurgians, in the Cittie of Norimberge, which applyed, doth forth with eate or take away superfluous, or rotten fleshe. This oyle of the Antimonie is prepared, with the salt G
                     •
                  mme, and Ammoniacum.
               
               Another maner of oyle there is, which a certayne practisioner druncke before mée (but certayne affyrme the same not to bée an oyle, but rather a certayne washing or Lye) yet I suppose the same (sayth the Aucthour) to be distylled. Others affyrme it to be prepared, lyke the oyle of Vitryoll: of which matter, reade more in that booke named Coelum Philosophorum, where the maner of such a preparing, and this oyle is fully taught. And I heare (
                     •
                  sayth the Aucthour) that the Chyrurgians of Norimberge doe much and often vse this oyle.
               There is besydes a certayne oyle prepared and made, which by reason of the rednesse, is named the blood of Stibium, which oyle is most singular vnto créeping vlcers, and maligne to cure,

for this dryeth &amp; taketh away all the malignity of them: and this oile is made after this maner, out of the learned Fallopio of Mettals or mynes. They take (sayth he the Regulum of Antimonie, which is here ment the Antimonie, fyue or sixe tymes molten &amp; cooled. For they take the Stibium, melting if, and letting it coole, which they agayne melt, and coole the same, &amp; procéede after this maner, vnto the fyft, or syxt time: so yt the Stibium which the last tyme remaineth cooled &amp; compact, they name Regulū. Now they take this Regulum, &amp; soften it on a marble, on which they powre the distilled vineger, &amp; when the same shall be very well softned: they put into an ypocrasse bagge to fylter, and powre distilled vineger vpon, vntyl the Antimonie shal be wholy dyssolued &amp; molten through, and that nothing remayneth behynd in the fylter or bagge, but all fyltred into the vessell set vnder. They after take the strayning, or that lycour, and put it into a Lymbeck, &amp; dra
                     •
                  re forth a lycor: which drawne, there remaineth a certayne substāc
                     •
                   in the bottome of the Lymbeck, lyke to a redde feces, which they take, &amp; put into a fyltring cloath, hanging it in a moyst place, that the feces may so melt (through the moysture of the place) into a vessell standing vnder: and the same which melteth and runneth through, is the oyle, which otherwyse is named the blood of the Antimonie, a medycine (as aboue vttered) the notablest vnto creeping, and wicked vlcers.
               An oyle of Antimonie, which is the flower of all mettalles, redde in colour, as the Rubyne (for so doth some, comm
                     •
                  nd it) it may safelye be taken by the mouth, vnto the wayght of thrée graines: for in tast it is swéete, pertaking most lightly of a sharpnesse: he valewed fowre drams wayght of it, at two Crownes. He knew lytle vse or none of it, yet inuented he (at the first) to sell the same of a great pryce. I my selfe tasted (sayth the Aucthour) &amp; found a certaine sweetnesse of it, &amp; saw the rednesse tending vnto a sanguine colour: and a droppe or two let fall into water, went to the bottome. This out of a letter sent vnto Gesnerus.
               
               Another redde oyle of Antimonie, the ab
                     ••
                  esayd person hath, which I (sayth the Aucthour) neuer saw, vnlike to the first colour, and of a burning qualitye, whose smallest portion prouooked the bladder, &amp; burned, that vnto this daye, the least portion of it, dare not safely be gyuen, through the wicked quality not sufficiently

corrected (whether of the crude qualitie, I can not iustly report.) This oyle powred to Aqua fortis (through the vitriol, the Alome, and salt peter) it stayneth Mercurie of a yellow colour. These I vnderstoode of him, in that I could not come to the sight of it: he esteemed or valued half an ounce of this oyle: at a Floreyne. This I learned by the letters of a certayne Phisition vnto Gesnerus.
               
               The oyle or Quintessence of Antimonie, when the same is prepared and made after a dewe fourme and maner, is a most precious medycine, to be vsed as well within the bodie, as without, and the quantity of one drop giuen at a tyme by the mouth, eyther with wyne or broth, or any other distylled water, doth as well emptie the bodie by vomytting, as downewarde by syege: &amp; this giuen to a sicke person, doth throughly cure him of any crude, and maligne kynde of sicknesse: as by tryall, a further truth may be knowne. And this locally applyed on wicked vlcers, doth marueylously clense them. The making of which oyle or quintessēce, is on this wyse: take a quantity of the strongest vineger, the same distyl thrise ouer, to which ad of Antimonie so much as you wyl, brought to fine powder, these put togyther in a body of glasse, but let the vyneger flote thrée fingers aboue the Antimonie, then sturre them very wel togither, &amp; setting the body on hote imbers, let the substaunce boyle a lytle space, vntyll the vineger become redde, which after the being redde, let then setle, vntyl it appeare cleare, the same empty into another body, and on the feces powre the lyke quantity of distylled vineger, as afore taught: the same a whyles boyle, &amp; empty after into another body: &amp; doe on this maner so often, vntyl the vineger wyl no more be changed, &amp; become redde: this done, the feces throw away, and all the redde vineger gathered, powre into a crooke necked body or Retort, that is verie well luted, and distyll the vyneger, which wyll yssew forth cleare &amp; whyte: but take dilygent heede, when the redde droppes begynne to distyll: at the sight of which, draw away the receauer with the vyneger, putting vnder another glasse, and the fyre increase stronger &amp; stronger, vnto the ende of the worke, or that all the substance be yssewed forth: for this come, is the quintessence of the Antimonie, which diligently kéepe in a glasse close stopped, that no ayre breath forth. And this is the myraculous oyle, that mortifyeth all kynds of rotten and wicked vlcers: for by bathing

on them with the sayde oyle, are mortifyed, for which cause this healeth them in a short tyme, and with easinesse: and gyuen besydes with any lycour by the mouth, doth heale any wicked sicknesse, as aboue vttred. So that this Quintessence of Antimonie, may be accoumpted and named a holy lycour, and precious for the health of mans body. This borrowed out of the singuler practyses of the gréeke, Leonard Fiorauant.
               
               Of the same, doth a certayne Phisition thus wryte: I fynde the oyle of Antimonie to be prepared and made, by Stibium most finely brought to powder, and so often washed and infused in dystyll vineger, vntyll it wyl no more colour nor stayne the fingers, which after sublyme: for this they say, to auayle against the vlcered Canker, that it créepeth no further: and so to let or staye, that the Canker eateth nor payneth any more.
               An oyle of Antimonie of the Alchymistes, vnto the colouring of Luna or Syluer, is on this wyse prepared, as I found the same wrytten (sayth the Aucthour) in an olde Alchymy booke. Take a a quantity of vineger three tymes distylled ouer, in this dyssolue of salt artyficiall one part, of salt Alkali two partes, after the dyssoluing, distyll a strong water. Then take of Antimonie, so much as you shal thinck needeful, powring of the sayd water vpon, and distilled with a soft fyre, powre vpon the water againe, &amp; this doe for fowre times togither. In the end, when ye moisture shal ascēd, &amp; that whytishe fumes appeare, then by increasing the fire stronger &amp; stronger, you shall purchase the true oyle of Antimonie. Of this oile take three parts, of ye oyle of the Sun one part, of the oile of Mercurie one part, these put vnto fixing, doth colour &amp; change the Moone, Mercurie, &amp; Iupiter prepared, into ye Sun most perfit.
            
            
               Of the preparation of Antimonie, that is lyke seene through as the glasse, and the sundry effects of the same powder. The ▪.xxvj. Chapter.
               A Certaine practisioner in the Citie of Vlma in Germany, chose the Stibium, that had long strakes within, which the longer they were, so much the better he accoumpted it: &amp; he tooke away the vpper part, or his spume, he after tenne or fowretéene dayes, grynded the Stibium on a marble with vineger, for one day styll or continually: but in the nyght he letteth it alwayes drye, and the next daye he alwayes gryndeth it agayne.
               
                  
                  
               
               The precious stone of Antimonie, cleare through as the Iacynt, they prepare and make after this maner: the fine powder of the Stibium they put into a goldsmithes Crucible, couering the same with another Crucible, which two they close &amp; fast lute togyther with strong lute, letting ye lute drye. After they set the Crucibles on the fyre and couer them wholie, vntyll the powders melt and runne within: this masse then taken out, &amp; brought to fine powder, they thus cōmyt to the fyre, for two or three tymes togyther, and at the thyrd time, they powre the lyquide masse, on a smooth Marble stone, which sone coniealeth and is harde, and is transparent or to be seene through, euen as a precious stone or glasse. It is sufficiently burned or calcyned, by twyse doing ouer, and at the thyrd tyme molten, and powred forth.
               Another preparatiō of Antimonie, not much dyffering from the same, which Matthiolus in his second ediciō of Dioscorides discribeth, sauing that he addeth also certaine other things, where here nothing at al is mixed. Take of crude Antimonie, the same grind very fine on a stone, which put into a small Crucible, not glased, setting it vnto a soft fyre, that the same may putrify &amp; be clensed:

and stur it continually with an Iron spattle, vntill the substance begin to gather vp rounde, which then remoue or take away, and grind the like on a stone, as afore, &amp; put into the Crucible, setting the same to the fire againe, &amp; let this so often times be done, vntil the pouder be chaunged &amp; come vnto an Ashie white color, &amp; this will be, about the x. or twelf, or more times. After let this be put into a like Crucible, yt the goldsmythes commonly vse, &amp; the same Artly couered, set into coales, that they may lie burning thrée fingers aboue the Crucible, for on such wise, shal the substāce melt &amp; be decocted sufficiētly, within the space of half an howre, the same after take forth, &amp; powre into thin plates in a latton basen, &amp; cooled, keepe diligently in a dry bore. For you shal haue, yt you desire.
               A certaine preparation of Antimonie, which many hyde for a most great secret, &amp; this discription did a notable Phisition send vnto Gesnerus, who was a singuler frend of Gesnerus. After that the Stibiū
                   is calcyned, it must so oftē be powred forth, as the same may be molten, in a Crucible. And ye same ought so often be molten, as any impure matter remaineth in it, &amp; for that cause, the spume alwayes gathered away. And at the last melting, but litle of the spume must be taken away, &amp; the same part to which the spume cleaueth, (as a cloude) must be throwen away. The same is rightly prepared, yt is cleare and to be seen through, in a maner without any spot, after the forme of a Iacint, which neerer draweth or approcheth to a yelow, thē vnto a red &amp; blackish colour. And the same the paler it appeereth, so much the better it is, so that it be pure, without any cloude, or blacke spotte.
               An Antimonie like to glasse, yt may be séen through, &amp; draweth to a rednesse, cōmunicated to Gesnerus as a secret, by a singuler Phisition. First take of Antimonie finely brought to pouder (on a stone, or Marble) so much as you thinke néedeful, the same put into a new earthen pot not glased, which set on a meane fire, in such order, that it may seeme to leane on the one side, as the pots that burne the leade, &amp; to stur after the substance about with a spatle. But when ye matter beginneth first to fume (of the fume shal you beware, as you wold of poison, if you be wise) which after powre on a Marble, &amp; grind about, vntill the same be cold. This thē put againe into the pot, sturring the same (as aboue taught) &amp; when it beginneth to fume, powre it forth &amp; grind ye same, as afore rehersed.

This so oftē repeate, vntill it approcheth to a browne colour, or otherwise is as black as glasse, which is performed in a maner by the tenth time repeated. Thē take of crude Antimonie half an ounce, which melt at a strong fire, and of the browne Antimonie burnt &amp; brought to pouder, as aboue vttered, fowre ounces, these by litle &amp; litle put into a Crucible, vnto ye time the halfe ounce of of the Antimonie moltē, &amp; the whole be powred in, which so melt togither, &amp; when it shal be a whiles thus moltē, powre ye substāce on a smooth &amp; cold stone. The same cooled melt againe, &amp; repeate the like, vntil it sheweth as glasse of a firie colour, or like to a Rubine. That if you shal diligently marke, &amp; follow this order, you can not erre (beleeue me) sayth the Authour.
               Of the Antimonie thus prepared, they mixe a few graines (either fiue, or sixe) with one scruple of the iuyce of blacke Ellebere artificially drawen, or more, &amp; they forme pilles of ye same, which they name the pilles of life yt do marueilous matters, as they report. And yt the reader should not be frustrate of any matter, nor of the preparatiō of this iuyce, for ye cause I wil not here discame to write the same, yt al mē may conceiue, that there consisteth nothing in me worthy memory, yt I refrain to vtter, &amp; make knowē to the world, so wel of mine owne practises, as those learned and purchased of ye singuler Gesnerus, to the benefite of all young students, &amp; fauourers of good knowledge. Therfore vnderstand, that the iuyce of the Ellebore is thus drawē, let one pound of ye blacke Ellebore be stieped in hot water for certain howres, the same thē shifted forth, powre vpon other freshe water, &amp; the same repeate ii
                     •
                  . or v. times, &amp; in the end that water, which is no more bitter, boile vnto a thicknesse of honie. About the middle of this boiling, adde of the iuyce of Alkakengi or winter cherries purified, two ounces &amp; a half, but about the ende, of Annise seedes, &amp; of Cinamō of each one ounce, of fennel seedes half an ounce, of the flowres of Nymphaee or the water lillie two ounces (where must be considered, whether these ought not to enter in the substaunce but rather to be put in the last infusion of the Ellebore, and to be strayned togyther, that the water alone maye after bée boyled vnto a consumption) in the ende must a little Masticke be added, or at least in the forming of the Pylles. This procureth thrée or foure stooles wythout griefe, &amp; causeth the belly to remaine sufficient

solluble many dayes after. A certaine person requyred a great value to be giuen him, for a dose of these.
               Another maner of preparing the Antimonie, that a certayne practisioner, which prepared the same for his Ladie, had learned: &amp; this by happe he left briefly noted in wryting: he bought (sayth the Aucthour) of Stimmeos fowre ounces and a halfe, that is, one quarter of a pounde &amp; better of our wayght, the same brought to powder &amp; searsed: he melted 
                     •
                  n a whyte earthen pot (the mouth of it couered with a great burning coale, so layd vpon, that the same could not fall of) vpon the coales into the fyre: and when this was through cold, he dilygently cōsidered whether any other myxture of matter consisted in it, that approached to Tynne, or rather somwhat like Tinne (being altogither of the same kind) which many tymes the lyke hapneth in the Antimonie seperated, and is easily discerned &amp; knowne: which vnlesse the same be remooued &amp; cleared away, it permysteth not the Antimonie, or rather so hyndereth, when the same is molten, that it can not be transparent or seene cleare through: but we foūd no such matter in this Stimmi or Stibium: that if he had séene or knowne before the lyke, he would then not haue molten it. But now this blacke substaunce brought againe to pouder, he powred into a Crucible made of the best earth, new, and neuer wetted, and set on a meane fyre to calcyne, vnto the performance of which matter, he vsed almost a day &amp; a halfe, and sturred the same al the whyles with a large spattle of yron, styll and continually about (but some, as I remember, do calcyne the same in an earthen skellet or pan) but he rather supposed the colour to come the darcker through the yron vessell (and the whyles dyd a most wicked sauour of Brimstone continually breath forth) through which (he reported) ye whyles he was thus bus
                     •
                  ed, the same did often molest &amp; grieue his head, in such maner as if a fyt of sicknesse should incontinent folow. Now this is perceyued and knowne to be sufficiently calcyned, when it no more sendeth forth the sauour of Brimstome, and that the same appeareth of an ashie colour, nor can after in the calcyning be burned. The pot in the ende sheweth burned, and although it be cract and hath a cleft in it (as the lyke he reporteth, his pot had) yet may the same last and serue vnto the ende of the worke, vnlesse the cleft shall waxe and be greater. After these, let it be taken forth, and

brought agayne to fine powder in a morter, &amp; powred in a Crucible for an howre space almost, and fyre made to it for halfe an howres tyme, this fyre after dyminishe by lytle and lytle: that if there yet consisteth or remaineth any strange matter behynd, the same may eyther be taken away, or purged in the flying away. The Crucible must be couered with another pot, that it may the soner be molten. When this shall be through colde, adde to it one dram of Chrysocolla, which brought to powder, shalbe mixed in a morter, and the whole powred into a crucible, that it may be molten, then occupy a long yron spattle, or rodde, in that a certayne peryll inseweth by touching the substance, howsoeuer it were, if we may beleeue him. An the melting or rūning, which is hardly done at the first (in that for an howre or more standing in the fire, with great coales layd round about, &amp; blowne after with a byggs payre of bellowes, the Crucible, all the whyles appearing redde hote, the substaunce scarcely melted in that space (yet after the same was moltē, he powred it on a marble or smoth stone, according to length, or rather in thicke and round plates. The colour of the stone, in the first melting, is whytish. The second melting, and al the others, succéede &amp; come much soner. After the first melting, it begynneth next to appeare and shew of a darck yellow colour: which lytle or nothing altereth, but abydeth in the same colour in a maner, after the sixt tyme molten. When the matter powred forth, is through cold, it must agayne be brought to fyne powder in a morter, and molten.
               Another maner of preparing the Stibium, take what quantity you wyll, the same bring to powder: but first wash it well in cold cunduite water, vntyl in the same washing this appeareth pure, after wash this againe in the water of Roses, &amp; the blessed thistle, which let the substance drincke in. This powder then set in the Sunne, vntyll it cleaueth togither in gobbettes or bygge pieces: which agayne bringing into fyne powder, powre into a Crucible. The same melt, with a soft fyre: which as sone as a yellow vapour, and in the colour of Arsenicke, begynneth to breath forth, and that purple spumes or fomes swell or rise vp to the brymme, increase the fyre, adding a certayne quantity of each, answering to the substance, of salt nyter, of the vrine of a sanguine or redde man, dyssolued togither with that named Hydrargyrū, and spitle

of the same man, so nygh as you can, that these may so be fyxed: which thus ordred, and mixed in equal portions agréeable, sturre about with an yron, or steele rodde, vntyll all the gréene, &amp; yellow vapors in a maner, be breathed forth. The clāmynesse &amp; gl
                     •
                  wish cleauing to of it, you shall thus correct, in that the same which otherwyse was not persitely lyquide, but stycketh, or cleaueth to only, lyke glew, shall you cause to melt &amp; run. By the syde of the Crucible, you shal set a marble stone, and in the sturring softly about with the rodde, powre the liquide matter forth with a brode spattle on a smooth marble stone, when the tyme requyreth. For the vppermost and most frothie by a great deale powre forth, the myddle (being the purer) next, and the lowest more drossie or fuller of Feces, powre last forth with the spattle, the same which runneth whole in the powring forth, myxe not with the vpper spumes, or the middle parts mixe not with the lowest (in that the myddle parts be iudged the better) for which cause, you must dyligently seperate them, in powring forth vntyll the whole be emptied. But after what maner &amp; how this may be learned &amp; known these wyl sufficiently instruct &amp; shew, both in the ringing or soūd, &amp; Syluer bryghtnesse of the mydle partes. But in the sturring about and powring forth, least the wicked and venemous fume, &amp; that drye spirite entereth into the mouth and nosethrelles, a man must carefully beware, for yt the same sauour is in a maner deadlye: so that many there be, which drawe a bladder on the face, to eschew this euyll. Now so much as shall be of the purest, and of that note (as in the ringing &amp; clearenesse) put into a glasse, which couer with burning water sixe tymes rectifyed, the same distyll (whether by a Retorte) and a redde water wyll first yssewe, this drawe awaye, and put vnder another Receauer, gathering the same which shall distyll forth. At last, in the wynter or colder time that this may so much the better gather &amp; thicken togither) dygge in the groūd of a stable, a f

                  erryes cast amōg, after the cleansing of the place, strawe then horse doong meanly moyst, a foote hygh: in which set the glasse (that the lycour is contained, which yssewed in the former distillacion) and couer it (the pype of the same, which shall be put into the Receauer, stoppe dylygently

with the Philosophers lute) &amp; at the fowrth day you shal vncouer the glasse, putting about &amp; couering it with freshe doong. And when all is come, that wyll yssew forth, you haue purchased the thycke lycour, resembling or drawing nere to the lycour of Amber. Which powre into christaline &amp; syluerlyke plates, these set abrode, in a cold &amp; cleare skye, the North wind then blowing, that they may thycken &amp; fryse (for these wyll then be lyke as wée haue seene) in the end we haue melted them with so lytle a heate, as the Gum is molten: they annoynt with this, desperate Cankers left as incurable, the palsie members▪ the Apoplexie, &amp; ioynt aches: and they inwardly mynister two or three graynes at the most, finely brought to powder. And I heare that he gaue to the person infected with ye plague, not bleeding by vaine afore, which shortly after dyed: but to another I heard, he gaue the same dose, but letting him blood before, and he escaped with lyfe.
               How the redde spirites, is drawne or gotten out of Antimonie, is the most rare secrete, of a certaine notable Chyrurgian. Take of pure Antimonie two or thrée poūds, this dryed &amp; brought into fine powder, put into an earthen Cucurbite, vnder which make a soft fire in the beginning, for twenty howers space, after increase your fire somewhat hoter, the next stronger &amp; stronger, vnto the ende of .xxxvi. howers. In the belly of the earthen Receauer or Cucurbite, on the syde a high, fasten in a woodden pynne, which now and then drawne out of the hole, doth vtter and expresse the colour of the spirite breathing further and cleauing too, as fyrst whyte, next yellowishe and yellowe, and last manifestly redde. This sublymation being thus perfourmed, and the vesselles through colde (the powder sublymed by force of the fyre) let it be purged from the Receauer eyther with a feather, or soft Pares foote, and put into a Retorte, which set into Balneo Mariae, where let a seconde exhaltacion be wrought, which also receyue and gather in a glasse or earthen receauer. For in the same maner shall you purchase a powder wholie sanguine in color. And the receauers into which the spirites or fume of the Antimonie breatheth, ought alwayes o be cooled, with Lynnen cloathes wet in cold water &amp; applyed vpon. For the Receauers cooled often, doe by that meanes, draw to thē so much ye sooner, the fume of the Antimony.
                  
Then the bellyes of the receauers ought to be set vpwardes, and the mouthes into which the Cucurbites are fixed, placed downewardes, as the figure hereafter playner demonstrateth. The Cucurbyte into which the sublymed Antimonie must be put, ought to be fensed with the lute of wysedome. But the Cucurbytes receauing, ought to be fourmed through the lute, to indure the fyre. Let theyr neckes be long, in a maner of an arme length: and the belly by that reason large, least stuffed or filled with the spirites it breaketh. But let the necke be so large, that the hande to the elbow may easily be put in, and drawne out againe, euen as this figure here to the eye, doth more perfitly expresse.

               Of the Antimonie prepared, the iudgement of the learned, and of the vse of it. The .xxvij. Chapter.
               OF the Antimonie prepared, which shineth like to glasse, doth a certaine learned man thus iudge, as séemeth by the letters

vnto Gesnerus: I haue (sayth he) throughly reuolued &amp; called vnto iudgement the essence of the red Antimonie prepared, &amp; I finde that this glasse, not to be the same of ye old Philosophers, of which they write so many matters, although of ye like it may be made, in that it is more earthly &amp; of the grosser partes, for which cause, although we trie and finde out sundry properties of it or that this hath, yet doth it but little possesse of the selfe same vertues, which the auncient ascribe to their proper glasse. And this is named the glasse of the Philosophers, although (in very déede) it be no glasse but rather a certaine naturall Sugar, and that swéete, &amp; cleare or to be séene through like Christall, and colde, as the yse, coniealed. The preparation of this Antimonie, is not the selfe same, or a like framed with all persons, by which reason it doth not cause nor worke a like effect. That if we could attaine, and purchase a trewe and sure preparation of this Antimonie, it were a singuler treasure wonne.
               Of the vse of the Antimonie, as he hath experienced, for on such wise Gesnerus writeth The Antimonie prepared (as Matthiolus instructeth) I gaue in the yéere 1563. and in the .xxij. day of Ianuary, to a Melancholy person, sore vexed, which had often assayd to destroy himselfe, &amp; a fleshie young man, fiue graynes almost in pouder, mixed with a litle conserue of Roses &amp; wine, framed in a bale or dose (yt lay before on bed for thrée or foure dayes, without eating in a manner any meate, &amp; could scarcely lift vp his head, but with a certaine turning about, &amp; imagined that he sawe deuills, through which he came sorowfull &amp; fearefull, &amp; with sighes calling on God) within an howre after, yt a fat brothe was giuen him, he strōgly vomited &amp; within a whiles after, he made sundry sieges or stooles togither, yet felt he after a mighty

                  king in him, &amp; he became after marueilous thirstie &amp; drye, to the qualifying of which, he had drunke ouer much water with wine) he refrained besides supper, &amp; slept nothing, but lay groning and sighing al the night, &amp; vomited againe the morrow following, to the staying of which I gaue him Rob de Ribes with the syrupe of Quinces, &amp; the syrupe of Roses, with wyne and water warmed

togyther, and cordiall matters I applyed on the breast. The next day following was giuen to him brothe, whether he would or no, after which he slept almost an howre, and he began then to waxe better. Neuerthelesse I applyed to the foreheade, a linnen clothe wet in the water of Roses, Lettuce, the oyle of Roses, &amp; vineger, which I cōmanded a good whyles before to be done, but they had neglected it. And I minded to haue ministred to him of the oyle of vitriol, if he had not amended or recouered somwhat, &amp; perhaps ye conserue or syrupe of Nymphea, I had giuen. The same night, I willed to be giuē him a litle quantitie of new Triacle after myd night, if the vomiting ceassed not, or yt he slept not, but they gaue him to litle a quantitie of it. Here note, yt I onely licking my fingers, whiles I mixed ye medicine, within two howres after, felt an aking; &amp; swimming or giddinesse of the head, &amp; cast much water &amp; spittell of my stomack, with a litle gryping &amp; paine in ye bottome of my belly, especially of the right syde, and prouoking my selfe to vomite, I dranck after of the syrupe of wormewood warmed, &amp; amended. The same Antimonie was cleare, &amp; of a yelow colour, &amp; to be séene through as a precious stone, or Glasse, &amp; lightly broken betweene the teeth. In the Hospitall of Tygurie in Germanie, to a certaine other person madde, Gesnerus gaue of ye 
                  Stibium prepared, and cleare as glasse, &amp; nothing of the fumyng matter in it, sixe graines in fine pouder, &amp; when he was about to vomite, he (vpon the eating of breade) sent the matter down ward so that he felt but a little paine in the belly, yet this after wrought and caused, fowre sieges or stooles. But the nexte day after he sayde and complayned, that hys heade marueylously grieued hym. Gesnerus also gaue to a dropsye person, sixe graynes of the Stibium prepared, darcke and fumyng a lyttle, which after was grieuously vexed about the hearte, the payne contynewing vnto the nexte morrowe, and he purged vpward, and downeward, but little in quantitie.
               A certaine notable, &amp; singuler preparer of the Antimonie wrote vnto Gesnerus, yt he had giue, more thē to foure hundreth persons of euery kind and age, this his Antimonie, not only without any harme, but with prosperous successe. He gaue of this to fiue takē with the pestilent Ague, who after recouered to health. He also affyrmeth it to be a present remedy▪ in the Plague, but who that

mindeth to receiue of ye 
                  Antimonie, may neither before, nor after the taking of it, blede by vaine. Of this his Antimonie he sent certaine partes, being of thrée sundry colours, differing one from the other, of which the same, that was of a red colour, be preferred before the others, in yt the same tarried a longer time in the fire, that it might attaine the colour, and so the vertue breathed forth. But for that it is a deeper red to fire, for yt cause must a greater dose or quantitie be ministred. The same person gaue of the red Antimonie, to a certaine man strong of body, fiue graines, but to such which were meane of strength, and to women, he ministred only fowre graines. And to the persons weake of body, only thrée graines. But if any shalbe of a mightie strong complexion, thē to him may sixe graines be safely applyed, but he thinketh not good to minister aboue this dose, where necessitie requireth, it may be ministred at any time of the day, yea at midnight if neede shalbe, so that it be receaued fiue or sixe howres after meate, &amp; before or rather after the taking, to fast two or thrée howres. But where necessitie doth not so vrge or require, the aptest time in giuing of it, shalbe in the morning, an howre before the sunne rising. I minister (saith he) this Antimonie against al Agues, the dropsie, the Iaundise, the bloody scouring, the Melancholy of womē, rewmes the paines of the head, ye french disease singularly, a costiue belly, the flewme &amp; fulnesse of the breast &amp; stomacke, a stincking breath procéeding of the corruption of the stomacke, poysons, fransynesse &amp; many other diseases, these hetherto be his. Against the falling sicknesse, take of the pouder of Antimonie, of Dragons blood, of Castorie, of each two drams, these brought to pouder and mixed, minister after Arte, this also put vnder the tongue of a chylde, if néede requireth.
               
                  Gesnerus also hath thus noted, by the iudgement and opinion of others, of the maner of vsing of the same. The dose of Stimmeos or Stibium to be prepared &amp; giuen to the strong persons, must be in waight either fiue or sixe graines, but to persons weake of strenght, only thrée or foure graines, mixed with Sugar Roset, or Violets. To childrē being foure, fiue, or sixe yéeres olde, giue but one graine waight &amp; a halfe, in the Rob or syrupe of Walwooort or elder flowers. To slender old women, one graine, with milke. For this worketh within an howre, or halfe an howre, after the

taking. This also may be ministred (as some report) to womē with Chyld, without peryll or harme (which I marueylously doubt.)
               They which mynd to receiue the Antimonie prepared, let them take it with a fasting stomack, not eating any meat after, for seuen or eyght howers: but within a whyles after the taking, let the person drincke a lytle quantity warme, of the broth of C
                        •
                     cerum. And kéepe within the house, for two dayes space, &amp; moderately drinck yt tyme. Some vse of the Stibium being onely most finely brought to powder and calcyned, with ashes or Lyme in the same maner, but it rather seemeth safer, that it be sundry tymes molten afore.
               This helpeth sicknesses, and first the pestilence, and those also which be infected with it, soone after the same is ministred: it is giuen besydes to purge, for the preseruatiun of health. It is also a singular medicine, against poisons drunck. It secondarily helpeth thē, which be cōtinually vexed with headach. It thirdly staieth rewms, falling to the Lungs. It fowrthly, helpeth the grieffes, &amp; paines of the stomacke, &amp; weakenesse of the same. It doth fiftly remedy, the dropsie. This sixtly, helpeth the hard fetching of breath, and ha

                  dnesse to breath. This seuenthly, doth cure, the particular palsie. And eyghtly, this helpeth ye falling sicknesse. Nynthly, this cureth quartaine Agues. The tenth is, that the same remedieth yt Melancholy, the franticke, and madde persons. The eleuenth, whose bodies doe inclyne to a kynd of Leprie, &amp; be affected with a fowle scabbe. Many prepare and make pylles of Stibium, after this maner. Take of Aloes halfe an ounce, of Cynamon halfe a dram, of Cloues halfe a scruple, of Masticke halfe a dram, these artly myxed, make a masse of the whole with Rosewater. Take of this masse, vnto the quantitie of thrée Tares, to which myxe thrée graynes of the Stibium prepared, and with Rosewater or wyne, frame to the forme of a pyll, which minister in two or three pylles.
               A certayne secrete of a skylfull practisioner, in the cure of that piece of fleshe aboue in the nose causing a stincke, with Antimonie prepared. Take of the powder of the Antimonie prepared, after make a tent, which annoynt with an oyntment seruing to the purpose, the same then rolle in the sayd powder, &amp; put vp to the flesh in the nose: for this speedily cureth, &amp; it is experienced many tymes. After the vse or taking of Antimonie, vnto the comforting of the stomacke, certayne are woont to gyue, these medicines folowing.

Take of the pleasant spiced wine, named Hypacras, two parts, of the Inlep folowing, one part: in these mixed togither, dyp a toast of white bread, on which after straw of the powder of the electuary of the three Sāders, &amp; so much of ye pouders of the mynt &amp; worm wood. The Inlep, is on this wise: take three parts of ye 
                  Aqua vitae drawn through a parchment skyn wet with the oyle of Annise séedes, or with some other swéete smelling oyle, &amp; the same distylled by the vapour only of Balneo Mariae, &amp; of Rosewater two parts. In the Aqua vitae let a few cloues be infused for a night, which mixed togyther, adde to sugar, so much as shall suffice. The French men are woont to giue some Cawdell, or broath, after the taking of the Antimony, when the person féeleth him selfe prouoked to vomyt, that he may the easilyer vomyt. This gathered out of the letters, of a certayne notable phisition, vnto the singular Gesnerus.
               
               A certaine Empericke affyrmeth, that it may at all tymes or alwayes be safely giuen to the sick of the quartaine: &amp; he also vttreth certayne proper experiments of the same. For he gaue of the same, to a certayne dropsie person, &amp; had good successe. Yet he affyrmeth, that this pacient at the first, was in great danger. Of whom when we requyred to know the cause of this, he answered, that he could not purchase the Antimony, sufficiently prepared.
               To conclude, a certayne practisioner affyrmeth, that the Antimonie is and may safely be taken: for this kynd of medicine (as he alledgeth) hath the same property of nature, that it rayseth or sendeth away no benigne and profitable humour in the body, but expelleth only the noyouse: &amp; the same eyther by sweate, which where it appeareth, occasion is then mooued, eyther by vomyt, or by stoole.
               Certayne do marueylously extol the vse of Antimony, &amp; suppose it to passe or excel al other remedies, in thē which be infected with the pestilence: but I (sayth a most singular man) in his letters vnto ye learned Gesnerus, which haue the Antimony as well prepared, as they haue, know much harme done to many in ye giuing of it. For in ye taking of it, it greuously afflicteth or tormēteth the hart, which is especially caused &amp; wrought in pestilent Agues, this is certaine.
               Of the vse of Antimony, a certayne other learned man thus writeth vnto D. Gesnerus: it answereth in all, as gold to lyfe, both in the preparation &amp; vse. The Antimony in the vse, but not in the preparation, that it expresseth or resembleth not the Iacint, it manifesseth.

I nowe haue first prepared it, and in the preparation of the same, certayne, haue tryed it, as a perfite matter. So that in theyr report of practise, and proper preparatiō trusting, gaue thrée graynes of it to a certayne person, who within two howers and a halfe after, vomyted sixe tymes, and went thrée tymes to the stoole, procuring nor leauing after it any harme.
               Of the Antimony prepared, &amp; his vse, another certayne learned thus wryteth vnto D. Gesnerus. I here send to you but a smal péece of Stibium prepared, as the learned Matthiolus vpon Dioscorides instructeth, of which he vttereth a nūber of notable vertues, that if those were certayne &amp; true, who I beséeche you were happyer than I: which may by this medicine rydde or deliuer my self, from that my continual, &amp; cruel sicknesse, as he reporteth there a story of a certayne person incombred with much windinesse of body, like cured. But I haue vsed the powder of this (vnto this day) &amp; gyuen it more then to twenty persons, hauing sundry diseases: in all which, this first procured vomyting, and after sundry great sieges or stooles, &amp; those without griefe in the body after remayning, as Matthiolus in the same place affyrmeth. And although certayne, of thē became after better, yet were none wholy cleared of theyr sicknesse. For which cause, whether the same perhaps may often be ministred, I now doubt. But our noble persons much alow &amp; commend it, seing it taken in so smal a quantity, doth so singularly &amp; throughly purge corrupt humours. I am woont (sayth he) to myxe this poyson, with most pleasant conserues, and iuyces: in such maner, that without any procurement to vomyt, they may the wyllinger and lightlyer swallow downe the same. I my selfe (sayth he) haue synce vsed or taken of it, to the quātity of two graynes, where I otherwise gaue thrée graynes, and for truth, without any griefe in a maner: and I fyrst vomyted aboue half a pynt of greene choller, with most tough flewme: after I made nyne sufficient stooles, but the sicknesse nothing abated of these, but I rather after a few daies became worser (so yt I customably affected with the Melācholy disease in my flāk) was cōstrained, to cease frō taking any purging medicine, whether they shal be vehementer or gentler, &amp;c. That if any be apter or easier to vomit vpward, &amp; harder to purge downward, or at ye least indifferēt, to this person may you safely minister two or thrée grayns waight of this Stibiū. But to thē which hardly &amp; painfully vomit, &amp; haue a loose belly, or be of a slender &amp; weake nature, this ministred,

is not without peryll. The same which hytherto I haue studiously obserued: haue I in my letters, faythfull wrytten to you.
               Againe another certaine Phisition, wryteth vnto D. Gesnerus, of ye vse of Antimony prepared. I send here to you Antimony, as you requyred the same of mée, prepared by the fyre, &amp; brought to powder, &amp; in that I would not purchase now the whole to send you. I for that cause send you two sortes: the one which declineth vnto a blacknesse, is the self same, that here with vs was often ministred to many. Of the vse of this, I can report yt the same neuer harmed: but I suppose there is another, far better &amp; worthyer. They which vse the same, doe giue of it in the forme of pyls, making an incorporatiō with an apt syrupe. They giue these pyls a lytle before meat, yt the meate may so insew sone after the taking of the medicine, for by such meanes they affirme them to be reteyned, &amp; the working of this to be then strong. But they be many tymes cast vp againe, before theyr proper working, if a longer space or time be deferred, betwéene the taking of the medicine, and the meate orderly dressed.

great report, vsed the same in the french vlcers, and of the yard, for although this in the beginning byteh somewhat, yet doth it after take away the payne and vlcer. The heate of it is qualified, with the whyte of an egge beaten, and squirted in and vpon, or with the oyntment of Ceruse applyed vpon or butter often washed. This cureth also the wicked vlcers of the Gumes or Iawes, and mouth in Chyldren, vnto Canckers, and wartes (whych I in my selfe prosperously haue tryed) and other desperate diseases. This oyle of Brymstone is applyed into the Fistulaes of the fundament and Buttocke, and other members of the body, with a syring or squyrte and the heate, if any such be, is after qualifyed, as aboue taught, and it fylleth Fistulaes by the helpe of the whyte Ellebore, &amp; this experienced.

                  Matthiolus hath also a discription of the oyle of Brimstone, in a maner like to this, sauing that there is a certaine difference of the vessels. Let a large mouthed glasse hauing a long taile retching out (like to yt lampe hanging in a Church) be set into sand or Ashes in a bo

A man must in the meane time whiles ye Brimstone burneth poure on new pouder by litle &amp; litle with a spone, &amp; the plate (whose neather part draweth vnto the bignesse &amp; forme of the ioynt of the thomb) lay in burning hot, &amp; poure alwaies new brimstone in vntil

                  Isabella Cortesa vttereth an apte maner, of the making of the oyle of Brimstone: take of cytryne Brymstone a certayn quātity, which bring into fine pouder, ye same then powre into an earthen pot neyled, lyke to that which the Pottecarie putteth his oyntment into, this set vpryght, fylling it in a maner full, or neare to▪ After hang ouer a Bell of glasse, lyke to the forme of a Lampe, as you see here figured. This done, set the vessell on an earthen platter glased, into which then put an yron plate redde hote, on the sayd brimstone, and forthwith hang ouer the sayd Bell: in such maner, that it toucheth not the mouth of the vessell standing vnder, whereby the oyle may so distyll round about, and fall into the platter▪ For the sayd brymstone doth then make a sufficient smoke al about the Bell, through which is caused, that the oyle distylleth downe, &amp; into the platte
                     •
                  . If so be you hang the Bell in such order, that it

                   couereth the mouth of the vessell, and be the breadth of a knyfe haft distaunt from it, &amp; the vessell standing in a large platter very fayre within, that the oyle may fall into it, which ordered on such wyse, let so remayne, vntyll all the Brymstone be burned in the vessell. After shyft the oyle into a glasse, which kéepe to your vse.
               The Brimstone (as a certaine practisioner reporteth) doth not dystyll by a glasse, hanged on hygh, but cleaueth &amp; sticketh to the 
                     •••
                  es of the glasse. For that cause, let a lytle Aqua vitae be powred into the glasse, so much, as wyl only wet all the sydes of the glasse round about, in rolling the Aqua vitae to all the sydes &amp; parts of the glasse round about. After let the whole glasse be

set into a colde &amp; moyst place for certayne dayes, vntyll all the matter so setled in the bottome, and distylled by a glasse Lymbecke. Or if the whole matter be cleare, powre it then into another long necked cleare glasse, and let it be seperated, that the oyles may so be seperated.
               Another maner out of Sulphure vyue, which a certayne Phisition vttered to the Aucthour: fyrst the brymstone ought to be a lytle calcyned, but warely that it be not burned, or set on fyre, in such maner that it may almost be brought into powder. After distyl the same by ascention, for it then easily ascendeth. But he affyrmed, that hard it is, to prepare this oyle: nor that he could well discribe the maner of the same, but that a present sight in the doing is rerequyred. Vnto D. Gesnerus from a certayne place, was a small piece of brimstone sublimed sent, out of which an oyle was drawn: which is the lyke astringent, as the oyle of vitryoll, &amp; is rather of a watery substaunce, than oylie, which I marueyle at. This borrowed out of a certayne Epistle, vnto Doctour Gesnerus.
               
               Agayne vnto D. Gesnerus, wrote an old friend, and learned man, thus of the oyle of brymstone. Let the brymstone not yet tryed on the fyre, be kyndled in an earthen pan, and on the pan standing on a Treuet, hang a head, as some name it, or a Bell (being of glasse) and pargeted with lute: that it may receyue the fume of the brimstone, which within it is thyckned into an oyle, and by the pype or Nose of the Bell stylleth forth into a Receauer standing vnder, which so gathereth the oyle distylling.
               Another way: certayne doe make it, after another maner: vnto one part of the powder of Brymstone, they adde another part of flynt stones lyke brought to powder: this myxture powre into a Retort, and set ouer a very soft fyre, they so drawe a singuler oyle. Which oile in what maner diseases it may be vsed, and with what it may be gyuen in eache, and in what quantitie and howe, shall brief

Bowelles, and ioyntes: to those also which procéede, of the abundance of humour, or of putrifying.
               And a lytle of this oyle is ministred, with a distilled lycour, or decoction of a congruent hearbe, according to the qualitye of euery part and disease.

In the vlcers &amp; sores of the mouth, a feather or fine bombasie wette in the oyle, and the same softlye apply on the vlcered place, for in the repeating sundry tymes, this oyle doth so throughly heale the euyll. And druncke of such as are molested with falling sicknesse, in the decoction of Byttonie and Pyonie, speedily helpeth. To such vered with the cough, with Nettle séede and Ysope boyled in wyne. In the abundaunce of flewme, with the water of wormewood. In the payne of the stomacke, and great gutte of winde, with the water of Camomyll. In the coldnesse of the Lyuer and dropsie, with the water of Ireos, Celondyne, and Hony. In the stoppings and griefe of the Mylt, with Aquatamaricis. In yt French disease, with

In the staying backe of vryne, with wine of the decoction of garlike. Vnto the cold gowte, with the water of Chamaepytyos. And in al these, the like maner must be vsed, as afore was vttered, of the quyll or feather dypped in the oyle, and forth with tempered in an apte lycour. But in wounds and vlcers, the affected place must be annoynted with the oyle, and that gentlye with a feather. The tooth that aketh, must be dressed with the same softly.

and borrowed out of a written booke in the Italian tongue. An oile of brymstone, is easily and soone prepared, &amp; gotten with a Bell of glasse: but the better, &amp; perfiter maner, is this. Let the brymstone be finely brought to powder, and so much of the Pumeyse stone in fine powder, which two myxed togyther &amp; put into a Retort, fasten to it a sufficient large and bygge Receauer, and within two dayes space, by a most soft fire,

These truly, and al the others afore wrytten, which are to be applyed here: are reported, to be all experiēced, by a singular phisitiō of the Emperors at Bononie, &amp; of another notable phision at Rome.

Let the Brymstone be grosely brought to powder, which put into an earthen vessell, ouer which hang a head or Bell with a Nose, being two or three fingers distant from the vessell, and to the Nose set a Receauer, in which let a lyttle of pure Muske dyssolued in Rosewater be put.

Fyrst the same expelleth all maner of inward impostumes of the body, vnto the vpper face of it: if of the same be taken for three or fowre dayes▪ euery morning fasting one dram (consider that the same quantity, it be ouer much for one tyme) with broth, or wyne, or any such lycour. This auayleth in the harde fetching of breath, helpeth the cough, the rewme, the euyll dispositions of the Lyuer, any maner of scabbe, and cureth especially the pestilence. It is a treasure also, to vlcers and wounds.
               Another maner: let some yron vessell be taken which may be sealed with a Lymbecke, sixe fingers or a lytle more

same in the neather part downeward by two fyngers, let it haue a large hole of thrée fyngers broade, by which let the Brimstone be powred in, on this vessell set a Limbeck pergeted about with lute, after by the hole a low let the Brimstone be kindled, and burne so long as you thinke needefull, and a lycour will after distill &amp; yssew forth droppe by droppe. And this maner although it be tedious, yet is it not to be contemned.
               An oyle of Brimstone also is made by descention vnto the Chymistick workes, in this maner. Let one part of the Cytrine Brimstone brought to pouder, and put into an earthen vessel, be molten with a soft fire, to which mixe so much of Roche Alome melted the like at the fire. After grinde both togither, putting the whole into a discentorie standing vnder the earth set into an apt pitte made for the only purpose, on which ceales burning layd, &amp; the same which shall thē be gathered, kéepe to your vse, this out of Diod Euchyont.

The same oyle bury againe in horse dung for eight dayes, which after distill by a Limbecke▪ and in the ende let it be buried for a moneth, for on such wise shall the oyle of Brimstone be purifyed. And it is of great vertue, yet but three droppes giuen at a time. This dung also of the horse, must alwayes be renewed.
               An oyle of Naphtae, that is, of Brimstone vncombystible or neuer burned, which is of the spirites vnseperated, and clarifyed, is prepared and made after this manner, take of the Naphtae, that is, of any cytrine Brimstone, one part, of salt Armoniacke fiue partes, these two beate, &amp; mixe togither. After adde to them of the commō oyle a little, which then temper togither after the forme of paste, or of a thicke sauce. These then put into a Cucurbite, &amp; a humour after wil distil with a soft fire, of great vertue vnto many matters. But to the first distillation ended, adde of common salt fiue partes, of vnsleaked lyme fiue partes, then a paste made of these distill againe,

&amp; thus do for fowre times, and at euery time prooue with a candell or otherwise, vntil it burneth not. For with such an oyle of Naphtae, is Mercurie sublimed, and Arsenicke sublimed purifyed, and made cleare, auailing vehemently vnto the white worke.
               An oile of Brimstone without distillatiō, against the paine of the goute, prepared &amp; made after this maner, borrowed out of a writtē booke. Take of sulphure viue, two poūds, of the yolks of egges .xxv. in nūber, these beaten &amp; labored togither, put into an yron possenet, boyling these with a soft fire, and when the substance beginneth to burne, leane the yron pan on the one side, and the same which is lyquid, will then yssew forth, &amp; you shall so purchase, that you desire.
               An Oyle of Sulphure or Brimstone, without distillation, doth Brassanolus thus prepare, take of Cytrine Brimstone, &amp; of Turpē
                  tine, of eche three oūces, of good wine thrée ounces, of oyle of Roses one pynt, boyle these togither with a soft fire vnto the consumption of the wine, what that after remaineth, is the oyle of Brimstone.
               Otherwise and that sooner, is on this wyse prepared, take a strong lye, or the lycour made of vnquenched lime stieped in it, that will well beare an egge aboue. In this strong lye, let the Brymstone boyle so long, vntill a fatnesse shall appeare on the vpper face of the lye, and that the Feces shall fall to the bottome, then as it were by a skymming of, is this fatnesse gathered.
               Or let the Brymstone brought to fyne pouder, and powred into hote water, boyle so long, vntill the earthly parte be setled, and that the Oylie swymmeth aboue on the face of the water, whych practise was reported to me to be done, whiles I was in Venice.
               Or take of the oyle of Lyne seede two partes, into which put one part of Sulphure viue, these after the diligent mixing togither, burie in dung for two dayes, in a vessel close stopped, and it will be cleare and fayre.

And it is also at this day much exercysed and vsed of many Phisitions in sundry purposes, for which cause, as a most rare and singuler secrete, kepte wyth them couered and vnknowen. And this is none other, than an Alome qualitie and substaunce, drawne out of the Vytrioll by Arte, and a lyttle myxed with Brymstone. For the same Vytrioll of what manner it is made, doth appeare to consiste of a triple myxture, as of much Alome, some ruste, and a lyttle Brymstone. For the Alome water in Mettalles, distylling by the Copper vaynes and Marchasite, attayneth a rus

                  ie or cankred qualitye, and a Brimstonye, whych resteth myxed to the Marchasite, that by lyttle and lyttle gathereth, or by industrie is boyled vnto a thicknesse. But in the distylling, the Alommie and Sulphurie vapour onely doe ascende, and the rustie qualitie (by that meanes) left behinde in the bottome of the Retorte, through which is caused, that this oyle hath of Alome, and not the taste of Ruste in it. And there are two diuersities of this oyle, as a sharpe and swéete. The eager or sharpe Oyle consisteth of a double myxture, that is, of much Alome, and a lyttle Brymstone. But the swéete, doth simply consiste of Brymstone. In that it is none other, then a lyquid Brimstone, drawen out of the eager Oyle. For which cause not the Alome in taste at all, but the Brymstone is perceyued. And both is to be prepared and made with great care and diligence, in formyng an apt Furnace, and applying of a Retorte, and receauer agréeable, for the aptnesse of the Instrumentes (as certayn

For that cause I suppose (sayth he) that this oyle of the auncientes was prepared in another manner, and was much subtiller ▪ without corroding, and distilled in Balneo Mariae. But for so much as this maner in vnknowen, therefore the later practisioners from time to time inuented, diuerse and sundry preparations. Nor am I ignoraunt (sayth he) how neere vnto the perfection of these, the preparations agree, as that the pure &amp; hurtfull, may be seperated from the vnpure &amp; vnhurtful, the subtill and penetrable, from the grosse and immouable. For in what manner soeuer any matter, may be made subtiller, clearer &amp; more penetrating, of these, doth it declare the greater vertues in action. In that the Feces of the simple elements, hinder the actions. And for that cause doe the auncient Philosophers, make mention of the reduction vnto the first matter, vnto which when it shall come, the matter attaineth an extreeme subtilnesse, and the greatest also it yeeldeth in the practiue worke. So that you neede not to deubt, but such an oyle of Vitrioll, which shal attaine the extreeme subtilnesse in preparation, may in his actions to come, be not onely most perfite, but also nothing at all hurtfull, by which reason, if the practysioners in the preparations, shalbe eyther negligenter or slacker, through this may it be caused the more venimous, to the taking within the body. For how much the lesser the practysioner may erre or doth erre in the preparatiō, and distillation of the same, or howe the oyle may be made perfitter, these three hereafter are diligently to be considered before all others. First, what maner of Vitrioll must or ought to be chosen, then how the same may be boyled, and what manner of calcination vsed. For it séemeth, that the same rule or order, which was afore vttred and taught in the preparation of Antimonie, may like be applied in the oyle of vitrioll. And the Antimonie (as they say) except it be diligently chosen, and very well calcyned after art, they in no wyse graunt, that the same rightly and without daunger may be ministred, for which cause they will it carefully to be prepared, that the venimous qualitie may so be auoyded.
            
            
               THe true choosing of Vitrioll out of Valerius Cordus. The .xxx▪ Chapter.
               SEing there be many kindes of Vitrioll, for this reason, must it fully and perfitely be vttered, what maner and kinde of Vitriol,

best answereth &amp; agréeth to this worke. And although out of euery maner and kind of Vitrioll, an oyle by distillation may be drawē, yet a more yéelde of oyle, and the same worthier or more excellent then the others, is distilled out of the blew or gréene Vitriol, in that this contayneth much of the fugitiue Brimstone, through which it is much holpen, that the oyle may the easier &amp; lightlyer ascende. It is also to be noted, that the growē Vitrioll, and especially the Hungarian, to be better and rather chosen, then the made or counterfaited. The same besides is rather to be chosē, which cleaueth in great clusters, &amp; is coniealed in greater lumpes. For that the small broken Vitrioll, and in a maner to pouder, must be reiected as vnprofitable in this case, euen as that also, which gathered through the iniurie of the sunne, or aire, a whitnesse, &amp; dustie hoorinesse. But the learned Fallopio, and singuler practisioner Leonard Fiorauant, doe rather commend and preferre the Romaine, then the Germaine Vitriol, to this vse, seing the same containeth somwhat of the yron in it.

For if in the potte appeareth after the manner of quicksyluer, or molten leade, and that it casteth or sendeth forth leapyng bubbles, you may then conceyue that the Vitrioll is sufficiently burned. Then powre it into the great and new potte afore heated, and it will run forth as it were lyquid, or vnto the maner of quicksyluer. And what that remaineth of the Vitrioll, burne in like maner orderly, that it may wholy be calcyned, when it shall thus be burned and colde, let it be mixed agayne very well in a morter, in such maner labouring and sturring of it, that you raise not vp the pouder or dust, which might offend the mouth, and nosethrelles. After you haue performed all these, and powring the Vitrioll into a Ballance, consider and know iustly the waight. For if it be syxe poundes, which is the half of the same▪ that you first began to seeth, yet remayning, then haue you well handled, and rightly done all things, that ought to be performed.

The seconde space or  hollownesse made, aboue the yron grate (for a resting) ought to be two foote hygh, and through the foresyde a square hole artly made, iuste by the grate, to put the coales in with a lyttle shouell. After by the myddle space, regardyng the Furnace in the selfe same myddle, let a fowre square yron barre be layde ouerthwarte, in bygnesse or thycknesse of a thombe, which may well beare the Retorte layde vpon.

               AFter you haue thus built &amp; prepared the Furnace, choose then a bigge Retort, &amp; that apt to the purpose, being of the Venice glasse made, if it be possible to be gotten, which diligently &amp; strongly lute about, into the same poure al the Vitrioll (as by example the sixe poundes afore prepared and calcyned) yet that a fourth parte of thē Retort remayne emptie, whereby the spirites may the easyer

And let the beake or necke of the Retorte retche wythout, and stoupe downe warde, and the hoole also through which the necke passeth, diligently stoppe with Lute. After take fyue Tyles, with which make a

This couer then spredde ouer with lute euerye where, sauing fowre holes lefte open, and that in eache corner one, for the fume or smoke to passe, beyng so large, that a thombe maye well passe in and out, in eache hole. After make fowre couers sufficient broade (for the holes) of stronge Lute, wyth which stoppe or couer the holes, as néede requireth. These beyng done, thrust the mouth within the necke of a great receauer set vnder, beyng lyke of Venice glasse, which howe greater the same shalbe, so much the fréelyer it will receaue the spyrites entred, but if the receauer bée small, then is it daungerous, least the plentie of spyrites stretched abroade, maye breake the glasse. Also powre into the receauer of very cléere water sixtéene ounces, in that the water soone receiueth the spirites vnto it, and prohibiteth or defendeth that the receauer be not broken, and let these bee diligently luted togither in ye ioynt taking carefull héede besydes, that nothing fall after into the receauer, seeing the oyle staineth it into a red colour. When you haue performed all these, let the lute dry for a night, and if any chops or cliftes do appéere, let those be pargeted ouer with lute, &amp; the same morning after make a gentle fyre in the beginning, of pure &amp; great coales, setting opē one of the holes aboue, by which the fume may passe, and let the fire within a whiles, be increased by litle and litle vnto euening, at which time the second hole must be opened. And marke then diligently, whether any spirites appéere, which yssew forth of the Retort, after ye forme of a white smoke, breathed into ye receiuer. In ye night folowing be marueilous carefull, that the fire slacke or abate not, but rather sharper, yet but a litle more increased, so that the fire after increased kéepe in that force: &amp; in the nexte daye open the thyrde hole, increasing still the fyre, vntill the necke

For which cause powre all the lycour which is in the receauer, into a Cucurbite of Venice glasse, setting on the head made of the like glasse, which diligently lute in the ioynt round about.

               An oyle of vitryoll, learned of that singular Georgius Haymberserus: take of common vitryoll so much as you wyll, out of which distyll a water by a Lymbecke, as you know: after take the Feces, or earth of the vitryoll out of the glasse, &amp; calcyne the same so much as is possible: then powre the water, which you distylled from it before, vpon the earth of the vitryoll calcyned, which after set into a drye wine Seller, and you shall attayne the true oyle of vitryoll.

But the earth of the vitriol calcined, ought a fore to be wel brought to powder, &amp; the water then powred vpon it. With this oyle, and vermylon, make as you knowe, vnto the coniealing of Mercurie. This first borrowed out of an olde Alchymy booke written.
               Another maner: that you may make the oyle of vitryoll, take of Romayne vitryoll finely brought to powder, twentye poundes, which dissolue by lytle and litle on coales in a pot or panne not glased, and after the vitryoll shall be molten, suffer it after so long to boyle, vntyll it be well dryed. Which done, let it be diligently brought to powder, and powred into an other vessel not glased, but well and close couered, that no fylth nor dust fall into it. After this a cleare and vehement fyre of coales made, aboue &amp; beneath it, that the vitryoll may become so redde as Vermylon: of this vitryoll brought and made so redde, take twelue poundes, which powre into a Retorte verye well luted: with his Receauer, lyke luted in the ioynt: and the fyrst day begynne with a soft fyre, but the seconde daye with a stronger fyre of coales onely, and the thyrde day, with a most strong fyre made of wood, shall you distyl the oyle of vitryol. It is here to be noted, that you must powre in a lytle Aqua vitae into the Receauer, that the spyrites of the vitryoll may be retayned in it. And after the distyllacion ended, the same ought to be euaporated forth, the Receauer being set on coales, for on such wyse is the styncking vapour eleuated, and when no more vapour shall appeare, or greeuously stincketh, then shall the oyle be left and remayne pure. The propertyes of this oyle, be in a maner innumerable. With the water of Tamaricis, it auayleth against the passions of the Splene. With the water of Radishe, or powder of the Tables of marble stone, it auayleth against the st
                     •

               Another maner of preparing the oyle of Vitryol, not much differing

from the former, &amp; good, that he purchased of a certaine friend, which affyrmed, that he knew a Chyrurgian, which with this only got his lyuing: translated out of a wrytten Copy, in the Germayne tongue. There be some (sayth he) which by force of the fyre draw an oyle of vitryol, out of ten or twelue pounds of the Romaine or Vngarian vitryoll, in a body well fensed with lute, or earthen pot vnglased, which they say to one syde stouping, in that Furnace: with the receauer annexed to it, &amp; dyligently luted in the ioynt. Others when they haue distylled it by ascention, doe seperate the flewme from the oyle, and powre agayne the same flewme on ye dead head, and distyll it in the like maner aboue vttered, &amp; the same they so often repeate, vntyl the vitryol shalbe wholy brought &amp; made vnprofitable, &amp; that no oyle at all remaineth or is contayned in it. And although the oiles drawne by these meanes, be profitable vnto many &amp; sundry diseases: yet I (sayth he) yt the oyle may be applyed within the body, or vsed in any other maner, doe, in ye preparation of it, proceede after this maner. I take also two new pottes vnglased, into one of yt which I powre the vitryol, &amp; set to the fire, that the vitrioll may melte. And the water may also be powred to ye same; although it be not so requisite &amp; necessary, and to be sturred togyther with a woodden spatle, &amp; on such wyse to be through dryed by the fyre. In this fyrst calcynation▪ is the vitryoll purged from his venemousnesse. Then I bring the vitryoll agayne into powder, and sy

In the morning after the setling, I take away, so nygh as I can, all the clearer and purer water resting aboue, but the troubled I distyll by fylter. On those Feces or groundes remayning after the distyllacion, I powre the scalding water agayne, and both sturre, &amp; seperate, as aboue vttered: and I the same so often repeate, vntyll the vitryoll hath no bytternesse contayned or remayning in it, or is agreeable to the water. This cleare Lye or water of the vitryoll, let it be boyled so long by the fyre, vntyll in the vessell the vitryoll be harde gathered togyther as a stone, and the water consumed.
               
                  Of the properties of the oyle of Vitrioll, doth one of D. Gesnerus friendes thus wryte: The principall vertue of this oyle, is (Montane also affirming the same) that it causeth men not to appeare aged a long tyme, and mo
                     •
                  t foule and corrupt teeth, this causeth fayre and strong, and the gummes also it procureth strong: if the téeth dayly are lightly rubbed with one or two drops of it: by which maner doing, a famous curtisan in Venice, preserued hir téeth from all filth and corruption, and maintained them steddie and fast many yeres: but Montane woulde not the oyle to be vsed vnto the remoouing of fittes, and curing of sicknesses, without the addition of other simples or myxtures to it: for he had alwayes a regarde vnto those matters which were temperater, &amp; surer in the giuing: these hitherto he: Ad morbum scorbunticum, a certaine person not without great rewarde vsed it prosperously.
               
                  Arnoldus of the vse of the oyle of Vitrioll: Take of the best Triacle, to which adde a fewe droppes of the oyle of Vitrioll, and let stande myxed togither vntill you will vse it: If any lieth grieuously sicke, and not vnto death, giue a French crowne weight of this myxture, but if the man be not ouer weake, then a little more: and drinck the whole meanly hote, with a little wyne fasting in the morning foure houres before meate: and if a lyttle shall happen to remayne in the bottome, the same rynsed wyth wyne, drincke in lyke maner: After this, the sicke well couered in be
                     •
                  , and wrapped about the heade, in such maner, that nothing of the whole bodye may appeare, sauing the mouth frée and vncouered: which done, let the pacient lye sweating, somuch as is possible for the space of foure houres, and sléepe in no wyse that tyme: The shéetes then chaunged, let the pacient yet abide in bedde for other thrée houres, not sweating, before he eateth any thing, then let him eate somewhat, and drincke good olde wyne after his meate.
               After this medicine giuen, the Phisition maye vse other medicines, as the purging and comforting: The nature of this medicine is to diminishe all sickenesses, and to prepare the waye vnto health, and the same with expedition, and in a short time: doe in that maner, that the pacient may obey and kéepe a good dyet: The cure consisteth, that the pacient sweate rightly and plentifully for the foresayde foure houres: for this drinck rightly ministred, neuer fayleth nor beguyleth the Phisition: If the pacient after the taking,

be not cured, yet doth he cast vp (by vomiting) much euill matter offending.
               In the Cholicke, Benedictus Victorius, thus vsed the oyle of Vitrioll: he tooke of Malmesie two drammes, of the oyle of Vitriol halfe a dramme: This is a marueylous experiment, if of the same, or the sayd quantitie be ministred at the instant time of the griefe, without an Ague: It also profiteth if the payned or grieued place be annointed with the oyle of Vitrioll, an apt playster or fomentation vsed before: An expert medicine of Alexis Pedemontanus, curing the swelling of the throte or Squince: Take of the oyle of the Romane Vitrioll, thrée droppes, which well myxed in wyne, gargill in the throte sundrie times: Two drops of the oyle mixed with Saxifrage water, and druncke, prouoke vryne: Against the euill vlcers of the legges, doth the water of Allum, myxed with a little of the oyle of Vitrioll auayle.
               Against Agues, take the Vitrioll calcined and brought to pouder, on which poure Aqua vitae, that it may excéede two fingers aboue, the same let so rest for thrée or foure days, after poure in other Aqua vitae, &amp; doe the lyke, then drawe forth the Aqua vitae, of which giue two or thrée drops in a sufficient or congruent quantitie of water: A certaine person reported, that a lynnen cloth wet in the oyle of Vitrioll, and applyed for sixe or seauen dayes on the forheade, doth helpe the grieuous payne of the heade: A potion made of the oyle of Vitrioll, with two drammes of Malmesie, doth deliuer the payne of the belly, and stomacke: So much of the oyle of Vitrioll dropped into faire water, as wil make the water sower, doth purge. A certayne practisioner cured with the same, the Collicke despayred or out of hope: and he gaue it in the fleumaticke Asthma, or straitnesse of breath, and in the perill of suffocation, for it hath profited with the vomiting: This gaue sometimes one dramme wyth good successe to all fleumaticke affectes, especially of the stomacke: For the taking away of wartes, this is a singular remedie: A certayne learned man supposed the oyle to helpe cornes in the féete, although the same not experienced.
               Our Oyle of Vitrioll is thus made: Take of the better Vitrioll such a quantitie as you shall thinke néedefull, the same dissolue in hote water, after let that water cleare againe, and dystill it by a filter, the same which is dystilled, poure into a Copper vessell, or vessell

not glased: after poure it agayne into another vessell of glasse, set betwéene coales, that the glasse may be through redde: after dissolue it agayne as afore, the same dystill by a filter, and fully drye, vntill it be through redde: then let it be brought to very fine pouder, and of the Vitrioll in pouder, poure one pounde or two pounds into a Cucurbite or glasse bodie, and before you poure the same in, poure into the glasse hafe a cuppe full of good Aqua vitae, wythout any fleume, after poure vpon the pouder of the Vitrioll, and set the mouth of one bodie against another, diligently luted in an apt furnace: beginning first with a soft fire, vntill white fumes shall appeare, after increase the fire, making a strong flame vnder it, and continuing the same vnto the ende of the worke: After take all that which shall be dystilled, and dystill the same in a Retort by sande: which gathered againe by dystillation, poure into the Retorte, and distil againe, &amp; the same so often repeate, vntil no feces shal remaine in the Retort, then dystill it in Balneo strong boyling, and the Quintessence and fleume shall after be separated, and a pure oyle shall abyde in the bottome of the glasse: that if you shall not finde it sufficient pure, poure it agayne by it selfe into a Retort, and distill it once agayne by sand, and you shall then purchase the oyle rectified, which diligently stoppe and kéepe, for it is precious.
               An ingenious preparation of the oyle of Vitrioll, prooued, and that perfite and sure, vttered by a singular practisioner, after thys maner, translated out of the Germaine tongue. Vnto the dystillation of the oyle, before any other matter, you must first build a furnace foure square, of the same largenesse, that in it may a great bodie luted, be easily placed or set, being of glasse, which wyll holde eyght or ten measures, and hauing a bygge and large belly: In the

beginning buylde the Furnace a foote, or thereabout, highe from grounde, after place a grate at that heygth, being about a foote &amp; a halfe distant: then by the middle of the furnace fixe a long &amp; strong yron barre, luted ouer with the best lute, and that it retcheth frō one side to the other of ye furnace: betwéene the grate and yron barre, place or ioyne the slowe harrie to the furnace, vnto one side, euen as this figure here ensuing,

doth playner demonstrate: and let the slowe harrie be of such a bygnesse, that the heade maye in a manner lye all without: which prepared and done, let the building o
                     •
                   the furnace be raysed or made a foote and a halfe aboue the yron barre, and left so open, vnto the tyme the glasse in which the Vitrioll shall be contayned, be set in the furnace. And note, that the same side from the slowe harrie, ought from the grate vnto the toppe to be open, vntill the glasse be set into the furnace: the furnace being prepared, take of Vitrioll thirtie or fortie poundes, according to the greatnesse and capacitie of the glasse, and the Vitrioll poure into an vnglased pot, which set on the fire, that it may be exactly calcined, and that no moysture, remayneth in it, and that also it be brought to a redde colour, or hardned as a stone: the earthen vessell then broken, and the Vitrioll thorowe cooled, let it be most finely brought to pouder in a morter, and that pouder poure into this great glasse, of which is aboue mentioned: This glasse thus filled with the Vitrioll, in the same part of the furnace which is open, let be layde along on the yron barre, the necke lying without, and turned downewarde so much as is possible, but in such man
                     •
                  r, that you shedde not out the Vitrioll, and let the necke also retch without the furnace, vnto the length of halfe a foote, wherby the receyuer may after be annexed to it, and the commodiouser fenced about the ioynt with lute: which done, close the open part of the furnace, from the grate vnto the very toppe, and the glasse diligently ioyne togither to the furnace with lute: when you shall thus come vnto the toppe, make in eche of the foure corners, a hole so large as the compasse of an egge, with an apt couer to eche, which may be set on, and taken away at pleasure: let vent holes also be framed, and those lesser, yet no wyder than that the thumbe may easily passe in and out: after worke the furnace vp narrower and narrower, into pinnacle forme, that in the toppe a hole may be left so wyde, a

                   you may well occupie the hand in and out, for which hole also srame a couer that maye couer it close, and be taken of at pleasure: after the furnace thus wholy framed and buylt, togither with the glasse bodie ioyned to it, and throughly perfourmed, you shall then annexe another great receyuer of glasse, that will well conteyne eyght or ten measures of licour, into the necke of this receyuer, let the oth

and custome: The figure hereafter folowing, doth manifestly vtter to the eye, this whole description of the furnace and vessels: where to be noted that the slowe harrie ought not so exactlye to touche the grate: but to be sufficient, if it ca

                  3 Doth expresse the slowe harrie, carying in the coales.
               
               
                  4 Dothe shewe the place, in which the yron barre is fixed, that beareth vp the glasse bodie.
               
                  5 Representeth the necke of the glasse bodie retching without, and turned downward.
               
                  6 Doth represent that great receyuer annexed t

                  8 Doth manifestlye shewe the large hole being in the toppe of the furnace.
               When all these are prepared, let the furnace be heated with a fire of coales, and the slowe harrie filled with great coales: and wyth a couer let it be close couered, and all the other vent holes, except the thrée small aboue mentioned. The doore also which is vnder the grate, and noted with the number one, must be halfe shutte, for the ayre sake, and to preserue the fire: In the beginning make a mean
                     •
                   fire, and after shall a cleare oyle dystill: when the cleare colour of the oyle shall beginne to appeare darker, and the oyle after a maner troubled, then shall the fire be fortified, and a redde matter will insue, which must be forced forwarde, in fortifying the fire a little more, and the same in such maner, as by a hole which consisteth in the toppe, that you may poure in the coales, and fill the furnace vp

with them vnto the vent holes, which ought to be opened, and none of them left couered: and this dystillation m

                  st be continued so long as any matter distilleth, which indureth vnto .xxiiij. houres, yea, somtimes to thirtie houres: so that this must be followed without anye staying, vntill all be gathered, for in this manner shall you obtaine the most perfite oyle of Vitrioll: and this maner, as a most certaine practise, sundrie tymes prooued by a certaine notable practisioner: Where to be noted, that the receyuer ought to be cooled, by another vessell filled with colde water, and hauing a tappe, that the cold water may continually dystill vpon the receauer, or set this into a filtring vessell, that the colde water may like dystill vpon it, and coole so the receyuer, which otherwyse by force of the excéeding heate woulde soone burst. After the dystillation fullye ended, and cooling both of the furnace and glasse, let the oyle be poured into a Retort, &amp; rectified in Balneo Mariae, from the firie or redde matter, of which eche must be kept seuerall in glasses. Another practisioner supposeth it to be more skilfully handled, that after the redde matter shall appeare in the dystillation, the receiuer be chaunged, least the true oyle by any meanes may be affected with a certaine straunge qualitie. The vse of this oyle is against all Agues: against the cholicke, and strangurie: against the stone, or sande of the bladder: It doth marueylously helpe the suffocation of the wombe, the Cough, the Apostume of the breast and lungs, the matter ascending, and as it were, suffocating the lungs. It cureth the dropsie of any cause, and preuaileth against the Goute, the Palsie▪ &amp;c. And they ought to giue or take at a time, two, three, or foure drops in some dystilled water or wine, morning and euening.
               
                  Leonard Fiorauant; that singular practisioner, in his seconde booke of secrete practises, published in the Italian tongue▪ doth there vtter the maner of dystilling the oyle of Vitriol▪ which from the common maner doth differ nothing at all, sauing that the dystillation of the oyle at the eyght or tenth daye was perfourmed: and from the beginning, as it séemed, wrought with flame of fire, and the oyle dystilled, was blacke.
               A compounde oyle of Vitrioll, of the sayd Leonard Fiorauant prepared and made after this maner: Take of pure and whyte Sugar foure pounds, of Rhaponticke one pounde, of Ruberbe one ounce, of

Mercurie flowers, one pound, these after the well beating togither, frame into a paste: on which poure foure pyntes of the best Aqua vitae, then poure all into a Retort, which diligently stoppe, and burie in hote horse dung for sixe dayes, after the drawing forth, dystill the whole in Balneo Mariae, vntil no more will issue forth. The feces then gotten forth of the Retort▪ put into a lynnen bagge, which wryng strongly and throughly in a presse: After take of Buglosse water, of Fumiterrie, and of Scabio

               Another of the same mans, otherwise prepared and drawne, named a compounde oyle of Vitrioll, and that most strong, on thys wyse: Take of Romaine Vitrioll sixe poundes, of salt Armoniack, of Brimstone, of Vermilion, of Orpiment, and of Roche Allum, of eche sixe ounces, let all be calcined (as we haue aboue vttered) vntil all the whole be come vnto a rednesse, and being thus rubified, let all be brought into fine pouder, and poured into a bodie (as aboue vttered) and let fire be continued vnder it for sixe whole dayes, remembring before that the ioyntes be diligently luted: With this licour may you depopulate or cut of any member, if you wette a large knyfe made of the woode of the Oliue trée in it, and marke the place about with tha sayde woode where you will cut it of: this then is of such a force and efficacie, that it openeth the fleshe, euen as the same were done or cut with a rasour, and worketh the proper effect, without the shedding of any drop of bloude: And this causticke is one of the worthyest secretes of all Chirurgerie, and proued very often of the singular Fallopius, and sundrie other Chirurgions, which haue wrought the selfe same effect, which I haue séene many times.
               A naturall and most subtill oyle of Vitrioll, pleasaunt or swéete in taste, which is accounted for a miracle: Take of the Hungarian vitrioll foure poundes, which brought into very fine pouder, and dryed in a bodie, poure after into another bodie well fenced with lute, being well beaten togither, and thrust downe: Then poure vppon of

sublymed wyne rectified, vnto the top of the foure poundes, which set to digest for fortie dayes, after dystill according to Arte: and you shall then sée the Oyle of Vitrioll swimme aboue the vpper part of the sublimed wyne: But the common oyle of Vitriol shall be mixed with his water, and for that cause néedeth rectifying: this borowed out a written booke.
               An oyle of Vitrioll which mortifieth the Canker and Fistulaes, and old corrosiue vlcers especially, is made after this maner: Take of Romaine Vitrioll, burnt in a panne vnto a rednesse, one pounde, which bring to fine pouder, to it after adde, of oyle Olyue halfe a pynte, these poure togither into a glasse body, and sublime after the common maner: then let it be distilled with one bodie set against another, or by a Limbecke, in adding to it a little of Aqua vitae well rectified, that the Oyle may ascende. &amp;c.
               
                  Fumanellus of the oyle of Vitrioll, against the Canker, thus writeth: In extreme diseases, the extreme remedies are best: and séeing the Canker is a disease of the same kynde, for that cause a man must apply extreme remedies to it, as is the oyle of Vitrioll which is made after this maner: Take of Vitrioll a sufficient quantitie, which after the through drying, and comming vnto a rednesse, and the same rubified, and brought to fine pouder, poure into a Limbecke, and dystill according to Arte: of this let be giuen in the first day fasting, one droppe, with thrée ounces of Buglosse water, and in the second day, two drops, with a greater quantitie of the water, and in such maner adding a drop of the water, vnto fiue dayes ende: These ended, let the extreme parts or edges of ye Canker be annoynted with the foresaid Oyle, vntill the matter of the canker be gotten out by the roote: and this medicine hath not bene tried of the Author, but obtayned of an Impericke.

               An oyle of Saturne or Leadé, is thus prepared and made, which is after an easie maner: Take of Ceruse which is Leade calcined, and boyle it with the strongest vinegar, after let the same settle or rest a time, and the vinegar shall become yelow of colour: the same then poure into a bodie, and euaporate the vinegar forth, and in the bottome will the oyle remayne: This oyle of Saturne is commended in olde vlcers, especially those (which Theophrastus nameth the vlcers of the face) of which kynde are, the Canker, and Fistulaes about the nose. I knewe (sayth the Authour) a woman who had hir nose almost eaten away with a wicked vlcer, &amp; was throughly cured with this oyle alone: This oyle molten, ought to be applyed with a warmenesse, or by the furnace in the Winter tyme, and striked ouer with a fether. A certaine person sold halfe an ounce of this for a crowne of gold. The dose of it at a time, to be giuen inward with any lycour, is thrée graynes: and vsed both in the cholicke, &amp; in fistulaes.

The experience of the oyle is, that the lamines of anye metall rubified, if they be quenched in this oyle, forthwith receyue the colour of golde: so marueylous is the tincture, and péercing, and doth also congeale Mercurie diuinely, and doth many other affectes in the Arte of Alchimie. Besides, in Phisicke, this worketh marueylously, in that the same resolueth and healeth many infirmities, and especially the fluxe of the bodie, if so be a small quantitie be giuen by the mouth with anye sirrupe, or other like composition, which worketh a marueylous

               THe oyle of Amber is none other than a most subtill, fat, &amp; ayreal substance which cōsisteth in the Amber, drawne out by Art: and although it be not harde to purchase such an oyle, yet a special care &amp; aptnesse of instruments is required vnto ye same art: for which cause must diligent héede be giuen that ye precepts following be obserued.
            
            
               What maner of Amber must be chosen. The .xli. Chapter.
               ALthoughe it be agreeable to Arte, and ryght necessarye to choose the purest Amber, vnto the dystilling and drawing

forth of the oyle, and that it be the greater part of the Amber, for in taking the purer matter, a purer lycour also issueth forth, and the receyuer shall be filled with the lesser quantitie of the excrementall humour and refuse, and it besides shall not so easily be resolued with fire, and at one instant fall togither into the receyuer, if it shall be of the grosser partes, but shall dissolue and melt by little and little, and slowly, that the subtill substance which consisteth or is in it, may the beter be separated from the feces: yet in the slaking of it, maye the pouder and péeces be taken and vsed, in that those also yéelde an Oyle, if they be rightly prepared and poured into the vessell. A man must besides obserue and knowe, that on the Amber poured into the Cucurbite, be very small flynt stones layde, and on them againe an other course of the Amber, and lyke an other bed of the flynt stones, and thus orderly to the ende.

               IT much auayleth to haue apt and fitte instrumentes: And first, as touching the Furnace, let it be round, and twoo foote and a halfe high, but in breadth ouer, about twoo spannes: And let it be buylt eyther of Tyles, or Iron plates couered ouer with strong lute, and hauing twoo rounde holes in it, by which (as shall after be demonstrated) the Pypes of the Instrument set in the seconde place, may retch forth.
               But let other twoo instruments of copper be prepared and made, and those couered or glased within, with tynne, especially the neather part, and let it haue the figure of a Cucurbite aboue, in heygth of one spanne and a halfe, compouned of one whole lamine or plate, and let the necke of it be thrust within the nether instrument, and enter a sufficient way within the same.

                   stricken, that the Amber couered with it, maye issue and dystill liquide forth: but the nether instrument receyuing the Amber (for that it is a Dystillation by descention) let the same be framed rounde, hauing a necke which may receyue, &amp; may contayne in it the necke of the Cucurbyte, and wyll well receyue thrée or foure measures of lycour, hauing twoo Pypes, of which let the one ascend and

looke vpward, and the other descende and retch downeward, as these figures herevnder, doth playner expresse to the eye.

               Of the Dystillation of the Amber. The .xliij. Chapter.
               AFter you haue prepared the Furnace, and all the Instruments necessarie to it: Take the nether instrument, which sette into the Furnace, doth drawe forth the pypes of it (that you sawe made in the former figure) and the same very well fence in the furnace with Tyles and Lute, and let there be a couer within made sufficient strong, that cannot be séene without, and that the fire lying on it cannot harme, and then poure so much water into it, vntill the water runneth forth of the Pype: After the Cucurbite filled by tourne with the Amber and flynt stones (layde by courses as afore taught) and fenced with lute, let not the Amber but rather

the course of flynt stones touche and be next the couer, and couer the Cucurbite, then nayle or fasten stronglye the lydde rounde about the edge or sides with Iron nayles, that the couer through the force and mightie power of the heate maye not fall of: but rather be able well to beare the weyght of the substance: Which done, set the Cucurbite on the nether instrument, and the place where they be ioyned togither, fence diligently about with lute, that no vapour at all may issue forth: and stoppe the Pype ascending with a woodden stoppell, that you maye drawe the same forth, if the hote water must be taken forth, which shall then be done, if a little shall so hynder in it, that the Oyle cannot issue forth: To the nether Pype fasten another Tynne pype, or Copper Pype, passing thorowe a vessell filled with colde water, which when it shall be hote, poure in other colde water. And to the ende of that Pype set a Receyuer, hauing in it one wyne pynte of pure colde water, sufficient great and able to contayne both the Oyle and water: And let the Receyuer be of Glasse, or earth, glased wythin, and not of Copper, in that it lightly draweth the oyle to a gréennesse through the Canker which consisteth in the Copper, and let all be marueylous well stopped: When all these shall be thus handled and done, about the Cucurbite, kyndle a gentle and soft fire of coales in the beginning, yéelding an equall heate leysurely out of all the parts, and increase the fire by little and little, vnto euening (for in one daye is the same Dystillation ended) vntill the whole Cucurbite be couered and hydde with burning coales. And this conceyue, that when the Cucurbyte is in a manner redde hote, then the Dystillation to be ended: so that then you maye withdrawe the fire, and let them stande all a night without fire, that they maye coole by themselues. After drawe forth the Cucurbite, and you shall finde it emptie of Amber, but the stones which yet remayne wythin blacke, couered as they were with soote: And in the bottome of the nether Instrument you shall discerne the Feces, or the refuse appearing lyke to Pitche, and the Oyle caryed through the Pype vnto the receyuer, swymming on the water, which both are to be reserued, vntill the oyle be rectified. And these hytherto maye suffice for the first dystillation.
            
            
               
               Of the Rectification. The .xliiij. Chapter.
               LEt vs nowe come vnto the seconde and last dystillation, which is wrought by ascension: and is the Rectifying of the oyle, that is, the separation of the pure from the vnpure, and perfourmed after this maner: Take a glasse Cucurbite, and poure into it the water with the oyle, that the belly of the same maye be filled vnto the necke, and set on in lyke maner a heade of glasse, which commit into Balneo, and you ought to gouerne all verye well, least the heate breaketh it, and poure into Balneo hote water. For the glasse thorowe hote, cannot endure the sodaine cooling, but cracketh or breaketh incontinent, which prepared to distill, set then to the nose of the Lymbecke a glasse receyuer, and an oyle will issue forth most pure, myxed with a little water: which also must be separated from the Oyle, by an instrument of glasse, after the instruction of Valerius Cordus, which maner he always vsed: or for lacke of the same, you maye vse the other instrument of glasse, much like to the Funnell: for this oyle euermore swimmeth aboue the water.
               And this dystillation may also be done by sande in the same manner, if so be you fence the bodie before with lute, that the heate break not the glasse, but the purer &amp; best cōmended, is that done by Balneo.

               THis Oyle in auncient tyme was named holye, for the marueylous and secrete vertues of it: for it hath the same properties,

which the Amber it selfe, but farre effectuouser. For what efficacie and vertue consisteth in fiue, sixe, or seauen poundes of the Amber, the same may be reduced eas
                     •
                  ly into one pounde: By which reason it much auayleth in the falling sicknesse, in the Palsie, and Crampe, and mightily helpeth women molested wyth the suffocation of the Matrice, it comforteth also the yongling in the mothers wombe.
               Of the Oyle of Amber, and the vertues of it, doth a certayne learned man thus write: it excéedeth by his propertie (sayth he) all waters of lyfe, as they name them, and any maner of Aurum potabile, or potable golde, especially in the curing of the Apoplexie, and falling sickenesse.
            
            
               Of the Oyle of Tylestones. The xlvi. Chapter.
               THe Oyle Benedick, or Oyle of Tyle stones, hauing in it manye vertues vnto colde griefes and diseases, and profitabler than a Baulme, by his vertue and subtilnesse, is prepared and drawne after this maner: Take of newe baked Tyles, that neuer water came vpon, such a quantitie as you thynke néedefull, those beate so small as Fetches, Hempe, Milium, or else the ponder most finely fifted: After let it be poured into a glasse bodie, or other bodie, &amp; mightily maintayned with fire, or strongly burned: which thus burned, poure into olde &amp; cléere oyle Olyue, if it may be gotten, being in an earthen vessell glased: and let it so rest to infuse for vij. or x. dayes, and if any péeces be grosse, beate those small, and poure the whole into a great Cucurbite, on which set a heade artely luted in the ioynt, and dystill with a soft fire: and this conceyue, that of one pounde of the Oyle, you shall gather but one ounce, whose naturall vertue excéedeth, and is greater in effect than the naturall Baulme, in the curing of all cold sicknesses &amp; griefs, &amp; is hoter than it: &amp; for that cause it is named oyle Benedick, or blessed oile, especially vnto ye curing of cold sicknesses, &amp; the older the oyle shall be before the occupying, ye better will it work.
               The true and certaine notes to knowe this Oyle assuredly, are these: that the oyle Oliue holdeth or beareth vp (as it were) thys

oyle in the myddle of it: or stayeth it hanging about the bottome, and not touching the bottome, whereof this sheweth it selfe to be hoter and lighter than the oyle Olyue: and the same also which is not Artely drawne of Tyles, i
                     •
                   heauye, so that if a drop be let fall into this purer oyle, it falleth to the bottome: and in this is the coldnesse and he auynesse of it knowne. Also this Oyle causeth or yéeldeth a strong sauour, and is redde in colour: and a drop of it besides poured in the hand, doth incontinent vanish away, &amp; spreadeth all the hande: and if an yron rodde be annoynted with the same Oyle, and touched of any fl
                     •
                  me, doth forthwith burne: and kindled or flaming, doth not easily go out, nor is lightly quenched. When the distillation of this Oyle shall be fully performed, open then the vessel wittily after it shall be through colde, &amp; draw forth the pouder of the Tyles resting in the bottome of the glasse, into which oyle after poure a quantitie of other pouder burned, if you mynde to purchase more of the Oyle, and dystill after the maner aboue taught: and the Oyle dystilled, kéepe well in a glasse close stopped with waxe.
               There are here vttered xliiij. vertues of the same, auayling in a colde cause, so well inward as outward. 1. First the Oyle restoreth all those members colde by any accident, if the harmed members be annoynted with it. 2. It healeth a wounde, if the proper herbe agréeable, be a little boyled in it. 3. This helpeth all ye clefts and chops happening on the handes and féete in the winter tyme. 4. The oyle helpeth sinewes weake through the Goute, or some other cause, and the trembling or shaking of the head and handes. 5. The Goute and ache of the ioyntes procéeding of a colde cause, the necke payning, &amp; so stiffe, that it cannot turne hither &amp; thither, is helpen with this oyle. 6. It breaketh into small péeces the stone of the bladder &amp; kidneys, by annoynting on the places, &amp; drinking often of the oyle with white wine. 7. It cureth also the excoriation of the bladder, so well within as without (which is knowne by the byting or fretting of the yard) by annointing on the proper place. 8. This helpeth the staying back of the vryne, and hardnesse in the making of water. 9. The oyle helpeth the passions of ye eares procéeding of a cold cause, as the deafenesse, the noyse or hissing, &amp; the fluxe of euill humors to the eares, by applying a fine lynnen cloth

wet in it wythin the eare. 10. This auayleth against the wormes eyther bred within, or crept in by hap. 11. This helpeth ye drawing of the mouth by a crampe: and the drawing or tormenting of the belly, &amp; the griefes of the matrice in euery age: to the helpe of the Sciaticke payne, or ache of the hip, &amp; paine of the kidneys &amp; ridge bone, may be added those herbes, flowers &amp; rootes of a hot nature, appropriated to them, as the Sage, the Penyroyall, the Wormewood, ye running Time, Organy, Betony, Hisop, &amp; Dittany. 12.

It helpeth all maner of coldnesse of ye head and brayne: for annoynted with the oyle, it doth heate, &amp; marueylously cōforteth. 17. This also annointed on the hinder part of the heade, doth helpe forgetfulnesse, &amp; 
                     •
                   weake memory. 18. It cureth the toothach, by rubbing or annoynting the gums with it. 19. The oyle drunke, helpeth the coldnesse of ye matrice, being also annointed both within and without, and the staying backe of the monthly termes. 20. It bringeth forth the deade yongling by opening the mouths of the veynes. 21. It auayleth or cureth the clotted bloud of a stripe, &amp; dryeth vp the euill humors of barren women. 22. The oyle helpeth a cold cough, &amp; stopping of the lungs, by drinking and annointing the brest with it, and it cureth a dry and weake cough, which is named the straytnesse of the brest, &amp; dissolueth there the congealed humors, &amp; openeth the pypes of the lunges: annoynted also on the watry eyes, cureth them, if the annoynting be done on the lids of the eyes. 23. The oyle cureth the swelling of the lids, the paine &amp; rednesse through the swelling, or the abundance of bleude caused in them. 24. It also cureth ye bit of any venimous beast, as

the Scorpion, the Spyder, the Waspe, ye Bee, the Snake, &amp; Adder, if the stinged or poisoned place be annoynted with it. 25. The oyle helpeth swounding and weakenesse of the heart &amp; stomacke, if of it be drunk with good wine. 26. The oile profiteth fishermen, if their nets be annoynted with it before they go to fishing, for it allureth and draweth fishes in with the only sauour. 27. It auaileth against the drinking of Opium, or Henban. 28. This helpeth the griefe and payne of the fundament, &amp; wormes: drunke and annoynted, especially if wormwood shall be admired with it. 29. It helpeth the spitting of bloud, &amp; pissing of bloud. 30. And whose bloud is congealed or clotted in the head, &amp; the cause is of an impostume ingendred, or of a strype, if the place be annoynted with it, this helpeth in short tyme, 31. The oyle also auaileth and helpeth the person broken, by annointing, and applying of it in plaister forme, with the iuyce of wormwood. 32. This auayleth against a hard &amp; drie scab of ye head, by annoynting the places with it. 33. This helpeth any Fistula. 34. The oyle helpeth the stone of the bladder and kidneyes, if the herbes agréeable vnto this, as the Saxifrage, Grummell séedes, Parsely séedes, Fennell séeds, &amp; Gotes bloud be mixed with it, and giuen to drinke. And blessed be the Lord God who of his excéeding liberality hath prouided so many sūdry helps, &amp; varieties of things to mans frailtie. 35. If in the oyle Benedick, you shall boyle long pepper, &amp; the graines of paradise, &amp; Pelitorie, of ech one dram, and halfe a dram of Castorie, &amp; with this shall annoint (the Edray) auayleth vnto coeating. 36. That a candell may not go out, neither with rayne nor the wynde: take a quantitie of silke or towe, &amp; wet the same in the oyle Benedick, &amp; with talow or waxe make a candle, which may burne in the water. 37. The dung also of the Doue myxed with the oyle Benedick, &amp; a drie stick annoynted with that mixture, &amp; layde for a space in the hote Sunne, will kindle &amp; burne of it selfe. 38. Take also of vnstaked Lyme &amp; Brimstone, of ech a lyke quantitie, these temper or myxe with the oyle Benedick, and forme pylles of the whole, which throwe into a pot of water, and fire will issue forth of the water. That a thread may put out a candell burning, wynde it then about the candell: but annoynt it before with good Triacle, and it will put the light forth.

               The first Chapter.
               
                  THe water which is dystilled out of wyne, or the lyes of the same, is named of some the water of lyfe, in that it recouereth and maintayneth lyfe, yea, and stayeth olde age. But this may righter be named the water of death, if it shall not be rightly and Artly prepared: insomuch that such a water causeth more harme than commoditie, as the Authour of Pyrotechnia vttereth. But of some named burning water, in that this poured on the heare of the heade, or on a cloth, and putting a candell to it, forthwith burneth, in such maner,

that the heares of the heade séeme, or the clothe to burne, although neyther of them be consumed. The Quintessence also is sayd to be reduced of the Chymists, vnto an extréeme subtilnesse. The burning water or water of lyfe, is sometimes dystilled out of pleasant and good wyne, as the whyte or redde, but oftner drawne out of the wyne lyes, of a certaine eager sauour, or corrupt wyne, by a Tinne or Copper Lymbecke, hauing the head sharpe in ye top (like to a spyre stéeple) and a bucket for cold water framed artely vpon, and the Furnace also heated moderately with coales, as wryteth Lemnius.
                  
Further whē out of pure wine, a water of life is distilled, I heare (sayth D. Gesnerus) that out of a great quantitie of good wyne, a little yéelde or quantity of burning water to be distilled: but out of the lyes of wyne, a much yéelde and quantitie gathered: and out of the wyne Alsatico, is not so commendable an Aqua vitae dystilled: Besides, the burning wine in lightnesse, doth in a maner excéede or passe all other moystures, forasmuch as there be foure (as the same Lemnius reporteth in his seconde booke, and. 34. cap.) of the secrete miracles of nature, which by reason of the lyghtnesse and heauynesse, doe contende in themselues, as the wyne, the water, the oyle, and honny, of which the lightest, and smallest of weyght, is the burning wyne, which mixed with the oyle, floteth

aboue, and the oyle setleth vnder: In that it is all the earthlye gathering, to the vttermost boyled to it, and is the whole fierie &amp; ayreall substaunce wrought of the same, and next to thys in lightnesse is the oyle. &amp;c.
               That if you will trye, whether the Quintessence be pure, or coū
                  terfaited, wette a napkin or lynnen cloth in the sayde lyquour, and putting a candell to it, set on fire, if incontinent it flameth, and the cloth neuer the worse, then is it most effectuous and perfite. And handkerchiefes wette in this water, being kyndled, flame, and not consume them, for the flame so lightly burneth on the linnen cloth, that it pierceth or entreth not through, but as it were, by a licking maner, suppeth vp the lycour agréeable to it, and of a firie nature: That if you poure a little of it in the palme of the hande, and set it on fire with the flame of paper, it then burneth in the palme, and not heateth nor burneth the hande.
               I haue tryed the marueylous vertue of it (sayeth Lemnius) in many matters, for at what time the ayre is very colde, and that it strongly fréeseth, this lycour for all that is not frosen, nor congealed to yse, insomuch the ynke at that season, and many others

besides, myxed with certaine droppes of it, are defended from being frosen, and the same procéedeth through the extréeme hotenesse and thynnesse, which consist in it: this burning wyne myxed with salt, and set on fire, causeth the standers about, whyles it flameth, to appeare lyke deade persons. Hitherto Ringelbergius. This séetheth an egge, and preserueth boyled or rawe fleshe from putrifying, being dipped in the same: and troubled wyne myxed with it, cléereth, and is restored: and dropped into newe wyne, doth lyke cleare it: Wyne decaying and sower, it also restoreth: It draweth forth the vertue of all herbes, if they be infused in it, except the sauour of the Violet, which it retayneth not: The sauour of it slayeth all venymous wormes, and auoydeth poyson. This Vitalis. And this one thing is marueylous, which I learned (sayth the Author) of a credible person: that if certaine droppes of the water be poured into a gunne, and myxed with the pouder at the shooting of, this htetsarb: In the same maner are also great rockes of stone broken: and I heare (sayth the Authour) a beaten way so made by the valley Tellina, (as I gesse) toward Millaine: By the dropping of the water on the rockes, made of wyne thrice dystilled ouer, which by that meanes are woonderfullye cracked and broken a sunder. Further a lynnen clothe dypped in it (as we haue aboue vttered) doth wholye flame, without harme of the threades: and dystilled a fourth time ouer, if you then throwe of it vp into the ayre, nothing of it will discende or fall to the earth: And if you will a fishe to haue a better sauour with it, kill the fishe then in this dystilled licour, and suffer the same to lye in it a time, and it wil continue in the like sauour for many days: if you season the fishe killed in this maner, with Salt and Pepper, there will nothing eate pleasanter, especially if it shall be a fishe of the best kinde. The burning water often distilled, if with it you shall wash the hands, and set on flame, they will burne without harme. This Gaudentius Merula, in libro. 4. memorabilium, that if in the dystilling, the pouder of Sulphur viue be myxed, then the Aqua vitae kindled, will burne the stronger. This ceaseth the payne of the heade, if it procéede of a colde matter. And druncke with a fasting stomacke for two dayes togither, with a little quantitie of Triacle, purgeth the heade, and dryeth vp by the moystures of the same:

If any drincketh a quantitie of this, with some maner of wyne, in the morning fasting, doth like comfort the brayne: This putteth away the dymnesse of sight, and consumeth the webbe and spottes of the eyes, and dryeth vp the running of them: and dropped into the eares, restoreth hearing: A lynnen cloth wette in it, and layde on the tongue, restoreth the speach of the palsie person, if it shall be often repeated for certaine houres. Some commende the sublimation of wyne against wormes which bréede in the téeth, by washing the mouth with it: and the best wyne for thys purpose (as affirmeth Alexander Benedictus) is the Candie, or Rennishe wine, which the oftner repeated by distillation, will be the stronger. This water drawne by a glasse Limbecke, annointed on the neck, and drunck in the morning fasting, helpeth hoarsnesse. The vse of it in the dropsie, is on this maner exercised: take halfe a measure of the Aqua vitae, which gently heate, that it may be in a maner warme, after washe the féete with it, &amp; let the féete stande in the same for one quarter of an houre, then the soles of the féete rubbe with the iuice of the Nettle, and about the ancle bones, and the pacient shall in short time be cured, as Virus of Rochberg reported to the Author. The water sublymed of pure wyne, auayleth against refting or belching, procéeded of cold and wynde: This Alexander Benedictus. The Germaines in a certaine place, doe drincke or taste of the water thryse distilled ouer, supposing it auayleable against flewme: the same Author. To be auayleable against the paynes of the loynes, and flegmatick swellings, did the author vnderstand &amp; learne this of a certaine farmer or franklin of the countrie, on this wise: that a platter or basen should be taken, &amp; so fenced, that it coulde not be harmed with the fire, thorow a cloth layd on it: the same so prepared, set into a hot house, close on euery side, &amp; the cloth then wet with the best Aqua vitae, set on a flame (for if the Aqua vitae be good, the cloth will not be burned) and let the pacient incontinent enter into that close roume, and he shall forthwith sweate, in that it procureth there a mightie heate: and let this be done fiue times, or more, according to the strength of the pacient, and the places payning, bath well with the Aqua vitae, in which the flowers of Spykenarde, shall be stéeped, and the pacient shall be shortly holpen: And vnto the

stone of the bladder, they will to drincke the water of lyfe, for the space of seuen months, euery day morning and euening, myxing togither two partes of pure wyne, and one of the water of lyfe: and in this maner is the stone broken, and the péeces sent forth with the vrine: Woundes bathed with the water, and the Canker, and Fistula, are healed with it.
               
                  Vitalis de Furno (out of many) attributed these properties to it, that it breaketh impostumes aswell within as without the body, if it be drunck, or applyed sometimes without: It taketh away the spots of the eyes, and both the rednesse and heat of them, and stayeth the shed
                     •
                  ing of teares: It helpeth such diseased in the splene and lyuer, being discretely drunck: It congealeth Mercurie, whiteneth Copper, and dissolueth the spirits and bodies calcyned: It cureth woundes, any maner Goute, the Canker, and Fistula, if drunck, or the place of the wounde washed with it: It sharpeneth vnderstanding, discretely taken, and matters past, it bringeth to memorie, and maketh the person excéeding merie, and preserueth youth: It cureth the salt flegme, and redde spots of the face: It taketh away the stinke of the nosthrils, gummes, and armeholes: Gargelled, breaketh impostumes in the throte: It very much helpeth the Melancholick: and much profiteth the ache in the hippes, the goute, &amp; ioyntaches: It cureth the Dropsie of a colde cause: It much auayleth against the cholicke passion: with his lyme dissolued in wyne, it breaketh the stone of the bladder: but dissolued with his salt, doth breake the stone of the kidneys, and sendeth the péeces forth: And taken moderatly, doth put away the quartaine Ague: If the leprous person shall measurably drinck of the water sometimes, the lepri
                     •
                   shall not further extende: It profiteth women to conceyue, and conception it strengthneth, if the woman conceyued, drinck of it: If a little of it be druncke sometymes, or holden a whyles in the mouth, cureth the Rheume

                  sse, if any faint harted or weake couraged person, shall somtimes drink of it. These hitherto Vitalis. Further of the properties of the same water in general, doth Leuius Lemnius: vtter these in his booke of the secret miracles of nature: where he wryteth, that no lycour, which is ministred vnto any vse to mans bodie, is

eyther lighter, or more péercing, than the Aqua vitae, or that more preserueth &amp; defendeth all things from putrifying, or córruption: whose vse hath growne so common with the nether Germanie, &amp; Flaunders, that fréelyer than is profitable to helth, they take and drinck of it: for not to all persons, or at all tymes, the drinking of it is so agréeable and healthfull, insomuch that to leane persons, &amp; of a drie nature, &amp; in the summer time, the vse of it is very daungerous, for it burneth their bodies, and consumeth naturall moysture in them: but in the fatte and moyst bodies, and such which doe abounde in the flegmaticke humors, this nothing harmeth, in that the water digesteth the excrementall humours, and both defendeth and preserueth such bodies from the lithargie, or sléeping downe right, the Apoplexie, &amp; all colde sicknesses. For which cause in ye winter time, I allow a moderate vse of it, as the quantitie of halfe a dram (which filleth a spoone) at one tyme, throughly swéetned with sugar, and a slyce of fine white bread eaten with it, whereby the burning force of it may the lesse strike or giue vnto the nosthrils and brayne, or hastily carie any harme to the lyuer, through the penetrable and feruent heate: but applyed without, doth greatly helpe the sinewes and muscles, and the members oppressed with colde, all other painefull diseases, which come of colde humors, it asswageth and putteth awaye, through the heating force, and swiftnesse of piercing: and it recouereth also speach depriued &amp; lost, if at that instant tyme be mixed to it, of the séedes of Roket, and the squillitick vineger: That if the Aqua vitae be distylled twyse or thryse ouer, it purchaseth an incredible force of peerchig. These hitherto Lemnius.
               
            
            
               Of the instruments which the best practitioners vse, vnto the dystilling of Aqua vitae. The seconde Chapter.
               SEing in the dystillation of the water of lyfe, many grosse spirits are eleuated or sent vp by force of the heate, for that cause, the practisioner must indeuour to temper them, and to cause those subtiller through the benefit &amp; help of the long, narrow &amp; winding instruments, and the distillation to be performed, néedeth not only cooling, but also to be in a colde place, where water may remayne

for the continuall cooling of them, that no viscositie or grossenesse come vnto the Limbecke, whereof

is come to passe, that diuers and sundrie instruments are inuented by skilfull practisioners, vnto the better performing of the abouesaide.
               Many doe dystill the burning water by a bladder (as they name it) as Louicer9
                   reporteth, &amp; teacheth in his booke, which the learned may there reade, &amp; practise if they will: but this maner of dystillation, for that they shed the water, is not allowed of the best dystillers: and for that reason they vse this maner and waye, for a more spéedynesse, &amp; shorter forme inuented in a maner for the Poticarie, only with vs of Germany.
            
            
               An instrument for the dystilling of the water of lyfe, out of the lyes of Wyne. The thirde Chapter.
               
               
                  A. representeth the Furnace being rounde in forme, or square, if it be, forceth not much.

                  C. doth here represent the Brasse pot or Copper vessell, sufficient able or great ynoughe,

conteyning the lyes.
               
                  D. doth signifie the couer of the vessell, which if the same be made hollowe imbossing towarde the myddle, and that in the myddle where the pype issueth forth, this be framed to a sharpenesse, it will sende by the vapors much better, than if the couer were playne or flat.
               
                  E. doth signifie the hole of the couer, into which the pype is set, and artely fastened.
               
                  F. doth aptlye shewe the Copper pype, carying forth the vapors, which ought to be made wrything and wynding after this maner: for on such wyse (as they saye) the water will séeme the oftner to be dystilled: or the same perhaps so framed, that the vapors the longer kept backe, maye the lightlyer and easier be thickened. Some there be, which make sundry windings in the pype, before it entreth within the Bucket or firkin, which perhaps lesse allowed and commended of the skylfuller practisioners.
               
                  G. representeth the wooden payle, bucket, or firkin conteyning in it the colde water. H. Doth signifie the benche or great stoole with foure féete, bearing the bucket or firkin full of colde water.
               
                  K. the place lower on the bench or stoole, where the receyuer ought artely to be set and fastened.
               Two furnaces may be buylt neare to this firkin or bucket (for on such wyse with vs, a certayne practisioner was woont to dystill the burning water) of which, the one maye be erected nearer to the bucket, and the other placed further of: in the nearer pot to the Bucket, let the Lyes be first dystilled: in the other vessell placed further of, let it be dystilled a seconde tyme, that the water may be the subtiller and purer. And the same water, maye perhaps be drawne with lesser businesse, if in the second dystillation, it be dystilled with a longer Pype: in that by a longer Pype and way retching, the spirites sent forth, may the thinner be gathered.
            
            
               An other Instrument. The fourth Chapter.
               
                  1. The vessell or potte, contayning the matter or liquide substance: A certayne dystiller (with the Author) had a pot that helde xvj. measures: out of which he drewe, after a seconde, or thirde dystillation repeated, about thrée measures.
               
                  
                  
               
               
                  2 Representeth the couer of the vessell.
               
                  3 Doth here set forth the pype, which ought to be made broade beneath (as the Pynapple) and sharpe vppewarde: and the same pype maye bée made double, that the one filled with colde water, and heated, may be agayne drawne out.
               
                  4 Expresseth the paile or bucket, conteyning the colde water.
               
                  5 Signifieth the trancheon or small blocke of woode, set on a high stoole, ye apter to beare the Bucket, equall to the heade, and nose of the instrument placed.
               
                  6 Doth here represent the place where the receyuer ought to be set &amp; fastened. 7 Plainly sheweth the fire, to be made round about of any small cloue wood. By such an instrument, is a farre greater yéeld of burning water purchased, than by the cōmon Limbecks: for somuch as the pype retching from the couer of the vessell, doth ascende right vp, and not as in the others windingly: and in this perhaps is a greater spéede made, than in the other instruments.
            
            
               Another Instrument for the dystilling of the water of lyfe, borrowed out of Pyrotechnia. The .v. Chapter.
               ALthough sundrie and diuers instruments be dayly inuented: yet I sawe this alwayes most commodious, and profitablest, whose forme shall hereafer be described: and first let a Copper vessell tynned within be prepared, out of which in that part, by

which the wyne is poured in, let a long pype formed with manye emptie partes retch vpwarde: and at the ende aboue of thrée or foure yardes, let a small bucket eyther of Copper or woode be set, in the same maner placed, that the pype in part of the bole, or in

the vpper part of the bucket, retch wynding vp, from the middle of it: but at the toppe or straight ende of thys wynding Pype, let a heade of glasse be aptlye framed and set on, to the nose of whiche artely set and fasten a receyuer, for the Aqua vitae dystilling forth: This vessell on suche wyse prepared, sette aptly into the furnace, and the wine poure into it, by the pype retching vppe on the other side, right against the cocke, by which also the groundes or superfluous substance after the dystillation ended, are purged cleane forth: But in the vpper part, the bole or bucket placed vnder the pype, which for his wynding is named the Serpent, shall be filled with colde water, and a soft fire in the beginning made vnder the vessell of wyne: whose furnace ought to be buylt after this forme aboue demonstrated.
            
            
               A fourth Instrument for the dystilling of the Aqua vitae, so workemanly and cunningly drawne, that the water but once dystilled, may be purchased most mightie or strong: And I heare such a practise at Florence to be in vse.

               Of the dyuers maners of distylling the Aqua vitae, so well simple, as compounde. The .vij. Chapter.
               
                  A Water sublymed out of pure wine, affyrmeth an vnknowne practysioner, and the same is of late daies inuented, to sublime the water by a glasse or Copper Bodie, in the which dooing, the grosse substaunce and refuse remayneth, or stayeth behinde, and the lighter matter, in the vapours ascending, dystilleth and is gathered in the Receauer. Vitalis de Furno wylleth thus to dystill, the simple burning water: Take pure Claret wine, and strong, which powre into a Lymbecke, and dystill with a soft fyre, as you doe the Rosewater, and a burning water wyl yssue forth by sublimation, which looke howe oftner it shall be dystilled ouer, and so much the subtyller and profitabler it wyll be.
            
            
               That the water of life once dystilled ouer, may be so perfyte and good, and possesse the same properties: which an other thrise, foure times, or oftner dystilled doth. The .viij. Chapter.
               IF so be you wyll dystill, a simple Aqua vitae, or burning wyne at one dystillation, that in propertie and vertue it may be, as if the same were twenty times dystilled ouer, then couer a Spunge ouer the mouth of the Cucurbite, and the Lymbecke close with the seale or lute of Hermes, and a receauer set to the nose of the Lymbecke, and luted in the ioynte, dystill according to Arte in Balneo Mariae: For on such wise is caused, that the spyrit of the wine ascendeth vnto the highest, and from thence by the Nose falleth into the Receauer: but all the waterynesse, remayneth by the waye in the Spunge. And a certaine Alchymister vsed this maner, for a most great and déepe secrete. Wée compared or assayed it (sayth D. Gesnerus) with the Aqua vitae, once dystilled ouer without a Spunge, and we found ours of greater effecte and vertue: and wée againe assayed it, with an other water dystilled ten tymes ouer without a Spunge, and oures dyd more pearce, then that. A certaine dystiller with vs (sayeth the Aucthour) affyrmeth that the Aqua vitae onely once dystilled, to be verie vnholsome to them,

which drinke it: and to haue a great force of putrifying, as the same experience proueth. If the burning water be set on fire (sayth he) &amp; quenched againe after a whiles, that which remayneth, very much sauoureth or stincketh.

For such is the agreement betwéene the hart and it, that at any tyme as it should seeme, may this water be drawne of the heart, &amp; thus drawne, be chaunged in a short tyme, and conuerted after into a spumouse substaunce, not only of the cōplexional vertue, but euen the whole forme resisteth, any Pestilentiall poyson, and maistryeth the same out of hand. And for that cause, such is the excellent vertue of the water, that the taking and vse of it, not onely preserueth a man from Pestilence, but that taken of it, both spéedily delyuer him: the making and drawing of which water is on this wyse. Take of Tormentyll rootes, (freshe if they maye be gotten) one pounde, of the rootes of Fluellyng, and of Dittany, of eache halfe a pounde, of the rootes of Elecampane, eyght ounces, of Sorrell with the Séedes (if they maye be gotten) twoo pounde, or of Sorrell one pound, and eyght ounces, and of the Séedes of it, foure ounces, of Borrage and Buglosse, with theyr flowers, of the red and wylde Roses, of each one pound, of Pympernel, and of Scabious, of each halfe a pound, of the iuyce of Lymons one pounde, of fine Tryacle, halfe a pounde, of burning Water drawne out of the best Wyne, and often repeated two ounces, of Terra sigillata, and Bole Armoniacke, of eache two ounces, of the white and red Saunders, of Spodij, of the white and red Ben, of cleare Pearles, of each one ounce &amp; a halfe, of the bone of a Harts heart one ounce, of the shauings or filings of Iuory halfe an ounce, of Saffrō three drams, of Camphora two drams, of Leafe Gold halfe an ounce waight: but first take the Leaues of Gold, &amp; those clippe into so small péeces as is possible, with a fine payre of shéeres, or those on a Marble stone grind with Hony a long time into a pouder not to be perceyued by feeling, shal you bring the leaues: after put them into the burning water, stopping close ye mouth of the Glasse, yt no ayre breath forth, &amp; let it so stand for fifteene daies. Then take the pearles most finely brought to pouder, &amp; powre thē into another glasse with ye iuyce of the Lymons, which well stopped let stand so many dayes: after with ye best wyne wash wel the rootes, that they may be clensed frō
                  
the earth, and dryed of the wynde in the shadowe, beat them in a Morter, and lyke the hearbes, the flowers, and Roses, with the seedes: which done, poure all these into a certaine earthen vessell glased, into which after put the Triacle with those powders and other thinges. After with these powre that burning water with the leaues of Golde, and the iuyce of Lymons with the Pearles, sealing the mouth of the vessell in such maner, that no ayre breath forth. Then make a deepe pyt in the earth in a moyst place, vnto the depth of three feete, and make a Bed in the bottome of the pyt, halfe a foote thicke of unsleaked Lyme: That vessell then place in the myddle of it, with Horse doong layd round about, and couering it, on which then powre one or two buckets or pailes of water: and the vessell thus buryed, let stand for twelue naturall dayes, in remoouing it euery thyrde or fowrth daye with freshe doong, which tyme ended, drawe the vessell forth, and the whole substaunce after powre into a Glasse bodye, setting a head close on it, and stopping the ioynt round about that no ayre breathe forth, after make a soft fyre vnder of small clouen wood, without smoke (or rather of pure Coales) and to the Nose of the head remember to lute the receauer, that no ayre breathe forth. The water drawne according to Arte, powre vpon the Feces, and dystill againe, which a thyrde tyme powre into the Lymbecke without the Feces, and dystill againe in Balneo Mariae, the water gathered keepe to your vse in a Glasse close stopped: Of this water take one small sponefull by it selfe, or with any other confection or powder: For this water multiplyeth the spyrites, cleareth them, comforteth the principall members, and dysposeth them, that the body hardlye may receaue the impression of any plague, being neuer so mighty raygning, and infected or stricken with the Pestilence, doth marueylous speedily helpe the impression. For whiles those matters remained hyd, in those is a certaine fermentacion caused. To conclude, by the dystillation is a newe forme procured in them, that of it selfe caused, and not by reason of the fower qualyties: but in that it is on such wyse, as Aucthours report, that the Pestilence mightily vering eache, is through corruption caused.
               A compounde water of Lyfe, helping all grieffes of the bodye: take of Nutmegges, of Floris moschatae, of Cloues, of Cynamon,

of Ginger, of Cubebae, of Graines of Paradize▪ of Stoechaaes, of the seedes of Pyonie, of eache halfe an ounce, of Mustard séedes, and of Lauender, of eache one ounce, of Vermilon (or rather Dragons blood) of Colyander, of Anise and of Basil, of each halfe an ounce, of Geate (but I rather wyl, sayth D. Gesnerus, of Aumber) &amp; of Rosemary, of each one ounce, of Maioram, of Cardamomum, of Fennel, of Lycoris, of Hysope, &amp; of Spyknard, of each halfe an ounce, of the flowers of Borrage, of the Lyllies of the valley, of Baulme, of the heads of the seedes of Roses, of each halfe an ounce, of ye Missill toe of the Oke, of the bones of the Hartes heart, of Lignum aloes, &amp; of Saffron, of each one ounce, of Sage one handfull. The maner of preparing the water, is on this wyse: take fortie measures of good wyne, which dystill by a Lymbecke in Balneo Mariae: in the first dystillatiō gather twelue measures, which dystill ouer againe, vntyll no more remayneth or be in the Glasse, then a Nutte shell wyl hold, the same then cast foorth in that it is al flewme; the wyne last dystilled, distyl againe, and the whole leysurely or softly fiue times ouer, in Balneo Mariae, and the water shal then be prepared. Take after all the aboue sayde symples, as part of them small chopped, &amp; part beaten into fine pouder, which may be brought to pouder, or which powre so much of the dystilled wyne, as wyll well reache fowre fingers aboue the whole, these let stande togyther to infuse for thrée or fowre dayes, vntyll the water be coulored. The wyne after poure into another Glasse, and stoppe the mouth close, that no ayre breathe foorth. But on the Feces or groundes remayning, poure freshe wyne, which let so stande to stiepe for seuen or eyght dayes, vntyll the wyne hath drawne and gotten the substaunce of all the infused. That wyne then seperate from the Feces, pouring after the whole wine into a Glasse bodie, which distyll with a head close luted, in Balneo Mariae, vntyll no moisture remaineth in the Glasse: and then shall you possesse the Quintessence of the foresayde matters, which keepe dyligently stopped, that it be not touched of the ayre. After distyll wyne of those simples drawne by a Lymbecke, and take or gather the halfe parte of the wyne: for this shall be, the true Quintessence of that wyne. But the other part of the wyne which remaineth in the Glasse, throwe awaye, for it is onely a waterie moysture. Then the Quintessence of the

wyne, ioyned with the Quintessence of the other matters, wyll become so yellowe as Golde. To this then adde Muscum Alexandrinum, and Amber gréese, of eache one dramme, of Ruberbe two drams, which after the tying in a fine lynnen clothe, hange within the water, and stoppe dylligently the mouth of the Glasse, for it is then wholly perfourmed to vse.
               A water of Lyfe, marueylouslie comforting, &amp;c. Dissoluing and coagulating Irone, and other Mettalles, &amp;c. Take of Nutmegs, of Galingale, of Cardamomum, of the Graynes of Paradize, of Cubebae, of Mace, of Ginger, and of Cynamon: all these brought to powder, and myxed with the strongest White wyne, let all after be beaten and laboured togyther, vnto the styfnesse and thicknesse of a Pultyse, which then distyll with a softe fyre, and you shall gather a cleare and pure water. To this water if you myxe a quantytie of Oyle, the Oyle wyll then descende: but if you myxe Camphora with it, then shall the water possesse all the vertues, which the Camphora hath. That if this Camphora water, be mixed with the common water, it then worketh the same as milk, and if it be strayned through a Lynnen cloathe, this water wyll remaine courded: of which you maye after make a Candell, and lyghted, wyll burne lyke the matche or Candle in a Lampe. Now thi
                     •
                   water profiteth in the colde disseases of the bodye, for it dygesteth, and preserueth flesh from putrifying, the sadde person maketh merrie, &amp; draweth vnto it the vertues of all hearbes, infused in the same: druncke certayne tymes, breaketh the Impostume: it coagulateth &amp; fyxeth Mercurie: it dryeth vp teares of the eyes, the rednesse, &amp; heate of them it helpeth, and cureth such disseased of the splene. It preserueth woundes frō putrifying, it helpeth the Fistula &amp; Canker, reformeth or amendeth cold causes, and the Palsie, it sharpneth &amp; increaseth vnderstanding, and helpeth memory, if the temples sundry times be annointed with it. It maketh a man ioyous and merry▪ preserueth young age and health, and taketh away the styncke of the mouth and gummes. It maketh olde wyne, of the newe: it defendeth a man against poyson: it taketh awaye the payne, and defenesse of the Eares. Two droppes druncke in a cuppe of the best White wyne, doe marueylously preserue memory: if the same be vsed at the going to bed. The water annointed

on the Temples foure tymes in the wéeke, in the wynter tyme, preserueth memory.
               A water of lyfe inuented and drawen, for a noble person: take of Spetierum diambrae, one dram, of Dianthos, halfe a dram, of Pellitory rootes, two drams, of long Pepper, sixe drams, of Anacardus, one dram and a halfe, of Xyloaloes one dram: these fynely wrought togeather, infuse in Aqua vitae of good Maluesie, dystilled seuen times ouer, eyght ounces, which let so stand close stopped, for eyght dayes: after dystill the whole by Balneum Mariae, according to Arte.
               An Aqua vitae helping Tertian Agues, borrowed out of Theophrastus paracelsus: take a penny woorth of Aqua vitae, and the white of one egge, these beate very well togeather, vntyll they be brought vnto the forme of a Pultyse, which gyue before the comming of the fytte, well an hower or two, and to it also adde a lytle Saffron. &amp;c.
               A Golden water, helping the Apoplexie, the Falling sicknesse, and infirmities of the Synewes: take of the leaues and flowers of the Sage, two ounces, of Nutmegges, of Cloues, of Gynger, of Cynamon, of Graynes of Paradize, of eache one ounce, of Castory one dram, of the rindes of the Citrone, three drams, of Spykenard one dram, of the pure Oyle of Bayes, one dram, all these after the dylligent beating, powre into one measure of the best white wine, &amp; the mouth of the Glasse body close sealed, let so stand to putryfie for fowre dayes, after dystill with a soft fyre, according to Arte.
               Another water not vnlyke to the former, procuring and mayntayning young age: take of the leaues and flowers of Sage royal, three ounces, of Gynger, of Cloues, of Nutmegges, and of the Graynes of Paradyze, of eache halfe an ounce, all these most finelie brought to pouder, powre into twoo measures of the strongest wyne, close stopped in a Glasse body for fouretéene dayes, after set on the head cloose Luted, and dystill with a softe fyre according to Arte, the water gathered, kéepe close stopped in a Glasse. This helpeth the inward colde impostumes: for druncke with the agréeable water, incontinent breaketh them. It auayleth vnto the Pinne and webbe of the eyes, in clearing and putting them aawy: it sharpneth also the syght, and cureth the cold Ophthalmia,

with a Feather a lytle dropped into the eyes, doth marueylouslye cleare them. It auayleth also both without and within, applyed &amp; druncke: it preuayleth besides against bruses and strypes. It cureth the Gowte, and paine of the ioyntes. And annoynting with it, helpeth the paine of the head, the Apoplexie, the rewme, and any maner coldnesse of the brayne: and druncke, auayleth against the dropsie, helpeth the stomacke, and auayleth against the cough with the water agréeable. I beléeue that it doth preserue yong age, if a lytle of it be druncke euery daye. It cureth also any Scabbe, annointed with it, and the bytte of a mad Dogge, applyed on the byt, and giuen to drincke.
               A water of Lyfe, according to Aristotles instruction: Take of Cynamon, of Gynger, of Cloues, of Nutmegs, and of long Pepper, of each halfe an ounce, of Dates halfe an ounce, of Cubebae, of Graines of Paradize, of Mace, of Almondes, and of Galingale, of eache halfe an ounce, of Sage twelue ounces: all these broken and beaten to powder, infuse after in Malmesie, for eyght dayes in a Glasse bodie, which then distyll with a softe fyre according to Arte.
               Another water of Lyfe: take of the roote with the hearbe of the blacke Ellebore prepared (whether in the Quince Apple) sowre ounces, of the flowers of the Orrendges, of the flowers of Stoechados, of the flowers of the Pome Cytrone, &amp; of the flowers of Horehounde, of each fowre handfulles, which serueth for the first distillation. For the second distyllation: take of chosen Ruberbe halfe an ounce or one ounce, of the flowres of Borrage and Buglosse, of eache sixe handfulles, of great Reysons halfe a pounde, of Mouse eare, of the flowres of the Dasie, of the hearbe of the blacke Ellebore prepared, of eache two handfulles, of the flowres of the Cytrone or Baulme, sixe handfulles, of the flowres or leaues of Angelica two handfulles, of the flowres of Organy, eyght handfuls, of Lycorys scraped halfe a pounde, these after the brusing, distyll according to Arte. Also take of rectifyed wine vnto the vttermost, foure measures, which powre on the Spices, and let the whole infuse for eyght dayes, sturring it euery daye twyse or thryse: after distyll with a soft fyre, and on such wyse let it be done, a seconde and thyrde tyme. After of chosen Honny cleane skymmed, and

of oyle Olyue, of each halfe a measure, let these be mixed with the wine distylled, and distilled togyther with a most soft fire, for then taketh it away the stincke in the wyne, and swéetneth the wyne, &amp; taketh away the stincke and burning of the hearbes. But if you wyll haue it better, let the wine be fylled with the flowers of the Cytrone Stoechados, &amp; distylled againe with a most soft fyre. After take of this Aqua vitae two measures, of white Sugar one pounde, and thus corrected let it be most finelye brought to pouder, and set on the coales, euer sturring it about, vntyll the whole Sugar be dyssolued in it, and it shall be performed &amp; done in .xxix. dayes. After take of the best Cynamon, one pounde, which bring to fine pouder, the same infuse for eyght or tenne dayes, sturring it once or twise euery daye, after straine and wring the same hard in a presse. If you be mynded to haue it smell and taste pleasaunter, then adde to it of Muske and Amber greese, according to your discretion. For this lycour is of a maruaylous efficacie in the decay and faynting of the heart: in myxing it with Electuaries, and Cordiall Medicines, as you know that vnderstand practise.
               
               An Aqua vitae, aromatyzated, of great vertue, seruing vnto all colde grieffes of the stomacke: the makyng of which is gloryous

and rare water, is on this wyse. Take of Nutmegges, of Cloues, of Galingale, of Cardamomum, of Cubebae, of Mace, of Cynamon, of Gynger, of Saffron, and of Frankinsence, of eache one ounce: these beaten in a grosse manner, myxe dillygentlye togyther: after powre all these into a Glasse bodye, verye well fensed with lute, on which powre sixe pyntes of the finest Aqua vitae, the whole let stande togyther for syxe or eyght dayes, then dystyll the lycour, with his head and Receauer in Ashes, and a redde water wyll be gathered, which is verye singular and precious: For this (as aboue vttered) helpeth all grieffes of the bodye, proceeding of a colde cause, and both cleanseth and healeth all woundes, without any griefe, it procureth a good memorye, helpeth the coughe, and putteth awaye heauinesse of mynde, and many other matters it worketh, as by tryall maye be knowne: this borrowed out of the synguler practises, of the famous Gréeke Leonard Tiorauant.
               
               A maruaylous water of Lyfe, that auayleth in the Apoplexie and fallyng sicknesse, druncke morning and Euening, but better if taken euerye mornyng. In the Euening three or fowre droppes taken with a slyce of breade, comforteth both the heart and Brayne, and all the powers and vertues of the Brayne and bodye. It dryeth vp all the humours aboue nature or not naturall, and all other superfluityes also, whether these proceede of a hote or colde cause, and preserueth naturall heate in his temperament. Yet persons vnder thyrtye yeares of age, maye not often vse or dryncke of the water, vnlesse they be muche charged with many colde humours: but verye apte and agreeable, to olde and colde persons.
               The vertue of this water, can not sufficientlye be expressed, in that the same auayleth both within, and without the bodye. Against the plague, let it be taken the same daye, with good Venice Triacle. Annointed within the Nosethrelles, very much comforteth. And is a singular Medycine against the Apoplexie, and falling sicknesse: it is also the mother of all Medycines, for it comforteth the Matrice, and Wombe at any tyme, yf it runneth to muche, thys stayeth it, and lyke prouoketh it, if neede bée.

Then let the whole be sublymed in a Glasse bodie with a narrowe necke, and Receauer artlye fastoned to it, and when it shall distyll whyte forth, or styncke, then is it sufficient. And then poure into it these foure, as the Muske, the Amber, the Camphora, and Sugar broken: but the other thrée not broken, which let stande togyther for thrée or foure dayes,

sturring it euery daye once or twyse, from the bottome, with a woodden spattell: let these then stande for other three or foure dayes, vntyll the whole be setled, and that it appeare cleare, which being cleare, powre foorth, in strayning the same through a fyne Lynnen cloth into a Glasse. But in the ende when the lycour wareth troubled, myxe togither againe▪ and let it setle againe, then straine againe, as afore, &amp; continue the like doing, vntyl you haue purchased all that which is cleare, which myxe altogyther, in keeping it in a tynne Bottell, for that the Glasse destroyeth it, and let it be kept in no hote place, and the vertue of it endureth for two or thrée yéeres, or a longer tyme.

At the first a strong fyre ought to be made of coales, vntyll it become so hote, that you cannot suffer your finger vpon it, then drawe away and abate the fire, and so procéede with a softe fire, that if you touch it, you may be able to suffer the finger vpon: and yet let not the fire be ouer soft, nor ouer strong in heate, least the substaunce maye be dryed in the potte. Many tymes also a droppe falling prooue with the finger, for on such wyse shall you redilye perceyue, when his facultie and strength is feebled or lessened, or that his sauour be chaunged odious or stincking: for if it be felt on such wise, then chaunge the Receauer, as is afore taught.

Take of Ligni aloes, of Cloues, of Gynger, of Galingale, of Cynamon, of Mace, of Nutmegs, of long Pepper, of Calamus aromaticus, of Cubebae, of Rubarbe, of the graynes of Paradize, of Cardamomum, of each two drams, of Rosemary, of Celondine, of Mercurie, of the blessed Thystle, of Imperatoria, and of the white Dittany, of eache one ounce, all these after the beatyng infuse in syxe pyntes of the best Aqua vitae (that serueth for the Quintessence) which let so remayne for eyght dayes, after distyll the lycour in Balneo Mariae according to Arte. Of that water gathered, adde to eache pynte, two ounces of fyne Sugar dyssolued in Rosewater, and eyght graynes of Muske, which dillegentlye kéepe in a Glasse close stopped. This syngular water druncke euerye morning, vnto the quantitye of one or two drammes at a tyme, preserueth the personne a long tyme in health and perfyte strength: in that the same heateth the stomacke being colde, increaseth naturall heate, and causeth good digestion of meate, through which, nature is preserued long lustye and young. This also heateth the bloud in the Veynes, in suche manner, that the same causeth it to runne, and worcke his effectes without impedyment. It dryeth up colde and moyste humours, whiche hynder the working of nature, and worcketh many other helpes. This

               A water not to be mysliked, yéelding and working many matters: for this helpeth the Goute, ioynt sicknesses, the dystillation of the head, preserueth young age, and strength: gyueth also wyt and memorie, reuyueth the spyrites, and causeth them purer. The making of which is on this wyse: take of burning water, thrée or foure tymes distylled ouer, foure pyntes, of Rosemarye flowers one pound, of the toppes of the branches of the same, halfe a pound: these stiepe togyther for a daye, and drawe in a double vessell, with a long necked Receauer, the neather part of it resting in a colde place. For we so name it, sayth Galen, when in a Pan or Kettyl, which containeth the hote water, another vessell standeth. Of thys water thus distylled by a Lymbecke, take halfe a pynte, of Nutmegges, of Galingale, of Cloues, of Cardamomum, of Mace, and of Cubebae, of eache thrée ounces, of white Aumber, one ounce and a halfe, of Ligm aloes so much, of Castorye, and of Spyknarde, of eache two drams, these beaten seuerall and apart, and compounded after altogyther, vntyll they be come vnto a certaine thycknesse, and then distylled againe togyther, keepe to your vse. For an ounce of the aboue sayde water, druncke with a slyce of white bread, auayleth so much, as a Baulme: This Fumanellus, as the Aucthour supposeth.
            
            
               Of the Iuyces or drawing of Iuyces, out of Symples and compound matters. The .jx. Chapter.
               IVyce, which of the Greekes is properlie named

                  , is that which is pressed or wringed out of symple or compounde matters brused, chopped, or stieped. But Iuyces are otherwyse pressed out, as eyther out of the leaues or braunches of the hearbes, beaten alone, and that greene and full of iuyce, or out of fruytes, as out of Grapes, not rype or greene, Pomegranates, Seruices, Medlars, wyld Sl

                  es, Quinces, Lemons, &amp;c. Or out of hearbes hauing lytle moysture, and the same clammye, as the Iuie, the Purselan, Cotylidone, the Houselyke, &amp;c. Out of which not simplie a iuyce, can be had or gotten,

but through water poured vpon, or other lycour, lyke to the properties of them, that neede wringing or pressing out, that pressed out togither with the same humour, the force and vertue of the symple hearbe maye so be purchased: or if brused and put into a strayner or Bagge, and hanged in a colde Seller or place, that the iuyce by lytle and lytle, may droppe into a dyshe or Porrendger set vnder. Of these, and such lyke drawings forth of iuyces, which in shoppes, in a vessell with a narrow mouth, oyle being poured vpon finger highe, or sprinckled with Salt, as appeareth of the iuyce of vnripened fruites, vnto Phisick vse, set vp and kept, we meane here to intreate nothing thereof: nor the lyke of certaine others, which in the Sun, by a dayly moouing, are dryed and thyckned, and that in the shadow, as the iuyce of Sloes: in an Ouen or Furnace, or other hote place▪ included and hāged to drye. But we wyll onely intreate of those iuyces, which are described out of rootes, and the dryer hearbes, or such hauing but verye lytle moysture, stieped for certaine dayes in water, or any other lycour, distylled after by Balneum Mariae, that seperated from the watery moysture, that substaunce of the matter infused, pure and sincere may be left somwhat grosser: or without distyllation, by boyling only conuerted into a vapour hauing a straunge humour, the substaunce of the matter infused may thicken, strayned before, or the whole water distylled by Fyltre, &amp;c. And the vse of this drawing foorth, or substaunce purchased▪ which of the iuyce taken in a smal quantity, yeeldeth great commodities in our bodyes. For where of Medicines in the whole substance, is want to be giuen one ounce: of the iuyce drawne, sufficeth onelye one dramme: in which vndoubtedlye maye the sicke be much delighted and pleased, especiallye seeing many are woont much to abhorre the takyng of Medicines.
               And this is to be noted, in the drawinges▪ that if the spirit shal not be sufficient pure, or dilligently seperated, insomuch that somwhat of the earthinesse yet remayneth, and maye containe, that then the vertue or propertye of the matter drawne is myxed to this earthynesse, and ascendeth and euaporateth togyther. But the sincere and pure spirit, doth cause this least, in that out of the matter drawne, this descendeth without any sauour or taste: and

for that cause is the spyrit easilie seperated by Balneum Mariae, whose heate exéedeth not the degree of heate, which consisteth or is in mans vryne. Yet it behooueth also that the wate, by which the washing is caused, be verie subtyll, euen lyke as the spyrit of the wyne, least the euyll qualitie of the water may ascende togyther. But a sure tryall and knowledge of the water is, if it shalbe without taste or savour.
            
            
               The drawing of hearbes, and other remedies, with burning water, perfytelie distylled in Balneo Mariae, &amp;c. As out of Rubarbe Agaricke, Ellebore, and Guaicum, according to Theophrastus instruction. The .x. Chapter.
               THe artificiall drawing of symple matters, are wrought after this manner: Fyrst let purest and best Aqua vitae be chosen, which is sufficient effectuous vnto the drawing foorth and purchasing the properties of the hearbes. Then take Sage, or any lyke symple, out of the which you determine to drawe a iuyce, the same laye in a drye ayre, towarde the North especiallye. Where after it shalbe a lytle dryed, shred or choppe finelie, and powre the whole into a Glasse, whose mouth shalbe sufficient wyde, that is, two fyngers broade, that when you wyll, you maye easily get or draw foorth whatsoever is put in, on which powre the Aqua vitae, or spirit of the wyne, well the lytle fynger breadth aboue the hearbe. After couer the vessel dilligently, in this maner: let paste be made, with which let the mouth be a finger breadth stopped round about, next to which binde vppon a fayre white Paper, and let it be so stopped, that it maye onely sticke to the sydes about the mouth of the Glasse. This Paper thus set on, let paste againe be layd on rounde about the place, aboue taught, and another newe Paper againe bound vpon the same. Then a thyrd time laye paste vpon, and rounde about the sydes of the mouth, and let a thyrde Paper be fastened, which couereth fullye ouer, that the mouth through the paste and Paper maye closelie be stopped. After couer the whole with ware, although this bee not so ne
                     •
                  defull. These thus orderlie handled and done, let the vessel after be set for two or thrée dayes in a hote place: according as the hearbe put in, shall be of a

thycker or thinner substaunce, and shall so néede to stiepe a longer or shorter tyme. At the ende of which tyme, powre the spirit into another vessell, and couer it againe: and the hearbes remayning, presse or wring through a Lynnen cloth, so stronglie as is possible, (or that you can doe by your strength) and after the wrynging, throwe them awaye. Then powre other freshe hearbes againe of the same kynde, and prepared as aboue taught, powre into the same spyrit, which stiepe, and presse forth, and the same repeate thrée or fowre tymes ouer, euen as you wyll purchase the drafte mightie or weake. That if the matter, out of the which a iuyce shall be drawne▪ shall be of great price, as is the Rubarbe, &amp; Lignum aloes: then not once pouring of Aqua vitae on it is sufficient, but dyuers and often tymes▪ that whatsoever of the spirit or propertie of the symple shall be, maye wholie be lefte in the water. Now after the spirit of the wine, shall abound in the facultie of the hearbs, in so much that it shal in a maner haue lost the proper tast or savour, then presse or wring forth the hearbes, and the same which shall be pressed foorth, dylligentlie and subtyllie distyl by Fylter, and vse when néede shall requyre. Or the spirit of the wyne from the propertie of the hearbes, shall be easyer seperated by distyllation in Balneo Mariae, in drawing foorth eyther the halfe, or all togyther, vntyll it shall come vnto an extreame waterynesse, or vntyll it bee thyckened as a Sauce, or the iuyce dryed and hardened, which may be brought to powder, accordyng as you wyll applye and vse the same. For when much moysture shall be, in the drawing foorth, then after the seperation of the wyne, is it a noate or token, that the spirit of the wyne was not syncere and pure. But where the spyrit of the wyne shall be sufficient myghtye, and that in the ende of the distyllation, no waterynesse remayneth and insueth, then take the distylled water of the same symple, and poure to that drawne, and myxe dylligentlye togyther with a quyll or Feather, that the spirit yet remayning or left behynde in the matter, maye be myxed togyther with the water poured forth: then drawe againe by Lymbecke, the water poured forth, and the same may you so often repeate, vntyll no spirit of the wyne be fealt or perceyued in the drawing, the which lyke may thus be knowne or proued.

When no wine mixture of the spirit is dystilled togither with the water, but a pure water onely, then may you iudge and perceyue, that the same to be sufficient.
               But I doe counsell (sayth the Aucthour) &amp; the same also is of vse and practise, that to the draft or substance of the hearbs, let the proper water be poured▪ yet afore distylled apart, euen as I have above vttered in the drawing of the Sage. And in the same maner maye the spirites of the wine be gotten, as by pouring the water of the Sage distylled in the ende, and very well mixed togyther, and seperated againe. And such a drawing foorth is excellent, and is preserued many yeares.
               An order and waye by which the iuyce, of eache hearbe, may be obtained: as in the distylled water of any hearbe, powre the drye hearbe powdered, which infuse in hote water for a time, but boyle it nothing at all. After straine the same, then into the strayning powre againe the drye hearbe of the same kind in powder, &amp; lyke infused, straine againe, which often repeate, and in the ende distyl it in Balneo Mariae, that the thynner part may be dissolued into a vapour, and that which shall after remaine in the bottome, wyll be so thicke as Honny, and iuyce of the hearbe: and in the Receauer is only gathered, the water of the hearbe: Or thus.
               Of the herbe whose lycour you would distyl presse out the iuyce, &amp; the remnaunt of the expression distilled togither with ye iuyce, the lycor shalbe ye effectuousser &amp; clearer as I heare, sayth D. Gesnerus.
               
               A verie comely maner, and nothing so laborious or painfull, by which the true substaunce, or Quintessence, &amp; the water also may easilye be drawne, out of any Symple, or hearbe, or roote: and this maner also shall serue and be ayte, for diuers fruites, as that the iuyces presed out and putrified.
               Take the roote or hearbe gathered in the aptest time, &amp; dryed in the shadow or ayre, and the same in a cleane vessell, poured in vpō the proper water drawne otherwise by distyllatiō, which infuse so long togyther untyl ye water hath purchased the colour of the infused mater, thē seperate the water into another vessel apart, which keepe close stopped. And to the roote or hearbe poure ye other water distylled, and let them stand againe couered, vnto the chaūging of the colour of the water, thē 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   (aboue taught) seperate the water▪ &amp;

myxe it with the first, which so often repeate, vntyll no more wyll issue forth, and that the roote or hearbe, obtaineth no more strength at all. Which done, the waters gathered in a Cucurbite, distyll in Balneo Mariae, with the head and Receauer set to after Arte, that all the water may ascend &amp; be gathered, and the mater or substance be ingrossed as paste, or a Pultyse. Which when it shall so come vnto, drawe foorth the grosse matter left in the bottome of the Cucurbite, and when you haue poured it into Basen or other cleane vessell, sturre the whole about with a most easy and gentle heate: as nygh to a Furnace, or on hote ymbers, that ye superfluous moysture may by lytle &amp; litle within certaine dayes euaporate foorth, and the same matter attaine the styfnesse of an Electuary, or else of Honny: then haue you purchased the best &amp; most precious substaunce of the matter drawne, or the Quintessence, with which, euen with a most small quantitie, you shall doe more, then with great quantityes of the rootes or hearbes. And let this be kept in a Syluer, or Tynnie vessell close stopped, which the older it shall be before the occupying, the better wyll it be to vse. And further note, that the water drawne by distyllation, no lesse auaileth, then the other waters distylled of the hearbes or rootes.
               
               Another manner, of drawing foorth of substaunces: Take any

drie roote, as the roote of Petasitis, the same brought to fine pouder, &amp; put into a Cucurbite, poure vpon a sufficient quantitie of wyne: the Cucurbite dilligentlie luted, set into Balneo Mariae, and let the wyne be drawne forth. When out of this wyne you shall haue drawne a cuppe meane full, and that the matter which is in the Cucurbyte, shall be cooled, powre then the same water or wyne which you haue drawne foorth, &amp; distyll it againe in Balneo Mariae, and the same repeate or doe thrée tymes ouer, if néede shall be, or oftner, vntyll all the propertie through the decoction shall consist in the wyne. This being done, wring the substaunce gently with the handes, and that pressed foorth dylligentlye kéepe. For this is so precious as Gold: and where you wyl, the substaunce in the glasse maye be set in the Sunne, that the wyne maye euaporate, and an oylinesse onely remaine in the bottome.
               Another maner of drawing foorth, verye singular, of an vncertaine Aucthour: Take your Quintessence, in which infuse your proper simple, or compound for fouretéene houres, grosely brought to pouder, and set rather in a colde place, then hote to infuse: and the proper Quintessence shall drawe to it, the fixed spirit of your matter, and be lyke in propertie to it: and when you shall see the Quintessence coloured, of the matter infused, seperate then the same artificiallie by an instrument, which dylligentlye kéepe in a Glasse, close stopped with waxe.
               Take againe your proper Quintessence symple, and poure it vpon your matter afore infused (which is now seperated, by the instrument) and let it remayne againe to infuse, for ▪xxii
                     •
                  
                  ▪ howres, in a colde place: after it be coloured againe, seperate the Quintessence againe by an instrument, frō the substaunce infused (as you know) &amp; that seperated, adde to the former Quintessence coloured.
               And poure vpon the simple essence of al your substaūce infused▪ &amp; seperate the same so often▪ vntyll your substaunce infused wyll yéeld no more colour, or colour the Quintessence no more.
               Take your Quintessence gathered, which poure into a long necked Cucurbite, setting vpon his Lymbecke or head, &amp; luted accorcording to Arte, set into Balneum Mariae, after distyll the Quintessence with a soft fyre, vntyll you shall see it come vnto the styfnesse of Pappe in the bottome of the Cucurbite, and shall have in the

bottome of the substance infused, the spirit remaining fixed, which gather artificiallie into a Syluer vessell.
               A most singular, and the profitablest manner of drawing iuyces out of hearbes. Take gréene Sage, and drawe a water out of the same by distyllation: or let the dryed Sage be taken, on which powre the water, that from it the subtyller parte maye be seperated, but the grosser Sauge infused, stiepe for certayne dayes, whiche after distyll according to Arte. In this distylled water, stiepe againe the dryed Sauge, in suche manner, that the water maye couer the Sauge, well two or thrée fyngers aboue: and let the whole stande close stopped in a Iugge or potte, that it maye breathe verye lyttle out, in water temperatelye hote. After let the Sauge be pressed foorth, and the Sauge lyke dryed, as above vttered, stiepe againe in this water, and the same repeate thrée or fowre tymes. Which done, let the water be seperated, which vnto another drawing maye aptlye serue, or vnto other vses. And the same drawne, euaporate in an earthen vessell, and that in a Furnace, or some other hote place, vntyll it come vnto such a styfnesse, which best lyketh the practisioner.
               When you wyll purchase the true substannce, out of the Rubarbe, the Ellebore, the Agaricke, the woodde of the Ashe, and other symples of lyke kynde: then procéede in the lyke order, as aboue vttered. As fyrst, powre vpon the spyrit, which infuse so long vntyll it be verie déepe coloured, then powre the same foorth, straine it, and the spirit by litle and lytle seperate in Balneo: and this powre againe to the abouesayde Rubarbe, which infuse for a certaine space in a hote place, vntyll it purchaseth colour, or be coloured, then straine the same, and seperate againe by distyllation in Balneo▪
                   which so often repeate, vntyll the spyrit through the Rubarbe be coloured no more. The same then presse or wring out stronglye, and distyll by Fylter, for it hath or purchaseth after a certaine qualytie of the tenacitye or clamminesse of the Rubarbe, which in the drawing foorthe is vnprofitable, yet many profitable partes of it yssue togyther, which are not to be neglected: and for that cause ought after this manner, to dystyll by Fylter.
               
                  By the beake or nose of the Lymbecke, with a thread draw the Fyltre of a finger breadth cut, so highe vp, that for the strayghtnes of the Nose, the Fyltre wyll no further followe: yet taking héede that in the strong drawing, you breake not the Glasse: which done, powre the spirit to be filtered into the Lymbecke stopped with wet Paper. The spyrit distylled by Fylter, to the drawing, which was afore seperated, powre againe into the Glasse (seeing much cleaueth to the Glasse, for that cause into the first Glasse, into which the spyrit was infused, all the spyrites of the Rubarbe are to be strayned, and vnto the seperation poured) not caring or regarding, that the one drafte, euen now before may be found in the Glasse, for all the draftes are necessarie to be ioyned, and vnto the ende of the water distylled mixed togyther, and seperated againe, vntyl the water be cleare drawne foorth. And the draft may be done, eyther in a drye manner, or in a moyst forme, euen as it shall please any practisioner.
               Out of the wood of the Ashe, is a draft gotten with easye labour, for the spyrit once powred vpon, and the wood stieped in it for foure dayes, after the lycour powred foorth, and other freshe wood put into it as afore, and the same repeated and done for two or thrée tymes, according as you desire a great or lytle yéelde of the draft: after let the lycour be cleared by Fyltre, but seperated by distyllation.
               The extraction or drawing forth of Turbith, of Agaricke, or of any other purging Medicine: take any of the Purgatiues, as the Turbith or Agaricke, or any other with his correctiue: the same thus brought to pouder, put vp into a bagge of fine Lynnen cloth, or white Taffatie, and put eyther bagge, into the same part of the Lymbeck, which sendeth foorth the conieled vapours by the Nose: but into the bottome of the Cucurbite poure on Aqua vitae rectifyed, which contayneth or hath no flewme in it, which distyll by the same; which in the bagges included, are placed in the Lymbecke, &amp; on such wyse is all the property of the Purgatiue drawne foorth. Which done, washe dillygentlye and purelie the bodie, and the water drawne powre againe into the bodye, into whose mouth put a Spunge, and the head set on, distyll the Aqua vitae through a Spunge, and in the bottome wyll a certayne thicke matter lyke

After powre it againe into a vessell with so much water, as afore, and let it be cyrculated for xxiiij. houres in Balneo, and then strayned. These strayninges gathered, powre into a large vessell, which artlie drawe with a head and Receauer annexed, (the water if you wyll, keepe dylligentlye, which wyll serue to other vses,) and when it shall come vnto a thycknesse of Honny, or styfnesse, drawe the same forth, and make Trochises or flatte balles of it after Arte, which vse according to skyll.

Vnto the substaunce pressed foorth adde Sugarcandie, so much as you shall thincke needefull, and lyghtlie in the euaporating in Sande, drye it, vnto the thicknesse of an electuarye.
               Or on such wyse: the infusion of Rubarbe, is commodiouslye wrought, in the iuyces of Borrage &amp; Buglosse. After the infusion for a whole daye in a double vessell, let it be boyled vnto the consumption of a thyrd part away, and then pressed or wringed forth. The iuyce pressed forth, and myxed with Sugarcandie▪ boyle vnto an euen styfnesse. For so may it be preserued and kept, many yeares. The Feces or groundes after the pressing foorth, are not to be throwne awaye: in that there consisteth a great vse of these, in bynding of the bellye, especiallie in the perilous scouring Dysenteria. But the proper iuyse doth verie gentlie louse the belly, yea in Infantes without harme.
               The extraction or drawing foorth of Rubarbe, which the learned D. Gesnerus purchased of a singuler Phisition: the Rubarbe may

in the same maner be infused, as the rootes of the blacke Ellebore, which hereafter shall be vttered and taught: but in the water of Cynamon, and with the syrupe of Roses solutiue, ought the iuyce of Rubarbe be gotten and made.

               Of Xylobeuo, of Theophrastus, of Hohenheim: Fyrst we purchase three kyndes of Medycines, as a Lycour, Gumme, and Alkali. The lycour which yssueth, is lyke to the iuyce of Acacia: the Gum, to that which is named Albotim: Alkali, to the salt Geme. The lycour, is the proper or verye drincke it selfe, the Gum, onely the oyntment: the Alkali, purging and mundifying. After the lycour by the included distyllation, is as the Oyle drawne forth: an ounce or foure ounces of which, are effectuousser and of greater value then a whole Talent, which according to the boyling common of the Phisitions yssueth forth of the wood. In the second manner, the Gum succéedeth the lycour, as out of the same wood, which is remayning, after this manner. Put the Xyloebenum into the inclusiue reuerberation, in the second degree of fyre, and you shall at the ende of .xxiiij. howres sée by and by after the Gum come, which in the same tenacitye or clamminesse with the lyquyde Storax, is seperated from the bodie, &amp; vnto the same through the marueylous sweete sauour (resembled) yet whyles each in the meane whiles consist or rest in the heart, the bodie and Gum may bee molten, of which one pounde, and sixe ounces, bee effectuousser,

then two hundred pounds, which in the boiling are drawne. Last▪ the Alkali is drawne after this maner: The body is chaunged or altered into the vttermost substaunce, which is as the spring and originall of Alkali, and mixing the water of Fumyniter with it, is very well courded, euen lyke Anation or Entali, whose value of one pound and fiue ounces, is accoumpted worthyer then fifty pounds, which are by the common way prepared.
               For the vse, in the beginning, purge the sicke person after this maner: Take of Alkali Xyloebeni halfe a scruple, of the Triacle of Alexandria two drams, these myxe togyther, the dose or quantitye is halfe a scruple. And the selfe same not a fyrst &amp; second tyme, but a thyrd or fowrth tyme, and this acording to the maner of the sicknesse. Further such a vertue of purging, especiallye those payned and dysseased with the Goute, the Palsie, and pustulous humours, hath this Alkali: as the lyke neyther in the laxatiues, purgatiues, &amp; expulsyues is to be found. And the Chyrurgicall way and forme of curing, may alwayes followe and vse this purgation, after this maner. In the beginning whatsoever is open, aptly with the pure Alkali, after annoynt the gumme twyse in the daye, and the same vse so often &amp; so long, vntyll eache are restored to a sound skymme. That if nothing be apparant, that you can euidently sée: there annoint &amp; vse the Gum, where ye paine lur

And wheresoeuer you shall applye and vse it otherwyse, then here prescribed and taught you by vs: you shall with the Emperickes, not without a great expence and dammage, lose both toyle and trauayle.

For the order of curing of the foresayd disseases, cōsisteth not in the maner of dyet, but in the efficacie of the remedyes, as may appeare. Wherefore no cause there is, that by strayte dyet, you appoint here spare meales to the pacient. For this exceedeth all, and not the common vertue of this medicine.

As for example, take of Aloes what quantitye you wyll, which stiepe certaine howres, in a hote place, in some distylled water agréeable, or in dew water, vntyll the same water be coloured, then let thys water be seperated, and new poured vppon, which water after it hath receyued colour of the infusion, powre the same forth, &amp; this so often doe &amp; repeate, vntyll the water wyll no more be coloured or receyue colour.

                  er so great, as is the wyne or common Salt, which dayly and in generall serueth to mans reliefe. For when from simples a grosse flewme is gotten, which for trueth hyndered, how much lesse would they performe their working, that they might be conuerted into a spirituall matter, which in the long distillation, &amp; Fyltring is caused, that they may chaūge by a certayne maner into a fyrie matter. Nor it is to be doubted, that when the symples be so conuerted into a Salte, and the Element of fire hath on such wise dominion in them, but that they also soner pearce, and maye performe the proper action: that such a heape or company of dyuers symples, shall not néede besydes, in the composition of reméedyes. But such Saltes haue certayne properties, by which the other purgers distylled, are in a maner abated and troubled: For euerie Salt, as affyrmeth Theophrastus, purgeth: but the distylled waters of the purgers, lacke or haue not the same propertye, in that the Salt is not ioyned or increased in them. So that I suppose, a great tartnes or sharpnes consisteth in all, which doe chaunge the vryne.
               
                  But the way and maner, by which such Saltes are prepared, is dyuers and sundrye wyse prescribed and taught of Aucthours. For some wyl on this wyse these to be made, as that the symple be gathered in a due time, from which let his proper water be drawn by Balneū Mariae, &amp; the Feces remayning in the bottome, calcyne in the Furnace of reuerberation: the proper water Fyltre many times ouer: the water Fyltred from the grosser matter, poure into a bason, which set in the Sunne, or on hote ashes, that the waterinesse may so breath forth, and the Salt remaine. This lyke may be wrought and done, of all the symples.
               Another maner of drawing the Saltes out of hearbes, or rootes, or any other matter, written in the Germaine tongue. The hearbs or rootes prepared vnto this vse▪ ought afore to be dryed, then burned in a potte vnto an ashie whitenesse. When you shall haue purchased a sufficient store of these Ashes, then powre them into a vessell, on which powre the colde distylled water, or pure &amp; cleare rayne water, letting them so stand to infuse for certayne dayes, in moouing and sturring the whole often about, after Fyltre the water, or let it runne through an Ippocrasse bagge, and on the former Ashes poure newe or freshe water, &amp; the same so often (in the same order, as in the first tyme) repeated, vntyll the Ashes possesse or haue no more sharpnesse in them. Which ended, all the waters gathered, &amp; poured into a Cucurbite, euaporate in Ashes or Sande, and a Salte in the ende remayneth in the bottome, which dyllygentlie 
                     •
                  eepe, for it is precious.
               It is to be enquired whether when this Salt shal be purchased, it were best to burne the hearbes not whollye, nor 
                     ••
                  daynlye, that a Lye may be made of the Ashes: or vnto the halfe burned, whereby a more vertue of the taste, and smell may remaine, and a lesser quantity of the yelde: or at ye ende whether any Masticke may also be added, or any Gum, or any other matter, that being wrought &amp; made glutynous or glewishe, it may the better be preserued, and may also be formed into Pylles: this D. Gesnerus.
               
               Whether the Ashes may be boyled, as of the wormewood, with the water of the same symple distylled, or with the iuyce of the hearbe puryfied &amp; Fyltred: or the same hearbe dryed, which after the infusing boyle togyther a whiles, then straine the whole, for on

such wyse shall you purchase a better sauour and taste: drye Roses maye in the lyke maner, be ordered and prepared. The same Aucthour Ge. Here is to noted, that a certayne person wylleth the drawing of Saltes not to be done with hote water, but rather with colds. After the Ashes drawne, a man may both burne, and calcyne them againe, as aboue taught, and drawe a Salte out of them: and the same so often repeate ouer, vntyll no more taste of Salt be contayned or remaine in them. That if the Salt drawne, be not white, then let it be reuerberated vnto a whitenesse: which thrée maner wayes, are dylligentlye to be noated.
               In the preparing of Salts, this also is worthy to be noated, that the Saltes be verye well purged by Fyltre: which certayne doe Fyltre, well twente and fowre tymes ouer.

Gabriel Fallopij teacheth the like, in his learned booke of bathes, waters &amp; mettals. But ye Salt which he made of the same water, was more sauourly or salty, and sowrer, than the Sea salt, or any salt digged out of th

                   earth. In the large Lake of water, of Aponitana, he placed certain hollow vesselles of flynt, well fowre fingers breadth déepe, which vesselles, besides that they were made hollow vnto such a depth, were also framed square. So that he placed these vessels in ye lake, in such maner, that the water could not enter into it, but stode on the water, well two fingers bredth aboue. After he gotte many earthen pots, which he fylled with that water: then placed he them in those square vesselles, and left them euen there, vntil it came to passe, that the water in those pottes contayned, were wrought and boyled through the heate, and by lytle and lytle euaporated forth: and so long this Philosopher dyd permit or let this water there remaine, that it might boyle, as how long a certayne brightnesse appeared in the water: and he then powred forth that water of the pots, into those hollow stony vessels, in which ye salt coniealed most white, as in the highest vpper face of those vessels: but in the lowest remayned, the mater or substaūce properly named of him Gypsea.

               Of Borace. The .xij. Chapter.
               THE confection of Borace vsed at Venice, a singular secrete: Take of Cowes mylke distylled two pyntes, of clarified Honnye foure ounces, of Saffron three drams, or Salt nyter well purged (that is, pure and somewhat sweete, hauing no sharpnes nor tartenes at all) fowre poundes. Let all these be incorporated with the mylke (that is dyssolued at the fyre) with three pyntes of the water of the strong myxture drayned, through the strongest and best ashes, and myxed stronglie togyther. After poure the whole into a potte glased, which set in a colde (and moyst) place, for one moneth. The stone after found in the bottome, let it be cleansed agayne, and purifyed after this manner: Take of the sayd stone one pounde, of symple water dystylled foure pyntes, the whole dyssolue togyther at the fyre, and purge or skymme the froth of verie cleane, and when no more some or froth shall aryse, euaporate the whole water (that is, caste or poure the same forth, when it shall be through colde) and you shall possesse a most pure and fine Borace.
               A syngular forme and way, in making of the Borace, borrowed out of a Frenche booke written: Take newe Butter of one monethes makyng, or there about, salted, which dylligentlye washe often tymes in cleare water. Of this Butter washed, take one pounde, of the oyle of Tartare thrée pyntes, these after the myxing in the Sunne, poure into an earthen platter or pan glased: which stronglie sturre and labour togyther with a large spatle. After take one pounde of roche Alome, being verye pure and cleare, of Salis nitri Alexandrini halfe a pounde, these also myxe in the hote Sunne, and set abroade at nyght in a cleare ayre: For otherwyse if rayne fall on the whole, or be wette with water, all woulde be

in vaine &amp; come to naught. The vpper face of it onely wyll be coniealed lyke to Christall, ye coniealed take of or away, for the same is the stone laboured and desired. And this may aptly be prepared and made, in the monethes of Iune, Iulie, and August.
               A syngular way of making Borace, that at this daye is in vse with the Goldsmythes, which was brought out of Alexandria vnto the Aucthour, and out of an Italian booke by him, &amp; into Latyn turned. Take of Goates mylke distylled, and poured, into a Glasse bodie, adde to it of roche Alome brought to pouder, that it may easily be dissolued without fire in the water of the mylk. The whole poured into a narrow necked Glasse, let the water be well two fingers breadth aboue the Alome, which close couered, let so stand for fiue or sixe weekes, or vntyll the Alome appeareth a part, which from the water must be seperated or taken, and put into another Glasse. Which thus ordered, take two poundes of Oyle of sweete Almondes, and fowre poundes of the marrow of an Oxe or Cowe: the marrow with the Oyle mixe so togyther, that it maye melt and be dissolued▪ which after straine through a Linnen cloth, &amp; you shall obtaine a thicke Oyle. To this Oile adde the abouesayd Alome, in such maner, that the Oyle couereth two fingers breadth aboue the Alome, the same then set in the Sunne for three monethes, or a longer tyme, which is the better: and on such wyse shall you prepare, and make what quantitie of Boraxe you wyll: and this conceaue, to be a most excellent secrete. For it is the true Boraxe, which is made in Alexandria.
               
               Another composition, out of the same D.H.D. Take of Alome purged from the Feces, which Dyars vse, and of the same with water drayned through strong Ashes, able to beare an egge, make a Lye: after take a quantitie of the past of Boraxe, which you mind to haue, the same put into a vessell, to which powre such a quantitye of scaldyng Lye, as wyll couer the paste, and with Canell let them be wel incorporated togither, then let the whole stand, vntyl the 
                     •
                  eces be setled in the bottome. Which so ordered, ingeniously seperate the Lye, as aboue taught, that the paste maye be well seperated and purged of all groundes and fylthe. After take the whole. Lye (and powre vpon the paste of the Boraxe) these in the boyling in a panne or potte, skymme verye pure and cleane. And

the skimme kéepe a part in a vessel, for in it is an Oyle contained, which kyndled burneth lyke a Candle. That you may rightlye iudge and know of the perfite boyling of the same: instyll certayne droppes of it on a marble stone, or on your nayle, and if it remaine coniealed, it is then sufficient.
               Another perfit way, borowed out of a Goldsmithes booke, of fame with vs: Take of Alome one poūd, which breake in a grosse maner, to it adde of pure &amp; cléere Gum Arabicke one quarter of a pound, verie fyne brought to pouder, of the séedes or corne of Wheate and Barlye, of each one quarter and a halfe, the seedes of the Wheate &amp; Barlie powre into an earthen vessel glased within, which couer with warme Cowe mylke, after set these into whote Horse doong for fiue and fiftye dayes, and at euerie seuen dayes ende, renue it with newe whote doong.
               Another wel lyked, and to be put in vse: Take two partes of auncient oyle Olyue, and one part of new Cow mylke, these after the myxing togyther, powre into a Glasse with a narrowe mouth, to which adde of roche Alome, such a quantity chopped into pieces, so bygge as a Date, that the licours may well be two fingers breadth aboue the Alome, then burie the Glasse in hote Horse doong, for fiftye dayes, and let the doong be sufficient hote all that season, after drye the substaunce in the shadow, &amp;c.
               A speciall paste of Borace: take of white Sope, which finelye raspe or scrape, the same myxe with Honny, &amp; boyle so long togither in an earthen pan, vntyl the whole becommeth tēder: this prooued.
               A worthy confectiō of Boraxe: take of roche Alome, two ounces, and resolue two ounces of Salt Alkali dissolued, which put into a Tyn vessel, ouer a soft fyre to boyle, for halfe an houre: after draw forth the water, &amp; myxe with the same two ounces of Salt Geme brought to pouder, and so much of Salt Alkali, and of Honny two pyntes, and one pynt of Cow mylke: these then set in the Sun for thrée dayes, and you shall purchase stones.
               Another speciall manner, and that good, is thus made perfyte, vnto all iudgementes. Take of Salt Armoniacke, one ounce, of Gumme Arabicke two ounces, of Masticke, and of roche Alome, of each halfe an ounce, of Salt nitre one ounce, of cōmon Salt two ounces, of Tartare calcyned one ounce: all these finelye brought to

pouder, poure into a Glasse with vryne, which boyle vntyll it be thycke.
            
            
               Of potable Golde, of the oyle of Golde, and pouder of the Sunne, or the Golde of Lyfe. The .xiij. Chapter.
               THE auncient Philosophers in tymes past, had diuers opinions in the dyssoluing of Golde, and yet vnto this day, the same not of the learned fullye vttered, whether so pure and perfyte substaunce, as the Golde is, may be purchased by mans industrye with any Arte, force, and propertie of fire, to be resolued into a perfyter and purer lycour. For which cause, wée shall here vnder vtter certayne disputacions and argumentes of this kynde, euen as we founde them written in scroules, in the treasure of Euonymus. And all those in a manner are propouned, of learned men, on eyther part by their Letters familyarlye written to D. Gesnerus. And first of all doth a certayne, most syngular Phisition of great report and fame with vs, defende thus the Negatyue part. If so be (sayth he) an Oyle of Golde may be prepared and made, then the Alchymisters woulde obtayne and possesse all thinges. For neyther an Oyle, nor water is purchased, except it be reduced into a spirit, and the substaunce of the same perfitly mixt dissolued. The same whether it may be compassed and done, I beseeche you to reuolue and ponder, according to your learned and Philosophicall vnderstanding. Yet may Golde be dyssolued, and into verie small partes, in so much that with the lycour in the distyllation▪ as they name it, it may ascende: Notwithstanding, certaine it is, that the substaunce of Golde doth remayne. And many thinges there be, which so dyssolue the Golde, that they reduce it into verye small partes. But do drawe a water or oyle, out of Golde, the skylfull practysioners know: yet beleeue meacute;e, that none hytherto, which affirmed this, performed the matter in deede: which if he coulde or knew the same, he would be rytcher then Croesus. I doe not denye, but that a stone and tinctures maye be wrought and done: yet consider a lytle I praye you, that these be but tryfles, and to small purpose, So that howe in a Golden vessell, the keuer of

These hytherto be the wordes, which a singular Phisition wrote vnto D. Gesnerus, of the oyle of Golde.
               The lyke wrote another learned, vnto the same Gesnerus, yet otherwyse he wrote after this sentence: that what shall I wryte and vtter of the dy

                  ryuolous persons, which if those helped, or serued vnto the matter, then loseth he both oyle and labour. That Golde may be reduced into verye small partes, and be so caused lyquide, and that the nature of the Golde may be conuerted in a spyrit and oyle, the Alchymistycall hope, and not the

                  eueth it selfe, alloweth it to be performed and done. Yet the Gold brought into verye small partes, and reduced into the fyrst Elementes purest, maye so be made potable: but the same (not vnder the fourme of water or oyle) seeing it maye through the myrion, cause other mettals to be the better, and as it were to alter, which I doe not denye, yet graunt I not the same to be any thing at all, as they affyrme of the Philosophers stone. But of the water and Oyle of Golde, which they so conninglye vtter and teache. I am out of doubte and sure, the same to be wholye vntrue.

With those flowers of the gold, take vyneger of the best wyne distylled, and put these flowers in a glasse, then set it to putrifie for fouretéene dayes, after powre forth the vyneger coloured, and powre vpon newe vyneger, sturring it well, after let the same throughly settle, then let the vyneger in the ende be chaunged againe, powring vpon other, and the same so often repeate, vntyll no more remaineth in the bottome of the Glasse, &amp; that the whole be dyssolued into the vyneger.

               The potable Golde, sayeth the singular Fiorauante, is a dyuine lycour, to which none other may be compared, that the auncient, and later Philosophe

                  selye sought and laboured to dissolue and make this pocion of Gold, and haue also attempted dyuers and sundry wayes: of which some of them I wyll here reherse, to the ende that the wyfe may iudge, which way (of these) seemeth best. For some there were, that before the distyllation, dyd diuer slie calcyne the Golde, to bring it to dissoluing: others there were, which laboured to dissolue the Golde with Aqua fortis and others after the calcyning, haue indeuoured to dissolue the Golde with Aqua vitae: and thus many haue trauayled without lyght, in the searche of the Arte, hauing neyther knowledge, skyll, nor yet experience. And this co

                  ceyue, that all those matters which are possible to be done are wrought with great easinesse: and in the lyke maner, is the dyssolucion of Gold easilye wrought, Wherefore I wyll here vtter &amp; teache an easie maner, and sure way of making this most precious lycour, so greatlye and highlye esteemed of mortall creatures, not without desart: in that the same is a substantial essence, &amp; as it were another Soule, yea our lyfe this potable Gold may be named▪ for the sundry effectes, ryght wonderfull, that it in desperate cases hath wrought. Take of Gold leaues, or leafe Gold, in wayght one ounce: after get a byg and well fleshed Hen, or male Pullet, which after the kylling, pull, and take forth the bowels &amp; other▪refuse, the body yet warme, then open or cut holes in many parts of the body, where most flesh is, as on the breast, the legs, and vnder the winges. These partes stuffe &amp; fyll with the leafe Gold, vntyll all be full, or that the whole be bestowed. Which done set this Hen or pullet into an apt place, where for sixe &amp; thirty howers the bodye maye retaine or keepe a naturall heate, that the Golde maye so be dyssolued into a water: for there is a certayne hydde propertye in the Hennes or Pullettes fleshe, for the dyssoluing of Gold into a water. Which time ended take the body forth, &amp; wash all the fleshe of the Hen or Pullet so throughly round about, and

In the ende, distyll the Feces in ashes or sand, with a strong fyre, that all the substaunce may the better ascende and yssue forth. But in the distyllacion of the Feces, this remember, that on the Feces must halfe a pynt of the fynest Aqua vitae be afore powred, and the same which shall be distylled, powre and mixe with the other, that was kept in the first draft▪ these distyll againe in Balneo Mariae, vntyl all be distilled: which set againe into hote Horse doong, for .xxv. dayes, and then haue you purchased potable Golde, easilye prepared, &amp; with small cost: which by his maruaylous propertye and great vertue, rayseth in a maner the dead. The vse &amp; maner of ministring it, is on this wise: Take one dram of the potable Gold, with one ounce of the Inleppe of Violets mixed togyther. And this composition may be giuen in Broth, or with any water, or by it selfe, without any other mixture or lycour. And if any sicke person be at the poynt of death, in giuing such a lycour, shall lyue a farre longer tyme, then perhappes he might doe without it: and many by the dryncking of it, haue recouered lyfe and health a long tyme after, by which may well appeare, of what importance this is for the Aged, to lyue one, or two, or fowre dayes after the taking, for the better dysposing of theyr goodes and wyll: besydes this greatly auaileth, vnto the restoring of strength. This also hath caused the speachlesse, in extreame daunger, to speake and vtter theyr mindes before death, of which (this Fiorauante) sawe sundrye in the lyke case.

               Another maner of Theophrastus, for potable Golde: the Golde must be dyssolued (as into most thinne plates driue
                     •
                  , and shredded verye small) in Aqua fortis agréeable (as foure tymes purged from the Feces; named Royall) and washed from the sharpnesse with sweete water dystylled, after the dyssoluing dryed, of which take thrée drams of Aqua vitae purchased of Homry three pyntes,

these powre togyther into a Cucurbyte dylligently luted about, &amp; the mouth very well sealed or stopped, &amp; set on ymbers, or a gentle fyre for fowre and twenty howers, let the same then most easilye boyle. For on such wyse is the Sonne or Golde dyssolued in this water, whose vse is as you learne of the others.
               A most noble maner of potable Golde, verye rare and secrete. First let an Orrenge be made hollowe, in taking forth the pulpe and seedes, into which put leaues of Golde, not dryuen vnto the vttermost thynnesse, so much as shall seeme needefull. Then the iuyce of the Orrenge or Lemmon pressed forth, and powred to the Golde leaues, let the Apple be close couered with his cappe or keuer, &amp; set in a hote place, or by a Furnace, for fiue or eyght dayes. In this maner doe they affirme the Golde to be brought into an Oyle. Which done, let the iuyce be seperated from the oyle, and the Oyle mixed togyther with the strongest Aqua vitae, which sometymes must be seperated againe by dystyllacion from the oyle. And the iudgement of the perfection of the oyle, is learned after this maner: let a lytle of the Oyle be annoynted on a piece of fleshe, which if it gylde not the same, but pierceth vnto the déepe partes of it, so that no shewe of Golde any where appeareth, then is the distyllacion and working cunninglye handled. And the singular practisioners affyrme this Oyle, to exceede both in vertue and propertie, any other potable Golde, howe so euer the same shall be prepared.
               A potable Gold borrowed out of an Italian Pamphlet: take of the Pomeyse stone brought to powder two poundes, of the finest Golde in leaues eyght ounces, these verye well labour togyther, after take other fowre poundes of the sayde stone in powder, without golde, then let a Bed be made of the Pomeyse, and another on this course, of the Pomeyse with the Golde, proceeding by lyke order agayne, in a glased Potte luted, that no ayre breath forth: which done, set the Pot in a Furnace, making vnder a temperate fyre for fortie dayes, after drawe forth the water of Lyfe, as you knowe, that is, powre the water of Lyfe on it, and the golde as an Oyle shall ascende.
               A potable Golde, which is reported, to haue bene prepared of Raymunde Lullie. He tooke of the purest Gold, so much as he

thought néedefull, which in Aqua fortis (dyssoluing especially gold) be first dyssolued, but after he drewe forth a water and spyrites by distyllation, vnto the through drying of the matter, wrought wholye after the maner of precypitate, practised in our tyme. The same thus dryed, he after in a wyne Seller brought into an Oyle (which he perfourmed by the fift daye) and myxing it with other apte matters, gaue it to drincke. This is easye to be done, and a spéedie way, and well to be regarded.
               
               A potable Golde is thus made, borrowed out of an auncient Alchymie booke written. Potable Golde must bée made in the same manner, as afore vttered, where out of the same boo
                     •
                  e, wee haue taught the way, to make the oyle of Vitryoll. And in the same manner maye all precious stones be brought and made potable, not by adding Mercurie, but onely Sulphure or Brymstone. Therefore take what precious Stone you wyll, and the same grynde verye fine on a Marble stone, to it then adde so much wayght of Sulfure vyue most finely grynded, these powred into a

Crucyble, set after on quick coales, vntyll the Crucyble become so red, as a burning coale, and that the Brymstone be burned &amp; breathed forth. This powder remayning powre againe on a Marble stone, to which adde a lyke wayght of Brimstone, these worke the lyke, as aboue taught, &amp; doe the same againe a thyrde tyme: which done, thy stone then shall be sufficient prepared. Of this powder, take halfe a dramme, and of the foresayde water thrée ounces, these powre togyther into a lyttle Glasse, and cause the water to waxe whyte, and thy stone after shall remayne as paste, to which then adde the water of Lyfe, and you shall possesse the precious Stone potable. Such potable Stones doe myghtylye auayle agaynst dyuers affectes and sycknesses of the Body.
               A Medycine reuealed of God, for the preseruing of mannes health, and lyfe, a long tyme: yea, resysting the Leprye, and contayning in it many marueylous and bydde vertues. Take of the purest Golde brought into verye fyne powder thrée drams, of chosen Baulme, one dramme, of chosen Myrre, of Aloes Hepaticke, of Frankencense, and of pure Ladamum, of eache two drammes, of Camphora, fyue drammes, let the whole bee wrought and made with the Oyle of Mandrake Apples, and Baulme, myxed togyther. Of this Medycine let the Pacient receyue one dramme, or halfe a dramme once in a moneth, and dryncke on it a Glasse full of burnyng Wyne myxed with the water of Buglosse, and Rosemarye flowers, myxed and dystylled togyther by a Lymbecke. This is a royall and famous medycine, whose myghtie prayses are innumerable, and not

                  ytte to bée communicated to the vnworthy. This also is compared, to potable Golde: yet if pure Golde were resolued into a water without corrosyues, and myxed with the abouesayde matters, it woulde be a muche preciousser medycine. If any also woulde preserue youth a long tyme, and coulde not compasse or attaine the lyke medycine, let him vse Chebulis preserued with his syrupe.
               Another potable Golde, most excellent: before any other▪ take of the oldest wyne so much as shall suffice, the same powre into a glasse Lymbecke, after lute the head &amp; body togyther in the ioynt, &amp; the Receauer in lyke maner, then let the distyllation be done in

                  Balneo Mariae, by seperating the fowre Elementes from it: as the fyrst water comming forth, shall be sharpe tending vnto an vnsauerye taste, which is nothing woorth▪ The second water shall be most sharpe, felt lyke fyre, which also is vnprofitable. The thyrd shall be swéete in taste, &amp; the same is the best, for that is an Ayereall matter. The fourth water wyll be altogyther vnsauery, which is nothing woorth, and is named earth. Nowe take of the abouesayde swéete water, as the Ayereall matter fyue ounces, of the purest Golde dryuen into verye thynne plates, and clypped into lyttle pieces, one ounce and a halfe, these powre togyther into a small Glasse Lymbecke, verye well fenced with Lute in the bottome, which distyll by the space of fyue dayes, with the lyght of fowre Candles: as the fygure here vnder to the eye, playner demonstrateth.
               
               The fyue dayes being ended, remooue the flame or lyght, and put vnder a meane fyre of coales, for the space of fowre and twentye howers, and the whole water shall passe or fall into the Receauer, and the Golde shall r

                  mayne in the bottome of the Lymbecke, being then a most cleare Oyle, which is the true and syncere Gold potable, and most precious for the vse of Phisicke. It is a certaine skylfull man often vsed, without the commyxion of others, with the water of Lyfe. And it auayleth or cureth the shedding of teares of the eyes, if into the outward corner of his eye, the pacient lying vpryght, a droppe or halfe droppe of it be distylled.
               
                  VVhere you see the candelsticke stande, there must the burning flame, with the foure lyghtes be set.
                  
And an olde deafenesse is holpen (but whether procéeded of any cause, I can not ryghtly affyrme) by distylling one drop after arte

into the eare. It throughly healeth the French scabbe, if the heads of the pushes be afore clypped, and the scarres annoynted with the same, after this maner. If the pushes shall be olde, then these ought fyrst to be lowe seared away with a burning Iron, or déepe clypped with a payre of shéeres: after the vlcered places, annoynted with the onely Oyle. That if the pushes shalbe new then annoint the oyle onely on them: &amp; in this maner many, were restored as by a sure practise, sundrie tymes experienced. This Oyle mixed togyther with the water of Lyfe appropriated with a proporcion in a maner sixe tymes, or eyght tymes so much of the water vnto the oyle, doth auayle against all distillations of the head, especially the colde, that is, the suffocatyue or choking Rewmes. But on such wyse it must be myxed togyther, that a droppe of the oyle of Gold be instylled, into the water of Lyfe, &amp; mightylie shaken togyther, vntyll the water of Lyfe through the gold purchaseth a red colour, yet verye cleare, and to be seene through. The same Oyle prepared with the water of lyfe, and then myxed togyther with Goates mylke, so long laboured, vntyll the mylke be coloured, helpeth swellynges, and sores of the mouth, and throte, if it be sundrye tymes gargelled in the throte. For the preseruacion of health, let sixe or eyght droppes be gyuen or taken euerye wéeke, or fowretéene dayes, for a tyme togyther. But in the curing of a sicknesse, let then be mynistred halfe, or a whole sponefull at a tyme to the pacient: as he which shal be vexed with the Palsie, or falling sicknesse, or crampe, or with a lyke griefe, shall through this be cured. To be briefe, the propertyes of it are, to inforce, purge also, and strengthen. He which hath this Oyle, in a redynesse prepared, wyll neuer sell the pure to any, but rather prepared alwayes with the water of lyfe: which euermore must be mynistred in the same proportion, as afore vttered. He solde one ounce of the same, neuer lesser, then two crownes.
               A syngular oyle of Golde: let the leaues of Golde be stieped in the iuyce of Lemmons (but whether in vyneger, especially distylled) and by the waterie humour in the distyllation drawne forth: yet (what yf Pearles, and Corralles be added) then remayneth in the bottome, lyke Butter. The same wyne myxed, purchaseth to it a Golden colour, and maketh it sharpe, and doth maruaylously

For better credite of these, make a proofe, &amp; you shall well perceyue that I haue wrytten &amp; vttered a truth to you (as reporteth a certayne learned man, in his letter written vnto D. Gesnerus) which I nothing doubte you shall well lyke, and not dyscommende the vse of Golde. This remedye and practise, euen as the Oyle of Vitryoll, which maye bee reduced into Golde, greatlye auayleth in the Leprosie, and such which are destroyed, by the Mercuriall annoyntings of those men, which (as Hippocrates wryteth) purchase money by theyr blinde practyse and ygnoraunce.
               An Oyle of Gold, being the secrete of a certayne syngular practysioner with vs, which D. Gesnerus obtained of a certaine friend, of that condicion, that he would not communicate or vtter the secrete to any other. The Golde must be dyssolued into a water, but with what sharpe remedyes I knowe not: thus dyssolued, it cannot on the fyre be eleuated and distylled through the wayght of the same, but through a lyttle burning water rectifyed, powred into it, which by and by without fyre ascendeth (so that speedilye must a Receauer be set vnder) and seperated from that other matter eating or freting it, by which it had bene afore dyssolued into a water.
               A great secrete of the oyle of Golde, inuented by a man singularlye practised, in this kynde of distyllation. Fyrst of all, for this working, prepare a Glasse cuppe, or other vessell with the best red wyne, fylled euen vnto the toppe or brymme, which you shall then set into another vessell fylled with the coldest water, especially if the worcke be attempted, and begunne in the Summer tyme: for howe much colder the wyne then shalbe, &amp; so much the more yelde of the Oyle: but how much the hoter, so much the lesser yelde, or nothing at all can be purchased. And on this Cuppe set the greater square, and large, yet a thynne yron plate, as the figure noted with the letter A. Doth plainer demonstrate, hauing in the middle of it a round hole, and large. Into this great hole by and by put &amp; frame a déepe dyshe, or vessell of Copper, lyke to D. expressed, or of Gold lyke to the letter F. or of any other matter framed (for made of Copper, and Oyle of Copper is obtayned, euen as of the Golden,

                     B. Doeth here represent the Cyrcle, which doeth expresse and shewe a lesser hole, for the Cuppe or small vessel to stande in.
                  
                     
                     
                  
                  
                     C. Doth here declare and shew the keuer of the vessell, hauing a ryng in the myddle.
                  
                     D. Doth here demonstrate the narrowe vessell, agréeing to the Cyrcle B. with the keuer &amp; handle (as aboue sayd) standing upright.
                  
                  
                     E. Doth here denote the keuer of the same vessell aboue, being hollowe, with a handle retching both aboue and beneath.
                  
                     F. Doth here expresse a greater vessell, set immediatly on the great and myddle hole.
                  A dyscripcion of the Golde of Lyfe, or powder of the Sonne. Take of Mercurie fowre ounces and a halfe, or fyue, which let be throughlie washed with Vineger &amp; Salt, of the Hungariane Gold halfe an ounce, of these let a Amalgama be made, lyke to the same which the Goldsmyths doe vse to gylde Syluer vesselles, after let the same Amalgama be washed so often with Vyneger and Salt,

vntyll the myxture sendeth forth no more blacknesse at all. This then put into a Glasse bodye, to which after powre so much of Aqua fortis, that the whole Mercurie maye throughlie be dyssolued whereby in the bottome the Golde maye appeare in powder of a redde colour. Then on this body

                      the ioynt, and by distyllacion seperate the Aqua fortis, as fyrst begynning with a soft fyre, next with a stronger, euer increasing the fyre: but last let it be so strong, that ye sand be fyre or burning hote, and that all the spyrites be drawne forth, then let the vessel coole, and after the cooling open the bodye, and you shall finde a powder of a purple colour, in fourme lyke to a certaine * pleasaunt pastri
                        •
                      myxed or wrought togyther. After breake the Glasse, and grynde this pastrye in an open place and frée ayre, on a marble stone to fyne powder, and turne your face from the wynde then blowing on you, because the fume and sauour, is pestyferous and venymous.
                  The calcynation: Take the vessell or déepe Bason sufficient large, noted with the letter B. Which set vnder a hollowe keuer in fashion lyke to a Potte, and framed withsmall holes in the edge beneath round about, as the figure E. hereafter playner demonstrateth: these togyther set in a Goldsmythes Furnace, and suffer that it maye burne darckishe or swartishe in colour: which so prepared, powre a quantitye of this powder with an yron Ladle into the neather vessel, as the porcion of an ounce and a halfe, or two ounces at a tyme, which in the heating sturre dilygentlye with a
                        •
                      yron spatle, and there shall appeare to you (in the doing) sundry
                        •
                      colours, which in the ende, come all vnto a blacke colour, yet then worcke forewarde, and cease not, vntyll the same purchaseth agayne a redde colour. Which colour so appearing, take the su
                        •
                     
                     staunce from the fyre, and let it throughlye coole. These thus orderlye handled, put vnder another vessell lyke to the abouesayde and of the same largenesse as the former was, and the same set into the place of the former, and powre agayne a lyke quantitye of the powder as aboue taught, &amp; let it bée burned in the lyke maner, as aboue vttered, alwayes and continuallye sturring the same about, vntyl al the colours be vanished away, &amp; the same hath obtained a rednesse: for on such wyse, by the benefite of this calcynation,

all the spyrites of the Aqua fortis are dispersed and euaporated away: that by receyuing a porcion of the powder within the body, no harme at all can ensue of the same.
                  In the preparation of this powder, a man must beware of the cō
                     mon Mercurie, which ye Alchymisters truely dye or chaunge in sū
                     dry colours, but without Golde, nor it cannot so mightily calcyne.
                  The dose or quantitye of this powder at a tyme is, that to olde persons about the wayght of an olde pennye (waying so much, as I gesse, as a pease groate,) but to Children of twelue or fouretene yeares of age, so much as an old halepenny wayght, giuen in a wafer cake, that the whole powder may well descende.
                  The Aqua tortis, is thus prepared and made: take of Vitryoll two poundes, of Salt peter, not extincted, and the best, one pound, these in the grynding myxe togyther, &amp; distyll the whole vnto the drawing forth of all the spyrites: and the lyke agayne a seconde tyme, distyll without any addicion, that it may so bee seperated from the grosser spyrites, which on this wyse ordred, the Aqua fortis is then so mightye, that it maye dyssolue the Mercurie, and calcyne the Gold. All these borrowed out of the booke of Casparus Xeglerus Phisition, printed at Lipsia.
                  
                  An explycation of certayne of the former, with fygures expressed, vttered by a certayne singular Phisition.
                  The letter A. which signifyeth the Amalgama, is thus prepared and made, the most pure Golde must be brought or dryuen into thynne plates, the Crucyble after set on the fyre, make red or glowing hote, into which (besyde the fyre) powre the plates of gold and Mercurie, that they may be so myxed togyther, and this myxture is named Amalgama.
                  
                  The letter B. representeth, the bodye set on a hote place: for by that meanes, is the working of Aqua fortis sooner caused.
                  
                  
                     D. Doeth demonstrate a vessell, named properlye a Teste (as I maye conceyue of the fourme) whiche the Germaynes tearme with them, Ein trybscherb, for it expresseth by a certayne manner the same vessell, into which the Barbars opening a veyne,

doe receyue the blood, sauing that this is made of Lattyn, and the same is made of earth, the perfyte forme of which, is here afore expressed.
                  
                  
                     E. Doth here represent a hollow keuer, of the Aucthour named a Teste, which otherwise in the Germaine tongue Ein miiffel. It is artlie made of Brickes and morter, framed like to a lytle Ouen, hauing proper holes made in the edge beneath, passing through, and that rounde about, as this fygure here doth playner demonstrate.
                  
                  
                     F. Doth here wytnesse the goldsmythes Furnace, prepared &amp; made of strong Lute, after the maner here discrybed.
                  This is a descripcion of the pouder of the Sonne or Golde, by a brieffer maner, according to the obseruatiō of the same Aucthour. And in vaine laboureth he in many things, where otherwyse it may be perfourmed with fewe thinges, and a short traueyle. To come to the matter, take a newe and large earthen vessell, with a wyde mouth, as are the Basens of the Barbars, seruing for blood letting, sauing that this ought to bée wyder: the selfe same heated red hote on burning coales, that it may appeare glowing, then bring to fine powder this thy red head gotten by distyllacion, as a lytle afore was taught, and powre the same burned into the vessell, which continually sturre about with an yron spattle, that it may become and procéede from blacke of a swart colour, and in the ende againe of a red colour: by which meanes you shall obtaine, the powder of the Sonne or Gold. But

beware in any maner, that you bée not annoynted and infected with the venymous vapour of the same.
                  Or thus, take the same Amalgama, of which aboue vttere
                        •
                     , the same order, that it may melt into a water, whereby in the bottome the Golde may appeare, after the maner of a red powder. Then Lute dylligentlye the body, in which the distyllacion mu
                        •
                     t bée wrought, and let the same drye by it selfe, that it may the 
                        •
                     eadyer and better abyde the fyre. After set the head on the body, dyllygently luting the cleftes or ioyntes with a piece of Lynnen cloth, and the Lute of wysedome, that the spyrites breathe or yssue not forth. And this conceaue, that if the bodye, in which the Amalgama with the Aqua fortis is contayned, shall be to the bygnesse of one measure, that then the Receauer must be tenne or twelue measures great: For otherwyse through the multitude &amp; strength also of the spyrites, the Receauer would breake. Which thus prepared and done, set the body with his head in the Furnace of reuerberation, in which a fyre of coales must be made, as after ensueth. Fyrst let the fyre be soft, vntyll the spyrites beginne to ascende, after let the fyre be increased by lytle and lytle. For in the ende the Aqua fortis cleareth agayne. And in the vpper part of the Furnace, where the vente holes bee, let the Furnace be stopped, leauing open onely the breathing places.

This also auayleth against the Leprie, helpeth a saltie humour, the disseases of the Legges, a swelling of the Lyuer, and sundrie other grieffes, according to the skyll of the learned Phisition. This also mixed with Aqua vitae, healeth all maner of fylthie woundes, happening on the body by applying of the same on them, when the body shall be well purged. And this is a new remedie, inuented by a singular practisioner, with which marueyles may be wrought.
                  Of Syluer (an oyle I suppose) may be gotten &amp; made, after this maner: Take of Syluer calcyned, so much as you thynke necessarie, the same put into distylled vineger, which within a few dayes wyll be dissolued, and become blewishe: the same then euaporate gentlie in Balneo Mariae, vntyll all the vyneger be ascended, and in the bottome wyll a fayre oyle remayne.
