            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            A Dolorous Expression, of a wofull Breach made in our Church and Policie, By the death of that Honourable, Discreit, and admirably gifted Prelate, PATRICKE FORBES OF CORSE, Late Bishop of Aberdene, Chanceller and Restorer of the Universitie of the same, and worthilie-one of his Majesties Privie Counsell, &amp;c. Who, vnder the hope of a Glorious Resurrection, most chearfully layd downe his Tabernacle, at his Palace in Aberdene, the xxviij of March, 1635.
            
            
               COnsider (Sacred Nyne) the cause why I doe weepe,
               And in this time of publicke Griefe, a doleful cōsort keepe.
               Stricke sad vpon your Lyrs, Threnodicallie sing,
               And let the torrent of your teares match your Castal'an Spring.
               
            
            
               Send out your sighs with myne, as Heralds of our woe.
               To tell the world, wee are injur'd, by man-kynds ruethles Foe,
               Whose hand, alace; hath spoyld our Countreys rarest gemme,
               And slayne Minerva's Minion, sprung from a statelie stemme.
               Who can abstaine from Teares, to see his Shryne enterr'd,
               On whom the Lord, with lib'rall hand, so many Gifts cōferr'd▪
               
               
                  And these in mercie were so seasoned with Grace,
               That every eye saw him a man proportion'd for his place.
               And which adorn'd him much, and did inlarge his fame,
               Hee clearly taught the wayes of God, and walked in the same,
               His thoughts converst with God, his lips were Trueth her keys,
               Authoritie and Courtesie were pincell'd in his eyes.
               And what I ever thought, my pen shall now proclaime,
               Hee was the splendor of our Church, and glorie of his Name.
               Our soveraign Lord, our Church, our Schools, &amp; publick Stat,
               Doe all concurre (through sense of losse) for to condoll this fate.
               For while hee liv'd, his gifts were vsefull for them all:
               But GOD for to afflict the earth, by death did him recall.
               Leaving his darling Church, the Orphane of his care,
               The world the relict of his worth, this Sea an emptie Chaire.
               Yet everie place retaynes▪ Characters, of his worth,
               VVhich ravisht myndes did oft admire, but no hand could set foorth.
               Then, Muse, bee not asham'd, sincerelie to confesse,
               That thou will but obscure his worth if thou preasse to expresse.
               This pearlesse Prelats praise, in whō we saw cōbynd
               
                  Minervas wit, Apollo's tongue, and Phineas zealous mynde.
               An vnrelenting hope, firme fayth, and daring cowrage;
               A Soule devote, a lyfe vnstayn'd, a kyndlie-manlie visage.
               A will propense to good, a just-divyded eare;
               A marble breast, well fortified against th'assaults of Feare:
               A heart enricht with loue, a mynde with deepe conceptions;
               A tongue and pen replenished with ravishing expressions.
               His wit vntyed all knots, his cowrage overcame
               All incident difficulties. Hee ever was the same.
               But since my slow-plum'd Muse, with her vnsassel'd phraises,
               Can not amount the high extent of his deserved praises,
               I will resigne this taske to some Maron'an pen,
               Which can more fitlie celebrate this Quintessence of Men.

                     an quill, can honour him so much,
               As hee will dignifie the same; his worthienesse was such.
               Wherein I dare avow hee hath exceeded all
               That ever did possesse this Chaire, I feare, or ever shall.
               But if that Sions Lord, who treads vpon the Sphears,
               Shal blesse this Church with such a Guide? then i'll recant my Fears.
               And with a heart enlarg'd, praise HIM while I haue breath.
               Who only can fil vp the breach, made by our Prelats death.
            
         
         
            Of His Sepulchre.
            IF halow'd Ashes can renowne a place;
            If Relicts of rare Saincts procure respect:
            If sacred Vessels of great gifts and grace,
            Can viants hearts with deepest groanes affect:
            Then none can looke vpon this Prelates Urne,
            But, with a due respect, must sigh, and mourne:
            And for his worth preferre this sleeping rowme,
            To Mausolus his much admired Tombe.

               No: but lament our losse of thee, with sorrow-sounding breath.
               How can wee cease from teares, when wee remember now,
               The loving aspects of thy face, the terrors of thy brow?
               The first inlyf'd our hearts; the nixt did guarde our sheepe;
               Thy zeale, thy wit, thy actiue care, did all in safetie keepe.
               When thou our Center wast, wee thy Circumference,
               The Rod of Aaron blossom'd faire, by thy wyse influence.
               But now wee languish all, our Halcyon dayes are ended:
               And that most justlie, wee confesse, for happie tyme mispende

                  .
               
                  Our hands were steel'd by thee; thou clear'd our clowdie sight;
               When any thing was out of frame, thou joynted all things right.
               The errant, wilfull, weake thou carefullie observ'd,
               Whom thou reclaym'd, constaain'd, releiv'd, thou all in peace preserv'd.
               Our losse, alace, is gayne, to the Ignatian brood,
               Whose machinations thou forsaw, whose practise thou withstood.
               Since thou removedst hence, they dare accoast our Flocks;
               The wholesome seede that wee haue sowne, there nociue darnell chocks.
               Now at thy emptie Chayre wee stand amaz'd to see,
               So great a Tropicke of our state so suddenlie to bee.

               Wmquhill Commilitons, why should yee thinke it strange,
               To see a Church that's militant, subjected to a change?
               For neyther tyme nor place, is priviledg'd below:
               A Church that wants parallaxes, is in the heavens, yee know.
               And giue the tymes bee evill preserue your owne soules pure:
               That which yee cannot rectifie, with griefe of heart endure.
               Let not your zeale disbend, prooue faithfull in your places;
               Communicete with no mans sinne, set GOD before your faces:
               Who will your paines at last remunerate in loue,
               And place you with the rest of Saincts vpon these Thrones aboue,
               Then let hope of this allay your cresses heere:
               Lift vp your heades, yee drouping Saincts, for your releasse drawes neare.
               I know Viators thinke, their LORD makes long delay:
               But with the weyght of endlesse blesse, Hee'll recompence His stay.

               Yes, I haue stay'd too long;

               Whereof I know one day yee shall sustaine your parts,
               And sing the Praises of the Lambe, with jubilating heartes▪

               Hee heares your cryes, Hee sees your teares, not one of them is lost.

            A SERMON, Preached at the Funerall of the R. R. Father in GOD, PATRICKE FORBES, Late Lord Bishop of Aberdene, In the Cathedrall Church of that Dioces, the 9 of Aprill, 1635; by ROBERT BARON, Doctor and Professor of Divinitie, and one of the Ministers of GOD'S Word in the Burgh of ABERDENE.
            
            
               
                  
                     REVEL. CHAP. xiiij. VERS. 13.
                  
                  Blessed are the dead, which die in the LORD.
               
            
            
               THis Sentence may justlie bee called an Heavenly Sentence; and that not onlie in these generall respects, for the which other passages of Scripture are so called; but also for speciall causes, or reasons. For it was delivered to Saynct Iohn by a voyce from Heaven. It telleth vs, that perfect happinesse is not to be found in earth, but in Heaven; that none may exspect, or attayne therevnto, but these who liue and die in a League with Heaven; and, as it were, in the armes, in the bosome of the King of Heaven; and, that they can not come to it, but by death, which is to them Ianua Coeli, the Gate of Heaven. The LORD furnish vs at this tyme with a competent measure of heavenlie

Grace, and fill our souls with heavenlie thoughts; that this our present exercyse may tende to the glorie of Him that dwelleth in the Heavens, and to our benefit, who exspect one day to see His glorious, His beautifull, and louelie Countenance there.
            In this Sentence we haue onlie two things to consider: to wit, the persons of whom the Spirit of God here speaketh, and the blessednesse attributed vnto them. The persons who are the subject of this proposition, are the godlie, who haue departed this lyfe. Yee haue a description of them in these words, The dead who die in the Lord: where by the dead, wee must not with Ambrose, 
               Or rather, the Author of that Cō
                  mentarie vpon the Revelation, which is falselie attributed to S. Ambrose.
                and Alcazar, vnderstand these who are spirituallie, or misticallie dead to the world, and to sinne: neyther will we follow the phantasticall conceit of Aureolus, who did vnderstand by the dead here spoken of, these who by monastical vowes haue sequestrated themselues from the world, and the ordinarie conversation of men. But wee must here vnderstand these who are naturallie dead, or whose souls are separated frō their bodies. Neither must we limitate the subject of this proposition to those who were dead before S. Iohn heard this voyce in Pathmos; as if blessednesse were here ascribed to them only, others being excluded, who were to die thereafter. But the words of this propositiō must be vnderstood cum ampliatione terminorum, as the Summulists call it: that is, they must be ampliated, or extended to al differences of tyme. For the meaning of this sentence, is, not onlie that the dead who haue alreadie died in the Lord, are blessed; but also, that these who hereafter shall die in the Lord, shall by death attayne vnto perfect Happinesse, and Blessednesse.
            The description of the persons, to whom Blessednesse is here attributed, consisteth of a generall part, cōmon to all; and of a particular part, limitating this

description to the Elect. To die, is common to all: it is the way of all the earth. To die in the Lord,
               Ioshua 13.14. is the way not of all, but of some few, or the last part of that narrow way, which few doe finde.
               Matth. 7.13.14. And to this is another way opposite, which is the way of manie: even that broadway which leadeth to destruction, in the which all doe walke who are not in Christ. So, then, if wee consider the generall part, or the genus of this description, together with the limitation, or difference added therevnto; and if we compare this differēce with its contrarie, (for everie difference hath its contrarie) wee shall haue these three wayes of men mentioned in Scripture; to wit, The way of all, the way of few,
               
                  Via omnium, via paucorum, &amp; via multorum.
                and the way of manie.
            
            As for the generall part of this description set downe in the word dead, I can not let it goe without some observation; neyther can I obserue anie thing so fitly there-anēt, as that same which I haue already touched; to wit, that it is a generall, yea, so general, that it includes all who haue bene before vs in the world, (those beeing excepted, whom GOD extraordinarilie hath exempted from death) and ere it be long shall actuallie include vs all, who are now in it, as also those, who when wee are removed, shall come in our rooms. No Nation, no Province, nor Citie, yea, no ranke nor degree of men, hath exemption frō this cōmon mortalitie, or necessitie of dying: &amp; therefore Hormisdas the Persian, who fled frō his natiue countrey to Rome, in the dayes of Constantius the Emperor,,

                   3. and who was in Rome, when Constantius, after he had overcome Magnentius, and his adherents, entered the citie in a most magnificke and triumphant manner, being asked by the Emperour, vvhat hee thought of that glorious citie, and the rare monumentes hee had seene therein? wittilie replyed, checking the Emperour's pryde, that nothing which he had observed in

               Rome pleased him so well,
                  Id tantum sibi placuisse aiebat, quod homines didicisset ibi quoque mori. Ammianus Marcellinus lib. 16. c. 17. as this, that the inhabitants thereof were mortall, and died as other men.
            This generall and inevitable necessitie of death, is knowne to al, even to the Ethnicks, by an experimentall tradition, almost as olde as the worlde. But the knowledge which we who are Christians haue of it,- as it is more excellent, being more perfect, &amp; grounded vpon supernaturall or divine Revelation; so it obliedgeth vs to make better vse of the cōsideration of death, than others can make. How deficient wee are in this, the profane lyues of manie amongst vs doe sufficientlie declare. Wee die daylie, wee are daylie changed,
               
                  Epist. 3. ad Heliod.
                sayth Ierome, and yet we liue as if we were immortall. Xerxes, when hee viewed his hudge Armie from an eminent place, wept, because within an hundreth years none of all that number should be found alyue. But, O, (sayth Ierome) if we might ascend to such an high mountayne,
               Ibidem. 
               or spy-tower, from whence we might see the whole earth vnder our feet, then I should let you see the ruines of the whole world, the conflicts of nations, the great diversitie of the estates or conditions of men, and that within a short tyme, not onlie such a multitude as Xerxes his armie, but all the men who now are vpon this stage, shall bee removed from it by death. This sight might make anie man weepe, if he would seriouslie consider that which my Text insinuateth, that the greatest part of these who are now vpon this stage, and ere it be long, shall be in their graues, are to passe from the miseries and troubles of this lyfe, to payns endlesse and easelesse in Hell. For this Text attributeth Happinesse onlie to those few, who die in the Lord; and consequentlie declareth, that all others after death are eternallie miserable. But of this I shall speake heere-after.
            I come now to the particular part of this description, set downe in these words, Who die in the Lord.
               
Anent the which, one thing is of it selfe cleare, and manifest; to wit, that it is proper and peculiar to the Elect; and no wayes can bee extended to the wicked, who depart this lyfe. But two thinges doe heere occur, which do need explicatiō: One is, whether or not this particular part bee so ample, as that it comprehendeth all the godlie, or elect? The other is, how, and in what sense, these whom it comprehendeth, are sayd to die in the Lord? As for the first; some popish wryters, because this text, if it be extended to all the Sayncts, who are departed, or shall depart this lyfe, is as contrarie to their doctrine of Purgatorie, as Blessednesse is to Miserie, Rest to Vexation, &amp; Reward of good works to Punishment of sinnes: therfore they craftily labour to restrict the words to the Martyrs, affirming, that by dying in the Lord here, is vnderstood dying for the Lord: and consequentlie, that blessednesse immediatelie after death, is not ascrybed here to all the elect; but onelie to those, who seale their profession with their blood, &amp; are crowned with martyrdome. This glosse may seeme the more probable, because it is followed by some Reformed Divines; by Beza in speciall, &amp; by Piscator, in their Notes vpō this place. Others of our Adversaries doe extend the particular part of this description somewhat farther; and yet not so farre as they should: for they thinke, that it comprehendeth not onlie Martyrs, but also all these Christians whom they call men perfectlie just, or men free of all sinnes, even veniall, and of all guilt of punishment due vnto them for their mortall sinnes. Both these sorts of men, say they, are said to die in the Lord, by way of excellencie; because they are perfectly vnited with Christ; wheras others may be sayde to die partlie in the Lord, in respect of true charitie, or the loue of God, which they carrie with them; &amp; partlie not in the Lord, in respect of their sinnes, which also

they carrie with them. So sayeth Bellarmine, in his first booke,
                  Cap. 12. resp. vd object. 10. 
               De Purgatorio, and diverse Moderne Iesuits following him.
            These restrictions of the particular part of this description, we doe reject; and that not without reason, as ye shall shortly perceaue: and on the contrary, that all Gods deare children may haue their due consolation from this Heavenlie Sentence, we affirme, that the Spirit of God here speaketh of all these, who die in the estate of grace; and proclaimeth them al to be blessed, whatsoever their worldlie estate, or condition hath bene in this lyfe, whatsoever bee the cause of their death, and whatsoever bee their estate, condition, or carriage in death.
            First, I say, all they who die in the estate of grace are happie, whatsoever their worldlie estate hath bene in this lyfe;Iames 2.5. that the poore ones of this world, who are rich in fayth,
               1. Thess. 4.18. may comfort themselues with these words, as well as the great and mightie ones. Worldlie happinesse is not granted vnto them: and their estate is so miserable in the eys of the world, that the rich apprehend a great difference, and put a large distance betwixt them, and the Poore. They wil not suffer them to sit at table with them; nay, not to walk with them, or stand beside them: and whereas they should pittie their wants, oft tymes they laugh and jest at them, according to that of the Poët;

                  
                     Iuvenal. Satyr. 3.
                     Nil habet infelix paupertas durius in se,
                  Quàm quod ridiculos homines facit.
               
But within a short tyme death putteth an end to that difference, and equalleth them in glory &amp; happinesse with kings &amp; Emperors. Ye that are rich, cōsider this, and despyse not the Poore, when ye look vpon their base, and contemptible worldlie estate: but rather be readie to helpe them; remembering this which the Spirit of God here telleth you, That if they die in the

Lord, they shall one day bee participant of that same Kingdome, that same Robe of immortalitie, that same Banquet of Angels, which yee looke for. And therefore holie Augustine, checking the disdaynfull and vncharitable carriage of the Rich towardes the Poore, wittilie &amp; pithilie sayth vnto them;
                  Serm. 2. de tempere.
                
               Wherfore shall not the Poore eate with thee, who shall one day reygne with thee? Wherefore wilt thou not giue so much as thy olde Coat to him, who shall one day receaue the Robe of immortalitie with thee? How is he not worthie of thy Bread, who hath obtayned one and the selfe-same Baptisme with thee? or of the reliques of thy dishes, who is with thee invited to the Banquet of Angels? Be not prowde, then, of your worldlie prerogatiues, neyther apprehend such distance or difference betwixt you and the Poore, as yee doe. The difference which these few worldlie thinges maketh betwixt you and them, is but for a short tyme, and in things of small moment: the matters of greatest consequence God hath made cōmon to rich and poore:
                  
                     Duo optima, Duo pessima.

                        culosissima.
                  
                even the two best thinges that can befall men, to wit, grace &amp; glorie; the two worst things, to wit, sinne and damnation; and the two most dangerous things, to wit, death and judgement. The Poore are not excluded from the first two, more than the Rich; neyther are the Rich exempted from the other two, more than the Poore. And as for the last two, neyther Rich nor Poore can eschew them. For it is appoynted vnto men, once to die; but after this the judgement. Such like,Heb. 9.27. ye that are poore in this world, and rich in faith, possesse your soules in patience, and bee not grieved because the Rich &amp; ye meet vnequall vpon the streets; for ye shal meet equall with them a

                   illo, in that

morning of Resurrection, when by the bright appearance of the Sunne of Righteousnesse, these thinges which now are invisible, during this night of ignorance, shall be brought to light: to wit, the hid things of darknesse,
               1. Cor. 4.5. 
               the secret counsels of the heart, the mysteries of Gods providence in governing the world, and the glorie, happinesse, and excellencie of the sonnes of God.1. Iohn, 3.2 For although we be the sonnes of God, yet it doeth not appeare what we shall be: that is, how happie &amp; glorious wee shall bee in the world to come. But in that Day it shall appeare to all; and the wicked shall see it, with vnspeakable grief, &amp; astonishment; &amp; shal say of the godlie mā whom before they despised; This was he whom we had sometyms in derision, &amp; a proverbe of reproach: we fools accounted his lyfe madnesse, and his ende to be without honour.

                   is amongst the Sayncts.
            
            Secondlie, I say, all these who die in the estate of grace, are happie, whatsoever the cause of their death be: that is, whether they die as Martyrs for the Lord, or as ordinary professors in the Lord. For, first, as for the matter it selfe, although the Martyrs haue an eminent degree of glorie in Heavē aboue manie others, which the School-men, by a barbarous word of their own devysing, call aureolam martyrum; yet neyther is Blessednesse immediatelie after death appoynted onelie for them, even by the confession of our Adversaries; nor yet is that wherein the glorie &amp; excellencie of martyrdome chiefelie consisteth, altogether proper, and peculiar to them; but, in some sort, common to other Sayncts. The dignitie and excellencie of martyrdom standeth in two things;
                  Ad Martyrium completum duo conc
                        •
                     rrunt: Iusta voluntas, &amp; justa causa. In 4. 
                     〈…〉
                  
                which, as Bonaventur sayth, doe make vp a compleat martyrdom: First, in a pious willingnesse, or desire to vndergoe whatsoever tribulation, yea▪ death it selfe, for the testimony of Christ, if God should require it. Secondlie, in the goodnesse

of the cause wherfore we suffer. For Martyres non facit poena, sed causa, sayeth holie Augustine;
                  Conc. 2. in Psal. 34. it is not the suffering, but the cause of suffering, which maketh the Martyr. Now, the cause of suffering is two-fold; to wit, Causa calamitatis, the cause wherfore the calamitie cōmeth vpon the Martyr, and Causa tolerantiae,
               
                  Causa calamitatis, &amp; causa tolerantiae.
                
               seu patientiae, the cause wherefore he willinglie doeth vndergoe and endure it. The dignitie and glorie of Martyrdome dependeth as much from the second, as from the first; and perhaps more: For although a man be persecuted for a good cause; that is, for professiō of the trueth; yet if the cause or motiue, which maketh him to vndergoe persecution, be bad &amp; perverse; as for example,
                  Timeo dicere, sed dicendū est, Martyrium ipsum si ideo fiat, ut admirationi &amp; laudi habeamur à fratribus; frustra sanguis effusus est. Comment. in Gal. 5. 
               If hee suffer onlie or chieflie that he may be praised or admired of men, he sheddeth his blood in vayne, as Ierome sayth. Now, to apply all this to the present purpose: Manie who doe not actuallie suffer death for the cause of Christ, haue in some sort both these two things, wherein the glorie &amp; dignitie of Martyrdome chieflie consisteth: to wit, First, a pious willingnesse or readinesse to suffer the losse of all things; yea, of lyfe it selfe, for Christ's sake: which is a thing so acceptable and gracious in the sight of God, that Hee esteemeth this a kynd of dying for His sake. And therefore Chrysostome wryting vpon these words, (ROM. 8.36.) For thy sake we are killed al the day long; we are coūted as sheep for the slaughter, sayeth,
                  Serm. 15. in epist. ad Rom.
                that although we actually can die but once, for the Lord's sake; yet God hath granted this to vs, that if wee bee readie or willing to die for Him, we may, by vertue of this our resolution and willingnesse, die everie day for Him; yea, everie day we may die manie tymes for Him; and so obtayne not one, but manie crowns of Martyrdome herafter. Secondlie, as for the cause of the ordinarie sufferings of true Christians▪ although in tyme of their troubles or distresses,

the evill, or calamitie doth not always come vpon them for the Lord's sake; yet it is for the Lords sake that they patientlie suffer it. And whē they die, although we cannot say, that they are put to death for the Lord's cause; yet wee may say, that they accept of death, and suffer willinglie all the pains of it, for the Lords cause; (to wit, because it is the Lords will, and because they long to bee with Him:) and consequentlie wee may even say, in some sort, that they die for the Lord. Hence it is, that divers of the Fathers haue extēded this glorious title of Martyrdome, to those who died not for the cause of Christ, as to the blessed Virgine, to the penitent Thiefe, yea, in generall, to all Sayncts

            Next, as to the Apostles phrase; although the particle, in the Lord, be sometymes taken as all one with for the Lord, yet in phrases lyke to this, which the Apostle here vseth,Ioh. 15.4 5.6.7. Rom. 8.1. and 16.7. 1. Cor. 15.18. 1. Thess. 4.14. and 16. such as to be in Christ, to abyde in Christ, to sleepe in Christ, or to bee asleepe in Him, it is not so taken, but onelie importeth the vnion of the faythfull with Christ, or else the continuance of that vnion: so that the restriction of this text to Martyrs, who die for the Lord, is violent, and repugnant to the natiue, or ordinary sense of the phrase. But although it were not violent, yet we would haue sufficient reason to reject it; for phrases of sacred Scripture ought not to bee restricted, nor yet extended beyond their ordinarie signification, except vpon solid &amp; evident warrand or reason frō the analogie of fayth, or from the Text it selfe. But no such reason can be brought to proue, that the Apostle is here speaking onelie of Martyrs, as some of the most famous Popish wryters

doe confesse:
                  Ribera▪ Viegas, Cornel. à Lapide, and Estius, all wryting vpon this place. yea, the Iesuit, Cornelius à Lapide, speaking of these wryters, who extend the words of this text to all the godlie, sayeth, that they interpret this text plenius &amp; planius, more playnlie, and more fullie. And as for the judgement of the best &amp; most famous interpreters of this book, we haue manie of them for vs; (to wit, Ambrose, Primasius, Andreas Caesariensis, Beda, Richardus de Sancto-Victore, Ioachim. Abbas, Coelius Pannonius, &amp;c.) yea, so manie, that scarce can our Adversaries name one of them, who strictly &amp; precisely adhereth to their exposition. To them we may adde other ancient wryters, who haue spokē occasionally of this text, as S. Augustine, in his 20 booke De civit. Dei, cap. 9. (although the Rhemists imagine that hee favoureth their glosse) Bernard, in diverse places of his workes

                and others.
            Thirdly, I say, al these who die in th'estate of grace are blessed, whatsoever their spiritual estate or cōdition be in the hour of death: for if they be in Christ, there is no cōdemnation to them; yea,Rom. 8.1. they cānot come to condemnation,
               Ioh. 5.24. 
               but are alreadie passed from death vnto lyfe. And if they being fred from sinne, &amp; made the servants of God, haue had their fruit here vnto holinesse,
               Rom. 6.22. what can follow hereafter, but the ende everlasting lyfe? How then can they be condemned after death, to grievous and intollerable payns in Purgatorie? or what may hinder their present admission and enterance into their Masters joy? for al their sinnes are pardoned to them; yea, so pardoned, that God will not remember them any more to punish them Esa. 38.17 43.25. and 44.22. Ezech. 18 22. Mich. 7.19·. I know our adversaries doe speak and think farre otherways of the remission of sinnes, whether they be mortall or veniall, as they call them. For, first, concerning the remission of mortall sinnes, they too boldlie affirme, that although the elect, whē they are first reconciled

to God, or justified in Baptisme, they get a plenarie or full remission, not onlie of their sinnes, but also of the whole punishment due vnto them: yet if they sinne mortally afterwards, vpon their repentance they are fred indeed frō 
               eternall punishment; but in lieu thereof they must endure temporall paynes, &amp; these most grievous, in Purgatorie, if they doe not free themselues from them by voluntarie satisfaction, or penall exercyses in this lyfe. And this they labour to proue, partlie because we finde in Scripture, that God, after hee hath pardoned the great and enormious offences of his servāts, hath inflicted many tymes great temporall punishmēts vpon them; in special, vpon Moses, Aaron,
               Numb. 20.12. 2. Sam. 12. and 24. Psal. 99.8. 1. Cor. 11.31. 
               David, and others: and partlie because the ancient Church observed a severe discipline towardes those who were relapse in mortall sinnes; imposing vpon them long and paynfull exercyses of repentance; which they stiled by the name of Satisfaction.
            
            It is no strange thing with our Adversaries, to affirme, that God pardoneth mortall sinnes committed after Baptisme, with a reservation of the temporall punishment, which is only a part of the punishment due vnto them, seeing they are so bold, as to maintaine, that GOD, after this lyfe, pardoneth veniall sinnes, with a reservation of the whole punishment; that is, discharging nothing of the punishment due vnto men for them:

               . Wee haue not learned to distinguish so subtillie betwixt the remission of sinnes, and the remission of the punishment due vnto them. But on the contrarie we hold, &amp; that with most sufficient warrand, both from Scripture and Antiquitie, that when GOD pardoneth our sins, he doth it not with reservation of

a part of the punishment due vnto vs ex rigore justitiae; much lesse of the whole punishment; but dischargeth all punishment of malediction, or pure revenge. As for these calamities or temporal evils, which manie tymes haue beene inflicted vpon the Elect, they cānot serue for that which our Adversaries intende; that is, to proue, that remission of sinnes in Baptisme is more perfect, than it is after Baptisme; or, that the whole punishment is discharged in Baptisme, and not thereafter. For we see by experience, that infants are not fred by Baptisme from sicknesse, death, and other miseries, which were inflicted vpon man-kynde for sinne: and consequentlie the whole temporall punishmēt is not discharged in Baptism, more than after Baptism. They answere to this, That these are not properlie punishmentes, but rather penalities, as they call them;
                  Penalita
                        ••
                     s.
                and that because they are cōmon to all man-kynd, &amp; haue their originall from the naturall constitution of mans bodie. But, first, what is that to the purpose? They were inflicted vpon man-kynd in the wrath of God, for the cōmon transgression of our first parēts: and vnto all these, who are not in Christ, they are most truelie and properlie punishments. Secondlie, we can easilie cloze vp this lurking-hole to our Adversaries. For what if a mā baptized after he hath come to perfect age, haue bene before his baptism plagued by God for his by-gone actuall sinnes, with povertie, blindnesse, lamenesse, or any other grievous sicknesse; will our Adversaries say, that by Baptisme hee shal be fred from them; as they imagine, that Constantine, whē he was baptized by Silvester, was fred from his leprosie? I think they dare not say it: for then, as Aquinas and Durandus doe reason, men would seeke the benefit of Baptisme for worldly respects; to wit,

               
                  Propter impassibilitatē prasentis vita, &amp; non propter gloriam vitae aterna. Aquinas 3. part. Summa. qu. 69. art. 3. Propter commoditatom vitae prasentis, &amp; non propter fructum vita spiritualis. Durandus, in 4. Sent. Dist. 4. Quast. 3. that they may be fred frō temporall miseries; and not for the glorie of eternall lyfe.
            Ye see, then, that this difficultie anent the reservation of temporall punishment, after sinne is remitted, concerneth our Adversaries, as well as vs: and that, for ought we know of God his dealing with men in baptisme, &amp; in penitential reconciliation after baptisme, temporall punishment is alyke discharged in both: so that, if baptismall remission free a man from Purgatorie-fire after this life, penitential remission must haue the lyke effect. Wherfore, as our Adversaries do say of these penalities, or temporal miseries, vnto which the baptized are subject after baptisme, that they are not truelie and properlie punishments, (they should say, they are not punishmentes meerlie vindictiue; for indeed they are punishments) that the baptized are still subject to them, for their own weale: especiallie to the effect they may be conformed to Christ their head: that although they remayne after baptismall remission, yet baptismall remission is full and perfect; no wayes exposing the baptized to a necessitie of suffering purgatorie-paynes after this lyfe: &amp;, that although men be not fred frō them presentlie; yet by vertue of baptismall remission, they shall in the world to come, especiallie in the day of resurrection, be fullie fred from them. So we may say, and ought to say, of these temporall afflictions &amp; calamities, vnto which the Elect are subject, after their sinnes are pardoned in penitentiall reconciliation: First, that they are not punishments meerlie vindictiue, or satisfactorie to the justice of God. Secondlie, that they are inflicted vpon them for their weale; to wit, that they may bee vnto them exercyses of their vertues, and meanes wherby they

are conformed vnto Christ their head. Thirdlie, that although they bee inflicted after penitentiall remission, yet penitentiall remission is perfect, and no ways exposeth penitent sinners to a necessitie of suffering purgatorie-payns after this lyfe. And last of al, that although penitent sinners be not fred from them in this lyfe, yet by vertue of penitentiall remission, and of Christs merits, which by it are applyed vnto them, they shall obtayne a totall and perfect deliverance from them in the lyfe to come, when all the stayne, or deformitie of sinne, shall bee fullie purged out. Here indeed such a deliverance cannot be expected: For although our Saviour hath merited vnto vs a deliverance, both from sinne, and also from the punishmēts and consequents of it; yet seeing it hath not pleased God to free vs fullie from sinne in this lyfe, it is not to bee marveled, that wee are not fullie delivered, so long as wee liue here, from these evils and miseries, which are the punishments &amp; consequenrs of sinne. But blessed be God, as we are here fred from the dominion of sinne, so also are we fred frō the malediction of the punishment. And as we shall hereafter be altogether fred from sinne it selfe; so shal we also be fred altogether from the miseries, which are the consequents thereof.
            But, to leaue this, and to come to that other argument, which our Adversaries doe bring agaynst vs, from the severe Discipline observed in the auncient Church, towards those, who had fallen into mortall sinnes after baptisme, and from the long and paynful exercyses of repentance imposed vpon them: truelie it is a wonder that our Adversaries should be so impudent, as to affirme that, that laudable custome of the Ancients doeth make for them; seeing it maketh so manifestly against them. For these penitential exercyses were not by the ancient Church imposed vpon

men after absolution, or remission of sinnes, as means requisit for a removall of temporall punishments, or for deliverance from purgatorie-paynes; but were imposed ordinarily before it, as means requisit for obtayning remission of the sinne it selfe, &amp; deliverance from eternall damnation. For the Fathers gaue not absolution to sinners, vntill such tyme, as they had accomplished penitentiall actions enjoyned: and after absolution was given, they did not anie more impose such pennance vpon them; which I might easilie proue by a cloude of ancient witnesses; but I need not, seeing so manie of our Adversaries doe confesse it

               . By this ye may perceaue, that the Fathers of the ancient Church believed, that in penitentiall reconciliation, there is a full discharge of the whole punishment. For if they had thought otherwayes, they would haue imposed penall exercyses vpon penitentes after they were absolved; to the effect, that by them they might bee fred from these reserved, or vndischarged punishmentes.
            I know Bellarmine sayeth, that those penal exercyses which in the ancient Church preceeded absolution, were imposed ad poenam temporalem expiandam, to the end, that the penitents might be fred frō those temporall punishments, which would haue bene reserved after the remission of their sins, if those satisfactorie exercyses had not preceeded. But this is flat contrarie to the mynde of those Fathers: for they thought, that if those penitentiall exercyses, or satisfactions, as they called them, (but not in that sense, in the which Papists now take this word) did not preceed, nothing of the punishment should bee discharged

vnto the delinquents; and consequentlie, that one part of it, to wit, the temporall punishment, should not bee reserved. Temporall punishment is sayd to bee reserved onlie when the aeternall is discharged; or, as our Adversaries speake, when the aeternall is so remitted, that in liew thereof, temporall punishment is imposed. But the Ancients thought, that, without praecedent satisfaction, by poenall exercyses, aeternall punishmēt is not discharged: or, which is all one, sinne is not remitted:

            Ye haue heard what Popish doctors say concerning the greater, or mortall sinnes of those who die in the Lord, and concerning the temporall punishment which they thinke is ever reserved, when they are remitted after Baptisme. Now I come to the smaller sinnes of the Godlie, which they call Veniall. Our Adversaries say of them, that although a man die in the Lord, yet he may die with the guiltinesse of these sinnes, not having as yet obtayned pardō or remission of them; especially if he die suddenly, or in the rage of a fever: and that in respect hee hath never retracted them by repentance, nor craved pardon for them. In which case, say they, he cannot enter into Heaven immediately after death, (because no polluted or vnclean thing can enter into that glorious Citie) but must,

for a tyme, be tormented in Purgatorie, to th'effect he may be fully cleansed from the guiltinesse of those sinnes. This comfortlesse doctrine of our Adversaries, consisteth of three Assertions, which we shall particularlie, but verie shortlie, consider. The first is, That sinne is never pardoned, except it bee retracted by repentance: or, to vse their owne phrase, except there bee some reall change in the sinner, or some praevious disposition, whereby he is fitted, and prepared, for receaving remission. The second is, That those of the Elect, who die suddenlie, or in a raging Fever, can not haue this praevious disposition, which consisteth in the acts of repentance: and consequently, they die without remission of their veniall sinnes. The third is, That they who die so, must bee purged from their guiltinesse, by suffering Purgatorie-payns.
            
            The first of these Assertions, if it bee taken in its full generalitie, and extended to all Cases, it ought not to bee admitted. For although in that Great and Mayne Iustification, whereby wee are translated from the estate of sinne, into the estate of Grace, mortall sinne is not remitted to those who are come to perfect age, without some reall and intrinsecall alteration in them, or without some praevious disposition, whereby they are disposed, and fitted for it; according to that of holy Augustine,

               He who made thee, without thy consent, and concurrence, doeth not justifie thee without thy consent, and concurrence. Yet it is possible, yea, verie probable, that these smaller sins are sometyms remitted by our Gracious LORD, to those who are alreadie justified, without anie praevious change, or disposition, on their part; especially when by suddentie of death, and indisposition of bodie and mynde, they are impeded from considering, and acknowledging of their offences. This should not seeme strange to

our Adversaries seeing manie of their moderne scholasticke wryters, and those of greatest note, do teach; First, that God, according to the fulnesse of his absolute power, might, if he pleased, remit sinnes both mortall and veniall, without anie infusion of grace, yea, without anie intrinsecall change, or praevious dispositiō
                by repentance in those to whom they are remitted

                     h. Canus, l. 12. de locis, cap. 23. ad 9.. Now, if God, out of the fullnesse of his absolute power, can remit anie sinne, without repentance vpon our part; and if hee sometymes doeth show this fullnesse of his power, together with the greatnesse of his mercie, in pardoning the mortall sinnes of the Elect, without anie praevious act of contrition, when they cannot be remembered, as also in pardoning veniall sinnes without the same, even when they may be easilie remembered; shall we not thinke, that he will dispense with the defect of repentance in them for their veniall sinnes, and supplie it by gracious condonation, when through suddentie of their departure, or through indisposition of body &amp; mind, they are not able to haue it? Manie things in such a case pleade for mercie and favour to the godlie man; yea, pleade more powerfullie and effectuallie with GOD, than aspersion of holie water, Episcopall benediction, or anie other of these things, which Papists call Sacramentalia: to wit, inherent grace, (which is a habituall repentance; for by it wee habituallie detest and forsake all

sinne) the prayer of the faythfull, who are then present with him, the prayer of the Church in generall, which at all tymes recommendeth to God most earnestlie those who are in distresse and danger, eyther temporall, or spirituall; and, aboue all, the intercession of our Lord and Saviour for him in the Heavens. To these wee may adde the prayers of the godlie man himselfe, (who dieth so) by which long before death, preparing himselfe for death, hee most frequentlie and ferventlie besought the Lord, to grant vnto him a happie departure, and a full discharge of all his sinnes before his dissolution. The godly put vp this request to God ordinarilie in their prayers; and consequentlie it is granted vnto them. For seeing the effectuall fervent prayer of the righteous avayleth much;Iames 5.16. and seeing Christ hath tolde vs, that if wee abyde in him, and his wordes abyde in vs,
               Iohn 15.7. 
               wee shall aske what wee will, and it shall bee done vnto vs; it were great follie to to imagine, that the godlie in vayne put vp this request to GOD.
            In the second Assertion of our Adversaries, there is no certaintie at all. For although a godlie man die suddenlie, or in a great rage, and distemper, yet who knoweth what operation the Spirit of God hath secretly vpon his departing soule immediatelie before it bee loosed from the bodie; or what communication hee hath with God, after the passages of his senses are so stopped, that hee can haue no communication with men? It may bee, when hee seemeth to thee altogether senselesse, that then hee is most sensible of his spirituall estate, and is crying, Petcavi, Miserere;
               2. Sam. 24.10. 
               I haue sinned greatlie in that I haue done; and now I beseech thee, O Lord, take away the iniquitie of thy servant. It may be, when hee is speachlesse, and past conference with men, that hee is then entertaining

an heavenlie conference or Dialogue with Christ his Saviour: that hee heareth Christ saying, Surelie, I come quicklie; and is replying, Even so, Come,
               Revel▪ 22.20. 
               Lord Iesus: that hee is saying, Lord, remember me, for now thou art in thy Kingdome: and,Luke 23.42.43. that hee heareth CHRIST rounding in his eare, that which Hee sayd to the penitent thiefe, To day shalt thou be with mee in Paradise. I will not take vpon mee to determine, whether or not these of the godlie who die suddenlie, or in a raging Fever, haue anie such exercyse of prayer and repentance, after they haue lost the vse of their senses: But this one thing I wil say; If God haue decreed to pardon no sin, how small soever, but vpon subsequent repentance, as our Adversaries affirme in their first Assertion, it is more than probable, that GOD granteth that benefit to al the godly before their departure, whatsoever be the manner of their death, or their carriage in death.
            The third Assertion of our Adversaries, which is drawne out of the other two, as a cōclusion from its praemisses, hath but two faultes: one is, that these praemisses, vpon which it is grounded, are not sure. The other is, that although they were infallibly true, yet the conclusion it selfe might bee denyed. For although wee should grant, that repentance by Gods appoyntment and decree, is absolutely necessary for remission of everie sinne, how small soever, and that manie godlie men die without it; yet it will not follow, that they must bee tormented after this lyfe in Purgatorie. For the common and receaved doctrine of the Papists themselues, anent the remission of these veniall sinnes, with which a man dieth, doeth shewe vs a fayre and easie way, to eschew that melancholious and fearfull consequent. For they all (some few being excepted) affirme, that those venial sinnes from

which the Elect are not fred before death, are remitted to them in the verie instant of death, or (which is all one) in that instant, in the which the soule is separated from the bodie. This doctrine was not onlie maintained by Alensis, Thomas, Scotus, Durandus, Almainus, and manie other auncient Schoole-men, (who indeede doe differ verie much amongst themselues, anent the meane or disposition, whereby remission of veniall sinnes is obtained, in that first instant of separation) but also by their most famous late wryters, who haue handled this matter, partlie in their Disputes agaynst vs, and partlie in their Commentaries and Disputes vpon the third part of Thomas his Summe, Quaest. 87.

            Now, if these sinnes bee remitted in the moment of dissolution, what can followe after that moment, but eternitie of blessednesse? For that which did let or impede the present entrance of the godlie man into his Masters joy, to wit, his guiltinesse of veniall sinnes, is removed by Gods gracious condonation, in the verie dissolution of his soule &amp; his bodie, as our Adversaries affirme.

Lament. 3.33., and to the ordinarie conception which men haue of it, (for who would say, that the King did pardon a Traytor, if hee did inflict vpon him all the punishment due vnto him for his treason?) as also to that notable proportion, which is betwixt our deliverance from sinne, and from those miseries, which are the consequents thereof. For, as I observed before, the reason wherefore men are not fully delivered in this lyfe from those punishments, or miseries, which are the consequents of sinne, is because they are not fully fred from sinne it selfe. But in death, as all doe grant, the soule of a good man is fully fred from sinne: nothing remayneth therein, which displeaseth GOD; and that which pleaseth GOD, to wit, inherent righteousnesse, is perfect in it. Hence wee justlie conclude, That as it is fully fred from sinne; so also is it from all the consequents of sinne; and that in respect nothing remayneth in it, which may offende GOD, or provoke Him to doe that which Hee is vnwilling to doe; I meane, to punish.
            
            This also ought to bee confessed by those Popish Wryters, who doe teach, concerning Inherent Grace, That it is so amiable, or louelie a qualitie, in the sight of GOD, that by it selfe, or by its owne naturall force, &amp; not for anie reference which it hath to CHRIST, for whose merits it is infused, it maketh GOD to accept those in whom it is found, vnto aeternall Lyfe, as His Children, and Heyres.

               originall concupiscence, the reliques of vicious acquired habites, the rebellious motions of the flesh, and manie veniall enormities, as they call them; vvhat force shall it haue to make GOD to respect, to loue, to affect tenderlie, the soule of a man after death? and, consequentlie, not to torment, and punish it, when it is fullie fred from all those vicious inclinations, and motions?
            I haue showne you, at great length, (and that because of the perverse opinions of our Adversaries) That to die in the LORD, is common to all the Elect. Nowe I come to that other poynt, vvhich I propounded to bee handled anent the same wordes; that is, to showe you what this phrase, To die in the LORD, (taking it as it is common to all the Godlie) importeth. All those who take it so, agree amongst themselues anent the meaning thereof; to wit, That it is To die in that happie vnion which wee haue with CHRIST by true Fayth, and other Theologicall vertues.
            
            There bee foure thinges, wherein men are sayde to die this bodilie death, mentioned in holie Scripture.
            1. Men die in Adam. 2. Men die eyther in prosperitie, or adversitie; riches, or povertie, or moyen 
                  •
               ondition; in high honour, or in lowe degree; in payne, or without payne, &amp;c. 3. Men are sayde to die in their sinnes. 4. Men are sayd to die in CHRIST.
            The first of these foure, is simplie common to all the children of Adam, by naturall propagation.
            The second is disjunctiuelie common to all.
            The third befalleth all who die without CHRIST.
            
            The fourth appertayneth to them onelie who in in this Text are called blessed: Blessed are they that die in the LORD.
            
            
               The first hath a diverse manner of signification, from the other three.
            For, to die in Adam, signifieth not onelie the coexistence of a man's beeing in Adam, and of his dying; but also the meritorious cause of our death; to wit, That by the sinne of Adam, in whom we all sinned, and from whom wee bring with vs into this worlde originall corruption, wee are all lyable to death. As in Adam all die, (as sayeth the Apostle) even so in CHRIST shall all bee made alyue.
               
                  
                     •
                  . Cor. 15.22.
            
            This dying of all in Adam, is explayned by the same Apostle else-where, By one man sinne entered into the worlde, and death by sinne:
               
                  Rom. 5.12. 
               and so death passed vpon all men, for that all haue sinned. Whereby is evidentlie overthrowne that errour of Pelagius, and his followers, who falselie denyed Death bodilie to haue beene brought in by Sinne: affirming, (as Augustine relateth) That altho Adam had not sinned,
                  Aug. haeres. 88. yet hee had died bodilie death. Which Assertion, as verie pernicious and haereticall, and brought in for denying of originall sinne, was justly condemned, and anathematized, in the second Milevitane Councell.

                   2. can. 1.
            
            The other three, beeing vnderstood of bodilie death, doe signifie rather the estate wherein a man is found when hee dieth. For altho hee who dieth in his sinnes, hath in his sinnes the merite of both the first and second death, yet when a man is sayde to die in his sinnes, is not so much poynted at the cause of his bodilie death, (beeing now common to all flesh) as the miserable and dolefull condition wherin death findeth him, and carrieth him away. Which before wee explayne, let vs speake a word of dying in prosperitie, or adversitie, &amp;c.
            
               One dieth (sayeth holie IoB) in his full strength, beeing whollie at ease, and quyet:
               
                  Iob. 21.23.24.25.26. 
               his breastes are full of

milke, and his bones are moystened with marrow. And another dieth in the bitternesse of his soule, and never eateth with pleasure. They shal lye downe alyke in the dust, and the worms shall cover them. Here are two things to bee observed: 1. That men are sayd to die in prosperitie or adversitie, onelie in regard of their estate before they bee dead; and not in respect of anie condition in and after death: for the one so dieth in prosperitie, and the other in adversitie temporall, as by dying, both hee leaveth his prosperitie, and hee his adversitie. 2. In regard of that transient estate, they are made by death both aequall. They lye downe alyke in the dust. There the wicked cease from troubling: and there the wearie bee at rest.
               
                  Iob. 3.17.18.19. 
               There the prisoners rest together: they heare not the voyce of the oppressour. The small and great are there: and the servant is free from his master.
            
            Mors sceptra ligonibus aequat.
            The third thing wherein men are sayd to die, is in their sinnes. This befalleth all the vnbelievers, who die in vnbeliefe, according to that saying of our Saviour; I sayde therefore vnto yom, that yee shall die in your sinnes.
               
                  Ioan. 8.24. 
               For if yee belieue not that I am HEE, yee shall die in your sinnes. Where is not meaned, that they shall cease to bee in their sinnes, or in the stayne and guiltinesse therof, as those who dying in worldlie wealth, or povertie, cease to bee in them anie more: but hee that dieth in his sinnes, his bones are full of the sinne of his youth,
               
                  Iob. 20.11. 
               which shall lye downe with him in the dust. Now, as Salomon sayth, if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth,
               
                  Eccles. 11.3· 
               there it shall be: That is, as Saynct Hierome expounds the place, in what estate a man dieth, eyther in sinne,
                  Hieron. comm. in Eccles. 
                  
                     〈…〉
                  . or in righteousnesse, hee shall for ever remayne in that same estate. The miserie of such a

man is descrybed in the Evangell of Saynct IOHN, with the felicitie of those who liue and die in the true fayth of the Sonne of GOD, briefelie, in these wordes, Hee that believeth on the Sonne, hath everlasting Lyfe: and hee that believeth not the Sonne,
               
                  Ioan. 3.36. 
               shall not see Lyfe, but the wrath of GOD abydeth on him.
            
            Therefore this Proposition, Blessed are they that die in the LORD, is reciprocall, They die in the LORD who are blessed: meaning of mortall men, who die this bodilie death; of whom none are blessed, but onlie they that die in the LORD. Neyther is there salvation in anie other: for there is none other name vnder Heaven given amongst men whereby wee must bee saved.
               
                  Act. 4.12▪
               
            
            To die in the LORD, signifieth not, that the LORD is the cause of our death, as Adam to them that die in Adam: but it signifieth that happie estate of a dying man, that hee is in the LORD, and consequentlie, of the number of those of whom the Apostle sayeth,
                  Rom.

               There is no condemnation to those which are in CHRIST IESVS. Neyther doeth dying in the LORD import ceasing from beeing in the LORD, as they who die in worldlie wealth, or povertie, doe cease to bee in that estate anie more: but to die in the LORD,
               
                  Ioann. 1.4. Coloss. 3.3▪ 1. Ioann. 5.12, 20. signifieth to die beeing and remayning in the LORD, before death, in death, and after death. The LORD is our lyfe, even aeternall Lyfe. He then that dieth in the LORD, remayneth in Lyfe, according to that saying of our Saviour; Verilie, verilie, I say vnto you, he that heareth My word,
               
                  Ioann. 5.24. 
               and believeth on Him that sent Mee, hath everlasting Lyfe, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death, vnto lyfe. Death may separate our soule from our bodie; but it can not breake that Union which wee haue with IESUS CHRIST; whose wee are, whether wee liue or die.

               I come nowe to a more particular consideration of this Union which wee haue with CHRIST in lyfe and death; and in respect whereof wee are sayde heere to die in the LORD. This Union is so strange and wonderfull, that it can not bee sufficientlie expressed by anie one kynde of vnion; and therefore the Spirit of GOD in the Scripture expresseth it by manie, and those most diverse sortes of vnion, or conjunction: to wit, by the vnion of conformitie; telling vs,

                  Ephes. 5.15. Phil. 2.12. And because thinges are vnited, or joyned together, two wayes, by the vnion of influence; to wit, eyther so that they concurre together, to make vp one totall or composed substance, (as for example, The head and the members make vp one totall substance; and so doe the roote and the branches) vvhich sort of vnion is called a Formall, Substantiall,

            Nowe, to apply all this to the present purpose: The Godlie haue all these kyndes or sorts of vnion with CHRIST, in death, as well as in lyfe; and therefore they are most justlie sayde to die in the LORD. And first, as for the Vnion of Conformitie, although the Learned, speaking of that conformitie vvith CHRIST, vnto which wee are praedestinated, doe onlie mention our Conformitie with Him in Grace and Glorie; yet betwixt these two, wee may verie well take in another part or degree of our conformitie with CHRIST; to wit, our Conformitie with Him in our death; vvhich is the passage from Grace to Glorie. For, as wee resemble Him by an holie lyfe, so also by an happie and victorious death. This degree of conformitie, which the Godlie haue with CHRIST, is grounded chiefelie vpon three respectes. For first, as CHRIST died voluntarilie, and by way of obedience to GOD His Fathers Commandement; so the Godlie die, humblie submitting themselues, and all their desires, vnto GOD'S will. For although, when that bitter Cuppe of deadlie sicknesse is presented to a Godlie man, he sometymes say with CHRIST, Father,

if it bee possible, let this Cup passe from mee;

               Neverthelesse, not as I will, but as Thou wilt. Secondliie; As CHRIST died, to destroy the works of the Devil;

            Secondlie; As for the vnion of Loue, or Friendship, which the Godlie haue with CHRIST, death can not ende, or dissolue it: for Paul telleth vs, That nothing is able to separate vs from the loue of CHRIST:

For, first, by reason of it, CHRIST IESVS, in that most dangerous houre, pleadeth for them most earnestlie, and effectuallie. Our necessitie doeth require this. For, when wee are arreasted by Death, and are going to bee praesented before that dreadfull Tribunall, vvhere all our workes of Righteousnesse, yea, all our sufferings can not sufficientlie pleade for vs; wee haue more nor neede, that that Blood which speaketh better thinges than that of Abell,

One thing I firmlie belieue; That all the Elect are, in some measure, strengthened by Him vpon the bed of languishing. I meane, vpon their death-bed: yea, so strengthened, that all the Powers of Hell can not make them to die in that fearfull sinne of Desparation. For GOD, vvho is not deficient in thinges necessarie for our naturall lyfe,
                  DEVS non deficit in necessariis.

               nor forsake thee: and consequentlie, deoth ever conserue in His owne Children, such a measure of Fayth and Hope, as is sufficient for salvation. Thirdlie; As the Godlie, in the houre of death, are bolde, to commende their spirites vnto CHRIST,
               
                  Luc. 23.46. and, as it were, to breathe out their soules into His Bosome; (for this is the last sute of a departing Saynct, LORD IESVS, receaue my spirit) so Hee also,
                  Act. 7.53. in regard of this vnion, granteth their desire: that is, He receaveth their spirits; He welcōmeth them with this sweet Salve; Intra in gaudium DOMINI tui; Enter into the joye of thy LORD: and Hee praesenteth them vnto His Father, saying; Beholde, I and the Children which GOD hath given mee. Iohn, I am sure, was glad vvhen CHRIST sayde to His Mother,

               Beholde thy Sonne; and to him, Beholde thy Mother. Howe much more shall mee rejoyce, when CHRIST, bringing our soules into GOD'S Chamber of Praesence, shall say to GOD, Ecce Filii Tui, Beholde thy Children; and to vs, Ecce Pater vester, Beholde your Father?
            
            The third, or last sort of vnion, which the Godlie

haue with Christ, to wit, the vnion of influence, or reall operation; and, in speciall, that vnion, whereby the Godlie are vnited with Christ, as members of his mysticall bodie, and branches ingrafted in him, not onlie continueth, or endureth vnto death, but in death: and by vertue thereof, the spirituall lyfe which is communicated vnto the Godlie in their regeneration, and the vitall operations of the same, are so effectuallie, and reallie preserved, that the Godlie may be sayd not onlie to liue, when they die; but also to come, by death, to a greater perfection of their lyfe. For the Spirit of God in the holie Scripture telleth vs, that the supernaturall lyfe, which wee haue by grace, is an everlasting lyfe: as lykewyse, that it is but imperfect here, and shall be perfected hereafter.Iohn 5.24. For here we walke by fayth, and not by sight: and now (that is, in this present lyfe) we see through a glasse,
               2. Cor. 5.7. 
               darklie; but then (that is,1. Cor. 13.1

                  . Vita nostra modo spes est, vita nostra postea aeternitas erit▪ Vita vitae mortalis, spes est vita immortalis, Enarrat. in Psal. 103. Conc. 4. in the lyfe to come) we shall see God face to face. And therefore holie Augustine sayeth verie well, that our lyfe, which now is nothing but hope, shall hereafter be aeternitie; and, that the lyfe of this mortall lyfe, is the hope of an immortall lyfe.
            
            Yee haue heard now, that the vnion, which the godly haue with Christ, is not abolished, nor yet diminished; but rather augmented, and perfected by death. Whereby ye may learne, first, how firme and stable that vnion is, which wee haue with Christ; seeing (as I haue shown you) death it selfe is not able to dissolue it. Happie are these, then, who count all thinges but dung, that they may gaine Christ,
               Philip. 3.8. 
               and that they may be found in him, &amp;c. For with MARIE they haue chosen that good part,
               Luke 10.4

               which shall not be taken away from them. And, on the contrarie, miserable and mad fooles are they, who haue set their heartes vpon worldlie thinges, and are vnited vnto them by affection.

For, first, they shall shortlie be divided, or separated from these things. Next, that separation shall procure more griefe to them, nor ever they had delight, or contentment, by enjoying these evanishing trifles. And thirdlie, which is worst of all, in that dreadfull judgement, which followeth after death, they shall be condemned to everlasting torments, for the inordinate loue which they carried to them.

            Moreover, the indissolubilitie &amp; aeternitie of that vnion, which the Godlie haue with Christ, maketh the vnion, which they haue amongst themselues, perpetuall, and indissoluble, by death. They are louelie and pleasant in their lyues, (as David in his mourning Song sayd of Saul and Ionathan) and in death they are not divided.

                  . Samul 1.23. For although some of the members of Christs bodie, be called out from this lyfe, before others, yet they remaine still vnited to one head; and, consequentlie, are still vnited amongst themselues: and albeit they be locallie separated for a tyme, yet they shall shortlie meet together in their Fathers house; and shall joyfullie sing for ever that Song of DAVID, Beholde how good and how pleasant a thing it is, for Brethren to dwell together in vnitie! Yee,Psal. 133.1. then, who are vnited vnto Christ, by a true and lyuelie fayth, be carefull by your godlie admonitions, and good example, to make these, whom yee tenderlie affect, to be participant of the same vnion: Fot if yee effectuate this, neyther death, nor judgement, nor anie other thing, shall divide you. But if it

be otherwayes, death, and that judgement which followeth thereafter, shall so divide you, that yee shall never haue a joyfull meeting together agayne. For when Christ shall come to judge the world, two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken,
               Luke 17.34 35.36. 
               and the other left: two men shall be in the field together; the one shall be taken, &amp; the other left: yea, of two which shall be in one bed; one shall be taken, and the other left. But what if they be both left, and condemned to Hel fire, shall they haue anie comfortable societie, or fellowship together? No. For as in Hell there is fire, without light; night, without rest; and death, without an ende; so there is companie, without comfort: yea, those who were companions in sinne, when they meet together there, they salute each other with mutuall execrations, and curse the day that ever they saw other.
            Secondlie, consider for your vse, how sweete an effect this our vnion with Christ produceth, seeing by vertue of it we spirituallie liue, both in death, and after death. If lyfe be so sweet, as we commonlie say; &amp; if this mortal, yea, this momētanie life, be so much esteemed by vs, as that a man will giue skin for skin,
               Iob 2.4.

HORMISDAS the Persian, as I shew you before, thought little of all the glorie and statelinesse of Rome; and that because he perceaved, that men were mortall there, as well as in other cities of the world. O, but if GOD had given him grace to enter by fayth into that heavenly Hierusalē, the Citie of the living God;Heb. 1

            I come now to the consideration of that blessednesse, or happinesse, which is here attributed to these who die in the Lord: in the handling whereof, I intend not to fall out in a Theologicall discourse, concerning that most noble and divine operation of our soule, wherein our Summum bonū
                consisteth: I meane, the vision and fruition of the glorious countenance of GOD: nor yet to trouble you, and my selfe both, with the debating and discussing of these quaestions, which are too curiouslie agitated, and too boldlie determined by manie Divines anent it. I shall onlie show you what is, and hath bene holden, as certaine, and vndoubtedlie true, by the greatest part of Christians, and what is called in quaestion by judicious and orthodoxe Divines, concerning the estate of the Godlie after this lyfe.
            First, then, it is certaine, that these, who die in the Lord, shal in the day of resurrection, and judgement, attaine to perfect, and consummate happinesse of soule and bodie: for in that day, the Lord, the righteous Iudge,
               2. Tim. 4.
                     •
                  . 
               shall giue the crowne of righteousnesse vnto all these, who loue his appearing.
            
            
               Secondlie, the greatest part of Christians, haue ever believed, that the blessednesse, which we shall then attaine vnto, consisteth in the vision and fruition of the glorious essence of GOD, which the Schoole-men call visionem DEI per essentiam. This is evidentlie revealed vnto vs in diverse places of Scripture. For our Saviour promiseth this, as a reward to the pure in heart,
               Matth. 5.8. that they shall see God. And Paul telleth vs, that this vision of God shall be a cleare, immediate, and intuitiue sight of his essence. For he sayeth, that we who now see God through a glasse, darklie,
               1 Cor. 13.12 shall then see him face to face. And Sainct Iohn lykewyse sayeth, that when he shall appeare, we shall see him as he is.

This is also clearly revealed in Scripture; for Paul wisheth to be dissolved, and to be with Christ; and telleth vs, that when wee are absent from the bodie, we are present with the Lord. Christ also sayde to the poenitent Thiefe, To day shalt thou bee with mee in Paradyse: and here a voyce from Heaven proclaymeth the happinesse of the dead, who die in the LORD.

               stlie revealed in the Scripture, although, as I haue sayde, it hath bene constantlie professed in the Church, yet it hath bene vitiated, or corrupted, by the admixtion of two erroneous doctrines. For, first, although none before holie Augustine did talke of such a Purgatorie-fyre, as our Adversaries doe mayntayne, yet some Fathers, who lived in the third and fourth age of the Church, to wit, Origen, Lactantius, Hilarie, Ambrose, Ruffinus, and Ierome, believed, that there shall be a generall Purgatione of all souls, by fyre, at the day of Iudgement;

and, that none shall bee free of it, (except Christ, who is the Righteousnesse of GOD

                This opinion is not nowe mantayned by anie: at least, it doeth not trouble the peace of the Church; and therefore I will not meddle with it. Secondlie, since the 400 yeare of our Lord, (about which tyme Augustine flowrished) some Fathers haue mentioned, &amp; expressed in their workes, a sort of purgation by fyre, verie farre different from the former. For they thought, that all the Elect doe not vndergoe this Purgation by fyre; but onlie they, who die in some kynde of guiltinesse; and, that these begin to be purged immediatelie after their departure. Saynct Augustine spake doubtfullie of this sort of Purgation 
                  Lib. 21. De Civitate DEI, Cap. 26. in Enchiridio, Cap. 69. &amp; Lib. De Fide &amp; Operibus, Cap. 16.. Gregorie the Great did holde it as a thing certayne

               : but hee knew no matter, or cause, of this Purgation, except the guiltinesse of these smaller sinnes, which are called veniall: for hee dreamed not of that imperfect remission of mortall sinnes committed after Baptisme, which Papists doe now holde, as a mayne ground of their doctrine concerning Purgatorie. But I haue alreadie confuted this fond conceat, and haue showne, that poenitentiall remission of sinnes committed after Baptisme, is no lesse perfect, and absolute, than baptismal remission. It is true indeed, these who after Baptisme, or after their first justification, doe fall backe, into grievous sinnes, haue not so easie accesse vnto the Throne of Grace, for obtayning Mercie, as they had before, (which, I thinke, moved the Ancient Church, to enjoyne such hard pennance to these, who after they were baptized, fell into great

sinnes) as also, because of their ingratitude for bygone favoures, and benefits, they are oft-tymes (I will not say alwayes) punished, or chastised, with greater, and more fearfull judgementes; even after they are reconciled to God by repentance. But this will never proue such a reservation of temporall punishment to bee inflicted in Purgatorie, in case of not satisfaction by poenall exercyses in this lyfe, as our Adversaries doe mayntayne.
            Fiftlie, it is certayne, that the glorie and happinesse, which the dead, who haue died in the Lord, shal haue after the generall judgement, shall be greater extensivè, in extention, nor it is now; and that because it shall be extended, or communicated, to their bodies also. But whether or not it shall be intensivè greater, after the generall judgement; that is, whether anie farther degree of glorie shall be then given to their soules, it is not so certayne.

               , doe thinke, that although they are now with Christ, in the companie or fellowship of the blessed Angels, and in an estate of vnspeakable joye; yet they haue not attayned, as yet, vnto that consummate, and accomplished happinesse, which consisteth in the vision, or immediate sight of God's glorious essence: and which the Schoole-men call beatitudinem essentialem, essentiall happinesse: or if they haue attayned vnto it, yet they haue not attayned to the perfection, or the fulnesse of that joyfull and blessed sight, which they shall haue hereafter. Others boldlie affirme, that they haue alreadie gotten a full sight of God's glorious essence; and, that nothing is wanting to their happinesse, but the glorification of their bodies. For my part, although I incline most to the first opinion, esteeming it more probable, in respect

of the consent of Antiquitie, and of diverse places in Scripture, which seeme to favour it; (for wee reade in Scripture, that wee shall bee satisfied with the lykenesse of God, when we awake; that is,Psal. 17.15. in the day of our resurrection; that the labourers shall bee called together in the evening; that is,Matth. 20.8 at the ende of the worlde, and shall then receaue their hyre, that the Crowne of Righteousnesse shall be given that day to all these who loue the Lord's appearing; and,2. Tim. 4.8. that when Hee shall appeare, wee shall bee lyke Him, and shall see Him as Hee is) yet, I thinke,1. Iohn 3.2 they are wysest, who suspende their judgement, and are not bold to determine anie thing in such matters as are not clearlie revealed in God's word; of which sort this whereof I am now speaking, is one.

                who also inclined more to the first opinion, condemneth their foolish rashnesse, who prye too narrowlie into this secret; and willeth vs, to be content with these boundes, or limites, of our knowledge, concerning this matter, which are praescribed in Scripture. And, truelie, it is sufficient for our comfort, and encowragement agaynst Death; as also for that Christian, and cowragious desire of death, which we ought to haue; it is, I say, sufficient to know, that it is an estate of such heavenlie glorie, and such joyfull happinesse, that all worldlie happinesse, or contentment, is but miserie, in respect of it. That yee may the better conceaue this, consider, I pray you, that if wee thinke it a delightsome, and joyfull thing, to dwell in a statelie and glorious Pallace, with these whom we loue best, and whose companie is most pleasant vnto vs; it must be a thing exceedinglie farre more happie, and joyfull, to liue in that heavenlie Pallace, whereof wee nowe see nothing but the pauement; yea, nothing but the inferiour

superfice of it▪ and yet wee see more glorious statelines in it, than in all other partes of the world. For in it doe shyne those glorious Lightes, which enlighten and beautifie the whole world; and which made DAVID to say, Lord, what is man, that thou art myndfull of him?
               Psal. 8.4. 
               and the sonne of man, that thou visitest him? It must bee a most delightfull thing, and a matter of exceeding great joye, to dwell in that coelestiall Paradyse, with an innumerable companie of Angels; with all our pious friendes, who haue gone before vs, and who shall followe after vs; with the Prophets, Patriarchs, Apostles, Martyrs, and other famous Worthies, whose vertues are so much praysed, &amp; admired on earth; and with our great LORD and Master, our kynde Saviour, CHRIST IESUS, who loved vs,
               Gal. 2.20. 
               and gaue Himselfe for vs. What joye, I pray you, shall wee haue there, in beholding Him, who died, and suffered so manie things for vs? How shall wee bee affected, and ravished in mynde, when wee shall viewe His glorious Head, which was one day crowned with Thornes for vs; His Handes and Feet, which were one day pierced with nayles for vs; and His syde, which was runne thorowe with a Speare for vs? But, aboue all, if wee shall then be admitted to the cleare, and immediate fight of God's infinite essence, (which, truelie, is verie probable) what admirable, vnspeakable, yea, inconceauable delight, and contentment, shall that sight worke in vs, although it bee not so full, and perfect, as it shall bee after the generall judgement? How joyfullie shall wee then say with DAVID,Psal.

            This doctrine, concerning the felicitie, vnto which the Godlie doe attayne, when their soules are separated from their bodies, affordeth manie profitable lessons, and vses vnto vs. For, first, wee may justlie collect from it, that although the Godlie bee manie wayes blessed, or happie, while they liue heere; to wit▪ in respect of that inaesteemable benefite of the remission of their sinnes Psal. 32.1.2., in respect of these supernaturall vertues, wherewith they are endewed, and of the operations, or actions of the same Psal. 1.1.112.1.

The estate of these, who truelie and indeede are Citizens of it, is an estate of happinesse; but of such happinesse, as consisteth in sorrowing, or mourning for their sinnes, and manyfolde infirmities Matth. 5.4.. It is an estate of righteousnesse; but of such righteousnesse, as standeth rather in the remission of sinnes, nor in the perfection of vertues; and vnto the perfection whereof is necessarilie required a true acknowledgement, and a humble confession of its imperfection, as saynct Augustine piouslie, and judiciouslie sayeth

                In a word, then, if we shall looke to the manifolde sorrowes, feares, dangers, and sinfull infirmities, vnto which the Godlie are subject in this lyfe; and, on the other part, to that plenarie, or full deliverance, from all these evils, which they obtayne by death, wee shall finde, that wee haue more than reason, to say with Solon, and in the words of the Poet, although not according to their sense;

that is, No man can bee called perfectlie happie, or fullie blessed, so long as hee liveth in this valley of teares.
            Secondlie, this doctrine showeth you, that the Godlie haue no occasion to feare death; but, rather, ought to desire, and wish for it. The true Christian may not onelie meet approaching death, with cowrage, and say, O death, where is thy sting? O Graue, where is thy victorie?
               1. Cor. 15.55.; but also with joye, and say, How beautifull vpon the mountaynes are the feete of him that bringeth good tydinges?
               Isai. 52.7. Thou art come to tell me the best, and most joyfull newes, that ever I heard. For thou art come to tell mee▪ that my warfare is accomplished; and, that I shall nowe enter into peace, that my sorrowfull seed-tyme is ended;Isai. 57.2. and, that my joyfull harvest is at hand.Psal. 126▪ 5. Thou art come to bring mee home to my Father's house, to take my crosse from my sholders, and to put my Crowne vpon my head. If the Godlie haue such reason to welcome death chearfullie when it commeth, ought they not to desire,

and long for it, before it come? Cyprian, Chrysostome, and Ambrose, doe most excellentlie, and eloquentlie, vrge this poynct

Ambros. lib. de bono mortis, cap. 12.: and Paul telleth vs, that all the Godlie haue a longing, or desire, yea, a vehement desire, of that glorie and happinesse, which is begun immediatelie after death, and shall bee consummated in the day of the Resurrection. Yet all the Godlie haue not this vehement desire in a lyke manner, and measure: for some of them haue desiderium mortis plenum &amp; absolutum, a plenarie and absolute desire; or, a desire not opposed, or impeded by anie other desire. Such a desire of death, I thinke, was in olde Simeon, when hee had gotten CHRIST in his armes, and sayde, Nunc dimittis. For the onlie thing which detayned him in this lyfe, or made him willing to bee detayned in it, was the desire hee had to see Christ 
                  Veniebat ille.

               : and, therefore, having gotten his desire, hee was most willing to depart

               . Some agayne of them haue desiderium mortis ligatum &amp; impeditum, a vehement desire of death, but opposed, impeded, and as it were, bound vp by another spirituall desire. Such a desire had Paul, when hee sayde, I am in a strayt betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to bee with Christ, which is farre better. Neverthelesse, to abyde in the flesh, is more needfull for you 
               Philip. 1.23. Psal. 39.13. Iob 10.20.21.. So also manie of God's deare Servantes, although they haue withdrawne their heartes from the worlde, and long to bee with CHRIST; yet in respect they haue not, as yet, attayned to such assurance of remission of their sinnes, as they would; therefore they wish with David, that GOD would spare them; to the effect they may recover strength before they goe hence, and bee no more: or, as Iob sayeth, that they may take comfort a little before they goe, whence they shall not returne. Last of all, there are some of the Godlie, who although

they labour earnestlie, to get their affection on thinges aboue, yet they finde, to their exceeding great griefe, that they are still so affected with the loue of this lyfe, and the thinges which they enjoye heere, that they can not attayne to that vehement longing for a better lyfe, that cowragious and Heroicke desire of death, which other Godlie men and women haue. Neverthelesse, seeing Paul generallie affirmeth, that all they who haue receaved the first fruites of the Spirit,
               Rom. 8.23. 
               groane within themselues, wayting for the accomplishment of their adoption, and willing to be absent from the bodie,
               2. Cor. 5.8. that they may bee present with the LORD, wee may verie well say, that even they haue vehemens desiderium mortis, &amp; coelestis beatitudinis. For although they haue it not actuallie, yet they haue it in voto &amp; conatu
               ▪ by way of earnest desire, and carefull stryving to attayne to it.
            Thirdly, seeing these only are blessed after death, who die in the Lord, it followeth manifestlie, that wofull, miserable, and lamentable, is the estate of the greatest part of the worlde after death: I meane, of the wicked, who liue not in the Lord; and, consequentlie, can not die in the Lord. Death, which is to all a change, and, to the Godlie, a blessed change, shall bee to them a dolefull, &amp; vnhappie change. For the terminus ad quem of their change, or the estate vnto which they shall bee changed, is an estate of remedilesse miserie, easelesse paine, &amp; endlesse death. This their case, may justlie seeme the more miserable, if wee shall consider also the the terminus à quo of their change: that is, if wee shall looke to the temporall, or worldlie estate and condition, from which they shall bee changed. For some of them are acting a Tragoedie vpon the Stage of this worlde; that is, they spende all their dayes in povertie, dishonour,

and manie other miseries. To these death is a change from the miseries of this worlde, to miseries incomparablie greater in another worlde: and, therefore, their estate, and condition in this lyfe, is called by BERNARD, In his Booke of Sentences, if that Book be his. 
               via aerumnosa ad mortem, a miserable and sorrowfull way vnto aeternall death. Others of them are acting a Comedie vpon the same stage▪ but such a Comedie, as shall ende in a wofull Tragedie: that is, they liue in wealth, honour, and aboundance of worldly delights. To them death is a change from the momentanie pleasures of this worlde, to everlasting torments, and sorrowes, in the world to come. And their estate, or condition in this lyfe▪ is called by BERNARD, via deliciosa ad mortē, a delightsome way vnto death. To these two estates of wicked men in this lyfe, BERNARD addeth a third; to wit, the estate or condition of these who haue aboundance of worldlie thinges, and yet not beeing contented therewith, doe continuallie vexe themselues with anxious care, and paynfull labour, in acquiring more wealth: so that these riches which they haue, perish by evill travell, and all their dayes they eat in darknesse;Eecles. 5.14.17. that is, with much sorrow, and wrath. This estate, or condition of wicked men in this lyfe, is called by SALOMON, a sore evill; and by BERNARD, via laboriosa ad mortem; a paynfull, and wretched way vnto death. In a word thē, whatsoever be the temporal estate of wicked men in this lyfe, death is to them an vnhappie change; even in respect of the terminus à quo of their change. For, to some of them, it is both a change, and an ende of their joyes: to others, it is a change, but not an ende of their sorrowes; and a meane whereby they are infinitelie multiplyed, and increased.
            Last of all, yee see here, how wyse a choyse they make, who with MOSES, choose rather to suffer affliction

with the Children of GOD, having respect vnto the recompence of rewarde,
               Hebr. 11.25.26. 
               than to enjoye the pleasures of sinne, which last but for a season: and therefore are called by Bernard,
               
                  Ibidem.
                
               momētaneae dulcedines &amp; horariae suavitates: that is, such delights, such sweetnes of earthly objects, as last but for an houre; yea, but for a moment. The estate of the Godlie in this lyfe, seemeth, to our corrupt reason, a troublesome, and melancholious estate. For whē they enter into this estate, they must put on the mourning weede of repentance, and never put it off while they liue: they must put on the whole Armour of GOD, and never put it off, vntill their Wynding-sheet be put vpon them. They must, perhaps, put on Lazarus his ragges, and never put them off, vntill they die vpon a Dung-hill, or by a dyke syde. Neverthelesse, our estate, is an estate of joye vnspeakable,
               1. Pet. 
                     •
                  .8. 
               and full of glorie. And although it were not, yet the joye which is set before vs,
               Psal. 4.7. Heb. 12.2. might make vs, yea, should make vs, gladlie to vndergoe it, and all the vexations, troubles, and griefes, which accompanie the same. All these who haue gone before vs to Heaven, haue entered into that Kingdome through much tribulatione:Act. 14.22. yea, it behoved Christ Iesus himselfe first to suffer,
               Luke 24.26 and then to enter into his Glorie. And therefore, if anie of you be vnwilling to take vp his crosse, in hope of this glorie, I will say to him, as IEROME sayde to HELIODORUS, Delicatus es, frater, si &amp; hìc vis gaudere cum mundo,
               
                  Epist. 1. ad Heliodorum
                
               &amp; postea regnare cum Christ
                     •
                  : Thou art too delicate, my brother, if thou wouldest both rejoyce here with the world, &amp; also reygne hereafter with Christ. And, as hee sayeth in the words following, so say I to everie one of you, That day shall come,
               1. Cor. 15.53. 
               in the which this corrubtible, and mortall, shall put on incorruption, and immortalitie. Blessed shall the servant be,
               Luke 12.37 
               whom his Lord shall then finde watching. If he

finde thee so, the earth, with the people which are in it, shall shake, and tremble, at the voyce of the Trumpet; but thou shalt rejoyce. When the Lord shall come to Iudgement, the worlde shall sadlie roare and groane — foolish Plato, with his schollers, shall then be arraygned: Aristotle his argumentes that day shall avayle him nothing. Then thou, although thou be a poore clowne, shalt rejoyce, and laugh, and say, Beholde my God, who was crucified: beholde the Iudge of the worlde, who one day cryed as a new-borne Chylde, being wrapped in swedling clowts, and layde in a manger. This is Hee, who was the son of a Crafts-man, and of a work-woman. This is Hee, who being God, fled from the face of man into Aegypt, carried vpon his mothers breast. This is Hee, whom the souldiours, by way of derision, cloathed with Purple, and crowned with Thornes, &amp;c.

            Having gone through my Text, I now apply my selfe, and my Text both, to this present Text, which lyeth before vs: I meane, the dead halfe of our late most worthie, and Reverend, and now most blessed Praelate, whom death hath not destroyed, but divided into two halfs, or parts; his one halfe, his living, and better halfe, is now in suo elemento, in its owne element; in terra viventium, in the land of the living; that is, in that land where death hath no place
                  S. August. in the explication of the 27. psal. vers. 13. calleth Heavē 
                  terrā viventium, &amp; this earth, terraē morientium.
               . His other halfe is, as yee see, seazed vpon by death. But I may justlie say to death, which hath seazed vpon it, as Bernard said in a Funeral Sermon vpon Humbert the devote Monke; 
                  O mors, crudelis best
                        •

                        que
                      solā, animae enim nō habes quod facias. Bern. serm, in obitu Humberti devoti monachi.
                
               O death, thou cruel beast, thou most bitter bitternesse, the stinch and horrour of the

sonnes of Adam; what hast thou done? thou hast killed, thou hast possessed. But what? truelie nothing, but his flesh, or his bodie. And this was dead, before it was dead: for Paul sayeth, the bodie is dead, because of sinne; to wit, through infirmities, sicknesse, and troubles; and in respect it is by a judiciall sentence, nigh 6000 yeares since, condemned to die. The most, then, O death, which thou hast done, is this; thou hast put a dead bodie out of payne; a bodie condemned to die, out of feare of death; and this is a vantage: for the feare of death, is worse than death:
Mors
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   minus poenae, quam mora mortis habet.
Well then, thou hast gotten little, thou hast little: and therefore, as Christ sayeth, that from him who hath little, even that which hee hath, shall bee taken: So say I to thee, and Bernard in that same place sayde it before mee; even that same bodie which thou seemest to haue, shall bee taken from thee 
                  Sed &amp; ipsum corpus quod videris habere, anferetur à te. Ibidem..
            This bodie was the receptacle ingentis &amp; generosi animi, of a great and generous mynde. It was hospitium, the lodging house of a mightie, and most actiue spirit. But what a lodging house? It was ever hospitiū exile, a slender lodging house; but within these few years it was also incōmodum &amp; ruinosum hospitium, an incommodious and ruinous lodging: &amp;, to vse Plautus his phrase,
                  In Trinum▪
                   2.4. it was hospitium calamitatis; for manie bodilie infirmities, and diseases lodged in it. And now at last it is to vs documētum mortalitatis, a document of our common mortalitie: or, to vse your owne ordinarie phrase, it is to vs a memento mori; yea, a memento mori in Domino; a memento not onlie of dying, but also of dying as he died, that is, in the Lord. This can not bee so well declared vnto you, as by showing you, that hee lived in the Lord: and, that hee lived so, I can not demonstrate, but I must fall

out into his justlie deserved prayses; or rather, into the prayses of Gods bountie, and liberalitie towards him. For (as Gregorie Nazianzen reasoned concerning Athanasius his prayses) to prayse him, it is to prayse vertue; and to prayse vertue, it is to prayse God, who is the author and giver of it 
               
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . Orat. 21. in laudem Athanasit.
               . I say, that to prayse him, is to prayse vertue; because, (as Nazianzen there sayeth of Athanasius) manie rare vertues, both morall, and spirituall, were collected, and vnited together in him. Think not that I speak hyperbolicallie: for I dare affirme, that there was as great a varietie of God's graces in him, as in anie Laicke or Clergie-man of this Kingdome. These who knewe him well, doe acknowledge this; and these who doe not acknowledge it, never knew him. I will not enumer all his vertues, and laudable carriages: but omitting that which I might speake of his admirable wisdome, his singular learning His judicious &amp; accurat Treatises cōcerning the visibilitie of the Church, &amp; the lawfulnesse of our calling to the Ministerie: as also his excellēt Commētary vpō the book of the Revelation, shall beare witnes of it to the end of the world., his most quick apprehension, and conceaving of whatsoever purposes, his solide, or stayed judgement, his mellifluous eloquence, his wonderfull activitie, his generous, and noble, or rather heroicke disposition: so that I may justly say of him, as Nazianzē
                said of Athanasius, hee did imitate the nature both of the Adamant, in respect no vnjust opposition, howe violent soever, could breake him; and of the Magnes, or load-stone, because of the attractiue vertue of his pithie and convincing speaches; as also of his gracious, prudent, and amiable carriage, whereby hee was able to draw even the most refractarie spirits, to the aequitie, or trueth, which hee did mayntayne; omitting, I say, all these thinges, I will onelie touch one thing, which is chiefelie to bee looked vnto in one of that place; to wit, that he was an accomplished Prelate, &amp; a most worthie Governour of the Church. Gregorie

Nazianzen excellentlie declareth,
                  Orat. 1. Apol. pro fuga,
                how hard a thing it is, to bee a Ruler in God's House; and that in three respectes: First, because a Bishop must bee a man of singular holinesse: and he must not thinke it anough, not to bee evill; but hee must excell in vertue. For, as it is the fault of a private man, not to bee good; so it is the fault of a Prelate, not to excell others in goodnesse. 
               
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . 2. Tim. 2.15 Secondlie, hee must preach powerfullie, and prudentlie, dividing the word aright, which (as this Father there sayeth) is not a thing incident to a small or base spirit. 
               
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . For it requireth a mynde endewed with varietie of graces, &amp; applyable to everie sort of Auditors. 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . Thirdlie, hee must be a wyse and actiue Governour: and this, sayeth hee, is the Arte of Artes, and the Science of Sciences, to governe men, and direct them in matters of Salvation; which hee declareth, by comparing Pastors to Physicians; and prosecuteth that comparison at great length.
            These three properties, or qualities doe make vp an accomplished Prelate: and I thinke, ye who heare mee, will confesse with mee, that hee had them all in a great measure; and in such perfection, that verie few in this Kingdome did aequall him in anie one of them. For, first, his singular pietie kythed in this, that although he was an Honourable Baron, and of great respect in this Countrey, yet hee was so taken, yea, so ravished, even in the dayes of his youth, with the loue of GOD'S Word, and the care which hee had of saving soules, and of the propagation of the Gospel; that renouncing all other delightes, and exercyses, vnto which men of his qualitie doe whollie giue themselues, hee desired one thing of the Lord, and still did seeke after it:Psal. 27.4. to wit, that hee might dwell in the house of the Lord all the dayes of his lyfe; and that not onlie to beholde the beautie of the LORD, but also to

make others beholde it, and to make their hearts enamoured therewith. Secondlie, as pietie shyned in his lyfe lyke lightning, so it thundered in his Sermons. Nazianzen sayde this of Saynct Basil,
               
                  Tom. 2. Carmine. 64.

And it may justlie bee applyed to him: For, howe learned, how pertinent, how plausible, and how powerfull a Preacher hee was, I appeale to all your memories, who oft tymes heard him with delight, and admiration, to your singular comfort, and benefit. Thirdlie, as for his prudencie, and fidelitie, in governing this Dioces, &amp; our famous Universitie, wherof hee was Chancellour; they can not be expressed, or declared vnto you, but by a particular induction, or enumeration of his laudable actes, which, truelie, I dare not vndertake; because neyther doe I knowe them all; and, although I knew them, I can not speake of them, as their singularitie, and excellencie doeth requyre.

                to expresse the greatnesse of a Cyclop-Giant, in a little table, paynted the Satyres beside him, measuring his thumbe with a wand: so to expresse in some sort, the greatnesse of his worth, which hee kythed in the administration of that weyghtie Charge, wherevnto he was called, I shall onlie measure his thumbe, and point at one effect of his wyse, and happie Governement; to wit, the establishing of a setled Ministerie in these partes; or, which is all one, of a setled course, whereby the Gospell may be propagated in this countrey, vnto subsequent ages, by able and well qualified men. Two thinges were requisite for this; to wit, convenient mayntaynance of Pastors, and increase of knowledge in the studie of Divinitie. Mayntaynance, lest good and able men should want good Places, or Benefices;

and increase of knowledge, lest good Places should want able and good men to occupie, and fill them. The first of these two hee did effectuate, by attending the Platt most diligentlie, where hee had a 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               . For hee fought there with the wilde beasts of the field, and with the boars of the forrest, who had wasted the Lord his Vine-yarde. Hee fought, I saye, partlie by his owne personall diligence, and paynes, whyle hee was able to travell; and partlie after hee had contracted sicknesse, hee fought by his letters, authoritie, and moyen: which were ever much regarded by the best of this Kingdome. The second hee did effectuate, by three meanes especiallie: First, by establishing a Profession of Divinitie, which was a matter of great charges, both to his Presbyters, and also to himselfe. Secondlie, by procuring a foundation of a good number of Bursses, for sustentation of Studentes in Divinitie: and thirdlie, by appoynting most exact and strict tryalls of exspectantes, before their admission to the Ministeriall charge.
            In these, and manie mo things, which hee did for establishing a setled Ministerie here, and for the propagation of the Gospell vnto future ages, the scope or ende at which hee aymed, was that at which PAUL aymed before him; to wit, that hee might finish his course with joye,
               Acts 20.24. and that in the houre of death hee might finde in his owne soule the answere of a good conscience towardes GOD.
               1. Pet. 3.21. Truelie, hee fayled not of his intention. For to omit manie particulars, which I might relate concerning the happinesse, and tranquillitie of his death, this one thing I will saye, that I never sawe anie meete approaching death, with such vndaunted cowrage, such Christian confidence, and such assurance of GOD

his favour, as hee expressed in his carriage, whyle hee walked in the valley of the shadowe of death. Manie speake stoutlie of death, and agaynst the feare of it, before it come: but, as SENECA wittilie sayth,
                  Magna verba excidunt, cùm t
                        •
                     rtor poposcit manum, cum mors propius accessit. Seneca Epist. 82. they forget these stout speaches, when death draweth nigh▪ That noble and valorous Earle, ROBERT DEVEREUX, Earle of ESSEX, who suffred in the yeare 1601 for his rebellion, and died verie Christianlie, as Historicians report, being desired by the Pastors, who were present at his execution, to laye aside all feare of death;
                  Thuanus hist. tom. 5. lib. 125. pag. 947. ingenuouslie confessed, that although hee had beene in manie extreame daungers, and consequentlie had looked death oft tymes in the face, yet hee had never looked vpon it without much horrour, and feare. But our worthie Prelate was so wonderfullie assisted, and strengthened by the Spirit of GOD, agaynst the terrours of death, that in all these conflictes, and wrastlinges, which in his bodie hee had with death, hee seemed rather to bee a spectator, than an actor. And this his more than ordinarie carriage continued still with him, vntill hee breathed out his Soule into the Bosome of his Master.
            To conclude then, I haue spoken somewhat of this most Reverende Praelate, but much short of his worth, &amp; graces. If any of you think that I haue said too much of his vertues, truelie I will professe to you, that I thinke farre more of them nor I haue sayde: neyther dare I speake all that I thinke,

            A FVNERALL SPEACH, In commemoration of the right Reverend Father in GOD, PATRICKE FORBES of CORSE, late Bishop of ABERDENE, Chancellour and Restorer of the Universitie thereof, one of his Majesties most honorable Privy Counsel, a jewell both of Church and State, Baron of ONEIL, &amp;c.
            Delivered Apr. 12. 1635. by ALEXANDER SCROGIE, Doctor in Divinitie, and ordinarie Minister of Gods word in the Cathedrall Church of ABERDENE.
            
            
               THE beholding of this place, over-shadowed with a darke and dolefull countenance vpon this vnacceptable occasion, (GOD so ordering and disposing the wayes of men, by his providence) giveth vs just cause of heavines, for the losse of that Graue and Reverend Praelate, and ever worthie

Diocesane, a Man of eminent and best place amongst vs: whom albeit wee had cum necessitate amittendi, and haue lost him cum spe recipiendi, and so are comforted with the will of the LORD,Act. 21.14. that must be done; yet not to haue feeling of that which so nearlie concerneth vs, were not patience, but blockish stupiditie, contrarie the example of Heathen and Sayncts, and the Lord IESUS mourning for Lazarus, the destruction of Hierusalem, and hard heart of the Iewes.
            
            This is a praecursorie judgement and punishment. So God maketh a way for his judgementes to come vpon a Church, or kingdome, when insensiblie and graduallie hee eateth out the heart and strength of a State; and so, by degrees, weakeneth, and praepareth it for a fatall blow; that so, without resistance, hee may ruine it; as pyking out, and taking away, nowe a prudent and experienced Counsellour, and then another out of the way: and those that pray for the welfare of the Nation, and wrastle mightilie with God, for the peace of it: the Charets, and Horse-men of the land; the staffe, and the stay, and pillars of the house: and so, (by degrees departing himselfe) a new judgement in his anger entereth in rowme thereof. Then Trueth and Holinesse commonlie depart, and Ministers begin to bee corrupt: the Prophet is a foole, and the spirituall man is mad: the power and puritie of the trueth, and the good and olde way departeth: and so idolatrie groweth, and Sects encrease, and a perilous desolation, and change of all things, enseweth. What mischiefe followed the death of Samuel, David, Salomon, and Iosias? The Gothes, after the death of Ambrose, made in that same place irruption, and setled the seat of their kingdome. When Augustine ended his

dayes in defence of the grace of GOD, the Vandales crueltie and errours succeeded. And after the death of blessed Martin Luther, the bloodie Spaniards invaded Germanie,
               Anno 1546 and tooke Wittenberg.
            
            And shall wee not wit, when GOD departeth, but bee as Sampson?Iudges 17.20. GOD, by death, hath taken away, within this short space, a great number of rare, and worthie men, both for wisdome and learning; which were Ornamentes and Lightes in this Diocie: and wee see no great evidenes howe to fill vp this gap.
            It is an ancient proverbe, Vivorum oportet meminisse: and why, then, should there not bee made an honourable mention of them who haue died in the Lord, because they liue to God.
            
               Precious in the sight of the Lord, is the death of his Sayncts:
               Psal. 116.1
                     •
                  
                (and shall it seeme vnto vs superfluous, at such tymes as these are, to heare in what manner they ended their lyues?) &amp; he hath so exactly recorded in Scripture, in what sort they haue closed their dayes on earth, that hee descendeth even to their meanest actions;Genes. 27.3 as, what meat they longed for in their sicknesse; what they spake to their Children, or Friendes;Genes. 49. howe they framed their Testamentes; where they haue willed to bee buried;1. Reg. 2. yea, the verie turning of their faces,Genes. 47. and 49. and 50. 2. Reg. 20. Ioshua 38. 1. Reg. 1. to this or that side: the setting of their eyes; the degrees whereby their naturall heate departed from them; their cryes, groanes, breathinges, panting, and last gasping, hee hath solemnlie commended to all generations.
            And GOD, by the Prophet, hath for ever commended to the Church, David his Epitaph, and Funerall Song,
               2. Sam. 1.19. of wicked Saull, and Ionathan his sonne. He decoreth them, as if God from Heaven had said, that the Captaynes of the Armies of Israell should

not bee convoyed to the graue without honour, and teares. And, no lesse they who haue deserved well of the Church and Common-wealth; who haue put to flight the enemies, with the sword of their mouth, and of the Spirit; than they which haue slayne them with the mouth and edge of the Sword, and by Armies.
            God maketh an honourable commemoration of them that did assist his service, and cause;Hebr. 11. Prov. 10.7.1.12.8. Matth. 26.13. and giveth them their glorie that doe any thing for him. Which Christ applyeth to the woman that anoynted him. So that it is not onlie lawful, but also profitable, that the godlie lyfe, manners, and vertue, manner and forme of the death of the faythfull servands of God, worthie of aeternall prayse, bee recommended to future ages; that they may bee acquaynted therewith. So the care of the living, to liue and die well, is encreased, when they know, that their death and lyfe shall not bee folded vp in silence. They are stirred vp to the imitation of their lyfe, and example, and are taught to walke in a good conscience, as they haue done before them. And when they heare how mercifullie God hath dealt with them in the houre of their last neede, besides the prayse they giue to God, for his graces shyning in them, and the joye which they finde in the communion of Sayncts, their hope is much confirmed agaynst the day of their last dissolution; beholding God delivering his servandes from these miseries, and restlesse temptations, and receaving them into rest with himself in the heavēs.
            Yea, the sound of these thinges doeth not so passe the eares of those that are most dissolute in lyfe, but it causeth them sometyme or other, to wish in their heartes, O that wee might die the death of the righteous,
               Num. 23.10. 
               and that our ende might bee lyke his.
            
            
               And especiallie in these dayes it is needfull, that in charitie wee testifie the trueth of our brethren departed, and mayntayne their fame, and justifie them from the calumnies of the wicked, who open their mouthes, to prattle agaynst Pastors, both living and dead; vnthankfullie rendering evill for good; and cruellie censuring on bare Rumour, agaynst Charitie; especiallie them of most eminent place. A before the person was wont to beare of manie blowes from the function; nowe the function woundeth the person. And that which should command respect, brandeth them; mens inconsiderate zeale breeding monstrous conceptions, vncharitable censures, and envie of their greatnesse: Mortuis leonibus, vivi lepores insultant.
            
            Wee here especiallie who reape the fruit of his laboures, ought of duetie, of a pious affection, and thankfull mynde, lament his losse, and acknowledge his worth, who was 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , as Sophocles commended Philoctetes;* and was, as Theodor sayde of Irenaeus, 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , and is nowe a glorious starre in the Heavens aboue, as hee was a shyning lampe in the firmament of the Church here on earth.
            And what my selfe haue observed, by long acquayntance, nude nuda loquar, neyther for fashion, nor flatterie, that neyther his just prayse be silenced, nor anie thing besides the trueth bee forged, I may say with Bernard, Doleo quod plenum affectū exili cogor designare stylo, &amp; brevi chartula latam comprehendere charitatem, festine enim ista dicta sunt, &amp; ob hoc minus festivè.

            As hee was largelie honoured by God, in blood, in name, and descent of an honourable stocke; so he honoured it with all the true ornamentes of vertue

and wisdome: In his private lyfe, by his pietie, and Religion, &amp; constant profession of the trueth, in the strictest sort; by diligent &amp; profitable hearing therof, and living accordinglie; and, as a Godlie Christian, teaching others, by his example: and might haue sayde as Gedeon, As I doe, so doe yee. Thereafter,Iudges 17.7. receaved to bee a Pastor, and Church-man, hee was not an ydle shepheard; but diligent, and paynfull, from his entrie, in the Ministerie, and feeding of the people, with sound doctrine, powerfullie delivered: alwayes resident, and never a deserter of that flocke: and, in that tyme, ever vigilant, by all meanes, to procure the peace of the Church,Zach. 11. and the staffe of the binders vnbroken: but to bee still knit together in God, and the Spirit of concord, and vnitie.
            Thereafter, his calling to the Episcopall dignitie, was rare, and examplarie, without his knowledge, or seeking, directlie, or indirectlie, sine ambitu and vsurpation, hunting after places and preferment, as manie doe, thorow ambition, and loue of gayne and glorie, not awayting the LORD'S calling.
            Onlie this I can not forbeare: Our gracious Soveraygne, of blessed memorie, did not so much honour him, as himselfe, and the age, in the freedome of his noble, and vnexpected choyse:
                  Orat.

               See to this purpose, the letters sent from the King▪ &amp; from the Bishops; which yee shal find in this booke, after these Funerall Sermons▪
                truelie and properlie fitteth our Bishop: hee was promoved 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               . And though hee acknowledged a deepe obligation to many great and honourable friendes, yet he ought it to no thing, to no man, but to GOD'S Providence, and the King's bountie. And thus shall it be done to all them that honour GOD and the King: GOD and the King, without doubt, will honour them.
            
               Hee beeing preferred to bee a Bishop, Over-seer, and President of others, in the Church, and to bee employed in matters of weyghtiest importance, and having put on that sacred honour, yet was hee never lesse in his owne apprehension, what ever he seemed to others: not statelie, but gentle, courteous, and effable, to all.
            It agreed to him which is spoken of Simon, the son of Onias the Priest;Ecclus 50.11. in the Greeke text, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ; hee glorified the sacred Priestlie Garment with Vertue, Wisdome, and Nobilitie: not feeding himselfe, nor ydlie and vnprofitablie spending his lyfe; but in the worke of the LORD: That, whereas in others wealth and power furnisheth them fewell,Ez. 3. to the fire of their lusts; in him it furnished greater matter of doing, &amp; set his vertuous mynd the more on worke, as Gregorie Nazian reporteth of Basilius the great; the more libertie he had, the lesse he challenged to himself: remembering what Seneca said,
                  De consol.
                
               Caesari cui omnia licēt propter hoc ipsum multa non licent: not languishing with ease, and delicacie; and enjoying few free houres: that beeing over-spent with worke, hee often tymes complayned of his change; and heartilie wished, to haue returned to a private lyfe, (by reason of the cares, toyl
                  •
               , and vexations, which attende that place) as Saynct Gregorie did, if nothing but earthlie respectes had swayed him. But hee followed the calling of GOD, to whose service hee willinglie sacrificed himselfe; and whose glorie was the ende of his beeing.
            His first and foremost care, was for the House of GOD; and especiallie of the Cathedrall Church where hee did reside; aedifying, and reparing the ruines thereof, and furnishing it with ornamentes convenient; and which had lyen waste and desolate

since the Reformation, wanting a Preacher; because they who sacrilegiouslie had impropriated the Tithes, wanted conscience to provyde a Minister, and mayntaynance for him. And, that there might alwayes bee an able and Godlie Ministerie, hee caused found a Profession of Divinitie, and a Rent for the entertaynment thereof, in all tymes comming. The Benefit whereof, the Countrey hath alreadie, with great contentment, beholden.
            And, in his frequent Visitations of the Churches in his Diocie, hee removed, from manie places, ydle Lubbards; and purged out all vncleane, and vnprofitable ministers; planted Churches, where there were none, and caused endow them with Land and Living; that there might bee mayntaynance in the House of GOD, for the Prophets, and their sonnes after them. Hee dissolved, in manie places,Mal▪ 3. the vnhappie vnion which was made of Churches; and procured severall Plantations of them.

So was hee learned, in this learned Citie, where there is the Seat of Learning; wyse, in ordering, and governing GOD'S House; faythfull, impartiall, and solid in judging, discret in admonishing, compassionate in correcting, full of power and authoritie in censuring, and rebuking, to reduce the inordinate; and, when neede was, to cutt off evill examples from the Flocke: In dispatch of businesse, speedie, and with great dexteritie: alwayes provident, and carefull, to advance the Gospell; and paynfull, even in the tyme of his sicknesse: Without all carnall and base feare of men: not bowed with boastes, to betray the Church; or daunted, and discowraged

from executing his office with great cowrage, spirit, &amp; resolutenesse of mynd; contending with them,Ez, 3.9. that contended with God; and fighting a good fight; both in defence of the truth, &amp; expugnation of heresies, schisms, and seditions brought in by adversaries.

An honourable patterne of pietie and humanitie to all: a lover and favourer of good men: a comfort to the best; a terrour and a wound to enemies, and the worst inclyned. And, as Augustine spake of Cyprian, Multi erat meriti, multi pectoris, multi oris, multae virtutis. In outward carriage, and actions, graue, modest, and constant: procuring reverence of all that beheld him. And, which is especially worthie of mention, and imitation, he was sincere &amp; vpright; being within, what he seemed without. Not as Tertullian saith of certain Philosophers, Mimicè affectāt veritatem,

            At last, being over-taken with a longsome and grievous disease, which he did beare with his accustomed cowrage, and constancie; not vsing any word of impatience, complaint, or motion, showing any discontent with God: but with a quyet invinceable

vndaunted heart, as an immoveable Rocke, 
                  •
               phelde himselfe by Fayth and Hope, resting in GOD his Saviour: only lamenting his infirmitie in this, That it vnabled him from the discharge of his Office,Iob 13.15. as hee had done when Health lasted. And yet in tyme of his weaknesse, his Memorie and Senses beeing perfect, hee caused carrie him, (diverse tymes) both to the publicke meeting of the Ministerie, and ordinarilie to the Church, to the publicke worship of GOD, vvhere hee was an attentiue and comfortable hearer.
            And, at last, extremitie of sicknesse, and death drawing neare, hee was compelled to keepe home, in Divine conference with all that visited him; in speach jocund, and pleasant: vttering diverse Christian Apophthegmes before death; often saying, That hee had passed the halfe of death alreadie: Pulch

            VVherein hee shewe great contentment, and willingnesse to die, and change this lyfe with a better. For hee knewe, by his singular wisedome and pietie; Nihil esse stultius, quam ad praemia coelestia non obsequio voluntatis accurrere, sed necessitatis vinculo invitum trahi.
            
            And, for his farther comfort, receaved the holie SACRAMENT of the Bodie and Blood of the LORD IESUS CHRIST, vvith great devotion, in the companie, and together, with diverse Reverend and Godlie Men, the Ministers of

both the Townes; vnto whom hee verie heartilie, in token of his agreement, and comfort hee had of their fellowship in his lyfe, gaue his Blessing, and recommended them vnto the Grace of GOD.
            After which, strength and speach fayling, hee gaue diverse tokens, to them who were present, of a mynde setled and established, by Fayth and Hope, in assurance of the Mercie of GOD, in the remission of his sinnes. And then the extremitie of paynes chased that Soule of his, out of the tabernacle of this flesh; which the Angels haue carried vnto the Bosome of his Father ABRAHAM; being delivered from the wearisomnesse, and perils of this lyfe, and now eateth the Fruits of his labours; and his Conscience, the comfort of his former fidelitie: and with vnspeakeable joye awayteth for our comming thither.

                  LORD, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy Word.
               
            
            
               THese words (dearly beloved in our Lord and Saviour) which I haue read in your present audience, according to the opinion of some, are the words of Prayse; and of others, are the words of Petition. Of Prayse
               ▪ olde Simeon in them having now gotten the performance of that Promise made vnto him, That hee should not see Death, till hee saw the LORD'S Anoynted: and having the Babe, CHRIST IESVS, in his arms, he prayseth GOD for this performance; and acknowledgeth, That now Hee was letting him depart i

                   peace; for his eyes (according to His word of promise made vnto him) had seene his Salvation. And those who so expound this Text, haue for their warrand the word

               , in the present tyme.
            
               Some, agayne, (both Ancient and Moderne) make these wordes, to bee the wordes of Petition, and to contayne the holie desire of this happie olde Man; wherein now having gotten in his lyfe-tyme a sight of his promised and longed-for Saviour, whyle Hee was presented in the Temple, he desireth now a peaceable and happie departure; as having seene Him who is the death of Death, and LORD of Lyfe, after whom hee longed.
            In which Text we haue to consider, 1. That there is a Departure out of this lyfe: 2. That this is commō to the Servants of GOD, aswel as to the wicked; therefore sayth old SIMEON, Now, LORD, let thy servant depart. 3. Wee see how the death of GOD'S servants is called; to wit, a Dimission, or freedome, to depart. 4. The difference betweene the death and departure of the Godlie and the wicked; to wit, the one is in Peace, the other not. 5. From whom this peaceable departure is had; and, what is the ground of the Godlie's assurance of the LORD'S granting the same; to wit, His Word and Promise. And last, what is it that maketh the death of the Godlie to bee peaceable, and, by consequence, so appetible▪ to wit, even the sight of the LORD'S Salvation: For

            First, then, wee see, that as there is an oritur, or an entrie into this lyfe by birth; so there is a moritur, or a departure out of this lyfe by death: a Genesis wee haue by the one, an Exodus by the other. And this is grounded vpon that common Law, by reason of Man's transgression; Dust thou art, and to dust thou shalt returne. Wherevnto is agreeable t

                  ▪ Heb. 13.14▪
                For we haue here no continuing citie, (sayeth S. Paul) and our juorney is from the wombe to the worme, carried in the swift chariot of tyme, vpon the two restlesse wheeles of motion and mutation, till we arriue at that innes in ende, wherein wee shall say to corruption, Thou art our Father; and to the worme, thou art our brother and our sister.
               Job. 17.
                     •
                  4. And as wee were made of the earth, and liue on it, so wee shall returne to it, to rest in it, till wee ryse from it, age still wearing vs, sicknesse preparing, death arresting, the graue expecting, &amp; the wormes at last welcomming vs. Therefore well may it be saide of all as it was wittilie saide to a Grammarian, that tho hee could decline a nowne in everie case, yet death can not bee by any declined in no case.
            WHENCE WEE LEARNE; 1. Seeing our mansion place is not here, but (as Isai sayeth) our age departeth, and is removed from vs as a shepheards tent,Isa. 38.12, and wee must depart our selues at last, and (as the Apostle subjoyneth) then come to judgement; Therefore the rememberance of our departure should ever bee before our eyes, and a daylie preparation for the same should ever be our practise, praying with Moses, Lord teach vs to number our dayes, that wee may applye our heartes vnto wisedome;Psal. 90.1
                     •
                  
                &amp; acknowledging this only to be true wisedome, to worke out the worke of our owne salvation in feare and in trembling: therefore sayeth one, Mors tibi semper sit in tua cogitatione, quia ea semper est in tui expectatione. Which moved Abraham to make a buriall place his first possession in the promised land, and Ioseph of Arimathea to haue his tombe in his garden of pleasure. Nothing being more powerfull than this daylie rememberance, to kill sin, quell pryd, quench concupiscence, convince auarice, confound luxurie, abate vaine-glorie, and weane

our hearts from all worldlie vanitie: and therefore this having bene ever the godlies Arithmeticke, the Saincts Geometrie, and the Christians Philosophie.
            
            
               2Seeing we must depart from this world, then let not our soules bee insnared, and intangled with the loue of the world; let vs eschew the serpents curse, to bee still cleaving to the dust of the earth; or with Esau, to content with the fatte of the same: let vs not bee so base as to be filii terrae onlie, &amp; earth wormes who are borne anew, to be children to God, &amp; citizens of Heaven; but in tyme separate our selues in affection therefra, vsing the same as if wee vsed it not: that our separation by dissolution therefra may bee the fruition of a better inheritance: and considering that a little earth must once containe, whom the whole earth can not content.
            
               3Seeing we must depart from hence, and that wee know not how soone, (as the Lord sayde vnto Abraham, Exi de terra tua) we be in lykemanner charged to goe out of this earthlie tabarnacle, let vs forecast with our selues, and thinke of our after-estate, which is not to bee for a short tyme, but eternall for ever: and therefore let vs be like that wise steward spoken of in the Gospell, &amp; make friends to our selues with the mammon of iniquitie; that when wee fayle, wee may be receaved into everlasting habitations; Prospice &amp; praemitte, must bee the practise then of a prudent Christian; that so he may know the reason of his cupio dissolvi, to bee with the Apostle; this confidence of his after-estate, esse cum CHRISTO: else dolefull will bee the sight of death, lyke Iehues march be towards him, when hee can onlie say this, or worse, with that heathen wretch, Animula blandula vagula, quae nunc abibis inloca?
            
            And if it please the Lord in this lyfe to exercise vs

with crosses, or discontentments, yet let vs not grudge with our lot, but possesse our Soules with patience, &amp; remember, that our tyme of bearing the crosse after our Saviour, is but short; &amp; a tyme draweth neare, wherein wee shall depart from them, &amp; they in lyke manner giue an eternall farewell to vs: the Canaanite shal no more be in the land, the rod of the wicked shall be no more vpon the backe of the righteous, the godlie shall no more sowe in teares; but it shal be sayd to the soule by her blessed Bryde-groome, as wee haue in the Canticles, Aryse, my loue,
               Cant.

               my faire one, and come away; for loe, the winter is past, the raine is over, and gone; The flowers appeare on the earth, the tyme of singing of birds is come, and the voyce of the turtle is heard in our Land, &amp;
               
                  Vespera quos flentes ducit sata sancta ferentes,

            Secondly, this Text intimateth vnto vs, that death, or this bodylie departure, is common to Gods servants, as well as to the wicked: therefore sayeth old Simeon, Now, Lord, let thy servant depart in peace: and accordingly doeth the Psalmist inquire, without any exception, saying, What man is hee that liveth, and shall not see death? for which cause wee see that this is ever the common clausule of that record of the lyues of all those worthies from Adam to Noah, Gen. 5. [and 
                     •
                  ee died.] Howsoever, then, that Abraham bee commended for fayth, Isaac for pietie, Iacob for integritie, Ioseph for chastitie, Moses for meeknesse, Samuell for vprightnesse, David for zeale▪ 
               Salomon for wisdome, and Iob for patience, &amp;c. yet deaths sythe mowed them all downe as grasse, and they slept with their Fathers.
            The reasons of which the Lords doing, are, 1. For the manifestation of his trueth, in that threatening

of Adam, and all his posteritie, Dust thou art, and to dust thou shalt returne: 2. For declaration of his power, 1. over sinne, which brought in death, wherein Gods wonderfull power is seene, that hee maketh death which sinne brought in, vtterlie to abolish sinne which bred and brought in the same: so that thereof it may bee sayde, Filia devoravit matrem: and that sinne which in vs grace maketh moribundum, death killeth out-right, and maketh it to bee mort
                     •
                  um: the brood of this viper gnawing foorth so, the wombe which hatched the same, and Goliah's sword cutting off as it were his owne head. Next, hereby the Lord declareth his power over death (as well as formerlie, over sinne by death) that altho death seeme so to prevaile over the Godlie, as to turne their bodies into dust, and to haue them surelie laid fast in his strong holde of the graue: yet as Potiphars wyfe catched onlie and kept the vpper garment of Ioseph, but himselfe went free, and thereafter being advanced was royallie arrayed; even so death layeth holde or elie on the garment whereof wee must bee vncloathed, before our better part get free, or that wee bee gloriouslie arrayed in that place of heavenlie advancement: As also, the power of our good GOD shall appeare yet more wonderfull, when in the resurrection, death and the graue shall render vp the bodies of his elect, as being onlie there Depositum: and as the Apostle sayeth, that which was sowne in corruption, and weaknesse, shall aryse in incorruption, in glorie, and in strength. And 4. This is done by the Lord, for working a conformitie of the members with their head, CHRIST IESVS, that as he tasted of death, and thereby entred into lyfe eternall; so must they in lykemanner. And last, as Saynct Augustine sayth. It is ad certamen, and that by the strugling

with the feare thereof, and overcomming the same, the strength and power of fayth may appeare, the fortitude of patience, and the victorie of the Godlie thereby▪ may be the more compleet and glorious. Therefore sayth that holie Ancient, Si enim parva virtus esset fidei quae perdilectionem operatur,
               
                  Aug. de peccatorum meriti

                      &amp; remissione. lib. 2. pag. 147. 
               mortis metum vincere non esset tanta martyrum gloria, nec diceret Dominus, majorem hac charitatē nemo habet quam ut animam suam ponat pro amicis suis, nequaquā ergo pro justitia in morte subeunda vel contemnenda landaretur praecipua patientia, si mortis non esset magna multum

                   mercedem.
            
            The third thing which we haue to consider in this Text, is, how the death of Gods servants is called, as the word 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                signifieth vnto vs; to wit, that the same is a dimission from servitude or captivitie, or a departure out of prison. This prison being the bodie, the doore whereof by death is opened, that the soule may goe free: and as Noah's doue returned to him who sent her foorth, with an oliue branch in her bill; so the spirit of man which came from God, may returne (as sayeth Ecclesiastes) vnto God that gaue it: Mors ergo obstretricatur animae. Death then is but the midwyfe to the soule: and as our first birth brought vs out of the prison of the wombe, and our second out of nature and sinne; so this third and last birth, by death, shall bring vs perfectlie, the soule out of the prison of the bodie, and the whole man out of the prison of all worldlie miserie; the pangues of death-being but the showers or throwes of the bodies travelling before the foules deliverie; and our sicklie groanes and dead rattle at last, beeing but the sound of the jaylours key (as it was opening the prison doore.) Death doeth then to the

Godlie, as GIDEON and his souldiours did to their earthen pitchers, wherein the burning lamps were inclosed, and as it were imprisoned: their earthen pitcher is broken, that the lampe of their soule may bee at libertie, and shyne more brightlie in Glorie: or as the fyre of that fornace wherein the three children were casten, did onelie burne the fetters wherwith they wer bound, without harming themselues; even so death bursteth onelie that bond of naturall lyfe whereby the soule &amp; bodie are tyed together here in miserie; but can not bereaue vs of our true lyfe, eyther in Christ of grace, or with Christ of glorie. As Pharao's Butler then was glad at the ende of the three dayes, to go
                  •
                out of prison▪ and comfortable was the incomming of the jaylour to him for his liberation; so whe
                  •
                the few and evill dayes of the pilgrimage, and the imprisoment of the Lords servāts in their bodies, is at an ende, O how joyfull is the comming of the messenger of death vnto them! for as the wicked man dying, may say vnto death, as Ahab sayd to Eliah, Hast thou found mee,
               1. Kings. 21.20. 
               O myne enemie? and trembleth (lyke Felix) at the hearing of the same; so on the contrarie,Act. 24.26. as Adoniah sayde to Ionathan the sonne of Abiather, Come in, for thou art a valiant man, and bringest good tydings.
               1. King▪ 1.4
                     •
                  
                And as David in lyke manner sayde of Ahimaaz, that hee was a good man, and brought good tydings with him:2. King. 18. so death is a good messenger to them, and bringeth good tydings with him; even (as the Angell sayde to the sheepheards at CHRISTS birth) Tydings of great joye; to wit, that their soules are to be fred from all earthlie miserie, and to enter into eternall joy: and that as the blessed of the Lord, they shall rest from their labours, and their workes follow them. Therefore as Laban welcomed

               Abrham's servant, and sayd, Come in, thou blessed of the Lord: even so the Godlie may justlie welcome death, and invite him as it were to come in, the curse, and course, whereof to them is turned to a blessing.
            Seeing therefore the death of the Godlie, is a freedome, and delyverie, out of prison, and captivitie, we see how farre we should be from the loue of this lyfe, being the tyme onelie of such a painfull imprisonment, such a languishing labour, an Egyptian bōdage, a Babylonish captivitie, a woful exile, a stormy seavoyage, a weariesome pilgrimage, &amp; a dangerous warrefare, fraile it selfe; and having an hourlie and circular necessitie of such frayle things to support the pillars thereof, whose foundation is in the dust, which is nourished by dust, and in ende the honour &amp; vigour whereof must be laide in the dust; involved in a world of vanities, and wrapped about with a cloud of vexations, carnall lusts, thornie cares, and domesticke discontentments; Satan

               empting without, corruption betraying within, the conscience stinging, pleasures alluring, feares affrighting, adversitie fretting, prosperitie flattering, sickenesse assaulting, and death ever at last (as a burreau) attending our execution; besides, who can recount the losses and crosses, the cares and calamities, disquyetings &amp; discontentments, with the miseries &amp; mutabilities that are incident to this mortall and momentarie lyfe; rightlie therefore compared to grasse, which withereth; a flowre, which fadeth; a buble, or water bell, which breaketh; smoke, which evanisheth; a weavers shittle, which passeth▪ a traveller, who posteth; the fatte of lambes which consumeth; a shepheards tent, which f
                  •
               itteth; a fraile ship, which floateth; a dreame, without soliditie; a thought, for celeritie;

a hyrelings tyme, for miserie: and, in a word, meere and onlie vanitie. Wherein to be then, is not to liue, but to be daylie dying, thoughts tossing the mynde, cares torturing the heart, paines pinching the bodie, pensiuenesse possessing the soule, feares fretting, crosses consuming, and death at last consummating. And wherein there is not any houre wherein we are not eyther in the remembrance of calamities by-past, or the sense of some present, or vnder the feare and foresight of some that are to come. So that it is most true which Iob sayeth of man in this lyfe;

            Seeing the death of the Godlie is a parting, &amp; not a perishing;2 a delyverie, and not a destruction; an annalysing, &amp; not an annihilating, In qua potius miseria Christiani,
               Phil. 1.23.

thirsteth for God, even for the living God: when shall I come, and appeare before God? Or with S. Paull,

                  s, to bee his Queene: If David rejoyced when hee came backe triumphing after the slaughter of Goliah; and if the earth it selfe rang for joye with the acclamations of the coronation of Salomon; O how joyefull a day is that wherein the poore soule of a Christian, is married gloriouslie with Him who is King of kings, and Lord of lords; and at the sight of that blessed Brydegroome, (as at Elizabeth's hearing of the blessed virgines salutation the Baptist did) how doeth that soule spring and leape for joye? O with what joyefull acclamations also doe these glorious spirits welcome the triumphant soule that is victorious over the enemies of Gods glorie, and man's good, and who so rejoyce at the conversion of a sinner, much more shall they not at the coronation of a Saynct, assumed vp to heaven, associate to the Patriarches, made equall with the Angels, and conformed to Christ?
            The fourth thing which this Text offereth to our consideration, is the difference betweene the death of the Godlie, and the death of the wicked: the one is

in peace, the other not: therefore, sayeth the Prophet,Isai. 57. 
               There is no peace to the wicked (sayeth my GOD.) But on the contrary, Marke the Godlie, and the vpright man,
               Psal. 37.37. (sayeth the Psalmist) For the ende of that man is peace: for according to his soules estate, (as sayth Isaias) hee entereth into peace; and according to his bodie,Isai. 57.2. he resteth in the graue, as a sweet sleeping bed: so that hee may say with David, I will lay mee downe in peace,
               Psal. 4.8. 
               and sleepe; And when I awake, I shall be satisfied with thy lykenesse. The cause of which death in peace,Psal. 17.15. is the lyfe of grace: and because they lived the lyfe of the righteous, therefore they die the death of the righteous. But as for the wicked, they depart not in peace, because their life was destitute of grace: both which the Apostls joyne as inseparable in their salutations [grace and peace:] therefore sayth the Prophet of them, The way of peace they haue not knowne, and there was no vprightnesse in their goings:
               Isai. 59.8. 
               but they made them crooked pathes, wherein whosoever goeth, hee shall not know peace: wherefore they shall be in death, as Balthassar was in his agonie, seeing nothing but their guiltie conscience wryting bitter things against them; sorrowing for their sinnes bygone; being in anguish for their present miserie, and in terrour for torments to come. Satan now accusing them, the conscience convicting them, the lawe condemning them, the Gospell forsaking them, the Heavens debarring them, and (lyke Ionas whale) hell gaping to swallowe them. O dreadfull perplexitie, when feare is so on everie syde▪ a wrathfull judge aboue, vnquenchable flames beneath, a gnawing worme within, a dreadfull dittie before, fearfull fiends about, and a dolefull doome at hand. Whereas on the contraire, the death of the Godlie hath peace for perplexitie, solace for sorrow, and for dreadour, desire

of dissolution, their sinnes are silent, their conscience calme; the Law absolveth them, the Gospell comforteth them▪ their Saviour attendeth them, Heaven is open to them, the Angels accompanie them, &amp; their good workes doe follow them. O comfortable is the clayme that the soule maketh in that houre, to God, as a reconciled Father▪ to Christ, as her bryde-groome, and Saviour; to his blood, as her ransome; to his sufferings, as her satisfaction; to his promises, as the covenant; to Heaven, as his purchase for her; and to the societie of the Sayncts and Angels, as fellow-citizens in eternall glorie with her.
            1. Seeing then, that this is onlie the priviledge of Gods servantes, to depart in peace, let not Satan's slaues, in their senselesse securitie, clayme or expect the same: For such a Pearle, is not for swyne; nor this Bread of God's Children, is not to be given to doggs. Therefore, it may be sayde to them,
                  
                     •
                  . Kinsg. 9. as Ieh
                     •
                  
                sayd to Ioram, What hast thou to doe with peace, so long as thy impieties are so manie, and thy impenitencie so great? Or as the Lord sayth to the wicked, What hast thou to doe,
               Psal. 50.
                     •
                  6. 
               to take my Covenant of peace in thy mouth, &amp; that thou shouldest expect to die the death of the righteous, who wilt not liue the lyfe of the righteous? Seeing that, Qui in vita moritur per viti
                     •
                  , certò in morte transire oportet ad aeterna supplicia?
            
            2. Seeing the departure of the Godlie is in peace, &amp; that (as the Prophet sayeth) in that houre they enter into peace, or into a joyfull and peaceabe estate,Isai. 17▪
                resting from their labours; it followeth then, that they depart not with the terrifying expectation of a fyrie purgatorie, wherein their perplexed soules are to satisfie, and suffer in those infernall flames, no lesse torment nor the soules of the damned, except onlie in shorter indureance. For this were not to die in

peace, but perplexitie, and in the fitt of such a pani
                  •
                feare as over-tooke Balthasser, and by which▪ their godlesse and groundlesse assertion, whereby lyke the scorpion tailes of those locusts in the Revelation, they stryke with the terrour of torment poore simple soules, Gods mercie is marred, CHRISTS merit maimed, his trueth belyed, his death debased, his sufferings stained, and his people abused, by these who haue made gaine their godlinesse; but not godlinesse to bee gaine; turning Gods Temple againe into a Den of thieues; and therein making merchandise, not of doues,Revel. 18.13 but of mens soules, (as is fore-tolde of them) being better seene (as one sayeth) in the golden number of actuall receat, nor for their warrand in this poynt, in the dominicall letter of sacred and holie Writ.
            Out of these thinges also which haue bene formerlie spoken, to wit, that the death of Gods servants, is a peaceable departure out of the prison of this bodie, and miseries of this world, wee may consider these three things in the same; to wit, the 1 necessitie of their death; 2. The facilitie; and 3. The felicitie thereof. Necessitie, which maketh resolution; facilitie; which giveth consolation; and felicitie, which causeth appetition. Necessitie showeth it to bee in evitable; facilitie, easily tollerable; and felicitie, greatlie desiderable.
            
               1The necessitie is herein, that it is our Posse-over, &amp; that wee must depart out of the Egypt of this world, before wee can enter into that heavenlie Canaan. A dissolution it is called; and therefore, a separation must be of the soule from the bodie, before that coelestiall vnion can bee effectuated with our Saviour Christ. A devesting of Mortalitie must be, before we put on Immortalitie;2. Cor. 54. and a throwing downe of our

earthlie tabernacle, before wee get that better house to dwell in, not made with hands, eternall in the Heavens.
            2. The facilitie of the death of Gods servants, is in this, that their death is a peaceable departure; death having lost its perplexing feare, its paynfull sting, and horrid shape; and the soule being more ravished with that approaching sight of God, than the bodie is payned with the sense of death: the passion of mortalitie, being so beaten backe with the impression of aeternitie, that the soule is so farre from slackenesse to goe foorth,Gen. 1
                     •
                  . (as Lot was out of Sodom) as on the contrarie, it hasteth to bee in that place, where it may truelie say with the disciples, Bonum est nobis esse hic: even as Abraham hasted to meete the Angels; or Peter and Iohn hasted to the graue to see that CHRIST was risen. And as willinglie they lay downe the bodie, when death commeth for them, as Peter did his shackels wherof he was vnloosed,Act. 1
                     •
                  . when the Angell came to bring him out of prison. Hence it is called in Scripture, onelie a falling asleep, a giving vp the Ghost, a gathering to our fathers, a laying downe of this earthlie tabernacle, and an vnclothing of vs, lyke Ioseph, of his prison garments, or the prodigall of his beggerlie raggs, to bee gloriouslie arrayed, and highlie advanced to a heavenlie preferment, where all losses are recompenced, all wants supplied, all crosses removed, all teares wiped away, all promises performed, and all happinesse procured; where Satan is trod vnder, death overcome, corruption abolished, sanctification perfected, and glorie at last obtayned.
            3. The felicitie also of the death of the Godlie, in the bright sight of the Lords salvatiō, is vnutterable, when that eternall Sabbath commeth, and joyefull

jubile approacheth, when the Lambes Bryde shall enter into that marriage Chamber, to sight most specious, in rowme most spacious, and in beautie most glorious; wherin to come, is hghiest dignitie; to dwel, is greatest felicitie; and to liue in, is most joyfull eternitie: the pleasures whereof are so plentifull, that for greatnesse they can not bee measured; so manie, that they can not bee numbered; so precious, that they can not bee esteemated; and so dureable, that they can not bee limited: which wee shall enjoye, without wearinesse; admire, without ignorance; affect, without measure; and feed on, without loathsomnesse: never to bee terminated, impossible to be determinated: where securitie is with safetie; peace, with all plentie; light, with all libertie; rest, with all rejoycing; and tranquillitie, with all felicitie: where youth flowrisheth, that never fadeth; health continueth, which never altereth; beautie lasteth, which never blasteth; loue aboundeth, which never abateth; and lyfe endureth, which never endeth.
            The fift poynt, is, from whom this peaceable departure is sought; to wit, from the Lord, who onelie can make it such, by that inward assurance of reconcilement with himselfe; wherein as wee see the practise of the Godlie, ever for all good, or comfort, eyther in lyfe or death, to haue their constant recourse to God onelie, and to no creature, Saynct, or Angell, whatsoever. So wee see, that the godlie are so farre from putting the memorie of death away (as others doe) from before their eyes, as a tormenter of them before the tyme, that they holde it ever in their sight, and (with olde Simeon here, and the Apostle) earnestlie desire the approach thereof,Psal. 142.7. saying with the Psalmist, Bring my soule out of prison, O Lord, that I may prayse thy Name. And so they can

not onelie pray with Moses, Lord, teach vs to number our dayes, that wee may apply our heatrs vnto wisdome; but also can wish the acceleration thereof in GODS good tyme; even as the workman longeth for the shadow; or the hyreling, for the ende of his worke.Iob. 
                     •
                  .2. And this they doe not out of a fitt of impatience, as wee see in Ionas; nor out of such discontent, as wee perceaue even in Godlie Eliah; but out of a longing,Ionas 43.1, King. 19.4 Psal. 42. with David, to see Gods face with joye, and of that happie conjunction with CHRIST, whereof the Apostle speaketh. Hence it is, that they make not themselues for death when sicknesse commeth, because they must die, out of natures necessitie; but because they would die, out of graces desire: manie things giving vp their last worke at death, which make the godlie with the Apostle to crye out in life, Who shall delyver mee from this bodie of death? For then Satan giveth his last assault, sinne leaveth her temptation; the world its allurement; corruption, its repyning; the conscience, its accusing; the bodie, its painfull toyle; and men their hurtfull injuring: and then the soule, in the strongest affection thereof, (set vpon Heaven and heavenlie thinges) having gone before, now in its purified substance, is not so much thrust by deaths hand out of the bodie, (as Lot was out of Sodom by the Angell) as it goeth foorth joyefullie (lyke Noah out of the Arke) and is pulled into that coelestiall Mansion, by the hand of God, as the Doue was taken into the Arke againe, when shee could find no rest to the sole of her foote.
            The last thing which this Text offereth to our consideration, is the reason of this wish of olde Simeon, or what it is that maketh the death of the godlie, to bee peaceable, &amp; consequentlie so appetible; to wit, even the sight of the Lords Salvation; for so

calleth hee CHRIST, and which word in the greeke (
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ) signifieth as much, as that hee is the author, yea, the verie treasurie and store-house where in all salvation is contayned: as hee is lykewyse called so by the Prophet (Isai. 52.10.) and so clearlie distinguished from all others, who in Scripture were styled by the name of Saviours. Neyther is it, that wee must thinke that a corporall sight heere is onelie meant, for that was common; but that with the eye of fayth also, which is speciall and proper onelie to the elect, hee sawe this blessed Babe to bee that salvation, preordayned and appoynted by the LORD▪ promised, and now sent in the flesh, for the redemption of mankynd. Whence wee obserue,
            
               1In that it is formerlie sayde, that this just and devote man, Simeon, wayted for the consolation of Israell, &amp; had it revealed vnto him, by the holy Ghost, that before hee sawe death, hee should see the LORD'S Anoynted: and now that his longing is satisfied, and that promise which was made vnto him (as hee confesseth) is fulfilled, wee see, that as the Godlie hunger and thirst speciallie after spirituall things, so they are ever heard in their Godlie desires, and in such things that concerne their salvation: therefore as in Davids words doubtlesse hee had sayde before, O Lord, I haue longed for thy salvation; yea, my soule faynteth for the same:
               Psal. 119.174.81.82. 
               when wilt thou comfort mee? and with the holie Patriarches▪ (as the Apostle showeth) as hee had embraced the promise thereof spirituallie, which was made vnto him there anent; so now at last,Heb. 11. wee see, hee getteth him who was promised, to embrace in his armes corporallie; and accordinglie acknowledgeth joyfullie, that his eyes now did see the Lords salvation. And so the Lords promise is performed, his longing satisfied, and his

wayting accomplished. Let vs then onelie (with olde Simeon) wayte patientlie, and constantlie, for his consolations; &amp; rest assured that he is myndfull of vs, and his owne promises; and in his owne good &amp; fitte tyme will come vnto vs for our joye, and will make no tarrying.
            2. Wee see the ground or cause of a peaceable and comfortable death; to wit, a preceeding sight of the Lords salvation, which hee hath decreed to bee, by the Sonne of his loue, CHRIST IESUS; and for whose sake and merit of his death, hee hath admitted such of mankynd to lyfe, as hee hath elected, for the manifestation of the ritches and glorie of his grace. This therefore is the right arte of dying well, to get true fayth, and to fix the eye thereof (as the people in the wildernesse did) vpon that true brasen Serpent, CHRIST IESUS, the Lord of lyfe. Incorporate thy selfe in him then, and there shal be no condemnation to them that are in CHRIST. Wrap thy selfe in his righteousnesse, and it shall bee lyke Elias mantle, which devyded the waters of Iordan: cleaue thereby to his crosse, and it shall be lyke that tree that made the waters of Marah sweet; or Moses rod, which made a safe passage to Israell, thorow the red sea. Set the Arke of the Covenant in these waters, and from the desert of this world thou shalt haue a patent and pleasant path to that heavenlie Canaan: yea, tho stones were flinging about thy eares, to braine thee, as was done to that protomartyr Steven
               ▪ yet looking vp with the eye of fayth, &amp; getting a sight of IESUS CHRIST, standing at the right hand of his Father, readie to receaue thee, thy departure shall bee most calme and comfortable; and thy sinnes being silenced by him who is this salvation spoken of, thou shalt heare nothing but the

sweet voyce of that blood of sprinkling, which speaketh better things nor the blood of Abell; and dying, as it were, in the armes of thy Lord: As Iacob sawe with joye of heart, the chariots that Ioseph sent for him for his transportation; so shalt thou see the glorious and blessed Angels sent for thee, and thy good workes following thee; the one to guyde thee, and surrender their charge; the other to gladden thee, and receaue their reward.
            3. As wee see what is the ground of the peaceable death of the Godlie; so on the contrarie, wee may perceaue what is the cause of the terrour of death in the wicked; and that the memorie thereof so much tormenteth them before the tyme, that as Pharao did to Moses, they bid it goe packing out of their sight: even this is the cause thereof; that being blinded by Satan, all the dayes of their lyfe, in committing sinne, &amp; never once looking with a tearing eye of true repentance vpon them, therefore in death they never get a sight of this salvation of the Lords, nor haue they anie assurance, that hee who is the Saviour of the world, shall bee a Saviour to them: but on the contrarie, then they finde that hee who was their Tempter, beginneth to bee their Tormenter: then they begin to heare the clamours of their accusing conscience, to see the vglie shape of their sinfull soules, the dreadfull aspect of their haynous sinnes, the wrathfull face of the angrie Iudge; Heaven closed aboue, to debarre them, as Adam was from the tree of lyfe; and hell opened beneath, to swallow them, as the earth was to swallow vp Korah: then they beginne to feele the approaching flames of that infernall fyre, paynfullie to scorch them; the worme that never dieth, drawing neare, to guawe them; the wrath of GOD, that never shall

bee appeased, most furious to astonish them▪ and the infernall fiendes, who attende, to terrifie, and cruellie to torture them. In which wofull estate, to hyde themselues, is impossible; to avoyde these miseries, inevitable; and, to endure them, intollerable. Hence the sting of death shall torment them; the rememberance of judgement, perplexe them; the gulfe of despare, (without hope or helpe) swallowe them; and the apprehension of eternitie, in easelesse &amp; endlesse payne, confound them. O! who can then expresse their sad sorrow for sinnes past; their agonizing anguish, for miserie present, and their trembling terrours, for the tormentes to come? being justlie thus served, as they haue deserved: and finding at the dolefull parting of the sinfull soule, from the wretched bodie, (whose meeting agayne, and re-uniting, to be a faggot in hell fire, shall be much more dolefull and dolorous) no comfort from Heaven, nor earth; the Creator, nor the creature; but matter of confusion. The ground of all which deepe distresse beeing this; Because the soule (with olde Simeon here) can get no sight of the LORDS Salvation.
            4. Wee see here a neare and cleare way, howe to contemne all earthlie and worldlie thinges; the bewitching loue whereof, hath made manie to make ship-wracke of a good conscience, and clogged their hearts so to the earth, that it hath debarred them for ever from the joyes of Heaven. Eeven this is the way; Labour to get a sight of the Lord's Salvation; which if thou doe, all other thinges will seeme but dung, and losse: and that which dazeleth the eyes of the wicked, with the glorie of them, (wherewith Satan would haue tempted our SAVIOUR) will appeare vnto thee, but as they are; to wit, base dust, vayne tryf
                  •
               es, and altogether worthlesse. Then, getting

this comfortable, and contenting sight, thou wilt not care, tho thy eyes bee closed, from seeing anie other earthlie after-sight; and wilt say rather with old Simeon, Let thy servant depart in peace, from seeing farther here, in respect of that sweet sight of thy salvation, which I haue gotten by grace, and long to haue it more clearlie, and fullie in glorie. Surelie, as when the three Disciples sawe this Salvation of the Lord in His transfiguration, they despysed all sights beside, and sayd, Bonum est nobis esse hic; so will they who get this spirituall sight of Him, and assurance of salvation in Him, despyse all worldlie thinges, and say, that to be dissolved from them, and to be with Christ, is the best of all: whereas others, alia non despiciunt, quia non eum respiciunt; and are so in loue with earth, because they were never acquaynted with Heaven.
            5. If this was such joy to old Simeon, to see Christ Iesus, a poore Babe, in the estate of humilitie, that hee desired to depart in peace, O what joye is it and shall be, to His Sayncts, to see Him as He now is, in the estate of Glorie? not (as then) vpon earth, but nowe in Heaven; not amongst sinfull men, but glorious Angels, and spirites of the just: and not subject to passion, and injuries; but now in exaltation, and inhabiting prayses. Old Iaakob was so ravished with joye, when hee saw Ioseph in Aegypt, that almost with the verie lyke words he cryed out with olde Simeon, Now let me die,
               Gen. 46 30 
               since I haue seene thy face. The people of Israell also they shouted for joy, when the Arke of God came into the hoste: the earth it selfe lykewyse rang for joy, when the people saw Salomon anoynted, and crowned their king: and the Baptist also in his mothers wombe leaped for joy, at the approach of our Saviour, newlie conceaved. O then, howe shall the elect soule, departing out of this earthlie bodie,

be ravished with joye, when it shall see Christ Iesus, glorious in the Heavens; when it shall beholde that true Arke of God, and heare the Heavens ring with joyfull prayses of that true SALOMON, the King of kinges, and Lord of lordes, who sitteth vpon the Throne? And if Moses face did shyne, when hee was but a few daies with the Lord on Horeb, and saw but His back-parts; O, how shall they shyne, then, who in all aeternitie shall see Him face to face, vpon that heavenlie Mountayne? Or if those servantes of Salomons were pronounced blessed, who stood before him, and heard his wisdome; how much more blessed shall His servantes and sonnes bee, who is greater than Salomon, who in those Coelestiall Mansions stall stand before Him, heare Him, see Him, and for ever liue with Him? Whom to see, is felicitie; to heare, is heavenlie melodie; and to liue with Him, a most blessed societie.
            6. Last of all, these words of olde Simeon, decanted neare his death, are called The Song of Simeon; beeing heerein lyke the Swan, who is sayde to sing sweetlie, about that tyme when death approacheth vnto her: Wherein wee see, what way to make our death joyfull, and comfortable vnto vs; wherein we may not begin to sorrow, but to sing, to wit, with Simeon, who is sayd to be a just and devote man; to leade a holie lyfe, and embrace offered salvation: and so we shall die a happie death, and eschow damnation. Sow then in tears betyme, if thou wouldest reape in joy; and let thy tears here, prevent thy terrours hereafter; a holie lyfe, a hellish death; and true sanctification, aeternall condemnation.
            Having thus expounded this Text, I made choyse thereof in this Funerall Commemoration of the la

and Ordinarie, for these respects: 1. Two days before his happie departure, having an earnest desire to participate of the blessed Communion, with vs his Clergie, Ministers of Aberden

                  , and ordinarie Assessors; when, most devotelie, hee with vs had receaved that blessed Pledge of his Salvation, there was read vnto him thereafter this portion of holie Scripture: vnto which wordes of olde Simeon, Lord, now let thy servant depart in peace, &amp;c. (with his eyes lifted vp) hee gaue an heartie AMEN. This being then the portion of Scripture which was read, &amp; whereof he so tooke holde before his death, I haue now made choyse of at this tyme, after his death, to expound.
            Next, with this Text, and him who vttered these words, to wit, olde Simeon, this Reverende late Praelate most fitly in these things is found to symbolize: 1. Simeon was an old man; and so the Lord honoured him, in whose Funerall Commemoration these words are handled, with many years, and a full age, which is a Crowne of Glorie, being found in the way of Righteousnesse. 2. Simeon was a devote and just man; and so was this Religious Praelate, adorned both with Pietie and Equitie; devote towardes God in his worship of Him, and just towardes men in his dealinges with them. 3. Simeon was of good report amongst his people; and so was this worthie Praelate, as Paull willeth a Bishop to bee, of good report, even amongst those that were without
               ▪ and of a singular both great respect and good report amongst them that were within, both in Church and Policie. 4. Simeon was a Priest in the Iewish Church; so this Venerable &amp; Honourable Mā was a Praelate in the Christian Church; advanced to that top of Eminencie, for his lyfe and learning▪ worth &amp; wisdome, godlinesse and gravitie. 5. Simeon now stricken in age▪ having gotten a sight

of the LORD'S Salvation, desired to depart in peace; Even so this Reverend and Glorified Praelate, beeing also stricken in age, having not onelie gotten himselfe a sight of the LORD'S Salvation; but also having given, by his manie years preaching, a sight thereof to others; at last having finished his course with joye, hee desired lykewyse to depart in peace, and be with his LORD. Of whose blamelesse lyfe, sound literature, vigilant care, sober conversation, good behaviour, hospitall heart, (all relucent Vertues requisite in a Bishop) besides his kyndnesse and cowrage, prudence and patience, worth and other Vertues, rare partes, and just prayses; seeing my Reverend Colleagues which went before, haue more amplie discoursed, ne ligna in sylvas feram; and that my Speach seeme not to wrong, by a ruder rehearsall, and needlesse tautologie, what so truelie &amp; worthilie hath beene alreadie spoken, I can not but abruptlie ende; deploring the losse which both Church and Common-wealth sustayneth in him▪ who (as yee all knowe) was borne honourablie, lived amongst vs piouslie, preached the Trueth powerfullie, mayntayned the same couragiouslie, ruled in this Church prudentlie, died at last most comfortablie, and nowe resteth (wee hope) vvith CHRIST IESUS in Glorie aeternallie: To whom, with the Father, and the holie Spirit, be ascribed all Honour, Glorie, Majestie, Prayse, Power, and Dominion, for ever and ever, world without ende: AMEN.

Glorious, 1. considered in themselues, and with reference to the high Priests Dignitie, and one of the most precious things in the world; highlie esteemed, and most carefullie kept by the Iewes, as you may see at length in Iosephus.

               the sonne of Syrach, speaking of this, (Eccles. 45.7.) sayth, that God beautified or blessed the high Priest, with comely Ornaments; and cloathed him with a Robe of glorie. Hee put vpon him perfect glorie; and strengthened him with rich Garmentes. And vers. 13. Before him there were none such: neyther did anie stranger ever put them on; but onelie his children, and his childrens children, perpetuallie. 2. Much more precious yet were they in respect of their signification; which was, 1. of the incompable excellencies of Christ Iesus, that great high Priest for ever, who is the ende of the Lawe, adorned with all perfections, whereby hee is to GOD most acceptable, and most venerable to vs. 2. Of the excellencie required in those of that place, whether vnder the Law, or vnder the Gospell; which challengeth greater perfection. That (sayeth Beda) which outwardlie did shyne in the Ornamentes of the Priestlie Vestmentes,

               should inwardly be deeplie seated in the mynds of our Priestes; being spirituallie vnderstood; and should outwardlie shyne glorious in their actions, aboue the ordinarie vertues of the faythfull. It is not anough for them, to be lyke vnto other men, though good: for the Priestlie Authoritie (sayth Ambrose) requireth a singular weyght of vertues,

               and a most serious endevour therevnto. So Greg. Nazianzen, speaking of sainct Basil, sayeth, that hee accounted the vertue of a private man, to stand in fleeing of evill, and attayning to some degree of goodnesse: But that it is blameable in a Praelate, not to bee excellent; since even by his excellencie scarce can hee drawe people to a mediocritie of vertue. The Christian Church hath thought it good, to enjoyne her Priestes, even an outward habit, and conversation, differing from that of others: But much more different, and much more excellent, should bee the inward disposition, and

vertues of their mynd, which is before God of great pryce. Let the Priests be cloathed with Salvation; and the Sayncts shall shout for joye. PSAL. cxxxij.16.
            In the wordes which I haue read,II. The first part. a singular piece of this holie Vestment is commanded to be made; to wit, the plate of the holie Crowne,
               I. Of the holie Crown, what it was. having this inscription, HOLINESSE TO THE LORD. Let vs consider, 1. The Crowne it selfe: 2. The inscription of it. The accomplishment of this commandement heere concerning it, is set down, EXOD. xxxix.30. And they made the plate of the holie Crowne of pure golde, &amp; wrote thereon a wryting lyke to the ingraving of a signet, HOLINESSE TO THE LORD. SO LEVIT. viij.9. And hee put the Mitre on his head: also vpon the Mitre, even vpon his fore-front, did he put the golden plate, the holie Crowne, which the Lord commanded Moses. ECCLESIAST. xlv.12. He set a crowne of gold vpon the mitre, wherein was ingraven HOLINESSE; an ornament of honour, a costlie worke, the desire of the eyes, goodlie and beautifull. Here it is called a plate of golde, EXOD. 29. a crowne of holinsse, 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               . It was, as it were, a semi-circle, from the one eare, to the other, vpon the fore-front of the mitre, tied behind with a blew lace, EXOD. xxviij.37. And thou shalt put it on a blew lace, that it may be vpon the mitre: vpon the fore-front of the mitre it shall be. Iosephus sayth, that beside the ordinarie Cap of the Priestes, the high Priest had another, which a golden crowne did compasse,
                  Ioseph. lib.

                  ▪
                in a threefold order. His words are these; The high Priests Hat was such as the other Priestes vsed; on which there stood another sewed therevnto, and flowrished with Hyacynthyn. This, after a triple order, was environed with a golden crowne, in which there were divers vessels of gold, made after such a sort as may be seene in that herbe which we call Daccharus; and amongst the Grecian Herbalists,

Henbane. But the Scripture, though verie exact in the description of these garmentes, mentioneth no such thing. Howsoever, the plate was the ornament, and, as it were, the crowne of the high Priests crown. And indeed it was a kynd of crown covering a good part of the head, from the one eare, to the other before, vpon the Mitre.
            
               A Crowne was appoynted, to adorne the head, the most eminent,II. What signifieth a Crowne. and most absolute part of the bodie; to declare, that it signified the greatest and most excellent thing. No greater thing amongst men, than Vertue; and the reward thereof, Honour, as the Philosopher calleth it.
                  Arist. lib. 4. de moribus. cap. 17. Therefore a Crowne was vsed, to signifie Holinesse, Ingine and Learning, Cowrage and Victorie, and finallie, high Dignities, Ioye, and Felicitie therein. All this was signified by a Crowne. Hence whatsoever in lyfe is perfect, and excellent, even the top, ende, consummation, and perfection of everie thing is so called. He that sayth a Crown, sayth al this. Ecclesiasticus 1.2. The feare of the Lord is Honor, &amp; Glorie, Gladnesse, &amp; a Crown of rejoycing Ecclesiasticus 25.6. Much experience, is the Crown of old men; &amp; the feare of God, is their glorie. Plinie sayth, that a Crowne was not given of olde to anie,
                  Plin lib. 16. cap.

                  . but to GOD. The Hebrew Doctors make a three-folde Crowne, of Kingdome, of Knowledge, and of Priesthood. Of which last wee are now more particularlie to speake.
            This Crowne was given to the high Priest by God; 1. Because he was a type of Christ,III. What signified this Crowne of Priesthood Clem. Alex. lib. 5.

                  n everlasting Kingdome, and whose dominion hath no end. DAN. vij.14. And this is marked by Clem. Alexandr. who sayeth, that the golden Hat of the high Priest, exalting him, did signifie 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , the Royall power of our Lord. 2. To

signifie the dignitie of his priestlie Office, and the excellencie or Crown of Vertues, wherwith such should be adorned, both then and now. For if the dignitie of high Priests was so great vnder the Old Testament, and their Vertues answerable therevnto; how much greater is the dignitie of Priesthood vnder the New Testament, and of Vertues requyred to it? 2. COR. 3.7. If the ministration of death written and ingraven in stones, was glorious, &amp;c. how shall not the ministration of the Spirit be rather glorious?

                cowrage, and hope, bee so great; how much more is it with the spirituall rulers, whose duetie is to leade and bring them to the Crowne? According to the ancient phrase, all Christian Bishops are summi Sacerdotes, high Priests: albeit in the third Councell of Carthage this Title was forbidden, because by some abused, to cherish their ambition. Great is their preheminence, great and manie their battels; wherein if they acquyte themselues worthilie, there abydeth them a farre more glorious Crowne, than others, 1. PET. 5.4. The Civicke Crowne, or Garland, was much esteemed of amongst the Romanes. Plin. calleth it, the most notable testimonie of militarie vertue: yet was it given for the saving of one. How much then was the Crowne to bee esteemed, which was called Graminea, given for the safetie of the whole Armie? Plin. Such a Crowne belongeth to a faythfull Bishop. He not onlie saveth his owne soule, but the soules of manie. They that turne manie to righteousnesse, shall shyne as the starres, for ever and ever, DAN. 12.3. What more Divine thing can there bee, than to bee a worker with GOD, in procuring the salvation of men, for whom the Blood of CHRIST was shed? Of all Divine Perfections, (sayeth that olde Wryter that goeth vnder the name of Dionysius the Areopagite) it is the most Divine, to bee GOD'S Fellow-worker; especiallie in so Divine a worke, as is the saving of soules. What advantageth it a man, to gayne the whole vvorlde,

if hee lose his soule? There can bee nothing aequalled to the soule, (sayeth Chrysostome) in the whole world:
                  Chrysost. hom. 3. in Ep. 5. ad Corinth▪
                  
                and therefore sayeth hee, Though thou wouldest giue huge riches to the poore, yet shouldest thou doe more, by converting one soule. How glorious a thing had it beene for a man, to haue beene a worker with GOD in the framing of this worlde!
               
                  Chrysost. Hom. 55. ad popul. Antioch.
                
               But (to applie to our purpose the wordes of that same golden mouth) GOD giveth a greater honour to Pastors; to whom Hee sayeth, as it were, I haue made Heaven and Earth; but I giue thee power to make Earth Heaven:

               If anie man will strayne the wordes farther, and labour to finde the Pope's triple Crowne of Golde heere, his travell will bee lost: For that is exalted not onlie aboue the Church, but also aboue the Crowns of Kinges, directlie, or indirectlie: and the inscription (as if that of Christ's Vicar were too base) is a Monarch, a Spirituall King: so Cajet. Cathar. and Salmer. speake, sayeth Lorinus. Yea, and as if this were too small, hee is intituled, The sole Emperour in the world.

Lord. Who, I pray you, gaue the Pope such a crown? Christ? His owne Kingdome was not of this worlde, IOHN 18.36. And all that Hee promised to S. Peter, was to giue him the Keyes of the Kingdome of Heaven. HEE is nowe indeed crowned with Glorie and Honour; but on earth was crowned with Thornes▪ Did saynct Peter weare a Crowne of Golde, who sayde truelie, Golde and Silver I haue none?

                  Iosephus seemeth to thinke, that GOD'S NAME was onlie ingraven heere:

                  On the same (sayeth hee) there was as it were a band of Golde, on which the NAME of GOD was ingraven. So Philo; Vnto this Crowne (sayeth hee) was prefixed a Golden Plate,

If their wordes admit this exposition, it is well▪ but though they would not receaue it, yet the wordes of holie Scripture are so cleare, that I make no doubt to thinke with others,

Wee can not conceaue GOD, but imperfectlie, or confusedlie: and our knowledge is the fountayne, and obstetrix sermonis, that which bringeth foorth our speach. Yet haue wee no name that more expresslie and distinctlie signifieth GOD, than that which is heere: for it signifieth such a one that is per essentiam, by His Essence, and from none other; whose Being never began,
                     Hilar. Lib 1 de Trinit.
                   nor shall ende; in whom is nothing bypast, or to come; no vicissitude, or change; but such a One, as is aeternall, being All at once, the Fountayne and originall of all Being; contayning in Himselfe vnited▪ and eminentlie whatsoever can be. Thus it explayneth the Divine Essence, the ground of all Divine Perfections: so that no name can manifest it more inwardlie, or better. Hence the LORD being demanded of Moses, concerning His Name, EXOD. 3.14. answed. I AM that I am: thus shalt thou say vnto the children of Israell, I AM hath sent mee vnto you. And EXOD. 6.2. hee groundeth his veracitie or fidelitie vpon this; And GOD spake vnto Moses, and sayde vnto him, I am the Lord: and I appeared vnto Abraham, Isaac, and to Iacob, by the Name of GOD ALL-MIGHTIE, (
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ) but by My NAME IEHOVAH was I not knowne vnto them. That is, I so appeared vnto them, that I did show, that I was able to giue the land of Canaan vnto them; and so, that I was, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   GOD ALL-MIGHTIE; but by this Name IEHOVAH was I not knowne vnto them; for then did I not performe My Promise: but now shall yee know, by the effect, the power of this NAME; even that I AM
                  ▪ and that I giue being to my Promises; calling the thinges that are not, as if they were. That which I haue promised, and which heretofore I haue declared to bee possible to mee, I will now reallie performe; and so will show my selfe to

bee IEHOVAH. Most justlie then is GOD called by this Name, which signifieth BEING: For not onlie giveth Hee Being to His Promises, and to all thinges else that haue anie being; but also in respect of His Infinitenesse, Hee contayneth in Himselfe all perfection of Being. Hee is Independentlie; Hee is Aeternallie; contayning and filling all Duration, Revel. 1.8.16.5. Hee is Immenselie, contayning and filling all space. Hee is Vniversallie, contayning Formallie, or Eminentlie, all that is. Hee is the Fulnesse of Being. Whatsoever Goodnesse, Beautie, Perfection, or Being, is in the creature, is in Him infinitelie more perfectlie, and fullie.
               This Being is so proper to Him, that all other things compared to Him, are not: they are nothing,
                     Aug. Trac. de eo quod dictum est▪ Ego sum &amp;c.
                   but in so farre as they are from Him, and in Him: for of Him, and through Him, and to Him, are all thinges, ROM. 11.36. ISAI. 40.17. All nations before Him are as nothing, and they are counted to Him lesse than nothing, and vanitie. The Ethnickes saw this darklie; and therefore Plato called GOD 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . Hence Nazianzen calleth Him the infinite and vnbounded Ocean of Essence: and sayeth,
                     Seneca▪ Epist. 37. that Hee onlie hath no name, and yet all names. All, because all are contayned in Him: and yet Hee is sayd to bee none of these; because Hee is aboue all thinges which wee can conceaue. Well, therefore, was this Great and Glorious Name put heere, to ground His Holinesse, to crowne and protect all the beautie of the high Priest, as saynct Hierome marketh; and to signifie,

               Holinesse.
               HOLINESSE was ingraven, together with GOD'S NAME,Holinesse. for three causes, (as it is well observed by Cajetan
                        •
                     
                  ) 1. To show, that GOD is Holie in Himselfe, agaynst those that thinke vnreverentlie of the Divine Nature, and ascrybe to it thinges vnbeseeming One that is infinitelie pure. 2. To show, that HOLINESSE is in all His works▪ agaynst those that are bolde to open their mouth to accuse His Providence, and Governement. 3. To show, that it should bee in all thinges that haue reference to Him▪ as well the inward motions of the mynde, as outward actions, sacrifices, and oblations; agaynst those that are prophane. This order wee shall follow; and therefore, (by GOD'S Grace) for opening vp of this poynt, wee shall show you, that HOLINESSE belongeth to the LORD; 1. Considered in Himselfe: 2. Considered in His workes▪ and wayes: 3. Considered with reference to those that serue Him, especiallie that are Priestes, or high Priestes. For clearing of the first branch wee will, 1. show, what is HOLINESSE; and then wee shall applie it to GOD, considered in Himselfe.

Wee learne therefore, sayeth hee there, that there is some kynde of Holinesse, and, as it were, a shadow of Sanctification; which is not sufficient for attayning Salvation. Thus, sayeth hee, the vnfaythfull husband is sanctified by the faythfull wyfe. 1. COR. 7.14. Yet may hee not therefore bee secure, as if he could

come to lyfe not baptized, and not renewed. In lyke manner speaketh hee there of th
                     •
                   
                  Holinesse of the children of the faythfull, not baptized. But to leaue this, for taking vp the nature of true Holinesse, wee are to marke, 1. That Holinesse formally is Puritie, and cleannesse of affection, in respect of sinne, contrarie to the impuritie &amp; filthinesse thereof, 2. COR. 7.1. Let vs cleanse our selues from all filthinesse of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holinesse in the feare of God. Puritie then it is whereby the blot and spot of sinne is taken away. Therefore that learned and ancient Wryter who goeth vnder the name of Dionys. Areopag. defining Holinesse, sayeth,
                     Dionys. Areopag. cap. 12. de Divin, Nom,
                   that it is Puritie altogether vnspotted, fullie perfect, and free of all sinne. 2. Obserue, that this puritie of the mynde, and perfection thereof in our thoughtes, affections, words, and actions, can not bee had, except our myndes and affections, bee conforme to GOD, the Supreme PURITIE; the participation of vvhome alone maketh pure. Hence Gregorie Nazianzen descrybeth Holinesse, to bee a conversing with GOD.

                   3. Consider that this conformitie can not bee had, except these thoughtes, affections, and actions, bee conforme to GOD'S aeternall Lawe, the supreme Rule of their perfection. As the conception of the mynde of GOD, or Idaea, is the rule of naturall perfection; so His aeternall Lawe is rule to all perfection supernaturall. His owne nature and essence is the prime, and originall source, of all both naturall and supernaturall perfection. Thence aryseth, according to our conceaving, His Lawe aeternall: I say, according to our manner of conceaving: for otherwayes it beeing nothing else but the rectitude and strayghtnesse of His Divine reason; is in effect nothing else but His owne essence, or Himselfe.

From all this followeth, that hee is Holie, and perfectlie Holie, who is so conforme to GOD, that his thoughtes, affections▪ and actions, are perfectlie conforme, and justlie answerable to His aeternall Lawe. Not then that which wee will, is holie, wherewith Augustine vpbraydeth the Donatistes; but that which is agreeable to the Lawe of GOD. Hence also appeareth, that besides the morall goodnesse vvhich is in our vertues, there is a goodnesse of holinesse, which consisteth in convenientia cum natura rationali, in agreement with reason. But this ryseth vp higher, and standeth in a conformitie with that good, perfect, holie, and acceptable will of GOD, ROM. 12. With this description of Holinesse, agreeth that of saynct Basill, wherein hee sayeth, that Holinesse importeth Puritie,

                  from all bodilie and materiall taynting, and freedome from composition. To it also agreeth the Hebrew KADASH, signifying to separate: whence KADOSH, that which is seperated from thinges vncleane and prophane, as also the Greeke 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , pure; as hee doeth 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   also. Thus wee haue layde the ground; let vs now apply it, and see how this Holinesse is in GOD Himselfe.How God is holie in Himselfe.
               
               HOLINESSE belongeth to GOD, considered in Himselfe, other wayes than to vs, and farre more excellentlie. As is His Being, so is His Holinesse. Now His Being,
                  2. Holinesse essentiall 
                        〈◊〉
                      GOD. as wee haue showne, is everie way perfect; having nothing of not-being, nothing of imperfect being; but altogether full, absolute, and infinite. It is so with His Holinesse, which will more clearlie appeare by these following considerations: First, His Holinesse is not accidentall to Him, as ours. His Divine will and manners are conforme to His aeternall

Lawe, essentiallie, and from within. By Himselfe, and by His owne essence, is Hee holie: albeit according to our manner of conceaving His aeternall Lawe, the puritie and loue in His mynde and will aryse from His essence; yet indeed His puritie is nothing else, but His owne essence, as it hath ratione
                        •
                      voluntatis: and so Hee is not onlie holie, but Holinesse it selfe. For puritie of affection, wherein Holinesse standeth, is nothing else, but the loue of GOD. Now GOD is loue, 1. IOHN 4.8.16. This no creature is▪ nor can bee: all their holinesse is by some thing supernaturall added to nature. Hence no creature by nature can bee vnpeccable, or free of possibilitie of sinning. I knowe, some Schoole-men thinke, that a creature even by nature vnpeccable, is possible. But farre truelie it is mayntayned by others.

                   Nowe this in the phrase of Ambrose, and other Ancientes, is an impossibilitie to die by sinne.
               
                  From this it followeth, That His Holinesse is a substance,3. His Holinesse substantiall. as His will, power, &amp;c. whereas that of the creature is but a qualitie, and comprehendeth many actes of the vnderstanding and wil. There must bee in the vnderstanding, light of fayth, or glorie; in the will, religion, charitie, and other vertues, praevious, or subservient therevnto. The Grace of GOD serving to this effect, is manifolde▪ 1. Pet. 4.10.
               Thirdlie; His Holinesse is independent, and that from which our holinesse manie wayes dependeth:4. Our holinesse dependeth from it manie wayes. 
                  
                     •
                  . Ours dependeth from Him, and His Holinesse, as from the originall and efficient. His Divine Essence is the roote and fountayne of all Holinesse and Puritie in the creatures. It is Hee that infuseth grace in Angels and men, that converteth vs vnto Himselfe▪ and purgeth our sinnes, Heb. 1.3. and washeth vs, Revel. 1.5. and giveth vs both the light of fayth, and all other supernaturall graces: Everie good gift, and everie perfect gift, is from Aboue; and commeth downe, from the Father of Lightes, Iam. 1.17. Levit. 20.8. I am the LORD, which sanctifieth you. 2. Our holinesse dependeth from Him, as from the object; for it standeth in loue of Him, and in conjunction with him. Holinesse is Puritie: and therefore, as impuritie aryseth from the touch of thinges vncleane, bodilie, or spirituall; so puritie from cleaving and adhering of the affection to thinges that are cleane. Now, of all such, the most pure is OOD: Hee is Light, and there is no darknesse in Him at all, 1. Iohn 1.5. Where Hee is not, nothing is cleane; vvhere Hee is, nothing vncleane. Therefore, Holinesse is called by saynct Peter, (Chap. 2. vers. 1.4.) a participation of the Divine nature. 3. Which followeth hence, our holinesse dependeth from Him, and His Holinesse as from the Rule. Hee hath none, to whom Hee should conforme

Himselfe: but, on the contrarie, His eternall Lawe, which is Himselfe, because nothing else, but the rectitude of His Divine Reason, is the Rule and Exemplar, to which all should bee conforme, that would bee holie, Levit. 11.44. Yee shall bee holie, for I am holie. And Chap. 19.2. And Chap. 20.7. 1. Pet. 1.16. 4. It dependeth from Him, as from the ende. All holinesse of the creature, is directed to the prayse of the glorie of His Grace, Ephes. 1.6. as to the ende. And therefore is everie one sanctified, that is holie; that he may cleaue to God, as to his last end: honour, prayse, and glorifie Him: For of Him, and through Him, and to Him, are all thinges: To whome bee glorie for ever, Amen. Rom. 11.36.
               Fourthlie: His Holinesse is altogether infinite. 1. Intensiuelie: for Hee loveth Himselfe,5. His Holinesse is infinite, intensiuelie, and extensiuelie. as much as Hee is louelie; and as great puritie is there in His loue, as in the perfection of His essence. Hee loveth the creature indeede, but for Himselfe: and therefore most holie in the loue of all; in the which He doeth not stay, or rest, but in the infinite excellencie of His owne goodnesse. 2. Extensiuelie
                        •
                     
                   that extendeth it selfe to infinite thinges; for all that Hee seeth in His essence, Hee loveth: all these please Him for Himselfe, and for His glorie. So His Holinesse is a perfection, infinitelie lifted vp aboue ours; superessentiall, and the infinite fulnesse of Holinesse. In regard of it, all holinesse in the creature, howe sublime soever, is as it were nothing; yea, and as it were impuritie; even as all power, wisdome, beautie, and excellencie, compared to His Power, Wisdome, &amp;c. is as nothing. Hence His solemne Style is THE HOLIE ONE, Esai. 1.4.10.20.17.7.29.19.30.11.12.31.1. &amp;c. Hence the Seraphims cry, Isai. 6. HOLIE, HOLIE, HOLIE; and the foure Beasts,

Nyssen. speaketh, be pleasant in His sight?

We shall lay this open to you, in some measure, in these foure degrees: The first, whether wee consider His workes done by Himselfe alone, or with vs, there is no blot to be found therin, Psal. 5.4. Thou art not a God that hast pleasure in wickednesse, neyther shall evill dwell with thee. Saynct Basil, in a Homilie of this subject, sayeth, that it is as great an impietie, to affirme GOD to bee the cause of evill, as to say with the foole, There is no GOD, PSAL. 14.1. They both deny GOD to bee good: For if Hee bee the cause of evill, sayeth hee, Hee is not good; and if not good, then not GOD. GOD and Good are not so neare in name, as in nature. Therefore, sayeth hee, in both these there is 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , a denyall of GOD. Hee is not the author of those thinges, whereof Hee is the revenger. To affirme the contrarie, is feralis opionio, a detestable tenet, sayeth Ambrose. It is a most horrible injurie agaynst GOD, sayeth Eusebius. Therefore Plato commanded, that none should bee permitted in the Common-wealth, young or olde, in sport, or earnest, to say, that GOD is the cause of evill. All that Hee made, was good, GEN. 1.31. And all that Hee maketh, is so. Hee neyther doeth evill, nor desireth it to bee done; neyther giveth Hee strength and concurrence for that ende; neyther anie way approveth Hee it when done-Habak. 1.12.13.

Such a good is the remedie of sinne, repentance the chastisementes of sinne, whether medicinall in this lyfe, or of meere revenge in the lyfe to come: the exercyse, and patience, and humiliation, of the Sayncts: the manifesting of mercie, in pardoning, or of justice in punishing. All these, and the lyke, which cannot be had without the interveaning of sinne, GOD desireth not of themselues, neyther seeketh Hee occasion of doing them, before sinne. Yea, of Himselfe Hee desireth that there were never occasion of anie such good, though sinne beeing supponed, Hee desire and intende them; for then they haue rationem

boni, and are desirable; and the execution of them may bee without sinne. Hence Hee is sayd, to will them not voluntate antecedente, but consequente; which taketh occasion of vs. Bee it farre, therefore, from vs to say with some, that Hee made our first Parentes, hoc consilio vt laberentur, of purpose that they might fall; because otherwayes, say they, Hee could not attayne to those principall endes; the manifesting of his mercie, in saving some; and justice, in punishing others: since Hee could not haue mercie, but on the miserable; nor justlie condemne anie, but sinners.

               Not onlie can Hee not will or doe evill; but also of necessitie Hee hateth it,Degree. and that with an infinite hatred.

For, 1. since necessarilie Hee loveth the rectitude of His aeternall Lawe,He hateth vnholines, and that infinitelie. of necessitie Hee must hate whatsoever is contrarie therevnto: and such is all sinne. 2. Hee necessarily loveth His goodnesse, and perfection of His nature: and therefore must needes hate sinne, which is repugnant, and contrarie therevnto; As darknesse to Light, and deformitie to Beautie, and crookednesse to Strayghtnesse, and defylment to Puritie. The infinitenesse of His hatred appeareth, first, From that Hee depryveth a sinner for it, of an infinite good; to wit, Himselfe. 2. To blot it out, Hee sent His owne Sonne; both to take our flesh, and to vndergoe death. 3. Hee for it inflicteth infinite sorrowes, and ignominie, even aeternall tormentes. And though one had innumerable good workes, yet for one grievous sinne, Hee forgetteth them all, EZECH. 18. For one sinne, Hee thrust downe from Heaven so manie millions of Angels: Hee cared not for their innumerable multitude, nor for their eximious beautie, nor for the excellencie of their nature, most nearlie resembling His; nor for their depth of engine, pearcing &amp; comprehending so many things; nor for that blessed sight which should for ever haue shyned in their mynds; or perfect loue, whereby they should haue loved Him aboue all thinges: nor for the prayse, thankesgiving, and glorie, which Hee should haue had for ever, through saving so manie spirites. Hee cared not for all the evill which Hee knewe could come by their condemnation; their aeternall blasphemies, and contumelies, the fall of man-kynde, and perverting of the whole worlde. So hatefull infinitelie to His Holinesse was sinne, that passing by all these considerations▪ Hee did stryke them immediatelie with the Thunder-bolt of Condemnation. The lyke terrible demonstration, of

His infinite hatred of sinne, may also bee seene in His dealing towardes man. Hence ISAI vj. in that mysticall vision, the SERAPHIMS provoke Him as it were, to punishment of that wicked people, by a threefolde compellation of His Holinesse. What man should not bee infinitelie punished by His Holinesse for sinne, if Hee were not restrayned by His infinite Mercie?
               Hence clearlie may appeare the errour of those vvho teach,5. Praedetermination to evill, refuted. That GOD by an absolute will, praedefyned and decreed from aeternitie, all actions, and positiue effectes of the creatures, howe wicked soever, so and so to bee done in particular, with all their circumstances: and, That accordinglie in tyme Hee moveth, pusheth, and physicallie praedeterminateth them to those effectes: This praevious motion beeing such, that without it no creature can doe anie thing: But it beeing present, they must needes doe that wherevnto it carrieth them. This doctrine at once destroyeth both the Libertie of men, and Sanctitie of GOD. The first; For that praemotion, or praedetermination, is independent from our libertie. It is not in our power, though it bee simplie necessarie to our actions, according to the authors thereof, when wee haue it not; therefore wee can not worke, some necessarie thing beeing deficient to vs, which GOD alone can giue. If it bee present, wee must needes doe that wherevnto it impelleth: and this necessitie is antecedent,

                        ncord. prasci. &amp; pradest. Cap. 1. which playnlie overthroweth Libertie, as Anselme observeth. 2. It destroyeth the Sanctitie of GOD: For if Hee so moue, push, and praedetermine, the will to evill, that it can not doe otherwayes, nor in another manner, howe can Hee bee more effectuallie, and powerfullie▪ the author of evill? Which is an horrible blasphemie. To advyse,

and command sinne, should not make Him so truelie and effectuallie the author thereof, as by this doctrine Hee is made, according to which Hee directlie willeth the evill act, and inwardlie moveth, applyeth, and praedetermineth the will, that it may bee done. Advyce and commandement moue onlie objectiuelie, and may bee resisted: but this Praedetermination pearceth the essence of the will, and inwardlie frameth it to worke, so that no way it can bee resisted, or the worke hindered.
               If you say,6. Evasions of the praedeterminants, refuted. that GOD is to bee esteemed in these actions, as a naturall and necessarie cause, and not free, it is false: For Hee doeth nothing ad extra, without Himselfe necessarilie, but altogether freelie: 2. If you say, that GOD willeth not that which is formall in sinne, this is not sufficient: For by the materiall of sinne, wherevnto they say GOD praedeterminateth, they vnderstand the actions, according to all the conditions, and circumstances, determining and making it individuall. Nowe, if GOD bee the cause of this, inwardlie moving, and praedeterminating our wills, to consent therevnto▪ Hee must needes also bee the cause of that, which is formall. Hence, first, God forbiddeth that in sin, which is materiall; as when He forbiddeth to commit adulterie, or steale. The sense is not, Beware heereof that when thou takest another man's goods agaynst his will, there bee in that action the privation of rectitude, or meralitas malitiae; for wee can not hinder this sequell of evill. But the meaning is, Take heede thou doe not this act, wherevnto evill is necessarilie joyned. If GOD forbid it, and deterre from it, can Hee effectuallie praedetermine mee therevnto, before all inclination of my will, and altogether independentlie from my libertie? 2. Man is no other wayes the cause of tha
                     •
                  
                  
which is formall in Theft, or the lyke sinne, but by producing the positiue entitie, and free act, of taking another man's goods. Hee willeth not the formall evill; yea, hee would that this action had beene without it; yet doeth hee properlie a morall evill, because evill necessarilie cleaveth vnto his action. 3. Admitting that Praedetermination, great and light temptations, should not differ by vehemencie of the object, or temptation of the Devill: But all the danger should be from this Divine praemotion, and impulse; which beeing present, wee should fall into the lightest; and beeing absent, should stand in the greatest assaultes. All this is so absurd, that even some of the Dominicans themselues, though they mayntayne Praedetermination in good actions; yet they denye it in evill;
                     Cumel.
                   as Franciscus Cumel, Disputat. ad primam partem, &amp; primam secundae Thomae, pag. 209.
               If it bee objected, That the same absurdities follow vpon the immediate concourse of GOD,7. The objection taken from Gods concurrence, answered. to the act of sinne, though there bee no praemotion or praedetermination: I answere, 1. That this praemotion is more absurd: For, 1. The praedeterminantes admit this immediate concurrence, and the moving, or impelling of the agent besides. 2. Praedetermination hath a necessarie and determinate connexion with the act of sinne; so that it can not bee joyned with the contrarie act: and GOD, they say, frameth the decree of it, of Himselfe, and without anie respect to our will. But the denyers thereof say, That GODS concurrence, though immediate, is generall, indifferent, and indeterminate; in so farre as the concurrence of GOD in actu primo; that is, GOD, vt paratus ad concurrendum quantum est ex se, &amp; ex munere causae primae, according to His place, is readie to cooperate to anie action of the creature, whether good,

or evill. This they meane by GOD'S indifferent concourse; and not that the action is onelie from GOD, secundùm rationem genericam,

So in a vitall act of vnderstanding or loue, though the vitalitie bee one with the entitie of the act; yet the vitalitie of the action followeth not the same cause that the entitie thereof doeth. For the act of vnderstanding is vitall, by reference to that onlie principle from which it inwardlie

                   than GOD: esteeming it onelie absurd, to admit an author alicujus rei, that is, of some substance, beside GOD. So hee playnlie sayeth, that the motion it selfe of the will whereby wee sinne, is not from GOD. Thou toldest mee (sayeth hee) also with a strong voyce, O LORD, in my inner eare, howe that it is thy selfe who made all these natures and substances, which are not what thy selfe is, and which yet haue their being: and howe, that onelie is not from thee which hath no beeing: no, nor the will that slydeth backe from thee, that art (eminentlie) vnto that which hath an inferiour beeing; because that all such back-slyding is transgression and sinne. This I haue insisted so much in, to show,

that there is no necessitie in this philosophicall argument, to make vs admit anie thing contrarie to true Divinitie, and praejudice of the Sanctitie of GOD. Leaving, therefore, more curiouslie to search in this manner of GOD'S working, I conclude this poynct with holie Augustine, speaking of this matter; this, to wit, that sinne is not from GOD, &amp;c. Thou hast manifested vnto mee, and, Lord, make it more and more manifest, and grant, that in this manifestation I may continue sober vnder thy winges.
               
               If yee vrge yet more, that even the power of sinning, given by GOD, and the permission of sinne seeme to derogate from His Holinesse, in His works; because, as the Ethnicke sayeth in Iustin. Martyr.
                  9. The argument from giving power to sin, &amp; the permission thereof▪ answered. 
                  Hee that may hinder, and permitteth, in effect doeth what hee permitteth. I answere, first, concerning the power of sinning; that if wee vnderstand thereby, a licence to doe evill, it is not from GOD; for this is an vnbrydled disorder of the will, importing in it, permission, impunitie, and a formall or virtuall approbation of him that giveth this libertie. Thus it is not from GOD, Ecclesiasticus 15.20. Hee hath commanded no man to doe wickedlie, neyther hath Hee given anie man licence to sinne. But if wee vnderstand by the power of sinning, a naturall power,
                     Vasq. in 1.2. disp. 129. cap. 10. that may bee exercysed well or evill; it can not bee denyed, that so taken, it is from GOD; and so,

                   with Augustine, the Schoole-men teach. Neyther is there anie blame in this; for if it were not, our libertie would not appeare. The free power of doing one thing, is joyned with the power circa oppositum in vs, as the Philosopher teacheth, and August. with him. When it is in our power to doe, it is also in our power not to doe, &amp;c. So Thomas there. Therefore this power of sinning, is not evill, but good, and hath a

good vse,
                     Tertull. 2. in Marcio. cap. 6. to wit, to make vs free. Hence Tertullian, Basil
                  ▪ and others, grant it, when having to doe with those that made GOD the author of sinne. I meane, not that the power of sinning,

                   This Anselme meaned, when in his Dialogue, de lib. arbit. cap. 1. hee sayde, that the power of sinning is neyther libertie, nor a part thereof: yet can it not bee denyed, that this power belongeth to mutable libertie. The act of sinning, is a free act. So the power whence it proceedeth, must bee actus primus, liber. 1. There can not bee a second act▪ without the first, proportionable. 2. If this were not true, the power of desisting from sinne, should not belong to Libertie: for the libertie of one contradictorie▪ includeth the libertie of the other. This indeede is a defect and imperfection; but so also is the mutabilitie of the will: and therefore the Divine Libertie excludeth this, as well as that. Secondlie, as for the permission of sinne, I answere, 1. GOD is not bound to hinder. 2. Hee hath most just and holie reasons, for which Hee permitteth the evill of sinne: for it is fit, that the Universall and Supreame Governour, having furnished all thinges perfectlie, and most sufficiently, for every good, should suffer them to be carried freelie, with their owne motions: Otherwayes, the helpe given, might seeme not sufficient; and the good worke done, forced, &amp; not worthie of prayse. Therfore Basil, having propounded the question, Why GOD did not take from vs the power of sinning?
                  
                     Basil.
                   answereth: As wee thinke not our servantes duetifull, when wee haue them bound, and in chaynes; but when they doe willinglie that which they ought. So hee is gracious

to GOD, not who doeth of necessitie, but of vertue; and vertue is of election, sayeth hee, and not of necessitie; and election is of that which is in our power; and that which is in our power, is free. 2. It becommeth men to waken vp themselues, to the doing of good, and avoyding of evill; and ever to bee sollicitous, and attentiue, that they bee not inlacking to the grace of GOD: but if GOD would permit no sinne, there should bee no neede of this solicitude. 3. Hee can drawe great good out of evill: as, first, The manifesting His goodnesse, and patience, suffering the contempt of His Majestie by sinne. 2. The manifesting of His Divine Mercie, pardoning it; wherevnto belongeth the Misterie of the Incarnation of the Sonne of GOD; and whatsoever Hee hath done and suffered for vs. All this is by occasion of sinne, whereby He hath manifested His Glorie farre more than if sinne had never beene. 3. The good of His Chosen Hee draweth even out of this evill. Thus the crueltie of Tyrants served to the encrease of glorie to the Martyres. Hence Vincentius the Martyr sayde to his torturer Dacianus; Nunquam quisquam adeo bene servivit mihi vt tu: Thou hast beene the best servant that ever I had. So the wickednesse of Heretickes serveth for the proving and clearing the fayth of the Church: Nunquid perfectè de Trinitate tractatum est, antequam oblatrarent Arriani? Nunquid de panitentia tractatū est, antequam obsisterent Novatiani? August. Psal. 54. Baptisme, sayeth hee there,
                     Aug. Psal. 54. 
                  was not so perfectlie handled before the contradiction of the Rebaptizers, or the vnitie of Christ and His Church, before the separation of Schismatickes. Thus GOD maketh sometymes a man's owne sinne, to bee occasion of amending his coldnesse, and presumption; and of greater care and humilitie in tymes coming.

Saynct Peter, and manie of the Sayncts, haue beene, by occasion of some fall, ever thereafter more warie, fervent, and humble. 4. This manifesteth the greatnesse of His Divine Majestie, which is such, that one sinne committed agaynst it, is worthie of aeternall death. 5. Hee manifesteth heereby His Divine Iustice, whyle Hee chastiseth one wicked man, by the wickednesse of another: as Hee did to His people Israell, by the Assyrians, ISAI. x.5. or whyle Hee permitteth one's sinne, for the punishment of another, in the sinner himselfe, ROM. 1. Thus sinne is called the punishment of sinne: not that it is properlie a punishment; for it is not intended by GOD the Punisher; but because the permission of it is a punishment willed by GOD for revenge; through which permission, by accident, another sinne falleth out. For when a man, by former sinnes, maketh himselfe vnworthie of the inspiration and protection of GOD, Hee withdraweth it from him; that is, Hee giveth him it not, as other wayes Hee would haue done; and so hee falleth into other sinnes, which, by the grace of GOD, hee would haue eschewed. Lastlie; The splendor of His justice shall appeare, when sinne shall bee revenged with aeternall punishment. So Hee draweth many folde good out of sinne. Allmightie GOD,

So neyther doeth His permission derogate from His Holinesse, nor yet from His Providence. Hee is not an ydle spectator of sinnes and sinners; but everie-where His Divine Providence over-ruleth them. Though they preasse to drawe themselues from His Disposition and Providence, yet can they

not: for whyle they withdraw themselues from the order of His Divine Direction, they fall into the order of His Chastisement: and whyle they withdrawe themselues from the bountie of His Mercie, they fall into the Severitie of His Iustice: and whyle they will not honour Him by well-doing, they are forced to honour Him by suffering evill:

               Let no man, therefore, blame GOD for his sinnes. His Holinesse is such, (as hath bene showne) that Hee can haue no hand in the procuring of sinne.10. Our evill is from our selues. IAM. j.13.14.15. Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of GOD: for GOD can not bee tempted with evill; neyther tempteth Hee anie man. But everie man is tempted, when hee is drawne away of his owne lust, and entysed. Then, when lust hath conceaved, it bringeth foorth sinne: and sinne, when it is finished, bringeth foorth death.

               All this worlde is as it were The Temple of His DEITIE, consecrated to His worship, sanctified by

His presence, and filled with his glorie, ISAI. vj.3.1. The whole worlde, an holy Temple. Everie-where as it were, wee may see Him present; and ever, as in His presence, should walke in it, as in an holie Temple, worshipping, praysing, and blessing Him; for in His Temple doeth everie one speake of His Glorie, PSAL. xxix.9. Even the senselesse creatures prayse and blesse Him; because, so much as in them lyeth, they excite to this duetie such as haue reason, by their representation of the Divine perfections. Heerein their goodnesse and chiefe vse standeth, and for it they were chiefelie made. Hence the creatures are called the Proclaymers and Witnesses of the DEITIE;

Hee is more especiallie sanctified vnto His Divine worship, and inhabitation, than al things bodilie; that converting himselfe within to his indweller, hee may converse with GOD, worship, and adore Him. Hee alone, and the Angelicall Spirites, may knowe and loue Him, which is true Holinesse, whereby Hee dwelleth in them, and they become His Temple; much more happie and sublime, than all this bodilie worlde, which is not sensible of His presence. This Knowledge and Loue vnite them vnto

Him, by a vitall band: thereby they are made partakers of His Divine Nature, 2. PET. 1.4. Yea, and thereby are changed in Him whome they knowe and loue, and become one Spirit with Him, 1. COR. 6.17. So in them is requyred a more speciall Holinesse.
               
               Hence, though Man receaved manie rich and costlie endewmentes from his Maker,3. Man's Holinesse in the creation. in the day of his creation; yet the jewell of greatest pryce and value, was Holinesse. The coloures wherewith GOD drew His Image and lykenesse in Man at the beginning, were not bodilie; but they were Puritie, immunitie from perturbations, blessednesse, and an estate free of all evill. With such Flowers did the Framer of His Image adorne our nature,

This Image (sayeth hee agayne) was not adorned with purple, nor did show foorth its dignitie by a Scepter, or Diademe: but in stead of purple, was cloathed with vertue, which is the most Royall Garment: and for a Scepter, had the blessednesse of Immortalitie: and in stead of a Royall Crowne, was adorned with the Crowne of Righteousnesse. By all other his perfections accompanying Essence, Lyfe, Sense, or Reason, hee was indeede lyke his patterne, more or lesse: all these did in some degree and measure resemble that which in his Maker was entire, perfect, and infinite: Yet the chiefest of all these compared to His Sanctitie, were but the foote-steppes of His DEITIE. This was the lyuelie Character of His Image, Ephes. iv.24. By this one hee was nearer GOD, than by them all. This was the Soveraygne Qualitie, vvherevnto all the rest did homage, and wherevpon the safetie of them all depended: whyle it was safe, all these were well; but beeing lost, they perished.

IESVS, GOD by Himselfe, and not by anie created gift, sanctifieth the humane nature; drawing it aboue all thinges created to Himselfe; and substantiallie vniting it, into the person of the Sonne of GOD: Therfore the Ancients say, that by the Deitie it selfe, the manhood of CHRIST is velut igne penetrata, &amp; vnguento delibuta, pearced by it, as it were, with fire; and anoynted by it, as with oyntment: so the Divine nature in this vnion, is as it were the ointment, &amp; the humane nature, that which is anointed. Whence also is the Name of CHRIST: CHRIST (sayth Nazianz.) became man, that Hee by Himselfe might sanctifie men, and might bee, as it were, leaven, to the whole lumpe;

Elias Cretenses wryting vpon this place of Nazianz. sayeth, that whereas others were sanctified by grace, in CHRIST the presence of the DEITIE it selfe was in stead of anoyn

                        Aug. serm. 157 &amp; 163. de tempore Chris. Hom. in Psal. 119.
                   Christians at Baptisme were cloathed with a whyte garment. The solide prayse of every Christian, is Holinesse. Hath anie Riches, Ioye, or Honour, and is not Holie? woe vnto him: hee hath receaved his consolation, Luke vj. 24.25. Hee shall mourne and weepe, and shall bee abased. Is anie learned, or eloquent, &amp; not holie? woe to him, though hee speake with the tongue of Men and Angels; though by the sublimitie of cōtemplation he should seeme to converse with the glorious Spirites; yet shall he be thrust downe, to the lowest Hells, to vtter Darknesse. On the contrarie; Is a man poore, base, vnlearned, rude, and everie way contemptible? Yet, if

                  Holie, blessed is hee: Blessed are the pure in heart; for they shall see GOD, Matth. v. Howe carefull then should wee be, to purge our selues from all vncleannesse of the flesh, and of the spirit? Howe carefull to eschewe all vncleannesse, in thoughtes, wordes, and actions? Otherwayes, our soules are hatefull to GOD, and become an abomination to that Holie One.
               Alace! Where is this HOLINESSE, that ought to bee,6. Our defect herein lamented. and that may bee so aboundantlie in vs? Wee doe not sanctifie the LORD of Hostes, neyther is Hee our Dread. Wee prophane His Holie and Reverende Name, His Holie Day, His Holie Word, Ezech. xxxiij.32. His Holie Sacrament, 1. Cor. xj.29. Yea, by our wicked and vncleane lyues, by our securitie, and obstinate impenitencie, wee, in a manner, count the Blood of the Covenant, wherewith we were sanctified, an vnholie thing, Hebr. x.29. Is it anie wonder then, that the Holie One of Israell is provoked to anger? Isai. j.4. Wee refuse to expresse His Holinesse in our conversations; and just therefore is it, that Hee manifest it in the deserved revenge of our wicked lyues. In that terrible vision, Isai. vj.2.3. the Seraphims cryed, Holie, Holie, Holie; agayne and agayne inculcating His Holinesse, to proclayme the equitie of His judgement, &amp; to provoke Him, as it were, to the inflicting of it vpon that sinfull people, loaden with iniquitie. No doubt they cry in like maner now, when they look vpon the great impietie and impuritie of this Land, though we heare them not. We feele in part the effect of GOD'S Holinesse this way. We are almost consumed, and yet wee haue neyther had Sword, nor Famine, nor Pestilence. Through the anger of the Holie One of Israell, the whole earth is darkened, and the people is as the fewell of the fire: no man spare

                     h his brother, ISAI. ix.19. Everie one eateth the

flesh of his owne arme, ISAI. ix.20. Wee spreade foorth our handes, and Hee hydeth His Eyes: Wee make manie prayers, but Hee will not heare, Isai. j.15. For all this, His anger is not turned away; but His Hand is stretched out still; because our prophane hands are full of wickednesse. If Hee bee so terrible to vs nowe, howe dreadfull shall Hee bee heereafter, when we shall stand before Him, at death, or at judgement? ISAIAH was an holie man, when that vision was presented vnto him, Isai. 6. yet howe astonished was hee at the sight of the LORD? Woe is mee, for I am thee vndone, &amp;c. How terrible then shal the presence of God thy Iudge be to thee, who hast not heere or there a spot of sin; but hast filthines incorporat in thy soule? Revel. vj.16. They sayde to the mountaynes, and to the rockes, Fall on vs, and hyde vs from the face of Him that sitteth on the Throne. Goe, then, such as are vncleane, and vnholie; wash you, and make you cleane: Goe to that pure Fountayne, which the HOLIEST of HOLIES hath opened out of His owne side, Zach. xiij.1. and say with DAVID, PSAL. lj. Wash mee throughlie from my iniquitie.

Fellow-workers with GOD, and His Instrumentes, in sanctifying, and saving of men. Therefore this HOLINESSE TO THE LORD, was engraven in the head, and fore-head of the high Priest; to signifie, that though the duetie bee common to all, yet chieflie belonged to him; and, that hee, by his example, should leade all others, both Priestes, and People, in the studie of Holinesse. Exceeding great Holinesse is requyred in the high Priest, whether wee consider him in reference to GOD, or Man. Priesthood, sayeth Chrysostome in his excellent Bookes De Sacerdotio, Lib. 3. is performed on earth; but yet it is to bee counted in the ranke of heavenlie thinges. And therefore a Priest must bee so pure, as if in Heaven it selfe hee were walking, amongst heavenlie powers. Terrible were those thinges which praeceeded the tyme of Grace, as Bells, Pomgranats, precious Stones, the Mitre, the plate of Golde, the Holiest of Holies, &amp;c. Yet, sayth hee, if wee compare them with the things that are vnder the tyme of Grace, we will finde them to bee verie light, and that true which saynct PAVL sayeth, 2. COR. 3. For whyle thou beholdest the LORD sacrificed, the Priest performing that Sacrifice, and powring ou

                      Prayers, and the people dyed, as it were, and made red, with that precious Blood, thinkest thou that thou art yet amongst mortall men, and on the earth? Art thou not rather translated to Heaven? and doest thou not, laying aside all carnall cogitation, beholde with a free and pure mynde, the thinges that are in Heaven? And Lib. 6. hee sayeth to the same purpose, when the Priest performeth this most sublime part of Christian Service in the EVCHARIST; I demand (sayeth hee) where shall wee ranke him? What integritie should wee require of him? What religion? How innocent should those hands

wordes? What thinge should bee so pure and cleane, as the soule, that receaveth so great and so worthie a Spirit? At that tyme, sayeth hee, the Angels stand beside, and the whole order of the heavenlie Powers doe shout. What is requyred of him, sayeth NAZIANZ▪

                  A man should greatly purge his mynde, and approach beyond others, to GOD, before hee take care of Souls, and to mediate betwixt GOD and Man; which is the duetie of a Priest, before hee presume to offer that great Sacrifice. This is the summe, sayeth NAZIANZ. then, Tbat Priests bee such in vettue, as that to speake it in a word, they bee heavenlie: that they themselues bee first purged, then purge others: first endewed themselues with wisdome, and then make others wyse: first bee themselues a light, &amp; then enlighten others: first come to GOD themselues, and then bring others to Him. A Ruler, sayeth GREGORIE, should greatlie labour to bee cleane:
                  
                     Greg. lib. 1. Ep. c. 24.

It is written, sayeth hee there, ISAI. lij. Mundamiui qui fertis Vasa DOMINI: Be ye cleane, that beare the Vessels of the LORD, VERS. 11. This they doe, who beare the Soules of their Brethren to the inward Sacrifices; In conversationis suae exemplo; in the example of their owne conversation. Howe cleane, then,

Therefore, whereas all Christians should bee, and are called Sancti, HOLIE; Christian Bishops should bee, and haue beene styled Sanctissimi, MOST HOLIE. It was the Sanctitie of the Priestlie Office, and conversation, that procured to those of that place of olde so great veneration,

               Before wee ende, let vs descende to a more particular application,Transition to the praise of the Bishop of Aberdene. and shortlie consider, howe this our REVEREND and WORTHIE PRELATE, of Blessed Memorie, did acquite himselfe in those Dueties; so shall wee, according to our promise, conjoine to the consideration,

The harvest, and reaping, as it were, of his prayse, was the day of his Funeralls; and therefore none prevented it, left hee should haue seemed to haue thrust his sickle into the field of another: But, after reaping, it is lawfull to gleane. Neyther neede yee feare this travell shall be vnprofitable; for the fielde is rich. Beside Glorie, is a frequent Celebration by manie;

Wee are debters, I say, not to him alone, but to GOD also,

Come, therefere, and let vs shortlie view the Crowne of his excellent Perfectiōs, which haue bene so steadable to this whole CHVRCH, to this whole Land, and to you especiallie. I aime not at a just pourtraict of his worth: that exceedeth my strength: yea, I doubt not,

                   but the most sufficient will bee contented with the excellent Paynters of olde, to drawe vnder their labours of this kynde, titulum pendentem, as Plinie speaketh; and to say they are but doing, and had not yet done. It shall content our weaknesse, to giue some small and rude delineation: Even GOD accepteth of that which wee are able to doe.
               
               The first Iewell of his Crowne that I present vnto your view, is his Iudgement;2 His judgement. which was in him most rare: it was readie; pearcing, stayed, and happie. None could more readilie conceaue, deeplie dyue, or more resolutelie and solidlie conclude.
               Two rare Ornamentes beautified it: The first,3 Learning. Singular Learning
                  ▪ in holie Scripture; which from his youth hee sought, and so followed after, that hee did happilie wade in the deepest mysteries of that high and sublime Apostle saynct Iohn, surnamed, by way of excellencie The Divine; as appeareth by his learned Commentarie vpon his Revelation.
               
               
                  The second was Prudence, wherein hee excelled not others onelie,4 Prudence. but also himselfe. This made him even in youth famous, at home, &amp; abroad: &amp; for it the wysest king that Europe had did take particular notice of him. By the same, when advanced to Ecclesiastical and saecular praeferment, hee governed the difficile and turbulent state of this CHVRCH; wherein he did encounter with so manie distempered judgementes, perverse and vnrulie humoures, in peace and quyetnesse,

                   those seavēhteene yeares, with wonderful dexteritie. By this hee as Honorarius arbiter, according to the practise of most holie and ancient Bishops, setled the Variances of Lay-men, having recourse to his wisdome, as to an Oracle. Variances, (I say) which if not composed by him,
                     Sidonius Apoll. l. 6 ep. 2. might haue broken out into the same dolefull effectes, which the lyke Dissentions haue brought to other partes of the Countrey. By the same was hee most steadable to the whole Estate, whether hee sate in Parliament, or Counsell: and for it honoured and admired, by the wysest of the Kingdome. A most necessarie Vertue this was for his place. A Priest, sayeth Chrysostome, should bee various: that is, sayeth hee, not subdolous, flattering, or dissembling: but one that can accommodate and applye himselfe according to the matter in hand; and, that can both bee benigne, and severe. Hee knewe by it how to accommodate himselfe to tymes, places, persons, and occasions: so walking with a strayght foote, that in the meane tyme he remembered, that he lived not in Republica Platonis, but in face Romuli; not in Plato's Common-wealth, but in the midst of a perverse Generation: which saying hee had often in his mouth; and for not observing whereof, hee sayd Cato was justlie censured by Cicero.
               
               
                  Another rare Gemme of this Crowne, was his Eloquence. His expression was graue and majesticke,5 Eloquence powerfull, copious, and playne; having in it a singular and sweete insinuation and grace; his face and eyes, (as yee knowe) shyning: so that by his speach, thinges were presented rather to the sight, than convoyed to the eare. So great was his dexteritie in this, that if hee did reade the holie Scripture, hee did so sensiblie and powerfullie convoy it to the mynde, that I haue thought often, one might haue profite more by his reading, than by reading the Commentaries of manie.
               To these great Perfections,
                  
                     6 His magnanimitie.

                   was joyned that Ornament of all Vertues, (as the Philosopher calleth it) Magnanimitie: so justlie may I call the generous, cowragious, and constant disposition of his mynde. The Philosopher telleth vs, That the magnanimous man is exercysed in great matters; and yet so great hee is, that none of these is great to him. Such a depth and weyght hee hath of excellent Vertues, as maketh him also stayed and setled in everie thing: vvhence hee is neyther moved with allurement of Honour, nor shaken with feare of Danger, nor easilie taken vp with Admiration. Yea, in his verie wordes &amp; gesture, he is graue, and stayed: and finallie, is guided by Trueth, and not by Opinion. This worthie Prelate was such a one. He had a Greatnesse &amp; Weyght more excellent than the Philosopher could dreame of: For beside his Naturall and Morall Perfection, which in this kynde was excellent, hee had that weyght of Divine Grace, which establisheth and imboldeneth the heart. GOD, the Rocke of Ages, dwelt in his Soule; to whome hee was most strictlie vnited, by firme confidence. Hence was hee most graue and stayed, in all his wordes, deedes, and behaviour.

This made him, that hee chased not Honour, as manie doe, nor turned his backe to Terrours, His face was as Adamant
                  ▪ when hee was to stryue for good against the perverse▪ and no crosse could make his heart to breake, (as hee vsed to say.) Popular opinion, and applause, hee contemned, condemning it exceedinglie in those that are affected with it; and recommending nothing more to others, than the contempt thereof. In a word; Hee was employed in great thinges, and was encountered with great crosses; and yet hee was still greater than his fortunes, (so to speake) whether good, or evill. Thus truelie was hee Magnanimous.
               
               But what of all this rich and precious Crowne, which was made vp of so rare Iewels,7. His Holinesse, in advāceing Gods glorie. if wee finde not engraven in it, HOLINESSE TO THE LORD? This is the chiefe, and the lyfe of all the rest: and this in him was not wanting; yea, so distinctly engraven, that thou mightest runne and reade. All these Perfections hee made to serue, both publicklie, and privatelie, to the glorie of GOD, who gaue them. Though it would haue seemed, that he would haue passed his lyfe as a Lay-man, yet GOD had sanctified him for Himselfe. His WORD and SPIRIT within him, was a FYRE, which would needes burst out. Therefore, called to the holie Ministerie, hee obeyed, and followed; and did holilie acquyte himselfe therein. Beeing yet higher advanced to a more sublime Charge, all his endevour was to halowe the Holie and Reverende NAME of GOD. So he did by his holie and devout Preaching, whyle health served: so did hee by his holie care of the estate of this CHVRCH; for which, both for the present tyme, and for the tyme to come, hee excellentlie provyded.
               
                  No sooner had hee vnder-taken this Charge, but hee began with the Seminaries of Learning;8. In adv
                        •••
                     
                     ment of learning. from which the weale of the CHVRCH, in all ages, moste dependeth. This hee did seriouslie, remembering it was layde vpon him particularlie, As hee would answere to GOD in the GREAT DAY. And so happie was his care in this, that what hee found lateritia, and almost ruinated, hee left marmorea; repared in the Aedifices, restored in the Bibliotheke, revived in the Professions of DIVINITIE, PHYSICK, CANON LAW: wherevnto hee procured the adding of another Profession of DIVINITIE, to the great benefit of the CHVRCH, in all following tymes; restoring also the decayed Honoures due to Learning. To what purpose had the Worthie and Heroicke Founders of that UNIVERSITIE left it, if it had fallen? And fallen appearantlie it should haue, if by him not vnder-propped. This duelie considered, that UNIVERSITIE may bee justlie called ANASTASIA, as was that Temple of Nazianzen in Constantinople: for hee hath raysed vp in it good Letters, almost fallen to the ground. Was not this HOLINESSE?
               
               The lyke care had hee to plant good and worthie Pastors, for the present tyme:9. In his care of planting Churches. and such was the successe of his care, that never anie of the Worthie Prelates that went before him, had such a Learned Clergie. Yea, whyle this Diocesse enjoyed him, and that other Worthie Prelate of blessed memorie, for singular Pietie, and excellent Learning, Incomparable, (I meane, the late Bishop of Edinburgh, not long since your Worthie Pastor) it needed not to haue envyed anie parte of this KINGDOME. None had more sagacitie to discerne good spirites, or care

to promoue them. They might haue sayde, whyle hee lived, with the Poet, of him,

                  10. His integritie. Plin. in praesat
                     ▪
                  In all this publicke Administration, such was his integritie, that to him belonged, that, as Plinie calleth it, Nobilis suspiratio Ciceronis of Cato; O te felicem à quo nemo rem improbam petere audet. None durst attempt to corrupt him. All which beeing duelie weyghed, I am not afrayde to say, Hee might haue beene a States-man, in the best State of EVROPE, and a Prelate, in the best tymes of the CHVRCH. That which Plinie saieth of Cato, That hee was thought to haue conjoyned in himselfe, the three greatest thinges, Optimus Orator, Optimus Senator, Optimus Imperator, might bee not vnfitlie applyed vnto him, if yee will put a Prelate, for a Commander.
               
               In his private lyfe and conversation, hee was Holie:
                  11. His Holinesse inprivate life &amp; death. none more familiar with GOD. The sweete Fruites whereof, as he felt al his lyfe, in manie sharpe Conflictes and Crosses, which hee encountered with, so especiallie before his death: For GOD continued with him, contrarie to the nature of his disease, his Iudgement, and Prudence, which was the Crowne of his Gray Hayres; and his Tongue, which was his Glorie: and, which was most of all, his Holinesse. So that his Disease, though heavie, was but 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , the proofe of his Vertue;
                     Naz. ep. 41. hee beeing more blessed in this, than others were in health. It abated nothing of his care of the Glorie of GOD, and well-fare of His CHVRCH: hee traveled no lesse paynfullie nowe,

than before, by his Prayers, sound Advyce, frequent, wyse, and powerfull Letters. Amongst others, yee had a singular proofe of his Religious Care a little before his death; when your sute was, to haue for your Pastor, his Worthie, Devout, and Learned Sonne, ye knowe howe willinglie hee condescended to his Transplantation; notwithstanding hee was the Manager of his estate at that tyme; and, vnder GOD, the Stay of his olde age, and the Solace of his solitarinesse, and sicknesse: vvhence he professed that for his stay, hee would haue tripled, what was to bee obtayned by his remouall, if it had beene lawfull to looke in that matter to wordlie respectes. A great argument this was, that hee disesteemed both Estate, Health, and private Contentment, in respect of GODS GLORIE, &amp; your Weale: vvhich, knowing himselfe readie now to departe, hee thought hee could no better promoue, than by leaving you in stead of himselfe, the best Expression hee had of himselfe; that yee beholding his Vertues in him, as in a cleare and bright glasse,

                  might in effect haue him even after his departure, as Nazianzen speaketh of Nyssen, in reference to his brother S. Basil-God also gaue him, as an earnest desire to bee dissolved; so an vndaunted cowrage agaynst the feare of Death. Some few dayes before his departure, having most devoutlie taken the holie SACRAMENT, vvith vs his Presbyters, and having most affectiōatelie blessed vs, he said most devoutly, (teares bursting out for joy) with SIMEON, LORD, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace, &amp;c. And setling himselfe in his former calmnesse, &amp; tranquillitie, did expect joyfullie his LORD: teaching men

of righteousnesse,

               Therefore, I make no doubt, but that gracious GOD,12. The conclusion. who gaue him the Crowne of so manie excellent Graces, and the Crowne of Priesthood, wherin His owne finger did engraue Holinesse, hath nowe given him the Crowne of Glorie. Let, therefore, his memorie bee blessed vpon earth, as his Soule is blessed in Heaven: and yee who were his people, and whose Pastor hee was, remember to followe him, as hee did CHRIST. This was, and is, his most earnest desire: So shall yee your selues bee crowned with him, and shall bee his Crowne, in that Great Day, 1. Thess. ij.19. For what is our hope, or joye, or crowne of rejoycing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord IESVS CHRIST at His comming?

            A CONSOLATORIE SERMON, Preached vpon the death of the R. R. Father in GOD, PATRICKE FORBES, Late BISHOP of ABERDENE;
            By ALEXANDER ROSSE, Doctor of DIVINITIE, and MINISTER of the EVANGELL in ABERDENE, in Saynct NICOLAS Church there, Anno 1635. the xv of Aprill.

                  And manie of them that sleepe in the dust of the earth, shall awake: some to ever-lasting lyfe, and some to shame, and ever-lasting contempt.
               
            
            
               IT may, perhaps, seeme strange, that the noyse of my mourning, for the death of our late Worthie Prelate, was not these dayes by-past, with the rest of my Reverend Colleagues, heard in publicke. This duetie had beene performed ere nowe, were not Death (fearing that my vnappeased griefe, through sense of my

great losse, should haue made mee to burst out into bitter and T
                  •
               agicke Invectiues agaynst her; and so haue brought you all in hatred with her, as with that vvhich the Philosopher saieth is omnium terribilium, terribilissimum; Of all thinges that are terrible, the most terrible) did arrest mee, by her mightie Herauld Sicknesse: to the end, that by neare communing with her, I might knowe, and impart the same vnto you also; that shee is not so indeede, as her grieslie lookes doe praetende: not an enemie to the Godlie, as nowe in our mourning shee is holden to be, but a friende: and herefore, in your mourning, you should bee comforted. For by the death of CHRIST, her nature is changed: Through death Hee hath destroyed him that had the power of death; that is, the Devill: and delivered them who through the feare of death, were all their lyfe tyme subject vnto bondage, Hebr. ij.14.15. Death is no more death. I am (sayeth our Saviour) the Resurrection, and the Lyfe: hee that believeth in Me, though hee were dead, yee shall hee liue. And whosoever liveth, and believeth in Mee, shall never die, IOHN xj.25.26. By her the Godlie are bound in the bundle of Lyfe. Shee is but the way that all flesh doeth goe; to put an ende to their miseries: Shee looseth them out of Prison, gathereth them to their Fathers, maketh them lay downe their tabernacle, and putteth them into a sound sleepe, from whence they shall bee awakened to ever-lasting Lyfe.
            
            But because it were endlesse, to showe you all the good we nowe obtayn by Death, I haue bounded my selfe within the limites of this Text, wherin we haue a sweete Cordiall, for the reliefe of the heart of Man, from two great evils; to wit, The ignorance of the nature of Death it selfe, and the ectate of men after death. Feare not to taste therof; for it is praescrybed by the

Greatest DOCTOR in Heaven, or in earth, GOD Himselfe, the Soveraygne, and onlie Physician, both of Soule and bodie. The Apothecarie by whose hand it was delivered, was an Angell, who gaue it for a strong Consolation vnto Daniel; and hee who hath left it vnto vs for that same vse, was this same Daniel, Vir desideriorum, A man greatlie beloved of GOD; A Pen-man of holie Scripture; who spake and writ as hee was inspired by the holie Ghost: And it is of an immortall and never-fading Vertue, flowing from the immortall, and all-sufficient Worth and Merit of the death and Resurrection of IESVS CHRIST.
            
            That Death, by the ignorance of the true nature thereof, doe not dismay you, learne to knowe, That it is but a sleepe. That the estate after death doe not dishearten you, learne, that it is but a wakening: and such a one, as is to Lyfe; and such a lyfe, as shall haue no death: an ever-lasting Lyfe; a sweete Cordiall indeede: but the comfort contayned in it, doeth not indifferentlie concerne all. All indeede shall sleepe, all shall awake; but not all to ever-lasting Lyfe. The awakening of some, shall bee to shame, and contempt; for Qualis vita, finis ita: Lyke lyfe, lyke ende, lyke awakening: Who liveth in the LORD, shall die in the LORD; rest from their laboures, and awake to ever-lasting Lyfe. And who liveth in sinne, their ende is destruction, and their awakening is to shame. For this Text hath its own both Extent, &amp; Restraynt. Extent, all indeede shall sleepe, all shall awake. Restraynt, Some to ever-lasting Lyfe, some to shame, and contempt.
            
            There bee some, I knowe, doe not allow to it this just Extent; in regard it is sayde onlie manie that sleepe in the dust. For they thinke, that all men shall not suffer death, which by sleepe is meant heere. Grounding themselues vpon the wordes of the Apostle, 1. COR.

xv.51. Beholde, I showe you a mysterie: Wee shall not all sleepe, but wee shall all bee changed. Hee distinguisheth all men vnto those who shall bee alyue, and remayne vnto the comming of the LORD, and those that shal be asleepe. Which distinction importeth, That those who then shall bee alyue, shall not die, but shall immediatelie, or without anie death intenveaning, bee caught vp, with the rest of the Elect, to meete the LORD in the ayre.
            Tyme will not serue mee, to speake of this mysterie, as Paull calleth it, at such length as I would: onlie yee shall know, that the ancient Fathers of the Church haue bene much divided in their judgemēts, concerning those whom the LORD at His comming to Iudgement shall finde alyue. Chrysostome wryting vpon that place, and diverse Greek Fathers following him, haue thought, that they shall not die; but that they shall bee changed, from the estate of Mortalitie, vnto the estate of Aeternitie. Of this opinion also were some of the Latine Fathers; in speciall Tertullian and Ierome; and diverse moderne Wryters, both Papistes, as Cajetane, and some others, led by his authoritie; as also Protestantes, as Calvine, and some others, following him.
            But manie haue beene, and are yet, of another opinion: that is, they haue believed, or at least thought it more probable, That even those who shall bee alyue at the LORD His second comming, shall truelie and reallie die; that they may vndergoe the common punishment of Man-kynde; and shall immediatelie thereafter bee raysed vp, or quickened, that they may compeare with the rest vnto Iudgement. Of this opinion were diverse, both of the Greeke Fathers, as Dydimus, one of the Doctors of Alexandria, and Acacius, Bishop of Caesarea, (as we

may perceaue by Ierome his Epistle to Minerius, and Alexander, EPIST. 152. vvhere the judgement of them both in this particular is related) and Oecumenius in his Commentaries expounding this place: and also of the Latine Fathers, as the Author of the Commentaries vpon Paul's Epistles, attributed to Ambrose, in Thes. Cap. 4. Augustine, in some places of his workes, as Lib. 20. De Civitate DEI, Cap. 20. although in other places hee seeme to encline to the former opinion, as Quaest. 3. ad Dulcetium. (For he was ever doubtfull of this matter, even when he writ his worke of Retractions, Lib. 2. Retract. Cap. 33.) I could also for this opinion, cite diverse of the Ancientes, who will haue the wordes read, Wee shall all sleepe, but wee shall not all bee changed.
            
            But besides these two readinges of this place, (which both were to bee found in the Greeke Editions of that age, as Ierome witnesseth in the ende of that Epistle before cited) hee lykewyse telleth vs, that there was a third most frequent in the Latine Editions; but not at all to bee found in the Greeke Copies: to wit, Wee shall all ryse, but wee shall not all bee changed. Which reading occurreth frequentlie in Augustine's workes: and Ruffinus, before him, followed it, in the exposition of the Creede, expounding the article of the Resurrection.
            
            I will not take vpon mee, to define, or determine peremptorilie, this question: For I thinke with Lombardus, Lib. 4. Sent. Dist. 43. that horum quid verius sit, non est humani judicii definire: vvhich of these are most agreeable to the trueth, it is not for humane wit to determine. Nor yet will I take holde of that other reading of the Apostle's speach, Wee shall all sleepe, but wee shall not all bee changed; although Acacius affirme, That it was in plurimis Graecorum codicibus,
               
to bee found in manie Greeke Copies, as Ierome relateth of him: I will only declare two thinges vnto you, concerning the Extent of my Text, or the vniversalitie of Death, and Resurrection.
            
            The first is; That from this speach of the Apostle, even taking it according to the ordinarie reading of it, as it is now in the Greeke Copies, nothing can bee infalliblie concluded, to proue, that those whom the LORD shall find vpon the earth at His second comming, shall not taste of Death; properlie and truelie so called. For whereas the Apostle sayeth, Wee shall all sleepe, it may bee verie probablie alleadged, That by sleeping, hee vnderstandeth not Death it selfe; but the continuance of Death: or, to vse Oecumen. his phrase, that the Apostle is speaking 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , of a long death, or of a death continued for so long tyme, that the dead bodies may bee altered, and dissolved into dust. This may, out of all question, bee, That they who then shall bee living, shall not sleepe: for although they die, yet their death shall not bee as a sleepe, but rather a sudden slumber; a winke, or nod, of one that would sleepe.
            Never-the-lesse, seeing manie Interpreters, both ancient and moderne, doe expound that speach of Saynct Paull otherwayes; thinking, that hee is there speaking of Death it selfe; and, consequentlie, that his speach importeth, That some men, and in speciall those who shall bee living at the day of Iudgement, shall not vnder-goe, or suffer, Death. Therefore my second Assertion is, That the vniversalitie of Death &amp; Resurrection, is to bee vnderstoode, with an exemption of those whom GOD Himselfe, for some speciall or extraordinarie causes or respectes, hath exeemed from them. This Peter Martyr observeth, speaking of Henoch and Elias, who for extraordinarie

respectes were exeemed by GOD from Death; And such, sayeth hee, will bee the condition of those whom GOD shall find alyue when Hee commeth to judgement. Yet albeit of this extraordinarie exemption, it is the ordinarie course of all Man-kynde, to die, according to that of HEBR. ix.27. It is appoynted for men, once to die.
            
            The Iewes, although they allow this just Extent of this Text, in this, That all shall die, yet they denye, that all shall awake:
               
                  R. D. 
                        •
                     imhi, on this place. grounding themselues on the wordes PSAL. j.5. Therefore the vngodlie shall not ryse in Iudgement. But for answere to them, first, The reading of this place is wrong: for the wordes are to bee read thus, The vngodlie shall not stand in Iudgement. Secondlie, the Text it selfe here refuteth them; for it sayeth, That some, meaning the wicked, shall awake, to shame, and contempt. And our Saviour, IOHN v. 28.29. The houre is comming, when all that are in the graues, shall heare his voyce, and shall come foorth; they that haue done good, vnto the Resurrection of Lyfe; and they that haue done evill, vnto the resurrection of damnation.
            
            That the Extent, then, may bee full, the word manie must bee eyther taken distributiuelie, referring it to both members, Manie shall awake to lyfe, and many to shame; so that multi, is as much as multitudines duae; one companie to Lyfe, another to shame: or the word is to bee taken collectiuelie; not exclusiuelie, but extensiuelie, and vniversallie, as ROM. v.18. By the offence of one man, the fault came vpon all vnto condemnation. And in the next verse following, Manie were made sinners. Whereby it is evident, that manie is taken for all.
            
            The Restraynt is, That some onlie shall awake to everlasting Lyfe, and some to shame, and contempt. Of this

last part, I will speake nothing at this tyme; but (as Daniel sayde in his exposition of Nebuchadnezar's dreame) let it bee to them who by finall impenitencie hate the LORD, and the interpretation onelie to his enemies: Wee haue onlie here to speake of this Text, so farre as it concerneth the Godlie. Their death is called a sleepe; and their estate after death, awakening to ever-lasting lyfe.
            
            
               Death in Scripture vsuallie is so tearmed, Deuter. xxxj.16. the LORD speaking to Moses of his death, sayeth, Beholde, thou shalt sleepe with thy fathers. And our Saviour, Matth. ix.24. The mayd is not dead, but sleepeth. And Iohn xj.11. Our friend Lazarus sleepeth: but I goe, that I may awake him out of sleepe. And the Apostle, 1. Thess. iv.13.14. I would not haue you ignorant, brethren, concerning them that are asleepe; that you sorrow not, even as others, which haue no hope. For if wee belieue that IESVS died, and rose agayne: so them also which sleepe in IESVS, will GOD bring with Him.
            
            This sleepe, doe not thinke that it is of the soule, as some fondlie dreamed, that the soules seperated from the bodies, were casten into a dead sleepe, and remaine without all action, vntill the generall Resurrection: or, that that they doe rest a space in the dust, with the bodies. Alace! these men are truelie injurious, to the soules of the Godlie departed, that would eyther denye them all fruition of GOD, or all action, whyle they are seperated from the bodie. I affirme not, that their happinesse is such, or at such an hight, as it shall bee, when the tyme commeth, of which Peter speaketh, 1. PET. v.4. that is, When the chiefe Shepheard shall appeare, and they shall receaue a Crowne of Glorie, that fadeth not away. But that they enjoye GOD, and even separated from the bodies, they laude and prayse Him, is evident in that

vision, Rev. v. 11.12. where Iohn sayeth, hee behelde, and heard the voyce of manie Angels round about the Throne, and the Beasts, and the Elders: and the number of them was ten thousand tyms ten thousand, and thousandes of thousandes, saying with a loude voyce, Worthie is the Lambe that was slayne, to receaue power, and riches, and wisdome, and strength, and honour, and glorie, &amp;c. And as th'Apostle witnesseth, 2. Cor. v.8. being absent from the bodie, they are present with the LORD. And Phil. j.23. his desire was to depart, and to bee with CHRIST. And expresslie Augustine sayeth, Lib. 13. de Civitate Dei, Cap. 8. In requie enim sunt animae piorum à corpore separatae; impiorum autem poenas luunt, donec istarum ad aeternam vitam, illarum ad aeternam mortem, quae secunda dicitur corpora reviviscant. The soules of the Godlie (sayeth hee) being separated from the bodie, are at rest, and the souls of the wicked are punished, vntill that tyme the bodies of the one bee awakened to aeternall lyfe, and the bodies of the other to aeternall death; which is called The second death.
            
            The bodies then onlie of the Godlie doe sleepe in the dust of the earth. The souls of men may haue, and haue their▪ owne actions, without commerce with the bodies: For in that the death of man is called a sleepe, it evidentlie signifieth, That the soules of men are not as the souls of other creatures, who lose beeing with their bodies; their death being no other than a destruction of both. But as when the bodie sleepeth, the soule will bee then thinking, meditating, and discoursing; so when the bodie is lying asleepe in the graue, the soule then is exercysing its owne heavenlie and spirituall functions.
            That nowe, then, wee may knowe the nature of the death of the Godlie, we haue to learne wherefore speciallie it is resembled to sleepe. This appellation it

getteth in Scripture, is to testifie, what good, what happinesse, the Godlie gayne by Death. And, to omit manie other resemblances betwixt them, I will show it in this: Even as a man all the day long wearied with toyle, and travell, when the night commeth, laying aside all traffique of the world, hee vncloatheth himselfe, goeth to bed, willingly yeelding to Nature; where the senses beeing tyed vp by sleepe, hee resteth from all his travels, and sense of evill: by which rest, hee is more enabled agaynst his awakening, for better exercyses, as the Poët sayth of it;

                  Pectora duris,
                  Fessa ministeriis mulces, reparas
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      labori.
               
So the Godlie, when the night of death commeth, or when death approacheth, they lay aside all worldlie thinges, and prepare themselues for it: with Ezekiah they set their house in order; knowing, that they must die: they yeeld to the God of Nature, saying vnto them, Returne, yee children of men, Psal. xc.3. They vncloathe their souls, and put off their earthlie tabernacle. Then their bodies are layde downe in the dust, as in a sweete sleeping bed: and, as Iob sayeth, as the waters fayle frrom the sea, and the flood decayeth, and dryeth vp; So man lyeth downe, and ryseth not: till the Heavens bee no more, they shall not awake, nor bee raysed out of their sleepe, Iob xiv.11.12. Where they are delivered from all cares, all toyle, and sense of evill, wherevnto before they were subject: and therin they are fitted, and prepared, for all Happinesse.
            
            By this resemblance, we may perceaue, first, that the death of the Godlie, putteth an ende to all miseries: For by it wee are delivered both à malo culpae, and à malo poenae, from sinne it selfe, and from the punishment of sinne. After death, the Godlie doe not sinne anie more. Howe great Happinesse this is, may bee easilie

vnderstood by that groaning petition vttered by the Apostle, Rom. vij.24. O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver mee from the bodie of this death? By death they are delivered from it; for he that is dead, is fred frō sin, Rom. 6.7. &amp; delivered frō the bondage of corruption, into the glorious libertie of the sonnes of GOD, Rom. viij.

               1. Yea, from all occasions and temptations to sinne. Desiit peccare, desiit jactari, desiit miser esse: He ceasseth to sinne, or to bee tossed with anie winde of temptation to sinne. In a word; Hee ceasseth to bee miserable: and therefore I sayde also, that hee is fred à malo poenae. In this lyfe man that is borne of a woman, is of few dayes, and full of trouble, Iob xiv.1. And Salomon acknowledgeth, That there is nothing vnder the sunne, but trouble, and vexation of spirit. The bodie of man is morborum seminarium, a seed-plot of all diseases. No sooner, yea, before wee begin to bee borne, wee begin to bee sicke: Quis ille qui non aegrotat in hac vita? Quis non longum languorem trahit? nasci hic in corpore mortali incipere, aegrotare est. Aug. in Psal. cij. ante med. Who is hee (sayeth hee) that is not sicke in this lyfe? Who is hee that languisheth not? To begin to bee borne in this mortall bodie, is to bee sicke. The mynde and soule of man is subject vnto griefe, and anguish; which is an intollerable miserie: David compareth it to arrowes, Psal. xxxviij. 2. For thyne arrowes sticke fast in mee, and thy hand presseth me sore. Consonant wherevnto is that of Iob, Chap. xvj.13. His archers compasse me round about: hee cleaveth my reynes asunder, and doeth not spare. And, A wounded spirit, sayd Salomon, who can beare? The sense of it made CHRIST Himselfe say, My Soule is exceeding sorrowfull, even vnto death, Matth. xxvj.38. The estate of man is subject to Povertie, and Want: a grievous punishment; for ridiculos homines facit: the poore are the object of

mockerie. Salomon sayeth, Prov. xiv.20. The poore is hated, even of his owne neyghbour. And Prov. xix.7. All the brethren of the poore doe hate him; howe much more doe his friendes goe farre from him? Hee persueth them with wordes, yet they are wanting to him. The name of man is subject to shame and contempt; which even evill men abhorre more than death. Saul did rather choose to fall on his owne sworde, than to bee matter of sporte to his enemies. The wicked at the day of Iudgement, ere they endured the indignitie of this evill, would rather that hills and mountayns should fall vpon them. Yea, besides to howe manie miseries daylie is man lyable, to hunger, thirst, heate, colde, inaccommodation in dwelling, much travell, vaine hopes, &amp;c. howe manie are his private crosses, his publicke calamities, and evils, which wee bring vppon our selues, injuries done to vs by others? Yet when Death commeth, it freeth vs of all these. By Death wee lye still, and are quyet; wee sleepe, and are at rest, Iob iij.13. And, Blessed are the dead, that die in the LORD: they rest from their laboures, Rev. xiv.13. Before Death come, there can bee no perfect freedome from these evils: for, as Bernard speaketh, Liberatio plena atque perfecta ante diem sepulturae esse non poterit, quod maneat jugum gravè super filios Adam, à die exitiu
                     •
                   de ventre matris ipsorum, vsque in diem sepulturae in matrem omnium. In hac ergo die eripiam eum (nempè, justum) inquit, quando nihil jam vltra vel quod corpori, vel quod animae faciat mundus habebit. Ber
                     •
                  . Serm. 16. in Psal. xc. A full and a perfect freedome, before the day of our buriall, there can not bee: for there is a heavie yoake layde vpon the sonnes of Adam, even from the tyme they come out of their mothers womb, vntill the day of their buriall, when they are receaved into the bowels of their common mother. Then (sayeth the

LORD) in that day I will deliver the just man; when the world hath nothing more to doe, eyther with his bodie, or with his soule. Wherevnto consonant are the wordes of Isidorus, cited by Bernard; O mors, quam dulcis es miseris! quam suavis es amarè viventibus! quam jucunda es tristibus, at
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   lugentibus! O Death, how sweet art thou to them that are in miserie! how pleasant to those who liue in bitternesse! how delectable to the sad, and mournfull! For truelie of Death wee may say; Pon it finem omnibus malis in hac vita: dat terminum malis in hoc saeculo; adimit omnem calamitatem. Mors prebet terminum hominibus, in tribulationibus in hoc mundo. It putteth (sayeth hee) an ende to all evils in this lyfe, a period to all miseries that fall out in this tyme; it taketh away all calamitie, and maketh an ende to all troubles which befall men in this lyfe. Hee doeth therefore heerevpon conclude, Sed heu exspectata mors tardè venit! But alace, (sayeth hee) long looked for, and much desired Death, commeth slowlie! No marvell a Christian sayde so, since Cicero, an Ethnicke, Lib. 1. Tusc. quaest. could say, Pro dii immortales, quam illud verè jucundum hominibus esse debet, quo confecto nulla reliqua cura, nulla solicitudo futura sit! That is; O you immortall gods, how sweet and pleasant should that bee to men, which once being brought to passe, there shall bee no more care, nor anxietie!
            The next Happinesse included in this, that it is called a sleepe, is, That heereby wee are fitted and prepared for heavenlie Happinesse. By Death there is a preparation made, for our change, to the enjoying of aeternall Felicitie; whence it is called by BERNARD, Ianua vitae, initium refrigerii, sancti montis scala, &amp; ingressus in locum tabernaculi admirabilis, quod fixit Dominus, &amp; non homo Bern. Serm. on the 19 verse of the 5 chapter of IOB. The doore of lyfe, the beginning

of our refreshing, the ladder whereby wee goe vp to the holie mountayne, an entrie vnto the place of that admirable Tabernacle which the LORD Himselfe made, and not man.
            
            What sleepe, then, is lyke to this Sleepe? and what Sleepe more to bee desired than IT, were not the Bed wherein IT is enjoyed, seemeth to lessen all the former happinesse? For it is sayde by the Angell, They sleepe in the dust of the earth. The rememberance indeede of this Bed wherein man must take his last sleepe, deoth teach man Humilitie and Sobrietie; since as he was made of the dust, to dust he must returne againe. The Graue must be his House, &amp; he must make his bed in darknesse. Hee must say to corruption, Thou art my father; to the worme, Thou art my mother, and my sister, IOB xvij.13.14. Yet it doeth nothing derogate from the happinesse of Death: For, first, albeit it seeme base, to lye in the dust of the earth; yet it is the common &amp; onlie recept appoynted by GOD, to receaue our bodies, in our passage to Heaven. Neyther is there anie other place for our bodilie rest alotted, vntill our finall awakening: Dust (sayeth the LORD) thou art, and to dust thou shalt returne, GEN. iij.19. And therefore, Quis quaeri potest se in ea conditione esse, in qua nemo non est? SEN. Epist. 30. Who can complayne of that estate, wherein all men are alyke with him? Next; Of all Beds a man can lye downe into, it is the most kyndlie Bed: For the earth is mater omnium nostrum. And when wee are layde downe in IT, wee are but in the bosome of our common mother, who will bring vs foorth agayne into another vvorlde: in regarde whereof the Resurrection is called 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , Regeneration, MATTH. xix.28. Thirdlie; IT is of all Beds, the onlie Bed of Rest, wherein man most securelie sleepeth. Of all other Beds, everie

man, in some sort, may complayne with IOS, When I say, My bed shall comfort mee, my couch shall ease my complaynt; then Thou scarrest mee with dreames, and terrifiest mee through visions, IOB vij.13.14. For great travell is created for everie man, and an heavie yoake is vpon the sonnes of Adam, from the day that they goe out of their mothers wombe, till the day that they returne to the mother of all thinges. ECCL. xl.1. No quyet anie where in the interveaning tyme; but then they shall enter into their peace: they shall rest in their Beds, ISAI lvij.2.
            Fourthlie, IT is a Bed perfumed with the most costlie Perfume in the worlde. Wee reade PROV. vij.17. that the harlot had perfumed her bed with myrrhe, aloës, and cynamom: but it was a bed of whoredome and wickednesse. This Bed is a Bed of Holinesse, sanctified by the buriall of CHRIST IESVS. For as Hee died on the Crosse for vs, so lykewyse Hee would bee buried; that by the touch of his most holie Flesh, our buriall might bee sanctified. Fiftlie, IT is of all sortes of Beds most honourable: herefore it is written of Cyrus, in Zenophon, that hee sayd to his sonnes, When I am dead, lay not my bodie in golde, nor silver, or anie thing else: but, with all haste, lay it down in the earth. For what is more blessed, than to bee mixt there-with; which not onlie breedeth all good and pleasant thinges, but also nowrisheth and cherisheth the same?
            
            And lastlie; The second Comfort in this Text suddenlie ensuing, taketh away all matter of disheartening: For they shall not lye in the dust for ever. For, as one sayeth well, Est somnus quidem diuturnior solito, non diutius tamen, quam ad CHRISTI novissimum adventum duraturus: that is, It is a sleepe longer than other ordinarie sleepes; yet not to last longer, than the second comming of CHRIST IESVS. For they

shall bee awakened, to enjoye an happie estate, even Ever-lasting Lyfe.
            
            The knowledge of this estate after death, and long sleepe, wherein the bodies doe lye, it bringeth, without all mixture of sorrow, vnexpressable comfort. First, that man shall be awakened out of this long sleepe; heere is a singular comfort: but to bee awakened to everlasting lyfe, it is the hight of all Comfortes.
            
            
               Shall awake to everlasting lyfe: this is all one with this, their bodies shall be raysed againe out of their graues; and after they are vnited with their soules, shall obtayne everlasting Lyfe. This doctrine of the resurrectione of bodies, is onlie revealed in the word of GOD. It is to all those who haue not learned it herefra, as it was to the Athenians, Mockerie, Act. 17.32. And yet it is the onlie ground of our comfort: For, if in this lyfe onlie wee had hope in CHRIST, wee were of all men most miserable 1. COR. 15.19. It is that which giveth vs confidence and hope: For Resurrectio mortuorum, est fiducia christianorum, sayeth Tertul. de resur. carnis· It is an speciall article of our Fayth, which wee must holde vndenyable against all such wicked Hereticks, who would denye the same; wickedlie thinking, that the bodies being resolved into their first principles, shall lye without hope of restoreing to lyfe. Or, if there bee any bodies at all glorified, they shal not be the same which were layde in the graue, but some other made of the ayre, or such lyke thing. An impious Heresie, most manifestlie against infinite testimonies of Scripture, whereof this is one most evident. Wherefore, Augustine, Lib. 20. de Civit. Dei cap. 23. showeth it to bee the same with that of our Saviour, Iohn 5.28.29. For those whom the Angell sayeth, that they sleepe in the dust, are sayd by our Saviour, to bee in the graues. And what is to the Angell,

               They shal awake. It is to Christ, They shal heare the voyce of the Sonne of man, and come foorth. The Angel sayeth, Some to everlasting lyfe, some to shame, and eontempt. Our Saviour sayeth, Who haue done good, vnto the resurrection of lyfe, and who haue done evill vnto the resurrection of damnation. So clearlie consonant, that our Saviours wordes are a plaine exposition of the Angels, Tertullian most learnedlie in his booke De resurrectione carnis, refuteth this Heresie: and the learned after him haue done it most fullie.
            As for that they object, That the bodie being a base, vyle, contemptible, and corrupted thing, how can it bee awakened to glorie? they should haue considered, That albeit in matter it be base, yet it is made wonderfullie honourable. By GOD Himselfe was man created to bee immortall: and Hee made him an Image of His owne aeternitie. And CHRIST IESUS now incarnate, hath honored vs with this, That wee are members of His bodie, of His flesh, and of His bones. Ephes. 5.30. And by the glorification of His bodie, our bodies, His members, are alreadie begun to be glorified. And that Hee might present vs vnto Himselfe glorious, hath cleansed our bodies by the washing of regeneration, and made them temples of the holie Ghost: and wee are fed by the bodie and blood of IESUS CHRIST, to the certayne hope of this Resurrection, according as our Saviour sayeth Iohn 6.54. Who so eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternall lyfe, and I will rayse him vp at the last day. And as that father well marketh, Non possunt separari, in mercede quos opera conjungit. For who worketh together in justice, should bee rewarded together.
            In this poynt I marvell much how they dare derogate from the power of GOD: for Hee who made man first of nothing, what can hinder Him againe

now to make him vp of some thing? For Hee that calleth things which are not, as though they were, ROM. 4.17. how easilie may Hee call backe those thinges that were, and quicken the dead?
            For what although the bodies bee burnt in ashes, bee devoured of beasts, eaten of fowles or fishes? For Tertullian answering to this, sayeth, Habet et car
                     •
                   suos sinus interim, in aquis, in ignibus, in alitibꝰ et bestiis. The flesh also hath her own receptacles in the meane tyme, in the waters, in the fyre, in the fowles and beasts. Cum in haec dissolvi videtur, velut in vasa diffunditur. And when in these it is dissolved, it is powred in as it were in vessels. Si etiam ipsa vasa defecerint, cum de illis quoque defluxerit in suam matricem terram, quasi per ambages resorbetur, vt rursus ex illa repraesentetur. And if (sayeth hee) these vessels fayle, and it flowe out thereof, by turning againe, it is drunken in into the earth, and out of it, it may bee refounded againe, according to that which is wrytten, Revel. 20.13. And the sea gaue vp the dead, which were in it; and death and the graue delyvered vp the dead that were in them: and they were judged everie man according to his workes. Showing whatsoever kynde of death they died, they must all aryse, and giue presence, at judgement. Knoweth not the LORD by His infinite wisdome, where the smallest part of the dust, wherein their bodies are dissolved, lyeth? and by His infinite power, is Hee not able to collect them altogether? Shall wee denye Him that skill a master of familie hath in his owne house; or a gold-smith in his shop, who can readilie bring everie thing out of its owne place, and as they ought, in a perfect manner, put them together?

                   sufficient for their purpose.This power of GOD is evidentlie witnessed in the Phoenix, who albeit burnt in ashes, returneth to

lyfe: in the Flees and Wormes, dead in Winter, reviving againe in Summer; in the day buried in the night, the nixt day returning.
            And to affirme, that those bodies which shall bee glorified with the soule, shall not bee the same bodies, which were layde asleepe, it is to deny the Resurrection. For who can call that a Resurrection? that is, a raysing vp of that bodie which was fallen, a wakening of that which was asleepe. It were meerlie ridiculous, as the strength of the former argumentes evidentlie evinceth. Wherefore, we must vndoubtedly holde with Tertullian, that Resurget caro, &amp; quidem omnis, &amp; quidem ipsa, &amp; quidem integra. In deposito est ubicunque apud DEVM per fidelissimum sequestrem DEI &amp; hominum, IESVM CHRISTVM, qui &amp; homini DEVM, &amp; hominem DEO reddet, carni spiritum, &amp; spiritui carnem: that is, The flesh shall aryse, and all flesh, that selfe-same flesh, whole, and in its integritie. For, where ever it be, it is in sure keeping with GOD, through that faythfull Mediator betwixt GOD and Man, CHRIST IESVS; who will restore GOD to Man, and Man to GOD; the spirit to the flesh, and the flesh to the spirit.
            The same bodies, then, which were layde asleepe in the graue, shall bee awakened, and that by the ministerie indeede of the holy Angels, who are ministring spirits, for the good of the Elect▪ but efficiently it shal bee by the voyce of IESVS CHRIST, as Hee testifieth of Himselfe; Verilie, verilie, I say vnto you, The houre is comming, and now is, when the dead shall heare the voyce of the Sonne of GOD; and they that heare it,

Hee is their King, and will therefore call on them, to share of the Happinesse of His Kingdome, and to giue them a full and finall Evidence, That Death is swallowed vp into victorie. Hee will declare by His voyce, what vertue is in Him, to quicken them; &amp; will possesse them with that, which is the ende of their awakening, even everlasting lyfe.
            
            This is that happie Estate, which the Godlie both in their soules and bodies shall enjoy, at the last day. Happie, I say, because of Lyfe; but more happie, because Aeternall. The happinesse of this Estate, the wit of man can not conceaue; no tongue can expresse it: for no eye of man hath sene it, no eare heard it, nor haue entered into the heart of man, the thinges which GOD hath prepared for them that loue Him, 1. Cor. 2.9. And Gregorie speaking heereof, sayeth, Cùm homo mortalis de aeterna gloria disserit, coecus de luce disputat: that is, When as a mortall man reasoneth of aeternall Glorie, it is as a blinde man discerning coloures. Yet because such is the eagernesse of man's desire, to knowe somewhat of that Estate, and such vnspeakable Contentment it bringeth to the heartes of the Godlie, which haue the least glimpse of it; therefore the Spirit of GOD in Scripture, hath not left vs in this comfortlesse; but is content to expresse it, in some sort; that at least afarre off wee may see that which one day wee shall enjoye. Hee telleth vs, That that lyfe, is a lyfe of all brightnesse, joye, felicitie, and glorie; That therein wee shall get a Kingdome, an Inheritance vncorruptible, vndefyled, that fadeth not away. 1. Pet. j.4. A Crowne of Righteousnesse, 2. Tim. iv.8. A Crowne of Lyfe, a Crowne of Glorie, 1. Pet. v.4. An exceeding aeternall weyght of Glorie, 2. Cor.
               
iv.17. That there shall bee Glorie, Honour, and Peace, to everie man that worketh good, Rom. 11.10. The bodies shall haue their glorie: For wee looke (sayeth the Apostle) for the LORD IESVS CHRIST, who shall change our vyle bodie, that it may bee fashioned lyke vnto His glorious bodie, according to the working; whereby He is able to subdue all thinges to Himselfe, Phil. iij.21. That bodie which was sowen in corruption, shall be raysed in incorruption: that which is sowen in dishonour, shall be raysed in glorie: and that which is sowne in weaknesse, shall bee raysed in power: and what is sowen a naturall bodie, shal be raised a spirituall bodie, 1. Cor. xv.42.43.44. Wherevpon it is, that the Schoole-men gather foure speciall Enduementes, wherewith the bodie, as with a most gorgeous Robe, shall bee glorified. It shall be impassible, glorious, agile, and spirituall; suffering no corruption, shyning in brightnesse, as the starres in the firmament, with all readinesse and pleasure doing what the soule shall command: free from all animall employmentes, as eating, drinking, begetting of children: neyther marrying, nor giving in marriage; but aequall with the Angels of GOD, Luke xx.36. The soules agayne shall bee in perfect Happinesse, in regarde of their cleare vision of GOD. Heere wee see Him but darklie, as it were in a glasse: but there wee shall see Him face to face. Now we know but in part, but there wee shall know, even as wee are knowne, 1. Cor. xiij.12. And next, in regarde of their fruition of GOD: For the Lambe which is in the middest of the Throne, shall feede them, and leade them to the fountaynes of living waters: and GOD shall wype away all teares from their eyes, Revel. vij.17. And thirdlie, in regarde of their perfect loue of GOD. Yea, in a word, man in that estate enjoying GOD, shall participate of that same Happinesse, wherewith GOD Himselfe is happie.

For as the Happinesse of GOD consisteth in the Vision, or Contemplation of His owne Essence; So our Happinesse shal stand in the viewing of the Essence of GOD: or, which is all one, in beholding of the glorious, and amiable Countenance of that LORD, in whose presence there is fulnesse of joye, and at whose right Hand there are pleasures for evermore. Wherefore I may saye with BERNARD, Et quis non illic habitare vehementer desideret, &amp; propter pacem, &amp; propter amoenitatem, &amp; propter aeternitatem, &amp; propter DEI visionem? that is, And who will not earnestlie desire to dwell there, for the peace, the pleasure, the aeternitie, and the sight of GOD there?
            Having thus shortlie run through this CONSOLATORIE Text, the doctrine whereof, as it is at al tymes, so nowe moste necessarie, when your heartes are fraughted with griefe, for the death of our late Venerable Prelate; of whome albeit much hath beene worthilie spoken, yet it is impossible for vs, (not beeing of aequall worth with himselfe) to speake according to his worth: Vt enim de pictore, sculptore, fictore, nisi artifex judicare, ita nisi sapiens, non potest perspicere sapientem, Plin. Sec. Lib. 1. Epist. 10. Onlie a wyse man (sayth hee) can fullie obserue a wyse man: and hee must bee of aequall worth, who can remarke in the Worthie, what is worthie to bee observed. Therefore I resolved to cover his prayses with silence, and now onlie comfort you agaynst his death.
            But fearing, if too suddenlie I did stop the current of your griefe, it should rather over-flow, nor cease; I can not but giue you this vent, and with you acknowledge, that great is the losse which both Church and Policie doeth sustayne, beeing deprived of him: For justlie may that testimonie of prayse bee given

him, which the wyse man giveth to David, Eccl. 47.2. As is the fat taken away from the Peace-offring, so was David chosen out of the children of Israell: For albeit all the Peace-offering amongst the Israelites, was by a speciall lawe consecrated vnto the LORD, yet onelie the fat would the LORD haue given vnto Himselfe, as the speciall, chiefe, and best part. So albeit all the people of Israell were holie vnto the LORD, yet DAVID, in comparison with them, was as the fat of the Sacrifice, aboue others chosen of GOD, and delectable vnto Him. So may I say of our worthie Prelate, As the fat taken away from the Peace-offering; so hee, a man full of fat, that is, of choyce and excellent giftes, was speciallie chosen out by GOD, to bee consecrated to His glorie, in the good of His Church, and Common-wealth heere.
            For hee testified, in all the actes of his lyfe, that the grace of GOD had appeared vnto him, and taught him to denye all vngodlinesse, and worldlie lustes, and to liue godlie, righteouslie, and soberlie, in this present worlde: still seeking for that blessed Hope, and glorious Apperance of our LORD and SAVIOVR IESVS CHRIST.
            
            And, in particular, in the actes of his Priestlie, or Ministeriall Calling, hee did testifie, that hee was a chosen Vessell vnto CHRIST, to carrie His Name. For hee was a worke-man, who needed not to bee ashamed▪ rightlie hee could divide the Word of Trueth, fled youthfull lustes, and did followe Righteousnesse, Fayth, Charitie, and Peace, with them that call on the LORD with a pure heart, &amp;c.
            In the actes of his Prelacie, hee kythed, that the LORD had separated him, for this worke, as a man fit to rule. For hee was one that did rule his owne spirit: and so, in Salomon's esteeme, better than one that

taketh a Citie, Prov. xvj.32. In which Charge, as you haue heard, hee worthilie did discharge himselfe; provyding for Seminaries of Learning, and nowrishment for seede to growe therein. In these Seminaries, the Youth, as pleasant Plantes, did aboundantlie spring vp in his tyme: and he, after due tryall of their worth, planted them in the LORD'S Vineyarde: yea, after hee had planted them, hee transplanted some of them from one part of it, to another. For, as a wyse master Gardner, sometymes hee plucked fullie vp vnprofitable trees, out of their places, that they should not trouble the ground anie more; sometymes, according to the nature of the soyle, and the worth of the Plantes, hee did transplant them; that profitable trees, might haue profitable rowmes. And, aboue all, hee had a care, that the pestilent weedes of Haeresie and Schisme, should neyther abyde, nor enter therein: that almost heere, by his meanes, hee hath plucked vp Popish Superstition by the rootes.
            And in the actes of Policie, as a States-man, hee did evidentlie declare, that our mightie Prince did choose him out, according to the wyse counsell of Iethro to Moses, for an able man, one that feared GOD, loved the Trueth, and hated covetousnesse, Exod. xviij.21. And so hee discharged himselfe in all Employmentes of that kynde, that with IOB hee might haue sayde of himselfe, that hee was in such admiration amongst the Princes, and Nobles, that when hee spake, they refrayned talking, and layd their hand on their mouth: they held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roofe of their mouth, Iob xxix.9.10.
            That such a man is taken away, it can not bee denyed, but that it praesageth some heavie judgement vpon this Land: and that the rather, as Esay in the

lyke case complayneth, because the righteous perish, and no man layeth it to heart; and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away, from the evill to come. Esay. lvij.1. Oh, if men would consider, howe that such men are both Lightes and Pillars, where they liue; and what respect the LORD hath vnto them; and howe from tyme to tyme Hee hath wonderfullie spared others, for their sakes: how all Israll was spared, for one Moses: and howe hee would haue spared Sodom and Gomorrah, if there had beene ten righteous men therein, Gen. xviij. and how that the Angell could not doe anie thing agaynst them, vntill LOT did escape to the mountaynes: The consideration of this, would make them to take to heart the death of the Righteous, and in tyme by repentance praevent these judgementes, which seeme to ensue.
            This is the speciall vse should bee made of our Prelates death: and not, as we are all doing, mourne or weepe for him. For, knowing the happie estate wherein hee is, wee haue matter to rejoyce, and bee glad. His soule is convoyed to the bosome of Abraham, wherein the glorious companie of Angels, and blessed Sayncts, hee is praysing the LORD. His bodie nowe resting from manie toylesome travelles, is layde in a sound sleepe; out of which, one day, by the sweete voyce of his Saviour CHRIST IESUS, it shall bee awakened: and when Hee shall come in Glorie, Hee will then bring him both in soule and bodie to Glorie with Him: and then, with other wysemen, hee shall shyne as the brightnesse in the firmament; and because he hath turned manie vnto righteousnesse, as a farre for ever and ever, DAN. 12.
            Wherefore should wee then mourne for him? For as Bernard sayeth, Pro defunctis fidelibus, non de

bemus plorare; sed DEO gratias agere, quia eos de miseria hujus seculi dignatus est liberare, &amp; eos ad loca refrigerii, lucis, &amp; pacis, sicut credimus, fecit transire: that is, wee ought not to mourne for the faithfull that are dead, but giue thankes to GOD for them, who hath vouchsafed to delyver them out of the miseries of this lyfe, and as wee are perswaded, hath made them to flit vnto the places of refreshment, light,, and peace. And, I am assured, if hee were now speaking to you, hee would tell you of his Happinesse; that hee resteth now from his laboures, and that his workes haue followed him. So that if wee mourne nowe, wee may hurt our selues, but not profite him. Let those onlie carnallie mourne for their friends, that are ignorant of the nature of Death, and denye the Resurrection. But let vs rejoyce, who knowe they are asleepe, and shall bee awakened, to everlasting Lyfe.
            
            First, then, you worthie Citizens, cease now, and leaue off your mourning for your Reverende Prelate: bee no more lyke Rachel, who wept for her children, and would noo bee comforted; nor with Ioash, weeping over the face of Elisha, and crying, O my father, my father; the chariot of Israell and the horse-men thereof. Albeit I must yeelde this much to your griefe, that being depryved of him, you haue these concurring judgementes: There is taken from you the Iudge, and the Prophet; the prudent, and the ancient; the honourable man, &amp; the counseller, the eloquent orator, ESAI. 3.2.3. Therefore I cannot better speake vnto you, than in the wordes of our Saviour, to the women who followed him to the place of his sufferinges, Weepe not for mee, but weepe for your selues, O yee daughters of Ierusalem. So you haue no matter to weepe for him, but onlie for your selues. Weepe, that when you had him, you made not a good vse of him; that you

did not obey his doctrine, follow his counsels: and yet in this hee hath not left you comfortlesse; for more carefullie he hath provyded Pastores for your instruction, nor ever anie that went before him: whose doctrine if you hearken vnto and obey, when Death (which may bee shortlie) shall sease vpon you, and yee shall bee gathered vnto him; with comfort you shall see him, and say, Heere is hee that turned vs vnto righteousnesse: and at the sight of you joyfullie shall hee say, LORD, loe, heere am I, and the children which thou hast given mee. HEB. 2.13.
            Next, you my Reverend Colleagues, his much respected Presbyters, why continue you your mourning, lyke Orphanes destitute of a father? you are not ignorant, as these who haue not hope. Remember you not how carefull hee was, not to leaue you comfortlesse? what testimonies at his death had we of his loue? did hee not shortlie before his death communicate with vs alone, in the holie Sacrament of the blessed bodie and blood of CHRIST IESUS▪ which was the last testimonie of CHRIST his owne loue to his Disciples? when Elijah was to bee rapt vp into the Heavens, being desyred of Elisha, saying, I pray the let a double portion of thy spirit bee vpon mee; It seemed hard this petition to Elijah: yet how gladlie did our ELIjAH, when wee Elisha-lyke, on bowed knees, did begge His blessing, answere vs, with his hand on everie one of our heades, saying, The LORD blesse you, and double his grace, and loue to you, that ever hee granted vnto mee. What can wee but hope for Vertue from that hand, as Elisha receaved Vertue from the Cloake of Elijah? Remember that storie registrated by Ambrose, de off. lib. 1. cap· 41. of Sixtus Bishop of Rome, and Laurens his Deacon: who seeing his Bishop going to Martyrdome, weeping, said, Quô

progrederis sine filio pater? Quô sacerdos sine diacono properas? nunquam sacrificium sine ministro offerre consueveras? quid in me displicuit pater? num degenerem probasti? experire certè vtrum idoneum ministrum elegeris, cui commisisti Dominici sanguinis dispensationem, cui consummandorum consortium sacramentorum: huic consortium sanguinis negas, &amp;c. That is, Father, whither doest thou goe without thy sonne? O thou my priest, whither hastenest thou without mee thy Deacon? it was not hitherto thy custome to offer sacrifice without thy helper? what is there in mee nowe hath displeased thee? hast thou found mee faynte hearted? essay mee yet whether or no thou madest choice of a fit helper for thee, to whom thou diddest commit the dispensation of CHRISTS blood, and whose societie thou refusedst not in performing the holie Sacramentes; why wilt thou denye his fellowship, in shedding of his blood with thee?
            To whom Sixtus replyed, Non ego te, fili, derelinquo aut desero, sed majora tibi debentur certamina, nos quasi senes levioris pugnae cursum recepimus: te quasi juvenem manet glori
                     •
                  sior de tyranno triumphus mox venies, flere desiste, post triduum me sequeris: that is, O my sonne, I doe not vtterlie forsake thee: there are greater conflictes abyding thee: we as olde men haue vndergon lesser skirmisses: to thee, as to a young man, abydeth over this Tyrant a more glorious triumph. Thou shalt come shortlie: cease therefore to weepe. For within three dayes thou shalt follow mee.
            How often in lyke manner before his departure did hee thus comfort vs? yea, if hee were nowe speaking to you, would hee not say? I doe not leaue you succourlesse; but as I haue foughten cowragiouslie my fight; so follow my example: the tyme you haue to abyde behinde mee, is but short:

your Victorie shall be great, and your triumph glorious: and where I am as a starre in the firmament, you also shall bee there as brightnesse, shyning with mee in Glorie.
            And as for you his Kinsmen and Friends, let the dayes of your mourning and weeping haue an ende: Non amisistis, sed praemisistis, you haue not lost him, hee is but gone before you. You had his travelles while hee lived: let him now enjoy his rest, the ende of his travelles. I may say to you as Calvine, in a case not vnlyke to this, sayde to a friend, Ideo DEVS sustulit, quia &amp; illi è mundo emigrare, &amp; hac orbitate vel te humiliari, vel tuam patientiam probari vtile erat. Epist. 19. GOD therefore tooke him away, because to him to flit out of this world, and to you by lacke of him, your parent eyther to humble you, or to trye your patience, it was alwayes profitable. Neyther hath hee left you comfortlesse: for there bee few of you, but enjoyeth some reall testimonies of his loue and favour. For never was anie parent more affectionate to his children, than he to his respected friends. You haue also in his place a sonne worthie of such a father, in vertue and pietie tracing his steppes: whom if you duelie honour, his worth and affection shall supplie much the losse of such a father.
            And lastlie, let vs all not onlie cease to mourne for him, but also cease to fret at death, since such vtilitie shee bringeth to the godlie, and let our murmuring against death bee turned to an endevouring to liue a godlie lyfe; that living well, wee may die well. For bona mors justi propter requiem, melior propter novitatem, optima propter securitatem: the death of the just man is good for his enjoyed rest; better for his newenesse of lyfe; and best of all, for that safetie and securitie hee is put into. The LORD then grant that wee all

may liue the lyfe of the righteous, whereby we may die the death of the righteous▪ that sleeping with them in the dust of the earth, with them also wee may bee awakened to everlasting Lyfe, through IESUS CHRIST. AMEN.

The Bishopricke of Aberdene beeing now voyde, by decease of the late Bishop; and wee being sufficientlie perswaded, as well of the Learning, Gravitie, Wisdome, and true Godlinesse, of PATRICKE FORBES of CORSE, enhabling him duelie to exercise and discharge the Calling of a Bishop; as of the great and earnest desire of our best affected Subjects of that Diocesse, to haue him established their Ordinarie; as was well witnessed by their expression thereof at the last vacancie of the

sayd Sea. We haue therefore made speciall choyse of the sayd PATRICKE, to bee thereto preferred. Requyring you, for the more speedie and solemne performance thereof, to cause forme, and haste vnto vs, such Writs as wee are to signe for that effect; and in everie other thing appertayning therevnto, to proceed according to the Ordinance of the late Act made in our last Parliament, anent the election of Arch-bishops and Bishops. Which not doubting but yee will preciselie performe, wee bid you Farewell.

               Letter of the Arch-bishops and Bishops of SCOTLAND; To the Laird of CORSE.
               
               
                  To our verie Reverend and loving Brother, the Laird of CORSE.
                  
               
               RIght Reverend and loving Brother, his Majestie having made choyse of you, before all others, to the Bishopricke of Aberdene, and signified the same by his Letters vnto vs, which you shall receaue herewith inclosed, we could doe no lesse, than to impart it vnto you, &amp; witnesse the joy of our hearts, for this his Majestie's resolution: Not so much for the favour and respect wee perceaue carried by his M. to your selfe, though that both with you and vs should bee of no little account, as that wee fore-see

the great profit that is to redound to the Church of GOD, by this your Advancement. Others doe interpret, according to their myndes, that these Places are Places of Honour and ease, and for that respect desired: But wee, who haue had the experience of so manie years service, know that the care &amp; burthen goeth farre beyond either Commoditie or Honour. And were it not for GOD'S Service, and the vpholde of His Church amongst vs, wee could haue wished to liue private Ministers, rather than in the rowmes wee are called vnto. But in such Callinges, as you knowe better than anie of our selues, the burthen &amp; care of the Charge, must no more deterre vs, than these outward showes of Honour and ease allure vs. To seeke Places of this kynde, may well bee thought Ambition; but to refuse, and draw back, when GOD calleth, is Disobedience: and if it be done for the eschewing of vexations, it is farre from the Christian courage &amp; resolution we should all haue. Now, wee are assured, if anie man did ever come to this Place by GOD'S calling, you are hee; whether wee consider the instance made in the last Vacancie of that Sea, by all the Ministers, and Gentlemen of the Countrey, which wee perceaue his Majestie doeth not forget; or your owne behaviour in it, that by the moyen of none, direct or indirect, hath made sute to bee preferred. And therefore, as wee from our heartes thanke GOD, who hath put it into his M. heart to goe this way, so wee must in the Name of GOD, and by the loue you beare to the mayntaynance of His Trueth, request and require you to accept the Calling, assuring your selfe, that wee for our partes, howe long it pleaseth GOD to vse our service here, shall not bee wanting, by His grace, in anie thing that becommeth the Brethren of our Vocation

towardes you. And our certayne hope is, that notwithstanding all these fightes wee endure with enemies without, &amp; those that should be friends within, our GOD shall giue vs strength to beare out, and by His Blessing in the ende justifie to the world our proceedinges; wherein having you to bee a labourer and worker with vs, wee shall bee so much the more encouraged. As to the rest that should be done for your formall entrie, wee remit the care thereof to him whom it concerneth, and commit you at this tyme, and ever, to the protection and blessing of Allmightie GOD.

               BRother, I haue receaved your Letter, and am glad you choosed rather to send a bearer, than come your selfe at this tyme. My earand was chieflie to signifie vnto you, that wee haue obtayned his Majestie's consent, for placing the Laird of CORSE at ABERDENE
                  ▪ which you and I much desired in the last Vacancie. And, I trust in GOD, nothing shall proue more profitable to His Church, and a better

man to beare downe the enemies of all within those partes, than this. I looke daylie for his Majestie's Warrand to the Chapter, to conveane, and proceede in that Election: and how soone it commeth, will sende to you the particular instructions anent the proceeding: praying you to advertise me, whither to sende my Letters, as soone as you can. And so, to the next occasion, I rest

               Letter of a most Reverende Father in GOD, IOHN SPOTSWOOD, Arch-bishop of Saynct-Andrewes, To PATRICK FORBES, Laird of CORSE.
               
               
                  To my verie loving Brother, The Laird of CORSSE.
                  
                  SIR,
               
               AS I was closing the former Letter, a pacquet came to mee from Court, contayning a Licence to the Deane and Chapter of Aberdene, to meete, and elect a worthie person to that place which now vaketh, with a private recommendation of his Majestie for your selfe. Of this I thought meete to giue you signification: Because howe soone the Licence can passe the Seale, I will send it, with such directions, as are fit for the orderlie proceeding of matters: Neyther will I insist with you, not to declyne the Place, vpon the scruples mentioned in your Letter; seeing wee haue given you sufficient satisfaction there-anent, and that nowe, thankes to GOD, wee are in the expectation of a good peace: Rather I will

beseech you consider, what the state of this tyme, and the Church of GOD in it, craveth at your handes. I shall not mention the publicke enemie, or yet our Politickes; who, I am perswaded, did never heare of anie thing more to their discontentment, than your nomination for this Place. Onlie be pleased to looke vnto our selues; and you shall see there was never more neede to keepe a Church from disorder. As yee wryte of your selfe, GOD is my witnesse, I could wish to bee vnknowne in the world, and serue GOD in the obscurest place, rather than where by His Providence I am casten. But wee are not at our owne choyse, and so must you thinke. Where GOD calleth, To runne away, it is not Modestie, but Rebellion, and Disobedience. GOD giue vs in this short tyme, to bee wyse, and faythfull, and to despyse all thinges in respect of the Reward proposed: on which if wee holde our eyes, wee shall never bee discowraged by the malice of the wicked. I take my leaue, and rest
               
                  
                     Your assured Brother, SAINCT-ANDREWES.

               RIght Worshipfull and deare Brother, after heartie Salutation, the Letters which together with yours are come to mee from the South, leade mee to

thinke, that you haue guessed rightlie at the purpose of the Arch-bishop's entreatie: For even this same night I haue receaved a Letter from all the Bishops in Edinburgh, together with his Majestie's Letters to them, and to the lordes of his highnesse Secret Counsell; verie playnlie and peremptorilie appoynting me for your Bishopricke. Nowe his Majestie's Letter is both so free and peremptorie, as truelie it hath casten mee into great anxietie of mynde; so as I stand much in need of your counsel and Prayers to GOD for directiō. I haue sent you herewith the copy of his M. Letter, that you may so much the better consider what difficultie of resolution I am put vnto. The LORD bee my Counsellour. Thus, referring the issue of all to GOD, and commending you heartilie to His Grace, I rest ever

               Another Letter of the Laird of CORSSE, To M. THOMAS MITCHELL.
               
               
                  To my Worshipfull and deare Brother, Master Thomas Mitchell, Minister of the Gospell at Vdney.
                  
               
               RIght Worshipfull and deare Brother, after all heartlie salutation, I receaved your Letter this thursday after noone, the xij of March. After the recept of the Letters whereof I sent you a copie, I wrote backe a long Letter to the Bishops, whereby to excuse my selfe, and to lay off the burthen they had moved his Majestie to lay vpon me. But agaynst my expectation I haue reported nothing but a more

vehement insisting, and that with certification, that by declyning the Calling, I will incurre his Majestie's bitter indignation, and the imputation of contemning GOD'S Vocation, and the voyce of His Church also. My lord of Saynct-Andrewes wrote to mee also, that a Warrand was come to him, to be signed, and sent to the Chapter of Aberdene, for proceeding to the election; and that hee would sende it north with diligence. So as I am casten in such agonie, as I can doe nothing but attende the issue of GOD'S working. I would with all my heart haue fled that Charge in this so dangerous a tyme, and dangerous course in tyme. But they haue put mee to too great a strayt, eyther to accept, or to incurre the king's indignation; which to a Subject is the messenger of death. The LORD sende all to a good ende. The Grace of GOD bee with you.

               RIght Honourable, and Reverende, our loue and duetie in our common Saviour remembered, please, at the last Generall Assembly holden in Aberdene, the greatest part both of Preachers, and Professours of all degrees, cryed, by a Supplication subscrybed by them, to that Assemblie, and by them to his Majestie, to fill our Bishopricke then vacant, with

your selfe, as fittest of all men for that Seat. His M. finding nowe that Seat vacant agayne, hath nominate you vnto that rowme. The Chapter beeing conveaned this day, vpon a Warrand directed from his M. and with them Brethren of the Ministerie, Commissioners from all Presbyteries within the Diocesse, haue all in one joyfull voyce made choyse of you, and haue sent vnto you some of their number, to acquaynt you with their Election, and to require, in the Name of GOD, not to flee this His Calling by their voyces, in a tyme of such evident necessitie; to whose credit remitting, wee commende you for now, and ever, to the Grace of GOD.

I haue thought the seventeenth of May the fittest tyme, and haue given advertisement to the Bishops, to meete at the day. I will haue the Laird to dyne with me on the day of Consectation, as I tolde you. You will haue care, that hee bee accompanied with some graue Ministers, bebesides his owne Friendes, which I knowe will attende him. No other thing commeth to my mynde to advertise, but that his Majestie is exceeding well pleased with your procedure in ABERDENE at the Election; and exspecteth good service, both to GOD, and himselfe; whereof I am perswaded. You

will see, that one be dispatched to Edinburgh, for passing these thorowe the Seales; and, that they may meete you at your comming hither. What you would haue done, or provided, on my part, I pray you advertise mee: And nowe commending you to GOD, I rest

               Letter of a most Reverend Father in GOD, and most honourable Lord, Iohn Spotswood, Arch-bishop of Saynct-Andrewes, Primate, and Lord high Chancellar of Scotland; To Doctor Iohn Forbes of Corse; vpon the report of the Godlie death of his Father, Patrick Forbes of Corse, late Bishop of Aberdene.
               
               
                  To my Reverend and loving Brother, Doctor Iohn Forbes of Corse.
                  
                  MOST DEARE BROTHER,
               
               IF it bee true, which is commonlie sayd, and I verilie belieue, that great sorrowes are lessened, when others partake of the same; then may your griefe bee much eased, considering the numbers that beare a part with you in this great losse. In so necessarie a tyme, to bee bereaved of such Counsell, and Comfort, as GOD had furnished him with, I meane your worthie Father, for the directing of some, and strengthening of others, I know not what it portendeth to our Church. When Bishop Elphinstone, the Founder of your Colledge, was layde in Graue, the tradition is, that a voyce was heard cry, Tecum, Gulielme, Mitra sepelienda; and, that the Pastorall Staffe brake in pieces. Hee was certaynlie an excellent man; and I may truely say, since him, vnto your Father, there arose not the lyke in that Church. What say I, in that Church? Everie man can speake of that hee hath knowne, and seene: and for my selfe, I speake trueth; So wyse, judicious; so graue and gracefull a Pastor, I haue not known in all 
                     •
                  ny tyme, in anie Church. Not to speake of his learning

in all sortes of Divinitie, of his prudencie in Church-governement, of his solid advysses in matters of State, or of the manie gracious conferences I haue had with him in private. I shall never forget the answere hee gaue to some Brethren, who desired of vs a Letter to his Majestie, for dispensing with their obedience to the order praescribed in the ministration of the holie Sacrament, when all had consented to wryte, as they desired. And Will you, sayd he, justifie the doctrine of these men, who haue called the reverend gesture which we vse, Idolatrie, &amp; raysed such a schisme in our Church? Till they bee brought publicklie to confesse their Errour, or Heresie rather, I shall never bee yeelding for my part. It was before indifferent, nowe I esteeme it necessarie, in regard of the false opinions they haue dispersed, to retayne constantlie the forme wee haue receaved. With such a zeale, and courage, did hee in that matter expresse himselfe, as they that made the motion, were strickē dumbe. Surelie, I my selfe, that never behelde him without reverence, did heare him that day with wonder. To remember these things, it doubleth my sorrow: But hee was come to yeares; and this Age not worthie to enjoye him anie longer. Let mee say this without flattrie; Our losses are some way recompensed in your selfe; GOD hath given you both Grace, and Learning; and the expectation is great, which the Church hath of you. Goe on, therefore, and bee comforted. Nothing in lyfe, I cōfesse, hath troubled my selfe so much, as the death of them I loved, &amp; the death of your worthy Father in particular. But wee must yeeld to that Great Ruler, and knowe, that Hee disposeth most wyselie, both of persons, and of thinges. Hee is gone from

vs, to a better Societie; vnto which I wish wee may all bee gathered in GOD His good tyme. I rest

                  REVEREND AND DEARE BROTHER,
               
               THE tydinges of the departure of your most Reverend Father, put a sore knell to my heart; and doubtlesse that wound had gone deeper, if with Iob, the thing that I was afrayde of, had not come vnto mee. At my last loosing from him, which (yee remēber) was fewe days, or rather houres, before his dissolution, I had no small wrastling in my Breast, betwixt Ioye and Griefe. Griefe, I say, and no wonder, beeing to parte from One, who was to mee in place of manie, and see his face no more. Yet had I beene vnthankfull to GOD, and vnduetifull to him, with whose soule, my soule was so nearlie knit; if I had not rejoiced in that grace of GOD, which I saw so aboundantlie in him, made manifest by the gracious speaches, which at that tyme dropped frō his lips. These two evills, which haue bene accustomed, in extremities, to affect the strongest, moved him not at all; not acerbitas doloris: Sleepe had departed from

his eyes; appetite to meat or drinke, was gone; thus nature had fayled, &amp; Medicine could no more worke yet all so patientlie endured, yea, so kyndlie and graciouslie accepted, as was wonderfull. Neither did the feare of Death, which is omnium terribilium terribilissimum, vexe him. Hee was not at that tyme to begin his acquaintance with It, as he at that instant professed, to our great comfort who heard him; and therevpon called to mynde a memorable storie, which he deduced at length, to our great admiration. Death was become familiar to him, and esteemed to bee in lucro. He was not as a tree hewen down by violence; but as a sheafe of corne comming in due season into the barne. Having served his Master aboue 70 years, hee could say with Hilarion, Egredere anima mea, qu
                        •
                     
                     modo mortem formidabo, quae me meo creatori sit reddit
                        •
                     
                     ra. What the renowned Arch-bishop of Canterburie, Lanfranck, prayed often for, That hee might die such a death, as hindered not his speach, was granted to your most Reverend Father, &amp; more; having his speach articulate, and distinct, as ever, memorie and judgement aboue all that could haue bene expected. His last trust to me, which was his greatest care on earth, cōcerning the filling of that Sea with a man furnished, as the necessitie both of tyme &amp; place requyreth, hath bene in part alreadie, and shal yet more fullie, (when occasion shall offer) by the grace of GOD, be discharged by me. A great Prelate is fallē in our Israell. The hole wherein that Cedar stood, argueth his greatnes, &amp; will not be easilie filled. The Lord in His mercy provide.
               In calling these things to mynde, I may be readilie thought a miserable comforter; but having to do with a man of vnderstanding, I am confident to obtayne leaue, to fixe my tabernacle here a little, and communicate with you, what haue bene the thoughts of my

heart, concerning him who was your Father, &amp; mine: the man on earth, I must acknowledge, whose counsell availed me most in the manifold distresses which were commō to vs both. I had a reverend estimation of him, while he was living, &amp; know well how steadable he was both in Church and Common-wealth: but now being dead, I knowe howe it is that my affection is more bended, than when he was living: Dulciora vidētur omnia, carētibus, said Nicolas de Clamāgis, vpon the death of his deare friend. They who haue bene in their lyfe profitable to others, and by whose lyfe much more good may be expected, no marvell, if they be still lamented. But he is gone▪ 
                  Abiit, nō obiit: we haue somewhat of him that remaines after death: the bodie gone to the earth, there to rest, vnder the hope of that blessed Resurrection, Illo mane: the spirit returned to Him who gaue it: his good name, better than a good oyntment, remayneth with vs: and what he was, and hath done, shall be spoken of throughout the worlde, for a rememberance of him, both for his commendation, and incitation of others, who shall heare of him. His memorie is blessed. Those who truely feare GOD, speak of your most Reverend Father, with all respect: they speake of him (to the great joy of my heart) what hath bene observeable in him from his verie first beginning: A Chyld of God; One who earlie sought Him; &amp; a Man of God, who being planted in the House of God, and flowrishing in His Courts, hath continued to bring foorth fruit, even in his old age. Ye will excuse mee, if (falling on this subject) I enlarge my selfe a little, and make faythfull relation to you of that which I haue receaved frō the mouthes of those of best Note in the kingdome, and whereto I my selfe, in the most part, haue bene privie.
               That blessed Apostle S. Paul, served God from his

Elders: from them he tooke his being, from them his pietie &amp; Religion. Timothie, the first Bishop of Ephesus, had the lyke from his grand-mother Lois, and his mother Eunice. And was not this a great mercie of God towardes your most Reverend Father, that hee was the sonne of your Grand-father, whose name is great in the Church, for his zeale towards God, &amp; his Religion, his cōversation being answerable thereto▪ His care in the education of his children▪ of whom God hath given good store, was not the least or last part of his cōmendation. Herefrae it came, that your Rev. Father, who, as his first-borne, had right to the double portion, spent not the most &amp; greatest part of his younger years in trivialibus &amp; juvenilibus; which being the case of that great Basile, was frequentlie deplored, &amp; lamented by him. But I remember when I was yet of verie tender yeares, to haue seene him at Saint-Andrews, folowing the studie of Divinitie, with great approbation. Then was he laying a good foundatiō for the time to come. God Almighty had shapē him for another course of life, than he intended; who loved alwayes to be exercised in reading, writing, informing, &amp; instructing others, by declining all publik charge. That could not be. The Church had need of him; therfore he could not be hid. Herefrō came his emploiments publick, first at the Church of Keith; to the which hee was in a manner forced, by the earnest entreaties, yea, &amp; obtestations of those of the Ministry of most respect in the Diocesse of Murray, where that Church lieth; and Aberdene, who had no smal, eyther losse or gain by the plantation therof. His labor there in the Lord, was not in vain: Res ipsa loquitur, and the posterity shal retain the monumēts. But there might he not stay, howbeit as vnwilling to leaue, as hee was first to vndergo that charge. He persued not Honour,

but Honour persued him, as Nazianz. said of S. Basil, or as Cyprian of Cornelius, Bishop of Rome, Episcopa

And a little after; Ipse vim passus est, vt Episcopatum coactus acciperet. The lyke is recorded of S. Cyprian himselfe, &amp; others, who haue done most good in the Church of God. I think in his translation to Aberdene, I see the worthie Emp. Theodos. taking Nazianz. from the strayt and little Church wherein he taught, and putting him in a more large and famous, with these wordes, Pater, tibi, &amp; sudoribus tuis, DEVS per nos Ecclesiam tribuit. What joye was to all honest minded men in his promotion? who thought no lesse of him, than the great Constantine was accustomed to speake of Eusebius, Bishop of Caesarea, Foelicem Eusebium, qui non vnius vrbis, sed orbis propè totius Episcopatu dignus esset. In him was the viue vpset of the Ancient Renowned Bishops Ambrose, Augustine, &amp;c. No dumbe dogg, but endewed with the tongue of the Learned. He could speak a word in season. And it was seene in him, what S. August. observed of S. Ambr. In populo verbū veritatis rectè tractantē omni die Dominico. Wherin your most Rev. father was so instāt, that notwithstāding of his great age▪ &amp; multitude of effairs, for which scarcely any one man was sufficient, yet could he not hearkē to them, who pittying him, wisht him to forbear preaching, &amp; pi

                      admirabilis. It must be truelie sayd of him, as of that worthie Iehojada, He hath done good in Israel, &amp; towards God, and His House. As there was no vertue requisite in an accomplished Prelate, which was not in an eminent degree to bee found in him; So was there no state or person, within his reach, which did not partake of his good. That Bishopricke, which by injurie of tyme, wickenesse of some, and negligence of of his Praedecessours, was almost brought to the last cast, had him a Restorer. Your worthie and famous Vniversitie, founded by Bishop Elphinstone, and Hospitall by Bishop Dumbar, may vaunt of him, as of a second Founder. Those Churches in that Diocesse, which (I neyther can nor will say, were vnited, but) knit together in couples, to the destruction of manie thousand souls; and by his great wisdome and payns, haue bene sundered, and severallie planted, may cry, Hosanna: Blessed, &amp;c. The Prophets, &amp; children of the Prophets, to whō he was alwais most affable, &amp; who came to him, as a Father, &amp; Oracle, in al their doubts and distresses, may now cry, My father! my father! the chariot of Israel, and the horsmen therof! The countrey people, both Nobilitie, Gentrie, and others, who had him a common arbiter, for setling their questions &amp; jarres, haue good reason now to take heede to themselues, and be more calme, and quyet: they know not where to find an odsman, and composer of their effayrs, so wyse, faythfull, and paynfull, as he was. I wil not mention his beneficence to poore friendes, and others in necessitie. I haue both over-seene and over-heard in my travells with him, when hee hath done with the right hand, what he would not haue the left hand the know. This is not all yet. His good was not cōsumed in these bounties. The most eminent seats in the kingdome found their losse in his fall. How modest

and graue was his carriage? what wisdome &amp; soliditie was in his advysses? Such weyght &amp; authoritie was in al his speaches, that I may truely say, When he spake, the princes stayed talk, and laid their hand on their mouth: after his words, they replyed not; and his talk dropped on them. One thing graced all his doings, at home, and abroad; in publick, and private; his sinceritie, and Godlie purenesse. It may be sayd most justly of him, that Nazianz. sayd of Basil, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , Hee cared not for the applause of men. The prayse that Cicero gaue to Brutus, and Marcelline to Pratextatus, is more competent to him, who did nothing to please; but whatsoever he did, pleased. My affection hath drawn me farther than I intended. Ye wil pardon mee. I must draw to that which hath withdrawn him from vs. That peremptory question propounded by the Royal Prophet, What man liveth, and shall not see death? I acknowledge to bee a triumphant Negatiue, and will giue no other answere than that of the great Apostle, STATUTUM est omnibus semel mori. But I see vnder that, a singular providēce of our God, in the death of His secret ones, which He acknowledgeth to be precious in his sight. How many haue sought after the lyfe of your most Reverende Father? layde their snares, consulted together in heart, and made a league agaynst him, and others with him? not for his or their offence, but for righteousnes sake; let this suffice for you who knoweth the guyse. But God hath not given him over to the will of his adversaries: he is gone to his graue in peace, and in a full age, maugre their hearts; and that same God hath filled their faces with shame: they haue begun to fall, and shall surelie fall: a part of them hath bene as stubble, and the rest will bee found in their monethes. This is the Lord's work, and is marvelous in our eyes. He hath foughten

that good fight, finished his course, kept the fayth, &amp; now enjoyeth the crown. His departure is aliorū majore damno quam suo. Most justlie may I say of him, as that famous P. Martyr wrote cōcerning the most learned Bucer, the two lights of those two glorious Vniversities of Cambridge &amp; Oxford, Nunc ille ad suum nostrum

The Lord make vs wise, to prevent it, &amp; careful, every mā in his station, to proue faithful. Hereafter (deare brother) you must be to me in stead of your Father. And my wish, as my hope is, that this Church shall haue a Rod out of that Stock, a younger Greg. Naz. to fil the rowme of the Elder. In the meane tyme, let mee entreat you to make vse of me, as one who reverencing the grace of God in you, will studie to approue himselfe

                  REVEREND BROTHER,
               
               THE losse which commeth by the death of your worthie Father, is neither only, nor most yours.

Our Church hath lost a Father with you; yea, the Churches losse is greater than yours. Publik losses, in vpright judgements, go before private, &amp; the Church her children, who are deprived of him, are both mo in number, and so the more to be pittied; as lykwyse in a greater spirituall infancie, and so had more need of a fatherlie care. These thoghts made me to doubt, whether you or I needed more comfort. Sure, wee need both. In one thing I yeeld vnto you, that your losse is double; you being both his son by nature, &amp; a child of our Church by grace. For the cōmon losse, let vs both condole; and that so much the more: that as one sayd, Learned men, when they die, should be more lamented than kings; because kings haue heyrs, &amp; learned mē haue none. So may we say, Our sorrow ought to be the greater, when such glorious starres are darkened: for we are not sure of so bright to fil their place. As for your particular, I can not deny, but ye haue sufficient cause of sorrow; and therefore I will not preasse on you a stoicall apathie, but onelie invite you to a Christian moderation: first, from th' Apostle, because your sorrow is with hope of meeting again: next, from God's lōg lend of him vnto you. God took not your Father from you, till He made your selfe a Father: &amp;, which I account more of, till ye had by your father, in a long enjoied societie, as full a spirituall education (so to speak) in your ryper years, as ye had naturall in your yoūger. And this is some way singular in him &amp; you; that we haue not in our Land a Prelate who hath left behind him a son of his owne calling, so advanced in age, and so rype in gifts. Let me close these few lines, with two words; one for my selfe, &amp; another for you. For my selfe; I pray GOD, that the viue representations of Vertue and Grace, which I ever saw in your Father, and with the which, so oft as I was in his companie,

I was wōderfullie affected, may haue still force with mee, to stirre vp in mee the lyke. And for you; seeing God hath placed you as a Star in our Church, &amp; that right glorious▪ in your own Spheare; goe on, I beseech you, more &amp; more, to approach to your Father's light: that the losse which our Church hath sustayned by his removall, may be repared by you; and the setting of one Sunne, may bee the rysing of another. This shall be a part of the daylie prayer of

                  To the right worshipfull, D. Iohn Forbes, Preacher in Aberdene.
                  
                  WORTHIE SIR,
               
               HEaring of the happie death of your worthie Father, as I could not choose, but blesse God for it; yet can I not, but regrate the great losse I haue by it. With what a fatherly and tender affection did he embrace me, when first I receaved holie Orders, &amp; had a station neare to his? How happie was I vnder his governement, when shortlie after in God's mercie, for the good of His Church, he was advanced to the Sea of Aberdene. In my difficult service at Edinburgh, how oftē haue I bene refreshed with his pious &amp; prudent directions, and advice? And when latelie GOD brought me agayne to serue in these northerne parts, when in my journeyes, Northward and Southward, I had the happinesse to enjoy him, at his own house; what encouragements haue I had from him, in these

difficult tymes, to goe on in God and the king's service? Next to you, giue me leaue to say it, I haue reason to bemoane the losse of a Father. Yet non amisimus, sed praemisimus. And if anie thing be to be regrated, it is the losse the Church suffereth, and chiefelie hoc temporis articulo; that howsoever we haue a pious and gracious king, whom I pray God Allmightie to blesse with an happie and long Reygne; yet variis &amp; acerbis casibus concutitur. What might not be expected from him, who was Consulendo prudens, eloquendo facundus, &amp; agendo fortis?
               Hee is dead; yet shall ever liue in the myndes and memories of good men. The good order and peace established in his Diocesse, the flowrishing Reformation of the Universitie and Schools of Aberdene, the happinesse of both Citie and Towne of Aberdene, in a pious, learned, &amp; able Ministerie, the peace setled in the countrey, discutiendo humiliora negotia, his exemplar pietie at home, his fatherlie authoritie in his Sea, his fidelitie, wisdome, courage, and pietie, in acquyting himselfe as became a Prelate, Counsellor, &amp; States-man, will make his memorie blessed, with all who feare GOD, to the worldes ende.
               Suffer mee, a little, to solace both you and mee, by remembring what hee was, although my expression be short of his worth.

This, vnder GOD, was the worke of your happie Father, of blessed memorie; to whome succeeding ages are beholden for the same; and for the restitution of the Colledge, whollie ruinated, till it pleased GOD, to stirre him vp: as also in reviving the Episcopall Revenewes, in a farre better measure than hee found them. These workes, beside the great giftes given vnto him by GOD, speake yet for him, after his death. I professe, next vnto the conscience of my Calling, and the Commandement of GOD, his praeceeding example, doeth moue mee to an holie emulation, having succeeded to him in this Place. And I wish to GOD I had also succeeded to his Vertues. In this, GOD hath blessed you, qui es optimi patris, non degener filius. Your Sermons, Disputes, &amp; Conference, haue refreshed me. The LORD encrease His Graces, and crown them with Perseverance. Exspect from me, what in GOD I am able to performe. The Grace of GOD bee with you.
               
                  
                     Your Brother in the LORD, AD: ABERDENE.
                  Aberd.

               Letter of a Right Reverend Father in GOD, David Lyndsay, Bishop of Edinburgh; To Doctor Iohn Forbes of Corse.

                  RIGHT WORSHIPFULL,
               
               I Receaved your Letter: Ye shall assure your selfe, that what consisteth in my power, I will doe, to further your Right; both for your owne worth, and for your Father's sake of blessed Memorie, a learned, wyse, and a couragious Prelate; who in his lyfe was a mirrour of Pietie, Iustice, and Sobrietie: expressing in his action, what hee perswaded in his doctrine. I pray to GOD, that as yee haue begun, so yee may proceede, to walke in his foot-steppes: that so the want of him, may bee supplyed, to the glorie of GOD, the good of CHRIST'S Church, and the joye of vs, who had the happinesse to be his Friends, and Colleagues, whyle hee lived; and hope after this lyfe, to bee gathered with him, to possesse the Inheritance that our blessed Saviour, the LORD IESUS, hath promised, and purchased, by His Passion: To whose Grace, I haue you heartilie commended, and shall ever remayne

Huc accommodat Oecumenius in Cap. 1. ad Hebraeos, illam CHRISTI orationem ad PATREM; Et nunc glorifica me tu Pater apud temet-ipsumea gloria quam habui apud te priusquam mundus esset, IOANN. 17.5. Unde Ambrosius in enarratione hujus Psalmi;
Nec mirum (inquit) si unius sedis offertur filio consessus à Patre, qui unius est substantiae &amp; naturae cum Patre. Et Augustinus etiam in hunc Psal. respondens illi quaestioni DOMINI▪

Sed nos propter infirmitatem nostram quia caro desperata jacebamus, Verbum caro factus es, ut habitares in nobis. Ecce filius David. Certè tu in forma DEI cum esses, non rapinam arbitratus es esse aequalis DEO, ideo Dominus David: sed temetipsum exinanisti, formam servi accipiens, inde filius David. Denique &amp; in ipsa interrogatione tua, dicens, Quomodo filius ejus est, non te filium ejus negasti, sed modum in quo id fieret inquisisti. Ecce Virgo concipiet &amp; pariet filium, &amp; vocabunt nomen ejus EMMANUEL.

                  Ait enim beatus Apostolus; Quia Advocatum habemus

apud Patrem, IESVM CHRISTVM. IVDEX ergo est CHRISTVS, cum residet: ADVOCATVS est, cum assurgit. Iudex planè Iudaeis, Advocatus Christianis. Hic enim stans apud Patrem, Christianorum licet peccantium causas exorat: ibi residens cum Patre, Pharisaorum persequentium peccata condemnat. Illis indignans vehementer vlciscitur, his interveniens leniter miseretur. Hic stat, vt suscipiat Stephani Martyris spiritum: ibi residet, vt condemnet Iudae Proditoris admissum. Haec ibi Ambrosius.

                   Quod figmentum illa etiam ratio evidenter evertit, qua utitur Cyprianus ut Christianis timorem mortis excutiat; quia videlicet, solis reprobis hoc mora longiore confertur, ut cruciatus eorum &amp; gemitus interim differatur. Quod utique verum esse non posset, si alicui electo statim post mortem sustinendus esset cruciatus Purgatorii, ut somniant Papistae: quos idcirco mirum non est illibenter ac trepidantes mori,
                     Mors Papistarū horroris plena.

                  Aliud esse pro peccatis longo dolore cruciatum emendari, et purgari diu igni; aliud peccata omnia passione purgasse. Neque enim illis verbis loquitur Cyprianus de igne aliquo purgante post mortem corporalem, sed de dolore poenitentium in hac vita, quo tanquam igne cruciati purgantur. Non enim comparatio illic instituitur a Cypriano inter defunctos glorificatos, &amp; defunctos cruciatos; sed inter Martyres qui alacriter pro CHRISTI Nomine vitam suam ponunt, &amp; lapsos, ad poenitentiam admissos. Quod sic probo, 1. Ex verbis ipsius Cypriani eodem illo loco; Nec putes frater charissime, hinc aut virtutem fratrum minui, aut martyriae deficere, quod lapsis laxata sit poenitentia, &amp; quod poenitentibus spes pacis oblata. Manet verè fidentium robur immobile, &amp; apud timentes ac diligentes corde toto DEVM stabilis &amp; fortis perseverat integritas. Nam &amp; moechis à nobis poenitentiae tempus conceditur, &amp; pax datur, non tamen idcirco virginitas in Ecclesia deficit, aut continentiae propositum gloriosum per aliena peccata languescit. Floret Ecclesia tot virginibus coronata, &amp; castitas ac pudicitia tenorem gloriae suae servat, nec quia adultero poenitentia &amp; venia laxatur, continentiae vigor frangitur. Aliud est, ad veniam stare, aliud ad gloriam pervenire:
                  
                     Matth. 5. 
                  Aliud missum in carcerem non exire inde, donec solvat novissimum quadrantem;
                  1. Cor. 3. 
                  aliud statim fidei &amp; virtutis accipere mercedem: Aliud pro peccatis longo dolore cruciatum emundari, &amp; purgari diu igne; aliud peccata omnia passione purgasse. Haec ibi. 2. Eodem modo accipit atque interpretatur ignem illum (cujus mentio fit 1. COR. 3.

tribulationis in hac vita, ustio autem sit dolor de amissione rerum temporalium quo uri mavult poenitens, quam CHRISTO carere. Non autem intelligendum esse ignem illum Purgatorii quem imaginantur Papistae, vel illa una ratio manifestè evincit, quam adfert Augustinus loco citato: Ignis (inquit) de quo loquutus est eo loco Apostolus Paulus, talis debet intelligi, vt 
                        〈◊〉

Quo argumento etiam recedendum est ab Expositione Chrysostomi, qui in Commentario illius loci, ignem illum interpretatur ignem aeternum quo cruciantur damnati. 3. Perversam Pamelii glossam destruit constans Cypriani doctrina de requie &amp; laetitia in Paradiso, quam omnibus animabus fidelium dari ait quando hinc exeunt.

Quanto est majus, quanto fortius, quanto laudabilius ita credere vt se speret moriturus, sine fine victurum? Haec LAVS FIDEI non esset nec omnino fides esset, si homines in credendo proemiae visibiliae sequerentur; hoc est, si fidelibus merces immortalitatis in hoc seculo redderetur. Quandoquidem fides ita definita est; Fides est sperandorum substantia, &amp; convictio rerum quae non videntur.

                      propter peccatum quod commiserat eventura mala ex iracundia DEI comminaretur, confessione peccati veniam meruit, respondente Propheta, quòd illud ei flagitium facinus

                      remissum sit, &amp; tamen consequuta sunt quae DEVS fuerat comminatus, vt sic humiliaretur á filio. Quare &amp; hic non dicitur, si DEVS propter peccatum illud fuerat comminatus, cur dimisso peccato quod erat minatus implevit, nisi quia rectissimè, si sic dictum fuerit, respondebitur, remissionem illam peccati factam, ne homo à percipienda vita impediretur aeterna; subsequutum verò illius comminationis effectum, vt

PIETAS HOMINIS in illa humilitate EXERCERETVR ATQVE PROBARETVR? Sic &amp; mortem corporis propter hoc peccatum DEVS homini inflixit, &amp; post peccatorum remissionem PROPTER EXERCENDAM IVSTITIAM non ademit. Haec ibi.
               Ad eandem quaestionem idem Augustinus, Lib. 13. de Civitate DEI, Cap. 4. respondet in hunc modum; Ista quaestio in alio nostro opere tractata &amp; soluta est, vbi dictum est; Ad hoc relinqui animae experimentum separationis à corpore, quamvis ablato jam criminis nexu, quoniam si regenerationis Sacramentum continuo sequeretur immortalitas corporis, ipsa fides enervaretur, quae tunc est fides, quando expectatur in spe, quod in re nondum videtur, &amp;c.
               Idem alibi: Est autem fides nostra maximè discreta ab omni fide Gentilium in resurrectione mortuorum, Serm. 33. de verbis Apostoli.
               Atque haec de victoria illa dixisse sufficiat, qua per DOMINUM nostrum IESUM CHRISTUM, suorum nostrorumque hostium domitorem ac triumphatorem, superamus mortem in hac vita.

                  Eandem post hanc vitam eodem DOMINO donante vincimus tribus victoriae gradibus: Primo gradu victores constituimur mortis secundae quoad animam jam cum coelitibus beatam: licet corpus sub morte prima adhuc jaceat. Secundo gradu victoriam consequimur de morte corporis, per gloriosam resurrectionem; in qua resurrectione iterum CHRITVS tanquā suo resurget in corpore: ut pulchrè loquitur Ambrosius, Comment. primo in Cap. 17. Lucae. Tertio gradu de utraque morte aeternum triumphamus in Regno illo Coelesti, de quo DOMINUS noster in illo ultimo die illam ineffabilis consolationis plenissimam proferet sententiam, dicens

ovibus suis ad dexteram suam constitutis; Adeste benedicti Patris mei, possidete Regnum paratum vobis à jacto mundi fundamento, Matth. 25.34. Tunc fiet illud quod scriptum est; Absorpta est mors ad victoriam. Vbi tuus, ô mors, stimulus? Vbi tua, ô Sepulchrū
                   [vel ô Inferne, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ] victoria? Stimulus autē mortis est peccatum, vis autem peccati, Lex. Sed DEO sit gratia, qui dat nobis victoriam per DOMINVM nostrum IESVM CHRISTVM. 1. Cor. 15.54.55.56.57. Sicut praedixit DOMINUS per Prophetam Hoseam; E potestate Inferni [
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ] redimam eos, à morte redimam eos. Ero mors tua, O mors: Ero morsus tuus, Inferne. Poenitudo abscondetur ab oculis meis, Hoseae 13.14. Tunc perfectè implebitur quod praedixit Esaias Propheta; Perdet mortem in sempiternum, &amp; absterget DOMINVS IEHOVA lachrymam ab omni facie: &amp; opprobrium populi sui auferet ab universa terra, Esaiae 25.8.
               Quid igitur dicemus ad haec? Respondet Apostolus; Si DEVS pro nobis, quis contra nos?
                  
                     Si DEVS pro nobis, quis contra nos?

                     um, quomodo non etiam cum eo omnia nobis gratificabitur? Quis intentabit crimina adversus electos DEI? DEVS est qui justificat: Quis est qui condemnet? CHRISTVS qui mortuus est, imo vero qui etiam suscitatus est: qui etiam est ad dextram DEI:
                  
                     CHRISTVS est ad dextram DEI, interpellant pro nobis.
                   
                  qui etiam interpellat pro nobis. Quis nos separabit à charitate CHRISTI? Num afflictio, num angustia, num persecutio, num fames, num nuditas, num periculum, num gladius? (sicut scriptum est, Tui causa occidimur totum diem: reputati sumus velut oves destinatae mactationi) Imo in his omnibus amplius quam victores sumus [
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ] per eum qui dilexit nos. Nam mihi persuasum est, neque mortem, neque vitam, neque Angelos, neque Principatus, neque Potestates, neque praesentia, neque futura, neque sublimitatem,

neque profunditatem, neque vllam rem aliam creatam, posse nos separare à charitate DEI, qua est in CHRISTO IESV,

Et memoratam responsionem prorsus invictam &amp; triumphalem.

                   quam dissimiliter animo affectus fuisset in isto morbo qui ei mortem intra paucos dies attulit, ac in alio quodam morbo quem ante paucos annos minari sibi interitum existimabat: nam in priore illo usque adeo consternatus timore mortis aestuabat ac trepidabat, ut non sine lachrymis ac suspiriis de propinquo (ut putabat) obitu suo loqueretur: Cum autem, DEI Beneficio, ex illo morbo revaluisset, die mortis triennium circiter prolongato, &amp; aegritudine postmodū hac mortifera correptus decumberet, visenti mihi professus est ultro sine ullo fletu aut gemitu, perjucundum sibi fore si quamprimùm DEUS illum ex hac vita ad se-ipsum transferret: Cujus voti intra paucos dies compos foeliciter factus est.

                  , non obstante illa qua premebatur paralysi, Charissimam Filiam suam Vniversitatem Aberdoniensem (quam marcore longo extabescentem &amp; situ informi squalentem sanitati ac nitori pristino, instaurator foelix, restituerat) extremûm invisens, manibus gestantium in auditorium portatus, veneranda sua praesentia condecoravit. Materiam igitur eam mihi deligendam existimavi quae &amp; illi Parentis mei conditioni maximè esset accommodata, &amp; Theologo imprimis digna, &amp; auditorio vtilitatem juxta ac voluptatem longè vberrimam allatura videbatur. Praecipuè verò vt hoc argumentum illo praesertim tempore tractandum assumerem, vehemens animi impulit ardor, quo solandi atque exhilarandi pientissimum illud ac mitissimum pectus Charissimi genitoris mei, senio simul &amp; morbo gravati, &amp; accersitionem sui de hoc seculo in horas praestolantis, flagrantissimè rapiebar. Neque voto successus defuit, nam ille attentas, vt solebat, aures praebens, ad primum Visionis Beatificae auditum, vsque adeo per DEI gratiam exultavit spiritu, vt veluti novis collectis viribus sese ad audiendum mira alacritate componeret. Et quam impensè Beatificae Visionis meditatione delectaretur, frequentibus postea inter nos colloquiis, ad extremum vsque spiritum luculenter ostendit.
               Vt autem Dissertationem hanc nunc publici juris facerem, his adductus sum rationibus.
               
                  1. Hoc olim solamine Patriarcha David maerorem suum de filioli morte conceptum leniebat, quod ad defunctum iturus esset. Et Ambrosius obitu fratris sui Satyri contristatus se hac spe solabatur, quod citò ad fratrem suum venturus esset, nec digressus inter illos longa essent futurae divortia, &amp; ipse cum fratre inter Angelorum consortia, propediem futurus. Hac ipsa Patrem meum apum CHRISTVM videndi spe me recreo atque sustento.

                  fectio solatio esse non posset, nisi illos miseriis exemptos, Coelestibus jam potiri gaudiis crederemus. Quae gaudia quo clariùs praevisa, &amp; certiùs animo praecepta, &amp; frequentiùs atque accuratiùs menti repraesentata fuerint, eo mirabiliores sui amores in nobis excitabunt.
               
                  2. Ea etiam est praesentis seculi, vtcunque aerumnosi, illecebrosa fallacia, &amp; perniciosa blanditia, vt altioris remigio contemplationis opus sit, quo mentes nostras coenosis degravatas affectibus humo revellere, &amp; ad verae beatitudinis domicilium altollere valeamus. Torporem igitur hunc &amp; exitiabilem inertiam quo faciliùs excutiamus, &amp; ea quae DEI sunt, non autem quae mundi hujus sunt, libenter &amp; continenter sapiamus, haud exiguo per DEI gratiam adjumento (vt hactenus mihi fuit) ita post hac tibi et mihi futuram confido istam quam exhibemus Beatificae Visionis meditationem▪ Dicebat, memini, PATER meus,

Idcirco omnia in vnam congesta lancem (sequestrato DEI cultu qui altioris est ordinis) non modo vana, sed ipsam asseruit esse vanitatem, aut si quid cogitari potest vanitate vanius, vt hoc designaret, omnia quae sub Sole fiunt vanitatem vanitatum esse pronunciavit.

               Hieronymi verba sunt (apud Augustinum Epist. 111.) Videre DEVM sicuti est in natura sua, oculus hominis non potest. Non solum homo, nec Angeli, nec Throni, nec Potestates, nec Dominationes, nec omne nomen quod nominatur: Neque enim creatura potest aspicere Creatorem suum. Et alibi (in Cap. 1. Esaiae) Homo igitur DEI faciem videre non potest.

                  Quia secundùm

apertissimam DOMINI sententiam, etiam ipse sentit tunc nos visuros faciem DEI, cum in Angelos profecerimus, id est, aequales Angelis facti fuerimus, quod erit vtique in resurrectione mortuorum. DEINDE. Apostolico testimonio satis apparuit,
                  2. 
                  non exterioris, sed interioris hominis faciem intelligendam, cum videbimus facie ad faciem. Dicit velamen super cor Iudaeorum positum esse, vt ostendat cordis faciem nobis esse revelatam, velamine ablato. Quod autem dixit Hieronymus faciem DEI juxta naturae Divinae proprietatem à nulla videri creatura,
                     Augustinianae expositio verborum Hieronymi.
                   id Augustinus refert ad corporales aspectus etiam Angelicos. Verum quia satis durum est spiritibus illis Coelestibus oculos tribuere corporales, juvabit audire hac de re disserentes Ambrosium, (in Cap. 1. Lucae) &amp; Chrysostomum, (homil. 15. in Evang. Ioannis) &amp; ipsum alibi Augustinum (Epist. 112.)
               Ambrosius dictum illud Ioannis Evangelistae, DEVM nemo vidit vnquam:
                  
                     Ambros.
                   ad ipsas etiam Coelestes virtutes &amp; Potestates extendit, quod DEUM nunquam viderint: idque in hunc modum explicat; Et ideo DEVM nemo vidit vnquam, quia eam quae in DEO habitat plenitudinem Deitatis, nemo conspexit, nemo mente aut oculis compraehendit. VIDIT ergo ad vtrumque referendum est. Denique cum additur, Unigenitus Filius ipse enarravit, mentium magis quam oculorum visio declaratur. Species enim videtur, virtus vero enarratur, illa oculis, haec mente compraehenditur. Quae Ambrosii verba considerans Augustinus (Epist. 112. Cap. 9.) Aliud est (inquit) videre, aliud est totum videndo compraehendere. Quandoquidem id videtur quod praesens vtcunque sentitur. Totum autem compraehenditur videndo quod ita videtur, vt nihil ejus lateat videntem, aut eujus fines circumspici possunt. Posterior

ista compraehensio DEI nulli est possibilis creaturae, vt cap. 8. ejusdem Epist. docebat August.

                   Visionem tamen DEI sicuti est, (quae etiam Apostolo compraehensio latiore sensu dicitur, PHILIP. 1.) nobis promittit Sacra Scriptura, quando in Angelos profecerimus. Proinde (inquit ibi Augustinus) narrante vnigenito qui est in sinu Patris, narratione ineffabili, creatura rationalis munda &amp; sancta impletur visione DEI ineffabili, quam tum consequemur, cum aequales Angelis facti fuerimus. Et cap. 15.

                         visione DEI
                   
                  Desiderium veraciter piorum (inquit August. Epist. 112. Cap. 8.) quo videre DEVM cupiunt, &amp; inhianter ardescunt, non in eam speciem contuendā flagrat, qua vt vult apparet quod ipse non est, sed in eam substantiam qua ipse est quod est.
                  
                     Exod. 33. 
                  Hujus enim desiderii sui flammam sanctus Moyses fidelis famulus ejus ostendit, vbi ait DEO, cum quo ut amicus facie ad faciem loquebatur, Si inveni gratiam apud te, ostende mihi temet ipsum. Quid ergo? Ille non erat ipse? Si non esset ipse, non diceret, Ostende mihi temet ipsum, sed ostende mihi DEVM: &amp; tamen si ejus naturam substantiamque conspiceret, multominus diceret, Ostende mihi temet ipsum. Ipse ergo erat in ea specie qua apparere voluerat, non autem ipse apparebat in natura propria quam Moyses videre cupiebat. Ea quippe promittitur Sanctis in alia vita. Vnde quod responsum est Moysi, verum est, Quia nemo potest faciem DEI videre, &amp; vivere; id est, nemo potest eum in hac vita vivens videre sicuti est. Et postea eodem libro, cap. 11. In illo (inquit) Regno vbi eum videbunt Filii ejus sicuti est. Tum quippe satiabitur in bonis desiderium eorum, quo desiderio flagrabat Moyses, cui loqui ad DEVM facie ad faciem non sufficiebat, &amp; dicebat, Ostende mihi temet ipsum manifestè, vt videam te, tanquam diceret quod in Psalmo ex eodem desiderio canitur, Satiabor cum manifestabitur gloria tua.
                     Psal. 17. Beatitudo.
                   
                  Beatitudo (inquit Bonaventura in 4m Sent. Dist. 49. Art. 1. Quaest. 1.

in resolutione) est sinis satians nostrum appetitum:
                  
                     Beatus
                   
                  Beatus non est, (ait August. lib. 13. de Trinitate, cap. 5.) nisi qui &amp; habet omnia quae vult, &amp; nihil vult malè. Haec ille. Desiderium igitur videndi DEI essentiam sicuti est, piis mentibus à DEO inditum, non erit inane, sed satiabitur.
               Alia ratio est, quam adferunt Thomas &amp; Scotus. Thomae verba sunt (in 4. Sent. Dist. 49. Quaest. 2. Art. 1.2. Ratio pro immediata Visione Dei.
                  ) Si in perfectissima operatione intellectus, homo non perveniat ad videndam essentiam Divinam,
                  
                     Thom.
                   
                  
                     
                        •
                     d aliquid aliud: opportebit dicere quod aliquid aliud est beatificans ipsum hominem quam DEVS. Et cum vltima perfectio cujuslibet sit in conjunctione ad suum principium, sequitur, vt aliquid aliud sit principium effectivum hominis, quam DEVS, quod est absurdum.
               
               Scotus (in 4. Sent. Dist. 49. Quaest. 2.) similiter Philosophatur;
                     Scot.
                   naturam scilicet intellectualem (cum sit suprema perfectibilis natura) non habere vltimam suam perfectionem &amp; beatitudinem nisi in supremo perfectivo extrinseco, non essendo illud realiter, nec habendo illud formaliter sibi inhaerens, sed attingendo illud, &amp; sic habendo modo sibi possibili habendi. Nullam perfectionem intrinsecam beatorum esse beatitudinem, nisi pro quanto immediatè conjungit perfectivo extrinseco, quod est objectum beatificum.

Viatores per fidem incedimus, non per aspectum (2. Cor. 5.7.) Non est de DEO (inquit Hilarius) humanis judiciis sentiendum: neque enim nobis ea natura est, vt se in coelestem cognitionem suis viribus efferat. A DEO discendum est, quid de DEO intelligendum sit, quia non nisi se autore cognoscitur.

                  quae est ipsa Deiformitas, &amp; satietas. Haec tamen Deiformitas non in similitudine DEI objectiva consistit, seu specie intelligibili DEVM repraesentante, sed in ipsa operatione seu visione, qua mens DEVM videndo attingit eiue immediatè conjungitur. Nam (vt monet Thomas in 3. Sent. Dist. 14. Quaest. 1. Art. 3. &amp; Quaest. 2. Art. 1.) omnis intellectus creatus qui videt essentiam DEI, videt eam sine aliqua mediante similitudine: qui autem cognoscit DEVM per similitudinem aliquam, sive impressam, sive a rebus acceptam, non videt essentiam DEI: sed ad hoc quod videat DEVM oportet vt ipsa DEI essentia conjungatur intellectui vt forma qua cognoscit determinatè.

               Respondeo;
                     Responsio. Singulare miraculum fuit quod CHRISTVS simul viater esset &amp; compraehensor.
                   
                  CHRISTVS solus simul Viator &amp; Compraehensor, habuit simul bona viae quaedam, vt gratiae plenitudinem; &amp; bona Patriae, vt non posse peccare, &amp; DEI perfectam contemplationem; &amp; quaedam etiam mala viae, vt afflictiones, &amp; mortalitatem: vt rectè monet Petrus Lombardus, lib. 3. Sent. Dist. 16. Verum est (inquit ibi BONAVENTVRA) quod beatitudo miseriae opponitur secundùm legem communem, &amp; non reperitur in aliquo simul gloria cum miseria. Et ratio hujus est, quia vnusquisque est in vno statu, non in duplici: sed quoniam CHRISTVS in duplici statu erat, vel quasi rationem tenebat duplicis personae; sicut in CHRISTO status est compossibilis statui, sine repugnantia, sic beatitudo cum miseria.

                   ibidem dicit BONAVENTVRA; Fuisse in anima CHRISTI, secundùm eandem potentiam, &amp; secundùm eundem statum potentiae, dolorem &amp; gaudium, ita vt nec dolor superveniens discontinuaverit gaudium, sed simul fuerit; nec iterum (quod majus est) dolor intensus valdè, fecerit gaudium esse minùs perfectum. Dolorem autem illum, &amp; gaudium in CHRISTO, non habuisse contrarietatem, sed vnum fuisse materiale respectu alterius, &amp; ideo simul eidem inesse potuisse, quia ex hoc ipso CHRISTVS gaudebat in DOMINO, quo sentiebatse pati &amp; dolore pro DOMINO. Sicut etiam in vero poenitente videmus, quod simul doleat, &amp; de dolore gaudeat. Haec BONAVENTVRA, in 3. Sent. Dist. 16. Art. 2. Quaest. 2. Sic THOMAS de eodem CHRISTI dolore eodemue gaudio disserens; Qui tamen (inquit) dolor erat quodam modo materia gaudii fruitionis, in quantum gaudium illud se extendebat ad omnia illa quae appraehenduntur vt DEO placita. Et sic patet quod dolor qui erat in anima CHRISTI nullo modo gaudium fruitionis impediebat, neque per modum contrarietatis, neque per modum redundantiae, &amp;c. Haec THOMAS, in 3. Sent. Dist. 15. Quaest. 2. Art. 3.
               Fuit hoc in CHRISTO speciale miraculum quod gloria animae non statim redundaverit in corpus,
                     Miraculum impediens impassilitatem, qua alioqui fuisset in primo instante unionis.
                   sed fuerit aliquamdiu mortale, &amp; quod cum Visione Beatifica dolorem passa sit ipsa ejus anima; vt rectè observat SCOTVS, in 3. Sent. Dist. 16. Quaest. 2. Num. 5. Et Dist. 18. Quaestione vnica, Num. 15. vbi ait; Gloria &amp; impassibilitas corporis &amp; animae infuissent CHRISTO in primo instante vnionis, nisi per miraculum fuissent prohibita. Et paulò post, ait CHRISTVM affectione justitiae fuisse summè conjunctum fini, ita vt nullo modo posset injustè velle

vel peccare, attamen quoad affectionem commodi,
                  
                     Nota distinctionem inter affectionem justitiae, &amp; affectionem commodi.
                   nondum fuisse summè conjunctum, sed potuisse aliquid pati contra affectionem commodi, &amp; illud CHRISTUM potuisse ordinatè velle, &amp; acceptare, &amp; ita mereri: secus ac se habet in aliis beatis, quibus nullum occurrit in Patria objectum, quod affectione commodi, tanquam sibi incommodum aversentur, &amp; affectione justitiae meritoria amplectantur, ideoque sunt jam prorsus extra statum merendi. Non sic olim CHRISTUS qui secundùm aliquid,
                     Qui non est Vihtor▪ non est in statu merendi.
                   fuit in statu Via

Nunc autem, postquam Viator esse desiit, cessante miraculo illo quod corporis &amp; animae impassibilitatem impediebat, non est amplius in statu merendi; vt monet THOMAS, Part. 3. Quaest. 19. Art. 3. ad primum.
               Passiones illae CHRISTI temporariae non constituebant miserum, nam erant etiam voluntariae,
                     CHRISTVS in mediis miseriis non miser, sed beatus, licet conflictans cum miseriis.
                   &amp; meritoriae, &amp; materia gaudii: ideoue Visionis Beatificae laetitiam non impediebant, non minuebant: vnde stat assertio nostra, de tertio gradu invisibilitatis; DEVM non vident miseri. Et quod diximus, Fugari visione hac omnem miseriam, id intelligendum est, de lege communi, nisi beatitatis hujus redundantia, quae omnem prorsus excluderet miseriam, per miraculum impediatur, quemadmodum in CHRISTO ad tempus contigit.

Quamvis enim anima CHRISTI, &amp; omnis beata anima, videat totam essentiam DEI, quia tamen efficacia intellectus creati videntis DEUM, non adaequatur objecto quod videtur, ideo etsi videt totam DEI essentiam, (quippe quae impartibilis est) non tamen eam totaliter videt;
                     Anima CHRISTI, &amp; omnis anima beata, videt totam DEI essentiam, sed non totalit
                           •
                        r.
                   id est, ita vt visibilitas objecti non excedat modum videntis, sed videns ita perfectè videat, sicut res perfectè visibilis est. Nullus enim intellectus creatus potest essentiam DEI totaliter videre: quia ejus efficacia non est tanta in intelligendo, quanta est veritas sive claritas Divinae Essentiae secundùm quam visibilis est: Quod solius Divini est intellectus: &amp; ideo ipse solus seipsum totaliter cognoscit; vt accuratè atque appositè argumentatur THOMAS, loco citato.
               
                  
                     Visionis beatisicae delectabilis plenitudo.
                  Beati plenitudinem Divinae Essentiae non compraehendunt secundùm perfectionem objecti quod videtur; DEUM tamen vident perfectè in vltima perfectione videntium. Nullus in viso terminus, nullus videnti defectus. Manet in nobis gaudium DOMINI nostri,
                     Ioann. 11.11 etiam in agone adhuc constitutis: quanto magis in statu gloriae permanebit in nobis in secula feculorum?
                     Matth. 25.11. Attamen non dicit DOMINUS servo bono &amp; fideli, intret in te gaudium meum: quamvis intimos animi recessus penetret ineffabilis illa laetitia: sed, Intra in gaudium DOMINI tui. Nam sicut aves in aërem, &amp; pisces in oceanum, ita in aeternum illum gaudium intrant beati, eoue implentur, licet ejus immensitatem non compraehendant, fed ab ea potiùs compraehendantur.2a 2ae

At ex parte rei, de qua gaudetur, cum illud sit plenum gaudium quo de ea gaudetur pro dignitate ipsius rei, ita vt rei dignitatem gaudium adaequet; hoc sensu solum DEI Ipsius gaudium esse plenum de se ipso, quia solum gaudium DEI est infinitum, &amp; infinitae bonitati DEI aequale. Quia autem nulla creatura est capax gaudii de DEO ei condigni; inde esse quod istud gaudium omnino plenum non capiatur in homine, sed potiùs homo intret in ipsum; secundùm illud MATTH. xxv. Intra in gaudium DOMINI tui. Haec THOMAS, 2a 2ae Quaest. 28. Art. 3. in corpore articuli.
               Nullum est visionis hujus taedium: sed perfecta atque indefessa delectatione ac plenitudine in infinito inexhaustae beatitudinis oceano semper deliciantur beati Spiritus. Vident semper, &amp; videre desiderant, sine anxietate desiderant, &amp; sine fastidio satiantur.

                     Quibus negatur, ii sunt infoelicissimi.
                   
                  Illa namque visio DEI (inquit AVGVST.) tantae pulchritudinis visio est, &amp; tanto amore dignissima, vt sine hac quibuslibet aliis bonis praeditum atque abundantem non dubitet Plotinus infoelicissimum dicere. Haec AVGVST. Lib. 10. de Civitate DEI, Cap. 16.

            SI quid ab ingenio liceat sperare, vel vsus
            
                Addere; si vigiles curae, labor improbus, aegram
            Sollicitare queant crudeli vulnere mentem;
            Sive quis Ausonio plectro, fidibusue canoris,
            
                Aut Graio tonet ore potens, fandive peritus
            Sermones referat quos infans audiit orbis:
            Hîc sese accincti sistant; hôc carmine vires
            Intendant mecum socias: moestaue cupresso
            Praesulis incingant feralia busta: supremi
            
                Temporis officium sic admonet; ille molestis
            Liber agit curis, exoptatamue quietem
            Attigit; haud tacitis hoc immedicabile damnum
            Quaestibus, elapsum compresso transeat ore.
            At non Castalios latices, Ephyraea fluenta
            
                Poscere fas animo; non Cyrrham perue sonantem
            Flectere Pernassum gressus: hinc cuncta prophana
            
               Arceo: sit mihi dux magno qui praesidet orbi;
            Ille hominum pecudumue sator, sator ille volucrū,
            Aeolii qui flabra noti, tumidasue procellas
            Temperat, &amp; rapidi sternit vada concita Nerei.
            Grampiacis devexa jugis loca, frigida coelo,
            
            Difficiliue solo, septem subjecta trioni;
            Unde vel Eridani nescit vel flamma Canopi
            Conspicier, saevit campis vbi Caurus apertis,
            Quis putet herois tanti natalibus omnem
            Ponè Caledoniam liquisse; hinc divite vena 
            
            Illuxisse orbi ingenium mirabile, cunas
            Hos habuisse lares, surgens vbi proxima coelo
            Marria, (robustis laudata &amp; foeta colonis)
            Piniferas aperit rupes; mitescere sensim
            Incipiens, terras Cereri camposue relinquit,
            
            Quam Dea praecingens, rapido petit aequora cursu,
            Limpidus, illimis, puro liquidissimus amne.
            Cardine sed Boreae foelicia rura pererrat
            Dona, recurvatis ludens per gramina ripis.
            Sic te Dalmatici montes Hieronyme; sic te,
            
            Qui Buchanane feris sublimi sidera plectro,

            Nomina, quae propriis tantum debentur alumnis.
            
            Iam si nobilitas placeat, si stemmata famae
            In censum veniant, claris majoribus, illis
            Haud indignum atavis, haud inferioribus ausis,
            (Nil opus acciri falsae praeconia linguae)

            Iura supergressam factis audacibus, omni
            Cum procerum coetu stupuit rex maximus, vnde
            
               PATRICIVS collatus honos: nec nupera facta
            
               Hoc peperere decus, longis annalibus ista
            Credita sunt, secli veteris melioribus annis.
            Sic neque degeneres sese ostendere nepotes,
            Armatas acies campis immittere, ferro
            Exercere manus ausi, civilibus armis
            
                Tisiphone nostras quateret cum barbara vires.
            At postquam arctois fulsit regionibus astrum
            Pacificum, cujus praesens reverentia bellum
            Depulit, atque faces belli, Mars impius orbe
            
                Exulat è nostro, peregrinas vectus ad oras.
            Hoc fatis IACOBE tuis regum optime debet
            Pacis hyperboreae vinclum, pax reddita nobis.
            Sic posita feritate omnes mansuevimus, omnes
            Diversis agimur studiis, sua cuiue voluptas.
            Pars Themidis streperiue fori subsellia tentat:
            
                Pars Phariis numeris vigilat, magniue recursus
            Explorare poli: veteris pars dogmata Coi
            Indagare senis, juvat ars ex arte medendi:
            Hi sua rura colunt, validisue ligonibus instant.
            Oceanus placet his; per stagna immensa profundi
            
                Consectantur opes, nec terrent proxima lethi.
            Et non exiguus populus, quem taedia vitae
            Otiaue exagitanr, cupidè nova praelia poscens
            Exulat, atque aliis Martem vestigat in oris,
            At non FORBESIO stadio decurrere tali
            
                Fert animus; dura placitum sudare palaestra.
            Ergo cupita sibi indicens certamina, nulla
            Tempora, nil nimium procrastinat, incitus, ardens,
            Legibus obsequitur quos dixerat ipse; profunda
            
                Hinc probitas gemina diffusa propagine sanctum
            Altius impellit pectus; natura ministrat
            Et consuetudo duplici munimine vires.
            Nil quod dedeceat factum: morum integer, aevi
            Integer: innocuis vix laxat frena juventae
            
               Deliciis, canus studiis lanugine prima:
            Atque inclinati reparator plurimus aevi.
            Rara quies, comis gravitas, tranquilla serenae
            Temperies frontis, parcis dapibusque, profundo
            Nunquam mersa mero sunt pocula, nulla prophanis 
            
            Gratia convivis, castus sermonibus, asper
            Et castigator tristis peccantis amici.
            Non animo indulsit sectari Heliconia serta:
            Displicuitue comis necti Phoebeia laurus.
            Et dedignatus Themidis fora, Paeonis artes,
            Nec Chaldaeorum damnata scientia cordi est.
            
            Sed vegetum ingenium regerens ad originis altae
            Semina, coelestûm vetera ad primordia rerum
            Fert avidos passus, animoue oculisue salutis
            Autorem agnoscens, coelo defixus inerrat.
            Et labefacta gemens pietatis germina; laxis 
            
            Moribus indomito pereuntia secula luxu,
            Hinc caligantes sensus, mentisue veternum,
            Et libertatis quaesito nomine certum
            Exitium, serpente malo, crescente ruina,
            Indoluit miseris, sacrisue operarier infit.
            
            Primaue cura fuit divini nectaris haustu
            Perfudisse lares; mox proxima limina sacrae
            Aedis inexhaustae senserunt fulmina linguae.
            Ac veluti occulto quae fulvi vena metalli
            Monte latet, vel quae nescitur clausa profundo 
            
            Gemma mari, nullos hominum poscuntur in vsus:
            Eruta diversis ludunt, capiuntue figuris.
            Talis erat, nondum curis immissus apertis,
            Divitiis opulens tacitis, tectoue metallo.
            Agnitus extractus placuit, penitusue probatum 
            
            Ambitiosus honos nulla ambitione peritus
            Consequitur, sacer ordo premit, celsiue fatigat
            Imperii diadema tenens; communia vota
            
               Contulit haud tacitum justa ad suffragia vulgus.
            Infula sacra sacris manibus collata, decoram
            Canitiem velat; sed non hic limes honorum
            Constitit, ille artes atque haud vulgariter artes
            
                Edoctus princeps, quibus est Respublica sospes,
            Addidit augusti fastigia celsa senatus:
            Arbitrium patuit rerum, penetralibus altis
            Curia suscepitque lubens; arcanaque regni
            Cum patribus consors consortibus ardua tractat.
            Non tamen ingenium (tanta est constantia) cedit
            
                Dulcibus illecebris, aut pondere victa laborat
            Ignea vis animi, curis gravioribus impar.
            Et quanquam illicibus certaret curia fallax
            Obsequiis tentare gradus, non fulgor honorum
            Emollit rigidum &amp; non exorabile pectus.
            
                Illius infixum cordi, placet vna voluptas
            Excubias agitare gregi, vigilantia semper
            Lumina, custodes oculos praetendere: si quem
            Devius error agat, reducem mox sistere; si quid
            Collapsum offendat mox instaurare; labori

            Iudicii trutinans examine; pellere segnes,
            Emeritos donis meritisque ornare trophaeis.
            At non illa meae pavidae constantia mentis,
            Ut te digna canat, (magni haec sunt munia vatis,

                Quae sint! FORBESÎ sunt monumenta patris,
            Nobilibus qui natus avis, non degener, ipse
            Ante alios meruit nobilitare genus:
            Cui Solomon exemplar erat, qui sacra caducis
            Antetulit sophiae jura cupidinibus.
            Nam cum forte Viro fundus superesset avitus,
            
               PATRICIOque satis vivere more daret:
            Tempsit opes, titulosque leves, Pastorque vocari
            Maluit, (ô Proceres!) atque vocare sacris.
            Tanto pavit oves studio, Babylonis vt inde
            Terruerit rapidos cum meretrice lupos.
            
               Non sic Inachiae centeno lumine vaccae
            Servavit gressus Argus, vt ille gregem.
            Foelix vsque DEAE, foelix fuit accola DONAE
            Flexanimo quoties hausit ab ore sonos,
            Aut quoties justâ librantem facta bilance
            Dicentemque suis jura videre fuit,

            Novit, &amp; in fastis connumerata tenet.
            Hunc ea lux memorat BONA qua CONCORDIA discors
            Ipsa minansque sibi conciliata sibi est:
            Nec tacet illa dies sacro celebranda Lyceo
            Quâ reditus auxit Palladiumque chorum;
            Progeniemque suam Iovis alitis obtulit instar,
            Vis cui Phoebaeum sustinuisse jubar:
            Non fuerat satis hoc, aris servire parentem,
            Arte sed &amp; soboles erudienda pari:
            Quis Phoebo Phaëtonta parem, parilique rotatum
            Axe, per Arctoas crederet îsse plagas?
            Occidit ille tamen! Virtus si nescia fari est,
            Non conclamandus quam prius orbis erat.
            Occidit! Est ea lex natis adnata, nec vlli
            Fit Genitrix, cui non sit Libitina, Venus,
            At quae fata negant, Superorum gratia praestat,
            Et pompâ instaurant funus inocciduâ.
            Spiritus ipse DEI supremas colligit auras,
            Pollinctorque lavat FILIUS ipse DEI.
            Iustitiaeque toga praetexit corpora pura,
            Curat &amp; efferri sic decorata domo.

            Non illum claudunt ferratae limina mortis,
            Coelestes animos nec libitina capit:
            Spiritus aetherius Patrium remeavit Olympum,

               Repay their Tribute to the Maine,
               The ratling murmures of their course,
               Proclaimes their debt, and yet in vaine,
               For there, how soone they hyde their heads,
               Their luster's gone, their Douceur fades.
            
            
               When Brydegroomes from their chambers come,
               To wed the Virgine Nymphes of May,
               
                  The Violet, and Prymrose bloome,
               Len wreaths, and Lawrels, to that play.
               But if or hee or shee shall fall,
               Their mirth's exchanged to a Madrigall.
            
            
               So whilst our Aaron's burning Light,
               In Vrim and in Thummim shynd,
               Our Levits saw their Day, no Night,
               For Atho's Shaddows still declynde.
               But now in Ramah Aaron sleepes,
               And Rachel for her Husband weepes.
            
            
               So whilst our Aarons Priestlie Rod
               Did bud, did blossome, and yeelde fruit,
               
                  Ieshuruns other stemmes abroad,
               Proov'd withred stickes, and wanted root:
               But now hee sleepes, and gainst his Vyne,
               And Oliue, Brambles now repyne.
            
            
               So when our Aaron's boundlesse Ocean,
               Lent secret lyfe, to Sacred Springes,
               
                  Rephidims Rocke by that commotion,
               Did drench Vrania's scorched winges:
               But whilst his deepes exhawled lye,
               
                  Cherith's exhaust, and Kedron's dry.
            
            
               So whilst our pompous Aaron stood,
               To wed the Bryde to her Brydegroome,
               The Friends rejoyc'd, the Virgines bowde,
               And both vnto the Wedding come:
               But now, the PARANYMPH is gone,
               And all the marriage Children moane.
            
            
               What then? haue not Aire, Earth, and Seas,
               
               Spent teares at ARON'S funerall?
               
                  They haue: But teares so dround their eyes,
               That now their deepest griefes recall
               Their sluces: and to tymes to come,
               Say, Light cares speake, when deepe grief's dumbe.

            DEDICATED To the Never-dying Memorie of The late Right Revend, Learned▪ and Religious Prelate, my best Friend, And most worthie Macenas, PATRICKE, BY THE MERCIE OF GOD, BISHOP OF ABERDENE, &amp;c.
            WAlking alone, vnder a shade, neare by a River syde,
            
            Beholding how swift silent streams into the Sea did slyde,
            The budding Groue, our youth, streames, tymes velocitie,
            Floods falling in the Sea, declar'd all living flesh must die.
            Whiles thus as in a trance, I viewed the welkin cleare,
            Vnto my eyes and eares, at once od objects did appeare.
            
               I heard great tolling Bels, drums toucke, dead trumpets sounded,
            Canons loude roaring, made such noyse, Earth, Sea, and Aire resoūded.
            But that which mov'd me most, I saw me neare hand by,
            Great multitudes of mourning men, full sadlie seem'd to cry:
            Some said, Now IACOB'S gone, our PATRIARCH who bred vs.
            Som lik Aegiptiās mourning, cryd, Our Ioseph's faild, who fed vs:
            Some for myld Moses moand, evē those who most did grieue him;
            Praying, if possibe it were, their vowes might now revive him.
            Some for their DAVID dool'd, most for the Temple grat:
            Some for IOSIAS shouted in the Valley of Iosaphat.
            
            Their doole redoubled so, their cryes became confusde,
            That Natures workes all round about was stupified, and musde.
            The tallest trembling Trees, whose statelie tops vpryse,
            And seem'd through watrie voults of aire, to cut the crystal Skyes,
            Did lowre and lout them lowe, as witnesse of those wronges;
            
               Elf-Echoe out of hollow Caues, resounds their sorrowing songs.
            The Clowds did cease to drop, the wavering windes to blow;
            The boughs on banks left off to bloome, the Seas to fall or flow:
            The sweetest stirring streames, that run in DEE and DONE,
            Shout to their equals, Stay your pace, &amp; help vs two to mone.
            
            The birds with chirming cheare, that cut the azure Skyes,
            They cease to sing, the beasts to low, the fish to swimme in Seas:
            The Sunne and Moone amaz'd, and Starres, all still they stand,
            And all IOVES hudge and curious worke, the sea, the aire, the land,
            Left off their kindlie course, and car'd with me to ken,
            About a Tombe what moved to mourne so manie modest men.
            Thus whilst agast wee gaz'd, three out amongst the laue,
            In doricke nūbers sadlie sounds these Songs about his Graue.
            
               1. SONG.
               SWeete Sheepherds Swanes, awake and weepe,
               Since hee is gone, who made you sleepe:
               
                  Wee want our gracious Governour,
               Who watch'd vs both in Field and Towre.
               Now may wee stray without a Guyde;
               In earth there is none such besyde.
               Great paines Hee tooke, to make vs keepe,
               To feede, to fence, our wandring Sheepe▪
               
               All our defects Hee cur'd and cover'd,
               Which Doggs and Wolfes would haue discover'd.
               And now, no doubt, wee'll goe astray,
               Since wee Him want who led our way.
               The crasde and creeple oft Hee heal'd them;
               The comfortlesse Hee never failde them.
               Our EAGLE who vs taught to flie;
               Our PELICAN, our PHOENIX, hie;
               Great IOVA Grant, since Hee is gone,
               His ashes breede vs such a One.
            
            
               2. SONG.
               OVr Church hath lost a Light, our State may now bemoane;
               Our Common-wealth, her Atlas wants, Relligion a sonne,
               His blood amongst the best, as borne so was Hee bred,
               But what were those, if grace divine, had not Dame Nature clad?
               If Learning joyn'd with Wit, if Grace with Gravitie;
               If prudent carriage bee in pryce, if matchlesse Modestie,
               Then, in a word, I vow, if Vertue lodg'd below,
               Hee was the worthiest wight for one, my selfe did ever know:
               Full fourtie yeares and fyue, his course of lyfe I kende▪
               
               O let mee liue his holie lyfe, and make his happie ende.
            
            
               3. SONG.
               
                  ST
                        •
                     rne Death, now doe thy best or worst, and spare not;
                  For thee and all thy dreadfull Darts I care not.
                  
                     I stand not for thy fead, or friendship eyther,
                  Short since thou slew my Sonne, and now my Father,
                  And tho my selfe thou kill, thou'lt not devoure mee:
                  I hope to follow them who went before mee.
                  Tho for a space thou soule and bodie sever,
                  In spyte of thee this Sainct shall liue for ever.
                  Whiles hee was heere, Nature and Grace contended;
                  Whose hee should bee, they both their forces bended.
                  His vertues liue, and shall, doe what thou may:
                  To his great glore, shall after Ages say,
               
               
                  Loe here intomb'd, this marble stone lyeth vnder,
                  Wits high Perfection, and our Ages wonder.
               
               
                  
                     Mr 
                     THOMAS MICHELL, Person of Turreff.
               
            
         
         
            Sacrat, To the Immortall Memorie of that Reverend Father in GOD, PATRICKE FORBES, By the Mercie of GOD, Bishop of Aberdene, Lord of his Majesties Secret Counsell, Chanceller and Restorer of the Universitie, Laird of Corse, and Baron of Oneill.
            LYke as in May, the countrey Sheep-herdling,
            Pulling the paynted Beauties of the Spring,
            
               Doubts with her selfe, whether to make her chose,
            The Pansey, Lillie, Violet, or Rose;
            The yealow, red; the purple, greene, the blew▪
            
            Or thousand-thousands of some other hew:
            Even so my Muse, when as her selfe shee rayses,
            And bends her selfe to poynt our Prelates Prayses:
            This Field such rare things offers to her view,
            That mute shee stands, and bids her Taske Adieu,
            
            His various Vertues muster in such store,
            Aboundance straynes her more, than Want before.
            For neyther Zeuxes, nor Apolles can
            Paynt the perfections of so rare a Man.
            His Majestie, his Port, his Court, his Grace,
            Did liuelie portray foorth his Worth, his Race.
            As his Grand-fathers, in our Civill Warres,
            Wer formost: formost eke in setling Iarres:
            So hee in both did beautifie his Clan,
            Formost in Peace, in Warre a valiant Man.
            As for his trueth, in whyt let it bee paynted,
            Which never time with spot or stayne once taynted,
            His loue to Learning, his delight in Arts,
            Quickned the vigour of his naturall parts.
            Both humane things, and heavenly things, he knew:
            All thinges were subject to his Soule her viewe.
            Lyke as an other Prelate sayd of late;
            Hee knew not what it could bee to forget:
            Even so from him was hid nothing at all,
            Betwixt the moving and th'vnmoving Ball.
            This knowledge of the things created, mov'd him
            To loue their Maker so (who so had lov'd him)
            That ravisht with His loue, hee preacht His Name,
            To his owne Servants, much lyke Abraham:
            
               Not lyke these Barons, whose commoditie,
            Makes vp their owne, their servants pietie:
            Who sheare their Flocks, who slay them: but to feed them,
            Who scorne, who care not how their Pastors leade them,
            To come, &amp; heare his wisdom, mē did stryue,
            Lyke Bees contesting for their honey hyue.
            His House a Colledge was of Pietie,
            A Compend of an Universitie:
            Where sweete Ambrosia filde, and never cloyed,
            And blest all those, that this sweete foode enjoyed.
            Where who were given to vertuous contemplation,
            Did finde a world of happie contentation.
            Whence sprung that sparke (which now succeeds his Syre)
            The brighest lāpe within the Scots Empyre.
            Such Vertue, Worth, such Wit, such Pietie,
            Made Court and Church his Suters both to bee.
            For Court and Church admiring both his fame,
            The Court his counsell crav'd; the Church the same.
            Thus hee who rul'd his owne House so of late,
            Did rule his Lords, in the Cathedrall Seat.
            And who of late, gaue counsell in small things,
            Became the Counsels Counsell, Light of Kings.
            The absence of this shyning Light hath made
            All faythfull Workers in Christs Vineyard sad:
            And makes them all with watrie Eyes to pray,
            That such a Light dispell their Clowds away.
            The absence of this Light (as one reported,
            A faythfull man, who then in Court resorted)
            Did moue our Soveraygne so, that oft hee sayd,
            I know no Worthie, worthie to succeede.
            Through absence of this shyning Light, wee see
            Th'eclipses of this Universitie.
            
               Her Sunne's gone downe, and darkned is her Day,
            Come Phosphor, come, come driue her clowds away.
            Thus shortly with my countrey Sheep-herdling,
            I pulled haue some Beauties of the Spring:
            But while I looke vpon the Ground alone,
            Pulling this houre, mee thinks I pulled none.
            The Field's replenisht, as it was before,
            And fragrant Odours wax aye more and more.

                  IOHN LVNDINE, Professor of Humanitie, In the Universitie of ABERDENE.
               
            
         
         
            In Honour of the Right Reverend FATHER IN GOD, PATRICK FORBES Bishop of Aberdene, Baron of Corse and Oneill, one of his Majesties most Honourable privie Counsell, &amp;c.
            
            IF all the Gifts that Nature could afford; 
            
            If all Perfection Arte could adde to Nature▪
            
            
               If in high Place to serue, and not debord;
            If good workes done what could a creature;

               His Sentences so sage, so sweet, and calme,
               Flow'd from him flowantlie, lyke Floods of Balme.
               His Proaves and his Pedegree, I passe,
               That honourable, and ev'r worthie was.
               Yet vnto them, and vnto all this Land,
               His Lyfe lent Light, and as a Starre did stand▪
               
               Praeshyning still, and with so solemne Show,
               That all the World his Christian carriage know.
               Vnto the poynct and period wherein
               His Soule ascended from this Sinke of Sinne:
               While softlie breathing, from his Breast, his Breath,
               Hee sleeped sweetlie, as disdayning Death:
               And with vs left an Ever-living Fame;
               A notable Renowme, and Noble Name.

               And Hee the day before his course did close,
               (T'attend the triumph of that Glorious Day,
               That all the Righteous should remember aye)
               His Soule ascending boue the chrystall Coome,
               While that its Reliques in this terren Tombe
               Heere lyes, it there, aye Haheluiah singes,
               To magnifie the Mightie KING of Kinges;
               And prostrate lowe, before the Mercies Throne,
               Duelie adores the TRINITIE-TRINE-ONE:

            Vpon the much-lamented death of the most Reverend Father in CHRIST, BISHOP PATRICKE, Late Lord Bishop of ABERDENE, &amp;c. EPITAPH.
            
               WIthin this Casket is inshrynd,
               
               Who now triumphs ov'r Death's Assyze:
               In whom, with Skill, Grace was combynde,
               To make a Praelate of rich pryze.
            
            
               
               A faythfull Steward hee was still,
               Who sterved none through want of Food:
               Dispensing all his Masters will,
               Rejoycing in the peoples good.
            
            
               In Church, or Civill-Policie,
               Few could to him bee parallell:
               Day-starre hee was of the Clergie;
               Nay, Pillar of the Common-weall.
            
            
               VVealth was not his Petition;
               VVith gift of Heritage content:
               Honour, without Ambition,
               His worth procur'd, and good Descent.
            
            
               And, to bee short, hee nothing wanted,
               To make him Mirrour of this Age:
               This trueth by all men must bee granted,
               Few so victorious left the Stage.
               VVhich makes vs act, in mourning Verse,

               A wittie States-man, or without oppression
               One bearing rule: nay, carelesse in conceat
               Of Coyne, to see a Church-man by Profession.
               Loe, here intomb'd then doeth a Phoenix lye,
               VVho liv'd all three, and did vnspotted dye.

            But eminent aboue these all is One,
            The chiefe and highest honour of that Towne,
            Late Praelate PATRICK, glorie of the Gowne
            BRITANE this All, &amp; He grac'd ABERDONE,
            And was an Ornament to all alone.

            A THRENODIE, Vpon the Lamentable, and ever to bee deplored death, of the most Reverend Father in CHRIST, PATRICKE, Late Bishop of Aberdene, One of the Lordes of Privie Counsell, and Right Honourable Laird of Corse, and Baron of Oneill.
            
                HIs Birth, sad Muse, his lyfe, his death, passe by,
            And all that follow'd these, and doe not pry,
            In these transplendent rayes, of Vertues light,
            Which looking to, may thee bereaue of sight:
            But in thy passing by, take once a glance,
            And make that glance, his prayses to advance.
            First in his birth, which is but least of all,
            But great indeede: but here to mynde I call,
            
               His vert'ous lyfe, by all so still renown'd,
            That with it, as a Garland, Birth was crown'd.
            His godlie lyfe, with glistring Winges of Fame,
            Doeth to all ages eternize his Name.
            As in his mortall lyfe, to CHRIST hee liv'd,
            So now with CHRIST, &amp; vnto CHRIST he dy'd.
            Wee doe our Neighbour misse, but his hath found,
            CORNELIUS, wee cause for to resound:
            The hills and dales with sorrow, hee with joy:
            Wee for our Sheepherds losse, not hee, for why?
            His Sheepherd hee hath found, hee now is crown'd,
            VVhich fills his heart with joy, makes ours to sound
            VVith griefe, away from vs to PAUL hath gone
            Our TIMOTHIE, his precepts everie one
            How hee hath kept to show, which makes our heart,
            VVith joy, with griefe, for him to burst, to smart
            For vs. Ah, ABERDENE! Ah ABERDONE!
            Thy Light's eclyps'd, from thee thy joy is gone.
            My Muse wold speak, but it doth blush for shame,
            Not being worthie to sound out His Fame.

            ON THE DEATH OF THE RIGHT HONOURABLE AND REVEREND FATHER IN GOD, PATRICK FORBES BISHOP OF ABERDENE.
            
               WEE neede not bee lugubrious,
               
                   For this sweete holie One,
               Who now from vs away is reft,
               Vnto that heavenlie Throne.
            
            
               For now hee weares the Diademe
               Of Glorie Immortall;
               For his good workes in Heaven shyne,
               Lyke Starres coelestiall.
            
            
               But to the LORD Omnipotent,
               Who him hath princelie crownd,
               
                  Let vs giue thankes, and eke His prayse,
               With heart and voyce resound.
            
            
               A rarer Man could not bee found,
               As this, on earth to dwell:
               For hee in Vertues all, but most
               In WISEDOME did excell.
            
            
               His vertuousnesse for to expresse,
               It is but all in vayne;
               Because to all are manifest,
               His Vertues without stayne.
            
            
               A Godlier could not bee found,
               All mortall men among;
               Who for his good and godlie lyfe,
               Vnto the Heavens is gone.

                   VVho, on this Earth, Compare had none.
               A Learned Patron, Wyse, and Graue.
               A Consull good. What would you haue?
               Chiefe Orator of Scotlands North.
               The World can not afford his VVorth.
               A Prelate, and a Pastor good;
               VVho, in due tyme, gaue Heavenlie Food,

               The Poore, with Meat, Hee fed also,
               None hungrie from His House did goe.
               A CROSSE into His Badge Hee bore,
               And follow'd CHRIST, who went before,
               But halfe a day, for to prepare
               For CORSE, with HIM, an Heavenlie Share.
               Then, Death! Where is thy Sting? Let see.
               And, graue! Where is thy Victorie?
               Your Honour in the Dust is spred:
               PATRICRE now reygnes with CHRIST, His Head.
               Death's but a Passage, to convoy
               Such Sayncts into their Master's Ioy.
            
            
               The LORD prepare vs, lesse, and more,
               To follow Him: Hee's gone before.
            
            
               Good Sirs, I am bihind the rest,
               I doe confesse, for want of Skill:
               But not a whit behind the best,
               To show th'affection of good Will.
