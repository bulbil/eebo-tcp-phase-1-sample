            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

                        I would not write any more examples of ſuppoſitories, becauſe they are little in uſe, and of little effect,Note. for the former glyſters and laxative Ptiſans and purging broaths which follow are farre better and of more vertue.
                     
                     
                        A Certaine remedy for to looſen the belly of thoſe which are hard bound, and will not take neither Clyſters nor Suppoſitories.
                        BEcauſe there are certaine perſons that are ſo cholericke that they will uſe neither Clyſters nor ſuppoſitories for any good in the world: not ſo much for a certaine ſhame as they have, as they are afflicted with their Hemerods as well internall as externall and other diſeaſes thereunto belonging, therefore let them uſe this remedy following which is excellent.
                        Take a dramme and a halfe or two drammes of good Sene, halfe a dramme of greene Anniſeeds;This Infuſion commeth to 6. pence. put them into a porringer, and poure upon them ſeven or eight ſpoonefulls of water, but if the perſon bee not troubled with a Cough, you may put halfe water and halfe and halfe juyce of Lymons, and then cover the ſaid porringer and put them to infuſe upon hot cinders or in ſome other warme place the ſpace of halfe an houre or an houre, then ſtraine and ſqueeze it through a white linnen cloath, and put it into three or foure times as much of cleare thin broath or pottage, and let it be drunk faſting, and ſome two houres after let the party eate ſome warme thing.
                        But if the aforeſaid broath or infuſion be diſagreeable to ſome delicates becauſe of the taſte of the Sene,

may ſqueeze into the broath the juyce of another Lymon, but if that cannot pleaſe them, then you ſhall make the Infuſion as followeth; in this caſe you ſhall not put your Sene and Anniſeeds in Infuſion upon hot cinders, but in another place from the fire, the ſpace of three houres, then ſtraine and ſqueeze it as before and mixe it with the other broath, putting to it the juyce of a Lymon and there ſhall be no ill taſte at all.
                        This ſaid Infuſion or broath of Sene thus prepared, diſcha

                        But if it happen that the party being long time bound, this broath doth not diſcharge the belly: (which hapneth but ſeldome) you muſt reiterete it at night about foure or five a clocke, or the next morning.
                        Alſo if the party refuſe to take the broath of Sene, hee may in ſtead thereof take one good glaſſe full of laxative Ptiſan of which I have written hereafter) taking two houres after ſome thin warme broath.
                     
                     
                        For the poore which are ſolid and hard bound.
                        THoſe poore people which have not the Commodity to take Clyſters nor broaths made with Sene as is before written, let them uſe this remedy following.
                        Take two pennyworth of Sene, that is two or three drammes with a little Anniſeeds, which they may have at the Apothecaries or drouguiſts, which they

ſhall infuſe in a porringer with nine or tenne ſpoonefulls of water upon hot cinders the ſpace of an houre or two, then ſtraine and ſqueeze it through a linnen cloath, and put it into three or foure times as much broath or pottage, and take it as aforeſaid.

                     Of Clarification. CHAP. II. The manner to clarifie Sugar and Honey:
                     GOod Sugar, which is white, hard, ſolid, and cleare, and of a good ſmell; ought not to be clarified, for it will yeeld little or no ſcumme; But for ſugar which is not cleare, nor hard, ſhall be clarified as followeth.
                     Take (for example) two pound of Sugar, break it and cut it into ſmall pieces, put it into a pan, and poure upon it a pint of water decoction or infuſion to melt it, and while it is a melting, take two whites of egges with the ſhells, and beate them very well together in another pan or baſon, pouring by little and little into it another pint of water or decoction, which being well beaten together with a whiske or little rod; then take the ſugar being melted from the fire, and beate them all together, then put them upon the fire, and when you ſee the ſcumme riſe and it begins to boyle, then take it from the fire, and ſtraine it through the

blancket made faſt to the foure corners of the wooden ſquare, with a baſon underneath to receave that which is ſtrained.
                     If the ſaid ſugar being ſtrained ſeeme not to be clarified enough, you may paſſe it againe through the blanket, and ſo you may doe two or three times, but it muſt be done while it is hot.
                     When the ſaid ſugar is faire enough, one need not take the paines to clarifie it for Syrups, &amp;c. but onely at the end of their boyling, take them from the fire and ſcumme it with a ſilver ſpoone, or with a ſpoone with holes you may take of the ſcum.
                     That if you clarifie ſugar, you muſt put for each pound of ſugar a pint of water decoction or infuſion, and one white of an egge with the ſhell; but if the Sugar bee ſoule, you muſt put more of the liquor, and more whites of eggs, according to the dampneſſe thereof.
                     That thoſe ſyrups which are made of Iuices, are made with good white ſugar; as thoſe of Raſpas, Quinces, Mulberries, Cherries, and the like: for if they be often clarified, they looſe their ſtrength and vertue.
                     Alſo that to make ſyrup of Lymons, Granates, and others, you muſt have of the beſt ſugar, and it muſt bee boyled to the height as you make your ſugar of Roſes, but if you cannot get that which is very white, you muſt firſt clarifie it, and then boyle it and ſcumme it as is aforeſaid.
                     At the end when your ſugar is ſtrained, you muſt not preſſe and ſqueeze the blancket, but let it ſtraine by little and little untill it be all dropt into the reſt.
                     
                        For to clarifie Honey, take a pound or two, or the quantity you pleaſe of the beſt Honey; put it into a pan with as much water or other liquor, and put it upon the fire, and when it hath boyld a walme or two, ſtraine it through a ſtrong linnen cloath; and for every two pound of honey take a white of an egge with the ſhell; (as is aforeſaid in the clarification of Sugar) and the ſecond ſtraining ſhall bee boyled to what conſiſtence the Phyſician ſhall ſee fitting.
                     If the honey bee very foule, you muſt put more liquor and whites of egges, as is ſaid of Sugar; Note, that when you ſtraine your honey it muſt bee very hot, but the ſugar ought to coole a little before you paſſe it.
                  
                  
                     
                        CHAP. III. The manner to Clarifie Decoctions and Infuſions a part without Sugar.
                     THE decoctions and infuſions ought not to bee ſtrained boyling, but halfe cold before they bee paſſed through the ſtrainer or blancket; as for example, one putteth the white of an egge with the ſhell upon two pound of decoction or infuſion, doing as followeth.
                     Take a white of an egge with the ſhell, and put it into the pan or baſon, and beate it very well with the ſaid whiske or little broome; then put to it halfe a pint of the ſaid decoction or infuſion, beating them very well together; then poure in by little and little the reſt of the ſaid infuſion or decoction, then put it

upon the furnace, and when it hath boyled a walme or two that you ſee the durty ſcum riſe, then let it ſtand untill it be halfe cold, and then paſſe it thorow the ſtrainer or blancket.
                     That infuſions and decoctions are paſſed but one time through the blancket, for if they be paſſed any more, they looſe a part of their vertue.
                  
                  
                     
                        CHAP. IV. The manner to clarifie Apozemes with Syruys and alſo to clarifie Whey.
                     THoſe that are licoriſh of Apozemes, clarifie them in this manner.
                     Take a pint and a halfe of the decoction of the ſimples ſtrained; which being clarified with the white of an egge and the ſhell, put it into a pan upon the furnace, and when it beginneth to boyle, put the Syrups into it, and when the ſcumme riſeth take it from the fire and let it coole a little, then paſſe it two or three times through the blancket untill it be cleare.
                     If you will have your Apozeme Aromaticke, you may Aromatize it with ſome Cordiall powder as followeth.
                     Before you paſſe your Apozeme, put the powder upon the blancket, and paſſe the Apozeme three or foure times, pouring it upon the powder, and your Apozeme will be clarified and Aromatized.
                     Know that upon foure ounces of decoction you muſt put an ounce of Syrup, and being paſſed and repaſſed there will be wanting a quarter or more.
                     
                        Take twelve pints of Whey, foure pound of good Sugar, put them together into a baſon or other veſſell convenient, the ſugar being melted let it boyle a walme or two; then put into it foure ounces of juice of Lymons boyling it a little longer, then take it from the fire, and being a little cold, paſſe it three or foure times through a white linnen cloath, and it will be cleare and agreeable.
                     If you have no Whey, you may make it with Milk as followeth.
                     Take three or ſixe pints of Milke, put it into a pipkin or earthen veſſell, that done, take a ſpoonefull of ſtroakings and mixe it with three or foure ſpoonefulls of the ſaid Milk, then mixe it with the Milk and cover the pot with a cover, and let it ſtand three or foure houres upon the hot Coales or Cinders, then take away the Cheeze or Curd, and clarifie it as aforeſaid.
                  
                  
                     
                        CHAP. V. The manner to draw Iuices.
                     THe juyces of Roots, and of Hearbs, of Plantaine, Rue, Smalladge, Purſlaine, Lettice, Betony, Mercury, and other freſh hearbs, are drawne as followeth.
                     The Braſſe or Stone Morter, being filled with the Roots, or hearbs, well cleanſed and waſhed if need require, then beate them very well with an iron or woodden peſtle; after they are well beaten put them into a ſtrong linnen cloath, tying the cloath on the

top with a packthred, and put it into the preſſe and preſſe it very well, having a baſon underneath to receive the juyce.
                     That when you draw the juyce of any other root or hearb, you muſt firſt waſh the morter, peſtle, and preſſe, with hot or cold water, for feare the ſaid root or hearb be different in quality, and ſo looſe his vertue; and you muſt ſeeke alwayes to have your hearbs, when they are at their beſt nature.
                     Alſo there are certaine ſimples which ought to bee beat in the Marble morter, as ſhall bee written hereafter.
                  
                  
                     
                        CHAP. VI. To draw the juice of Quinces.
                     THe Quinces muſt be raſped with the raſpe of iron one after another, for by this meanes you may draw more juyce, then if you beate them in a morter whole, or in quarters, thē put that which is raſped into a cloath, and preſſe it in the preſſe as is ſhewed before:

                     TAke the flowers of the ſaid Roſes, and beate them very well in a Marble morter, untill they be almoſt in a paſte; then put them in a linnen cloath and preſſe them.

                     THe Gooſeberries being beate very well in a Marble morter, put them into a cloath and preſſe them in the preſſe.

                     TAke a quantity of Mulberries, beat them, and tye them in a cloath, and preſſe them in the preſſe.
                  
                  
                     
                        CHAP. XI. To draw the Iuice of Cherries.
                     TAke a quantity of Cherries, and take out the ſtones and preſſe them as aforeſaid.
                  
                  
                     
                     
                        CHAP. XII. To draw the Iuice of Granates.
                     TAke the Pomgranates, and take away the peele and keepe it; which is called Malicorium, and all the reſt is put in a cloth and preſt as before.
                  
                  
                     
                        CHAP. XIII: To draw the Iuice of Citrons and Lymons.
                     CVt the Citrons and Lymons in the middle, and take away the peele, and put the reſt in a cloth and preſſe it.
                     Otherwiſe cut the ſaid Citrons and Lymons in foure quarters, and take away the skinne peele and ſeeds and ſo preſſe it; but becauſe the pulpe will never preſſe ſo well but there will remaine ſome juyce, you may put to it a little freſh water, and ſo preſſe it, and you may uſe it about what you pleaſe.
                  
                  
                     
                        CHAP. XIIII. The manner to Clarifie the aforeſaid Iuices.
                     WHen you have drawne the aforeſaid Iuices as is written, you ſhall put them ſeverally in a double glaſſe, and ſet them in the Sunne or ſome other

place two or three dayes or more, to the end that they may ſettle, and all the dreggs may deſcend to the bottome of the ſaid glaſſe; then take them and paſſe them ſeverally, very ſoftly through the blancket, that the dregs doe not mixe with them, and trouble the cleare which ought onely to paſſe.
                     And if you will uſe them preſently, you may doe as you make Syrups and other Compoſitions, but if you will keepe them, put them into a double glaſſe, filling the glaſſe almoſt to the necke, then fill up the glaſſe with a little oyle of Olives, and ſtop it, and keepe them in a temperate place.
                     And when you will uſe the foreſaid Iuices, you muſt take a little Cotton, and put into the mouth of the glaſſe to ſucke up the oyle, and your juyce will be cleare and cleane, which you may paſſe through the blancket to make it more clearer.
                     The Iuice of Mulberries is clarified as followeth; being preſſed boyle it a little in a pan or baſon, and being hot paſſe it by little and little through the blancket: and as ſoone as it is paſſed, make it into a Syrup with Sugar.
                     The Iuice of Cherries is clarified in the Sunne, and ſtrained through the blancket; and as ſoone as it is ſtrained, made into a Syrup as it is written in the Treatiſe of Syrups.
                  
                  
                     
                     
                        CHAP. XV. To draw the Iuice of Apples and to Clarifie it.
                     RAſpe the Apples one after another, as the Quinces, and draw the Iuice of the ſame faſhion; the which being drawne, boyle it a little, and ſtraine it through the blancket, and that which is ſtrained put into a glaſſe, and ſet it in the Sunne that the dreggs may goe to the bottome, and then ſtraine it againe through the blancket, and make Syrup.
                     If you will keepe the ſaid Iuice of Apples, put it into a double glaſſe and put ſome oyle upon it.
                     Note, that in Winter the ſaid Iuices ought to bee kept in the Cellar.
                  
                  
                     
                        CHAP. XVI. The manner to boyle Sugar to the conſiſtance; to make Sugar of Roſes.
                     BOyle a pound of Sugar, or what quantity you pleaſe, that is to ſay to a pound of Sugar, halfe a pint of water into the conſiſtance or height which you ſhall know by theſe ſignes following.
                     Firſt, the ſumme that riſeth from the ſugar in the skillet or other veſſell will be very little, when the ſugar is almoſt boyled.
                     Secondly, taking a little up upon the end of the ſpatule, and throwing it upon the ground, a little of it

will flye away, and that which is one ground doth not cleave thereto: Alſo you may know by putting a little upon a trencher and let it coole; alſo in taking a little upon the end of the ſpatule or ſpoone, and pouring it down, maketh a long thred by thoſe ſignes, you may know when it is boyled to the conſiſtance, you ſhall know alſo when it is halfe cold by the thickneſſe of it.
                  
                  
                     
                        CHAP. XVII. To boyle Sugar to make Tablets or Lozinges with powders.
                     TO make the ſaid Lozinges or Tablets, if you have not of the beſt Sugar, take ſome midling Sugar, and when it is almoſt boyled, ſcum it very well; this Sugar muſt not be boyled to that height as the Sugar of Roſes, you may know when it is enough by taking a little upon the Spatule or upon a trencher, and it groweth thicke and doth not runne, but yet it ſticks to the trencher; alſo if you take a little upon the end of the ſpatule, it maketh a thred but not ſo long as that of Sugar of Roſes.
                     And to tell you in one word, you muſt have judgement to judge of the boyling thereof, for ſometimes there is put two drammes of powder, for two ounces of Sugar, and ſometimes a dramme for two ounces.

                     TAke the decoction or infuſion with the Sugar, and boyle them upon a char-coale fire well kindled to the height that it ought to be boyled unto.
                     The which you ſhall know by taking a little upon the end of the ſpatule or ſilver ſpoone, and putting it upon a trencher, which being cold, will not ſcarce runne without you ſtirre it with your fingers, which will bee very glutinous. Alſo when it ſtayeth upon the ſpoon or ſpatule, and will not runne, but drop out in little bits as it were.
                     The honey will be boyld alſo in the ſame faſhion, preparing it as followes.
                     The honey being clarified as is written in the firſt Chapter of this Treatiſe, and boyled to the height which you ſhall know by taking a little and putting it upon a trencher and it ſtay upon the trencher being cold and doth not runne; then take it from the fire and uſe it, or if you will keep it, let it be a little cold, and then put it into a pot fitting, and tye a paper over it being pricktfull of ſmall holes with a needle, that no durt nor flies get into it, and when it is cold tye it over with a double paper, and keep it in a temperate place, and when you will uſe it, you need but weigh the quantity you ſhall need and heat it in a skillet or veſſell fitting for the ſame.

                     FOr to make Infuſions of Syrups which are made of flowers, you muſt put for each pint of water foure ounces of flowers, as you ſhall ſee written hereafter; the infuſions muſt bee made in pipkins, or veſſells of pewter, or ſilver, having narrow mouthes that they may bee covered, and not in veſſells of Copper or Braſſe.
                     That the veſſell which the infuſions are made in ought to be ſtopped,Note. that the medicaments looſe not their vertue by exhalation.
                     Alſo that in making many infuſions one after another, as in Syrups,Note. it is neceſſary that the firſt infuſion ſhould bee made with boyling water poured upon them, and the others which follow onely warmed.
                  
                  
                     
                        CHAP. XX. To know when Syrups are boyled enough.
                     NOte that to make Syrups with infuſions or decoctions, there is put ſometimes three parts of Sugar to a quantity of infuſion or decoction, as for example three quarterns of Sugar to a pint of infuſion or decoction; alſo there be thoſe Syrups that are put as much Sugar as decoction, and ſome not ſo much, therefore this is no generall rule.
                     The Syrups ought to bee boyled ſoftly upon the

furnace upon a charcoale fire, taking it from the fire when it is boyled, and ſcumming of it with a pierced ſpoone or ſilver ſpoone.
                     When the Syrup beginneth to boyle, the fume will goe out very ſtrong; but when it is boyled or neere being boyled, you ſhall ſee the fume very well diminiſhed.
                     To know better, take a little upon the ſpoone or ſpatule and let it fall, and if it make a thred it is boyled.
                     Alſo in taking a little between the thumbe and one of the fingers it maketh a thred it is enough, or in putting a little upon a trencher, and it runneth drop by drop and maketh a thred.
                     And when it is boyled, take it from the fire and let it coole in the baſon, then put it into a pot and cover it with a paper full of holes made with a needle, that nothing falleth into it, and when it is cold cover it with a double paper, and keepe it in a temperate place.

                     IF the Syrups be to much boyled, put a little of the decoction, or infuſion, or juyce, the which it is made with, and let it boyle a little to come to the true height.
                     If they be not boyled enough, you muſt put them

upon the fire and boyle them to their conſiſtance; for thoſe Syrups which are candied, you muſt warme ſome of the decoction or juyce that it is made with, and poure it into the Candie, and ſo diſſolve that which is candied, and boyle it to the height.

                        For to draw the pulps of prunes in their times and ſeaſons; you ſhall take ſweet Damaske prunes, or in their ſtead ſweet plumbs the quantity you pleaſe, boyle them in ſufficient quantity of water till they be boyled enough.
                     Then pulpe them through a ſieve, and put under them a veſſell to receive the pulpe, putting to them a little liquor, and if you have not of the liquor, take a little warme water. To draw pulpe of Tamarinds do as followeth: take what quantity of Tamarinds you pleaſe, put them into a Marble morter, and beat them well with warme water or decoction, then pulpe them through a ſieve as aforeſaid.
                     
                        Note.That when the ſaid pulpes of Tamarinds and of Prunes are paſſed, there will remaine ſome humidity, which hath beene put to them in the paſſing of them; wherefore you muſt put them ſeverall in a pewter diſh or platter upon a chaffing diſh of coales, ſtirring it together untill all the humidity bee conſumed, ſo you may doe with Caſſia, &amp;c. if you put liquor to them, for otherwiſe they will ſpoyle the Electuaries which they enter into, and make them muſtie.
                     That done you may weigh the doſe that enters into the Electuary, and keepe the beſt for another uſe.

                  The manner to Embalme a dead Corps.
                  
                     FIrſt of all let the Chyrurgeon make a long inciſion from the necke unto the lower belly; opening the breaſt, and taking out the heart, lungs, and others, or leaving of them within; but if they deſire to hav
                        •
                      the heart embalmed by it ſelfe, then make an Inciſion in the pericard, in which it is incloſed, and embalme it as ſhall be ſhowne hereafter.
                  After that you may ſhow the belly inferiour, that is the ſtomacke and the Epipleon; conſidering the orifice ſuperiour, and inferiour, and afterwards the bowells, bladder, and other things.
                  All the ſaid parts of the the breſt and belly inferiour being obſerved, muſt bee all cut round the Diaphragma, and cut as neere as poſſible can be where they are tied and taken all out, and put into a large baſon or veſſell.
                  Thoſe two bellies being emptied and cleanſed, that is all the blood that commeth from the veines and

Arteries, dryed up with Sponges: then you muſt come to the head.
                  The head or Cranium ſhall bee ſawed in two, as you doe in an Anatomie, and the braines and parts ſhall be put into the veſſell with the bowells, together with the blood that hath been drawne out of the three bellies; that is, the head, breſt, and belly inferiour, and put them altogether into a barrell, and hoope it round, to be buried or put into the ground; but if they deſire to carry them far, or to keep them you may embalme them as followeth.
                  Having emptied and ſqueezed the blood from the excrements, you muſt waſh them with warme oxicrat, made with foure parts of water, and one of vineger compounded, as ſhall be written hereafter: then powder them all about with one of the balming powders hereafter written, then put them into a barrell pitcht within and without, and hoope the barrell well, and then wrappe it round with Ceare-cloth and cord it faſt, then put it into a bigger barrell alſo pitcht and hoopt, and ſend it whither you pleaſe.
                  The head, breſt, and belly inferiour being alſo emptied and cleanſed, you ſhall begin to embalme them: beginning at the head being well waſhed within with the ſaid vineger compounded, then with pieces of Cotton ſoaked in the ſaid vineger and filled with balme, the head ſhall be filled, and both the pieces of the skull ſhall bee bound together with thred.
                  Doe alſo to the breſt as you doe to the head, piercing the Muſcles and fleſh with a bodkin, to make the blood runne out, which you muſt dry up with ſponges, then waſh and ſoake it with the ſaid vineger, and

fill it up with Cotten full of Balme, do ſo alſo to the belly inferiour.
                  The foreſaid parts being embalmed, you muſt make long Inciſions in the armes, legges, thighes, and buttocks, and principally in the great veines and Arteries, to make the blood runne out, and to dry them up with Sponges; then ſoake them with the ſaid Vineger, and ſtop them full of pieces of Cotton filled with Balme.
                  You ſhall make an Inciſion from the ſhoulder to the wriſt in the arme, piercing it with a bodkin to the bone all about, to make way for the blood, then dry it up with ſponges, and waſh and ſoake it well with the ſaid vineger, and then filling it with pieces of Cotton ſoaked in the ſaid vineger and filled with Balme, and then ſowe it up with a needle and thred; ſo doe to the thighes making an inciſion from the belly to the knee, piercing of it, and ſtoping and ſewing of it up as before, and ſo the knees and others.
                  You may alſo ſtop the holes of the eares and noſtrills and mouth, with Cotton ſoaked in the vineger and filled with Balme.
                  That done turne the Corps upon the belly and make an Inciſion about the Ingular veines in the necke, letting out the blood, and ſo make an inciſion downe the reines, piercing the backe to let out the blood, taking it away and waſhing it with the ſaid vineger, and filling it with Cotton balmed, and ſewing them up as before.
                  Alſo make Inciſions in the palmes of the hands, and in the ſoles of the feet, and waſh and fill them as before, ſowing them up alſo, the fingers and toes; inciſions

being made and ſtopped as before.
                  The Corps being thus embalmed ſhall be anointed all over with Venice Turpentine, diſſolved in oyle of Roſes or oyle of Spike, and then it ſhall bee covered all over with Seare-cloth and put it into a Coffin of Lead, the which Coffin ſhall be filled with dry Aromaticke hearbs, as Rue, Wormwood, Time, Scordeum, Marjoram, and others as ſhall be written hereafter, then cover it and let it be well ſodered.
                  
                     To Embalme the Heart.
                     THe Heart being waſhed with the ſaid Vineger compounded, ſhall bee put to infuſe in the ſaid Vineger in a pipkin being plaiſtered round the lidde, that the aire enters not the ſpace of five or ſixe dayes, then take it out and make an inciſion in it, and fill it with balme and pieces of Cotton balmed, and ſowe it up againe, then few it well into a little bag made of Scarecloth, and put it into a caſe of Lead, Silver, or Pewter, faſhioned in the forme of a Heart, and carry it whither you pleaſe.
                     That the Simples which enter into the following Balmes, as roots, hearbs, ſeeds, &amp;c. if they bee not dry they muſt be dryed in the ſhade or in an Oven after the Bread is drawne forth, before they be powdered.
