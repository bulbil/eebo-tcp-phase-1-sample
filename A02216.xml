            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

            ¶To the Courteous and Christian Reader.
            
               SVch and so great (Gentlemen) is the obstinate and peruerse blindnesse of the fond and fantasticall Papistes, that vnworthely they chalenge vnto them selues all Ecclesiasticall Rites and Priuiledges, vnderpropping their ruinous ROMAINE Church with such fayre, but rotten, postes, and extolling (euen aboue God) their whorish Antechrist with such glorious titles of holinesse &amp; honor, that if God did not turne their wordly wisedome to follie, and cause them by running headlong into grosse &amp; palpable errors, to discouer their owne dotinges, many true and perfect Christians might by their charming allurements be sinisterly seduced. As I was thus sorrowfully meditating of these their polliticke illusiōs, there came to my handes a Copie of the Oration or Sermon pronounced at Roome ouer the Corps of GREGORIE the xiij. their last and leaud Pope: which taking in my hand &amp; thinking to finde some excellent (though erronious) shewe of skill and learning: after I had vewed and reuewed it ouer carefully, I found such a confused Chaos of doting conceipts, such an absurd fourme both of learning, reason,

and methode, that I could not but wonder how either Mas Doctor the Preacher could bee so impudent, to vtter such balde stuffe afore so many stately Cardinalles: or such mightie Potentates suffer the Corps of their new Sainct GREGORIE: or their owne reuerende grauities to bee abused with the rehearsall of such fantasticall toyes. But seeing their owne wordes may bee best witnesses of their follies, I thought good to translate it into English, that euen the simplest may see how simplie GOD wot these great Schoolemaisters deale in their greatest &amp; most waightie affaires. For who would haue thought that the Cardinalles would not haue appointed such a learned Prelate to preach at the Funerall of so mightie a man: nay, as they say, more then a man, that his excellēt Sermō might haue bene a glorie to the dead Corps of their good Pope GREGORIE: but seeing in such waightie affayres they bring forth such weake Diuinitie, let the world iudge how carelesly and vnskilfully they will gloze ouer their small and ceremonious tromperies. This shewe of their owne dotings then I hope shall bee a proofe or caueat for the godly to beware of their poysoned potions, and to leane only to the true Church that is builded on the Rock Christ Iesus: which happie successe in Godlinesse wishing to al men, I commit you to the Almightie.

            An Oration and Funerall Sermon vttered ouer the Corps of the holie Father Pope Gregorie the xiij. who deceased in Iesus Christ the 11. of Aprill. 1585.
            
               THERE is nothing so certaine as death, either vncertain as the momēt therof. Wherfore the holy Doctor saith: Keepe thy selfe continually in that estate wherein thou desirest to dye. And ye Prouerbe goeth, that many a one thinketh himselfe in perfect health, when he beareth death in his bosome. To say the troth we doe continually carrie death about with vs. It is in vs immediatly after we take life and mouing in our mothers wombe: and wheresoeuer we walke it is still at our heeles: If wee take horse, it is with vs: If wee bee on the water, it is the

guyde of our Shippe: so as we can neuer say death to bee absent from vs: for our selues are very death, and no part of our bodie immortall: wherefore those that suppose themselues to liue in this world are farre deceiued in their owne opinions, and the pilgrimage of man in this world is but a shadowe of life, which vnto vs seemeth life, but in deede is none. The better therefore to describe the said shadow, I will make an abstraction of the dead time of mans age from the full and greatest age that a creature can liue in the world.

                  . yeares. First, the longest age that mā can liue in this world is but sixe score yeares.
            From sixe score yeres we must deduct the nightes, for man when he sleepeth liueth not, besides that sleepe is termed the Image of death, so that deducting the nightes, which comprehēd one halfe of the time, man liueth but three score yeares in the world.
            Whiles man liueth these sixtie yeares, he liueth but the one halfe of them, for if he haue one day of mirth and quiet he hath an other of sorrowe and care, because

griefe doth still secretly creepe into mirth. And any person troubled with cares or vexed in mind, doth rather dye then liue, wee must therefore take from the sixtie yeares afore said the one halfe, and so there remaine but thirtie.
            Now, let vs see whether in the space of sixe score yeares a man may not passe away tenne at the least in sicknesse, mischaunces, or other infirmities? I may tell you there is no mā that liueth sixe score yeares in the world, but at seuerall times and during his sayd age he hath aboue tenne yeares infirmitie: and therfore we must take from the thirtie yeares which are the remainder of mans life yet tenne yeares, and then there are but twentie left.
            Which are now the twentie yeares of his life? We must take them at his infancie and in his oldest age: that is, tenne yeares from his very childhood, and the other tenne from his extreme olde age: but sith aswell in Infancie as in extremitie of age there is no life, but rather a liuing death, I conclude, that man hath not one only howre of life in this world,

also that whosoeuer seeketh life in this world doth much deceiue himselfe. In heauen therefore it is that wee must assure our selues to liue, and seeke for life, but not vppon earth where death doth continually haunt vs. For wee ought to dye to the world, to the end to be borne in Iesus Christ.

And for my owne part, O wretch and miserable man, who am depriued of him, of two thinges, I wish for one, that is, either neuer to remember the good that wee haue lost, either els calling the same to minde to finde some one that were able to giue me comfort correspondent to the greatnesse of the heauinesse whereinto I am fallen. And in deede my selfe doe now come into the Pulpit vpon two seuerall occasions mere contrary each to other, viz. to rehearse the greatnesse of the good that is taken from vs, and to comforte those that sustaine

the losse: nay, rather to doe two things which seeme to repugne each other: for if it bee true that nothing doth more aggrauate the griefe of the losse, then the remembraunce of the valew of the thing lost; then doth nothing seeme more contrary to the comfort of the liuing thē the praises of him that is dead, as in this cace, wherein so farre doe the merites of the deceased exceed, that the arrowes which pearce his heart that is depriued of him are the more sharp and grieuous. Howbeit some man would answere, that contrariwise by the commē
               dations of him yt is departed we doe declare that he is not dead, but liueth, and thus wee may by little and little asswage the sorrowe of our losse and domage in whatsoeuer maner. But as it were hard for a Painter in the face of a sorrowfull person to represent a smyling countenaunce, so doth it seeme to me a difficult enterprize to vndertake to comforte a man by rehearsing the vertues of him that is taken away from vs: and that the more if we should enter into consideration of him yt is spoken of: of your selues

that are the hearers: &amp; of me yt do make the discourse: for in each of these three, the same circumstaunces that seeme to make my enterprize easie, are those that in deede doe yeeld it most difficult and troublesome. As if a man should in respect of him say, that if the multitude of his great vertues doe seeme to abridge my labour in seeking some argument whereupon to ground his praises:Childish

And for my own part, if an infinite courtesies and great fauours wherewith he hath alwaies gratefied mee doe seeme without seeking any cunning to breede in mee as much affection as is requisite:

so by contrary reason, the great fauours and benefites wherwith he hath alwaies gratefied me doe not leaue me any cunning meanes to hinder me from hauing greater affectiō then is here to be required of me. And this was the principall reason that moued me somewhat to refuse this so honorable a Commission, &amp; vnto mee in many other respectes most welcome, and to request you to appoint and commit to some other the charge to discourse hereupon, and to leaue vnto me teares and lamentations onely.
            But now vnto thee, Oh my good master and father (for so will I alwayes call thee) doe I turne my selfe: May it bee possible that this my oratiō which lately in thy life thou diddest harken vnto, should now bee employed in praysing of thee beeing dead, either that this my tongue which employing me to the seruice of this countrey, thou diddest too greatly honor should now be occupied, helas, in lamentations for thy so hurtful death to all Christiandome? And what? hast thou then brought mee so ioyfully to Roome, to the end here to celebrate

thy funeralles? Oh how that Commission to reade Hieremie might well foreshewe vnto mee (but I perceiued it not) that my Lecture thereof should ende in lamentations, and now behould that diuination accomplished! see Quomodo sedet sola Ciuitas, how the Citie sitteth desolate, notwithstanding it be Plena populo, full of people:No Spouse but a Strū
                  pet spotted with spirituall fornication. also howe this spouse, The Church of Roome, who by greate brightnesse seemed to bee Domina gentium, Lady of Nations, now hauing lost thee, Est facta quasi Vidua, is made as it were a Widowe: and as a Widowe all dipped in teares and lamentations, willeth mee to celebrate the prayses of her deere spouse, which she all wholy togither can not celebrate: wherin although I can not (as in trueth I am not able) atteyne to the least parcell of thy desertes,Beastly and blasphemous deuinitie, fit for so leaud a Bishop and so vnlearned a Chaplaine. which are not well to be expressed, yet at all aduentures I assure my selfe, O happy soule, that as in thy lyfe time thou diddest pardon mee a number of other imperfections, so now thou wilt likewise forgiue mee this: I knowe that as thou wert accustomed, thou wilt make better

accompt of the good will then of the glose and pompe of wordes, and as discreete, shalt well see, that not onely I, but also that no Oratour is able to atteyne to the type of thy commendations. Among the which my Lords and ye my hearers, I doe freely confesse, that I haue greatly doubted whether I were best to begin, as I take the maner to be, at the greatenesse and eminencie of the famely from whence he is extract: and at the first I was purposed so to doe, and that ye rather because it is not yet scarce two monethes sence that my selfe heard him in this Temple, discourse how our Sauiour Iesus Christ was content to bee borne of a Mother though poore, yet Noble, and discended of a Noble race, also that Nobilitie was very effectuall euen to spirituall life, as it may be sayd of him that is noble, that whether it bee through conformitie or resemblance of mind with his predecessors, either thorowe the remembrance of such things as they haue done, either els through the effect of good bringing vp, or for whatsoeuer other reason, hee is better

disposed to doe well: that nobilitie serueth him as a spurre to goodnesse and a bridle to euill, also that as the precious stone being ser in Gould maketh a greater shew then in Iron, euen so the same vertuous deedes doe giue a more effectuall example when they proceede from noble personages then from men of base estate, with other things which hee spake to the same purpose. Howbeit I will not speake thereof, in that it might be accompted rashnesse in mee euen in Roome to seeke to make his holinesse famely more famous then it is. It may bee that some may say that this famely doth want glorious titles, preeminence, riches, possessions, Iurisdictions, pretentions of rights, patronages, auncient petidegrees of their predecessors, commē
               dations of learning, prayse of armes, noble &amp; famous alliances either in Italy or without, and to be briefe, all such things collected into one, as being seuerally taken are sufficient to set a fayre shewe vpon a whole progenie. Notwithstandin

            But discoursing and speaking of that which properly appertaineth to himself, I would aske whether his minde commaunded not his bodie? Also whether it were possible to find a bodie more withered, afflicted, macerated, dried vp, or pale through the effect of austere and hard penaunce? Other mens bodies (O Christian hearers) are for the most part wished to bee of this or that forme, because they yeeld such or such inclination to the minde, but in this I will shew you a matter worth the noting, that is, that here the cace was altered, for it was the minde that ministred inclination to the bodie, so that beeing waxen altogether spirituall, had not extreame need forced him, hee neuer desired meate, drinke, or

bodily rest: and he liued in such sort as it was a miracle (whereof, helas, wee haue but too soone seene the issue,) how hee could liue so many yeares, but rather liuing was dead: And for my part I assure you, I neuer, euen in the hart of Somer, kissing his holy hands (good God shall I neuer doe so more?) found them other then colde, wherein there was no heate except the same proceeded of some excesse or immoderate labour, or of some motion of a sodaine feuer. O most deare bodie O most holy members!

            But it is time for vs, O Christian hearors, to proceede to matters of greater importance, which are so many &amp; withal so intangled one within an other, that I could not finde any more fit meane to part and deuide thē, neither do I thinke that we can take any better course, then the very course of his holy life: and there to beginne.
            When he was a litle childe he was very deuoute, and it is well knowne that God euen in his first youth wrought in him merueilous signes of singuler goodnesse. The like is read of S. Basile, S. Gregory, S. Dominick, S. Frances, and many others, as was to bee seene in this young childe, (say they that doe remember it) namely, that at his returne frō the Colledge, all the delight that that age vsed

to take in any other thing, he tooke only in framing of little Aulters, adorning of small Chappels, and counterfaiting of holy thinges. Matters, which although the wisest may thinke too base for this place, &amp; for the occasion now ministred, yet would I not onely not disdaine, but also take great and singuler pleasure in the same. And although some doe say that among such serious affayres such small trifles should haue no place, yet do I delight to shewe how commendable, not onely graue matters, but euen such small thinges were in him. Concerning the rest, according to the proportion of his age, or rather beyond the reach of that age (as occasions doe encrease so must my stile arise) his holinesse beeing past the inferiour Schooles, and comming to studie the Law, it is not possible to make an ende of writing with what modestie and grauitie hee there passed the yeares of his studie:The continencie and virginitie of the Popish Clergie doth consist in keeping of Concubines. he was apparelled in Clarkes attire, but, which was of greater importaunce, he obserued Clergie maners, much continencie, (as it is supposed) perpetual virginitie, with modest

behauiour, no vanitie, continual studie: These were his exercizes: and to be briefe, although through our mishaps the Vniuersitie wherein he studied were not vsually either the quietest or the holiest in the world, yet might the writing of Naziauzene concerning the Great Basille and the towne of Athens be applied to him. Like as, there is one riuer which flowing through the Sea, taketh no bitternesse thereof: also a certaine beast that liueth in the fire &amp; consumeth not, euen so he with great quietnesse passing these troubles, and with soueraigne vertue such vices, did first and most worthely atteine to the doctorall degree, and afterwarde was called to Roome, and made Cardinall onely through desert, for his learned studies, and not by fauour as the most part doe now vsually practize.
            A happie departure, a blessed iorney for al the holy Church, but especially for this great Citie of Roome, which haue receiued so great benefites and so much comfort at his hands. Notwithstanding whatsoeuer affayres he had in hand, yet did hee daylie applie his studie at a certaine

howre, and so continued his studie euen to his death, with so deepe iudgement and good successe, that although his intellectuall habitudes had not very farre beene surmounted and darkened through the merueilous brightnesse of his morall and theologall vertues, yet in respect of his learning and studie onely, he deserued great praise, and in troth he was neuer other then most learned and a great fauourer of learned men. Who did euer shewe them more pleasure, or receiue them more courteously? Besides the Seminaries and Colledges, as well at Pauy as here, the Lectures, the Stipends, with such and so many thinges done to behoofe of learning, &amp; besides the bookes which hee hath of himselfe written: and now that the bridle of his modestie doth no longer deteine, I hope, as my selfe haue seene them, so comming to light, all the world shall behold them, &amp; in them perceiue as in him selfe whether were more the holy writinges or good maners.

But herein I repose my self vpon that zeale which I perceiue in euery one to commend him, wherby I may shortly see so many proofes, verses, and rithmes, with such histories, so many Orations, and volumes to his honor, that all these thinges, as well such as I cannot touch, as the rest which I mention and speake of, shall briefly be disciphered and liuely coloured foorth. For now to rehearse all the holy workes of our good Sheepheard, or to endeuour to set foorth that very patterne of a Bishop which he hath expressed in himself, to say trueth, I thinke vnpossible, and much lesse to beleeue that the very summarie of those things that he hath done may be drawne into any anales or chronicle. Neither can I cōceiue any meanes to attaine therto, vnlesse some one haue

in forme of remēbrances been dayly collecting the course of his deeds &amp; works. For my part in this short discourse that I haue to prosecute, as one not able to to restraine the whole sea, I will goe see if I may gather the water at the riuers and brookes from whēce this sea doth arise, that is, from his vertues, which in him haue wrought so many holy workes, notwithstanding I might at once in generall words say that all vertues beseeming a Bishop, which S. Paule and others doe speake of: were to be found in him. Helas how this holy Shepheard burned in loue, how hee made him selfe leane for you!The Wolf is dead, a

Ah, good GOD whereto are wee brought? What shall become of vs? If the infection doth afflict vs who shall pray for vs? Ah that we had not deserued it! Oh how God is wroth with vs! with many other exclamations sufficient to haue rent the Marble stones, and clouen the walles in sunder. Hee was a man of much prayer and reading, as euer was any, and in priuate behauiour had not his like. Two thinges there were that made him wonderfull wise: The one, he would in all affayres

heare counsayle: The other, hee had stil recourse to prayer. Truely he was as wise as holy, I confesse that in respect of his example onely I learned to vnderstand this place of S. Paule concerning his care of all the Churches. Quis infirmatur &amp; ego non infirmor: Quis scandalizatur, &amp; ego non vror? Who is weake and I am not sicke? Or who is offended and I burne not? And that which followeth. To bee briefe, toward the end of his dayes, and beeing hoare heared, hee conceiued two excellent imaginations: The one concerning that great and wonderfull Colledge that is now at buylding in your Roome, for the teaching (a wonderfull matter) of all Languages in the word: The other, the same which he propounded and began to put in execution touching the recouery of the goods of the Cath. Apost. Romish Church.Some Tra

of that innumerable gaine of soules, that through his subtilty he doth daily make.
            These were his last words when he left vs with the water in our eyes, and sorrow in our heartes, for the losse of a thing of so great value. Neuerthelesse, sith it is to no purpose to weepe, it resteth that wee doe two things: The one, that so much as in vs lyeth, we endeuour to reteyne those notable institutions, and walk in that path which he hath prescribed for vs: The other, that we haue recourse to God with prayer, that he will send vs a Successor worthy him, and that as Simplician succeded S. Ambrose: so to this Ambrose another Simplician in vertue and holinesse may succeede.
            This is that small matter, Oh blessed soule, which my foolish and vnmeete tongue is able this day to vtter of thee in middest of these sighes and lamentations. Now shall it cease: howbeit, at time conuenient, both this day and euer, my hart shall discourse of thee. Oh wretch that I am, O ye Romayne people, to whō hapneth still the contrary of that which happened to the Romaine Souldier, that

was wounded and maymed vpon one of his legs, at a certaine victory that he obteyned, for he sayd, that at euery steppe that he set, and vpon the least payne that he felt of his leg, he called to mynde the most honorable blason of his glory: but I contrariwise, in the least commendations that I may obteyne, shall thinke vpon my losses: For when so euer I shall boste, that I haue bene seruant to such a holinesse, &amp; so great a parsonage, I must necessarily withall remember what a good I am depriued of. Let vs therefore pray to our good GOD, that it may please him of his grace with his holy spirite to inspire the most reuerent Cardinals, the Electors of the holy Apost. and Roomish sea, to the end his holinesse successor, succeeding in the holy Sea, may likewise succeede in those vertues and holinesse, wherewith he was endued and replenished.
            AMEN.
