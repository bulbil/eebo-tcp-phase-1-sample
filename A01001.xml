            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

            THE WONDERFVLL DISCOVERIE OF THE Witch-craftes of Margraet and Phillip Flower
               ▪ Daughters of Ioan Flower, by BEAVER CASTLE, and executed at LINCOLNE the 11. of March. 1618.
            
               MY meaning is not to make any contentious Arguments about the discourses, distinction or definition of Witchcraft, the power of Diuells, the nature of Spirits, the force of Charmes, the secrets of Incantation, and such like; because the Scriptures are full of prohibitions to this purpose, and proclaimes death to the presumptuous attempters

of the same: Besides both Princes (yea our owne learned and most iudicious King) Philosophers, Poets, Chronologers, Historiographers, and many worthy Writers, haue concurred and concluded in this; that diuers impious and facinorous mischiefes haue beene effectuated through the instruments of the Diuell, by permission of God, so that the actors of the same haue carried away the opinion of the world, to doe that which they did by Witchcraft, or at least to be esteemed Witches, for bringing such and such things to passe: For howsoeuer the learned haue charactred delinquents in this kinde by titles of sundry sortes, and most significant attributes; as Pythonissae dealing with artificiall Charmes; Magi anciently reputed so, for extraordinary wisedome and knowledge in the secrets of simples and hearbes; Chaldei, famous for Astronomy and Astrology; Necromancers for practising to raise dead bodies, and by them to foretell euents of the earth; Geomantici, for conuersing with Spirits, and vsing Inchantations;

               Genethliaci, for presuming on the calculating of Natiuities, or if you will, assuming the credit of Figure-casting; Ventriloqui, for speaking with hollow voyces as if they were possessed with Diuells; Venefici, for dealing with Poyson, and either killing or curing that way: For you must vnderstand howeuer the Professors aforesaid practise murther and mischiefe, yet many times they Pretend cures and preseruation; with many others, carrying the shew of great learning and admired knowledge; yet haue they all but one familier tearme with vs in English called Witches. As for the conceit of wise-men or wise woemen, they are all meerely coseners and deceiuers; so that if they make you beleeue that by their meanes you shall heare of things lost or stolne, it is either done by Confederacy, or put off by protraction to deceiue you of your money.
            Only (as I said before) there bee certaine men and women growne in yeares, and ouer-growne with Melancholly and Atheisme, who out of a malicious disposition

against their betters, or others thriuing by them; but most times from a heart-burning desire of reuenge, hauing entertained some impression of displeasure, and vnkindnesse, study nothing but mischiefe and exoticke practises of loathsome Artes and Sciences: yet I must needes say, that sometimes the fained reputation of wisedome, cunning, and to be reputed a dangerous and skilfull person, hath so preuailed with diuers, that they haue taken vpon them indeed to know more then God euer afforded any creature, &amp; to performe no lesse then the Creator both of Heauen &amp; earth; making you beleeue with Medea, that they can raise tempests, turne the Sunne into blood, pull the Moone out of her Spheare, and saile ouer the Sea in a cockle shell, according to the Poet.
            
               
                  Flectere si nequeam Superos, Acheronta mouebo.
               
               
                  If Art doe faile to moue the Gods
                  consent vnto my minde:
                  I will the Diuells raise, to doe
                  what they can in their kinde.
               
            
            
               But howsoeuer speciall persons are transported with an opinion of their owne worth, and preuailing in this kinde, yet by lamentable experience we know too well, what monstrous effects haue bene produced, euen to the horror of the hearers, and damnation of their owne soules by such kinde of people: For as it is in the tale of the enuious man, that put out one of his eyes to haue his companion loose both; so fareth it with them and worse, to giue away their soules to bee reuenged of their aduersaries bodies, wherein the monstrous subtilty of the Diuell is so apparant, that it is wonderfull one way to relate, and lamentable another way to obserue the same. For no sooner shall such motiues poyson the inward conceite or apprehension of such damnable Caitiffes: But then steppeth forth the Diuell, and not onely sheweth them the way, but prescribeth the manner of effecting the same, with facility and easinesse, assuring that hee himselfe will attend them in some familiar shape of Rat, Cat, Toad,

Bird, Cricket, &amp;c: yea effectuate whatsoeuer they shall demaund or desire, and for their better assurance and corroboration of their credulity, they shall haue palpable and forcible touches of sucking, pinching, kissing, closing, colling and such like: wherevpon, without any feare of God or Man, knowledge of Christ, hope of redemption, confidence of mercy, or true beleefe that there is any other thing to bee looked after but this present World; according to that Athiesticall position of Epicurus.
            
            
               
                  Ede, bibe, lude, post mortem nulla voluptas.
               
               
                  Eat, drink, sport, play and take thy pleasures rest:
                  For after death, who knowes what shall be best.
               
            
            They admit of those execrable conditions of commutation of soules for the entertaining of the spirits, and so fall to their abhominable practises, continuing in the same till God laugh them to scorne, and will by no meanes suffer them to abuse his holy name nor deceiue others by their prophane liues

any longer: Witnesse for the generall those infinite Treatises of many of them conuinced by Law, and condemned to death, to the fearefull example of all carnall and hypocriticall Christians: but more especially you may ouer-looke (if you please) that learned Discourse of Daemonologie, composed in forme of a Dialogue, by the High and mighty Prince, IAMES by the grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, &amp;c. and printed (as I take it) according to the coppy of Edenburgh, 1603. As also a Treatise of Witch-craft made by that learned Mr. Alexander Roberts Preacher at Kings-Line in Norfolke, 1615. vpon the discouery of the Witch-crafts of Mary Smith, wife of Henry Smith Glouer, with her vocall contract betweene the Diuell and her selfe, in sollemne tearmes, and such like imposturing filthinesse: with many hurts and mischiefes which thereby she procured: As also a certaine discouery 1611. made by Iohn Cotta Doctor of Phisicke in Northampton of Empericks, woemen about sicke persons:

Quacksaluers, and fugitiues, which seeme to worke iuggling wonders, Surgeons, Apothecaries, practisers by spells, the true discouery of Witch-craft, especially in the sicke with many instances in that kind, Wisards, and seruants, of Phisitions, who may bee called ministring helpers: To this hee hath added the Methodian learned deceiuer, or hereticke Phisition, Astrologers, Ephemerides-maisters, Coniecters by vrine, Trauellers, and last of all, the true Artist his right description and election. As also a Dialogue concerning Witches and Witchcraft, composed by George Gifford, Minister of Gods word in Maldon, 1603. Wherein the cunning of the Diuell is discouered, both concerning the deceiuing of witches, and seducing of others into many great errors: As also an ancient discourse of the fearefull practises of foure notorious French Witches, with the manner of their strange execution. As also the seuerall and damnable practises of Mother Sutton of Milton Miles in the County of Bedford, and Mary Sutton her Daughter,

who were arraigned, condemned, and executed for the same: As also 1612. the wonderfull discouery of Witches in Lancashire, being 19. in number, notorious for many infamed actions, and conuicted before Sr. Iames Altham, and S. Edward Bromley, Barons of the Exchequer, together with the arraignment and triall of Iennet Preston, at Yorke, with her fearefull execution for the murthering of Mr. Lisker by Witch-craft; with infinite other relations concerning the generall conuiction of Witches, and their practises, and condemnation of the particular opinion of some men, who suppose there bee none at all, or at least that they doe not personally or truely effect such things as are imputed vnto them, and which out of some dangerous impression of melancholly, vaineglory, or some other diseased operation, they assume to themselues by reason of a former contract with the Diuell. And so much for the certainty of Story, and fearefulnesse of the truth concerning the damnable practises of Witches and cunning of the Diuell to deceiue them.
            
               But yet because the mind of man may be carried away with many idle coniectures, either that woemen confessed these things by extreami
                  •
               y of torture, or that ancient examples are by this time forgotten (although the particulars are vpon record, for the benefit of all posteritie:) Or that they were besides themselues, or subiect to some weake deuise or other, rather to bring in question the integrity of Iustice; then to make odious the liues of such horrible offendors. I haue presumed to present on the Stage of verity for the good of my Country &amp; the loue of truth, the late wofull Tragedy of the destruction of the Right Honourable the Earle of Rutlands Children, who to his eternall praise proceeded yet both religiously and charitably against the offenders, leauing their prosecution to the law and submitting himselfe, and deplorable case to the prouidence of God, who afflicteth his best seruants with punishments, and many times, sendeth extraordinary vengeance as well on the innocent, as the bad deseruer, to manifest his glory:

Therefore by way of Caution I aduise thee (gentle Reader) whosoeuer thou art, to take heede how thou doest either despise the power of God in his Creatures, or vilipend the subtilty and fury of the Diuell, as Gods instrument of vengeance, considering that truth in despight of gaine sayers will preuaile, according to that principle: Magna est veritas &amp; preualebit.
            
            
               The Story followes.
               AFter the Right Honourable Sr. Francis Manners succeeded his Brother in the Earledome of Rutland: and so not onely tooke possession of Beauer Castle, but of all other his demeanes, Lordships, Townes, Mannors, Lands, and Reuennues appropriate to the same Earledome: hee proceeded so honourably in the course of his life, as neither displacing Tenants, discharging seruants, denying the accesse of the poore, welcoming of strangers, and performing all the duties of a noble Lord, that

hee fastened as it were vnto himselfe the loue and good opinion of the Countrey wherein he walked the more cheerefully and remarkable, because his honourable Countesse marched arme in arme with him in the same race; so that Beauer Castle was a continuall Pallace of entertainment, and a daily receptacle for all sorts both rich and poore, especially such auncient people as neighboured the same; amongst whom one Ioane Flower, with her Daughters Margaret and Phillp were not onely relieued at the first from thence, but quickly entertained as Chair-women, and Margaret admitted as a continuall dweller in the Castle, looking both to the poultrey abroad and the wash-house within dores: In which life they continued with equall correspondency, till something was discouered to the noble Lady, which concerned the misdemeanour of these women. And although such honourable persons shall not want of all sorts of people, either to bring thē newes, tales, reports, or to serue their turne in all offices whatsoeuer; so that it may well

bee said of them, as it is of great Kings and Princes, that they haue large hands, wide eares, and piercing sights to discouer the vnswept corners of their remotest confines, to reach euen to their furthest borders, and to vnderstand the secrets of their meanest subiects: yet in this matter, neither were they busie-bodies, flatterers, malicious politians, vnderminers, nor supplanters one of anothers good fortune; but went simply to worke, as regarding the honor of the Earle and his Lady, and so by degrees gaue light to their vnderstanding to apprehend their complaints. First, that Ioane Flower the Mother was a monstrous malicious woman, full of oathes, curses, and imprecations irreligious, and for any thing they saw by her, a plaine Atheist; besides of late dayes her very countenance was estranged, her eyes were fiery and hollow, her speech fell and enuious, her de
                     •
                  eanour strange and exoticke, and her conuersation sequestred; so that the whole course of her life gaue great suspition that she was a notorious Witch, yea some of her

neighbours dared to affirme that shee dealt with familiar spirits, and terrified them all with curses and threatning of reuenge, if there were neuer so little cause of displeasure and vnkindnesse. Concerning Margaret, that shee often resorted from the Castle to her Mother, bringing such prouision as they thought was vnbefitting for a seruant to purloyne, and comming at such vnseasonable houres, that they could not but coniecture some mischiefe between them, and that their extraordinary ryot &amp; expences, tended both to rob the Lady, &amp; to maintaine certaine deboist and base company which frequented this Ioane Flowers house the mother, &amp; especially her youngest Daughter. Concerning Phillip, that she was lewdly transported with the loue of one Th: Simpson, who presumed to say,  that shee had bewitched him: for hee had no power to leaue her, and was as hee supposed maruellously altred both in m
                     ••
                  de and body, since her acquainted company: these complaints began many yeares before either their conuiction, or publique

apprehension: Notwithstanding such was the honour of this Earle and his Lady; such was the cunning of this monstrous woman in obseruation towards them; such was the subtilty of the Diuell to bring his purposes to passe; such was the pleasure of God to make tryall of his seruants; and such was the effect of a damnable womans wit and malitious enuy, that all things were carried away in the smooth Channell of liking and good entertainment on euery side, vntill the Earle by degrees conceiued some mislike against her; and so, peraduenture estranged himselfe from that familiaritie and accustomed conferrences hee was wont to haue with her: vntill one Peate offered her some wrong; against whom shee complained, but found that my Lord did not affect her clamours, and malicious information, vntill one Mr. Vauasor abandoned her company, as either suspicious of her lewd life, or distasted with his owne misliking of such base and poore Creatures, whom no body loued but the Earles

houshold; vntill the Countesse misconceiuing of her daughter Margaret, and discouering some vndecencies both in her life and neglect of her businesse, discharged her from lying any more in the Castle, yet gaue her 40. s. a bolster, &amp; a mattresse of wooll: commanding her to go home, vntil the slacknesse of her repayring to the Castle, as shee was wont, did turne her loue and liking toward this honourable Earle and his family into hate and rancor: wherevpon despighted to bee so neglected, and exprobrated by her neighbours for her Daughters casting out of dores, and other conceiued displeasures, she grew past all shame and Woman-hood, and many times cursed them all that were the cause of this discontentment, and made her so loathsome to her former familiar friends, and beneficiall acquaintance.
               When the Diuell perceiued the inficious disposition of this wretch, and that she and her Daughters might easily bee made instruments to enlarge his Kingdome, and bee as it were the executioners of his vengeance;

not caring whether it lighted vpon innocents or no, he came more neerer vnto them, and in plaine tearmes to come quickly to the purpose, offered them his seruice, and that in such a manner, as they might easily command what they pleased: For hee would attend you in such prety formes of dog, cat, or Rat, that they should neither be terrified, nor any body else suspicious of the matter. Vpon this they agree, and (as it should seeme) giue away their soules for the seruice of such spirits, as he had promised them; which filthy conditions were ratified with abhominable kisses, and an odious sacrifice of blood, not leauing out certaine charmes and coniurations with which the Diuell deceiued them, as though nothing could bee done without ceremony, and a solemnity of orderly ratification. By this time doth Sathan triumph, and goeth away satisfied to haue caught such fish in the net of his illusions: By this time are these women Diuels incarnate, and grow proud againe in their cunning and artificiall power, to doe what mischiefe they listed▪ By

this time they haue learnt the manner of inchantations, Spells and Charmes: By this time they kill what Cattle they list, and vnder the couert of flattery and familiar entertainment, keepe hidden the stinging serpent of mallice, and a venomous inclination to mischiefe: By this time is the Earle and his familie threatened, and must feele the burthen of a terrible tempest, which from these womens Diuellish deuises fell vppon him, hee neither suspecting nor vnderstanding the same: By this time both himselfe and his honourable Countesse, are many times subiect to sicknesse and extraordinary conuulsions, which they taking as gentle corrections from the hand of God, submit with quietnesse to his mercy, and study nothing more, then to glorifie their Creator in heauen, and beare his crosses on earth.
               At last, as mallice increased in these damnable Women; so his family felt the smart of their reuenge and inficious disposition. For his eldest Sonne Henry Lord

                  Rosse sickened very strangely, and after a while died: his next named Francis Lord Rosse accordingly, was seuerely tormented by them, and most barbarously and inhumanely tortured by a strange sicknesse; not long after the Lady Katherine was set vpon by their dangerous and diuellish practises, and many times in great danger of life, through extreame maladies and vnusuall fits, nay (as it should seeme, and they afterwards confessed) both the Earle and his Countesse were brought into their snares as they imagined, and indeed determined to keepe them from hauing any more children. Oh vnheard of wickednesse and mischieuous damnation? Notwithstanding all this did the noble Earle attend his Maiesty, both at New-market before Christmas, and at Christmas at Whitehall; bearing the losse of his Children most nobly, and little suspecting that they had miscarried by Witch-craft, or such like inuentions of the Diuell, vntill it pleased God to discouer the villanous practises of these Woemen, and to command the Diuell

from executing any further vengeance on innocents, but leaue them to their shames, and the handes of Iustice, that they might not onely be confounded for their villanous practises, but remaine as a notorious example to all ages of his iudgement and fury. Thus were they apprehended about Christmas, and carried to Lincolne Iayle, after due examination, before sufficient Iustices of the Peace, and discreete Maiestrates, who wondred at their audacious wickednes, but Ioane Flow
                        •
                     r the Mother before conuiction, (as they say) called for Bread and Butter, and wished it might neuer goe through her if she were guilty of that wherevpon shee was examined; so mumbling it in her mouth, neuer spake more wordes after, but fell downe and dyed as shee was carryed to Lincolne Goale, with a horrible excruciation of soule and body, and was buried at Ancaster.
               
               When the Earle heard of their apprehension, hee hasted downe with his brother Sr. George, and somtimes examining them himselfe, and sometimes sending them to others;

at last left them to the triall of Law, before the Iudges of assise at Lincolne; and so they were conuicted of murther and executed accordingly, about the 11. of March, to the terror of all the beholders, and example of such dissolute and abhominable Creatures, and because you shall haue both cause to glorifie God for this discouery, and occasion to apprehend the strangenesse of their liues, and truth of their proceedings: I thought it both meete and conuenient to lay open their own Examinations and Euidences against one another, with such apparrant circumstances, as doe not onely shew the cause of their mislike and distasting against the Earle and his family; but the manner of their proceedings and reuenges, with other particulars belonging to the true and plaine discouery of their villany and Witch-craft.

               Being examined concerning a Childe of Anne Stannidge, which shee was suspected to haue bewitched

               Being charged that shee bewitched Elizabeth Hough, the wife of William Hough to death, for that shee angred her in giuing her almes of her second bread; confesseth that she was angry with her and said she might haue giuen her of her better bread, for she had gone too often on her errands, but more she saith not.
               This Examinat confesseth that shee came to Ioane Gylles house, her child being sicke, and that shee intreated this Examinat to look on the Child, and to tell her whether it was forspoken or no, and

this Examinate said it was forspoken; but when the said child died she cannot tell.
               And being asked concerning Nortley carrying of his Child home vnto his owne house, where the said Anne Baker was, shee asked him, who gaue the said Child that loafe, he told her Anthony Gill, to whom this Examinate said, he might haue had a Child of his owne if hee would haue sought in time for it; which words she confessed shee did speake.
               Being blamed by Henry Milles in this sort: A fire set on you, I haue had two or three ill nights; to whom shee made answere, you should haue let me alone then, which shee confesseth.
               The said Anne Baker, March 2. 1618. confessed before Samuel Fleming Doctor of Diuinitie, that about 3. yeares agoe, shee went into Northamptonshire, and that at her comming back againe, one Peakes wife and Dennis his wife of Beluoyre told her that my young Lord Henry was dead, and that there was a gloue of the said Lord buried in the ground; and as that gloue did rot and wast, so did the liuer of the said Lord rot and wast.

               THis Examinat saith, that Ioane Flower told her that my Lord of Rutland had dealt badly with her and that they had put away her Daughter, and that although she could not haue her will of my Lord himselfe, yet she had spied my Lords Sonne and had stricken him to the heart. And she sai
                     •
                  h, that my Lords Sonne was striken with a white Spirit, and that shee can cure some that send vnto her, and that some reward her for her paines, and of some she taketh nothing.
               
                  She further saith, that vpon Fryday night last, her Spirit came to her and told her that there was a bad woman at Deeping who had giuen her soule to the Diuell: and that her said Spirit did then appeare vnto her in a more vgly forme then it had formerly done, and that it vrged her much to giue it something, although it were but a peece of her Girdle, and told her that it had taken great paines for her, but she saith that she would giue it nothing, and told it that she had sent it to no place but onely to see how my Lord Rosse did, and that her Spirit told her that he should doe well.
            
            
               
               The Examination of the said Ioan Willimott, taken the second day of March in the yeare abouesaid, before the said Alexander Amcots.
               
               THis Examinate saith, That shee hath a Spirit which shee calleth Pretty, which was giuen vnto her by William Berry of Langholme in Rutlandshire, whom she serued three yeares; and that her Master when hee gaue it vnto her, willed her to open her mouth, and hee would blow into her a Fairy which should doe her good; and that shee opened her mouth, and he did blow into her mouth; and that presently after his blowing, there came out of her mouth a Spirit, which stood vpon the ground in the the shape and forme of a Woman, which Spirit did aske of her her Soule, which shee then promised vnto it, being willed thereunto by her Master. Shee further confesseth, that shee neuer hurt any body, but did helpe diuers that sent for her,

which were stricken or fore-spoken: and that her Spirit came weekely to her, and would tell her of diuers persons that were stricken and forespoken. And shee saith, that the vse which shee had of the Spirit, was to know how those did which shee had vndertaken to amend; and that shee did helpe them by certaine prayers which she vsed, and not by her owne Spirit; neyther did she imploy her Spirit in any thing, but onely to bring word how those did which she had vndertaken to cure.
               And shee further saith, that her Spirit came vnto her this last night (as she thought) in the forme of a woman, mumbling, but she could not vnderstand what it said. And being asked whether shee were not in a dreame or slumber when shee thought shee saw it, shee said no, and that she was as waking as at this present.

               The Examination of Ioane Willimot of Goadby in the County of Leicester Widdow, taken the 17. of March, 1618▪ by Sir Henry Hastings Knight, and Samuel Fleming Doctor of Diuinitie, two of his Maiesties Iustices of the Peace of the said County of Leicester.
               
               SHe saith that she tould one Cookes wife of Stathorne in the said County Labourer, that Iohn Patchett might haue had his Child aliue, if he would haue sought forth for it in time, and if it were not death stricken in her wayes, and that Patchets wife had an euill thing within her, which should make an end of her, and that she knew by her Girdle.
               She saith further, that Gamaliel Greete of Waltham in the said County Shepheard, had a Spirit like a white Mouse put into him

in his swearing; and that if hee did looke vpon any thing with an intent to hurt, it should be hurt, and that hee had a marke on his left arme, which was cut away; and that her own spirit did tell her all this before it went from her.
               Further she saith, that Ioane Flower, Margaret Flower and shee, did meet about a weeke before Ioane Flowers apprehension, in Blackborrow-hill, and went from thence home to the said Ioan Flowers house, and there she saw two spirits, one like a Rat, and the other like an Owle; and one of them did sucke vnder her right eare, as shee thought: and the said Ioan told her, that her spirits did say that shee should neyther be hanged nor burnt.
               Further she saith, that the said Ioan Flower did take vp some earth and spet vpon it, and did worke it with her finger, and put it vp into her purse, and said though shee could not hurt the Lord himselfe, yet shee had sped his Sonne, which is dead.

               The Examination of Ellen Greene of Stathorne in the County of Leicester, taken the 17. of March 1618. by Sir Henry Hastings Kt: and Samuel Fleming D. of Diuinitie, two of his Maiesties Iustices of the Peace of his said County.
               SHee saith, that one Ioan Willimot of Goadby came about sixe yeares since to her in the Wowlds, and perswaded this Examinate to forsake God, and betake her to the diuel, and she would giue her two spirits, to which shee gaue her consent, and thereupon the said Ioan Willimot called two spirits, one in the likenesse of a Kitlin, and the other of a Moldiwarp: the first the said Willimot called pusse, the other hiffe, hiffe, and they presently came to her, &amp; she departing left them with this Examinate, and they leapt on her shoulder, and the kitlin suckt vnder her right eare on her neck, &amp; the Moldiwarp on the left side in the like place.

After they had suckt her, shee sent the Kitlin to a Baker of that Towne, whose name shee remembers not, who had called her Witch &amp; stricken her; and bad her said spirit goe and bewitch him to death: the Moldiwarpe shee then bad go to Anne Dawse of the same towne and bewitch her to death, because she had called this examinate witch, whore, jade, &amp;c. and within one fortnight after they both dyed.
               And further this Examinate saith, that she sent both her spirits to Stonesby, to one Willison a husbandman, &amp; Robert Williman a husbandmans sonne, and bad the Kitlin goe to Willison and bewitch him to death, and the Moldywarp to the other, and bewitch him to death, which they did; and within tenne dayes they dyed. These foure were bewitched while this Examinate dwelt at Waltham aforesaid.
               About three yeares since, this Examinate remoued thence to Stathorne, where she now dwelt: vpon a difference betweene the said Willimot and the wife of Iohn Patchet of the said Stathorne Yeoman, shee the said Willimot called her this Examinate to goe and touch

the said Iohn Patchets Wife and her Childe, which shee did, touching the said Iohn Patchets wife in her bed, and the childe in the Grace-wifes armes, and then sent her said spirits to bewitch them to death, which they did, and so the woman lay languishing by the space of a moneth and more, for then shee dyed; the childe dyed the next day after she touched it.
               And shee further saith, that the said Ioane Willimot had a spirit sucking on her, vnder the left flanke, in the likenesse of a little white Dogge, which this Examinate saith, that she saw the same sucking in Barley-haruest last, being then at the house of the said Ioan Willimot.
               
               And for her selfe, this Examinate further saith, that shee gaue her soule to the Diuell to haue these spirits at her command; for a confirmation whereof, she suffered them to suck her alwayes as aforesaid about the change and full of the Moone.

               The Examination of Phillip Flower, Sister of Margaret Flower, and Daughters of Ioane Flower, before Sr 
                  William Pelham, and Mr. Butler, Iustices of the Peace, Febr. 4. 1618. Which was brought in at the Assizes as euidence against her Sister Margaret.
               
               SHe saith, that her mother and her sister maliced the Earle of Rutland, his Countesse, and their Children, because her Sister Margaret, was put out of the Ladies seruice of Laundry, and exempted from other seruices about the house, wherevpon her said sister, by the commandement of her mother, brought from the Castle the right hand gloue of the Lord Henry Rosse, which she deliuered to her Mother; who presently rubd it on the backe of her Spirit Rutterkin, and then put it into hot boyling water, afterward shee pricked it often, and buried it in the yard, wishing the Lord Rosse might neuer thriue, and so her Sister Margaret continued with her mother, where shee often saw the cat Rutterkin leape on her shoulder, and sucke her necke.
               Shee further confessed, that shee heard her mother often curse the Earle and his Lady, and therevpon would boyle feathers and blood together, vsing many Diuellish speeches and strange gestures.
            
            
               
               The Examination of Margaret Flower, Sister of Phillip Flower▪ &amp;c. about the 22. of Ianuary. 1618.
               SHe saith and confesseth, that about foure or fiue yeare since her Mother sent her for the right hand gloue of Henry Lord Rosse, afterward that her mother bade her goe againe into the Castle of Beauer, and bring downe the gloue or some other thing of Henry Lord Rosse, and shee askt what to doe? Her Mother replyed to hurt my Lord Rosse: wherevpon she brought downe a gloue, and deliuered the same to her Mother, who stroked Rutterkin her Cat with it, after it was dipt in hot water, and so prickt it often, after which Henry Lord Rosse fell sicke within a weeke, and was much tormented with the same.
               She further saith, that finding a gloue about two or three yeares since of Francis Lord Rosse, on a dung-hill, she deliuered it to her mother, who put it into hot water, and after tooke it out and rubd it on Rutterkin the Cat, and bad him goe vpwards, and after her mother buried it in the yard, and said a mischiefe light on him, but he will mend againe.
               Shee further saith, that her Mother and shee, and her Sister agreed together to bewitch the Earle and his Lady, that they might haue no more children: and being demanded the cause of this their mallice and ill will; shee saith, that about foure yeares since

the Countesse (growing into some mislike with her) gaue her forty shillings, a bolster, &amp; a mattresse, and bad her lye at home, and come no more to dwell at the Castle; which she not onely tooke in ill part, but grudged at it exceedingly, swearing in her heart to be reuenged. After this, her Mother complained to the Earle against one Peake, who had offered her some wrong, wherein she conceiued that the Earle tooke not her part, as shee expected, which dislike with the rest, exasperated her displeasure against him, and so she watched an opportunity to bee reuenged: wherevpon she tooke wooll out of the said mattresse, and a paire of gloues, which were giuen her by Mr. Vauasor, and put them into warme water, mingling them with some blood, and stirring it together, then she tooke the wooll and gloues out of the water, and rubd them on the belly of Rutterkin her Cat, saying the Lord and the Lady should haue more Children, but it would be long first.
               Shee further confesseth, that by her mothers commandement, shee brought to her a peece of a handkercher of the Lady Katherine the Earles daughter, and her mother put it into hot water, &amp; then taking it out, rubd it on Rutterkin, bidding him flye, and go; wherevpon Rutterkin whined and cryed Mew: whereupon shee said, that Rutterkin had no power ouer the Lady Katherine to hurt her.
            
            
               
               The Examination of Phillip Flower, the 25. of February, 1618. before Francis Earle of Rutland, Francis Lord Willoughby of Ersby, Sr. George Manners, and Sr. William Pelham.
               
               SHee confesseth and saith, that shee hath a Spirit sucking on her in the forme of a white Rat, which keepeth her left breast, and hath so done for three or foure yeares, and concerning the agreement betwixt her Spirit and her selfe, she confesseth and saith, that when it came first vnto her, shee gaue her Soule to it, and it promised to doe her good, and cause Thomas Simpson to loue her, if shee would suffer it to sucke her, which shee agreed vnto; and so the last time it suckt was on Tuesday at night, the 23. of February.
               
            
            
               
               The Examination of Margaret Flower, at the same time, &amp;c.
               SHee confesseth, that she hath two familiar Spirits sucking on her, the one white, the other black spotted; the white sucked vnder her left brest, and the blacke spotted within the inward parts of her secrets. When shee first entertained them she promised them her soule, and they couenanted to doe all things which she commanded them▪ &amp;c.
               Shee further saith, that about the 30. of Ianuary, last past, being Saturday, foure Diuells appeared vnto her in Lincolne layle, at eleauen or twelue a clocke at midnight: The one stood at her beds feete, with a blacke head like an Ape, and spake vnto her; but what, shee cannot well remember, at which shee was very angry because hee would speake no plainer, or let her vnderstand his meaning: the other three were Rutterkin, Little Robin, and Spirit; but shee neuer mistrusted them, nor suspected her selfe, till then.
            
            
               There is another Examination of the said Margaret Flower, taken the fourth of February, 1618. tending to this effect.
               THat being asked what shee knoweth concerning the bewitching of the Earle of Rutland, his wife, and children, shee saith, that it is

true, that her selfe, her mother, and sister were all displeased with him, especially with the Countesse, for turning her out of seruice, wherevppon some foure yeare since, her mother commanded her to goe vp to the Castle, and bring her the right hand gloue of the Lord Henry Rosse, the Earles eldest sonne; which gloue she found on the rushes in the Nurcery, and deliuered the same to her Mother, who put it into hot water, prickt it often with her knife, then tooke it out of the water, and rubd it vppon Rutterkin, bidding him height and goe, and doe some hurt to Henry Lord Rosse, wherevpon hee fell sicke, and shortly after dyed, which her Mother hearing of, said it was well: but after shee had rubd the gloue on the Spirit Rutterkin, shee threw it into the fire and burnt it, &amp;c.
            
            
               THese Examinations and some others were taken and charily preserued for the contriuing of sufficient euidences against them, and when the Iudges of Assise came downe to Lincolne about the first weeke of March, being Sr. Henry Hobert, Lord chiefe Iustice of the Common Pleas, and Sr. Ed: Bromley one of the Barons of the Exchequer, they were presented vnto them, who not only wondred at the wickednesse of these persons, but were amazed at their practises and horrible contracts with the Diuel to damne their own soules: And although the Right Honorable Earle had sufficient griefe for the losse of his Children; yet no

doubt it was the greater to consider the manner, and how it pleased God to inflict on him such a fashion of visitation: Besides, as it amazed the hearers to vnderstand the particulars, and the circumstances of this diuellish contract, so was it as wonderfull to see their desperate impenitency, and horrible distraction, according to the rest of that sort, exclaiming against the Diuell for deluding them, and now breaking promise with them, when they stood in most need of his helpe.
               Notwithstanding all these aggrauations, such was the vnparalleld magnanimity, wisedome, and patience of this generous Noble-man, that hee vrged nothing against them more then their owne confessions, and so quietly left them to iudiciall triall, desiring of God mercy for their soules, and of men charity to censure them in their condemnation: but God is not mocked, and so gaue them ouer to iudgement, nor man so reformed, but for the Earles sake, they cursed them to that place which they themselues long before had bargained for.
               What now remaines (gentle Reader) but for thee to make vse of so wonderfull a Story, and remarkable an accident, out of which, to draw to a conclusion, thou maist collect these particulars. First, that God is the supreame commander of all things, and permitteth wonderfull actions in the World, for the tryall of the godly, the punishment of the wicked, and his owne glory: of which man shall neuer attaine to know the reason or occasion. Secondly, that the Diuell is the meere seruant and

agent of God, to prosecute whatsoeuer hee shall command rather then giue leaue vnto; limiting him yet thus farre in his owne nature, that he can go no further then the bounds within which hee is hedged. Thirdly, that this God hath punishments, ad correctionem, that is to say, chasticements of the godly, &amp; ad rui
                        ••
                     m, Videlicet, Iudgements against the wicked, wherein yet man must disclaime any knowledge, and forsake preiudicate opinions. For the very iust shall be tried like gold, and no man exempted from castigation whom God doth loue. Fourthly, that this Diuell, though he bee Gods Instrument, yet worketh altogether by deceit: for as hee was a lyer from the beginning; so let no man trust him, because he aymeth at the confusion of all Mankinde. Fiftly, that the wicked, (howeuer they may thriue and prosper for a time) yet in the end are sure to be payed home, either with punishment in this life or in the life to come, or both, as a finall reward of monstrous impiety. Sixtly, that Man in his frailty must not presume of prosperity; but prepare a kinde of stooping vnder the hand of God, when it pleaseth him to strike or punish vs. Seauenthly, that there is no murmuring nor repining against God, but quietly to tolerate his inflictings, whensoeuer they chance, of which this worthy Earle is a memorable example to all men and Ages. Eightly, that the punishments of the wicked are so many warnings to all irregular sinners to amend their liues, and auoid the iudgement to come, by penitency and newnesse of life. Ninthly, that

though man could bee content to passe ouer blasphemies and offences against the Statutes of Princes, yet God will ouertake them in their own walks, and pull them backe by the sleeue into a slaughter-house, as here you know the euidences against these people tooke life and power from their owne Confessions. Tenthly, and last of all, that priuate opinion cannot preuaile against publique censures: for here you see the learned and religious Iudges cryed out with our Sauiour, Ex ore tuo. Therefore though it were so, that neither Witch nor Diuell could doe these things, yet Let not a Witch liue, saith God, and Let them dye (saith the Law of England) that haue conuersation with spirits, and presume to blaspheme the name of God with spels and incantation. O then you sonnes of men, take warning by these examples, and eyther diuert your steps from the broad way of destruction, and inrecouerable gulph of damnation, or with Iosuahs counsell to Achan, blesse God for the discouery of wickednesse, and take thy death patiently, as the preuention of thy future iudgement, and sauing innocents from punishment, who otherwise may be suspected without a cause.
               Vtinam tam facile vera inuenire possem, quam falsa conuincere.
