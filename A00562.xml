            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

                  To the right Honorable my very good Lord and Master, EDWARD DEVERE Earle of Oxenford, Vicount Bulbeck, Lord of Escales and Badlesmere, and Lord great Chamberlaine of England, IOHN FARMER wisheth long life, health and happinesse with encrease of honour.
                  
                     MOst Honorable Lord, it commeth not within the compasse of my power to expresse all the duty I owe, nor to pay the least part: so farre haue your Honorable fauours outstripped all meanes to manifest my humble affection, that there is nothinge left but praying and wondering. There is a canker worme that breedeth in manie mindes, feeding onelie vppon forgetfulnes, and bringing forth no birth but ingratitude: to shew that I haue not beene bitten with that monster, for wormes prooue monsters in this age, which yet neuer any Painter could counterfait to expresse the vglines, nor any Poet describe to decipher the highth of their ilnes: I haue presumed to tender these Madrigales onlie as remembrances of my seruice and witnesses of your Lordships liberall hand, by which I haue so long liued, and from your Honorable minde that so much haue loued all liberall Sciences: in this I shall be most encouraged, if your Lordship vouchsafe the protection of my first fruites, for that both for your greatnes you best can, and for your iudgement in Musicke best may: for without flattrie be it spokē, those that know your Lordship know this, that vsing this science as a recreation, your Lordship haue ouergone most of them that make it a profession. Right Honorable Lord, I hope it shall not be distastfull to number you heere amongst the fauourers of Musicke, and the practisers, no more then Kings and Emperours that haue beene desirous to be in the roll of Astronomers, that being but a starre faire, the other an Angels Quire. Thus most humbly submitting my selfe, my labours, and what euer is or may bee in me, to your Lordships censure &amp; protection: I humbly end wishing your Lordship as continuall an increasing of health and honor, as there is a daylie encrease of vertue, to come to happines.
                  
                     Your Honors most dutifull seruant to command IOHN FARMER.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                  To the Reader.
                  
                     THe present age beeing so bewtified with excellent Poets and adorned with rare Musitions, amongst whome some by publike writings make an eliphant of a mouse: other by strange Paradoxes striue to attaine preheminence: I haue thought good amongst the rest, being as vertuously ambitious as any, to expose my selfe to the world, cloathing my infant in humility, not ostentation, striuing so farre to auoyde a peremptory opinion of mine owne witte, as I take it▪ 
                     
                        •
                     n honor for mee to ascribe the little I deserue rather to the master that taught mee, then mine owne diligence that formed and fashioned my Muses: onely this I protest for my selfe, that I haue studied so much as in me lieth to obserue a true decorum, which protestation I shall suppose for an indecorum also before it be ratified by your allowance and fauors. Yet in these my Madrigales I beseech you esteeme this, that I haue not enforced the one to the other, but so fitly haue I linkt my Musicke to number, as each giue to other their true effect, which is to mooue delight, which delight, as Socrates witnesseth in Platoes Philebo, is the daughter of Harmony. This vertue beeing so singular in the Italians, as onely vnder that ensigne they hazard their honor: I could aduise the studious in Musicke so to imploy themselues, that they might seeme to be rightly borne vnder the sweete aspect of Venus, which, as the Astronomers witnesse, is the Dominatrix in Musitians natiuities: it is the onely grace in a Musitian to follow this course, so to fitte both note and number as if like Twinnes of one mother, they may seeme to be all one which yeeldeth great abundance of variety. To conclude, I so much loue perfect harmony, as I earnestly entreate all the professed in Musicke to fly discord amongst themselues: though in composing of songes, it may be well taken, beseeching them so farre to fly selfe-opinion also, that ayming all of them at their Countries honor, not their owne glory, they may by this meanes and in this manner outstrip any straunger, and make England as famous in Musitions, as it is and hath beene for soldiers: so leauing my labors to your fauourable iudgement, to keepe secret what may be amisse. I take heartie leaue.

                  To the right Honorable my very good Lord and Master, EDWARD DEVERE Earle of Oxenford, Vicount Bulbeck, Lord of Escales and Badlesmere, and Lord great Chamberlaine of England, IOHN FARMER wisheth long life, health and happinesse with encrease of honour.
                  
                     MOst Honorable Lord, it commeth not within the compasse of my power to expresse all the duty I owe, nor to pay the least part: so farre haue your Honorable fauours outstripped all meanes to manifest my humble affection, that there is nothinge left but praying and wondering. There is a canker worme that breedeth in manie mindes, feeding onelie vppon forgetfulnes, and bringing forth no birth but ingratitude: to shew that I haue not beene bitten with that monster, for wormes prooue monsters in this age, which yet neuer any Painter could counterfait to expresse the vglines, nor any Poet describe to decipher the highth of their ilnes: I haue presumed to tender these Madrigales onlie as remembrances of my seruice and witnesses of your Lordships liberall hand, by which I haue so long liued, and from your Honorable minde that so much haue loued all liberall Sciences: in this I shall be most encouraged, if your Lordship vouchsafe the protection of my first fruites, for that both for your greatnes you best can, and for your iudgement in Musicke best may: for without flattrie be it spokē, those that know your Lordship know this, that vsing this science as a recreation, your Lordship haue ouergone most of them that make it a profession. Right Honorable Lord, I hope it shall not be distastfull to number you heere amongst the fauourers of Musicke, and the practisers, no more then Kings and Emperours that haue beene desirous to be in the roll of Astronomers, that being but a starre faire, the other an Angels Quire. Thus most humbly submitting my selfe, my labours, and what euer is or may bee in me, to your Lordships censure &amp; protection: I humbly end wishing your Lordship as continuall an increasing of health and honor, as there is a daylie encrease of vertue, to come to happines.
                  
                     Your Honors most dutifull seruant to command IOHN FARMER.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                  To the Reader.
                  
                     THe present age beeing so bewtified with excellent Poets and adorned with rare Musitions, amongst whome some by publike writings make an eliphant of a mouse: other by strange Paradoxes striue to attaine preheminence: I haue thought good amongst the rest, being as vertuously ambitious as any, to expose my selfe to the world, cloathing my infant in humility, not ostentation, striuing so farre to auoyde a peremptory opinion of mine owne witte, as I take it an honor for mee to ascribe the little I deserue rather to the master that taught mee, then mine owne diligence that formed and fashioned my Muses: onely this I protest for my selfe, that I haue studied so much as in me lieth to obserue a true decorum, which protestation I shall suppose for an indecorum also before it be ratified by your allowance and fauors. Yet in these my Madrigales I beseech you esteeme this, that I haue not enforced the one to the other, but so fitly haue I linkt my Musicke to number, as each giue to other their true effect, which is to mooue delight, which delight, as Socrates witnesseth in Platoes Philebo, is the daughter of Harmony. This vertue beeing so singular in the Italians, as onely vnder that ensigne they hazard their honor: I could aduise the studious in Musicke so to imploy themselues, that they might seeme to be rightly borne vnder the sweete aspect of Venus, which, as the Astronomers witnesse, is the Dominatrix in Musitians natiuities: it is the onely grace in a Musitian to follow this course, so to fitte both note and number as if like Twinnes of one mother, they may seeme to be all one which yeeldeth great abundance of variety. To conclude, I so much loue perfect harmony, as I earnestly entreate all the professed in Musicke to fly discord amongst themselues: though in composing of songes, it may be well taken, beseeching them so farre to fly selfe-opinion also, that ayming all of them at their Countries honor, not their owne glory, they may by this meanes and in this manner outstrip any straunger, and make England as famous in Musitions, as it is and hath beene for soldiers: so leauing my labors to your fauourable iudgement, to keepe secret what may be amisse. I take heartie leaue.

                  To the right Honorable my very good Lord and Master, EDWARD DEVERE Earle of Oxenford, Vicount Bulbeck, Lord of Escales and Badlesmere, and Lord great Chamberlaine of England, IOHN FARMER wisheth long life, health and happinesse with encrease of honour.
                  
                     MOst Honorable Lord, it commeth not within the compasse of my power to expresse all the duty I owe, nor to pay the least part: so farre haue your Honorable fauours outstripped all meanes to manifest my humble affection, that there is nothinge left but praying and wondering. There is a canker worme that breedeth in manie mindes, feeding onelie vppon forgetfulnes, and bringing forth no birth but ingratitude: to shew that I haue not beene bitten with that monster, for wormes prooue monsters in this age, which yet neuer any Painter could counterfait to expresse the vglines, nor any Poet describe to decipher the highth of their ilnes: I haue presumed to tender these Madrigales onlie as remembrances of my seruice and witnesses of your Lordships liberall hand, by which I haue so long liued, and from your Honorable minde that so much haue loued all liberall Sciences: in this I shall be most encouraged, if your Lordship vouchsafe the protection of my first fruites, for that both for your greatnes you best can, and for your iudgement in Musicke best may: for without flattrie be it spokē, those that know your Lordship know this, that vsing this science as a recreation, your Lordship haue ouergone most of them that make it a profession. Right Honorable Lord, I hope it shall not be distastfull to number you heere amongst the fauourers of Musicke, and the practisers, no more then Kings and Emperours that haue beene desirous to be in the roll of Astronomers, that being but a starre faire, the other an Angels Quire. Thus most humbly submitting my selfe, my labours, and what euer is or may bee in me, to your Lordships censure &amp; protection: I humbly end wishing your Lordship as continuall an increasing of health and honor, as there is a daylie encrease of vertue, to come to happines.
                  
                     Your Honors most dutifull seruant to command IOHN FARMER.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                  To the Reader.
                  
                     THe present age beeing so bewtified with excellent Poets and adorned with rare Musitions, amongst whome some by publike writings make an eliphant of a mouse: other by strange Paradoxes striue to attaine preheminence: I haue thought good amongst the rest, being as vertuously ambitious as any, to expose my selfe to the world, cloathing my infant in humility, not ostentation, striuing so farre to auoyde a peremptory opinion of mine owne witte, as I take it an honor for mee to ascribe the little I deserue rather to the master that taught mee, then mine owne diligence that formed and fashioned my Muses: onely this I protest for my selfe, that I haue studied so much as in me lieth to obserue a true decorum, which protestation I shall suppose for an indecorum also before it be ratified by your allowance and fauors. Yet in these my Madrigales I beseech you esteeme this, that I haue not enforced the one to the other, but so fitly haue I linkt my Musicke to number, as each giue to other their true effect, which is to mooue delight, which delight, as Socrates witnesseth in Platoes Philebo, is the daughter of Harmony. This vertue beeing so singular in the Italians, as onely vnder that ensigne they hazard their honor: I could aduise the studious in Musicke so to imploy themselues, that they might seeme to be rightly borne vnder the sweete aspect of Venus, which, as the Astronomers witnesse, is the Dominatrix in Musitians natiuities: it is the onely grace in a Musitian to follow this course, so to fitte both note and number as if like Twinnes of one mother, they may seeme to be all one which yeeldeth great abundance of variety. To conclude, I so much loue perfect harmony, as I earnestly entreate all the professed in Musicke to fly discord amongst themselues: though in composing of songes, it may be well taken, beseeching them so farre to fly selfe-opinion also, that ayming all of them at their Countries honor, not their owne glory, they may by this meanes and in this manner outstrip any straunger, and make England as famous in Musitions, as it is and hath beene for soldiers: so leauing my labors to your fauourable iudgement, to keepe secret what may be amisse. I take heartie leaue.

                  To the right Honorable my very good Lord and Master, EDWARD DEVERE Earle of Oxenford, Vicount Bulbeck, Lord of Escales and Badlesmere, and Lord great Chamberlaine of England, IOHN FARMER wisheth long life, health and happinesse with encrease of honour.
                  
                     MOst Honorable Lord, it commeth not within the compasse of my power to expresse all the duty I owe, nor to pay the least part: so farre haue your Honorable fauours outstripped all meanes to manifest my humble affection, that there is nothinge left but praying and wondering. There is a canker worme that breedeth in manie mindes, feeding onelie vppon forgetfulnes, and bringing forth no birth but ingratitude: to shew that I haue not beene bitten with that monster, for wormes prooue monsters in this age, which yet neuer any Painter could counterfait to expresse the vglines, nor any Poet describe to decipher the highth of their ilnes: I haue presumed to tender these Madrigales onlie as remembrances of my seruice and witnesses of your Lordships liberall hand, by which I haue so long liued, and from your Honorable minde that so much haue loued all liberall Sciences: in this I shall be most encouraged, if your Lordship vouchsafe the protection of my first fruites, for that both for your greatnes you best can, and for your iudgement in Musicke best may: for without flattrie be it spokē, those that know your Lordship know this, that vsing this science as a recreation, your Lordship haue ouergone most of them that make it a profession. Right Honorable Lord, I hope it shall not be distastfull to number you heere amongst the fauourers of Musicke, and the practisers, no more then Kings and Emperours that haue beene desirous to be in the roll of Astronomers, that being but a starre faire, the other an Angels Quire. Thus most humbly submitting my selfe, my labours, and what euer is or may bee in me, to your Lordships censure &amp; protection: I humbly end wishing your Lordship as continuall an increasing of health and honor, as there is a daylie encrease of vertue, to come to happines.
                  
                     Your Honors most dutifull seruant to command IOHN FARMER.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                  To the Reader.
                  
                     THe present age beeing so bewtified with excellent Poets and adorned with rare Musitions, amongst whome some by publike writings make an eliphant of a mouse: other by strange Paradoxes striue to attaine preheminence: I haue thought good amongst the rest, being as vertuously ambitious as any, to expose my selfe to the world, cloathing my infant in humility, not ostentation, striuing so farre to auoyde a peremptory opinion of mine owne witte, as I take it an honor for mee to ascribe the little I deserue rather to the master that taught mee, then mine owne diligence that formed and fashioned my Muses: onely this I protest for my selfe, that I haue studied so much as in me lieth to obserue a true decorum, which protestation I shall suppose for an indecorum also before it be ratified by your allowance and fauors. Yet in these my Madrigales I beseech you esteeme this, that I haue not enforced the one to the other, but so fitly haue I linkt my Musicke to number, as each giue to other their true effect, which is to mooue delight, which delight, as Socrates witnesseth in Platoes Philebo, is the daughter of Harmony. This vertue beeing so singular in the Italians, as onely vnder that ensigne they hazard their honor: I could aduise the studious in Musicke so to imploy themselues, that they might seeme to be rightly borne vnder the sweete aspect of Venus, which, as the Astronomers witnesse, is the Dominatrix in Musitians natiuities: it is the onely grace in a Musitian to follow this course, so to fitte both note and number as if like Twinnes of one mother, they may seeme to be all one which yeeldeth great abundance of variety. To conclude, I so much loue perfect harmony, as I earnestly entreate all the professed in Musicke to fly discord amongst themselues: though in composing of songes, it may be well taken, beseeching them so farre to fly selfe-opinion also, that ayming all of them at their Countries honor, not their owne glory, they may by this meanes and in this manner outstrip any straunger, and make England as famous in Musitions, as it is and hath beene for soldiers: so leauing my labors to your fauourable iudgement, to keepe secret what may be amisse. I take heartie leaue.
