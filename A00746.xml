            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

                  A BRIEFE AND SUMMARIE DECLARATION OF THE PROPHECIES of the old and the new Teſtament, ſo far as they concerne the calling of the IEWES.
                  
                     THE inuiſible things of God, that are to bee ſeene in all his workes, ſhine moſt cleerly in the Church. Wherein, as Dauid ſaith, Pſal. 29. 9. he vttereth all his glory. But aboue all, the Church of the Iewes carrieth the liuely print and marke of his praiſes. What things did he for them? Nay, what did he not in Aegypt, and at the red ſea, in the wilderneſſe, and Land of promiſe, when they were in Babylon, the ſeuenty yeeres captiuity, and after, by ſending of his Son among them?
                  Theſe things were the firſt act (as a man may call it) of the great and glorious workes of God toward that nation.
                  But the Cataſtrophe, or ſhutting vp, is no leſſe, if not much more, to be admired: How, for refuſing Chriſt, that came into the world, to ſaue them, and ſhamefully nayling him vpon the Croſſe, they are become a renegate people, now 1600 yeeres together, without Church, without Common-wealth, without forme, or face of gouernment, good or bad: their pleaſant land turned into a wilderneſſe: their fruitfull Countrey, into a dry and barren Deſert. How,

for all that, he leaueth them not without comfort. Nay, he lifteth vp their hearts with a certaine expectation of moſt high and ample promiſes. Such and ſo great as are altogither incredible, but that the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it. Some of the choiſe and principall, not following Iewiſh fables, but the vndoubted Oracles of the word of God, it ſhall not be amiſſe, before we proceede further, to lay downe in certaine Aphoriſmes or Poſitions. Which may all be reduced into fiue heads.

                  The truth of ech poſition, I will not here ſtand to diſcuſſe. This Treatiſe following (where they are noted in the margent) doth aboundantly proue them all.
                  The time drawing neere, wherein theſe things fore-told ſo long before, come now to be accompliſhed, how ſweet a thing it is, to looke into the propheſies that giue aſſurance of it.
                  May it therefore pleaſe the iudicious and learned Reader, to weigh the Scriptures following: which proſeſſedly, and of purpoſe, ſpeake of theſe things. Some in plaine and

euident termes, other more obſcurely, but all layd together, caſt ſuch a light, as leaue this doctrine without exception. But before we enter vpon the particular Texts, take ſome few rules, for the better vnderſtanding of the propheſies of this kinde: Aſwell touching the threatned deſolation, as for the conuerſion of this people, and the enemy that ſhall fall before them.
                  1. The deſolation ſpoken of, Cities without inhabitant, houſes without men, the land deſolate, Eſay 6. 11. The mountaines, hils, riuers, valleyes, waſte. Ezech. 36. 4. No King, no Prince, no forme, or face of Church, or Common-wealth, good or bad, and that for many dayes, Hoſh. 3. 4. Were neuer before, but now are truely verified in the height of them, ſome 1600 yeeres together, ſince they reiected Chriſt.
                  2. Though the Prophets, when they handle theſe things, thunder againſt the ſins of their owne age, that is, but to note the Iuſtice of the future deſolation: for God is righteous to puniſh in the children, their fore-fathers faults, when they walke in the ſame ſteps of diſobedience, Eſay 14. 21. Touching their conuerſion.
                  1. Where Iſrael, Iudah, Tſion, Ieruſalem, &amp;c. are named in this argument, the Holy Ghoſt meaneth not the ſpirituall Iſrael, or Church of God collected of the Gentiles, no nor of the Iewes and Gentiles both (for each of theſe haue their promiſes ſeuerally and apart) but Iſrael properly deſcended out of Iacobs loynes.
                  The ſame iudgement is to bee made of their returning to their land and ancient ſeates, the conqueſt of their foes, the fruitfulnes of their ſoile, the glorious Church they ſhall erect in the land it ſelfe of Iudah, their bearing rule farre and neere. Theſe and ſuch like are not Allegories, ſetting forth in terrene ſimilitudes or deliuerance through Chriſt (whereof thoſe were types and figures) but meant really and literally of the Iewes. It was not poſſible to deuiſe mote expreſſe or euident tearmes, then the Spirit of purpoſe vſeth to cut off all ſuch conſtruction. Neither were

                     Ioſias or Cyrus more plainely named hundred of yeares before they were borne, then theſe things are plainely deliuered for the confirming of that peoples faith. Wherefore wee need not be afraid to averre and mainteyne, that one day they ſhall come to Ieruſalem againe, be Kings and chiefe Monarches of the earth, ſway and gouerne all, for the glory of Chriſt that ſhall ſhine among them. And that is it Lactantius ſaith, Lib. 7. Cap. 15. The Romane name (I will ſpeake it, becauſe it muſt one day be) ſhall bee taken from the earth, and the Empire ſhall returne to Aſia, and againe ſhall the Eaſt beare dominion, and the Weſt bee in ſubiection.
                  
                  2. Such promiſes of the Goſpell as come in order after that deſolation, or after mercy to be ſhewed to the gentiles, are without queſtion to be referred to theſe times.
                  3. Nay, generally all Euangelicall promiſes made vnto them, ſeeing they neither at the firſt receiued the goſpell, nor euer hitherto enioyed that peace, plenty, and proſperity, which the promiſes doe purport, cannot but aime at ſomwhat that is yet to come.
                  4. The great and glorious things, which in the height and excellency thereof, are ſpoken peculiarly to them, doe in their meaſure and degree, appertaine in common to all the faithfull. And ſo in the new Teſtament, are ordinarily applyed: Whereof ſee more in this treatiſe following vpon Eſay, 54.
                  5. Their conuerſion vnto Chriſt in the laſt dayes, commonly is intimated by turning from Idolatrie. Which howſoeuer the Iewes be not now infected with, (if you ſpeake of bowing to ſtockes and ſtones) was then the maine ſinne of the times. And taketh vs forth this worthy leſſon that it is meere Idolatrie, and a worſhip of falſe Gods, whatſoeuer worſhip looketh not to God in Chriſt, which Iohn alſo teacheth. 1 Ioh. 5. 20. 21. When hauing laide down the doctrin, that Ieſus Chriſt is the true God, and life euerlaſting, immediately he addeth, Little children keepe your ſelues from Idols. This rule for the expoſition of the

Prophets, I learne of the Apoſtle, Rom. 11. 27. vouching Eſay 27. 9. (which ſpeaketh of their caſting away of Idols) as a principall place to warrant the calling of the Iewes.
                  6. Albeit the thorow comming in of the Gentiles, for all nations with one conſent to receiue Chriſt, be put off to the Iewes conuerſion, yet that nothing hindreth but the places that ſpeake of the ſame, may well ſerue to warrant the firſt inceptions of their calling. And ſo doth Iames cite them. Act. 15, 16, 17. out of Amos cap. 9. 11, 12. and Paul, Rom. 9. 25, 26. out of Hoſea Chap. 1. 10.
                  7. The conuerſion of the Gentiles, is many times intimated by the Iſraelites maiſtring of them, poſſeſſing them for ſeruants, and for handmaides as Eſay, 14. 2. Amos 9. 12. Obadiah, verſ. 19. Which is not meant ſo much of a temporall ſubduing, as of a ſpirituall ioyning with them, in ſeeking of the Lord; yet ſo as the chiefe ſoueraigntie and ſtroke of keeping men within the liſts of their ſubiection and obedience vnto Chriſt, ſhall remaine among the Iewes. And ſo Iames teacheth vs to expound thoſe phraſes, Act. 15. 17. Where that which Amos ſaith, that they (the Iſraelites) may poſſeſſe the remnant of Edom, Iames rendreth, that the reſidue of men may ſeeke after the Lord.
                  
                  The enemy whom indeed they ſhall conquer, roote out, and deſtroy, after they haue groaned long vnder his hard yoke and bondage, is not alwaies repreſented by one and the ſame name. But ſometimes more obſcurely, by one or other of the capitall enemies of Gods people, Moab, Edom, Rabba, that is to ſay, the Ammonites, Aſshur, 
                     Eſay 25. 10. 
                     Iauan; whether becauſe the holy Ghoſt would thereby Eſay 34. 5. 6. &amp; 63. note the cancred malice of that tyrant to the Church: or Pſal. 110. 6. that thoſe which inhabit the ſeat of theſe people, ſhall ioyn Eſa. 30. 31. &amp; 31. 8. hands and fall in the ſame deſtruction. Hoſh. 13. 13. (compared with Hoſh. 14. 3.)
                  
                  Sometimes his qualities and conditions paint him out: Leuiathan, a Serpent, a Dragon, Eſay 27. 1. Somtimes you haue him more plainely decyphered, either by the countrey from whence he deriueth his pedegree. Gog of the land 
                     Mica. 5. 5. 6. 
                     Zach. 9. 13.
                     
                     of Magog, Ezech. 38. 2. or elſe by his territorie and dominion, the King of the North. Dan. 11. 40. the Dragon which is in the ſea, Eſa. 27. 1. But by all theſe names, one and the ſame enemy is vnderſtood, which marueylouſly cleereth the place in Ezechiel, chap. 38. 17. where the Lord by his Prophet ſpeaketh to Gog in this wiſe; Art thou hee of whom I haue ſpoken in ancient time, by my ſeruants the Prophets of Iſrael which prophecied in thoſe dayes and yeares. Hee can not moane himſelfe nor Daniel, which was but one of his age, much leſſe Zacharie that came after, but hee meaneth the ancient Prophets long before, who ſpake of the ſame perſon, though not by the ſame name.
                  Theſe things premiſed, we come now to the particulars, wherein my meaning is, not to open euery hard word, or darke and obſcure phraſe, much leſſe to endeauour in euery place a full expoſition of the text, That muſt bee had from other the godly and learned interpreters. But only to point at the heads of thoſe Scriptures, and that but ſo farre as they concerne the thing wee deale with, to lead vs by the hand in the diſcouery of this heigh and heauenly ſecret, for that name the Apoſtle giueth it, Rom. 11. 25. The reader that would profit thereby, I deſire to haue the text before him as hee goeth. The comparing whereof, will bring great light to things that otherwiſe may ſeeme obſcure, and that he be not deceiued in the chapters, and verſes, I follow not (where any difference is) the Hebrew, but number them as they are in the Engliſh tranſlation.
                  
                     
                        Balaams Propheſie, Numb. 24. 14. to the laſt verſe of the Chapter.
                     
                     THE Spirit of God that ſate in the mouth of this wicked man, maſtring and ouer-ruling his tongue, to ſpeake things tending heighly to Gods praiſe, and the comfort of his people, doth heere vtter a Prophecie of the kingdome of Chriſt, to be ſet vp among the Iewes in the latter end of the world. It is (for the maine matter) one 6 Poſit. Laſt dayes.
                        
entire prophecie: but broken off by ſeuerall proems. The ſumme of all is: that the Iewes ſhall deſtroy their enemies, But themſelues muſt before that, endure a long and tedious Verſ. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. 19 20. 21. &amp; 1 part of 22. &amp; part of verſe 22. thraldome: Notwithſtanding which, God in the end will ſet them free, giue them a great and glorious victory, that the tyrant, who keepeth them in ſubiection, ſhall vtterly be deſtroyed.
                     1. Wherein obſerue the time, verſ. 17. I ſee it (that 
                        verſ. 23. 24. 
                        which I am to ſay) but not now: I behold it, but not neere. How is that? He ſpake it plainer, verſ. 14. I will tell thee what this people ſhall doe to thy people in the laſt dayes. By which notation of time, theſe things that were to come ſo long after, are wont ordinarily to be expreſſed, Ezech. 38. 16. 8. Eſay, 24. 22. This being the laſt and vttermoſt period, of whatſoeuer the Scriptures doe foretell; for hitherto and no further, reach the holy Oracles of the Prophets, Reu. 10. 7. and 16. 17. So this Prophecie can not bee drawen to Dauids temporall kingdome.

Enemies ſubdued. at that conuerſion, which ſhall bee of the Gentiles, when the Iewes returning to ſeeke Chriſt, ſhall ſubdue and bring vnder his yoke, all nations that doe oppoſe, as Eſay 11. 14. Ioel: 3. 19. Obadia verſ. 18. Zack. 10. 11. To wit Moab, Edom, Amalek, Midian, noted by the Kenites, and by Kaine, the firſt father of that kindred.

                     This Prophecie then, being of the Iewes, of the deſtruction of their foes, and that in the laſt dayes, note in the fourth place he ſpeaketh of bearing rule, of a Scepter 18 Poſit. Conqueſt. or a kingdome, before which the enemies ſhall all fall, as it is ſaid, Dan. 2. 44. It ſhall deſtroy and conſume all other kingdomes, but it ſelfe ſhall ſtand for euer. And againe, Dan. 7. 9. I ſaw till the thrones were taken away. Which euidently pointeth at the glory and greatnes of the Church that ſhall be among them.
                     
                        
5. Is enterlaced their owne ſore bondage, which ſhall be in the meane time, for the ſecond part of the 22. verſe, I read interrogatiuely, by an admiration, and apoſtrophe, or turning of his ſpeach vnto the Iſraelites. How long ſhall Aſhur hold thee (ô Eber, of whom he ſpeaketh immediatly in the verſes following, and whoſe troupes and ſquadrons were then before his eyes) captiue? Notwithſtanding, all the glory and happines that I now foretell, vnder the name of Aſhur (then, in Balaams time the ſoueraigne Monarch, and the firſt who in truth deuoured Iſrael) comprehending the whole ſucceſſion of Tyrants euen to this day, who conſume his very bones, as Ieremie ſpeaketh, Ier. 50. 17. Wherupon ſixtly, hee breaketh forth into a lamentation, and yet triumphing in the end.
                     
                        Alas, who ſhall liue, when the mighty God ſhall order this, that ſhippes from the coaſt of Cittim ſhall euen afflict Aſhur who afflicted Eber, and alſo he ſhall for euer periſh.
                     
                     Hee that ſhall thus periſh, is not Eber, or the Iew as 18 Poſit. Conqueſt. ſome Interpreters of great note would haue it, (for that croſſeth the whole ſcope of Balaams Prophecie) but it is the people that afflicted Eber, and conſequently, this is a prohecie of the kingdome of the Iewes, who ſhall maiſter and ouercome that people, which is enough for our purpoſe. But yet in ſo difficult a piece of Scripture, wherein euery man is to haue his iudgement free, giue me leaue to doe my beſt, to bring ſome further light vnto it, firſt I hold it for certaine, that this is a Prophecie of the laſt condition of the Iewes, and of the affliction mentioned. Dan. 12. 1. Eſay 26. 20. The lamentation in the Preface, and the deſtruction of that oppreſſing people in the percloſe or concluſion, ſeeme to make that very euident, which being ſo, it cannot be vnderſtood of the Greeke or Romane army, much leſſe reſtrayned vnto Aſhur properly called, whoſe glory fell in Senacharib ſo many yeares agoe: But in this 16 Poſit. Sore diſtreſſe. place is ſpecially meant of him, who laſt of all the tyrants ſhall ſo oppreſſe Gods heritage, that is to ſay, the Turke. Next by ſhips, that ſhall come from the coaſt of Cittim or

Cilicia, I vnderſtand the tribes tranſplanted into the cities of the Medes, 2 King, 17. 6. who out of thoſe northerne climats, ſhall make their paſſage to Iudaea for their returne from the North is ſpecially promiſed: Ier. 3. 12. This aagreeth the better, becauſe the word Iſim, (which is ſhips) ſignifieth alſo men that dwell in farre remote places, Eſay 23. 13. Pſal. 72. 9.
                     Thirdly, the words which are commonly tranſlated, ſhall afflict Aſhur and afflict Eber, I render thus, ſhall euen afflict Aſhur, who afflicted Heber.
                     
                     This vſe of the particle van, (and) to take it for the relatiue, who you ſhall finde Eſay 49. 7. and elſ-where: and is an Hebraim, which Luke himſelfe, whoſe ſtyle is after the pure phraſe of the moſt elegant Graecians, doth not make nice to follow, Act. 6. 6.
                     Laſtly, the holy Ghoſt ſeemeth heere to point at the two ſteps of the Turkes ruine.
                     The firſt, when tidings from the Eaſt, and from the North, ſhall trouble him, Dan. 11. 44. which is his firſt declyning, that is meant in ſaying, They ſhall afflict Aſhur.
                     
                     The other his vtter and vnrecouerable downefall; when planting his Tabernacle in the glorious mount of holines, he ſhall come to his end, and none ſhall help him, Dan. 11. 45. This you haue in the laſt words: And alſo that people (that is to ſay, Aſhur) ſhall for euer periſh.

Yet when I conſider all the circumſtances and the waight of euery word, day of his wrath, daſhing to peeces of Kings, iudging the Heathen, filling the places with dead carcaſes, daſhing in peeces the head,

                         I am drawne to beleeue that hereby is meant the deſtruction of ſome one grand enemie that ſhall dominere ouer Gods people, and be ſubdued in the laſt dayes by the beleeuing Iewes: whereupon Chriſt is ſaid to lift vp his head in victorie and in triumph. And hereunto the very order of the Pſalme may lead vs, that ſpeaketh of theſe things in time after the Iewes conuerſion. So doth the phraſe of breaking of the head. Which as it is elegantly vſed to note a thorough conqueſt, ſo ſecretly it ſeemeth to point at the Grand Signior himſelfe. And (erets rabba) which we tranſlate great Countries, the Pſalmiſt taketh vp of purpoſe, cloſely and couertly vnder an ambiguous kinde of ſpeech, to intimate the Land of Rabba, the cheife Citie of the Ammonites, which Dauid conquered, 2 Sam. 12. thereby vnderſtanding theſe enemies of Gods people Gog and Magog, as they are elſe where vnder the name of Moab and Edom, the Ammonites coſin germanes.
                     Such doubtfull ſpeeches that carie a currant and cleare meaning, and yet haue an other thing infolded, which time

and euent of the Prophecies will reueale, the ancient Prophets delighted to vſe. As that good Father Iacob, Gen. 48. 22. I giue thee one portion aboue thy brethren, one hill or piece of ground more then they. But the word is Sechem, or City of the Sechemites, which was the floure of the porcion aſſigned to the houſe of Ioſeph. So Eſay 11. 1. A graffe ſhall grow out of the rootes of Iſhai.

                     Theſe three chapters are all of one argument. The 18. verſe, which the Apoſtle 1 Cor. 1. 10. applieth to the times of the Goſpell, is a key to open the ſenſe and vnderſtanding of them.
                     Firſt, you haue the generall propoſition. He that maketh ſuch waſte and hauocke of Gods people, the Iewes, 18. Poſit. Conqueſt.

                     Which propoſition is inlarged by a prayer of the whole Church, that in ſo perilous a time, wherein all humane helpe ſhall faile, God would be an arme of defenſe for 18. Poſit. Conqueſt.

                     The former comprehendeth the Iewes extremities, and Gods ſetting of them free.
                     Their extremities:
                     1. No peace to be had at their enemies hands, what equall conditions ſoeuer they do propound. Which ſhall 16. Poſit. Sore diſtreſſe.
                         make euen the valianteſt among them (him whoſe heart is as the heart of a Lion) to weepe bitterly, (verſ. 7.) and all trauailing to and fro to ceaſe, (verſ. 8.)
                     2. The country ſhall lye all waſte, verſ. 9. for though I doe not denie but the Prophet might frame the mould of his ſpeech by the things that fell out when Senacharib ſo dominierd ouer Gods heritage: yet I hold this to be a prophecie not an hiſtorie, and to reſpect that ſore time of affliction Dan. 12. 1. for the auerting whereof it cannot be thought but the Iewes will ſeeke all meanes that may be of peace and quietneſſe, which the proud Turke will ſcorne and ſet at naught, as that Tyrant did, to bring iudgement vpon his owne head.

                         of them free, ruining their foes, is verſ. 10. 11, 12.

                         ſhall they neede to ſtand in feare of ſuch or the like any more. (verſ. 18, 19.)
                     5. The excellencie of the Church (verſ. 20.) by reaſon of Chriſts dwelling there. (verſ. 21, 22.)
                     6 The fruit and benefit that ſhall come to euery one, euen the ſeelieſt and meaneſt. (verſ. 23, 24.)
                     The ruine and ouerthrow of their enemies (which commeth in the ſecond place) is Chap. 34. In it you haue a 18 Poſit. Conquest.
                         terrible and fearefull iudgement, both againſt their perſons (verſ. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.) and the Land it ſelfe for their ſake. (verſ. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.) All confirmed from the moſt certaine and inviolable decree of God the Father, Sonne, and Holy Spirit. (verſ. 16, 17.)
                     In the third place Chap. 35. is declared the excellencie of Chriſts kingdome, that ſhall then be ſet vp among the Iewes. Wherein theſe ſix things are reckoned vp.
                     1. The making of all things new both the ſenceleſſe creatures, (verſ. 1, 2.) and men, (verſ. 3, 4, 5. &amp; 1. part of verſ. 6.) vttered by hyperbolicall &amp; exceſſiue ſpeeches. 36 Poſit. Spirituall graſes.

                     THe 40th Chapter propoundeth comfort thorough the promiſes of God in Chriſt to his people the Iewes, after thoſe long and tedious calamities which they had endured in the Babylonian captiuitie, and the hard times that followed after. (verſ. 1, 2.)
                     The parts of it are,
                     1. The miniſterie of Iohn Baptiſt a Cryar to prepare his way. (verſ. 3, 4, 5.)
                     2. The Apoſtolicall miniſterie of all the Preachers of the Goſpell, teaching repentance (verſ. 6, 7, 8.) and faith in Chriſt. (verſ. 9.)
                     3. The generall adminiſtration of Chriſts kingdome, ſubduing rebels, (verſ. 10.) and moſt kindly entreating his. (verſ. 11.)
                     4. Euangelicall promiſes particular to the ſeede of Iacob, which becauſe they are of a high and marueylous nature, firſt he layeth the ground of them, by the conſideration of the nature of God the Creator. (verſ. 12. to the end of the Chap.) and of his ſpeciall fauours to Abraham and all the Church. (Chap. 41. to the 15. verſ.)
                     
                     Secondly, he commeth to the promiſes themſelues, being of two ſorts.
                     1. The power of God in their weakneſſe to throw downe all that ſhall oppoſe. (verſ. 15, 16.) 18 Poſit. Conqueſt.

                         Spirit which he will beſtow. (verſ. 17, 18, 19, 20.)
                     Thirdly, he amplifieth and confirmeth the ſame by three arguments.
                     One is by oppoſing to Idols that are able to do nothing (verſ. 21, 22, 23, 24.) the Church of the Iewes, that making

                     A ſecond argument is by oppoſing to the ſame Idols, Chriſt, the wiſedome of God and the power of God, in whom God alone worketh all that hath beene ſaid, after his owne pleaſure. (verſ. 26, 27.)
                     The third argument is by remouing all other meanes whatſoeuer. (verſ. 28, 29.)
                     
                        Read verſe 27. thus.

                        Eſay, chap. 42.
                     THe 42th chapter firſt deſcribeth the gracious and ſweete cariage of Chriſt (verſ. 1, 2, 3, 4.) in the office enioyned him or his Father, (verſ. 5, 6, 7.) being one God with the Father, (verſ. 8) and the onely Prophet that from the beginning hath reuealed to the Church whatſoeuer is or ſhall be. (verſ. 9.)
                     Secondly, all nations of the world are herevpon inuited to celebrate Gods praiſes, (verſ. 10, 11, 12.) the Prophet reciting what wonderfull workes God will doe in their behalfe. (verſ. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17) Wherefore this ſecond part belongeth to the calling of the Gentiles.
                     The third part toucheth the Iewes. It expreſſeth firſt the hardnes of their heart and vnbeleefe, [verſ. 18, 19, 20.] 2 Poſit. Reiection.
                         (notwithſtanding all the mercy they were formerly vouchſafed, God hauing loued them and taken delight in them, giuen his law vnto them, and done

moſt great and glorious things for their ſakes) (verſ. 21.) which vnbeleefe of theirs ſhall draw vpon their head moſt 4. Poſit. Deſolation.
                         heauy indgements. (verſ. 22, 23, 24, 25.) Secondly, their conuerſion and turning vnto God, (chap. 43. 1.) whereupon 5. Poſit. Call.
                         followeth Gods wonderfull care ouer them in foure ſteps or degrees.
                     1. Protection, in the middeſt of their greateſt dangers. (verſ. 2.)
                     2. Bringing of other nations vnder their dominion. 45. Poſit. Nations honouring of them.
                         
                        (verſ. 3. 4.)
                     3. The gathering of them out of all quarters, whether they were diſperſed, Eaſt, Weſt, North, &amp; South. (ver. 5. 6) 23. Poſit. Dwelling in their country.

                        (verſ. 8.)
                     All which things being to come ſo long after, and wherof all the world is not able before hand to ſignifie any one, (verſ. 9.) are verified by the moſt ſacred teſtimony of God the Father in his Sonne. (verſ. 10. 11. 12. 13.)
                     
                        Read thus, Verſe 21.
                        
                           The Lord delighted in him for his righteouſneſſe ſake: hee magnîfied him by the Law, hee made him honourable. Verſ. 22.

                     IN this Text you haue the ſumme of all that followeth, to the end of the book. The two firſt verſes (verſ. 14. 15) ſpeake of the returne of the Iewes out of the Captiuitie of Babell, and are explicated in the 44. 45, 46. 47. and 48, chapters. Thereſt of the chapter, from the 16. verſe to the 21. verſe of the 44. chapter, is all of Euangelicall promiſes to that people, explicated in the 49. and the chapters following. The promiſes in this chapter are;
                     1. Gods making of a path in the Sea, meaning (as I conceiue) the drying vp that ſhall be of the Riuer Euphrates, 13 Poſit. Euphrates dry.

                     3. Which for the greatneſſe and nouelty of the worke may worthily obſcure and blot out the memory of former acts: (verſ. 18. and the firſt part of the 19.) the watering of the dry and barren Deſert with the dew of his grace, (the ſecond

                        part of verſ. 19. and verſ. 20.) that is, the framing and faſhioning of this people (ſo long caſt off) anew to the honour and praiſe of God, (verſ. 21.) whoſe gracious and mercifull dealing in this behalfe is garniſhed and ſet forth two manner of waies.
                     1. Notwithſtanding they ſerued not the true God (for God is not worſhipped but in Chriſt) (verſ. 22. 23. 24) yet he onely for himſelfe, that is for his goodneſſe ſake, will haue mercy on them. (verſ. 25.)

                     4. A fourth and laſt promiſe is, the ioyning of other 44. Poſit. All Nations embracing Chriſt.
                         Nations vnto them, in the ſocity of the Goſpell: whereby is intimated the full comming in of the Gentiles. (ver. 5.)

                     IT deſcribeth the calling of Chriſt from all eternity to the Office of Mediation, (verſ. 1. 2.) and the benefit that ſhall thereby redound to others; both the offer of ſaluation to the Iewes (verſ. 3.) and vpon their refuſall (verſ. 4. 5) the calling of the Gentiles. (verſ. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13.) And laſtly, that the Iewes themſelues after a long deſolation, (verſ. 14.) ſhall be thought vpon: (verſ. 15.) wherefore 4. Poſit. Deſolation.

                        Eſay, Chapter 50. and 51.
                     THe parts of this Propheſie are three.
                     In the firſt, Chriſt ſheweth the Iewes diuorce, and Gods caſting of them off, to be moſt iuſt, and their owne 2. Poſit. Reiection.
                         fault in refuſing him. (verſ. 1.) 1. Poſit. Refuſing Chriſt.
                        
                     
                     In the ſecond, he wondreth that his own people ſhould ſet him ſo light, (1. part of verſ. 2.) ſeeing hee is as able as euer hee was to helpe them, (2 part of verſ. 2. and verſe 3.) and as ready, being furniſhed of his Father with all needfull graces, fulneſſe of the ſpirit, and powerfull doctrine: (verſ. 4.) obedience, (verſ. 5.) patience, (verſ. 6.) and conſtancie, (verſ. 7.) and laſt his cauſe being ſo good and iuſt, (verſ. 8. 9.)
                     In the third part hee turneth his ſpeech to the Iewes. wherein;
                     1. He quickneth the poor remnant, ſuch among them them as ſhould receiue Chriſt (verſ. 10.) 3. Poſit. Remnant.
                        
                     
                     2. Hee pronounceth againſt thoſe that refuſe Chriſt, ſentence of obduration from God. (verſ. 11.) 2. Poſit. Reiection.
                        
                     
                     3. By the example of his mercies to Abraham &amp; Sara, from whom they were deſcended, (chap. 51. verſ. 1. 2.) hee 5. Poſit. Call.
                         doth aſſure them that hee will comfort and conuert their 31 Poſit. Glorious Church.
                         ſoules, (1. part of verſ. 3.) which conuerſion is ſet out by the excellency and happineſſe of it, (2. part of verſ. 3.) and in that it ſhall draw with it the full comming in of the Gentiles. 44 Poſit. All nations embracing Chriſt.
                         
                        (verſ. 4. 5.)
                     4. He promiſeth the deſtruction of their enemies, who 18. Poſit. Conqueſt.
                         being ſo powerfull and mighty, and ſo ſharpe ſet againſt them, hee vſeth many arguments to hearten and encourage the Iewes, that they ſhould not be afraid.
                     Firſt Argument, God will diſſolue heauen and earth, (verſ. 6.) Why then ſhould they feare? (verſ. 7.) for he can much more make the enemies of the Church to melt before his face. (verſ. 8.)
                     Second Argument, is from the power of God in himſelfe,

and from his owne mighty and outſtretched arme. (1. part of verſ. 9.)
                     Third Argument from former examples. His iudgements vpon Pharaoh and the Land of Egypt, (2. part of verſ. 9.) and the drying vp of the red Sea for the people to paſſe. (verſe 10) The like whereof he will doe for the redemption of the Iewes, when they ſhall returne to Tſion. 13 Poſit. Euphrates dry.
                         
                        (verſ. 11.)
                     Fourth Argument from the nature of God our Comforter. (verſ. 12.)
                     Fifth Argument from his mighty &amp; powerfull workes, who made heauen and earth, (1. part of verſ. 13.) bridleth the furie of the wicked, that their hands are able to doe nothing, (2. part of verſ. 13. and verſ. 14.) and ſtilleth the raging Sea. (verſ. 15.)
                     Sixth Argument from his word and couenant with this people. (verſ. 16.)
                     Seuenth Argument by comparing the former tyrannizing of their enemies, (verſ. 17. 18. 19. 20.) with Gods gracious deliuerance of them. (verſ. 21. 22. 23.)
                  
                  
                     
                        Eſay, Chapter 52. to the 13. verſe.
                     
                     THis Chapter (if it be a ſeuerall Sermon of it ſelfe, and not a part of the former) is all in promiſes to the people of the Iewes.
                     Firſt is the freeing of them from the tyranny of their enemies: 18. Poſit. Conqueſt.
                         to wit, Gog and Magog, (verſ. 1. 2. 3.) which is amplified by ſetting before them the like examples of Gods former mercies. The Aegyptians, ſaith hee, whether the people went downe to ſoiourne, cauſeleſly oppreſſed them, and I ſet them free. So if the Aſſyrians, that is to ſay, the Babilonians. (verſ. 4.) The like will I doe to theſe oppreſſors. (verſ. 5.)
                     The ſecond promiſe is, the communication of the 5. Poſit. Call.
                         knowledge of Iehouah Chriſt, the ſpeaker or Interpreter of his Fathers will. (verſ. 6.)
                     
                        
Thirdly, the ioy and cheerfulneſſe of the Church of the 37. Poſit. Cheerefull obedience.
                         Iewes receiuing the Goſpell of peace, the Goſpell of the Kingdome. (verſ. 7. 8. 9.)
                     Fourthly, the large ſpread of the Goſpell throughout the world. (verſ. 10.) 44 Poſit. All Nations embracing Chriſt.
                        
                     
                     Fifthly, the ſanctitie of the new Ieruſalem. (verſ. 11.)
                     Sixtly, their ſafety and ſecurity through Gods protection, in a more glorious ſort then when they came out of Aegypt. 33. Poſit. Sanctity.
                         
                        (verſ. 12.) 41. Poſit. Safety of the Church.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     
                        Eſay, Chapter 54.
                     THE barren one whom the Prophet addreſſeth his ſpeech vnto, is the Church of the Iewes in their deſolation. 4. Poſit. Deſolation.
                         For firſt, the fourth verſe ſpeaketh of her widdowhead, as of one that once had beene a Church, but now diuorced, as chap. 50. 1 More plainely in the ſixt verſe ſhee is termed a wife forſaken, and the wife of the youth; none of which agree eyther to the Church of the Gentiles, or the Catholike Church: ſecondly, in the 11. verſe ſhee is ſayd to be humbled, toſſed, not comforted: how fitting is that to their eſtate? Thirdly, the glorious things verſe. 11. 12. &amp;c. are neuer ſpoken, but of their Church renued. But how then doth the Apostle Gal. 4. 26. 27. Make vs Gentiles children of this Church, and calleth the ſame Ieruſalem aboue? Rightly is ſhee called Ieruſalem aboue, the ſpirituall and heauenly Ieruſalem, caſt into a new mould, and framed and faſhioned from aboue to embrace Chriſt, and to ſeeke righteouſneſſe, peace, and reconciliation through him alone, whoſe children are free: by oppoſition to thee then Ieruſalem, that ſought righteouſneſſe and life by the Law, and therfore engendred children vnto bondage And this new Ieruſalem is indeed the mother of vs all. Why? for it is the ſame very Church, and no other, poliſhed, fined, and wonderfully adorned, which was in the time of the Apoſtles, when the Law that is the doctrine of Iesus Chriſt, which is the Goſpell, came out of Sion, and the Word
                        
                        of the Lord out of Ieruſalem, That whoſoeuer will be ſaued, muſt acknowledge himſelfe a childe of this Mother, Reuelat. 22. 22.
                     This doubt cleered, the reſt of the chapter hath no difficultie: there be in it promiſes of three kindes.
                     1. Fruitfulneſſe of the Church. (verſ. 1. 2. 3.) 38. Poſit. Multitude of belieuers.
                        
                     
                     2. Gods Couenant with them of remiſſion of ſinnes, (verſ. 4.) reconciliation, (verſ. 5. 6.) and life euerlaſting. (verſ. 7. 8. 9. 10.) 35. Poſit. Couenant.

                         layd in the calling and annointment of Chriſt vnto his office of teaching and comforting Gods people, (chap. 61. verſe. 1. 2. firſt part of verſ. 3.) is wholly ſpent in the fruit and benefit that thence ſhall redound to the Iewes. It ſtandeth of two parts. Firſt is a particular enumeration of the fauours that God will beſtow vpon them: all which may be reduced to two heads. Bleſſings vpon themſelues, and the deſtruction of their capitall enemy.
                     The bleſſings vpon themſelues are theſe that follow:

of the Goſpell through Chriſt; (verſ. 4.) for ſo doth Paul 1 Cor. 2. 9. expound this place of the wiſedome of God reuealed in the Goſpel, not of the heauenly glory. This ſuite they confirme and giue aſſurance to their ſoules of the obtayning of it, by conſidering the mercy of God towards repentant ſinners, deſirous to walke in a new courſe of righteouſneſſe, (1. part of verſ. 5.) and the profeſſion of their owne true repentance; (2 part of verſ. 5. &amp; verſ. 6, 7.) whereupon they reſort againe to the ſumme of their former petition.

Laſtly, this whole matter is ſhut vp with declaration of the end of all theſe things: to wit, Gods glory, (verſ. 21. to the end of the chapter.)
                     
                     After the defeat of Gog and Magog, commeth in the laſt eight chapters, a new prophecy, aptly depending vpon the former, concerning the Chriſtian Iewiſh Church, ſetled in their owne land and Country, which is the fourth and laſt ſtep. Chriſt, the builder of his temple, appearing in the forme of a man, like poliſhed ſhining braſſe, to prefigure the ſplendor of that Church. No maruell then if ſo great a matter require ſuch a vehement and ſolemn charge to ſtirre vp the Prophet vnto attention. Sonne of man. ſee with thine eyes, and heare with thine eares, and ſet thine heart vpon all which I ſhall ſhew thee. Hardly in the whole booke of God ſhall you finde ſuch an other. (chap. 40. 1. 2. 3. 4.)
                     The thing it ſelfe is thus expreſſed:
                     1. There ſhall a new Church be erected by the preaching of the Goſpell: which the meaſuring of the houſe, 7. Poſit. Generall call.

But both theſe meaſurements, and whatſoeuer followeth touching the diuiſion of the land, the ſeates of the Tribes, the portions allotted to the Prince, Prieſts, and Leuites, the manner of their ſacrifices and oblations, or all new, varying from that which is in Moſes (though for their weakeneſſe by thoſe outward things hee ſhadoweth heauenly) to ſhew the abrogating of the legall ceremonies.
                     2. The Lord who had left the Temple and the Citie, Ezech. 10. doth now return, and filleth this houſe with the 31. Poſit. Glorious church
                         glory of his preſence (chap. 43. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.)
                     3. The ſanctitie of the Church purged from Idolatry, Superſtition, and Will-worſhip. They ſhall not, ſaith he, 34. Poſit. Puritie.
                         defile my houſe any more with their ſpiritual whoredoms, nor with the carcaſſes of their Kings in their high places (that is the ſacrifices of mans fleſh, as Ieremy 16. 18. which they offered to Moloch, Leuit. 18. 21. whom they called their King, Amos 5. 56. after the manner of the Ammonites,

whoſe Idoll it was) and ſo by their owne iniquities making a wall of ſeparation betweene me and them. (Chap. 43. 6, 7, 8, 9.)
                     And this ſanctitie of the Church he doth afterwards inlarge by the types of the ceremoniall ſeruice. (Chap. 43. 10. to the end of the Chapter.)
                     
                     4. The refining of the miniſterie and diſcipline of the Church, with the ſame charge in regard of the excellencie 33 Poſit. Sanctitie.
                         of the matter, repeated for attention. (chap. 44. 1. to ver. 17.) and lawes preſcribed to that purpoſe. (verſ. 17. to the end of the Chapter.)
                     
                     5. Prouiſion for the Church-ſeruice. Which this people ſhall be moſt zealous of. Allotting before any divident of the land, a portion to be ſet apart for the houſe of the Lord, the Prieſts, the Leuites, the people, &amp; the Prince. (chap. 45. 1. to verſ. 9.) That both Prince &amp; people might haue whereof to make oblations, (verſ. 9, 10, 11, 12.) with lawes alſo concerning theſe matters. (verſ. 13. to the end of the Chapter.)
                     
                     6. The fruitfulnes of the land, by the waters flowing 36 Poſit. Spirituall graces.
                         aboundantly out of the Temple, that is, by the bleſſing of God dwelling among them. Wherein is ſet forth,
                     1. The riſing and increaſe of theſe waters (figuring the graces of Gods Spirit in his Church). Firſt, ancle-deepe, then vp to the knees, after to the loynes, laſtly not paſſable. A man might ſwim in them. (Chap. 47. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
                     2. This bleſſing ſhould be ouer all the land. for The waters ſhould iſſue vnto Galilee, (the vpper part of Iudaea) and ſo go downe into the plaine, where Iericho ſtood. (verſ. 6, 7. &amp; 1 part of 8.)
                     3. The fruit hereof is ſingular. It bringeth life, health, and all good things: it healeth and putteth away all euill.

                     THe fourth kingdome is the Romane Empire, whoſe leggs are of iron. (verſ. 40.)
                     The feete and toes part of iron and part of clay, (verſ. 41, 42, 43.) are the Roman Empire yet continuing; but weaker then it was before, whileſt it conſiſted of leggs of iron, being now but of feet and toes. And this Empire is diuided, as the feet and toes are. One part is the kingdom of the Pope in the Weſt (for he is the 7th head of the beaſt Rev. 17. 10, 11. He whom we call the Emperor, hath nothing to do with the Empire, which was of Rome). The other part is the Turke in the Eaſt, before whom 3 of the hornes of the Empire are rooted out. See Dan. 7. 8. It is euident that theſe feete and toes are part of the Romane Empire: for the Image deſcribeth onely 4. Kingdomes.

But if the feete and toes were a diſtinct kingdome from the leggs, there ſhould be fiue.
                     The kingdome raiſed vp in thoſe dayes, which ſhall 46 Poſit. Enemies ſubdued.
                         not be deſtroyed for euer, but ſhall deſtroy all other kingdomes, is the kingdome of the Iewes. (verſ. 44, 45.)
                     Whoſe Church is the ſtone hewen out of the mountaine without hands. Till which time the Romane Empire ſhall endure, and then wholly be deſtroyed.
                  
                  
                     
                        Chap. 7.
                     THE 4 beaſts (verſ. 3.) are 4 kingdomes, as it is expounded verſ. 17. whereof, The firſt beaſt a Lion, is the kingdome of the Aſſyrians, extinct, and gone before Daniel ſaw the Viſion. (verſ. 4)
                     The ſecond a Beare, is the Perſian Monarchie. (v. 5.)
                     The third, a Leopard, the Greeke Monarchie or the Kingdome of the Macedonians. (verſ. 6.)
                     The fourth is, the Romane Empire: whoſe X. hornes (verſ. 7.) are 10 kingdomes not diuers from that of the beaſt. For then there ſhould be 5. Kingdomes, contrary to that is ſaid here verſ. 17. And theſe 10 Kingdomes are the 10 hornes of the Dragon. Rev. 12. 3.
                     The litle horne that grew out among them (1 part of verſ. 8.) is the Turke, the Dragon of the ſixt Viale Revel. 16. 13. Of whom onely, and of the reſt of the enemies that ſhould oppreſſe the Iewes, Daniel ſpeaketh without any reſpect to the weſt Antichriſt.
                     By this litle horne three of thoſe hornes were rooted out. (2 part of verſ. 8.) That is, a third part of the Romane Empire ſubdued; which yet retaineth 7 hornes, whereof the Turke ſhall neuer be Lord and Maiſter, further then as he may by ſome ſodaine ſtorme for a while oppreſſe them. This third part of the Romane Empire ſo to be deſtroyed, is intended from Eaſt to Weſt, not from South to North. For therein the Turke poſſeſſeth more then euer the Romanes had.

That is, till after all the kingdomes of the world deſtroyed, the whole principalitie remaine with Chriſt; as preſently it ſhall, after this blaſphemous horne, the Turke, cut of. And till that time, the fourth beaſt is not to haue an end.
                     The continuance of the Turkiſh tyrannie, ſhal be, a time, times, and a diuiſion of times. (verſ. 25.) that is, a ſet time, ſet

                        times and a halfe; as it is explaned Dan. 12. 7. Of what length that is, may be vnderſtood by Rev. 9. 13. that giueth him an houre, a day, a moneth and a yeare: which in all (accounting a day for a yeare) commeth to 395 dayes. A time then is 100 yeares: times, 200 yeares: halfe a time, 50 yeares. So the whole ſpace, if you account from the beginning of the Turkiſh power, which all hiſtories place Anno 1300, will end at they yeare 1650. But that you will ſay commeth ſhort of that, which is in the Reuelation, by 45 yeares. The reaſon is, becauſe the Reuelation ſetteth downe the vttermoſt period of the Turkiſh name; but the Angell here, and Dan. 12. 7. noteth his firſt declining, which ſhall be 45 yeares before, as is apparant Dan. 12. 11, 12. So Dan. 11. 44. tidings ſhall firſt trouble him, and then a few yeares after followeth his vtter deſtruction in the land of comelineſſe. The diſtribution therefore of time, both here and Dan. 12. 7. reacheth no further then to thoſe tidings. And then ſhall the people of the Iewes deſtroy 18 Poſit. Conqueſt.

                     DANIELS weekes (as they are commonly termed) belong in part to this Argument: for in them is foretold the deſtruction of the Citie and Temple at Ieruſalem, for the Iewes contempt in reiecting the Meſſiah. But this

requireth ſome larger Tractate. And therefore I refer it to the end of the Booke.
                  
                  
                     
                        Dan. chapters 11. &amp; 12.
                     THeſe two Chapters are a prophecie of the manifold oppreſſion of Gods people the Iewes, and of the happy iſſue, which God ſhall ſend.
                     Oppreſſors there are fiue.
                     Firſt, the Perſian Monarchie. (ve. 1, 2.)
                     Secondly, the Graecians, to wit, Alexander the Great, his foure ſucceſſors, the Ptolomees and Antiochus. (verſ. 3. to the 36 verſe.)
                     
                     Thirdly, the Romane Empire: vnder the name of that King. (verſ. 36, to verſ. 40.)
                     Fourthly, the Saracens pointed at vnder the name of the King of the South. Who in the time of the end, meaning towards the end of the glory of the Roman Empire, hauing Mahomet for their Captaine, aſſaulted the Roman territories out of Arabia, and other meere Southerly countries. (1 part of verſ. 40.)
                     Laſtly, the King of the North. That is, the Turke, whom the furtheſt northerne parts ſent into the world thorough the Caſpian gates. (2 part of verſ. 40.)
                     Him you haue deſcribed,
                     Firſt by his proſpering againſt the Saracens &amp; Romans, (3 part of verſ. 40.) againſt Iudaea, the land of comelineſſe, and other adioyning countries, (verſ. 41.) Aegypt, Lybia and Aethiopia. (verſ. 42, 43.)
                     Secondly, by his ruine and downefall. Whereof two ſteps are noted.
                     One, his firſt declining vpon the Iewes of the Eaſt and 10 Poſit. Firſt conuerted.
                         North countries, conuerted to the Chriſtian faith. Which muſt needs terribly affright him, being then beſet before with vs Chriſtians of the Weſt, and behinde by the new Chriſtian Iewes. (verſ. 44.)
                     The other his vtter ouerthrow by warre in the land of

Iudaea; which is here deſcribed by two notes: one in ſaying, betweene the Seas, meaning Euphrates (which the 17 Poſit. Place of conflict.
                         Scripture is wont to call a Sea) and the Syrian Creeke of the Mediterranean Sea. The other, at the holy mount of Comelineſſe, (as Iudaea is called the Comelineſſe of all Countries. 
                        20 Poſit. Place of Gogs fall.
                         
                        Ezech. 20. 6, 15.) which doth explane the former, and more particularly deſigne the place where the Grand Signior himſelf ſhal fall, at the holy mountaine, as Eſay 24. 25. whoſe fall is firſt cloſely and couertly pointed at by a rare and extraordinarie word (tents of the ire of his Iudgement) vſed for this onely purpoſe, to note his extraordinarie and heauy puniſhment. (1 part of verſ. 45.) as Eſay 30. 33. Then it is in expreſſe words laid forth, and the manner alſo ſignified how he ſhall come to his end, there ſhall be none to helpe him. As if he would ſay, his ouerthrow ſhall come 19 Poſit. Gods fighting.
                         not ſo much from the force of man, as by Gods owne arme from heauen ſtretched out againſt him. (2 part of verſ. 45.)
                     Hitherto of the oppreſſion of the Iewes. The ioyfull and happy iſſue conteyneth foure things.
                     1. A wonderfull deliuerance from the ſoreſt time of affliction that euer was. (chap. 12. verſ. 1.) 16 Poſit. Sore diſtreſſe.
                        
                     
                     2. The full reſtoring of the Nation of the Iewes, and 7 Poſit. Generall call.
                         the calling of them to faith in Chriſt, meant here, by their awaking out of the duſtie earth. (1 part of verſ. 2.) Of the laſt reſurrection you cannot take it. For the certaine time when this ſhall be is defined in the 11 &amp; 12 verſes.
                     
                     But withall a certaine qualification is made, that ſome which ſhall awake and be ſo deliuered, ſhall awake to euerlaſting 
                        9 Poſit. Wrath againſt refractaries.
                         
                        ſhame and deſtruction. For all the Iewes ſhall not agree in the ſame truth, ſome ſhall perſiſt in their former hardnes, notwithſtanding all the euident teſtimonies that God ſhall giue vnto his Sonne. For whom there remaineth
Read Verſe 45. the firſt part of it thus.
                        And he ſhall plant the tents of the wrath of his iudgement, betweene the Seas &amp;c.
                        
no further promiſe of grace. (2 part of verſ. 2.)
                     3. Their glorious Church. Thoſe that are wiſe, that is, 31 Poſit. Glorious church
                         the whole companie of the faithfull, ſhall ſhine as the firmament. But the teachers, thoſe that make other righteous, by teaching, exhorting, reprouing, comforting, as the more lightſome part of their orbe, like ſhining ſtars ſhall beautifie this firmament. (verſ. 3.) For it is ſaid here, they that be wiſe and do make righteous, in the preſent, not in the time paſt. Which is a proofe that he ſpeaketh not of the laſt reſurrection.
                     4. The time when all this ſhall be. (verſ. 4.)
                     Which time is doubly deſigned.
                     Firſt in generall, by an Angels queſtion vnto Chriſt. (verſ. 5, 6) and Chriſts anſwer with a ſolemne oath, that 11 Poſit. Time of firſt converſion.
                         the end of theſe marueilous things ſhall be at a time, two times, and halfe a time. Which words being generall and vncertaine, and to be applied to any time, are in the words following reduced to one certaine and definite time: namely, when he ſhall make an end of ſcattering the holy people. The meaning therefore is, that this end ſhall be, when the blaſphemous kingdome of the Turkes is at an end: that is, after 350 yeares of the Turkiſh power, which hath his expiration about Anno 1650. At what time God will leaue ſcattering of his holy people, and of further powring out his wrath vpon them. For then ſhall the Turkes firſt declining come. (verſ. 7.)
                     Secondly, it is ſet forth in more particular manner, and diuidedly, vpon Daniels humble ſuite. (verſ. 8.) yet not for his vnderſtanding from whom theſe things were ſhut vp, (verſ. 9.) but for the Elects ſake in ſucceeding ages, in whom theſe things amidſt their many trials may breede conſtancie and ſweet comfort, and who about the end of theſe things ſhall be diligent to ſearch out the truth hereof. (verſ. 10.)
                     Firſt therefore he maketh one common beginning of the account. From the daily ſacrifice taken away, (which was done by the death of Chriſt) and from the laying of the
                        
                        abhomination deſolate. for ſo I would tranſlate theſe words. (1 part of verſ. 11.) By abhomination he meaneth the Iewes ſacrificings; which were impious and abhominable after Chriſt by his death had ſet an end to them. The laying of this abhomination deſolate, was by the laſt publike ouerthrow of the legall ſeruice in the deſtruction of Ieruſalem. Not that by Veſpaſian, but in the time of Iulian, when the Apoſtata, in hatred of the Chriſtian name, giuing the Iewes leaue to repaire the Temple, and that at the publike charge. God by an earth-quake did vtterly throw downe the old foundations, that neuer afterwards any thing could be attempted in that kinde. This was about the yeare 360.
                     From hence groweth a twofold period or a double appointed terme. One 1290 dayes, (2 part of verſ. 11.) 11 Poſit. Time of firſt converſion.
                         that is to ſay, yeares. (for morning and euening are not ſet downe to note them to be naturall dayes, as before chap. 8. 11.) Adding therfore 1290 to 360, there will ariſe 1650. which is the yeare of the Turkiſh power firſt declining, and perfectly accompliſhed in the time, times, and halfe a time before verſ. 7.
                     The ſecond period or praefixed time (verſ. 12.) is 1335 dayes or yeares, which addeth 45 yeares to the former, 22 Poſit. Time of conqueſt.
                         and endeth at the yeare 1695. Being that ſpace of an houre, day, moneth, and a yeare Rev. 9. 15. when the Turkiſh tyrannie ſhall be vtterly extinct and rooted out. And bleſſed indeed are they that attaine this time, as the Angell here ſaith. For this is the glorious reſurrection ſpoken of verſ. 2. and the greateſt felicitie that it is poſſible for Gods Saints to come vnto vpon earth.
                  
                  
                     HOSHEA.

                     1. The graces of the Spirit that vpon Chriſts aſcenſion ſhall be powred vpon the Church, for ſo the Apoſtle interpreteth this place, Act. 2. (chap. 2. verſ. 28. 29. 30. 31.)
                     2. A holy ſeed or remnant to remaine among the Iewes. (1. part of verſ. 32.)

                     3. An enumeration of ſome particular foes, (verſ. 4.) whoſe hard dealing with the people is likewiſe reckoned, (verſ. 5. 6.) and their iuſt retribution: (verſ. 7.) for as they ſold the children of Iuda and Ieruſalem to the Gręcians, that they might be carried farre from their borders: ſo will God ſell their ſonnes and daughters into the hands of the 46 Poſit.

(2 part of verſ. 11.) An other, that thorough the grace offred to the Gentiles, themſelues might be prouoked to a holy emulation. as Eſay 2. 2, 3, 4. (laſt part of verſ. 11.) A third, that their taking to at the laſt, may much more cauſe the Goſpell to be publiſhed among all Nations. (verſ. 12.) which two latter ends, the ſecond and the third, are amplified in their order. (The ſecond, verſ. 13, 14. The third, verſ. 15.)
                     2. He proueth it by a notable Argument. In that the roote being holy, the branches muſt needs be ſo. (verſ. 16.)
                     3. He exhorteth the Gentiles not to inſult vpon them. (verſ. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.)
                     4. He declareth that God is able to graffe them in, (verſ. 23.) by a greater example of Gods power vpon vs Gentiles. (verſ. 24.)
                     5. He layeth downe the doctrine it ſelfe of Gods pleaſure and will to graffe them in indeed. (verſ. 25.)
                     
                        
6. He fortifieth the ſame by Scripture, (verſ. 26, 27.) by Gods vnrepentant counſels, (verſ. 28, 29.) and by the like example of the Gentiles. (verſ. 30, 31.)
                     7. And laſtly, he ſhutteth vp all with the admiration of Gods wiſedome and vnſearchable iudgements in this behalfe. (verſ. 32, 33, 34, 35, 36.)

For though Rome ſhall before that be ouerthrowne, yet till then, Poperie ſhall not wholy fall, nor Antichriſt be vtterly done away. Of the end of the world it cannot be vnderſtood, ſeeing it is euident the Turke ſhall hold out ſome-while after the beaſt and falſe Prophet, both triple crowne and Papall dignitie done away. Rev. 20. 8, 9, 10.
                  
               
               
                  
                  THE REVELATION.
                  IN the Booke of the Revelation, I will but point at ſome principall things.
                  
                     REVEL. 1. 7.
                     
                        Behold he commeth with the clouds, and euery eye ſhall ſee him. Yea euen they which pierced him thorough. And all the Tribes of the earth ſhall waile before him. Euen ſo. Amen.
                     
                     IOHN hauing rendred praiſe to God for his mercy to the Gentiles, doth now celebrate his goodneſſe that ſhall be moſt conſpicuous in the calling of the Iewes. 5. Poſit. Call.
                        
                     
                     1. Expreſſing the great glory that ſhall appeare in their conuerſion by Chriſts glorious comming in the clouds to iudgement: whereof this (of all things in the world) is the moſt expreſſe and liuely image.
                     2. The wayling here ſpoken of, are the teares of true repentance; as is manifeſt by the Prophet Zacharie, from whom this place is borrowed. Zach. 12. 10.
                     3. The name of Tribes ſheweth of what people it is meant: which in the Prophet is more manifeſt.
                     4. In ſaying all the Tribes, the 10 Tribes are included. 8 Poſit. X. Tribes.

                     FRom hence to the end of the Reuelation are four ſteps or degrees: the ſame (though not altogether in the ſame order) that we noted, Ezech. 37. Which maruellouſlie cleereth the vnderſtanding of this Propheſie. Firſt, after Romes funerall; for which the Iewes as well as Gentiles breake forth into thankeſgiuing: (as Amen, Halleluiah, verſ. 4. one Hebrew by birth, but made a Greeke Deniſen, the other a meere Hebrew word importeth) they now ſetling themſelues after the great obſtacle of their repentance (the idolatry of the Romiſh Church) remoued, 5. Poſit. Call.
                         to lend their cares to Chriſt; commeth the firſt call of that Nation, for the intimating whereof onely the Hebrew word (Halleluiah) in this place is vſed. (verſ. 5. 6.) It is expreſſed:
                     1. By the preparing of her ſelfe for the ſelemnization of the marriage. (verſ. 7.)
                     2. By the marriage garment which they put on, the

cleane and fine linnen of the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt imputed to the Saints, and by faith made theirs. (verſ. 8. 9. 10.)
                     The ſecond ſteppe (after ſome other things enterlaced, wherewith I ſhall not need to meddle) is the battell with Gog and Magog, vnder the conduct of the Turke, (Sathan or the Deuill, whoſe Miniſter he is) the chiefe principall cauſe being put for the inſtrumentall. This enemy riſing ſome 1000 yeares after Conſtantine, that is about Anno 1300. (verſ. 7.) and proſpering exceedingly, (1. part of verſ. 8.) warring all the while with the Saints (2. part of verſ. 8.) ſhall at the laſt when their appointed period draweth to an end, bend all his force againſt the conuerted Iewes.
                     1. Is noted the place of this conflict: They compaſſed the 
                        20 Peſit. Place of Gogs Fall.

                         themſelues to Chriſt, or rather Chriſt taking them vnto him, their taking to, as it is ſaid, Rom. 11. 15. which the Apoſtle in that place calleth life from the dead, from the death of ſinne and infidelity. And therefore is heere gloriouſly deſcribed vnder the form of the generall reſurrection: Whereunto the Scripture in this argument doth ordinarily allude, Ezech. 37. Eſay 26. 19. Dan. 12. 2. Hoſh. 13. 14. Rom. 11. 15. (verſ. 11. 12, 13. 14. Though this be not 9 Poſit. Wrath againſt refractaries.
                         the common condition of all, ſome will remaine obſtinate, whoſe end ſhall bee moſt iniferable: As Dan. 12. 2. (verſ. 15.)
                     The fourth and laſt ſteppe is the glory of the Chriſtian 31. Poſit. Gloricus Church.
                         Iewiſh Church, dwelling in their owne homes, when their

enemies are once ſubdued vnder them, in the 21. and 22. chapters. The laſt 8. chapters of Ezechiel are of the ſame argument: but (as the diſpenſation of thoſe times made it needfull) vnder the ſhadowes of heauenly things heere, more magnificently by heauenly things themſelues. It was ſhewed vnto Iohn in two viſions: firſt, in a kinde of generalitie, then more diſtinctly.
                     The former containeth.
                     1. A new face of things in their happy and glorious renouation, by the power of the Goſpell. which ſhall bring 34. Poſit. Puritie.
                         them quite out of loue with their former legall worſhip: (chap. 21. 1.) as Eſay 65. 17. for this paſſing away of the firſt heauen and the firſt earth, and that the Sea was no more, is that ſhaking of heauen and earth, of the ſea, and of the dry land: whereof Haggai propheſieth, Hag 2. 7.
                     2 The ſanctitie of this Citie; for firſt it is altogether 34. Poſit. Purity.
                         New, if you compare it with the ſtaynes and blemiſhes that the Churches of vs Gentiles are tainted with, though wee alſo make a part of the heauenly Ieruſalem, Gal. 4. 26. Heb. 12. 22. Secondly, it is of a diuine off-ſpring, comming downe from God out of heauen. Thirdly, ſhee is clothed with the righteouſneſſe of the Saints, as a bride trimmed for her huſband. (verſe. 2.)
                     3. Gods tabernacle, his preſence and dwelling there, (1. part of verſ. 3.) as Ezechiel calleth the name of the City 35. Poſit. Couenant.
                         
                        Iehouah Shammah, Iehouah there. Ezech 48. 30.
                     4. His couenant, being their God, and taking them for his people. (2. part of verſ. 3.) 35 Poſit. Couenant.
                        
                     
                     5. Heauineſſe and ſorrow ſhall bee taken from them, (verſ. 4.) as Eſay 25. 8. 39 Poſit. Proſperity.
                        
                     
                     All which things are ſolemnely confirmed by the authority of him that cannot lye. (verſ. 5. 6. 7.) Yet euen here alſo, notwithſtanding all the illuſtrious arguments of 9 Poſit. Wrath againſt refractaries.
                         Gods glory ſhining ſo cleerely, ſome will remaine fearefull to profeſſe Chriſt, vnbeleeuers, &amp;c. as before, chap. 20. 15. (verſ. 8.)
                     Thus farre of that viſion which was in a kinde of generalitie.

The other more diſtinct, (to the beholding whereof, Iohn was carried in the Spirit vnto a great high mountaine) [verſ. 10.] declareth,
                     1. Her glory, ſo great, that ſhe ſhall be the enlightener 31. Poſit. Glorious Church.
                         of the world, as Eſay 60. 1. 2. (verſ. 11.)

                         or the inuentions of mans braine. I ſaw, ſaith Iohn, no Temple there, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lambe are the temple of it. (verſ. 22.)
                     4. A wonderfull light of knowledge: as if they were rather taught immediately of God, then by booke-learning, 36 Poſit. Spirituall graces.
                         or the miniſtry of man. They need neyther Sunne nor Moone, Candle nor any light; for the Lambe himſelfe is their light. (verſ. 23.

                     7. The purity of Church-diſcipline, that no impure or vncleane thing ſhall enter thither. (verſ. 27.) 33 Poſit. Sanctitie.
                        
                     
                     8. Plenty of ſpirituall graces, through the pure ſtreams of liuing water, flowing out of the throne of God, (chap. 22 verſ. 1.) &amp; by the tree of life (Chriſt Ieſus) moſt fruitfull in it ſelfe, moſt medicinable vnto others: the very leaues 36. Poſit. Spiritual graces
                         whereof are able to heale all the diſeaſes and vlcers of the ſoule. (verſ. 2.) Compare Zach. 14. 8. and Ezek. chap. 47. But where Zacharie ſpeaketh of waters flowing out of Ieruſalem, Ezekiel out of the Temple, Iohn expoundeth both to be meant of the throne of God and the Lamb, that is, from the grace and fauour of God in Chriſt.
                     9. Sanctitie of life. There ſhall be no cauſe of the heauie 37. Poſit. Cheerefull obedience.

                  AN EXPOSITION Vpon the 24. 25. 26. and 27. Chapters of the Prophet ESAY: Together with ſome few Obſeruations thereupon.
                  
                     1. Behold IEHOVAH emptieth the land, and layeth it waſte; and 
                        
                           Hebr. Petuerteth the face thereof. 
                        turueth it vpſide-downe, and ſcattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof.
                     
                     2. And it ſhall be as with the people, ſo with the Prieſt, as with the ſeruant, ſo with his maſter, as with the maid, ſo with her miſtreſſe: as with the buyer, ſo with the ſeller, as with the lender, ſo with the borrower, as with the taker of vſury, ſo with the giuer of vſury to him.
                     
                     3. The land ſhall be cleane 
                        In emptying ſhall bee emptyed, and in ſpoyling ſhall be ſpoyled. 
                        emptied, and vtterly ſpoyled: for IEHOVAH hath ſpoken this word.
                     
                     4. The land ſhall mourne and fade away, the inhabited world ſhall languiſh and fade away, ſhe 
                        The height of the people. 
                        haughty people of the land ſhall languiſh.
                     
                     
                        EXPOSITION.
                        
                           THeſe foure Chapters containe one whole and entire Propheſie. It hath two deuided members: One of the reiection of the Iewes, the other of their receiuing in the laſt daies into the flocke of Chriſt.
                        The reiection, in the firſt 20. verſes of the 24th. chapter,

ſetteth forth the moſt wofull deſolation that any ſtorie can 4 Poſit. Deſolation.

                        Which though it be of things to come many hundred of yeares after, the Prophet as one that ſaw them in the Spirit, as if they were then done, vttereth not onely in the future, but ſometimes in the preſent, ſometimes in the time paſt by an Idiom proper to the Prophets, to note how certaine they are to take effect.
                        This threatned deſolation is garniſhed and ſet forth fiue manner of waies.
                        Firſt, needs muſt it be a matter of ſome rare and maruellous conſequence, that, Behold, the O-yes of the Holy Ghoſt is ſet before.
                        Secondly, the Author and efficient is God.
                        Thirdly, you haue a diſtribution. The land, ſaith he, (meaning the land of Iſrael and Iuda) ſhall bee emptied both of inhabitants, and of all other things: Euery thing ſhall be turned vp-ſide downe; the inhabitants ſcattered and diſperſed.
                        Heere are both the parts comprehended verſe 1. which are afterwards diſtinguiſhed in the reſt that followeth to 14. verſe.
                        Touching the perſons or inhabitants. 1. There ſhall be a generall deſtruction of all ſtates and degrees: no difference, 2. high and low, rich and poore ſhall be dealt with all alike.
                        2. They ſhall be all ſpoyled of their choyce &amp; precious treaſures, which is verified from the mouth of him that 3. cannot lye, and is able to performe his threatnings.
                        3. They ſhall mourne, they ſhall pine away and be enfeebled: periſh through their owne weakeneſſe, euen the 4. high and loftie ones ſhall pine away.
                     
                     
                        Obſeruations.
                        This noble prophecie affordeth many ſweet &amp; heauenly leſſons.
                        
                           
1. Iehovah] Firſt, God is the Author of all iudgements. Is there any euill in the Citie, which Iehovah doth not. Amos 3. 6. I create the deſtroyer to deſtroy. Eſay 54. 16. This which ſeemeth a leſſon ſo eaſie and familiar, it is moſt neceſſarie to take out, that we may learne to humble our ſelues vnder his hand. for all his workes are holy and iuſt: and who can reſiſt his counſels?
                        
                           Emptieth the land] 2. Flouriſhing States and Common-wealths (how much more particular perſons?) he is able to throw downe and lay all their honour and glory in the duſt. As what ſtate or kingdome was at this time greater then the Iewes. Amos 6. 2. Paſſe vnto Calne (a famous Citie in the land of Shinear. Gen. 10. 10.) and ſee, and from thence goe to great Hammath, and get you downe to Gath of the Philiſtims. Are they better then theſe kingdoms? (of Iſrael and Iudah) or is their border larger then your borders?
                        
                        
                           The land] 3. He ſpareth not his owne people, when they tranſgreſſe againſt him; yea the neerer he commeth to them in his fauours and bleſſings, the higher he lifteth his hand to beate and to correct them, when they doe amiſſe? For great offenſes God cannot in iuſtice but requite with great puniſhments.
                        
                           Emptieth &amp;c. turneth &amp;c.] 4. His threatnings are moſt certaine, and as good as now done, though they be denounced thouſands of yeares before.
                        2. And it ſhall be as with &amp;c.] 5. Dignitie &amp; wealth cannot hinder him. Doth he eſteeme nobilitie, or riches, or any thing that fortifieth ſtrength? Ioh. 36. 19. Pouertie, nor baſe eſtate findeth any fauour with him.
                        3. The land ſhall be ſpoyled] 6. Riches is a vaine thing to helpe in the time of neede, which are ſubiect to be ſpoiled and taken from vs: why then ſhould we ſpend our time and beſtow our ſtrength vpon things that are vnprofitable? Let vs rather labour for the things that cannot periſh: That treaſure which none can robbe vs of.
                        
                           
                           For Iehovah hath ſpoken] 7 How deeply ſoeuer we be planted, though it be as Tyrus which had her biding in the Seas; and if with the Babylonian, we haue heaped togither riches like thicke clay, Abacuc. 2. 6. let vs yet feare when the mouth of God doth ſpeake. For his words are not in vaine. Doth he ſay and ſhall be not do it? Numb. 23. 23.
                        4. The haughtie &amp;c.] 8 The higheſt muſt learne to ſtoope when he threatneth. For he bringeth leanneſſe vpon the fat ones, maketh the plump to pine away, and ſendeth heauineſſe into their ſoules.
                        5. For the land is defiled vnder the inhabitants thereof: becauſe they haue tranſgreſſed the lawes, changed the ordinance, diſanulled the euerlaſting couenant.
                        
                        6. Therefore ſhall the curſe devoure the land, and they that dwell therein ſhall be deſolate: Therefore the inhabitants of the land are burned vp, and few men are left.
                        
                     
                     
                        EXPOSITION.
                        COme we now to the cauſes, the ſecond and vndercauſes of ſo heauy iudgements; which the Prophet 5. here avoucheth to be the ſinnes of the people. But what ſinnes? Firſt in generall, ſuch and ſo great, that the land is defiled vnder theſe wicked perſons.
                        Secondly, theſe ſinnes are ſet forth in three particulars.
                        The firſt, they haue tranſgreſſed the lawes, naturall and morall, of duties to God and to their brethren.
                        The ſecond is, they haue changed the rites and ceremonies inſtituted of God, from the right vſe for the which they were ordained, whileſt they ſee not Chriſt in them, the ſubſtance of thoſe ſhadowes. Heb. 9. 11. Coloſſ. 2. 17. For they all do looke to him, as the Cherubins did looke with their faces to the mercy-ſeat. Exod. 25. 20.
                        The third is, the diſanulling of the Couenant founded

in Meſſia, Chriſt: when comming vnto his owne, his owne receiued him not.
                        This third, is amplified by the effects; the curſe that it bringeth with it. But aboue all, marke the curſe here ſpoken 6. of, that which the Iewes ſo called and cryed for, His blood be vpon vs, and vpon our children. Math. 27. 25. And therefore (ſaith the Prophet) it ſhall moſt iuſtly come vpon them: and as a fire ſhall deuoure and conſume them.
                     
                     
                        Obſeruations.
                        5. For the land] 9 Sinne is the proper and immediate cauſe of all affliction. For affliction (as Eliphaz telleth Iob. Iob 5. 6, 7.) commeth not out of the duſt, neither doth vexation ſpring out of the ground. But man is borne to trouble, as the ſparkes of burning coales flie vpwards. That is to ſay: we are not to aſcribe trouble and calamitie to chance or other blinde cauſes, but to the ſinne that ſticketh in vs.
                        Why then are we ſo cruell and vnmercifull to our ſelues, to pull by ſuch meanes wrath and iudgement vpon our owne heads?
                        
                           Defiled] 10 Marueilous is the pollution of ſinne; that not onely ſtaineth and infecteth the whole man, ſoule and bodie, but defileth the ground we tread vpon, and maketh the land to groane vnder the burthen of vs.
                        
                           They haue tranſgreſſed] 11 The law of God is the rule and ſquare of all our actions.
                        His commandements are as bounds and banks, which we may not tranſgreſſe or goe beyond, though it be with neuer ſo good intention.
                        
                           The lawes] 12 There is a double and threefold cord to tie vs to the obedience thereof. One, becauſe they were not onely written in our hearts by nature, but renewed by the voice of God from heauen, when mans corruption had obſcured the brightnes of the ſame. Another for

that they conteine a perfect comprehenſion of all duties whatſoeuer, which we owe to God or one vnto another. Aptly therefore and properly doth the Prophet call them lawes in the plurall.
                        
                           Changed the ordinances] When we apply the holy things, eſpecially the rites and ceremonies that he hath inſtituted, to an other end then for the which they were ordained, we change the nature of them, and of Gods ordinances do make them ours. Strange things which God eſteemeth not. Hoſh. 8. 12. The excellent things of my law, which I praeſcribe vnto them, are reckoned as a ſtrange thing.
                        
                        
                           Couenant] 13 Wonderfull is the mercy and goodneſſe of God, that hath vouchſafed to enter into a couenant with his ſeruants, and vnder certaine conditions, as it were, to contract with them for life eternall.
                        The condition is, Beleeue and thou ſhalt be ſaued. Act. 16. 31.
                        
                           Euerlaſting couenant] 14 This couenant, the couenant of peace and reconciliation through Chriſt, is an euerlaſting couenant, a ſure couenant, a couenant of ſalt, more firmly fixed in his Sonne, then the Sunne &amp; Moone are fixed in the heauens.
                        
                           Diſanulled] 15 But where men put not forth the hand of faith to reach it to themſelues, this couenant can do no good: no more then the Kings pardon helpeth, in caſe a man refuſe to plead and take aduantage of it.
                        Men therefore by their owne infidelitie reiect the counſell and purpoſe of God to ſaue them. They ſhorten his hand and ſhrinke vp his arme from doing good. Marc. 7. 5, 6. He could do no miracle there, becauſe of their vnbeleefe. Oh what a thing it is, that the fault ſhould reſt in vs, why Gods couenant can take no place!
                        6. Therefore ſhall the curſe deuoure &amp;c.] 16 As the Couenant embraced bringeth life: ſo the curſe of God is inſeparably annexed to the tranſgreſſing of it.
                        
                           Curſe] 17 Let men take heede how they vſe execration,

curſing and banning of their ſoules. God maketh other mens curſes to ſpeede, where there is iuſt cauſe. Iudg. 957. The curſe of Iotham came vpon the Shechemites. How much more ſhall our owne curſes and imprecations light vpon our ſelues.
                        For God is iuſt and will not be mocked.
                        7. The new wine ſhall mourne, the vine ſhall languiſh: all the merry-hearted ſhall ſigh.
                        
                        8. The mirth of Tabrets ſhall ceaſe, the noyſe of them that reioyce ſhall leaue: the ioy of the harpe ſhall ceaſe.
                        
                        9. They ſhall not drinke wine with a ſong: ſtrong drinke ſhall be bitter to them that drinke it.
                        
                        10. The Citie 
                           Of emptineſſe. 
                           made emptie, ſhall be broken downe: euery houſe ſhall be ſhut vp; 
                           From comming in. 
                           that none may come in.
                        
                        11. There ſhall be a crying concerning wine in the ſtreetes: all mirth ſhall be darkned; the ioy of the land ſhall ſlit away.
                        
                        12. What ſo is reſerued in the Citie, ſhall be ſmitten with deſolation: and with a noiſe ſhall the gate be ſmitten.
                        
                        13. For thus ſhall it be in the midſt of the land, among the people; as the ſhaking of an Olive tree, as gleaning of Grapes, when the vintage is done.
                        
                     
                     
                        EXPOSITION.
                        SO much of the perſons or inhabitants: the things which they muſt looſe, are,
                        1. The commodities of the land, wine &amp;c. 
                           7.
                        
                        2. The ioyes and pleaſures of the land ſhall be all taken from them. Priuate griefes and groanings ſhall be euen to thoſe that are of a merry diſpoſition.
                        Publike ioy and merriments, the Timbrell and the 8. Harpe, all ſolaces of their life ſhall ceaſe.
                        And that in their feaſts and banquetings: Such a floud 9. of euils ſhall ouerwhelme them. Enough to make euen their ſtrong drinke to be bitter and out of taſte.
                        
                           
3. Companie there ſhall be none: no going in nor out in their ſtreets. 10.
                        
                        4. Howling and lamentation ſhall euery where be 11. heard, becauſe of the comforts they haue loſt. As the ayre in the euening waxeth darke, ſo ſhall their mirth be turned into heauineſſe.
                        5. Nothing ſhall be left free. Hauocke ſhall be made of the things they kept in ſtore. The gates and ſtrong 12. holds ſhall not be able to hold out the enimie.
                        6. As when the Olive tree is beaten, but a few berries are left remayning, and ſcarce a cluſter of grape; to bee 13. found (one happily here and there) vpon the beginning of 3 Poſit. Remnant.
                            the vintage: ſo ſhall there but a few men, a ſmall handfull be reſerued from the furie and violence of their foes. Wherein notwithſtanding ſome comfort is interlaced; that in the middeſt of this fearefull deſtruction, a remnant, a holy ſeede ſhall bee left according to the election of grace, of whom God will be pleaſed to gather in time a new Church vnto himſelfe. As before Chap. 17. 5, 6. and Eſay 65. 8. See Eſay 6. 13.
                     
                     
                        Obſeruations.
                        7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. The new wine &amp;c.] 18 The good things of this life, not onely for neceſſitie but for honeſt comfort and recreation, men may lawfully &amp; with a good conſcience vſe, being ſanctified vnto vs by the word of God and prayer. 1 Tim. 4. 4, 5.
                        19 But it is his bleſſing that giueth cheerefulneſſe. When Gods hand is vpon vs, it behoueth vs to be humble, to leaue iolitie and merriments, if he call to heauines and mourning. The Prophet Eſay 22. 12, 13. findeth fault with this, that when the Lord called to weeping, mourning, baldnes and girding with ſackcloth, behold there was mirth and gladnes, killing of oxen, ſlaying of ſheepe, eating of fleſh, drinking of wine &amp;c.
                        13. For thus ſhall it be &amp;c.] 20 God tempereth his

iudgements with mercy, and in his wrath remembreth kindnes. He neuer ſo puniſheth but he leaueth ſome matter for his mercie to worke vpon. As he ſaued Noah and the 8 perſons in the Arke to repleniſh the world anew.
                        14. Theſe ſhall lift vp their voice, and ſing: for the excellencie of Iehovah, they ſhall ſhoute for ioy from the Sea, ſaying.
                        
                        15. Therefore in the valleys, glorifie yee Iehovah: in the Iles of the Sea, the name of Iehovah the God of Iſrael.
                        
                        16. From the skirt of the land we haue heard Pſalmes, comelineſſe to the iust one, But I ſay leanneſſes to me, leanneſſe to me, woe is me: The trecherous haue dealt trecherouſly, and 
                           With treacherie of treacherous men. 
                           with most trecherous trecherie haue they delt trecherouſly.
                        
                     
                     
                        EXPOSITION.
                        HAuing thus declared the particulars of this heauy and great calamitie, he proceedeth to the fourth generall amplification: which is a diſſimilitude betweene this and their former eſtate, accompanied with the cauſes of them both, and all iuſtified by the voice and ſuffrage of the people themſelues, thoſe that ſhall ſo be reſerued, glorifying and praiſing God. Wherefore the praiſes that here they giue, are worthy to be conſidered in fiue circumſtances.
                        Firſt is the motiue to this dutie, the excellencie of Gods worke. 14.
                        
                        The ſecond circumſtance is the manner of giuing praiſe. By ſhouting, ſinging, &amp;c.
                        The third circumſtance is the places from whence theſe praiſes ſhall ſound forth: all parts of the world, the Sea, the valleys, the furtheſt Iles. 
                           15.
                        
                        The fourth circumſtance, is their ſtirring vp and prouoking one an other to praiſe God. Glorifie yee.
                        
                        The fift circumſtance, is the perſon, whom thus they

praiſe, Iehovah the God of Iſrael.
                        
                        Theſe are the circumſtances. The argument or matter of their ſong, acknowledgeth (as we ſaid before) the 16 iuſt hand of God vpon them, by comparing their former eſtate with the preſent. Before, from euery place, in all the quarters of the land, ſounded nothing but Pſalmes, matter of praiſe and of thankſgiuing. For the people walking in holineſſe and righteouſnes, laying hold vpon the righteouſneſſe which is by faith in Chriſt, receiued onely fauors at the hands of God. But now in place of it is come mourning and complaint, pining away for the calamitie and hard eſtate, which their grieuous tranſgreſſion hath brought vpon them.
                        But as the puniſhment is moſt heauy, ſo the ſinne here pointed at, is a ſinne of all ſinnes, the moſt ſuperlatiue degree of ſinne. Such a tranſgreſſion as exceedeth without compariſon all other tranſgreſſions that euer were. Deteſtable aboue and beyond all the ſinnes whatſoeuer of all ages in the world. What is that? The crucifying of Chriſt the Lord of Glory, vpon a deſperate and deepe malice; adding to the ſame ſo many circumſtances of moſt notorious contumacie and ingratitude.
                     
                     
                        Obſeruations.
                        14. Theſe ſhall lift vp their voyce and ſing. For the excellencie &amp;c.] 21 The children of God haue their eyes open to ſee an excellencie of wiſedome, iuſtice, goodneſſe; where the world is blind and can diſcerne nothing but deformitie and confuſion.
                        Wherefore though their mouthes be ſtopped vp and mouſled, that not a word can come from them to the honour 22 and praiſe of God; yet the godly finde matter not onely to ſpeake, but to lift their voyce aloud, yea to ſing and ſhout.
                        There is a difference betweene Gods children and the wicked in obſeruing the workes of God. For the wicked 23
                           
themſelues are forced to acknowledge Gods iuſtice. As I haue done, ſo hath God rendred vnto me. Iudg. 1. 7. But Gods children behold an excellencie in Gods workes, which maketh them with cheerefull and ioyfull hearts to magnifie his name.
                        The deformities that are in the world, which ſeeme to miniſter nothing but iuſt complaint and diſcontent, fill 24 their mouthes with ſongs and hymnes. For they with ſpirituall eyes diſcerne that excellencie of Gods worke, ſuch an aboundance of wiſedome, power, goodnes, holineſſe, truth, iuſtice, that maketh them perforce to breake forth into his praiſes.
                        And this is a holy vſe of ſinging and vſing mirth, when it tendeth (as Dauids Pſalmes) to the glorifying of the high and mighty workes of God, which he would haue to be had in euerlaſting remembrance.
                        
                           In the Iles of the Sea] 25 No place ſhould diſcourage vs from ſeruing God: the ſolitarie wilderneſſe, the Iles that are moſt comfortles. What and how noble viſions did God reueale to his ſeruant Iohn in the Ile of Patmos, when vpon the Lords day he gaue himſelfe in that barbarous place to heauenly meditations?
                        
                           Glorifie yee Iehovah] 26 It is an excellent and a holy dutie to quicken others in pietie and godlineſſe, as God by his Spirit hath quickned vs. Pſal. 122. 1. I was glad of them that ſaid vnto me, Let vs goe to the houſe of Iehovah. Zach. 8. 21. The inhabitants of one Citie ſhall ſay vnto another, Let vs go diligently to be ſutors to Iehovah, and to ſeeke Iehovah of Hoaſtes: I alſo will goe. And where the zeale of God warmeth at the heart, it will breake forth as fire to the kindling and inflaming of others.
                        
                           The God of Iſrael] 27 The true God as he reuealeth himſelfe in the Church is he that we muſt honour and ſerue.
                        The memoriall of whoſe name is alwaies one and the 28 ſame. Heretofore knowne to his people by the name of the God of Iſrael, but now manifeſted vnto vs more

clearely in his Sonne Chriſt Ieſus; who with the brightnes and excellencie of the New Teſtament, obſcureth and drowneth the former couenant.
                        And here haue you the very marke of the true Church, which is to celebrate and profeſſe the great and glorious 29. name of the true God, the God of Iſrael, the Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.
                        15. Sea, valleys] 30 In what place of the world ſoeuer any ſuch may be found, though lurking and lying hid in the middeſt of moſt barbarous and ſauage Nations, they are to be acknowledged the liuely members of the Church inviſible.
                        
                           From the skirt of the land we haue heard Pſalmes] 31 It is a holy and ſweet muſicke in Gods eares, when as his benefits are generall; ſo generall thanks is giuen of many. 2 Cor. 1. 11.
                        16. Comelines to the iust:] 32 A land flouriſheth, and it is well with them when they feare God and walke in his commandements.
                        Contrariwiſe, the rejecting and ſetting light by Gods mercies offred vnto a people, is the cauſe of ruine and deſtruction 33. of flouriſhing States and Kingdomes: Neuer did any people flouriſh more then the Iſraelites, when they kept cloſe to Gods ordinances. Neuer was there example ſeene of ſuch a fearefull deſolation as befell them, when they fell from God: which Moſes had before threatned, Deut. 32. and all the world hath ſeene to come to paſſe. That in them as in a picture you may behold the truth of that which Solomon ſaith in his Prouerbes, Prov. 14. 34. Righteouſnes exalteth a Nation: But ſinne is the reproch of people.
                        
                        
                           To the iust one:] 34 The cauſe of the bliſſe of a whole State is for the iuſt that are among them. Contrary to that the world eſteemeth; which aſcribeth the growth of Kingdomes to the wiſedome, policie, and power of the State: yea thinke the ſeruants of God many times the cauſe of the calamities that light vpon them, as appeareth in many

of the Edicts of the firſt Heathen Emperors. Who notwithſtanding haue beene oft driuen to acknowledge that God bleſſed them for the Churches ſake that harboured in their kingdomes.
                        
                           Most treacherous treacherie:] 35 What a fearefull ſinne it is to lend a deafe eare to Chriſt? For if it ſhall be eaſier for Sodome and Gomorrha in the day of Iudgement, then for thoſe that deſpiſe his Miniſters: what ſhall be thought of thoſe that do deſpiſe himſelfe?
                        This is to be noted, becauſe of the ſteps whereby men climbe vp to the height of ſinning. For thoſe that make no conſcience of Chriſts Ordinances, nor to entertaine the Prophets whom he ſendeth, will at the laſt make no conſcience of killing Chriſt himſelfe, if they might come by him.
                        All ſinnes therefore are not equall, neither is there an equalitie of puniſhments. 36.
                        
                        Mans nature is ſo dull and heauy, ſo vncapable of holy admonitions, that they had neede to be beaten vpon againe 37. and againe with varietie and heape of words, and particularizing of Gods iudgements: ſo to faſten them into their hearts, as with goades and nayles. Eccleſ. 12. 13.
                        17. Feare, and the pit, and the ſnare, ſhall come vpon thee, O inhabitant of the Land.
                        
                        18. For it ſhrll be, that he that fleeth becauſe of the 
                           voice. 
                           noiſe of the feare ſhall fall into the pit; and he that getteth vp out of the pit ſhall be taken in the ſnare: for the windowes from on high ſhall be opened, and the foundations of the earth ſhall ſhake.
                        
                        19. The land 
                           in breaking ſhall be broken downe. So in the reſt.
                            
                           ſhall be vtterly broken downe: the land ſhall be cleane diſſolued; the land ſhall be moued exceedingly.
                        
                        20. The land ſhall reele to and fro like a drunken man, and ſhall flit like a lodge: and the tranſgreſſion thereof ſhall be heauie vpon it, ſo that it ſhall fall and riſe no more.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                        EXPOSITION.
                        FIftly and laſtly, the threatned iudgement is ſet forth by a heape and multitude of euils, as it were with one breath, inſtanced in ſix particulars.
                        1. All manner of euill ſhall come. Feare or a horrible fearfull and feared euill; the feare whereof is worſe then 17. the thing we feare: the pit, ſodaine and vnlooked for miſchiefe: the ſnare, out of which there will be no getting out.
                        2. One miſchiefe ſhall come vpon the backe of another, that tone or tother none ſhall ſcape. 18.
                        
                        3. Heauen and earth ſhall fight againſt them, and conſpire to do them miſchiefe.
                        4. A terrible confuſion ſhall be ſeene. All turned topſie turvie. Euery thing ſhall go to wracke. 19.
                        
                        5. Tranſmigration and flitting vp and downe. To be a renegate people. 20.
                        
                        The land, that is, the inhabitants of the land toſſed and tumbled from one place vnto another; as a lodge that is made but for a night and taken away againe.
                        6. A deſperate and vnrecoverable downefall. Their tranſgreſſion, that is, the puniſhment of their tranſgresſion, as a heauy burden ſo preſſing and weighing them downe, that their end ſhall be vtter ruine, a fall neuer to be repaired. Alwaies vnderſtanding this one exception, vnleſſe it be by the mightie hand and power of God viſiting his people, as ſometimes he did their fore-fathers oppreſſed with the hand and intollerable bondage of the land of Aegypt. Of which reſtitution our Prophet ſpeaketh in the verſes following.
                     
                     
                        Obſeruations.
                        God hath multitudes of Iudgements at command: his 38 quiuer full of arrowes and varietie of ſhafts to dart at the wicked.
                        
                           
17. Feare.] 39. The ſtoutest gallant muſt ſtoope and vayle his bonnet, he whoſe heart is as the heart of a Lyon, ſhall feare when he threatneth.
                        
                           Pit.] 40. Miſerable men that promiſe to themſelues all happineſſe &amp; proſperity, ſhall tumble into the pit of Gods Iudgements, ere they be aware: for when they ſay peace and ſafety, then ſhall come vpon then ſodaine deſtruction, as to a woman with childe, and they ſhall not eſcape, 1. Theſ. 5. 3.
                        
                           Snare.] 41 And when they are once caught and ſnared in his traps, there is no meanes to rid them out: his handſtretched forth, who can turne away, Eſay 14. 27.
                        18. He that.] 42 Let none think to eſcape the ſtroke of his arme, one way or other, the Iudgements of God will reach him. He that findeth fauour &amp; profiteth not to ſeeke God by repentāce, is but reſerued to a further puniſhment, as Amos ſaith, Amos 5. 19. He that flieth for feare of the Lion, ſhall light vpon a Beare, and when hee commeth home and leaneth vpon the wall, a ſerpent ſhall bite him. Why then ſhould any man, walking in his ſinnes, flatter his owne ſoule and promiſe to himſelfe peace and happineſſe, when the Iudgements he ſeeth before his eyes to light vpon other, are warnings vnto him?
                        
                           The windowes, &amp;c. the foundations, &amp;c.] 43. How great a God haue we to deale withall that hath heauen and earth, and the armes of them both at his command: he ſet wide open the windowes of heauen, &amp; brought a floud vpon the world of the vngodly, 2. Pet. 2. 5. He opened the mouth of the earth to ſwallow vp Kore, Dathan, &amp; Abiram, Num. 16. what is he not able to do, to work &amp; effect his iudgements?
                        19. 20. The land &amp;c.] 44 Things ſo ordered &amp; diſpoſed as in the iudgement of fleſh and bloud, muſt needs endure alwaies, he can change and bring vnto confuſion. The City of Ieruſalem, how well was it knit and compact together, whileſt ſhe was in her prime? read Pſal. 122. the ſame, how is it now brought vnto moſt miſerable waſt &amp; hauock.
                        
                           Heauie.] 45 Obſerue the wages of ſinne, the weight and intollerable burden of it. There ſhall the workers of

iniquity fall, and neuer riſe vp againe, Pſal. 36. 12.
                        21. And it ſhall be in that ſame day, Iehoua ſhall viſit the hoaſt of that lofty one, in the lofty place it ſelfe; and the Kings of the earth, in this very land.
                        
                        22. And they ſhall be gathered 
                           A gathering 
                           priſoner. 
                           together as a priſoner into a pit, and ſhall be ſhut vp in priſon: and after many daies ſhall be 
                           Viſited. 
                           puniſhed.
                        
                     
                     
                        EXPOSITION.
                        THe 21th verſe and ſo forward comprehendeth the ſecond part, which is the Iewes reſtoring in two degrees. Firſt, is the ruine and ouerthrow of their proud enemies vnder whom they were held captiues: wherein theſe circumſtances may bee obſerued: firſt, in how ſeaſonable a time God will ſend them helpe: In that very day, 21. the ſoreſt time of their affliction, when all ſtrength is gone, 16. Poſit. Sore deſtreſſe.
                            as Deut. 32. 36.
                        2. The enemies they ſhall ſubdue: diuided into two, 18 Poſit. Conqueſt.
                            the lofty one himſelfe, and the Kings his aſſociates.
                        Who is this lofty one here ſpoken of? Gog and Magog. Reuel. 20. 8. or as Ezechiel hath it, Ezech. 38. 2. Gog comming out of the land of Magog, whom there wee haue ſhewed to be the Turke.
                        Which are the Kings ſhall come vnto his helpe? Daniel nameth (beſide Aegypt and other places, his ſlaues &amp; vaſſals) Lubim and Cuſhim, that is the furtheſt parts of Lybia and Ethiopia. In Ezekiel they are reckoned, the Perſians, Aethiopians, Putaeans (or men of Cyrene) Gomer, and the houſe of Togarma, Dan. 11. 43. Ezech. 38. 5. 6. Iohn in the Reuelation, Reu. 16. 14. calleth them the Kings of the earth, and of the whole world. And againe, Reu. 20. 8. The Nations that are in the foure Corners of the earth, whoſe number is as the ſand of the Sea. Will you now take a muſter of all this huge Armie, the Generall, Souldiers, their preparation, the whole Campe, their on ſet and diſcomfit? read Ezechiel 38. and 39.
                        
                           
Thirdly, The place where they ſhall ſo fall: The Generall becauſe he is a lofty one, ſhall fall in as lofty a place as 20 Poſit. Place of Gogs Fall.
                            he, Harmageddon, the mount of delightfulneſſe, Reu. 16. 16. or Harteſby the mount of Comelineſſe within the compaſſe of the holy land, Dan. 11. 45. It may be hee ſhall haue the honour to fall at the mount it ſelfe, in the valley of Iehoſaphat before Ieruſalem or mount Tſion, Ioel 3. 2. 12. The Kings with him ſhall fall in the ſame very land, the land of 21 Poſit. Place of the armies diſcomfit.
                            Iudaea which they ſo ſcorne. But perhaps in ſome more petty and obſcure places: as it is moſt like about the Sea of Gennezareth, otherwiſe called the lake of Tyberias, Ezech. 39. 11.
                        4. The time is after many daies, Ezechiel doth explane 22. it, Ezec. 38. 7. After many daies thou ſhalt be viſited, for in the 
                           6 Poſit. Laſt dayes.
                            
                           latter end of the yeares thou ſhalt come, &amp;c. This therefore after many daies is to be vnderſtood the laſt age in a manner and period of the world wherein we liue vpon whom the ends of the world are fallen. The certaine time is to bee learnt from other Scriptures, Dan. 12. 11. 12. Reuel. 9. 15. which it belongeth not to this place to diſcuſſe.
                        But yet two ſteppes or degrees ſeeme heere to be cloſely 11 Poſit. Time of firſt conuerſion.
                            intimated, one the declining of the Turkiſh power, when that huge Empire ſhall begin to totter &amp; fall, and as it were be held in priſon by the hand and power of God, that they ſhall not be able to hurt his Church, which ſhall be about the yeare of our Lord, 1650. The other, expreſſed by the name of viſiting both here, and Ezechiel 38. 7. which for 22 Poſit. Time of conqueſt.
                            cleereneſſe ſake we tranſlate, puniſhing, noteth their vtter ruine and ouerthrow, following ſome 45. yeares after the other, as Daniel alſo doth diſtinguiſh them, Dan. 12. 11. 12. See Reu. 9. 15.
                     
                     
                        Obſeruations.
                        21. In that day.] 46. The calamities of Gods people are not perpetuall: Hee chideth not euerlaſtingly, nor reſerueth wrath for euer, Pſal. 103. 9.
                        
                           
When their caſe is moſt deſperate and all humane help faileth, then is Gods help ready at hand for them. As in the 47 deliuerance at the red Sea and in many other ſtories is euident to be ſeene.
                        When God hath done afflicting of his children by the hand of the wicked and vngodly, he will caſt the rod in 48. the fire and render affliction to thoſe that afflict vs, 2. Theſ. 1. 6. Eſay 10. 5. &amp;c. Woe to Aſhur the ſtaffe of my wrath, &amp;c, But when the Lord hath accompliſhed all this worke in Mount Tſion, and in Ieruſalem, I will viſit the fruit of the greatneſſe of the heart of the King of Babell, and vpon the glory and haughtineſſe of his eyes.
                        
                        There is an end and period that God hath ſet to the tyrannle of the wicked, Pſalm. 125. 3. The rodde of the wicked 
                           49. 
                           ſhall not reſt vpon the lot of the righteous, leaſt, &amp;c. The day and certaine time is determined how long it ſhall be giuen them to preuaile againſt the Saints, and then to haue an end: He that ſet the bounds to the raging Sea, ſaying, Hether ſhalt thou come and no farther, and here ſhall the ſhore ſet it ſelfe againſt the pride of thy waues, Iob 38. 11. hath alſo ſet the bounds of their preuailing.
                        
                           Viſit the hoaſt.] 50. There is no ſtrength, no power againſt the Lord: how loftily ſoeuer the wicked looke and how deepely ſoeuer they be rooted, Gods hand will fetch them downe, and plucke them vp as rotten and vnprofitable branches.
                        
                           In the lofty place. 51 Yea in their very loftineſſe he will be as lofty as they, as good Iethro ſaid of the Aegyptians, in that very thing wherein they were proud, he (Iehoua) was aboue them: as if he ſhould ſay, too good for them, Exod. 18. 11.
                        
                           The King.] 52. They that will take part and haue their hands in the ſinnes of the wicked, muſt be content to haue a part in their plague &amp; puniſhment. And here we ſee the truth of that which Salomon hath in the Prouerbs. Let hand ioyne in hand, the wicked ſhall not be vnpuniſhed, Prou. 11. 21.
                        
                           In this very land.] 53 God to abate the pride of the wicked, and that men may bee warned from walking in their

ſteps when they ſee how much God deteſteth the loftineſs of the haughty, puniſheth them by ſuch baſe meanes as they moſt of all do ſcorne. What a thing is it, the Turke &amp; his gallant Princes, his Begs &amp; Bashawes to fall in the land of Iudaea, a land ſo baſe and contemptible in their eyes?
                        22. They ſhall be gathered as a priſoner into a pit, &amp;c.] 54 Oh the patience of God in bearing with the wicked: he goeth euen towards them with a leaden heele to puniſhment, &amp; that two manner of waies: in the meaſure, and in the time. For the meaſure, firſt hee curbeth and bindeth their hands from hurting his Church and people; fettreth their ſtrength and power, and holdeth them vnder bonds: then when that will not profit, he taketh all ſtrength away.
                        He firſt giueth a taſte of his power, to ſhew what he is able to doe, making them to totter and decline. But when they goe on ſtill in miſchiefe againſt his Church, hee ſweepeth them cleane from the face of the earth.
                        
                           After many daies ſhall be puniſhed. 55. For the time hee ſpareth them long, many daies. The Amorites he bare with 400. yeares after their iniquity was grown to a great head, becauſe it was not as then fully accompliſhed. Gen. 15. 16.
                        Which muſt make vs not deſpaire nor caſt off our faith in Gods promiſes; for the ſubuerſion of the wicked though they be long a comming, Abac. 2. 3. If he ſtay, waite for him: Contrary to that, the vnbeleeuers ſay in Ezechiel, The daies are lengthened, and all viſion periſheth. Ezech. 12. 22.
                        For we runne by nature headlong in our owne deſires, and are impatient if God come not when wee would haue him. This therefore ſerueth to exerciſe our faith, that wee faint not in our prayers as we are prone to doe. The fault which our Sauior noteth, Luk. 18. 8. when God commeth (in the performance of his promiſes and to the ſuccour of his children) ſhall he finde faith vpon earth?
                        
                        23. And the Moone her ſelfe ſhall bluſh, and the Sunne it ſelfe bee aſhamed: when Iehouah of hoaſts ſhall raigne in mount Tſion, and in Ieruſalem, and before his elders, 
                           Glory, that is, in glory. 
                           gloriouſly.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                        EXPOSITION.
                        AFter the Turke once deſtroyed commeth the kingdome of Chriſt to be ſet vp among the Iewes, as it is 23 alſo certaine by Ezechiel, Daniel, and the booke of the Reuelation, which is the ſecond degree of their reſtoring. This Kingdome the holy Ghoſt doth here deſcribe by the perſon of the King, the Scepter which he weldeth, the place where his throne ſhall be, the forme of adminiſtration, and the glory of the kingdome.
                        The King is Ieſus Chriſt, the Lord of Hoſts, Soueraigne commander of heauen and of earth, and of the armies and powers of them both, that nothing can be lacking to thoſe that haue ſuch a King.
                        The Scepter is his word, the word of the Goſpell, wherby he ruleth and raigneth in the middeſt of his people; for it is the power of God vnto ſaluation to euery one that beleeueth, Rom. 1. 16. The ſpirituall armor, powerfull and mighty from God to caſt downe ſtrong holds, and euery high thing exalted againſt the knowledge of God, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, 2. Cor. 10. 4. Pſal. 110. 2. The rodde of thy power will Iehouah ſend out of Tſion, ſaying, Rule thou in the middeſt of thine enemies.
                        
                        The place where his throne ſhall be, is Tſion and Ieruſalem, whether the Iewes ſhall once againe repaire: not to 23. Poſit. Dwell in their countrey.
                            ſet vp the legall ceremonies, but to inſtitute the true ſpirituall worſhip and ſeruice of God, Ezech. 36. 24. and 37. 12. 14. 25. Eſay 61. 8.
                        The forme of the Church pollicy and gouernment, you haue pointed at vnder the name of Elders. Comprehending 32 Poſit. Churches beautie.
                            Paſtors, Teachers, and other gouernours of the Church.
                        The glory of the Kingdom ſhall be ſo great, that in compariſon 31. Poſit. Glorious Church.
                            of it the Sunne and Moone ſhall caſt no light: of the glory thereof reade Eſay 54. 11. &amp;c. and 60. 1. 2. 3. 13. &amp;c. Dan. 12. 3. What if by the Sunne and Moone hee

meane heere the Churches of the Gentiles, who ſhall bluſh to ſee their zeale and loue of piety ſo eclipſed by a farre more excellent ſhining light.
                     
                     
                        Obſeruation.
                        The Church of God, how contemptible ſoeuer the world eſteeme of her, is moſt honourable and glorious in 56 the ſight of God and men.
                        The world indeed ſeeth not the honour that Gods Church hath, becauſe it is diſcerned by faith, and not by ſence. Howbeit, ſuch many times is the maieſty of the Church rightly ordered, that the very vnfaithfull are forced to ſay, God is indeed among them, 1. Cor. 14. 25.
                        This is the Churches glory, that Chriſt, Iehoua, is her King and Lord. 57
                        
                        That he raigneth and ruleth in her by the Scepter of his word, and power of his ſpirit.
                        That ſhe is the bodie of Chriſt, her Elders and Worthies his members.
                        All honorable and noble perſons.
                        For whether you conſider the outward and true viſible members, or the Catholike and inviſible Church of Chriſt, how honourable and glorious things muſt needs be ſpoken of thee, thou excellent Citie of God. Pſal. 87. 3. In thee is ſeene a bodie politicke, whereunto all other corporations in the world are but counterfaits. Thy head hath a name written vpon his thigh, Lord of Lords, and King of Kings: thy Commons are all Nobles; and thy Nobles, Kings and Prieſts: in thee onely all vertue is to be found, knowledge, wiſedome, pietie, iuſtice, temperance, honour, magnanimitie. Thou haſt a ſoule as it were, which other Corporations want, that glueth and knitteth the parts togither, one vnto another, and all vnto the head. And what is that ſoule? The quickning Spirit of Chriſt, which is God himſelfe that doth vnite and make thee one with him. Happy and bleſſed is he that hath his part and

fellowſhip in this incorporation. No money can buy ſuch a freedome, as Lyſias bought the Romane Burgeſſhip. Act. 22. 28. No freinds nor fauour purchaſe it, but the onely fauour of the higheſt. Chriſt alone keepeth the keyes of the doores of this Citie. Nay he himſelfe is the way and the doore. By him whoſoeuer entreth and is once made free, can neuer haue that dignitie taken from him, but remaineth a Citizen and free Burges both here &amp; in heauen for euermore.
                        All theſe things, which in their meaſure and degree are truly and aptly to be applied to Chriſts myſticall bodie whereſoeuer, do more properly appertaine and in this place are ſpoken of the glorious Church of the Iewes, when the old loue that was betweene Chriſt and them in the dayes of their youth Ier. 31. 2, 3. ſhall a freſh be renued: for which happy and bleſſed time, it is our part and dutie continually to be ſutors, following the ſteps of their faith and zeale, who without vs thought themſelues vnperfect. Cantic. 8. 1.
                     
                  
                  
                     CHAP. 25.
                     1. O Iehovah thou art my God, I will exalt thee, I will praiſe thy name, for thou haſt done wonderfull things: The counſels long ago, are faith, truth.
                     
                     2. For thou hast brought a Citie vnto an heape, a fenſed Citie vnto ruine: a place of ſtrangers, thou haſt brought to be no more a Citie, it ſhall neuer be reedified.
                     
                     3. Therefore ſhall the mighty people honour thee: the Citie of the terrible nations ſhall feare thee.
                     
                     4. Becauſe thou haſt bin a fenſe to the poore, a fenſe to the needie in his diſtreſſe: a refuge from invndation, a ſhadow against the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones was like 
                        an invndation of a wall. 
                        an invndation ready to beat downe a wall.
                     
                     5. As heat in a drought, thou haſt brought downe the ſtirre of the ſtrangers: heat I ſay with the ſhadow of a cloud, which heat did anſwer a life to the branch of the terrible ones.
                     
                     
                        
                        EXPOSITION.
                        THE worke of God in caſting downe the proud tyrants of the world, and thus magnifying the great name of his Sonne Chriſt Ieſus, is ſo great &amp; wonderfull, that the Prophet, as it were rapt beyond himſelfe, is faine to make a ſtop or breathing before he come to a further illuſtration of it; interlacing both his owne priuate meditations, and the hymne of the whole Church that ſo ſhall be collected.
                        His owne meditation (in the 25th Chapter) hath three parts.
                        The firſt concerneth the fall of theſe tyrants, which the Prophet diuinely vttereth in the forme of a thankſgiuing. Wherein rauiſhed with the conſideration of ſo marueilous things, he doth firſt breake forth into praiſes, the praiſes 1. of God, the author of this and all other good things. Beginning with the ground of all, Gods power,
                        And the couenant with his people,
                        Afterwards he layeth downe the particular things, for the which Gods name is ſo highly to be exalted. And they are,
                        1. His power, ſeene in ſo wonderfull a deliuerie.
                        2. His truth, whoſe counſels and decrees long ago foretold and vttered by his Prophets, are moſt ſteadie and conſtant, and take their due effect.
                        3. His iuſtice in executing iudgement, tumbling downe the enemies of Gods people, notwithſtanding all their 2. might, that they ſhall be vtterly without hope euer to be recouered.
                        Which the very wicked ſhall be driuen to acknowledge. 3. Such is the honour that hereby ſhall redound to his great and holy name, wrung out of the mouth of ſturdie and fierce enemies.
                        4. His mercy in ſuccouring his poore oppreſſed 4. people.
                        Which is ſet forth by a double compariſon.
                        
                           
In the firſt, the enemies and oppreſſors of the Church are compared to raging waters that carry all afore them, hurle downe walls and whatſoeuer elſe that ſtandeth in their way: God to a place of refuge to flie vnto.
                        In the other, the inſolencie of theſe ſtrangers, (the enemies of Gods people) the ſtir and ado they make, is reſembled 5. to a heat and drought that doth parch and ſcorch the godly; Gods protection of his, to a thicke ſhadow. Thou (ſaith he) bringeſt downe the noyſe of the ſtrangers as heate is ſlaked in a drie and parched ground: as heate I ſay is ſlaked with the ſhadow of a thicke cloud. which heate anſwered, and was a life to the branches and ſpreading boughes of the violent. That is, ſerued well the turne, and was moſt commodious for the wicked, who thinke their branches ſpread and flouriſh when the godly are ſcorched with calamities.
                     
                     
                        Obſeruations.
                        1. I will] Euery childe of God hath his part and intereſt in the Churches good. Which holy and religious perſons haue preferred and all ought to prefer before their priuate wealth, and to be thankfull vnto God when it goeth well with it. But eſpecially this is the dutie of the Miniſters of the word. To whom as God reuealeth more of his will and workes then he doth to the common ſort: ſo it is fit they ſhould herein go before others, and be examples to the flocke.
                        
                           Exalt thee] Praiſes and conſequently prayers and petitions are to be made to God alone. Pſal. 50 15. Call vpon mee in the day of trouble: I will deliuer thee and thou ſhalt glorifie me.
                        
                        We exalt God when we bleſſe him, and giue vnto his name the praiſes due for the good things we doe enioy. What a mercy it is of ſo great a Maieſtie, that he counteth himſelfe to be exalted by any thing that ſo poore ſillie wormes of the earth are able to do? And how ſhould this

whet our affections, and ſet an edge vpon vs to performe ſo holy a dutie to him?
                        
                           Thee] In the manifold changes and confuſions that fall out in the world, we muſt haue our recourſe to God.
                        They that haue no heart to praiſe God, it is a token they haue neuer felt how ſweet and gratious he is.
                        
                           Iehovah, thou art my God:] The foundation of all our prayers &amp; praiſes of God ſtandeth vpon theſe two grounds and props, his power and his will.
                        He is able to do vs all good. For he is Iehovah Lord of heauen and of earth. His will we can not doubt of. For he is our God and Father through Chriſt.
                        Both theſe pillars we are taught to reſt vpon in that holy, heauenly and peereleſſe prayer, Our Father which art in heaven.
                        
                        
                           My God] Here is the faith of a Chriſtian, when truly and from his heart in the ſinceritie of his ſoule, he can ſay with Thomas, Ioh. 20. my God and my Lord: appropriating to himſelfe the promiſes of God in Chriſt. So could not wicked Saul do, who ſo oft ſaith vnto Samuel, Iehovah thy God. 1 Sam. 15. 21, 30. as being himſelfe none of his. This maketh our faith differ from the faith of Diuels, and from the faith of all carnall Goſpellers.
                        
                           For thou hast done] The mightie and memorable acts of God deſerue and are moſt worthy alwayes to be had in remembrance: for he hath ſo wrought his wonderfull workes, that he hath purchaſed a memoriall for them, ſaith the Pſalmiſt. Pſal. 111. 4. They that are negligent and forgetfull, make God, as much as lyeth in them, to looſe this purchaſe: which can neuer be. Wherefore it is a thing too too intolerable (though nothing be more common in the world) for men to be ſo attentiue to their owne priuate affaires, that they neuer heede the glorious acts of God, which he euery day ſheweth forth in the world for men to behold (as in a glaſſe) his glory in them.
                        Whereunto we are directed by our Prophet, and a doore (as it were) and window here ſet open: things

pointed at, which we muſt open our eyes to ſee. For as the Apoſtle writeth to the Romanes, Rom. 1. the inviſible things of God are manifeſted in them. His power, truth, wiſedome, iuſtice, maieſtie and mercy.
                        
                           Wonderfull things] When we ſee ſtrange and marueilous things, wonderfull in our eyes, incredible to fleſh and bloud; there is the finger of God, his power, and his might.
                        
                           Councels long ago] When we finde the ſame long before, many ages paſt, prophecied and foretold, as purpoſed from eternitie, not ſodainly and by chance ruſhed into: what a prouidence and care is this ouer his Church and people? what a depth of wiſedome in ſo ordering and diſpoſing of them?
                        
                           Are faith, trueth.] When his promiſes ſo long waited for and expected, come in due time to be performed, there is his faithfulnes and trueth. To teach vs not to faint nor caſt off our faith and confidence; but though he linger yet to waite. For comming he will come and will not defer. Abacuc. 2. 3.
                        2. For thou hast brought a Citie &amp;c.] When we ſee mightie Nations, ſtrong and fenſed Cities, that lend the arme of their ſtrength and power to the oppreſſing of Gods people, to haue their hornes broken and to be laid euen with the ground, that there remaineth not ſo much as a ſhard to fetch one cole of fire in, a ruine neuer to be repaired; behold a moment of his iuſtice.
                        3. The mightie people, the terrible nations.] What a God muſt we needs ſay is this of maieſtie and glory, that wringeth out of the mouth of the wicked and vngodly a confeſſion of his praiſes? and maketh the falſe-hearted tyrants, that haue beene ſo awfull and terrible to his people, to counterfeit a ſubiection, and will they, nill they, to doe his Church ſeruice. Eſay 60. 14.
                        4. Thou hast beene a fenſe to the poore, &amp;c.] When the hearts of his poore diſtreſſed ſeruants, in the middeſt of their heauineſſe and ſorrowes, receiue aboundance of

comfort, are kept as it were in the Lyons denne, and in the middeſt of the hot burning fornace, that God is as a wall of braſſe round about to gard and to defend them: lo the riches of his mercie and goodnes. And this maketh a high and mightie wall of difference betweene prophane worldlings and Gods children. For euen they are amazed many times at the wonderfull things that God bringeth to paſſe in the gouernment of the world. But none can indeed profit by the workes of God, but ſuch as haue their eyes opened to behold the things before remembred.
                        
                           When the blast:] God is a helpe in affliction very ready to be found: when all humane forces faile, the diuine power is moſt at hand. He ſuffereth his owne that are moſt deere vnto him to be iuſtled to the walls, yea to be as an old and tottering wall, readie to be ouer-turned with the blaſts and violence of the wicked, as the Church complaineth in the Pſalmes. Pſal. 66. 12. Thou hast made men to ride ouer our heads. But in the meane time he hath the bridle and holdeth the reynes in his owne hands to curbe and keepe them in, when they would go too farre, paſſe the metes and bounds that he hath ſet them.
                        Then commeth his helpe as we ſay in the nike, moſt ſweet and comfortable, as the ſhadow is to one that walketh and trauelleth in the heate of the day when the Sunne ſcorcheth moſt.
                        5. Thou hast brought downe] God is he that bringeth downe the rage and furie of the wicked, and for all the ſtir and adoe they keepe, ſtilleth and quieteth the waues of their haughtie and reſtles Spirits that they can doe his Church no hurt. Many a time haue they afflicted me euen from my youth, may Iſrael now ſay. Many a time haue they afflicted me euen from my youth, but could not praeuaile against me. Pſal. 129. 1, 2.
                        
                           Which did anſwer:] We muſt looke whileſt we are in this world to be maliced of the wicked and vngodly. They loue a life, and it is meat and drinke vnto them to ſee Gods people buffeted and tormented: as the Edomites did.

which the Prophet reprehendeth in them, Obadia verſ. 12. &amp; the Church complaineth of in the Pſalmes, Pſal. 137. 7. So hath there alwaies bin in the world a perpetual &amp; truceleſſe war between the ſeed of the woman, &amp; the ſeed of the the ſerpent: Kain that was of the wicked one, and Abel the righteous, the ſonnes of God and the children of men, figured in Rebecca, a type of the Church, in whoſe wombe two nations were diuided, and the children ruſhed and daſhed one againſt another. That as within we haue a battell, the ſpirit ſtriuing and fighting againſt the fleſh; ſo without wee haue the world that rageth and maligneth vs.
                        The reaſon is, becauſe our loſſes they take to be their owne gaine, and thinke themſelues can neuer proſper, ſhout out, nor flouriſh ſo long as the godly hold vp their head, Ezech. 26. 2, Becauſe Tyrus ſaith of Ieruſalem, ha, ha, the City of populous gates is broken, it is turned ouer to mee, I ſhall bee filled, now ſhe is wasted. Againe, Ezech 36. 2. Becauſe the enemy ſaith of you (of the children of Iſraell) ha, ha, and the euerlaſting high places ſhall become an inheritance vnto me.
                        
                        6. And Iehoua of hoaſts will make vnto all people in this mountaine, a feaſt of fat things, a feaſt of wine in the lees: of fat things, full of marrow, of wine in the lees, fined.
                        
                        7. And he will ſwallow vp in this mountaine 
                           The face of the vaile: for the vail of the face, alluding to the vail that Moſes put vpon his face. A figure that is called hypallage.
                            
                           the vaile of the face, the vayle, that is, vpon all theſe people: and the couering that is ſpread vpon all theſe nations.
                        
                        8. Hee will ſwallow vp death it ſelfe vnto victory, and the Lord Iehoua will wipe away all teares from all faces: and the rebuke of his people will hee take away out of all the land, for Iehoua hath ſpoken it.
                        
                     
                     
                        EXPOSITION.
                        THE ſecond part of the meditation is the larges of Gods goodneſſe to his people the Iewes profeſſing

Chriſt: to whom hee will make a great and moſt ſumptuous banquet, a banquet magnified and royally ſet forth by the maſter of the feaſt, the gueſts that ſhall be inuited, his Court where he keepeth his boord, the cheere and the ſeuerall diſhes to be ſerued to the table.
                        The Maſter of the feaſt is Iehouah of Hoasts. Such an Ordinary can none keepe but hee. Nor is there power in any 6 to giue vertue and foiſon to thoſe diſhes to feed and cheere vp our leane and hungry ſoules but in God alone.
                        The gueſts are all thoſe people of the Iewes, to wit, Iudah 
                           8 Poſit. X, Tribes.
                            and the Tribes of Iſraell that cleaue to him, Ioſeph where Ephraim had the pre-eminence and the Tribes of Iſraell that cleaue to him, Ezech. 37. 16. &amp;c. The calling therefore of the Iewes ſhall be generall and vniuerſall, of the X. Tribes as well as of the other, Hoſhea 1. 11. Ier. 3. 12. 18. Rom. 11. 26.
                        This ſtanding table ſhall be kept in Mount Tſion: the 23. Poſit. Dwell in their countrey.
                            Mount he ſpake of before, chap. 24. 22. really and ſpirituallie the true Church of Chriſt gathered of the Iewes, returned into their owne country. None that come not thither ſhall taſte of thoſe delights.
                        But what are the dainties and Iunketting diſhes that ſhall be ſerued in? Generally, fat things and wine, not of the 36 Poſit. Spiritual graces.
                            ordinary and common ſort, but fat things marrowed, as the Hebrew word is, not onely full of marrow, but picked, as it were, and culled out of the heart of marrow: Wine, firſt in the lees, that keepeth the ſmell, the taſte and vigor, as Ier. 48. 11. Next of the fineſt and the beſt: by all which I vnderſtand firſt and principally Chriſt himſelfe, the true food of our ſoules, whoſe fleſh is meat indeed, &amp; his bloud drinke indeed: the bread that came downe from heauen, and giueth life vnto the world. In the ſecond place are meant the rich graces of the ſpirit that God doth bountifully beſtow vpon the Saints by the preaching of the Goſpell: ſweeter to the ſoule then marrow and wine is to the taſte: as Eſay 55. 1. 2. and which then after a more ſpeciall manner he ſhall endow his owne people with.
                        
                           
The ſeuerall ſeruices, take them one by one, and ſee how they doe excell. 7.
                        
                        1. Is the taking away of the hardneſſe of their hearts, of 5. Poſit. Call.
                            the couer and mantell that now is ſpread ouer all theſe people and nations of the Iewes, the blindneſſe and ignorance that poſſeſſeth them which ſhall then be done away, when their heart ſhall turne vnto the Lord. So doth Paul explicate this place, 2. Cor. 3. 13. 14. 15. which maketh mee rather to apply the generall word, all people, to the Iewes only; as it is taken, Zach. 10. 11. then to the fulneſſe of the Gentiles, who vpon their Call ſhall ſubmit themſelues to Chriſt.
                        2. The happineſſe of this new people ſhall be as if they were riſen againe, life from the dead, Rom. 11. 15. So cleere 8. and euident demonſtration ſhall there be in them of the 39 Poſit. Proſperity.
                            laſt reſurrection, nay of the ſecond death ſwallowed vp in victory, and conquered for euer, no more to domineere ouer thoſe that Chriſt admitteth to his table.
                        3. All inward heauineſſe and outward calamities ſhall from thenceforth ceaſe. Turke nor other Tyrant ſhall not haue power to oppreſſe them, or the holy truth of God which they profeſſe. They ſhall haue ioy and peace in the holy Ghoſt. So the reuelation, chap. 21. 4. applying it to theſe times, doth teach vs to expound it.
                        All which things ſo wonderfull and incredible, are ſhut vp with this, to procure faith and credit, that the Lord hath ſpoken it.
                     
                     
                        Obſeruations.
                        6. And &amp;c.] The great and excellent things that Chriſt beſtoweth vpon his, are moſt ſweet and comfortable, compared to a feaſt; a feaſt of moſt dainty and delicate things: for there are not onely the Word and Sacraments, whereby hee feedeth his outwardly, but aboundance of inward graces of the Spirit, more delightfull to the ſoule then any meate or drinke can bee vnto the body. This is figured

in the Law by the Table ſtanding in the Tabernacle.
                        Chriſt maketh one and the ſame banquet vnto all, Mat. 22.)
                        Howbeit, as men entertaine more honourable gueſts with greater magnificence then others, ſo this ſumptuous banquet heere prepared is ſpecially for the Iewes. The ſame diſhes and ſeruices haue all his children: but heere more exquiſite plenty and variety, a greater riches of Spirituall and heauenly treaſures.
                        
                           Iehoua will make.] God is the author of our heauenly vocation, hee maketh the feaſt, inuiteth the gueſts, &amp;c. Worthily he is called the Lord of Hoaſts that doth it, for it is a Diuine worke and vertue to draw men to this banquet. Though the meat ſet before them be moſt ſweete and delicate, daintier then the ſweeteſt ſpices fetch from India or Arabia; yet men had rather like ſwine to deuoure ſwilles and huskes, then to feed at the Lords table.
                        
                           To all people.] There is none that Chriſt refuſeth, hee biddeth all to come vnto him, Math. 11. 28. Come vnto me all ye that are weary and heauy laden, and I will refreſh you. No ſexe, no age, no condition or ſort of men doth hee reiect: wherefore mens vnworthineſſe ought not to keepe them backe. Here the hungry is ſatisfied, the poore and empty ſoule refreſhed.
                        
                           In this mountaine.] But this banquet is to bee had in the Church of God onely, like to the table that ſtood in the Sanctuary. Thither we muſt repaire if we deſire to taſte of ſuch pleaſures. This is the priuiledge of Gods people. The great ones of the world ſhall be hunger-ſtarued, when they are full fed.
                        7. And he will ſwallow vp the vaile of the face.] The elegies and noble commendations of the doctrine of the Goſpell.
                        1. As the riſing of the Sunne it ſcattereth the miſts of error and darkneſſe, whereby wee are alſo taught that there is nothing in vs but ignorance and blindneſſe till the doctrine of the Goſpell giue vs light.
                        8. He will ſwallow vp death.] 2 We are freed from the

terror and feare of death, the ſecond death which ſo fretteth and gnaweth the naturall man, all that are not in Chriſt, Heb. 2. 15.
                        Yea and we haue life beſtowed vpon vs: life that comprehendeth all pleaſures.
                        Not only ſo, but euen life eternall; for death is ſwallowed vp in victory: and hauing Chriſt who is life it ſelfe, how is it poſſible we ſhould euer die?
                        
                           Iehoua will wipe away all teares.] 3 It miniſtreth ioy in the holy Ghoſt, heauenly and ſpiritually, Acts 8.
                        When Philip came to Samaria and preached vnto them Chriſt, there was much ioy in that City. Hee that findeth this treaſure, for ioy thereof will ſell all hee hath to buy it, Math. 13. Exceeding great cauſe there is of this ioy: for being once ſet free from death and condemnation, aſſured of the loue of God in Chriſt, of peace and reconciliation through him, and of forgiueneſſe of ſinnes in his bloud, needs muſt it make euen the lame to skip like a hinde, and the tongue of the dumbe to ſing, Eſay 35. 6.
                        9. And he ſhall ſay in that day, loe, this is our God, we haue waited for him; and he hath ſaued vs. This is Iehoua, whom we haue waited for, we will reioyce and be glad for his ſaluation.
                        
                        10. For the hand of Iehoua ſhall reſt in this mountaine, and Moab ſhall be threſhed vnder him, as ſtraw is threſhed vnto dung.
                        
                        11. For he ſhall ſpread forth his hands in the middeſt of him, as he that ſwimmeth, ſpreadeth themforth to ſwimme: and bee ſhall bring downe his pride with the barres of his hands.
                        
                        12. And the fenſe, the height of thy walls ſhall hee bring downe, lay low, caſt vnto the ground, euen vnto the duſt.
                        
                     
                     
                        EXPOSITION.
                        THe third part of the meditation, is the exaltation and reioyſing of Gods people, lifting vp their head: and 5 Poſit. Call.
                            firſt 9. by patheticall acclamations applauding the approach

of Chriſt their God and Lord, whom they had ſo long beene without: as the Cherubins did, Ezech. 10. 5.
                        After reioycing at the fall of the enemies of Gods Church, beaten all to peeces by the hand and power of 10 
                           18 Poſit. Conqueſt.
                            God, as ſtraw is beaten to dung.
                        Which hand and power of God ſubduing all things vnto 11. himſelfe, is declared by a moſt ſweet ſimilitude taken from thoſe that ſwimme. God, ſaith hee, will ſtretch out his hands amidſt his foes (vnderſtood by the Moabites) as they are by the Edomites in this very argument, Eſay 63. 1.) as a man ſtretcheth them out in the water to ſwim: and with the barres of his hands, that is, with his large and mighty hands will keepe downe the pride of his rebellious foes, euen as the raging waters are ſtilled and kept downe with barres, and other things ſet againſt them.
                        And then with variety of words heaped together with 12. one breath, is the certainty, the ſpeedineſſe and greatneſſe of the ouerthrow declared.
                     
                     
                        Obſeruations.
                        9. He ſhall ſay, lo this.] How ſweet a thing it is to finde Chriſt when he hath beene long miſſing?
                        
                           We haue waited.] The patient expectation of the Saints ſhall not be deceiued for euer.
                        God indeed many times doth exerciſe them long. They looke againe and againe, that their eyes goe out, their heart faints, and their ſtrength is all ſpent in looking after him, but at the length he is found of them.
                        And then are wee filled with endleſſe comfort, for hee ſaueth out of all troubles, from hell, death, and the power of darkeneſſe.
                        10. The hand of Iehouah ſhall reſt in this mountaine.] The Church of God is as it were his armory where his hand and power, all the weapons of his warrefare are layd vp in ſtore. Thence hee plucketh it out for the defence of his people, and the offence of his foes. And if when he doth but hide

his ſtrength, he be moſt terrible and frightfull, Abac. 3. 4. what ſhall wee thinke he is, when with his bare hand and naked arme he fetcheth a full ſtroke?
                        
                           And Moab.] The moſt peſtilent enemies of his Church cannot eſcape the blowes that he will giue.
                        11. For hee ſhall ſpread.] All their force and power cannot free them: when like the mighty waues and ſurges of the ſea they riſe, lift vp their voyce, and make a noyſe; he ſetteth more gloriouſly aloft, Pſal. 93. 3. 4. the barres of his hands can eaſily keepe them vnder.
                        12. And the fenſe.] Though their walls bee fenced vp to heauen, hee hath meanes enough to pull them downe, and to lay them euen with the earth. Ceaſe wee therefore from man whoſe breath is in his noſtrill, for wherein is hee to be eſteemed? Eſay 2. 22.
                     
                  
                  
                     CHAP. 26.
                     1. In that ſame day ſhall this ſong be ſung in the land of Iudah: we haue a ſtrong Citie, ſaluation doth God ſet for wals and bulwarks.
                     
                     2. Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation may enter in, which keepeth 
                        Faiths. 
                        all faith.
                     
                     3. To a frame ſtayed, thou wilt preſerue peace, peace becauſe he truſteth in thee.
                     
                     
                        EXPOSITION.
                        IN this 26th chapter is the Hymne or Song of thankſgiuing, which the whole Church of the Iewes ſhall ſing to the honour and praiſe of God for ſo wonderfull a mercy receiued at his hands. It hath firſt foure circumſtances going before, and then as many parts.
                        Circumſtances,
                        1. Of the time, in that day.
                        
                        2. The forme, by a ſong. 
                           1.
                        
                        3. It ſhall be a publike ſong, as men and women and all

the people did when God brought them out of Aegypt, Exod. 15.
                        4. This ſong ſhall be ſung not in the wilderneſſe as the 23. Poſit. Dwell in their countrey.
                            other was, but in the land of Iudah in their owne natiue country, and of the Iewes wonderfully brought home thither.
                        The parts of the ſong (as I ſaid) are foure.
                        Firſt, the Churches triumph; glorying of Gods goodnes towards her both in the whole bodie and in the particular members.
                        In the whole bodie for the ſtrength and ſtabilitie of the 42 Poſit. Stabilitie.
                            Iewiſh Synagogue now conuerted vnto Chriſt, God hath ſet his ſauing health as a rampier and a bulwarke round about her walles, that not her moſt deadly and cruell enemie, ſhall any more preuaile againſt her. So they verifie that which you read Pſal. 46. 2. &amp; 48. 4.
                        In her members ſhe noteth foure things.
                        Firſt, the number and the multitude, that all the gates 2. are litle enough to let them in. For which ſee Eſay 49. 12, 38 Poſit. Multitude of beleeuers.
                            18, 19, 20, 21. &amp; 54. 2, 3.
                        Secondly, the meanes, which is to ſet wide open the ports and gates. Literally and really, of Ieruſalem or the land of Iudah, that they may come thicke and threefold thither from all places without check or controlment, as Eſay doth exhort, Eſay 62. 10. Paſſe on by the gates, praepare the way of the people. Lift vp, lift vp a cawſey, take away the ſtones, lift vp the banner for the people. Spiritually to open the gates of the Church by the miniſterie and preaching of the Goſpell, that the ſubiects of the King of glory may come in; multitudes of their brethren the Iewes to flock euery day to the Lords Aſſemblies. All this by an Apoſtrophe or turning of the ſpeech to thoſe doore-keepers the Lords Remembrancers.
                        Thirdly, are muſtered their heauenly and ſpirituall 36 Poſit. Spiritual graces.
                            graces: fiue in number.
                        1. Righteouſnes, both imputed and renewed.
                        2. Faith, which is the hand or inſtrument whereby

they apprehend this righteouſneſſe of God in Chriſt, and make themſelues true owners and poſſeſſors of it. Wherein the better to expreſſe the meaſure of their faith, he calleth it faiths in the plurall, as Peter hath godlineſſes. 2 Pet. 3. 11. The ſame perhaps which Paul in another caſe expreſſeth by the name of all faith. 1 Cor. 13. 2.
                        3. Conſtancie and perſeuerance in this grace: wreſtling for the faith, as Iude ſpeaketh, verſ. 3. And holding of it faſt, which was the Apoſtles reioycing. 2 Tim. 4. 7. I haue kept the faith.
                        
                        4. The ground of all this, a new birth. To a frame, ſaith he, (a heauenly frame, one framed and faſhioned 3. from aboue, that of a wilde Aſſe colt is made a man, by ſpirituall regeneration, as Tſophar ſpeaketh in the booke of Iob. Iob 11. 12.) Thou doeſt reſerue. &amp;c.
                        
                        5. Truſt and confidence, with all ones heart, ſoule and thoughts reſting and relying vpon the power of God in Chriſt; vpon his ſtrengthning and corroborating Spirit, into whoſe hands God hath committed all things, that it is impoſſible any ſhould periſh that betake themſelues to him. For all our endeauours are able to do nothing. It is God alone by whom we are garded, walled in and fenſed vnto ſaluation. 1 Pet. 1. 5.
                        The fourth remarkable thing in this part, is the happineſſe 39 Poſit. Proſperitie.
                            and felicitie which God beſtoweth vpon his people thus furniſhed and fitted of heauenly graces; peace, peace, all manner of good things, ſo farre as is for their good. Which firſt ſhall be moſt plentifull and aboundant, then conſtant and perpetuall: not reſerued onely and laid vp in ſtore, but kept and preſerued firme for euermore, by him that is the ſureſt and moſt faithfull keeper. But this peace eſpecially comprehendeth peace of conſcience, that paſſeth vnderſtanding, and is a continuall feaſt to thoſe that haue it. So doth the Prophet expreſſe in this place, that which the Apoſtle writeth to the Romanes, Rom. 14. 17. The kingdome of God is righteouſnes, and peace, and ioy in the Holy Ghost.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                        Obſeruations.
                        1. In that day:] The time of Gods mercies ought to be the time of our thankſgiuings. We are not to take day for it.
                        
                           Song] Herevnto we muſt ſtirre vp our ſelues by all good meanes to quicken our dulnes, and to ſet an edge vpon our praiſes &amp; thankſgiuings, vſing Pſalmes, Hymnes, and ſpirituall Songs. For the voyce and melodious tune is fit to ſtir vp the affections of the heart, and to beget much ſpirituall and inward joy.
                        So ſhall we vſe holily and aright the things that God hath giuen for the comfort and ſolace of our life.
                        
                           In the land] Publicke benefits are publikely and of all to be acknowledged: Herewith is God well pleaſed, when a whole Nation lifteth vp their voyce topraiſe God for mercy in common appertaining to them all.
                        
                           Of Iehuda:] The Church onely is capable of this dutie. Prophane men and worldlings like ſwine receiue many bleſſings, but neuer looke vp to the hand that gaue them. Of the 10 Lepers that were healed, onely one returned to giue glory vnto God. Luk. 17.
                        2. A ſtrong] The Church of God is of invincible ſtrength and power. Hell gates cannot preuaile againſt it.
                        
                           To vs] This is for the comfort of all the faithfull. For the promiſes made to it, extend to all the members, citizens of the ſame. And thus muſt we learne, to apply to our owne good, whatſoeuer we finde written of the Church or of thoſe that dwell therein.
                        
                           God hath ſet] But this ſtrength neither Church nor any member haue of themſelues or by their owne in herent vertue. All commeth from Gods grace and power onely. We are weake and ſillie wormes to encounter with ſo great and mightie foes as fight againſt vs on euery ſide: It is he that doth ſet his fenſe about vs, and guards our walls and bulwarks. Pſal. 60. 14. Through God we ſhall
                           
                           doe valiantly, and he treads downe our foes.
                        
                        
                           Saluations:] We neede not feare in anything. For it it is not ſlight and ſmall ſuccours we haue from him. Saluations, all manner of health and ſafetie he doth miniſter: If one helpe will not do it, he is ready with an other. Sathan can not haue ſo many meanes to foylevs, as He hath meanes to keepe and hold vs vp.
                        2. Open] The preaching of the Goſpell is the gate to let in Gods people into the Church, and to make them Citizens of the beauenly Tſion. Rom. 10. Faith commeth by hearing.
                        
                        This gate muſt be vnlocked and kept wide open by the Miniſters, to whom God hath committed the keyes of the houſe of Dauid to open and to ſhut.
                        For they are ſet as vpon a watch-towre to keep out enemies, that the true Citizens may come in.
                        Wherefore a continuall diligence and attendance is to be looked for of ſuch, that night and day they ſtand vpon their watch. As that faithfull watch-man profeſſeth of himſelfe he did. Eſay 21. 8.
                        How much are they to blame that neglect ſo holy a dutie impoſed of God vpon them?
                        
                           May enter in] But as they are thus carefully to attend, ſo it is the peoples part to lye at this doore: as the multitude did at the poole of Betheſda. Ioh. 5. ready to goe in with the firſt entrance that they finde. Dauid, Pſal. 110. 3. writing of theſe very times, when Gods people ſhall be wonne to Chriſt, ſheweth what ardencie and zeale ſhall be in them, to enter in at theſe gates. Thy people ſhall flocke moſt willingly in the day of thy troopes, in the comely places of holineſſe, euen from the wombe, from the morning, to thee ſhall flocke the dew of thy youth.
                        
                        
                           Righteous] The badge and liuerie of Gods people is righteouſneſſe and holineſſe, whereby as by a coguiſance, men may know the Maiſter whom they ſerue: for this praiſe belongeth to them alone. And here is a true definition of the Church of God, and of their liuely members.

Whatſoeuer faire vertues are to be ſeene among the worldlings, it is but a gloſſe that quickly fadeth, an outſide onely that neuer taketh roote.
                        
                           Faith] For lacking faith, that onely purifieth the heart, Act. 15. 9. it is impoſſible that they ſhould haue any ſound or ſolide vertue.
                        The righteouſnes of faith is the onely true righteouſneſſe. In vaine doe men ſeeke for righteouſnes, where it can not be had, as Phariſees and Iuſtitiaries doe in their owne perfections. For which cauſe the Apoſtle rejecteth the Iewes in his time from being the Church of God. Rom. 10. 3. Seeking to ſet vp their owne righteouſnes, they haue not beene ſubiect to the righteouſneſſe of God. But when God will giue them an other heart, they ſhall then grow wiſer to acknowledge that Chriſt is the end of the law for righteouſnes to euery one that beleeueth: and that the righteous by faith not by his owne workes ſhall liue. Abacuc. 2. 4.
                        
                           Keeping] This faith we muſt continually ſtriue and wreſtle for: as Sathan neuer ceaſeth to ſhake and to oppugne it. The children of God are faire markes for him to levell at and to caſt all his darts againſt. So much the more therefore it behoueth vs to labour and to vſe all good and holy meanes that we ſuffer not ſo precious a poſſeſſion to be taken from vs.
                        
                           Faiths.] Not one jot or tittle of the faith is to be loſt. Not a hoofe, as Moſes ſaid, Exod. 10. 26. to be parted with. Grow we muſt from faith to faith, but not fall or decline in any point.
                        3. A frame] Regeneration or a new birth is the noble fruit of faith. Ioh. 1. 12. To them that beleeued, he gaue this dignitie to be the ſonnes of God; who are borne not of the fleſh &amp;c. And as it is the fruit of faith: So it is the roote and mother grace of all other vertues: which doe all flow from hence as riuers from a fountaine or waters from the Sea. This regeneration is a new frame or mould that God caſteth his into, forming and faſhioning them againe, as the Potter doth the clay; when of a baſe and

vnſeruiceable veſſell, putting it into the fire, he frameth it into an other faſhion, and maketh it to ſerue for high and honourable vſes.
                        
                           Stayd] Which being the worke of God, a heauenly and ſupernaturall worke, is ſtabliſht from aboue, that it can neuer periſh and come to nothing: for the ſeede of God abiding in them, ſtayeth and holdeth them vp, that they can neuer fall away. It is impoſſible he ſhould euer ſinne in ſuch ſort, as to deface the image that God hath put vpon him. 1 Ioh. 5. 18. He that is borne of God, keepeth himſelfe that the wicked one can not touch him.
                        
                        
                           Becauſe he truſteth in thee] For reſting and ſtaying himſelfe vpon the ſtrength of him who is the euerlaſting rocke, he ſtandeth more firme then mount Tſion, which can not be remoued, but remaineth faſt for euer.
                        Hauing this for his comfort, that to him belong the promiſes of all and all manner of bleſſings, ſpirituall and temporall, neuer to be taken from him ſo long as he taketh not off his hold to truſt and depend on God.
                        4. Trust yee in Iehovah, for euermore: for in Iehovah is a rocke of eternitie.
                        
                        5. For he hath brought downe the inhabitants of a high place the loftie Citie: he hath abaſed it, he hath abaſed euen vnto the ground, he hath brought it euen vnto the dust.
                        
                        6. The foote hath trampled it downe: the feet of the poore, the ſteps of the needie.
                        
                        7. The path of the iuſt one, with all 
                           rightneſſes. 
                           rightnes: with an equall ballance, the tracke of the iust one doſt thou peize.
                        
                     
                     
                        EXPOSITION.
                        THe ſecond part of the Hymne is an exhortation, flowing from the former doctrine, for all Gods people to 4. put their truſt in him. In regard both of his power and his Iuſtice. His power manifeſted in the Church. In that he

is a rocke for their defenſe. And an euerlaſting rocke that neuer faileth at any aſſay. Eſay 4. 10.
                        Towards the wicked he declareth that his power by tumbling downe the loftie and laying them in the duſt. 5. Which is notably amplified by the poore and ſillie means 6. that God doth vſe for the effecting of ſo glorious a worke. 18 Poſit. Conqueſt.
                           
                        
                        1. The baſe and abiect nation of the Iewes, to abate the pride of the high and loftie.
                        2. What are the weapons that theſe people fight withall? Not the hands wherein one ſtrength lyeth, but their feete. And how? feete againſt a Citie, a loftie and an high exalted Citie. No otherwiſe then men deale with baſe and pezantlie fellowes, as Sampſon that ſpurned the Philiſtims with his foote againſt their ſides, and made a great ſlaughter of them. Iudg. 15. 8.
                        The iuſtice of God is euident to be ſeene, in that he tempereth all things, both proſperitie and aduerſitie, to his 7. children, in a moſt iuſt and equall ſort: more euenly then with any weight or ballance.
                     
                     
                        Obſeruation.
                        5. For he hath brought downe &amp;c.] God caſteth downe the proud, and exalteth the humble. His right hand maketh great changes. Pſal. 77. 11. There is no ſtrength, no counſell can ſtand againſt him. Prov. 21. 30, 31. That as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, The rebellious, let them not exalt themſelues. Pſal. 66. 7. See the Virgins ſong, Luk. 1. and the ſong of Anna, 1 Sam. 2. both notable to this purpoſe.
                        6. The feete &amp;c.] It is his pleaſure and his wiſedome to vſe to this end, vile, baſe, and abiect meanes, for bringing of mightie and wonderfull things to paſſe. Deſolation it ſelfe to be able to ſcale a fort. Amos 5. 10. men thrust through to riſe vp and ſet whole Cities a fire. Ier. 37. 10. the feete and toes, as it is in this place, and that of poore and needie ones, to ſpurne downe fenſed places.
                        
                        
                           
The vſe and benefit we are to make hereof is double: firſt, that as he ſaid to Gedeon, Iudg. 7. 2. men take not honour to themſelues, to ſay, my right hand hath done it; nor with the King of Babell to ſacrifice to our nets. Abac. 1. 16. but to aſcribe the whole power to him, to whom it is onely due.
                        2. It teacheth vs, when we are at our wits end, brought to the greateſt ſtraits, that we know not which way to turne vs: yet to flie to him, and to repoſe our whole truſt and confidence in his ſtrength and vertue. For when the helpe of man doth moſt faile, then is his helpe moſt at hand. Mans extremities are Gods opportunitie.
                        7. The path &amp;c. with all rightnes] Herein lyeth a great part of our ſpirituall wiſedome, to behold Gods iuſt and righteous dealing, in thoſe very things wherein the world is moſt to ſeeke. For when all things go well with thoſe that feare God, when wicked perſons, the tyrants of the world, are beaten downe and recompenſed according to their workes: then it is an eaſie thing euen for prophane men to ſay, Surely there is a God that iudgeth the earth. Pſal. 58. 12.
                        But when the righteous are driuen to the wall, and the wicked proſper and flouriſh, ſpread their boughes, and are greene like the Bay tree: then men, yea Gods owne children begin to call in queſtion, either the wiſdome of God, to ſay, How doth God know? is there knowledge in the moſt high? Pſ. 72. 11. or his Iuſtice, as if in vaine we had purified our hearts or waſhed our hands in innocencie. Pſal. 72. 13. Wherefore it is an excellent thing to ſtop our mouthes, and ſtoope vnto his dealings: which, though we ſee not the reaſon, are alwayes iuſt and holy, yea iuſter and more euen then the Goldſmiths ballance, euen then when he ſeemeth moſt to forget his promiſes, and to leaue his deere and faithfull children to the rage of their oppreſſors.
                        
                           
8. Yea in the path of thy iudgements, ô Iehovah, did wee waite for thee: to thy name and to the memoriall of thee, was the deſire of our ſoule.
                        
                        9. With my ſoule haue I deſired thee in the night, yea with my ſpirit within me haue I ſought thee early: for when as thy iudgements are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world doe learne righteouſnes.
                        
                        10. Let fauour be ſhewed to the wicked, he will not learne righteouſnes, in the land of all equitie he will doe wickedly; and will not ſee the excellencie of Iehovah.
                        
                        11. O Iehovah, when thy hand is lifted vp, they will not behold: they ſhall behold and bluſh for the zeale 
                           of the people 
                           toward the people, yea the fire ſhall conſume thoſe very enemies of thine.
                        
                     
                     
                        EXPOSITION.
                        THE third part of the Hymne is the Churches confeſſion or profeſſion rather, made to God, what hath beene the cariage of the godly ones, the poore remnant that waite for the promiſe of their reſtoring, all the while 3 Poſit. Remnant.
                            Gods hand lay ſo heauy on them: which is the ſtate and condition of the Iewes at this preſent in the midſt of their great calamitie and affliction.
                        Firſt, is their patient depending vpon God and truſt in him. 8.
                        
                        The props of which their truſt in God, are his name, that is to ſay, the meditation of his truth, iuſtice, power; and the memorie of him, in the meditation of his word and workes and other holy exerciſes. Pſal. 111. 4.
                        This meditation is ſet forth doubly, by the earneſtneſſe and the continuance of it. The earneſtneſſe in two words, 9. 
                           ſoule and ſpirit: the continuance in two other, night and morning, comprehending the whole day long. See Pſalm. 63. 2.
                        The ſecond thing they profeſſe, is their profiting by afflictions in righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe. For affliction indeed is a bitter root, but it bringeth forth moſt ſweet

fruit, the fruit of righteouſneſſe, to them that are exerciſed thereby, Heb. 12. 11.
                        By the inhabitants of the world, I take Gods children, ſpecially to be meant, becauſe of the oppoſition following, to wit.
                        The contrary carriage of the wicked &amp; vngodly, whom no rods can tame, no chaſtiſement or correction, though 10 neuer ſo iuſt and equall, yea mercifull and gracious, bring to their right ſences, to ſee and acknowlede the excellent and mighty worke of God: for the wicked are neuer a whit the better for all Gods dealings. His milde and gentle courſes doe not mollifie, but conuince them.
                        But yet, mauger their head, they ſhall be driuen both to ſee and to acknowledge to their ſhame, the great and mightie 11. hand of God, his zeale for his people, and the fire of his wrath to conſume his foes.
                     
                     
                        Obſeruations.
                        8. In the path.] Chaſtiſements and afflictions are the path which Gods children are to walke in. You know (ſaith the Apoſtle, 1. Theſ. 3.) that we were ordained hereunto. And againe, through the midſt of affliction wee muſt make our way vnto Gods Kingdome, Act. 14. The paſſage of Gods children is through ſtraight and difficult places: and the lines that leade to the center of our reſt are directly drawn from the circumference of troubles and diſtreſſes. Chriſt the circle of our happineſſe did paue that way to heauen, and was faine himſelfe with his owne feet to tread it, before hee could enter into his glory.
                        
                           Thy iudgements.] When God doth chaſtiſe vs, we are to conſider that he ſitteth in his throne of iudgement. Hee that is the righteous Iudge, Pſalm. 10. the Iudge of all the world, that cannot but doe iuſtice, Gen. 18. 25. which muſt make vs to ſubſcribe to his ſentence, and to profit by afflictions, humbling our ſoules before him.
                        
                           Waite.] To keepe vs that wee faint not vnder this burden,

there is none ſo ſure an anchor to flye vnto as the hope and expectation of Gods mercies: which was the comfort Iaakob took when he beheld with the eyes of faith the promiſes of God in the middeſt of thoſe great calamities that were to befall his poſterity, O Iehoua, I haue waited for thy ſaluation, Gen. 49. 18. And Dauid in the Pſalmes, Pſal. 40. 2. Waiting, I haue waited for Iehoua.
                        
                        
                           To thy name.] Which that we may the better doe, hee hath not left vs deſtitute of excellent meanes and helpes, as wine and apples to refreſh our ſences. Firſt wee haue his name: his name is himſelfe, and all the vertues that are in him, Eſay 30. 27. Behold, the name of Iehouah commeth from a farre, as if hee ſhould ſay, God whoſe Maieſty is moſt famous, will then come when in iudgement of man hee ſeemeth to be fartheſt off, to deliuer his, and to deſtroy his enemies. Who ſhall be puniſhed, ſaith Paul, 2. Theſ. 1 from the preſence of God; that is, of God himſelfe preſent to their terrour: What can bring more content then to haue him on our ſide?
                        
                           And to thy memory.] But becauſe not onely to fleſh and bloud, but in the opinion alſo of the faithfull (carried with humane weakeneſſe and infirmitie) hee ſeemeth many times to abſent himſelfe, &amp; to hide his face from vs: therefore in the ſecond place the very memory of his name doth bring moſt ſweet content, when we call to minde the promiſes of his Word, his former mercies, the experience we haue had of his goodneſſe.
                        
                           The deſire of our ſoule.] The meditation of theſe things muſt bee ſweet vnto our ſoule. No woman with childe to long more after any thing ſhee luſteth for, then wee to long after the comforts which the conſideration of the power, wiſedome, goodneſſe, Iuſtice, and mercy of God, and the ſweet exerciſes of his word doe bring vs: As the Hart brayeth after the riuers of waters, ſo doth my ſoule for thee O God, ſaith the Prophet in the Pſalmes, Pſal. 84.
                        9. With my ſoule, &amp;c. with my ſpirit.] Our whole ſoule, and all our affections, our memory, iudgement, conſcience

and vnderſtanding muſt be carried with all eagerneſſe, and be as forward in good things, as the wicked are in euill; who from their heart, and with all their ſoule reioyce to commit euill, Ezech. 25. 6.
                        
                           In the night, &amp;c. I early ſeeke thee.] Yea wee muſt lye at theſe things night and day, neuer to let the remembrance of them goe out of our minde. It is a goodthing (ſaith the Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 92. 3.) to publiſh thy kindneſſe in the morning, and thy truth in the nights.
                        
                        
                           For when, &amp;c.] Great is the need we haue of theſe ferulaes and corrections. The fleſh is ſo ſtrong euen in the beſt, the worke of Gods grace ſo weake, that his faithfull children haue need of many beatings and buffetings to tame and to ſubdue it.
                        
                           Learne righteouſneſſe.] And this is the right vſe wee are to make of Gods chaſtiſements and corrections, to learne thereby righteouſneſſe. Chriſt himſelfe by the things he ſuffred, learnt obedience, Heb. 5. 8. What need then haue we to be trained vp in this ſchoole, and to take out that leſſon which coſt the Sonne of God ſo deere?
                        10. Let fauour, &amp;c.] Doe wee maruell if all this doe the wicked no good at all? Why, it is true, in Gods Children the fleſh indeed luſteth againſt the Spirit and is not eaſilie brought into ſubiection: wherefore they alſo haue much need to be kept vnder.
                        But in the wicked it is farre other. They had need not to be chaſtiſed and corrected, but to be beaten and ground to pieces; for nothing will reclaime and bring them home. All Gods gracious and mercifull dealing ſinketh no whit into them, euen when things go as they would haue them, with an euen and a faire current, that they can take no exception to, when they enioy moſt their hearts eaſe, they ceaſe not to offend and prouoke God vnto his face.
                        
                           And conſider not.] For they looke not to the hand from whom they haue all thoſe good things, eſteeming it eyther chance and fortune, or that their owne arme hath procured them that happineſſe. They thinke of any thing rather

than of the true cauſe indeed, Gods bountie and goodneſſe, his high and mighty outſtretched arme, their deliuerances to come from him, hee to be the author and fountaine of all bleſſings.
                        11. O Iehoua] A wonderfull thing, and much to be admired (which cauſeth the Prophet to turne his ſpeech, and to make his moane to God) that men ſhould be ſo like buzzards, blinde as Moales, not to ſee the hand of God ſo high and glorious, ſo lifred vp and exalted.
                        
                           They ſhall ſee.] But will they, nill they, they ſhall haue their eyes opened to ſee and be aſhamed. Gods iuſtice ſhall be ſo euident, his vprightneſſe and equall proceeding ſo manifeſt in the world, as ſhall ſtop the mouth of all his foes: yea, to their vexation two things ſhall before their eyes torment them, Gods zeale and loue vnto his Church, his hatred of the wicked, and his wrath that ſhall burne them vp.
                        God, though he beare and for beare long, yet is tender hearted to his people, and iealous of their good.
                        
                           Zeale, &amp;c, Fire.] Contrariwiſe, he hath wrath in ſtore for the wicked and vngodly: their end ſhall be lamentable, howſoeuer for a while they looke aloft, and hold vp their heads. Both theſe are notably expreſſed, Zacharie 1. 14. 15.
                        
                           Thine enemies.] Here is an excellent comfort to Gods children, that their enemies God eſteemeth his: as he ſaith to Abraham, I will curſe them that curſe thee. What need we then to feare them when they doe nothing to vs, but God taketh it as done to him: and who euer hardened himſelfe againſt God, and made his party good? Iob 9. 4.
                        12. O Iehoua, thou wilt ordaine peace for vs: Alſo our affaires thou haſt wrought for vs.
                        
                        13. O Iehoua our God, Lords beſides thee haue maſtred vs: onely through thee doe we make mencion of thy name.
                        
                        14. They dead ſhall not liue, deceaſed, ſhall not riſe: therefore
                           
                           thou haſt viſited and cut them off, and deſtroyed all the memorie of them.
                        
                        15. Thou hast added to this Nation, O Iehoua, thou hast added to this Nation life glorifying thy ſelfe: whom thou didst remoue farre off vnto all the ends of the earth.
                        
                        16. O Iehoua, in trouble they viſited thee: they powred out ſubmiſſe prayer, when thy chaſtiſement was vpon them.
                        
                        17. Like as a woman with childe that draweth neere to trauell, is in paine, cryeth out in her pangs: ſo haue we beene at thy ſight, O Iehoua.
                        
                        18. We were with childe, we were in paine, we did as it were bring forth winde: 
                           Helps could we not haue done. 
                           no helpe could wee haue done in the land, neyther ſhould the inhabitants of the world haue fallen.
                        
                        19. Thy dead men ſhall liue, my carcaſe they ſhall euery one of them ariſe: awake thou ſaveſt and ſing, ye that dwell in duſt for thy dew is as the dew of herbes, after thou haſt made men fall dead vpon the ground.
                        
                     
                     
                        EXPOSITION.
                        THe fourth part of the Hymne is a magnifying of God 12 for their deliuery, aſcribing the whole glory vnto him alone, the onely Author both of their peace, and of the meanes whatſoeuer was needfull for the procuring of it.
                        Which is amplified, firſt by the Lordlineſſe of the Tyrants 13. keeping them ſo vnder, that it muſt needs be the onely worke of God, to enable them to be in caſe to remember his name, and to returne praiſe vnto him for the accompliſhment of his promiſes.
                        Secondly, by conſideration of the power and mercy of God, raiſing them from ſo low eſtate. Set out by a noble 14. Antitheſis or oppoſition of the worke of God towards thoſe tyrants, and vnto theſe his owne children: they once down ſhall neuer riſe againe, nor their name be euer heard of. For Gog and Magog ſhall vtterly be ſubuerted, Reuel. 20. 9. 10.
                        This Nation, the Nation of the Iewes, brought to ſo 15.
                           
low an ebbe, ſhall haue life more and more heaped vpon them to Gods praiſe and glory. In ſuch wonderfull manner that they do as it were clap their hands for ioy to think vpon it, which the Hebrew notably expreſſeth, ſo as no other language can reach vnto.
                        Thirdly by comparing the former miſeries with their 4 Poſit. Diſolation.
                            great deliuerance, the more to ſet forth the riches of Gods mercie.
                        We were (ſay they) driuen into the furtheſt parts of the earth: as what Nation is there in the world which I ſay not hath not heard, but hath not ſeene and felt the miſery of their diſperſion.
                        2. We were in extreame anguiſh and heauineſſe, which wrung from vs teares and ſubmiſſe prayers, one excellent fruit of affliction.
                        No leſſe then a woman ready to be deliuered, when her 17 throwes and pangs are vpon her.
                        3. We were in a moſt deſperate condition and eſtate, 18. no way able to helpe our ſelues, or to preuaile againſt our foes. All our endeuours could do nothing, brought forth but winde.
                        Nay we were altogether dead; and yet for all that, thou 19. haſt reſtored life vnto our ſoules, by thy word quickening vs. As the dew of heauen out of the ſeed rotted in the earth, bringeth forth herbes and fruit: for what is the wonderfull taking to of that Nation by the Miniſtery of the Goſpell, but life from the dead? Rom. 11. 15.
                     
                     
                        Obſeruations.
                        12. Thou diſpoſest peace.] As God is the Author of all iudgements: ſo is he the worker of all our peace, Eſay 45. 7. I frame light and create darkneſſe, I make peace, and create euill, I Iehoua doe all theſe. That in affliction we may learne not to deſpaire; his hand is as mighty to pull vs out, as euer it was to plunge vs in.
                        
                           To vs.] But this is the comfort of Gods people, who

are his fauourites, and depend vpon his prouidence. The wicked haue nothing to doe with it.
                        
                           Ordaineſt.] In this fatherly dealing of God with his Church and people, both the end and the meanes are to be reſpected.
                        The end is peace; for all things ſort for good vnto them. Though he ſcourge and beat them, it is but with the rods of the ſonnes of men, moderately and in meaſure, 2. Sam. 7. 14. Not for their hurt, but that he may doe good vnto them in the end, Mica. 4. 12. Zach. 1. 15. Eſay 47. 7.
                        Which breedeth a great content in the middeſt of moſt heauy croſſes, maketh them warme at the heart, euen then when they lye in their cold irons, to ſing and make a noyſe to the honour and praiſe of God, as if they were hot with wine, as Paul and Sylas did, Acts 16.
                        
                           Alſo all our affaires.] He doth not onely ordain things for good, but taking the matter all and euery whit into his owne hands, frameth and diſpoſeth of euery thing, as beſt may fit their purpoſe.
                        
                           Our workes.] Yea as well things done againſt his Church, as things by them and for them, hee by his maruellous wiſedome that bringeth light out of darkneſſe maketh to fall out for their ſingular good and comfort.
                        Our way therefore is to let him alone, and to reſt in that which he ſhall doe. Not that wee are to ſit ſtill and neglect the meanes hee appointeth for our good: that were not to depend vpon him, but to tempt him. But that when wee haue done all wee can, wee roll our way vpon the Lord to truſt in him, and he will doe it, Pſal. 37. 5. 6.
                        13. Other Lords beſides thee.] No affliction ſo much humbleth Gods people, as when ſuch tyrannize ouer them, that would iuſtle Chriſt out of his throne.
                        
                           Haue maiſtred vs.] And ſuch mens tyrannie is for the moſt part of all other moſt heauy and intollerable, and maketh the Church moſt to groane and ſigh vnder the burden of it.
                        
                           Onely through thee.] There be two reaſons why God

doth ſo great and marueylous things for his Church.
                        One that by helping them, when all helpe of man doth faile, all meanes taken away, which fleſh and bloud doth looke vnto, he onely may haue the praiſe to do wonderfull things alone. Pſal. 72. 18. Thus he telleth Gedeon comming with a great Armie againſt the Midianites: Theſe people are to many for me to deliuer Midian into their hands, leſt Iſrael take the glory to himſelfe; Saying, my right hand hath done it. Iudg. 7. 2. So prone we are to ſacrifice to our owne nets, and to arrogate the praiſe due to God.
                        
                           Doe we mention thy name] The other is to the end he may euer haue in the world a Church to celebrate and magnifie his name.
                        And here is the dutie we owe to God for all his benefits, to be trumpets to ſound forth his praiſes. Dauid in the Pſalmes often preſſeth this argument; the dead do not praiſe. Iah: nor any that goe downe into ſilence. But we will bleſſe Iah: from henceforth and for euer. Pſ. 115. 17, 18.
                        16. In trouble:] See the corruption of mans nature; that hath not the heart to ſpeake to God, vnleſſe he be preſſed to it by hard and heauy corrections.
                        How neceſſarie is affliction, that maketh vs viſit God, to delight in his acquaintance. Whereas otherwiſe we are ready with thoſe wicked ones, Iob 22. 17. Depart away from vs.
                        
                        Prayer is indeed the daughter of affliction: but it is the mother of comfort. As it was to the Church here, and will be to all that tread in her ſteps. Who euer humbled his ſoule in ſeeking God, and went away without finding that he ſought; either in the ſame or in a far more excellent kinde. Manaſſes was brought extremely low: but when he cryed to the God of his Fathers, how did he bring him backe vnto his kingdome.
                        
                           Submiſſe] Onely let vs looke our prayers be ſubmiſſe, humble, and from the ſoule. For proud Iuſtitiaries go away as empty as they came.
                        29. Dead] The aſſurance of Gods power, which

I ſhall ſhew it ſelfe in the riſing of all fleſh, is the moſt exceltent argument to confirme vs in the promiſes of God, hoſe that are moſt incredible to fleſh and bloud. He that can ſay to the Dead, awake and come to iudgement, is not he able to put life into this dead people of the Iewes. Ezech. 37. Rev. 20. or can the condition of any be ſo deſperate, that he is not able to helpe them out?
                        
                           Thy &amp;c. my &amp;c.] The promiſes of God we muſt ſo know to be true and certaine to all Gods people, that we exclude not our owne ſpeciall and particular comfort. Iob 19. 25.
                        
                           In the dust] Of our ſelues we be moſt miſerable, in lamentable and wofull case: as mourners were wont to ſit in the duſt.
                        The worke of Regeneration, which is knit and ioyned with the calling of the lewes, is as the riſing of our dead bodies out of the duſt. As litle meanes there is in vs ſpiritually to quicken our ſoules, as in our carcaſes to raiſe themſelues vnto life.
                        
                           Awake] It is onely the power of God that is able for to do it. He that ſaid the word and all things were made, that commanded light to ſhine out of darknes; he onely is the author of our new life.
                        
                           Thy dew] The meanes is the word, the word of the Goſpell preached and ſounding in the Church. 1 Pet. 1. 25.
                        
                           Sing] This filleth our mouthes with cheerefulneſſe and with gladnes. What matter miniſtreth ſuch ſongs and cauſe of rejoycing, as the quickning of our ſoules dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes?
                        20. Goe to my people, enter into thy chambers, and ſhut thy doores vpon thee: hide for a very litle while, till the indignation paſſe ouer.
                        
                        21. For behold, Iehovah commeth out of his place, to viſit the iniquitie of the inhabitant of the earth vpon him; and the earth ſhall diſcloſe 
                           her blouds. 
                           her ſlaughters, and ſhall no more hide her ſlaine.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. 27.
                     1. In that ſame day will Iehovah viſit with that his ſore and great and mightie ſword, Leviathan the Serpent: barr, Leviathan, I ſay, the winding Serpent: and will ſlay the Dragon that is in the Sea.
                     
                     
                        EXPOSITION.
                        THE Prophet now returneth to proſecute his purpoſe broken off by the two former Chapters, moſt ſweetly enterlaced. Wherefore theſe two verſes and the 27th Chapter following (which ſhould in truth be but one entire Chapter, but that I would not confound the receiued diſtinction) haue an explication of both parts of the prophecie that went before: to wit, firſt, The finall deliuerie of the Nation of the Iewes, in the vtter ouerthrow of the Turkiſh tyrant (which you had Chap. 24 21. 22.) and then the flouriſhing felicite of the Iewiſh Chriſtian Church: (which was touched Chap. 24. 23.)
                        In the former part, there is firſt a Preparation, and then the Iudgement it ſelfe. 20
                        
                        The preparation, firſt by a kinde and louing Apoſtrophe to his people; willeth them to reſt with patience vnder the 16 Poſit. Diſtreſſe.
                            hope of Gods gratious protection, betaking themſelues to him with a ſure faith in his promiſes; whereby they may be ſafe and free in the middeſt of all dangers and perils, as the Iſraelites were, Exod. 12. 22. keeping within their doores when the deſtroyer went forth to ſlay the firſt borne in Aegypt.
                        And though it be a time of indignation, the ſoreſt and greateſt time of affliction that euer was in any nation. Dan. 12. 1. yet is it but a ſtorme that ſhall quickly blow ouer. As that holy Father once ſaid of Iulians perſecution.
                        Secondly, that they might lift vp their eyes to behold how wonderfull a deliuerance this ſhould be, not a whit 21. inferior, nay many degrees beyond that in Aegypt, to

which purpoſe ſerueth the word, Behold, a cryer to prepare attention.
                        He ſheweth the ſolemnitie of this Iudgement. God himſelfe, ſaith he, will come downe from heauen, out of his throne of glory, to execute the ſame. The earth and all the creatures ſhall acknowledge the iuſtice of it, for their 
                              •
                           nfinite butcheries, the bloud of Gods Saints ſhed by their hands. Then followeth the iudgement it ſelfe: 
                              Chap. 27. expreſſing what kind of enemie God will make to fall before 1. them, and the meanes of his ruine.
                        The enemie hath three names giuen him, two additions, 18 Poſit. Conqueſt.
                            and the place of his habitation. All which may note as well the bodie and large ſpread, as the power and hurtfulnes of his Empire.
                        The names are, Leviathan, a Serpent, a Dragon.
                        
                        The additions, barr and winding the Serpent a barr: the winding Serpent. The place of his habitation is the Dragon in the Sea.
                        
                        He is worthily called Leviathan or a Whale, for the hugenes of his Empire, and his monſtrous might and power.
                        
                           Serpent you may call him, yea a barr or long and a winding Serpent, if either you conſider the manner of his territories, ſomewhat reſembling a long and winding Serpent, as learned men haue obſerued: Or the ſorenes and the ſhifts, ſlights and ſubtleties, which he vſeth againſt the Chriſtians; whereof the Turkiſh ſtories are full.
                        The very name of Dragon, the Reuelation giueth him, Rev. 20. for his inveterate hatred and malice to Gods people, the open and profeſſed hoſtilitie againſt the name of Chriſt.
                        The place of his habitation is in the Sea, not in a petie Riuer ouer one people and nation, which how mighty and potent ſoeuer, yet is but one. As that Dragons of Aegypt was in the riuer Nilus. Ezech. 29. 3. But this man hath the whole Sea in ſubiection, the maine Ocean at his command: yea Conſtantinople, the ſeate of his Empire, is

ſeated in the very mouth and iawes of Pontus and Propontis. Which is an euident argument, that this prophecie can not be drawne to the King of Babel, who dwelt ſo far remote from the Sea.
                        The meanes of his deſtruction is that he ſhall fall by the ſword in deadly and cruell fight. Not that alone, but 19 Poſit. Gods fighting.
                            by the mighty ſword of God; who from heauen ſhall throw downe vpon him and vpon his armie, ſhowers of haileſtones fire and brimſtone to deuoure them. Revel. 20. 8, 9, 10. Ezech. 38. &amp; 39. Eſay 31. 8, 9.
                     
                     
                        Obſeruations.
                        20. Goe to my people] God neuer bringeth deſtruction vpon the wicked, but he firſt fore-warneth his, that they may eſcape. So he did to his people in Aegypt, to keepe themſelues within doores, whileſt the deſtroyer plagued the Aegyptians.
                        
                           Hide] When Gods iudgements are vpon the earth, it becommeth vs to humble our ſelues and to hide our faces. Prov. 22. 3. The wiſe man ſeeth the euill and hideth himſelfe, but the wicked paſſe one and are puniſhed.
                        
                        
                           Paſſe ouer] God ſuffereth not his rod to lye for euer vpon his children. He exerciſeth them but for a while till he haue accompliſhed his purpoſe for good vnto them.
                        1. Sword] He hath not onely a rod to diſple and correct, but a ſword to ſlay and cut off the enemies of the 
                              Chap. 27. Church.
                        His iudgements for the moſt part are ſutable to mens ſinnes. The cruell perſecutors of the Saints that filled the world with butcheries and maſſacres, fall by the ſword of Gods iuſtice. His ſword is furbiſhed and fat with the bloud of them that embrued their hands with innocent bloud. Eſay 34. 6. So is verified that which the Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh, Pſal. 76. 11. He maketh the rage of men to turne vnto his glorie.
                        
                        Gods ſword, is a ſore, a hard, and a heauy ſword: it

cutteth to the quicke, beareth downe all that commeth in the way.
                        No force nor fraud, no power nor domination, is able to ſtand before it.
                        The mightie tyrants of the world, whoſe finnes are as ſtrong as bucklers, and cleaue ſo cloſe togither, that the winde can not come betweene them, (as in Iob it is ſaid of the huge Leviathan, Iob 41. 6, 7, 8.) haue a way open for his ſword to pierce into.
                        Let vs not feare man for all his ſwelling, whome it is ſo eaſie a thing for Gods ſword to worke vpon.
                        
                           Winding Serpent] The wicked hold it for a maxime, that no faith is to be kept with Gods people. Frauds, ſhifts, ſubtleties and deuiſes: any way whereby they may entrap and hurt, goeth with them for vertue and valour.
                        
                           Dragon] There is in the enimies of the name of Chriſt, as inveterate and naturall a hatred to the Church, as is in the Dragon to mankinde. No maruaile therefore if they can neuer be at reſt nor peace; ſeeing nothing will ſatisfie their malice, but the bloud of the Saints. Euen as the Dragons, which let their gorge be neuer ſo full, their kinde carrieth them to the prey.
                        2. In that ſame day: a vineyard of red wine, ſing yee vnto it.
                        
                     
                     
                        EXPOSITION.
                        HItherto of the ouerthrow of their enemies. The ſecond branch (which is the felicity of the Iewiſh Chriſtian Church) hath fiue ſteps or degrees.
                        Firſt, is the Plantation or firſt erecting of this Church, noted vnder the ſimilitude of a vineyard planted.
                        Her excellency vpon the firſt erecting, is ſet forth by two adioynts. 33 Poſit. Glorious church
                           
                        
                        1. In calling it a vineyard of red, that is, of the beſt and

moſt generous VVine, Prou. 23. 31.
                        2. In that they ſhall ſing for ioy of this plantation, as when vpon the building of the ſecond Temple, the people ſung and ſhouted, grace, grace vnto it, Zach. 4. 7.
                     
                     
                        Obſeruations.
                        2. Vineyard.] The Church of God is a vineyard of the 2. Lords owne planting, his hand doth ſet and graffe all the plants of it.
                        
                           Red wine.] It is in the ſight of God, and ſo ought to be to vs, as precious and ſweet as the beſt and moſt pleaſant wine is vnto the taſte.
                        
                           Sing.] Wee are to ioy and take comfort in the good of the Church when it proſpereth and fareth well. As in the Pſalmes on the contrary part they grieue and mourne that the wilde beaſt of the Forreſt did tread it vnder foor, Pſal. 8. 12. &amp;c.
                        And here is a notable argument or ſubiect of our ſongs. Thoſe that haue learning and eloquence, let them try their wits in this. Such as excell in Poetry, may here finde matter to exerciſe their pennes. And this is a holy vſe of the gifts that God hath giuen vs, when with Dauid the ſweet ſinger of Iſraell, our pennes walke to publiſh Gods praiſes, and when wee vtter our Poemes in commendation of his word and workes vnto his people.
                        3. I Iehova doe keepe it, euery moment will I water it: leaſt any aſſaile it, night and day will I keepe it.
                        
                        4. Furie is not in mee: who ſo ſhall ſet me with bryar and thorne into battell, I will march through it and fire them out of it at once.
                        
                        5. Or he ſhall take holde of my ſtrength, make peace with me: peace ſhall he make with me.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                        EXPOSITION.
                        THe ſecond ſtep is the Preſeruation or Gods prouidence and care of the Church thus planted, to be ſeene three manner of waies.
                        Firſt, towards the Church it ſelfe, he keepeth it, and is as a wall of fire round about, Zach. 2. 9. Moreouer he doth 3. 
                           41. Poſit. Safety of the Church.
                            water it euery moment by the raine or dew of his Word and grace. So he hath his part, not onely in her planting, but in her watering.
                        The ſecond thing is in regard of the enemies of the Church, prophane perſons, leſt any ſuch ſhould viſit, that is to ſay, rudely and vnmannerly ruſh vpon it, he gardeth it night and day.
                        The third thing is toward Hypocrites that lurke in the boſome of the Church, for all that are of Iſrael, are not Iſrael, 
                           4. 
                           Rom. 9. Neither becauſe they are among vs, are they therefore of vs. They went out from vs, but they were not of vs, for if they had beene of vs, they would haue abidden with vs, ſaith the Apoſtle, 1. Ioh. 2. 19. But (ſaith God) howſoeuer there be in the Church ſecret enemies which prouoke my wrath by their offences, yet will I not therefore ſuffer mine anger to riſe againſt mine owne heritage: I haue waies &amp; meanes enough to bring them downe, and yet to preſerue my people; for if any with his briars and thornes, that is, by his malicious wickedneſſe doe offend, and as it were ſting and pricke mee, I will eyther in Iuſtice puniſh him (marching vp and downe in warre-like manner, yet warely, without touch or preiudice to the Church) or force him by true repentance and acknowledgement of his fault, to take mee by the arme and hold my hand from ſtriking or ſending 5. forth the fire of my wrath, that ſo he may taſte my mercy.
                     
                     
                        Obſeruations.
                        3. I Iehova keepe it.] God not only planteth, but gardeth

and protecteth his Church. This is her reioyſing, that ſhe is kept of ſuch a worthy keeper.
                        
                           Water it.] Wee are of our ſelues as the dry heath, as the barren and parched ground, vnable to bring any fruit but by ſpeciall watering, and Gods bleſſing.
                        The Word of God is that whereby hee watereth his Church, and maketh it fertile and fruitfull. It is our duty therefore to wait for it, with as great earneſtneſſe as the dry and ſtony ground doth for raine to fall from heauen.
                        
                           Euery moment.] And this watering muſt be continually, euery moment our hungry bodies haue not ſo much need of refreſhing at their ordinary meales, as our thirſty ſoules haue of this ſpirituall and heauenly moiſture.
                        
                           Leaſt any aſſaile it.] The Church, that is moſt amiable and worthie to be loued of all, is not without deadly and ſworne enemies that from their ſoule ſeeke her ruine and ouerthrow. Theſe enemies are reſtleſſe day and night, they watch to doe her miſchiefe.
                        But our comfort is, wee haue one more watchfull then they. The watchman of Iſraell that neyther ſlumbreth nor ſleepeth, and who keepeth vs day and night.
                        4. There is no rage.] There be alwaies hypocrites left in the Church to exerciſe the faith &amp; patience of the Saints.
                        God knoweth how to free the godly and to reſerue the wicked vnto puniſhment, 2. Pet. 2.
                        Note here three forcible arguments to keepe men from ſinne.
                        
                           With bryar.] 1. Sinne is as brambles or bryars to pricke God, and to gall him to the heart.
                        
                           Set me into battell.] 2. It biddeth God battell, and as a Herauld proclaimeth warre betweene him and vs. And to ſpeake with the Apoſtle, Shall wee prouoke God to wrath? are we ſtronger then hee? 1. Cor. 10. 22. Who euer hardened himſelfe againſt God and proſpered? Iob 9. 4.
                        
                           Fire I will cut him out of her.] 3. It draweth iudgement vpon our ſelues: yea the vtter ruine and deſtruction of our ſoules.
                        
                           
There be alſo three forcible arguments to be drawne from hence, that ſhould moue vs to repentance, anſwering thoſe former three.
                        5. Lay hold on my ſtrength. 1 Where ſin bideth battell to God, who is too hard for vs. Repentance taketh him by the arme, and holdeth his hand that it ſhould not ſtrike vs.
                        
                           And make.] 2. Where ſinne galleth and fretteth God, Repentance doth mediate peace with him.
                        
                           He ſhall make.] 3. It not onely mediateth, but procureth firme peace and Concord: and ſo preuenteth his iudgements that would otherwiſe come vpon vs.
                        6. As touching thoſe to come, hee ſhall cauſe Iaakob to take root, Iſrael ſhall bloſſome and bud: and they ſhall fill the face of the inhabited world with increaſe.
                        
                        7. Hath hee ſmitten him 
                           According to the ſtroke of his ſmiter. 
                           as he ſmote his ſmiter: or is hee ſlaine according to the ſlaughter of thoſe that were ſlaine by him?
                        
                        8. In meaſure, when thou ſendeſt it forth, doſt thou debate with it? him he taketh away with that his rough blast, as in the day of the eaſterly winde.
                        
                        9. Wherefore by this ſhall the iniquity of Iaakob be purged and this is all the fruit, that he may put away his ſinne: when he ſhall make all the ſtones of the Altar as chalke stones broken in pieces, the Groaues and Sunne-images ſhall not ſtand vp.
                        
                        10. But his fenſed City ſhall be deſolate, pleaſant habitation diſmiſſed and forſaken like a wilderneſſe: There ſhall the calfe feede, and there lye downe, and conſume the branches of it.
                        
                        11. When the bough thereof is drie, the twigs ſhall be broken off, women ſhall come and ſet it on fire: for hee is not a people 
                           Of vnderſtanding. 
                           of any vnderſtanding, therefore he that made him, will not haue mercy on him, and he that formed him, will not ſhew him grace.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                        EXPOSITION.
                        THe third ſtep is the Adornation or bleſſing which hee will beſtow vpon the Church, planted, kept, and watered: 6. and they are three.
                        1. Stabilitie, being faſt rooted and fixed that nothing can ſhake their faith. And hereof the Lord himſelfe is the 42 Poſit. Stability of the Church.
                            Author, whoſe right hand as it doth ſet and plant them, water and manure them, ſo it doth root and make them ſpread, And who then dare offer to plucke them vp?
                        2. Beauty, in the goodly ſpreading and bloſſoming of their branches. 39 Poſit. Proſperitie.
                           
                        
                        3. Fruitfulneſſe and fecundity, diſperſing farre and neere the fruits of their Faith. 38 Poſit. Multitude of beleeuers.
                           
                        
                        Theſe bleſſings are amplified by a diſſimilitude of Gods dealing with thoſe Tyrants, of whom he ſpake before, and 7. towards his owne people. Firſt propounded, verſ. 9. hath God ſmitten (his owne people the Iewes) as hee hath ſmitten the enemy that ſmote them? or are his owne people ſlaughtered in that kinde as thoſe are ſlaughtered, whoſe hand God vſeth to ſlaughter them?
                        Then is it ſpecified in two inſtances.
                        Firſt, in the diuers manner of afflicting. With his people 8. God dealeth.
                        1. Moderately, and in meaſure.
                        2. In gentle and louing manner: for though he diſperſe and ſcatter them into hard and cruell bondage, it is but as it were a ſending of them forth abroad into the world; a tranſlating of them into another place, whence they may be taken vp and replanted in their natiue ſoyle, ſo as there is hope for them to ſpring anew, farre otherwiſe it is with the wicked: for,
                        1. To him it is boy ſterouſly and roughly.
                        2. Hee doth vtterly ſweep him away, and pull him vp by the rootes, that his place ſhall be found no more. As before, chap. 26. 14.
                        Secondly, in the diuers end: to his people the Iewes

whom his purpoſe is to call (for ſo doth the Apoſtle apply this place, Rom. 11, 27. Chaſtiſements and afflictions ſerue to purge iniquitie, and to bring them to Chriſt through faith and true repentance, teſtifying the ſame by aboliſhing all falſe worſhip and ſeruice, that nothing may ſtand or hold vp the head which is enemy to Gods glory, but be throwne downe and aboliſhed.
                        But Gods hand vpon the wicked is to their vtter ruine: how ſtrong ſoeuer they ſeeme vnto themſelues, and neuer 10. ſo pleaſantly ſeated, all ſhall be made a wilderneſſe; God will turne things vpſide downe, from the loweſt twigge to the top branch.
                        Which on Gods partis a thing moſt eaſie and moſt iuſt: ſo eaſie, euen when he dealeth with the ſtouteſt of them, 11. that hee ſtandeth not in need of any great meanes for the matter. A company of ſilly women ſhall be ſufficient to doe the feat. Againe, it is moſt iuſt, for the wicked haue no wiſedome, nor will learne, no not by ſtripes and puniſhments. Therefore he that made and formed them, in whoſe hands they are as clay in the hands of the Potter, though they be his owne worke, the creatures whom his fingers haue faſhioned and made, will ſhew no fauour vnto them, but they ſhall vtterly be done away.
                     
                     
                        Obſeruations.
                        6. Touching thoſe to come.] The right hand of the Lord doth bring great changes.
                        His arme is no more powerfull to tumble, caſt downe, lay waſte and deſolate a moſt flouriſhing ſtate and people when they ſinne againſt him, then it is to ſet vp and aduance the moſt miſerable and forlorne that turne vnto him, Read Pſal. 107. 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38.
                        
                           Make to roote, &amp;c.] Here is Gods might and greatnes euident to be ſeene: but behold his loue and kindneſſe to his Church. He is not content to plant and keepe it, to water and manure it; but hee beſtoweth all that is requiſite,

whereby it may grow and flouriſh. Hee maketh it ſtrong and faire, full of goodly fruit.
                        The ſtrength therefore of the Church and all the good of it commeth from God alone, from his prouidence and preſence, Pſal. 125. 1.
                        7. 8. 9. 10. 11. In meaſure, &amp;c.] Withall note the difference of his dealing with the wicked and his owne children. Vpon theſe doth he but ſprinkle a parcell of his wrath, ſome few ſparks of diſpleaſure: but the wicked hee vtterly conſumeth and burneth vp with the fire of his indignation, Eſay 42. 25. and 66. 15.
                        
                           By this, &amp;c.] Obſerue two notable things touching afflictions.
                        1. Their ſingular and incomparable vſe: to purge iniquity, to pardon and forgiue offences.
                        2. The perſons that ſo profit by it: Iacob, the Church and true Iſraell of God: for this is not by any vertue or quality inherent in afflictions, ſeeing the wicked taſte of this cup as well as others, and are neuer a whit the better: but by the mercy and goodneſſe of God, ſanctifying the ſame for ſo excellent a vſe vnto his children.
                        
                           The iniquity of Iacob.] Forgiueneſſe of ſinnes is the peculiar priuiledge of Gods children, a treaſure which he hideth and layeth vp in the Church alone, Pſal. 130. 8. Hee vedeemeth Iſrael from all his iniquities, Micah 7. 18. Who is a mighty God like to thee, that pardoneth iniquity and paſſeth by the tranſgreſſion of the remnant of his inheritance? Wherefore worthily in the articles of our Faith (that which wee call the Apoſtles Creed) after beleeuing that there is a holy Catholike Church, this among many other things proper thereunto is one. I beleeue the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes.
                        
                        Neyther is there any ſinne ſo foule that Faith in the bloud of Chriſt doth not waſh away, Eſay 1. 18.
                        What ſinne like vnto Idolatry? that maketh a diuorce betweene God and vs, diſſolueth the ſpirituall marriageknot, as Adultery doth the carnall: yet lo, euen this truely repented of, findeth grace and mercy at the hand of God.

Notable to that purpoſe is the place of Ieremie, Ier. 3. 1. If a man put away his wife, and ſhe goe from him, and become another mans, will he returne vnto her any more, ſhould not that ſame land be defiled? But thou haſt playd the harlot with many friends, yet returne to me, the ſpeech of Iehova.
                        
                        All ſinnes therefore to Gods children are veniall, pardonable, and pardoned in Chriſt. As on the other ſide to thoſe that are not in him, the leaſt ſinne is mortall, damnable, and bringeth damnation. This doctrine tendeth not to giue men ſcope to ſinne, but to comfort poore repentants that haue ſinned.
                        
                           Be purged.] But how come ſinnes, eſpecially ſo great and heinous, thus to be remitted? By the onely purgation that Chriſt hath made, Heb. 1. 3. who vpon the croſſe paid the full price and ranſome for them. And this one purgation of his ouerthroweth all falſe and phantaſticall purgatories that the idle braine of mans wit hath inuented.
                        
                           When he ſhall make all the ſtones of the Altar, &amp;c.] With forgiueneſſe of ſinnes is ioyned true repentance as an inſeparable companion, or rather (in nature, not in time) the forerunner of it, Acts 3. 3. Repent and conuert that your ſinnes may be blotted out.
                        
                        There be certaine notes and marks whereby true repentance doth teſtifie and bewray it ſelfe.
                        1. A holy deteſtation of ſinne, thoſe ſinnes eſpecially which are moſt lift vp againſt the glory of God, and whereby we haue moſt prouoked him to anger.
                        2. To remoue all meanes and occaſions of ſinne demoliſhing and caſting downe whatſoeuer is againſt the glorie of God.
                        3. Vtterly to forſake ſinne, and not to reſort any more as a dog vnto his vomit, or as the Sow that is waſhed, to the wallowing in the mire, 2. Pet. 2.
                        This is it he meaneth by ſaying, the groaues and the Sunne-images ſhall not ſtand vp. that is, ſhall ſo be throwne downe and made away, that they ſhall neuer be reedified.
                        
                           
13. A people of no vnderſtanding] True wisedome is in the feare of God, which is the fountaine and beginning, the prime and principalitie of all wiſedome. Prov. 17. He is a foole by the conſtant verdict of the wiſeſt, and hath no iot of vnderſtanding, that careth not to decke and adorne himſelfe herewith. Let men brag neuer ſo much of their prudence in counſell, their deepe reaches and profound policies to ſway ſcepters, manage Common-wealths and Kingdomes: if they refuſe the feare of God, reject his word, where onely this feare is to be learnt, whereof can there be any wiſedome in them? Ier. 5. 9. Though they ſeeme as wiſe as the King of Tyrus was in his owne imagination, they ſhall dye the death of the vncircumciſed. Ezech. 28.

                     THeſe words are a part of the meſſage which the Angell Gabriel ſent Ambaſſador from the God of heauen had in commiſſion to deliuer to our Prophet. It is a noble Propheſie of the ſtate of Gods people, how after the winter of 70. yeares captiuity, there ſhould come a ſpring of 70. times ſeauen yeares continuance in their land and country. In vvhich

time the Temple and Citie ſhall be built anew, Chriſt the Lord of the Temple by his perſonall preſence ſhall aboliſh the legall worſhip, and at the laſt in fact take it quite away, deſtroying both Temple and City by the Romaine Armies, which iuſtly ſhall light vpon their heads for refuſing the ſaluation which this great Prophet their Lord and redeemer came into the world to bring vnto them.
                  Three queſtions heere naturally ariſe vpon the vnfolding whereof the vnderſtanding of this Scripture doth much depend: one from what time theſe 70. ſeauens take their beginning: another when they determine and haue an end: the third, who ſhould be the Meſſiah here ſpoken of. For the diſcuſſing of theſe, and to bring ſome light to ſo darke and difficult a peece of Scripture, ſomewhat muſt firſt be ſaid of the 70. yeares captiuity, and of Darius the Mede, and Cyrus King of Perſia, that brought an end vnto it.
                  There were 3. captiuities of Gods people all mentioned, 2. Chron. 36. and 2. Kings 24. and 25.
                  The firſt towards the end of the third yeare of Iehoiakim, and the beginning of his fourth, being the firſt yeare of Nabuchadnetſar, when Daniel and his fellowes were led away captiues, Ier. 25. 1. Dan. 1. 1.
                  The ſecond vnder Iehoiacin or Iechonia about the eight yeare of Nabuchadnetzar; from whence Ezechiel is wont to reckon, Ezekiel. 1. 2. being himſelfe one of that captiuitie.
                  The third in the eleuenth of Zedechia and ninteenth of Nabuchadnetſar when the City &amp; temple were deſtroyed: from which of theſe the 70. yeares captiuity ſhould begin, is a great queſtion. I referre it to the firſt: for,
                  1. Ieremy giueth but 70. yeares to Babel, which are firſt ſpoken of when great Nebuchadnetzar began his raigne, Ierem. 25. And by thoſe 70. yeares of Babel hee boundeth the captiuity, Ier. 29. 10. When 70. yeares be accompliſhed to Babel (ſo I read, not, at Babel) I will viſit you, &amp;c.
                  
                  2. Thoſe words being written to the Iewes of the ſecond

captiuity, are an apparant proofe that, part of the 70. yeares captiuity was then expired. And thus it may well ſtand that Haggai ſaith, in the ſixt yeare of Darius, that many there preſent had ſeene the former houſe, Hag. 2. 3. for it was deſtroyed not paſt 67. yeares before. Alſo Daniel was not to old to wield the Babilonian Empire in the time of Darius Medus, it being but the 70. ſeauenth yeare of his captiuity. And Ezrah (whoſe father Seraiah was ſlaine when the Temple was burnt, 2. Kings 25. 21.) might be actiue in the ſeauenth of Artaxerxes, Ezra 7. 8. which was 21. yeares after that ſixt yeare of Darius, and ſo 88. yeares from the death of his father. All which things, but by this reckoning, could hardly be admitted.
                  He that pulled downe the Babylonian pride, was Darius the Mede. Cyrus (as Zenophon alſo writeth) was but the Lieutenant of his Armie, and acknowledged him his Soueraigne: For,
                  Firſt this Conqueſt is euery where attributed to the Medes, Eſay 13. 17. Behold I will raiſe vp againſt him the Mede, Ier. 51. 11. The Lord raiſeth vp againſt Babylon, the Spirit of the Kings of Media; and verſ. 28. Prepare againſt her the Nations, the Kings of Media, her Princes and all her Nobles, and all the Land of his Dominion.
                  
                  Secondly, Darius tooke (of his owne authority, not by any mans guift) the Kingdome, as ſoone as Belſhazzer was ſlaine, Dan. 5. 31. And hee it was whom the Angell did encourage and ſtrengthen, Dan. 1. 11. That he might ouercome the Chaldeans, hee diſpoſed of the Empire, and ſet vp 120. Gouernours, Dan. 6. 1. And in all his time no mention is made of Cyrus.
                  
                  Thirdly, Daniel reciteth his viſions in order thus, In the firſt yeare of Belſhazzer, Dan. 7. 1. In the third yeare of Belſhazzer, Dan. 8. 1. In the firſt yeare of Darius. Dan. 9. 1. In the third yeare of Cyrus, Dan. 10. 1.
                  Fourthly, Darius raigne is reckoned as diſtinct from Cyrus and before Cyrus, Dan. 6. 29. He raigned not a yeare (being 62. yeares old when Belſhazzar was ſlaine, Dan. 5. 31.)

and let Cyrus his Succeſſor: for Daniel in the firſt of his raigne vnderſtood the 70. yeares to be that yeare accompliſhed. Dan. 92. So the Propheſie of Ieremie was fulfilled, that the 70. yeares Captiuity, and the Babylonian Monarchie ſhould end together. ler. 25. 12. &amp; 29. 10.
                  But it will be obiected that, 2 Chron. 36 20. the captiuity laſteſt till the Kingdome of Perſia came in. Therefore that Cyrus raigned together with Darius; elſe the Babylonian Monarchie ſhould not end with the captiuity: for the raigne of Darius Medus came betweene.
                  I anſwer, Darius raigne was a part of the Perſian Monarchy; for he wrote himſelfe King of the Medes and Perſians: and ſeeing the Perſian name preuailed aboue the Medes, and that inſtantly (Darius dying the ſame yeare) Ezra calleth the whole ſucceſſion from the time of the taking of Babilon, the Kingdome of Perſia.
                  This Darius was the ſonne of Aſſuerus, of the ſeede of the Medes, Dan. 9. 1. whom (leauing to euery man his iudgement free) I take to bee that Aſſuerus which was Queene Eſters huſband, and that ſhee was not wife, neither to Darius Hyſtaſpis, or any other ſucceeding King: for,
                  Firſt, there bee but two Aſſueruſſes mentioned in the Scripture: this and another, Ezra 4, 6. Succeſtor. vnto Cyrus. But he raigned nothing neere 13. yeares, as our Aſſuerus did, Eſter 3. 7. compared with Eſter 9. 1. nor was a friend but a perpetuall enemie to the Iewes. And ſeeing the holy Ghoſt doth ſo preciſely diſtinguiſh the Perſian Kings by their ſeuerall and proper names, which bring great light vnto a Story: I would not confound theſe things to giue two names to one, and the ſame perſon; that in one place he ſhould be called Darius, in another Aſſuerus, without apparant euidence and warrant out of the Scripture.
                  Secondly, the whole courſe of Eſters Story ſheweth that it was acted during the captiuity; for it is not credible that after the returne of 49000. vnder Cyrus. Ezra 2. there ſhould bee left ſuch a multitude of Iewes, and of that

ſtrength, as at Suſis, were able to kill 800. of their enemies, and in the reſt of Aſſuerus Dominions, 75000. Eſter, 9. 12. 15. 16. nor would Mordecai and Queene Heſter after the Temple built againe haue inſtituted the Purim, Eſter 9. 31. without ſending to the houſe of God to enquire of the Lord by the mouth of his Prieſts and Prophets, what were to be done as the people did, Zach. 7. 2. 3. And in the Letters that Mordecai wrote to all the Iewes which were in the Prouinces of King Aſſuerus farre and neere, appointing them to celebrate that day, Eſter 9. 20. 21. they in Iudaea would by name haue beene ſpoken of, if at that time the people had beene come back?
                  Thirdly, Aſſuerus Heſters huſband was King of Media and Perſia; for hee made that great feaſt to the Princes of his Armies of Perſia and Media. Eſter 1. 3. and the acts of Mordecaies greatneſſe are ſaid to be regiſtred in the Chronicles of the Kings of Media and Perſia, Eſter 10. 2. But I finde not after Cyrus once came to the helme, that they are at any time in holy Scripture called Kings of Media and Perſia, but of Perſia only▪ for being at the firſt a beaſt of two hornes, the Kingdome of Media and Perſia, Dan. 8. 20. this latter that roſe vp after, grew higher than the other and tooke the honour from it, Dan. 8. 3.
                  Fourthly, Why doth the holy Ghoſt, Dan. 9. 1 ſpeake of Aſſuerus father to Darius the Mede, more than of the father of Cyrus or any other, but for ſome ſpeciall purpoſe? And that muſt be in regard of the Story of Eſter.
                  
                  Fiftly, Mordecaies age doth proue it; his oppoſing againſt Haman, and the other things he did in the twelfth of Aſſuerus cannot be thought to come from ſo old a man as he muſt bee, if you make Aſſuerus to be Darius Hyſtaſpis: for from the captiuity of Ieconias when Mordecai was led away, Eſter 2. 6. to the twelfth of Aſſuerus, are 83. yeares: and if hee were then but 7. yeares of age, which is not likely, he muſt now be 90. neither is to be thought that hee would at thoſe yeares begin to enter into the affaires of the State (eſpecially of ſuch a great &amp; turbulēt State) as he did,

                     Eſter 10. Barzillai long before being but 80. refuſed a better offer to be in Dauids Court, becauſe of the greatneſſe of his age. 2. Chron. 19. 33, 34, 35, 36.
                  This Aſſuerus raigned from India to Ethiopia as it is commonly tranſlated. But the Hebrew is from India to Cuſh. Cuſh may bee taken as well for Arabia as Aethiopia; and to ſome parts of Arabia his Kingdome might well reach, euen whilſt the Babilonians bare their greatest ſway: for the Kings which ſhould ſubdue Babylon, that is the Medes and Perſians, are called mighty Nations and great Kings, Ier. 27. 7.
                  And Herodotus in his firſt Booke doth wonderfully extoll the great power of Cyaxeres the Mede (by that name Stories call this Aſſuerus and his father) who ruled (as hee ſaith) ouer all Aſia, and ſubdued the Aſſyrians, the Babylonians only excepted: it is like his territories extended to the Indians Eaſtward, and of the other ſide vnto Arabia and Nebuchadnetzars moſt about Babylon, and in Aegypt, Tyrus and the regions of Aſia minor.
                  
                  Howſoeuer it were, if hee enlarged not his bounds ſo farre, whilſt Nebuchadnetzar was aliue, at the leaſt he might doe it in the time of Euilmerodach, who loſt much to the Medes and Perſians, and was at the laſt ſlaine in battaile againſt them.
                  That which maketh all the doubt is that Mordecai was carried priſoner frō 
                     Ieruſalem by Nebuchadnetzar, King of Babel in the captiuity of Ieconiah, Eſter 2. 6. Therefore he dwelt not vnder the dominion of Aſſuerus the Mede: for from Nebuchadnetzar till Babel was taken by Darius, none of the Medes had footing in that Kingdome. Nay, the Iewes by Gods ordinance were to ſerue the King of Babel, his ſonne and ſonnes ſonne till the yeares of the captiuity ſhould be expired, as may bee gathered by Ier. 27. 7. 2. Chron. 36. 20. And a Babylonian King (if it were during the captiuitie) this Aſſuerus could not bee; for the Kingdome of Babylon was promiſed to Nebuchadnetzar his ſonne and ſonnes ſonne, Ier. 25. 6, 7. who are named

to bee Euilmerodach, 2. Kings 25. 27. and Belſhazzar, Dan. 5.
                  This indeed is a great obiection, to the which of a certaine I can ſay nothing. But ſeeing Aſſuerus was a King of the Medes and Perſians, and euen during the Babilonian captiuity there was at Suſis where Aſſuerus kept his court, Eſter 1. 2. a Pallace for the Kings of Media and Perſia: Dan. 8. 2. Why may it not be that multitude of the Iewes diſperſed themſelues hither and thither into diuers Countries, as they could beſt make ſhift, eſpecially in the confuſion and ſhuffling of things, when Nebuchadnetzar was throwne out of his Kingdome; and Mordecai happily among the reſt might tranſport himſelfe to Suſis.
                  
                  In this City was Daniel the third yeare of King Belſhazzar, Dan. 8. 2. for ſo I hold hee was indeed and not in a viſion: he might bee by the riuer Vlai in a viſion: but when he ſaw that viſion he was really in the Pallace at Suſis. Belike in regard of his great wiſedome hee was ſent thither vpon ſome Embaſſage or other employment for the ſeruice of the King his maiſter: So verſ. 27. of that Chapter ſeemeth to import; for certainely at that time Suſis was of the Medes dominion.
                  The generality therefore of the people might be vnder the King of Babel; for it was the Babylonicall captiuity, ſeing the Land of Iudaea belonged to the Babylonian, and no returne could be without his leaue) though many of them ſhifted for themſelues elſewhere.
                  Perhaps alſo the King of Medes, either taking aduantage of thoſe great changes in the ſtate and Commonwealth that could not but fall out vpon the expelling of Nebuchadnetzar, or in the looſeneſſe of Euilmerodachs raigne when his father was dead, ſubdued thoſe places in Meſopotamia about the riuer Chebar, whether the Iewes of Ieconias captiuity were led away, Ezech. 1. 3. &amp; 2. 25. many other things there bee which might make an alteration, that are not particularly and by name expreſſed in the

Scripture, Wherefore Gods great goodneſſe to his poore afflicted Church did herein maruellouſly ſhew it ſelfe, that at one and the ſametime, vnder the captiuity, in the middeſt of their greateſt heauineſſe; Mordecai and Queene Eſter among the Medes, and Daniel with the Babylonians were ſo highly exalted.
                  After Darius death came the proclamation of Cyrus which is recorded, 2 Chron. 36. &amp; Ezr. 1. That Darius was then dead appeareth by the Memorandum found among the records, Ezra 6. 2. 3. made in the firſt yeare of K. Cyrus: Cyrus made a decree, &amp;c. and by the proclamation it ſelfe. Thus ſaith Cyrus King of Perſia: God hath giuen vnto mee all the Kingdomes of the Earth, &amp;c. If Darius had been liuing, Cyrus would not haue written himſelfe King of Perſia; for all Darius time it was the Medes and Perſians: At the leaſt he would not haue ſaid, that God had giuen him all the Kingdomes of the earth, when Darius was his Soueraigne; neither would he haue beene named King of Babel at that time (as Ezra 5. 13. relating therevnto doth call him) which without queſtion was Darius his during his life. Dan. 5. 31. &amp; 6. 1. 2. &amp;c.
                  
                  Now then for the firſt queſtion (of the three formerly propounded) from this Edict of Cyrus (the time when the ſeauenty yeares captiuity ended) begin the ſeauenty ſeauens: for,
                  1. Certainely, they include the whole time of the peoples welfare; ſo the words of the Angell ſound, Seauenty ſeauens are determined vpon thy people and vppon thy holy Citie: But that was promiſed to be aſſoon as the ſeauenty yeares captiuity ſhould expire, Ier. 29. 10. After ſeauenty yeares bee accompliſhed to Babel, I will viſite you, and performe my good promiſe, to cauſe you to returne to this place. The performance of which promiſe Daniel heere prayeth, that God would not deferre, verſe 19. And the Angell telleth him, verſ. 23. hee was heard in that hee prayed for, and that the Angell was come to declare the ſame vnto him.
                  2. The Angell ſpeaketh of the going forth of the word,

as of a thing notorious: which muſt needs be the word or proclamation that was to come from Cyrus; for of him the Scripture ſpeaketh by name, Eſay 43. 23. and other promiſe there was not any.
                  3. To ſuſpend the beginning ſo long, as till Darius Nothus, or the ſecond Artaxerxes (whom they call Artaxerxes Muemon) were to make Daniel &amp; the whole Church (for whoſe comfort this Propheſie was reuealed) ignorant of the beginning. And then there ſhould haue needed another to haue interpreted the Angell, and to ſhew when that Edict was to be publiſhed.
                  It is true, the Edict was not gone forth when Daniel vſed this prayer; for his prayer was in the raigne of Darius the Mede, at what time Cyrus was not as yet the abſolute Lord: But it appeareth, Dan. 9. 1, 2. Daniel knew the time was now come when the ſame muſt be accompliſhed, and Cyrus notoriouſly knowne to be the perſon that muſt doe it, Eſay 43. 23. So that of this Edict preſently to be promulged, both himſelfe and the whole Church tooke certaine knowledge: whereſome obiect that the Angell ſpeaketh not of the bringing back of the people, or of the building of the Temple, but to build Ieruſalem againe, and therefore that it cannot be meant of Cyrus Edict; but muſt bee referred to the twentieth of Artaxerxes Mnemon, when Nehemie receiued commiſſion from him to build the Citie of the ſepulchres of his fathers, that is to ſay Ieruſalem: it is much miſtaken: for,
                  1. Daniels prayer was for the Sanctuary as well as for the Citle, and the Angell no doubt entendeth the building of them both.
                  2. The promiſe maketh it cleere; for the Prophet Eſay long before told what Cyrus Edict ſhould be: Eſay 44. 23. Let Ieruſalem bee reedified, and the foundation of the Temple layd. According to which words you muſt conſtrue the words of the Edict it ſelfe, though it expreſſe but the houſe at Ieruſalem by name. The ſame being made to fulfill the word foreſpoken of by the Lord, 2. Chr. 36. 22. &amp; Ezr. 1. 1.

Euen as on the other ſide, by vertue of the firſt Artaxerxes inhibition to build the City, the worke of the houſe of the Lord was reſtrained: Ezr. 4. 21. 24. So both were in true meaning ioyned together: And Ezr. 4. 12. the enemies of the Iewes wrought in the time of that firſt Artaxerxes, that the Iewes were a building of Ieruſalem and repairing of the walles; therefore the Edict of Cyrus bare them out to doe it.
                  3. The Angelioyneth the deſtruction of the Citty and the Sanctuary, both to be after 62. ſeauens, verſ. 26. therefore they begin together.
                  This is then the beginning of the ſeauens, their end is at the deſtruction of the Citie and Temple by Ueſpatian; ſo farre they reach, and are not determined by the death of Chriſt: for,
                  Firſt, the Angels words (anſwering Daniels prayer) are ſo expreſſly, verſ. 24. Seauenty ſeauens are determined for thy holy Citie. And againe, verſ. 27. The Citie and the Sanctuary ſo all the people of a forraine Gouernour deſtroy.
                  
                  Secondly, the deſolation that the Romane Army ſhould make, verſ. 26. &amp; 27. and was done ſome 40. yeares after the death of Chriſt, is in the 27. verſe expreſſly made a worke of one part of the ſeauenth ſeauen.
                  The laſt and greateſt queſtion is touching the Meſſias here ſpoken of; for to applie it to any other than to the true Meſſiah, Chriſt our Sauiour, ſome haue branded with the marke of Iudaiſme. But Meſſiah in the abſolute (2. Sam. 1. 21.) Meſſiah adiectiuely taken (Leuit. 4. 3. &amp;c.) the Meſſiah of Iehovah (proper vnto Chriſt, Pſal. 2. 2. 1. Sam. 2. 10.) are attributed vnto other, euen vnto ſuch as were no types of Chriſt. (Eſay. 45. 1.)
                  Many things there are which induce me to thinke, that this place is not to be vnderſtood of Chriſt the Lord.
                  1. The Hebrue diſtinction Athnach (verſ. 24) maketh a full point after the ſeauen ſeauens, thus, from the going forth of the word to a Meſſiah gouernor ſhall be ſeauen ſeauens. Which being but 49. yeares reach not to Chriſts time. To

ſet the points at naught, as inuented by the Maſſorits, is to weaken all the ioints of holy writt. The ſingular vſe of Athnach, you may notablie ſee, 2. Kings 2. 14. Where this onely accent bringeth light to the true expoſition of that Scripture, and freeth it from a dangerous error, which otherwiſe the text might ſeeme to giue countenance vnto.
                  2. This Meſſiah was not to be cut off whileſt Ieruſalem ſtood and flouriſhed, for ſo the Angell ſayth, ver. 26. Sixtie two ſeauens the cittie ſhall againe be built ſtreet and wall. And after thoſe ſixtie two Seauens, Meſſiah ſhall be cut off. Therefore it is not meant of Chriſt; for, Ieruſalem continued built ſtreet &amp; wall ſome fortie yeares after his death. Some would needes faſten a ſtrange kinde of ſpeech vpon the Angell: for who euer ſayd 7. and 62. when he may aſwell ſay 69. Neither can it be excuſed by the Hebrue phraſe. They indeed commonly ſet the leſſer number firſt as nine and ſixtie, for ſixtie nine (Gen. 5 17.) though you may ſee by this very place that the ſame is not perpetuall. But for ſixtie nine to ſay ſeauen and ſixtie two, was neuer ſpoken in the tongue of Canaan.
                  3. It is not nothing (though I will lay no great waight vpon it) which is ſaid verſ. 26. Meſſiah ſhall be cut off, and and there ſhall be nothing to him, no remaine of any power: nothing left of him. The phraſe importeth an vtter extinguiſhment without hope of reuiuer: But of the death of Chriſt the Prophets are wont to ſpeake in any other kinde of ſtile, Eſay 53. 8. By diſtreſſe and iudgement is he taken away: but his generation who ſhall declare? meaning, that for all that he ſhall liue for euer.
                  But to let that paſſe, how will the time of his cutting off, (if you referre it to the death of Chriſt) agree? For, after thoſe 7. ſeauens and 62. ſeauens wherein Meſſiah ſhall bee cut off, there is but one ſeauen left from thence to the deſtruction of Ieruſalem.
                  
                  To ſalue this, ſome reckon the firſt ſeauen ſeauens in Computation, after the 62. though in the Angels narration they haue the praecedence, making the 62. to reach to

Chriſts baptiſme: the other ſeauen ſeauens from thence to the ruine of the ſtate and policie of the Iewes. Touching the laſt ſeauentieth that (ſay they) the Angell leaueth out, becauſe God for his Elect ſake hath ſhortened thoſe daies, as our Sauiour teacheth. Mat. 24.
                  But firſt this maketh the holy oracle confuſed and obſcure, if the Angell ſpeaking firſt of ſeauen ſeauens, and then of 62. ſeauens, and beginning with the latter expreſſly and by name, ſhould neuer make mention of the former; but contrariwiſe, mention only one ſeauen [verſ. 27.] and by that vnderſtand the firſt of thoſe ſeauen ſeauens, which all entendment would carie to that which alone is behind of all the number. Againe, it were confuſed to tell firſt of the deſtruction of the City &amp; ſanctuary, [verſ. 26] and then to come backe, [verſ. 27.] to the death of Chriſt, in the firſt of thoſe ſeauen ſeauens, that is, to a thing done ſome forty yeares before: Whereas in the ſence that wee doe follow, all things flow naturally, properly, aptly, and in a method worthy of an Angell: for, firſt he layeth down the totall of the 70. ſeauens, then ſub-diuideth them into 7. 62. and one (that is to ſay, the ſeauentieth) and handleth euery part in order: As by the expoſition ſhall appeare.
                  Secondly, to leaue out one while ſeauen of the number, can haue no excuſe. Indeed 70. ſeauens may bee ſpoken inſtead of ſixty nine and a halfe, or ſome ſuch parcell; and that is the rule of a round entire number put for a broken one: but to propound 70. and to handle but 69. no rule nor example warranteth. And it croſſeth the words of the Angell in the beginning; Seauenty ſeauens are each of them cut out, &amp;c. He ioyneth a verbe ſingular to a nowne plurall, to note, that euery part and period of theſe ſeauens is preciſely to hold without any fraction. As for the words of our Sauiour Chriſt, that God for the Elects ſake ſhortened thoſe daies, they are manifeſtly wreſted. he ſhortened nothing of that which the Angell did foretell, when he ſpake of 70. ſeauens to bee cut out; but in his euerlaſting

counſell decreed thoſe dayes of the affliction of the Iewes to be but ſhort: for had they beene as long as they were ſore and eager, the whole Nation muſt haue periſhed.
                  Wherefore I take it, that by a Meſſiah or annointed gouernour, hee meaneth a gouernour which the Iewes ſhall haue ſet vp from among themſelues, oppoſed to a forraine gouernour, verſ. 26. For, before the deſtruction of Ieruſalem by the Romanes, there were two Rulers of the Citie: one of their owne People, a Iew by profeſſion or birth; the other a ſtranger, appointed Deputy by the Romane State. The firſt Meſſiah or annointed gouernour was Nehemie, whom Artaxerxes conſtituted Prince in the Land of Iudea, in the twentieth yeare of his raigne, Nehem. 5. 14. being iuſt 49. yeares from the Edict of Cyrus: Hee built a Pallace for the Princes Court, Nehem. 2. 8. and Sanballat in a Letter to Nehemie vpon his building of the walles, ſcoffeth at him, as if he meant to be King of the Iewes, Nehem. 6. 6. which Nehemie there worthily putteth off, as a fiction of his owne deuiſing: Nehem. 6. 8. Whether Nehemie and the reſt were annointed with oyle or no, I paſſe not, no more than I doe of Cyrus, or of thoſe of whom the Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh, Pſ. 105. 15. Touch not mine annointed ones, and doo my Prophets no harme. The Angell giueth him the name of annointed; becauſe he was of that People, whom God had ſanctified to himſelfe.
                  Theſe things praemiſed; let vs ſee how we may make vp this number of ſeauenty ſeauens, that is, of 490. yeares: which I would thus reckon.
                  The Perſian Monarchie, wherevnto men giue ſome 106. yeares, ſome 125. ſome 130. ſome 190. ſome 220. and the Hebrewes generally but 50. did intruth endure 70. yeares, and no more, as I gather out of the 23. of Eſay; the Scripture in thoſe vncertainties, being the onely Oracle you can reſort vnto: In that Chapter the Prophet, verſ. 1. forewarneth Tyrus of a threefold calamity to come vpon her: one by her home ſeruants, the ſecond by the Chaldeans, the third by Alexander the great out of the Land of Cittim:
                     
The two latter he inſiſteth moſt vpon from the 14. verſe: Seauenty yeares ſhe ſhall be forgotten, meaning laid waſte and deſolate, verſ. 15. euen the dayes of one King, that is, during all the time of the Babylonian Empire, who for the diſhonour of lying there ſo long in ſiege, Ezech. 29. is (Ioſephus, lib. 1. cap. 11. ſaith, 13. yeares) did beare mortall hate to her.
                  Afterwards ſhe ſhall flouriſh againe, be iolly and frollicke as the Prophet expreſſeth by an Apoſtrophe, or turning of his ſpeech vnto her, verſ. 16. But how long muſt that in dure? it is eaſily gathered out of the beginning of the 17. verſe; for when hee ſaith, After ſeauenty yeares the Lord ſhall reuiſite Tyrus, meaning, ſhall giue her a ſecond blow by Alexander the great, hee doth plainely ſhew that the continuance of her proſperity which was from Cyrus to Alexander, ſhould be 70. yeares, and conſequently that 70. yeares are the bounds of the Perſian Monarchie.
                  And in all reaſon it could not bee much longer, ſeeing Nehemie, who was no babe, but a Prince and a chiefe Commander among thoſe that aſcended out of the captiuity in the beginning of Cyrus raigne, Ezr. 2. 2. liued to ſee the laſt Darius, Nehem. 12. 22. So as, if you gaue him then but 20 or 25. yeares, &amp; to the Perſian Monarchy but 70. he was faſt vpon 100. beyond which yeares it was not ordinary for men in thoſe dayes to liue.
                  Concerning the particular yeares of the Kings of Perſia, which make vp the full ſumme of 70.
                  The firſt King was Cyrus, who raigned three yeares, at the leaſt; hee began the third. Dan. 10. 1.
                  The ſecond, Artaxerxes, vnder whom the Iewes are ſaid to returne; Ezr. 4. 12. whoſe returne was indeed vnder Cyrus. To him the enemies of the Iewes wrote their Letters to hinder the building of the Temple, when it was yet ſcarce begun; Ezr. 4. 12. which was the ſecond yeare after their returne: Ezr. 3. 8. wherefore hee could bee no other than Cambyſes the ſonne of Cyrus that raigned in his fathers abſence. We giue him with the Hebrewes, after his

fathers death 6. yeares: the moſt that the greateſt part of Chronologers beſtow vpon him, is but 7.
                  The third, Aſſverus, hee is mentioned, Ezr. 4. 7. and ſeeing Artaxerxes is proued the immediate ſucceſſor vnto Cyrus, this Aſſuerus muſt needs be one that came in time after Artaxerxes, though in that place of Ezra hee be named before him. Ezraes words haue this meaning; The people of the Land diſcouraged the people of Iudah, and troubled them in building all the dayes of Cyrus, vnto the dayes of Darius: for in the raigne of Aſſuerus (Predeceſſor to Darius) in the beginning of his raigne they wrote an acouſation againſt the Inhabitants of Iudah and Ieruſalem. And (before that) in the dayes of Artaxerxes, Mithredath, Tabeel and the reſt of their Colleagues wrote, &amp;c. Wherefore Tremelius looking to the ſence, doth well render it, As in the dayes of Artaxerxes, Mithredath, Tabeel, &amp;c. had written.
                  
                  I take this Aſſuerus to bee Smerdis the Vſurper: for where it is ſaid, Dan. 11. 2. that before Xerxes three Kings ſhall ſtand vp in Perſia, they are not to be reckoned from Darius Medus, notwithſtanding he were ſpoken of in the firſt verſe, but from that time that the Angell ſpake the wordes, being in the raigne of Cyrus: ſo as in ſaying, three Kings ſhall yet ſtand vp, Cyrus cannot bee comprehended.
                  The 3. Kings therefore were Artaxerxes, (or Cambiſes) Aſſuerus, (or Smerdis) and Darius. Hee raigned not a yeare.
                  The fourth King is Darius, Ezr. 4. 5. which is Darius Hyſtaſpis: He is called King of Aſhur, Ezr. 6. 22. in the very ſame ſence that Cyrus, Ezr. 5. 13. And Artaxerxes. Nehem. 13. 6. are called Kings of Babel: for Aſhur in that place is taken for Babel, as it is alſo, Eſay 52. 4. Babylon, by the conſent of all Hiſtorians, being anciently a part of Aſſyria, and now in Darius hand, all theſe Kingdomes ioyned together.
                  In the ſecond yeare of his raigne, he gaue leaue to build the Temple, Ezr. 4. 24. and the ſixt yeare of his raigne, hee

gaue leaue to build the Temple; Ezr. 4. 24. and the ſixt yeare of his raigne it was finiſhed. Ezr. 5. 6. 15.
                  
                     Darius that gaue leaue to build the Temple, muſt needs be Darius Hyſtaſpis, not Darius Nothns nor any other that come long after him: for,
                  1. It was one that raigned within very ſhort time after the 70. yeares expired; ſeeing Zacharie in the ſecond yeare of that Darius raigne, bringeth in the Angell ſpeaking thus: Zach. 1. 12. How long wilt not thou haue mercy on Ieruſalem, and on the Citties of Iuda, with whom thou haſt beene wroth theſe 70. yeares, and Zach. 7. 5. the Prophet ſaith, When you faſt and mourne in the fift and ſixt Moneth, and theſe ſeauenty yeares, Which was ſpoken in the fourth yeare of that Darius.
                  
                  The Phraſe, (theſe 70 yeares) muſt needs import that they were not long before ended.
                  2. The age of Ezra, and of thoſe to whom Haggai ſpeaketh, Hag. 2. 3. Which of you ſaw the former houſe? will not ſuffer you to referre it to the times of Darius Nothus.
                  
                  Hiſtories giue this Darius 20. yeares, and ſo much the Computation of the 7. weekes doth warrant.
                  The fift King was Artaxerxes, Ezr. 7. whom I take to be ſonne to Darius Hyſtaſpis; This is that worthy Prince vnder whom Ezr. firſt found fauour for the houſe of God, Ezr. 7. and after him Nehemie had commiſſion to build the Citie and to ſettle a gouernment there, Nehem. 1. Some 33. yeares of his raigne are ſet downe, Nehem. 13. 6. In the 32. yeare of Artaxerxes King of Babylon, I had returned to the King onely at the end of a yeare, I got leaue: of him is meant, Ezr. 6. 14. they built and brought it to perfection, by the aduiſe of the God of Iſrael, and by the aduiſe of Cyrus and Darius, and Artaxerxes King of Perſia. Artaxerxes is there (by anticipation) ioyned to his father Darius Hystaſpis, becauſe the purpoſe of the holy Ghoſt was to ſet downe all the furtherers of the worke together: for albeit the ſtructure and edifice of the houſe was made an end of in the ſixt yeare of Darius; yet Artaxerxes by his decree furniſhed

the ſacrifices and the veſſels for the miniſtery of the houſe, and other neceſſaries: As it followeth in the next Chapter, Ezra 7. And ſo was a coadiutor for the perfitting of the Temple. Such anticipations are common in the Scripture. See Exod. 16. 33. 34. 35.
                  This decree of Artaxerxes was in the ſeauenth yeare of his raigne Ezr. 7. 7. which is not to bee taken the next yeare after the ſtructure of the Temple, finiſhed in the ſixt of Darius Hyſtaſpis, as if by that it might bee gathered that Darius and Artaxerxes were all one; but ſome yeares after: for the very firſt verſe of the ſeauenth Chapter of Ezra giueth ſome kinde of inckling that there beginneth a new Story in the daies of another King. Now, after theſe things, in the raigne of Artaxerxes, King of Perſia, Ezra the ſonne of Seraiah &amp;c. went vp from Babilon.
                  
                  Further of the Kings of Perſia you finde nothing, ſaue that, Nehem. 12. 22. the Catalogue of the high Prieſts, is reckoned vp till the Kingdome of Darius King of Perſia, which was the laſt Darius whom Alexander the great did conquer; for Iaddua the high Prieſt there mentioned, is he that met Alexander. Therefore to the Kings that ſucceede Artaxerxes I giue among them the remainder of the 70. yeares, namely 26.
                  Great Zerxes I put not in this number, who ſpent his time in warres abroad, whilſt Artaxerxes did all at home: And therefore the holy Ghoſt hath him not in his Catalogue, Dan. 11. 2. hee is named a fourth King; but that is in reſpect of the Grecians. And were he King, or no King, all his yeares are ſwallowed vp in Darius his fathers, and his ſucceſſors.
                  The next difficultie is in the Greeke gouernment more vncertaine than the former: for here we lacke the light of the holy Scripture to go before vs. And all other accounts whether taken from Hiſtorians in the ſucceſſion of the Syrian Kings, the high Prieſts, the Macchabees, or the Ptolomies of Aegypt, &amp;c, or from Aſtronomicall obſeruations, and the Ecclipſes reckoned vp in Ptolomie, or from the

                     Olympicke games which croſſe this accompt of 490. yeares, from the firſt of Cyrus to the deſtroying of Ieruſalem, that is the word of truth vttered by the Angell, are vaine, and not to bee beleeued.
                  This is certaine that the firſt 70. yeares &amp; the laſt 73. being knowne as they are one as I haue ſhewed by Eſay, and the bookes of Ezra and Nehemie: the other by the new Teſtament and Eccleſiaſticall Storie, the interuenient time cannot bee vnknowne, though how to reckon each particular in ſo great variety of Greeke and Latin Hiſtorians, it be a thing impoſſible: wherefore let the Greeke gouernment (accompting it to beginne with Alexander, and to expire at Cleopatraes death) haue 321. yeares. Betweene Cleopatraes death, and the time that our bleſſed Sauiour was borne, are commonly reckoned 26. yeares. Chriſt liued 33. yeares and ſomewhat more: from his death to the deſtruction of Ieruſalem by the Romanes are 40. yeares.
                  So then vpon the whole matter, the 70. ſeauens that is 490. yeares, are thus made vp.
                  The Perſian Monarchie held 70. yeares.
                  The Greeke gouernment was, 321.
                  From Cleopatraes death to the birth of Chriſt are, 26.
                  Chriſt liued, 33. yeares.
                  From this death to the deſtruction of Ieruſalem, 40. yeares.
                  Totall. 490.
                  A word now or two for a particular explication of the Text.
                  Wherein the Angell firſt layeth downe the ſumme of all, [verſe. 24.] That inſtead of 70. yeares captiuity, wherein the Land lay deſolate and kept her Sabbaths, they ſhall dwell in the Land 7. times 70. yeares before the Citie and Sanctuary ſhall haue an end; ſo farre doth the mercy of God exceed his wrath: within the compaſſe of which time, (and euen vpon the point of the expiration of it, ſome forty yeares before) Chriſt, the King, Prieſt and Prophet

of his Church, ſhall performe the worke of our redemption: for hee was to come the ſecond Temple ſtanding, Hag. 2. 9.
                  The power of his Kingdome euident in aboliſhing ſin, and bringing in euerlaſting righteouſnes.
                  Sinne he doth aboliſh by mortifying and ſubduing the power of it by his death: by pardoning and forgiuing both the guilt and puniſhment, by the full and all-ſufficient ſatisfaction that hee hath made vpon the Croſſe, who is the propitiation for our ſinnes, righteouſnes (euerlaſting righteouſneſſe, which ſhall make vs accepted of God for euer, and neuer can be loſt as Adams was) hee doth bring in▪ firſt, by the reckoning and imputing of his owne righteouſneſſe vnto vs, &amp; making it ours through faith; whereby wee are iuſtified or held iuſt and righteous euen in the ſtrict and moſt exact Iuſtice of God himſelfe: Secondly, by making vs new creatures by the vertue of his reſurrection.
                  Againe, he is our Prophet, by whom onely God ſpeaketh vnto vs in theſe latter dayes, and in whom all viſions and reuelations haue an end. Heb. 1. 1.
                  Laſtly, he is our Prieſt, a Miniſter of the Sanctuary, and of the true Tabernacle which the Lord pight and not man; who by his owne blood entred once into the holy place, heauen it ſelfe, purchaſing euerlaſting redemption, and aboliſhing thereby the vnction of the Law. Hebr. 8. 2. &amp; 9. 8. 12.
                  The ſumme of all being thus laid downe, the Angell in that which followeth brancheth the whole ſeauenty ſeauens into three heads or three diſtinct periods of time: From the going forth of the word, to reſtore and to build Ieruſalem: To wit, from the Edict of Cyrus, Ezr. 1. vnto a Meſſiah (that is an annointed) gouernour, meaning Nehemie ſet vp in the twentieth of Artaxerxes, as we ſhewed before, ſhall be ſeauen ſeauens which make 49. yeares [1. part of verſ. 25]
                  In this period are comprehended all things that fell

out concerning the re-edifying and furniſhing of the Temple.
                  And of this I vnderſtand that which the Iewes ſay, Io. 2 20. fourty and ſixe yeares was this Temple a building: which is true, accompting the beginning at the third of Cyrus; for from the Edict of Cyrus one yeare muſt be giuen them to conſult about their buſines being of ſo great waight and importance. In the ſecond it is like they tooke their iourney from Babylon to Iudea is ſome 4. monethes trauaile: Ezr. 7. 8. So grant a yeare and a halfe for their returne. The ſecond yeare after their returne, the foundation of the Temple was laid and ſomwhat proceeded in Ezr. 3. 8. So as till that time, there might be 3. yeares from Cyrus Edict. Thence to the twentieth of Artaxerxes, are 46. yeares more: for though the Edifice and ſtructure were made an end of in the ſixt of Darius, there wanted yet houſes for the Prieſts and other neceſſaries, which were not added till about the time of Nehemie.
                  
                  The Iewes could not by that ſpeech vnderſtand any Temple built by Herod, but this ſecond Temple: for this is it that was ſtanding in the dayes of Chriſt, Hagg. 2. 9.
                  The ſecond period is, three ſcore and two ſeauens, (434. yeares) wherin a Gouernour being once ſet vp, ſtreet and ditch (that is the compaſſe of the wall) ſhall againe bee built. [2. part. verſ. 25.] Theſe 434. yeares begin in that twentieth of Artaxerxes, when Nehemie was made the Ruler, with commiſſion to build the Citie; which times, ſaith the Angell, ſhall bee troubleſome: for ſo they were, both during the time of the building of the walles; whereof, ſee the booke of Nehemiah, &amp; during the whole time from thence vnto the end. In the third period are two things diſtinguiſhed. Firſt, is the ſubuerſion of their gouernment. The Gouernour which is ſo to bee ſet ouer them from among themſelues, one of their brethren ſhall bee cut off: there ſhall be nothing to him, or he ſhall haue nothing, no more to doe there; all that forme of Gouernment ſhall vtterly be done away. [1. part. verſ. 26.]
                  
                     
And this is preciſely laid to bee the firſt worke that the ſeauentieth ſeauen ſhould bring forth: for, After 62. ſeauens neceſſarily implyeth, vpon the beginning of the ſeauentieth.
                  
                  The ſecond is the deſtruction of the Citie and Sanctuary by a forraigne enemie, the Romane Armie. By whom the Iudgements of God as an innundation or ouer flowing of mighty waters, ſhall ſuddenly and violently breake in vpon them, by moſt cruell and deadly warre (for there periſhed in the ſiege 1100. thouſand Iewes, beſides 90. thouſand taken Captiues) till they bee brought to vtter ruine, that extreame deſolation, (ſo much the plurall doth import) which God from all eternity hath preciſely purpoſed and decreed. [2. part of verſe 26.]
                  This where in the waight of all lyeth may iuſtly require a diſtinct conſideration ſeuerally and by it ſelfe. Wherefore it pleaſeth the holy Ghoſt in the 27. verſe to expreſſe both the fruit that ſhould come of it, and the time when all this ſhall be done.
                  The fruit: Chriſt our Lord ſhall play the man, that one ſeauen mightily, valiantly and Gyant like (ſo the Hebrew 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        
                      word doth ſignifie) confirming the Couenant with many, to wit, thoſe that are his. [1. part of verſ. 27.] What Couenant? The Couenant of grace, of forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, of reconciliation and euerlaſting righteouſnes: All which the holy Ghoſt ſaid before. verſ. 24.
                  And how did he ſo mightily confirme the ſame? He did confirme it mightily, both in reſpect of the Iewes, and of the conuerted Gentiles. In reſpect of the Iewes, by that Chriſt was to worke within the compaſſe of theſe weekes the rare, wounderfull, and extraordinary vengeance that he tooke vpon his enemies, the people that crucified and put him vnto death: whoſe Temple &amp; Citie that ſtood ſo long and were ſo renowned, hee cauſed for this their fault to be razed and made euen with the ground, Luke 13. 34. 35. &amp; 19. 43. 44. whereby he manifeſtly declared himſelfe to be the Lord of glory.
                  
                     
To the beleeuing Gentiles he did mightily confirme the couenant, by remouing the maine rub that lay in their way, and hindred the giuing of their names to Chriſt: Whilſt they ſaw not onely the City where our Lord was crucified to flouriſh; but the ceremoniall ſhadowes to be frequented which did obſcure and drowne the truth of his comming in the fleſh. And this end Iulian the Apoſtata had before his eyes, when in deſpite of the Chriſtian name, hee commanded the re-edifying of the Temple.
                  The time, is in the middeſt of that weeke [2 part of verſ. 27.] Peraduenture the worke of the cutting of the annointed Gouernour was doing the former halfe weeke; the firſt 3. years and a halfe. And indeed he that readeth Ioſephus ſhal find it fell out ſo: for about the 9th. yeare of Nero, (which was 7. yeares before the deſtruction of the City) Albinus the Romane Gouernour there, by his monſtrous pilling, polling and other cruelty, did as Ioſephus ſaith, ſowe the ſeede of the Cities ouerthrow: And in the twelfth of Nero, within leſſe than foure yeare after that, Agrippa the laſt Gouernour that the Iewes had, from among themſelues was driuen out of the Citie; whereupon Ioſephus ſaith, The Citie was without a Ruler to guide it.
                  
                  And ſo, you haue the Meſſiah cut off, and the Gouernment of the Citie quite extinct in the very inſtant of 3. yeare and a halfe, if it were neceſſary to flye to that.
                  But there is no ſuch neceſſity: The Hebrew word ſignifieth part of a time as well as halfe. Wherefore the ſence may well bee, in part, that is, during the reſidue, the remainder of that ſeauentieth weeke, after the annointed Gouernour cut off, (how long or ſhorttime ſoeuer the ſame be in doing,) he will performe the things mentioned in the ſecond part of the former verſe: which for the greater certainty, are heere reitterated [in the laſt part of verſe 27.] not altogether in the ſame words: but ſo as the one of theſe two verſes bringeth light vnto the other: for,
                  1. Inſtead of deſtroying Citie and Sanctvary, verſ. 26. hee

ſaith heere in the 27. verſe, He ſhall make to ceaſe ſacrifice and oblation, as needs they muſt when the Citie and Temple are deſtroyed. In right they ceaſed vpon the death of Chriſt; but now they ſhall ceaſe infact.
                  2. Inſtead of a forraigne enemie doing the ſame by warre, verſe 26. hee putteth in this verſe, the wing or Legions of the Romane Army, laying deſolate; for wing was a proper terme of the Romane warfare. Whoſe Armies are called abhominable, becauſe they were Infidels, and worſhipped Idols.
                  And this to bee the ſence of the place; beſide the Angels thus ſuting of theſe things, you may ſee by comparing the three Euangeliſts that ſpeake of this Hiſtory: for where Math. 24. 25. &amp; Mark. 13. 14. Chriſt ſaith, When ye ſee the abhomimation of deſolation ſpoken of by Daniel the Prophet, ſtanding in the holy place where it ſhould not: Luke interpreteth it thus, When ye ſhall ſee Ieruſalem compaſſed about of Armies, then know the deſolation thereof is at hand. Luke 21. 20. And ſo theſe words are but the ſame in ſence and ſubſtance that was in the former verſe, which ſaid, all this ſhould be done by warre.
                  3. Inſteed of inundation or ouerflowing of calamities, verſ. 26. heere you haue a powring forth of all Gods Iudgements at once, as if the windowes of Heauen ſhould be opened as they were at the floud.
                  4. Where the 26. verſe doth ſpeake of deſolation to the end of the warre, thoſe words expound theſe of the twenty ſeauenth, vnto vtter deſtruction.
                  
                  5. Preciſeneſſe of deſolation, in the 26. verſe, is ſomewhat more clearely vttered in the 27. vnto vtter deſtruction preciſely determined.
                  
                  So one of theſe noteth the greatneſſe; the other the certainty of the deſolation.
                  The Rabbinicall Doctors ſeeke for a knot in a ruſh, when they enquire vpon this place how long this deſolation ſhall continue, and when the preciſe determinate time ſhall haue an end: for the period of all that Daniel heere

ſpeaketh of, is the end of the ſeauentieth ſeauen. Howbeit in other Scriptures, Dan. 12. 11. 12. Math. 23. 38. 39. Luk. 21. 24. Rom. 11. 25. 26. that preciſe determinate time of the Iewes deſolation is preciſely propheſied and foretold: but euery place hath his proper interpretation.
                  To cloſe vp this Treatiſe becauſe it may bee of great vſe for the cleering of this and many other hard and obſcure paſſages; I will heere ſet downe the iuſt periods of time from the beginning of the World to the diſſolution of all things, as they are to be gathered in holy Scripture.
                  Firſt, from the Creation to the Floud, are yeares, 1656. manifeſt by the yeares of the fathers before the Floud. Gen. 5. &amp; 11.
                  Secondly, from the Floud vnto the Promiſe made to Abraham, 426. for from the Floud to Terah, are 221. Terah begat Abraham at 130. At 70. he begat children: Gen. 11. 26. But that was Nahor his firſt borne, though Abraham for honour ſake be named firſt. Abraham he begat at 130. as appeareth in that Terah dyed at 205. Gen. 11. 32. when Abraham was 75. Gen. 12. 4.
                  The promiſe made to Abraham was at 75. for then and not before he left his owne Country Charran (which was his Country as well as Vr, or the Valley of the Chaldeans, and both in Meſopotamia) for Canaan Gen. 12. 4. And Exod. 1
                        •
                     . 4. it is ſaid, the pregrination of the children of Iſrael in Aegipt, meaning both there and in the Land of Canaan, where they were alike ſtrangers) was 430. yeares, So as the promiſe and the entrance into the Land begin together. Alſo if Terah had not beene dead before the promiſe, he (which none will ſay) ſhould haue receiued the promiſe of Chriſt to come of his ſeede as well as Abraham: for doubtleſſe, Abraham, as a Prophet of God would not haue concealed it from him.
                  Of neceſſity therefore two callings of Abraham are to be diſtinguiſhed: one in Ur of the Chaldeans, which being paſſed ouer, Gen. 11. is layd downe, Gen. 15. 7. and Stephen ſpeaketh of it, Act. 7. 2. 3. The ſecond after his fathers death,

                     Gen. 12. 1. Which place is to be tranſlated not Iehouah had ſaid, but Iehouah did ſay, as a new commandement to goe on his iourney with an addition of the promiſe. And this Stephen mentioneth. Act 7. 4.
                  Thirdly, frō the promiſe to the giuing of the Law, 430. Gal. 3. 17. Which are the 430. yeares of peregrination, Exod. 12. 40. In 400. whereof Abrahams ſeed was afflicted, Gen. 15. 13. They ſhall intreat thy ſeede euill, 400. yeares. This affliction beginneth at Iſmaels perſecution of Iſaac, Gen. 21. 9. Gal. 4. 29. and continueth to their deliuerance out of the houſe of bondage, the ſetuitude of Aegipt. The perſecution of Iſaac was not at his birth, it muſt be when he was of ſome vnderſtanding, and the computation of time draweth it to about the ſixt yeare of his age; which was iuſt 30. yeares from the promiſe. Thus are thoſe three texts Gal. 3. 17. Exod. 12. 4. and Gen. 15. 13. cleered. Of theſe 430. yeares, 215. were ſpent in the Land of Canaan; for from the 75. yeare of Abraham to Iſacks birth, are 25. Iſaac was 60. when Iacob was borne, Gen. 25. Iacob went downe into Aegypt at 130. Gen. 47. 9. So onely 215. are left for Aegypt.
                  
                  Fourthly, from the Law, or comming out of Aegypt, to the building of the Temple. 480.
                  1. Kings 6. 1. Their ſumme ariſeth thus.
                  In the Deſert, 40. Deut. 1. 3. Ioſua 17.
                  The Conqueſt and partition of the Land, take vp 7. of it: As it is proued by Calebs age, Ioſh. 14. 7. 10. for the Land was diuided the 45. yeare after Moſes ſent him from Kadeſh Barnea to view the Land; out of which deduct 38. yeares that the Children of Iſrael remained in the wilderneſſe after Gods ſentence vpon Calebs returne, and their remaine 7. 480. yeares from the Paſſeouer to the Temple, &amp; he ruled the other 10. in all 17. As appeareth in that of thoſe, all but 17. are in the time of other Rulers, and that remaine can be caſt vpon none but him. Iudg. 339. That is to ſay, Othniel. 40. Ehud and Shamgar 80. Debora. 40. Gedeon. 4. Abimelech. 3. Tolah. 23. Iair. 22. Ieptha. 6. Ibtſan.
                     
7. Elon. 16. Abdon. 8. Sampſon. 20. Elie 40.
                  
                     Acts 13. 19. it is ſaid, God gaue them Iudges as it were 450. yeares, vnto Samuel the Prophet he ſaith, as it were, or in a manner, for in proper Chronicle and common ſupputation, it was 339. But Iudges that within the compaſſe of that time did tyrannize and oppreſſe them, tooke vp 111. yeares; namely, Cuſhan 8. Moab 18. Siſera 20. Midian 7. Ammon 8. Philiſtines 40. Saul 40. Act. 13. 21. where Paul ſaith, Afterwards they deſired a King, and God gaue vnto them Saul the ſonne of Cis, a man of the Tribe of Beniamin, 40 yeares. As if he ſhould ſay, all this from the Iudges was 40. yeares: So comprehending the wholetime from the death of Elie, as wel the interim till Samuel medled with the gouernment, which was not in 20. yeares after 
                        〈…〉
                      1. Sam. 7. 3. as the whole time of his gouernment and of Sauls raigne, being 20 yeares more.
                  
                     Dauid 40. Salomon 4. 1. Kings 6. 1.
                  Fiftly, the Temple ſtood before it was burnt by Nebuchadnetzar. 408.
                  To be gathered thus.
                  To Salomons death 36. for he raigned 40. in all.
                  The Kings of Iudah after him raigned 372. as the yeares are truely collected by Tremellius in the Argument of the firſt and ſecond Booke of Kings. The 390. yeares that Ezechiel bare the iniquitie of the houſe of Iſrael, Ezech. 4. whereof 40. (part of thoſe 390. verſ. 9.) were for the houſe of Iudah, doth no way croſſe this account of the Kings that ſucceeded Salomon; for neither doe thoſe 390. yeares begin when Ieroboam drew Iſrael away: but from about the 28. yeare of Salomons raigne, at what time waxing old, hee was led to the worſhip of falſe Gods: 1. King. 11. and all Iſrael ranne headlong into Idolatrie; neither doe they end with the deſtruction of the Temple and the Citie, but in the laſt and finall carrying away of the poore remain, by Nebuzaradan as appeareth, Ezech. 5. 4. which was ſome fiue yeare after. And the 40. yeare, of Iudah, are from the eighteenth yeare of Ioſia, when the couenant was renewed;

2. King. 23. 23. from which the people immediately fell away.
                  Sixtly, from the burning of the Temple to the Edict of Cyrus to build it anew.
                  And ſo adding the firſt 18. yeares of Nebuchadnetzar, you haue the 70. yeares Captiuity.
                  Seauenthly, from that Edict to the deſtruction of the Temple by the Romanes. 490.
                  Which are Daniels ſeauens, Dan. 9. whereof the firſt 49. yeares are for the full finiſhing of the temple and all the furniture thereof.
                  Eighthly, from a ſecond and the finall deſolation thereof, being endeuoured to be re edifyed by Iulian the Apoſtata in deſpight of the Chriſtian name, about Anno. 360. after Chriſt, till ſuch time as the Iewes acknowledging Chriſt the Lord, ſhall ſet vp a glorious Church at Ieruſalem againe, not of wood or ſtone, nor for any Legall worſhip; but for the ſpirituall ſeruice of God in Chriſt, are yeares. 1233. Dan. 12. 11. 12.
                  Ninthly, from thence to the full comming in of the Gentiles, the certaine time is not foretold, vnles (which I dare not ſay) any thing may be gathered from, Reuel. 20. 4.
                  But the tenth and laſt period is, that after the fulneſſe of the Gentiles once come in, the generation then liuing ſhall not paſſe away, till all things haue an end. Math. 24. 34.
                  
               
               
                  
                  The Prophecie of Hoſhea.
                  
                  
                     
                        Chapters. 1. 2.
                     
                        CHAP. 1.
                        1. The Word of Iehouah that came vnto Hoſhea the ſonne of Beery in the dayes of Vzziah, Iotham, Achaz, Hezechiah, Kings of Iuda: and in the dayes of Ieroboam the ſonne of Ioaſh, King of Iſrael.
                        
                        1. THe Title or Inſcription ſetteth forth the Author of the Prophecie, God: the Preacher or publiſher thereof, Hoſhea: the time that he executed his Propheticall function, 43. yeares at the leaſt: for ſo many there are from the very laſt yeare of Ieroboam the ſonne of Ioaſh, to the firſt yeare of Hezechias, to bee reckoned in this ſort. The laſt yeare of Ieroboam was the 39. of Uzzia or Azaria; Uzzia or Azaria raigned 13. yeares more (52. in all) Iotham (after him) 25. Achaz (Hezechiahs father) 14.
                        The knowledge of the time helpeth much, and bringeth a great light to the vnderſtanding of the Prophecie, becauſe of the many accidents that fell within that compaſſe in the Kingdome of Iſrael to the Kings thereof, of whom he maketh often mention, and liued himſelfe to ſee moſt of the things that heere he prophecieth, and ſo was able the better to make vſe of it vnto the people; vnder that one of Ieroboam the ſonne of Ioaſh (when our Prophet firſt began)

all the Kings of Iſrael are comprehended in this place, as many as raigned from him to Hezechiah.
                        
                        The authority of this Prophet cannot be called in queſtion: He is cited by our Sauiour Chriſt, Math. 9 13. &amp; 12. 7. by the Euangeliſt writing by Gods Spirit; Math. 2. 15. and laſtly, by the Apoſtle Paul, 1. Cor. 15. 55. &amp; Rom. 25. 26. where he voucheth him by name.
                        2. The beginning of that which Iehouah ſpake by Hoſhea: And Iehouah ſaid vnto Hoſhea; Goe take vnto thee a 
                           Hebr. A Wife of whoredomes, and children of whoredomes.
                            
                           Wife, an Harlot, and children begot in fornication; for the Land hath greatly gone a whoring 
                           From after Iehouah., departing from Iehouah.
                        
                        3. So he went and tooke Gomer, a 
                           Daughter. 
                           woman of Diblaim: who conceiued and bare him a ſonne.
                        
                        4. Then ſaid Iehouah vnto him, call his name Izreel: for yet a little while and I will viſite the 
                           Bloods. 
                           ſlaughters of Izreel vpon the houſe of Iehu, and will make the Kingdome to ceaſe in the houſe of Iſrael.
                        
                        5. And it ſhall be in that day: that I will breake the bow of Iſrael, becauſe of the valley of Izreel.
                        
                        2. The ſumme of the Prophecie, is a fearefull denouncing of Gods iudgements againſt the people for their ſinnes, &amp; a ſweet publiſhing of mercies to a ſmall remnant, the little handfull of Gods Elect, it is all typicall or declaratiue of the Type.
                        The typicall part, which hath alſo an application going with it) in the three firſt Chapters, vnder two types; whereof the firſt (in the firſt and ſecond Chapter) is of a Wife, an Harlot, and Children begot in fornication; whom the Prophet is willed to take, not as though hee ſhould take the mother and them together (which could not bee, they being borne after) but becauſe from a wicked and vncleane mother, hee was to haue baſe and miſbegotten Iſſue.
                        Whether the Prophet in truth tooke ſuch a wife, which God commanding, cannot be diſhoneſt; or as rather muſt

be thought by way of ſimilitude only and comparing himſelfe with a man marrying in that ſort, to taxe the peoples infidelity and falling away from God by ſpirituall adultery with their falſe Gods and Idols.
                        This Wife, an Harlot figureth the Kingdome of the Iſraelites that went a whoring from God, their lawfull Huſband, to whom they were eſpouſed.
                        3. Shee is called Gomer, that is to ſay, entierty or perfection; for that the whole body of Iſrael was vouchſafed the honour of this ſpirituall marriage.
                        Shee is ſaid to be a woman of Diblaim, or out of Diblah, that waſt and huge wilderneſſe which you reade of, Ezech. 6. 24. to ſhew that, not their merit, but Gods free and gracious goodneſſe aduanced them to that eſtate and dignitie.
                        The three Children begot in fornication, figure the iudgements which by ſo many degrees were to light vpon this people, euery one heauier than the other.
                        4. The firſt Child is a ſon, whoſe name was Izreel, by the name of the ten Tribes Mother-Citie: figuring the ruine of Iehues houſe, and of the Kings of Iſrael in his line, which is ſet forth.
                        Firſt, by the circumſtance of time, that it ſhould come quickly to paſſe: for Zachariah, Ieroboams ſonne, raigned but 6. moneths; then Shallum the ſonne of Iabeſh conſpired againſt him, ſlue him, and raigned in his ſtead.
                        Secondly, by the effects, that from that time forward God will weaken the force of the whole State and Kingdome, by home diſſentions and forraigne warres.
                        Thirdly, by the cauſe of this iudgement, becauſe ſaith he, of the valley of Izreel, that is, the ſlaughters and maſſacres which Iehu made there; which, albeit God had commanded and was well pleaſed with, yet for that hee did it not with an vpright heart, God iuſtly puniſhed it in his poſteritie.
                        6. Afterwards ſhe conceiued againe and bare a Daughter,
                           
                           and Iehouah ſaid vnto him, call her name Loruhamab: for I 
                           I wil not adde any more to 
                           will no more haue mercy vpon the houſe of Iſrael, that I ſhould any way forgiue them.
                        
                        7. But on the houſe of Iuda I will haue mercy, and will ſaue them by Iehouah their God: and will not ſaue them by bowe, nor by ſword, nor by battaile, by horſes, nor by horſemen.
                        
                        6. The ſecond Child is a Daughter, named Loruhamab, that is not obtaining mercy, it figureth the vtter deſolation of the tenne Tribes, begun by Tiglah Pileſer, King of Aſhur, when he carried away captiue the Reubenites, Gadites, &amp; halfe tribe of Manaſſe. 1. Chron. 5. 26. and perfited by Salmanaſer, who vtterly ouerthrew the reſidue of the Kingdome of Iſrael, 1. King. 17.
                        This age is compared to a Daughter, becauſe from that time forward, after the bow of Iſrael, that is, all their power and ſtrength ſo broken, they ſhould bee no more able to defend themſelues, than if they were a common-wealth of women. Their miſery in this behalfe you haue aggrauated two wayes.
                        Firſt, that it ſhall be without hope of reſtitution. God will not haue mercy on them to pardon their ſinnes and graciouſly to reſtore them after they are once carried Captiues.
                        7. Secondly, by Gods contrary dealing with the houſe of Iuda, whom the Aramites, and they confederating together did moſt maliciouſly ſeeke to ruine.
                        Theſe he ſaith he, will ſaue for his mercies ſake, &amp; ſheweth how and by whom; by Ieſus Chriſt true God and true man, the ground and foundation of the Couenant, and of all Gods promiſes, whom in the fulneſſe of time God would ſend among them: not by their owne forces, nor by any forraine helpes. The meaning is, the Tribe of Iuda, notwithſtanding their captiuity in Babylon, from the which he will ſet them free, ſhall continue a Tribe ſtill, and certaine ſome principality, and forme of Gouernment till Shiloh
                           
(which is his ſonne) doe come and that the Gentiles beleeue in him.
                        8. Now when ſhe had weined Loruhamah: Shee conceiued and bare a ſoune.
                        
                        9. Then ſaid Iehouah, call his name Loammi: for yee are not my people neither will I be yours.
                        
                        10. Yet the number of the Children of Iſraell ſhall be as the ſand of the ſea which cannot be meaſured, nor tould: and inſtead of that it was ſaid vnto them, yee are not my people, it ſhall bee ſaid vnto them, yee are the ſonnes of the liuing God Almighty.
                        
                        11. When the Children of Iuda and the Children of Iſrael, gathering themſelues together and ſetting ouer them one head, ſhall come vp out of the Land: for great ſhall the day of Izreel bee.
                        
                        8. The third Childe which ſhe bare after the weaning of the former, that is to ſay, after that the patience of God had long expected for their conuerſion, and found no amendment, but a deſperate going on in ſinne, is a ſonne.
                        9. Loammi, not my people, figuring the finall reiection and caſting off of the whole Nation of the Iewes for refuſing 2. Poſit. Reiection.
                            the Lord of life, (whom the Father ſent to ſaue them) that they ſhould bee no longer his Church and people.
                        10. But the ſharpneſſe of this ſentence, the Prophet, by way of correction of his ſpeech doth qualifie and remper with moſt heauenly comforts, the ſweete promiſes of the Ghoſpell: for,
                        Firſt, howſoeuer the whole Nation of the Iewes is thus to bee abandoned, yet at the laſt a Church ſhall bee gathered 5. Poſit. Call.
                            of them through grace, and that no ſmall multitude, but a number numberleſſe; when looking with ſorrow and true repentance vpō him whom they haue thruſt through: they ſhall be made not his people only, but the ſonnes of the liuing God.
                        
                           
Secondly, the Gentiles ſhall together with them embrace the Goſpell; for ſo is this place expounded: Rom. 9. 44 Poſit. All nations embracing Chriſt.
                            24. 25. and 1. Pet. 2. 10. yet of neceſſity the calling of the Gentiles heere pointed at, muſt be entended that which is after the Iewes conuerſion; but that ſerueth well to warrant the firſt inceptions of their calling: to which purpoſe the Apoſtles doe there apply it.
                        Thirdly, the tenne Tribes as well as Iudah ſhall bee vouchſafed this honour, to bee called to the participation 8. Poſit. Ten Tribes.
                            of Chriſt.
                        Fourthly, the vnion of them into one body and one Religion; 29. Poſit. One Kingdome.
                            for they ſhall all ſubmit to one head Chriſt, and make but one Kingdome.
                        Fiftly, their returne vnto Ieruſalem againe comming out 23 Poſit. Dwell in their Countrey.
                            of the Countries whether they were diſperſed: there to re-edifie and ſet vp his ſpirituall worſhip and ſeruice.
                        Sixtly, the greatneſſe of this worke: for great, ſaith hee, ſhall the day of Izreel bee; great, in regard of their great diſtreſſe, the ſoreſt time of affliction that euer was; great, in regard of their great deliuery, farre to be preferred before their deliuerance out of Aegypt; great, in regard of the great deſtruction of their great enemie that ſhall fall before them. Laſtly, (which it ſeemeth the Prophet heere doth ſpecially reſpect) great in regard of the great and 38 Poſit. Multitude of of belieuers.
                            maruellous encreaſe of the Church, the plentifull ſeede which God will ſow in the ſame (as Eſay did alſo prophecie, Eſay 49. 50. 51. &amp;c. multiplying them with men as it were with flocks of ſheepe, Ezech. 36. 38. Ier. 31. 37. which is the number numberleſſe, whereof he ſpake in the former verſe.
                        
                        Seauenthly, heerevpon a new name is giuen to this people to be called Izreel, or the ſeede of Gods owne ſowing: And ſo by a Paranomaſia or alluſion of ſpeech, hee doth elegantly open another, and a more ſweet etymologie of that name which before ſerued for the threatning of Iudgement, heere it is vſed to note the promiſes of grace from God, as it is Chapter. 2. 16. which place doth anſwer vnto this, and openeth the meaning of it.
                        
                           
The receiued opinion is, that the ſecond Child Loruhamah figureth the captiuity of the Reubenites, Gadites, and half tribe of Manaſſeh, &amp; the third child Loammi, the captiuity of the reſt of the ten Tribes: But that cānot ſtand: for,
                        Firſt, in the ſecond Childe hee expreſſly nameth the whole houſe of Iſrael, verſ. 6.
                        Secondly, he oppoſeth them to the houſe of Iuda, verſ. 7. not to the reſidue of thoſe tribes of Iſrael.
                        Thirdly, the iudgement threatned in the third Childe, is after Iehouah Chriſt his comming into the world, by whom Iuda ſhould bee ſaued; whilſt the other remained Captiues, verſ. 7. Therefore the captiuity of the ten tribes muſt go before the third Childe borne.
                        Fourthly, the reiection (ſpoken of in the third Childe) doth properly and aptly concerne the Iewes that were at Chriſts comming, not thoſe led away by Salmanazar.
                        
                        Fiftly, the promiſe of reſtoring Iuda no leſſe than Iſrael ſheweth that they had their part in the former threatnings.
                        Sixtly, the mother of theſe Children is called Gomer, that is to ſay, entiertie or perfection, verſ. 3. The very name teaching vs that the type extendeth as well to the tribe of Iuda as to the other tribes. And therefore they muſt needs bee meant by the third Childe, and Conſequently all Iſrael by the ſecond: vpon this one thing well obſerued dependeth (in a manner) the true vnderſtanding of the whole Propheſie; for hereby is euident that the three firſt Chapters, and conſequently the laſt foure, which in effect are but an explanation of the promiſes in the former, are to be referred to the Kingdome of Chriſt to be ſet vp among the Iewes in the laſt dayes which we expect, &amp; is yet to come.
                     
                     
                        CHAP. 2.
                        1. Say vnto your brethren, O my people, and to your ſiſters, O thou that haſt obtained mercy.
                        
                        2. Plead with your Mother, plead, how ſhe is not my wife, neihther am I her husband: That ſhe put away her fornications out of her ſight, and her adulteries from betweene her breaſts.
                        
                        
                           
3. Leſt I ſtrippe her naked, and ſet her as the day ſhee was borne; and diſpoſing her as in a wilderneſſe, and ſetting her as in a drie land, doe make her dye for thirſt.
                        
                        4. And ſhew no mercy to her Children, for they bee children 
                           Of Whoredomes. 
                           be got infornication.
                        
                        Hitherto of the Type: The Application ſtandeth of three parts; euery one expreſſing more clearely than other, the Peoples Apoſtaſie, and falling away from God: the miſerable condition which this Apoſtaſie ſhould bring vppon them, and the gracious promiſe of reſtoring them againe. All which things were ſo handled in the three laſt verſes of the former Chapter.
                        Firſt, therefore is an exhortation to true repentance; for feare of Gods iudgements, vttered by an Apoſtrophe, or turning of the ſpeech to the poore remnant of Gods elect, 3. Poſit. Remnant.
                            whereby is giuen to vnderſtand, that there ſhall ſtill remaine a holy ſeede in the middeſt of this dereliction, whom the Prophet heere inuiteth to a moſt religious and holy duty.
                        That by wholſome admonitions they would ſtay and hold vp their declined Synagogue from vtter falling away, O you my people of either ſort, not of the tribe of Iuda only, but euen of the other tribes; for to them alſo the promiſe doth belong, Ier. 37. &amp;c. Ezech. 37. 16. &amp;c. and elſewhere) as many of you as ſhall obtaine grace to eſcape out of the ſlauery of ſinne and Sathan, into the glorious libertie of the ſonnes of God, ſtirre vp one another by holy exhortation.
                        2. And all of you together ſtay and hold vp the declined Synagogue and Church of Iſrael; By reprouing her for her ſinnes, thoſe ſpirituall whoredomes that haue broken the marriage bond betweene God and her.
                        3. And by threatning betimes, before her fall and finall deſolation come, the Iudgements of God, both vpon her ſelfe, by an vtter depriuing her of all his guifts and graces, (which in the Scriptures are compared with waters, and

the lacke of them with the drie and barren deſert.)
                        And vpon her Children the particular members of that Synagogue, who loue and liue in the adulteries of their mother.
                        With ſome hope neuertheleſſe of grace and of forgiueneſſe, if ſhee returne and ſeeke the Lord, as by the word leaſt is ſecretly giuen to vnderſtand.
                        5. For their mother hath plaid the harlot, ſhee that conceiued them hath dealt ſhamefully: for ſhee ſaid, I will goe after my Louers, that giue me my bread and my waters, my wool and my flaxe, my oyle and my drinkings.
                        
                        6. Therefore, behold, I will hedge thy way with thornes, and 
                           Wall, a wall. 
                           reare a wall that ſhe ſhall not finde her pathes.
                        
                        7. And though ſhee follow after he Louers, yet ſhall ſhee not come at them, though ſhe ſeeke them, yet ſhall ſhee not finde them: that at the length ſhee ſhall ſay, I will goe and returne, to that my former huſband, for then was it better with mee, then now.
                        
                        8. For ſhe knoweth not that I gaue vnto her, the corne and the new wine and the oyle: alſo that I multiplied vnto her ſiluer and gold wherewith they made Baal.
                        
                        9. Therefore will I returne and take away my corne in the time thereof: and will deliuer my wooll and my flaxe, 
                           To haue couered. 
                           which ſhould haue couered her nakedneſſe.
                        
                        10. That I may vncouer her leudneſſe in the ſight of her louers: and no man ſhall deliuer her out of my hand.
                        
                        11. And I will cauſe all her mirth to ceaſe, her feſtiuall, her new moone, her Sabboth: and all her ſolemnitie.
                        
                        12. And I will lay waſte her vines and her figtrees: whereof ſhe hath ſaid: Theſe are my rewards that my Louers haue giuen me: and I will make them a foreſt, and the beaſts of the field ſhall eate them.
                        
                        13. So will I viſite vpon her the dayes of Baalim, wherein ſhe burnt incenſe to them, and decking her ſelfewith her earing and her iewel, went after her Louers: but forgat mee, the ſpeech of Iehouah.
                        
                        
                           
5. In the ſecond part, you haue a declaration of their ſin &amp; of the miſeries inflicted for the ſame, which are the reaſon why God ſo calleth vpō his people, to vſe this exhortation.
                        The ſinne is expreſſed to be her going a whoring impudently and ſhameleſly after ſtrange Gods and People, contrarie to the dutie of a Wife. Not onely ſo, but a wicked ſetling of her ſelfe to the like ſinnes heereafter, all mixed with extreame ingratitude; in that ſhee aſcribed vnto theſe ſtrange ones the thankes of all ſhee did poſſeſſe.
                        6. Then come the miſeries inflicted for the ſame, wherein Gods purpoſe was to keepe her by croſſes and afflictions (as vnruly beaſts by walles and fenſes are kept within their paſtures) from being able to fulfill her deſire of committing fornication with them.
                        7. Though neuer ſo much ſhe hunt and follow after it, that by this meanes breaking her obſtinate and froward heart, ſhe may come vnto repentance, and betake her ſelfe to God her lawfull huſband, whom to her loſſe ſhe had forſaken.
                        8. And the better to imprint theſe things in their mind he repeateth both the ſinne, their idolatry and blinde ingratitude, that not only would not know the hand from whence ſo many and ſo great bleſſings came, but to the diſhonour of God beſtowed them vpon Idols.
                        And the miſerable condition which this ſhould bring vpon them: for, 4. Poſit. Deſolation.
                           
                        
                        9. Stripping them of all the comforts and commodiof this life, and freeing his creatures out of the poſſeſſion of thoſe vniuſtowners, who ſo wretchedly abuſed them to a wrong and contrary end then God hath giuen them: for,
                        10. Hee will expoſe them to publike ſhame and infamie.
                        11. Secondly all outward forme of Gods worſhip, (the ſolace, and ioy of their life ſhall be taken from them.
                        12. Thirdly, the Countrey they tooke ſuch pleaſure in, not looking vp to God that gaue it, their fruitfull and pleaſant

Gardens, Orchards, and Vineyards, ſhall be turned into a wildernes.
                        All which things we ſee haue fallen more heaully vpon this people, than euer they did vpon any nation.
                        13. Idolatrie (wherevnto he reſorteth to ſhew how iuſt the ſentence is,) the cauſe of all this, which ſhee ſo diated on, thinking no paine too much, all coſt too little, to compaſſe her deſires, and followed it ſo hard making a trade of it, that tranſported with blinde loue, ſhee forgat her lawband.
                        By this of Idols, which hee mentioneth according to the ſtate of thoſe times, is meant, the worſhip of falſe Gods whatſoeuer, as all worſhip is that looketh not to God in Chriſt.
                        14. Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the Wilderneſſe, and will ſpeake to her heart.
                        
                        15. And I will giue her her Uineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor, for the doore of hope: that ſhee ſhall ſing there as in the dayes of her youth, that is, as in the day when ſhe came out of the Land of Aegypt.
                        
                        14. The third part of the Chapter hath a promiſe of the Iewes reſtoring, vttered Allegorically by an elegant alluſion to the whole manner and courſe that it pleaſed God to vſe for the bringing of that people into the Land of Canaan when they came out of Aegypt.
                        Firſt, the power of his ſpirit mouing her as hee ſent Moſes, and Aaron to inuite them whilſt they were ſlaues in Egypt.
                        Secondly, the ſore diſtreſſe ſhe ſhall be in, vpon making 16. Poſit. Sore diſtreſſe.
                            head to repaire to her owne home, As the Iſraelites were when God led them into the wilderneſſe, and there made them to wander ſo vp and downe, ſee Ezech. 20 35. 36.
                        Thirdly, the promiſes of God vpholding her the whilſt, as his word and the Symbole of his preſence ſtrengthend the Iſraelites in their toyleſome iourneyes.
                        
                           
15. Fourthly, the bringing of her into her owne country againe, freed and deliuered out of that deſert, thoſe troubles 23. Poſit. Dwell in their Country.
                            and calamities which he ſpake of the ſoreſt time of affliction, (as Daniel propheſieth, Dan. 12. 1.) that euer was ſince there was a nation vnto that day: This the Prophet ſetteth before their eyes, by pointing at the ports and gates whereby this people, hauing wandered firſt a long time in the wilderneſſe, were brought from the deſert beyond Iordan vnto the hither ſide: for the firſt doore and entrance as it were into the Land of promiſe which they ſo hoped and wiſhed for, after they were once paſſed Iordan, was the valley of Achor, famous for the ſtory of Achan ſtoned there.
                        Fiftly, faith, hope, and ſpirituall bleſſings, a pledge and earneſt pennie of the promiſed inheritance: as the firſt 36. Poſit. Spirituall graces.
                            footing ouer Iordan and the fruitfulneſſe of thoſe ſoyles, lifted vp their hearts with a certaine expectation of a thorow poſſeſſing of the whole countrey.
                        Sixtly, the ioy of the Church reſtored to her ancient ſeates, as both men and women, Miriam and the maidens ſong when they came out of Aegypt.
                        And ſo hee lifteth vp their hearts to the waiting for of another, and a more famous deliuerance, when as in the yeare of Iubile, they ſhall not onely returne to their poſſeſſions againe, but haue the ſame accompanied in their natiue ſoyle with ſpirtuall freedome from ſinne and Sathan, and with ſuch noble graces, and firſt fruits of the ſpirit.
                        16. And it ſhall bee in that day the ſpeech of Iehouah, that thou ſhalt call mee my Huſband, and ſhalt call mee no more 
                           40. Poſit. Ioy.
                            
                           my Baal.
                        
                        17. For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth: yea, they ſhall be no more remembred by their name.
                        
                        18. And in that day will I make a couenant for them with the beaſts of the field, and with the foule of the heauen, and with that which creepeth vpon the earth, and breaking the bow and
                           
                           the ſword, and the battell out of the Land, I will make them to lye downe in ſafety.
                        
                        19. And I will eſpouſe thee vnto me for euer: I will, I ſay, eſpouſe thee vnto me in righteouſneſſe, and in iudgement, in kindneſſe and in mercy.
                        
                        20. And will eſpouſe thee into mee in faith, that thou maiſt know Iehouah.
                        
                        21. It ſhall bee alſo in that day, that I will heare the ſpeech of Iehouah, I will heare the heauens, and they ſhall heare the earth.
                        
                        22. And the earth ſhall heare the Corne, and the new wine, and the oyle; and they ſhall heare Izreel.
                        
                        23. For I will ſow her for me in the Land, and I will haue mercy vpon Loruhamah: and will ſay vnto Loammi, thou art my people, and he ſhall ſay, my God.
                        
                        16. In the fourth part of the Chapter are Euangelicall promiſes made vnto the Iewes being reſtored and brought home.
                        Firſt, her receiuing of Chriſt: acknowledging him 5. Poſit. Call.
                            for her iuſt and lawfull Husband, and calling him by that name.
                        17. Secondly, Reformation of the Church from all 34. Poſit. Puritie.
                            corruption in Gods ſeruice, noted by that one of rooting our Idolatry.
                        18. Thirdly, the Churches ſafety through God ſpeciall 41. Poſit. Safety of the Church.
                            care and protection, making the verie beaſts of the field and all things, to be at peace with them.
                        19. Fourthly, hee will communicate vnto them all good both the fountaine of good, and the ſtreames flowing from it.
                        The fountaine is the betrothing vnto Chriſt, that is, their ſpirituall coniunction with him, which the Apoſtle calleth a taking of them to. Rom. 11. 15. enlarged.
                        Firſt, by the conſtancie and eternitie of it. 43. Poſit. Perpetuity.
                           
                        
                        Secondly, by the fundamentall cauſe, the righteouſneſſe and mercy of God, to whom in my iudgement theſe words

are to be referred: As Rom. 3. 24, 25, 26. 1. Pet. 1. 1. 1. Ioh. 1. 9. But if you liſt to vnderſtand them otherwiſe then is this ſpirituall coniunction with Chriſt heere ſecondly enlarged by the guifts and graces going there withall, and which hee will beſtow vpon them, which are of two ſorts.
                        Firſt, righteouſneſſe and iudgement, then kindneſſe and mercy; one noting the ſincerity and integritie of their wayes: the other, their prompt and cheerfull performance of all brotherly duties. But the former ſence agreeth better.
                        20. Thirdly, by the inſtrument or means of apprehending all this, and making it their owne; euen faith which is the 26. Poſit. Spirituall graces.
                            true and ſauing knowledge of God.
                        21. The ſtreames flowing from this fountaine of our coniunction with God, are all manner of bleſſings.
                        Firſt, temporall, in the fruitfulneſſe of their Land: all the creatures in heauen and in earth conſpiring as it were 17. Poſit. Fruitfulneſſe of the Land.
                            together, and in their kinde deſiring it at his hands.
                        22. God will furniſh aboundantly for the Churches good the remnant of that Izreel, whereof hee ſpake before Chapter 1. 2. which are her Children of the ſeed of Iaacob, begotten through faith in Chriſt.
                        22. Secondly, Gods couenant with the whole Church, the naturall mother of the true Iſrael &amp; with her children, whō 
                           35. Poſit. Couenant.
                            before hee ſaid, hee would haue no pitty of; nor they ſhould be none of his: But now hee promiſeth to except thoſe remnant, the true griffes, and Plants wherewith he wil ſow his Church.
                        And ſo haue you admirably ſet forth the beauty of the holy Citie, new Ieruſalem, comming down from God out of Heauen, furniſhed as a Bride trimmed for her husband, Reu. Chapt. 21. 23. that is of the Church of the Iewes when they ſhall embrace Chriſt.
                     
                     
                        
                        CHAP. 3.
                        1. Afterwards Iehouah ſaid vnto mee, yet goe, loue a woman beloued of a friend, and playing the adultreſſe: Such as is Iehouahs loue toward the Children of Iſrael, and they looke to other Gods, and loue flaggons of 
                           Grapes. 
                           wine.
                        
                        2. So I bought her me for fifteene ſhekels of ſiluer; and for an homer and a halfe of Barley.
                        
                        3. And I ſaid vnto her, many dayes ſhalt thou abide for mee, play not the harlot, nor bee another mans: likewiſe will I for thee.
                        
                        4. For many dayes ſhall the children of Iſrael abide without a King, and without a Prince, and without ſacrifice, and without a statue, and without an Ephod, and without Images.
                        
                        5. Afterwards ſhall the children of Iſrael returne, and ſeeke Iehouah their God, and Dauid their King: and 
                           Shall feare to Iehouah. 
                           fearefully ſhall come to Iehouah and his goodneſſe in the laſt dayes.
                        
                        1. The ſecond Type not much vnlike former, together with the declaration of the Type, are both in this Chapter.
                        For the Type hee taketh a woman eſpouſed, and to bee married, but long put off for her adulteries.
                        As God hath loued and betrothed the Iſraelites, but for their idolatries a great while neglected them, whom yet in the end hee will be pleaſed to ioyne to himſelfe in ſpirituall marriage.
                        It riſeth in theſe degrees.
                        Firſt, God in bidding the Prophet to loue a woman that had plaid the Adultreſſe, intimateth his loue and purpoſe to call them home, euen when they went a whoring after ſtrange Gods, forſaking the true worſhip &amp; ſeruice of God in Chriſt.
                        That is meant after the manner of thoſe times, by looking to other Gods and louing bottles of wine: for in thoſe Sacrifices to Idols, the manner was to drinke wine aboundantly.
                        
                           
Secondly, the Prophet bought her, which I interprete to bee the ſetting apart of a remnant, whom hee 3. Poſit. Remnant.
                            would afterwards call with a holy calling and marry vnto himſelfe.
                        3. The price he paid 15. pieces of ſiluer, and an homer and a halfe of Barley: vnder that the Law requireth for a bond ſlaue, Exod. 21. 32. (and ſlaues onely were ſaleable) noteth her vilde and baſe condition at the time, worſe then any ſlaue, whether you conſider her ſpirituall thraldome, or miſerable diſperſion among the nations: for of all people in the world they are now the baſeſt &amp; moſt contemptible.
                        3. Fourthly, the long continuance of this their ſlauery; hauing beene in that eſtate almoſt 1600. yeares ſince the deſtruction of their Temple and Citie by Ueſpaſian.
                        
                        Fiftly, the vtter deſolation which ſhall bee among them all that while: by alluſion to the law, Deut. 21. 13. 4. Poſit. Deſolation.
                           
                        
                        Sixtly, Gods promiſe to call them home by faith and true repentance at the laſt, in that hee is pleaſed to ſtay for 5. Poſit. Call. 
                                    〈…〉
                                 
                              
                            them till the time that they alſo ſhall be ioyned in ſpirituall wedlocke.
                        4. Thus farre of the Type: The ſignification of the Type expreſſeth cleerely.
                        Firſt, their long deſolation and miſerable ſtate of things 4. Poſit. Deſolation.
                            all that while, in that they ſhall haue no forme nor face of Church or Common wealth, no, not of a corrupt, or depraued Church.
                        5. Secondly, the promiſe of their conuerſion, that in 5. Poſit. Call.
                            the laſt dayes or laſt yeare as Ezechiel hath it, Ezech. 38 8. they ſhall embrace Chriſt their King (who is called heere Iehouah and Dauid) kiſſe the Sonne, and with feare and trembling ſubmit themſelues vnto his Kingdome, for all the while they reiected him, they were without God in the world. Ephe. 2. 12.
                     
                     
                        
                        CHAP. 4.
                        1. Heare the word of Iehouah, yee children of Iſrael: for Iehouah hath a controuerſie with the Inhabitants of the Land, becauſe there is no faithfulneſſe, nor kindneſſe, nor knowledge of God in the Land.
                        
                        2. By ſwearing, and lying, and killing, and ſtealing, and whoring: they doe breake out, that 
                           From vnder their God. 
                           Blouds touch bloods. 
                           murders touch one another.
                        
                        3. Therefore the Land ſhall mourne and euery one that dwelleth therein ſhall become feeble, 
                           With the beaſts, and with foule. 
                           both the beaſts of the field, and the foule of the heauen: yea alſo, the fiſhes of the Sea ſhall bee taken away.
                        
                        4. Yet let not a man contend, neither let a man rebuke: for thy people are as they that contend with the Prieſt.
                        
                        5. Therefore ſhalt thou fall in the day, and the Prophet ſhall alſo fall with thee in the night, and I will cut off thy Mother.
                        
                        6. My people ſhall be cut off for lack of knowledge: becauſe thou haſt reiected knowledge, I will alſo reiect thee from being a Prieſt to me: and ſeeing thou haſt forgotten the Law of thy God, I will alſo forget thy children.
                        
                        7. As they were encreaſed, ſo they ſinned againſt mee: I will changs their glory into ſhame.
                        
                        8. They eate vp the ſinne of my people: Therefore vpon their iniquitie doe they ſet their heart.
                        
                        9. Wherefore there ſhall bee like people, like Prieſts: when I ſhall viſite his wayes vpon him, and render vnto him his doings.
                        
                        10. For though they eate, yet ſhall they not haue enough, though they commit fornication, yet ſhall they not breake forth in multitude: for they haue left of to obſerue Iehouah.
                        
                        11. Whoredome, and wine, and new wine take away the heart.
                        
                        12. My people aske counſell at their ſtock, that their ſtaffe may tell them: for the ſpirit of fornication cauſeth them to erre; that they goe a whoring, 
                           From vnder their God. 
                           turning from their God.
                        
                        13. They ſacrifice vpon the toppes of the mountaines, and burne incenſe vpon the hilles vnder the Oake, and Poplar,
                           
                           and Elme, becauſe the ſhadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters play the harlots, and your ſpouſes commit adulterie.
                        
                        14. Should I not viſite your daughters becauſe they play the harlots, and your ſpouſes becauſe they commit adultery? Becauſe theſe with harlots doe ſeparate things which they may ſacrifice with whores: yes verily, the people that doth not vnderſtand ſhall bee ruined.
                        
                        1. Hitherto of the typicall part of this Propheſie. That which is declaratiue of the Type ſtandeth vpon two parts, as the Type it ſelfe doth.
                        Firſt, the ſinnes of the people and Gods iudgements vppon them for the ſame.
                        Secondly, the promiſe of grace, peace and reconciliation to a little remnant.
                        The former of the two hee comprehendeth in three Sermons.
                        Whereof the firſt (in this fourth Chapter) hath a notable reproofe of the Iſraelites ſinnes, three in number: vnfaithfulneſſe, inhumanitie, ignorance of God, and an enterlaced threatning of Iudgements for the ſame.
                        Both firſt propounded, and afterwards amplified and enlarged.
                        2. Their vnfaithfulneſſe and perfidious treachery: breaking all the duties of the ſecond Table, in moſt outragious manner like a current or a ſtreame that cannot bee kept within any bounds: inſomuch that euen bloudſhed, and murder were growne ſo common, that dead carcaſes lay by heapes one vpon another.
                        3. But the puniſhment ſhould bee, a wofull calamitie and generall plague vpon the whole Land, &amp; all the commodities of it.
                        4. Their barbarous inhumanity, noted to bee ſo great that they can abide no reprehenſion, ſo as it were but loſt labour to goe about to admoniſh them: They are ſo fierce, that there is no dealing with them, but they doe all manner of wickedneſſe, obſtinately and with an high hand; and

therefore are in as great fault as thoſe that hearken not to the Prieſt.
                        5. But ſince they will not be ſet to rights, they ſhall ſtumble and fall, and that preſently, both people and Prophet, one with another, yea their Kingdome and mother Citie.
                        6. The ignorance as well of the people as of the Prieſts, maketh that both Prieſts and people ſhall be reiected.
                        The Prieſts, from their Prieſtly function, which they haue ſo abuſed, for their lippes ought to haue preſerued knowledge, the people from being any more his.
                        7. An vnworthy thing that the Prieſts, eſpecially ſhould ſo much forget themſelues and ſinne ſo hainouſly againſt the Lord, by whom they were ſo much aduanced: But thoſe that honour God, hee will honour, and ſuch as deſpiſe him, ſhall be ſet light by.
                        8. They (which is horrible to imagine) becauſe their liuelihood groweth by the ſacrifices of the People, are ſo farre from finding fault with the peoples ſinnes, that contrariwiſe all their heart and minde is to haue them ſinne, and as much as in them lyeth they bring in a licenſe and impunity of ſinning, to ſerue their owne bellies and ambitions, becauſe by the peoples ſacrifices for ſinne, they haue wherewith to maintaine their gormandizing and filthy pleaſures.
                        9. But both Prieſt and People ſhall ſmart for it and reape according as they haue ſowne.
                        11. To gormandizors and voluptuous liuers, ſhall come famine and the plague, wherewith themſelues ſhall be conſumed, as at the ſiege of Samaria, ſo farre ſhall they be from being full or multiplying.
                        11. Howſoeuer, their whordome and gurmondizing ſo take away their heart that they heede not Gods threatnings, nor his iudgmēts, though the ſame lie neuer ſo much vpon them, and that they are in the very middeſt of them.
                        12. Thoſe that commit ſpirituall fornication and forſaking God, runne a whoring after Idols, in euery place

where they can meete with them: God will pay it into their boſomes by home adulteries and fornications.
                        14. To the ruine of them and their families, iuſtly and righteouſly; when as they are carried ſo headlong to adulrie, that they ſtick not to make choyce at home of the beſt and ſweeteſt morſels, which vnder colour of religion, they deuoure openly with their ſtrumpets.
                        15. Though thou Iſrael play the harlot, yet let not Iudah offend: And goe not yee to Gilgal, nor goe vp to Bethauen, neither ſweare Iehouah liueth.
                        
                        16. For as an vnruly heifer Iſrael is vnruly: now will Iehouah feede them as a Lambe in a large place.
                        
                        17. Ephraim is conſociate to 
                           Bugges. 
                           Idols, let him alone.
                        
                        18. Their bibbing of wine is vnruly: they 
                           In going a whoring they goe a whoring. 
                           continually goe a whoring, they loue giue yee, her 
                           Shidde. 
                           protectors are ignominie it ſelfe.
                        
                        19. The winde ſhall binde her vp in her wings: and they ſhall bee aſhamed becauſe of their ſacrifices.
                        
                        15. From theſe premiſes groweth a concluſion, which may goe for a ſecond part of the Chapter, by way of Caueat to the tribe of Iuda, not to communicate with the Iſraelites in their ſinnes, not ſo much as to enter into their borders, (as Gilgal was their border towne) for Idolatry ſake, nor to runne a whoring after the Idoll of Bethel, which in ſcorne hee calleth Bethauen the houſe and manſion of iniquity, much leſſe to blaſpheme God, and to take his ſacred name in vaine, ſwearing and binding themſelues thereby into idolatry.
                        16. Of which Caueat there be two reaſons rendred; the obſtinate rebellion of the Iſraelites, and Gods ſeuere iudgements ready to ſeize vpon them; for euen as they are like vntamed heyfers, ſo will God giue them ouer as a ſheepe left at large in the open paſtures for euery one to pray vppon.
                        17. Wherfore their obſtinacy in ſinning is firſt ſet forth,

in regard whereof, hee wiſheth Iuda to haue nothing to do with them: being Idolaters, rebellious, (for ſo their bibbing 18. of wine doth make them) fornicators, bribers, to conclude, ſhamefull offendors: yea the Princes themſelues, who for their place and dignity ought to excel in vertue, and to be the glory and protection of Gods people, are of all other the moſt infamous.
                        19. Then hee ſetteth forth the iudgement, that the winde as in her wings will binde them vp and reſerue them into puniſhment.
                     
                  
                  
                     CHAP. 5. 6. 7.
                     1. Heare this, O yee Prieſts, and attend, O yee houſe of Iſrael and yee the Kings houſe giue eare, for to you pertaineth this iudgement: because yee haue beene a ſnare in Mizpah, and a net ſpred voon Tabor.
                     
                     2. They that turning aſide to make ſlaughter 
                        Deepen. 
                        goe into deepe places: Iam a correction to them all.
                     
                     
                        CHAP. 5.
                        1. The ſecond Sermon is in the 5. 6. and 7. Chapters, wherein being to declare grieuous crimes in both the kingdomes of Iſrael and Iuda, and the puniſhments of God vpon them, he beginneth with an exordium to procure audience and attention to that which hee is to ſay, fetching arguments: firſt from their perſon, who all; to wit, the Prieſts, both the hedge Prieſts of Ieroboam, and the holy Prieſts of Leu
                                 •
                              , the houſe of Iſrael, and the houſe of Iuda, which holding faſt to Dauid (the King ſet vp of God) are called the Kings houſe, doe well deſerue this ſentence, being as guilty of capitall crimes, as thieues and robbers by the high way ſide.
                        2. Next, from the perſon of God to whom it belongeth by his word and by his roddes, to chaſtiſe theſe robbers, that are like to thoſe that lurking in the caues and holes of the earth to murder poore ſoules.
                        
                           
3. I know Ephraim and Iſrael is not hid from mee: that now O Ephraim, thou playeſt the harlet, that Iſrael is defiled.
                        
                        4. They 
                           Geut. 
                           frame not their doings to turne vnto their God; for the ſpirit of fornications is in the middeſt of them, and Iehovah they know not.
                        
                        5. Yea, the pride of Iſrael doth teſtifie to his face: therefore ſhall Iſrael and Ephraim tumble downe in their iniquitie, Iudah alſo ſhall tumble with them.
                        
                        6 Let them goe with their flocke, and with their heard to ſeeke Iehouah, but they ſhall not finde him; he withdraweth himſelfe from them.
                        
                        7. Againſt Iehouah they haue dealt treacherouſlie; for they haue brought forth ſtrange children: now ſhall the moneth eate them vp, their parts.
                        
                        8. Blow ye the Cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: ſhout at Bethaven, let Beuiamin behinde thee ſhout.
                        
                        9. Ephraim ſhall be deſolate in the day of rebuke: when among the Tribes of Iſraell I ſhall make knowne the ſame to bee certaine.
                        
                        10. The Princes of Iudah were like them that remooue the bound: vpon them will I powre out as waters, mine indignation.
                        
                        3. After the Exordium, in the ſecond place hee layeth downe their crimes; in body and ſoule ruſhing into all impietie.
                        4. Hauing no deſire of reformation, nor to bring forth the fruits of true repentance.
                        5. And therewithall the puniſhment for their pride and arrogancie, being ſo great that it may ſerue for a thouſand witneſſes to conuince their wickedneſſe: they ſhall therefore fall and be cut off, both ſorts of them, the ten Tribes, and Iuda.
                        6. So certainly, that they ſhall not be able with any externall ſeruice to appeaſe the wrath of God, nor to eſcape his hand and iudgement.
                        7. And euen as they make no bones to breake their faith to God by ſpirituall fornication, mingling, as it were,

their ſeede with ſtrange Gods and forreine people: ſo it ſhall it come to them which happeneth to women worne with adulteries, as Ezechiel ſpeaketh that their monethly diſeaſes, procured by inordinate luſt eate vp and conſume their bodies.
                        8. Theſe Iudgements are garniſhed by a hypotipoſis, or a liuely pourtraiture and repreſentation thereof before their eyes: as if God did ſummon all the parts of the Land to prepare themſelues for an vnhappy war. Gibeah the bounder of Iuda, Rama the bounder of Iſrael; Bethauen, in the Deſert confining vpon both, but longing to Bethel and vnto Iſrael to conclude the Tribe of Iuda, ſcituate behind Beniamin.
                        
                        9. For both Ephraim the flower of Iſrael, and all the Iſraelites, howſoeuer now they ſcorne my words and hold them for fables, ſhall one day feele the truth of them, being laid waſt and deſolate.
                        10. And vpon the Princes of Iuda, that peruert Church and common wealth, and breake the bounds of all lawes diuine and humane, will I power forth my indignation in moſt plenteous and aboundant manner.
                        11. Ephraim is oppreſſed and cruſhed in iudgement: becauſe he will, he goeth after the commandement.
                        
                        12. Therefore was I as a moth vnto Ephraim: and as rottenneſſe to the houſe of Iuda.
                        
                        13. But when Ephraim ſaw his diſeaſe and Iudah his ſore, then went Ephraim vnto Aſhur, and Iuda ſent to a King that would protect: but hee ſhall not bee able to heale you, neither ſhall hee cure you of the ſore.
                        
                        14. For I will be as a fierce Lyon to Ephraim, and as a young Lyon to the houſe of Iudah: I, I will teare and goe away, I will take vp and none ſhall reſcue.
                        
                        15. I will goe returne to my place, till they acknowledge the offence, and ſeeke my face: 
                           In affliction vnto them. 
                           when affliction is vpon them, they will ſeeke me early, ſaying.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                        CHAP. 6.
                        1. Come and let vs returne to Iehouah, for he hath torne and hee will heale vs; hee hath ſmitten, and hee will binde vs vp.
                        
                        2. Hee will reſtore vs to life within two dayes: the third day hee will raiſe vs vp, and wee ſhall liue in his ſight.
                        
                        3. And wee 
                           Shall know, follow after. 
                           ſhall know and proceed in the knowledge of Iehouah, as the morning whoſe going forth is ſteddy: and he ſhall come as the raine vnto vs, as the latter and ſeaſonable raine vnto the earth.
                        
                        4. What ſhould I doe to thee, O Ephraim? What ſhould I doe to thee, O Iudah; ſince your goodneſſe is as a morning cloud, and as the dew 
                           Morning at a man may ſay. 
                           dropping early, goeth away.
                        
                        5. Therefore hewed I by the Prophets, I ſlue them by the words of my mouth; and thy iudgements were as the light that breaketh forth.
                        
                        6. That I am delighted with kindnes and not with ſacrifice; and with the knowledge of God more than with burnt offerings.
                        
                        7. But they tranſgreſſed the couenant, as if it had beene a mans: there dealt they treacherouſly againſt me.
                        
                        8. In Gilead they were euery one, a City of workers of iniquity: 
                           Footſtepped (if I may ſo ſay) with blood. 
                           with bloody footſteps.
                        
                        9. And like to troopes waiting for a man, are the ſociety of Prieſts: they murder after the manner as it was at Sechem; for they worke abhomination.
                        
                        10. In the houſe of Iſrael doe I ſee a horrible matter: There by the whoredome of Ephaim, Iſrael is defiled.
                        
                        11. Yea, O Iudah, that Ephraim did put an harneſt in thee: whilſt I brought backe the captiue multitude of my people.
                        
                     
                     
                        CHAP. 7.
                        1. Whilſt I heale Iſrael, then is the iniquity of Ephraim diſcouered, and the 
                           Wickedneſſes. 
                           exceeding wickedneſſe of Samaria; for they worke falſhood: and the thiefe commeth in, the troope ruſheth forth.
                        
                        2. Neither doe they ſay 
                           To. 
                           in their heart, that I remember all their wickedneſſe: now their doings compaſſe them about, they
                           
                           are before my face.
                        
                        3. With their wickedneſſe they make glad the King; and with their lies the Princes.
                        
                        4. All of them are adulterers, as an ouen heated by the baker; who leaueth off watchings after hee hath kneaded the dough vntill it be leauened.
                        
                        5. In the day of our King, the Princes haue made him ſicke, with heat caught of wine: hee hath ſtretched out his hand with ſcorners.
                        
                        6. For they haue applied their heart to lying in waite, as an Ouen: which, whileſt their baker ſleepeth all night long, in the morning burneth as 
                           A fire of a flame. 
                           a flaming fire.
                        
                        7. They all waxe hot as the Ouen, and eat vp their Iudges: all their Kings fall, there is none among them that calleth vnto me.
                        
                        11. In the third place followeth a Narration of the offences of both theſe people, fiue in number, with iudgements ſuteable thereunto.
                        Firſt, will-worſhip and Idolatry; in preferring the ordinances of men before Gods inſtitution: That albeit his Iudgements lay heauy vpon them, and cruſhed them to pieces, yet they were not therewith diſmayed, but with a full ſwing, and with their whole heart went after the traſh of mens inuentions only, becauſe it liked them better, then follow Gods Commandements.
                        12. Secondly, when God by chaſtiſements went about to reclaime them, waſting them as a moth doth a veſture, and as rottennes doth the bones.
                        13. They, though ſeeing and knowing it full well, betooke them not to God. But the Iſraelites and Menachen their King, they become tributaries vnto Asſhur: Achaz the King of Iuda, hee flies vnto the ſame, as vnto a Bulwarke, though he ſhall not be able to doe them good.
                        14. Thirdly, neither Gods corrections nor his Word mouing them to repentance, can preuaile to make them from their heart to ſeeke vnto him. Wherefore firſt hee

ſpeaketh of correction, wherein God as a gracious and louing father, thought that partly by carying a hard hand vpon them, renting and tearing them in peeces.
                        15. Partly by withdrawing his gracious preſence from them, keeping Court as it were, at another place, they would confeſſe themſelues guilty, and at the leaſt in their affliction earneſtly ſeeke his face.
                     
                     
                        CHAP. 6.
                        1. Secondly, he preſcribeth a forme of their conuerſion, what he would haue them to doe, and how to ſtirre vp one another.
                        Firſt, in acknowledging, by repentance, Gods iuſt and righteous hand before vpon them.
                        Secondly, in apprehending through faith, the power of the ſame hand for their healing and repaire.
                        2. Grounding vpon his kinde and gracious nature, eaſieto be intreated, and full of mercie and compaſſion to poore repentant ſinners: He will heale, hee will quicken, he will raiſe vp, we ſhall liue for euer before him.
                        3. And grow in faith and knowledge, as the light of the morning that groweth more and more vnto the ſteddy day, Prou. 4. 18.
                        To conclude, hee will aboundantly beſtow vpon vs all ſpirituall bleſſings.
                        4. But neyther of theſe, his word nor chaſtiſements, or whatſoeuer God might doe elſe, could faſten vpon his people a ſound and conſtant courſe of godlineſſe. If any good motions roſe within them, they quickly vaniſhed and came to nothing.
                        5. The fourth ſinne is, that albeit God ſeeing their inconſtancie and fickleneſſe in ſeruing him, cauſed his Prophets, their teachers and inſtructers, not onely to ſlay and terrifie them with the horror of his deadly iudgements, that ſo they might be kept from euill, which is the firſt vſe of the Miniſter, but to hold forth the light and lanterne

of the word, that they might know what they ought to doe, and be brought to vnderſtand and performe their duties, which is the ſecond vſe of the Miniſtery.
                        6. A thing more pleaſing vnto God, than all ſacrifices and oblations.
                        7. Yet they brake the bonds of couenant betwene God and them, as if they had had to do but with a mortall man, yea (which mightilie encreaſeth the quality of their fault) where God ſo ſlew them, and ſhined vnto them by his Prophets, euen there, in that place, they made no conſcience of tranſgreſſing againſt God, and falling to iniquity.
                        8. The whole land, euen all the parts of it; for in Gilead (the Country beyond Iordan) there was euery Citie full of malefactors, bloudy men, and murderers. A man might trace them in their wickedneſſe, through the very ſtreets, for their footſteppes were in bloud.
                        9. The Colledge of Prieſts was a ſocietie and fraternity of robbers that ſtand by the high way ſide, they kill &amp; ſlay after the manner as it was at Shechem, impudently, ſhameleſſly and audaciouſly, in barbarous and ſauage manner; a foule abhomination.
                        10. The people of Iſrael haue horribly tranſgreſſed, and committed ſpirituall fornication.
                        11. Yea Iuda alſo hath wrapped himſelfe in the ſame offences, and receiued from themthe ſeede of Idolatrie; when euen them, ſaith God, (which aggrauateth the offence) when I graciouſly brought backe my people from captiuity oppreſſed of Iſrael, and of Aram.
                        
                     
                     
                        CHAP. 7.
                        1. Their fift offence is a greedineſſe in ſinning prouoking one another to all kinde of wickedneſſe: Set forth.
                        1. By a peeuiſh diſpoſition of theirs, when God meant moſt to doe them good. Euen as it fareth with a ſicke patient, who the more carefull the Phiſition is to preſcribe dyet for recouerie of his health, the more earneſtly is hee carried to all kinde of ſurfetting and diſorder, though it be the endangering of his life.
                        
                           
Secondly, by a diſtribution of their offences, for they abound both in flye and in open ſinnes, lying, theiuery, robbery.
                        2. Thirdly, they are ſo farre from being abaſhed to thinke that God ſeeth and remembreth all their iniquity, as contrarily they bragge and boaſt of the multitude of their ſinnes, euen as a man would doe of a guard of men that doe attend him.
                        3. Fourthly, all degrees, the King himſelfe and his nobles, and as the people of the Land adulterate themſelues.
                        4. Fiftly, all theſe runne as greedily after ſinne, (that ſin eſpecially the ſinne of adultery) as fire burneth in a hot ouen, when the Baker after hee hath kneaded his dough, ouertaken with ſleepe; forgetteth to make it cleaue.
                        5. Sixtly, by the circumſtance of time, euen that very day, when at the Kings Coronation, God is to bee ſerued and the Prince and people to bee put in minde of their dutie, then they doe moſt of all runne ryot. The Princes, who by their grauity and wiſedome ſhould bee the ſtayes, and proppes of the common wealth, haue their hand deepeſt in this offence; not only themſelues bibbers and toſſepots, but forcing one another to drink, till they fall into a ſurfet.
                        The pinte and quart, moderate and reaſonable meaſures will not ſerue their turne: but they muſt haue whole flaggons full of wine and drinke as wee ſay by the dozen. The King himſelfe quaffes as well as they and ioyneth hands with beaſtly drunkards: ſo impudent in their wickedneſſe, that they ſcorne both God and man.
                        6. Well did I therefore, ſaith the Prophet, reſemble them to an ouen; for they are as hot as any furnace, and furious vnto euill.
                        The King indeed, as the Baker doth the ouen, ought to make cleane the common wealth, and by his power and authority to coole the heate and fury of the Princes.
                        But hee ſitteth ſtill and letteth all alone: that like the ouen which burneth all night long vnto the morning.
                        
                           
7. They ſet a fire with wine, conſpire all of them againſt their King, his miniſters and ſeruants, whereby they change their kings apace: for by their conſpiracies many periſh in a ſhort time; wickedly if you reſpect the conſpirators: but iuſtly and righteouſly, if you looke vnto the Kings themſelues; for they are all wicked Kings: there is none of them that calleth vpon God.
                        8. Ephraim, he mingleth himſelfe among the people: Ephraim is as Cake not turned.
                        
                        9. Strangers deuoure his ſtrength, and he knoweth not: yea, hoarineſſe is ſprinkled vpon him and he knoweth not.
                        
                        10. And though the Pride of Iſrael teſtifie to his face: yet they doe not returne to Iehouah their God, nor ſeeke him for all that.
                        
                        11. But Ephraim is like a ſilly doue, without heart: to Aegypt they call, to Aſhur they goe.
                        
                        8. The fourth and laſt part of this Prophecie hath a ſummarie repetition of the peoples ſinnes and of Gods iudgements in that regard.
                        Their ſinnes, firſt, conſociating with ſtrangers and making a mixture of their religion with the ſuperſtitions of the Gentiles. They neither hold them to the ſincerity of Gods ſeruice, not to the meere toyes and fooleries of the heathen; but frame to themſelues a mingle mangle out of both. And therefore may well be compared to a Cake halfe toſted, neither hot nor cold, being as wee vſe to ſpeake neither fiſh nor fleſh.
                        9. Secondly, an incredible blockiſhneſſe, without common ſence.
                        That albeit the euils they endure of their confederates and allies, bring gray heares vpon them, and make them old before their time, yet they not onely not conſider it:
                        10. But (which is their third offence) they are ſo proud and inſolent, that for all this they turne away, and will not bee brought to God, but had rather ioyne themſelues to

forreigne nations, then to ſeeke after him.
                        The fourth and laſt offence is their madde and fooliſh conſorting with ſtrangers. So ſilly they are and without vnderſtanding to pray in ayde of thoſe whoſe minde is onely to ſpoyle and eate them vp.
                        12. When they ſhall goe, I will ſpreade my net vpon them, and bring them downe as the foule of the heauen: I will chaſtiſe them, 
                           According to the hearing of their congregation. 
                           as their congregation hath heard.
                        
                        13. Wo vnto them, for they haue flitted from mee, deſolation vnto them, for they haue tranſgreſſed againſt me: when I am to redeeme them, then they ſpeake vnto me with lyes.
                        
                        14. And doe not crye vnto me with their hearts, when they houle vppon their beds: when for corne and new wine they aſſemble and turne aſide vnto me.
                        
                        15. But when I binde vp and ſtrengthen their arme; then doe they imagine miſchiefe againſt me.
                        
                        16. They returne not to the moſt high, they are like a deceitfull bow, their Princes fall by the ſword, comming from the rage of their tongue: this is their deriſion in the land of Aegypt.
                        
                        12. The puniſhment is, that as the fouler taketh the Doue, ſo God will enſnare and catch theſe fooliſh ones, and lay vpon them the ſcourges and corrections threatned by his Prophets.
                        13. All becauſe of their ſinnes, eſpecially their hypocriſie, which hypocriſie of theirs is ſet forth by a diſſimilitude, when they haue need of mee that I am to doe them good, and helpe them out of trouble, in their difficulties and diſtreſſes, then they call vpon me: but all is nothing elſe, but meere diſſimulation.
                        14. For they doe it not from their hearts; what face ſoeuer they ſet vpon it, whether it bee priuately in the night or openly in the day, yet in thoſe times of their need, in famine and want, they make a pretence, as if they would come towards me.
                        15. But when I, as a kinde Phiſition, hold vp their

arme, and bring them caſe and comfort, they goe on in their wickedneſſe.
                        16. Turne they doe, but not vnto God, it is falſly and deceitfully: But they haue their reward according.
                        The ſword that ſerueth to work their conſpiracies, doth ſlay and kill the Princes. And this ſword is whet on and ſharpened by virulent tongues, ſetting debate betweene them.
                        Theſe murders ſo rife, and their common and dayly plotting of ſtirres and troubles in the ſtate, make them a ſcorne euen to their friends and allies.
                     
                  
                  
                     CHAP. 8. 9. 10.
                     1. Set the Trumpet to the roofe of thy mouth, and ſay, hee hee ſhall come as an Eagle againſt the houſe of Iehouah: becauſe they tranſgreſſe my couenant, and treſpaſſe againſt my Law.
                     
                     2. The Iſraelites crye vnto me: my God, we know thee.
                     
                     3. Becauſe Iſrael hath caſt of the thing that is good: the enemie ſhall purſue him.
                     
                     
                        CHAP. 8.
                        The third Sermon touching the Peoples ſinnes, and Gods iudgements for the ſame, in the 8. 9. and 10. Chapters, hath 5. parts.
                        The firſt part is a propoſition of iudgements againſt the people of Iſrael, and the cauſe of thoſe iudgements. The iudgements are firſt ſet forth by a military Hypotipoſis, or liuely repreſentation of the enemies comming againſt them, as if it were now a doing: then they are amplified by circumſtances on the part of the enemy, and on the peoples part, of the enemie, that hee ſhall come ſwiftly and powerfully: on the peoples part; for that they are thoſe which were before, through grace of Gods houſhold: the cauſes are three.
                        Firſt, Their reuolt and falling away from the Couenant between God and them, and from the Law wherein that Couenant is written.
                        
                           
2. Secondly, Hypocriſie, calling vpon God, and making profeſſion of his name, not in truth, but with a counterfait pietie.
                        3. Thirdly, the renouncing of all good.
                        4. They haue ſet vp a King, but not by me: they haue made made Princes which I know not: of their ſiluer and their gold haue they made them 
                           Eugges. 
                           Idols, that Iſrael may be cut off.
                        
                        5. Thy Calfe O Samaria ſhall caſt them off, when mine anger is kindled againſt them: how long will they not abide innocencie.
                        
                        6. For he alſo is from Iſrael, the workman made it, and it is no God; for the Calfe of Samaria ſhall be broken in pieces.
                        
                        7. Seeing they haue ſowne the winde, they ſhall reape the whirle-winde: it hath no ſtalke, the bud ſhall yeeld no meale, if perhaps it doe yeeld, ſtrangers ſhall ſwoop it vp.
                        
                        8. Iſrael ſhall be ſwooped vp, now ſhall they be among the Nations as a veſſell wherein is no pleaſure.
                        
                        9. Becauſe theſe goe vp to the Aſſirian, a wilde Aſſe onely for himſelfe: the Ephraimites hire louers.
                        
                        10. Yea, becauſe they haue hired among the nations, now will I gather them together: (for they haue begun a little) becauſe of the burden of the King of Princes.
                        
                        11. Becauſe Ephraim hath multiplied Altars to ſinne: Altars are vnto him to ſinne.
                        
                        12. The things I preſcribe vnto him 
                           In the excellencies. 
                           in the excellent documents of my Law, are counted as a ſtrange thing.
                        
                        13. The ſacrifices of mine offerings, thoſe that ſacrifice fleſh and eat, Iehouah accepteth not: now will he remember their iniquitie, and viſit their ſinnes, that they returne to Egypt.
                        
                        14. To conclude, Iſraell hath forgotten his maker, and hath built Temples, and Iudah multiplied fenced Cities: Therefore I will ſend downe a fire vpon the Cities of him, after it hath deuoured the Pallaces of the other.
                        
                        4. The ſecond part, is an Enarration or larger declaring of thoſe iudgements. Firſt, againſt their reuolt being of

two kinds, one from the temporall kingdome of Dauid, figuring the kingdome of Chriſt; wherein what Kings ſoeuer they ſet vp, whether you conſider Ieroboam, or any of his ſucceſſors, it was not from God, he knew them not nor approued them, becauſe it was not according to the promiſe made to Dauid, but by the peoples rebellion, or their owne vſurpation. The other is from the ſpirituall worſhip, and ſeruice of God: and both theſe reuolts, the latter eſpecially, ſhall be vnto their ruine.
                        5. For to ſpeake of the latter, firſt, O Samaria that art the Kings chamber and Metropolitan citie, thy Calfe ſhall doe thee no good: Nay, it ſhall hurt thee exceedinglie, and prouoke my wrath againſt thee. Thou that canſt neuer away to keepe touch with God in the duties of ſpirituall wedlocke.
                        6. The reaſon thereof is rendred in deteſtation of Idolatrie.
                        Firſt, from the cauſe, the nature and orginall of theſe Idoll gods; men inuented them: ſo did Iſraell this as well as that other Calfe in the wildernes, which brought ſo many heauy plagues vpon Gods people.
                        The makers, are Smiths, Carpenters, and Artificers, a token it was not God.
                        The matter, is ſome courſe and baſe mettall.
                        Secondly, from the lamentable and fearefull deſtruction, not onely of the Idolls themſelues, which ſhall turne into droſſe and rubbiſh, but of the Idolaters their worſhippers.
                        7. Set forth by three ſimilitudes; as they haue ſowne, ſo ſhall they reape, and a great deale worſe too.
                        8. Secondly, they ſhall be ſwallowed vp, their ſubſtance eaten out and conſumed.
                        Thirdly, they ſhall be as a veſſell that none taketh pleaſure in, deſpiſed of euery one.
                        9. And touching the other kinde of reuolt, which wee ſet in the firſt place, the forſaking of the houſe of Dauid, and relying vpon forraine aide vpon the Aſſirian, that is,

whollie for himſelfe, and hath no minde of helping others, ſeeking it with bribes and rewards.
                        10. Well may they bribe and hire, but this will be the end: The Iſraelites themſelues ſhall fall by heapes, the nations whom they ſhall hire, ſhall come ſo tumbling in vpon them, as Eſay told Achaz, Eſay 8. Doe you not ſee it is prettily well begun already. Looke vpon the late example, that is yet now freſh and bleeding before your eyes: ſo you will the better beleeue my threatning in that which is to come, I meane the ſacking and carrying away of the Tribes beyond Iordan by Pull and Tiglath Pileſer. If you aske me the reaſon, why God ſhould be ſo angry with you, it is becauſe you are ſo fooliſh, or ſo wicked rather, to ſend preſents and tributes to the King of Aſſhur, (who in the pride and vanity of his heart, nameth himſelfe the King of Princes, the mighty and moſt potent King) with the pilling, polling, and burdening of your ſubiects.
                        11. Secondly, he declareth the iudgements againſt hypocriſie. Their hypocriſie ſuch and ſo great, by multiplying al
                              •
                           a
                              •
                           s to ſin againſt God, vainely and ſinfully through their hypocriſie, abuſing his name.
                        12. That the excellent things which God preſcribed in his Law, thoſe outward ceremonies of that ſanctiue and holineſſe, hee maketh no more account of, then if they were ſtrange things, that he neuer heard of before.
                        13. The oblations and ſacrifices hee taketh no pleaſure in them.
                        But their puniſhment ſhall be, hee will remember their iniquitie and puniſh it in his time vpon thoſe falſe perſons that are faithfull, neither to God, nor to the King of Aſſhur, but goe their wales to Egypt after couenant made with the Aſſirians.
                        14. Thirdly, he declareth the puniſhment againſt their renouncing of all good. That it ſhall be as a fire to conſume the cities of Iuda, and the pallaces of Iſraell. For Iuda was grieuouſlie vexed by Senacherib, and Iſraell before that waſted and carried away captiue.
                     
                     
                        
                        CHAP. 9.
                        1. Be not glad, O Iſrael vnto reioycing as other people that thou goeſt a whoring from thy God: loueſt a harlots reward in all the corne floores.
                        
                        2. The floore and the wine-preſſe ſhall not feede them: and the new wine ſhall lye vnto her.
                        
                        3. They ſhall not dwell in the Land of Iehouah: but Ephraim ſhall returne to Aegypt, and in Aſſyria eate that which is vncl

                        4. They ſhall not effer wine to Iehouah, neither ſhall thoſe offerings be ſweete vnto him their Sacrifices ſhould be vnto them as the 
                           Bread. 
                           meate of mourners, all that eat thereof ſhould pollute themſelues: for their meate, for their 
                           
                              Their ſoule, as Leuit. 21. 1. 
                           dead, commeth not into the houſe of Iehouah.
                        
                        5. What would ye doe in the day of ſolemnitie: and in the day of the feaſt of Iehouah?
                        
                        6. For lo, they ſhall periſh by deſtruction, Aegypt ſhall gather vp, Memphis ſhall bury them: the 
                           Tents of deſire. 
                           pleaſant tents, for: heir ſiluer, the nettle ſhall inherite, the thorne ſhall bee in their Tents.
                        
                     
                     
                        CHAP. 9
                        1. The third part of the Propheſie is a conteſtation againſt the Iſraelites ouer confident reioycing and pleaſing of themſelues in their preſent good eſtate, which maketh them of the true worſhip and ſeruice of God: for,
                        Firſt, theſe men who deſpiſe the Law of God and the iuſt obſeruations thereof ſhall contrary to the Law eare in the Countries whether they ſhall bee carried captiues, things impure and vncleane, no way acceptable vnto God, neither conſecrated by offering the firſt fruits thereof as holy vnto him, nor any other way.
                        4. Againe, their ſacrifices and oblations ſhall ceaſe, it ſhall not bee permitted to them to offer drinke offerings to the Lord: And it were as good they did not: for their Sacrifices could not bee pleaſing to him; becauſe, if they did ſacrifice, it could not bee done according to the Law,

which requireth mirth and cheerefulneſſe before the Lord when men ſacrifice: whereas theſe in their captiuity haue no cauſe but of mourning and heauineſſe: for as the Law of God ſhutteth out meate offered for their dead ones, from comming into the Temple by the ſame analogye and proportion, the ſacrifice of thoſe than mourne are vngratefull ad not accepted of God.
                        5. Laſtly, how can they celebrate the ſolemnities and feaſts of the Lord, which are to be done with cheerefulnes, and gladnes?
                        6. The third iudgement hee foretelleth, is death and horrible deſolation, death euen in thoſe Countries, whither they did flye for refuge. The deſolation ſuch as their pleaſant tents and dwelling places, made to hide their treaſures in, ſhall be ouergrowne with nettles and thornes.
                        7. Come are the dayes of viſitation, come are the dayes of recompence, let Iſrael know: the Prophet is a foole, the man of winde is madd, for the multitude of thine iniquity, the great priuie hatred.

                           corrupt deeply as in the dayes of Gibeah; he will remember their iniquity, he will viſite their ſinnes.
                        
                        10. As grapes in the Wilderneſſe found I Iſrael, as the firſt ripe fruite in the figtree at her firſt time, did I ſee your fathers: they went to Baalpeor and ſeparated themſelues to that ſhamefull one, and the deteſtations were according as they loued.
                        
                        11. The glory of Ephraim ſhall flee away like a bird, from the birth and from the wombe, and from the conception.
                        
                        12. But if they bring vp their children, yet

                           will I bereaue them that there ſhall not a man bee left: yea euen woe to them, when I depart from them.
                        
                        13. Ephraim as as I ſee Tyrus, is planted in pleaſant habitation: but Ephraim ſhall bring forth his children to the murtherer.

The high places alſo of Auen, the ſinne of Iſraell ſhall be hewen downe: the thorne and the thiſtle ſhall come vp vpon their Altars, and they ſhall ſay to the mountaines, couer vs, and to the hills, fall vpon vs.
                        
                        
                           
The fourth part of the Prophecie is a confirmation of denounced indgements, as certaine as if it were now come; that they may know and learne by miſerable experience, how their falſe Prophets did ſeduce them, vttering nothing but vanitic and winde, and the froth of their owne imagination, to ſooth vp the people, and nouriſh them in euill. The confirmation therefore is from two cauſes. One their ſacrilegious diſpoſition and wickedneſſe towards God. The other, their ciuill diſcords, and home diuiſions, to the ruine of the Common-wealth, whereby many Kings roſe vp in a ſhort time.
                        8. When I ſpeake of ciuill diſcord, I meane not onely that the Princes and people are intereſſed in this buſineſſe, but the Prophets themſelues, which are ſet of God as watchmen to ouerſee the people, and keepe them at one. They watch indeed, but far in another ſort, for they watch treacherouſly, and perfidiouſly to betray the people, to ſet them at iarre: euen the godly among them, thoſe that cleaue and hold faſt vnto my God.
                        The diuiſions and hart burnings of the people doe they take aduantage of, to ſet them together by the eares: ſo that this diſcord euen in the houſe of God, the Prophet in all his courſes vſeth as a fowlers grinne or ſnare to catch the poore ſoules, and to intrap them.
                        9. But both theſe things, a ſacrilegious diſpoſition and ciuill diſcords, are hereditarie euills to the houſe of Iſraell. And as they corrupt themſelues this way, and throw one another into the depth of all iniquitie, ſinning openly and ſhameleſly, like to that their Fathers did at Gibeah; ſo ſhall they be puniſhed as their fathers were.
                        10 For, touching their ſacrilegious diſpoſition; compare firſt, what their fathers did to Baal peor in the wilderneſſe, where I tooke as great pleaſure in them, and they were as deare and precious vnto me, as grapes, and as the firſt ripe figs; but they forſooke me, &amp; ioyned themſelues to that ſhamefull Idoll: and as the ſway and heat of their ſpirituall luſt did lead them, as they loued and liked, ſo did

they multiplie Idoll after their pleaſure.
                        11. As Ephraim therefore treadeth this way in his forefathers ſteps, ſo ſhall hee be partaker of their plagues. The ſonnes which are the pride and glory of their parents, I will make quicke riddance of, three manner of waies; for eyther they ſhall not quicken in the wombe, or not goe out there their full time or dye as ſoone as they are borne.
                        12. And if happily they ſcape all theſe, and haue ſome bringing vp in their childehood, yet it in all be all one, not one of them ſhall remaine aliue.
                        13. Let them in their owne concei
                              •
                            be neuer ſo ſtrong and ſure, as faſt rooted, and as well planted as Tyrus that famous Citie: yet this that I haue ſaid ſhall ſurely come to paſſe. All their children, yong and olde, ſhall certainely be deſtroyed.
                        14. O God therefore, ſaith the Prophet, diuerting his ſpeech to him, ſince thou haſt threatned two euils, one that their glory ſhall flit away as ſoone as they be borne or conceiued in the wombe: the other, that fathers ſhall loſe their children when they haue brought them vp: be ſatiſfied with that which is the leſſe euill of the twaine; eyther that there may neuer any be borne, or being borne, may for lacke of ſuſtenance dye out of hand.
                        15. But I ſtay not here, I will remember you of another like example of their fathers at Gilgall. There were they wallowing in their wickedneſſe the vncircumciſion of their fleſh made me hate them. And albeit I in my mercy and kindneſſe pardoned their offence, and renewed my Couenant with them, cutting off their foreskin; yet the place which I ſo ſanctified, theſe men prophane againe, that all the wickedneſſe of their forefathers there doth yet ſticke vnto them. They are rebels euery one, all the Princes of them; wherefore I will ſpread my iudgements vpon them.
                        Firſt, I will expell them out of my houſe, and take from them my ſeruice and religion, which they deſpiſe.
                        16. Secondly, they ſhall not proſper; but eyther be as a tree ſmitt with the wormes or weather, that they ſhall not

bring forth the fruit of the wombe; or if they doe, I will command the ſword to ſlay their ſweet and delightfull children.
                        Thirdly, they ſhall be ledde captiue into ſtrange Countries.
                     
                     
                        CHAP. 10.
                        1. Come to their ciuill diſcords: They are good to none but to themſelues. If they bring forth any fruit, they abuſe it to their owne luſts.
                        2. Whatſoeuer they haue, they attribute it to their idols, but God iealous of his glory, will cut off their idols and places conſecrate to Idolatry by the top.
                        3. They thinke, the King ſhould not rule them, but they the King. And becauſe they haue caſt off all reuerence of God, therfore they caſt off and ſet light by the King, which is his Ordinance.
                        4. They are all periured, and falſifiers of their word and Couenant. New Conſpiracies ſpring euery day among them; all is out of order, not iudgement it ſelfe, which ought to be holy vnto God, ſcapeth free, but is turned into bitterneſſe and oppreſſion.
                        A great indignity, that thoſe which liue of the furrowes of my field, and whom my bountie and largeſſe doth ſuſtaine, ſhould make gall and wormewood to grow vp in ſtead of good and ſauourie fruit.
                        5. But the puniſhment of their Idolatries (the Calues of Bethel and Dan) ſhall be.
                        Firſt, feare and trembling.
                        Secondly, loſſe of all their glorie, and whatſoeuer they reioyce in.
                        6. Thirdly, captiuitie of the inhabitants, that ſhall make them aſhamed of their doings.
                        7. Fourthly, deſtruction of the King of Iſraell, hee that is now ſo glorious, ſhall then be no more ſet by, than the foame that is vpon the water.
                        8. Fifthly, Ruine of their Idols, and idolatrous places

wherein the Iſraelites ſinned ſo grieuouſlie.
                        6. The ſenſe and terror of Gods iudgements driuing them to deſperation.
                        9. From the dayes of Gibe ah haſt thou ſinned, O Iſrael, there they stood; the battell in Gibeah againſt the children of iniquity did not reach them.
                        
                        10. It is in my deſire that I binde them; for the people ſhall be gathered againſt them, binding them to be carried away in their two habitations.
                        
                        11. For Ephraim is an heyfer taught, that loueth to tread out the corne: Though I would haue paſſed vpon the be awty of her necke, would haue made Ephraim to ride, Iudah ſhould haue ploughed, and Iacob ſhould haue 
                           Harrowed to him. 
                           harrowed.
                        
                        12. Sowe to your ſelues to righteouſneſſe, (ſaid I) reape vnto kindneſſe, ſwallow vp your fallow ground: for it is time to ſeeke Iehovah, till hee come and powre downe the raine of righteouſneſſe vpon you.
                        
                        13. You haue plowed wickedneſſe, you reape iniquity, you cat the fruit of lying, becauſe thou truſt eſt in thine owne way, in the multitude of thy ſtrong ones.
                        
                        14. Therefore ſhall a tumult riſe among thy people, and thy fenced places ſhall every one bee waſted, as Shalman waſted 
                           Houſe of Arbel. 
                           the countrey of Arbell in the day of battell, the mother with the children ſhall be daſhed in pieces.
                        
                        15. Thus ſhall Bethell doe vnto you, becauſe of 
                           The wickedneſſe of your wickedneſſe. 
                           your exceeding wickedneſſe: in the very morning 
                           In cutting off, cut off. 
                           vtterly cut off ſhall be the King of Iſraell.
                        
                        9. The fift and laſt part followeth, which is the concluſion of the Propheſie: repeating firſt that which was ſaid before, of the peoples ſinning, like their fathers of Gibeah, nothing moued with Gods mercifull and gracious dealing, who cut them not off in that war againſt the wicked Beniaminites, as they did deſerue, but ſuffered them to remaine.
                        10. But becauſe they will not learne to profit by Gods mercies, Let me ſee whother they will profit by my Chaſtiſements.

I think beſt to correct them &amp; to deliuer them bound in both their habitations of Iſrael and of Iuda to bee carried away Captiues.
                        11. Next he doth garniſh and adorne this concluſion by a double diſſimilitude.
                        One is of the Iſraelites affection and diſpoſition compared with Gods gracious counſell towards them.
                        Ephraim, ſaith the Lord by the Prophet, was taught true Piety and inſtructed in the feare of God; my purpoſe was to haue tuned him that he might bee plyable to the yoake, and draw in my plough, and to occupie him in my ſeruice. But he loues to take his eaſe, and onely followeth after his pleaſure and profit.
                        12. The other by comparing Gods documents and inſtructions, calling them to righteouſneſſe and holineſſe, that hath moſt large and ample promiſes annexed it.
                        13. With their contrary deeds vnſatiable in iniquity.
                        14. Laſtly, hee denounceth the Iudgement it ſelfe, a cruell and mortall warre, deſtroying them.
                        Amplifying this deſtruction: Firſt by the greatneſſe, ſet forth by a ſimilitude. That all ſexes and ages ſhall be deſtroyed, euen as Shalman (Shalmanaſar, by all likelihood in that voyage which is ſpoken of 2. Kin. 18. 34. &amp; 19. 13.) waſted and deſtroyed the countrey of Arbel, afterwards renowned for the ouerthrow that Alexander the great gaue in that place vnto Darius.
                        
                        15. Secondly, by the cauſes that brought this Iudgement vpon them. They may thanke their idolatrie for it.
                        Thirdly, by the ſpeedineſſe of the Iudgement. Early, that is to ſay, quickly, and anone it ſhall be done.
                        4. By the certainty, which the doubling of the word importeth.

                        1. Becauſe Iſrael is a youth whom I loue, therefore out of Aegypt haue I called my ſonne.
                        
                        
                           
1. Theſe are the three Sermons touching the ſinnes of the people, and Gods iudgements againſt them for the ſame. Now in two Sermon

                            more he ſetteth forth the promiſes of grace, peace and reconciliation to a ſmall remnant, the little handfull of Gods elect, which in this 11. Chapter, being the firſt Sermon, hee doth foure manner of wayes.
                        Firſt, is the fundamentall cauſe and ground worke of all the good things, which God offereth or beſtoweth vpon the Iewes; which is the grace and fauour of God in and through Chriſt. In whom becauſe God loued them and adopted them for his Children, therefore in his infinite mercy hee brought his ſonne for their ſake out of Egypt, where their ſinnes deſerued, he ſhould perpetually remaine, and neuer to haue come backe for the worke of their redemption.
                        So this place is applyed and expounded. Math. 2.
                        2. As they called to them, ſo went they from their preſence, they ſacrificed vnto Baalim, and burnt incenſe to their grauen Images.
                        
                        3. When as I acquaint Ephraim, he taketh them in his arms: and they know not that I heale them.
                        
                        4. With cords of a man doe I draw them, with thick bands of loue, and I am vnto them as thoſe that lift vp the yoake put vpon their cheekes: that I might reach meate vnto them.
                        
                        5. He was not to haue returned into the Land of Aegypt, or of the Aſſyrian who is his King: but they refuſed to conuert.

                        7. My people are prone to rebellion againſt mee: although they called them to the moſt high, hee doth not withall exalt him.
                        
                        2. The ſecond thing, is the peoples extreame ingratitude 1. Poſit. Refuſing Chriſt. refuſing Chriſt: but that is incled by mentioning the ſinnes of the time, hee liued in; Idolatrie eſpecially and the worſhip

of falſe gods, and is further amplified by comparing Gods gracious dealing in this behalfe, and the holy means, which he vſed to reclaim them.
                        Firſt, he called them by the Prophets.
                        3. Secondly hee taught and enformed the people how he would be ſerued, yet they ſet vp Idolls in his ſtead, and after the manner of impudent and ſhameleſſe ſtrumpets, tooke the puppets in their armes, and embraced them before his face.
                        4. Thirdly, he heaped vpon them many fauors and tokens of his Ioue; howbeit all Gods benefits could not keep them to him, but they would needs flye vnto ſtrangers for helpe.
                        Hee drew them not as beaſts, but gently and louinglie with the words of men. Like a good huſbandman, hee lift vp the yoake from their necke, to giue them meat.
                        5. So as they wanted nothing: there was no cauſe for them to runne for helpe, eyther to the Aegyptian, as Hoſhea did, or to the Aſſirian, to whom they were tributaries from the time of Menachem, yet they would not be ſtayd.
                        6. Thirdly, he layd vpon them heauie croſſes and corrections.
                        The ſword lodged in their houſes, it eate vp and conſumed their very bodies, becauſe of their wickedneſſe.
                        7. Yet they, prone vnto rebellion, tooke no heed, nor gaue glorie vnto God, though all theſe things (the Word, Gods bleſſings and afflictions) invited them vnto him.
                        8. How ſhould I expoſe thee, O Ephraim? how ſhould I deliuer thee vp, O Iſraell? how ſhould I diſpoſe thee as Admah? how ſhould I ſet thee as Zeboim? Mine heart turneth it ſelfe within me, together doe 
                           My repentance. 
                           my bowels of repentance boyle.
                        
                        9. I will not execute the heat of my wrath, I will 
                           Not returne to deſtroy. 
                           no more deſtroy Ephraim: for I am God Almighty, and not a man, the holy oxe in the middeſt of thee, and I will not inuade the city.
                        
                        8. The third thing is the deſolation of this people, which 4. Poſit. Deſolation.
                           
                           
well might haue beene a gulfe to ſwallow them vp, and a graue to bury them in for euer, being moſt worthy to periſh, as the Cities which God deſtroyed in his wrath, Gen. 19. Howbeit, God in the bowels of his mercy, earning and taking pitie of them, ſpareth to lay vpon them the extremitie of his wrath, and is ready to ſaue them for his mercies ſake.
                        This latter hath the proofes and reaſons rendred for it, which are three; all taken from the conſideration of the nature of God.
                        Firſt, his mercies, as we ſaid before.
                        9. Secondly, his vnchangeablenes, being not a man that is alwaies variable, and differing as well from himſelfe as others, but the mightie God, whoſe purpoſe and decrees are conſtant for the ſauing of the elect.
                        Thirdly, his holineſſe, who is himſelfe holy, and the author of eternall ſanctitie.
                        10. After Iehouah ſhall they goe as a roaring Lion: for hee ſhall roare, and the children ſhall 
                           Tremble: So in the next verſe.

                        So he doth foretell that generall ſpreading of the Goſpell, and gathering of the Elect farre and wide, from one end of the heauens vnto another, which immediately followeth the calling of the Iewes, Math. 24. 31. for howſoeuer the words in ſhew ſeeme onely to import the collection of the Iewes, diſperſed into theſe Countries, yet the comparing of that which went before, Chap. 1. 11. maketh me incline to a more generall ſence, and to vnderſtand it of the full comming in of the Gentiles.

                        CHAP. 12.
                        1. Ephraim feeding vpon the winde, and following after the Eaſt winde, all the day long multiplieth lying, and deſtruction: for they make a couenant with Aſſhur, and oyle is carried vnto Egypt.
                        
                        2. Iehovah alſo hath a controuerſie with Iudah: and being to viſit Iacob according to his wayes, will render vnto him according to his doings.
                        
                        3. In the verie wombe, he tooke his brother by the heele: afterwardes in his ſtrength he played the Prince with God.
                        
                        4. He played I ſay the Prince with the Angell, and preuailed, he wept and humblie be ſought him: At Bethel he found him, and there he ſpake with vs.

                        12. The next Sermon, from hence to the end of the booke containeth the ſinnes of the Iſraelites, that is, of the ten Tribes, and an inuiting of them to repentance, which is the end, and the ſcope, whereunto the former driueth. Both firſt propounded, and then amplified and enlarged.
                        Their ſinnes are three.
                        1. The renting off themſelues from the kingdome of Iudah, and the forſaking of true Religion: for though they would ſeeme to worſhip God, yet it was but a falſe, and a

lying worſhip. And this is aggrauated, becauſe they did thus degenerate, euen then when Iudah, like a Prince of God, held faſt his firſt integritie, and kept the faith to God, thoſe holy ones, the Father, Sonne, and bleſſed Spirit.
                        2. The conſociating of themſelues to ſtrangers, making Chapter 12. a couenant with one, bringing preſents to another, not 1. onely in vaine, but to their owne hurt.
                        3. The drawing of Iudah to the like offences: which brought Gods indignation vpon them. 2.
                        
                        To repentance they are inuited by ſetting before them the example of their father Iacob. He left no meanes vnattempted 3. that he might obtaine the bleſſing: hee ſtroue for it with his brother in the wombe, and afterwardes with the Angell.
                        4. Againſt whom with much wreſtling hee preuayled. And when the Angell looſing the hollow of his thigh, wherein hee ſhewed his power, had reproued Iacob for aſking after his name, an argument of his Maieſtie: as being not ſimply an Angell, but Chriſt, Iehovah the Angell of the couenant: Iacob with teares beſought the bleſſing, which he there graciouſly beſtowed, and afterwardes at Bethel confirmed vnto him.
                        5. Euen that Iehovah, whoſe promiſes are eternall, and who will performe them to his Childrens Children, to the thouſand generation, if they returne vnto him.
                        7. He is a marchant, in his hands are ballances of deceit, he loueth to oppreſſe.
                        
                        8. And Ephraim ſaith, yet I am become rich: I haue got me wealth: All my labours ſuffiſe me not, it is iniquitie whatſoeuer is a fault.
                        
                        9. But I am Iehovah thy God, euen from the land of Egypt: yet ſhould I make thee to dwell in theſe Tents, as in the dayes of ſolemnitie?
                        
                        10. And ſpeaking by theſe Prophets, ſhould I multiplie viſion? and by the hand of theſe Prophets, ſhould I propound ſimilitudes?
                        
                        
                           
11. Is there iniquitie in Gilead? are they onely vanitie in Gilgall? They ſacrifice bullockes: euen theſe ment altars are as heapes in the furrowes of my field.
                        
                        12. Thither fled Iacob out of the countrey of Aram: after Iſrael had ſerued for a wife, and for a wife had kept ſheepe.
                        
                        13. Hither alſo by a Prophet did Iehovah bring vp Iſraell out of Egypt: after he was preſerued by a Prophet.
                        
                        14. Ephraim hath prouoked God 
                           With bitterneſſes. 
                           moſt bitterly: therefore 
                           His bloods. 
                           his bloud will his Lord leaue vpon him, and his reproch render to him.
                        
                     
                     
                        CHAP. 13.
                        1. When Ephraim ſpake, there was trembling, hee lift vp himſelfe in Iſraell: but ſo ſoone as he offended with Baal, hee died.
                        
                        2. And now they 
                           Adde to ſin. 
                           ſinne more and more, and make them a moulten Image, of their ſiluer, according to their vnderſtanding, 
                           Bugges. 
                           Idoles, the worke of the Artificers, euery one of them: of them they ſay 
                           The ſacrificert of men. 
                           men that ſacrifice, let them kiſſe the calues.
                        
                        3. Therefore ſhall they be as a morning cloud, and as the dew 
                           Earlying, as a man may ſay. 
                           dropping early, that goeth away: as the chaffe that is driuen with a whirlewind out of the floore; and as the ſmoake out of the top of the chimnie.
                        
                        4. But I am Iehovah thy God, euen from the land of Egypt: and God ſaue me, haſt thou not knowne, neyther is there a Sauiour beſide me.
                        
                        5. I did know thee in the wilderneſſe: in the land 
                           Of droughts 
                           of exceeding drought.
                        
                        6. As their paſtures were, they were filled, aſſoone as they were filled, their heart was exalted: therefore did they forget me.
                        
                        7. And I was vnto them as an old Lyon: as a Leopard in the way did I looke vpon them.
                        
                        8. I met them as a Beare robbed of her whelpes, and I brake the 
                           Shutting. 
                           fall of their heart: and I deuoured them there as a huge Lyon, as a beaſt of the field tearing them.
                        
                        7. Theſe things propounded, now hee doth amplifie

and enlarge each part: and firſt the ſinnes of the Iſraelites: couetouſneſſe, Idolatrie, Pride. Firſt extreame couetouſneſſe, in fraud and oppreſſion.
                        8. Reiecting all honeſt meanes of comming by their wealth, and ſcorning whatſoeuer iumped not with their wicked deſires.
                        9. Albeit God from the beginning had heaped bleſſings manifoldly vpon them; which they ought to haue reſted in, and not to flie vnto vnlawfull meanes.
                        10. Yea, not ſo onely, but had made ample and large promiſes of further fauours by his Prophets.
                        Both which doe adde to the vnworthineſſe of their ſinne.
                        11. Their ſecond ſinne is Idolatrie, wherein more thorowly to conuince their benummed conſciences, the Prophet reaſoneth with them in this ſort: What? thinke you the men of Gilead, thoſe beyond the riuer of Iordan, whom Tiglath Pileſer ſpoyled, and led captiues, that they onely were guiltie of Idolatrie: and you not becauſe you remaine at home vntouched of the Aſſyrian? Nay, ſaith he, the very entrance into the countrey, Gilgall it ſelfe, ſo aboundeth with Idolatrie, that it is not to be doubted, but in the reſt of the parts of the kingdome, their altars are as thicke as furrowes in the field, that is to ſay, innumerable.
                        12. A horrible thing if it be well conſidered, that theſe two places ſhould now become the nurceries of euill, which heretofore were the meanes of ſo great comfort to Gods people.
                        For Gilead ſerued as a ſanctuarie vnto Iacob, when hee fled from Laban.
                        
                        13. In Gilgall, God by Ioſua renewed his couenant with your Fathers, after he had brought them out of Egypt, by the hand of Moſes and Aaron.
                        
                        14. But notwithſtanding all that, Iſraell hath ſo ſinned as hath beene ſaid, and prouoked Gods heauie indignation: and therefore his bloud be vpon him, he ſhall remaine guiltie and ſubiect vnto puniſhment, and muſt be content

to take that, that commeth of it.
                     
                     
                        CHAP. 13.
                        1. For this ſinne of Idolatrie hath brought three fearefull iudgements vpon them.
                        Firſt, They that before were a terrour vnto all, are now of no reckoning.
                        The time indeed was, that if Ephraim did but ſpeake, all the tribes trembled and quaked.
                        But as ſoone as he offended with Baal, following after Idolatrie; he was no more ſet by, then a dead carkaſſe.
                        2. Secondly, God in his iudgement hath giuen them vp into hardneſſe of minde, and to their hearts Iuſt: that for all this ſuddaine change they repent not, but run more and more into Idolatrie.
                        3. Thirdly, Being made very fooles, at the length, they ſhall vaniſh and come to nothing.
                        4. Thus by the place, and by the effects, hee hath made odious their Idolatrie.
                        Now laſtly, he doth the ſame by comparing on the contrary part, his couenant with them from the beginning, and his former benefits, euen in the wilderneſſe.
                        5. Both which ought to haue beene motiues to keepe them faſt vnto him.
                        6. The third ſinne is their pride, and loftineſſe of heart, which made them to forget God; and that in the middeſt of his bleſſings, when they had moſt cauſe to remember him. A thing that Moſes warned them of before, Deut. 8.

                        9. He hath marred thee, O Iſraell, when as in me, in thine helpe, thou mighteſt haue ſtood.
                        
                        10. Where is thy King, Where now? that he may ſaue thee in all thy cities? and thy Iudges, of whom thou ſaideſt, giue me a King and Princes:
                        
                        11. I giue thee a King in mine anger, and take away in my wrath.

And ſo hauing done with the ſinnes of the Iſraelites, he doth now amplifie, and enlarge his former inuitation vnto repentance: Firſt taking arguments from the good that thereby ſhall come vnto them, compared with the euils that before they were in, for their offences. Hee ſaith, God by his Prophet, meaning the King of whom he ſpeaketh in the next verſe, in whom thou puttedſt thy truſt. Was the cauſe of thy Confuſion. Whereas in me who am thy ſtrength, and ſauing health, all good things are to bee found, and by repentance ſhall come vnto thee.
                        10. The former part is proued, for that none of their Kings and Princes were able to doe them good.
                        11. For God in his wrath ſet them vp, and pulled them downe: and in a little while made many changes and alterations in the kingdome.
                        12. Their iniquitie, which God tied vp, as a man doth his purſe full of money, and kept in ſtore, to pay them home for it, was the cauſe of all this.
                        13. Yet were they ſo fooliſh, that though throwes came vpon them, as vpon a woman with Childe, (for ſo is their Common-wealth compared to a mother, Chapter 23.). yet they had no liſt to rid themſelues out of thoſe dangers, and to put forth into the hands of God, as vnto a Midwife.
                        And this may well ſeeme to be a prophecie of the great 4. Poſit. Deſolation.
                            miſerie they are now in, becauſe of the promiſes which do follow.

                           Veſſels of deſire.

                        14. In the ſecond part, from the panges and ſorrowes before mentioned, he paſſeth preſently to moſt ſweet and comfortable promiſes. Being of foure kindes.
                        The firſt promiſe is. The deliuerie of them out of that depth of miſerie, wherein they were plunged, and making them to flouriſh againe: which is firſt ſet out by a double ſimilitude.

                        And this reſurrection (as it were) of their is an euident argument of the generall riſing from the dead, Ezech. 37.
                        To which purpoſe the Apoſtle aptly, and properly doth alledge it. 1. Cor. 15.

That as an Eaſterly winde, and atempeſtuous ſtorme hath dried them quite: and ſpoyled all their delightfull treaſures: made them the vileſt and moſt contemptible of the earth, notwithſtanding which he ſayth: Ephraim (that is, euen the ten Tribes) ſhall flouriſh againe, and hold vp 8.

                        CHAP. 14.
                        1. Returne O Iſraell, euen to Iehovah thy God: for thou haſt fallen by thine iniquitie.
                        
                        2. Take with you words, and turne to Iehovah: Say vnto him, forgiue all iniquitie, and 
                           
                              Take. That is, taking, beſtow as Exod. 25. 2.

                        3. Aſſhur ſhall not ſaue vs, vpon horſe we will not ride; neither will we ſay any more, O our God to the worke of our hands: for in thee the fatherleſſe findeth mercie.
                        
                        1. The ſecond promiſe, is a promiſe of their repentance, Chapter 14. and turning vnto God, whereunto exhorting them, it 5. Poſit. Call.

                        3. And laſtly, in the motiue to repentance, Gods nature readie to ſhew mercie to poore diſtreſſed ſinners.
                        4. I will heale their turning away, louing them freely: when mine anger ſhall turne from him.
                        
                        4. The third promiſe, is forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, peace, 35. Poſit. Couenant.
                            reconciliation, and Gods gracious acceptance of them in his Sonne, comming from his owne free loue and fauour, which are the fruites and ioyfull effects of their repentance.
                        5. I will be as the dew vnto Iſraell, he ſhall bloſſome as the Lillie: and

                           tree, by me is thy fruit 
                           Is found. 
                           at hand.
                        
                        The fourth promiſe is of a glorious Church, which ſhall be ſet vp among them: conſiſting in the points that follow;
                        1. A moſt flouriſhing and happie eſtate, through the 39. Poſit. Proſperitie.
                            ſweete and heauenly ſhowers of all ſpirituall, and temporall benedictions, which God from heauen will water them withall. Whereby, firſt they ſhall roote, and faſten downewards, gather ſuch a head as no ſtrength nor power, not hell gate, ſhall be able to preuaile againſt them.
                        6. Then ſhall they grow and ſpread vpwardes, be faire, freſh, and flouriſhing; Not onely ſo, but their happineſſe, ſhall be conſtant and perpetuall, like to the Oliue tree, whoſe leaues are alwayes greene.
                        Laſtly, this ſhall make them gracious and acceptable, both with God and men.
                        7. Secondly, Other people rauiſhed with the ſight of 44. Poſit. All nations embracing Chriſt.
                            ſuch perfections, ſhall count themſelues happie to dwell in their Tents, and as it were, vnder the ſhadow of thoſe boughes. The Nations of ſuch as are to bee ſaued ſhall walke in her light, and the Kings of the earth ſhall bring their glory and honor in vnto her. Reu. 21. 24.
                        3. The Church by this meanes ſhall be encreaſed, grow, and multiplie as eares of corne, or cluſters in the Vine; 38 Poſit. Multitude of beleeuers.
                            for by bringing into life, or making to liue, is meant the ſpirituall propagation of Gods people, by the ſeede of the word, and power of Gods ſpirit.
                        4. The Nations ſhall honor them, and haue them in 45. Poſit. Nations honouring them.
                            admiration. Farre and wide ſhall their fame be ſpread, and their name be moſt ſweete and precious.
                        Thus doth hee comfort and arme their ſoules againſt thoſe tempeſts, that blouſtrous ſtorme and weather, which before they felt, Chapter 13. 15.
                        8. Fiftly, the zeale of this people, when their heart ſhall turne vnto the Lord: purging of their Church from 34. Poſit. Puritie of doctrine.
                            all corruption in Gods ſeruice, which is here noted by Idolatrie, and the worſhip of falſe gods. They ſhall haue no

more to doe with Idoles, or any worſhip which is not offred in the name of his onely ſonne. Which God ſo graciouſly will accept, that his eares ſhall be open, and his eyes alwayes bent onely vpon thoſe that leauing falſe ſeruices and religions, betake themſelues to him in Chriſt, whom he will alſo recompence with aboundance of heauenly bleſſings, the fruites of holineſſe and righteouſneſſe 36. Poſit. Spirituall graces.
                            wrought in them by the Spirite of Chriſt, which is the ſixt and laſt poynt.
                        But leaſt Iſraell ſhould take glorie to himſelfe, he telleth them that the prayſe of ſo great things, both of their turning, and of this their fructifying is to be aſcribed to God alone, without whom they can doe nothing.
                        9. Who ſo is wiſe, let him vnderſtand theſe things, prudent, let him alſo acknowledge them: for right are the wayes of Iehovah, and the righteous ſhall walke in them, but fallers away, let them ſtumble at them.
                        
                        9. The laſt verſe hath a concluſion of this whole Prophecie, by an Epiphonema, or elegant acclamation. Wherein the Prophet doth ſtirre vp and exhort the righteous to learne true wiſedome and vnderſtanding for three reaſons.
                        1. For that it is a readie paſſage, the tract, and high way to happineſſe and glorie.
                        2. Theſe wayes are all of them ſtraight and right, full of equitie and holineſſe.
                        3. The righteous ſhall proſperouſly walke in them, to the ſauing of their ſoules.
                        Contrariwiſe, he leaueth the wicked, that fall away and goe backe from the holy doctrine taught vnto them, to the righteous Iudgement of God, as the Apoſtle doth. Reu. 22. 11.

No ſorrow like to the ſorrow that all this while hath befallen thee. No people ſo diſperſed, without gouernment, without Religion, without forme, eyther of Church or Common-wealth. No nation ſo contemptible &amp; abhorred in the ſight of God and Men. And that worthily; for in thee is found a ſinne of all that euer were in the world the ſhamefulleſt. To murder him that created thee, that by his word and workes did magnifie thee, and make thee ſo famous, that came in his owne perſon to ſaue thee: the Lord himſelfe from Heauen.
                  But the dayes of this thy ſinfulneſſe, God winking at, doth now euery where, and by all meanes inuite thee to repentance. Out of all the places of thy diſperſion, Eaſt, Weſt, North, and South, his purpoſe is to bring

thee home againe, &amp; to marry thee to himſelfe by faith for euermore. In ſtead that thou waſt deſolate and forſaken, and fatteſt as a widdow, thou ſhalt flouriſh as in the dayes of thy youth. Nay, aboue and beyond thy youth. To be the ioy of the earth, the moſt noble Church that euer eye did ſee. Small were thy beginnings how great ſoeuer, ſo exceedingly ſhall thy latter end encreaſe. Thy Sauiour will ereit be long, draw neare vnto thee: not as once he did, riding vpon an Aſſe, baſe, and in humilitie, but as the glorius king of Tſion, ſubduing al things to himſelfe by the ſcepter of his word. Breaking thy hard heart, fallowing vp the fallowes of thy ſoule, he will ſet vp all his glorie in the middeſt of thee, and make thee the wonder of the world. Out of thee ſhal come gems and precious ſtones, richer then the Saphire, ruddier then the Carbuncle, ſhining aboue the Topaze. Ezraes, Nebemies, Mordecaes, builders of a better Temple then that which thou haſt doated vpon ſo long. Then ſhalt thou mourn, as the mourning for ones onely begottten ſonne: and all thy Tribes, with ſorrow and true repentance, ſhall look

vpon him whom they haue thruſt through. Thy gates ſhall be made of pearles, and thy ſtreetes of pure gold. All the Kings of the Gentiles ſhall bring their glory into thy cittie, and fall downe before thee. The light of the Moone ſhall be as the light of the Sun, and the light of the Sunne, ſeauen fold as the light of ſeauen dayes. Thy Sun ſhall not ſet by day, nor thy Moone by night. Bleſſed ſhall they be that bleſſe thee, &amp; curſed ſhall they be that curſe thee. When the Lord ſhall raiſe thy dead carkaſes by the miniſtrie of the Goſpell, and ſay, Awake ye that haue ſlept ſo long in the duſt of the earth.
                  And becauſe God wil do theſe great things for thee, doe thou prepare thy ſelfe to meete thy God. Words faile me for to ſet an edge, and to put ſome ſpirituall life into thee. But my hart ſhal neuer faile to pray for thy proſperitie all my dayes. Bowing my knees to the Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, the God of glorie, that he would haſten that which he hath ſpoken concerning thee by the Prophets of old, and by the Apoſtles ſent by his ſonne. Whoſe counſels are without repentance, his loue neuer changeth: he will

not forget his promiſes to thy Fathers: but will graft thee in by faith into that naturall Oliue tree, from the which, thorough infidelity thou art hitherto broken off. The root is holy and ſo it ſhall be manifeſt that thou (the branches) art, when Gog and Magog falling before thee (which dayes are euen now at hand) thou ſhalt ſit as a Lady in the mount of comelineſſe, that hill of beautie, the true Tſion, and heauenly Ieruſalem, to the worldes admiration. And for my ſelfe, I ſhall thinke, I reape aboundant fruit of theſe my trauailes, if in the day of thy reioycing, in the day of the gladnes of thy heart, when God ſhall doe theſe great things for thee, it may beſayd that I haue layd one ſtone, (ſay it be but a peble ſtone) toward thy ſpirituall building.
