            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               COnſideringe with myſelf (louinge Reader) many and ſundrye times, how yt nothinge is ſo deſired, ſo acceptable, or ſo neceſſarye in the time of daungerous infirmities, and pearel of bodely helth, as to preſerue thoſe yt are free of ſicknes frō the violence of the ſame, and to reſtore the ſicke, weake, and languiſhing paciente vnto his former eſtate and priſtinate healthe, which thyng is performed by the noble and excellente knowledge of Phiſicke: and again, howe that this Arte is exerciſed, yea of famous and learned men, which with out any great profit to the pacient, or worſhip to ye miniſter, becauſe their medicines are negligently prepared: I thought it my part, by this my trauail and expenſes, ſomwhat to ſerue herein thy neceſſity. Wherfor, I haue cauſed this precious treaſure to be tranſlated into oure vſuall, and natiue language, that like as all men are ſubiecte to ſicknes: ſo in likewiſe all men may by this occaſion learne the way vnto helth. And becauſe thauthor (whoſe name I ſpare to manifeſt, for feare of inuious detracters) do in many places of this his work, ſend the Reader vnto Philippe Vlſtadius &amp; Brunſvvick:
               
therfore I will with expedition (if this my labors ſhall be thankfullye accepted,) alſo publiſhe them, ſparing neither laboure, diligence, or charges for to bringe them bothe to their perfection, and alſo thy neceſſarye vſe. As touchinge the excellencye of the preparinge medicines, the vtilitie ſpringinge therof, and the argumente of the worke, becauſe it is exactlye ſette oute by the author in the preface folowing, I wil leaue to trouble the further herein.

                  i Of the inuention of liquors and oyles deſtilled.
                  ii Of the ſcope and end of this booke. Whereof more alſo ſhalbe ſpoken about the end of the Preface.
                  iii The praiſe of them that can be content to make commō the beſt and moſt effectuous medicins they haue.
                  iiii How much the dreſſing and maner of preparans auaileth in euery thing.
               
            
            
               THe Art of deſtillatiō (whiche they call Chymia, Alchimia, Alkimia, Chemia Suidas calleth it, and Alchemia) hath inuented many profitable things for mās life, and in Phiſicke alſo certain meruelous thinges, and praiſe worthy, if a man prepare them righte and diligentlye. For the lacke of knowledge, Couetouſnes or negligence of Phiſitions and commun Apothecaries is the cauſe why many ſuch preparations are ſet litle by: and worthily, if you reſpect that which they prepare: vnworthely, if ye marke the Art it ſelfe, whiche certes is moſt excellent and moſt profitable: which ſemeth to be the cauſe why it lay hid ſo long, and began to come in vre very late. Some aſcribe vnto Hierom of Brunſvvick, which about .lxx. yeares paſt practiſed Phiſick at Argentyn, the originall of getting out waters, as they cal them, and liquors and oyles out of ſimple medicines by the ſtrengthe of fire: but they are much deceiued, for this Arte was not inuented by him, but wryten in our Dutch tung and firſt ſet out by him. In mine opinion this inuencion is ſo aū
               cient as the inuencion of the very Chymia, which I ſuppoſe was celebrated firſt and put in wryting by men that

vſed the Punicall or els the Arabicke tonge, a litle after the age of the Grecian Phiſicions, Of thoſe I ſpeake that writ almooſte the lateſt, as Aetius, Oribaſius, Actuarius, Pſellus. In certain libraries in Italy euen at this day, are there extant certain wrytinges of Chymia by certain late Grecians, namely a certain Philoſopher called Stephan: al ſo a boke intituled of the chaunging of metals, which cō
               munlye are called Chymia, or Arcymia. There is alſo a boke to be had of Alchymia made by Auicenna vnto Aſſis a Philoſopher. Geber (the Nepheu of I canne not tell what great Mahomet) who is celebrated as a captain and prince of this ſcience, what age he liued in I can not eaſily ſay. Although I iudge him not to haue bene the firſt in uentor of this Art, but one that broughte it to lighte and renouned it. This man in his worke intitled Summae perfectionis, diſcourſinge excellentlye and diſputinge manye things of deſtillacion generallye, writeth that diuers maners of deſtilling are knowne almoſt of all men, euen as an auncient inuenciō, yea in his time alſo, no new thing. Certain late wryters declare the wrytinges of Alchymia not only of Albertus Magnus, S. Thomas, Rhaza, and Auicenna, Arabik Phiſitions, but alſo of Ariſtotle, Plato and Salomon, at the leaſt wiſe mention to be made by thē of it: to whome I geue ſmall credence, not that I thincke this ſtudye to be the newer, but certes that it was ether vnknown to theſe philoſophers or mentioned in no place. Some there be that expound feetly and wittily al the feinings of the Poets, and chieflye that of the golden fleece, ſought by the Argonautae, vnto the multiplying of Golde or Art of enterchaunging of metalles. Some alſo aſcende higher, and make the firſt men by and by after the beginnidg of the world, authors therof. Some ſimplely make it moſt auncient, and affirme that no certainty is to be had of the firſt inuēters. At Padvvay in Italy in our time was found a moſt auncient monument, namely an erthen pot, hauing written vpon it this Hexaſticon.

            Within this pot was an other litle pot with the inſcription of theſe verſes.

            Again, within this little pot was found a light yet burning betwene two Phials, the one of Gould, the other of Siluer, ful of a certain mooſte pure liquor, by the vertue wherof they beleue that this lighte had burnte manye a yeare, as did noote in their collections and gatherings of old auncient inſcriptiōs or Poeſies Petrus Appianus and Bartholom eus Amantius Hermolaus Barbarus alſo in his

Corollarium or addicion vpon Dioſcorides made mention of this ſame thing, wheras he entreateth of waters in cō
               mun. There is alſo (ſaith he) a heauenlye water, or rather diuine of the Chymiſtes, whiche boothe Democritus and Mercury Trimegiſtus knewe: callinge it ſometimes a deuine water, ſomtimes a Seythicall liquor, ſomtimes pneuma, that is, ſpirit of the nature of the firmament, and of y• fift eſſens or ſubſtance of things: wherof potable gold, and that philoſophers ſtone much ſpoken of, but not yet fond, conſiſteth. Hereupon alſo is the name geuen vnto the art calling it Pſammurgicall, and miſticall, and Annophyſiall and holy, and greateſt: as thoughe it had certaine ſecreate letters, and ſuch as it ſhould be conueniente to kepe and reſtrein the profane commun people from. This kinde of liquor, as I ſuppoſe, dothe the Epigram ſignifye of late found within the field of Padua nie vnto the village called Ateſta, made vpon earthen or bricke mettal, and therfore frail, and broken vnwares by the handes of a man of the country digging the ground in the ſame place. The remē
               brance wherof leaſt it ſhould peariſh we haue added hereunto the very wordes. This holy gift to the God, &amp;c. as before. Therfore it appeareth that the ſtudy of this Art was of moſte antiquitie amongſte the Barbarus nacions, but deriued vnto the Romains and Grekes ſomwhat late, nether before perauenture that the Romains obteined the dominion of a great part of the worlde: or if ſooner yet couertly &amp; reteined emongſt a very fewe. Cicendulae y• ſhine in the night (ſaith Cardane) teach vs that a liquor may be made that may ſhine in the dark. It is made certes by the putrifying of thoſe things that haue moſt erceding brightnes, light &amp; perſpicuitie. I dout not but it is poſſible to be made, wherof and how, I am vncertain. But theſe things are almoſt beſides our matter, ſauing that it mighte ſeme vtterly that the way to ſublimate &amp; deſtil, as they term it, hath had his original of the Chimiſts, &amp; continued alſo alwais

wt their art: was opened vnto the mē of our parte of the world thē firſt, whē as ye world being made known bithimpery of the Romains, ſundry kinds of ſpices alſo &amp; diners medicins vnknown befor to the men of Europe, &amp; to the Grekes &amp; Latins alſo, began to be brought in: and afterward alſo more, what time as the Mauritans &amp; mē learned in the Arabik tung &amp; doctrin, poſſeſſed a great part of Spain, wherby certain bokes of learned mē cam vnto vs: &amp; amongſt the latter ſort, as I think, the works of one Bulcaſis Benaberazeris who in the place wher he intreteth of the preparation of medicins, teacheth alſo of many things to be ſublimated &amp; deſtilled. About the age of the ſame mā almoſt, I think Iohannes Meſue was famous, whō we read to haue liued about ye yere of our Lord. 1158. But be mē
               cioneth none other deſtild waters thē of Roſes &amp; Wormwod. Mē ſay Auicenna floriſhed the yere of our Lord. 1149▪ who alſo ſpeketh of Roſe water deſtild. The vſa of metalli things ſublimated is far more auncient, at the leaſte wiſe touching the tradition or tretiſes of authors, &amp; like wiſe is the vſe of oyls that are made by deſcenſion or downwarde as in Raſis &amp; Aetius. A certain mā (whoſe name I ſpare to rehers,) writ of late that theſe maner of deſtilled liquors wer not vnknown to the latter Greke writers, vſing this argument, that deſtilled liquors are ſometimes named in the writings &amp; works of Actuarius, And in dede he nameth in ſōe places Rhodoſtagma, as in his Iulep againſt ye cogh: &amp; a litle folowing in an other Iulep intyboſtagma. But wt theſe words is ſignified nothing els thē a ſimple ſyrup of Roſes or Endiue. Rhodoſtactum doth Agenita deſcribe in his. 7. boke, yt. 15. cha. with theſe words. Sieth .ii. ſextars of the iuice of Roſes yt nails wherof are takē away, one ſertar of hony ſkimming it til the .iiii. part be conſumed. Ye a litle before alſo he deſcribeth Hydroroſatū
                roſed water, that alſo far differing frō a deſtiled liquor, or water deſtild for it conſiſteth of .iiii. pounds of Roſes the nailes takē away .v. ſextaries of water: ii. ſextaries of hony.

The Arabians alſo or their expoſitors, when they ſpeake of the water of any plant, they vnderſtand the decoctiō of it in water: and likewiſe Nicolas Myrepſus that writte in Greke of the compoſitions of medicines, whome it appeareth to be a verye late wryter, by the barbarous woordes that he vſeth very oft: wherin I maruel this, that no mē
               tion is made by him of waters or oyles prepared in Chymiſtical inſtruments. Only the oyl Capniſtum or ſmoked, that is deſtilled by deſcention, doth he deſcribe, as Aetius alſo. Moreouer, the thinges that the Chimiſtes make may I comprehend in .ii. kindes for the moſte parte, that they be ether liquors or Maſſy things, the liquors againe are ether watery or oyly: and theſe ether aiery or fiery. The Maſſy things, are ether ſuch as reſt in the bottom: or ſuch as are caried vpwarde: and that .ii. waies, ether as pure bodies and ſubſtauces, as they which they cal ſublimated, quick ſiluer. &amp;c. or Sout for the remedies of the eies wyth Phiſicions. There be alſo other artificial manner of preparings, wherwith the pureſt and moſt effectual parte in medicines is drawne out, and as it were the forme is ſeparated from the matter.
            And although I am not greatly trauailed nether in the Chymiſtical nor in the other manner of preparings, but by the way haue got the kuowledge of certain thinges, partly by mine own experience in ſome things, &amp; partlye of myfrends: yet what ſo euer and how much ſo euer this is, I wil communicat it with the ſtudions of Phiſick: not as though I entend to teach perfectly and abſolutely the very Art of deſtilling and preparing of other things, but as it were wryting vnto ſuch as now already are not all voyde and withoute knowledge of theſe things, hauing ether experimented them ſelues or red other mens wrytings. For I haue nothing ſo exrellēt or ſecrete, but I couet it might ge abrode to the publik and common profit,

and although in ſmal wealth, yet haue I ben euer of nature ready to communicate and make any man priuye of any cunning I had, which ſom referre vnto ſimplicitie or childiſhnes, other ſome better to the liberalitie of my diſpoſition. There be ſome that do vtterly cloke and kepe ſecrete their things, and that diuers kinde of men: ſome for Ambicion, that they maye haue wherewith to excell and pas other menne: ſome alſo for couetouſnes, to get gayne thereby: other thorowe the ignoraunce of the aunciente wryters, as thoughe there were not put in wrytinge ether the ſame or far better by men of antiquitie, whiche now are deſpiſed of many, and a foliſh and vnſaciable luſt is ther alwais to find out new things. Ther wantes not ſuch as think, great and effectual medicins ſhuld be kepte ſecrete for this cauſe, leaſt vncunning men, as many practicioners be, without al reaſon almoſt, and al learnynge, might abuſe them, and conuert thoſe thinges whiche are inuented for the helth of mē, to their deſtruction. To ſuch wold I anſwer, As no kind of euil ought to be committed for this intent that any good thing might follow therof: ſo that which is good ought not to be left vndone, leaſte ſom euil might enſue, for the world ſhal neuer be without them that wil abuſe good things and profitable inuencions. But good men, ſimplely ſuche good thinges as they haue, they make them common, and wil not ſtick nor ceſe to do ſo becauſe they feare, that certain leud perſons may do hurt therby. But I wil leaue of this diſputation, thye do I proteſt ſincerely &amp; as I thinck withal my hart, that I couet by my example to ſtur vp learned and good Phyſions, that laying apart al Ambition, Couetouſnes, Ignorance, Enuy, if they can bring any excellent thinge vnto our profeſſion, that they wold do it gentlely and publikely. As for the vnlearned certes, they in miniſtring not only theſe great and effectual medicines, of whiche ſorte we

ſhal put diuers in wrytinge heare, but meates alſo and moſt common drinkes, out of time, do haſard and brynge mens liues manye times to diſeaſes and deathe: and it is well known that Hippocrates writ how our Ptiſan miniſtred not in due time, was the cauſe of death to a certaine man ſick of the Pleuriſy. Theſe therfore ought to be lefte partly to their ignorance, partly to their leude malapartnes. But they that haue nede of the Phyſicion are to be admoniſhed to do that in Phiſicke, that all men are wont to do in al other Artes: that is, to chuſe good Phyſicions, and learned, and ſuch as exerciſe and practiſe this Art by their profeſſion, both with reaſōs, as a part of Philoſophy and alſo in the very actions and doinges of cures. But I return to the purpoſe. The preparing therfor (as I ſay) is of the greateſt moment and weight in euerye matter. In Rhetorik vtterans, geſture, and pronunciation more almoſt moue the mindes of the hearers, then the very argument that is handled. Hereupō it cometh that things put in meter and in numbers, do delite ſo greatly: which if a man vtter in proos, they ſhalbe taken for cold, dnl and ſoliſhe. Hereof cometh it that one beinge aſked the queſtion what was the chiefeſt thinge in an orator, anſwered pronunciation: what was the next and the third: the ſame. Shewes and plaies, that thei delite the hearers and beholders ſo greatly, it is much more long of the form and maner of their forniture and preparance then of the matter plaied or ſhewed. In like maner in the verye thinges and workes, the forme, the faſhion, figure, maner, aſwel of nature as of Art, finally a certain preparation is more marked and commended then the matter. Likewiſe in phyſſk, the conninge to prepare thinges aright, and the deſcreſſion to miniſter them aptly, haue the greateſt moment and ſkil moſte. Nether is it of greater force what thou miniſtreſt, then in what maner. And althoughe there be manye circircumſtances

to be conſidered, that thou maiſt exhibit the medicin aright, yet the maner, and the preparing is with in the medicine, and is at it were the form therof and part the other circumſtaunces are withoute it, as time, place, and ſuch things as are to be conſidred about the ſickman. But letting pas other waies of dreſſing and preparing at this preſēt, we wil onli touch thoſe, bi the which al the vertue and faculti or operation is ſeparated from the ſubſtāce of the medicins, ſo that ye more liquid and moyſt, the more pure and ſubtil part of euery remedy or medicin, maye be bad ſeuered and drawn out from the groſe and erthy part: whether it be gathered into a liquor drawn out of the ſam remedy or medicin or into an other certaine ertarnall. &amp;c. which the barbarous wryter Arnold calleth Eruirtuare to outuerteuat, or Excorporare, to outcorporate. Furthermore, if ſumthings ſhal ſeme to be written ſomwhat curiouſly or double diligently, ye muſt conſider that ſuthe pertain not to the Phyſicions of the common people and pore fooke, but to ſuch as abound more with riches and eaſe, &amp; haue plenty of ſeruants, or ſuch as remain in Prynces or Kings courts: or alſo to Philoſophers, that buſilye ſearche out the meruelous mutacion and vertues of natural thinges, and in them delite them ſelues. To conclude, let no man maruel that ſo great and longe commendacions and praiſes are added to certain medicines, as vnto the Quinteſſences as they call them, to Aqua vities, &amp; made ba
                  •
               mes, and that vnto ſome meruelous vertues are attributed, as to ſharpen the wit and memory, to cōſerue the ſenſes and youth. &amp;c. When as euen by the auncient Grekes &amp; Latins alſo we read ſuch effects and operacions to be aſcribed to Triacle and other preſeruatiues and compoſitions, ſpecially by the Arabians vnto diuers things, yea euen of Galen alſo vnto Triacle. Ther be ſom that I wil not auow, and whoſe credit I leaue to the authors, whoſe names I

write euery where. But it is ſaid before alreadye, that we wryt all theſe thinges for the learned and diſcreate men, which for the moſt part ſhall iudge more eaſily how much credit is to be geuen to euery thinge. Althoughe in verye many it is not ſufficient to be furniſhed with learning and iudgement, excepte experience and practiſe be ioyned alſo therwith. But I make an end heare of my Preface.

               VVhat Deſtillation is, and of diuers formes and kyndes.
            
               
                  DESTILLATION not diſtillatiō (as lerned  doe write) is the drawyng forthe of a thinner and purer humor out of a iuiſe, by the force of heate: Siluius. Deſtillation by aſcentiō or going vpwarde, is when the vapours or fume is caried vp and be there gathered together into water &amp; ſo droppe doune: The ſame authour. Moiſt thinges put into a body (for ſo do they cal the bigger  veſſell, from whence the vapur is lifted vp) by the force of heate are extenuated into a vapour, whiche gathered together by the coldenes of the head or other thing, into water, is receiued for the moſt part, by a chanel or gutter made in ye brinks of the head, and ſo dropeth doune and deſtilleth by the noos (for ſo do they communly term that part of the head, very neer reſembling mās noos, both in faſhion and in vſe) into ſome veſſell ſette vnder for the purpoſe, men call it a receiuer or a vrinall: Siluius. Certain like things natur hath wrought, both in exhalatiōs aboue in the aire, ſpecially thē 
                that be moiſt, and alſo in reumes deſtilling from the head both of men &amp; certain other beaſtes, vnto

the lower partes. Therfore of a plant or any other ſubſtaunce ordeined to be deſtilled: what part of it is moſt meet to be extenuated and fynet (that is the pureſt parte, the lighteſt, the thinneſt, the moiſteſt, and the moſt ſuperficial parte next vnto the vttermoſt partes of the body) being firſt of all fyned by the force of heet, is lifted vp: next ſuche other partes as in puernes cum nie to the firſt and laſt ſuche a moyſture of the thinges as is more groſſe that held together the earthly partes, a certain  fatnes and oylines, by a ſtronger force of the fyre, is ſeperated, and takē vp hoolly: which once clean drawn forthe, the body remaineth diſſolued and brought into aſſhes. Oute of all maner of plantes therfor, and beaſtes: Yea out of al partes of them bothe, a certain raw wateriſhnes, and as it were a fleumatick and excrementall parte, is firſt drawen oute: then cumyth forth that whiche is better diſgeſted and more pure: laſt of all an oylines: whiche alſo euen oute of the very bones  may be gottē, and not only out of maſſy partes: ſauing that certain partes ar of ſo ſcleuder and thin ſubſtance, ye they yelde vp almoſt all their moiſter ſtrength at the firſt. Morouer, all this drawing oute of humors, is done with heet. For that kinde of Deſtillation, that is done by a ſhred of wullen cloth, (they cal it a filter) or by grauel, a raw earthen veſſell, a veſſell of iuye trie (Plinie, I thinke, writes of the wode that is called Smilax, how it willet ſype through water mixt with wyne, and  kiep the wyne ſtill: which I once proued &amp; found

it trewe) but this is no deſtillation in deed, except vnto ſuche as ſpeake improprely. For that which is proprely called deſtilation is done by heet: and that from the ſonne, or of fyre, corruption and rot tennes: By the ſonne, as certain men haue inuē
               ted, to draw of flowres a kind of water, very nere to them ſelues in ſmell and other pleaſaunt qualities. By fyre, that is, by flame that come of aere and of aereall bodies: or els by burning cooles, that are made of earth or earthly bodies enkindled,  deſtillation is made, ether by no other thing betwixt, or by the meanes of hoat water, or alſo by the vapour and feume of the ſame, by fine ſand or dros of metall poliſhed and made plaine.
            Morouer the flame it ſelfe, aſwell as the coole, is diuers, not onely in reſpect of that it is great and little, but alſo of the woode whether it bee rotten and doated, or ſound, ſtinking, or wel ſmelling: grene or drie. Beſides this it is a great matter what bignes the furnace be of, what faſhion,  what ioyning together. Alſo the coole of ſmothered and half burnd wode, giueth a certain ſtrong ſauour, and a quality far vnlyke to the thinges deſtilled: as we ſee it doeth to thinges boyled and otherwyſe prepared therwith. Therefor let the cooles be all fired, and halfbrent, that the ill ſauour be expired before that the thing to be deſtilled be committed vnto them: ſpecially if it be receiued into the body: for in ſuche thinges as ar to be vſed without, it forceth leſſe, al this ſaith Syluius. 
                In the deſtillation of wyne the foure elementes

aſcende vp in their order: the lighteſt, ſubtilſt, and hoateſt firſt, that is, the fire: ſecondarily the aire: thirdly water: the earth remaineth in y• bottome: and lykewyſe I iudge in the deſtillation of vineger.  In more groſſe &amp; earthly thinges, yet moyſt alſo, whiche beſides the watery partes, haue alſo ſome groſe and ſuch as may be made thicke as in the teares that run out of tries or gūmes, in ioyces, in roſin and in hony, that which is more watery is caried vp firſt, the airy partes next, the firy laſt of al, ye earthy partes remain in the bottome: and if the fier be any thyng bigg they ar burnt. In metalles, the ſame ar reſolued into vapours, and congeled together, ſticke to the lembeck, the coloure chaunged into whyt, as quick ſyluer, arſnike. &amp;c. Saltpeter. &amp;c.
            The nature of fyre is to deminiſhe (as Cardane 
                ſaith) ether by breaking drye thinges into peces, as when it bringeth grauell into duſt: or by melting, as metalles: or by ſeparating the ſubtill and pure partes as in deſtillations. It chaunceth in deſtillations notwithſtanding, that a thing ſhall both be extenuated and mixt with an other, when as they ar done with a moyſte heat, not with fyre. For a heat bothe extenuateth and mixeth with moyſture. This is doon ſumtyme by ſetting the veſſels in hoat water: whiche is called Balneum 
                
               Mariae. The beſt kinde of deſtillation next vnto this, is in hors dong. Then by aſſhes: the beſt in this kynde, is by the ſuperfluous refuſe of oliues, after the oyle is preſt forth, for it being a hoat &amp;

moyſt matter, will reteyne his heat very long, yea a great meany of monethes: and ſo muche the lō
               ger then the kurnels of grapes, becauſe the ſubſtance of the oliues is thicker &amp; fatter. But none  of thies wayes is able to melt metalles, but they muſt nedes haue fyer. Albeit as the moſt vehement and feruent deſtillation is done by fyre: ſo is it vnmiet for mixture and true attenuation, or fyning: and the way by aſſhes is almoſt lyke vnto it. for if a man will put thinges deſtilled by fyre vnto their own dregges and mixt them together, he ſhall perceiue the quantity for quantity, heuier then they were afore, and dryer alſo. Therfor fyre doth not truely attenuat and leſſen in dede, but that nature whiche digeſteth &amp; mixeth the hoole ſubſtāce. Wherfor through their puritie, al ioyne  together in one, and the thing mixt, is made thicker: notwithſtanding that is compoſed and made of the moſt ſubtill and the pureſt partes. Therfor in naturall digeſtion and ſiething, whiche to melt the hardeſt thinges, hath alſo the force of fyre, and the ſtrength of ſoft and eaſye bath in extenuating and leſning the ſame: the more groſſe and maſſy partes on broken into peces, whiche can not be brought to pas with fyre.
            The heat of the firſt degree, whiche is moderate, as of hors dong, and Balneum Mariae, is called the heat of digeſtion, reſolution, putrefaction, maceration, and of circulation, wherof wee ſhall  ſpeake more in place conuenient.

               Brunſvvicke Suche cōmune things as ar put into a roſe ſtill, to be deſtilled, it is beſt not to put myche in at once, leaſt they that be nethermoſt be dryed away and burnt, thoſe that lie aboue remainyng  yet almoſt hoole, and as they were put in. And chiefly if thou deſtill any pretious or odorife rous thinges, it ſhalbe better to put in newe, the ofter, and ſo ſhall the water flow more plēteouſly.
            Suche herbes flowres and other plantes and growyng thinges, as ar to be deſtilled, ought to be gathered when they ar perfectly rype, chiefly whyle the mone encreaſith: when the wether is faire, and in the day tyme to be laide in y• ſhadow, to be cut, and if nede require, to be broſyd alſo, and  by and by to be deſtilled.
         
         
            
            ¶ Of the vertues of licores deſtilled generally.
            
               
                  MAnarde in his Epiſtles. 15. booke 15. chapter, ſaith thus: when I perceiued in the commun waters that ar deſtilled out of plantes by fyre, nether the ſmell nor the taſte remaine, but many times the contrary (for the water of wormwode I perceyued to be  ſweet, of Mint and Baſill, came water rather ſtinknyge then well ſmellyng: whereby I well perceiued that the water alone had not the ſame vertues that the hoole herbe had) I began carefully to muſe, and to conſult alſo with thoſe that of ſuche waters ar called communly chymici, by what deuiſe bothe the ſmell and the taſt might be preſerued in thies waters, that is founde in the hoole herbe. It were longe to wryte all the ways, whiche I proued to finde oute thies thinges: yet  one will I touche, whiche ſemeth to me to be the beſt and the eaſieſt waye. That is by the vapoure and ſmoke of hoat water, in a double veſſell. &amp;c.
            
               Syluius. Waters deſtilled, reteyne and kiepe ſtill the vertues of the ſimples wheroute they be drawne: ſauing that they ar more pure &amp; ſtronge, the oftener they be deſtilled, whiche wee proue in the water of wyne, for the moſt part, very ſeldome in other thinges.
            The vertues of licore deſtilled, ſome doo alter  and chaunge ether by ſmering the head of the ſtill

with ſome matter, as hony, Ladanum and ſuche like, or els by putting it in ye noſe of the ſtil, which ſerueth for the moſt parte, to the grace of the ſmel: for thei bind muſke, cloues, Caphura and ſuch like  in bundels, and put them in the top of the noſe, that the licore paſſing thorow thies matters, may get a ſwiet ſauour.
            A doubt. If ſo be it yt fyre maketh al thinges hoat and drye: all waters gotten by deſtillation, ought to be hoat and drye. Nether dothe the watery ſubſtance diſproue this, for when as brenning water is ſuche, it doth both bren and mightly make hoat and dry mens bodies. Again, al waters be colde and moyſte, as long as the ſubſtance hath the vpper hande. But nether of thies is alwayes true: yea, ſome of thies ar more lyke vnto  thoſe thinges wheroute they be taken, as roſe water, bothe in ſmel, taſt, and operation. A phiall of plantain water, is able to ſtaunche bloud, where ſo euer it runne forth. Water of Lettis can not doo the ſame, although it be muche colder. A certain man of late endeuouring to encreaſe his memory infuſed and ſteept balm for the ſpace of thre days in whyte wyne, then lightly wringing oute the wyne, deſtilled a water, by the drinking wherof, he thought to recouer his memory. But hauing a hoat liuer, had almoſt deſtroyed his health. And this maner is called of the philoſophers, to ſette Starres in the ſkye. 
            
            Therfor men be wont to axe whether theſe waters reteyne and kiep their owne propre vertues

and ſtrength. Wee once ſaide, whyles wee entreated of the euill maner of curing, that they are no ſtrengthes nor vertues, becauſe they are deſtitute of ſauour and taſte. For water of wormwode, nether ſmelleth like wormwode, nor is bitter yea that is more wonder, it is ſumwhat ſwiete. Yet burning water (to ſpeake nothing of Roſe water) well declareth that ther is a certaine vertue and efficacie in waters. For if you will ſay it is ſuche becauſe of fyre: how commeth it to pas that none  other water is like it? for this doth marueilouſly make hoate, dryeth, perceth, hath a ſharp ſmell, &amp; burneth. It is plain therfore now, that there is ſtrength and vertues in waters: but not in al waters, nor equall with that they be drawn oute of. for what things ſoeuer haue a thinne ſubſtaunce ioyned with colde, gyue a water not vnlyke to thē ſelues, as the Roſe. They that haue a thin and hoat ſubſtance, giue a lyke water, but burning withall, as wyne and certain metals. Suche as haue a groſſe and hoat ſubſtance, giue an vnlyke  water and an euill, as wormwod. Such as haue groſſe and colde, they giue vnlyke, but not euill, as the Gourde. According to this reaſon, ſuche ſtrengthes of waters as ar receiued with ſoft fyre ar eaſy to be learned. for ſuche as require a vehemenr fyre, doo all vehemently drye, &amp; for the moſt parte alſo, make hoate. This ſaith Cardan.
            
            But me thinkes thies thinges would be more diligently conſidered and weyed. Firſt, wher he  ſaieth that wormwode water is not bitter: it is

trew, if a man deſtill it negligently as the cōmun apothecaries ar wont, in leaden limbeckes. but deſtill it in Balneo Mariae, and ſee whether it ſhall lacke his ſmell and taſt, or no. Yea, it ſhall retain boeth, and that effectuouſly, not only this herbe, but alſo any other plant whatſoeuer it be, hauing any ſauoure or taſte: if it be dried and weikte or ſtiept in wyne a few dayes, then deſtilled in Balneo Mariae or by aſſhes gentely, as I ſhall ſhewe further within. Now when certain thinges haue  great plentie of their ſmel, and that ſo ſtrong that it vaniſheth not of a long ſpace, whiche cummeth bycauſe the force of ſmelling is digeſted equally into the hoole 
                  •
               ubſtance of them: it is no wonder, if in the ſame veſſelles ſome waters bee deſtilled lyke vnto their plantes, as of Roſes, whiche as Theophraſtus wryteth, doo reteine their ſauour very long: other ſum be vnlyke to their plantes. for ſuche waters as haue their vertue and force in the vttermoſt and ſuperficial partes, they fume  out eaſyly, as of wormwode, whoſe ſmell may be iudged to bee in the ſame place where his bitter taſte is conteined: whiche wee fynde to be only in the vtter and ſuperficiall parte. For if thou ſeparate the barke from the ſtalke or the braunches, thou ſhalt fynde that whiche is within to be vnſauery or vnſwiete. Therfor this difference is not to be required of the groſſenes or puritie of y• partes, although I thinke it alſo to be of ſome force: but rather of this, that the ſtrength of any thing  is ether diſtributed equally through ye hoole plāt,

or els more nie to the mideſt or vtter parte of the ſame. I am ſurely of that mynde with Raimunde Lullus, that water of the ſame qualitie may be goten oute of any plant whatſoeuer it bee, of colde plantes, colde water: of hoat, hoat: of dry, dry: &amp; of moyſt, moyſte. But I will not graunte that the ſame vertue remaineth, except lyke ſauour, or like taſte or bothe, (as in ſmelling thinges (be left.
            The cauſe why the ſmell of certain floures as of Iaſmin, of the floures of cloues, remaineth not  in the waters. &amp;c. reade within oute of Cardane, wher as we intreate of Balneū Mariae generallye.
            It were good if euery water once deſtilled, were powred again, yea or the thyrde tyme vpon his own dreggees beaten, and to be ſuffred to putrify two or thre dais, and ſo to be deſtilled again: or rather, not vpō his own dregges that remain, but vpon other like herbes of the ſame kynde, and to putrifie in a circulatory or a blynde limbeck, and to be deſtilled:  
               Brunſvvick 
                as I remēber me make mention therof. In certain, ye firſt deſtillation is ſufficient, as in Roſes.
            I ſawe once an alchymiſt, that deſtilled not the very herbes  them ſelues, but onely the iuſe of herbes or buſſhes,

renewing certain tymes the deſtillatiō, and powering again ye water vpon ye dregges groūde vpon a marble moler: Gnaynerius.
            
            Oates (wherof drinke may be made as Ale or Bear of barly) do warme &amp; make dronk no leſſe then wyne. Men ſay that in Tartaria, water of milke deſtilled maketh men dronke. But euery water, not an element (that is alone without any mixture) but lyquor or iuyce mixt and compounded, being oft deſtilled may doo the ſame: for it  wareth hoat, is fyned and made more pure, and receiueth more the force offyre. Wherupon burning water being oft deſtilled, is brought to ſuche ſharpnes that it can not bee dronke. Cardane.
            
            Alſo a lyquor or other thing be deſtilled, the thicker it is, the more it ſemeth to conceiue heate and fyre, if it be oft deſtilled.
            It is manifeſt (ſaith Cardane) that a water may be made whiche ſhall incōtenent breake the ſtone in the bladdar, if it be put in by a ſquirt or ſyring.  for whan as two thinges ar neceſſary, bothe that it breake the ſtone, and that it hurt not the bladdar, the maner and matier wil performe the firſt: for we ſhall receiue the laſt vapors of the aſſhes of ſcorpions, or of perſily of Macedonia, or of the precious ſtone called Tecolittius, or of the ſtones of crabes. for ſo may a water be made, to breake alſo the red marble. Moreouer, that it ſhall not hurt the bladder, is brought thus to pas, if the mattier out of which the water is taken be voyde  of all ſaltnes. A man muſt not take therfor water

of any ſalt kind of thing, or alum, or coperoos, or of wyne lies, but ſome of them that wee mēcioned erewhyle. But ther is nied of diligent triall, in cō
               firming a ſubtile meanes, that ſuch things which we haue ſerched oute ſo ſubtilly, being ſurely confirmed firſt by experience and profe, we may then deduce and bring them to the cōmoditie of man.
            In dede I know that pigeōs donge and paritary ether thone or thother, deſtilled by this meanes, is able too breake the hardeſt ſtoone that euer  was in any bladder. But what that is whiche ſhall doo it and withoute damage, a man muſte declare by experiēce. for both a hea goates bloud, and a hares ſkin, and glas, ar much approued by reaſon. Notwithſtanding no one of thies perauenture alone, but ſome of them toyned together, and in a certain quantitie. Suche a thing ſurely muſt be of metall, or at leaſt wyſe chaunged to ye nature of metall. I hard ouce that it was founde of a certain man of Ianua, but loſt again by his  death, who would make no man priuie to it, nor teache it to any man. But this once ſure, that it is poſſible to finde it, and that this is the arte and ſcience of the ſame. Hitherto Cardane. Perauenture alſo Chryſocolla would helpe vnto this art, being artificiuſly made, and withoute ſharpnes, ſuche as is alſo praiſed of the goldſmithes: wherfor to make Borace ſum vſe rain water deſtilled, and milke deſtilled, ſum alſo hony marow: &amp;c. I hard of late, a certain practicer cured the ſtone  of the bladdar in certain men, with Borace mixt

with burning water, to the thicknes almoſte of hony, mingling alſo Tartar, punned, or a ſtone cut out of a man or the groundes of piſſe out of a piſpot. He cōmaunded that a man ſhall vſe this medicine by the ſpace of fourtene dayes, ſo that he ſhould alwaye mixt ſome with his wyne when he dronk, yea bothe at diner and ſupper. I remēber I haue red of certain liquores, in which if a man put a ſtone or flint, it ſhould be reſolued. The Chymiſtes and deſtillers vſe deſtilled vinegar, and  deſtilled vrine to reſolue metalles.
            They diſſolue with ſtrong vinegar, chiefly deſtilled, or with the iuice of limons, perles, egge ſhelles, ſtones of the reines, of the bladder, bothe the coralles, and thei afterwarde dryed, ar quickly &amp; redily crōmed betwixt ones fingers. Siluius.
            
            I can not let pas here to ſpeake of the water of Epiphanius the practicionar, which is ſuch. Re. Antalis et dentalis, boracis, ſarcocollae whyt corall, whyte chryſtall, claye, aneſſede, rys, meel of orobꝰ 
                purſulan, of euery one half an ounce. Let them be made into trochiſcos (litle roules or balles) with water of beanes made with muſke. The vſe of it is for wemen to make their faces whyt and faire, but the face muſt bee perfumed afore with water of a decoction of barly &amp; oates: then let one baul be ſteept and cōſumed in bean water, and anoynt the face afore you goo to bed, but in the morning waſhe it away with water of a decoctiō of beanes and bran: and again with coold water. If the  bauls be made with water of limons they ſhal yet

more beautify the face: for limones roaſted and anoynted vpon the face, they alone doo beautify y• face. If a man drinke this water faſting and anoynt the place of his priuities wher hear groweth therwith, it breketh the ſtone: which is prouid by this, that if a man lay Porcellanas in it the ſpace of a night, the next daye he ſhall order them with his fingers lyke warmed wax (Porcellanas men call certain ſhelles, and alſo pretious earthen veſſels.)

Ther be ſome that ſtill troubled and pudly water, as though it were Roſe water. Other clarifie it putting ſome vynegar therin or els amilū
                or meel: for thies thinges go dounwarde, and drawe with them to the bottome of the veſſell, the groſe mattier of the water.
         
         
            ¶ Of Balneum Mariae generally, and of thoſe deſtillations that be done by vapors of hoat  water and in horſe dong.
            
               
               HOat water or els ye vapour of the ſame, ſend les ſtrength into the thing that is to be deſtilled, then other fyre alone or els ſuche other dry meanes as are mē
               cioned before. for yt cauſe as Galen ſaith Diploma, that is, a double veſſell (the Apothecaries as the men that ſtill lyquors alſo, cal it Balneum Mariae) melteth, heateth, ſeatheth thoſe thinges whoſe ſtrengthes the violence of fyre wil not diſpers nor ſeparate: ſo, ſuche thinges as be tender and gētle,  if we will haue them hoal, we muſt deſtill them in hoat water, or els in the vapour &amp; fume therof. Whiche although men thinck they be not ſo durable, they be yet les altered from their nature, as is manifeſt by their former ſmell.
            
            You muſt haue a fornace A of this ſor, vpon the whiche you ſhall ſet a great braſen veſſel B ful of water,  in that braſen veſſel ſet litle veſſels C in a circle as many as it wil receiue, in the botome, of the which veſſels the thinges that you will deſtill, muſt be put. Other builde ye fornace A otherwiſe as though it were a  toure, and in the ſydes thereof they put long earthen

veſſels: B in their broad bottoms ſtāding inward, they conteine the thinges that they will deſtill the mouth without as though it wer a bottell being couered, C in the which ye vapour caried vp by his open bely gathered together, and by the long mouth of the ſame droppeth down. Syluius.
            
            
            But why remayneth not the ſmell of certain floures in the waters but in Iaſmin, 
                and ye floures of Cariophillum, and le
                  •
               is, the water commeth forthe wtoute ſauour? the reaſon is declared otherwher: bycauſe yt vnto ſo ſclender and thinne ſubſtaunce, no ſubſtancial and thick parte is ioyned. Ther  for in thies it ſhall do well, if vnto the leaues of herbes voyde of ſmell being put by courſe vnto a thicker mattier, but not ſuche as wil burn, a ſmell be ioyned, and then deſtilled: and this is ye onely hope to get forth the ſmell, when as ſuche thinges as are infuſed and put in waters doo not giue again their ſmel, but putrify: Cardan. It appeareth without doubt that thoſe floures ſhoulde be deſtilled in Balneo Mariae, or in veſſels of glas  in the vapor of hoat water.
            
               
               Balneum Mariae may be hanſomly made hoate with a great pype of copper A ſet in the midſt, in the bottome wherof is a grate for ye 
               B aſhes to auoyde at: men call it communly a ſtowe harry. Vlſtadius nameth it a furnace of ſloth. Vpon that pype, do they make a couer of copper G wt a ſmall pype comming out a ſhore, to cary and conuey the ſmoke out at a window or ſome hoale. (So doo they alſo make warme houſe flors nowe a dayes to bathe in.) The cōmoditie of this pipe D is then  chiefly when a mā liſt to vſe many ſtillatories putting thē in a roūd circle E, a ten or twelue at once, to ſpare time, labour and coſt.
            
            Some vſe braſen cupping boxes to ſtill withall in the Balneo Mariae, &amp; glaſſen limbeckes, whoſe noſes if they bee to ſhort or broken, they ioyne other  to them of copper with clay.
            The herbes yt be to be deſtilled in a bathe or otherwiſe, ſome doo pun them, and let thē remaine ſo a whyle, (perauenture for certain dayes) befor they ſtill them, thinking to haue more plenty of water  therby: if they woulde doo it in cloſed veſſels, ſpecially

in a hoat place, it wer well: but the moſt apothecaries and other, that ſieke moſt for lucre &amp; gayne therby, leue it in cold places in open cofers, till the herbes loſe theyr ſmell, and bee corrupted with a moyſt and gros aire.
            Some there be that put ſome ſande alſo in the water of Balneum Mariae, to thintent the heat mai be the greater and more vehement: as Mathaeolꝰ of Sena in ye water that is called aqua philoſophica againſt the frenſh pocks. And he affirmeth that  in ſuch a kind of deſtillation there may be gotten a double water, the firſt, more thin and waterye, the other more read.
            The water of Balneum Mariae oughte to be no hoater, then that a man may ſuffer his finger in it: Brunſuicenſis.
            
            
               Vlſtadius preſcribeth the deſtillation of a certaine kinde of aqua vitae in Balneo Mariae, to be done with ſo ſlow a fire, that a man may tell one, two, three, vntil ſeauen, before a drop fall. 
            
            Of ſuch things as pertain to the commun wai of Balneum Mariae, you ſhall reade more with in where we make mention of aqua Camphorae out of Bulcaſis, and of Roſe water out of the ſame.
            This waye of deſtillation in Balneo Mariae, is vſed alſo to the rectifying (as they terme it) of oyles, to draw and purge the fleame from them, for only the waters and nothing els may be lifted vp and drawn out by the heat of the bath, the oyle remaining ſtil in the bottome. 
            
            When as I perceiued that waters, as they ar

accuſtomed commonly to be deſtilled out of plāts, they kiep nether their taſte nor the ſame ſmell: I began carefully to think apon the matter and to try many waies, yt I might finde a meanes how to preſerue and kiep in the waters the ſame qualities. It ſhold be lōg to reherſe al the wayes yt I proued. Onli one wil I touch, which ſemed to me to be the beſt and ye eaſyeſt. That is this, to work on this wiſe in a double veſſell, after the manner that Galen woulde all oyntmentes to he made,  but ſo that the bottom  of that veſſel A wherin the herbe is conteined B, do not touch the water C that boyleth in the bigger D, but that it wax hoat with nothinge els then the fuming moyſture lifted vp from the ſame.  for by the meanes of yt ſoft heate, vapors are drawn out of the hoal ſubſtance of the herb, which are turned into ſuch water that reteineth and kepeth the ſtrengths of euery part of the herbe, and that dothe manifeſtlye appeare, aſwell by the ſmel as by the taſte. This ſaith Manardus. Albeit things deſtilled in this wiſe, although thei  kiep more perfectly the ſtrengthes and qualities

of the plants (as the former ſmell, yet for aſmuche as they be corruptuous, they can not be long kept: Syluius.
            
            The chief vſe of dong, or as ſom term it, a hors belly, is ſuch: that the mater which is to be deſtilled in a glaſen veſſell ſet in the dong maye be prepared by the heat therof, as we ſhall declare more at large in his place, wher we ſhall make mentiō of putrifactiō and rotting. It is poſſible notwithſtanding for deſtillation to be brought to pas in y• 
                ſame, if ether pouerty or ani other impediment be that a man can not haue fire. Of this kinde of deſtillation ſee more within, wheras we entreate of the prepation, to deſtill. The heate of hors donge (becauſe of the lime that is mixt therwith) Brunſvvick ſuppoſeth to excede in the middle degree, the heat of Balneum Mariae.
            
            If you deſire to haue a water deſtilled of the fleſhe of any beaſt, you ſhall ſtrangle the beaſt, yt it bleed not in any wiſe, then take away al the fat  and ſhred the fleſhe in ſmall pieces, and ſo deſtill it in hors dōg (or with a ſoft fire) leaſt the waters ſtink, or ſauour of brentnes, which is wont eaſelye to chaunce: wherefore it is beſt to deſtill them twiſe. Brunſvvick.
            
            The parts of beaſt or excrements, as blud, the liuer, the lights, eggs, gall, and oxe dong, oughte to be deſtilled in hors dong, with veſſels not very cloſe ſtopt (but hony and milk a man may ſtop thē cloſe) leaſt the water ſtink. But if it chaunce to  ſtink euen thus ordred, then let it be deſtylled again

in Balneo Mariae, ſpecially the water of excre mēts of oxen whoſe firſt deſtillatiō is ſcarſe foūd without ſtench: Brunſvvick. It wold frame better if a man put to a litle curtſy of ſalt in the putrifying or deſtilling of dong, that they maye corrupte the leſſe.

                  ROos water ſemeth to be firſt inuented: for I finde mention of it in Auicen the .ii. boke, in the chapter of rooſes: Rooſewater drounke (ſaith he) is good in a  ſwoun, and the iuice of them alſo: and again, water of roſes is good for the liuer: and it cō
                  forteth the ſtomacke, which is nouriſhed of of it with hony, and it is Geleniabin, and helpeth to diſgeſt. And the roos and his iuice are good for a ſtomak to mich hoot. And although the Arabiās for the moſt part ar wont to ſay water for iuyce or  decoction: yet in this place it can not be taken for then, when as he ſpeaketh ſeuerally of the iuice, &amp; of the decoction alſo he made mētion befor.

               ❧ Of Rooſe vvater out of Bulcaſis.
            
            THe makynge of Rooſewater is known in moſte coūtires. It is better made with water then without: better alſo by fire of cooles then of  wood: wherfore of the iiii. waies whyche be withoute water wyth flaming woode: without water with coles: with water &amp; flaming wood: with water and fire of cooles: the firſt is the worſt, and yeildeth  a water of the leaſt ſmell: the ſecond is better then it: the third then the ſecond: but the fourth is beſt of all. The ſecond and the third are mooſte vſed. And I will here deſcribe thee third (whiche is made with water and woode flaming, as it is in vſe wt the kinges of Aharach. A. Thou ſhalt make therfore in a large houſe by a wall a litle berchile B ſo doth he cal the veſſel that is filled with water the bottom and ſides ſhalbe of leede, ſo wel cloſed, that it leek not in anye place. Then make meete a  couering vnto this veſſell of glas or glaſed earth,

and make two or three round hooles in it C C C moore or les, according to the largneſſe of the veſſels, and as you deſire to ether muche or little water D, then make a pot of bras like to the pot made in Balneo Mariae, which thou ſhalt ſet vpō the fornaice, ſo that the Berchile aboue the furnaice be lower in ſituacion then the potte, (ſo that it maye conduite the heate of the fyre of the Berchyle, to the pott: but mee thinkes thies woordes dooe ether redounde or be depraued.) Thou ſhalt alſo  make a chimney by the whiche the ſmooke maye auoyde hoolly out of the hous, that it hurt not the roſewater. Afterward fil a pot with water, which may be in a well (a great veſſell) made by the pot lyke a well in a bathe. Then kindling the fyre vnder the pot, thou ſhalt conuey the boyling water by a pype retching from the pot into the berchile, and fill the pot again of other could water oute of the well. In the berchile alſo ſhalt thou make a pype, by the whiche the water when it is full may  run out of the hous. Thou ſhalt ſet the cucurbites or belies (that is the ſtillatory veſſels) in the holes of the couering of the berchile, and ſhalt bynd thē rouling linnen clothes about, that they may ſtād ſtedfaſt in their hooles, and the vapour of the water go not out. Lykewyſe the heades of them ſhalt thou bynd with a linnen cloth. And let thies veſſels be of glas or of glaſed earth. Then put in the Roſes, and ſette vpon euery one his couer: and ſet vnder the noſe of euery one a phiall to receiue  the roſe water that runneth out: when the deſtillation

is finiſhed, put away the firſt rooſes, &amp; put in freſhe: thus ſaith Bulcaſis. Some man would maruell, that in ſuche a makinge of the fornace, where the fyre is not put vnder the duble veſſell or berchile (as I coniecture, ſeing he maketh the bottome and ſydes of leed) but at the ſyde of the fornace, wherfore he ſhould thinke it to ſkill anye thing, whether the fyre put vnder the pot be made of wood or cooles. Moorouer it is knowen (ſaith Bulcaſis in the ſame place) that roſewater of wyld  roſes whiche growe by their own accord without any watering, is ſwieter then that which is made of garden roſes whiche are tilled and watered.
            There is a deſtilled water made of thies with vs a ſhorter way then that before, is this wyſe.

if thou burne cooles, the water ſhalbe the ſwieter. (Here is more reaſon then in the former, becauſe the fire here is made immediatly vnder the ſtillatory veſſels.) The ſecond way of deſtillacion with out water with fire of coles is ſuch.

Ther is an other bridgemente of the third and fourthe waye.

               WHen men name a ſtillatory veſſell, they vnderſtand the bodye of the ſtill or the Cucurbita, which the dutch men in their language, becauſe of the faſhion of it, do cal clauam (ein kolben.) The body or groſe veſſell ſome cal the greater veſſel or Cucurbita wherin they put that whiche is to be deſtilled. Syluius for this veſſell compared to the limbeck or head, is  ſomwhat like vnto a body or a mans cheſt. The

               Arabians name it, as Bulcaſis 
                wytneſſeth, Beten Batan, that is a bellye. It appeareth alſo that Atanor in ye ſame Bulcaſis, where he preſcribeth the deſtillation of vinegar, ſignifieth a Cucurbita. (A furnaice, Athanor or a fixed inſtrumente Geber deſcribeth in his booke of fornaces. The Cucurbita ſome barbarouſly do call  
               bocciam a boxe. Of the ſame 
                  •
               igure and faſhyon the greater veſſels are meete to digeſt and putrify: therupon when they muſt be deſtilled, the matter digeſted is diſtributed into ſom les Cucurbit or boxes. The limbecke is taken, as I ſuppoſe, bothe for the bodye and for the heade, but moore properlye for the heade, as I ſaide, is the vpper veſſell, that hathe a certaine ſimilitude of the hed, in reſpecte of the nether, that is bigger and longar. The ſame veſſel (late authors call a bell and  a chaplet (ſome name it a marke or boundes, in y• which by the meanes of the ſpire the liquor is gathered by drops) other a cap: dutch mē 
               (ein helm) a ſalet or helmet. Tubus which cometh forth of the limbeck a length turning downward,  is called a noſe, a beake, &amp; ſimple as it is a pipe: becauſe the thorow the holownes therof, the drops gathered together in the limbeck, which all come together  in the ſkirte, that is in the nether

folde about the loweſt parte of the limbecke, running forth do drop downe into a veſſell ſet vnderneath, which commonly is called a receiuer and a vrinall. The noſe and beake are termed of y• lyke figure, becauſe this parte ſtandeth oute, after the ſame manner that beakes do oute of the noſes of fouls, &amp; noſes of .iiii. foted beaſts. The receiuing veſſel whē as oyles are deſtilled out of metals, as of Vitriol or Corporoos, wheras ther is nede of a great fire, and continuall, muſte be very large: for  els it is daunger leaſt they breake, for the aboundance of vapors gathered together in the veſſels. Men hold an opinion that more precious oyles &amp; waters are made in large heades, then in ſmall and more ſtraite.
            A blynd limbek is that which  hath no noſe nor beake, nor limbe or hembe whiche ſerueth for preparation and rectification or circulation, that is, perfection.  Of the ſame kinde, there is an other faſhiō wt a limbus, which we vſe when we will drawe out the fleame out of any waters or oyles in the ſunne or other place, as it ſhall be declared in oyle of vitrial.
            
            Suche heades as be put vpō 
                bodies not ſtandinge vpryght, but as though they were lying, they lack the limbe folded ſkirt, and be lyke to commune earthen  bottelles. Syluius.
            
            
               
I haue ſien alſo twoo  heads one vpon the other, that by the nether whiche was bored through, parte of the matter might bee caried into the vpper, whiche was ioyned to the nether with nayles, leaſt y• nether that is ſtopt with clay ſhold be taken awaye, when as  newe mattier is to be powred into the groſe veſſell or body. The ſame.
            Some times the faſhiō of the  head is like to a ſpyre aſcending vpwarde aloft, ſometime edged: ſometime it waxeth broode in the higheſt part of the head, that it may receyue the more of the vapours,  and gather the more water: but then for the moſte part it runneth againe out of the top into the groſe veſſell. Syluius.
            
            Sublimation is taken of many ſimpely for deſtillation: other take it particularly to lift vp or cauſe to aſcende vp into the limbeck by the force of fyre, the matter that is to befixed in it: as many metally thinges ar ſublimated. 
            
            
               
Some ioyne glaſſē 
                or earthen bottels together, whiche they call horned pypes, the one wherof is ſet and cemented or clayed in the fyre conteyning y• thinges to be deſtilled: the tother is a prety way diſtaunt from  the fier, receiuing the liquor gathered together in the neckes of them both: Syluius. Thies inſtruments are called cōmonly crooked: the frenchemen call them alſo horned.
            This horned pipe  is a muſicall inſtrument, which the Germaines cōmonly call  a ſack pype, Engliſhe men a bag pype. It is a crooked veſſell, apte to deſtill ſuche thinges as can not be made to aſcende hye, or go vp far.
            The receyuing veſſell for the moſte part is a phiall of glas wt 
                a longe neck, in whoſe mouth the noſe of the limbeck

is put, and ſome times the bely therof is ſet in a pot or ſome other holowe veſſell that it maye ſtande the ſtedfaſter in his place, or els for the cō

                tor of it: &amp; of the figure and faſhion as I ſuppoſe, a Pelecan. For lyke as paynters paynt a Pelecā pecking his owne breſt with his  bill: euē ſo this veſſel as though it were eared on both ſides, hath pypes that beginning at ye head, that is the vpper parte, deſcende in maner of a half a circle and ar bowed again and faſtened as it were into the beginning of the  bely: whiche maner of veſſell although it be hard to be gotten, &amp; deare, yet is it the beſt of all to circulation: but if it can not be had, we ſhall take a Cucurbita with a blynd limbeck without a folded ſkirt or els a veſſell of a hooll glas, that is ſomwhat ſtraiter in the midſt, and out of the beginning of the bely it hath looking out a ſhort pype, by the which liquor may be powred in and out. We ſhall put the fygures of both thies within in the chapter of quinteſſence:  and tertain other of other maner of veſſelles and

fornaces euery where in this worke.

               Of the matter for veſſels of deſtillacion: and firſt againſt leaden and braſen veſſels.
            
               WAters deſtilled in Balneo Mariae, do ſo far pas thoſe that are made ſimplye by the tire in leaden limbeckes, as golde  paſſethyron. For they that be made in

               Balneo Mariae, with large chaplets, limbeckes or heades, and ſomwhat great and of glas, do geue the natural ſauour and taſte of the herbes &amp; floures, wherout they be taken, without any noyſome ſmel of ſmoke or burning, which chaunceth not al in the common leaden ſtilles. For the waters that are made in them, very few and ſeldom, ſpeciallye whiles they be new, are without notable lothſomnes of ſmoke and burntnes, whiche vnto ſickmen that drincke, it is not only greuous, but alſo hurtfull:  for the euill qualitie of the lead endamageth bothe the ſtomake, and the breaſte, and all the entrailes, and likewiſe the qualitie of braſſe whyche the learned and excellent phiſitions perceiuynge, folowed the auncient men and vſed onlye decoctions. But waters deſtilled accordinglye as they ought to be, that is with the ſauour and taſt of his plant, are not only equall in ſtrength with decoctions, but alſo paſſe them in thys that they more delite a man, beinge more ſwete in taſte, and alſo  clearer to the ſight. It ſhal be houe both good phiſicions and alſo Apothecaries, to lay away leaden inſtrumentes, and prouid them the forſaid Balncum Mariae, and althoughe it ſhall be a little more chargeable vnto them and painefull, yet ſo ſhall they ſatiſfy and pleaſe bothe God and man. Matheolus.
            
            Such thinges as are deſtilled in lead, I iudge them altogether to be diſalowed, becauſe of ye Ceruſſe and other malicious qualities of the leade,  when as water alſo that is conueyed by pipes of

leade, Galen condemneth, becauſe it bredeth diſeaſes in the entrails. Syluius.
            
            Moreouer the veſſel altereth muche, aſwell in deſtillacions as in thynges ſodden. Wherefore a man muſt take great hied in theſe things, that the veſſels be rather earthen or glaſſe then of metall, and thoſe that be of earth, yt they be of a very pure earth, and wel baked, ſuch as be the earthen veſſels of Paris, Bellonaca, England and Spain. But glaſen veſſels are the beſt becauſe they be more  pure and thicker: but they be dearer &amp; will breake ſoner, except they be made hoat by litle and lyttle, and cold likewiſe, and after the ſame ſorte be alſo earthen veſſels, for the which cauſe they daube both ſorts of them by little and little with claye of wiſdom (as they call it) and dry them, ſo far as the force of the fire ſhall touch, yea althoughe it be to be ſet firſt in aſhes, ſande or dros of metals. For thoſe veſſels that ſhal ſtand in water or in the vavapour therof nede no ſuch defēce. The cauſe whi  I condemne veſſels of metals, leade, yron, braſſe, tin, ſiluer and gold, is Galens reaſon in euery one almoſt of theſe kindes of metals. For if he affirme that water onlye conueied in leaden pipes dothe brede diſeaſes of the bowels, howe muche more oughte we to feare waters deſtilled in a leaden limbecke or ſtill. Beſides that no ſmall ceruſſe remaineth cleauynge to the inner ſide of a leaden heade, as in deſtillinge of Vinegar is gathered, ſo by the force of the vehemente heate or brentneſſe  aſcendinge vp wyth a vapour manye times

            The beſt veſſels be of glaſſe: the nexte, earthen that be glaſed bothe wythin and wythoute: then limbeckes of tinne, the bodyes (in deſtillinge of Roſes) of leade. Thirdlye, the limbeckes and the bodyes alſo of leade. For the ſtrengthe of the fyre if it be moderate, it hurtes not the leade, but theſe bodyes of leade muſte bee ſette in ſyfted aſhes, a handfull thicke, not in ſande. Fourthlye limbeckes of copper tinned within. Fifthlye braſen. But copper and braſſe haue two diſcommodities,  but the braſſe more then the other, the fyrſte they make the waters for the mooſte parte, ſomewhat read, and fautye wyth brentneſſe: the other, there is euer a certaine venemous operation in them, more then in other metalles, therfore Chriſtophorus de Honeſtis, admoniſheth to take hede and auoyde them: Brunſvvick. Therfore ſeinge all the mooſte learned Phiſicions, and experyence it ſelfe, doe vtterlye diſalowe waters deſtylled in veſſels of leade, Braſſe and other vncleane mettals,  ſome good man ſhoulde do well to moue the

matter to the Magiſtrates, that it mighte not be lawfull for Apothecaries other to prepare anye more or ſell ſuch waters partlye hurtfull, partlye vnprofitable. Bulcaſis in dede, vſeth leaden bodies in deſtillinge of drye Roſes, whiche perauenture may be graunted for ſuch waters as ought to be vſed only wythout the body. Some find no faulte with veſſels made of pure and beſt yron, becauſe no euill qualitye (as they ſaye) can iſſue thereoute into the matter or liquor: and trouth it is, that certaine  metallye thynges as requyre to be deſtilled with a greate and continuall fyre, ſeme to haue neade of ſo ſtronge veſſels. But of this let other men iudge: I wil leaue the matter to Chymiſtes and deſtillers. Berchile. Bulcaſis dothe call a veſſel in a furnace for Roſe water, whiche receyueth the boylinge water deriued oute of an other ſtandynge by it, in the which veſſel, the body of the ſtil conteining the Roſes, is ſet.

Tothintēt we may the better kepe the ſmell and qualities of ſuche thinges as are deſtilled, we muſt cloſe diligently and ioyne together with  clay, the head with the body, &amp; the tipe of the noſe with the receiuer: they call it commonly claying.

For the deſtillation in aſhes, there nedes no ſuch mortering nor claying: albeit if a man wil prouide for the worſt conſidering the frailnes of the veſſels, ſpeciallye where manye veſſels are ſette together in one fornace, it ſhalbe ſufficient once or twiſe to pariet thē.

            Of the preparation for deſtillation.
            
            
               FOr as much as in deſtillaciō we ſeke ye ſeparation of the elemēts either for one or mo of them, or els to thintēt that they  once put cleane away, we maye get the quinteſſens: ſeparation truely can not be don withoute heate. For heat vniteth and gathereth together ſuche thinges as be of one kinde and nature, and they that do differ and diſagree it ſeparateth to thintent this might duely be broughte to paſſe, both the Chymiſts and Phiſicions haue inuented diuers meanes and waies. They terme thys preparacion diuerſly and geue it ſundrye names, digeſtion, leauening, putrifaction or rotening. Digeſtion they call it reſpectinge, the concoction that  is done in the maw, by the natural heate thereof, which bringeth to pas yt al ſuch things as are put into it: are turned into one humor: for it is well enough known yt they which ſpeake not very aptly nor latinly take theſe wordes to digeſt and to cō
               coct indifferently both in one ſence. If ſo be it a dri matter ioyned wt a liquor be ſo prepared, we ſhall name it wyth a more apte word, maceration, yt is ſteping or weking, or els infuſiō, a watring &amp; moi  ſtening. But leauening is proprely ſpoken wheras

a certain inward vertue, but increaſed or ſtyred vp by an outward heat, commeth vnto an humor or moiſture, ſo that a certaine cōmune and generall qualitie be mixed and ſpred throughout the h
                  •
               ole body, with a hoat ſpirit, &amp; one that moueth and breadeth bubles, as it is in ye mixture of true leauen in dede knodē with meale: alſo in vinegar powred vpon the earth. And this affect is the beginning of rotennes in ſuche thinges as haue ſuperfluous humor. That which is called putrifactiō 
                or rottēnes ſhould differ nothing frō this, ſauing that it is done by ſetting the veſſell conteining the thinges to be deſtylled, in ſome corrupting and rottenyng matter: and that for none other cauſe, then that one and the ſelfe ſame heate continually for a certayne dayes and equally, ſhould be conſerued with litle labour and coſte.
            The ſauour or other qualitie of ye putrifying matter, in my mynde, it is not poſſible it ſhould infect the mixture that is put in a glaſen cucurbita with  the mouth very diligently ſtopt, although ſome thinke yes. For if the veſſell be diligently ſtopt, it it is not poſſible there ſhould chaunce any defaul. Notwithſtanding it happeneth ſomtimes not becauſe of the dong or other outward cauſe, but bycauſe the matter in the veſſell hath abundaunce of corrupt excrementall moiſture, whiche with any outward heate doeth eaſely roat. The glaſen veſſell it ſelfe howe longe tyme ſo euer it ſhal tary in the donge, it wyll bee nothing defyled, nether  darkened, ſpecially if it be of good glas, as ye Venice

glaſſe is: for the common grene glaſſe will gather a certain duſkiſhnes and as it were a ſkin.
            Deſtillation that is done by rottennes, or with horſe dong both alone and with lime be ſprinkled and oft chaunged, or with barks watred, or other rottening thinges, how ſo euer it is profitable to the Chymiſtes and deſtillers many wayes, a phiſition not withſtanding ought not to receiue it, for a cauſe in rotten wod and euil ſmelling, thorowe the rottennes or ſome other cauſe: ſpeciallye if the  thinges deſtilled be to be miniſtred within the body: for to be vſed withoute the bodye, it ſkilleth the leſſe. Syluius.
            
            Of thys kind of deſtillation in hors dong read before in the latter ende of thoſe thinges whyche we writ of Balneum Mariae generally. At thys preſent we ſhoulde entreat rather of rotening then of deſtillatiō. But becauſe of rotening alſo in hors donge ſemeth to be diſalowed, if deſtillacion in it be reproued, it is not altogether from our purpoſe  and others, that I haue declared my mynd of this matter in this place.
            Putrification or rotening in hors dong wt lime is otherwiſe done on thys wyſe, that the dong euery day or euery other daye or by longar diſtaunce, be ſprinkled with warme water: otherwiſe, without ſprinkling, when as the dung of it ſelf ſerueth to be hot inough. A pit or hole being digd in ſome corner of the houſe, they lai one courſe of hors dōg about a fote thick, that is thre handbread: then an  other cours of lime only one hand thicke, and ſo

for the by courſe. There is nede of thre burden for the moſt part of dong, as much as a porter is hable to cary.
            Some put the thynges that are to bee deſtylled (ſpeciallye ſuche as bee ſtiepte in wine) into a tin botel, and that they do ſet in vnſlaki lime cloſed, whiche they quenche at certaine times nowe a little and then a little, with raine water. Some mixte Oten ſtrawe wyth the hors donge, and ſprinkling it with hoat water, ſet in theyr veſſell,  and then couer it cleane wyth towe harde, wyth clothes or ſackclothe, in ſome parte of the houſe where colde can not come at it. Other in grape kernels in harueſt. Other in the broken peces of Oliues, that is, in the relickes of Oliues after they be preſt, the beſt waye of all other, as Cardanus teacheth. If a manne couet but a light heate, it ſhall be ſufficiente to putte it ſimplye in chopte ſtrawe. Certaine of the Germaines that lyue in ſtouffes that is hot houſes, the winter time, make  in them lowe fornaices. A. and in the vpperparte they ſet two or three glaſen pottes. C. vppon lytle yron barres and pariet and rubbe them ouer diligentlye with clay. In thies filled full of fine ſand or aſhes, bothe thynges maye be deſtilled whyche I woulde ſhoulde be tried, and alſo certaine lyquors may be rectified or prepared. &amp;c, and by this meanes a man ſhall ſaue bothe labour and coſte.
            Some to digeſt the matter which they will deſtill in the ſonne, prouide a holowe lokinge glaſſe. D. 
                for the ſame purpoſe, whiche retourne agayne the

beames. B. which thei  receiued: and directe them into the veſſell C. wherein the matter is conteined: for thys purpoſe (as I am informed) the fygure of a holowe parabolae ſhould be more apte and meete: a parabolae 
                is a deuiſion of a Geometrical figure, called conus. Reade Archimedes in hys Booke of burnnynge glaſſes.
            The ſame alſo may  be done very wel with balles of Criſtall. A▪

The only end of all theſe preparations is, that the liquor may be drawne out more eaſely, more aboundātly, and more  effectuouſly.
            
               
The time of this digeſtiō doth vary according to the matter, whiche the more maſſy it is, the longar time dothe it requyre: newe herbes nede the leſſe time, when they are ſtiept or weekt in wine or other liquor: for they be the tenderer, and if they ſhoulde be let ſtand long, they woulde haue a certaine hoarineſſe: the ſame dryed muſte ſtande a little longar: then the ſeedes: laſt of all the rotes: ſo that almoſte double time is neceſſarye for them that folow to yt which goeth afore them: as to new  herbes .iii. dayes: to dry, ſeuen: to ſedes and moſt parte of ſpices twelue or fourtene, to rootes eight and twenty, or leſſe if they be newe. There be certaine Phiſicions that bid let metals ſtande fortye dayes, the chymiſts and deſtillers of liquors yet longar. Thys is alſo to be conſidered, whether the thinges broſed are ſtraight wayes put in: for they nede much ſhorter tyme perauenture by the half, then thoſe that be put in hole. In goulding waters (as they call them) ſpices ſometimes hole  are wonte to be ſtiepte a fewe daies in wine, then taken out and broſed, to be poured in againe and to ſtand yet a few dayes.
            The putrification of herbes to be deſtilled in horſſe donge, is wonte to be done almoſte by the ſpace of .xiiii. daies, but in Balneo Mariae. ii. or .iii. naturall daies. Brunſvvick.
            
            Suche thinges require chiefly putrification, whoſe ſubſtance is ſomwhat dry, gros, thick: raw haue les nied which are contrary wyſe, and ar digeſted  and prepared by nature or the ſun.
            
               
Putrification is ſoner done in cloudy wheather then in fayre. Vlſtadius.
            
            To the moſte parte of thinges that are prepared in hors dong, ſome ſalt is caſt, as vnto beaſts bloud, to fleſh, to fyſhe: Guainerius.
            
            To digeſt, take a blynd lymbeck: if the matter be pure, as pure liquor, then take a veſſell for circulation, of whiche ſort the pelecan is the beſt: although it can ſkarſly be made, and not withoute great coſt. &amp;c. 
            
            But in digeſtion or putrification, the hoal veſſell would be hid with hors dong or with the refuſe of grapes. &amp;c. To circulation the halfe of the veſſell, or at the leaſt the third part, muſt loke out into the free and cold aire (as alſo to deſtillation.)

            Of the rectification of liquors

               WAters deſtilled in Balneo Mariae, ought to be ſet in the ſun and to bee rectified, namely in a glaſen veſſell, (the mouthe wherof let it be bound aboute and ſtopt with lether) full of the deſtilled water, ſo that the third part muſte be lefte empty. then ſet it in hoat ſand by the ſpace of forty daies, that all the fleme may be conſumed, the third part of the veſſel muſt  be hid in the ſande. Deſtilled waters of hot vertue,

poured firſt into wine or burning water, leaſt they ſhould hurt a man by the meanes of theyr ouer muche heat, let them ſtande for the ſpace of a monthe or more if the water be hotter, in moyſte ſand, in a cold place. Likewiſe the thirde parte of the veſſell hid in the ſand: or two parts of the veſſell (two third partes) let them be digd in the earth in ſome wine celler. Brunſvvick. Euery water if it be deſtilled again, ſpecially vppon the dregs and grounds well pund and broken, it may ſo be rectified:  and the more, the ofter it is deſtilled againe: but for the moſt part of waters, it is ſufficiente to repete the deſtillation of them thriſe or .iiii. times. But you muſte take heede that at euerye time the fleame be diligently remoued and ſeparated, whiche a man ſhall do if he receiue by it ſelf the firſte liquor, or if burninge water be deſtilled, the laſte liquor, which is watry. &amp;c. The fleame once ſepated, laſt of all rectification by circulation (wherof is ſpoken now laſt of all, and more ſhalbe ſpoken  in the title of quinteſſens muſt be added.
            But ye the brentnes yt is in theſe, may brethe out it ſhalbe beſt to kepe opē a while the phials wherin the liquors ſtande: not withſtanding you muſte take hede that the grace of the ſmell in the meane ſeaſon &amp; with it much of the ſtrengthe and vertue therof, do fume oute. Syluius. Deſtilled liquors of diuers ſortes if a man mixte them together ſometimes they become troubled and pudled like thin milke or whay, and for the moſte part an olde lyquor  mixt with a new troubleth it. But you ſhall

make them cleare and pure againe, if into three poundes, you caſt ſix or eight drops of white vinegar very ſharp: for they wil driue down the pudly matter to the bottom: Brunſvvick.
            
         
         
            Deſtillacion by a Filter or a liſt of Wollen cloth.
            
            
               DEſtillation by a filter is more in vre wt 
                the Chymiſtes and deſtillers then wyth phiſicions, inuented to try out the lighter, purer and more ſubtil part from the groſſer and the dregges. Therefore the iuyces of herbes may thus be deſtilled, put in ſome veſſell, wherein a pece of wollen clothe muſte be put, the broder end wherof only muſt be in the veſſell: the narower part and that that is ſharpe at the ende: ether wt one poynt, or deuided into .ii. or, iii. muſte hāg without the veſſel, the veſſel muſt lean a litle  towarde that ſide that the liſt hangeth on. A man maye put in alſo aboute the brimme ſome lyſtes of clothe, euerye one of almooſte a foote longe, by the which the liquor ſhall be deriued and conueyed into a veſſell ſet vnderneathe. If you wyll deſtill the ſame iuyce or liquor agayne or the thirde tyme, in the ſame manner: ſette the veſſelles vypon a payre of ſtayres. The fyrſte wherein the liquor is higheſt, the ſeconde lower and ſo forthe, wyth liſtes of clothe putte in euerye veſſell  and hangynge oute into the nether, the laſte

the laſte veſſel onlye and loweſt ſhall haue no liſtes, whiche muſte onlye receiue, not yeld forthe. The deſtillation by a filter is doone alſo in two croked veſſels of glaſſe well clayed, the one wher of muſt ſtand higher then the other, when you wil draw precious and ſwiet ſmellinge liquors from the matter (digeſted firſte in Balneo Mariae,) as Vlſtadius maketh mencion. Chap. 56.

               Aqua vitae, and of the ſtrength therof, and manifold vſe.
            
               BVrnynge water or Aqua vitae is drawne oute of wine, but wyth vs out of the wine lies only, ſpeciallye of them that ſell it, and by this onli almoſt get their liuing. And parauenture it is neuer a whit ye worſe that it is drawne oute of lies: for Lullus teacheth  that it may be well deſtilled of corrupt wine: yea if

it be deſtilled often, it ſhalbe made the more effectuall, that is to ſay, hotter and drier: for dregs alſo or lies brente, are very hot, and geue the hotteſt oyle, which they call oyle de Tartaro, but that burning water that is deſtilled out of wine, me thinkes it ſhalbe the ſwieter, and more pleſaunt bothe in ſmell and taſte, and without all brent taſte: beſides that more apte alſo for quinteſſens. Burning water is called alſo water of ſapa, of whiche &amp; oyl, mingled together ſoope is made, for it brenneth ye 
                body. This water is made, as lie, half or thre partes aſhes, and on lime: and that is the ſtrongeſt water that wil make an egge caſt therin, to ſwim higheſt without or aboue the water. Therfore the firſt being ſo made, is ſtronger then the ſecond, to the vſe of ſearing or burning of woundes. Monachus in Meſuaem.
            
            Burning water oft deſtilled, is broughte into ſuch ſharpnes yt it can not be drunk. Cardan. But this is commonly known: they that ſell it commō
               ly  are wont to deſtil it only twiſe: but to the vſe of glaſiers for the burning in of their colors in their glaſſes, foure times, except I be deceiued. We declared afore, how when it is once or twiſe deſtilled in ſerpentins or writhen or crouked veſſels or in other accuſtomed veſſels (with pipes of braſſe as big as a mans arme) may afterward be perfected in aſhes, vntill all the ſteame be put awaye: by the which meanes it is made not only hoter and more ſubtil and finned, but alſo more pleaſaunte bothe  to the taſte and ſmell. Neither do all men vſe one

forme or faſhion of the bodies and heades whiche they call limbeckse, to deſtill all 
                  •
               uyces: for ſome draw the water out of wine put in a great braſen veſſel, ſtanding vpon the fire, the necke or mouthe wherof is great and broad, vpon a three fote, and vpon this necke ſtandeth the heade of braſſe alſo with a top like a ſpire ſteple, &amp; a thing like a paile or bucket. D. compaſſing it, ful of cold water, that the large vapoure maye be thickned the ſoner by the head made cold, and leaſt the water of ye wine  ſhould ſo reſemble the fire. Some vſe in the ſtead of a necke or heade to receiue the vapoure wyth a pipe of white plate or other mettall, verye longe, writhen into manye boughtes and tourninges, like vnto the maner of ſerpents, (wherupon they name them cōmonly ſerpentins) the greateſt part therof ſtanding in water. Some haue alſo yet an other faſhion, Syluius. We did ſee diuers faſhyons of veſſels ſet out in figures to deſtill burning water or aqua vitae, in Gualter Ryffius &amp; Andro Lo 
                
               nicerus. Bulcaſis ſaith wine may be deſtilled after the ſame maner, as vineger, the deſtillacion wher of he deſcribed. Read within, ſtreight after the title of deſtillacion in aſhes.
            Some make a longe rounde pype. A. goynge vprighte from the couer of the Caudron conteyning the wines or lyes, whyche pype is larger beneathe after the faſhion of a figure in Geometrye called conus whiche they bowe at the top almoſte wyth a ſtreight corner, and by a bucket ful of water  ſet ſomewhat hie, they directe it, but a ſyngle

not a crouked nor wri  then courſ: and ſo they ſay, ſhall a man haue more plenty of water. Suche lyke lyttle inſtrumentes certain apothecaries do make, and call theim bladdars, for thys purpoſe, that if they nede  anye certaine lyquor to the deſtillacion of anye herbe, they maye make it by and by. Yea they poure water vpon it that it be the more plenteous, which I cā not commend.
            
               Aqua vitae is thought then to be ſtilled inough, that is, after it be ſtilled foure tymes at the leaſte, and pourged from all his fleame, whan as if a  manne ſette it a fyre, it wyll conſume euery whit wyth the flame, that no token of moyſture be lefte in the bottome of the veſſell: or elſſe, if a lynnen clothe dipte therein, and ſette a fyre, it burne not the clothe, whyche is a greatter token of perfectyon, as that alſo, if a droppe of Oyle bee lette fall into it, it goeth to the bottome. For Oyle is aierye, wherefore a fyrie ſubſtaunce, whereunto Aqua vitae ſoo ofte deſtylled ſhoulde atteyne, oughte too bee lyghter  then it. But beſydes the heate, of ſo deſtylled

it ſhould alſo become thin and pure, more &amp; more, and when euery fire, the thicker and groſſer it is, the more it burneth: contrariwiſe, the thinner, the leſſe: that which is moſt thin ſhould burn leaſte of all. By the ſame cauſe it commeth to paſſe, that a drop of Aqua vitae poured in the palme of a mans hand, the better it is, the ſoner it vaniſheth awaye and is conſumed. I heare that this is a laudable note of this water, if ſuccinum amber being ſet on fire and put to it into a ſpone do burn. Whan wine  (ſaith Vlſtadius. 10▪ chapter.) is deſtilled twyſe or thriſe, you ſhall cut a fine ſponge into pieces, ſo great, that on euery ſide they may touch the cucur bita or bodye within the vpper parte (that is in the inner circuit) the ſpōg muſt be tied in thre or four ſtringes hanging withoute, when you ſhall ſet on the limbeck, ſo that the ſponge can not fal into the bottome of the ſtill: let the ſponge be dipt in oyle oliue, and cruſhed out a little again, leaſt pexauenture the oyle ſhould fall into the pot or body of the  ſtil, and be mixt with the matter: then ſettinge the limbeck vpon it, ſhit it cloſe with wax as is aforeſaid, or with purified roſen. By this ſpong the ſpirits ſhalbe beſt deſtilled, and the fleame ſhall not paſſe through, becauſe of the oyle: &amp; by this menes ſhall a man do more with once deſtilling, then otherwiſe with thriſe. Notwithſtandinge the limbeck muſt be made withoute the gutter and circle within like to a blinde limbecke, but it muſte not lacke a noſe. Thus ſaith he. That whiche remayneth  of the lies and dregs deſtilled in the bottom,

y• mē of our time call it dead water: for it is vnſauery and ſtinking. Such, that is the ſtinking water, whether it be yeilden of lies onlye, or alſo of wine, I haue not tried.
            For the deſtillation of aqua vitae or burning water, a man muſte chuſe the beſt wine, blacke, red, or white. Black and old, yelds more plenty and alſo better water, then any other. The fire at y• firſt muſt be light and ſoft, &amp; after more vehemēt: but you muſt take hede in anye wiſe yt the wine ſethe  not. The water that is gotten theroute, is ſurnamed burning, or the ſoul and life of the wine: and when it is deſtilled twiſe or thriſe, then they cal it flaming water: Albertus as ſome alledge.
            Of fiue partes of lies, whē it is twiſe deſtilled I heare, one remaineth or ſomwhat les. Whan y• fleame is one cleane conſumed, nothing is loſt after in the deſtilling, but the hole is yeilded again. Of .iiii. meaſures of wine, for the moſte parte one meaſure of burnyng water is gathered in the firſt deſtillacion or there about according to the goodnes  of the wine. Then in the next deſtillacion for one meaſure, there commeth the halfe. In y• third, one part offiue is cōſumed. In y• fourth, as much is yelded as you put in, for the moſt part if the deſtillacion be done accordingly. Notwithſtanding if you continue deſtillinge, the water ſhall be the more perfect, in ſo much that at the ninth or tenth deſtillacion, it ſhal come out moſt perfect, But for as much as to the repeting of deſtillinge ſo ofte: a  man muſt beſtow both more time and more coſte,

for the moſt part we are content with the third or the fourthe deſtillacion, and call it perfecte. And ſurely it reſteth much in the inſtrument, that the water ſhould be perfected ſoner or ſlower. For the vapour is more deſtilled and perfected in the firſt deſtillacion in a ſerpentin (that is in a croked and bowed pipe) thē thriſe deſtilled by a ſtreight pipe. Note further that ther diuers waters may be gathered in the firſt deſtillacion, wherof the firſte is perfit, that is, that whiche burneth and is conſumed  with the fire, and a linnen cloth dipte therin and ſet on fire is not burnt. (You ſhall proue therfore nowe and then, and when the water ceaſeth burninge, looke what remaineth in the ſtill, you may caſt it away, as vnprofitable. The ſecond is a meane betwene good and bad.) The thirde is good for nothinge, ſaue that it cleareth the eyes and the face, if thriſe a day they be waſhte therin, morninge, noone and euening, but this vertue of the third water, perauenture is true, if the deſtillacion  be made with wine: but if it be with lies, as they be wonte with vs, it is not true. More ouer the ſtil muſt not be filled aboue .ii. parts, but that the third part may remaine emptye, and that the vapoures maye haue their ſcoupe and romthe. Hitherto Lullus.
            
         
         
            Of the ſtrengthes and vertues of Aqua vitae, in the boke of Arnold, De Villa noua, which is written 
                of Aqua vitae.
            
               
               ARnold in his boke of Aqua vitae deſcribeth many qualities therof both of it alone, and alſo mixt with other medicins after the deſtillacion, obſeruing the order of the .xii. ſignes, from the head to the fete, for as he ſaith, a man muſt miniſter much more effectuall remedies to the head, if a man haue nede, at ſuch time as the mone is in the ram: and likewiſe in the other, which thinge how true I iudge it, I wil not ſay at this time: notwithſtanding this wil  I ſay, the better learned any man is in oure time, the les credit haue they geuen to ſuche perſwacions as the Arabians haue broughte into phiſicke. Aqua vitae ſimple and alone (ſaithe Arnold oute of one Theoricus I can not tel whome) breaketh an impoſtume or recours of matter bothe within the body, if it be dronke, and without, as botche, if it be annoynted therwith. It helpeth read and duſkiſh eies. It ſtauncheth the running and watering of the eies. It is good for them that haue the falling ſickns if they drink it. It cureth the palſy  if they be anoynted therwith. It ſharpneth yewit it reſtoreth memori. It maketh mē mery &amp; preſerueth youth. It putteth awai fracins, ring worms &amp; al ſpots of ye face. If it gargild it remedieth y• diſeas in ye throte called ſynanchen y• ſquince, &amp; the iuila faln down wt humors, alſo the ſalt fleme, the roſe drop &amp; the touth ache. It is merueylous profitable for frētik mē &amp; ſuch as be melācholy. It erpelleth poyſō, The ſmel therof burnt, killeth flies  &amp; cold creping beaſts, It doth ſieth fleſh &amp; kepeth

fiſhes from roating. It reſtoreth wine that is turned or putrified. It draweth forth the vertues of herbes and rotes, if they be laid in it .iiii. daies (otherwiſe .iiii. houres) excepte onlye the Violet. It oughte to be ſet vp in a glaſen or ſiluer veſſell and to be wel ſtopt. There is more of it &amp; better made of old wine pure and read. This he. He that deſyreth more concerninge the vertues of Aqua vitae, let him read that which we write aboue of ye vertues of certain liquors, which our men call goldē,  and waters of vertues. For they aſcribe all thoſe powers for the moſt part as well to Aqua vitae, as to the other, ſpecially to ſimple Aqua vitae, &amp; much more to compound or Aqua compoſita, but chieflye to the quinteſſens therof. Reade more ouer Lullus in the boke of waters. I haue ſene alſo a certaine broken worke aſcrtbed to Albertus, of the vertues of Aqua vitae. But practicioners, ignorant of thinges and times, or els of a purpoſe to deceiue mē, as many as they could, haue moſt impudently fathered  many things vpon Galen, Hippocrates and Ariſtotle of the vertues of Aqua vitae, or burnynge water, as writen by them. All kinde of cold paſſions or greues, that be curable, it helpeth in ſhorte ſpace, ſpecially diſeaſes of the brain, ſinewes and ioyntes. Alſo wormes in the bellye, biles and all ſcabbines, if it be waſht oft therwith, it healeth it. It helpeth ye ſplene, it killeth all wormes. It mē
               deth a ſtinking breth. It taketh awaye the diſeaſe of the loines. The hurt members if they be anoynted  therewith, it will reſtore them to their former

health. It preſerueth fiſhe and fleſh from corrupting, but before they be eaten, they muſt be waſhte with common water. Camphora put into it, will diſſolue. If cōmon water be poured into it, it goeth to the bottom: and likewiſe oyle. This writeth Albertus as ſome alledge.
            The taſte of it excedeth all other taſtes, and the ſmel all other ſmelles. Lullus, It comforteth the natural heat more then any other remeadye: it is moſt holſom for the ſtomake, the harte and the liuer:  it noryſheth blud, it agreeth meruelouſly and moſt with mans nature, it openeth and purgeth ye mouthes and entrances of the membres, vaines and poores of the body euery one, it auoydeth all obſtructions and comforteth them. Yea it chaungeth the aſſections of the minde, it taketh awaye ſadnes and penſiuenes, it maketh men meri, witty and encreaſeth audacitie. Lullus. Anoynte the head therwith and it helpeth it of the head ache: it killeth the wormes drunken faſting: it putteth away  ſowning: it healeth the biles in the priuy mē
               bers, if they be waſht therwith: it eaſeth them that be diſeaſed in the ſtomacke, it ſtauncheth all runninges: it preſerueth bodies from corruptinge by wormes: It auoydeth and kepeth a man frō gray heares. It is not permitted to women with child. It redreſſeth the fleame and reume of the hed. It encreaſeth the ability of accompanying with voemen. It is good againſt thick hearing, poured into the eares. Mixt with wine and drōk, it healeth  the falling ſicknes. If a man hold it longe, it taketh

away diuers kinde of touth ache. It putteth away the blemiſhes and whit ſpots in the eies, if it be poured into them: and auoydeth the running and watering of the ſame, if a man do but hold it in his mouth. It letteth the leproſy a ſpace and hideth it It helpeth rotten and materinge biles, if linnen cloutes be dipt therin and laid vpon them. With a little decoction of parcely, it driueth away the ſtones in the bladder. It maketh womē apt to conceiue, but anoyeth them that be greate wyth  childe. It cureth diuers greues, it is profitable to be laid vpon broken bones hot, with towe or with ſome plaſter. It ſlaketh the cramp in the legs, if a man anoynt them therwith. He hath no name expreſt that ſheweth theſe qualities. But the moſt of them ſeme to be taken out of Lullus.

               Aqua vitae beſides other things is commodious and profitable for the ſtrangury and other diſeaſes of the bladder, for the tertian ague and quartain alſo which are ioyned wyth colde humors: againſt the diſeaſe called the Wulfe: againſte wormes: againſte the ſens or painefull fealinge of a mannes bodye lyke vnto biles. It furthereth and prouoketh wemens floures. It breaketh and putteth awaye the ſtone in the reins, and expelleth a  dead child without anye greate paine. The iſſues

of the bellye and fluxes, it helpeth, what ſo euer they be. They ſay, that Aqua vitae is perfite when often meaſures is made one, (whiche I ſuppoſe will come to paſſe in the thirde or fourthe deſtillacion). Annoynt the heade therewith, and it healeth wormes, the ſcuruineſſe and ſcabbes, puſculs and ſkailes. It putteth awaye the ſpottes in the face and other wher. Broken egges or egges that that lacke a ſhell, put them in Aqua vitae and it will ſieth them. It healpeth the numneſſe of a  mannes ſences called Apoplexia, ſwellings, ſteames, teneſmum or deſire to the ſtoole and wearyneſſe. It amendeth the morphew beinge drunken or annoynted theruppon. It maketh the ſkinne ſofte and pure. To conclude, it is good againſte the bitinge of a mad dog. It will heale any woūd excellentlye, if it be waſhte therewith, and ſo that no euill effect ſhall come therafter by the meanes of the ſame wound.
            I perceiuinge Aqua vitae to be hotte and to dry,  did ſometime mixte with it honye, whereby it was bothe ſwieter to dryncke and gentler profitable for the colde ſtomacke, ſpeciallye in wynter. Som mixt it with water made wt honye or rather with mede, called apomel

                  , which with vs cōmonly they make of hony cōbs. &amp;c. Som wet figs ther in &amp; ſet them on fire, then eat them hot. A mā may alſo mixt any ſirup therwith, one or other, according as ye diſeaſe ſhall requyre. To preſerue wine y• it be not troubled nor putrified, put to it the tēth  part of Aqua vitae. in dede ſulphur is far better for

the ſame purpoſe, but it bewrayeth the crafte and the ſmell there of. The ſame will alum do, but being bothe hurtfull, they are verye noyſome to the health. Cardane.
            
            If wine by the meanes of the ſauour of the veſſels or taſte of the grapes be corrupte and ſoured, poure Aqua vitae into it and it will reſtore it. The ſame purgeth hāging wine that is new: alſo wine that is putrified and ſoured alſo: for it conuertes vineger. To conclude it bringeth a good ſmel and  taſt alſo to any wine be it neuer ſo euel or corrupt and good wine alſo it makes it better, Albertus as ſome alledge. When the wine is to be drawen into an empty veſſel, moſt vſe to put in a ball of brimſton ſet a fyre: other vſe Aqua vitae, dipping towe therein.
            Wine that is made to haue anye taſte or ſmell, out of hand in a momente, is both a curious thing for rich men cheiffy, which wil aduaunt them of ye ſortes of wine: and alſo profitable. For the qualities  of diuers remedies may be communicated by this meanes with the wine. Herbes, ſedes, or ſpyces whatſoeuer they be, let them be poured into Aqua vitae for the ſpace of .xxiiii. houres for ſo the ſtrength of them ſhalbe drawen out. Then ye waters ſo affected and died, ſhall be mixt with a lyttle wine when ye wil drink. Arnoldus de v

            How that wine is made which they calcommō
               ly Hippocras, with Aqua vitae and certaine ſpices ſtiept therein, I will declare when I ſhall ſpeake  of wines.
            
               
Of the quinteſſens of wine I ſhall ſpeake within, in the title of quinteſſens.
            
         
         
            
               Of ſuch thinges as be deſtilled dry, put into any liquor.
            THe thinges that be dry can not be deſtilled, except they be ſtiept in ſome liquor. Of theis wil I write in this place. Of thoſe that whiles they be new, be ſtiept and wet in ſome liquor befor thei be deſtilled, I wil ſpeake hereafter amongſt waters  compoundes, in the beginning. Although the waters wherof we ſpeake, here may be counted among the compoundes. Dry thinges therfor firſt let them be broken and grounde: then let them be ſtiept in ſome liquor, wine, vineger, rain water or of the wel ſpring, and thoſe ether raw or deſtilled, (Vineger and wine are deſtilled for this purpoſe ſomtimes once, ſometimes ofter) or in ſome other deſtilled liquor. They maye be ſtiepte alſo in the iuyce of ſom herb or plant, and that likewiſe ether  rawe, orels (that is better) deſtilled, Aqua vitae rectified ſemeth to agre beſt to the ſtieping of ſpyces, except we wil auoyd to much heat, wherwith the thynges deſtilled in them myghte be infected withall, when the liquor is drawne awaye.
            Some ſtill Cinnamon beaten with ſpring water poured to it, as we ſhall ſhewe amongſte Oyles. Sedes alſo and other ſpices, wheroute oyle is taken, are ſtiept in ſome of the forſaid liquors. It is beſt according to my iudgement to deſtill all theſe  thinges, dry thinges I meane infuſed and poured

into anything in aſhes with a ſofte fire. Of waters of vertues or golden waters, that are wont to be made with ſaudge &amp; other ſmelling herbes &amp; ſpices, ſet in wine, I wil ſpeke within amongſt the cōpounded waters: &amp; of them that are put in burning water, emongſt the compoſed waters of life. It is to be conſidered alſo how long they ſtād to ſoke in wine: for new thinges, &amp; they yt be thin or opē not maſſy, nede les time thē dry, groſſe and thick, &amp; beaten things, thē hole: the rotes then the  ſedes &amp; ſpices: &amp; they againe les then the herbs. Read befor whē we gaue rules of ye preparacion of things to be deſtilled. The cōmon cuſtom is to deſtil thē almoſt only dry, ſet in wine firſt a fewe daies, as ſpices &amp; ſmelling herbes. But all other things alſo whoſe ſmel or taſt what maner ſo euer it be we wil haue kept in the liquor deſtilled, they are rightly deſtilled by ſoking in wine, as I taughte afore alſo, whereas I made mention of wormwod water, &amp; of the preſeruation of the vertues  of remedies in ye waters deſtilled. And ſurely in thoſe which when they are new &amp; abound wt much moiſture &amp; therfore haue ye les ſmel, as gentian, aſtrantia, ye flour deluce, y• beries of iuniper &amp; other: I wold more alow ye liquors of drithinges ſet in wine or other wher: but if ye thinges be thin or ſlendar, or of no ſauor, or ought to coul &amp; moiſtē they ſhould be deſtilled rather new. Sometimes the time of the yeare cauſeth a man to take dryethinges becauſe of the lacke or ſcarſity of freſh. 
            
            
               Gentian water. Take .iiii. pounds of the freſh

and new rotes or rather dry cut in ſmall peces, of great Gentian or white Gentian, (whoſe rotes are moſte fat, and beinge ſet in wine, they nether corrupte them ſelues nor ſuffer the wine to corrupt, as I haue tried my ſelf by the ſpace of theſe ii▪ yeres) ſet in a couple of great glaſſes in a ſtoufnie the fornace, or hang them if you wil, the glaſſes diligētly ſtopt, and put into them pure good wine, ſo much that the wine be .ii. fingers aboue thē: &amp; you ſhal euer put new wine vnto them ſtil,  til the rotes wil drinke no more, and ſo the wine being aboue it a two fingars, as I ſaide, let the glaſſes ſtand a moneth, and at length put thē into .ii. cucurbitas, ye wine and the rotes deſtributed together, &amp; deſtil them in Balneo Mariae, or els in aſhes with a ſoft fire.

            Iuniper beries alſo dry ſet in wine, geue a very good liquor &amp; ſwiet ſmellinge: but wormwode  (ſoked a few daies,) geueth a water very effectuall and moſt bitter, and the more if it be deſtilled in aſhes, which both waies I haue tried.

            Theſe thynges alſo ſookte in burnynge water (as I ſayde) do communicate theyr ſtrength wyth it: but I heare it is done muche moore effectuallye, if the thynges be beaten at the beginnynge and myxte wyth the lyes of wine redye  to bee deſtylled (for of theeſe rather then

of wine, the men of our country draw Aqua vitae.) So alſo did one teache me in counſell as a greate ſecreate, that Wormwode water and other maye be beſt made. I haue not tried it yet.
            Water of Roſes wyth drye Roſes is ſo made. Pour water to dry Roſes, not more thē is ſufficient to ſtiep them in: then put them from thence into glaſen cucurbitas or leaden, and deſtill them by little and little. This water ſhall be profitable in medicins, and alſo to garniſhing and trimming,  or to the ſmel. Ther was a certain man put to one pound of dry Roſes, ten poūd of water and deſtilled Roſe water indifferente good. But thys is not done ſaue when a man hathe not newe to make Roſe water of. Bulcaſis. If the Roſes whyche we call commonly incarnation Roſes, dried &amp; moyſtned with the vapor of hot water be deſtilled, they wil geue good Roſe water. Syluius.
            
            The water of the nux vomica or ſpueinge nut, or the iuice gotten out with fire, is like the water  in colour, not in ſmel or taſt: the chiefeſt remedy againſt poyſō, Cardanus in his ſecond buke de ſubtilitate. And a little after. If the poyſon newly taken remain yet in the ſtomake, the beſt kind of remedies be they that prouoke much to vomit ſtrōgly, milke, lie, oyle, the water of the ſpewing nut, I ſuppoſe he meaneth by the iuyce gotten out by the fire, nothinge els but the water deſtilled thereof. For he nameth water that is like it in colour, not in ſmel nor taſt, which agreeth with deſtilled waters.  But when as the ſpewing nut euery whit is

moſt hard and dry, it apeareth that his ſhel muſt be ſookt in ſome liquor as water, wine, vineger, Aqua vitae. I wold ſoke it rather in vineger, whiche by it ſelf reſiſteth poyſon, and is good to prouoke vomitting.
            Waters deſtilled of new and freſh plāts (ſaith Brunſvvick) ought to be preferred, whiche if they can not be had, ether for ſome other cauſe or becauſe they be brought out of ſtraunge countryes only dry, as ſpicknarde, lauander, ſtichae, ſcoenantum, 
                the hard time. &amp;c. Thou ſhalt deſtill oute of them dry in this manner. In the month of May euery yere before the ſunne riſe, when it hath not rained the hole night, &amp; the ſky is fair, thou ſhalt gather dew out of ſom medow ful of diuers kind of herbes and flours, no watery ground nor wet, nor in a holow place, but rather vpon ſome hil, if it be poſſible. Thou maiſt gather it thus, draw a fair linnen cloth ſprede abrode vpon the graſſe, til it haue dronken much of the dew, then wryng  it out into ſome veſſell: and draw it again and fill it, euer wringing it out againe til thou haue gathred inough. This dew thou ſhalt deſtil thriſe in Balneum Mariae, and rectifye it alſo in the ſunne, (that is in hot ſand, for the ſpace of: xl. daies) and kepe it a yere. Thē what time of the yere ſo euer thou lakſt liquor of dry herbes, do thus. Take as many herbs as thou liſt dried in the ſhadow (the leaues being taken away and kepte apart by thē ſelues) put them in a glaſſe, and pour vpon them  thriſe ſo much water of dewe: or at thre times, ſo

that firſt thou power on ſo much, that the herbes be ſufficiētly ouercouered with water: and againe twis ſo muche. Then ſet it in hors dung twoo or three daies, ſtill it, and putrifie it againe, ſo that it be thrys putrified and deſtilled by courſe in order. This water ſurely ſhalbe muche better, then if a man, as Bulcaſis wryteth, to one pound of dry roſes (or other herbes or floures) ſhall put ten poūd of common water and deſtill it by and by. A certaine cunning phiſicion wryteth that if water bee  deſtilled out of dry thinges after this forſaid maner, ſooke in dew, not thrys only deſtilled, but nyn tymes, it ſhalbe better water then if it were made of freſhe and newe thinges, whiche haue muche fleame in them. The ſame affirmeth that dew nyn times deſtilled doth drawe out the vertues out of the herbes that be put in it no les then aqua vitae. Hitherto Brunſvvick.
            
            And in the dew it ſelfe alſo there is a certaine medicinall vertue as Brunſvvick techeth in an other  place to be in the water therof deſtilled. In the falling ſicknes, if thou make a cake of meale knod with nighterly dew of ſaint Iohn, and bake it vnder the aſhes, then giue it to the ſicke to eate, thei ſay it wil make him hoal.

            Of quint eſſence of remedies.
            
            
               QVint eſſence they name to be, the chief and the heauenlieſt power or vertue in any plant, me  tall, beaſt, or in the partes therof, which by ye force

and puritie of the hoale ſubſtaunce, not by any elimentall or ſenſible qualitie (although it be not without qualities) conſerueth the good health of mans body, prolongeth a mans youthe, differeth age, and putteth away all maner of diſeaſes. Of this firſt of al mē writ Raimūdus Lullꝰ, although it wer vnknowen to al the phyſicians of his time, nether written of in any booke, nor tryed or gone aboute in any vſe. After him foloweth beſides other Iohannes de Rupe ſciſſa, (whome one certain  man thinkes he flouriſhed before Lullus, as I writ afore, I iudge they were both in one tyme) Hieronimus Brunſvvick, Philippus Vlſtadius, and perauenture a few other whiche writ ſumwhat of the ſame. Sum kind therof is ſimple, as yt moſte famous quint eſſence of wyne or Aqua vitae, of chelidony or ſelandyn, of mans bloud, of ſtrawberys, of Antimonii. &amp;c. Other ar cōpounde that is whē certain remedies ar put to ſum quint eſſence now perfited, yt it may draw out yt vertues of thē, wherunto  gold yt may be drunken, ought to be aſſribed.
            But here ſpringeth a doute, ſaith Cardane, whether a man may make ye water tēperat, which thei cal quint eſſence: It wilbe, as I ſhal proue, of the nature of the firmamēt, that is a moſt pure &amp; thin ſubſtance moueable, &amp; which by the mouing reteineth a temperat heat, &amp; very muche therof. This thefor is of power to cōſerue al ſtrengths, &amp; topro long life. For being moſt ſubtil, it mixith it ſelf wt the firſt moiſtur, pearcing the maſſy thinges, &amp; ſeparateth  the excremēts, which be cōteined therin.

And becauſe it hath much heat, it expelleth what ſoeuer is vncleane, and therfore reſtoreth the natural heat. For age is nothinge els then a leſſening and diminiſhing of natural heat, which is therfore diminiſhed, becauſe the mouinge is hindred: as I ſaide of fire: for there is like reaſon of this vnto that. Mouing is hindred, becauſe of ye aboundance of earthy matter, becauſe the earthe only hath very muche matter, and is deſtitute of all mouing. Therfore that water being of ſo tē
               perate  a heate, it ſhall nether vexe the hearte, nor noyſom to the liuer: wherfore this onlye can perform the things that we haue ſpoken. When burning water therfore or Aqua vitae reteininge hys purity and ſubtil matter: by the longe mocyon of circulaciō, hath put of and rid away his heat and ſharpnes of taſte and ſmell, it is becomed of the nature of the firmament: and then firſte of all it ſmelleth ſwiet and fragantly. For a fragrāt ſmel is nothing els then a ſharp ſmell when it is moderate.  Example of peper, whiche hathe no fragrante ſmell. &amp;c. Therefore Aqua vitae, if it come once to a temperatnes, the thinnes and purity remaining ſtil, it muſt nedes be made fragrāt and ſwiet ſmelling: and if it be once fragrant, it muſt neceſſarilye be turned into the nature of the fyrmament. There is alſo a water made of the fleſh tyrꝰ or an adder, that reſtoreth youthe: there is made olſo of Elleborus, which I ſawe at my fathers. But theſe vexe and vnquiet the body, and  make diſceitful image and likelines of youth: the

firmamentall water dothe it in dede, whiche reteineth long that which a man hathe and adourneth the ſame. But is the firmament more pure then the fire which is moſte hot▪ It is ſurelye ſo: for it is next vnto the heauen, and therfore moſt lighte. For by his circulacion it moderateth the heat cauſed in it by the ſtarres: and after ye ſame manner thys water, broughte to the moſte puritye by the heat of the fire, by mocion it ſelf is coled again and obteineth a temper. Wherefore bothe  this and the firmamente are as it were in a meane betwene mortal thinges and immortall. For hauing a place and temper, and alſo ſubſtāce next vnto the heauen, it can not be corrupte. But whiles it is conſtreined and driuen beneath, it is couled, and ſo after a lōg time it is corrupt. Ther fore it is in a meane betwixt mortal and immortal▪ (of which kind the Stoikes beleue mans ſoule to be.) Al this write Cardane.
            
            The vertue of euery thing reſteth in the quinteſſens 
                therof, hot, cold, moyſt, and dry. &amp;c, and the ſame operacion it hath, which it had afore in his mixture or with his mater, but much more ſwiftly, &amp; more merueilouſlye manye waies. After the deſtillacion vpon the lies certain times repeated, letting the water haue euer a new digeſtiō, eueri water ought alwaies to be circulated ſo longe in hors dōg or other wher, vntil it haue a moſt ſwit ſauor. For ſuch a fragrancy is required in euery quinteſſens. Somthings it is ſufficiēt to deſtil thē 
                once or twiſe, and then circulate them &amp; after a

few daies, if any part of the earth or lies remain in the botō of the circulating veſſel, to put it awai pouring it forth. The quinteſſens of wine wyll no more burn the mouth, nether is it burning wine any more, but more ſubtill, and is called heauen: wherunto we ſay his ſtarres is added, when as herbes of diuers qualities, and ſuch as be excellent againſte diuers ſickneſſes, are ſokte &amp; ſtiept therin, as we ſhall ſhewe hereafter in Aqua vitae compounded. To be ſolificate or made goldē, is  when we procure the vertue of the ſunne, that is, gold to be in it, as it is declared before, in the tretiſe of potable gold or gold that may be drounke. Theſe thinges for the moſt part are out of Lullus boke of quinteſſens.

and from taſte to taſte, and from nature to nature: and therfore the names therof are multiplied. Alſo Minois a philoſopher, if a man aſke (ſaieth he) why is it made rede before it receiued whyt: Anſwer, that it was twys made blacke, twys turnid into orrenge colour, and receiued twys red coloure. Seing nowe that it receiueth twys red coloure, as red wyne and mans bloud, that is to ſay, after the putrifaction and in the deſtillation: therefore the olde menne ſpeakinge by  ſimilitudes called it red wyne, mans bloud, &amp; dragons bloud, and ſuche lyke, &amp;c. A little after alſo he putteth thoſe ſignes and tokens of quinteſſence now perfit, whiche Io. de Rupeſciſſa doth: that is, that al men entring into the hous may be marnei louſly allured vnto it ſet in a corner of the hous: &amp; an other. that all birdes that perceine that ſwietnes of ſauoure, may flocke together vnto it ſet in the top of a toure: this is expounded allegorically, that by the toure, the fornace ſet in a corner of the  hous, may be vnderſtanded, in. the whiche fornace a glas cōteining the matter to be decocted is put: by them that enter in to this hous, and by the byrdes yt fly vnto it, maye be ſignified thoſe ſpirites and vapoures whiche by the vertue of heat are caried vpwarde and aſcende aloft by the neck of the veſſell or box: whiche when they are faſtened and aſcende no more, it is a token (ſaith he) that their watery moyſture is now finiſhed and the matter ſwietened, and the medicine ended. And in this  opinion Raſis alſo was. Thus ſaith he.

               ❧ Of the dravvyng out of the quint eſſence from wyne, out of Vlſtadius and Raymund Lullus.
            THou ſhalt take the beſt wyne thou canſt get, what colour ſoeuer it be, let it be wyny rather then ſwiet, deſtill it .iiii. tymes in a lembeck, ſo as commonly burning water is made. If ſo be it, it be ofter deſtilled, it ſhalbe the better. To knowe when it is ſufficiently deſtilled, you ſhal conſider,  if it be ſet on fire in any veſſell (of ſyluer or tyn) it will conſume hoally, ſo that no moyſture remain in the veſſell. When it is therfor prepared in this wyſe, let it be put into a pellicane, that is a veſſell with eares or handles on ether  ſyde one, whiche alſo ſome call the veſſell of Mercurius, by the hoal wherof in the top, the matter that is to be circulated, may be put in and out. And when the  veſſell is diligently claied, and cemented with ſtif claye, by the often going vp and downe, the water ſhalbee turned into true quint eſſence. Then the wyne ſo deſtilled as we haue ſaid, whan as it hath all the foure elemēts, yet by the oft mouing agitacton and going vp and downe, it paſſeth and is turned from corruptible into almoſt vncorruptible. If ſo be it that by the often aſcention and deſcention of deſtillation, the  groſſe from the ſubtill, the inpure from the pure

is ſeparated, how muche more doth it come to pas in a ſtill where it is toſſed vp &amp; downe a thouſand thouſand times. By this mouing therfore, it is to be ſuppoſed, that an elementall matier is turned in to a ſubſtance voyd of all elementes and a body incorruptible, ſo that this quint aſſence is of ſo muche the further from the corruption of a body that hath parte of the elementes in it, as the heauen it ſelfe is more vncorruptible thē the foure elemēts. But when this circulation is many times done,  at length let the hoal that is in the top be opened: whereas you ſhal know by the moſte precious and ſwiet ſmell, whether any part of the .iiii. elements remain, not conuerted yet in to quint eſſence. For if it be perfitly done, there will iſſue forth a moſte fragrant and pleaſant ſmell, ſo excellent that they that fele it, ſhal thinke them ſelue to be rapt from the earth into heauen, and to haue the fruicion of a certain heauenly ſauoure. This vapour if it chaunce to inſinuate it ſelfe into ſome cloſe place  of the hous, it ſhall ſo fill the hous full, that thou ſhalt thinke thou neuer felteſt any thinge more ſwete, more pleaſaunt or better ſmelling, a maruei lous thing to be ſpoken and almoſte incredible.
            If it be ſet in the top of a toure, it will allure all kynde of byrdes vnto it, that be there aboute. But if that excellent grace of ſauoure appeare not yet, then thou ſhalt ſhytte it cloſe againe in to the Pelecane, &amp; when it is diligētly clayed, fet it in again to the circulating deſtillation, vntill the perfit  
               quint eſſence it ſelfe appeare, or els as Raymundus
               
in his firſt boke the ſecond chapter, calles it quick Mercury. And it hath not only that moſte excellent ſauour and taſt, but alſo a certain vncorruptible nature to be occupied aboute other medicines.
            And ſurely it hath no brentnes in the mouth as aqua vitae, nether any moyſture or fleame, bycauſe all the earthy &amp; elementall matter is ſettled down to the bottome.
         
         
            
               Hovv qvint eſſence may be dravven 
                out more eaſely and with les coſt, for poore mens ſakes, out of the ſame.
            
            
               PVtt Horſſe dung A in great &amp; deepe veſſell B or in a pitte made for this purpoſe: and in midſt of the dunge ſet  the ſtill, C full vntill two third parts of the matter to be deſtilled, ſo that the third parte remaine withoute the dung empty, that the matter may aſcende &amp; deſcende, and ſo to bee turned into cleare water. But the dung muſt be renued once at the leaſt euery wieke. The ſame  may be done in the droſe of vynes that remaine

after they be preſt in the wine harueſt: or els in the dog daies with the ſunne. It is poſſible alſo to draw quinteſſens out of troubled, vnclean and corrupte wine, if it be not ſower or like Vineger: For we ſee euen of corrupt wine, if it grewe in a good place, althoughe it be troubled and of an ill taſte, yet verye good Aqua vitae maye be deſtylled therout.
            There is alſo an other waye to drawe it oute without fire and labor. Take Aqua vitae the beſt  you can finde: put it in a glaſſe  with a longe necke, in the toppe wherof muſt be a hole, why the oughte to be cloſed and ſtopped with waxe prepared accordingly (as Vlſtadius techeth after in the tēth chapter.) Then let it be turned vpſide downe, and with the neck let it be put into the dung, ſo the groſſer matter ſhall ſettle and lie in the bottome of the  ſtill, whiche when it ſhall be a longe time buryed in the dung, at length ſhalbe drawn out by it gē
               
               
                  •
               lely, in the form, as it is put in. Then ſhalt thou ſee the ſeparacion of the pure from the impure, &amp; the ſubtil from the groſſe: For all the groſer matter ſhalbe about the necke of the glaſſe. Therfore with a fine pen k
                  •
               ife, and a ſharp, thou ſhalt bore through the wax vnto the water, &amp; when the pen knife is drawne out, the groſſer matter ſhall run out which was ſetled in the necke. When thys is  cleane run oute vnto the ſubtil and pure matter,

that is, the very quinteſſente, ſtop the hoole wyth thy finger &amp; turn the glas vpright. So haſt thou quinteſſence, but les precious then thother afore. In like manner may burninge water be put in a glaſen veſſell, not turned, but buried vprighte in dunge for a certaine ſpace. After by ſtreinynge may you ſeparate the groſer mater which is ſetled to the bottome, from the pure that is aboue: but this is yet les precyus. Notwithſtanding it draweth out all the vertues of the herbes, and other  matters, wherefore it is not to be ſet lighte by. There maye alſo other wayes be inuented, but I commende wyth all my harte, vnto al men the firſte waye, as the beſt and moſt excellent: it is no great labour and light coſt, nether ſhal you repent your ſelf ether of the one or of thother: for you ſhall finde a treaſure wyth a greate gaine. Theſe writes Vlſtadius the .viii. chap.
            After thys he addeth the waye howe to drawe oute quinteſſence oute of newe wine, yet hot in the  veſſell in harueſt, whiche is done wythoute anye harme to the wine, whiche for ſhortnes ſake, and becauſe it is not touched of other authors (as far as I know▪ except perauenture of Lullus) I wil let it paſſe.

               A merueilous vvater that hathe a contrary operation to Aqua vitae which may be called cold quint eſſence.
            
            THe flours of ſamoncus elder, y• flours of hors houf, which groweth vppon waters hauing  great leues &amp; the flour of giluū
                (otherwiſe y• flour

of nenuphar, which I think to be true, and ſo doth Rogeriꝰ interpretate it) of ether of them a pound. Purſlan ſede, lettis ſede, of ether .iii. poūd, (other wiſe half a poūd) of the leaues of ſalonum nightſhade .ii. ſru (otherwiſe as muche of nighteſhade as of al thother.) Al theſe muſt be taken grene &amp; deſtilled .vii. times &amp; kept diep in ye erth in a glas. This water whē it waxeth hot in the ſun about midday, it wil make glaſſes, or thin wodden veſſels, the images or ſhel of egges to flie in the aire  (this place ſemeth to be corrupt &amp; depraued, or els the thing to be falſe.) If a cloth be wet in it &amp; caſt into ye fire, it wil lepe out of the fire without harm and what ſo euer is dipte in it, it will not ſuffer the heat of the fire. Nether ſhal that cloth be hurt by fire that is moyſtened in this water: If Aqua vitae be ſprinkled vpon it, &amp; then caſt it into ye fire, or ſet it on fire with a candle: it wil burne but not cōſume nor waſte, nether leue any ſign of burntnes in ye cloth. If ſo be it part of this water, when  the ſun ſhineth hot, be put in a diſhe or boule, and thrown into thair with a ſtrinkle, it will make a great cloude and thicke ſodenly, and mitigateth the heat of the ſunne for a great ſpace. It ſtauncheth the floures of wemen: it kepeth a man from ſweating: it ſtirreth vp the appetite: it putteth away the head ache, ſpeciallye that cometh of a hot cauſe, or by the heat of the ſunne. It vtterly ſtaū
               cheth and putteth awaye cleane the Canker. To conclude, it hath manye and great vertues: for it  is medicinable in hot cauſes, as Aqua vitae in cold

Wherfore the vſe therof is good in all agues as well hoat as burning agues: in all hoat diſeaſes, and grieues of the eyen and head, that cōmeth of heat: alſo againſte the irkeſumnes and lothſumnes of the ſtomack: for the diſeaſes called Lupus, and the fiſtula, and the pain of the ſyde, &amp; the heat of the priuy members through the act of generation, and all diſeaſes aboute thies priuy partes, what hot cauſes ſo euer thei cum of. And after the deliueraunce of wemen, it is very proffitable if a  cloth be dipt in it and laid vpon the wombe or mother, (the preuy place) and vpon the place where the grief is, if the grief be outward: if it be inward then take ſome of it and myniſter it by the way of a gliſter. If ther be any fault in the ſtomack, take of it morning and euening half an egge ſhell full▪ If a mans yard be ſore within, let therof be conueied in by a pype for that purpoſe. Againſt the obſtructions and ſtoppinges of the liuer &amp; ſplene and other diſeaſes of hoat cauſes, wette a linnen  cloth therin and lay it to the diſeaſed ſyde thrys a day: for it purgeth the bloud very greatly. but you muſt take good hede that the cloth that is moyſtened therwith roole not vpon the ſtomack, nor cum nye it.
            A certain water in Raymund Lullus booke of waters, ſemeth to be of the lyke operation, which he deſcribeth in this wyſe. A water compounded accordinge to the contrary of Aqua vitae: Take whyte Camphora, roſes, whyt pople and blacke,  lettis, cichory, porſulane, violets, Solanū
                or night

ſhade, maidenhear, cymbalaris, ſingrene, vermicularis, roſtrum porcinum, cardicellum. The leaues that be to be punned, let them be punned and deſtilled.
         
         
            
               Of the extracting and dravvyng forth of all the vertues of Chelidonia or ſelandine: by the whiche example, euery man of any vnderſtanding, may vſe to drawe out the vertues  alſo of other planetes.
            
               BY the quint eſſence of ſelandin, Ioan. Braſeſcus thinkes ſumwhat els to be allegorically vnderſtāded, as I declared before wher we entreated of quint eſſence generally.
            
               Chelidonia, Selādin (ſaith Vlſt.) hath innumerable vertues: and the quint eſſence therof, which we wil teache here to get out, goeth  to the making of potable gold or gold that may be drunck. Selandine when it is moſte rype, take it with the herbe, routes and floures, cut it ſmall &amp; beate it in a morter, then put it in a cucurbitam or body of a ſtill of earth glaſed: when the body is ful ſhit it cloſe, and clay it round aboute, then ſet it in now hors dung, for the ſpace of iii. weekes. After put it in a limbeck and deſtill it in Balneo Mariae, with a ſlow fyre, and the fleame ſhall auoyde out of it. Then ſhall you drawe out the dregges, and  when they are very fine ground vpon a marble

ſtone, put thē again in a cucurbita with a blynde lymbeck, and let them ſtand in Balneo Mariae a ſeuennight, or in hors dung mo daies. Afterwarde the matter by litle and litle being couled put on a noſed limbeck, and deſtill it in aſhes, according as in the .x. chap. of the ſeparation of oyle from the earth, we haue ſpoken: and there ſhall iſſue oute a clear water conteining in it ſelfe aire and water. Thou ſhalt ſeparate the water from the aire in a new cucurbita by Balneo Mariae, with an eaſy fire:  for the fleam ſhall aſcende and the oyle remayne, whiche thou ſhalt reſerue and kepe. Then ſhalt thou grynde the dregges agayne vpon a marble ſtone, and power .iiii. partes of the fleam to one of the dregges, mixt them, and incorporate thē, and let them ſtande in Balneo Mariae ſeuen days at the laſt thou halt deſtill thē in ſand with a great fire, and the fleame ſhall iſſue oute firſt, then a radiſhe water, or rather an oyle, whiche is the element of fyre, from the whiche thou ſhalte ſeparate the  fleame in Balneo Mariae, as is before ſayde. But the dregges that left, whiche conteyne nothinge els but earth, muſt bee vrged with a ſtronge fyre and brought vnto lyme, by the ſpace of ten daies. (that is in a fornace of calcination or reuerberation, or a very lyme kiln, as I haue taught in the tenth chap.) Then grynd them again vpon a marble ſtoone and ſooke them in the fleame, and lette them be deſtilled in a limbeck, vntill you ſee in the matter lyttle whyte ſtoones lyke ſalt. And  this ſalt muſt againe bee diſſolued with water,

out of whiche you haue deſtilled it, and after, you ſhall deſtill it again, and againe ſo ofte, vntill the earth chaunce and put away from it all vncleane and earthy colour, &amp; be brought to a very whyte (to the whytnes of wax) and ſo it ſhalbe rectified earth. The other elementes alſo ought to be rectified, ſo that euerye one bee deſtilled ſeuen tymes, powring euery time the fleam to the aire and fier, and after ſeparating them as is afore ſaid. When as thou wilt do this an eaſier way, diſſolue euery  elemēt with his own water by equall portiōs, &amp;c. whiche I let pas, bycauſe they are declared ſumwhat obſcurely. There is alſo an other way more ſubtill, to reduce euery element to his perfection or quinteſſence, but it muſt be preſuppoſed that euery element be firſt iuſtified. Then let it be put in a veſſel of circulation in hors dung or in Balneo Mariae. xxx. daies, and then deſtill it againe. So ſhall the very body as a gros matter be chaunged into ſpirite or moſte ſubtill and pure ſubſtance.  Sum do it with more eaſe, taking foure partes of earth, and one part of one of the foure elements whiche a man wil, and by digeſting, after the forſaid maner, and circulating .xxx. daies, they dooe chaunge any element into quinteſſence. The matter is iudged to be ſufficiētly circulated, whan the quinteſſence ſwimmeth aboue the other matter.
            Of the vertues of euery one of the liquors of Selandine. The element of the water is good for al the diſeaſes of the body, both hoat &amp; cold. It tempereth  alſo al the veines about the hart, and driueth

all ve nom from the hart: it cureth al the diſeaſes that chaunce vnto the lunges. It purgeth the bloud, and preſerueth a man from all corruption of the natural ſtrength and power. At once, it is good for all ſicke men in what diſeaſe ſo euer they be.
            The element of air, like vnto oyle, confirmeth and encreaſeth the ſtrength and beauty of yong perſons, if they vſe it ſometimes with meate, for it letteth the bloud frō corrupting by any menes.  It burneth vp, conſumeth and expelleth all ſalte fleame: it taketh away melancholy and all brentneſſe of cholor.
            The elemēt of fire, if ſo much as a wheat corn in quantity be mixt with the beſt wine ye can get and poured into a ſick mans mouthe, yea if he be half dead, it reſtoreth and refreſheth al the ſtrēgthes of the body: for it perceth vnto the hart, and maketh it warme: and expelleth all poyſons and moiſt ſuperfluities from the hart. Lullus with the  
               quint eſſence of wine mixeth a little drop of thys oyle, to reſtore thē that are about to die, and paſt al hope, in that within the .xx. part of an hour.
            Som draw out the quint eſſence frō 
               Selandine an other way and ſhorter. They cut Selandine together with the rote and flour in ſmal peces they wey it, &amp; pouring wel water vpon it, they ſethe it til it be brought to the ſame weighte. Then they pun it in a ſtone morter, and when the iuyce is ſtreined out through a linnen clothe and purged  from the dregges, they decoct and ſieth the reſttil

it be ad conſiſtenciam mell is as thick as hony. After, they put it in a cucurbita ſo that it be half full, &amp; by deſtillacion in Balneo Mariae, they gather ye water or fieme. Then tranſlating the veſſel into aſhes, they receiue the aiery oyl, wherupon when they ſe an other kind of oyl ſwim aboue (the fyre being encreſed) they ſet vnder an other receiuing veſſel, wherin the element of fire is gathered. Euery one of theſe liquors muſt be rectified, that it may be mete for the medicins of mans bodi, that  is, by the repetinge the deſtillacion .vii. times: of the water or fleme in Balneo Mariae, ſo yt at euery time the cucurbita be diligentlye waſhed, (made cleane) from the dregges which remaine, whiche ought to be mixt wt the element of thearth, which remaineth in the bottome of the cucurbita after ye deſtillation of ye fiery liquor. Likewiſe thou ſhalt rectify thair, deſtilling it in aſhes .vii. times, mixting the dregs with thearth. Afterward ye liquor of fire likewiſe. The earthy matter, in ſuch maner  as is ſaid afore in the other faſhion. To theſe thinges thus dreſſed, they attribute y• ſame vertues yt we reherſed afore, to euerye one of them: which it nedeth not to repete: onlye thoſe thinges wherin they differ, we wil rehers. The waterye liquor of Selandine putteth away al heats &amp; poiſons out of y• breſt. It is good for the ſtoppinges of the liuer and lunges: for it conſumeth ye ſuperfiuous humors &amp; fleme: Ty cōclude, it deliuereth a mā within the ſpace of .ix. daies, free frō all infirmities.  The aierye liquor ſuffereth no blacke

choler, no bitter, nor fleme in ye body to get ye moiſture. It encreſeth blud, &amp; deſtributeth it into all the partes of the body by his pearcing. Wherfore they that vſe this oyle, do let blud the ofter. If a mā be in ieoperdy 
                  •
               f loſing of an eie, let him drop in a drop or .ii. therof euerye daye by the ſpace of xxx. dais, &amp; it ſhal do him merueilus much good. The firye liquor is muche more effectuous then the watry or aiery, &amp; helpeth where they fayle. It conſerueth the youthe, it maketh age liuelye and  youthful, it refreſheth ye hart, &amp; being receiued wt water of a kind of whete, it is ſaide to be elipir of life. Moreouer ye earthy matter rectified by diſſoluciōs, coagulations &amp; ielyings: calinatiōs &amp; ſub til ſalt of ye erth, wherwith al metals may be turned into ſtone, &amp; al ſpirits may be fixed: hauynge radicable &amp; naturall moiſture. It noriſheth lepre mē. Of this ye aunciēt philoſophers made a ſtone which they called ye philoſophers ſtone. The maner to receiue y• for ſaid liquors within the bodi is  thus. Three drops of ye fire of Selādine, iii. ſponeful of roſewater, put to it a litle ſponeful of y• ſanguin air (y• is the liquor of the air) &amp; geue it to be drunken faſting, if the diſeaſe be hot, with wine: and if the man be paſt .xxiiii. yeres of age geue it him wt 
               Aqua vite. In hot agues it ought not to be taken in no wiſe. Al this writeth Vlſtadius.

Then ſhalt thou deſtill them in  a noſed limbeck in Balneo Mariae, encreaſyng the firſt fire to the third degre. Thē take the dregges out of the cucurbita, and grineding thē very ſmal poure the deſtilled water vpon them againe, and when they are putrified in dung again as before at the length thou ſhalt deſtil them, deminiſhing the fire by the half degre. Then grind the dregs again. &amp;c. as before, and when thou deſtilleſt thē again, deminiſhe and leſſon the fyre, yet alſo by ye halfe degre. The putrefaction alſo muſt alwaies  decreaſe by the half degre: that is to ſay, like as in

the ſecond digeſtion, it may be putrified by y• ſpace of one and twenty daies, in the third .xiiii. daies, in the fourth .viii. daies. When the fourth deſtillation is done, put it in a circulating veſſell (cloſe aboue and beneth and large, narowe  in the midſt, with a ſhort byl holow coming out of the vpper part of the nether bely, looking vpward) and let it be digeſted in dung or a bath with a fire  of the firſt degre, or els in y• ſun, or in the dros of grapes, by the ſpace of a moneth. The water ſhall be ſo muche the more precious, ye oftener it is deſtilled. And ſo haſt y• 
               quint eſſence: which not withſtanding ſhalbe the more effectual if thou ſhalt deſtil the water of the herbes, ſeedes, or routes: and poure it again vpon his owne dreges, then digeſt it by the ſpace of ſeuen daies, and afterwarde deſtill it by aſhes, the very ſame way as it is ſayd afore of ſelandin that euery element  may be had ſeuerally, and that rectified.

            HOwe quint eſſence is gotten out of mās bloud, egges, and fleſhe, reade Vlſtadi' the xiiii. chap. They put vnto them the tenth part of ſalt, wherwith they ar wel mingled, putrified and deſtilled and that four tymes,  by cours, firſt the one then the other: and at

length they are perfited by long circulation, vntil they come to the moſte ſwietnes of ſauoure, and pure fynnes of ſubſtance: Lullus alſo in his firſt booke the .iiii. chap. mencioneth of quint eſſence, but the printed bookes left out that, that ſalt muſt be added vnto it. It ſemeth that ſalt may ryghtly be added to the deſtilling of moyſte thinges, ſpecially thoſe that woulde eaſely corrupte, ſuche as chiefly the partes of beaſtes are.
            A moſte precious water of Albertus magnus, as  I found it in a certain wryten booke. Deſtill the bloud of a healthfull man, by a glas, as men dooe roſe water. With this, any diſeaſe of the body, if it be anoynted therewith, is made hoale, and all inwarde diſeaſes by the drinking thereof. A ſmall quantitie therof receiued, reſtoreth thē that haue loſt all their ſtrength: it cureth the palſey effectuouſly, and preſerueth the body from all ſicknes. Tobe ſhort it healeth all kyndes of diſeaſes. All be it I can nether allow the making of medicines  for men of mans bloud, whiche although reaſon and experience would moue vs vnto it, yet religiō ſemeth to forbid it, namely when there is ſo many other medicines. &amp;c. Nether yet do I lyke the preparation of this Albertus water, if it be his, when as he wylles it to be deſtylled only once and ſimpely. The compoſition that followeth hath more reaſon with it, whiche I founde alſo in the ſame written booke.
            Holy oyle or lyfe oyle (bycauſe it preſerueth  the lyfe of man) of Hevve Gordones, wherewith

he cured many mooſte greuous diſeaſes: Three pounde of read bloud of a helthfull man or helthfull men of .xxv. or thyrty yeare olde, Spermaceti, the mary of neet of ether a pounde: Lette them be deſtilled in a lymbeck well clayed and cloſed, and a water ſhall iſſue oute firſt whyte, the next pale, the thyrde yellowe, the fourth read, and ſumwhat thycke. An oyle ſo deſtylled, when the moone encreaſeth and decreaſeth, therefore they name it holy. If ſo be it then gyue a ſycke man that hath  looſt boeth all his ſtrengthe and ſpeeche, three dropes with a lyttle wyne, he ſhall bothe ſpeake by and by and be ſtronger. If a man euerye daye drynke a drop of this oyle with a ſponfull of wyn, he ſhall become luſty in mynde and ſtrong in body throughoute all his membres, and ſhall proroge and put of age very longe, and ſhall be hurt with no poyſon. It cureth alſo fiſtulas, old breaches and temporall byles, if they become ſumwhat drye before with the waſhyng of wyne.  Anoynt freſhe woundes therewith and it healeth them in three dayes. It cureth the fyges or blaines of the fundament without and within.
            It healeth diuers diſeaſes, the Leproſy, the Morphew, the Palſy and other, if a man faſtyng drynke a droppe of it with whyte wyne. Many boaſte muche of mannes bloud ſublimated, as a certayne man Bartholomevve de Montaguana, made at Padua, but ſurely he was ignoraunt howe to prepare it, whiche if thou wylt vſe, make  it on this wyſe.
            
               
Take the bloud of ſanguin yong mē vſing a good diet whyles it is newly letten, and let it ſtande a whyle, and put away the water that ſwymmeth aboue, thē with a litle ſalt punned chauf it a good and put it in a veſſell well cloſed and clayed, after ſet it in hors dung fortie daies. At the length deſtill it certaine tymes, euer powring the water againe vpon the dregs. At the laſt thou ſhalt haue a marueilous water, which being mixt with ſum zulapio (ielup as we call it) is wonderfull proffitable  to them that haue the hecticall feuer. It ſhal be ye better if after it be deſtilled you put it to ſtiep again in hors dung fortie daies. A man may alſo mixt other holſome medicines for the hectical perſones, together with the bloud. Gnaynerius.
            
            To draw out the foure elementes from mans bloud, read the booke of Ioh. Geniuetus called the friend of phyſicions. 4. 7.
            Of mans bloud deſtilled ſimpely, read Brunſvvick, in the duche booke of deſtillaciōs. He writeth  that this water, and the water of mans excrementes and ordure, if they be mixt together, will bryng to pas certain marueylous thinges. My hart riſeth againſt ſuche medicines and abhorreth them.
            
               Io. Braceſcus, is of this opinion that the olde wryters woulde ſignify allegorically ſome other thing, &amp; that of metall, when they ſpeake of mans bloud: as I recited before, wher I write of quint eſſence generally. Vlſtadius in the .x. chap. of his  booke called the Heauen of philoſophers, wher he

teacheth how quint eſſence of wine is made, euery element drawne out apart by him ſelf: And thys (ſayth he) which is deſtilled in the ſeuenth time, is called mannes bloude, whiche the deſtillers, chieflye ſearche, and it is verye ayre. This ſaithe he. In deede the liquor of the aire, whiche in the mooſte parte of deſtilled thinges is oylye, ſemeth to be called by the name of mans bloude, for as much as our bodye conſiſteth of foure humors as elements, wherof the blud is compared  to air, hot, moyſt, &amp; ſomwhat fat
                  •
               y &amp;c. But Ihon Braſeſcus, mans blud is a certain metally thing, ſo called of the color.
            For the extracting and drawinge out of quint eſſence from honi, which goeth to y• making of potable gold, read Vlſtadius the .xii. chap. and .xxii. whereas he preſcribeth alſo diuers waies to gather thre maner of waters, and reherſeth the vertues, wherof he ſpake nothinge in the .xii. chap. &amp; declared to get out only two diuers waters.

                  IHon Braſeſcꝰ in the dialog of Raimund and Demogorgon, when he had affyrmed that quint eſſence whiche is profitable to the preſeruacion and lengethening of mannes life, can not be had of anye other thing thē of metals only, he addeth at lēgth. When as accordinge to the opinion of the auncient philoſophers, euery metall after theyr ſimi

               itude,  vertue, name, coloure and proprietie are cō
               prehended

in euery metall, as it is plainly declared, in the boke of the expoſitiō of Gebrus bokes: therfore this our medicin alſo although it be extracted and drawn out of ſom one metal only, yet neuertheles it ſhall haue the vertue of al metals and plantes, and the vertue ouer the hole bodye of man to heale manye infirmities that be curable. Ioan de Rupeſciſſa ſpeking of our radical and naturall moiſture, and of quint eſſence vnder the name of Aqua vitae, wolde ſignify the ſame, for he  ſaith that burning water doth conteine in it ſelfe the good vertue of all metals, and that it is not the water of the vine, but of life, becauſe it geueth life vnto men. He that will knowe more of thys thing and more plainly, let him read the dialoge of the ſame Braſeſcus, wherein he expoundeth Gebrus.
            
         
         
            Of the dravving out of quint eſſence from Antimonia, lead, white lead out 
                
               of Vlſtadius.
            
               QVint eſſence of antimonio is thus made. Incorporate and mingle the pouder of antimonii moſt finely beaten, with moſt ſharpe vineger deſtilled, and let it ſtande til the vineger be tourned into a very red colour. Then driue the vinegar oute, and in a cleane veſſell put other deſtilled vinegar vppon the antimonium, and ſet ouer a little fyre till the vineger be colored▪ This ſhal you repete ſo ofte, till the vinegar will be colored  no more. So much of the vinegar as is colored,

thou ſhalt deſtill it in a limbecke in aſhes. Firſte the vineger it ſelfe will run oute, after thys thou ſhalt ſee a matter iſſue forthe of a thouſande couloures, and thys is that quint eſſence whyche is called of the Philoſophers. Philoſophers leade, and of ſome virgines milke (it differeth notwithſtandinge from it, whereof ſhall be ſpoken here after, ſaithe Vlſtadius) &amp; it is almoſte like bleſſed oyle in coloure. Put thys in a Pellican to be circulated for the ſpace of fortye dayes. It dryeth  vp woundes, and is profitable for all woundes in ſteade of Balme, for it cureth all woundes eaſelye and quicklye: it is merueilous good for all impoſtumes.
            Yea alſo quint eſſence is extracted and drawn oute of leade or white leade after the ſame manner as out of antimonio, pouringe deſtilled vineger vpon it, that the vineger be ouer it foure fyngers deepe: after let it be digeſted in dunge, as it is ſayde of quint eſſence of hearbes and floures.  Then let it be deſtilled and fyrſte ye ſhall ſee the vineger it ſelfe aſcende vp: after that a certaine liquor like to oyle. And thys alſo is called oyle of lead or quint eſſence of leade: and it hathe in it a certaine ſwietneſſe lyke▪ as the oyle of antimonii. It is good againſte all burnynges wyth fyre and hot water, as alſo againſte itches, as ringewormes and chollericke bladders.
            But a manne muſte noote, that the white lead oughte firſte to bee waſhed often with water  of Rooſes, dreiuynge it by a linnen clothe.

vntil none of the pouder of the white lead remain in it. Then whē it is dried, reſerue it to your vſe. So doth Bulcaſis &amp; Ioan of Sanct Amandus vpon the Andidotarie of Io. Meſuae, wil to be done.
            Of the drawing forth of quint eſſence out of diuers metals, as golde, ſiluer, lead tin, vitriol, or coproos, iron, coper, brimſton, read orpment, yalow ocker, antimonio and marcha

            Of diuers kindes of Aqua  vitae compoſed.
            
            VVAters of life compoſed are proprelye called, when as certaine medicins are ſtieped in the veri Aqua vitae and deſtilled together, improperly when as they are put to after &amp; not deſtilled together. Ther be alſo waters of vertue or golden (as they cal thē) when as the medicins ſtieptfirſt not in Aqua vitae but in wine, but of which we wil write hereafter:  &amp; certain of theſe haue many things commun wt
               
thoſe that we deſcribe here: ſauing that they are les vehement and les hoat and drye.
            Sum ſortes of aqua vitae are commaūded to be made ſimpely, putting the medicines into y• 
               aqua vitae: other into aqua vitae thrys or foure tymes deſtilled. Sum there bee alſo to whome a certaine tyme of infuſion or digeſtiō is preſcribed, as. xiiii daies. &amp;c. Sum are put in punned in the beginning▪ other hoal, and broken after a certain daies fermentacion and ſtieping. Sum are deſtilled on  ly once: other twys or thrys. And ſum only in Balneo Mariae: other in Balneo Mariae once ortwys &amp; thirdly in aſhes, as that which Vlſta. deſcribeth xlvi. chap. although there is nothing elles done but infuſiō in wyne. In the ſame authour .xliiii. chap. Aqua vitae is deſcribed to be deſtilled thrys, the firſt water wherof is called Bleſſed, the ſecōd Aqua vitae, the third, the mother of balm. Againe the deſtillatiō of certain is repeted twys or thrys, that the water firſt deſtilled, be always powred  again vpon his groundes or dregges, as Vlſtad. teacheth in the .xlix. and .lvi. chap. Alſo ſum are commaunded to be drawen out with a ſlow fyre in Balneo Mariae. Other in the ſame with a ſtrong fyre, as the the water deſcribed in Vlſtadius. xlvi. chap. Many tymes in the firſt deſtillacion, only freſhe herbes, and freſhe ſeedes are put with the aqua vitae: and dry ſwiet ſmelling thinges, ſpyces and other, alſo hony is added after to the water drawen out of the herbes or ſeedes, and then are  they deſtilled again: afterward amber, moſke and

               camphora put vnto it, thirdly, folding the limbeck euery fote with moyſt clothes with the whytes of egges and bran together. Reade Vlſtad. li. chap. and .lvi. Concerning the matter, none almoſte is compoſed without ſpices: vnto diuers alſo ſwiet ſmelling herbes are added: vnto ſome, bothe the flowers and the ſiedes, ſumtymes alſo other deſtilled waters: Alſo malmſey, hony, ſugar, figes. To conclude, vnto ſome hoale peces of golde: I ſuppoſe it to be added in vain except it be quēſhed  in the liquor. But all thies thinges ſhall appeare more plain by examples. Vlſtadius deſcribed .xiiii. kindes of aqua vitae compoſed, whiche we let pas becauſe of breuitie &amp; ſhortnes. We reade in Vlſta. the .liii. chap. of aqua vitae, with ſpices and hony, &amp;c to be deſtilled in Balneo Mariae, and an other lykewyſe, but without hony, the .liiii. chap.
            
               Vlſtadius deſcribeth a certain marueilous aqua vitae in the .lvi. chap. Firſt he bids to digeſt diuers freſhe and new medicines, in Balneo Mariae. xiii.  daies, in aqua vitae powred vnto them: then to bee deſtilled in aſhes with a ſlow fire. After he addeth ſpyces and other dry thinges: and bids digeſt thē xiiii. daies: and deſtill them again in Balneo Mariae. Afterward he added camphoram, rhabarb, ſafron, amber and moſch. If ſo be it (ſaith he) thou wilt haue the water yet better, put vnto it certain precious and coſtly powders or ſpyces of confections made of amber, made of moſen, made of precious ſtones. &amp;c. and a fewe ducates of the fyneſt  gold, with halfe a pounde of ſugar: and thou ſhalt

digeſt it three daies in warm water of Balneo Mariae, afterwarde deſtill it by a filtrum or liſt of wollen cloth in croked glaſes well clayed, ſo that the one glas ſtand higher then the other. And this (ſaith he) is the moſte excellent Aqua vitae amōgſt all other.
            An aqua vitae, whiche may be a remedy againſt the moſte part of diſeaſes, put roſemary, cinamō, geloflowers, ginger, and maces, and two or three peces of gold, (whiche will bee neuer a whit the  wors for being thus vſed) into aqua vitae, foure tymes deſtilled. Vſe this water .iiii. tymes deſtilled, morning and euenyng before ſlepee. It dryueth awaye dyuers kyndes of diſeaſes, and reſtoreth youthe.
            What aqua vitae can dooe, wherein roſemary is ſtieped, ſee hereafter where we make mencion of oyle of roſemary.
            Take three vnces of Dianthos made with ſugar, put it in three poundes of wyne, three dayes,  or in water of wyne, deſtilled once for olde men, (that is, that whiche cummeth furth firſt, not that whiche runneth laſt) moreouer lette it be deſtilled by a Filtrum. Sum deſtil it in a lymbeck, and keepe it vnto their vſe. Sum mixt the thyrd parte of Roſatae nouellae, that they may aſſwage the heat and dryth of the Dianthos.

Theſe thus gathered together, take the liquors of them deſtilled in Balneo Mariae accordinglye, and mingle them with the beſt old Elſeter wine, or rather wyth .iiii. poundes of Aqua vitae. vi. times deſtilled, put them in a ſtronge cucurbita of glaſſe, that wil hold .iiii. good ale quartes, which thou ſhalt claye well and let it ſtande in Balneo Mariae. iiii. daies. Afterwarde, then thou ſhalt  burne the hyacinctes, coralles, Pearles and mother

of perles into pouder, as men do lim, &amp; grind them vpon marble diligently, til thou canſt fele no roughnes in the pouder. Put thys pouder into ſome veſſell, and make it with Roſe water into a liquor, &amp; what ſo euer remaineth ſharp or rough, which is not mixt with the water, grinde it again, and waſh it the ſecond time. A man maye reſolue the coralles into water when they are once pund or ground, ſetting them in the iuice of Berberies, which way is better thē the other. After this beat  the rotes meanly, and likewiſe the ſedes of the iuniper and paeony the herbes thou ſhalt cut. Afterwarde put the herbes, rotes, and precious ſtones moyſtened and made liquid with the Roſe water, into a ſtrong glaſen cucurbita, that will holde ſixe great ale quartes, there about I ges .vi. Dutche mooſes to bee, which I thinck he meaneth by Mē
                  ſuras,) and pour vpon them the Aqua vitae whych is dygeſted wyth the deſtylled liquors in Balneo Mariae, and when the cucurbita is defended &amp; cloſed  round about with clay of wiſdom, put it into a pit digged in a moyſt place, as in ſom celler vnder thearth .ii. cubits diep, iiii. cubites or there aboute wide and lōg, which thou ſhalt fil with hors dūg and lime ſtrawed and laid by courſes, now one lai er of the one, now an other of the other, til it be .ii. fote aboue the pit. In the midſt hereof thou ſhalt let the cucurbita ſtand for a monthe, then take the dung away by little and litile: and the matter whiche it conteineth to be deſtilled, thou ſhalt deſtribute  it into .vi. les cucurbitas, and deſtil them,

in Balneo Mariae, with ſo ſlow a fire, that from the falling of one drop, til the falling of an other, thou maiſte tell one .ii. iii .iiii. till thou come at ten. For thou muſt in any wiſe, take hede that the bath be not to hot, whē the deſtillacion is once ended, ſtur the dregs that be left in euery one of the cucurbitas with a ſticke moderatlye, and poure the water that is drawne oute of them in againe, and deſtill them again with a ſlow fire as before. When this deſtillacion is once ended, pour out all the dregs,  and diſtribute the liquors, gathered in .vi. cucurbits, into .ii. cucurbits, of .iii. greate ale quartes a pece, and deſtill them in Balneo Marie gentlelye. So haſt thou a treaſure and an incomparable remedye againſte the peſtilence. The vſe thereof is bothe to preſerue, and alſo to cure prouokynge a ſweete after the drinking therof. So ſone as any manne perceiueth him ſelfe enfected with the peſtilence (ſo that it bee wythin xxiiii. houres that it enfecteth hym, for after that tyme there is no  hoope or verye lyttle of anye remeadye,) lette hym dryncke halfe an ounce of thys liquor, and lyinge vppon a bedde couered moderatelye wyth clothes, and tarye for ſweate: the chamber muſte be clooſe from any ayre entrynge in. Wythin an houre and a halfe or there aboute, the ſweat wyll begin: whyche a manne muſte ſuffer and abyde iii. houres at the leaſte, it ſhall be better if they ſleepe a lyttle more, or .iiii. houres, abſteyninge from dryncke all the whyle, and wypinge hys  face euerye foote wyth a lynnen clothe.
            
               
After remouing the clothes by litle and litle, and wiping the bodye, when the ſicke is riſen, let him eate ſodden Barlye, or a little meale of Oates broyled, mixte wyth Vineger and Roſe water or Vineger onlye, whiche ſhall be mixt alway with his meate alſo for the ſpace of a ſennyghte. For his drincke he ſhall take a decoction of Barlye with raiſons and Licoris, when it is wel couled, let hym dryncke as much thereof as he liſte. Let him abſtein from wine .iii. or .iiii. daies: after let  him put water to his wine. Therefore when he hathe taken meat after ſwet, let a newe bedde be prepared for the ſicke man, or ſuffer him if he be ſo diſpoſed, to tarye in a chamber, but wythoute aire, for the ſpace of .iii. or .iiii. daies. If ſo be it he perceiue yet anye inwarde heate by the menes of the ſweate, let him drincke the liquor deſtilled of coulinge thinges, as wilde Poppye, Mulberies, or Blacke beries, Endiue and Cikorye, the floures of ſambucus, Eldar, or Acetoſa. And if ſo  be it, while he ſweteth, the botch called authrax or bubo do riſe as it chaunceth often times, then thou ſhalt vſe theeſe medicines. Cut an Onyon on the one ſide, make it hollowe and put triacle into it, tormentil, Dictamni diligently broken and punde, in equall partes, and put the cappe that you cut of the Onyon on agayne, fold it in moyſt towe, then roaſte it vnder the aſhes by the ſpace of .vi. houres, then punne it in a morter, and wrynge it throughe a lynnen clothe, puttynge  Vinegar made wyth Rooſe water vnto it.
            
               
then lay the moyſt cloth to the place, and as oft as it dryeth, moyſten it again. If a man drinke, once a moneth, halfe an vnce of this liquor and ſweat vpon it, he ſhalbe preſerued. It is very good alſo, if a man hold a drop or twoo therof euery daye in his mouth in the morning.
            
               Vlſtadius in the .xlvi. chap. deſcribeth an other aqua vitae commended both for the peſtilence and for other diſeaſes.

                now deſcribed, (the deſcription wherof we let pas for briefnes ſake: a man may vſe good triacle in the place of it, or Mithridatū, or an other effectuall antidotum) and a pound of ſyrup of the barkes of citron, mixt them with fiue poundes of aqua vitae ſo oft deſtilled, till it cum to quint eſſence, and put  them in a cucurbita of glas as big againe as the thinges do occupy, (that is of .xiiii. poundes,) and when it is well clayed moue it moderatly &amp; ſoftly ſo long till the antidotus be holly reſolued &amp; mixt with the liquor. So let it ſtand a moneth, mouing and chafing it in lyke maner twys a wieke. The moneth being ended power out ſoftly by litle and litle the clere water whiche is aſcended aboue the antidotus whiche is ſattled in the bottom, into an other veſſell of glas, and reſeruith very well cloſed.  This liquor is ſo effectuall, whiche I haue

proued by innumerable tryales, that if halfe an vnce therof be dronken with wyne, or with any cō
               uenient water deſtilled, or els alone, it reſtoreth a man infected with the bytyng or ſtinging of any beaſt althoug he haue loſt both his voyce and his ſences, and calleth him again to the great wondering of all mem. For the moſte parte alſo the humors nowe infected are auoyded by vomite. The ſame vertue hath it againſt poyſons which a mā hath reciued in meats or drinkes. For ye ſtrength  of this liquor is ſo ſubtile and effectuall, that euen in a moment and furthwith it peerceth al the vaynes of the body. It healeth lykewyſe alſo other many and diuers diſeaſes as euery leerned phyſicion may conſider by him ſelf, chiefly it reſiſteth the peſtilence, both by preſeruing and alſo curing them that be infected. This wryteth Mattheolus.
            
            
               Aqua vitae for the diſeaſes of the colike. Take a great ale quart of aqua vitae rectified, put therein half an vnce of cinamon .ii. or .iii. nutmegges, cloues.  ii. ſcruples, all pund, and let them ſtande a hooll daye: when a water is deſtilled thereof in a limbeck of glas, giue the ſick man a ſponfull therof. Andro Furnerius.
            
            
               Aqua vitae deuiſed by George Alapide. Take cinamon cubebarum, ginger, nutmegges, cloues, galangal, of euery one an ounce, freſhe ſage .iiii. vnces, wyn that is ſublimated ſix tymes, made of the beſt of the wyne, not of the lyes, as muche in weyght as all the reſt, that is .x. vnces. Take ſo  muche euery day of this water deſtilled in a lymbeck,

as a filberd nut wyll holde. They ſaye that M. Gallus the phyſicion of the Emperour Charles vſed this, and liued. Cxxiiii. yeares.
            A moſte noble water of vertues, worthy to bee preferred before ſiluer and gold, out of a certaine wryten booke. Cloues, cinamon, maces, galāgal, zedoaria, bay beries, graynes of paradiſe, of euery one halfe an vnce. Peny royall, ſage, hyſſop, rue, betyny, ceri folii, camphorae, ſerpentine or dragons of euery one half an vnce: Inniper beries, fenell  ſede, percely ſede, the ſeede of aquilegiae, withy of the mountaynes, the flowers of coſti, the ſeede of apii of the herbe called paralyſis caſtorei, of euery one two drames. Deſtill all thies in wyne for the ſpace of .xiiii. dayes, then dreyn the wyn oute, and grynde the ſpyces, then mixed againe with wyne, and let them ſtande .viii. dayes: then deſtyll them, and at length caſt in a fewe ſage leaues freſhe.
            They aſſcribe the ſame vertues euery one vnto it whiche we mencioned before in waters of vertues,  and .xx. ſeuerall vertues or ther about ar aſſcribed to ſum one of them. The conſeruation of health, the reſtoring of youthe, and other, whiche alſo ar aſcribed for yt moſt part to ſimple aqua vitae
            
            A certain kynd of aqua vitae is commended in a certain booke wryten againſt the leper and peſtilence: in the compoſicion whereof Fumetetrae, the les netle, the leaues of bedegnar, let them bee ſtieped in wyne in Balneo Mariae, a moneth: then let them be deſtilled, caſting into them alſo a dram  of gold beaten to pouder.
            
               
Afterward put to deſtilled wyn decocted and ſodden with peper, that there may be equal porcions of both liquors, whiche ioyned together, and ſtieped eight dayes together in Balneo Mariae, muſt be deſtilled again. He willeth a ſponefull of this water to be drunke euery day for the ſpace of a moneth, and the leprous places to be anoynted therwith. They ſay it purgeth bloud &amp; diſſolueth the congeled bloud, and chaungeth the hoole temperature of the body: and if a mā may beleue it, it cureth  well nye all diſeaſes.
            An aqua vitae of a certain practicioner, cōpoſed after a ſingular and excellent preparation, for diuers diſeaſes. Take crow fote, iuae moſchatae, ſage, the tender crope of ebulus, betony, ſaint Iohns wurt, germander maioram, chamepityos, organy, peniroyal, hyſſop, rew, caryophyllatae, gentiā, roūd ariſtolochia, of euery one halfe a handful. Polypody, ſquinātum or ſchoenoanthū, ſpike, caſſiae ligneae, folii, of euery one a dram. halfe a dram of bay beries,  two drames of chamaemall. The kernelles of peeches, balhamitae, pimpernell, ſelandin, agrimony, of euery one two vnces. Roſemary an vnce. Dictamni, tormentil, ſcabioſus whyte, of euery one foure vnces: an vnce &amp; a halfe of the great burſied. Aniſſiede, fenel, ſerpyllum or ſauery, alkekengi, iumper beries, perſely, of euery one halfe an vnce. Sauin, creſſes, of ether halfe a handfull. Carui, cumin, water withy, of euery one half a dram. Cineris veſpertilionis, tamariſcus, the route of ye floure  deluce with ye flowers, of euery one halfe an vnce.

Make a pouder of all theſe, which ſhalbe deuided into .vi. partes, wherof thou ſhalt put one part in Aqua vitae thriſe deſtilled, and let it ſtand to ſower or to be ſeaſoned a naturall day, then deſtil it, afterward ſtiepe an other part of the pouder in this deſtilled water, and deſtil it likewiſe. And ſo forth euery one of the other partes when they are all ſtiepte, deſtill them likewiſe, and keepe the laſte liquor. Then take nutmegges, Mace, cardamonium, folium, cinnamon, zedoarie, of euerye one.  iii. ounces. Agallochu, Saunders white and red, of euerye one two ounces, one ounce of the bones of hartes, hartes, one ounce of olde Triacle: ginger, amomum, cubebe, and the graines of paradiſe, Galangal, peper, of euery one .iiii. ounces, one ounce or more of choſen Muſcke, at the leaſte not les then half an ounce. Pun all theſe and put them in the forſaide water .iii. daies, then deſtyll thē againe with a ſlow fire in Balneo Marie thriſe alwaies pouring the water drawn forthe vpon y• 
                dregs. At length ad vnto this liquor half a pinte of mooſte cleare oyle of Oliues, and as muche of the beſt honye clarified, and when they haue ſtanded quietlye, deſtill them as afore ſaide. This lyquor is good for the headache, fallinge ſickneſſe, frenſye, ſwindle or turnſicknes, duſkiſhnes of the ſight, lack of hearing, ſtuffing of the breſt, the diſeaſe of the hart, called cardiaca: alſo againſt poyſō gout of the hands or fete, gutta, arthrîtis. It purgeth blud, it taketh away al agues of cold cauſes:  it ſtrengtheneth the ſtomack. It cureth the col
                  •
               k,

the debility of holding the vrin, the obſtruction &amp; ſtopping of the ſplene and liuer, the ſwelling and watry dropſy and all diſeaſes bred of cold cauſes. To conclude it is a moſt choſen remedy for the cō
               ſeruacion of ye body. They geue men to drink ther of half a philberd full in a cup of pure white wine.
            An other. A pounde of clarified hony: halfe a pound of Aqua vitae, iii. ounces of ligni aloes. ii. vnces of gum Arabick, Nutmegs, Galengal, cubebae, cinnamon, maſtik, cloues, ſpicknard, muſk, of  euery one .iii. drams, ii. drams of amber: beat all theſe together, &amp; when they are mixt wyth ye moiſtures, deſtil thē. This water helpeth the ſtinking breth, maketh the tethe white: it cureth ye deafnes and tineā capitis: it healeth al woundes, if you dip a linnen cloth therin &amp; lay it vpon the wound. To cōclude it cōſerueth youth &amp; reuoketh ye beuty loſt.
            A water of great vertue in the palſy, whyche a certain frend let me haue the knowledge of, as a thing known by trials and profe. Cloues, galangall,  
               zedoaria, nutmegs, both kindes of pepper, iumper beries and bay beries, the bark of the Citrō and arantii, white ginger, ſage leaues, baſill, roſmary, maiorā, mint, peny royal, gentian, ye flours of ſambucus, red Roſes and white, ſpik, lignum aloes, cardamomum, cubebae, calamus aromaticꝰ, ſtichas Arabica, germander, chamaepytis, maces, Mercury, the ſede of mugwort or motherwort, carikes paſſulae, dates without the ſtones, almonds ſwiet and ſour, pinapples, of euery one a dram both the  kinds of camfrey, taſil, ben white &amp; red, of euerye

one .ii. drams, Scolopendra a dram &amp; a half, half a dram of Laureola, v. drās of whit hony .iii. poūds of triacle, ſuger, Mithridatum, of ether .iiii. vnces Six poūds of Aqua vitae deſtilled iiii. times. Let them be deſtilled in a double veſſell, with a ſlowe and continual fire, til the colour be chaunged, thē chaunge the receiuer, and do that thriſe.
         
         
            Tvvo compoſitions of Aqua vite oute of the boke of Raimundus Lullus,  
               of waters.
            
            
               IN the cōpoſed waters of life folowing, althoughe Raymundus do not expreſſe whether wine or burning water ought to be put to the medicins, that they mai be deſtilled together, yet we haue thoughte good to rehers them in this place, becauſe Raimundus ſeemeth vtterlye to wyll theſe medicines to be deſtilled in burning water, thē in wine, as one that  alloweth euery where the more perfect liquors &amp; the ofteſt deſtilled. Take the rotes of fenell, ruſci, maidenheare, ſperage, Rapes, parſellye, eryngii, mill of the ſunne, ſcariolae, of euerye one like much mixt them and deſtill them wyth a ſlowe fyre. (It appeareth that thys liquor is good to prouoke vrine, and againſt the ſtone.) An other.
            Take cloues, Nutmegs, maſtik, doronicum, zedoaria, galingal, long peper, ye bark of citron, ſage ſambucus that is elder (perauenture it ſhoulde be  
               ſamſuchus, that is Maioram) dill, ſpiknard. Wood

of Aloes, cubebe, cardamonuum, Lauendula, Mint Peniroyal, organy, calamus aromaticus, both kindes of ſticas, germander, chamepytis, of euerye one like much, and a litle muſke. Pun them and deſtil them. The vertues be all one wyth ſimple Aquavite, but farre more effectuall. Or the ſame that are attributed before to other waters of life compoſed of many medicines. Then foloweth a water compoſed of manye colde medicines, not in hys place (as it ſemeth) which I made mencion of before  in the colde quint eſſence. Afterward is placed a moſt perfect Aqua vite (as he calleth it, that is, becauſe it is compoſed of verye manye thinges, and that moſt hot.) Take Euphorbium, Serapinū, opopanax, pyretrum, Capers, ſquinanthum, ſpodium, bdellium, long peper, and white or blacke, cubebe, caſtoreum, zedoaria, of euery one equal portions, to the which thou ſhalt put good Maſtick, and a little Amber, Saffron, and of the bone of a hartes hart. Alſo take all the thinges aforſaide in  the compoſed waters, and let them be deſtilled with a ſlowe fire. For it is a merueilous water, &amp; the mother and chief of all medicines, whoſe vertues are merueilous and innumerable againſt al colde diſeaſes. It is made in this wiſe. &amp;c. he deſcribeth ſtreight way the maner of deſtilling biſerpentins (as they call them) he addeth alſo other thinges which all do agree with the ſimple Aqua vite, in ſo much that I ſuppoſe the boke to be corrupted by the fault of the Printer. 
            
         
         
            
            
               VVhat medicines be mixt vvith Aqua vitae, without any deſtillation, firſt within the body, then without.
            MAny times inſtrumentes, time or coſt faileth a man, that thoſe medicines, whoſe ſtrength he wold haue in his aqua vitae (as though it were by a certain metempſy choſin, y• is a tranſpoſinge of the ſoules or principal vertues) he can not mixt them with it by deſtilation, whiche onely waye is  the chief and beſt of al other to mixt thinges together, for both by diſgeſtiō, as though it were a preparation in a moderat heat, firſt one mixture is made, then in deſtillation twyſe as muche, firſt of the vapours by the leaſt and moſte pure partes of the ſpirites, then by dropes when they gather together into water: but circulatiō is it that bringeth a perfectnes and abſolutnes to all mixtures: and without doubt, no mixtur that men deuiſe or inuent, can more properly and ny imitate the naturall  mixture: whiche is plain by this argument taken of the ende and effect: for thinges prepared in this wyſe and mixed, do les corrupt then by any other meanes, and hauing gotten a certain moſte ſimple and moſte pure ſubſtaunce that they ſeme to the ſence, to be ſimple, and of an airy or a fytte ſubſtaunce, they attain vnto a certain incorruptiō as nye as may be. This is euidēt, loke how much any thyng ſhall haue the partes wherof it conſiſteth les exactly and throughly mixt, ſo muche the  nerer it is to corruption: whiche firſt and chiefly

in thoſe bodies that are called met
                     •
                  ora, that is thinges bred on hy in the firmamēt, moreouer in many other thinges mixed ether by nature or by arte, is eaſy to be vnderſtanded. But for ſo muche as in ſo diuers ſtates of men, ſum for one hinderaunce, ſum for an other, thei can not alwayes folow that whiche is beſt, if quint eſſence can not be made, at the leaſt the ſecond or the third, or as many as may be: let the deſtillacions be repeted with a ſlow fire. for any mixture is done better by litle  and litle, and ſlowly, then ſodenly and violently. And if a man can not deſtill together with the aqua vitae, the medicines whoſe ſtrengthe he deſyreth to mixt with it: yet at the leaſt wyſe let them be broken and ſtiept a whyle in it: for it draweth vnto it the vertues of all thinges that are put in it. There is a booke of Arnoldes de villa noua, or rather of Rogerius, whiche I haue written, wher in is declared particularly, to what diſeaſes and ſickneſſes, what medicines ought to be put to ſooke  into aqua vitae, for euery part of the body, which he doth attribute to the twelue ſignes of ye 
               zodiak.
            
            It is well knowen in many ages hitherto, that gentian is the beſt preſeruatiue againſt certaine moſte greuous diſeaſes and poyſons: but ſum vſe to power the pouder of the ſame with burning water, as muche more effectual, into the throotes of beaſtes, whome they knowe or thinke to be hurte with poyſon in their meet or drinke, or els by byting or ſtinging: and if gentian can not be gotten,  the burning water by it ſelfe. To the remedy of

certain ſickneſſes of man, ſpecially of the bulke or breſt apomeli may be put. for both certain men coūt it otherwiſe for dainty, to haue apomeli mixt with burning water, &amp; alſo a tooſt of breed mixt therwith, many take for a breekfaſt. A mā may alſo againſt diuers ſickneſſess, giue men to drinke the water of gentiā
                artificially deſtilled with wyn, mixt after with apomeli or ſwiet hypocras.
            Wormwood wyn moſt excellent, ſum make on this wyſe, they power to the leaues of wormwod,  ſpecially when it is dried, the beſt burning water and ſo much malmſey. Of this they take a little ſponefull and mixt with a litle draught of wyn, &amp; ſo giue it to drinke. So is it made by and by and effectually, and is long preſerued. I my ſelf gaue it once to drinke for the colick, and had good ſucces. The ſame meanes a man may vſe alſo in other as wel herbes as ſpices. &amp;c. For both the vertue is drawen out ſo in a ſhort ſpace and the drink is alſo the more pleſaunt, and beſides that it may  be kept long inough.
            Grien aqua vitae, Take Meliſſa called baulm, &amp; balſamita dried both in the ſhadowe, of the firſt .iii. vnces, of the other two vnces, put them into .iiii. poundes of aqua vitae deſtilled fowre tymes in Balneo Mariae eight daies: then vſe it, ether alone or mixting with it other kyndes of aqua vitae compoſed to comforte the ſtomake.
            The herbes muſt bee dried in the ſhade, that the colour may bee made grien and moſte beutifull.  For if a man dry them in the ſun, the water

ſhall proue darke as the iuice of any other herbe. Vlſtad. lvi. chap. A man may alſo dy it with other colours, whiche may encreaſe both the grace of ye coloure and the ſtrength of the medicin, as with ſaffron, with red or yallow parſnipes dried. Sum put to it in ſummer black ſower cheries, whereby alſo the taſt is made more pleſant, and the heet is les (perauenture moor) aſſwaged.
            Sum put into burning water, mint cut &amp; beaten, and ſet it in the ſun foure daies or fiue, then  ſighe it and ſet it in the ſun again. With this they wiet the tip of their noos, againſt corrupt and peſtilent ayre.
            
               ¶ Hereafter will I put the vſe of burning water, with other medicines without the body.
               Many mixt a litle burning water with hoot oynmentes, as Martiatum, Arragon, dialthaea, at ſuche tyme as they ſhould vſe them, and wil them ſo to be annoynted vpon the griefes. 
               
               A water that noryſheth and reſtoreth the heat of the brayn, wherewith the head is to be rubbed. Two vnces of aqua vite, Moſchocarium, Cloues maioram, cubebe, long peper, of euery one halfe a dram. When they are pound mixt them, and rub them vpon the head a certain ſpace. Sum put to it a ſcruple of euphorbium, Epiphanius a practicioner: other put to other ſmellinge and hoot things, as ſage ſix vncees: rew, ginger, graynes of paradys, cinnamum, flowers ot roſemary, the bark of  a citron of euery one half an vnce: an vnce of oyle

de bay: a dram of ſpik: a dram and a half of caſtoreum. And in a deſtilled liquor they hang moſch &amp; amber of ether of thē a graine. Thys they ſay is good to annoynt the hed, and alſo with the ſmell it putteth away the palſy, and apoplexia.
               A merueylous water of the ſame mannes, for the impoſtumes or botches of the priuye members. Three yolkes of egges hard roſted and cut ſmall, pun them in a morter, poure in to them ten ounces of Aqua vitae, wyth a ſcruple of Alam .ii.  drams of Camphora, and a halfe of ruſt, all pund together when they are ſtiept a while, ſtreine thē wyth ſtrength throughe a linnen cloth, wet a linnen cloth in this liquor and laye it vpon the ſwelling .iii. or .iiii. times a daye, thou ſhalt meruel at the working of it.
            
         
         
            A vvater to vvaſhe the partes taken with the Palſey.
            
            MYrrha, aloes, ladanum, right turpentin, caſtoreum, 
                of euery one .ii. drams: zedoria, Galangall, cubaebae, Nutmegs, long peper, pyretrum, of euery one .iii. drams. The little white Daſy with the red tops, iua, Arthritica, ſtichas, Arabica, ſage, Maioram, mint, penye royall, the les Centaurye, Rooſemarye, of enerye one halfe an ounce, when they are all punde, poure them into .xii. poundes of deſtilled Aqua vitae. iii. dayes. As I founde in a certaine wrytten booke: but perauenture there is 
               
to muche Aqua vitae. For to euery pounde thereof, vi. drams only (with a ſcruple perauenture) of the ſpecies are put.
            In the diſeaſe called the French pockes, ſomtimes the iawes and throte are eaten wyth euyll deſtillaciōs, whiche onles a man finde remeadye for, oftentimes the gargil is waſted, oftentymes the corruption paſſeth to the very bones. Therefore a man muſte purge them, and turne them aſide. &amp;c. There is a marueylous water made for  the ſame purpoſe. They deſtill Triacle in Aqua vitae and vineger in a limbeck a moſt cleare water iſſueth out of many vertues, but chiefly it helpeth where the ſtrength of the medicine oughte to be conducted ſōwhat diep, if therfore thou diſſolue in it bole armoniak or ſphragida, and touche the partes that be freten, thou ſhalt both kil the cauſe of that contagion, &amp; heale al the freting, Fracaſtorius, in his .iii. boke of contagions.
         
         
            Of deſtilled vvaters compoſed,  
               but wyth other, then wyth Aqua vitae.
            
               SVche waters as are deſtilled of two or mooe medicines mixte together, I call them compoſed. Of thys ſort ſome are vſed for medicine, ſome for ſmellinge, ſome are inuented for garniſhinge, trymmynge and deckynge. There be ſome that wyll 
               
do two of theſe or all. Notwithſtandinge we wyll referre euerye one to one kynde, that is, wherein it excelleth mooſte. Againe, of theim that be vſed in medicine, ſome are receyued into the bodye, other ſome are minyſtred onlye wythoute other ſome bothe wayes. We will make onlye two Chapters, for all thoughe ſome bee vſed bothe wayes, yet they are moore vſed other wythin and wythoute. Agayne, of them that bee receyued into the bodye, ſome are moore ſymple,  whyche wee ſhall fyrſte deſcrybe: ſecundarilye thoſe that bee compoſed of moe. Of the kyndes of Aqua vitae compoſed, where the ſpices are ſooked in pure and onlye Aqua vitae, we haue written ſeuerallye by them ſelues. Heare wyll we putte the other (as I ſayde,) and thoſe which they call waters of caponum, and one with certain medicines put into ſwines bloud.
            To be ſooked in wine and after to bee deſtylled, it ſeemeth to bee ordeined, chieflye for thoſe  hearbes and medicines, whyche haue little iuyce of them ſelues, as Sage, Betanye, Meliſſa called Baulme, Wormewode. &amp;c. whych more ouer by that meanes, do retaine more firmlye theyr owne ſauoure, the wine drawing it and drinking it vp, that it canne not diſperſed for the thinneſſe, we ſhall ſpeake heare of certayne thynges to bee ſtieped in wyne, but whyle they be newe, for wee haue entreated of .iiii. dry things ſtieped in wine other liquor, and ſo deſtylled. 
            
            Betany, commonly called betany, and in dutch

eerenbreyʒ, is ſtiept in wine a few daies, &amp; likewiſe meliſſa. They ſhall haue the ſame vertues &amp; ſtrengthes, but more effectually and more ſubtil, then the herbes by them ſelues alone.
            
               Meliſſa, that is citraria (ſaith Lullus) let it be put in wine to be deſtilled. Let a man drinke a ſponefull of this wine faſting. It ſharpneth the vnderſtanding and the wit, encreaſeth the memory. To a man that ſtutteth▪ lay a linnen cloth wet in thys wyne vppon hys tounge and he ſhall ſpeke right,  excepte he ſtut by nature. He that is ſycke of the palſey, let hym drincke it faſtinge wyth a litle triacle and he ſhall be cured perfectly. It cureth the ſtinkinge breath, and putteth away touth ache. Fleſhe or fyſhe layde therin corrupte not, and may be kepte as longe as a man will. Being put into turned wine, it reſtoreth it. It breaketh the ſtone It prouoketh vrine and wemens floures. It is good agaynſte the fretting of the guttes, and pain of the raynes. It oughte to be drounken agaynſt  kirnels vnder the chin, and a plaſter to be made of the hearbe. If it be drunken faſtinge, it breaketh all inwarde and hid impoſtumes. It healeth all ſtitches, whyche tende towarde the hart or ſides. It is repugnant againſt al kinds of worms with in the body. It taketh away all corruption of the body quick or dead. It healeth al that it toucheth, and preſerueth it in good health, &amp; in good quart▪ It cheareth the ſpirites, it is good for al the members and healeth the kyndes of colde droppes.  Aboue all thynges it comforteth the ſynnewes.

It is moſte profitable againſt ſcabbednes cumming of could. It ſharpeneth ye ſight of him that drinketh it. It taketh away duſkiſhnes, teares of and ſuperfluous humors of the eies. It is holſome for the breſt, profitable for cōcoction againſt euill humors that letteth it. Drunken with good wyne, it ſtireth the appetyt.

It  healeth the iawe bones. The ſmell of it killeth al gnates and wormes. It cureth the dropſy cumming of a coulde cauſe: and ſuperfluous choler with drinking and waſhyng. Al maner of woundes may be waſht well with it, and ſo they ſhal be preſerued from all putrifying. It healeth all kindes of agues, but moſte of all, quartaines. The drinking of this wyne letteth the diſeas of ſaint Lazarus from encreaſing. It is good alſo for them whoſe brain is periſhed, and for the frantik.  Alſo if a man eat a ſpider by chaunce, and drinke this wyne ſtregthway vpon it, he can not be hurt of the poyſon. Theis wryteth Lullus. Meliſſa beaten is ſtieptin wyne a night. Men ſay this water deſtilled and drunkē euery day and holden in the mouth, it cureth the benumming of the ſenſes: all ſo the falling ſicknes, the dropſy, the quartain ague, and other diuers diſeaſes of black choler or fleume.

            Take one part of gentian, two partes of cētory: when they are pund and ſookt in wyne fiue daies deſtill them. This water drunke morning and euening preſerueth the body from all kyndes of diſeaſes. It putteth away all impoſtumes: it maketh good colour: It reſiſteth the peſtilence, it heleth the ſick of the phthiſik, it auoydeth the ſtuffed ſtomack: it breaketh the ſtone in the reines, it ſeparateth and putteth away the watery humors of  the ſplene: it helpeth forwarde the flowers, if it be drunken nyne daies together in the morning, and purgeth the bely. Alſo it purgeth al choler and corrupt bloud. It heleth all woundes within the bely: it clereth the ſight: it cureth poyſoned bytings: to the healing of woundes, the pouder of centory alſo ought to be put vnto thē. Lulliꝰ in his boke of waters.

Whē it is ſoden with caſtorium, as oft as a mā drinkes it, ſo many daies it prolongeth his lyfe vntyll the tyme ordeyned of God. Nether is it poſſible for any man to be ſo greatly couled, but if he drinke it with caſtoriū

Drunken faſting, it remoueth the diſeaſe of the bely, &amp; all gutta, &amp; ſcabbidnes, it maketh good bloud &amp; the beſt colour in the face: It is profitable  to many other thinges drunk .iii. a day.

A man muſt put les wyne to new routes then to dry: and perauentur, les alſo to thē whiche ought to refrigerat and coule, or els moderatly to heat: wherfor we ſhall deſtill the ſame rather newe and freſhe, then dried, to thintent they may nede ye les wyne: or els if new can not be gotten, we ſhall ſtiep the dried rather in water, or in ſum other conuenient liquor, ſumtimes vynegar, ſpecially if it be to be vſed without the body.

When as notwithſtanding he bringes none other vertues then ſuche as be attributed to the medicines them ſelues alone, and that before deſtillacion, whiche if he had toucht with one word at the beginning, it had been ſufficient. And truly I maruell, ſeing he wryt forth his bookes with ſuche earneſtnes, and endeuoured by all meanes, to augment his  thinges vnto a huge greatnes, why he left out other many routes, yea rather why he reherſed not all that be in any vſe of phyſick, euery one with his vertues repeted: and that he did it not, I ſuppoſe he lackt no will, but remembraunce hinderd with haſt.
            The wyld radyſhe, whiche communly they call the byggar, cut ſmall and ſtiept in wyne a certain daies, I wold thinke it would giue an effectuall ſtilled liquor. for it wil loſe eaſely his byting tartnes  and leue it of in the liquors wherin it is ſtiept in ſo much that euen certain ſwiet routs as Parſnipes ſooked together with them in vinegar, becum more tart, &amp; the ſlices of Radiſh leue their tart

A profitable water againſte rottennes of the tethe. Mixte the rotes of Pyretrum beaten ſmall, with the beſt wine ye maye get, and make a mixture that may be like to Aqua vitae compoſed. Whē ye will vſe it, taſte a ſponefull (holde it in youre mouthe) in the morninge or whan ye will, for ye ſhall perceiue remeady ſhortly. It healeth weke tieth, corrupted, holow: it pourgeth alſo and cleareth them. It is good alſo for the putting awaye of all kind of rottennes or vnclennes, &amp; to auoyd  it by ſpitting: one nameles.
            A water againſt the falling ſicknes, whereof ii. or .iii. ſponefull oughte to be geuen in the verye fitte, communicated vnto me verye latelye of a frend.

            A water deſtilled of gum Arabeck, white tragacanthum, lycoris, violets, Malowes, put in water and then deſtilled. It repreſſeth the heate of the breſt, and correcteth the drines.
            A water of Plantaine, quinqueruia, Tormentill and Roofes, if it be drouncke wyth hote wine,  it cloſeth the woundes of the breſt of a hot cauſe, and altereth any hot diſtemperance.

               Of vvaters of vertues or golden waters and certain other compoſed of many medicines, deſtilled with wine.
            
               WAters of vertues, which the Germans name golden, all are deſtilled with ſpices and odoriferous herbes (ſpecially ſage, which ſemeth to be a foundacion in theſe waters compoſed) put firſt a fewe dayes into wine: &amp; they are in more vſe to bee miniſtred  without, then receiued within the body, ſpecially to the comforting of the ſpirites with their odour, and againſt the head aches. &amp;c.

            Waters of vertue. Guatlerius Ryffius in hys booke of deſtillacions, deſcribeth verye manye  with burnynge water compoſed, but verye fewe with ſpices and other medicines ſtieped in wine, whyche not with ſtandynge they ſeeme to be preferred, where the diſeaſes bee leſſe greuous, and the bodyes more drye, and ni

            And a manne maye in theeſe alſo gather foure kyndes of waters differynge in vertue, of the whych I would moſt chiefly allow the myddle. For thys is truthe, Aqua vitae commeth oute 
               
out more pure at the beginning of the deſtillaciō, aboute the laſt end, it runneth ſomwhat watery. Of ſpices and gummes, the parts that are more moiſtened aſcend firſt, the hotter and the drier folow, which euē the colour comming nie more and more vnto red declareth. Moreouer they ſmell of brentnes, and in taſt they are les ſwiet &amp; pleſant. But without the body they are miniſtred effectually. &amp;c. But a .iii. kinds of water is gathered better of dry ſpices and medicines only rectified, not  in wine, but burning water which hath no manner of fleume more, in the which likewiſe, I wold chuſe the midſt.
            With waters of vertues, ſome alſo mixte well ſmelling ſedes, prouoking vrin, and fenel, violets parſly, ſaxifrage, maſtik, pomum arātium: beſides ſpices and odoriferous herbes, ſage, coſtum, rew ſothernwod, ſerpillum, the lilly of the vally. Thys is aſſcribed to one Arnold à Pariſian.
            
            There is without all dout a diuerſity bothe in  the kyndes of ſpyces, and alſo in the number and weight. Som vnto diuers ſpices, as cloues, nutmegs, cinamō of euery one half an oūce: (wherunto other ad zedoaria, galingal, lōg Peper, grains of paradiſe, of euery one .ii. drammes) put as muche ſage, and Lauendula, that the weighte of them ioyntlye maye counterpoys the weight of the ſpyces. &amp;c. Three or foure droppes of thys water, they counſell to mixte wyth the wine that menne dryncke at meeles, or els mornyng and eueninge  to be druncke ſeuerallye wyth a little wyne.
            
               
This water clereth the ſight (as they ſay) confirmeth the brain and goodnes of the wit: putteth away palſey: maketh the face whyt and bright, clē
               ſeth the ſkin: and doth many other thinges.
            Sum in the moneth of May or June, when ſage and lauender bee in their force, take halfe of this (ſir vnces) of the othe other twys as myche, &amp; cut it ſmall. They put to it Cloues, Ginger, nutmeg, mace, graines of paradys, cinamō, zedoaria, galingall, roſemary, of euerye one halfe an vnce,  they beet them and when they are put in wyne, they deſtill them. This water (they ſay) is better at the .iii. yeres ende then at the firſt. It hath all the ſame vertues whiche we reherſeth before one by one, to the number of the .xx. in an other water of vertues. They ſay a certain Iew was the autor of this deſcription, who attributeth all thies vertues vnto it.
            A maruelous water and of muche vertue. Cariophyllata, ginger, roſemary in equall portiōs,  put them in good wyne eight dayes and after deſtill them as aqua vitae. It is good for the aking of the breſt, for a weake ſtomack, for the griefes and gnawinges of the bely. It killeth wormes in the body and bowelles. If a man that is ſumwhat gros, deſyreth to be made, ſlender, let him drinke this: &amp; if any lean man deſire to be in better plyte, let him drinke it with ſugar.
            A water of vertues. Sage, Lauender, roſemary, carui, and diuers ſpices, when they are cut  or pund, thou ſhalt ſtiep them in very good wyne,

Other put alſo halfe an vnce of newe and freſhe ſage, I lyke better dry, into the veſſell that receiued the deſtilled water. Thies vertues are ſayd to be in it, firſt. It keepeth all kynd of fleſhe, fiſhe and other meates, that it is ſprinkled vpon, ſound and ſwiet from all maner of corruption, with his own ſauour and taſte .ii. It amendeth all faultes in wynes, as when they be troubled, ar hanging, or ſmel foyſty, or be otherwyſe corrupted, if a litle of it be dropt into it. By this meanes  thei recouer their taſte and colour, ſum within ſeuen

daies other within one: neither corrupt they afterwarde any more, nor yet is the remedy any thing perceiued .iii. Being ſprinkled vpon ſpices, it conſerueth their force &amp; ſmell .iiii. It breeketh inward impoſtumes, &amp; purgeth them downward before they cum to matter .v.

               WAters of Capons, as men call them, ar  giuen to drinke to reſtore the ſtrengthe, to women in chyldbed or old ſickmen, in diſeaſes of great weacknes, or through to muche euacuation. They are wont to ſieth the capon very long in water, that al the fleſh may fal from the bones, and be deſtilled together with the liquor, ether by it ſelfe, or other precious waters put vnto it, and ſpices, gold, ſyluer and precious ſtones. Sum allow the capon the more the elder he is: nether do they cut his throot, but ſtrangle &amp;  chooke him: nether do they pluck of his fethers by hoot water, or ſkalding him, but with their hands (dry) and ſo when his bowels are taken out and he is cut in ſmall pieces, they deſtill hym. Other do not take away all, but the guttes only.

This water excelleth  in many vertues. No diſeaſe of the eyes is ſo obſtinate and great, but it wil vaniſh awai and geue place to this medicin. Being drunke, it dryueth away all poyſon, other taken wyth meates: for ſo it auoydeth the poyſon by vomit. It cureth ye dropſy, it purgeth the ſtomak from al ill humors: it quencheth ye holy fire in one day, if flax dipt in it be laid vpō ye ſore. It is good alſo againſt ye fire of a blak diſpoſiciō &amp; white without (or as a certain Dutch boke hath, againſt ye inward heat of ye fire:  for if it appere red wtout, it ſhal in no wiſe be conuenient to lay on a plaſter.

            A water compoſed, the fyrſte amongſte Aegidius waters.

               calaminaris, of euerye one a dram, when they are

pund, ſieth thē in ye forſaith water till y• third part be waſted, &amp; the liquor ſtreyned with a cloth, thou ſhalt kiep it in a glas diligently cloſed nyne days (otherwyſe .xl.) Afterward let it be giuen in drink euery day in the morning before day (other wyſe, by the ſpace of .x. daies) to the ſick faſting. It is proffitable againſt the falling ſicknes if he that takes it continue faſting after it ſix houres. And truly it is a moſte effectuall remedy. It heeleth al reſolucion of the ſinewes, and the members are  ſtrengthened therby. If it be drunck with Caſtorium, it is good againſt all goutes, whiche hath not taken rout yet in the members. If it be drunk ix. daies together faſting, it puttes away all maner of agues, what matter ſoeuer it cum of (if it be drunk .ix. daies euery morning early. This water is alſo moſte profitable to waſh woūdes in which the ſinues are cut.)
            An other of Aegidius, the .ix. in number, otherwyſe they call it double. The ſiede of Apii, the ſied  of whyt Popy, Apii, ginger (otherwiſe, The ſied of Apii, whyte Popy, ſugar, Carioph.) of euery one equall weght. Pund in a morter, put to it conſeruatiue water, (that is deſtilled of perſely) and deſtill it. This is the chiefeſt remedy for the cough and breſt ill at eas. If a man drinke it coulde faſting, and in the euening as hoot as he can. If it be drunken hoot with Caſtorio, it is good againſt the diſeaſe called Apoplexia, it healeth alſo the mē
               bers ſicke of the Palſy, if ſo be the Palſy be not  deed in the mēbers. It bringeth ſliep &amp; reſt eaſly:

it chereth all the members, it driueth away il humors, and ſtrengtheneth the heed and the brayne.
            An other, the ſixe in number amongſt Aegidius waters. Gladiolus Hyſſop, Sauin, Sothernwood, (otherwys the ſied of Sothernwood, leuing out Sauin, I like it not) of euery one lyke much, beate them together, and let it ſtand a certain daies, thē deſtill it. This water is of greet ſtrēgth. It with ſtandeth all agues both hoot and cold. It prouoketh wemens floures if it be drunk thrys, but it is  hurtfull to wemen with chyld, and will deſtroy it. It ſtauncheth the bluddy flyx and other flyx, (I would ſay rather that it ſtyreth bloud rather euery where, then to ſtop: an other booke ſpeeketh of nothing but ſtopping the flix of the bely.) It purgeth ye ſtomack frō ill humors. It killeth worms being drunken faſting, it cureth al the grief, with Caſtorio, it heeleth the palſy (if it be drunke daily very hoot) within .iii. daies.

If ſo be it the meſure of the bloud excied thre Sextarts, then put to it .ii. vnces of Triacle, but if it be les, according the portion of the bloud, thou ſhalt leſſon the meſure of Triacle. They muſt al be prepared redy at hand that they may be put into the  bloud whyle it is yet warme. When they are all mixt, draw out a ſtilled liquor, whiche thou ſhalt kiep diligently in a glas and ſet it in the ſun .viii. daies: for it wil endure for .xx. yeares, it is knowē by experience that this liquor is excellent good againſt the peſtilence, the impoſtumes of the heed and the ſydes or ribes, or againſt the diſeaſes of ye liuer and lightes, the inflacion of the ſplene, corrupt bloud, ague, ſwellinges, trēbling of the hart, the dropſy, vnnatural heates, il humors, and chief  ly aga ynſt poyſons and the peſtilent ague. The ſick that is taken with any of the foreſaid diſeaſes ſhall drinke a ſpounful, or .iiii. or .v. droppes, and procure hym ſelf to ſweete.
         
         
            
               Of pur ging medicines, compoſed deſtilled.
            THey alſo are to be called cōpoſed waters, that  ar deſtilled of medicines compoſed, &amp; ſtiept in

wyne, burning water or other liquor. Certain cō
               poſitions of ſpices to reſtore the ſtrengtes of the hart and the ſpirites, are mixt with waters of capons, dreſt by deſtillations as I ſayd before: alſo with burning waters, or rather Quint eſſence of wyne, againſt the peſtilence and poyſons, as we declared before. But alſo purging medicines, Electuaria chiefly in the whiche Dacry dium and other vehement thinges hurtfull to the ſtomack are receiued, mixt with the liquors, ſpecially with burning  water rectified, or with wyne (perauenture alſo with milke and wyne, or with milck or whay alone, in hoot natures and diſeaſes, it ſhould dooe well) and ſumtimes let ſtande in infuſion or ſooking, they are artificiouſly deſtilled, that thei may be giuen to drinck to them that are deinty or rich, or exceeding weake, or haue their ſtomack abhorring againſt other medicines: whiche Lullius alſo prayſeth greetly, and certain practicioners of any acquaintaunce haue vſed it with prayſe. I know  a certain man, that deſtilled chieſly an electuary named Hamech, &amp; that whiche is of ye iuice of Roſes, and gaue to drinke vnto the weeker ſort the liquor that he receiued by it ſelfe: to them that were ſtronger, he myxt ſum of the elctuary with it: and ſo he ſaid he purged ſick men without any grief.

            Gold Potable or that may be drōken.
            
               OF potable gold, who ſo liſt he may read much in the booke of Vlſtadius whiche he nameth the heauen of philoſophers: &amp; in the boke of Lullus of quint eſſence. That there is vertue in gold, whiche commeth of it made hot and quenched in water, that maye be an argumente, that the water wherin a wedge of iron or golde is ſlekt, is commended of Nicander 
                againſt the poyſon called Aconitum: for it ſemeth to be vnderſtanded of water, wherein theſe mettalles ſhoulde be quenched, when as he nameth none other liquor. Quench (ſaith he) red hat iron or the dros of iron, or red hot golde or ſiluer dip it in a troubled potion or drink. Where the expoſiter ſaith: Quenſh iron in water and drink it, and a litle after: quench the dros of iron in hony &amp; drinck the intinction, ſo calling the liquor wherein anye any thing is quenched. Dioſcorides bids to quēch  in wine (as Auicenna alſo hath, and Aegineta, and alſo Aetius, who ſaith that a miln ſtone ſo ſlekt is holſom, and that the wine ſhould be druncke hot) with theſe wordes: and the dros of iron, or iron it ſelf or gold, or ſiluer red hot quēched in wine, if yt liquor be dronk. And trueli it ſemeth that wine is more apt to receiue ye vertue of gold, then water. When as I on a time taſted water, wherin golde was often quenched, I could perceiue no quality of the ſauor or the taſt to be altered in it. Again, it  is credible yt burning water, ſpecially ſuche as is

brought vnto quint eſſēce doth draw more ſtrēgth of the gold thē wine: &amp; the more if the gold be beaten into moſt thin plaits, &amp; moſt of all if it be betē into pouder. But the oyl that coms of golde ſhall pas al theſe. As for gold ſimplely ſod, as in ye brothe of capōs, there is no ſtrength in it all, except a mās opinion cādo any thing, as I beleue withal learned men for the moſt part. Of the vertues of gold, rede Auicenna in his ſecōd boke. 78. cha. But becauſe ye pureſt is to be choſē for medicins, I wil  bring in here Plinies words out of his. 33. boke a bout thend of the .iiii. chap. of ye purging of gould. Let gold be roſted &amp; broyled with thriſe as muche in weight of the clots or lūps of ſalt: and agayne wt .ii. procions of ſalt &amp; one of the ſtonecalled ſchiſton: ſo it yeldeth his ſtrength to the things burnt with it in an earthen veſſel, it ſelf remaining pure &amp; vncorrupted. I coniecture yt 
               Plini in this place did miſtake ſchiſtū
                the ſtone, for ſchiſtū
                an alū: for in an other place (the. 35. boke. 15. cha.) he writeth  yt gold is purged with black alū.

               Plini may be excuſed, becauſe the worde ſtoone is more cōmon and of larger ſignification with hym for he nameth both quick ſiluer and manye other metally things, ſtones, wherfor he might call the Alum Schiſton by the name of Schiſton. Albeit he ſhoulde not haue ſo done, for the difference of that which is proprely called a ſtone Schiſtus. In the ſame place of Plini, after the words now reherſed is put: The reſt of the aſhes (that is to ſaye, of the ſalt, with the which being burnt together, ye golde  is purged: or with .ii. parts of the ſalt, and one of Schiſtum) kepte in an earthen pot, and tempred wyth water, annoynted vppon the face, it healeth the diſeaſe beginning in the chin called Lichenes, or like foul breakings out: which ſhalbe conueniently waſht away with Beane meale.

But in my indgemente, ought to be red ſo that thoſe wordes decocted and annoynted be referred vnto the aſhes, as bothe the conſequency of the text, &amp; alſo the maner of the medicins do requyre.

And it is able to lighten the ſubſtance of the hart and the ſpirit with his brigthnes, to comfort it with his maſſynes: and with the temperatnes therof to temper  and preſerue it, to purge the bloud, and with the

ponderoſity and weight therof to inclyne the ſuperfluities to the partes of expulſion, and to conſerue youth. It conſerueth the vertues of the principall partes in his actions, and by his temperatnes it louſeth the vrine reſtreined.

A woūd made with it is neuer inflamed: in electuaries it comforteth the ſight, and maketh pure aboue all thinges the ſubſtance of the hart and the beginning of lyfe: it clooketh the leproſy and refreineth it. But thies  vertues ought to be attributed to trewe gould in

Let it ſtād ſo for the ſpace of .iiii. or .v. dayes: afterwarde put to it thryſe as muche Rooſewater, and deſtill all thys in a limbecke in a kettle full of water, ſiething as in a Balneo Mariae. Thou ſhalt kepe the water gathered therof diligently ſtopt, for y• ſame vſe that the former ſerueth for.
            An other excellent water. Two pound of the  water of the floures of Citri. One pounde of the

water of red Roſes: of Myrtus half a pounde. Of muſke Roſes a good quantitye, &amp; likewyſe of Iaſmin (that is to ſay of the floures.) Of cloues halfe an vnce .iii. vnces of Aſſa dulcis well beaten, one vnce of Vernicis. Styrax calamita &amp; red Styrax of ether half an vnce. All theſe pund &amp; mixt with water thou ſhalt deſtil them in a glaſen limbeck, the head and the receiuer diligently cloſed with clay, with a ſoft fire, or in a Balneo Mariae, or in a kettle full of ſiething water. 
            
            A water of moſt ſwiet ſauor, with ye which oyl is deſtilled alſo. The laſt being mixt with a hundreth times as much of pure water, doth ſauoure it all with the ſwietnes therof: but this with a. M times as much. A pound of Myrre choſen, pure, new and fat beaten into ſmal peces: half a pound of the iuyce of Rooſes: when they are mixte together in a limbecke, let them be deſtilled in aſhes, wher firſt thou ſhalt ſeparate the water wt a ſlow fire: thē make ye fire bigger &amp; ſeparat ye oyl: at laſt  deuide the water from the oyl. That water maketh the face brighte. It cloſeth woundes, effectuallye, as well olde as newe. The oyle is mooſte precyous, and dothe the ſame thynges that the water dothe, but muche ſooner, as for example, it dothe that in an houre that the water is aboute a hoole daye. An ounce of thys water deſtilled, mixt with certain hundred times as much of pure water, maketh them all notably wel ſmelling: but an ounce of the oyle, if it be put to certayne hundred  poundes of pure water, doth the ſame.
            
               
A certaine Rooſewater made wyth Muſcke, whiche is required and vſed alſo inother compoſitiōs. Put a .xii. graines or more of Muſcke in a glas that is wide beneath, and narowe aboue: &amp; ſo cloſed with a parchmente, ſet it in the ſunne a iiii. or .v. daies. Afterwarde, take an other glaſſe like vnto it full of Rooſes dried and beaten, ſtop ye mouth of it wt a fine &amp; thin cloth, other linnē or of hear. Thē put ye mouth of ye veſſell yt conteineth ye roſes into ye mouth of thother, wherin the muſk  is conteined, and ſtop it aboute diligentlye 
                  •
               oyth clay, and ſet it in the ſun, ſo that the glas with roſes be the vppermoſt, the other beneath in a windowe or other where, where the heat of the ſunne is vehement. Thou maiſt alſo ſprinkle the Roſes moderatly dried and beaten with good Roſe water and ſo put them into a ſtill. &amp;c. Thys water moſt ſwiet, thou maiſt vſe when thou wylt bothe alum, and alſo mixt with other compoſicions.
         
         
            
               VVaters deſtilled called Coſmeticall, 
                that is perteininge to garniſhynge and deckinge.
            
               DEſtylled waters for garniſhinge, are deuyded alſo into certayne differences, for ſome are for the face, to make the coloure of it whyte, ruddye, bryghte, to put awaye wrinckles, to preſerue and kepe it from Sunne burning, or to aboliſh the ſpots and  ruſty roughnes in it. Other pertain to the heares

and to the chaunginge of the coloure in them. Other make the tieth white.
            Al the vſe of Coſmetical and garniſhing thinges, oughte not to be taken for vnhoneſt and vndecent for a man that is wel inſtituted and godly mineded, for Galen alſo the mooſte famous of all phiſicions, preſcribeth coſmeticall medicines not a few in his worcke of compoſicion accordinge to places: and he declareth that the vſe of thē is many times profitable and honeſt. For the leudneſſe  of certain maried men is ſuche, that for ſmall and light faultes of their wiues, they are turned from the loue of them vnto harlots and hores, and certain faults or blemiſhes are ſuch, that a man of a baſhful nature wold be aſhamed to be ſene abrode with them: ſome alſo bring vexation, or griefe, or itch, as certain whelks in the face. &amp;c. I write not this vnto wemen, or other men, but vnto Phiſicions only, who ſhould be good and diſcrete men: y• both otherwiſe they may vſe theſe honeſt remeadies  and medicins, and chiefly whē ſuch as theſe be, are required of the wifes of tried honeſtye of Kinges, Princes, and noble men. More of theſe thinges, and what the art of garniſhinge, wherin honeſt garniſhinge is ſoughte for, differs for the commeticall and deceitfull, thou ſhalt read in Galen of compoſi medic. ſec. locos, the firſt boke. 2. ch.
            Such Coſmetical waters as be ſimple, we wil not declare heare, as be the waters of Bean floures, Strawberies, Dew, Gotes milke: Read before  of the water of ſtrawberies, and of the ſame

and other in Brunſvvick or Riffius. Yea Aqua vitae hath a certain coſmeticall and garniſhing vertue, as we reherſed in his place.
            Waters deſtilled of the leues of the peeche tree and Willowe, of lyk weight mixt together, do hele the red whelkes in the face, (the Frenche men call them rubiz) being moiſtened therwith.
            A ſpyced wyne for the garniſhing of wemen, whiche maketh the ſkin whyt, fyne, pure, and wel coloured. Put Ginger and Cinamon in wyn and  deſtill them as Roſewater. It is holſome alſo againſt all could complexions and moſte againſt palſy. Arnold in his boke of wyne.
            A garniſhing water, wherwith wemen amend their thick groſe ſkyn, black and ſkaly or ſkuruy, with Quick ſiluer ſod in a raw eg, &amp;c. thou maiſt fynd in Nicolas Maſſa vpon the frenche diſeaſe, in his .vi. booke .ii. chapter.
            A water for the bewtifying of the face. The ſpume of ſyluer half a pounde: when it is beaten  ſift it, and in two poundes of whyte vinegar ſieth it till the third part be conſumed, ſturring it with a ſtick, when it is ſod deſtill it. At length ad to it half an vnce of Caphura, Aphronitrum, oyle of Tar taro, clouen Alum, of euery one an an vnce. ſtrein it through a cors cloth, anoynt the face and neck. Epiphanius Empericus.
            
            An other of the ſame mans, for the brightnes of the face. Take Lily routes, Arus, Dragons, of euery one whyles they be freſh, half a pound. half  a pound of the flowers of Beenes. Eigth vnces of

Rooſewater, deſtill them, put to it Moſchocarii, Cinamon, of ether two drames. Waſhe the face therwith twyſe a daye.
            A very good water of the ſame mans for the ſame vſe. Take flowers of Beenes, bitter Almō
               des, the leeues of Peeche trees, of euery one .iii. vnces, Gootes milke as muche as of all the reſt. When they ar deſtilled put ſix or eight whytes of egges ſod, which muſt be mixt with the water deſtilled, by &amp; by deſtil it again and mixt with it .ii.  drams of Caphura.
            
            A frenche water for litle moules, all ſcalynes &amp; freckmes of the face. A pound of Tartarū, or lyes of wyne burnd till they be whyt: Maſtick, Tragacā
                  tha, of ether half an 
                  •
               nce. Sir drams of Camphora, iiii. whytes of egs. When they are pund &amp; mixt in Roſewater, let thē be deſtilled. They cure maruelouſly. Epiphanius Empericus.
            
            A water procuring vnto the face a Rooſelyke and faire colour. Take a pynt of Aqua vitae thrys  deſtilled: an vnce of Praſiliū: Cloues to the nūber often, &amp; as many grains of Paradys: fiue Cubebas when they are all pund &amp; ſifted, heet them a litle with Aqua vitae in a veſſel diligently couered, that nothyng breeth out by any meanes. Afterwarde when this mixtur is could again deſtill it in a lē
               beck of glas, with a very ſlow fyer, and thou ſhalt haue a good water &amp; a cleer. When thou wilt vſe it, wiet the face &amp; ſkyn of the perſon with a ſponge moiſtened therewith, for it maketh without all  doubt a Rooſe colour fayre and bewtifull. And

this dying wyll continue a long time, for .ii. or. iii yeares. If thou canſt not haue Aqua vitae, take reed wyne of Rupella the beſt thou canſt fynde, about the meaſure of Semiloti, a dutche wourd for half an vnce, for they call an vnce a loot, for there muſt be more meaſure of wyne, then Aqua vitae. But Aqua vitae is much better to the preparing of this water. This water garniſheth a mans ſkin ſubtilly &amp; maruelouſly. Out of the writen booke, the author wherof is not declared. A lyke vnto  this ſhalbe declared by and by out of Gordonius. An other that taketh away the wrinkles &amp; ſpots of the face, and clarifieth the ſkinne, of whytes of egges deſtilled: Reede before emongeſt the ſimple waters deſtilled in Balneo Mariae.
            
            A maruelous water that putteth away Napas (litle whelkes or puſhes or litle teetes, ſum call them Napas, I thinke the Italians) Lupinas acorns, kurnelles, Porros, that is, wartes, &amp; what euel ſo euer groweth in any place of the body it taketh  it away ii. pounds of oyl de bay, whyt frankenſence, Maſtick elect, Gum Arabick, cleer Tur pintyn, of euery one .iii. drams: When they are beten mixt altogether and deſtil them in a lembeck. And in this water thus deſtilled put half a pound of Cineris terrae &amp; deſtil it again: and kiep this water as a treſure. The author is nameles. But it ſemeth that this liquor wilbe rather an oyll then a water, &amp; ſaue only that aſhes is added vnto it, it migth haue bien well aſſcribed vnto Balmes. 
            
            A coſmeticall water that bewtifieth the face &amp;

breeketh the ſtoone, is deſcribed before aboute the end of the title where we entreted generally of the vertues of liquors deſtilled. Reed alſo Rogerius, in his fourth tretiſe the fift chapter.
            ¶ Certain Coſmeticall waters for the face, ſhalt thou fynd alſo by and by, in the waters that folow aſcribed to the heares. Ther be alſo emōgſt the Balmes hereafter, which ſerue to garniſhing
         
         
            
               Certain vvaters Deſtilled for the garniſhing 
                of the face, out of Andreas Furnerius in his Frenche booke of the bewtifying man kynde.
            
               
                  A
                Water for the brightnes and whytnes of the face. The flowers of whyt Rooſes, of water Lily, Elder, Lilyes the chydes take out, of Beenes of the flowers of euery one of thies a pound. Half a pound of the water of Strawberies. Crums of whyt bred  as miche as you ſhall thynke good .xii. whytes of egs .ii. vnces of whyte Frankenſence. Into all thies let Ceruſſa pund be put for a nightes ſpace. Let them all bee deſtilled in a Lembeck of glas: when the water is drawen out let it bee ſet in the ſun, and waſhe the face therwith morning and euening, ſo that ye wype it not.
            An other, that the face and the other partes of the body may retein a faire and youthfull form .ii. vnces of Aqua vitae: the water of of Been flowers,  Roſe water, of ether .iiii. vnces. of Lily water .vi.

ounces, when they are all mixt, put to them a drā of the whiteſt Tragacantha. After this water hath ſtand in the ſunne .vi. daies, ſtreine it throughe a faire linnen cloth. The vſe of it is in the morning ſo that it be not wipte of.
            An other for the brightneſſe and beautye of the face. A water of the whites of egges newe laide, made by a ſpunge with like meaſure of the 
                  •
               ice of Limons, deſtill it as roſewater. Put vnto this water afterward, about .ii. ounces of communly,  and the limō beaten hole (the ſkin puld of rather) put it into the reſt: after .viii. daies wring out the iuyce from it and mixt it with water. Let the face be waſht firſt with pure water and wipt, let it be waſht with this water deſtilled. It procureth an hanſome beautye, conſerueth the ſkin, and is vtterly the beſt.
            An other which Iſabella of Aragonia duches of Millen vſed, knede the flour of whete Mele, wyth a Sextarium almooſte a pinte .xx. vnces of Gotes  milke: then bake the bread therof gentlelye in an ouen, and draw it out afore it be to muche baked. The crums of this bread cut in ſmal peces, or els crumd betwixt ons fingers and put in other new gotes milk, let it ſtand ſo .vi. houres. Thou ſhalt mixt with it the water of .xii. whites of egs made with the ſpunge: lime made of eg ſhels an ounce: Camphora, Suger, Alum, white corall, of euerye ii. drammes. When all theſe are pund, let them be mixt wyth the moyſte thinges, and deſtylled in a  lembeck of glaſſe. A notable good water ſhal com

therof, and moſt profitable to put away all vexacions growing in the face. It maketh the beauty of the face as excellent as is poſſible to be made.
            An other to beautifye the face. The leaues of Rooſemary, white Tartary, mixt them with whit wine, and vſe the water drawne oute of it by a limbecke, as ye woulde do the former medicines for the ſame effect.
            An other for the ſame. Set the floures of beanes in good white wine a day or .ii. in a glas bottell,  then deſtill them wyth a ſofte fire. The vſe of it is, to waſh the face therwith morning and euening, but you muſt waſhe it firſt with a decoction of Ceruſſa. And you ſhal ſee it ſhortly worke.
            An other that taketh away al maner of ſpots. Put into a glas like muche of Criſtall and Corall, with water of Limones ſo much that it maye couer them and be a fingers bredth aboue them. Stop this veſſell and put it in ſome colde place in the earthe as in a wine ſeller a fewe dayes. Then  caſte away the ſhelles and waſh the ſnailes with water ſomewhat ſalt ſo ofte, till all their ſlimines be waſht away. Then deſtill them and keepe the water. Afterward thou ſhalt draw out a water of rapes cut ſmall by a limbeck. When thou wilt vſe it, take a ſponeful of the firſte water .iiii. of the ſecond, and .iiii. of the third, mixt them and waſhe ye face, which notwithſtanding muſt firſt be waſht with water and wipte.
            An other maruelous for the ſame purpooſe.  Take ſnailes wythoute theyr ſhelles: and waſhe

them as is before reherſed, then ſprinckle an vnce of Salte (otherwiſe ſalte Gemmae) beaten, in a glaſſe and put the ſnailes there vpon: then ſprinkle other Salte vppon them againe, and ſnailes vppon that, and ſo ſhall you do continuallye layinge ſalte vppon Snailes, and Snailes vppon ſalte, till the thyrde parte of the veſſell be fylled. Then poure vnto them ſo muche of the iuyce of Snailes, that it ſtande aboue the ſalt and Snailes, two fingers thicke, and deſtyll them: vſe thys  water as is aboue reherſed. If ſo be it thou canſt not commodiouſlye deſtill them, ſet them all mixt together in a clooſe veſſell, tyll they receiue the forme of an oyntmente, and that ſhall you vſe at euenynge, as the other aboue wrytten Oyntementes (the face fyrſte waſhte and wipte) and the ſeconde daye after waſhe the face wyth water of Beane floures. This alſo did I reade in the Antidotary of Gordonius.
            
            An other not deſtilled. Twelue Snailes, cut  euerye one in .iiii. partes, put in good white wine. This liquor ſhalt thou vſe as the aforeſaide. It ſhall come to good ſucces.
            After thys followeth a deſtylled water of a yonge Storke of the ſame effecte, and operation, whyche I deſcribed amongſte the ſymple Medicinall waters.
            An other manner verye good and ſecreate, (or vnknowne.) Sixe newe laide Egges, halfe a pounde of Malmſey, a yong Pigion not yet holelye  fetheared, Cheſe new from the pres yt is made

of vnſkimmed milcke .viii. Arantia Poma: oyle of Tartaro. iii. ounces, an ounce of Ceruſſa. Let thē be beaten that maye be beaten, and mixte altogether, that they may be deſtilled wyth a ſlow fyre. The vſe of this water is like the other before. It maketh a fair ſkin, fine, tender as is poſſible.
            A waſhinge or Kynges water whyche abolyſheth all ſpottes. Take water of cleare Turpintine, as muche as can be gotten out of .ii. pounds of it: put therein halfe an ounce of Maſticke,  iii. ounces of white Frankenſence, halfe an ounce of Tragacantha. When they are pund mixte them wyth the water, and deſtyll them, keepe the water. Then mealte Swines greaſe of a male Hog, vnſaulted, and ſtrayne it throughe a double lynnen cloth. Then take white Ginger, Cloues, Cinamon, Euphorbium, Spiknarde, Camphora, of euerye one two ounces, three Nutmegges, when all theſe are pund, myxt wyth the ſtrayned Swines greaſe: put vnto theſe two ounces of quycke  Siluer often times waſhte wyth ſalte and Vineger and wrounge throughe a piece of Leather, and with this mixte the droſſe (la feuille ou de lauenre, as it is wrytten in Frenche) of quicke ſyluer (de couppelle.) When all is mixte together, deſtill them, and keepe the water. Afterwarde take vi. ounces of the water of the forſaid Turpentin, and of the latter water twiſe ſo much, mixt them: and when you wyll vſe them waſhe the face fyrſte wyth a decoction of Ceruſſa and wipe it. 
            
            Then poure about .vi. droppes of thys water

mixt together into the palm of the hand, and wher thou wilt anoynt, couering the place anoynted or wet with a linnen cloth till it be dried. A marueilous effect and operacion ſhall folowe therupon.

            Put to alſo Aſſes milke or Gootes milke aboute iii. Sextares (that is .ii. pyntes &amp; a half .lx. vnces. Deſtill thies in a lembeck of glas.
            That the face may ſhyne elegantly .xxx. newe laid egges, ſtiep them in vinegar the ſharpeſt you can get for the ſpace of .iii. daies and night: then boor them through with a pyn, that the humor wt in them may run al out. Deſtill all this in a Roſeſtill,  that the face may be waſht therwith.
            
               
A water clarifying the face. Take the rout of Dragons made cleen and cut in to thin roundles, ſtiep them .ix. daies in whyte wyne, ſo that euery daye half a pound or more freſhe wyn be powred vnto them, then take the call of fat that is aboute the goutes in a kides bely, taken in May, to the number of ſix: rys beeten and ſod in .iii. poundes of black nightſhad: and a poūd of the meel of rys: half a pound of the water of wylde plums or bullies, blaūſhed Beenes to ſeeth in the ſame water:  Put vnto this .xii. rotten Appuls and ten egges, two handfull of the routes of common flower deluce, or els the flower deluce of Florence: a pound of Hony: halfe a pounde of bitter Almondes, Gum Arabick, Sarcocolla, Tragacantha, Borage, Camphora, of euery one two drams: ſhiepes milk ſix poundes: Venice Turpentin .ii. vnces: water of the floures of water Lily.

Then temper Porcellanas in water of Limons, till they may be mollified: put to half an vnce of Borax. Al thies with a very litle of ſwines grees, muſt bee mixte  with water of Beenes. With that whiche is made of this, muche lyke an oyntment, anoynt thy hool face morning and euening, and waſhe it awaye with warm water ſtrained through bran.

            A water deſtilled of larde, that the heares may be made long and yellow and ſhininge, &amp; the face more elegant. Scrape larde as muche as ye will and ſhaue it very ſmall: then beate it in a marble morter, til it be like paſte knoden. Of thys deſtylled in a limbeck, thou ſhalt gather a white liquor  wherwith thou ſhalt annoynt thy heares and face for it wil make them very fair and bright.

Likewiſe it healeth the ſkalles of the head annoynted therewith, and cureth the guttam roſaceam layde vppon it in manner of a plaiſter. But mixt wyth the ſtone called Calaminaris and Aloes, it healeth  the Lupum perfitelye, laying a plaiſter of it thervpō twiſe a day, if alſo the ſuperfluities be waſht with the ſame mixture. It muſt in no wiſe be taken inwardly within the body.

            Take the tender buddes of Fennel before they floriſh or go abrode, full of iuyce with the leaues. Put theſe in a Phiall of glaſſe, but fyll it not vp: turne it vp ſide downe and put the mouth of it into  an other Phiall vnder it, and cloſe it with dow, that the ſpirites brethe not oute. Put the Phials in ſome hoole in a wall towarde the hoteſt ſouthe ſunne.

The bottom of this pot is put into another, put vnder it in a pit of the earth, and the ioyning of the pots is compaſſed wt clay cloos. Then make they a fier about the vpper part of the pot by the ſpace of one night (.x. houres or more.

            Sumtimes certain waters and oyles ar made by deſcencion, lyke as of Roſeny tries when they are burnt pitche. Syluius. But of Oyles which ar made by deſcention we wil ſpeeke hereafter. Certain are made by a middle way between a diſcention and aſcention, as Oyll of Coperos, by a Cucurbita layd along ouerthwart vpon the ſyde.
         
         
            
               Deſtillation in Aſſhes, or Sand 
                or Dros of metall beeten. &amp;c.
            
               IN Aſſhes are bothe waters and oyles deſtilled. Waters with a moſte gentle &amp; ſoft heet, whiche thou ſhalt diſcerne by touching with thy hand both the aſſhes and alſo the veſſels of deſtillacion. And perauenture there is no difference, for the deſtillacion of any kind of waters, in Balneo Mariae or in Aſſhes, if ſo be it thou obſerue the meaſure of ye fyer. For  in Balneo Mariae, the water that ye ſtillatory is put

in, may be ſkalding hoot: the aſhes may not be to hoot, that is when herbes, rootes, flowers or any liquors ar deſtilled to deriue a water of thē. Men thinke them to be made ſo muche the ſwieter &amp; les ſmelling of any fyrines and brenning, being deſtilled in ſuche aſhes becauſe the thinge is doone more ſoftly and with more leyſur, ſo that the heed or lid be not hoot, and ſumtymes betwene the falling of the drops, a mā may tel ſwiftly til he cum at fifty. But the Oyles haue nied of a gretter fire  and a more vehement heet (that is) a dryer: therefore although it may bee rightly doone in aſhes, whatſoeuer is done in water, yet not cōtrary. for oyles may be made in aſhes, but none in ſiething water. But this thing ſhalbe more euident herafter where we ſhall teache of Quinteſſence.
            
            The deſtillacion by aſſhes is eaſy and redy, if an earthen or braſen veſſell, diep inough, and able to receiue the Cucurbita or body of the ſtill, be filled with fyne aſſhes and ſifted or fyned ſand, ſo ful  that the matter to be deſtilled which is in the veſſell, may be cleen within the aſhes and no part of it aboue. This veſſell full of aſhes ſhalt thou ſet vpon fiue or ſix iron barres, which ar laid ouerthwart from one ſyde to an other: that is to ſaye .iii. ſydes of the furnace being layd, they ſhall occupye two of them: the further ſyde it ſhall not nied, if it be done againſt a wall. The foor part of this .iiii. cornerd bielding ſhalbe lefte open, that the fyer may be made and put vnder therat. The length 
               
of euery ſyde is ſufficient to be one foote long, the heigth ſix fingars or there aboute. All thies ſhall we ſtrengthen euery where with clay (and pieces of ſhelles mixt together) that the heet may the better be kept in .ii. breething hooles left in the corners. But this maner is for vpon a ſoden and only miet for one veſſel. I bielded once a more laborious fornace on this ſorte. In a corner of the houſe I raiſed a foundacion of brick and lyme, a foote and a halfhy. Vpon the foundaciō or harth,  a round fornace, with one narowe door, long and brode lyke a lytle brick (ſo that a hand may be put in) which is ſet vp when I lyſt to ſhit the fornace. There were .iii. ventes or breethyng hooles, the height of the fornace was about .x. inches. Aboue this fornace ther was an iron plait laid of ye ſame compas, of .ii. foote or more broode through the midſt, about this was an edge rayſed of vnburnt brick (for vnto the fornace I tooke burnt brick) in a compas wyſe, the heigth of two hand breed. 
            
            This round place aboue the plait was filled wt aſſhes, in ye aſhes round about was ther ſet about fyue ſtilles of glas, that at one tyme and with one fyre many waters or Oyles might be deſtilled together. Rounde about the fornace was well fenſed with wrought claye with verye ſalte water, wherewith ſum Hors dounge was myxt.
            This kynd of fornace is ſurely very cōmodious, bycauſe it niedeth litle fier, whiche alſo it ſelfe in this forme endureth very long: that it is almoſte 
               
inough to ſee to the fyer morning and euening. But it muſt bee made only of cooles, whiche are put in to the fornace with a litle fyer ſhouell, only that they may be goten in at the litle dore hanſumly: the edges of this fier ſhouel muſt be a litle turned vp, that it may holde the cooles ye better. Ther is nied alſo of long iron fyerſhouel (as the fornace ſhal require) turned in at the end according to a ſtreigth corner, and ther in the end to be ſumwhat made broder, wherwith the cooles within may be  moued and laid as a man will haue them, and put down frō the other fier ſhouel. But thies thinges are better knowen by experience. In this kynd of fornaces, and how ſoeuer they be in aſſhes, bothe other kindes of waters and oyles, as I ſayd, are rightly prepared: and chiefly ſuch dry thinges as are infuſed in wyne, &amp; ſumtymes ſtieped, the veſſell being very well ſhyt that they may render the very ſame ſauour and taſt, as wormwood, lyke as I ſhewed before, Gentian, Iuniper beries, and  ſpyces, the waters deſtilled whereof our cuntreymen name goulden. &amp;c. Then the deſtillacion of Aqua vitae is ſumtimes repeted, in whiche I haue obſerued this, that the better parte alwayes &amp; the pureſt iſſueth out firſt, &amp; what ſo euer is flegmatyck (or deed water, as ſum cal it, which is vnproffitable, hurtfull, and almoſte ſtinking) foloweth laſt: whiche is well perceiued and knowen in a glas heed for the ſtill: For whyle the purer matter, that is, the fyry and aery ſubſtance iſſueth, no  ſygn apereth in the heed of the ſtill: but when the

fleume comes once, and tokens of the water folowing by ſtraikes appeare manifeſtly, as ye ſee them, remoue the receiuing veſſel, and what ſo euer remaineth in the Cucurbita or bely of the ſtil, poure it out as good for nothing: and begin a new deſtillation of freſh and that muſt be repeted, vntil no fleume appeare any more, which chaunſeth lightly in the fourth or fifthe deſtillation. Afterwarde there nedeth no more deſtillation, but circulacion, that the liquor be rectified, as they terme  it, and turned into heauen or quint eſſence.
            
            Thinges deſtilled in the vapour of hot water, retein more perfitly the vertues and qualities of of plantes, but becauſe they haue ſome coruption in them, they can not be kept long. Thoſe thinges longar which by the heat of aſhes or dros of metall beaten to pouder are deſtilled in veſſels of ſtone or glas, how many ſo euer they be, vppon a long or round fornace couered with ſlates or tiles which may holde the hie ſandes compaſſed wyth  hie lead. But theſe veſſels muſte be made hot by little and little not ſodenly, and couled likewiſe be fore they be opened to the colde aire, or els they breake ſtraight way. Syluius.
            
            
               Vlſtadius preſcribeth a certaine deſtillation in aſhes wyth ſo ſofte a fyre, that thou maiſte number one .ii. iii. betwene one drop and an other.
            Anye kynde of frute thou wilte, when it is well ripe cut ſmall and beaten, thou ſhalt deſtill it in ſand with a ſlow fire. Vlſtadius. 
               
            
            ¶ A certaine waye to make water by and by.
            
               
               WAter is made alſo vppn a ſodein, whiles the iuice is made hot or ſkalding, a glaſen cup is ſet vpon it, in the whiche the fume paſſeth into droppes: and the droppes gathered therupon are driuen together into water. By this meanes Vineger is eaſilye tourned into water. Thys is holſome for ſpottes and blemiſhes in the eies, and for the web, to put them awaye: ſpeciallye if Rue be ſod in white Vinegar. Cardanus. 
               
            
            Som are put reſinam larigenam in a trene veſſell, whoſe bottome muſt be made by a tornar as thin as is poſſible, ſo that a man may ſee through it, ſo in a hotte place the purer parte and the thinner deſtilleth.
         
         
            
               Of roſaries, that is to ſay inſtruments wherwith a deſtilled liquor maye be gotten oute of Roſes and other medicines, fyre being put vnder (for the mooſte parte wythoute anye  meane betwixte) either of cooles, or of chippes.
            
               FIre in deſtillacion dothe more procure the ſauoure of aduſtion and brentneſſe vnto the water that is to bee deſtilled, then do cooles or water, whiche thinge to auoide put ſande in the pan in commun Roſaries: or rather ſee that ſande be betwixte the fyre and the panne, and alſo aboute the pan, and that  it be glaſed (or oyled as ſome call it) if it be an earthen

panne: for it is made alſo of braſſe. The ioyning together of the pan and the lembecke thou ſhalt fenſe with clay, that is to ſaye with a lynnen clout perieted or cloſed with clay and hanſumlye laid aboute it: and the receiuinge veſſell with the noſe of the lembecke likewiſe. Brunſvvick. Some nowe a daies make theeſe Roſarie pans of bras, and vpon the ſand they lay the hearbes that be to be deſtilled: and round about the pan (and within it alſo except I be deceiued) they fill a voide ſpace  with water, a pipe being made for the purpoſe to poure them in at. They 
                  •
               ut fire vnder it ether of coles or of very ſhort chips, becauſe the flame of ye fire may ſeme to be able to do les hurt, for the water that compaſſeth. But withoute all doute, all theſe ſhalbe much better deſtilled in glaſſes, or in Balneo Mariae, or in aſhes.
            Vineger is made white wyth deſtillation, as well for other vſes of Chymiſtes and Phiſycions, as alſo to be mixte wyth Sirrupe of Vinnegar,  whereuppon I wyll reherſe Bulcaſis wordes. Builde an Atanor like vnto that wherein Rooſewater is deſtylled, and euer take a ſtillatorye veſſell of glaſſe or of earthe glaſed: fyll three partes of it wyth good Vinegar, that the fourthe parte of the Veſſell aboue maye be emptye, leaſte when it doothe ſeethe the Vineger bee ſpilte and runne ouer. Then couer the veſſel with ſome Veſſell vppon it, as ye knowe, hauynge a nooſe, as the manner is in roſewater, and make a  light fire, not greate nor ſtronge: for if it be vehement,

the Vinegar ſhal not become ſo white. The vineger that is deſtilled muſte be of white wyne, and verye ſharpe. So ſhalt thou gather a whyte and pure liquor, which thou ſhalt keepe in ſtore. After y• ſame maner may wine be deſtilled. Thys writeth Bulcaſis. I deſtilled it once in glaſen veſſels in aſhes, which I kepe yet hitherto certaine yeares, like to Vinegar not deſtilled bothe in ſauoure and taſte, differing only in the coloure and ſubſtaunce, where in it is like to pure water to ſee  to. Bulcaſis ſeemeth to be of this opinion, that vineger ſhoulde be deſtilled with fire or water, not in a Balneo Mariae, but in that maner that he maketh the firſt and ſecond in deſtillinge of Rooſes, that is, without water with fyre of woode or rather of cooles. I haue deſtilled verye excellentlye in aſhes. Pearles, eg ſhels, ſtone of the rains and bladder are diſſolued with ſtrong vineger, ſpecially whē it is deſtilled or with the iuice of limōs: ſo is alſo both kinde of corals, and they afterward  dried, are readily crumled: praecipitatum and ſublimatum and cinabrium, and they retourne into quick ſiluer. Syluius. The Chymiſtes ſay metals are reſolued with vinegar deſtilled: alſo wt mans vrine deſtilled.
            The leaues of hempe tourned into meale, becauſe they pearſe the heade, make drincke which wyll make a man pleaſauntlye drounke. Cardan. It ſeemeth water ſhoulde be poured to it, and when they are made dowe together, then to bee  deſtilled: like as burninge water in a Roſarye or

Roſeſtil, or lyke inſtrument where the fyer is put vnder without any men, and perauentur the deſtillacion ſhould be twys or thrys repeted. I wold ſay the ſame of Ootes water, whereof lykewyſe Cardanus wryteth: The Moſcouites (ſaith he) bycauſe they lack wyn, vſe water deſtilled of Ootes whiche enflameth and maketh a man drunken no les then wyne. For Ootes being of a more gros ſubſtāce, it muſt niedes when it is deſtilled make hoot, becum more ſubtill and ſharp, and draweny  to the nature of burning water. This 
                  •
               aith he.
            The lyke may be done of any drinck that maketh drunken, as Ale, Bier, Curmus and Meed, ſpecially when it is old, and that whiche is ſodde with Mill.
            Hony whyle it is a deſtilling is wont to ryſe vp and run ouer, when it is made hoot. But this is auoyded, when a man deſtilleth in a cōmun Roſeſtill, by putting vpon it within the pan a wooden ſiue (made with hors hear) ſo that it touch the hony.  If ye wil deſtil in a Cucurbita or body of glas, mixt with it pure and well waſſhed ſand, &amp; make a ſlow fyre. The firſt water is caſt away, but the ſecond is kept whiche hath a goulden colour, and a litle before the end reed. The vſe of this water is for wemen to their hear, that they may growe, be ſoft and yelow being moyſtened therwith ſpecially in the ſun. It amendeth the ſhedding of the hear. It heeleth ſwelled and blered eyes, and putteth away their watery cootes and their duſkiſhnes:  it heeleth the corners of the eyes that be hurt

and ful of wheales. It heeleth notably the places that be burned, ſpecially them that be ſoft and ten der, ſo that no ſkar or blemyſh ſhall remain. The latter water that is rediſh, purgeth corrupt mattier in roten byles, if thei be waſhed therwith, and lynnen clothes moyſtened therein be layde vpon them, and whē it hath purged them, it rayſeth the fleſhe alſo. Ryffius. Reed Vlſtadins..

Nowe that iuice whiche is ſumwhat fat, conteineth ſo muche the more oyle, as it is in the more maſſy or dry nature, as that which is more pure and les watery. Gnaiacum bycauſe it ſinketh in water, aboundeth therewith. Thinner and lyghter woodes conuert and turne the fat iuice in to Gum or Roſyn, wherfor they haue les plenty thereof: ſuche as be  more maſſy and thicker &amp; heuier reteine the ſame, as Gnaiacum, the walnut trie, the Aſh.
            Moreouer the very aſhes ſhew that Oyll is in all woodes: for the aſhes of euery one haue their fatnes, whiche it leeueth in lie. So durable is the aery fatnes and yet more the fyery, as when erth is burned, the water goeth out in vapours, the other remain, part in the aſhes, parte in the Sout: although in both thoſe alſo ſum ſubſtaūce of erth remaineth. But thies thinges perteine to Philoſophers. 
            
         
         
            
            
               Hovv oile muſt be dravvn oute of ſpices, as Cloues, Nutmegs, Saffron, Mace, and other.
            MOyſting meſurably in Aqua vitae rectified &amp; circulated, any kind of ſpice what ye will beaten and broken ſomewhat groſe, and when they are ſtiept together, at the laſt deſtil them wyth a very ſlowe fyre. And when as the Aqua vitae once drawne out cleane, the oyle beginneth to ſtill, thē 
                take the matter of ye ſpicesout of the cucutbita and put it in a little bag wel knit and tied wt a thred: &amp; in a pres for ye purpoſe pres it out, both ye iron plates of the pres wel made hot firſt. The oyle preſſed out ſo muſt ye deſtil, rectify and circulate: that the pure oyle maye be ſeparated from the groſſer matter. The dregs afterward may be digeſted or putrified again with the Aqua vitae firſte ſeperated from them (and be deſtilled again.) And thys waiſemeth to be the moſt commodious and moſt  profitable among other, Ryffius: but we haue trā
               ſlated it as well as we mighte, ſomewhat darker then it ſhoulde be.
         
         
            
               Hovve oile is dravvne out of vvodes and other like, as Cloues by deſtillacion oute of Cardan.
            
            THe thinges beaten are put in a veſſel of glaſſe A. &amp; are deſtilled wyth as eaſy a fire as maye  be: and if it maye be, to get oute the oyle, with hot

water put rounde aboute the Veſſell, it ſhall be muche the better. A  heade of glaſſe. B, is ſet vpon the top of the veſſell, and is clooſed with claye leaſt it brethe oute, whereunto a pipe. C. is adioyned as the faſhion is: to yt an other pipe of glas  
               D. is ioyned, ſo compaſſed with claye that nothinge can breethe oute. This pipe paſſeth throughe a trene Veſſell. E. whyche ye muſt haue alwais ful of very cold water, drawinge oute by the ſpigotte ſo much water as hath gotten any heat and putting in other water again late and newe drawne  oute of the well: for ſo. D. is made coule, and the fumes are not brente, but paſſe into water or into oyle, and beinge tourned by that crooked parte of the pipe whiche ſtretcheth beyonde the veſſell with water, fall droppinge into the veſſell.
            Therefore as I did once ſee it, at the firſt a troubled matter runneth oute, caryinge foorthe the more ſubtill ſubſtaunce of the thinge: after that a more cleare water commeth oute, at the laſt oyle, whiche declareth the ſauoure rather of a thynge 
               
burnt, then of that thinge wheroute it ranne. In this manner the deſtillacion of waters alſo (of herbes and floures) maye be done: but that waye is far better which is by deſcencion downwarde &amp;c. Some put Muſke aboute. F. and other precious ſmellinge thinges, and the water that rettineth the ſmelles not onlye of the owne proper matter, but alſo of the Muſk and of other things that be put to it.
            Of deſtillation by deſcencion or going downewarde.  
               Vlſtadius in his .xix. Chapter teacheth of this waye of deſtillinge vniuerſallye: and ſpeciallye or ſeuerallye of oyles of Iuniper ſtickes, of the yelkes of Egges, Nutmegges, and Benedicto: where throughe I wyll go aboute to declare the matter moore clearelye and more ſhortlye. He teacheth to make a fornace meete for this deſtillacion, lyke to ſuche a Chunney as is vſed to be made amongſte the Germaines, of brickes vnbrente of a Cubit and a halfhie, on euerye  ſyde, ſaue the former ſide (whiche maye be ſomewhat lower, and couered with thinne tiles, to lay any thing vpon, as the iron inſtrumentes wherewith the fire is gouerned) in bredthe .iii. cubites euerye waye. In the middle of thys fornaice let there be a hoole ſo great that a mans fote may be put in at it.
            This fornace ſhall be meete alſo for an other vſe, that is to ſeale wyth the ſeale of Hermes, as they call it: when the mouthe of a Glaſen Cucurbita 
               
               
beynge put into the hoole of the fornace, the length a hande bredth, that is .iiii. fingers, and if any more about it be open, that being ſtopt wyth claye, aſſone as it is red hotte, it is nipte together with a paire of tonges likewiſe red hotte. When thou wylte deſtyll therefore in this fornace, take a Cucurbita of the beſt earthe: or if not, of Coper or Latin: ſyll it vnto the thyrde parte wyth the matter that is to be deſtilled, and ſhitte it wyth a verye thinne iron lidde of iron plate full of lyttle  hooles. Then tourne it vpſide downe and putte the mouthe of the Veſſell into the hoole of the fornace three fingers deepe, and what ſo euer is open on anye ſide, fyll it with claye diligentlye rounde aboute, ſo that nothynge maye fall into thys hoole. Beneathe in the neather parte of the hoole thou ſhalt ſette vnder a Cucurbita of glaſſe (for the puttinge in and takinge oute whereof, and that thou mayſte ſee when the hoole matter is deſtilled, the foore parte of the fornace muſte  be open:) whereunto the mouth of the vpper Cucurbita muſt be ioyned, (but not with clay.) Then let a fyre be made aboue aboute the veſſel that cō
               teineth the matter on euerye ſyde. But the fyre at the fyrſte muſte be little, and as farre of from the veſſell as is poſſible: afterwarde by little and little to make it bigger and nearer the veſſell.
            Ye muſte vnderſtande that of euerye matter, at the fyrſte water deſtilleth, moore or leſſe accordynge to the difference of the matter. 
            
            
               
When it hath left running, and now the oyll hath begun to deſtill, thou ſhalt empty the Cucurbita of glas that ſtandeth vnderneth, and ſet it vnder aagain: and continue in encreeſing the fyer, and to make it euer nerer and nerer the veſſell, vntill no more oyl deſtille. For then by and by the fyer muſt bee remoued far of that the vpper Cucurbita may be couled. Then take away the nether that is the receiuer, and kepe the oyll. But as I ſaid, a lytle fyer is required at the firſt, and is to be encreeſed  by litle and litle vntill the fourthe degree, for two cauſes. Firſt leſt by the ſodein exces of to muche heet all the moyſture, yea the oyly moyſture alſo be conſumed, which chiefly muſt be taken hied of, when we couet to haue oyll of the yolkes of egges and nutmegs: for in certain other, as of Iuniper ſtickes, a man ſhal offende nothing to make a ſodein and great fyer. Then bycauſe the woode ſet on fier, perauenture would hurte the Cucurbita, burn it, breeke it, or infect the oyll with ſum vnpleſaunt  ſauour. Moreouer in ſimple oyll Benedict, thou ſhalt encreaſe the fyer only at the end of the deſtillacion: and thou maiſt prepare ſuche a place for the deſtillacion: Dig a pit in the earth, long, brood and diep, accordining to the meaſure of the pot that is to be put into it. Let the pot bee glaſed, waſht with water, and vpon the mouth of it let a thin iron plate be put, bored through with many holes, ſo that the plate be a fingar thicknes within the brim of the pot: vpon this ſet an other  pot that conteineth the matter to be deſtilled, ſo yt
               
the mouthes of them be ioyned together, and all well clayed, then let a fyer be made about the vpper pot, whiche ſhalbe hool without the pit ſaue ye mouth. But this ſecond way is not ſo cōmodious as the firſt: becauſe the water can not bee ſeparated from the oyl: nor eaſely knowē whan the hooll matter is deſtilled, except it be knowen by vſe and cuſtome. The fornace may alſo be made in a ſtiep hill: as the ſame Vlſtadius ſheweth: I let that pas that I be not to long. 
            
            Oyl of the leeues of Citrum, or Orenge, Arantia, or Limons when it is deſtilled, firſt the water is gotten out (then the oyll) and both ought to bee kept ſeuerally: the oyll is very ſwiet and good. It is made on this wyſe. Take the leeues of any of the forſayd tries which ſo euer ye will, when they are cut beet them in a morter, and as ye deſtill them receiue the water: and when ye ſee any drop of diuers colour ſwym vpon the water, the receyuer being chaunged, encrees the fyer and gather  the oyll. It ſhall ſmell a litle of the fyer, whiche fault ſhalbe amended, if ye let it ſtande long ſet in the ſun. Sum drye the forſayde leeues between twoo lynnen clothes and beete them: they put to alſo many odoriferous &amp; ſwiet ſmellyng thinges, as ziuet, Muſke, Ambra, hoot Styrax, Ladanum, Cinamon, Benzoum: not the ſubſtaunce of them, but the fume or ſmoke only: for they put thies into Roſe water vpon the fyer, and with the vapour of them they ſeaſon the leues. When thies are ſo diligently  ſeaſoned, they take Rooſewater wherein

certain ſpices ar ſtiept, as Cloues, Galangal, Put megges. &amp;c. for the ſpace of one day, and the pouder of the leues moiſtened therwith, they deſtill it it aſhes with a ſlow fyer, till the watery liquor be ſeparated: then they encrees the fyer and receiue the oyll, whiche is of a wonderfull pleaſaunt and ſwiet ſauour. Furner.
            
            A certain practicioner ſhewed me, that the oyll is ſeparated cōmodiouſly from herbes &amp; routes in this maner. Put the herbes or routes in Turpentyn  or Larigna, roſin waſht (eigth or nyne tymes) till it wax whyte, and let it ſtande in hoote ſand q. ſ. Then deſtill them with a ſlow fyre, &amp; the Turpintyn ſhal run out firſt▪ by and by at the beginning: or if it moue but a litle, being ſhaken together it ſhal then run out hoolly, firſt in a colour whyte as milke, afterward yelowe. Thou ſhalt perceiue by the taſt whan the liquor that thou deſireſt beginneth to runne out: when the colour is chaunged, thou ſhal chaūge alſo the receiuer, that  thou maiſt receiue it ſeuerally, for the laſt liquor is not ſo good, and is to be vſed without the body, but the firſt within the body. Thies ſaith he, I my ſelfe as I thinke, ſawe once oyll of the beries of Iuniper prepared in this wyſe.
            Suche deſtilled oyles as be to be miniſtred wt in the body, al muſt be mixt with ſum liquor, wyn Meed, or Syrup with ſum deſtilled water, or other medicine: As wee ſhall declare alſo hereafter emong the balſameles. And this is it  that Practicioners dooe ſaye. That vnto Oyles

oyles as vnto ſpirites or ſoules, ſum body ought to be added.
         
         
            Of oils of flovvers.
            
               OYll of Saffron is prepared thus: Thy matter is digeſted by ſprinckling Aqua vitae vpon it, and when the Aqua vitae is drawen out by deſtillacion, the other liquor is wrong out with a pres, as it is wryten  afore of the generall deſtillacion of ſpyces, out of Ryffius.
            
            Oyl of Spick, out of the Frenche booke of Furnerius. Set the herb (the flowers rather) of Spik or Lauendar a whyle in the ſun, then drawe out the water in a lēbeck. This ſet in the ſun in ſummer in a very hoote place bringeth forth an oyl in the ſuperficiall or vpper part of it, whiche beyng ſeparated now and then frō the water, thou ſhalt reſerue. For it both ſmelleth moſte ſwietly, and is  holſum againſt diuers diſeaſes, ſpecially ſuch as be could: and taketh away painfull grieues.
            An other way of the ſame mans. Thou ſhalt ſtiep in a glas the flowers of Spick well rypened in as much as thou thinkeſt good of Oyll of ſwiet Almondes, in hors dong .xl. daies. Then deſtill them with a ſlowe fyer: at laſt rectify them in the ſun, the veſſel diligently ſtopt. But if there be any ſmell of aduſtion or brentnes, make .ii. or .iii. litle hooles in the couer. So ſhall it remayne purged  in the ſun, good and odoriferous.
            
               
The thirde waye of the ſame mannes. Fyll a glaſſe with the floures of Spike well ripened, ſhit it, and euery day put as much to it as ye can. Do this continually for the ſpace of .viii. dayes: then ſtop the veſſell and putrifye it in hors donge iii. monthes. At the length deſtill it a lembek with great diligence, and when the oyl is drawne oute ſet it in the ſunne, ſo that thou ſeperat alway that is clearer and reſerue it Some as ſoone as the matter is drawne forth from the fire (ſo is it in  the frenſhe boke, but I thincke it ſhoulde be from the dong, that is the hors dong wherin it is ſtiept iii. monethes) ſet it in the Sunne, and the oyle that ſwimmeth aboue they remoue it awaye euerye foote. But when the flowers haue lefte nowe yelding of oyl, wring it as hard as ye can, and the iuyce that is preſt out, let it ſtand in the ſunne in a veſſel ſet on the one ſide lening that the oyl ſwimming aboue maye the more eaſilye be ſeparated. So ſhall ye haue a wonderfull well ſmelling oyl  withoute all diſcommoditie of aduſtion or brentnes: Thus far Furnerius.
            
            The ſame oyle Ryffius ſaithe is made, as oyle of Rooſemary, the floures being cut and ſtiept in olde wine, then deſtilled, ſo that the ſpirites of the lembecke be couled. &amp;c. Reade before in the oyl of Rooſemary. Some ſell this oyle of Spike commonlye and name it Balme, with tables wherin the vertues of it are deſcribed. It is very hot and dry. I knewe a woman whiche receiued into her  body not paſt a drop or. ii, &amp; yet it put her in great

ieopardy: but therewith ſhe auoyded manye wormes. It is mixte with many thinges, chieflye for the ſmelles ſake. One droppe of it chafed wyth a greate quantitye of water, maketh it all ſwiete ſmellinge. Phiſicians alſo mixte it with Oyles and hotte oyntmentes, bothe becauſe of the ſauoure, that it maye encreaſe the pleaſauntneſſe of thinges that be ſomwhat ſwiet of them ſelues, and to conſerue them, or els to hide and cloke an euill ſmell: for it ouercometh all ſmels, and perauenture  a man ſhall not find anye liquor bothe ſo ſtrong and ſo ſwiet ſmellinge. It ſemeth that far ſwieter is made of Spike then of Lauender.
            Oyle of Rooſemarye that is in ſtied of Balme. Take a Phiall full of the floures of Rooſemary: burye it in ſande (ſhitte with a double cerecloth, or with waxe and a couer ſo that it maye brethe, Atnold: wyth a double linnen, and then alſo wyth waxe to be cloſed, Hollerius:) til the middle of the veſſell: and let it ſtande ſo a month or more, vntil  the floures be turned into water. This water ſeparated and ſet in the Sunne .x. or .xx. daies (otherwiſe .xl.) it will become thicke like Oyle. It ſtrengtheneth the harte, the braine, the ſinnewes and the hoole bodye. It putteth away the ragges of the eies and ſpottes of the face: it conſerueth youthe. A drop of it put into balme water, goeth to the bottome like Balme. It is good for webs and teares, (otherwiſe ſpots and other diſeaſes) of the eien if one drop be put into the eyen, twyſe  or thriſe at the mooſt. Members ſick of the palſy

it heateth them for the mooſte parte, and healeth them ſometimes. It reſiſteth ſalſfleem. Fiſtulaes and Cancars that geue not place to other medicines, it healeth them throughlye. Aqua vitae deſtilled of wine, wherin Roſemary is decocted and ſod, dothe the ſame thinges. Lullius. I would not ſethe the Rooſemary: for the ſtrength of the wine and quinteſſence dothe fume oute in vapours: but I wolde ſtepe them in a veſſell cloſed, or putrifie them: then firſte in Balneo Mariae, afterwarde in  aſhes pouring the water again vnto the dregges woulde I deſtill them. And of my minde is Arnold de villa noua, whiche in his booke of wine, (where he wryteth of the oyle alſo of Roſemarye the verye ſame thinges, whiche we reherſed now out of Lullius, if ſo be they be Lullius words.) Of tentimes (ſaith he) haue I tried that Aqua vitae, made of wine wherin Roſmary hath bene mollified, cureth ſalſfleum, ſcabs, cankar, and the fiſtula, whiche cannot be healed otherwiſe. But thys  oyl of Roſmary is made none otherwiſe then the oyl of the floures of Verbaſcum not by deſtillatiō.
            Oyl of Roſemarye ſhoulde be made of floures cropt of with the toppes of the tender buddes or bowes wherin they are ſprung, pund and ſtiepte or putrified in veri good old wine. They ought to be deſtilled with a ſlow fire, ſo y• the ſpirits of the lembek be now and thē couled, afterwarde to be circulated, till yt all the gros matter be ſeparated from the ſubtill as muche as is poſſible: Gualterus 
                
               Ryffius. It may be deſtilled, as I coniecture,

ether in a Cucurbita, ſpeciallye ſomewhat ſhorte, with a limbeck: or in a croked ſtill with a receiuer of a diuers figure and faſhion, or rather in two croked ſtils, wherof the one maye be the receiuer, or els in braſen veſſels whiche the Apothecaries call bladdars as water of Cinnamon, or burninge water.
            In like manner be oyles deſtilled, as the ſame man teacheth of Vernix or Gum of Iuniper: of the floures of Spike or Lauender, of Anes ſedes and many other ſedes. 
            
            The .iiii. eſſence or fyre, of Selandin, whyche is like a liquor of oyle. &amp;c. how it is prepared and to what vſe, read before, wher we haue entreated of quint eſſence. It is poſſible alſo to draw out .ii. maner of oyles, an aiery and afyerye oute of the moſte herbes and other medicines, after the ſame maner it is preſcribed there in Selandine.
            Oyl of Rue. Cardanus in his ſecond booke of ſubtiltie, wryteth that there be certaine poyſones which ſlee with the only touching. Againſte theſe  (ſaith he) the remeady is, not to tary in anye place vntil the hand wax hot: often waſhing of thepartes with warme water: alſo the annoynting with oyle of Rue, not with the commun oyl, but that is made after the ſame maner that oyl of Spik and oyl of Cloues is wont to be made of them yt make painting colours. Theſe writeth he. Of oyl of the 
                  •
               eedes of Rue, ſhortlye hereafter we ſhall wryte out of Lullius: but that wherof Cardanus maketh  mencion heare, I ſuppoſe it is to bee made of

Rew it ſelf, that is of the extreme toppes of the bowes therof whiche floriſhe.
         
         
            Of oils of ſiedes and fruites,
            
               OYll of Cloues did I taſt once in Italy wonderfull ſwiet and ſtronge: howe it ſhould be drawen oute, we declared afore with Catdanus wordes, where we write generally of drawing out of oyles: alſo another  way out of Ryffius (that is) the ſame waye yt ye may out of what ſpyce a man will, which ſtiept in burning water, they deſtill thē till the burning water be ſeparated, and as ſone as the oyl beginneth to run, the matter taken out of the Cucurbita is preſt. &amp;c. as before it is written out of Ryffius, who deſcribeth alſo particularly the vertues of this Oyll.
            Oyl of Nutmegges how it may be gotten out, fee before where as we entreated generall of the  deſtillacion of Oyles by deſcention or dounward. Oyl of Nutmegges and of his huſke mace, is drawen out after the ſame maner as out of Cloues: Ryffius, who deſcribeth the vertues of ether of them ſeuerally.
            Oyll of Anis ſied is drawē out (as out of other dry thinges whiche be in the kynd of plantes) the ſiedes well beeten ſtieped in the beſt wyne, then deſtilled by litle and litle by aſcencion, ſo that the ſpirites in the Lembeck bee continually refrigerated  and couled, &amp;c. and the liquor afterward circulated.

The vertues of it Ryffius rekoneth, we leue them out as alſo of other for the moſt parte, where no peculiar effect or working is attributed to the waters and oyles, yea the ſame ar agreable to this medicines alſo wherout they be drawen, or euer they be deſtilled, ſauing that by deſtilling they are made more ſubtill and more effectuall or ſtronger operacion.
            Oyles of the beries of Iuniper and of the beries of Bayes, are made one waye: that is pund,  ſtiep in wyne or rain water, they are deſtilled the ſame way that burning water is, ether in a braſen bladder as the Apothecaries name it, or in ſuche wyſe as we deſcribed oyll out of Cardan, to be goten out of woodes and cloues: or els as out of ſpyces, by Ryffius deſcription. I thinke it makes no great matter, ſo be that the ſpirites which be caried about the lembeck, may be couled commodiouſly in it and in the noos.
            The vertues of thies oyles Ryffius rekoneth  vp. Agyrtae or iugleres alſo ar wont with vs to ſel oyl of Iunipers, with tables imprinted cōteining the reherſal of the vertues therof. This emongſt other heeleth them that be ſick of a tercian as I am infourmed.
            Sum make oyll of wheet preſſing it oute betwene two iron plates reed hoot: other thinke it to be nothing worth thatis made thus, and that it ſhould be made as oyll of Iuniper, that is of the ſtickes of Iuniper by deſcencion or dounwarde.  
               Meſue ſaith that wheet after it be huſked is deſtilled

in a veſſell of ſublimaciō, as the Philoſophers oyll. It cureth ring wormes, and ruggednes of the ſkin whiche ſpringeth of drynes, it mollifieth and moyſteneth, and other infections, alſo of the ſkin it remedieth them. It is deſcribed alſo by Raſus in his Antidotarium. Loke within emōgſt the oyles not deſtilled. There might be made alſo of Barly and ſuche both by ſublimacion, and alſo by deſcencion. Monachi vpon Meſue.
            
            Oyles of Muſke ben, (that is Balanus my repſica,) 
                whiche Fnrnerius calleth Retraban or retraha, of moſte precious ſmel. Lyke as of Almondes, ſo ſhalt thou preſſe out an oyll of the fruites of Ben (which ar found about Genua plēteouſly inough, of the ſame pryce almoſt that Almondes be) thou ſhalt let it ſtand, and put a good quātitie of muſk into it, and ſo in a glas well ſtopt, thou ſhalt ſet it in a ketle that it may ſeeth a whyle, then receiue the oyll by deſtillacion, whiche ſhalbe moſte ſwiet and moſte odoriferous. 
            
         
         
            
               Certain oyls of ſiedes vvhiche I founde in a booke of Waters of Raimund Lullius.
            
            THis oyles I thought good to wryte ſeuerally, becauſe I doubt whether the author woulde haue them made by deſtillaciō or ſimpely by preſſing out: in euery one he addeth thies wordes and let an oyll be drawen out after the maner of the  lay people. With whiche woordes he ſeemeth

to ſignify, ſimpely by the preſſing out of the ſiedes in a pres, as the commun people is wont to doo, ſo is oyll to be gathered, ſpecially when as he would haue it drawen out of the ſame dryed in the ſun. Notwithſtanding it is out of all doubt, that the ſame thinges deſtilled accordingly, ſhould bee far moore effectuall: But for deſtilling, the liquor wherin the ſiedes pund or ſtiept ougth to be left with them and putrification to go before. &amp;c.
            Stiep the ſiedes of Sponſa ſolis in womans  milke forty daies and then make an oyll after the vſe (maner) of the lay people. Loke before amōgſt the coſmeticall and garniſhing liquors.

A ſextarye or pinte of bearies, as they call it in Alſatia, aboute iiii. ounces of oyle. Other to ſeparate the Oyle from the water, put it into a drincking glas that hathe the foote taken awaye ether by commynge with a wyer of iron redde hotte, or els by chaunce ſo that a little hoole in the bottome be lefte for the  water paſſeth throughe, and when it comes to the

            An other waye of preparing the ſame by deſcencion  downewarde, communicated and ſhewed vnto me as a ſecreate thing, by a certain frend who prepared and made it ſo his ſelfe. Gather Iuniper bearies well rypened and drye in harneſt or a little befoore Harueſt, betwene the two Marye daies as they be appoynted in the Kalendar, in the morninge at eighte or nyne of the clocke, in greate plentye, as manye as will fill a couple of bagges, whiles it is fayre weather.
            Then beinge well beaten, thou ſhalt putte them  vppon a heare clothe ſuche as bakers do vſe, and preſſe them vnder a preſſe, and leaue them ſo a daye and a nighte in the preſſe, that the waterye iuice in the meane ſeaſon maye droppe oute: whiche thou ſhalt keepe by it ſelfe in ſome veſſell, that thou maiſte vſe it bothe to certain medicins with in the bodye, and alſo withoute for the pryckinge of partes (with ſome oyntmente and Aqua vitae,) ſpeciallye the arthritical partes and ioyntes, this iuice is eaſelye conſerued, neither is it corrupted 
               
lightlye, it is alſo ſwiete and effectuall or ſtronge. Some get out the waterye humor not by a pres, but ſeparate it in a commun fornace, (Balneo Mariae.) The reaſt of the matter well dried and beaten, put it in a Cucurbita that is hable to receiue a galon, but thou ſhalt not fill it vp. In it (ſhit with the clay of wiſdome leaſt anye thinge brethe oute) ſhalt thou putrify the matter, about .xxviii. daies in hors donge: or if it be winter (in Germany) nye vnto the fornace, for to putrifye it in hors donge a  pit muſt be made .ii. fote depe, and dong and lime to be laide in it by courſe: and thou ſhalt ſprinckle it with hot water euerye daye or euery other day. At lengthe when the matter is putrified inough, and appeareth to bee indifferentlye liquide, thou ſhalt deſtill it. The veſſell that receiueth it let it be of the ſame bigneſſe almooſte that the other is, and lette it ſtande vppon a rounde wreethe of ſtrawe. Boothe of them oughte to be of glaſſe and cutte with an iron wyer redde hotte. Thou ſhalt  ioyne them together wyth a plate betwixte of metal (the beſt of Siluer) boored throughe with manye little hooles, whiche ſhall be no bigger then if they were made with a commun niedle.

The clay ought to be tempered with ſalt water &amp; flox: this) ſum cal clay of wiſdome. The maner of the fornace is this: In the midſt muſt a floor or chamber be made with a hooll, as I ſaid: aboue  this floor about the Cucurbita is ſand layd almoſt til the third part of the Cucurbita: aboue the ſand, cooles burning, more then the third parte of the Cucurbita, nether nedeth it to put away the aſhes: the reſt of the Cucurbita, the fourth part perauenture, or litle les then the third part muſt be aboue empty and at libertie.

The gums ſo reſolued, yelded an oyll troubled and pudly, whiche being deſtilled in a crouked ſtill (as they call it) ſhalbe made moore cleere and pure. For al gums, and Caphura alſo, ſeing they contein a fat liquor and whyt, that whiche by deſtillacion is drawen from them, doo eaſely ſauour of the iniury of the fyer &amp; faut of brentnes, that although they be deſtilled in veſſels very meen, yet iſſueth forth a licour full of dregs, gros, brent, &amp; of an vnpleſaunt  ſmell, the vſe wherof doth not plees me, noo not without the body, muche les within the body: the ſtrengthes &amp; vertues of them is not alyke. When the matter is ſo reſolued yu ſhalt ſtraine it through a wollē cloth or a hear cloth, yt what ſo euer erthynes is in it, may be ſeparated from the ſande and dros.

Cinnamō may be ſtiept about viii. daies in burninge water .vi. times deſtilled, and thē be deſtilled, as I was informed of a frēd. Here wil I rehearſe alſo the waye to make water (as they call it) of Cinnamon: for in the deſtillation  alſo hereof oyl foloweth at length, although but litle and becauſe of the diſcommodity of aduſtion and brētnes, vnprofitable to be vſed within the body: but ye water is moſt noble &amp; moſt profitable, y• deſcription wherof a certain frēd of late ſēd vnto me, on this wiſe.

or rather longer, an other ſhewed vs he had ſeene in the deſtillacion of this water: but perauēture it ſhalbe les nied of ſuch a long one, whē no great plenty of water is deſtilled.)

The water yt runneth out firſt is ſōwhat thick like oyl: but ther muſt be diligent hede taken that aſſone as it ſhal chaung the colour, yt the receiuer alſo be chaūged. The ſecōd water runs ſōwhat whiter: thē chaūg it again &amp; take an other receiuer, &amp; ſo forth til the dregs iſſue out. The water of the fourthe chaunging is moſt clere, which when it begins to wax yelow, ſtreightway the couer &amp; the pipe muſte be  takē away becauſe ye buſines is now ended &amp; al ye vertue of the Cinnamon is drawn out. This hole matter may be don in .iii. or .iiii. houres, but there muſt be a cople of mē about this deſtillacion: the one to mark the alteration of the liquors, and ſee that the fire be no bigger then it oughte, and that the liquor run not to faſte oute: The other ſhall ſee that the Veſſell wyth coulde water, where through one part of the pipe paſſeth, be according as it ſhoulde be, and that the pipe be not to hotte:  wherefore nowe and then chaunging the water, he ſhall poure in coulder oute of ſome Veſſell by,

and put linnē clouthes dipt in could water about the pype, and about the couer lykewyſe if it be too hoot. For it ſkilleth much that thies partes be couled that both more plenty of water and alſo better may run out. This water of Cinamon I haue ſene my ſelf and taſted, very pleſaunt and ſwiet in ſauour and in taſte.

The ſame almoſt Cardanus wryteth generally, of liquors of ſwiet woodē thinges as Cloues. &amp;c. This liquor reſtoreth the ſtrength excellently: the other vertues thereof Ryffius deſcribeth: but euery man may know thē manifeſtly by the nature of cinamon it ſelfe.
            In lyke maner is the oyll of the huſke of Nutmegges whiche they call Mace, prepared, which alſo is deſcribed by Ryffius.

That kind of this tree is thought beſt that  groweth not in watery places. To thies y• ſhalt ad

The vpper pot thou ſhalt fill with ye chips of Iuniper and alſo of that whyt Popler whiche they cal trembling, with a part of the whyt ſtones wherof lyme is made: after when thou haſt fenſed the couer wel with clay, put it into the nether and  make a fyer round about it. This oyll alſo made of only Iuniper, for the moſte parte, is miniſtred without the body: for it is very vehement, and ſanoureth very much of brentnes.

The biggar veſſell alſo may be of metall, or if it be of glas or ſton, let it be well fenſed all ouer with clay of wiſdome, an erthen veſſell becauſe it is ſpongi &amp; not ſo cloos, when the oyll ſeketh to breeth out it would gyue it way: therfore let it be glaſed within, the nether  veſſell and receiuer may bee of glas, not clayedd

only in the circuit but ſomwhat more thik, it may be alſo of metal: it may be at length of earth, ſo be that it be glaſed and oyled as they call it: els that moſt thin oyl wold run out here and there by the pores of the veſſel: much les may that oyl be receiued ſafe in the pit within the grounde hauing the ſides walled with potters earth, (which notwithſtanding Meſues commaunded.) Take this withall, that it ſhal not be nedeful to dig the leſſer veſſel within the ground, if thou canſte finde a meanes  to beare vp the cooles and woode, with ſome floore as it were, to compas the bigger veſſell aboute with.

            Oyl of aſhe tre helpeth them that be ſick of the ſplene, beſides that it can do all that oyl of Iuniper can, and is made after the ſame maner Meſues. Wher again Syluius ſaith. That oyl anoynted vpon the left ſide vnder the ſhort ribs, and drunken, deliuereth mightely the obſtructions &amp; ſtoppings of the ſplene: it mollifieth alſo &amp; digeſteth. 
            
            This oyl (ſaithe Rogerius) repreſſeth the colde greues of the ioynts: it healeth a wound &amp; bryngeth ſkin where it lacketh: it deliuereth from the white morphew, and blackeneth it.

But I think the oyl of the ſame wod, deſtilled after y• maner  that the chymiſtes call by deſcencion, to be far

more effectual, anoynting the places therewith yt ſwel and wher the grefe is. They be wont alſo of the ſhauings of raw wode, ſodden in ſome noble wine, putting vnto it old oyl, to prepare an oyntment which is very good to be annoynted vppon the places where the grefe is.

                  BAlſamum is a word vſed almoſt in  all tonges, a Syrian worde without dout: for in only Syria &amp; in one only garden did it ones growe. Panag ye hebrew worde in the .xxvii. of Ezechiel, Dauid Kimhi after certaine doth erpound it a proper place of Iudaea: other Apharſamon, that is Balſamum. The later wryters of the Iewes wryt Palſamon: Mycander Balſamō
                bycans of the vers. Opobalſamon is a liquor: Carpobalſamon a ſied, whiche ſum call alſo Caſamum: 
                and they ſay it is ſwieter ſmelling then the liquor it ſelfe: Xylobalſamum, bowes or the wood. I imagined once that it was called Balſamum of the excellencie, bycauſe it was moſte precious &amp; moſte noble of all ſpyces: for Boal ſignifyeth lorde and maiſter with the Hebrewes and Sam ſpyce. Balſamon, is an aromaticall flower, Varinus. And in died it is reaſon, that as the thing it ſelf is proper to Syria, ſo the etimology and interpretaciō of the worde ſhould be taken of the ſame tong.

               Balſamum or Balm ſum in our age thinke it is loſt, the iuice of it was of the colour of gould, it he led woundes, and toke away wrinkles, and kept the faces of deed men from corruptiō: it brake alſo the ſtone in the reines, it did put away the ſpottes  of the eyes, reſiſting poyſon, ſpecially Aconitum, Hemloke, and the ſhaking of very feuers, and in all thies thinges the vertues of Balm excelled. But now ther is another kynd of Balm brought out of Spain, of a red colour tēding toward blak, weighty, ſauouring ſumwhat of aduſtiō or brentnes, and by and by it ſtryketh &amp; perceth the heed, and the tounge alſo ſharpely, but ſumwhat longe firſt as peper. And it alſo heeleth newe woundes more quikly then any other thinge: and taketh away  wrinkles. I could wel beleue that this kynd of oyll is effectuall and good, thof not for all that the trewe Balm is, yet ſurely to the moſte parte. The tree that bringeth this oyll is called Goacomax, of the form of a Pomgranat tree and in bignes almoſte lyke: but it hathe a lief a litle biggar and a thinner barck as though it were drye, the wood of it burneth lyke a torche, the fruite is as the cluſters of grapes, but the kurnelles are ſumwhat biggar, of a wyny colour, whiche together  with the ſlippes or braunches ſodden long in water,

doo yield that kynd of oyll, Cardanus.
            
            Certaine marchauntes affirme that the gardeines of Balme were deſtroyed, what tyme as Zelimus the Turck, the predeceſſor of Solyman, wan Chayrum, whan the Turkes killing the gardeners, did not forthwith put other in their places the yere of our Lorde. 1516. Moreouer they ſay there is a Balm tree of an indifferent bignes laid to kepe to be compared vnto many thouſandes of Ducates, with the moſte famous mā of our time,  an other Lucullus, Maiſt.

               Antibalſama. Dioſcorides preſcribeth certaine notes and tokens of the trewe Balm. In the collection and table of thoſe medicines that may bee vſed one in ſteed of another, which is ioyned with Galenus workes, and in the ende alſo of Aeginetas bookes, we reed: In the ſteed of ye liquor of Balm, Mirh that deſtilleth, that is liquid and runninge  Mirh which is called Stacte. In the ſame place is red alſo: In the ſteed of Opobalſamū
                the liquor of Myrti: but it ſemeth it ſhould be more rightly ye liquor of Mirh. Auicenna in his ſecond booke in the chapt. of oyl: In ſteed of Balm (ſaith he) is liquid Mirh vſed, or els lyke weight of the oyl Adhii, or Aldadi, or Dadi as Bellunenſis trāſlated it. Raſis in the latter ende of his Antidotarie ſeparated, in oyl Benedict or of tylſtons: It is of like force (ſaith he) yt oyl of Balm: but it is more ſubtil &amp; hoter &amp; more  proffitable in cold diſeaſes, Monaci vpon Meſuen.
               
And a litle after, in the tretis quid pro quo, what for what, whiche is imprinted with the bookes of the ſun of Meſue, it is red. In the ſtede of Balm, Turpintyn deſtilled, or oyll of Bayes, or the gum of Iuy is put. But what Dadi is, I can not eaſily ſay: it is deſcribed of Auicen the. 213. chapt. Bellunenſis nether there nor in the gloſes expoundeth what it is. It is a grain (ſaith Auicenna) lyke vnto barly longar, more ſtrait and cloos together, more maſſy, bitter, could, declyning to heet, &amp; dry  in the ſecond degre: it byndeth the bely, withſtandeth poyſon, it is good for the grieues of the fundament and hemrodes. It reſolueth hardnes. &amp;c. I coniectur it to be CiTum or Ladanum, for it is could alſo, ſo meaſurably yt it hath a warm heet, according to Galenus mynd: it byndeth, ſtoppeth ye bely, and dryeth in the ſecond degree: that is hooter that groweth in hooter places, &amp; the ſame mollifieth meanly and diſſolued, and concokteth or digeſteth. Furthermore in Antiballomenis Graecis, 
                we reed Propolis to be vſed in the ſteed of Tragopogona, that is Ladanum: and Auicenna, in the reſoluing (ſaith he) of hardneſſes, ii. third partes in weight of kur, that is Propolis, and the half of the weight of abhel. Dioſcorides ſaieth that Ladanum is mixt with medicines without ſmell: Auicenna, that it is good for the griefes of the fundament &amp; hemrodes. Now that Auicenna hath, that Dadi is lyke vnto barly, but longar, ſtraiter. &amp;c. I plainly ſuppoſe it to be corrupt out of Dioſcorides, who maketh  
               Ladon that is the buſhe of Ladanū, lyke vnto

               Ciſthum, with longer leues only and more black. Laſt of all the names Ladon and Dadi do not muche diſagree nor be far vnlike.
            Oyl made of the flours of Roſemary (after the ſame maner as it is made of the flours of Verbaſcus) may be vſed in ſtede of balm, and a drop of it put into water, doth likewiſe go to the bottōe: Arnold de Villa noua. They put this alſo emongſt other to be a tokē of true balm, y• it wil gather milk into courds: I going about to try on a time, whether  the ſame could be don with the made balme cōpoſed of turpentin &amp; hot gums, I found that it did not courd it, no the milk was not once broken wt it. The cōmun people with vs, cal oyl deſtilled of ſpik, ſimplely by the name of balm, yt is becaus of the excellente ſwietnes of the ſauor. There be ſom yu cal certain other odoriferous things by the name of balm, ye they think thē to com veri nie to vertues therof, as Ryffiꝰ oil of cloues. In ye greke Antiballominis it is red yt the rotes of white violets  may be ſubſtituted in ye place of Xylobalſanū. The Antiballomena or reherſal of thinges y• may be vſed one for another, which was once imprinted wt 
               Meſues works declare in this wiſe. In ſted of Xylobalſam, the wod of iuy or Leucoradix. For carpobalſā, the frute of iuy or Xylobalſamū
                in like weight. The ſame: &amp; for balme it ſelf, the gum of iuy. But perauēture in al theſe ye expoſiter or trā
               ſlater was deceiued, whan as no wryter euer cō
               pared iuy in any wiſe wt balin: therfor I thought  ether that the tranſlator that tranſlated it out of ye
               
               Arabik tong to haue erred, or rather the Arabians them ſelues, confounding Ciſſon, that is iuy and Ciſthum together: for Ladanum is the iuice of Ciſthum, which Auicenna did put in ſtede of Balm.
            In the Antiballomenis aſſcribed vnto Galen I find theſe alſo: for the liquor of balme, ye liquor of Carpaſus: and for the liquor of Carpaſꝰ, the liquor of Myrtus: and for the liquor of willow, the liquor of black iuye, which the Arabians leuing certaine thinges or chaunging them, tranſlated them into  their works as I cōiecture. ¶ Ther is alſo a certain Caſſia called Balſamodes becauſe of the ſmel. Siſymbrium a kind of wild mint, growing ni waters &amp; for the moſt part ſōwhat red, ye late writers many of thē cal it Balſamita. Ther is an other Balſamina as the Ligures about ye riuer of Poo cal it: The Thuſcans or Florentins cal it the apple of Ieru ſalem, with the leues of the white vine, ye floure of the Cucumer, the frute atboth ends round &amp; ſharp like to a litle cucumer. &amp;c. the apple with ripenes  a ſunder, &amp; when it is broken it appereth empty, conteining within it a few ſeedes in the figure of chit or Lentil, moſte red, wheroute oyle is preſſed chief for wounds. Som ſeaſon the apple fyrſte in oyl &amp; ſet it in the ſun a few daies, then they bery it in hors dong or in the earth ſo long til it be cleane putrified: ſo they affirme it will get the vertue of balm in cloſing of wounds, and thervpon hath it gotten the name of Balſamina: Ruellius out of Her molaus. Braſauolus calleth this oyl of Cochirs: and  the herbe, that beareth thoſe fruites in a rugged

and ſharp huſk, Cochia or Momordica. The oyle (ſaith he) is prepared diuers waies, both by infuſion and being digd vnder the earth many yeres, and by ſeathing: and it is made of Echinus, of the leaues ſeuerally and of the ſedes. That whych is hid in the earth, helpeth the greues of Hemrods. Generally, that oyl aſſwageth all greues, who ſo deſyreth to know mo &amp; verye meruelous effectes of this oyl and herbe, let him read Matthaeolus Senenſis commentaries on Dioſcorides the .iiii. boke  C .lxxxiiii. chap. ſo many and ſo great, that if they be true the true balme may be ſet light by in compariſon of them.

Other do beat in a morter the ſlips of this plant in the beginning of Vere, ſethe it in water, preſſe them in a preſſe, and call it oyle  of Balm. Ther be ſome that when they haue pūd the ſlips, they put them in old oyle and ſet them in the ſunne .xl. daies, ſieth it in a double veſſel, pres it, put new ſlips beaten into it, ſtraine it twiſe or thriſe and ſo keepe it. Meſues, Syluius tranſlating him. Wher Syluius alſo in his ſcoles ſaith: let Xylobalſamum &amp; Carpobalſamum moſt new be ſtiept one day in old oyl: after let ye oyl be drawn out by the art of chymiſts, it ſhalbe of no ſmal eſtimaciō: or ſet Xylobalſamum new be putin old oyl and ſet  in the ſunne .xl. daies, and ſod in a double veſſell.

The vertues of this oyl ſo much praiſed of al mē &amp; nothing ſpokē of Meſue, it is meruel, for it heteth moyſteneth, extenuateth and maketh ſlender, digeſteth, ſcoureth, cloſeth. This vertue of cloſinge ſhe wed vnto the olde writers, maketh it at this day precious. Opobalſamum is moſt rare and geſen: and therfore moſt precious. Wherfore Petrus of Abanus, Guilielmus Placectinus, Bartolemaeus Montaguanus, compoſed an oyl of balme, nothing inferior in vertues to balm. Other put the leues and ſede, and wode of this plant in oyle and ſet it  in the ſunne .xl. daies, then pres it out and kepe it but in bertues it is far inferiorto Opobalſamum: This ſaithe Syluius.

They are deſtilled the moſt part of thē 
                few except, whiche are miniſtred only without the body, as vnto woundes. They are deſtilled in aſſhes chiefly: all firſt with a ſlow fyer, that the cleeteſt matter and more thin or watery may be gotten out, then encreaſing the fier by litle and litle, that the oyll whiche is of a ſumwhat reed colour may be receyued, afterward the fier is made biggar that the oyle may be very reed, and at length inclyne to black. The liquor that iſſueth in the midſt is more allowed to the vſes within the body:  the laſt is ſumwhat to hoot, to vehement and vnpleſaunt, moore miet to be miniſtred withoute where there is nede of more force: as ye firſt where there is nede of litle. The firſt liquor ſemeth to be yielded chiefly of the Turpintyn, for the whiche leſt it ſieth, little pieces of ſlates or flintes may be mixt with it. &amp;c. as we ſaid of the deſtilling of tur pintyn. All of them takē within the body, becauſe of the Turpintyn and gums, they make men beleche, and many times not without grief, and yet  more the middle and laſt liquor being receiued:

They do al ſeaſon the vrin with their ſmel. They muſt all bee receiued within the bodye mixt with ſum liquor, chiefly wyne, ſo that to a ſponful of liquor, one drop of the oyl or .ii. at the moſte be put.

I ſame of late a practicioner deſtilling I can not tel what kynd of Balſam in a pan, with aſhes laid vpon ſlates, as I deſcribed before in the mention of deſtillation  by aſhes: a Cucurbita of glas ſo diep ſet in the aſſhes, that they were not aboue the matter conteined in the veſſell. The veſſell was ful to the middle, able to receiue, if it had been fild vp perauenture, iiii. poundes: he continued this labour .iiii. or .v. daies &amp; nightes alſo, neuer abating the fier. He ſeparated only .ii. liquors, ye firſt whyt, whiche was more plentifull and in gretter abundaunce: then a rediſh, whiche was yielded leſſer by the .iii. part.

it was good to chronicall agues, for the mooſte part he mixed with it ſum ſpyces, as Ginger and Sugar with wyne &amp; the drop of the oyll, that the ſick ſhould les perceiue that he dronk only a drop of the oyll: ſumtymes he would mixt nothing els with the wyne but one drop of this oyll, ſpecially to amende the defaut of a ſtinking breeth. Sumtymes he gaue it in water, other tymes he dropt it into a ſhyue of breed: ſumtymes to flegmatick and gros men, with a ſawce made of muſterd and  peper, bidding them ſweet after it: he ſaid it chaū

It hath the ſame vertues that Balm hath &amp; may be vſed in all thinges in ſteed of it. This Nic. Stokker alſo an excellent  Phyſicion in Germany vſed, but without Turpentin,

if mifrend ſent me the deſcriptiō of it right when it was ready preſt, he addeth at lengthe the Muſk and Ambra, with oyl of tile ſtones, and deſtilled them not as I think. He hathe the former deſcription in Luminari Maiore, as alſo the nexte folowing of Montaguana.
            
            A balm compoſed of Bartolomeus Montaguana out of his Antidotarie the firſt chapter whiche is of oyntmentes. Turpentin a pounde: white frankenſence. iiii, ounces: as much of bay beries: gum  
               Elemi. vi. ounces: Maſtik: Galangal, Cloues, Cinamon, Zedoaria, Nutmeg, Cubebae, Lignum Aloes wel beaten, of euery one an ounce. Let all be deſtilled together, firſt with a ſlow fyre: and firſt ſhall runne oute a water called of Balme. Then when the fire is encreaſed thou ſhalt gather an other water by it ſelf. And do ſo the third time. Thē ſhal deſtil forth balm in all trials. It ſhall be the ſtronger the oftener it is deſtilled.
            Balme of Peter Aponenſis in hys addicion vnto  the booke of Meſues in the treatiſe of oyntinges (for the diſeaſes of the harte.) Mirrh elect, Aloes Hepaticae, Spieaenardi, Sanguis Draconis, Frankenſēce, Mumiae, Opopanax, Serapinum, Crocus, Maſtik, Gumme Arabik, liquid Styrax, of euerye one two ounces, two ounces and a halfe of Ladanum elect, or Caſtoreum: halfe a dramme of Muſcke. Turpentyn as muche as the weighte of all the reaſte breake them that be to be broken and when they are all mixte with the Turpentyne, deſtyll  them wittelye by a lembeck: the arte is lyke as of

water of Rooſes. Theſe ſaith Peter, as the munkes that write vppon Meſuen, ſaide they write it oute of written bookes, farre truer then in the Printed bookes, and it is had in Luminare maiore. Aponenſis ſaith, we finde no mention made by the olde wryters of the annoyntinge of the backe bone, perauenture not bycauſe they were ignorāt in ſo profitable and commendable a thing, but be cauſe they woulde keepe it ſecreate. For this is an excellente helpe, preſeruinge the ſubiect of life  or that which cōteineth the ſame. For the original and beginning of bones and ſinewes is Nucha, &amp; it ſpringeth of the brain. &amp;c. Therfore things annoynted with this ſhalt thou comfort the cloking ſubſtāce (that is the cauls and cotes of the brain) and the ſpiritual ſubſtance and ſinues, and al the bones helping alſo the Palſy &amp; all the diſeaſes of the ſinnewes, alſo the panting &amp; trembling of the hart, &amp; manifeſt werines, and it is the chiefeſt medicin of all other in the ſwifte comforting of the  harte. (After this, deſcribinge the thinge he addeth:) This oyle is verye nye vnto Balme: and accordinge to this waye, the moſte ſubtill of Sophiſters do counterfeit Balme: for amongſt all other wayes this is moſte noble. If deade coorſes be annoynted with this oyle they putrifye not.
            When thou wilte comforte bodies that be extenuated and broughte lowe, thou ſhalt mixte Rooſe water with it, and annoynte it vppon the lower manſions, and from the Nucha vnto the raines.  If the backe bone be annoynted therewith being

ſomewhat warme, an hour before the fit, leauing vppon it the token of it with Pecia, thou ſhalt put awaye the ſhakinge of wandering Agues, and of any ſimple agues. But quartaines and wanderinge Agues it helpeth at the beginnninge of the courſe (this place and they which folow ſeme vnto ſome to bee corrupted in the printed bookes) in the ſwoundinge or debilitie, annoyntinge the extreame partes of the backe boone: that the inſtrumente for the purpooſe maye ſpeake with voyce,  put vnder the tonge of the ſicke a little of it, and after in his eares and noſthrilles if nede require. Thou ſhalt geue of the ſame when neede requireth, in the Stranguling and Suffocation of the Matrix or mother, and in the fallinge ſickeneſſe &amp; manye other diſeaſes. It is miniſtred in weght tree (I thincke he meaneth one grain) with wine that hathe a good ſmell. So it comforteth ye mind and nature, and healeth manye diſeaſes. But chieflye, and is good for them that be Melancholye,  ſadde, and whoſe ſtrengthes and members be feeble, as though they were beaten and wekened by force. For conſuminge Feuers, thou ſhalt mixte with Oyle of Rooſes, or of Maſtike, and annoynte the backe boone of them in a baithe or withoute a baithe. Hitherto wryteth Aponenſis.
            
            The ſame manne willeth to mixte thys compoſicion in the ſteede of true Opobalſamum, wyth Triacle, Mithridatium, Diacurcuma, Aurea Alexandrina. This Oyle (ſaithe he) Epiphanius Empiricus 
                vſeth as the Mother of all remeadies,

to all diſeaſes of the ſinewes, annoynting twiſe a day therewith the Nucha, the back and inynts, for it is plain by manifeſt proues, ſpecially in a colde matter. The ſame man commaundeth to ſtil this oyl in Balneo Mariae, which I like not.
            There is an other compoſicion of VViliam Pla centinus, whiche I finde in the bigger Luminarie in Diacurcuma or Diacrocu, in this wiſe. Take Turpentin .ii. pounds: commun oyl .iii. pound: oyl of bayes .xvi. onnces, Cinnamon .iii. ounces: Euphorbium, 
                Cloues, Bay beries, Gum of Iuy, Serapinum, Galbanum Aromatik, Opopanax, ofeuery one an ounce, Franken ſence, Maſtike of ether ii. vnces. Let ſuch be betē as ſhuld: &amp; thē deſtilled.
            Theſe and certain other diuers balmes dothe Ryffius alſo in his boke of deſtillation deſcribe.
            A quickeninge water and one that procureth youth vnto an old man, out of the boke of Lullius of waters. Turpentyne a pounde: honye halfe a pounde: Aqua vitae thryſe or foure times deſtilled  iii. ounces. Lignum Aloes welbeaten, Sādali muſtatelli, of ether .iii. drams, gumme Arabeck (perauenture a dram): Nutmegs, Ambra, ofether .ii. drams. When they are all pund deſtill them wyth a ſlowe fyre, till ye haue the firſte water cleare. And when the ſecond beginneth to run oute, whithe ſhalbe like to a burning cole, encreaſe the fire by and by and kepe that by it ſelf. Thē encreſe the fire again, &amp; gather the third, which ſhalbe black and thick like hony, til al the liquor be run out. Of  theſe waters ye laſt is hoter then ye firſt &amp; ſeconde.

The firſt is called mother of Balm, the ſecōd oyll of Balm, the third Balm artificiall. The firſt is miniſtred in drink, with warm wyne. The ſecond a
                  •
               d the third ar good to remoue maladies which newly gnawe the fleſhe of mans body. The fyrſt drunke with warme whyt wyne, purgeth the ſtomack from al il humors: and withholdeth the water that it cum not at the hart or principal partes, as it is plain by often experiment. A fyne lynnen clooth moyſtened in this water and thruſt into the  nooſthriles with the litle fingar, whan ye ſick goeth to bed, and left there within, cureth the reum. Being drunck morning and euening, it cureth a ſtinking breth what cauſe ſo euer it cum of. The tieth waſht therwith, are ſtrengthened and made whyt, and ar deliuered from ache whether it cum of a humor, or of putrified bloud. Whatſoeuer ſhal be put into it, it will kepe it ſound and vncorrupt. A linnen cloth moyſted in it, and laid vpon woundes (firſt waſhed therwith) or vpon a fiſtula and  other (angry and ill byles cureth them.) It reſiſteth the quartain ague, if the back boone be rubbed therwith a fewe daies. Scabbednes waſht therwith is made hoole. A linnen clooth moyſtened therin is very good to be layd to ye hemrodes. Wol that groweth on tries or Bombaſe, dipt lightly is this water, is very good to put in the eares againſt any kynd of deafnes. Being anoynted it cureth the rednes of the face: the palſy of the tong, and all cold diſeaſes. The ſecond and third water  are of ſtrength againſt the diſeaſe called Noli me

tangere: againſt the kynges il and alſo the diſſeaſes of the neck and throot. Alſo againſt the fiſtula and the ill diſeaſe called Malus morbus, ſpecially if it be yet but new: for by waſhing it and wetting and oft laing a linnē cloth moyſtened therin vpō it, it is made hool. They help alſo if a mābe beten with ſtones, or clubes or a ſtaf. No poyſon can approche ny vnto them, and a ſpyder touched therewith dyeth. They be anoynted vpon moſte proffitably againſt all palſyes. They ſtrengthen all the  partes of the body being waſht therwith. It is to be noted that the firſt water of thies thre, as generall conteineth all the vertues (of the other.) But to fret the ſecond and the thirde are better, &amp; this more then the other. To be ſhort, they heel all diſeaſes that cum of bloud or putrified fleume.
            In the ſame Lullius a marueilous water is made in this wyſe. Cloues, Nutmegges, Ginger, Zedoaria, Galangal, bothe ſortes of Peper, Iuniper beries, the pilles or barck of Citri or Orēges,  Sage, Baſilicum, Rooſemary, Maioram, round Mint, Bay beries, Peny royall, Gentian, Calamint, ye flowers of Elder, Roſes, Ammens, Spick nard, wood of Aloes, Cubebae, (here ſemeth ſomwhat to be left out) as well wyld as domekical or growing in gardines, Cardamomum, Cinnamō, Calami aromatici, Stichados, Chamaedryos, Chamaepity os, Meliſſae, Maſtick, Olibani, Aloes hepaticae, Anis ſiedes and flowers, ſhe ſiedes of Mug wurt, of euery one an vnce. Put vnto thies dry  figges, Raſins that cum frō beyond ſee, Dait ſtones,

fat ſwiet Almondes, of euery one an vnce. Whyt old hony half a pound. After twys as much Sugar as all the forſaid be. All thies ſhalt thou put into Aqua vitae. v. or .vi. times deſtilled in a lē
               bek of glas, ye 
               Aqua vitae ſhalbe as much as thrys ye weight of all the ſpeces beſides. After thou haſt leſt them ſtand .ii. daies, thou ſhalt deſtill thē with a ſlow fier. The firſt water is moſte cleer &amp; precious. The ſecond differeth in colour, and muſt be receiued in an other veſſel: it is whyt, good towhit  ten the faces of wemen, it taketh all the ſpottes or fracknes from them out of hande, if they be once waſht therwith thre daies: and maketh thē ſwiet ſmelling &amp; cleer. This is called ye water of Balm or mother of Balm: It oughte to be deſtilled in a lembeck, in a baith with a ſlow fyer, with Aqua vitae of the ſame weight. And ye firſt water ſhall run furth odoriferous and maruelous, whiche thou ſhalt receiue by it ſelfe: then an other of the colour of ſafron, the third at length lyke bloud. 
            
            The vertues of the firſt and of the ſecōd water are thies. If the one of thē be poured in to a woūd whyles it is new, there needeth none other remedy: But within a naturall daye and a halfe at the moſte it ſhalbe made hool, ſo be that it be no deed wounde. All ill ſoores or byles, Old, roten Cankred, Fiſtula, Lupus, Noli me tangere, and lyke to them, let them be waſht with ether of thies waters, and they ſhalbe heeled within a fewe dayes. One drop only dropped vpon a Carbuncle quenſheth  it within .iii. houres. If an eye be diſeaſed wt blerednes, or the web, or the naill or any ſwelling

carnoſity bred vpon it, drop one drop of thies waters vpon it euery third day, and within nyne daies it ſhalbe hool, except it be vtterly deſtroyed. A drop of them drunk with a litle good wyne breketh the ſtone in the reines or in the bladdar, or in the yard ſtopped and that within two houres, &amp; deliuereth from the grief. If deed fleſh be waſht away therwith, the place is ſhortly made hool. If a womā be ſick of her womb or bely, let her drink a litle of them with ſum iuice. If a man haue any  grief of a ſtroke or by chaunce, without any byll or heed, let the place be bathed and waſhed with a litle of them, and the grief ſhall go away within iii. houres. By the like helpe a ſinewe ſhrunken, waxen hard or otherwyſe ill at eaſe, is reſtored. The reſt of their vertues a learned phyſicion ſhal imagin by him ſelfe.
            The thirde and bloudy water, whiche ſurnamed holy and bleſſed, is ſo excellent in vertues, that if one vſe halfe a ſponefull of it .xv. daies, he  ſhalbe cured of the leproſy, pthiſick or conſumptiō 
               Aſtma or diſeaſe of ſhort wynde, the dropſy, palſy, Iſchia or Sciatica, the ſwounding, the fallyng ſicknes, the drop in the ioyntes called the goute, ye conſuming feuer, the ſtrangury, and many other diſeaſes, and that within two monethes. It recouereth youth vnto old men: a man that lyeth a dying, out of all hope of the phyſicions, it reſtoreth him, if one drop of it let fall into his mouthe, bee ſwalowed, ſo that it may cum to the hart. If ſo be  it a man drinke a yeare together (euery daye) the

quantitye of a wheate corne of this liquor with a ſponefull of water of borage, deſtilled like Roſewater, after the yeare is ended, he ſhall ſeeme as though he were made new, in his fleſh, blud, and hole body, both in form and ſtrength.
            An other Artificial balm, out of the ſame boke of Lullius of waters. Turpentyn a pounde and a halfe: Galbani two ounces, Aloes Cicotrinae, Maſtik, Cloues, Galangall. Cinnamon, Nutmegs, Cubebarum, of euerye one an ounce: gum of Iuy  halfe an ounce, When al is wel beaten, mixt them and deſtill them in a lembeck of glas with a ſlow fire firſt, and gather the firſt water by it ſelf ſeuerallye: then encreaſing the fyre, a water ſomwhat reddiſhe: and afterwarde encreaſynge it more, an oyle of a redde coloure, till nothinge runne anye more: chaunginge the receiuer thryſe. This oyle hathe all the vertues of true Balme: For it burneth in the water, and courdeth milcke by and by: for if one droppe of it warme be put into a pint of  Milcke, it ſhall forth with become courded. The firſte liquor is called water of Balme, the ſecond oyl of Balme: the thirde Balme Artificiall. The fyrſte is profitable againſte the runnynge of the eares, if two or three droppes mornynge and eueninge be put into them. Dropte into the eyes, it amendeth the blearedneſſe, and conſumeth the teares. It dothe meruelouſlye reſtreine ſuperfluous humors in anye parte of the bodye. It taketh away the touthache, if they be waſht therwith, and  killeth the wormes if there be anye in them.
            
               
Ther third liquor wil ſuffer no venom: is an vtter ennemy and deſtruction to ſpiders and Serpentes. Two or .iii. drops let drop into anye venemous bitinge, do make it hole ſtreight. If thou draw a circle with this liquor &amp; ſhit a venemous beaſte therein, it ſhall dye there rather then goe out of it. To he ſhort, it doth the ſame thinges all that Triacle dothe, but more effectually all thynges. Being poured or put vpon any impoſtume, within .ix. daies it healeth them, and likewiſe a  fiſtula, be it neuer ſo ill and alſo a Noli me tangere. All diſeaſes bred of fleume and colde humors, it healeth them, if a linnē cloth dipped in it be laid vppon the place where the grief is. It putteth away vtterly the Palſy, and all tremblinge of mē
               bers: it ſtrengtheneth meruelouſlye the ſinewes. It is hoter then the firſt and ſecond. If a mā put a drop of it in his hand, it perceth ſtreighte without grefe. To cōclude, it doth many other things and all diſeaſes riſen of a colde cauſe, it healeth  them, if they vſe it right.
            A water ſtrengtheuing the memorye. Floures of Rooſemarye, Borrage, Camomell, Violettes, Rooſes, of euerye one an ounce: Stichadis, Baye leaues, Samſuchi, Sage, of euery one .ii. ounces. When they are all cut ſmall, thou ſhalt ſoke them in the beſt wine, and deſtill them by a lembecke. After the liquor is deſtilled, thou ſhalt mixt with it a pounde of Turpintyne .viii. ounces of Olibanum, Maſtik, Bdelli, Anacatdorum, of enerye one  an ounce: when they are all beaten mixte them

with the other and deſtill them again. Then adde vnto them againe, Nutmegs, Mace, Galangall, Cubebarum, Cardamomi, of euerye one an ounce: Agallochi, Amber, Muſke, of euery one .ii. vnces (if the written booke be true,) when they are beaten and mixte let them ſtande .v. daies, and deſtill them the third time, encreaſing the fire til the oyl ſeace droppinge.
            Certain waters of life, to be reckened amongſt Balmes, ſhalt thou finde in Vlſtadius boke called

Beat ſuch as be to be pund and whē they are mixt with the liquors deſtil them artificially. Firſt wil a moſt ſubtil cleare water run out, which burneth meruelouſli, called the water of Balm. Then wil folow a yelow oyl, ſubtil, which they call oyl of balm, at the laſt balm artificiall, red. The firſt water which as I haue tried, helpeth cold ſtomakes meruelouſlye, &amp; conſumeth  fleum. The ſecond liquor doth excellently cure woundes, Fiſtulaes, paines of the ſinewes and ioyntes. The third is not only holſom &amp; good for the ſaide thinges, but beſides to manye other thinges which for breuities ſake I ouer pas.

make them to reſolue with oure Menſtrue (I ſuppoſe he meaneth oure Vrine) vnder dounge for the ſpace of a weke: the Menſtruum muſt be ſharp with ſome Vegetable and ſtronge quickenynge thinges whiche we ſhall declare hereafter in the Queſtionary. After the metalles ſhall be diſſolued ſet them to be deſtilled in a fire of the firſt degree, and the Menſtruum ſhall iſſue forthe, and the lime or pouder of ye metal ſhal remaine in the bottome. After this reiterat &amp; repete it again vpō the dregs  of the metall with newe Menſtruum as muche as the weight of the metall, and ſet it to putrifyinge for the ſpace of a month and a half: and after this deſtill it as thou didſt of the Vegetable or quickning things, but euery time put new Menſtruum vpon the dregs. Other diuers opinions of Philoſophers in the drawing out of the elements out of minerall thinges, we ſhall declare in the thirde boke: This ſaith he.
            I ſuppoſe it to be a commone thinge vnto all  oyles of metals to be heauier then other oyles, as Cardanus ſignifieih and an other certaine author wryteth, that the drops oyl of Vitriol or Coproos to be ponderous and weightie.

            And a little after, but ſence wee are fallen into  this communication, I think it ſhuld not be ſo vnprofitable

nor far frō the purpoſe to inquere this how oyl may be made whiche beinge annoynted vpon the Arteriis, maketh the venome to breake out by vomit or purgacion, or ſweat, or vrine, It is ſure, it muſte be of metall, which muſt be moſt ſtronge. I ſawe ſuche once and by the waighte onlye I coniectured that it was without al doute of metall, It muſte alſo bee of the nature of Venome: for by the immoderate heate, as it is ſaide, it vanquiſheth firſte the euill infection conceiued  and by naturallye attracteth vnto the vtter partes, that is hurtefull, and by the contrarietie driueth it awaye. It muſt alſo haue no ſmall ſtrengthe to diſcus &amp; expel: and again, ſōe contrarietie againſt the poyſons them ſelues, which .ii. things agree to the iuice of Laſer or Aſſa Foeetida. Therfore thoſe things that muſt driue out the poyſone, ought to be metally poyſons, but not moſt bitter: and moſt hot and diſcuſſing or expelling, alſo in a maner contrary to the poyſons. The matter therfore  of theſe thinges may conſiſt of theſe thinges, Myſi &amp; Orpment, and the iuice of Laſer or Aſſa foetida, and Gentian, and of the fat of venemous ſerpentes, and Aconitum. If ſo be it that in any land moo of theeſe (foreſaide vertues, as to diſcus, expell, and reſiſte poyſones. &amp;c. be to bee gotten, the oyle extracted by the force of fyre ſhall be beſt of all. And a little after. But oyle that onlye by anoyntinge of the Arteries dothe thruſte oute the poyſone, I woulde not call it the beſt in this ſence  that alſo beſydes it thou ſhouldeſt Miniſter in

drinke, Triacle or Milke or ſum other excellent medicin, ye alſo it ſhould be the more auaylable. That dare I be bold to ſay, that the anoynting of the arteries, and the things miniſtred outwardly, are better and of more ſtrength then thoſe things that are drunck, ſaue only for this that the poyſon remayneth yet in the ſtomack. For vnto ſuch (poyſons newly taken, that they be not yet gone out of the ſtomack) they that prouoke ſtrong vomities are mooſt excellent, as Milk, Lie, Oyll, water of  
               Nucis vomicae or ſpewing nut. Therfore in venemous bytinges, in ſtingings in oyntmentes that be venemous, in the drinking of venom whiche is now alredy perced to the midrif or nether partes of the cheſt, the helpes that be miniſtred outwardly are more auailable and of greater ſtrength. &amp;c. Thies out of Cardane haue I written the more at large, that therby alſo ye reaſon migth be the more euident of that marueilous oyl of Scorpions. &amp;c. Whiche bycauſe it is made without deſtillacion,  I will deſcribe it hereafter ſeuerally.
            Oyll of Antimonium is moſte proffitable to all ill ſoores and byles, as I my ſelf dotry with good ſucces. But the Antimonium is purged firſt, oftē

alſo make oyll of Antimonium to diuers diſeaſes within the body, whiche they extoll with maruelous and great praiſes. They make it after this ſort, as I here. Antimonii half a pounde, whyt Tartari Calcionated aſmuche: let thē be beaten and melted or diſſolued in a gouldſmithes Tigillo (crucibulo) vpon cooles: when they are melted let them be powred out into ſum earthen pot, where they ſhalbe ſturred and mixt together: and when they are becum into a hard lump, let them  be pund again, and ſtreined by a colender (that is a ſack of that form that they vſe for Hyppocras as they call it) in a moyſt place (in a hoot and moyſt place) as in a wyne celler, the colender hanging: for ſo ſhall the oyll deſtill out by litle &amp; litle which of ſum bycauſe of the bloudie colour is called Rubedo Antimanii, and lykewyſe it is made of certain Gouldſmithes for a certain painting I can not tell what. But for the remedies of mans body it ought to be prepared with Quinteſſence of wyn  or with burning water, ſo that twyſe aſmuche all moſte of it be powred to the forſaid rednes of the Antimonium: and let them be ſturde diligently in body, and mixt, and then deſtilled in aſhes thre or iiii. times, till the breth loſe al the euil ſmell.

Forthermore he douteth whether it can heele the falling ſicknes, ſeing the falling ſicknes doth the more appeer with ye foule ſtinking, ſmell of the Bitumen. But me thinkes it  ſemeth probable that that ſicknes ſhuld be helped

with it by attenuating, digeſting, drying, whiche vertues boothe it hathe theim befoore, and that not feablelye: and alſo muche moore the liquor deſtilled thereof perfourmeth theeſe thinges.
            Nether doth it not help this dieſe therfor, becauſe it is likely that the ſame ſhould be vttred and appere with the perfume of that bituminous ſmell, as with the perfume of Myrrh, Galbanum, and horns, houfs, and the ſkins of a ſhe or he gote. For Phiſicions vſe the hornes &amp; houfes of diuers beſtes  againſt this ſiknes, miniſtring the ſhauings of them within the body: nether is it a like reaſō in the perfuminge of a thinge and receiuinge of it ſimplely. But of theſe maiters, Phiſicions ſhuld teach not ſo much by reaſons &amp; coniectures, as by experiment &amp; trial.

            Oyl of philoſophers (which ſome haue named oyl of wiſdom, and of perfect maſterſhip, &amp; diuine and holy) by al the old writers conſent, is moſt effectuous to ſecreat diſeaſes, and tha

                not to a few  of them, for it heateth, drieth, perceth depe by the

meanes of the ſubtelnes of the ſubſtance, it digeſteth and conſumeth al excremental and ſuperfluous expelled matter. Therfore it is very holſome for the falling ſicknes, palſy, turning ſicknes, for getfulnes, and for the cold diſeaſes of the ſplene, rains, bladder, womb, ſinewes, al ioynts, &amp; other ſinewy parts. But one ſort is natural or mineral and an other of the ſea, that runneth out of Iles &amp; rocks (called Naphtha) of the which kinde, that which is ſomewhat white is counted the beſt: the  rediſh of a mean goodnes: but that which is ſomwhat black &amp; thick, is the worſt. Notwithſtāding it is made by arte in this wiſe. Tiles made of red earth very old, muſt be beaten into pieces, &amp; ſet on fire with vnſmoking coles, til they be red hot, thē ſlek thē in a bole ful of oyl of Rofmary (alchichil) or old claret, &amp; as much as is poſſible let them ſok in the oyl. Dry them by thē ſelues in caſes (caczobis. The Munks vpon Meſuen: wher alſo is red ſhortly after, Caczola for a Cucurbita or body of a  ſtil.) Afterward beat them moſt ſmal, and put thē in a veſſel that be deſtilled by ſublimacion, ioyn ye veſſel to the hed with claye that chymiſts do vſe, ſethe them with coles ſet a fire in a fornace, til an oyl deſtil into a phial of glas glued to ye lower end of the noſe of the head (with clay, Bulcaſis) which ſtopt veri exactly, ſet it vp &amp; kepe it: for the elder it is the ſtronger: Meſue as Syluius trāſlateth him, whoſe words alſo I haue writen here out of his annotaciōs. Oyl (ſaith he) of tiles is ſo ſubtil, that  in a moment it ſpredeth moſt brode: if it be poured into a mans hād it perceth it forth wt. It is much

more ſubtil, more hot and more effectuous in cold diſeaſes, thē is oyl of balm. It prouoketh vrin, it breaketh the ſtone, killeth worms: it is holſom for the ſinging of the eares comming of a gros wind for the palſi, the crāp (ſpaſmo cynico) the ſciatica or ach in the hukle bones, the gout in the knees, fete &amp; the greues of the other ioynts, being drunk or anoynted vpon ye place: but let it be drunke mixte wt a litle porcion of ſome water conuenient for the diſeaſe. The making of this oyl is deſcribed alſo  by Raſis in his Antidotari or preſeruatiue and by Bulcaſis in his boke intitled Seruitor: wheras Bulcaſis preferreth new tiles, yt neuer yet toucht water, becauſe they drink in ye oyl better: &amp; he bids deuide thē into pieces of an inche bignes, &amp; putreth thē ſo in a veſſel of glas, or glaſed, wel claied yt the third part therof remain empty.

Take &amp; breke into litle peces red tiles very olde or new, but yt neuer touched water, &amp; thei being made red hot quēch them in oyl of oliues, or els, y• is better, in oyl of baies, by &amp; by make thē red hot again, &amp;  ſlek thē as befor vntil they wax blacke. Then put theſe peces into a lembeck with ye oyl alſo wherin

theiwer quēſhed, if ani of it be left, if not, put new vnto it to the meaſur of a fingar. Afterward put to it Caſtorei, and Spicknard, or in the ſteed of it rew, of ether of them one part: Coſti two partes. When thies are punned, mixt them with the tyles in a Cucurbita or bely, whiche thou ſhalt digge in hors dong about. rx. daies. At lengthe thou ſhalt deſtill it, encreaſing the fyer by litle and litle. The firſt liquor is good, the ſecond better, but the third of a red colour is beſt. This oyll is good againſt  all could diſeaſes as Balm, but this is more ſubtil then Balm and more proffitable in could diſeaſes, for it perceth through the hand quickly and ſpredeth abrode a great way. It cureth the ſtoone of the bladder and the could diſeaſes of the ſame. It prouoketh vrine. It helpeth the could diſeaſes of the eares, and killeth the wormes of the ſame. It is moſte proffitable for them that be ſick of the palſy, and of the Cynical Cramp, being anoynted therupon or drunkē, alſo the Sciatica, &amp; the griefs  of the ioyntes and back. A plaſter made with this oyll and ſalt Ammoniack, diſſolueth in ſhort ſpace the impoſtumes and hardneſſes of the ſplien. It is of force againſt the falling ſicknes and the obſtruction or ſtopping of the noſe, being put into ye nooſthrilles. It heateth the brain, confirmeth the memory, aſſwageth touth ache. Being put into ye womb, it prouoketh the flowers. It bringeth out the chyld newly conceiued ether dead or alyue. It openeth the mouth of the vaines, &amp; diſſolueth the  bloud that is lopperd or curded. It purgeth the

lunges from gros humors. A fewe drops of it drunken with ſyrop of Rooſes, helpeth them that drawe their breeth peinfully. It conſumeth marueylouſly the water deſcending down to the eyes, that is to ſaye the diſeaſe called Suffuſion. If fiſhers anoynt their nettes therwith, they ſhall entyſe innumerable fiſhes. Iron moyſtened therin and put to the fyer ſhall burne ſtreigth way. It killeth wornes wherſoeuer they be. Being made hoot in an egge ſhell or other veſſell, may be dropt  holſumly into the place where the grief is, vntyll the grief aſſwage. It reſiſteth could poyſons, as the ſting of a Scorpion, and alſo black Popy, and Henbane, if a mā haue reciued thē by his mouth. It puteth away the ſtoone of the bladder, being mixt with the barck of Percily, and Fenell, (the barkes of the routes being ſodde in water, and a litle quantitie of this decoction receiued with a drop or .ii. in drinke) but all thies thinges for the moſte part doth Raſis in Antidotary attribute and  aſſcribe to the ſimple oyl Benet, that is, that which is deſtilled of only tyles &amp; oyl. That is coūted the beſt (ſaith Raſis) that is very red, of a ſtrong ſmel, and of a ſubtill ſubſtaunce.
            Oyl of leed: Loke befor, wheras we haue reher ſed Vlſtadius wordes of Quineſſence.
            
            Amber by an artificiall meanes of ſiething is turned into an oyl of his oun colour. Ge. Agricola In died it is poſſible to make oyl of Amber, after the ſame maner as of Iet, wherof we haue writen  befor. For they ſeme, not to be of much vnlyke nature.

The Germains call them by a cōmun name Agſtein, geuing only the difference of black vnto Iet. Cardan ſuppoſeth that Camphora alſo is of ye ſame kynd, only bycauſe yt this, that the perfume of Amber receiued in a moyſt cloth, giueth afterward the ſmell of Camphora in it: which notwithſtanding did not appeare ſo to me as I did proue it for a triall.
            Brimſton anoynted &amp; drūck taketh away ſcabbednes, leproſy and the frenche pockes. But with  a more vehement force, the oyl therof, which how it ſhould be made, we haue declared in our bokes of the frenche diſeaſes. Card. But his bookes of ye frenche diſeaſe, I ſuppoſe ar not yet cum forth in print. Salt cōteineth an oyll in it if it be mixt wt the lyme or clay called Bitumen. Wherupō 
               Arrianus declareth, emongſt the Ichthiophagi, the men that liue only by fyſhe, in his hiſtory of Ind, howe they make an oyll of ſalt. That may be an argument alſo that the Oliue tries delyte in the Sea  bankes for a ſalt groūd is alſo not a litle fat. But as I ſaid, al thinges do ſo contein oyl, that it may be drawen out by ye force of fier, but it can not contein much, except it haue Bitumē
                mixt wt it. Car.
            
            For the making of oyl of Brimſton, a mā muſt choſe out yt which is pure &amp; neuer touched the fier, chiefly aliue &amp; of an aſhy colour.) This oyl is made many wayes at Rome, by ſublymaciō &amp; deſcē
               cion. &amp;c. It is good for many thinges, &amp; chiefly for fiſtulas, &amp; for ye healing of ye wheeles of ye moutes  y• mē cal gangrenes (I ſuppoſe it to be yt which we call in Engliſhe cankers) in the curing wherof it

excelleth moſte of all. For take and wet the end of a fether or other lyke thing, as ſome yong and tender ſpring of a trie or herbe, and touche the wheeles once or twyſe only therwith, and by and by thei ſhalbe killed &amp; healed. The Munkes vpō 
               Meſue.
            
            Take a veſſell of glas (as Maithaeolus Senen. writeth in his boke of the Frenche euil) not much vnlyke to a litle bell, daubed with potters claye, hang it the ſpace of a cubit from the grounde, by a wyer of bras or iron, vnder ye which thou ſhalt ſet  a baſen of glas of a great cōpas, with a pot turnde vpſyde downe. Moreouer the bottom of the pot ſhall hold vp an iron plate of .iiii. fingars broode, made red hoat, wherupon the Brimſtone may be brent. Whyles this is brēt, newe ſhalbe added vpō it. Therupon it ſhal cum to pas that by the ſmoke aſcending, the hanging veſſell in ſhort ſpace ſhall deſtill drop down in to the baſen that ſtandes vnder, an oyll, whiche gathered diligently thou ſhalt ſerue in a phyall of glas. 
            
            Brimſtone that neuer came ny the fyer, or moſt yelowe, whyles it is brent, giueth a thick ſmoke to be receiued in a bell of glas or of ſtoone. Wherein thorowe the gros vapour an oyll gathered together deſtilleth into a large plain veſſell, in ye mids wherof the brimſtone builded vpon a litle veſſell is brent. Other beating the brimſtone conſume the fyry ſubſtaūce of if, with Aqua vitae ſet on fyer, and after deuil that whiche remaineth, lyke vnto oyll of Philoſophers. Other ſieth yelowe Brimſtone  Turpintyn, of ether an vnce, oyl of Roſes a

pound, with a ſlow fire, with .ii. vnces of odoriferous wine, til the wine be conſumed, (as it is red in Luminari maiore.) Syluius.
            
            Put one part of quick brimſton into .ii. parts partes of oyl of Lynſied, beat them well and diligently together, and let them ſtand in hors dong ii. dais in a veſſel wel ſhut, &amp; it ſhalbe clere &amp; fair.
            But all theſe oyls ſeme to be prepared only for this purpoſe that they may be miniſtred without the body: I here ſay that there be certaine practicioners  now a daies, which geue men to drink to ther body, a certain oyl of brimſtō, chiefli againſt falling ſikneſſes, &amp; perauenture that kind whoſe firy ſubſtance, as Syluius maketh menciō, is firſt conſumed by Aqua vitae ſet on fire, then deſtild by ſublimacion, it may be more ſafly miniſtred with in the body then the other.
            Oyl of Vitriol or copros is deſired of chymiſts and likewiſe of phiſitions, and as a moſte ſecrete matter is hid. I will put here ſome deſcriptions  therof, whiche I receiued of my frendes, or found in writē bokes, and after other I wil declare one way of this oyl moſt effectuall &amp; approued, which I know my ſelfe, whiche a certaine practicioner with vs vſed to the curing almoſte of all kinde of diſeaſes, and in many luckely. &amp;c.
            Make the Vitriol in to lime, as thou knoweſt, then pour burning water vnto it, ſo that it excede the Vitriol a little: then ſeperate the burning water by deſtillacion in a phiall or in a croked ſtil, or  a bely (laid on the one ſide). When that is drawne

out, vrge the ſpirits of the Vitriol by litle and little, encreaſing the fire more and more, til al ye ſpirits be ouer paſſed. This liquor deſtilled put it again into ſom one of the .iii. maner of veſſels aforſaid, &amp; deſtil it in a kettle ful of water, vntil whatſo euer watry thing is in it, be ſeparated, whiche thou ſhalt endeuor to bring to pas by al the witte thou haſt, that the watrines be clean gotten out, ether by a lēbek, (with a noſe) or a blind lembek, whoſe nether ſkirt haue a hollow gutter or circle  like vnto a lēbek) that is to ſay with a noſe). Endeuor that the water in the kettle ſethe lightlye (if ſo be it ought to ſieth at all: the dutch word (ſiedē) ſemeth to be equi
                  •
               ocal, and may ſignify as wel ſe thing as boyling) to thintent that the waterines alone may aſcend, and the oyl alwaies remain in the botom of the bely: the which thing to bringe to pas, you ſhall haue nied of two daies at the leaſt. Then afterward that oyl that is left in the belly, put it into a bely or other of the forſaid veſſels defenſed  with clay and deſtil it: &amp; marke whether any water pas before the ſpirits. For if there be any watrines yet mixt with it, it ſhalbe nedeful to ſet it afterward in y• ſun or hot place in a blind lē
               bek, y• the watrines being eleuated and caried vp may remain in the hem &amp; ſkirt of the lēbek. This if yu repeete ofter then once, this inſolaciō I mene the oyl ſhall becom euer the ſwieter and better. Ye alſo a man may repete the deſtillacion the ſecond or third time: for by that meanes the oyl is rectified  more and more. Thou maiſt miniſter .ii. or .iii. drops of this oyl againſt all manner of diſeaſes,

ether by it ſelf, or with waters conuenient for euerye diſeaſe. This oyl I haue taſted my ſelfe, it is ſwiet, pleaſant, and ſtrong, in colour (if I remember wel) ſomwhat white.
            An other way. Take .iiii. poundes of Vitriol of Rome, dry it in an earthen veſſel till it wax red, after when it is beaten put it into a bely of glaſſe diligently defenced with clay (as the maner is for Aqua fortis) and firſt deſtilit with a ſoft fire, encreſing the degre of the fire by litle and little, vntyll  white fumes begin to iſſue out at the noſe of ye bely: then ſet a great receiuing veſſel fenſed wt clay and make a fire with wod continuing for ye ſpace of .xii. hours, and at lēght ſhal iſſue out red drops and heauye. When the receiuer beginneth to bee clear, the matter is finiſhed, wherfore then ceaſe that the veſſels may be couled. Afterward y• ſhalt put it in a litle lembek to ſeparate and auoide the fleum, and reſerue the reaſt, ſetting it in the ſun a ix. daies. When thou wilt vſe it, miniſter it wyth  white wine, or Malmſy .vi. or .vii. drops, ſo that nothinge after be eaten by the ſpace of .iii. or .iiii. hours, it mai be receiued alſo before ſlepe, if a mā drink not vpon it. This liquor is profitable for a ſick ſtomack, for lepers, for them that be ſicke of ye ſtone, for the retention and keping of vrin, for thē that be ſicke of the Ague, and in time of the peſtilence with water of Acetoſae, ſomwhat warm, putting vnto it half a dram of ſpices Diamargariton, which is cold if it may be gotten. 
            
            An other way to make oyl of Vitriol againſt in

rable diſeaſes. Put as much Vitriol of Rome as ye wil in a bely to wax red, wt ſuch a fire as is vſed to Aqua fortis, for ye ſpace of .xxiiii. hours, as lōge as the water commeth forth without ſpirits, and more if it be not made red, euer kepinge the ſame fire. Whē as it is now becomed red, take away ye hed (lembek) and the receiuer, and kepe the water for ſecret vſes to be ſpoken of. After beat ye 
               Vitriol and put it in a bely with .v. partes of quinteſſēce of wine, that the Vitriol may be ſoked: The belly  ought to be laide ouerthwarte in a fornace, to the which thou ſhalt ſet an other contrary without, ye bottom wherof let it be put in a veſſel of cold water. Then make a fire in the furnace, no les vehement thē ſuch as for Aqua fortis is made. So ſhal run out firſt the Aqua vitae, and at length the fyre encreaſed, oyl of Vitriol ſhall follow. Then thou ſhalt ſeparate the Aqua vitae from the oyl, putting a hed to the bely wherin both are conteined, &amp; ſetting a receiuer without, with a fire of Aqua fortis. 
                But that the matter may be the more euident, we haue drawn a figure ſuch as it is, of the fornace, wherin the oyl ought to be deſtilled, with a ſituacion ouerthwart to the bely, and a fire made roūd about, that the oyl iſſuing forth may find no colenes ſaue only in the receiuer. ¶ The vertues of this oil ar innumerable, wherof ſōe we wil recite here, yt a learned phiſiciō may coniecture ye reſt by him ſelf. To ſuch as haue any hot or cold diſeaſe, but more cold, he ſhall geue .iiii. drops with good  wine, or burninge water, faſtinge earlye in the

morning, and forbid  them to receiue anye meet befor .iiii. houres be paſt. Againſt a cō
               tinual ague giue .viii. drops, with halfe an vnce of Roſe water, in the morning as is ſaid and lykewyſe alſo againſt other diſeaſes,  with deſtilled liquors or decoctions miet for the purpoſe. As cōcerning the Doſin, that is the quantitie of the receite, vnto ſtrōg men thou maiſt giue .viii. drops, to men of meen ſtrength fiue, to ſuch as be weake iiii. &amp;c. In this oyll if thou diſſolue Marchaſit, it ſhall chaung ſiluer, and tinge it in all degries.
            An other way for the ſame, that it may be the  better made and purer. Put in an earthen pot of earth of Crucibulorum glaſed within as muche Vitrioll of Rome as thou wilt: and deſtill it in a fornace, as is befor ſaid, with a fyer of Aqua fortis and there ſhall run out a whyte water of Vitriol: After when it ceaſeth, thou ſhalt encreas the fyer, and a grien water ſhall folow, which whē it hath left thou ſhalt make a moſte ſtrong and vehemēt fyer, both aboue and beneth, and a red oyl ſhall iſſue out. Chaunge euer the receiuer according to  the chaūging of the liquors: Or els take thoſe .iii.

liquors in one veſſel, &amp; ſeperate the waters afterward from the oyl by deſtilling them, and the oyll ſhall remain in the bely. This ſeparatiō is made ye bely ſtāding vpright (with a head and a receiuer) the firſt deſtillacion of ye oyl, the bely lying ouerth warth, as it is ſaid. If thou dip a litle drie woul or bombaſe in water of Vitriol of Rome, and ther wt thouch any kind of diſeaſes of ye mouth, thou ſhalt eaſely heale them: Out of a writen booke of a certain friend: he ſemeth here to meane that water yt 
                rūneth out firſt: which is to be vſed only without the body, not the very oyl of Vitriol, which is more precious and pure, and is kept to be miniſtred &amp; giuen to drinke againſt inward diſeaſes.
            Of the vertues of oyl of Vitriol, out of ye ſame writen boke. Drinck Malmſy with a litle oyll of Vitriol, cōtinually for the ſpace of .v. or .viii. dais, it riddeth a man from all obſtructions, it purgeth the bloud, and driueth away the ſtone. It healeth the il ſcab, if it be drunck with water of fumitory,  and Myrobalana condite. It reneweth a mā with water of endiue. It healeth all maner of griefes of the head, with water of Maioram, or Buglos, or Meliſſa: alſo the turnſicknes, if it be conteined any ſpace. With water of Agreſta it healeth al maner of diſeaſes, the body being firſt purged. It reſtoreth the memory with the water of Acorus or Fenell. It mouith a man to ſlepe, with the ſied of Letis or Popy. It is good for melancolyck perſons with water of Bublos or Borage. It cureth  mad men with water of the water lily, cōtinuing ye vſe of it: alſo hoat impoſtums &amp; the ſleping euil

with water of wyld rewe. It purgeth the body wt 
               Aqua vitae. It healeth ye palſy with water of wyld mint, or ſage, &amp; Hyſſop, the cramp with water of Sage: the ſicknes of quaking with water of Baſilicus, &amp; diuers inward diſeaſes with water of Trifolium, all feblenes of the eyes with water of Fenell: the reum from the head with water of Lily, ye catar wt water of Adiantū
                &amp; Hyſſop, &amp; the cough, alſo the diſeaſe of the ſyde with water of Plātain the Pleureſis wt water of maiden hear, the feblenes  &amp; wekenes of the ſtomack, wt water of mint. With water of Quinces, it ſtaunceth vomitting: if the ſick be of a moyſt temperature or cōplexion, let it be giuen him with water of plantain or ſhep pardes purs with a litle Diarhodon. It ſtinteth ye flux of the bely with the water of Plantain: the co lyck with water of Rewe. With water of wormwod it reſiſtith venemous bytings. It healeth al maner of impoſtumes and dropſy, continuing it. It is good for the limes that be reſolued, if it bee  chawfed vpon with an Ox gaull. It helpeth the ſplen with Tamarindis: with water of Radiſh and and ſea bremble, it expelleth the ſtoone, &amp; openeth the ſtoppinges of theines. It healeth all agues wt water of Agreſta, &amp; certain kyndes of leproſy, cōtinuing the vſe of it. This is the trew potable gold, and the trew Selādyn or Chelidonia, &amp; more alſo in weigth it giueth not place to gold, &amp; it hath the ſame &amp; as many vertues as potable gould. A litle of it with a litle water of Roſes drunk, reſtoreth ye 
                ſpeche that is loſt: it ſtinteth the bleding at ye noſe with Roſes.
            
               
An other maner of oyll of Vitriol, whiche a certain old man a practicioner in Heluetia vſed, mixting .ii. or .iii. drops with Triacle, and bidding thē to ſweet after they had drunck it, in a bed .iiii. or. v houres, ſo that they put not out ſo muche as a fingar, by the whiche medicine I knowe manye too be cured of him from diſeaſes hard to be cured. &amp;c. When he died I ſawe the oyll whiche me thougth was of ſumwhat a whyte colour or duſkiſh, perauenture bycauſe of the litle pieces of ſiluer that  were put into it. The taſte of it was moſte ſharpe paſſing all vinegar be it neuer ſo ſtrōg, in ſo much that one drop perced the tong lyke any hoot markyng iron ſodenly, yet hurt it not: ye it nether hurt the throot when it was ſwalowed: otherwyſe of no vnpleſant taſte, almoſte of no ſmel, or els ſumwhat ſenting of aduſtion or brentnes. But it is made in this wyſe. Putte .iii. or .iiii. pound of Vitriol, or as muche as ye liſt in a large earthen veſſell glaſed, and fenced without euery where roūd  about with clay diligently and dryed againe, and ſetting the veſſell in a chimney vpon quick coles, procure diligently all the ſmooke of it (from the which as from the poyſon thou ſhalt beware thou kepe thy ſelfe) the vapuor and beeth out, ſtirring it with a ſtaf, and mouing euery fout that whiche is beneth vpward, ſeing lykewyſe that in boyling it run not ouer, and continue ſo doing till it ceas boylyng, and that all the vapor and ſmooke ſeme to be cleen conſumed. Then ſhalt thou put in burning  cooles of Vitriol many inough from aboue

in the very veſſel, and leaue it ſo til the Vitriol be clean brought to lime, that no moiſture or vapor at all remain in it, and that now it haue gotten a rediſh or yelowiſh colour, nor any vapour or ſpirits ſeme to aſcend from it any more. For except ye 
               Vitriol be very dry, oyl effectual &amp; ſtrong inough ſhould not be drawn out of it, but mixt with a certain white fleum. When as therefore it is ſufficiently broughte into lime, put awaye the fire, and when the veſſell is couled by little and little, take  it out ſoftly leaſt peraueuture it breake. Thē get out the Vitriol as wel as ye cā with a knife or otherwiſe: although it is no harde matter to get it out of a glaſed veſſel. The Vitriol takē out, breke it ſmal, &amp; put the peces into an erthen bely, which the potter, as be ſpoken, hath made of ye beſt erth, and wonderfully wel  baked, ſo ſtronge that it mai be able to abide a vehemente fire in a  fornace .iii. daies, and iii nights, continually: for if it ſhuld breke thou ſhouldeſt looſe both oyl and labor, be it neuer ſo litle a crak or chinck that ſhoulde happen vnto it. Therfore yt it may the eaſier withſtande &amp; abide  the fire, it muſt be fē
               ced

with clay, and yt, ii. or .iii. fold, yt is, firſt dried &amp; parieted again, &amp; again. The form of the fornace ſhalbe in this ſort. This fornace ſhalbe butlded. 4 ſquare, &amp; in the top a litle imboſed &amp; vaulted roūd in the midſt of ye top of ye arch ſhalbe made a hole or ſmoking vent, ſo larg, y• eueri hour or as oft as nead ſhal require, coles may be put conueniently into ye fornace by it, wt a lōg iron fire ſhouel, to put in the coles gētlely &amp; charily wtall yt they may ſlide down about the bely in ſuch wiſe yt it be not hurt. In the. 4. corners alſo aboue muſt be left holes or  vēts, in euery coruer one, &amp; ſo mani ſtoples of clai muſt be made mete for thē. Whē the coles are now put in &amp; the fyre burneth, the hole of the valt muſt be ſhut wt a lid of iron or wt the fire ſhouel, and the holes of the▪ corners muſt be left open, yt thair mai haue entraunce. The bely ought to be placed in ye midle of the fornace vpon ſuch an yron which ſhal reſt at both ends in ye wals on both ſides of ye fornace: in ye midle bought of this irō ſhal the bely be  laid. The mouth of the bely ought to loke out wt
               out ye fornace a litle by a hole which muſt ſtreight way be ſhut &amp; ſtopt wt clay, yt the air may haue no entrāce ther about. Thē muſt ye mouth of ye belibe ioyned wt the mouth of ye receiue, ſo yt thone be put into thother. It is requiſit that the receiuer be of glas &amp; good &amp; great, perauēture leſt whē it is ſtuffed wt the ſpirits it ſhuld chāce to breke, or els to ye intēt it may be the further from the fornace. And wher thei ar ioyned together, yu ſhalt cōpas ye ioyntes  roūd about diligētly wt very good clay tēpred wt the whites of egs &amp; linnē clouts about it, leſt 
                  〈◊〉
               
               
ſpirits ſhuld brethe out. This clai muſt be ſuffred to be dried, before ye begin the buſines. Moreouer ther muſt yet .ii. holes be made in the ii. contrary ſides of the fornace (not in yt ſide yt the bely loketh out at, nether in the cōtrary, but in the other two. Theſe alſo muſt haue their ſtopples to ſhut thē wt al, yt the heat may be kept in. The vſe of theſe holes, yt the coles which ar put in at the top of ye valt may be hadſōly diſpoſed wt ſome iron prōg for the purpoſe put in at ye holes, &amp; ordred in ſuche wiſe yt 
                they be beneth, aboue &amp; on euery ſide of the bely, &amp; it in the very mids of the fire: by ye ſame holes, ſhal it be taken hede, yt the flore of the grate be not ſtopt wt coles or aſhes to much, &amp; that thentrāce of thair be not ſhut out, by mouing them wt the iron prong: yt being don, by &amp; by the holes muſt be ſhut again wt their ſtopples. In the nether part alſo of ye fornace muſt be left a dore indifferēt larg, yt the air may haue entrāce beneth, leſt the fire be 
                  •
               motherd. A litle aboue this dore ſhalbe laid on cros  ouerthwart an other in order vpō which muſt be a flore &amp; pauemēt made, an inch thik, ful of holes as big as a mā may put in his thōb at thē, to thintēt ye air mai haue acces: it muſt be ſene vnto moſt diligētly yt the fire may be cōtinued great inough, for y• ſpace of. 3, dais &amp; nights, as it is ſaid, &amp; neuer left or let ſlake: for ſo alſo the oyl &amp; the labor ſhuld he loſt. Thus whē eueri thing is apoynted, &amp; the fornace &amp; the bely dried, yu ſhalt begin y• deſtillatiō cōtinuing a ſtrong fire with coles as it is ſaid. At  lēgth whē. 3. dais are ended y• receiuer beginneth to becom clere and white, the fire burning yet in

Therfore thou ſhalt let the fire to go oute and the fornace once couled, take awaye the receiuer, and turning it in thy handes, and inclining it now to one ſide, now to an other, gather all the drops together that cleue vnto the ſides, and the oyl or lyquor ſo gathered, pour it into a veſſell of the beſt Venice glas: for it is daunger leaſte the commun glas ſhuld be eaten through of it, for it conſumeth and eteth like Aqua fortis, This liquor that practicioner  to cloke the thing, called it oyl of philoſophers, the philoſophers ſtone, and ye leper: he ſaid ſiluer wolde be diſſolued in it, if it were put into it pure and thin made in a plate, &amp; likewiſe coyns of ſiluer: notwithſtanding I found after his deathe hole peces of ſiluer.

prepare after the ſame maner. But emongſt diuers wayes of this oyl of Vitriol, I lyke that beſt which I deſcribed laſt. For the liquor that is deſtilled that way is the ſharpeſt of all, and alſo the tarteſt, in ſo muche that it may be called vinegar of metal, as me thinketh: Wherfore of certain it is highly commended for the quenſhing of thirſt in ſomer tyme, one drop of it put into a draught of wyne, lyke as I found in a certain doutch writtē booke, where as this alſo is added: Vitriolum is  deſtilled in a bely laid ouerthwart, fenſed wt clay, in the flames of the fyer, it runneth out ſkant the third day, and firſt water.
            An other way out of the ſame booke. Stiep Vitriol in Aqua fortis, whiche may drawe out all the fatnes therof, from the which if thou ſeparate the Aqua fortis by deſtillacion, an oyll ſhall remaine. But perauentur this way is to daungerous that a liquor ſo deſtilled ſhould be receiued within the body. But without the body and to the wheeles or  cankar of the mouth it may well be miniſtred.

But in what ſort it ſhould be made, I could neuer yet fynde in any booke that went abrode: ſo greatly haue they all kept ſecret this thing as a marueylous myſtery.

But the commun Aqua fortis alſo, and the ſimple oyl of Vitriol, if a man put a drop of them in to a wen or warte firſt cut, they take it away: of the whiche thing I made a tryall in my ſelf vpon a ſied wart on my fyngars ende, wherinto when I had firſt cut it with a razer, I  put a drop of Aqua fortis, and although it wēt not away by &amp; by, yet within a few wekes is was gon Aqua fortis or to ſeparate metalles is thus made. One part of Sal nitrum, liquid or molten Alum (that they call roche .iii. partes: ſand half a parte, when they are dryed diligently and purged with the fyer, let them be deſtilled in a veſſell of glas. It is gathered by it ſelfe, that whiche iſſueth out firſt, at length when the glas looketh lyke a ſafrō colour, encreaſe the fyre and an other foloweth:  whiche is receiued in the firſt for the moſte parte:

and yet if thou take it in water of the fountain or well, it is yet ſo ſharpe that neuer the les it diſſolueth ſiluer, and ſeparateth it from Goulde. It is ſeparated in this wiſe. Take a litle quantity of ye water drawn out, and put into it the weight of. xii grains of very pure ſiluer▪ and ſet it vpō aſhes til the ſiluer be diſſolued. This ſhall ſend down into the bottom of the veſſell, groundes like vnto fine lime, which taken awaye the pure water that remaineth, put it to the hole water from the which  thou drueſt it, which in like maner ſhal it ſelf alſo let down into the bottom groundes like the other, which taken away, thou ſhalt haue the hole water moſt pure and moſt ſtrong to diſſolue ſyluer and other metals except gould (gould alſo I ſuppoſe is diſſolued of Chymiſts with Aqua fortis but of another maner of making.) But ſeing it vaniſheth away eaſili and conſumeth, it ſhalbe kept in a glas diligentlye ſhut. To a man that imagineth how great ſtrengthes it hath, which takinge  water (as I ſaid) of the wel, yea withoute fyre in xxiiii. hours doth bring ſiluer vnto water, but wt a little heate of aſhes, in .ii. or .iii. houres, there is no man but he wil graunt thoſe laſt vapors, and water wherunto they be tourned to haue maruelous ſtrength, or rather increadible. Of the ſame kind is water that is made of the ſalts Ammoniak and Nitrum, with Chalcanthum (yt is coproos) and Alum molten in equal porcions, putting vnto them at laſt one fourth part of rouſt: this made  after the ſame maner, ſpareth not very ſtones.

It yet a man ad and put to a litle of the obſtracite ſtone, called Smiris wherwith they poliſhe precious ſtones, thou ſhalt haue more plenty of water and better, becauſe it wil not bee burned. Theeſe things therfor receiued and found true by trials, let vs ſee what ſhoulde be cauſe that this water becommeth ſo ſtrong: for manifeſt experience techeth, that the drier part attenuated and fined by the force of the fire, receiueth a firye and a fretting or gnawing ſtrength. But why burneth not  the water of ſeparatinge, as burnyng water dothe? Becauſe that the burninge water is hotter and thinner, and les drye, therefore it maye bren, and excellentlye heaten, but not freate. But the other can freat, not burne, and alſo heaten a little. By like reaſon therfore the oyl that is takē out of Chalcanthum by the force of the fire, for as muche as it turneth the drieſt part into humor, it is moſt ſharpe, and ſtriketh the tounge like fire. Cardan. Let no manne thinke that this liquor perteineth  only to Chymiſts and goldſmithes. For it is profitable alſo for medicines vnto mans body. It is dropped into warts that be cut and ſlit, as I ſaid afore.

I haue hard the ſuffuſion or web of the eie to be cured in certain with the vertue of this liquor, by the ſame quick ſiluer is precipitated, as we ſhall now declare: and the oyle of Chalcanthum or Coproos  is drawn out by it, as we ſaid.

This medicin (ſaith he) dryeth, with a certain gentle eating of the ſoft and ſuperfluous fleſhe, and that withoute grief, remouing alſo the euill ſecret qualitie of the ſoores, and chiefly of the diſeaſe of Naples. It digeſteth any matter, and purgeth it, &amp; letteth the  diſeaſe called Corroſio of gnawyng &amp; the canker: it diſſolueth groos matter, hard and rawe, after ye opening of gummes. And no medicine is to be cō
               pared with this in this diſeaſe. For if thou continew in the vſe of it, it leadeth vnto the perfect breding of the ſkin, as I haue oftentimes tryed: and it is excellent in the euill ſores of the yard. It is made in this wyſe. But a pound of quick ſiluer in a litle bely of glas, and power as muche Aqua fortis vnto it. Then put the bely in a pot and aſhes in  ſpace betwene the bely and the pot ſydes, that the pot breake not aſſone as it toucheth the fyer. Thē put vnder fyer, ſlow at the firſt, and let it be encreſed by lytle and litle, yet after a certain mean: and ſo with a ſtrong fyer let it be left, till all the water be conſumed, whiche is perceiued when no more vapours aſcend out of ye bely. So ſhalt thou haue Mercurium calcionated red. Grynde this, &amp; if any parte of the quick ſiluer remaine with it, put the ſaid pouder in a cleen veſſell of bras at the fyer, &amp;  ſo mixt it, let it ſtande till all the part of quick ſiluer

be conſumed. This pouder maiſt thou vſe to all the forſaid diſeaſes and ſpecially to the ſores of the yard, &amp; of other places, wher rottennes and much il matter letteth the knitting or heling vp: and in fiſtulaes diſſolue it with wine, and caſt it in by a braſen pipe, for it worketh meruelouſly.
            Moreouer water to ſeparate gold from ſiluer is thus made. Two poundes of Vitriol of Rome Roche Alum .xvi. ounces: Sal Nitrum a pounde: let them be put in a croked bely (writhē bakward)  claied, or in a ſtreght with his head and receiuer. Deſtyll them as Alchymiſts do. This water is meruelous to put away wartes, in what parte of the body ſo euer they be, and ſpecially in the foū
               dament and wombe: it brenneth and ſearreth alſo euil ſores eating them out euery where, yea euen in the throte, and letteth the ſores from crieping and ſpreading, namelye of the yarde and the wombe. If it be to vehement, mixte it with Rooſe water. And I my ſelfe haue healed ill ſores and  biles of the throte, touching them twiſe a dai with the ſaide water, mixtinge with it half ſo muche of Roſewater: and it is one of our ſecreates (ſe more in the ſame, the .vi. boke and .ii. chapter.)

Yea alſo it is holſō to be miniſtred amongſt the griefes of the yard &amp; great guts: for we haue cured ſome that auoyded their dung by their mouth: leaninge to the moniments and ſayings of Paulus Aegineta, that ſaith, how certain phiſitiōs haue miniſtred in that diſeaſe  of the great guttes, quicke ſiluer killed. The ſame reſiſteth the taking, as they cal it, or inchātment: It hath beſides this many notable vertues which when I haue more leiſure, I wil rehearſe vnto thee (he ſpeketh to him yt talketh with him) one by one: perauenture then it ſhall delite me to expres, in what ſorte thou maiſt make pouder wt gould and quicke ſiluer, or els the water declared before. Theſe he. I hare of late that a certain phiſicion or chymiſt at Atheſin, did prepare Mercurium

            How Praecipitatum is made, which is a remedy againſt all diſeaſes growing of the rottennes of humors, out of a certain writē boke. Make a water of equal porcions of Vitriol of Rome and Sal Nitrum, with a heade and receiuer, in the whiche thou ſhalt put the ſixt-part of the weighte of rawe  
               Mercury, yt is to ſay, if ther be. 3. poūds of Vitriol
               
and Sal nitrum, put .vi. vnces of Mercury. Afterward ſuffer the water with his ſpirites to deſcend in to the receiuer. Then auoyde all that is in the receiuer into a clean bely and that is claied: vnder the whiche put a head with a receiuer, and deſtill it again: and whē the water is in the receiuer, put it againe in the bely in the whiche the Mercury remained. Thou ſhalt repete this till the Mercury wax red. Then when it is red waſhe it with Cordiall waters, as Borage &amp; Balme and ſuch lyke.  But firſt waſhe it often tymes in fountain water or well water deſtilled. Mercury ſo prepared ſhalt thou giue to ſick men within their bodies, in this maner. If the body be very ſtrong, giue .x. grains if it be mean .viii. weakes, fiue: if it be a chyld, cō
               ſider diligently what is neceſſary to be done. But vtterly mixt it with triacle: ſo ſhalt thou giue it to him that is infected with poyſon, droyſy, peſtilēce or taken with other infirmitie. If a ſounde man once a yeare, or euery third yeare, as it ſhall ſeme  him good, vſe this Praecipitatum with a dew digeſtion of the humors, that is with a preparacion of purgacion, he ſhall preuent many diſeaſes. Note that in the ſtede of Mercury thou mayſt vſe Amal gama made of ſix partes of quick ſiluer and of one part of gold and ſo ſhalt thou worke greatter wō
               ders. (This Amalgama muſt be made red lyke as Mercury alone with Aqua fortis: although Mattheolus Senenſis, as we declared a litle before, wry teth that the pouder Mercurial may bee made of  ſuch a mixture, yee and that without Aqua fortis.)
               
And marke that thou maiſt heale woundes with the firſt or ſecond Praecipitatum, whiche thou ſhalt vſe thus: Put of it about the wound and within. And this is a great ſecret. And know that in .iiii. deſtillacions thou ſhalt bring this to pas: whiche doone, put it in a cleane bely in the fyer, that the ſpirites (that is of the Hydrargyri that is the quick ſiluer ſublimated mixt with the Praecipitatum) as muche as is poſſible may departe, then make as is aboue ſpecified. 
            
            Of the ſublimacion of quick ſiluer, thou ſhalt read Bulcaſis in his thirde booke of his worke that he calleth Seruitor. But of the vſe of it in burninges and ſeerynges, and for the French diſeas, reade Nicolaus Maſſa the ſixte booke, the ſeconde chapter, and of the ſame booke the fourth, howe it is to be ordered to ſeerynges, both otherwyſe, and that the ſeeryng or burning be done with none or litle grief. Certain vſe it at this day for the ill and angry ſkabes, and ring wormes or tettares. &amp;c.  aſwell in men as in horſes.
            Quick ſiluer (ſaieth Cardan) is ſublimated in this maner. Put Quick ſiluer and Shomakers inck of ether lyke weyght, and with moſte ſharpe whyte vynegar mixt it ſo long, till the quick ſiluer be ſeen no more: then in a veſſel of glas parieted with clay ſieth it till it growe together. If any doe run abrode &amp; cum not together, break it again in a morter with vinegar put to it, and ſieth it yet again.

Arſnick or Orpment (ſayeth Albertns Magnus in his booke of Metalles) is of the kynde of Stones, of a Citriny colour and reed, the which ſtone the chymici call one of the ſpirites. It hath the nature of Brymſtone in heating and drying. Being calcinated with the fyer it waxeth black, and by and by with ſublimation it becummeth mooſte whyte. If it be ſublimated three or foure tymes it purchaſeth ſuche ſtrengthe, that it wyll  peers through Bras, and burne vehemently all metalles except Gould. Being ſet in the ayre it altereth and chaungeth the ſame Bras in to a whyte colour. Wherfore Falſifiers vſe it, to make Bras lyke Syluer: in whiche thyng it is able to do very muche.

A certain practicioner told me that he did dres and prepare the ſtoone called Cyanence, that is, Lazulus in ſuch wiſe, that it might bring vp more ſtronglye and more ſafely black choler from melancholy men and thoſe that were mad. And firſt if I remember me well he ſaide it muſt be calcionated, then ſublimated: or firſt that the beſt Aqua vitae ſhoulde be deſtilled vppon it, putte in a Cucurbita or bellye, then ſublimated, and be ſprinckled or watered with Aqua vitae. vi. times deſtilled,  and dried again.
            Salt that it may be more pure to be put to medicines or meates, after it is mixt with water let it be deſtilled by a Filtrum, and again let it be ſod till the water be conſumed. The ſame purged in a gouldſmithes Crucibulo with a greate fyre is molten and fuſed. When it is ſo molten, lette it be mixt with Salt Alcalis (or in ſteade of it with the white gall of glas (for there is black alſo) which ſome call the noriſhmente of glas, other Zoza as  I heare, and with Sal Gemmae. When theeſe are beaten they vſe them for Chryſocolla, or alſo they put a little of Chryſocolla vnto it. But this mixture hath to much ſharpnes, and conſumeth ſome of ye gold. Wherfore they vſe it only to courſer workes, but to finer they vſe only Borax. Ther be ſōe that mixt Borax, commun ſalt molten and ſalt Alcalis together in equall porcions, and in ſecreate matters count it for Borax.

            THe medicins that we haue hitherto deſcribed are all comprehended vnder the name of lyquors  becauſe they haue no earthy matter mixte with them, but they are ether of a watry, or aiery, or fiery nature, whether ſo euer they be waters or oyls, or any third kind of liquor. Al are prepared in certain Alchymical veſſels and by the force of the fire. But for as much as their ſcope and ende (that is to the intent that the beſt and chiefe in euery medicin, might be had drawn out, pure and liquid from the earthye, groſe and more impure matter) ſemeth to be more large, and to be extended  alſo to manye other preparations, makinges and compoſicions of medicines: I thinck it good to ioyne certaine thinges hereunto in manner of a Corollarium or addicion whiche are not verye common, nor to be met with euery where. But no man ought to looke heare for a full or exacte and generall way of compoſition at our hands: when as we ſhal teache only a fewe, and ſuche as ſhall come to minde by the waye, and all theeſe as it were by matters beſides oure neceſſary purpoſe.  But if anye manne deſire moe and more fully of

            Of diuers Oyles.
            
               I Se the moſte part of odoriferous and precious oils to be ſod in a double veſſel It is an eaſy matter to pres oute an oyl that ſhalbe like the plant in ſauor &amp;  vertues, in thoſe that contein oyl aboundātly: (or out of the frutes of them ſod in water it is gathered.) But in ſuch as haue no great plenty of oyle, we are wont to pres oute the ſauor and ſtrengthe with the oyl .iii. waies. In the more common and moore aunciente waye, of Dioſcorides the flours were poured into pure oyl .iiii. dais, &amp; were ſet out in the ſun, then the oyl being preſt out, moſte diligently, as muche more of the new flours was added, and again it was ſet oute in the hot Sunne,  &amp; ſo oft might a man do ſo, til the oyl did drink vp the ſauour. They did ad alſo thicknings for oyntmentes, as of hony and odoriferous thynges.
            The ſecond way it ſtandeth in preſſinge oute, in ſom thinges without any help of Art, as Myrobalano, in other that be dry and odoriferous by their own accord, as the Nutmeg, that is light ſtiept in wine and pres out with a pres. So may a manne draw oyl oute of ſpices. But they that be odoriferous, and lack the ſubſtaunce of oyles, as flours,  they geue oyle in thys ſorte. Sprynkle Flowers

vppon Almondes and vnder them, and lay in order the leaues of Almondes and of the flours by courſe, and kepe them ſo longe preſt together, till the ſmel of the floures maye be vaniſhed awaye, then put them away and in their ſteede laye other flours after the ſame ſorte, and do this ſo ofte (for there is not one way in all) till the Almonds haue gotten a verye great ſmell, then haue them to the pres. A man muſt firſte blaunch them and parch them a little at the fyre. By this meanes the oyle  getteth the more ſtrengthe and vertue, and is les in daunger of corruption, becauſe no (waterye) iuice is left in it.
            The third way is by deſtillacion (whereof it is ſaid afore.) Cardan.
            
            Vnto the moſt parte of oyles that be to be ſod and made by fire, they put ſome wine, by the whiche meanes they ſmell les of aduſtion &amp; brētnes, &amp; they be ſod til the wine be conſumed. But flowers and ſuche as be of a ſclender ſubſtaunce, it is  better they ſhoulde not be ſodde in oyle, or at the leaſte not to boyle in it. &amp;c. A man muſte adde the moore wine, if there be many ſpecies that be mixt with the wine, and to be ſod ſomwhat long: ſo that ſomtimes the wine be almoſt double vnto the oil. Som be ſtiepte firſte in wine, and then the iuice preſt out is added to the oyle, &amp; is ſod together, ether by it ſelf, or with a part of Turpentin: as thei do in oyl of Hypericō
                or S. Ihons wurt.
            
               Iaſminum is made of .ii. ounces of flours of Iaſmin 
                ſette in the Sunne .v. dayes in a pounde of

oyl, whiche afterward is ſod with a ſlow fyer.
            Oyl of ſwiet Almondes, hooll Cloues beinge added therunto, let it be ſet in the ſun .viii. daies, it ſhalbe marueylous ſwiet ſmelling. But thou ſhalt reed diuers wayes in Meſue, and in the annotacions of Syluius vpon the ſame, of the preſſing out of oyll of Almondes, whiche alſo may be applyed to diuers other fruites and ſiedes from the whiche oyll is preſt out. ¶ We vſe the oyll of Almondes am. (that is bitter) in ſtede of oyll of ye 
                kirnelles of peeches, but it dryeth vp moore then the other, Braſſauolus.
            
            I am wont to make an oyll of ſiedes and the reed codes of Capſicum, or Cardamomū Arabicū: other of the codes therof alone, put in oyll, whiche is wont to be vſed in place of oyll of Peper, or alſo of Euphorbium, if it be put in in more abundance, for it is far more vehement then Peper. With vs (they call it reed Peper, ſum of the cōmun people call it Siliquaſtrum, but not ryghtly) but fewe of  thoſe ſilique or codes do wax rype, bycauſe of the haſty coold of harueſt. But vnrype codes alſo, hā
               ged in ſtoues a few daies and dried, may well be put vnto oyll. For they haue ſharpnes inough: whiche is not to be found in the hool plāt beſydes, when as the leeſt heares or ſtringes are without any taſte, and the leeues and ſtem are vnſauery: but in the codes is ſo excellēt a taſt, that it is worthy to be wondred at. Sum bycauſe of the vehement heat therof reken it almoſt emōgſt poyſons,  as Cardan: whiche I prayſe not. Nether was the

euer any man ſaid that fyer was venemous, burn it neuer ſo much: when it hath no venemous qualitie beſydes. I haue my ſelf vſed both the ſiedes of this Capſicum and the codes, without harm in potage but in a ſmall quantitie.
            An oyl of the kirnels of cheries clenſeth ye face, taketh away ſpottes and frakenes: it is good alſo for the gout, and the ſtone of the reynes &amp; bladder. It is made as oyl of ſwiet Almondes. Furne.
            
            Oyll of hay is thus made. Let the hay be ſet on  fyer and quenched: and after let it be layde vpon cooles, and when it is reſolued into ſmoock, lay an iron place vpon it and a certain vnctuoſitie or fatnes ſhall cleue vnto it, whiche is called oyll of hay. This oyll with a fether is anoynted vpon ring wormes and tetters: Rogerius.
            
            Oyl of whete is made betwene two iron plates moderatly made hoat (or as Raſis hath, between a marble and a thick plate of iron,) but muche better as I heare, by deſtillacion: it is commended  againſt the ruggednes of the ſkinne and ringwormes: Furnerius and other. Sum ſay alſo that it is good for fiſtulas, &amp; the chames or chinkes of the ſkin: Mat. Read befor emōgſt ye oyls deſtilled.

            I hear ſay ſom do not ſtiep them in wine, but  pres the very nuts alone beatē and heated. I my ſelf made of late verye good in this wiſe, beinge taught of a certain French man. I put in a glas about .v. ounces of Nutmegs ſomwhat groſe beten, for the ſpace of one nighte in wine ſo that the wine was higher by a finger bredthe. The nexte day I ſhut ye matter in a ſack of linnen, bound at the end, that they could not fal out: Thē I bound euery wher with thred that they ſhuld not com all together on a hepe. But the matter muſt firſte be  warmed in a ſkellet, not to much, but as much as

a finger may ſuffer, and ſo put in a litle bag muſt they be by &amp; by tied, and preſſed in a little preſſe of wod, with a litle lake or gutter of wod, hauing a ſpout enclining downward, the litle bag put ther in. &amp;c. They yeilde for the moſt part, the .viii. part of the weight of the nuts, ſo that one ounce of the nuts geue a dram of oyl, if the nuts be ſufficiētly moyſtie. A man may warm ye ſame matter again &amp; pres it as before: but the ſecond time yeldeth very litle oyl and not ſo good. It is better therfor to  leaue this matter and to dry it in the bag: whiche when nede ſhalbe may be laid to the ſtomak, or to the mouthe thereof. This oyle lately preſt oute is ſomwhat thick, and ſeparated as though it were by Hilloks, al which muſt be diligently gathered out of the wine, and the wine ſtreined from them with a linnen cloth, they be brought into one mas and lump, preſſing and wringing it with your fin gers to the diſh ſide wherinto the matter is cruſht out, that al the wine may be moſt diligently ſeperated.  The ſubſtaunce and the coloure appeareth like waxe. The mountenance of a peaſe annoynted vpon the mouth of the ſtomack, dothe meruelouſly ſtrēgthen it. I here ſay ſom vſe the anoynting of it to the ſturring vp of their luſte. Beinge ſwalowed, it heateth moderatly the ſtomack, and maketh ſwiet breth. ¶ I here more ouer that ſom ſieth the nuts beaten a while (I can not tell whether in wine or in water) and gather the fattines that ſwimmeth aboue. I remember alſo yt I ſaw  once an iron inſtrument like a pair of tonges, the

two extreme irons or ends wherof, conſiſted of. ii hollow half ſpheres, ſo that when they wer preſt together they might hold a Nutmegge, or a little les, as occaſion of the preſſing ſerued. The one of the half ſpheres was bored throughe with .iiii. or v. little holes, that the oyl might run out, whē the ends of the tonges moderatly made hot wer preſt together. I founde alſo this deſcripcion in a certain writen boke. Take .ii. pounds of Nutmegs. Thre ounces of Malmeſy, wherewith the Nutmegs  (ſomwhat groſe beaten) may be ſprinckled. Put to half a pounde of commun oyle elect: when they are all mixte together, let them be preſt cunninglye in a pres. But my waye, whyche I deſcribed afore and tried my ſelfe, liketh me moore then the other.
            There be many waies to make oyl of Rooſes. It is made ether with oyl and ripe Roſes, or bothe of them vnripe, or the one ripe, thother vnripe and ſo ther is .iiii. diuers waies. Som in ſtead of  commun oyle take oyl of Almondes. Raſis in hys Antidotario ſeperato putteth .iii. waies. Firſte. Take a pound of cōmun oil waſhed, wherin thou ſhalt put the fourthe parte of Grene Rooſes in a glaſed veſſell (of glas rather) which thou ſhalt ſet in the ſun for the ſpace of .iii. daies (ye .xl. as Aegi neta hath). Then ſtraine it and put it in a glaſſe. This waye is better then the other. The ſecond: Take oyl and Roſes as before, and hang the veſſell in a well ſo that it maye be touched of the water:  and after .ii. monethes take it oute, ſtraine it

and kepe it. The third: Oyl and Roſes as before, put them in a glas anoynted within with honye, which ſtopt thou ſhalt let it diep in ye erth, wher it ſhall not be touched nether with water nor other moiſture. ii, months. This oyl wilbe better ſmellinge then the other: Theſe writeth Raſis oute of Aegineta as it appeareth. Aegineta biddeth in the xx. chap. of the ſeuenth boke, vnto a Sextarium or wine pint of oyl Omphacinum (made of oliues not fully ripe) to put .iii. ounces of red Roſes the nails  taken awai, and for the ſpace of .xxiiii. hours laid out in the air, then the oyl to be ſet .xl. daies wtout dores in the ſun, not vpon the ground, but vpon a borde. ¶ Meſuae in the. 411. chapt. deſcribeth .iiii. waies. Firſt that freſh and new red roſes be ſet in the ſun .vii. daies, then let them be ſod in a double veſſel .iii. houres: then (the Roſe leaues wronge oute) let other be put in, and let them be ſet in the ſun and ſod as before. Which whē thou haſt done thriſe, put to the oyl water of infuſion of Rooſes,  yt is wherin Rooſes likewiſe haue ſtāded, (which he ſaithe, we haue preſcribed in the chapter of ſyrrups,) as it were the fourth of the oyl (that is, the fourth part, as the Munkes haue it. Syluius trā
               ſlateth it, as much as the oyl is, which I like not ſo well.) So when it is ſet in the ſunne .xl. daies, ſtraine it and ſette it longe againe in the Sunne. The ſecond, mixting with the oyl waſht the iuyce of Roſes, and the water of their infuſion, and the leaues beaten together: then ſetting it in the ſun  and chaunginge it as before. &amp;c. The thirde, that

Then beate thē again and kneed them in the morter very exactly, pouring vnto it a litle hoat water of infuſion of Roſes. At length prees out the oyll with a preſſe, &amp; put in a glas couered ſet it to ſū. The fourth, y• it be made with Seſamum blaunſhed after the ſame maner as with Almondes. But Almondes are  more mete for vnrype Rooſes: Seſama for rype. Thies hath Meſue, wher Syluius had it. The firſt compoſition (ſaith he) of the .iiii. now reherſed, is vſed of many: but of the Pariſians, the compoſition of Nicolas, whiche ſhalbe declared in his Antidotary. And againe, I heare that oyll of Roſes is is made moſte odoriferous, by putrifying the roſes one moneth in dung in a veſſell well ſtopt. After the ſame maner of commun Maſtick, and Roſes incarnate and Muſke Roſes and ſuche lyke,  I doubt not but it may be made moſt odoriferous without the mixture of any oyll. ¶ Sieth Roſes, Wormwod, or any other odoriferous herb in water with the fourth part of oyl, til all the water be conſumed, and the oyll ſhall haue the ſtrengthes and vertues of the herbes. So ſhalt thou make oyll out of hand of any thing. Cardanus out of Symeon. ¶ There be ſum that when the Rooſes are beeten, and ſod in only water, ſay there ſwimmeth a certain fat foom, whiche may be ſtreined or gathered  with a fether. ¶ An other certain man told

me, that the leaues of Roſes new ſhould be ſod in water til they be thick as hony almoſt, then cruſht with a ſpoon, that the oyll or foom may enter in to it: but ſum water wilbe mixt alſo with it, wherfore when it is gathered in a glas, it is ſet in the ſun &amp; ye oyl ſwiming aboue in ye top is ſeparated.

               Of oyll of Tartarum, that is the dry Lies of wyne.
            
               OYll of Tartarum deuyſed by Peter Argil 
                
               lata, ſerueth to clenſe the face and to ſmouth it. Tartarum cleauing to the ſydes of the veſſell, whyte rather then red made into pouder, is ſtept in vinegar, after it is folded in a linnen cloothe, then lette it be put in Tow moyſtened with water vnder the aſhes: after that let it be laid in a diſh hielding towad the one ſyde .iii. daies: then ſhall a certaine humor ſumwhat red deſtill.
            
               Nicolas way to make oyl of Tartarum cleaning  to the ſydes of the veſſels. Take that Tartarū
                that is of good wyne beaten, folded in a linnen cloth, moyſten it well with ſtrong whyte vynegar: ſieth it vnder hoat aſhes (burn it) til it wax black, beet it again, kepe it in a veſſell lying on the one ſyde enclyned eight daies, in a cold place, til it be reſolueed into oyl, whiche if it doo not, pres it out and kepe it. The ſame wayes doth Meſues make oyls of egs. It wer better, whē ye 
               Tartarū
                is calcinated and put it in a Hippocras bagge, as they call it, &amp;  let it be put in a dry place, till the oyll runne out

into a veſſel ſet vnder it. Syluius. I fynd an other certain maner in Furnerius in a Frenche booke of decking, where as he biddeth to take Tartarū
                burned and calcinated, as muche as can be taken at two handfulles and tied ſtraite in a linnen clout to be burnt and calcinated in a furnace of Glas, Lyme or Brick: thē to be powred into a good quā
               titie of water with as muche Alum as a nut and to be muche ſturred aboute: then when thou haſt let reſt .xxiiii. houres, ſtreine this water (caſting  that away that remaineth in the linnen cloth) and ſieth it in a ſkillet, till nothing els then a certayne whyte cruſt remaine. &amp;c. (this place ſemeth to be mangled,) whiche (hanged in a litle bag) ny to the earth, within thre daies thou ſhalt ſee it turned in to liquor: whiche muſte be a certain tymes ſtrained til it becum cleer.
            Sum put Tartarum to be calcinated in a newe pot in a potters ouen, and when the veſſelles are all baked then take it out. But I thinke it ſhould  be calcinated better &amp; moore purely in hoat aſhes or cooles, as apples or wardens are wonte to bee roſted happing them alſo with cooles. It ſhalbe inough burnt, when it ſhall appeare nowe whyte nor any more black, whē it is ſo burnt, they hang it in a litle bag with a ſharp end lyke a ſpyr ſtieple tund vpſyde doun, the mouth or wyde end put in a clouen ſtick wherby it ſhall hang and be preſt together, wt a phiall of glas ſet vnder with a tunnil.
            An other way. Take equall porcions of Tantarum 
                and Salnitrum pund, burne them in a larg

pot: then grinde or breake them with a hotte iron and put them in a little bagge in a wine celer, that they may deſtill.
            An other. Beat Tartarum and Nitrum in equal parts, mixt them and burn them that the Nitrum maye be conſumed. The Tartarum that remayneth: put in a bladder (that is a glas like a bladder) hang it in hot water, and it ſhallbe ſtreighte reſolued into oyle. ¶ An other. Tartarum well waſhte from the dregs and verye wel dried ſhalt  thou calcinat till it waxe white: Then when it is beaten and ſifted, diſſolue it with raine water deſtilled and made warme: when it is molten deſtill it by a Filtrum: then lette it gather into a Iellye: when it is ſo, calcinat it againe that it may waxe more white. So at lengthe ſhalt thou hange it in a little bagge, as an Hippocras bagge in a moyſt place: laye on ſome brode thinge for a couer, that no vncleane thinge fall into it, and ſetting a glaſed pot vnder it.

But Braſſauolꝰ writeth that the Apothecaries do falſly attribute vnto this oyl the vertue to put away ſkars, to the intente they may get egges from foliſhe people.

Oyll of wormes or bowels of the earth is commended for the aſſwaging of griefes, ſpecially of the ſinewes &amp; ioyntes, alſo if they cum of the frēch diſeaſes.

            In the ſecretes of Variguanus, we reed that certain haue been preſently and out of hande deliuered  from a cotidiā ague being anoynted with the

oyll of Scorpions.
            Oyll of Scorpions whoſe operacion is maruelous againſt poyſons ſpecially of Serpentes and other beates, and peculiarly againſt Napellum, is written by Matthaeolus Senenſis in his ſixt booke of his commētaries vpon Dioſcorides imprinted in Italian, from whence we haue tranſlated it into Latin. This oyll (ſaith he) anoynted vppon the pulſing veynes, where they appeare moſte, as of the temples, handes and fiet, and in  the place of the hart, ſo that euery third hower the anoynting be repeted, deliuereth ſafely from all poyſons within the body receyued, that haue no gnawyng nor frettyng operacion: and lykewyſe from the bytinges of Eddars, Aſpes, and any other venemous beaſt. The compoſition therof is thus, whiche I let bee knowen abroode, that the hool worlde may knowe and confeſſe my lyberall and good hart. In the begynning of May take thre pound of commun oyll of a hundreth yeare  old, or certenly the eldeſt of all that may be found. Thre handful of Hypericon or ſaint Iohns wurt freſh, (with the herbe and flowers.) Put the oyll into a bely of glay, twyſe as big as for the meaſur thereof, and when the Hypericon is a litle beaten put it in vpon it. Then the veſſell being ſtopt, ſet it in moſte fyne ſand vp to the midſt where it may be made hoat the hool day of the ſun, for the ſpace of ten or twelue daies. After thou ſhalt put it in Balneo Marie fowre and twenty howres. 
               
Then pres out the oyll from the herbe and put to Hyperici, Chamedryos, Calaminthae, Cardui ſancti, of euery one a handfull moderatly beeten: and put them again into the bath for .iii. daies. Afterward thou ſhalt ſtreine them and pres them: and putting to them .iii. handfuls of flowers of Hypericon well pickt from the ſtalkes, and wel beeten, ſet it again .iii. daies in Balneo Mariae, and pres it out as before. This ſhalt thou repete .iii. or .iiii. tymes, till the oyll haue gotten a colour as red as  bloud. Afterward take the ſedes of ye tender parts of Hypericon, or the huſkes lyke to the cornes of barly, wherin the ſedes ly hid, in ſuche plenty that it may be equall with the three handfulles: beate thies ſprinkling vpon them a litle whyte wyne, &amp; power it into the ſaid oyll. then bery it in ſand in the ſun eight daies, and ſtraight after in the bath for .iii. daies. Streine and pres it as before. And do this thre or .iiii. tymes putting in new tenderlynges of Hypericon, till a very ſad or darke reed  colour remaine in it. After this, take freſh Scordium, Calamint,, the les Centaury, Carduum ſanctum, Veruin, Dictamnum Creticum, of euery one halfe a handfull. When they are beaten, put them into oyll: and put them in a bath for twoo daies. Strein them and pres them as before. Then take Zedoariae, the roote of whyte Dictamni, Gentian, Tormentillae, Ariſtolochiae root, of euery one thre drams: of freſhe Scordium a handfull. When they are beaten together, power them in and let them  ſtand thre daies in the bath, ſtrein and pres. And

again, put into the oyl Styracis Calamitae, Belzoi or Laſerpitii, of ether .vi. drammes: the bearies of Iuniper .iiii. drams: Nigellae. iii. drams: odoriferous Caſiae. ix. drammes, white Saunders .iiii. drams: Scoenanthi, Cuperis of ether a dram and a half, when they are beaten pour them in, and put them into the bath .iii. daies, ſtraine and pres. After, take .xxx. liue Scorpions, gathered in the Caniculer daies, and put them in a belly of glas vpon hot aſhes, and when thou ſeeſt them ſweate  for heat, and to ſend out an humor, power vppon them al the forſaid oyl hot (but not ſo hot, that the veſſell breake therwith,) and ſodenlye ſtoppe the mouth of the veſſell, and put it in a bath .iii. dais. Then ſtrain it and pres it, and caſt awai the ſcorpions now ſod: and put into the oyle Rhabarbi Electiſſimi, commun Mirh, Aloes Hepaticae, of euery one .iii. drams, Spiknard .ii. drams, one dram of Saffron: Triacle elect, Mithridatii perfecti, of ether half an ounce. When they are beaten poure  them in and put it in a bath .iii. dais, and ſtrain it no more after that, but ſet it vp, and keepe it as a balm.

But dry fomentacions do drye and  draw outward, and heaten more. Moiſt be ether liquid or running as ſimple water, or

Celſus in ſome places commendeth the iuice of hotte Salte, and in an other place he ſaithe it is moſt holſome to make fomentacions wyth moyſte Salte.

In the diſeaſe of the necke called Tetanus, whiche is the ſtifnes of the ſinnewes (ſaith Celſus) it is neceſſarie to haue a moyſte and warme fomentacion. Therfore the moſte part of men do pour often vpon the neckes much hotte thinges. That procureth preſently eaſe, but it maketh the ſinewes more apt to receiue cold: which ought to  be auoided. Therfore it were beter to anoynt the nek with ſome waxed moiſture, then to laye Oxe bledders, or like thinges filled with hotte oyle, or ſome hot plaſter of bran, or rounde Pepper with figs beaten But the beſt of al is to make fomentation with moiſt ſalt.

A fyer brand alſo brent, foulded in a moyſt cloth is in ſtede of a hoat fomentacion in Celſus.

            Of certain iuices.
            THe iuices of certain herbes wrong and preſt out, are ſod at fyer or dryed in the ſun, as Bulcaſis teacheth ſeuerally of the iuice of Hamſig, Plantain, Lettis, Singrien, Purſelan, Roſtrum Purcinum, or hogges ſnout, Scariola, Fenel, Smalage, Volubili, Sorrell, and other.
            A maruelous waye to drawe out the iuice out of black Elleborum, whiche ſum vſe as a ſecrete  myſtery, the commoditie whereof I alſo trying

would not hyde, leſt I ſhould ſeme to be ſory that our poſteritie ſhuld haue any excellēt knowledge. who founde this way firſt I can not ſaye I learned it of certain my moſte ſecret friendes I mean that black Elleborum whiche communly all men in Germany name in lyke maner, lyke vnto Conſiligo, very many kepe it in their gardēs: but that whiche groweth vpon the moūtaines, to be found in our countrey Heluetia is beſt. A man may trye the ſame way in Colocynthida Eſula, Laureola, &amp;c.  Sieth lightly in water the routes of black Elleborum cleen and waſht, ſet infuſed in the ſame firſt a night or more, ſmall cut. Thou ſhalt take hede both in this and in the other decoctions that thou ſkim away diligently al the foom that ſwymmeth aboue, as venemous. This water ſhalt thou kepe and again power other vnto it warm, and heet it a whyle moderatly, chaunging the water ſo oft til the routes retein none or very litle bitternes any more: whiche ſhall cum to pas when thou haſt  chaunged the water ſeuen or nyne tymes. But in the meane ſpace whyle thou chaūgeſt the waters, deſtill the firſt euer with a Filtrum or through a bruſh: and at length ſieth all with a ſlowe fyer, or with burnt cooles rather, ſo that they boyl not, yet let them be alwayes at the poynt of boyling, vntil they be as thick as hony in an earthen pot glaſed, or of bras tinned, the pot couered or litle opē. Whē as now a litle water remaineth, about the ende of the ſiething, ſtur it about gently now and then wt 
                a ſtick, that the iuice be not burnt too, and at the

ſame time for a pound of rotes of Elleborum, thou ſhalt put .ii. drammes of Maſtik pund, and ceaſe not to ſturre it, other continuallye, or by little diſtaunces, til the iuice ſeme out and out ſufficiently thickened, whiche wil chaunce ſodenlye for the mooſte parte: and that the matter may be the les burnt, the nere vnto the ende and to the thickning the iuice is, ſo much vrge it with les fyre: nor be not weary of the time: for thou ſhalt haue a moſt excellent and exquiſite medicine againſte diuers  diſeaſes, ſpeciallye melancholik diſeaſes. It ſhal become of a darke red coloure, of moſte bitter ſauour, with a percing ſharpnes, like as is in Aſarum or Aſaraba

                  cha, and Cloues, but ſtronger, ye burning as it ſemeth to the taſter: yet is not burning in deede, that is becauſe of the tenuitie and ſclendernes of the partes, as I wold haue tried. It is miniſtred an hour after ſupper, in the moū
               tenance of a peaſe, in all diſeaſes whereunto Elleborus is conueniente, and where it is good to loſe  the bealy. One pill of that quantity that I ſaide. wil make a man to haue .iiii. ſtoules. But I hear that certaine when they had taken to muche, as much perauentur as a beane, they haue ben emptied to ofte by the bealye and vomiting, and haue bene verye muche weakened: whiche I to take heede of, vſinge the counſell of a certaine learned Phiſicion I woulde brynge to iuyce, not the Elleborum alone, but infuſed and decocted with other diuers medicines, as I ſhall declare by and by.  I perceiue it ſkilleth little whether the rootes be

taken grene or dry. But a man muſt take a poūd at the leaſte of the rotes. Lullius and other (Cardan) haue made mention of the quinteſſence of Elleborum, where vnto I thincke this iuice to bee nothing inferiour. This truelye is worthye to be wondred at, that the iuice ſo longe decocted is not onlye nothinge weaker but alſo muche ſtronger: for it ſeemeth, (that I may ſpeake of coniecture) that one parte of this iuice to be tenne times and more ſtronger then Elleborus it ſelfe, and yet nothing  more daungerous or hurtful: but the ſtrēgthe withoute harme is encreaſed. And although I my ſelfe woulde haue remitted and aſſwaged his ſtrengthe, puttinge to manye medicines, yet I can commende more this ſimple waye alreadye deſcribed, where as nothinge but a little Maſtik is added at the laſte, ſpeciallye for more hard and greuous diſeaſes, where neceſſitie requireth extreame medicines: and for Franticke perſones and otherwiſe madde and dotinge, whiche when  they can not be compelled to take anye medicins, they are the eaſier deceiued with ſo little a doſi in quantitye. Yea alſo withoute the bodye for venemous bitinges and ſinnewes hurte, I canne beleue that the vertue of it ſhoulde be mooſte excellent. I finde no iuice made in this ſorte in anye authors: the iuice of Acatia and of Berberies in Bulcaſis. For the ſtraininge of it onlye is decocted, not that which is depreſſed oute: alſo the iuice of Galbanus and Licoris: but the water in them  is not chaunged.

The ſame Bulcaſis alſo, willeth to put to a little gum to certaine iuices that be preſt out which are ſod by them ſelues at the fire, that the partes of thē may better cleue together, as the iuice of wormwod &amp; gaſid, that is Eupatorium or nightſhade: alſo of Centaury, and  Gentian (which is made of a decoction ſtrained.) But Maſtik is mixt with ye iuice of Elleborus, not onlye for this cauſe, but alſo to amende the venemous vertue therof and contrary to the ſtomak. Moreouer in certain other medicins, wher a mā liſt to encreaſe the ſtrength and vertue of any medicin which is to be left and laid away in ſome liquor, we chaung not the liquor, but the medicin: that is euer when the firſt is ſtrained, putting in new medicin into the ſame liquor, as in many decoctions  and oyles: but here in the iuice of Elleborus we do contrary: For keping the ſame rotes of the Elleborus, we chaunge oft the liquor. I maye tel the cauſe, becauſe ye rote of Elleborus aboue all other things, hath moſt ſtrōg vertues, not in ye ſuperficial &amp; other parts only, but in ye hole ſubſtāce imprinted vehemētly &amp; faſtly: wherfore it may be alſo kept moſt long of al other. I my ſelf vſed it, when it was .x. yeares olde, in his full ſtrengthe. And certaine common Practicioners bidde men  drinke for the louſinge of the belly the wine wher

in a part of it hath ſooked a nighte and the nexte daye is ſtrained, and the rotes to be dried again: for they are nothing or veri litle weaker therwith although they be ſomewhat often repeated to the ſame vſe and dried again. But of Elleborus it ſelf and what we haue tried and experimented therof, perauenture we ſhal once haue an other place and occaſion to wryte of.
            Pils of blak Elleborus, or rather of his iuice, is to be taken euery ſeuenth day in the curing of the  French diſeaſe that is Melancholy, as Matthaeolus coūſelith. Three drams of the rootes of blacke Veratrum or Elleborus freſh and new: Dauci or yelow-Caret, Aniſi, Peper, of euery one a dram .vi. grains of Moſth. ii ſcrupuls of Epithy mii or the harder time: let all theeſe be lightlye beaten: then when they haue ſtand to ſoke a day and a nighte, v. poundes of Malmſye (heare ſemeth to be ſom fault of the printer, for it is to great a meaſure of wine) let them be mightilye preſt oute. Take .iii.  drams of this expreſſion: of the pouder of pils of Fumitory, Cochiarum, Aurearum, of euery one. ii drams and a half, knede them together, and then let them be dried. Moreouer when they are dry &amp; made againe in pouder, thou ſhalt ſtiepe them again in the ſame Malmſy, as before .iiii. tymes. The pilles thereof, muſte be taken at one time, to the weight of one dram.
            Oure iuice compoſed and made of Elleborus. Two poundes of Blacke Elleborus newe cutte:  Liquoris ſcraped and bruſed with a peſtil a poūd

ſtiep them a night in a good quantitie of water. The next day after ſieth them an houre &amp; a halfe with a ſlow fyer, or .ii. houres, power it out ſtraining it, and put in to it other water warm (which ſhalbe redy in a chafer by the fyr for this purpoſe. Repete this ſeuen tymes or more. Then caſtyng away the routes, take the hooll water ſtreined or deſtilled by a Filtrum, and ſieth it by litle and litle and when as yet a litle of it ſhall remaine, power vnto it this decoctiō: Seuen handfull of Betain,  Agrimony two handfull, Aniſi. iii. vnces, ſtiep thē in water and ſieth them till the conſumpcion and waſting of the thirde parte: pres it out, ſtrayne it twys or thrys, at the length put to fiue vnces of Agaricum elect cut ſmal: flower deluce two vnces and a half: Cinamon ſix drams, Ginger halfe an vnce: ſieth them to the half, pres them out &amp; ſtrain the water as befor. Then power this decoction to the decoction of the Elleborus boyling moderatly: and let them be 
                  •
               od together to the thicknes of hony.  A litle before the ende put to .iiii. drams of the pouder of Maſtick .ii. drammes of Scammonium: thies diſſolued together in a litle of the decoction of Elleborus, that it may be lyke the ſubſtaunce of hony, not muche before the end of the decotion power it in, (when the iuice ſhalbe moderatly thyck, or beginneth to be thick) and thou ſhalt ſtur it about till the iuice be conſumed. Thou ſhalt trye now and then a drop of the iuice, let it fall vpon a tinnen

               rencher, and when it ſhalbe ſo thick that it  wil almoſt run no more abrode when thou leeneſt

the trencher on the one ſyde or lifts it vp, then is the iuice perfect. But by the ſpace of an houre or more before the ende thou ſhalt now and then ſtur it about with a ſlow fyer, leſt it burn too. Of this decoctiō I had almoſt .xi. vnces of iuice: I thinck I ſhould haue had ſkarſly ye fourth parte, if I had ſod Elleborum alone. This iuice haue I vſed alredy ſumtymes: for I miniſtred it vnto a yonge man ſik of the falling euill, with good ſucces, who now of long tyme God be thanked, is well: but  with many other medicines alſo ther with, as letting of bloud and ſweeting. &amp;c. And an other certain perſon moleſted for .iii. yeares with the Aſcarides or litle round wormes breeding in the long gut, many medicines tryed in vayne, was reſtored with this iuice once receiued, and a few dayes after taking hartes horn burnt. Pilles of the bignes of a pees, from .ii. to fiue may be miniſtred after ſupper, that is from half a ſcrupull or there about to a hool. But a man may try thies better in  proces of time. This doo I admoniſh phyſicions that be litle exerciſed, that thei vſe it not raſhly but with diligent conſideration: for it is a vehement medicine. It ſemeth to be conuenient and good for the quartain ague, that is no more rawe, and for other diuers great and long diſeaſes, &amp; ſpecially for the ſcab cumming of black choler. I gaue of la

I imputed the cauſe to the diſtemperaunce of the man. I my ſelf taking two pyles lyke peaſen

after ſopper, ye next day I felt no ſmal grief about my ſtomak, I auoyded ſūtymes downward, but I vomited not. A man may more ſafly giue it to thē yt be ſufficiently ful of fleſh or fat, of a moyſt ſtomack, and a ſtomack of moo exquiſite ſence.

               LAſt of all wee wyll teache and declare here certain thinges of made and counterfeit wynes, yet not of all of purpoſe,  whiche ſhould be to long. Who ſo deſireth mo kindes of made wynes, and their compoſitions and vertues let him go to Dioſcorides, Aetius in his laſt booke, and to the booke of Arnold Villa nouani of wynes. ¶ Wynes mixt with medicines are made diuers waies: firſt ſiething the medicines with the wyne whyle it is muſt and new, for the moſte part to the conſumpcion of the third part, ſkumming in the meane ſeaſon &amp; ſtraining afterward. Sum ſieth the wyne alone: other till ye 
                third part be cōſumed, other much les: afterward they hang within the wyne in a litle bag the medicines ſumwhat gros betē. And bitter medicines ſpecially ought to be put in decocted and ſod wyne (for ſo it waxeth ſwiet) in a litle bad, or els to be ſod together, or both. So are wynes made wt wormewood, with Zedoaria, with Inula, alſo wt Borrage and Meliſſa, in Arnold. Sum ſieth a litle newe muſt and when it is couled, they power it vpon the herbes in the veſſell. Secondly putting the  herbes them ſelues or the medicines dry in ye new

wyne, before it be hoat, that by the heet of it in the veſſel, the vertue of the medicin may be mixt with it: So the mooſte men with vs prepare wyne of wormwood, and they let it ſtande a hooll wynter in the veſſels, euer filling the veſſels again, if thei draw any thing out of it, in the beginning of vere they take the herbes out: ſum leue them in al ſummer alſo, but yet it is eaſely corrupted, waxeth hoor and mouldy, and ſower ſpecially if the veſſell bee not full. Sum ſet a plate of iron tinned boored  through with many hooles, within the veſſell about the tap or ſpigot, that it be not ſtopt with the medicines that are put in. A man may any tyme of the yeare put wormwood or other herbes in old wyne in a litle veſſell, ſpecially in cellers that bee ſumwhat coule, or in a great glas well ſtopt: if ſo be it the route callet Cariophyllata dry be put to, y• wyne ſhalbe preſerued the lōgar. Other ſieth ſimpely with wyne the medicine whoſe vertue they would haue to pas in the wyne, at any time of the  yeare: but ſod wynes for the mooſte parte, breeth out and becum almoſte ſower: therfore I allowe rather the medicines beaten to bee ſtiept in wyne together wt clarified hony or ſugar a fewe houres, and then after to be ſtrained ſumtymes through an Hippocras bag. So haue I made ſumtymes wyne good for them that were ſick of the dropſy, of the rout of flowre deluce, and for them that wer ſhort wynded of Inula. &amp;c. Wyne may alſo be mixt and ſtreined with the iuices of herbes clarified: or  els the iuice of them whiche dry beaten, haue been

hanged in a litle bag in it a few daies, to be preſt oute and when it is ſtrained to be mixte with the wine, and newe medicines to be put into the bag, &amp;c. for if the matter be preſt oute often and newe put to, the wine ſhall be the ſtronger, and we ſhall fil the veſſel now and then for that that is drawn oute: for if not, the wine will become euerye foote weaker.
            Wines medicined (as we haue ſaide) maye be made, leauinge the medicines put in a bagge, or  ſimplely in Muſt or new wine, that they ma

                heat together: or in wine ſethinge at the fire But the firſt way is preferred bycauſe by it the vertue of the medicines is not reſolued, nor altered or wekened. The hole of the conſeruatiue veſſel ought to be couered with a litle couer, that the heat may brethe out moderatly, and yet the odour fewm not out to much. Yet if ye thinke good to ſethe them in wine at the fire, let the fire be made moſte ſlowe, and continued without ſmoke, with the veſſel couered,  leaſt it brethe out, and let it be ſod a certain ſpace (with a bigger or les fire, according as the ſubſtance of euery thing requireth, Arnold in his boke of wine.

            Wine of Wormwode howe it is made, I haue  alreadye ſaide before. Some make it with onlye

Wormwode: other mixte with it other diuers herbes, ſpeciallye hotte: as Hyſſop, Rue, Sage, Cardnus Benedictus, Peny royall, Coſtus Hortenſis, Phyllitides, the floures of Eldar, the Barkes of Aſhe. I make ſomtimes in a glas forthwith, putting the leaues of Wormwode dry, into Malmſy and burninge water, thriſe deſtilled of ether like much. This may be long kept: a litle of it put to a great deale of wine, doth ſeaſon it holly with the qualitie of Wormwode. It is good for a cold ſtomake,  it duſcuſſeth winde, it healeth the fleumatik colik, and that is bred of wind: it healeth ſcabbednes being annoynted vppon: Arnoldus in hys boke of wines. ¶ A better way of making it ſaith he, that the Wormwod grene or dry be beatē, and that the wine warme be ſtraind vpon it certaine times, til it receiue the ſauour and vertue of it, and to ſeaſon it with Suger or Honye: this waye to make this wine is better then other, becauſe all the ſtrength of the Wormwod is in the ſuperficiall  and outward parts of it, which by this menes is beſt drawn out: then is he long in rekening the vertues of it, Galangal or Aniſe maye alſo be added, or any other thinge as a man thinkes good. ¶ Wine of Mugwort is made in the ſame manner that wormwode wine is.
            Wine of the kirnels of Alkckengi or Haliacacabus, is made the ſame way, ſtraining the wine vp on them beaten, for one Doſis, of it thou ſhalt take from .v. to .x. it bringeth out ſtony matter frō the  rains and bladder manifeſtlye, and guideth oute the water that is reteined and kept in (ſee Arnold

Some put the graines of Haliacacabus hole into newe wine in a little veſſel, that they may ſieth together, and kepe it for their vſe.
