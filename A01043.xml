            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            Apophthegmes NEW AND OLD. COLLECTED BY THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE, Francis LO. VERVLAM, Viscount St. ALBAN.
            LONDON, Printed for Hanna Barret, and Richard Whittaker, and are to be sold at the Kings Head in Pauls Church-yard. 1625.
         
      
      
         
            
            
            
               Apophthegmes new and old.
            
               IVlius Caesar, did write a Collection of Apophthegmes, as appeares in an Epistle of Cicero.

I need say no more, for the worth, of a Writing, of that nature. It is pitie his Booke is lost: for I imagine, they were collected, with Iudgement, and Choice: whereas that of Plutarch,
               
and Stobaeus, and much more, the Moderne ones, draw much of the dregs. Certainly, they are of excellent vse. They are, Mucrones Verborum, Pointed Speeches. Cicero prettily

cals them, Salinas, Salt pits; that you may extract salt out of, and sprinkle it, where you will. They serue, to be interlaced, in continued Speech. They serue, to be recited, vpon occasiō of themselues.

They serue, if you take out the kernell of them, and make them your owne. I haue, for my recreation, in my sicknesse, fann'd the Old; Not omitting any, because they are vulgar;

(for many vulgar ones are excellent good;) Nor for the meannesse of the Person; but because they are dull, and flat: And added many New, that otherwise would haue died.
            
               
1. WHEN Queene Elizabeth had aduanced Ralegh, she was one day playing on the virginalls, and my Lo. of Oxford, &amp; another Noble-man, stood by. It fell out so, that the Ledge, before the Iacks, was taken away, so as the Iacks were seene: My Lo. of Oxford, and the other Noble-man

smiled, and a little whispered: The Queene marked it, and would needes know, What the matter was? My Lo. of Oxford answered; That they smiled, to see, that when Iacks went vp, Heads went downe.
            
            2. Henrie the fourth of France, his Queene was great with Childe. Count Soi
                  •…
               
               ons,

that had his expectation vpon the Crowne; when it was twice or thrice thought, that the Queene was with Childe before, said to fome of his Frends; That it was but with a pillow. This had some wayes come to the Kings eare, who kept it til when the Queen waxed great; call'd the Count of Soissons to

him, and said, laying his hand vpon the Queenes belly; Come Cousin, it is no pillow. Yes, Sir, (answered the Count of Soissons) it is a pillow, for all France to sleepe vpon.
            
            3. There was a conference in Parliament, betweene the Vpper House, &amp; the Lower, about a Bill of Accountants,

which came downe, from the Lords, to the Commons: which Bill prayed, that the Lands of Accountants, whereof they were seized, when they entred vpon their Office, mought bee liable to their Arreares, to the Queene. But the Commons desired, that the Bill mought

not looke backe, to Accountants that were alreadie, but extend onely to Accountanes hereafter. But the Lo. Threasurer said: Why, I pray, if you had lost your purse, by the waie, would you looke forwards, or would you looke backe? The Queene hath lost her purse.
            
            
               
4. Queene Elizabeth, the morrow of her Coronation, went to the Chappell; and in the great chamber, Sir Iohn Rainsford, set on by wiser Men, (A Knight that had the libertie of a Buffone) besought the Queene aloud; That now, this good time, when prisoners were deliuered, foure prisoners, amongst the rest,
               
               mought likewise haue their libertie, who were like enough, to bee kept still in hold. The Queene asked; Who they were? And hee said; Matthew, Mark, Luke, &amp; Iohn; who had long beene imprisoned, in the Latine tongue; and now he defired, they mought goe abroad, among the people, in English. The Queene answered, with a

graue countenance; It were good (Rainsford) they were spoken with themselues, to know of them, whether they would be set at libertie?
            
            5. The Lo. Keeper, Sir Nicholas Bacon, was asked his opinion, by Queene Elizabeth, of one of these Monopoly Licences; And hee answered;

               Will you haue me speake truth, Madame? Licentiâ omnes deteriores sumus. Wee are all the worse for a Licence.
            
            6. Pace, the bitter Foole, was not suffered to come at the Queene, because of his bitter humor. Yet at one time, some perswaded the Queene, that hee should come to her, vndertaking

for him, that hee should keepe compasse. So hee was brought to her, and the Queene said; Come on Pace, now we shall beare of our faults. Saith Pace; I doe not vse to talke of that, that all the Towne talkes of.
            
            7. My Lo. of Essex, at the succor of Rhoan, made 24. Knights;

which at that time was a great matter. Diuerse of those Gentle-men, were of weake and small meanes; which when Queene Elizabeth heard, shee said; My Lo. mought haue done well, to haue built his Almes-House, before he made his Knights.
            
            8. A great Officer in France, was in danger

to haue lost his place. But his wife, by her suite, and means making, made his peace: whereupon a pleasant Fellow said; That he had been crushed, but that he saued himselfe vpon his hornes.
            
            9. Queene Anne Bullen, at the time, when she was led to bee beheaded, in the Tower,

called one of the Kings Priuie Chamber to her, and said to him; Commend mee to the King, and tell him, he is constant in his course of aduancing me. From a priuate Gentle-woman, he made me a Marquisse; and from a Marquisse, a Queene; and now he had left no higher degree of earthly honour, hee hath made me a Martyr.
            
            
               
10. Bishop Latimer said, in a Sermon, at Court; That hee heard great speech, that the King was poore, and many waies were propounded to make him rich: For his part, he had thought of one way, which was; That they should helpe the King to some good office, for all his Officers were rich.
            
            11. Caesar Borgia, after

long diuision, betweene him and the Lords of Romagna, fell to accord with them. In this accord, there was an Article, that hee should not call them, at any time, all together, in person: The meaning was, that knowing his dangerous nature If hee meant them treason, some one mought be free, to reuenge

the rest. Neuerthelesse, hee did with such art, and faire vsage, win their confidence, that hee brought them all together to Counsell at Sinigalia, where hee mur

               her'd them all. This Act, when it was related vnto Pope Alexander his Father, by a Cardinall, as a thing happy, but verie persidious,

the Pope said; It was they, that had broke their Couenant first, in comming all together.
            
            12. Pope Iulius the third, when hee was made Pope, gaue his Hat vnto a youth, a Fauourite of his, with great scandall. Wherupon, at one time a Cardinall, tha
                  •…
                mought bee fre
                  •…
                with him, said modestly

to him; What did your Holinesse see in that young man, to make him Cardinall? Iulius answered, What did you see in mee, to make me Pope?
            
            13. The same Iulius, vpon like occasion of speech, why hee should beare so great affection to the same young Man, would say; That he had found
               
               by Astrologie, that it was the youths Destinie, to be a Great Prelate; which was impossible, except himselfe were Pope; And therefore, that hee did raise him, as the Driuer on of his owne Fortune.
            
            14 Sir Thomas Moore had onely Daughters, at the first; And his Wife did euer pray for a Boy: At last hee

had a Boy; which after, at Mans yeeres, proued simple. Sir Thomas said to his Wife; Thou prayedst so long for a Boy, that hee will bee a Boy, as long as he liues.
            
            15. Sir Thomas Moore, the day he was beheaded, had a Barber sent to him, because his haire was long, which was thought, would

make him more commiserable, with the people. The Barber came to him, and asked him; Whether he would be pleased to bee trimm'd? In good faith honest fellow, (said Sir Thomas) the King and I haue a suit for my Head, and till the Title be cleared, I will doe no cost vpon it.
            
            16. Stephen Gardiner

Bishop of Winchester, a great Champion of the Papists, was wont to say of the Protestants, who ground vpon the Scripture; That they were like Poasts, that bring truth in their Letters, and lies in their Mouths.
            
            17. The Lacedemonians were besieged by the Athenians, in the Fort of Peile; which

was won, and some slaine, and some taken. There was one said, to one of them that was taken, by way of scorne; Wer

18. After the Defeat of Cyrus the younger, Falinus was sent, by the King, to the Grecians, (who had, for their part, rather Victorie, than otherwise,) to command them, to yeeld their Armes. Which when it was denied, Falinus said to Clearchus; Well then, the King lets you know, that if you remoue from the
               
               place, where you are now encamped, it is warre; if you stay, it is Truce; What shall I say, you will doe? Clearchus answered; It pleaseth vs, as pleaseth the King. How is that? saith Falinus. Saith Clearchus; If we remoue, Warre; if wee stay, Truce. And so would not disclose his purpose.
            
               
19. Clodius was acquit by a corrupt Iurie, that had palpably taken shares of money. Before they gaue vp their verdict, they prayed of the Senate a Guard, that they might doe their Consciences freely; for Clodius was a verie seditious young Noble-man. Whereupon, all the world gaue him for condemn'd.

But acquitted he was. Catulus the next day, seeing some of them, tha

                Euidence vpon oath

And the Iurie (which consisted of 57.) passed against his Euidence. One day in the Senate, Cicero and Clodius being in altercation, Clodius vpbraided him, and said; The Iurie gaue you no credit. Cicero answered; Fiue and twentie gaue mee credit; but there were two and thirtie, that gaue you no credit, for
               
               they had their money aforehand.
            
            21. Many men, especially such as affect grauitie, haue a manner, after other mens speech, to shake their heads. Sir Lionell Cranfield would say; That it was, as Men shake a Bottle, to see if there were any wit in their Head, or no.

24. Diogenes hauing seene that the Kingdome of Macedon, which before was contemptible &amp; low, began to come aloft, when hee died, was asked; How he would be buried? He answered; With my face downeward; for within a while, the world will bee turned vpside downe, and then I shall lie right.

            26. Themistocles, in his lower Fortune, was in loue with a young Gentle-man, who scorn'd him. When hee grew to his Greatnesse, which was soone after, hee

sought to him: But Themistocles said; Wee are both growne wise, but too late.
            
            27. Demonax the Philosopher, when hee died, was asked touching his buriall. He answered, Neuer take care for burying mee, for stinke will burie me. He that askt him, said againe; Why, would you haue your
               
               bodie left to Dogs and Rauens to feed vpon? Demonax answered; Why, what great hurt is it, if hauing sought to doe good, when I liued, to Men; my bodie doe some good to beasts, when I am dead?
            
            28. Iack Roberts was desired by his Taylour, when the reckoning grew somewhat high, to haue a Bill of
