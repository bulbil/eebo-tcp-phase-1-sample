            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

               A GOOD AND neceſſary Booke for curing diſeaſes, and hurtes in Horſes: gathered and written for the good of any that will practiſe, there being nothing contained therein, but what is of my owne experience and practice, and whereof I have had good proffe.
               
                  And firſt for diſeaſes in the head of a Horſe.
                  HEADACHE, which ſometime commeth of collerick humours bred in the braine, or of ſome extreme heate, or by ſome ſtroke, or ſuch like,

the ſigne of all ſuch infirmities. The Horſe will bee heavie, hang downe his head, and his eyes will be ſwolne dim and wateriſh.
               
               
                  Remedies for the ſame.
                  Squiſe the iuyce of ground-Ivie into his noſe thriles it is good, or burn the blades of Garlick and Frankenſence in a Chafindiſh, and hold the horſe noſe over it that the ſmoke may goe into the ſame, this will purge his head marveilouſly, and doe this ſo often as yee ſhall thinke needfull, or let him blood in the pallate of his mouth if the ſigne be not there, or neeſing powder and pepper brayed together and blowne into his noſe with a quill is alſo very good.
                  
                     
                     For watering of a Horſes eyes,
                  
                  Which may come to a young Horſe by eating over-dry and hard meats.
               
               
                  The remedies.
                  Let him blood on his temple vaine, or on the vaine under his eye, or on the necke which aſwageth the humours of the whole body, and if it have continued long, then waſh it with the iuyce of planteine, but if it come of a ſtroke, then make a cake or a ball of pimpernell and ſwines dung, dry it in an oven

                  For the Lampas.
                  Sometimes I uſe to draw out the Lampas with a crochet or crooked Iron made red hot that it doth not bleed after, and then with a lance
                        •
                      lets it bleed, and to heale the ſore againe take a little honie, a little peper, temper them with a quantitie of vinegar, boyle them together a little ſpace on the fire, and therewith annoint the ſore three or four dayes together, or to let him blood

with a fleame or a knifes point on both ſides of his mouth, but beware leſt yee cut the veine which comes right downe the pallate of his mouth, for ſo hee may bleed to death, and if ye feare he ſhall bleed too much, give him a little malte to eate very ſmall ground.
               
               
                  There is a malady in a Horſe mouth that will hinder him to eate his meate.
                  There bee little ſmall or round ſwellings in the mouth and lips of a horſe, which will make him let his meate fall out of his mouth as though hee had the Lampas, clip them away with a paire of Ciſſers, and rub the places with a little ſalt.
               
               
                  
                  A malady in a Horſe belly much like the botts, I call it Tronches, ye may know the evill by theſe tokens, he will ye downe often, and offer to welter or tumble, hee will offer to gnaw and bite at his ſides; he will ſtrike ahis belly with his hinder feete, and his ſides will flacke and beate ſore, and in a ſhort time it will pierce thorow his maw, then hee ſhall bee in great danger to die, but to helpe him at the firſt.
                  Take out the guts of a young Pullet, make your horſe head bee holden up and put them into his throte while they bee warme, and make him ſwallow them downe; doe thus three mornings together,

and let him neither eate nor drinke after for the ſpace of foure or five houres.
                  Or take a peck of Rie, ſteepe it in water a day and a night, then take it forth and lay it on a dry earthen floore as much as yee can from the winde, and let it come or burgion there as malt, then dry it in an oven or on a Kilne, and when it is dry give thereof to your horſe two handfulls for his firſt meale in a morning and thus doe five or ſixe mornings one after another.
               
               
                  Helpes for the ſinewes if they bee either pricked or cut aſunder.
                  If a ſinew be pricked, take theſe hot things, meat, oyle, ſwines grace, honie, of each alike, putting thereto

powder of Vares, make a plaiſter of all together, and lay it to the ſinew, dreſſe it ſo every day till it be whole, and if the fleſh be pierſed or cut, th
                        ••
                      boyle beane meale and barly me
                        ••
                     e in wine, with a quantity of honie, till it be plaiſter thick and lay that on the ſore.
               
               
                  Another yet for the ſame, which takes away all aking of ſinewes bruſed or pricked.
                  Take crops of walwort mallow leaves, of each two handfull, of lily roots a handfull, ſtampe them well altogether, and boyle them on the fire in a quantity of hony till they bee thick like a plaiſter, and lay to the ſore twice on the day reaſonable hot. But if a ſinew be cut overtwart,

ſo as it is not likely to grow together againe, then take groundwormes, the greater the better, ſtamp them with a little hony, then warme it a little in a pan, and with a cloth bind it to the cutting every day, or every ſecond day once, till it be whole, and let not the ſinews that are pricked or cut, be wet with any thing but the medicines, if yee can avoid it.
               
               
                  Of the enchafing of a Horſe neck, or other place of him, which may come by heat of blood after great travell, which by rubbing againſt a wall, or a tree will cauſe ſcabs riſe in his neck, among the haire, ſometime on the ſaddle place, to helpe this.
                  Take unquenched Lime a quantity,

ſuch like of beanes aſhes, or of beane ſtraw, then take old piſſe, ſet it on the fire till it boyle, and skime it cleane, and while it is hot, put into it your lime and aſhes, mingle them well together, let them ſtand ſo, till the next day, then take the cleare into another veſſell, and every day once, waſh the malady with a quantity thereof made hot.
               
               
                  When an horſe halteth to know whether the harme be in the ſhoulder, knee, or in his foot, and to helpe him.
                  If the harme bee in his foot, hee will forbeare to tread ſtraight, but even upon the point of his foot, and he will beare it farre from him, and make ſemblance as though hee

would fall often, he will make like ſignes, and if the grievance be either in his knee or ſhoulder, then 'its doubtfull to be incurable, unleſſe it come by a ſtroke or a fall, yee may uſe ſoftning oyntments, but they will doe no great good. Some will feare them where they thinke the diſeaſe to be, which is contrary to nature, for that the diſeaſe commeth of drineſſe: But if it happen in the ſhoulder by reaſon of ſome ſtroke or fall, or bruiſing otherwiſe: then make a bathe for it on this manner following: Take of Ribwort, ſome call it ribgraſſe, 5. or 6. handfull, of Bay-leaves, Peny-riall, Hyſope, Crowfoot, Oke-leaves, and red Fenel, of every one a handful, boile all

theſe hearbs in faire water a good ſpace, and twice in a day waſh the malady with a pint of this water made hot for the ſpace of five or ſix dayes together, and afterward anoint and rub well into it this ſubſequent unction, which is made in manner as here is ſet downe, ten handfull of the leaves of Pelitory, Bay-leaves, and oke-leaves, of either five handfull, of Sage-leaves foure handfull, ſtamp all theſe hearbs very ſmall, boile them then a good ſpace, and with a ſoft fire, in a gallon of butter, and a quart of neat-oyle: then ſtraine all thorow a canvas bag or cloth, and keepe it then as ye can conveniently, either in a box, or whatſoever, and if ye have of

this oyntment in ſtore, yee need never to uſe Oyle de bay, Nerve-oyle, nor any other that can bee named. And if a horſe foot bee hurt with a ſtub, or pricked with a naile in ſhooing, then ſearch it well with thy inſtrument for that purpoſe, then put a little tallow, or rather Turpentine in the hole, cover it with his owne dung, and ſet on a ſhoo, but ſo as ye may take it off againe at your pleaſure, to dreſſe the foot as need ſhall require.
                  And if a horſe halt through tenderneſſe of his hoofe, or breaking away thereof, thus hee may be holpen, and his hoofe made to grow againe. Take 2. ounces of Roſon, as much of ſheepes tallow, halfe an

ounce of frankenſence, and halfe an ounce of virgin wax, halfe an ounce of ſwines greace, or more or leſſe of every one as yee ſhall thinke good, melt them altogether and keepe it for thine uſe, and when thou ſhalt uſe any thereof heat it, or turpentine and ſwines greace boild together is very good for this purpoſe, the ſalve muſt bee rubbed on his foot under and above, eſpecially at the top of his hoofe under the haire theſe are excellent remedies for this matter.
               
               
                  For Windgales.
                  Every man knowes of what faſhion they bee, and they are commonly on good horſes leggs, rather than on bad ones, and worſe to

ſight then otherwiſe: but to cure them yee ſhall take a quantitie of vinegar, a pottle, or as you pleaſe, if ſo much, then muſt ye have thereto two pound of armement, halfe a pound of galles, and halfe a pound of moleine leaves, ſtampe them, or bray them ſmall, and temper them altogether with the vineger, put all in an earthen pot, ſtop it well and cloſe, and with the ſame liquor waſh the windgales every day five or ſix times, for the ſpace of three or foure daies together; that done, lap his legge above and beneath the gales, then chafe or rub them with your hand, which will make them riſe full, that yee may ſee them the better, then ſtrike your fleame into

them as deep as ye dare for piercing the ſinewes, thruſt the matter well out of them with your finger, and have ready a hot Iron blunt at the point, and therwith ſeare the holes which yee make, and every day after waſh them with the liquor aforeſaid, and it will ſoon be whole.
               
               
                  For the Stranglion:
                  Take the barke of an Elme tree which growes upon ſome water banke, if you can get ſuch, take away the outſide thereof as Tanners clenſe their barke, chop it into ſmal pieces, put it then into an earthen pot with well-water, let it ſtand ſo 2. or 3. daies, in which time much of the water will be ſunke into the barke, fill up the pot then again with

water, there will be two parts of barke, and the third part water, or rather 3. parts barke and the fourth water: boile theſe well together the ſpace of halfe an houre, which done ſet it from the fire and let it coole, then ſtraine it thorow a cloth and looke how much liquor remaines, put thereto ſo much of ſwines greace, heat them then a little on the fire that they may be well blended, and every day powre a gille of this ſame into his noſe-thriles till a gallon of liquor be ſpent, when yee doe it cauſe your horſe head to bee holden up, or take 8. or 10 handfuls of walwort, ſtamp it very ſmal, then menge it with butter cleane clarified, you muſt have a pottle of butter,

put all in a veſſell or pot, and let it ſtand ſo the ſpace of 6 or 7. dayes, then ſet it on a ſofte fier and boile it, putting therein a pint or a quart of wine, and let it boyle the ſpace of a quarter of an hower, then ſtreeme it through a canvas bagg or cloath, and every day put ſome of this licour into his noſe-thriles till all be ſpent. Or make 10. or 12. balles of May butter and Radiſh rootes well ſtamped together, and make him ſwallow 2 or three of thoſe balles every day, and if ye wet them a little in honie they ſhall be the better, cauſe his head to be holden or tied up, that they may goe downe his throate.
               
               
                  
                  Coſtifenes how it may be engendred and to helpe its.
