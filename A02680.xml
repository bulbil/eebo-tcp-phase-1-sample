            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

            To the Reader.
            S. Paul tells us of ſome kinde of men, that they profite, but ſtill to the worſe, 2. Tim. 3. It is not long ſince that there was a Booke ſet forth, admoniſhing the Friars to be ſober, but they have burnt ſo many of thoſe Bookes, and read ſo few of them, as from folly they have profited to extreame madneſſe. It was little ſobriety to excommunicate one man, for the fault, or no fault of another. But howſoever clave errante, vel non errante, the Cenſures are Epiſcopall. But for a Prelat to throw away his Keyes, &amp; to take the Sword, &amp; to hang it at a Friars belt, &amp; with it to play the Fencer, yea the Offender.
            Spectatum admiſsi riſum teneatis amici?
            The Italian ſayes, That before a man falls into any great calamity, God firſt gives him a rappe upon the pate, that is, hee deprives him of his judgment, well expreſſed by the Poet, De Ponto lib. 4.
            
               Crede mihi, miſeros prudentia prima relinquit,
               Et ſenſus cunre, conſiliumque fugit
            
            A wretched man, right, reaſon firſt forſakes,
            He reckes not of advice, nor counſell takes.
            The Friars began with Excom. they arrived at Exile. What's the next? Aſsiſes and Quarter-Seſſions.
               The Prophet ſayth, De radice colubri egredietur Regulus, Eſay 14. from the root of an Adder ſhall iſſue out a Cockatrice. By which is ſignified (as Lyra expounds it) That from a ſmall beginning, &amp; contemptible, great and intollerable miſchiefes doe ariſe. But the Adder of Exile being prudently oppreſſed, the hatch of the Cockatrice was prevented.
            Is it not to be lamented, that the Eccleſiaſticall &amp; Politique eſtate cannot conſiſt together, but that the advancement of the one, muſt bee the abatement of the other? In ſo much that ſome doubt not to ſay, that a Catholi

               MOſt illuſtrious and reverent Lord, as brother. Heere it is written unto the Biſhop of Meath, That hee command that ſame Paul Harris to depart forthwith from your Dioceſſe, otherwiſe to give order byauthority of the ſame holy Congregation, to the faithfull people, that none ſhall receive from him the holy Sacraments,
nor heare his Maſſe. And that ſome ſcandall ariſe not by meanes of this order, Your Lordſhip may give unto the ſaid Biſhop (when hee receiveth this incloſed) ſuch advertiſements and informations as you ſhall thinke fitting for prevention thereof. To conclude, I commend my ſelfe unto your Lordſhip.

               MOſt illuſtrious and Rev. Lo: as brother vid. Thomas Flemming alias Barnwell, to whom this Epiſtle was directed, as himſelfe publiſheth. Heere it is written to the Biſhop of Meath ſubandi incloſed within this Letter. The name of the B. of Meath is, Tho. Deſe Do. of Sorbon in Paris.
               
               That hee commaund that ſame Paul Harris viz. mentioned in the incloſed Letter unto the B. of Meath, not yet publiſhed.
               To depart forthwith your Dioceſſe
               To wit, the Dioceſſe of Dublin.
               
            
         
      
      
         
            
            CAP. I.
            
               NOW this ſame Paul Harris is doubtleſſe the Engliſh Prieſt, who lives in Dublin, who wrote a Booke in anſwer to Tho. Flemming his Excom. as alſo a ſecond called Arctomaſtix, againſt a libelling Friar, who ſhadoweth himſelfe under the name of Vrſulanus; and ſince that, a third Booke againſt the falſe doctrine of Habits and Scapulars, and Donna Luiſſa her Saturdayes Faſt. So then it ſeemes this ſame Paul Harris the Engliſh Prieſt, is to be commanded by the Biſhop of Meath Do. Deſe, authorized by the Congregation of Cardinalls De propagandâ fide, to depart the Dioceſſe of Dublin. Certs if the Biſhop of Meath his Warrant come in the Name of King CHARLES, it will doubtleſſe bee obeyed; but if it come in any other mans name, Paul Harris (as farre as I underſtand his minde) is reſolved not to depart. Nay, if all the Friars, Prieſts, Biſhops, Cardinalls, Popes, and a generall Councell, ſhall command him to depart, he will not remove a foot out of the Dioceſſe of Dublin. The reaſons of this his reſolution he hath abundantly yeelded, and publiſhed unto the world, in an Anſwer unto the Archbiſhops Excom. cap. 3. Yea, but it is ſaid in the text of this Letter, That the Biſhop of Meath is to command him Forthwith to depart. Alas good Friars, give him leave to pay his way, and bid his friends farewell. Forthwith is very ſudden. Let him at leaſt depart with bag &amp; baggage,
as Souldiours doe from the Fort they can no longer defend. Happily Paul Harris cannot ſay as old Bias did, Omniamea mecumporto. The Friars ſay, hee is rich: Will they not allow him time to tranſport his wealth to the place of his future reſidence, to make ſale of his houſes, and lands, and to recover the arreeres of his rents, to call in his debts, to make an end of his ſuites in law, &amp;c. All which require time, and cannot be diſpatched Forthwith. Patrick Cahil being baniſhed the ſame Dioceſſe by the preſent Archb. was allowed 15. dayes of abode before he removed. O but he was a native, and Harris is an Engliſh churle, and muſt not be ſo kindly dealt withall. Forthwith: This is like the Summons of Gads hill, or Salesbury plaine, Stand &amp; deliver. Well, perambulet mare &amp; aridam, quaerens quid devoret. Let the Friar compaſſe ſea and land, ſeeking what he may devoure, yet old Paul is reſolved to live among his old neighbours of Dublin, notwithſtanding the Friars ſhould determine the contrary in a generall Chapter.
            By this then gentle Reader, you ſee (at leaſt if this Letter came from Rome, as our Archb. pretends, and would have it to be beleeved) That the ſword of exile is taken out of his fiſt, and put into the Lord Biſh. of Meath his hands; who for all the perſwaſions that our Biſh. Flemming can uſe (ſee the luck of it) abſolutely denyes to draw out the ſame; In plaine termes that he never intends to pronounce any ſentence of exile againſt Harris, and ſo hath declared himſelfe to the face of our Archb, and his Friars, and to as many as deale with him about it. But how will the Biſh. of Meath anſwer this neglect, or rather contempt of the

               Romane command? O! let it alone: He knowes how to give ſatiſfaction unto the holy Congregation of Cardinalls De propagandâ fide, or to any other miſ-informed, and abuſed ſuperiour. And now it pittyes me to ſee, (and yet I cannot but laugh) how our Archb. Plemming, and his Friars, torment themſelves in this buſineſſe. For now that they cannot induce the B. of Meath by no perſwaſion to this horride fact, viz. to ſentence a Prieſt to exile, yet never called to his anſwer, and much leſſe convicted of any fault, and conſequently innocent, (for ſo the Law preſumes Reg. 8) They now cry out; O frustra noſtri ſuſcepti labores! O malè impenſi ſumptus! O all our labour in vaine undertaken! O coſts caſt away! Albeit in truth, all their labours, coſts and charges, were no more then the addreſſing of one Letter unto Friar Wadding, a man according unto their owne heart, reſident continually in the Citty, and preſt to negotiate all their cauſes, a man of that zeale &amp; earneſtneſſe in procuration, as he would well weene to obtaine a ſentence before a citation, a condemnation before a conviction.
            Cordiger eſuriens in coelum juſſeris ibit.
            I tell you perdy: A hungry Friar, hungry of maintenance, hungry of honour, hungry of vanity and vainglory, &amp; to conſerve his declining reputation among his fellowes, what will he not doe? Ad ſtygias ſi juſſeris ibit.
            
            So then our Archb. and his Friars, ſeeing all their proceedings againſt Paul Harris, come to no better a paſſe in the Roman Court. The Archb. diſarmed as a party, &amp; therefore partiall. The Biſhop of Meath onely authorized to pronounce ſentence, and refuſing
that ſervice. I ſay, all deſignments &amp; machinations ſo untowardly ſucceeding on our Archb. ſide. At laſt, as deſperat of all better ſucceſſe, he betakes himſelfe to this ſilly refuge, forſooth to publiſh a privat Letter received frō a Card. the Popes Nephew, which Letter is nothing elſe in the world, but the caſe or cover of the Letter ſent unto the B. of Meath: As if one bereft of his ſword, ſhould lay about him with the ſcabberd. For it plainely appeares, that the B. of Meâth hath the ſword, and our B. nothing left him but the ſcabberd, with which he maketh this goodly flouriſh, ſending abroad the coppyes thereof like ſo many butter-flyes among his followers and devoto's, preſuming (as he well may) of the many-headed multitude, in all communityes as moſt injudicious, ſo with all moſt factious, being as ready as the blind Senator in Iuvenal, Sat. 4. to applaud what they heare others to cōdemne: adding of his own invention, as likewiſe his Friars in their perambulations, that the ſentence of Harris his exile, awarded by the Ordinary, is now ratified &amp; confirmed by the Popes ſentence, which is as farre from truth, as Rome is from Dublin Nothing ſent frō his Hol. in theſe parts inſinuating the ſame. And that now Harris (ſayth the Archb.) may turne the edge of his ſtile from me, upon the Cardinalls, who have confirmed my ſentence: And this he may doe with ſmal labour: for it is no more but to change the Title of his Booke frō me to them. So Tho. Flemming. Al which (with due reſpect unto your place my Lord) are manifeſt untruths, and ſo convicted to bee by the tenure of this very Epiſtle of the Card. publiſhed by your command into ſo many hands. For if
that ſentence be put into the power of the B. of Meath to be pronounced de futuro, without relation to your ſentence at all. How then is your ſentence confirmed of which no mention is made? A ſentence of which it ſeemed your ſelfe being aſhamed, before a grave audience, did in expreſſe termes before many witneſſes, diſclay me and deny ever to have given.
            For you may remember my Lo. Archb. that being called before the Lo. Biſhop of Derry, and Sir George Radcliffe Knight, there being then preſent Do. Peter Caddell, Do. Patrick Cahil, William Brown, Patrick Brangan, Edmund Doyle Prieſts, that you acknowledging and avowing your command of Peter Caddell out of your Dioceſſe, you conſtantly denyed the exile of Paul Harris, but onely that you willed and adviſed him to depart, by reaſon of which your deniall, hee was forced to produce his witneſſe William Browne Prieſt, who before thoſe two honorable perſons, being charged by them upon his conſcience, as an honeſt man to ſpeake the truth, whether you onely deſired or commanded him to quitt your Dioceſſe; the ſaid William Browne did teſtifie, that you abſolutely commanded Paul Harris to depart, and to leave your Dioceſſe, and that himſelfe was the man who was alſo commanded to deliver that meſſage unto him in your name. All thoſe before named can witneſſe that buſineſſe ſo to have paſſed. And therefore I ſay, had your exile of Paul Harris been moſt legall, (which I will never grant) by your voluntary deniall thereof it was revoked, and utterly quaſhed, no leſſe then a ſentence of Excommunication, Suſpenſion, &amp;c. by the like deny all remaines cancelled and revoked. How
then now confirmed? It followeth.
            Otherwiſe to give order by authority of the ſame holy congregatiō, to the faithfull people, that none ſhall receive from him the holy Sacraments, nor heare his Maſſe.
            The order which Tho. Flemming gave foure yeeres agoe, was; That none under paine of Excom. ſhould be preſent at his Maſſe. The nullity of which Excom. being declared by an Anſwer thereunto, it was the leſſe obſerved, eſpecially of ſuch as were of Iudgment. What order the B. of Meath was to lay down, appeareth not, for that the Serpent was cruſhed in the Egg.
            This ſacred Congregation of Card. De propagandâ fide, was inſtituted about the yeare 1612. by Paulus 5. of which Congregation at this time, Card. Antonio Barbarini, the youngeſt of the three nephewes of this preſent Pope Vrbanus 8. is head, or Praefect, a man about 30. wiſe, but not much learned. And it is ſtrange that being wiſe, and an Italian (a Natiō ſo reſpective) writing to forraigne countreyes, he would not command his Secretary, to ſtile his Epiſtles in Latin, unleſſe (peradventure) Latine is become a ſtranger among the Latine Secretaryes. Wee Tramontani (as the Italians call us) directing our Letters unto the Court of Rome, neither write them in Engliſh, or Iriſh, albeit we are not ignorant, that there wants not of theſe Countreyes in the Citty, who are able to tranſlate them into Italian. This Congregation of Cardinalls (I confeſſe) have a glorious ſtile conferred upon them by his Hol. as to be Propagators, advancers
&amp; promoters of the Faith, but ſurely their endeavors will never anſwere unto thoſe honorable titles, ſo long as (giving eare to a company of turbulent &amp; malecontent Friars) they ſhall ſeeke to diſturb the peace &amp; tranquillity of thoſe Kingdomes, over or in which they have no principality. I ſay, by exerciſing a ſecular power over thoſe who are none of their ſubiects. For as his Majeſty of Great Brittaine, never attempted to exile any of the Popes ſubjects out of Rome, or any other his Territoryes; ſo neither ought they to baniſh any of his Majeſties liege people, either out of this, or that City, Province, or Dioceſſe, but to know their owne bounds, and not to tranſgreſſe the ſame. And truly were I either wiſe or learned, I would endeavour to perſwade thoſe moſt eminent L. Cardinalls (in acknowledgment of their error) either to ſend an Embafſadour unto his Majeſty, or at leaſt to direct a deprecatory Epiſtle unto him, by which he might be induced to paſſe over that injurious entrenchment upon his Crowne &amp; Dignity. And alas what leſſe can they doe? This truly would be a cōmendable act, beſeeming their greatneſſe, and anſwerable unto their high titles; by this meanes, the Faith might either be propagated, or certs leſſe ſcandalized. And it may be hoped, that in ſo generous a breſt of our renowned Soveraigne, it would find both a gentle admittance and remittance.
            And as for the faithfull people here mentioned: Surely as many as be of underſtāding &amp; capacity (who I cō
               feſſe, are not the greateſt part of your flock) doe well ſee &amp; diſcerne, that all theſe machinations of the Friars againſt Harris, proceed meerely from malice, who for his deſire &amp; zeale of their reformation, as well in their corrupt
manners in life, as abhominable errors in doctrine, doe labour by all meanes to ruinate &amp; undoe him. But P.H. is confident, that Qui habitat in adjutorio altiſsimi, in protectione Dei coeli commor abitur: Hee that dwells in the helpe of the higheſt, ſhall remaine in the protection of the God of Heaven. Neither is he better then his predeceſſors, ſo many worthy Prelats and Prieſts, who for ſeeking to reforme abuſes among Monkes &amp; Friars, have ſuffered at their hands extreame perſecutiō, not alwayes ad exiliū, but ſometimes ad ſanguinē. Examples whereof both ancient and moderne, our Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtoryes doe recount. And it is no ſmal comfort unto P.H. and an affront to his adverſaryes, that his bookes being by the Friars preſented unto the Roman Cenſors, and by them read &amp; peruſed, tryed, ſifted &amp; bolted, yet came off as Gold from the fire, without the leaſt note, obeliske, or aſteris ke of reproofe, which is alſo no ſmall honour unto our holy Faith, becauſe hereby thoſe who are otherwiſe perſwaded in matters of doctrine, may plainely ſee that the Catholique Church maintaines none of thoſe fooleryes, which the Friars profructu ventris doe daylie vent, and were largely confuted in his aforeſaid Booke. It followeth in the Epiſtle.
            And that ſome ſcandall ariſe not by meanes of this order, your Lordſhip may give unto the ſaid Biſhop, when he receiveth this encloſed, ſuch advertiſements &amp; informations, as you ſhall thinke fitting for prevention thereof.]
            But no advertiſements, or informations, that Dublinenſis could give, ſeemed ſufficiēt to Medenſis to the prevention of ſcandall, maturely conſidering, that it was a thing impoſſible, without notorious ſcandall, indictâ cauſâ
               to baniſh a Prieſt out of the Dioceſſe wherein hee hath his habitation, his friends, acquaintance, and benefactors, and that in a continued reſidence of more then 20. yeeres, and to be ſent into Pontus, I mean, to uncouth &amp; unknowne places, where being ſeparated from his friends &amp; wel-willers, he may with leſſe difficulty have his throat cut by a malicious Friar, or ſome ſuborned Wood-kerne. O! but Harris might paſſe into his native Countrey of England. True indeed, and ſo he may (but not for ſic volo, ſic jubeo of a Prelate) though as yet he is not ſo minded: theſe 20. yeeres of a continued abſence, having made him well-neere as much a ſtranger in his owne Countrey, as in the County of Tirconnell, where as yet he never ſet foot. Such are the fruites of time, whoſe nature is as the Poet Menander ſaith, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , to procure oblivion. No no, with the good leave of the State, P. H. now of the age of 63. hath ſet up his reſt, and is reſolved to ſay of Ireland, and in particular of this Dioceſſe of Dublin, Hic habitabo, quoniam elegi eam: Heere will I dwell, for that I have made choyſe thereof, till ſuch time as his better part bee tranſlated into a better habitation.
            Againe, the Lo. Biſhop of Meath no doubt doth well conſider, that a baniſhment inflicted without an examination of the cauſe, without the bill of the Plaintiff, and anſwer of the Defendant, can not but be moſt injurious, &amp; illegall, and ſo by the ſame non-ſenſe of a nolo, that a party is removed from this Dioceſſe of Dublin, he may alſo be excluded from any other Dioceſſe, and ſo conſequently out of all Chriſtendome, for that there is no place in any Countrey of the Chriſtian world, but is contained in ſome Dioceſſe, and ſo perforce muſt bee
cōpelled to live either vpon the Seas, or among Turkes and Infidells.
            Laſtly, the Lo. B of Meath had good cauſe to refuſe to be imployed in ſuch a piece of ſervice, viz. to pronounce ſentence of exile againſt any of the Kings Subjects, for hee being a Do. of that famous Vniverſity of Sorbon, &amp; as by profeſſion a Divine, ſo alſo ſeene in the Canons &amp; Lawes of holy Church, doth well underſtand, that Exile is a puniſhment beyond the ſpheare of Epiſcopall juriſdiction, proper to the Crowne, and not to the Miter, and accordingly to be managed by the Secular, and not by the Spiritual arme. So S. Bernard in his 5. booke De conſideratione, unto Pope Eugenius, tells us; That as the Keyes belong unto the Prelats, ſo the Sword unto the Civill Magiſtrate. Forſitan tuo nutu, non tua manu evaginandus: Peradventure by your will (ſayth he) not by your hand to be unſheathed. Which doctrine is layde downe, and canonized in the Decretals of Gregory lib. 5. de Cler. excom. tit. 27. cap. 2. Si quis presbyter, aut alius clericus fuerit degradatus, aut ab officio pro certis criminibus ſuſpenſus, &amp; ipſe per contemptum &amp; ſuperbiam aliquid de miniſterio ſibi interdicto agere praeſumpſerit, &amp; poſtea ab Epiſcopo ſuo correptus in incepta praeſumptione perduraverit modis omnibus excommunicetur, &amp; quicunque-cum co communicaverit, ſimiliter ſe ſciat eſſe excommunicatum. Similiter de Clericis, Laicis, vel foeminis excommunicatis obſervandumeſt. Quod ſi aliquis omnia iſta contempſerit, &amp; Epiſcopus minimè emendare potuerit regis judicio ad requiſitionem Eccleſiae exilio damnetur: If a Prieſt or a Clergy-man ſhal be degraded, or for certaine crimes ſuſpended from his office, and thorough contempt &amp; pride, ſhall preſume to doe any thing in his miniſtery forbidden unto him, and
after being by his Biſhop reproved, ſhall notwithſtanding perſevere in his former preſumption, by all meanes let him be excommunicated, and he who ſhall communicate with him, let him know that he is excommunicated. And this to be obſerved with Clerkes, Laicks, &amp; and women excommunicated. But if any ſhall contemne all theſe things, and that the Biſhop can put no remedy unto it, then by the judgment of the King, at the requeſt of the Church, let him be baniſhed.
            In which Canon is plainly diſtinguiſhed the office of the Biſhop, &amp; of the King. The ſpirituall cenſures of Excom. Suſpenſion &amp;c. to be inflicted by the Biſhop, &amp; not by the King. The temporall puniſhment of exile &amp;c. to be commanded by the King, and not by the Biſhop. Againe, in this Canon may be obſerved the order &amp; method of a legall proceſſe; as firſt, conviction of crimes, or contumacy, including in his nature &amp; eſſence, a citation of the party accuſed; next, infliction of ſpirituall cenſures by ſentence of the Biſhop, as Excom. Suſpenſion &amp;c, which being cōtemned, &amp; the delinquent incorrigible. What then is to bee done? Mary the Biſhops power being exhauſted, in the laſt place comes in the ſword, to wit, corporall puniſhment of Exile, to bee adjudged by the King, at the inſtance of the Church. By which it is manifeſt, that Exile is a puniſhment tranſcending all ſpirituall power &amp; Epiſcopall juriſdiction. For elſe ſhould the Law have ſaid: Then by the judgment of the Biſhop, let him be baniſhed; but here it is ſaid in terminis, in expreſſe termes, by the judgment of the King let him be baniſhed.
            Like unto this is that other Canon de judiciis, lib. 2. tis. 1. cap. 10. In theſe words. Si Clericus in quocunque ordine conſtitutus,
in furto, vel homicidio, vel perjurio, ſeu alio crimine fuerit deprehenſus legitimè, atque convictus, ab Eccleſiaſtice judice deponendus est. Qui ſi depoſitus incorrigibilis fucrit, excommunicari debet, deinde cotumaciâ creſcente anathematis mucrone feriri, poſt modum vero, ſi in profundum malorum veniens contempſerit, cùm Eccleſia non habet ultra quod faciat, 
                     •
                  e poſsit eſse ultra perditio plurimorum, per ſecularem comprimendus est poteſtatem. Ita quod ei deputetur exilium, vel alia legitima poena inferatur. That is, If a Clergy man in what order ſoever, ſhalbe found in theft, or man-ſlaughter, or perjury, or other crime, and being lawfully convicted by the Eccleſiaſticall Iudge, he is to be depoſed; who, if after depoſition he ſhalbe incorrigible, he ought to be excommunicated, afterward his contumacy encreaſing, to be ſtroken with the ſword of Anathema: but if arriving at the depth of all evills, he ſhall remaine in contumacy, whenas the Church hath not further what to doe (that there be not beſides the deſtruction of very many) he is to be repreſſed by the Secular power. So as Exile may be deputed unto him, or ſome other lawfull puniſhment inflicted. So the Canon.
            In which we ſee, as in the former, that the power of the Church &amp; of the Prelat, proceedes no further, even with the greateſt delinquents, but to excommunication &amp; to Anathema, at which once arriving, they make a period, confeſſing (as we ſee in this Canon) that the Church can paſſe no further, but leaves Exile, &amp; all other corporall puniſhments, to the Secular power to be awarded &amp; inflicted. What then may we thinke of that Prelat, who not content with his ſpirituall ſword of Eccleſiaſticall cenſures, will with his owne hand unſheath the temporall ſword of the Civill Magiſtrate? which
S. Bernard conformable unto the doctrin of the Church, lay de downe in theſe two Canons above cited, flatly denyeth not onely to Biſhops, but to the Pope himſelf, Non tuâ manuevaginundus: Not by thy hand (O Pope Eugenius) to be unſheathed. Yet hath our Archb. contrary unto the Lawes of holy Church, &amp; the practiſe of all times, unſheathed the ſword of his Soveraigne and Liege Lord, once by his owne confeſſion, &amp; twice more by conviction of witneſſes, before honorable Perſonages, by exiling out of his Dioceſſe, three Prieſts, albeit (I confeſſe) with very bad ſucceſſe, their diſobedience to unlawfull commands, being ſo juſtifiable as we have ſeene.
            I doe not marvaile then, though the B. of Meath like a good ſubject, did refuſe to meddle in a buſines of that nature, not having the conſent and approbation of the State. All temporall juriſdiction in inflicting corporall puniſhments, from the leaſt to the greateſt, being eſſentiall unto his Majeſties Crowne &amp; Dignity. And I can not but wonder, that the Archb. Flemming &amp; his Friars, ſhould perſwade themſelves, that albeit a Prince be of another opinion in ſome points of doctrine, from the Roman, which wee call the Catholique &amp; Apoſtolicall Church, that therefore he is a leſſe abſolute and Soveraigne Commander within his Realmes &amp; Dominions, over which Almighty GOD hath placed him, then any other the moſt Catholique Prince in the World: which is a doctrine ſo undoubted, as it is defined by the Church, as a matter of divine faith, which whoſe denyeth, Coneil. Conſtant. is to be ranked among heretiques. How then ſay I, comes it to paſſe? that, what no Prelate under any Prince in Chriſtendome at this day would doe or
with the integrity of his faith to GOD, or allegiance to his Prince could doe. What no Prelates for theſe thouſand yeeres &amp; upward, under any King of England (ſince our firſt converſion from Paganiſme, unto Chriſtianity, under Pope Gregory the great) did, or durſt doe. That this preſent 
                  •
               rchb. Tho. Flemming, now in theſe dayes, dare ſo boldly attempt, namely; to exile &amp; eject the Kings Subjects, without invocating the Secular arme.
         
         
            CAP. II. An objection againſt ſome points of the former diſcourſe anſwered.
            
               IT will happily be alledged in defenee of the Biſhop by his Friars: That the times are ſuch, as they doe not permit that correſpondencie twixt the Prelats, and the Civill Magiſtrate in theſe Kingdomes, as in dayes of yore, and that therefore they can not expect that the Secular arme will condeſcend to execute any ſuch their deſignes or deſires. To which I anſwere. And is it then good Logicke, that the Biſhops may uſurpe their power, and entrench upon the right of the Secular arme? That becauſe the King will not ſtrike, that therefore the Biſhop may take the ſword out of his hand, and lay about him? Let me illuſtrate this by a familiar ſimilitude: There is a Friar in Paris, &amp; he wiſheth with all his heart, that the Archb. of that place would excommunicate one Titius an Adverſary of his, who lives in his Dioceſſe, and is one of his flock, but he dares not impart his mind unto him, for that he is perſwaded he will
never condeſcend thereunto, &amp; in moving him in that affayre, he ſhall but looſe his labour, and peradventure be repulſed with blame. Well, what then? what doth the Friar? Mary he ſayes, Courage m
                     ••
                  n Frers, and without any further delay, hee excommunicates the party himſelfe. I demaund in this caſe, Quid juris? It
                  •
                anſwered, that the Friar is mercifully dealt withall, 
                  〈◊〉
                he bee but ſet upon the Pillary, or upon an Aſſe, and whipt naked from the waſte upward thorough the ſtreetes of Paris. And why? becauſe he preſumes to execute that power which he never had.
            True it is, That conformable unto the Canons above alledged, as alſo the immemorable cuſtomes &amp; conſtitutions of theſe Kingdomes, in caſe of enormous crimes, as Theft, Murder, Perjury, Simony, Hereſie, &amp;c. as alſo diſobedience, proceeding to incorrigibility &amp;c. and that not onely in Clearkes, but in Laicks, unto their Eccleſiaſticall ſuperiours, as Biſhops, &amp; other Prelates, after ſpirituall remedies uſed, as admonitions, cenſures, depoſitions, degradations &amp;c. at the inſtance of the Church upon a ſiguificavis, there commonly iſſued out a Writ from the Kings high Court of Chancery, Decapiendo excommunicate. De comburen do baretico &amp;c. according to the quality of the delict. If then our Archbiſh. hath proceeded in this legall manner with his ſubject, &amp; is arrived at the uttermoſt extent of Epiſcopall juriſdiction. He may then require the aſſiſtance of the Secular arme, by intimating his Proceſſe into the Kings Court of Iuſtice, which if they anſwere his deſires, ſo it is; if not, he muſt reſt contented, and not thinke to erect a new Tribunall, and a new courſe of proceeding, contrary to what before, by authority of Church &amp; Common-wealth
is eſtabliſhed, and by cuſtome of ſo many ages, confirmed. To make him ſelfe both Prince, &amp; Prelate; both Biſhop, and Civill Magiſtrate, to plucke the Roſes from the Kings Crowne, and to place them in his owne Miter. For by ſo doing, he may draw the ſword of the Secular arme upon his owne neck, and in proſecuting others, make himſelfe an offendor in the higheſt degree.
            How often doe we finde in former ages? when both Prince and Prelate were of one lip and heart in divine worſhip, and acknowledged obedience unto the Pope in matters ſpirituall. Yet even in thoſe times, did not thoſe Catholique Princes alwayes anſwere the inſtance and requiſition of their Biſhops, in lending them the aſſiſtance of their ſword and ſecular arme, but ſometimes were ſlow and remiſſe in that kinde of correſpondency, yea ſometimes did abſolutely deny the ſame. As who ſo will peruſe the Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory of the Church, collected by that learned Card. Caeſar Baronius in his Annalls; Or our Countrey-man Nicholas Harpſfeild in his Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory of England, ſhall eaſily finde. And ſo often as this hapned, what did thoſe Prelats? forſooth contained themſelves within the bounds of their ſpirituall and Epiſcopall juviſdiction, never attempting to hang, burne, or baniſh, as our hor-ſpurre Frians have perſwaded our Archb. to the great ſcandall of Gods Church, and his owne utter ruine, if the King bee not the more mercifull unto him. Which matters well pondered by the B. of Meath, it is no wonder that hee told our Arch that they were none of his friends that procured him that Commiſſion from Rome, to pronoūce ſentence of exile againſt any of the Kings Liege people;
by which act, himſelfe might come to bee in the ſame predicament with Tho. Flemming Archb. not onely a bad member of Gods Church, but a diſloyall ſubject unto his Majeſty, verifying that of the Prophet, Pſal. 49. Cùm videbas furem, currebas cum to &amp;c.
            
         
         
            CAP. III. The informations, by which the Archb. &amp; his Friars procured from the Congregation of Cardinalls De propagandâ fide, the Commiſsion of Paul Harris his exile from the Dioceſſe of Dublin.
            
            
               POpes, and Princes, Cardinalls, &amp; Biſhops are men, and no Angells, &amp; according as they are informed, ſo they ſpeake, ſo they write, ſo they determine cauſes; ſo they abſolve, and ſo they doe condemne.
            I remember I have read in Philip Commines his hiſtory of the warres twixt the French King Lewis II. &amp; Charles Duke of Burgundy, that in ſome ſervices wherein the French had the worſe, &amp; routed (more upon a Pannick feare, then any juſt cauſe of terror) ſome Commanders being after by the King called to an accompt for their cowardiſe: The Author obſerves, &amp; ſo reports it: That certaine Captaines, and great Monſieurs, that ran from the field but ſix leagues off, were ſeverely puniſhed for their offences; and others who fled from the field, and ran ten leagues beyond them, were highly rewarded for their valour &amp; good ſervice. Noting (as I ſaid before) that Princes by reaſon of an impoſſibility of proper
knowledge in themſelves as touching the eſtate of abſent affayres, are forced (reſting upon informations) to judge accordingly, walking ſometimes upon the right hand, and other whiles upon the left.
            And ſo it hapned in the cafe of P. H. who by Friar Wadding, the Archb. his Agent in the Citty, and others of his fraternity, as well ſhodd, as bare-footed Friars, his mortall &amp; ſworne enemies, is accuſed to be a moſt turbulent; &amp; a ſeditious perſon, diſobedient to all lawfull authority, and as one confirmed in contumacy, remaines incorrigible, and ſo incurable, without hope of amendment &amp;c. And thus have the Friars chanted their Mattins at Rome.
            
            
               P. Harris the defendant of his innocencie, in the mean time lyes at anchor in the Port of Dublin, little knowing how the windes blow abroad, till upon theſe ſuggeſtions, there comes from the Citty, not a Commiſſion to any particular Biſhops, or other Prelats, to examine his cauſe, or to heare what the Archb. can alledge againſt him, or he make anſwer thereunto, but the percloſe of all judiciall proceedings, namely Sentence, and that is thought fit to bee of Exile out of the Dioceſſe wherein he lives, and that ſentence commanded unto the B. of Meath to pronounce.
            But now heare (good Reader) what Paul Harris ſaith unto this information. Albeit nothing more, or other can hee ſay, then what he hath delivered in his former Bookes. Even the ſame which all the Cleargy of Dublin doe know at this day to be true. That which ſo many of the Laity as take notice of our troubles, doe know to be true. That which the Friars themſelves, the onely cauſers &amp; procurers of all theſe inteſtine broyles twixt the
Cleargy and the Regulars, beſt of all know to bee true: Namely, that this information made by the Archb. and his Friars, unto the Cardinalls at Rome, is moſt falſe, moſt unconſcionable &amp; wicked, that it is a meere Chimera, &amp; an En
                     •
                  rationis, without any exiſtent foundation. And to the end that the world may againe &amp; againe underſtand in all places, that which in theſe parts is moſt palpable. I could wiſh, not the ſhell of a Triton, but the trumpet of an Arch-angell to ſound it thorough ſea &amp; land, that all the inhabitants of the Earth, and not onely of Rome, may heare it, and take knowledge of the injuſtice and falſhood of thoſe, who by their places &amp; office in Gods Church, ſhould be lights &amp; lanthornes unto others, to direct their paces into the wayes of juſtice, peace, and truth. For it is ſo farre from any ſhadow of verity; That Paul Harris hath beene diſobedient unto his Superiour the Archb. or that ever he denyed upon any ſummons, citation or meſſage, to appeare before him, or to anſwer any accuſatiō, or matter, litle or great, layde unto his charge, that in all his life he never received any meſſage or citation at all from his Ordinary which hee hath not obeyed. And this to bee true, the Archb. in his owne conſcience knowes, and none better then himſelfe underſtands the innocencie of P. H. in that behalfe. But in caſe it bee otherwiſe, ſince it is a matter of fact, why hath not the Archb. (in all this time ſince Harris wrote his two Bookes,) for his owne credit &amp; reputation, and to the greater affront of P. H. declared here at home unto ſome ſufficient &amp; underſtanding men either of the Cleargy, or Laity, the falſity of this his ſo bold aſſertion, naming the partyes by whom he ſent his citations, or his meſſages, to what place he called him
unto his anſwer? The time when, the day, the moneth, or the yeare, that ſo P. H. being challenged of ſo notorious an untruth in his writings, might be diſreſpected accordingly? Doubtleſſe ſuch an advantage would not have been let paſſe, had P. H. been guilty of any ſuch diſobedience unto his Ordinary: Since it is well underſtood, that the Archb. is not ſo tender of that mans credit &amp; reputation. And ſuch have beene the accuſations and informations of the Ordinary and his Friars, againſt P. H. at Rome, himſelfe never being called to his anſwer either here or there.
         
         
            CAP. IV. Paul Harris not admitted to any hearing of his Dioceſan, was forced to ſeeke for Iuſtice at the hands of the Civill Magiſtrate.
            
               IT is the office of a Prelat, not onely to feed, but to governe his flocke. As the ſheepheard doth not only lead his ſheep to holeſome paſtures, but protects them from the jawes of all ravenous beaſts, &amp; ſuch of their fellowes as would be hurtfull unto them. This our Savior teacheth, ſetting down the parts of a good Sheepheard, Ioh. 10. from whoſe office, among all other profeſſions in the world, it pleaſed him to tranſferre that name unto the Governours of his Church, tearming both himſelfe, and them, Sheepheards, or Paſtors, ſaying; Ego ſum paſtor bonus &amp;c.
            
            Now Tho. Flemming a Paſtor, having P. H. a member of his flocke, whoſe cure &amp; charge belonged unto him,
and being wronged by ſome of them, who were alſo under his charge, and complaining of his aggrievances unto his Paſtor, could not bee admitted unto his preſence, ſending them by the hands of others, he ſpedd no better. And this P. H. doth averre to be true, not by his owne teſtimony, (which in his owne cauſe is worth nothing) but by the atteſtation of moſt grave &amp; Rev.perſons yet living, who have firmed the ſame with their owne hands, and are ready to juſtifie it before any Tribunall. Reade then as followeth.
            
               
                  VVEe whoſe names are here ſubſcribed, doe witneſſe; That in our preſence Tho. Flemming Archb. of Dublin, did renounce all correſpondency, either by word, or writing, with Paul Harris Prieſt, telling us plainly, that thence forward he never would receive either Letter or Petition from him, or would medle in any matter of his, for him, or againſt him; but wholly diſclaimed all juriſdiction, or power over him, wiſhing us to ſignifie ſo much unto the aforeſaid Paul Harris, which accordingly wee did,
                  
                     
                        
                           May 24. 1631.

            Thus P. H. being excluded from all audience &amp; correſpondencie with his Paſtor, he addreſſed himſelfe unto the Temporall Magiſtrate, yet neither in Eccleſiaſticall or Criminall cauſe, but meerely Civill, ſuch as was the detayning of ſome Bookes from him by a Prieſt, &amp; a Friar, and the ſame moſt injuſtly, as it appeared upon the hearing before the now Lo. Chiefe Iuſtice of the
Kings Bench, for by his order they were reſtored him. After this againe, P. H. underſtanding of ſome ſlanderous informations, made by Friars, and others againſt him, unto the Ordinary and weening that after ſo long a ſpace hee had beene come unto a better mind, hee ſollicited him againe for an audience, but being repulſed as before, he ſent him this meſſage; as followeth.
            
               
                  
                     
                        THis 15. day of May 1633,
                        
                     
                  
                  Wee whoſe names are here ſubſcribed, doe witneſſe; That being requeſted to deliver a meſſage unto the R. R. Tho. Flemming Archb. of Dublin, wee accordingly the yeare and day above written, delivered the ſame: The which was this. That whereas divers ſlanders &amp; accuſations are intimated unto your Ho. againſt the aforeſaid Paul Harris Pr. and preſented unto you his Paſtor, as alſo publiſhed abroad by divers Friars, and others, to the prejudice of the good name &amp; fame of the aforeſaid Marris: his requeſt unto you the Lo. Archb. by us, is; that you would be pleaſed according unto the Lawes and Canons of holy Church to judge him, firſt admitting him unto audience, and to his juſt defence.
                  The Lo. Archb. anſwer unto us, was: That in caſe Paul Harris would admit and receive an abſolution for the Excom. that he had notoriouſly incurred, hee would; otherwiſe not.

            Thus Reader thou ſeeſt, That two yeeres after the former denyall P. H. is againe debarred of audience by
the Archb. or elſe to be admitted upon ſuch tearmes, as to acknowledge an Excom. Of which Excom. for that himſelfe hath written very largely in two former Bookes, he will be here more briefe. The Excom. pretended againſt him, is; That he commenced a ſuit) as hath beene formerly ſaid) before a Temporall Magiſtrate againſt a Prieſt &amp; a Friar, for detaining of certain Bookes from him. For our Archb. &amp; his Friars are of opinion, that no Eccleſiaſticall perſons, ought to bee brought before a Temporall Magiſtrate, for what cauſe ſoever; and that the party ſo conventing them, incurres Excom. De Iure.
            
            To which P. H. anſwers; That no ſuch Canon was ever received, or practiſed in theſe Kingdomes, as hee hath largely declared in his former Bookes, and that he preferres the judgement of all antiquity under his Majeſty, and his Predeceſſours, before the opinion of Tho. Flemming and all his followers. Since thoſe who are learned in the Lawes, as well Canon, &amp; Civill, as Common, doe with one voyce agree, and have aſſured him: That in all cauſes &amp; actions, meerely Civill, of which nature this was, againſt the Prieſt &amp; the Carmelite Friar, that as well Biſhops, as Prieſts, Abbots, and Priors, did ſue, and were ſued in the Kings Courts, &amp; none other. If then all Biſhops and Prieſts, Abbots and Friars, who have conſented and allowed of this practiſe, for theſe thouſand yeeres &amp; upward, did maintaine an error, I thinke P. H. had better venture upon that error, then upon the skill of a Prelat who never yet ſtudied out of his owne Friary, or tooke degree in any Vniverſity. But this Phyſician who is ſo liberall of his plaſters, offering his abſolutions, before the Penitents aske them:
Sith he can not cure himſelfe, let him ſeeke a remedy in time for his owne ſores, not being ignorant that himſelfe is notoriouſly excommunicated ab homine, and by authority of this preſent Pope Vrbanus 8. in the controverſie twixt Patrick Cahil, &amp; Patrick Brangan, frō which (to the great ſcandall of Gods Church) we never heard that yet hee received an abſolution. And I pray God, that not guilty of ſchiſme, and hereſie, he ſtands not alſo excommunicate De Iure.
            
            But now ex abundanti: Let it be ſuppoſed, (for granted it will never be) that to draw Eccleſiaſticall perſons before Secular Tribunalls, in all cauſes as well Civill as Eccleſiaſticall &amp; Criminall, is unlawfull, and that the Canons inhibite the ſame under Excom. Suppoſe alſo, that this Law be received, and in all times hath beene in viridi obſervantiâ, practiſed in theſe Kingdomes. I ſay all this being granted as moſt true &amp; undoubted, P. H. is as cleare from all ſpot of Excom. as the ſun-beames, or the water in the fountaine. As how? Forſooth upon this ground; That before he convented thoſe Eccleſiaſticall men, to wit, the Prieſt &amp; the Friar above mentioned, hee was denyed all audience and correſpondencie with his Prelate the Archb. either by word or writing, as before hath beene declared &amp; teſtified. In which caſe it is lawfull, not onely for a Prieſt, but for a Layman to ſeeke for Iuſtice at the hands of the Temporall Magiſtrate, againſt a Cleargy-man, and to convent him before a Secular Tribunall: I ſay, in caſe his Prelate refuſe to heare him, or to admit his complaint, or to doe him juſtice, Reade for this De Iudiciis tit. 1. cap. 7. Qualiter &amp; Quando, together with the Gloſs, &amp; you will find theſe words: Quod in defectum juſtitiae, Clerici ad judicium ſeculare
trahi poſſunt:
               So Aaor. c. 14. q. 2. Farinaſ. q 8. De Inquiſit-Ambroſinus cap 18 n. 39. Molina de Iuſt. tract. 2, diſput. 31. concluſ 4. Salas de leg. diſp. 14. ſect. 9. n. 111. with many others.
                That for want of Iuſtice, Clergy-men may be drawne to Secular Tribunalls. Caſus; Titius a Prieſt is indebted one hundred Crownes to Sempronius Prieſt, or Lay-man, the debt cannot be denyed, the day of payment is expired: but Titius will not performe. Sempronius is of our Friars opinion, that it ought to bee tryed &amp; recovered before the Ordinary; but the Ordinary will not heare him, or receive his libell. Where ſhall Sempronius ſue his Bond againſt Titius? At Rome? But that hath not beene ſeene or heard of, ſince the Capitoll was built. Ergo, he muſt either looſe his debt, or take the benefit of the Canon. In defectum juſtitiae, Clerici ad ſeculare judicium trahi poſſunt, as before. And S. Athanaſius: doubted not long before the Canon was thought of, to convert the Arian Heretiques his falſe accuſers of foule crimes before Conſtantius the Emperour. Athan. in Apolog. ad Constant. And before him S. Paul, Act. 25. appealed in the Controverſies he had with his owne Nation the Iewes, unto Caeſar. Appello Caſarem. But if you anſwer, that in the aforeſaid caſes, there was no ſpirituall ſuperiour Prelat or Biſhop to heare, or to determine their cauſes. I then reply: And what diſtinction make you twixt a Prelat that will not heare a Prieſts cauſe, and no Prelat at all Verily none. And this was, &amp; ſtill is the caſe of P. H. who before his Ordinary never yet could be admitted either plaintiffe or defendant. Wherfore I conclude, that in conventing his Adverſaryes, though Prieſts, before the Temporall Magiſtrate in Civill cauſes, hee did not incurre any cenſure of Excom. being warranted by the Canon above alleadged; In defectum juſtitiae, Clerici ad ſeculare tribunal trahi poſsunt: For want of Iuſtice, Cleargy-men may be
convented before the Secular Iudgment. Vnleſſe wee will maintaine the Archb. Tho. Flemming to be above the Canon, which is not onely abſurd, but hereticall.
            And let my Reader (whether Friend or Adverſary) obſerve, that neither Brangan, or Doyle, can be excuſed from Excom. De Iure, in the conventing of P. H. before the Temporall Magiſtrate, he never having to this day declined the juriſdiction, or forum of the Ordinary. So as the Canon De Iudiciis, Qualiter &amp; Quando, which hath excuſed P. H. for drawing them before Secular Iudgments, namely In defectum juſtitiae, can no ſort militat in their behalfe, who have ſuffered no defect of Iuſtice from their Ordinary. In fine then, they remaine abſolutely excommunicated, together with their Maſter, and may ſay; Iam ſumus ergo pares.
            
         
         
            CAP. V. Of the want of judgment and diſcretion in the Biſhop and Friars, the perſecutors of Paul Harris.
            
            
               IS it poſſible, that man a reaſonable creature, &amp; made unto the Image of GOD, ſhould have his reaſon ſo over-ruled with paſſion, and his judgment ſo overmaſtered with malice, as they ſhould be powerfull, not onely to obſcure, but in a ſort to extinguiſh the light thereof? For not to ſpeake of conſcience, &amp; common honeſty, which as in every Chriſtian ought chiefly to prevaile, ſo, eſpecially in Church-men, who are to be guides, &amp; leaders of others unto their ſalvation. How is it poſſible, that wit, capacity, or common ſenſe, ſhould not avert theſe men from ſuch violent and out-ragious courſes againſt P. Harris?
            
            
            Is it becauſe that glorious Greatneſſe who ſits at the Helme of Government is pleaſed moſt graciouſly to grant unto us ſome more favourable reſpect then in times paſt uſing us (not with ſtanding what difference ſoever with others in points of doctrine) with all indiffērecie in the Politique government: As if he ſhould ſay,

                  
                     Tros Tyriuſque mini nullo dìſerimine habetur.
                  
                  Papiſts and Proteſtants are one to mee,
                  Who in ſubjects ducties ſo well agree.
               
Such is the influence of that bleſſed aſpect in our dread and no leſſe beloved Soveraigne, with that gracious &amp; propitious Starre, to their perpetuall glory, and our unſpeakable comfort. O then! what pitty is it? That golden Peace, and gowned Reſt, ſhould be the parents of ſo foule an off-ſpring, as is diſcord and diſſention.
            Is it? That we have already ſurfetted of Eaſe, and in ſo ſhort a time become weary of ſo long-expected a well-fare, that now (the rod and rigour of State being removed) we ſhould embolden our ſelves upon domeſticall broyles.
            Is it? For that a way is given, nor onely to the freedome of our Conſciences, but even to the moderate &amp; diſcreet exerciſe of our ſpirituall Functions, as well Epiſcopall, as Prieſtly, that we ſhould contend alſo for Secular power and preheminencie, to the encroaching upon our Caeſars juriſdiction?
            Is this the gratitude, and thankfulneſſe wee owe and ſhew, for theſe our, Halcyon dayes in which no ſtorme is either for the preſent felt or for the furure feared: If our owne ungraciouſineſſe, and intemperate ambition doe not abbreviat and ſhorten the ſame.
            Verily, if our Friars had but read their Eſopſ fables,
they might have better underſtood themſelves. The ſluggard is ſent, to ſchoole unto the piſmire with a vade ad formicam tiger, pro. 4. Goe to the piſmire O ſluggard, and may not the Friar be ſent unto his fables of Eſop, with a vade ad Eſopum ſtulte? Get thee to thy Eſops fables, O foole; and from the example of the Frog and the Mouſe, learne wiſdome: For there thou mayſt obſerve, how the Frog aſſaulting the Mouſe, &amp; the Mouſe defending himſelfe: In the heat of that fierce combat, when neither of them had leyſure to look about them, downe comes the Hawke ſuddenly from the ſtand, and at one ſtoop, ſeaſing upon them both, ended their quarrell.
            Alas! have theſe men ſo ſoone forgotten S. Stevens day? when for the non-obſervance of ſome points of a Proclamation, all our Houſes and Oratoryes were in one houre ſeaſed unto the Kings uſe. May not our Franciſcans remember, that the firſt blaſt and brunt of that tempeſt, diſcharged it ſelfe upon their owne Cells &amp; Oratoryes? For as we reade, that ſome Cityes have beene raſed, and ſowed with ſalt; others, their walls diſmantled: So was that their Convent in Cooke-ſtreet defaced, having their roofe &amp; timber-work pull'd downe &amp; levelled with the ground. A ſad ſpectacle and exemplar; for whoſe offence, and the rude uproare of that day, others (no doubt) were the leſſe ſpared.
            Alas! hath malice againſt one man ſo blinded their judgments, and ſo perverted their wills? that ſooner then they will ceaſe to wage an unplacable warre with one Prieſt, they will not onely hazard their own peace &amp; quiet, but even of the Church in theſe parts. Know they not how ſoone, and how ſuddenly the Royall
Falcon, (if he will daigne to ſo low a ſtoop) can end the battle betwixt the Frog &amp; the Mouſe, to the ruine of both? Doe they not yet underſtand, that two ſcratches of a gooſe's quill, can baniſh both Biſhop, Prieſt, and Friar, &amp; that not only from their ſeverall Dioceſes, Pariſhes, &amp; Convents, but even out of his Majeſties Dominions? At what time as well friend as foe, beholding (for our demerits) ſuch calamities to befall us, ſhall point us out with the ſinger of Gens abſ

                   prudentiâ &amp;c. Loe, a people without wit &amp; underſtanding. Had P. H. apoſtated from his faith, or had he turned a Iew, or a Turke, then had his perſecution frō theſe men wholly calmed. Nay, many doubt not to ſay, that our Regulars would have much rejoyced, and gloryed therein. But now that (through Gods mercy) he preſerves himſelfe, and endeavours to keepe thoſe alſo in the Catholique faith, who begin to ſwarve there-from; therefore is he made (if not the onely butt, yet) the principall marke againſt whom they ſhoote their poyſoned darts. But P. H. may comfort himſelfe in this: That Regium eſt benè facere, &amp; malè audire; It is one of to doe well, and to be evill ſpoken of. And it is one of the eight Beatitudes pronounced by our Saviours own mouth, Math. 5. Beatì eſtis cùm maledixerint vobis, &amp; perſecuti vos fuerint &amp;c.
            
         
         
            
            CAP. VI. P. H. is in hope, that the Archb. and his Friars, looking back into themſelves, will in time be reclaymed, and become his friends.
            
               WE have in our Engliſh Proverbe; that, They goe very farre who never returne. And Seneca out of the Poet Menander tels us; That friendſhips ſhould indeed be eternall; but enmityes mortall and determinable.
            
               Immortales inimicitias ne retine, mortalis exiſtens. but nothing ought to bee more effectuall with Chriſtians to this purpoſe, then the doctrine of our Saviour, which teacheth, that the marke by which his Diſciples are knowne &amp; diſtinguiſhed from others, is Charity among themſelves, Iohn 13. By this ſhall all men know that you are my Diſcipl
                     ••
                  , if you love one another. And the beloved Diſciple, ſpeaking of the contrary vice, 1. Iohn. 3. Omnis qui odit fratrem ſuum, homicida est, &amp;c. Whoſoever hateth his brother, is a murderer. And why ſhould I not hope, that theſe men may not onely come unto their wits againe, but alſo to their wills, rectified and reformed, and as new-borne Babes, abandoning all malice, deceit, ſimulation, envy, and detraction, grow up unto ſalvation? I ſay, why ſhould I not hope theſe things of them? For I underſtand, that ſome of them already doe day lie pray for me. And I doubt not but their prayers are, That God will give mee patience to endure all injuryes wrongs, and perſecutions at their hands; and above all, to deliver mee from their bad
tongues: And I thanke God, in this Chriſtian duetie, I am not behind, for I alſo pray for them, Inter ſchiſmaticos &amp; hareticos, till ſuch time as God ſhall be pleaſed to give them grace to recall their doctrines of Habits and Scapulars, and ceaſe to commend unto us the Luiſsian Faſt. But howſoever they ſhould (as God forbid) perſevere ſtill mine enemies and perſecutors, yet am I alſo bound by the precept of Chriſt, both to love mine enemies, and to pray for my perſecutors. Notwithſtanding I may in the meane time endeavour to defend my ſelfe, &amp; to ſeeke juſtice againſt them, ſince the Prophet David hath taught me; that Charity &amp; Iuſtice are compatible, and that Peace and Iustice way kiſſe each other.
            
            And as touching this union of Charity and Iuſtice: It is not frō the purpoſe to recount an accident which hapned in Sivill of Spaine, in the time that my ſelfe lived there. A certaine Iudge of a Court, called in their language an Oydor, riding ſomewhat late in the evening, was by his enemy who ſought his life, aſſaulted in the ſtreet, and by whom he was mortally wounded, yet ſo as he lived in perfect ſenſe &amp; memory ſome few dayes after. The Murderer in the meane time was apprehended, and being brought unto the party, he humbly upon his knees confeſſing his moſt wicked attempt, beſought him with many teares to forgive him. To whom ſayth the wounded Iudge, being at hand to yeeld up the Ghoſt: Yes brother, from the Tyles of the Houſe upward, I freely forgive thee; but from the Tyles downward, I deſire Iuſtice may bee done upon thee. And in the ſame minde that hee was dying, am I now living; From the Thatch of the Houſe upward, I freely forgive all my adverſaryes, perſecutors, and enemyes: That is,
I deſire all heavenly graces &amp; good gifts from the Father of Lights to deſcend downe upon them, and after this life, the ſalvation of their ſoules in Heaven: Moreover I deſire that the good Angells of GOD may keep them in all their wayes, &amp; protect them from all harme in body, goods, &amp; good name. Notwithſtanding from the Thatch downeward, I will not deſiſt to call &amp; cry for Iuſtice, and ſatiſfaction againſt them, ſo long as I amable either to write, or ſpeake; which ſatiſfaction &amp; reparation of wrongs, as in part I have already by the Iudgment of the Civill Magiſtrate, received againſt ſome, (for which I ſhall ever remaine moſt thankfull,) So am I in hope, the like Iuſtice remaines for the reſt; which with patience I will expect. For the former, reade as followeth.

            CAP. VII. Of the conveyance of theſe Letters from Rome, into Ireland, and by what meanes they came unto the hands of the Archb. Flemming.
            
            
               BEing lately in the Country, it was my chance in ſome communication with one of my acquaintance, to ask of him, if he knew, or could gueſſe, how the Cardinalls Letters were paſſed into Ireland, and came to the hands of Dublinenſis, whether by the poſt of Paris, or Antwerp, &amp;c. He anſwered very pleaſantly, he could ſoone reſolve mee in that point, and that they neither came by the way of Paris or Antwerp, but by the way of Loretto. Your reaſon quoth I. Why? quoth he, wot you not that there paſſed from Ireland certaine Pilgrims for Loretto the laſt yeare, &amp; ſo from Loretto, to Rome, and returned back this laſt Spring? Now, before they returned home from their pilgrimage, there was not a word ſpoken of theſe Letters; but ſince their arrivall, all the Countrey hath ſounded of them. This diſcourſe of my friend, made mee remember a paſſage which I read ſome 50. yeares agoe, in a Sermon of Hugh Latimer, which as then, ſo I now relate, to parallell his conceit.
            It hapned in the dayes of Henry 8. that many ſhips being caſt away upon the coaſt of Kent, eſpecially in that place which to this day is called Goodwins ſands. The Councel thought good to grant a Cōmiſſion to examin ſuch as were of the moſt ancient inhabitants of thoſe parts, if there could be any cauſe found thereof, who
being called to Dover, were required to ſay their opinions in that caſe, what they thought might be the occaſion of thoſe dangerous ſeas &amp; ſands, now infamous for ſhipwracks, which informer times had no ſuch note of danger. Among the examined, one old man ſtood up &amp; told the Commiſſioners, that for his part, he wiſt well what was the cauſe of thoſe troubleſome ſands, which ſwallowed up ſo many ſhips, and by my hood (ſayth he) it is no other then Tenderton ſteeple. I ſay (quoth he) and will abide by it, that Tenderton ſteeple is the cauſe of Goodwin ſands. For I can well remember the building of Tenderton ſteeple, and before it was built, there was no Goodwin ſands, but ſoon after the building of that ſteeple I could heare the ſea-faring men in the Church-yard after Even-ſong, and in the Ale-houſe, complaine much of thoſe ſands, and they would tell, how ſuch a ſhip, ſuch a Barque or Pinnace was there ſunke &amp;c. Well, well, quoth my friend (interrupting me) it is enough, you have very ſtrongly confirmed my opinion of the Letters; but what matter is it whether the Pilgrims are the cauſe of Goodwins ſands, or Tenderton ſteeple brought the Letters frō 
               Rome, let thoſe whō the matter concernes more then you &amp; me, look to it. For ſince they have the threed by the end, they know how to wynde it up. But ſince by this occaſion we are fallen into mention of the Pilgrimage of Loretto, I pray you reſolve what opinion you hold of that ſtrange Houſe of our Ladyes, of which there runneth ſo great a fame, as it drawes us out of Ireland from our Houſes, Wives &amp; Children, to the great danger of our perſons, &amp; expence of our purſes, unleſſe for ſuch as make a bon voyage of it, &amp; receive fifteene for five at their returne home. And as for the miracles,
we heare very much with our cares, but wee ſee little with our eyes; neither the blind or deafe to returne welſenſed: as for the halt and the lame, I leſſe marvaile, for few of them can reach ſo farre. Nay bir lady, I have known ſome to carry hence a paire of good leggs with them, &amp; ſcarce have brought them ſo ſound back again. Beſides they tell us, that Houſe did uſe to flye in the aire, by ſea &amp; land, above a thouſand leagues: now it is ſtrange to us, that a Houſe that hath no leggs to goe upon, ſhould have wings to flye withall. Of theſe &amp; other matters no leſſe wonderfull, I pray you ſhew us the truth, and how farre they may bee beleeved; for I confeſſe, God's above all &amp;c. And I thinke by this time there was as many gathered about to liſten to our talke, as were aſſembled in Queene Dido's Hall, to heare Aeneas diſcourſe of the Trojan warre.
            Well then (quoth I) if ſo great a longing you have to heare the hiſtory of the Lauretan Houſe, &amp; the ſtupendious wonders of that holy place. Albeit the lights upon yonder cup-bord are now ſpent farre below their waſtes, &amp; ſo invite us rather to retire our ſelves unto our lodgings, then to begin any new diſcourſe: yet to ſatiſfie your no leſſe earneſt, then harmleſſe curioſity, I will begin.
            Know then, that I have not onely read and heard of this Houſe but I have ſeen the ſame, and (which I more eſteeme) my ſelfe within it. And for the reaſons which ſhall after be alleadged) I am perſwaded this is the very ſame Houſe in which the bleſſed Virgin the Mother of GOD was borne, in which ſhe received the Angelicall ſalutation, and in which the Saviour of the World in his infancie was nurſed and bred. And albeit (I confeſſe)
that of ſome it is ſcarce beleevod, how this Houſe (now uſed as a Chappell) came to be tranſported from Nazareth, ſo many, hundred leagues by ſcarce &amp; land, Et per varios caſus, after ſo many remouealls, to be placed where now it ſtands in the Picene Territory, neere unto Ancona in Italy.

            Firſt then for the Poſſe, thoſe who believe the omnipotencie of GOD, cannot doubt of the poſſibility of the tranſportation of this Houſe, no more then they can of that hiſtory of the Prophet Habaccuck, who by the haire of the head was carryed by the Angell, from Indea into Babylon, to Daniel, to give him his dinner in the Lyons denne, and from thence back againe, Dan. 14. or of the aſſumption of Elias in a fiery chariot into heaven. 2. Kings 2. Or of Philip, who (frō the Eunuch whom heliad baptized) was by the ſpirit placed in Azotus, Act. 8. The difficulty then is, Defacto eſſe, whether indeed this tranſportation of the Lauretan Houſe is by the ſame faith to be beleeved, as the former examples out of the Old and New Teſtament. I anſwere, No. Thoſe by divine faith excluding all uncertainty for the authority of the revealer, the Holy Ghoſt this leaning upon humane teſtimony, hath accordingly humane credibility, not voyd of all uncertainty, yet not dangerous unto ſalvation, and may bee embraced without diſparagement to any mans wiſedome, were he equall therein to Solon, or Salva

                  on. For as we beleeve the Citty of Rome to have beene founded by Romalus, becauſe ſome prophane. Writers doe ſo report: Why may not ſo much credit given unto the Relatours &amp; Legendars of that hiſtory called Domus Lauretana, being Chriſtians, &amp; more pious Hiſtorians then the former?
It ſeemes to me not much different from a miraculous preſervation, that M. Manlius, one man, in the night defended the Capitoll from the Gaules, after they had aſcended the height thereof, expulſing and throwing them downe head-long, being deſtitute both of Weapon &amp; Armour. Memorable is that alſo &amp; in my opinion not much ſhort of a miracle: That Horatius Cocles, a valiant Roman, &amp; blind of one eye, by his alone proweſſe with-ſtood Porſenna King of the Tuſcans, &amp; his whole Army, invading the Citty, &amp; ſtanding upon the bridge, defended the paſſage, &amp; made it good, one man againſt a multitude, till ſuch time as his Citizens (being at dinner, &amp; not underſtanding of that danger) comming to their doores and windowes, and ſeeing in what eſtate matters were, iſſued forth to his ayde, and breaking downe the bridge behinde him, hee with no leſſe admiration, threw himſelfe into the river Tibris, and in his Armour, ſwamme unto the Citty ſhoare without any harme. What thinke you of the two twinnes Romulus &amp; Remus, immediatly after their birth, throwne into the river Tibris, at the command of Amulius, &amp; being caſt upon the ſhoare, were no leſſe wonderouſly preſerved by the kinde foſterſhip of a ſhee Wolfe, who left her owue whelpes to give them ſuck? What ſhall we ſay of Tarquinius Priſcus the fift King of the Romans, who cut a whetſtone in two parts with a raſor? Servius Tull us ſeene many times with a flame of fire about his head, licking his haire &amp; temples. Can wee beleeve all this, and many other things no leſſe ſtrange, for the authority of one Livy, renowned in the Roman hiſtory? And muſt whatſoever is related by ſo many pious Authors, and conſented unto, by the Suffrages (in a manner) of all
Chriſtians, as touching that ſacred Houſe of Loretto, be throwne out of doores? To come to Eccleſiaſticall hiſtory, we reade that Gregory, B. of Neoceſarea, called (for his great &amp; many miracles) Thaumaturgus, removed a Rock out of his place; &amp; this is related by no meaner an Author then the great S. Baſil, a Primative Father, and an ancient Doctor of Gods Church, who doubteth not to compare the aforeſaid Gregory, to Moſes, the Prophets &amp; the Apoſtles. This S. Gregory lived in the yeare 233. after our Saviour, &amp; S. Baſil 370. both of them in the Primitive times of the Church. We know who ſaid unto his Diſciples, if they had faith, as a graine of muſtard ſeed, they ſhould ſay unto this mountaine, remove hence, &amp; it ſhould obey, Math. 17. And the like of the Mulberry tree. Luke 17.
            
            Neither doe I applaud that opinion, that maintaines all miracles to have ceaſed with the Apoſtles and Diſciples of our Saviour. For (methinkes) that doctrine is not conſonant to theſe Scriptures, Mar. 16. Signa autem cos qui crediderint hac ſequentur, &amp;c. The ſignes that ſhall follow ſuch as beleeve, are theſe; In my Name ſhall they cast out devils, they ſhall ſpeake with new tongues, they ſhall take away ſerpents, &amp; if they drinke any thing that is deadly, it ſhall not hurt them: they ſhall lay hands upon the ſick, &amp; they ſhall be healed, &amp;c. Of which miracles, albeit ſome of them were wrought by the Apoſtles, and recorded in their Acts, yet why this Scripture may not extend to the faithfull in all ages, according to that order &amp; diſtribution of gifts, layde downe by the Apoſtle, 1. Cor. 12. I would willingly underſtand? And ſome verily GOD hath ſet in the Church: firſt Apostles, ſecondly Prophets, thirdly Doctours, next miracles, then the graces
of doing cures, helpes, governments, kindes of tongues. Are all Apoſtles? Are all Prophets? Are all Doctors? Are all Miracles? Have all the grace of doing cures? Doe all ſpeake with tongues? Doe all interpret? This text then that proves unto us, that in the Church are placed Doctors, helpes, &amp; governments, tells us alſo, that in the ſame, GOD hath ſet miracles, &amp; graces of healing; neither was the Church which our bleſſed Saviour purchaſed with his owne Bloud, and the Holy Ghoſt, enriched with thoſe divine graces, to endure only for the time of the Apoſtles, and the 42. Diſciples, but even unto his ſecond comming, &amp; yeelding up his government into the hands of his Father. By the ſame reaſon then that they exclude miracles, they muſt alſo exile Doctours, helpes, &amp; governments out of the Church, all concluded by the Apoſtle in one catalogue, &amp; theſe later confirmed to be perpetuall in the Church. Epheſ. the 4. and conſequently the former. Againe, our Saviour ſayth, Iohn 14.12. Amen, amen I ſay unto you, he that beleeveth in me, the workes that I doe, he alſo ſhall doe, and greater workes then theſe ſhall be doe. But we finde not this Scripture fulfilled in any of the Apoſtles, or of his Diſciples, or in all of them put together, whoſe miracles (ſo farre forth as we reade of them in holy Writ) did neither in number or excellencie, equall our Saviours miracles, and much leſſe exceede them. Who then be they that ſhall doe greater workes then our Saviour did? but the faithfull who were to ſucceed in the future ages of the Church? of which times now to deſcend to ſpeake, me thinkes it would argue either too much ſimplicitie, or ſingularitie, to diſcredit all thoſe miracles, aſcribed as well to the Saints departed this life, and their Reliques, as to
the living; by thoſe Fathers and Doctours of Gods Church, who for their antiquity, ſanctity, and learning, all ages have, and ever ſhall admire.
            S. Iohn Chryſoſtome, in a whole Booke againſt the Pagans, proveth that Chriſt was God, becauſe he wrought miracles, not onely by S. Peters ſhadow, and S. Paul his hand-kerchiefe, but alſo by the reliques and monuments of Saints, and namely by the aſhes of S. Babilas. As Almighty GOD by the bones of the Prophet Elizeus gave life unto a dead corps, ſo ſoone as it touched them, 4. Reg. 13. See for this S. Chryſost. lib. de Babilamar. tom. 5.
            
            
               Euſebius. B. of Caeſarca, who flouriſhed in the yeare 326. reports in his Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory, That the woman who was cured by our Saviour of a Flux of Bloud, Mat. 9. having the Image of our Saviour made of braſſe, and placed before her doore, there did grow up a certaine ſtrange hearbe at the foot of the Image, which ſo ſoone as in growth it came to touch the hemme of our Saviours garment in that Statua, it became medicinable to the curing of all infirmityes, but being taken before it ſprung up to that height, it had no vertue at all. And the ſame Author tells us, that this ſame braſen Image of our Saviour continued till his time, and that he ſaw it with his owne eyes. Euſeb. eccleſ. hiſtor. lib. 7. cap. 14.
            
            What ſhal we ſay unto the miracles wrought by S. Paul. the firſt Hermite, and by Hilarion, recorded by S. Hierom? The miracles of many Saints, wrought at their tombes and monuments, teſtified by S. Auguſtine in his Bookes De civitate Dei? The miracles of S. Martin, written by Severus Sulpitius. The innumerable miracles of the holy Ermites, living in the deſarts of Lybia, recounted by Theoderet
               in his religious hiſtory? The miracles approved by S Gregory the Great in his Dialogues? The miracles reported by S. Bede in his Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory &amp; lives of Saints? with infinite others, recorded by Eccleſiaſticall Writers of later times: muſt all theſe bee ranked with the Legends of Amadis de Gaule, of Huyon of Burdeaux, of Primaleon of Greece, or the Knight of the Sun? O no: neither judgment, nor piety can allow of it.
            But to draw to a concluſion, That it may appeare unto our ſenſes, that miracles are not ceaſed, but continued among us even till theſe times: And that Almighty GOD hath not ſo reſtrained his power to the Ordinary courſe of ſecondary cauſes, as that ſometimes, and ſo often as he is pleaſed, he tranſcendeth not all the works of Nature, ſhewing ſuch wonders among us, as that the moſt refractary cannot but ſay with the unbeleeving Iewes, Act. 4.16. Ecce manifeſtum ſignum factum eſt, &amp; non poſſumus negare: Behold, a manifeſt miracle is wrought among us, and we cannot deny it. I will then only inſiſt in that kinde of miracle which is called: Gratia ſanitatū, the gift of healing diſeaſes, inſerted in the Liſt of miracles, both by our Saviour, Mar. 16. and by the Apoſtle 1. Cor. 12. which gift ab effectis, is apparant to have beene conferred from above, unto two Chriſtian Princes, as it were by an hereditary deſcent frō immemorable times, namely, the King of England, and the French King, who onely by the touch of their hands. (calling upon Almighty GOD) doc cure that diſeafe which in Greeke is called 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , in Latine ſtruma, and in our Engliſh tongue ſcarce known by any other name then the Kings evill, ſoyclepped from the Crowned Curers. Neither is this infirmity helped by any other Prince, or Potentate
upon Earth, but by thoſe two ſacred &amp; anointed Kings, neither have they the gift of helping any other diſeaſe or infirmity in mans body, this onely excepted. By what then hath beene ſaid, as touching the authentication of miracles, as well in moderne, as ancient times, I ſee not but according to the weight &amp; worth of the reporters, they may receive admittance: It being no leſſe a fault of indiſcretion to beleeve nothing, as to beleeve every thing in that kinde publiſhed.
            And now in the laſt place, it remaines to anſwere unto my friends objection, made in the beginning of this Chap. That (forſooth) many infirme &amp; diſeaſed perſons returne from Rome &amp; Loretto, &amp; other holy places, with as little health as they paſſed hence; which difficultie ſhal be the better reſolved, if wee conſider the varietie of Pilgrimes, and digeſt them into their ſeverall rankes: Sith among thoſe that paſſe into forraine Countreyes, you have in a manner as many ends &amp; purpoſes, as perſons.
            For firſt we have the Curious Pilgrim, whom cōmonly we call the Traveller, either ſome yong Gallant in his minority, or lately wived, or who either upon ſome diſcontent leaving their home, &amp; friends, make the ſcope &amp; end of their peregrination (according to the beſt interpretation) to furniſh themſelves with knowledge &amp; experience, obſerving the various manners of Men and Cittyes, &amp; not alwayes in motion, but ſometimes at anchor in ſome famous Vniverſity, to heare a Pythagoras, a Plato, or an Ariſtotle. Who (to obſerve that ſhort precept of Tully) it ſhall never repent thē at their cōming home. Peregrini, &amp; incolae officium est, nihil praeter negotium ſuum agere. Officer. It becomes a Pilgrim, and an Inmaco, to
meddle with nothing but his owne affaires. Neither would I wiſh this our curious Pilgrim to bee too long abſent from home, leſt he taſte of ſuch diſcommodities as Vlyſſes did, at his returne to Ithaca.
            
            Our ſecond Pilgrime is the Covetous Pilgrim, a venturer, though no merchant, who deſignes his voyage to ſome one ſet place, admitting a probability of danger, either in reſpect of the Countrey ſo remote, or of the indiſpoſition of his body, for age, or infirmity, in regard whereof, he covenants before he departs from his own ſmoake, to multiply the greater, by the leſſer number, according to the expoſing of his Dollors, Dublons, Rings, Chaynes, Iewels, Horſes, Coaches, &amp; what not: That at his returne (if ever) he may ſay.
—I am mihi quarto: I am decies redit in rugam. Perſ. Sat. 6.
               
his Creditors at home (in the meane time) curſing thoſe leggs that ſhall ever bring him back.
            Our third Pilgrim, is the Counterfeit Pilgrim, who under pretence of devotion, viſiting the moſt memorable Pilgrimages of Chriſtendome, he walkes by Cathedrall Churches, Abbayes, &amp; Hoſpitalls, not diſdayning alſo (Si ſpes refulſerit nummi) to viſit places of inferiour note. To which purpoſe, as the prologue to his intended &amp; pretended Pilgrimage, he puts himſelfe into a Pilgrims Habit, which is a gray Friſe coat, ſide to the mid-legg, well girt unto him, a ſtiffe felt of a courſe hat of the ſame colour, a ſtrong aſhen ſtaff in his hand about his own pitch, with two bigg knots toward the upper end. His knapſack, and his Calavas, accommodated under his left arme, with the proviſion in them of an Noahs Arke. And to the end it may appeare, that he beggs
not of any neceſſity, but onely like a young Ieſuite for mortification, his holland-ſhirt hangs halfe a foot out of his ſleeve at the hand, &amp; below his Friſe Habit, you ſhall diſcover a faire ſilke ſtocking upon his legg, for by that ſleight he ſhall be held by ſtrangers, a man of note &amp; faſhion in his Countrey, &amp; that thorough extremity of piety, he travells ſo diſguiſed, to give ſatiſfaction unto his ſuppoſed moſt ſincere devotion, either voluntarily undertaken, or injoyned for pennance. And whereas the needy beggar, veſted as well in-ſide, as out-ſide, with pure unfayned poverty, ſhall with much importunity get a penny, this Counterfeit will purchaſe a pound, and after a few moneths, returnes home, like a Spaniſh Gallion from the Weſt Indyes.
            
            Our fourth Pilgrim, who from his motion may bee termed the Rolling Pilgrim, being very penurious, makes a vertue of neceſſity, no leſſe mindful of his wallet then of his devotion, eating the ſinnes of the people by whom he paſſeth, whoſe travells commonly do end either with his health, or with his life, imitating the motion of the heavenly bodies; for as they rolle about the circumference, ſo he about the center. Neither doth it much import where he beginnes, ſince hee is not determined where to conclude &amp; make an end. Meeting him then upon the borders of France, comming from the never-waſting taper of Arras, he tends for Amiens in Picardy, there to viſite the head of S. Iohn Baptiſt. Thence he paſſeth to S. Denis, where beſides many other rare Reliques in rich incloſures, he doth reverence the thorne of our Saviours Crowne. And ſo to Paris, proſtrated at the ſhrine of S. Genovefa, neither forgets he in his walke the reſt of the nostre Dames of France: deſcending
to Marſells in Provence, hee religiouſly adores the Reliques of S. Lazarus, whom our Saviour Iohn 11. raiſed to life: next hee arrives at Baubne, where hee tenders his devotion at the body of the bleſſed Magdalen, who anointed our Saviours head, and waſhed his feete with her teares: Then entring into Savoy, &amp; paſſing the Alpine rocks &amp; mountaines of ſnow, hee deſcends into Piemont, where he viſits the Reliques of S. Euſebius B. of Vercells. At Millan in Lombardy, he viſits the monument of S. Ambroſe; as alſo of S. Carolus Borromeus, both Biſh. of that place: thence to Padua, to honour the Reliques of S. Antony. From thence he ſpeeds himſelfe to the holy Chamber of Loretto, made glorious by the preſence of our Saviour in his Childhood, his Mother, and S. Ioſeph.

            Where after the tribute of his devotion payde, (if his poverty, and no better and out-ſide, bee not an impediment) he ſhal be admitted into the Sacristia, to beholde not onely the ſumptuous ornaments of the Church, but the rich offerings of Emperours, Kings &amp; Princes, of Queenes, Nobles, and Ladyes, of greater value then all the land and fertile ſoyle he can behold from the hill of Tarro, where I adviſe him to looke to his conſcience in the matter of the tenth Commandement. And now taking his leave of Loretto, I wot well hee haſtens to Rome, the Queene of Cityes, ſomtimes Empreſſe of the Earth, where hee preſents himſelfe Ad limina Apoſtolorum, before the Altar of the two Apoſtles S. Peter and S. Paul,
               he viſits the ſeven Churches, he makes the holy ſtaires, (being charitably entertained for three dayes diet, and lodging, in the Hoſpitall of the holy Trinity) It may be alſo his good hap to be admitted ad Menſam Papalem, to dine in his Hol. preſence, being the dayly ordinary of twelve poore Pilgrimes, but let him not expect to be admitted to that Table the ſecond time. And now enriched with Beades, Graynes, and Meddalls, and happily with ſome Reliques of the eleven thouſand Virgins, or of the martyred Legions in the dayes of Diocleſian preſerved at the trefontani, a mile from Rome (of which there be great ſtore, and ſo the leſſe eſteemed) he bids Rome farewell, with a Non habemus hic civitatem permanentem, &amp; ſetting his Palmers ſtaffe upon one end, he is indifferent which way it falls, but reſolved that way to wend; If towards the South, he holds his courſe for Naples, not ſtaying at all for the Convoy, knowing that the empty purſe, feares not the theefe, inviting in his way the Hoſpitalls to ſupper &amp; lodging; arriving at that noble Citty (mindfull of his vocation) firſt, with devout paſes, he ſets forward to the monument of S. Ianuarius, where with much admiration hee beholdes the martyrs bloud in a Viall, ſo often bubbling, &amp; boyling, as his head is brought in preſence of it: Having complyed with his devotions at the reſt of the Churches &amp; Chappels, &amp; collected the charitable almes of the Citty, he cuts over ſome two dayes ſayle, to Ligorne in Tuſ

                  ane, &amp; ſo betakes himſelfe to Luca, to the miraculous Crucifixe: thence by ſea or land to Pavia in Lombardy, where hee humbly loutes at the tombe of the great S. Auguſtine, in a Church, common both to the Ermites &amp; Canon Regulars of his Order. And ſo our Palmer bids
ſweet Italy adieu, the garden of the World, &amp; a terreſtriall Paradiſe: Importuning his charitable paſſage from Genoa in a Galley bound for Barcelona, whore comming a ſhore, after one dayes journey, he taſtes the entertainment of our bleſſed Lady of Monteſerrate, who hath a Diamond in her Crowne, valued at fourteene thouſand Duckets, the moſt frequented Pilgrimage, not onely of Catalaunia, but of all Spaine, admirable for the ſituation, a Monaſtery placed in the top of a mountaine, among the cloudes, the paſſage thereunto cut out with ſawes, from whence it hath the name of Monte-ſerrate: after this he paſſeth to Sarragoſa, where he bids his Beades before Nueſtra Sinnora de la Pillar, our Lady of the Pillar (her Statua being advanced on the top of a high ſmal Pillar in the chiefe Church,) which done, he bends his courſe to our Lady of Guadalupa; from thence to Sivill to Nueſtra Sinnora de Antigua, with ſo many ſilver lamps in ſilver chaynes depending, &amp; ever burning. And ſo leaving Andaluzia, he coaſts over Siera Morena, to Burgos, to worſhip the ſweating Crucifix: &amp; never reſts till he arrive at the body of S. Iames at Compoſtella in Gallicia a rich Monaſtery of the Benediotines; where refreſhing himſelfe ſome few dayes, he betakes himſelfe to his accuſtomed employments, and bidding Spaine a dios, hee bends his courſe for France, paſſing the mount of S. Adrian, among the Pyren hills, truſting to God, and to his good leggs, to finde himſelfe at Towres, againſt the Anniverſary ſolemnity of S. Martin, ſometimes B. of that place, whoſe Feaſt falls upon the 11 of November.
            
            And I pray God (quoth my friend interrupting mee againe) that your head grow not addle, with ſo many windings, &amp; turne abouts of your wandring Pilgrime;
but now having brought him to France where firſt you found him, I pray you bid him farewell, and give him leave to rolle where he liſt, for it ſeemes, that it is one of his vowes, never to reſt, ſo long as he can either goe, or creepe; &amp; (I trow) I have heard you ſometimes to ſay, ſuch Pilgrimes were ſeldome holy men, Qui multum peregrinantur, rarò ſanctifican

Nothing more encouraging a man to draw out the threed of his ſpeech to the ful length, then attentive Auditors, which I have found you hitherto to be. Having then paſſed through ſo many Pilgrimes: The Curious, the Covetous, the Counterfeit, and the Wanderer, Give me leave to adde to that number the fift, which is the Distreſſed Pilgrim, in ſpeaking of whom, had you my friend not interrupted my diſcourſe happily by this time I had given you an account of what you deſired at my hands in the beginning, which (if I doe not miſtake) is this.
            How comes it to paſſe (ſay you) That in thoſe which you call holy places, and have in ſo high an eſtimation, &amp; glory ſo much of their miracles? That we behold ſo great a number of Halt, Blinde, Deafe, Dumbe, lamed of their limmes, diſeaſed of their bodies, of Dropſies, Palſies, Conſumptions, Convulſions, Gouts, Sciaticks, Phrenſies, Ielouſies, Epilepſies, &amp;c? ſo few to be cured, or to returne home ſound of winde, &amp; lim, &amp; in perfect health? To which I anſwere. It ſeemes no more ſtrange then that ſo many ſitting at home, (where they have almighty GOD ſtill preſent with them) doe not recover of the ſame infirmities, For albeit we heare it ſaid, Petite &amp; dabitur vobis, quarite &amp; invenietis, pulſate &amp; aperietur
vobis. Luc. 11. Aske, &amp; it ſhalbe given you; ſeeke, &amp; you ſhall find; knock, &amp; it ſhalbe opened unto you. Yet S. Iames ſaith. Petitis &amp; non accipitis, eò quòd malè petatis, Iac. 4. You aske &amp; you receive not, &amp; the reaſon is added, becauſe you aske amiſſe. Whether then at home, or abroad, you aske amiſſe; that is, either things unlawfull, or in complacency of ſin, or with an inordinat deſire, as of health, or any other temporall benefit, which happily denyed, is better then obtayned. This inordinate deſire, not conformable to the will of GOD, &amp; repugnant unto our ſoules health, may be a ſufficient impediment of not receiving what is asked. Our diſtreſsed Pilgrime repaires unto Loretto; he ſpeeds not; he went blinde, he returnes blinde; he went crooked, he returnes with the ſame Nemeſis upon his ſhoulders; hee went hence with two good legges, hee comes limping home; hee went with a Dropſie, he comes home with a Timpany; hee went to be cured of his phrenſie, or his jealouſie, and he returnes madd. Was there then any inſufficiencie of almighty GOD, to have ſupplyed theſe defects, or to have remedied theſe diſeaſes at the memory of his Saints? O no. The Poet could ſay, Perſ.

            It is ſaid of our Saviour, Mar. 6. That in his owne Countrey of Nazareth, by reaſon of their incredulity, Non poterat virtutem ullam facere, he could not worke any miracle, but onely heale a few ſick perſons. Not that
our Saviour being GOD, could not work miracles, but that on their part there wanted apt diſpoſitiōs &amp; capacity unto them. Of which diſpoſitiōs, Faith is the principall? &amp; note, that Non poſſum is often in the Scriptures put for Nolo, I will not. So our Saviour ſayth in the Goſpell: The children of the Kingdome cannot faſt while he be with them, non poſsunt jejunare, as much as to ſay, nolunt jejunare, they will not faſt. So when a man takes himſelfe to be wronged, hee will commonly ſay, I can not put up this wrong at his hands: I can not diſgeſt it: as much to ſay, I will not.
            Againe, we muſt not inferre, that where diſpoſitions requiſite in the perſon of the Patient are found, as a true faith, purity of heart, reſignation to the will of GOD, that there is alwayes the benefit of cure in their corporall infirmityes, becauſe it is ever a ruled caſe: That our heavenly Father knowes what we have need of, &amp; what is beſt for us: many moe being driven by adverſity to ſeeke out their ſalvation, then by proſperity: thoſe who have but one eye, one foot, one hand, entring into Heaven, when others who have two eyes, feet, hands, are caſt into hell fire. Mark. 9. And we know the Parable of the Sun &amp; the Wind. Albeit then we ſee twenty for one returning from ſuch places (where almighty GOD is pleaſed ſometimes to work miracles, in honor of thoſe who on earth were his faithfull &amp; true ſervants, &amp; now triumphant in Heaven) laboring ſtill of thoſe maladies, for which they ſought relief at the memories of Saints, It would be great preſumption &amp; temerity in us, to ſuſpect, much more to judge, that they were not prepared for ſo great a benefit. We know what Apology our Saviour made in the caſe of the man blinde from his nativity.
When as the Iewes demanded of him, Quis peccavit, hic, aut parentes ejus, ut coecus naſeeretur? Iohn 9. Who was it that ſinned, he, or his parents, that he ſhould be borne blind: The anſwer was, Ne
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   hic peccavit, ne
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   parentes ejus, &amp;c. Neither hath this man ſinned, nor his parents, but that the workes of GOD might bee manifeſted in him. And by analogy the ſame may be applyed to our caſe.
            Beſides, it is not to bee doubted of, but many infirme &amp; diſeaſed people repaire to ſuch places, more for devotion &amp; ſpiritual comfort, then for any deſire, or expectatiō of their bodily health. Non ut benè ſit pedi, aut lateri, ſed ut benè ſit anima: not ſo tender of the well-fare of their corruptible bodies, as of that immortall part, which is, and ought to be moſt deare unto them. And ſo much (my friend) to anſwere your difficulty, why ſo many returne from pilgrimages without reparation of their health.
            The laſt knot to be untyed in this Argument, (&amp; rather inſinuated by you, then clearely propounded) is this. How is it to be beleeved ſay ſome? That ſo many ſignes and works ſurpaſſing all power of Nature, which we call miracles, ſhould be wrought at the memory and monuments of Saints, rather then in other places. The omnipotencie of GOD (the Author both of Nature, Grace, and all miraculous workes) being one and the ſame in all places and times.
            To as many as urge this reaſon, and thinke it worthy to be inſiſted upon. I might ſay as our Saviour ſaid unto the Sadducees, Math. 23. Erratis neſcientes ſcripturas, &amp; virtutem Dei: You erre, not knowing the Scriptures, or the power of GOD. Our bleſſed Saviour tells us, Luke 4.
Quòd multa erans vidua, &amp;c. That there were many Widowes in the dayes of Elias in Iſrael, when as the Heavens were ſhut for 3. yeares and ſix moneths, in which time there was a great famine thorough the whole earth, and unto none of thoſe was Elias ſent, but in Sarepta of Sidonia, unto one Woman a Widow. And there were many Lepers in Iſrael, in the dayes of Elizeus the Prophet, and none of them was cleanſed, but Naaman the Syrian. Now what was the cauſe why no other Widow was exempted from that famine, but only the Widow of Sarepta? Becauſe (notwithſtanding the preſence of GOD in all places) there wanted alſo the preſence of the Prophet Elias. And why were not the reſt of the Lopers clennſed, but onely Naaman the Syrian? wanted there the power of GOD, or due preparation in the Subject: Who can ſay ſo? No, but the preſence of the Prophet Elizeus. By which we ſee the circumſtance of perſonall preſence, though not neceſſary unto the power, yet many times required unto the will of the worker of ſignes and wonders. And albeit our Saviour in the Goſpell, ſometimes did cure the abſent, to givers to underſtand, that his power was not reſtrayned to preſence, yet commonly, and ſo the moſt part, hee cured none but the preſent: and ſo the people did underſtand, both by laying his hands upon them in the Cure: As when by reaſon of the preſſe of people, they uncovered the roofe of the houſe, Mar. 2. to let downe the Paralinique in his bed before him. So the Prophet Elias raiſed not the Widowes ſon to life, before him ſelfe came unto him. And our Saviour went unto the grave of Lazarus before he revived him. He took the Governors Daughter by the hand, Math. 9. as alſo in Naum he touched the
Coffin of the dead, before he rayſed them to life.
            And no leſſe alſo doe we behold a preſence required even in thoſe liveleſſe inſtruments, which it pleaſeth the divine Wiſdome to uſe in this kind. So the bones of the Prophet Elizeus, quickned the dead Corps throwne into his grave, by a Phyſicall touch or contact. The waters of Iordan in like manner, the leproſie. The Hemoriſsa (being ſo many yeares diſeaſed) found no cure, till ſhe touched the hemme of our Saviours garment. The waters of the pond in Hieruſalem, Iohn 5. did not heale before they were touched. S. Peters ſhadow, healed none but ſuch as it paſſed over. And the Napkins &amp; Handkerchiefes which were ſent from the Body of S. Paul, being applyed, did not onely cure diſeaſes, but caſt out devils Acts 19. By which, &amp; many other examples (which for brevity I omit) it may appeare, that either Preſence, Application, or Phyſical contact in moſt miracles, have beene required as a condition to the effecting of them. That we may the leſſe marvaile, if preſent at the Reliques and monuments of Saints, we receive thoſe helps both ſpirituall and temporall, which being abſent, wee might miſſe of.
            And ſo I conclude this Chap. of Pilgrimages, my ſelfe unfit for thoſe ttavells, to which ſome againſt my will, moſt willingly would compell me. And now our artificial ſtarres being ready to ſet, &amp; to deſcend below their Horizons. It is time to end that diſcourſe, to which your attention hath thus farre drawne me. And ſo wiſhing all well-fare &amp; happines to the whole Company, I bid you all good-night: reſolving my ſelfe to ſleepe, till ſome other occaſion ſhall awake mee.
            FINIS.
