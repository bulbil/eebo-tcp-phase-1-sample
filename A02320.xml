            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE WILLIAM Lord CRAVEN, Baron of Hamſted-Marſhall, &amp;c.
            
               My LORD,
            
            
               NOt to know your Lordſhip, is an ignorance next Barbariſine, but to be knowne vnto you, is an honour my ambition hath alwayes aymed at, but which my want of merit, or euill fortune, neuer yet attained. In making this tender of my trueſt ſeruice, I offer you the Votes of all (who not poyſoned by that Viper Enuie) iuſtly extoll courage in youth, not forced to action, but by the only ſpurre of glory. The vniuerſall world (among the wonders of our age) numbers you: and our world hauing

the happineſſe to boaſt her ſelfe your mother, cheriſheth you, as a man ſhee hath long time laboured to produce. This Preſent is but a Tranſlation; which yet may (happily) as well for the generall benefit, as particular choice, bee equall to an originall, you can beſt iudge: I haue therefore in part, vindicated my ſelfe from thoſe who may accuſeme of not knowledge, or negligence. I ſubmit all to your cenſure; and with this ſmall teſtimony of my deuotion to true Nobility, doe here ſue to haue theſe firſt fruits of my labours, placed vnder the protection of ſo Honourable a Patron; whoſe vertues, as they are worthy to bee admired by all, ſo ſhall they, together with this ſo noble a fauour, bee euer duely acknowledged by
            
               My Lord,
                Your humbleſt ſeruant,William Tirwhyt.
            
         
         
            
            To the Lord CARDINALL of Richelieu.
            
            
               MY LORD,
            
            
               
                  I
                Here preſent you Mounſieur Balzac's Letters, which may well bee tearmed new ones, euen after the eighth Edition; for though they haue long ſince beene in poſſeſsion of publike fauour, yet may I iuſtly ſay, this is the firſt time their Authour hath auouched them. The aduantagious iudgement you haue deliuered of him, and the ardor wherewith all France hath followed your approbation, well deſerueth his beſt endeauours toward the perfectionating ſo excellent things: I haue beene ſolicitous to draw him to this labour, to the end the world might know, that if I bee not worthy the ſhare I haue in his reſpects, yet that I haue at leaſt beene wiſe enough to make right vſe of my good fortune, and to cauſe it to become ſeruiceable to the glory of my Countrey. But truely, were hee maſter of his body, or did his maladies afford him liberty of ſpirit, hee would not ſuffer any but himſelfe to ſpeake in this cauſe; and

his Pen performing no ſlight acts, would haue conſecrated his owne labours, and the wonders they haue produced. But ſince euills haue no prefixed time of durance, and in that all the good interims which hereafter may befall him, are wholly to be imployed in his Booke, The Prince; I eſteemed it to ſmall purpoſe to attend his health in this buſineſſe, and that it was now no longer any time to deferre the purging of theſe curious Letters, from ſuch blemiſhes as ill impreſsions had left▪ vpon them. They ſhall therefore now appeare in the parity wherein they were conceiued, and with all their naturall ornaments: Beſides, I haue added diuers letters of his, not as yet come to light, which may ſerue as a ſubiect of greater ſatisfaction to all men, and bee as a recompenſe of the honour wherewith he hath collected the former. And truly (my Lord) had it beene poſsible to place in the Frontiſpiece of this Booke, a more illuſtrious name then yours, or ſhould Mounſieur de Balzac's incſination▪ and mine haue beene farre from any ſuch intention, yet would not the order of things, or the law of decency haue permitted any other reflection, then what I now make: I ſpeake not at this preſent, of that dazeling greatneſſe whereunto you are eleuated, nor of that ſo rare and neceſſary vertue, which rightly to recognize, the greateſt King on earth hath eſteemed himſelfe not to bee ouer able. I will onely ſay, I had reaſon to ſubmit an eloquence produced in the ſhade, and formed in ſolitarineſſe, to this other eloquence quickned both with voyce and action, cauſing you to reigne in ſoueraignety at all aſſemblies. Certainely (my Lord) you are more powerfull by this incomparable quality, then by the authority wherein the King hath

placed you: The onely accent of your voyce hath a hidden property, to charme all ſuch as hearken vnto you; none can bee poſſeſſed with any ſo willfull paſsions, who will not be appeaſed by the reaſons you propound; and after you haue ſpoken, you will at all times remaine maſter of that part of man, no way ſubiect to the worlds order, and which hath not any dependency vpon lawfull power, or tyrannicall vſurpation. This is a trueth (my Lord) as well knowne as your name, and which you ſo ſolidly confirmed at the laſt aſſembly of the Notables; as that in the great diuerſity of humours and iudgements, whereof it was compoſed, there was peraduenture this onely point well reſolued on, That you are the moſt eloquent man liuing. This being true, I can no way doubt, but the peruſall of this Booke I offer vnto you, will extraordinarily content you, and that you will bee well pleaſed to retire thither, ſometimes to recreate your ſpirits after agitation, and to ſuſpend thoſe great thoughts, who haue for their obiect the good of all Europe. It is a Booke (my Lord) wherein you ſhall find no common thing but the Title; (where entertaining ſome particular perſon) Mounſieur de Balzac reades Leſſons to all men; and where amidſt the beauty of Complements and dexterity of Ieaſting, he often teacheth of the moſt ſublime points of Philoſophy: I meane not that wrangling part thereof which reiecteth neceſſary verities, to ſeeke after vnprofitable ones, which cannot exerciſe the vnder ſtanding without prouoking paſsions, nor ſpeake of moderation without diſtemper, and putting the ſoule into diſorder: But of that, whereby Pericles heretofore made himſelfe maſter of Athens, and wherewith Epaminondas raiſed

himſelfe to the prime place of Greece: which tempereth the manners of particulars, regulateth the obligation of Princes, and neceſſarily bringeth with it the felicity of all States where they command. This booke will make it apparent euen to your enemies, that your life hath beene at all times equally admirable, though not alwayes alike glorious: How you haue conſerued the opinion of your vertue, euen in the time of your hardeſt fortunes, and how in the greateſt fury of the tempeſt, and in the moſt extreame violence of your affaires, the integrity of your actions hath neuer beene reduced to the onely teſtimony of your conſcience. To conclude, It is in this Booke (my Lord) where I ſuppoſe you will bee well pleaſed to reade the preſages of your preſent greatneſſe, and what hath beene foretold; not by Aſtrologicall rules, or the aſpect of ſome Conſtellation, but by a true diſcourſe founded vpon the maximes of reaſon, and experience of things paſt; cauſing him to preſume, that God hath not conferred ſuch extraordinary endowments vpon you, to be for euer encloiſtered within your ſelfe: And that he hath loued France better, then to depriue her of the good you ought to procure her. But all theſe verities ſhall one day be compriſed in that worke the King, by your mouth, (my Lord) hath commanded Mounſieur de Balzac to vndertake, and which one yeere of leiſure will effect. There ſhall it be, where he will cauſe all men to confeſſe, that to haue the pourtraict of a perfect Prince, the reigne of ſo great a Monarch as ours▪ is to bee attended; that the Diuine Prouidence neuer ſhewed it ſelfe more apparantly, then in the conduct of his deſignes, and in the euent of his enterpriſes; and how Heauen hath ſo farre

declared it ſelfe in his fauour, that were his ſtate aſſaulted on all ſides, and all ordinary meanes of defence ſhould faile him; he hath vertue ſufficient to ſaue himſelfe, and performe miracles. Now as you are the prime intelligence of his Councill, and your cogitations the firſt cauſes of the good reſolutions therein taken, you are not to doubt (my Lord) but you likewiſe poſſeſſe the principall place therein, after His Maieſtie; and that you participate more then any other of His triumphs. There ſhall you be reuenged of all thoſe wretched writings you haue formerly ſlighted: There the ſpirits of all men ſhall bee ſatisfied in the iuſtice of your deportments, and calumny it ſelfe will there bee ſo powerfully conuinced, that to cry downe ſo legall a gouernement as yours, ill affected French-men, and thoſe ſtrangers enemies to this Crowne, will finde no further pretext in affaires, nor credulity among men. And truely, when I (on the one ſide) conſider how fat all it is to thoſe who gouerne, to be expoſed to the enuy of great ones, and complaints of meaner perſons, and how Publike affaires haue this fatality, as how pure ſoeuer the adminiſtration thereof be, they ſtill afford ſufficient colour to calumny, to diſguiſe them and cauſe them to appeare iniuſt. And on the other ſide, when I conſider that to guide this State is no leſſe then to manage a body hauing no one ſound part; and how there is no ſicke perſon who doeth not ſometimes murmure againſt his Phiſitian; I dare bee confident (my Lord) that ſuch a man as Mounſieur de Balzac will not prooue vnuſefull vnto you, and that the luſtre of your actions, and glory of your life ſhall receiue no diminution in his hands. I would ſay more, did I not

feare to diſoblige him in commending him, or if I beleeued him to be ſo great a ſelfe admirer as his enemies figure him vnto vs. But I who haue ſufficiently ſtudied him to know him▪ and who am acquainted with his most ſecret Inclinations, and the moſt particular conception▪s he hath in his ſoule, and of a farre different opinion to theirs. I will therefore reſt there (my Lord) and not to cauſe you to looſe more time, and to the end you may the ſooner inioy the entertainement, this excellent Booke prepareth for you: I will ſatisfie my ſelfe in letting you know, that I eſteeme not my ſelfe ſo vnfortunate as formerly I did, ſince I haue happened vpon ſo faire an occaſion, to let you know that I am,
            
               My Lord,
                Your thriſe humble, and moſt obedient ſeruant, Silbon.
            
         
         
            
            THE PREFACE Vpon the Letters of Mounſieur de BALZAC: By Mounſieur de la Motte Aigron.
            
               I Doubt not, but among thoſe who ſhall ſee theſe Works; ſome there are who will eſteeme them worthy a more aduantagious Title then that of Letters, as well in regard of the greatneſſe of thoſe things therein frequently handled, as in reſpect of the exactneſſe wherewherewith they ſeeme to haue beene compoſed: Butas I willingly excuſe thoſe, who with vnapt complements imagine they haue compoſed a good Letter; nor doe any more blame ſuch as there in neuer digreſſe from their perticular affaires, 
                  •
               o muſt I likewiſe acknowledge, that ſuch writings as theſe, hauidg not beene made with any intention to bee put in Print, the World might well haue paſſed

without them: And that it is only allowed to the Germans to giue account to the age they liue in, and to poſteritie forſooth, concerning the affaires and fortunes of their particular families, and of the ſilly acts of their Colleagues. Truely it is an errour to beleeue, that graue and ſolemne ſubiects are to bee baniſhed out of all Letters, or that euen eloquence ought but ſlackly therein to appeare; and that the Maieſtie of both theſe is only reſerued for Pulpits and Panegyrick Orations; as though valour neuer appeared ſaue onely in pitcht Battells; and that in ſingle Combats it were lawfull to run away, or that vertue therein were vtterly vnuſefull, becauſe it hath fewer witneſſes, neither is ſo fully regarded: But beſides that, wee are no longer in thoſe times wherein the State gouernment was publiquely queſtioned, where the Oratours forced the Lieutenants generall of armies to render accompt of their ſeuerall charges, and that conſequently, there is no more any meanes remaining to become eloquent in that kind: Yet are there reaſons, whereby w̄ee may vnderſtand the merit of Letters to bee of no leſſe regard then that of Orations. Howbeit, if there bee any neceſſitie to find ſome difference betweene theſe; this at leaſt can neither be in regard of the dignitie of the Subiects, the force of Reaſons, the gracefullneſſe of Diſcourſes, nor in the ſublimitie of Conceits. To ſpeake trueth, when I conſider the Orations yet remaining among the ruines of former ages, ſome where of were publikely pronounced, others onely penned; I am ſo farre from admiring

any aduantage they haue ouer thoſe Letters now extant among vs, both of the ſame Authors and Ages, as I doe not ſo much as wonder at all, how the firſt hauing beene armed with diſcourſe and voice, together with the geſture and motion of the body, haue produced ſuch prodigious effects as wee all know, and haue ſo often, as it were by maine force, extorted the conſents of all hearers; yet the ſecond, though they had not the like arms and allurements, haue notwithſtanding not beene any way 
                  •••
               icient. Thoſe ſmooth Exordiums whereby they prepare, and put themſelues by eaſie acceſſes, as it were into poſſeſſion of the Readers, thoſe ſtraites and paſſages whereby they conduct the ſpirits of men from pleaſant to painefull, and from grieuous, to gracious obiects, to the end, that hauing in a maner ſhaken and caſt them out of their former ſtations, they may afterwards force them to fall on what ſide they pleaſe. Surely all theſe aduantages are ſo peculiar to Orations, as I ingeniouſly confeſſe, Letters doe not ſo much as know what they meane. In theſe, we enter at the firſt daſh vpon the matter, nor doe wee ſcarſe at any time, quit the ſame; the reaſons goe altogether alone without aſſiſtance, and all the ornament allowed them, is onely freedome of conceptions, the fecunditie of language, and that they paſſe not promiſcuouſly. But as concerning the Subiects, they are common to both kinds of writings, and it is an errour to imagine, there are ſome ſo particular to the one, that the other cannot touch vpon the ſame withont iniurie thereunto. Vpon the

matter, Panegyrick diſcourſes, Apologies, Confultations, Iudgements vpon morall actions, whether good or bad opinions and cenſures vpon occurrents, of thoſe which pleaſe, and thoſe wee ought to deteſt, yea euen indifferent accidents▪ briefely whatſoeuer may fall into diſcourſe, and vnder reaſon, are the obiects of Letters: So wee ſee, the greateſt and moſt important miſteries of our religion haue been left vnto vs in Letters. All the wiſedome of the Pagan
                     •
                  
                contained in thoſe of Seneca, and wee owe to thoſe Cicero wrot to his friends, the knowledge of the ſecrets, and certaine inducements which cauſed the greateſt reuolutions the world hath euer known, to witt the ſhaking and ſubuerſion of the Romane Reipublike, wee are therefore to confeſſe Oratoricall Treatiſes to haue no other ſubiect then Letters; and that if there bee any difference, it is none other then what is obſerued betweene our ancient Seas, and thoſe not diſcouered vnto vs till in our fathers times. The latter are no leſſe deepe then the other, they are capable of the like ſhipping; their ebbes, and floods are neither more iuſt, nor leſſe vncertaine; and all the difference diſcouered betweene them is onely this, that the windes toſſe not thoſe in like fort as it doth ours, and in that they are ſeldome or neuer ſubiect either to ſtormes, or tempeſts. In like manner it being within the power and capacitie of Letters to treate of the ſame things, how much more emenent and excellent ſoeuer one may conceiue them to be then any other kind of writings, yet doe they not indeede receiue thoſe extraordinary

motions which appeare in Orations, ſince neither the like high of exceſſe, nor the ſame Enthuſiaſmes or Raptures are herein found; In a word, it is a more middle beauty, and a more calme eloquence. And ſurely, if the ſubiect wee make vſe of be as illuſtrious as the perſon before whom wee are to handle it, were it not as much as to abuſe both the one and the other, to come ſhort in our expreſſions: Since the action ought neither to be publique, nor generall, if you intend to performe it negligently, and not to allow it all the ornaments whereof it is capable. And who can doubt that Cicero being to make an Oration before Caeſar, after the change of the Common-wealth, had not a greater apprehenſion, and prepared not himſelfe with more ſtudious care, then if he had onely ſpoken to that beaſt with an hundred heads, hee had ſo often led after his owne Phantaſie, and whereof hee was in ſo full poſſeſſion ſo long before, as to cauſe them to take the part beſt pleaſing vnto him. In theſe laſt occaſions, and in the preſence of this man alone, he know with whom he had to doe: Now had he beene timerous, or fearefull to faile before his Maſter, yet impute not this apprehenſion of his to proceede either out of conſideration hee had of his greatneſſe, nor from the reflection vpon thoſe things hee came to accompliſh: But it was in that he conſidered him as a man no leſſe verſed in the art of well-ſpeaking then himſelfe, and who had heretofore contributed to the ſtudy of this ſcience, ſo many rare gifts of ſpirit, and ſo many faire indowments of nature,

that had he not afterward eſteemed it more noble to conquer men by armes, then to conuince them by arguments, and if of the two moſt excellent exerciſes of this life, his fortune and the famouſneſſe of his courage, had not cauſed him to make choyce of the former, hee might eaſily haue diſputed for the glory of the latter with him. Or were it ſo that this excellent Oratour might at this day returne into the world, and were perſonally, or by his Penne to diſcourſe with thoſe two great Cardinalls to whom the moſt part of theſe Letters are addreſt▪ is it not probable, comming to know them as wee doe, that he would imploy, and contribute a a more exact ſtudy and ſolicitude, then when hee was onely to pleaſe a multitude of ignorant Plebeians, and to ſpeake to all that rable of ancient Rome. Wee ſhall yet againe bee amazed at the perfection of theſe Letters, ſome whereof are written to the King, and appointed to bee read (as in trueth they were) with admiration in full counſell, and a great part of the reſt addreſſed to the moſt eminent perſons of our age. To ſpeake trueth wee may iuſtly ſay, this is the firſt time any thing of perfection hath appeared in our language; ſo that if of all our ancient eloquence there bee ought worthy of eſteeme in any equalitie with this, it may bee that with much labour you ſhall produce ſome one Letter: For of all ſuch who haue hitherto written wee may affirme, that the moſt fortunate among them, when they made choyce of ſubiects able to ſubſiſt of themſelues, haue not beene abſolutely condemnable,

and that amidſt their writings, the ſoliditie of learning, and the ſauageneſſe of language (to wit) the good and euill did equally appeare. But when at any time they fell vpon ſubiects where eloquence onely ſwayed the Scepter, there truly it was where fortune forſooke them, and where the feebleneſſe of their proper forces was manifeſtly perceiued, if they were not ſome way aſſiſted by ſtrange tongues. Some of them (to ſay the trueth) haue doubted what way they were to take, and haue ſtriuen to ſhew it to others, though themſelues were not in it. In a word, the greateſt glory thoſe gained who haue written with moſt perfection and puritie, is only that which nature hath reſerued for women, to which ſex eminent actions being denied, it ſeemeth they performe ſufficient if they abſtaine from euill doing. But to ſay that any hath ioyned Art to aboundance, and mingled mildneſſe with Maieſtie, or hath raiſed his ſtile without either looſing himſelfe, or ſtraying from his ſubiect, that is it which in trueth we could not ſee till this preſent. And queſtionleſſe theſe braue and generous formes of diſcourſe, and thoſe great and ſtrange conceptions wherewith theſe Letters are ſo curiouſly limed, and ſo plentifully grac'd, haue beene very ſlenderlie known in proceeding ages: This very order, and this number, whereof euery tongue is not capable, and wherein ours owes nothing to the Latine, and which appeares in all his words, though diuerſely, and as their gender requires, do right haply appeare in this place, though the moſt part of writers before him

haue eſteemed theſe perfections of ſmall importance; yet notwithſtanding, without the helpe of theſe two great ſecrets, neither ornaments of Art, nor graces of Nature, can bee but in part pleaſing; nor can all the reaſons the World can alledge perſwade a Very woman reſoluing to reſiſt: And to ſpeake ſeriouſly, they are no leſſe neceſſary among excellent diſcourſes, and conceits, then diſcipline amongſt Souldiers, without which, courage is of no effect, and valour moſt cōmonly proueth vnprofitable. As for me who haue knowne the Author from both our infancies, and who better then all others, can depoſe in what faſhion he effecteth his labours; beſides, knowing the great aduantage hee hath ouer all thoſe who write at this day: I haue euer thought, that if any were able to raiſe our Language to the merit and reputation of ſuch Eloquence, wherewith the Ancients were adorned, it ſhould bee to him alone to whom our age oweth this glorie. Nor doe I doubt, but the compariſon comming in queſtion at this preſent, betweene theſe his writings, and thoſe of others; the difference will bee eaſily diſcouered, aſſuring my ſelfe, that all ſpirits will diſpoſe themſelues to be ranged herein to mine opinion, and voluntarily to giue way thereunto. As for my ſelfe, who read the Ancients with all reſpect due vnto them, and the Moderns without any preiudicate opinion, doe notwithſtanding confeſſe, that all I can conceiue in others is ſo farre ſhort of the merit of theſe Letters, that abſtracting from the paſſion I am poſſeſſed with, both for them, and their

Authour, hardly could I diſpoſe my ſelfe to frame this Preface for them. And who is there will make any difficultie to giue them their due? Since hee whoſe very faults haue beene eſteemed ſo faire, that they cauſed a Sect during his life, which yet continues after his death; hauing (at Meats) ſeene certaine diſcourſes this Author compoſed in thoſe miſerable times, and which ſtood in need of another age to be gratefully regarded, was aſtoniſhed at his beginnings, confeſſing it was with vnwillingneſſe, that the onely thing hee ſuppoſed to poſſeſſe by the generall conſent of all, was rauiſhed from him by one who as yet had liued but twenty yeeres. But ſurely, it was in this ſtraine of writing which in that it is not reſtrayned within ſo ſtrict limits as that of Letters, is capable of all the motions, and ornaments of Art; and of the ſame ſort as was the other diſcourſe he addreſſeth to the Pope who now is, vpon the like ſubiect, as that of Saint Bernards to Eugenius: And as God neuer choſe among men any ſo accompliſhed with all perfections, as this perſon to command all others, ſo can I not conceiue any thing either more great, or extraordinary, then what appeareth in this worke, nor more ſutable to the excellencie of the ſubiect, and to the Maieſtie of him to whom he dedicated his diſcourſe: But if (to returne to the particulars of theſe Letters) it were neceſſary for the deliuering an vnpartiall iudgment, to conſider thoſe of the Ancients, I ſhould ſeeme more reſpectfull then were requiſite, if (putting them all together) I ſhould vndertake to make

them ſo much as enter into compariſon with theſe; excepting onely thoſe of Seneca, yea euen in thoſe (which in trueth come not nere theſe) there is ſo infinite abundance of matter as can hardly bee imagined, and ſince all things therein appeare ſo confuſedly, that it ſeemes they were therein couched without choice, and to ſay trueth, as itwere at aduenture, ſome who will yet further tax his ſtile will happily ſay, they are rather matters then Workes. But for my part, if there bee any defects therein, I hold they ought well to be borne with, in regard of ſo many rarities therein concurring; and when wee haue ſaid all, what appearance is there to vnderualew any thing we receiue from a man who was worth ſeuen Millions of Gold? And who once in his life had the heart, and ambition to aſpire to the Empire of the whole world? Let vs therefore eſteeme all wee receiue from him, and from thoſe times, yet ſuffer vs to commend our owne, wherein this ſcience which medleth with the commanding of ſpirits, and which was but formerly in it's infancy, is now found to be in his full maturitie, and as it were of ripe yeeres. If therefore you acknowledge any obligation due (as in trueth there is) to theſe excellent Letters, you ſhall in ſhort time ſee ſo ſolid, and iuſt a iudgment proceed from this Author, that the Parliament it ſelfe produceth not any more able; and his ſolitarines will be ſo ſatisfactorie vnto you, that you will make no more difference then I do, to prefer the fame before the magnificence of Princely Courts, and the Pompe of moſt ſtatelyeſt Cities.
         
         
            
            THE TRANSLATOR To the Reader.
            
               ABout fiue yeeres ſince, I chanced to peruſe Mounſieur Balzac's Letters (they being then as I ſuppoſe) but lately come forth in French▪
                and as it ſhould ſeeme without the Authours approbation: For of eight Editions in ſeuerall places, ſince publiſhed, this onely being the laſt, I was by him auowed. Hauing therefore ſeene this Coppy, was ſo farre from ſuppoſing it vnworthy the reading, as (on the contrary) finding his stile right eloquent, and altogether vnafected, his conceptions high, and the whole Booke richly adorned with great varietie of learning, appearing almoſt in euery Page: It raiſed no ſmall deſire in mee to try how his way of writing would ſute with our language: I thought therefore good (as my occaſions would permit, now and then for my priuate recreation) to tranſlate certaine of his Letters, without any the leaſt intention

to put them all into Engliſh, much leſſe to publiſh them: But hauing once begun, I found my ſelfe ſo taken with the freeedome of his diſcourſe, together with the facillitie of his expreſsions; and ſo ſurunded with the torrent of his witt, that though I had ſmall hopes of wading ſafely through, notwithſtanding it ſeemed euen delightfull vnto mee to bee drenched in ſo rich ſo pleaſing, and ſo plentifull a flood, yet after diuers attempts, I at laſt arriued on drie land, reſoluing to reſt my ſelfe after theſe labours, and in priuate to inioy the content I tooke in hearing Mounſieur Balzac ſpeake, though but broken Engliſh. But I was not long left in peace with this reſolution, before certaine my noble friends vnderſtanding I had traualled on this ſubiect; did importunately ſolicite me to put theſe Letters into Print, perſwading me I ſhould here in performe no vnacceptable ſeruice to my Countrey, eſpecially to ſuch who are vnacquainted with the French Language. Their power therefore ouer-ruling my baſhfullneſſe, though otherwiſe ſeconding my willing deſire to bee vſefull; I held it leſſe faultie to incur the hazard of publike cenſure, then to bee taxed of wilfull inciuillitie. So as (worthy Reader) I haue here expoſed them to thy view; If the courſneſſe of the Engliſh habit wherein I haue clad them, ſeeme vnſutable to their French attyre, or vnfaſhionable in thy ſight: Conſider I beſeech thee, that beautifull creatures are not altogether blemiſhed, though but plainely attyred. If therefore you pleaſe ſo farre to fauour mee, as to excuſe theſe my errours, I will herafter endeauour to become more ſeruiceable. You will happily not here find all Balzac's Letters Engliſhed; yea and diuers clauſes left out; the

onely reaſon hath beene, their ſubiect not altogether ſutable to this State, nor very fitting for Engliſh eares. The reſt are here preſented to thy gratious accetpance, not doubting but they will prooue both pleaſing and profitable to diuers who endeauour to make right vſe thereof. My deſires haue aimed at that end; and my greateſt ambition is to haue them find courteous entertainement, and to afford Publique Vtillitie.

            THE FIRST BOOKE.
            
               A Letter from the Cardinall of Richelieu, to the Signior of BALZAC▪
                  
               
               LETTER I.
               
                  SIR:
               
               
                  THough I haue formerly deliuered my Opinion to a friend of Yours; concerning ſome of your letters he ſhewed me; yet can I not ſatisfie my ſelfe

before theſe Lines affoord you a more Authenticall approbation thereof. It is not any particular affection I beare to your perſon, which imſiteth me to this allowance, but Truth it ſelfe, carrying with it ſuch a Prerogatiue, that it compelleth (all who haue their Eyes, and Spirits rightly placed for the deliuering an vnpartiall opinion) to repreſent them without Diſguiſe: My cenſure ſhall be ſeconded by many others, and if there be any of a contrary conceite, I dare aſſure you, time will make them know, that the defects they finde in your Letters, proceede rather from their Spirits, then from your Pen; and how nearely they reſemble the Icterickes, who hauing the Iaundeſſe in their Eyes, ſee nothing which ſeemeth not vnto them to carry the ſame colour: Heretofore meane Wits admired all things aboue the pitch of their capacity; but now, their Iudgements ſeconding their Sufficiencies, they approoue nothing but what is within the compaſſe of their Talent, and blame all whatſoeuer exceedeth

their Studies. I dare (without preſumption) ſay in what concerneth you herein, that I ſee things as they are, and declare them to be ſuch as I ſee them: The conceptions of your Letters are ſtrong, and as tranſcendent aboue ordinary imaginations, as they are conformable to the common ſenſe of ſuch who are of ſound iudgement. The Language is pure, and the Words perfectly well choſen, without affectation; the Senſe is cleare and neate, and the Periods accompliſhed with all their nū
                  bers. This cenſure of mine, is by ſo much the more ingenuous, as that approouing whatſoeuer is your owne in your Letters: I haue not concealed to a certay ne Friend of yours, that I found ſome rectification to be deſired, concerning certaine things you inſert of other mens: fearing leaſt the liberty of your Pen ſhould cauſe many to imagine that it is to often dipped in their humours and manners; and draw ſuch as are more acquainted with you by name, then Conuerſation, to be otherwiſe conceited

of you, then you willingly could wiſh. The manner wherewith you haue receiued this my Aduiſe, cauſeth me that continuing my former freedome, I will conclude, in aduertizing you, that you ſhall be anſwerable before God, if you ſuffer your Pen to ſleepe, and that you are obliged to imploy it vpon more graue and important Subiects; being contented that you ſhall blame me, if in ſo doing you receiue not the ſatisfaction, to ſee that what you performe herein, ſhall be prayſed and eſteemed, euen by thoſe wh would willingly picke occaſion to controule them, which is one of the moſt ſure markes of the perfection of any Worke. You ſhall receiue ſome in this kind out of my Affection, when I may haue the opportunity to aſſure you, that I am,
               
                  Your well affectionate to ſerue you, the Cardinall of Richelieu.
                  
                  
                     From Paris

               To the Lord Cardinall of Richelieu from BALZAC.
               LETTER. II.
               
                  MY LORD:
               
               I Am as proud of the Letter you did me the Honour to addreſſe vnto me, as if there were a thouſand Statues erected for me, or if I were aſſured by infallible authority of my works excellency. Truly, to be commended by that man our Age oppoſeth to all antiquity, and vpon whoſe Wiſedome God might well intruſt the whole earths gouernment, is a fauour I could not wiſh for without preſumption, and which I am yet doubtfull whether I haue really receiued, or onely dreamed ſomeſuch matter. But if it be ſo that my eyes haue not deceiued me, and that you are hee who hath beſtowed that voyce vpon me, which hath bin choſen by all France to preſent her petitions to the King, and by the King himſelfe

to conuey his Commands into Citties, and Armies: My Lord, I muſt humbly then acknowledge you haue already payed me before hand, for all the ſeruices I can euer poſſibly performe vnto you: and I ſhould ſhew my ſelfe very vngratefull, if I ſhould hereafter complayne of my fortunes: ſince vpon the matter, the goods and honours of this World are moſt ordinarily none other then the inheritance of Sotts, or rewards of Vice, Eſtimation and Commendation being onely reſerued for Vertue. Ought I not then to reſt highly ſatisfied, hauing receiued from your Mouth the ſame Prize which Conquerors expect for their Victories? yea, all that your ſelfe could hope for, in lieu of your great and immortall Actions, if there were another Cardinall of Richelieu to giue them their due Commendations? But truely (my Lord) that is a thing which will alwayes be wanting to your Glory; for when by your onely Preſence you haue appeaſed the ſpirits of

an incenſed Multitude; when by your powerfull Reaſons you haue induced Chriſtian Princes to ſet the Natiue Countrey of Jeſus Chriſt at liberty, and to vndertake the Holy Warre, when you haue gayned whole Nations to the Church, as well by the force of your Example, as by that of your Doctrine, who is of ability to pay you the Reputation which you in all right deſerue? and where ſhall you finde ſo excellent a Witneſſe for all the marueilous Acts of your Life, as I haue of my Watchings and Studies? I cannot chuſe but reiterate this, and my ioy is ouer iuſt to be concealed. Is it poſſible this great Wit and high ſpirit, which hath bin imployed euen from his firſt Youth in perſwading Princes, in giuing inſtructions to Embaſſadours, and hath beene liſtned vnto by old men, who haue ſeene foure Reignes? Is it poſſible I ſay, this man ſhould valew me; on whoſe Approbation all enemies agree? nor is there among all men a contrary party, or diuerſity

of beleefe in this poynt. If I had a purpoſe to diſquiet the repoſe of this Kingdome, I would ſeeke for the conſent of ſlacke ſpirits; and I ſhould ſtand in need of the fauour of all ſorts of men, were I to ſtudy for Reputation in a popular State: but truely I neuer affected confuſion, or diſorder, and my deſignes haue euer aimed at the pleaſing of a few. For ſince you haue declared your ſelfe in fauour, as hee likewiſe hath done, for whom France at this day enuieth Italy: and ſince you carry after you the moſt ſolid part of the Court, I am content to let the reſt runne aſtray with Turkes and Infidels, who make the greater number of Mankinde. Yet (my Lord) I cannot thinke, that any hereafter will be ſo farre in loue with himſelfe, or ſo obſtinate in his owne opinion, as not to be a Convertite by the onely reading the Letter you honour'd me with, and who in concluſion will not ſubſcribe to your great Iudgement? And, if it be certayne

that truth it ſelfe could not be ſtrong enough againſt you, there is no queſtion but that ſide whereon you two ſhall agree, oughtto be vniuerſally followed. For my part (my Lord) let all men ſay what they will, I fixe my ſelfe with cloſed eyes there; and what enemies ſoeuer the reputation you haue allowed mee procure me: yet knowing your abilities and what you are, I will be no farther ſolicitus for mine owne Intereſt, or future benefit, ſince it is become your cauſe;
               
                  I am My Lord, Your moſt humble and moſt obedient ſeruant, BALZAC. 
                  
                     The 10. of March, 1624.
                  
               
            
            
               
               To the Cardinall of Richelieu from BALZAC.
               
               LETTER III.
               
                  My Lord,
               
               I Humbly intreate you to be pleaſed by theſe preſents, to permit me to confirme vnto you the aſſurance of my moſt humble Seruice, and that you would allow mee to craue ſome Newes from you: It is the onely thing wherein I am now curious, and which in the very depth of my retiredneſſe, obligeth me to reflect ſometimes vpon worldly Affaires. But happen what can, I am moſt aſſured, you will remayne conſtant euen amidſt publique ruines, and that Fortune cannot bereaue you of thoſe aduantages ſhee neuer gaue you. Yet could I wiſh, that your life were ſomewhat more calme, and leſſe glorious: And that Artemiza's goodneſſe hauing

ſo great Affinity to what is infinite, and which is of power to procure loue euen amidſt the moſt ſauage beaſts; doth in right deſerue to obtaine truce, and repoſe among reaſonable Creatures. It is not in vs to be Authors of hereafter, nor doe our wiſhes rule the euent of humane Affaires. But ſurely if there be any Juſtice in Heauen, (whereof there is no doubt) and if God haue an Eye to worldly matters: wee muſt beleeue the teares of vpright perſons ſhal not be ſhed in vaine, or that your Queene ſhall waxe old in her Misfortunes: yet at the leaſt, ſince our cogitations be ſtill within our owne compaſſe, and we being not forbidden to hope well, let vs make the beſt vſe we may of this ſmall portion of Liberty yet remayning. The vertue ſhe hath hitherto made vſe of, in reſiſting her afflictions, will happily oneday ſerue to moderate her felicities. And if God ſtrooke a certayneMadam Gabriella.
                   Woman with ſuddaine death; for that ſhe ſhould haue beene ſeated in the place, hee

deſtinated to this great Princeſſe; he ſurely will not ſuffer that man to liue long, who hath ſo highly iniured her. Howſoeuer (my Lord) it is great Honour vnto you, not to haue fayled her in her afflictions, and to haue vnder-valewed all worldly Prerogatiues, to be vnfortunate with her. I know that herein you ſatisfie your ſelfe with the teſtimony of a cleare conſcience, and that it is not ſo much for Opinion of men, you vndertake Worthy actions, as for your owne priuate Satisfaction. Nor are you a little to comfort your ſelfe, in that at this preſent you are prayſed euen by your very enemies; and to ſee your Reſolutions redoubtable to thoſe who haue great Armies on foote, and the chiefe forces of the State vnder their Command. I would ſay more, did I not feare you might ſuppoſe, I had ſome priuate deſigne in my Diſcourſe, or ſeeke hereby to prepare you to receiue ſome kind of importunity from me: But I moſt humbly beſeech your Lordſhip to be confident, that I being of free Condition, am

little acquainted with Flattery; and that I am not ſo giuen ouer to gaine, but that notwithſtanding you were ſtill in Auignion, I would euer as really as at this Houre remayne
               
                  My Lord,

                   Your moſt humble and moſt affectionate Seruant, BALZAC. 
                  
                     The 15. of May, 1623.
                  
               
            
            
               To the Cardinall of Richelieu from BALZAC.
               
               LETTER IIII.
               
                  My Lord,
               
               VVEre I not well acquainted with my owne inſufficiency, I might well be poſſeſſed with no ſmall vanity, vpon the Letter you did mee the Honour to addreſſe vnto me, and might well imagine my ſelfe to be ſome other

thing then if I was the day before I receiued it. But knowing it is no other then a meere fauour you pleaſed to affoord me, I will not flatter my felfe in my good fortune, nor leſſen the Obligation due vnto you, in preſuming to merit the ſame. If Vertue required any Recompence out of her ſelfe, ſhe would not receiue it from other mouth then yours: and your Reputation is at this day ſo Iuſt and Generall, as it is become a 
                     Ʋerity wherein the Wiſe agree with the Vulgar. I doe therefore account my ſelfe very happy, to be reputed of, by a Perſon who is able to giue a value to things of themſelues worthleſſe; and I attribute ſo much to your Iudgement, that I will no longer hold any meane opinion of my ſelfe, leſt therein I ſhould contradict you. Truely (my Lord) very difficultly will my parts any way anſwere your Expectation. The time my Feauer affoordeth me for reſt is ſo ſhort, I can hardly imploy it to other purpoſe then to complaine of its cruelty. I haue enough to doe to liue, and to make

that good: I keepe my ſelfe as carefully as though I were compoſed of Chriſtall, or as if I were ſome neceſſary matter for the good of all men. Yet (my Lord) you haue ſo great power ouer me, that I will ftrayne my ſelfe to ſhew my Obedience, and to giue you an account of my leaſure, ſince you pleaſe to thinke I ought not to depriue the World thereof. It is better to vtter glorious Dreames, then to labour in groſſe Deſignes, and there are certayne Acts of the ſpirit ſo excellent, that Princes are too poore, and their power too ſlender to affoord them their full merit. But my Lord, you haue often giuen ſo great teſtimonies of me, that if I ſhould not haue ſome preſumption, it were fit I loſt my memory▪ Wherefore out of the aſſurance you giue me that my Stile doth not ſtray from that perfection which men imagine, but neuer ſaw, nor haue attayned vnto; I will enter vpon a deſigne which ſhall amaze our vulgar wits, and cauſe thoſe who haue hitherto ſuppoſed

they ſurmount others, to ſee I haue found what they ſeeke for. Whatſoeuer I doe, I will at leaſt haue you at all times preſent to my thoughts, thereby to oblige my ſelfe not to come ſhort before ſo great an example, nor will I forget the place where at this preſent I am, to the end not to omit any thing worthy the Ancient Rome. It is impoſſible at once to haue ſo glorious obiects, and degenerous thoughts, or not to be tranſported with all thoſe Tryumphs of times paſt, and with the glory of our Age. But this is not the place where I intend to ſpeake, it being of too ſmall extent to receiue ſo illimitable a Subiect: It ſhall therefore ſuffice in concluſion of this my Letter to tell you, that ſince vpon your aduice all poſterity dependeth, and the whole Court expecteth from you what they are, or are not to beleeue; I cannot chuſe (my Lord) but to eſteeme my ſelfe right happy euen amidſt my greateſt miſeries, if you ſtill continue vnto me your equall Iudgement with the honour of your fauours

               LETTER V.
               
                  My LORD;
               
               MY purpoſe was at my arriual in France to haue preſented my Seruice vnto you, in the place of your Reſidence, that I might haue had the honour to ſee you; but my health hauing not beene ſuch, as to affoord me the free diſpoſition of my ſelfe: I am forced to deferre my contentment, in that kinde, and to intreate to heare ſome Newes from You, till I be able to go to vnderſtand them from your Selfe. In the interim, the better to cheare my Spirits, I will beleeue they are as good as I wiſh them, and will imagine this Collicke of yours, whereof I had ſo great apprehenſion, ſhall be drowned in the fountaine of Pougues. This truly is ſo generally deſired, and ſought for at Gods hands,

by ſo many mouthes, that I am confident he will not (in this poynt) leaue the felicity He hath prepared for our times vnperfect; and that He loueth the World too well, to depriue it of the good you are to Performe. Armies being defeated, new Forces may be ſet on foot, and a ſecond Fleete may be rigged, after the firſt periſh: But if we ſhould want your Lordſhip, the World would not laſt long enough to be able to repayre ſuch a loſſe: And the King might haue juſt cauſe to bewayle the ſame in the midſt of his greateſt Tryumphes. He hath indeed an inexhauſtable Kingdome of men. The Warres do daily affoord him Captaines. The number of Iudges is not much inferiour to that of Criminals. It is only of wiſe men, and ſuch as are capable to guide the Sterne of States, whereof the ſcarcity is great; and without flattery to find out your Equall herein, all Nature had need put it ſelfe into Action, and that God long promiſe the ſame to mankinde before he be pleaſed to produce him. I ſay nothing,

(my Lord) I am not ready to ſweare in verification of my beleefe▪
                   or which I confirme not by the Teſtimony of your very Enemies. The authority of Kings is not ſo Soueraigne, as that is, you exerciſe ouer the Soules of ſuch as hearken vnto you. Your Spirit is right powerfull, and dayly imployed in great affaires, and which refreſheth it ſelfe in agitation of ordinary occurrents: You are deſtinated to fill the place of that Cardinall, which at this preſent, maketh one of the beautifull parties of Heauen, &amp; who hath hitherto had no Succeſſour, though he haue had Heires &amp; and Brothers. This being thus, who will doubt that publicke Prayers are to be offred, for ſo precious and neceſſary a health as yours; or that your life ought to be deare vnto you, within you are to conſerue the glory of our age. As for me (my Lord) who am aſſaulted on all ſides, and to whom nothing is remayning ſaue hope, being the only benefit of thoſe who are depriued of all others: ſince my miſfortune wil needs make me that publicke ſacrifice, which is, to be charged with

the paines of all the people, and pay for all the World. I could be well content you ſhould ſend me your Collicke, and that it come to accompany the Feauer, the Scyatica, and the Stone. Since of ſo many Diſeaſes, there can but one Death be compoſed. Nor is it time any longer, to be a good husband of what is already loſt. But I will not enter further into this diſcourſe, wherof I ſhal find no end; and it were to ſmall purpoſe to tell you, he is the moſt wretched man in the World, who ſo much honoureth you, for feare you ſhould reiect my affection, as ſomefatall thing, and leaſt it auayle me not at all to proteſt that I am my Lord
               
               
                  Your most hamble and moſt obedient Seruant; BALZAC. 
                  
                     
                        September the 4. 1622.
                  
               
            
            
               To the Lord Cardinall of Richelieu.
               
               LETTER. VI.
               
                  MY LORD:
               
               AFter the ſealing of theſe preſents, a meſſenger paſſed by this place, by whom I

vnderſtand that the Pope hath created you a Cardinall; I make no queſtion but you receiued this Newes as a matter indifferent vnto you: and that your Spirit being raiſed aboue the things of this world, you behold them with one and the ſame Aſpect. Yet ſince herein the publicke good meeteth with your particular intereſt, and that for your ſake the Church reioyceth euen in all the moſt irkeſome Priſons of Europe, it is not reaſonable you ſhould depriue your ſelfe of a contentment no leſſe chaſt, then thoſe Heauen it ſelfe affoordeth vs? and which proceedeth from the ſame cauſe. All good men (my Lord) ought in theſe times to deſire great Dignities, as neceſſary meanes to vndertake great matters. If they doe otherwiſe; beſides that God will demand a ſtrict account from them of thoſe his graces, whereof they haue made no good vſe: the World hath likewiſe iuſt ſubiect of Complaint, ſeeing them abandon it as a prey to the wicked,

and that their deſire of eaſe cauſeth them to forſake the publicke good. This (my Lord) is to let you know, you are to reſerue your Humility for thoſe Actions, paſſing betwene God and Your ſelfe: But that in other caſes you can neither haue too much Wealth, nor ouer great power; ſince Obedience is due to Wiſedome; there being certaine vertues not practiſeable by the poore. I doe therefore infinitely reioyce, to ſee you at this preſent raiſed to that eminent Dignity, wherein you fill the Vniuerſe with Splendor, and where your ſole Example will (I hope) carry
ſo great weight, as to cauſe the Church to returne to the Purity of its firſt Jnfancy. Truely, if there be any hope to expect this happineſſe, and to ſee rebellious Spirits perſwaded, as we behold their Citties forced; you doubtleſſe are the man, from whom wee are to expect this felicity; and who is only able to finiſh the victories of Kings by the ſubuerſion of Misbeleeuers: To this effect doth all

                  Christendome exact theſe atchieuments at your hands, as a laſt inſtruction, and the generall peace of Conſciences: and my ſelfe who haue thus long beene in ſearch after the Jdea of Eloquence, without finding among vs any which is not eyther counterfeit or imperfect; am very confident you wil bring it to light in the ſame excellency as it was, when at Rome the Tyrants were condemned, and when it defended the oppreſſed Prouinces. Though Purple be very refulgent, yet will it receiue a farther luſter by this your Dignity, carrying command where euer it commeth; and which is particularly ſo proper for the conduct of Soules, as it is onely to that power whereto they will ſubmit themſelues. My Lord, if I haue any hope to be knowne in after Ages, or that my Name may paſſe to Poſterity; they ſhall finde this conſideration to be the firſt obligation vnto me, of ſeeking the Honour of your Acquaintance, and that hauing heard you ſpeake, you

did ſo abſolutely purchaſe both my thoughts and affections, that ſince then, I haue euer reflected vpon you, as on an extraordinary perſon, and haue euer paſſionately remayned
               
                  My Lord,

                   Your moſt humble, moſt obedient, and moſt faithfull ſeruant, BALZAC. 
                  
                     The 16. of December, 1622.
                  
               
            
            
               To the Cardinall of Richelieu from BALZAC.
               
               LETTER VI.
               
                  My LORD,
               
               HAd the wayes beene ſafe, or if the good order you haue taken for publicke ſecurity, had not beene ſubiect to the like ſucceſſe as are wholeſome Lawes, which are ſeldome well obſerued, I ſhould not be neceſſitated to take a longer time then you allotted me when I

parted from Fountainebleau, nor had I till now beene conſtrayned to ſpin out the time of my Diſpatch. But though your Commandments are all powerfull in me, yet you know neceſſity will firſtbe obeyed, nor will you (I hope) be diſpleaſed that I haue made choyce of a Priſon whereto I am accuſtomed, to auoide another not ſo commodious for me. This hath not hapned but to my extreame griefe, ſince I haue not beene able to be a witneſſe of the moſt illuſtrious life of our Age, and haue thereby loſt halfe a Yeare of your Actions which (well nigh) fill vp all our Hiſtory. For though we are not ſo remote from the World, that no Newes can come to vs, yet they paſſe ſo many places, as it is impoſſible they receiue not diuers Impreſſions, or that they ſhould arriue here in their purity, ſince they are often altered from the very Loouer; yet haue Ivnderſtood, and Fame hath publiſhed euen in Deſarts, the great Conflicts by you vndergone, and atchieued for the Honour and Reputation of

                  France, and how you haue ſubdued the ſubtilties of Strangers, being in truth more to be feared then their Forces. I heare how Italy hath ſpent all her practiſes without hurting any, and how thoſe Stateſ-men who made accompt to Seignorize in all Aſſemblies, and to be Maiſters in all Reaſons of State, were vnable to defend themſelues againſt you, but with paſſion, and choller: nor to complaine of any other thing, but that you perſwaded them to whatſoeuer they were before▪ hand reſolued not to yeeld. So as (my Lord) thoſe who tearmed vs Barbartans, and by their treaties commonly tooke reuenge of our Victories, haue in the end found wiſedome on this ſide the Alpes, and haue well perceiued there is a man who hath abilities to hinder them from deceiuing others. They ſtood amazed to ſee a Seruant who would not ſuffer there ſhould be any Maiſter greater then his Soueraigne. Who was as ſencible of the leaſt Euils of his Countrey, as of his proper ſorrowes,

ſuppoſing himſelfe to be wounded vpon the leaſt apprehenſion, when any made ſhew of trenching vpon the Dignity of this Crowne. But when they found you applyed preſent remedies to all ſuch inconueniences as they obiected; that you preuented the difficulties they offered to propoſe, that you diued into their ſoules, drawing thence their cloſeſt Intentions, and how at the firſt conference you made anſwer to what they reſerued for a ſecond. Then it was indeede, when their Fleame was turned into Choler, and when you put their humane Wiſedomes and politique Maximes to a ſtand. So as we ſee it is ſufficient onely to let Good appeare, to cauſe it to be beloued: and truely if Reaſon had the like power ouer the Will, as it hath ouer the 
                     Ʋnderſtanding, all thoſe Italians doubtleſſe, who heard you ſpeake, had returned good French-men, and the ſafety of Chriſtendome together with the ſecurity of her Princes, had beene but one daies worke. Forraigne warres had beene ended in your

chamber; nor ſhould we now haue any more then one buſineſſe vpon vs, and the Kings Forces had at this preſent beene imployed onely in ſuppreſſing the Rebels of his owne Kingdome. My Lord, I hope you are perſwaded (though I could not probably expect any ſlight occurrents from the place where you are) yet that I receiued theſe with much emotion and tranſport, it not being in my power to diſſemble my ioy, when I vnderſtood how their Maieſties are not wearie of your Seruice, and how after hauing tryed diuers Councels, it was in concluſion thought fit to follow yours, and that you precede in the affaires of Europe, by being conductor of the Fortune of France. Truely, of all exteriour contentments, there is not any whereof I am ſo ſenſible as of that. But on the other ſide, when I vnderſtand that your Health is dayly aſſaulted, or threatned by ſome accident, that the Tranquility your Conſcience affords you, hinders you not from hauing ill

Nights: And how amidſt the happy ſucceſſes befalling you, life it ſelfe is notwithſtanding ſomtimes tedious vnto you; then indeed I muſt confeſſe they touch me in the tendereſt part of my Soule. And whilſt the Court makes thouſands of feined Proteſtations vnto you; there is an Hermite ſome hundred Leagues from you, who mournes for your maladies with vnfeigned teares. I know not whether or no I may preſume to ſay, I loue you: yet is it not probable you will take offence at a Word wherewith, you know God himſelfe is well pleaſed. My Lord; I do in ſuch manner Loue you, as I am eyther ſicke vpon the Relation of your indiſpoſition; or if the newes be current that you are recouered, yet haue I ſtill an apprehenſion of what alteration each houre may bring vpon you. Ought it then to be in the Fits of your Feauer, and in your inquietude for want of ſleepe, that you vnderſtand theſe publicke acclamations, and the due prayſes you haue purchaſed: Shall the Senſes ſuffer, and the Spirits reioyce, or

they continue tortured amidſt theſe Tryumphs, or that you (at once) performe two contrary Actions, and at the ſame time haue neede, as well of Moderation, as Patience: If Vertue could be miſerable, or if that Sect which acknowledgeth no other euill, but paine; nor any greater good then pleaſure, had not beene generally condemned: the Diuine prouidence had receiued complaints from all parts of this Kingdome; nor had there beene an honeſt man knowne, who for your ſake had not found ſomething farther to be deſired in the conduct of this World. But (my Lord) you vnderſtand much better then I doe, that it is only touching the felicity of beaſts, we are to beleeue the body, and not concerning ours, reſiding onely in the ſupreame part of our ſelues, and which is as ſmally ſenſible of thoſe diſorders committed below her, as thoſe in Heauen can bee offended by the tempeſts of the Ayre, or vapours of the Earth. This being true: God forbid, that

by the eſtate of your preſent conſtitution, I ſhould iudge of that of your Condition; or that I ſhould not eſteeme him perfectly happy who is ſuperlatiuely wiſe. You may pleaſe to conſider, that howbeit you haue ſhared with other men the infirmities of humane Nature, yet the aduantage reſteth ſoly on your ſide: ſince (vpon the matter) there is onely ſome ſmall paine remayning with you, inſtead of an infinity of errours, paſſions, and faults falling to our lots. Beſides▪ I am confident that the terme of your ſufferings is well nigh expired, and that the hereafter prepares right ſolide and pure contentments for you, and a youth after its ſeaſon, as you are become old before your time. The King who hath vſe of your long liuing, makes no vnprofitable wiſhes: Heauen beares not the prayers that the Enemies of this State offer. We know no Succeſſor that is able to effect what you haue not yet finiſhed: and it being true, that our Forces are but the Armes of your Head, and that

your Councels haue beene choſen by God to re-eſtabliſh the Affaires of this Age: we ought not to bee apprehenſiue of a loſſe which ſhould not happen but to our Succeſſors. It ſhall then be in your time (my Lord, I hope) that oppreſſed Nations will come from the Worlds end to implore the protection of this Crowne: that by your meanes our Allies will repaire their loſſes, and that the Spaniard ſhall not be the ſole Conquerour, but that we ſhall prooue the Infrancheſers of the whole Earth. In your time (I truſt) the Holy Sea ſhall haue her Opinions free, nor ſhall the inſpirations of the Holy Ghoſt be oppugned by the artifice of our Enemies, reſolutions will be raiſed worthy the ancient Jtaly for defence of the common cauſe. To conclude, it will bee through your Prudence (my Lord) that there ſhall no longer be any Rebellion among vs, or Tyranny among men: that all the Citties of this Kingdome ſhall be ſeates of aſſurance for honeſt men; that

nouelties ſhall be no farther in requeſt; ſaue onely for colours and faſhions of Attire▪ that the People will reſigne Liberty, Religion, and the Common-wealth, into the hands of Superiours, and that outof lawfull gouernment, and loyall obedience, there will ariſe that felicity Politiſians ſearch after, as being the end of Ciuile life. My hope is (my Lord) that all this will happen vnder your ſage conduct, and that after you haue ſetled our repoſe, and procured the ſame for our Allies, you ſhall enioy your good deeds in great tranquility, and ſee the eſtate of thoſe things endure, whereof your ſelfe haue beene a principal Author. All good men are confident theſe bleſſed euents will happen in your Age, and by your Aduice. As for me who am the meaneſt among thoſe who iuſtly admire your Vertues, I ſhall not (I hope) prooue the ſlackeſt in the expreſſion of your Merits: Since therefore they (of right) exact a generall acknowledgment; if I ſhould fayle

in my particular contribution, I were for euer vnworthy the Honour I ſo ambitiouſly aſpire vnto; the highth whereof is to be eſteemed
               
                  Your Lordſhips moſt humble and moſt obedient ſeruant, BALZAC.
               
            
            
               To the Lord Biſhop of Aire.
               
               LETTER VIII.
               
                  My Lord,
               
               IF at the firſt ſight, you know not my Letter, and that you deſire to be informed who writes vnto you: It is one more old▪like then his Father, and as ouer-worne as a Ship, hauing made three Voyages to the Indies; and who is no other thing, then the Relickes of him, whom you ſaw at Rome. In thoſe dayes I ſometimes complayned without cauſe, and happily there was then no great difference betweene the health of others, and my infirmity. Howſoeuer,

be it that my imagination is crazed, or that my preſent payne doth no longer admit of any compariſon. I begin to lament the Feauer and Scyatica as loſt goods, and as pleaſures of my youth now paſt: See here to what tearmes I am reduced, and how (as it were) I liue, if it may be called liuing, to be in a continuall conteſtation with Death. True it is, there is not ſufficient efficacy in all the words whereof this World makes vſe, to expreſſe the miſeries I indure; they leaue no place, eyther for the Phyſitians skill, or the ſickemans▪
                   Patience; nor hath Nature ordayned any other remedies for the ſame, ſaue onely Poyſon and precipices. But I much feare leaſt I ſuffer my ſelfe to be tranſported with paine, or endure it leſſe Chriſtianly then beſeemeth me, being a Witneſſe of your Vertus; and hauing had the meanes to profit my ſelfe by your Example. My Lord, it is now time (or neuer) I ſubdue this wicked ſpirit, which doth forcibly tranſport my will; and that the old Adam obey the

other. Yet doth it not a little grieue me, to be indebted to my miſery for my Soules health, and▪ that I much deſire it were ſome other more noble conſideration then neceſſity, ſhould cauſe me to become an honeſt man. But ſince the meanes to ſaue vs are beſtowed vpon vs▪ and that we chuſe them not, it is fitting that reaſon conuince our ſenſiblities, cauſing vs to agree to what is otherwiſe diſtaſtefull vnto vs. At the worſt, we muſt at all times confeſſe, that we cannot be ſayd to periſh, when we are ſafely caſt on ſhore by ſome Ship wracke; and it may be, if God did not driue me as he doth out of this Life, I ſhould neuer dreame of a better. I will referre the reſt to be related vnto you at your returne from Jtaly, with purpoſe to lay open my naked Soule vnto you, together with my Thoughts in the ſame ſimplicity they ſpring in me: you are the onely Perſon from whom I expect Reliefe; and I hold my ſelfe richer in the poſſeſſion of your good Opinion▪
                   then if I enioyed the fauours of all earthly Princes,
                  
and all the Wealth of their Territories and Kingdomes. Truely this is the firſt time (ſince I writ vnto you from Lyons) I haue made vſe of my hands; and I haue receiued a hundred Letters from my Friends without anſwering one. Hereby (my Lord) you ſee, there is no other conſideration (your ſelfe excepted) of force to cauſe me to breake ſilence, ſince for all others I haue loſt the vſe of ſpeaking. Yet I beſeech you to thinke (notwithſtanding all this) my affection to be neyther penurious nor ambitious. The Riches I craue at your noble hands, are purely ſpiritual, and I am at this preſent in an eſtate, wherein I haue more neede to ſettle ſome order for the affaires of my Conſcience, then to reflect vpon the eſtabliſhment of my worldly Fortunes. But (my Lord) to change Diſcourſe, and a little to retire my ſelfe from my paines, what doe you thus long at Rome? Doth the Pope dally with vs? and will he leaue to his Succeſſor the glory of the beſt Election

can be made? Is he not affraide leſt it be giuen out he hath ſome intelligence with his Aduerſaries, and that he taketh not the aduice of the Holy Ghoſt, in what concerneth the Churches Honour: for Gods cauſe bring vs with ſpeede this Newes, prouided it bee the ſame the King demands, and all good men deſire. I hope it ſhall not be ſayd, you haue ſpoken Jtalian all this while to no purpoſe, or that you can accuſe his predictions, as erronious, who neuer falſified his word with you, and who is perfectly
               
                  My Lord 

                  Your moſt humble ſeruant, BALZAC. 
                  
                     The 2. of Iuly, 1622.
                  
               
            
            
               
               To the Lord Biſhop of Ayre.
               
               For the true vnderſtanding of this Letter: it is neceſſary to be acquainted with the Gibbrige, the French reſiding at Rome, vſe to ſpeake; who frame a new kind of Language to themſelues, compoſed of Italian words, hauing onely French terminations.
               
                  
                     LETTER IX.
                     
                        My Lord,
                     
                     I Thinke you will neuer be weary of going to Cortege, and that you will for euer haue an apprehenſion of the Crepuſcule all the dayes of your life; ſo it is, that you haue long enough cauſed the curtaynes of your Corroach to be drawne in preſence of thoſe of Cardinals; and that you may well be (ere now) acquaynted with the Court of Rome, euen from the Papale ſubiects, to thoſe who deſire to be admitted into the firſt degrees of ſacred Orders. For my part, I ſhould ſoone be weary in ſeeing daily one and the ſame thing, and in beginning the day from

the firſt houre of night? What can there be ſo pleaſing in the place where you are, that ſhould deſerue to ſtay you there? In faire weather the Sunne is dangerous: halfe the Yeare they breath nothing but ſmoake, and in the reſt, it raineth ſo frequently, that it ſeemeth ſome Sea hangeth ouer the City of Rome. But it may be you take pleaſure in ſeeing the Pope, a body ouer-ſhaken, and trembling with age and infirmities, who hath no other thing then Ice in his veines, and Earth in his Viſage I cannot imagine how this obiect can affoord you any great contentment; or that you are much taken with the ſociety and Company of the great multitude of my Lords his Aſſiſtants, partaking of the one and the other Signature: Nor can it be Carriofile whom you ſo often ouer-rule, who ſhould intreate you to ſtay there for the furtherance of his Affaires. For being (as he is) a Popeline, and of the Family of the Cardinall Ludouiſio, who affoords him his full ſhare▪ it cannot be but well with

him. I conclude therefore (my Lord) that I cannot gueſſe the cauſe of your ſtay, if you take not the paines to tell me. For to imagine Mounſieur de Luzon not to be as yet a Cardinall, were no leſſe then to wrong the Kings credit, and to iudge amiſſe of publique acknowledgement. I am here at the Antipodes, where there is not any thing but Ayre, the Earth, and a Riuer; One had here neede make aboue ten dayes iourneyes to finde a man: wherefore hauing in this place no other communication but with the Dead, I can relate no other Newes vnto you, but of the other World. Is it not true, that he who would haue burnt his ſhirt, had it knowne his ſecrets, would hardly haue beene drawne to make his generall confeſſion? and that Alexander the Great would with much difficulty haue beene induced to purchaſe Paradiſe by Humility? What ſay you of poore Brutus? who killed his Father, thinking to confound a Tyrant, and no leſſe to repent

himſelfe at his Death, in hauing loued Vertue, then if he had followed an vnfaithfull Miſtreſſe. Doe you not yet remember the firſt Conſuls, whoſe words ſmelt of Garlicke and greene roaſted Meate? thinke you not they made vſe of their hands inſteede of feete, being ſo rough and durty as they were, and wore Shooes inſteed of Gloues? Theſe men were not acquainted eyther with Suger, Muske, or Amber-greeze. They had not (as then any gods of Gold, or Goblets of Siluer. They were ignorant in all ſorts of Sciences, ſaue onely to make Warre, and to haue domination ouer men. I lately read how in Venice (in former times) men of greateſt quality, vſually married with cōmon woemen, and that either the good Husbandry, or the mutuall correſpondency was ſuch among the Cittizens, that one Wife ſerued three Brothers. Think you that Francis the firſt is called Great, for hauing vanquiſhed the Swiſſes? or to diſtinguiſh him frō his Grand▪child? or by reaſon of his great

Noſe? Giue me a reaſon why Selim flew his Father, his Brothers, and Nephewes? and after all this dyed but once? Were it not that I feare to be weariſome vnto you, I ſhould neuer make an end of my Newes, yea I ſhould be ſufficiently ſtored to entertayne you my whole life-time. But it is high time that vnprofitable Speeches, giue place to Pious Cogitations; and that I leaue you among your Myrtles and Orange-Trees, where you are neuer better accompanied then when you are alone. I will here conclude, rather out of Diſcretion, then for want of Matter: But this ſhall not be till after I haue ſayd, that of all thoſe who haue any ſhare in your Fauours, there is not any who is therein more proud of his good Fortune, then my ſelfe, or more really then I am
                     
                        My Lord, 

                        Your moſt humble and moſt affectionate Seruant, BALZAC. 
                        
                           The 25. of September, 1622.
                        
                     
                  
               
            
            
               
               To the Lord Biſhop of Ayre from BALZAC.
               
               LETTER X.
               
                  My LORD,
               
               THeſe times are fatall, for abating thoſe heads appearing aboue others, and for changing the face of things: and queſtionleſſe if this courſe ſtill continue, the King will eyther be forced to ſeeke out a new people, or to reſolue himſelfe for a ſolitary Reigne: All the Court is blacke with mournings: there is not a French-man who doth not either weepe, or is bewayled▪ and Warre cauſeth onely ſlight ſorrowes; yet euen among thoſe whoſe loſſe we lament, there are alwaies ſome we willingly leaue, and whoſe Catastrophe may ſerue vs as a conſolation for the reſt. Without further ambiguity, the man is ſeaſed on, who grew leane by the well▪fare of others, and who was one

of thoſe pale and ſober perſons, borne for the Ruine of States; there is ſome appearance he dyed as well of the Purples of M. L. C. D. R. as of his owne, and that you ſent him his firſt ſurfeit from Rome; where he truely conſidering how there was no longer any fauour to follow, nor Fauorite to flatter, he would leaue to liue any longer, as though he had no further affaires in this World. Howſoeuer it be, we are herein to acknowledge the Finger of God, and to confeſſe, he doth ſometimes puniſh Malefactors, without obſeruing the formes of Juſtice▪
                   at leaſt it cannot be denied, but God loueth the Queene extraordinarily, ſince he reſerueth to himſelfe the reuenge of all her iniuries, nor will let any thing remay ne in the world which may prooue diſtaſtefull vnto her. If ſhe deſired the Sea ſhould be calme in the moſt ſtormy dayes of Winter; or two Autumnes to happen each Yeare: I am confident of Natures change, in conformity to her will: nor is there any thing ſhe

cannot obtaine of Heauen, which granteth the very prayers ſhee hath not as yet begun. I am here ſome hundred and fifty Leagues from theſe fine things, where I ſtudy to ſolace my ſelfe as much as poſſibly I can; and to this end, I make my ſelfe drunke euery day: But to free you from any ſiniſter opinion of what I ſay, I aſſure you it is onely with the water of Pougues, which ſurely would bee Inke, were it blacke; ſo that I ſurfeit without finning againſt the Rules of Sobriety, and my frolickes are as Auſteere as the Minimes faſtings. I haue a great deſire to enter couenants with my Phiſitians, wherby it might be granted, that all agreeable things ſhould be wholeſome, &amp; that one might ſpeedily recouer his Health by the ſent of Flowers, inſtead of their Medicines which are ordinarily ſecond miſeries ſucceeding the former: yet without ſpending much time, or trouble▪ I haue made all impoſſibilities paſſable with me, and in the caſe I am, I would ſwallow Fire, were

it preſcribed me for the recouery of my health. It is no ſmall aduantage▪ not to be reduced to theſe tearmes no more then you are, and not to know what it is to ſuffer or complayne. So is it for the generall good of the whole World, that GOD hath giuen you this vigorous Health, to imploy it in the ſeruice of Kings, and in your Vigilancy ouer the conduct of People. As for me, who ſhould not happily make ſo good vſe thereof as I ought, and who am farre more inclinable to Vice then to Vertue: I hold it conuenient I be alwayes crazy, and that GOD take from me the meanes to offend Him, whereof otherwiſe I ſhould infallibly make but ouer-much vſe: I write not at this preſent to M. it is all I can do to finiſh this Letter in haſt, and to tell you what you long ſince knew, that
               
                  I am my Lord, Your moſt humble and paſſionate Seruant; BALZAC. 
                  
                     
                        October the 15. 1622.
                  
               
            
            
               
               To the Lord Biſhop of Aire, from BALZAC.
               
               LETTER XI.
               
                  My Lord,
               
               I Am infinitely glad to vnderſtand by your Letters, of your ſafe returne into France, and that you haue now no further vſe of Cypbers, for the expreſſion of your minde to my Lord the Cardinall of Richelieu. I ſhall at your pleaſure (I hope) vnderſtand the particulars of your Voyage, and what you haue ſeene at Naples and 
                     Ʋenice, worthy your content. This is not out of any great curioſity I haue for theſe things, or that I admire dumble Marble, or Pictures being no way ſo beautifull as the Perſons: Theſe trifles are to be left for the Vulgar, with whom the ſame Obiects limit their imagination and ſight: and who (of all times) reflect, mearely vpon the preſent, and (of all things▪) onely vppon the

appearance: but for my part I am of a contrary opinion. There are not in the whole world any Pallaces ſo ſumptuous, or of ſo high a ſtructure which are not farre vnder my thoughts, and I conceiue in my ſpirit a poore hermitage, to the foundation whereof many more materials are proiected, then were requiſite for eſtabliſhing a Republicke. You ſee here my Lord, how in ſome ſort I play the Prince amidſt my pouerty, and with what inſolency I ſcorne what the world ſo much admireth; I am as haughty, as though I were a Miniſter of State; or as if this laſt change in the Kingdome had beene made for me alone: yet you know well that I call not my ſelfe L. M. D. L. V, and how if there had beene none but my ſelfe to aſſault my Lord the Comte of Schambergs▪
                   Vertue, it ſtill had continued in the ſame place where it hath beene reuerenced of all men. Each man hath his ſeuerall cenſure concerning this great newes, but whatſoeuer they can ſay, I aſſure my ſelfe there can nothing

befall that Lord, whereto hee is not at all times prepared, and that he hath liued too long, not to know that Fortune taketh ſpeciall delight in dallying with the affaires of France, and hath from all Ages made choyce of our Court, as the Theater of her follies. If he had not beene prouided of the gouernment of this Citty, and what time the King commanded him to come thence, his fall had beene more fearefull then it was, but it is Gods will that Augoleſme ſhould be the fatall retreate of the afflicted, and truely allthings well conſidered, it is no great downe▪come to light vpon a Mountaine: Now truely if the e be any thing amiſſe in the adminiſtration of the Kings Monies, hee cannot be taxed for introducing this errour; for he found it there: and beſides, the neceſſity of the times haue euer reſiſted his good intentions, and haue hindred the appearance of what he had in his heart, for the reformation of diſorders▪ It is now neceſſary the King vndertake ſo glorious a Deſigne,

and ſet his hand to that part of the State, which hath more neede of redreſſe then all the reſt. But he is firſt to begin by the moderation of his Spirit, and hee ſhall after gaine their loyalty who ſerue him. If thoſe Princes our Elders haue ſeene, had conſidered, that the Coyne comming into their Exchecquers, was no leſſe then the blood, and teares of their poore Subiects, whom they haue often forced to flye into Forreſts, and paſſe the Seas to ſaue themſelues from taxes and impoſitions: they would haue beene more ſcrupulous and cautelous how they had touched vpon ſo dreadfull vndertakings: at leaſt they would not haue beene at once both indigent and vniuſt, nor haue amazed all the Princes of Europe, who could neuer conceiue why they borrowed their owne moneyes of their Treaſurers, who receiue their revenewes, as they purchaſe their owne ſtrong places from their Gouernours who command therein. Truely, it is very ſtrange the Great
                  
                  Turke can intruſt his Wiues to the vigilancy of others, and aſſure themſelues their Chaſtity ſhall therby be conſerued; yet that Kings know not to whom they may ſafely encharge their Treaſures. But the true reaſon is, for that an honeſt man is by ſo much more difficultly found, then an Eunuch, by how much Miracles are more rare then Monſters. Great Fortitude is requiſite for the attayning of Honeſty, but the will onely ſufficeth to become couetous, and the moſt harmeleſſe haue hands, and may happen to haue temptations. Were it my part to play the reformer, and to preach before the Prelates, I would enlarge my ſelfe vpon this Subiect; but in the condition wherein I ſtand, it is ſufficient I approue not the ill, and haue a good Opinion of the preſent State: prouided, the report be current, that there is now no obſtacle betweene the King and the Queene his Mother, likely to hinder them from meeting; and that things are reduced to thoſe tearmes

wherein Nature hath placed them: Then will the face of the State ſhortly reſume the ſame beauty the late King beſtowed thereon, and God will with a full hand powre his Graces vpon ſo iuſt a Gouernment. Though my Lord the Cardinall of Richlieu were onely neare Publique affaires, without touching them, there is no queſtion but he would bring a bleſſing to all France, and though he intimated nothing to the King, yet that he would at leaſt inſpire whatſoeuer were neceſſary for the good of his Subiects, and Dignity of his Crowne▪ I will reſerue to ſpeake as I ought of this rare Vertue, till my great Worke come to light▪ Where I will render euery man his right, and condemne euen thoſe as culpable, whom the Parliaments crouch vnto; There ſhall it be where I will canuaſſe the Court of Rome▪
                   (which I alwayes ſeparate from the Church) with as much force, and freedome as he vſed, from whoſe mouth we haue ſeene lightning to iſſue, and Thunder to be

throwne out. There is not any thing of ſo faire a ſemblance whoſe deformities I vnmaske not. There is nothing of eminency from one end of the World to the other, I ouer-turne not▪ I will diſcouer the defects of Princes and States. I will expugne Vice whereſoeuer it is hidden, and with what Protection ſoeuer it is palliated. To conclude, I will paſſe as ſeuere a Judgement as was that of the Areopagites in times paſt, or of the Inquiſition at this preſent. Yet my Lord, in this my common cenſure, I will take a particular care of the Queene Mothers reputation, and will let all the World ſee, that what heretofore others haue called Vertue, is the naturall habitude of this great Princeſſe. In the place for others appoynted for Afflictions and Calamities, She ſhall together with the King, receiue onely Flowers and Crownes; and as her innocency had ſaued her from the generall deluge, had ſhe then liued; ſo will it cauſe her to Tryumph in my Story amidſt the tuines of others▪ I haue not the faculty

of Flattering, but the Art only to ſpeake the Truth in good termes; and the Actions you ſee, had need be more eminent then thoſe you haue read of, if I equall them not by my Words. This being thus (my Lord, as I hope, you doubt not;) imagine in what tearmes▪ I will iuſtific the R. D. L. R, and in what fort I will intreate her enemies▪ if I haue a minde to it, I will make it one day appeard that 
                     〈◊〉
                   hath beene as cruell a Monſter as thoſe who deuourewhole Cities, and denounce Warre agaynſt all Humane and Dinine things. One will imagine by the markes I giue him, that R. was a Magician, which daily▪pricked ſome Image of Waxe with needles, and who diſturbed the repoſe of all Princes Courts of his time, by the force of his Charmes. The truth is, I will do great matters, prouided my courage quaile not on his part whence I expect it ſhould come, and to whom by a kind of ſtrict Obligation, I am excited to vndertake this Iudgement which will be no leſſe famous then that of Michael Angelo.
                  
At our next meeting I will more particularly acquaint you with the whole deſigne of my Worke, with its order, ornaments, and artifice; you ſhall there ſee whether or no I make good vſe of thoſe houres I ſometimes obtaine from the tyranny of my Phiſisians and lingring maladies. In the interim doe me the Honour to loue me ſtill; nor thinke I ſpeake the Court-language, or that I compliment with you, when I aſſure you I am more then any man liuing
               
                  My Lord, 

                  Your moſt humble ſeruant, BALZAC. 
                  
                     The 28. of December, 1622.
                  
               
            
            
               Another Letter to the Lord Biſhop of Ayre.
               
               LETTER XII.
               
                  My Lord,
               
               IT muſt needes be, your Oath of Fealty doth yet continue, and that the Ceremony you are imployed in, be longer

then I imagined, ſince I haue no newes from you: for I muſt freely confeſſe vnto you, I am not ſo ſlightly perſwaded of my ſelfe, as to haue any thought, as that you neglect me. Beſides, I am certaine that publique faith, and what hath euer beene ſworne vpon Altars and the Goſpolls, are not more inuiolable then your word, and that it will ſtand good though Heauen and Earth ſhould ſtart; Beſides, I can leſſe coniecture, that you are hindred by want of Health, whereof I hope you enioy ſo large a treaſure, as it is like to contine as long as the World laſteth. It were a wrong to me, ſhould you alledge Sickneſſe, and no leſſe then to wrangle with me for a thing in ſuch manner appropriated to my ſelfe, as I cannot communicate it to any other. I will therefore imagine whatſoeuer you will haue me to thinke; you may loue me if you pleaſe, without taking the paines to tell mee ſo: But for my part, how importunate ſoeuer I am herein, yet

am I reſolute to write vnto you, till you cut off my hands, and to publiſh ſo long as I haue a tongue, that I am
               
                  Sir, 

                  Your moſt humble, and moſt affectionate ſeruant, BALZAC▪
                   
                  
                     The 16. of December, 1622.
                  
               
            
            
               To the Lord Biſhop of Ayre from BALZAC.
               
               LETTER XIII.
               
                  My Lord,
               
               YOu cannot looſe me, how little care ſoeuer you take to keepe mee; The Heauens muſt neceſſarily infuſe new affections in me, and vtterly alter my inclinations, if they intend to inhibite mee to be your Seruant. Yet doth it not a little grieue me, you doe not teſtifie what I know you beleeue; and that hauing the power to make me happy by the leaſt of your Letters, I haue more trouble to impetrate

this fauour, then I ſhould finde in the obtaining of three Declarations from the King, and as many Briefes from his Holineſſe. But all this notwithſtanding I cannot be perſwaded you place mee among matters of meere indifferency, or that you no longer remember what you haue promiſed with ſo large proteſtations, which I hold to be moſt authenticall. I rather for the ſatisfaction of my thoughts will be confident you haue reſolued to loue me in ſecret, thereby to auoide all iealouſie; and will beleeue there is more cunning, then coldneſſe in your Silence; were it otherwiſe, or had I really loſt your Fauours, certainely I would not ſuruiue ſo deepe a diſcomfort, ſince there is not any baniſhment, ſhipwracke, or ſiniſter fortune, I could not rather require at Gods hands, then ſuch a loſſe: But theſe Diſcourſes are as much as to ſuppoſe impoſſibilities, or to inuent Dreames: I will therefore leaue them, to let you vnderſtand ſome newes from me. I can onely

ſay, the Ayre of this Countrey is not offenſiue vnto me: for to aſſure you that I am in health were too great a boldneſſe, I confeſſe, I haue now and then ſome pleaſing pauſes, and I enioy certaine good Houres, which make mee remember my former Health: But there is great difference betweene this imperfect eſtate of mine and a conſtitution comparable to that of yours, who haue life ſufficient to viuifie thirty ſuch worne bodies as mine, which needes but one blaſt to blow it downe. Howſoeuer, my Phiſitians haue promiſed to make me a new man, and to reſtore vnto mee what I haue loſt. I ſhould be well contented they were men of their words, and that I might at my eaſe attend all occaſions, to teſtifie how paſſionately I am
               
                  
                     The 6. of Ianuary, 1623.
                  

                  Your moſt humble and moſt affectionate Seruant, BALZAC.
               
            
            
               
               To the Reuerend Biſhop of Ayre, from BALZAC.
               
               LETTER XIIII.
               
                  My LORD,
               
               SInce you haue as much care of me as of your Dioceſſe, and in that I perceiue you would imagine ſome defect, euen in the felicities you expect in Heauen, ſhould you be ſaued without me; I will vſe my vtmoſt indeauours to cauſe that your deſire of my Spirituall good prooue not vnprofitable, and to make my ſelfe capable of the good Counſell you gaue mee by your Letter. True it is, I haue beene ſo long habituated in vice, I haue almoſt vtterly forgotten my ſtate of Jnnocency, ſo as a particular Jubile for my ſelfe onely, were no more then neceſſary: On the otherſide, the pious motions I haue, are ſo poore and imperfect, that of all the flames the Primatiue Chriſtians
                  
haue felt and endured, I ſhould hardly ſupport the meere ſmoake. Yet my Lord) euen in this bad ſtate wherin I now ſtand, doe I expect a Miracle from my Maker, who is onely able to raiſe Children out of the hardeſt Quarries; nor will I beleeue his Mercy hath finiſhed what hee intendeth to effect for the good of Mortals: For ſince hee hath placed Ports vpon the ſhoares of moſt dangerous Seas, and giuen ſome kinde of dawning, euen to the darkeſt Nights; it may be there is yet ſomething reſerued for me in the ſecrets of his Prouidence; and that if hitherto I haue ranged out of the right way, he will not any longer ſuffer me to ſtray, or tire my ſelfe in the tracke of vice. And truely, I muſt here, though much to my ſhame, acknowledge the truth vnto you, with thoſe few drops of corrupt blood (which is all I haue left) I am plunged in all thoſe paſſions, wherewith the foundeſt bodies are preſſed: yea, Tyrants, who burne whole Citties vpon the firſt motion of

rage, and choller, and who allow themſelues to act what vnlawfull thing ſoeuer, doe nothing more then my ſelfe, ſaue onely to enioy thoſe things I deſire, and to execute thoſe deſignes remayning onely in my will, I wanting their power to perpetrate the like: Nor can the Feauer, the Stone, nor the Scyatica, as yet tame my rebellious ſpirit, or cauſe it to become capable of Diſcipline; and if time had added yeares to the reſt of my infirmities, I verily thinke I ſhould deſire to behold vncleane ſights with ſpectacles, ſuch I meane as you vtterly auoide, and cauſe my ſelfe to be carried to thoſe lewd places, whither alone I were vnable to goe: Inſomuch that as there are diuers paintings which are neceſſarily to bee cleane defaced, to take away the defects; ſo I much feare nothing but Death can ſtay the current of my crimes, vnleſſe by your meanes I enter into a ſecond Life, more fruitfull then the former. I therefore ſpeake in good ſadneſſe, ſet your whole

Cleargy to prayer, and commaund a publique Faſt in the ſame ſtrictneſſe, as though you were to impetrate at the hands of God, the converſion of the great Turke, or of the Perſian Emperour▪ Propound to your ſelfe Monſters in my will to be maſtred, and an infinity of enemies to ouercome in my paſſions, and after all this you will beare me witneſſe, I haue not made matters greater then they are, and ſaue onely a certaine imperfect deſire I haue to repent, and a kinde of ſmall reſiſtance, I ſometimes make againſt the beginnings and buddings of vice, there is not any difference at all betweene my ſelfe and the greateſt ſinner liuing: But take not (I beſeech you) this I write, as a marke of my Humility, for you neuer read a truer relation: and what St. Paul ſpake in the perſon of Mankind, accuſing himſelfe of other mens offences, is my owne ſimple depoſition, which I deliuer into the hands of the Diuine Juſtice. I hate my ſelfe; yet true it is, I finde

ſo great coldneſſe in the performance of pious actions, that my mind ſeemeth to be impriſoned when at any time my Duty draweth me to Church, and when I am there, I rather ſeeke diuertions and temptations, then inſtruction or edification: Euen mentall prayer being an Oblation for all houres, and which may bee performed without either burnt Jncenſe, OF bloody Sacrifices, and the finiſhing whereof is ſo neere the firſt motion; is to me as laborious, as the Pilgrimage of Mount Serrat, or of our Lady of Loretta, would be to another. I am alwayes ſad, but neuer penitent; I loue ſolitarineſſe, but hate auſterity; I ſide with honeſt men, but reſide with the wicked: if at any time ſome ſmall rayes of Deuotion reflect vpon my crazy conſcience, they are of ſo ſhort continuance, and ſo weake, as they neyther afford me light nor heate, ſo as all this being but accident, and meere chance, doth not any way merit the name of good, and it were great wrong to Vertue, to ranke it

in the number of caſuall occurrents. You are therefore neceſſarily to labour for my converſion, which I am vnable to effect of my ſelfe, and that for my part, I onely affoord matter whereon to make an honeſt man. If there bee certayne Saints whom we owe to the teares and interceſſion of others, and if ſome Martyrs haue made their very Executioners Companions of their Glory, I may well hope you will be a powerfull meanes to ſaue me with your ſelfe; and that one day (happily) I may be mentioned among the reſt of your Miracles▪ Sir, I know your life to be ſo ſpotleſſe, as though you were incorporeall, or neuer loued any other then that Supreame beauty, from whence all others are deriued▪ Wherefore there is no queſtion but ſo rare a 
                     Ʋertue may eaſily impetrate at Gods hands any ſupplication you ſhall exhibite, nor is there any doubt hee hath (for you allotted) other limits to his bounty, ſaue his onely omnipotency. You ſhall yet at the leaſt finde in me Obedience and

Docility, if I haue not attayned any ſtronger habitudes. You ſhall haue to doe with one who amidſt the corruption of this Age, wherein well nigh all Spirits reuolte from the Faith, cannot be drawne to beleeue any truth to be greater, then what he hath vnderſtood from his Nurſe or Mother. If in what concerneth not Religion, I haue ſometimes had my priuate Sence and Opinion, I doe with my very heart leaue the ſame, to the end, to reconcile my ſelfe with the Vulgar; and leaſt I ſhould appeare an Enemy to my Countrey for a ſlight word, or matter of ſmall importance. If φφφφ had held himſelfe to this Maxime, he might ſecurely haue liued among men, nor had hee beene proſecuted with all extreamity as the moſt ſauage of all beaſts: But he rather choſe to make a Tragicall end, then to expect a death wherewith the World was vnacquainted, or to execute onely ordinary actions. So farre as I can learne, or if the report which paſſeth be current, he had a

conceite he might one day proue to be that falſe Prophet, wherewith the declining age of the Church is threatned: and though hee be but of meane extraction, and poore fortunes, he was notwithſtanding ſo preſumptuous, as to imagine himſelfe to be the man, who is to come with armed forces to diſturbe the quiet of Conſciences, and for whom the infernall Miniſters keepe all the Treaſures yet hidden in the Earths intrailes. So long as he contented himſelfe in committing onely humane faults, writing as yet with an vntainted Pen, I often told him, his Verſes were not paſſable; and that hee was in the wrong to eſteeme himſelfe an vnderſtanding man. But he perceiuing that the rules I propounded to him, for bettering his abilities, to be ouer-ſharpe and ſeuere for him▪ and finding ſmall hope of arriuing whether I deſired to conduct him, he perhaps thought beſt to ſeeke out ſome other way to bring himſelfe into credit at Court, hoping of a meane Poet to become a mighty Prophet: So

that (as it is generally reported) after he had peruerted a number of ſilly Spirits▪
                   and long ſhewed himſelfe in the throng of the ignorant multitude; he in concluſion did as one who ſhould caſt himſelfe into a bottomleſſe pit, on purpoſe to gayne the reputation of being an admirable Iumper. My Lord, you remember (I doubt not) what our ioynt opinion hath beene of ſuch like perſons, and the weakneſſe you ſhewed there was in the principles of their wicked Doctrine. Now truely how extrauagant ſoeuer my Spirit hath beene, I haue yet euer ſubmitted the ſame to the authority of GODS Church, and to the conſent of Nations; and as I haue alwayes held, that a ſingle drop of Water, would more eaſily corrupt, then the whole Ocean: So haue I euer aſſured my ſelfe, that particular opinions could neuer be eyther ſo ſound or ſollid, as the generall Tenets. A ſilly man who hath no further knowledge of himſelfe, then by the relations of others, who is at his wits end, and wholly confounded in the conſideration or reflection vpon

the meaneſt workes of Nature; who after the reuolution of ſo many Ages, is not able to aſſigne the cauſe of a certayne Riuers ouer-flow; nor of the interuals or good dayes of a Tertian Ague: How dare he preſume to ſpeake confidently of that Infinite Maieſty, in whoſe preſence the Angels themſelues couer their faces with their Wings, and vnder whom the very Heauens crouch, euen to the Earths loweſt concauities. There is no other thing remayning for vs, ſaue the only glory of Humility, and Obedience, within the limits whereof, we ought to contayne our ſelues: And ſince it is moſt certayne, that Humane reaſon reacheth not to ſo high a pitch as to attayue the perfection of Knowledge, we ought inſteed of diſputing or queſtioning poynts of Religion, to reſt ſatisfied in the adoration of their Myſteries: for doubtleſſe, if we ſtriue to enter further thereinto, or ſearch for a thing vtterly vnknowne to all Philoſophy, and concealed from the Sages of this World, we ſhall by ſuch prophane

curioſity gaine onely the dazeling of our Eyes, and confuſion of our Sences: God by the light of his Goſpell hath reuealed vnto vs diuers Truths, whereof we were vtterly ignorant; but he reſerueth for vs far greater Myſteries, which wee ſhall neuer comprehend, but only in that Kingdome which he hath prepared for his choſen Seruants, and by the onely viſion of his Face. In the meane time; to the end, to augment the merit of our Faith, and the more to perfectionate our Piety, his pleaſure is, that Chriſtians ſhould become as blind Louers, and that they haue not any other deſires or hopes, but for thoſe things aboue the reach of their vnderſtandings, and which they can no way comprehend by Naturall reaſon. So ſoone as the time you haue prefixed me, ſhall be expired, and the Prime-roſes make the Spring appeare, I will not faile to wayte vpon you, and diligently to addreſſe my ſelfe to the collection of your graue and important Diſcourſes, and to become an honeſt man by hearing,
                  
ſince that is the Sence appointed for the apprehenſion of Chriſtian vertues, and whereby the Sonne of God was conceiued, and his Kingdome eſtabliſhed among men. But it is needleſſe to vſe any artifice, or that you paint the place of your abode in ſo glorious colours, thereby to inuite mee to come: For though you preached in the Deſart, or were you hidden in ſuch a corner of the World, where the Sunne did onely ſhine vpon the ſterile Sands and ſteepe Rockes: you well know, I ſhould eſteeme my ſelfe happy where you are. Your Company being of power to make either a priſon or proſcription pleaſing vnto me; and wherein I finde the Loouer and the whole Court, will adde (to the deſcription you haue made of Aire) diuers beauties which Geographers haue not hitherto obſerued, as being far greater then others, though more ſecret. Thoſe Mountaines which will not allow France and Spaine to be one mans, and vnder which the Raine and Thunder are framed, will appeare to me more huge, then

they formerly did, when I firſt ſaw them: your waters which heretofore cured diuer Diſeaſes, will euen raiſe the Dead, if you once bleſſe them; and doubtleſle this people, alwayes bred vp to beare Armes, and who as the Fire and Jron is onely deſtinated for the vſe of Warre, hath (ere now) mollified their fierce humour by the moderation of your mild conduct. For my part (Sir) I make account to become a new man vnder your hands, and to receiue a ſecond Birth from you. Truely, it would be a thing right happy to me, and in it ſelfe famous; if the like Spirituall health, proceeding from the garments and ſhadowes of the Apoſtles, might happen vnto me by approaching ſo holy a perſon; and if being your workmanſhip, and the Sonne of your Spirit, I ſhould inſtantly reſemble a Father ſo happily endowed with all thoſe rare qualities and perfections, which are wholy deficient in me.

               LETTER XV.
               YEſterday was one of thoſe Sunleſſe dayes (as you tearme them) which reſemble that beautifull blind Maide, wherewith Philip the ſecond fell in Loue. Truely, I neuer tooke more pleaſure in ſo priuate a ſolitarineſſe; and though I walked in a large and open Plaine, wherof man could make no other vſe, but for two Armies to fight in: yet the ſhade the Heauens caſt on all ſides, cauſed mee little to regard the ſhelter of Caues or Forreſts. There was a generall and quiet calme from the higheſt Region of the Ayre, euen to the Superficies of the Earth: the waters of Riuers ſeemed as euen and ſmooth as thoſe of Lakes; and ſurely, if at Sea ſuch a calme ſhould for euer ſurpriſeſhips,

they could neuer bee eyther ſafe, or ſunke. This I ſay, on purpoſe to make you repent the loſle of ſo pleaſant a Day, for not comming abroad out of the Citty, as alſo to draw you ſometimes out of your Angouleſme, where you treade leuill with our Towers and Steeples, to come and take part of thoſe pleaſures wherein the ancient Princes of the World tooke delight: who vſually refreſhed themſelues in Fountaines, and liued on thoſe fruites which Forreſts affoord. Your Friends here are in a ſmall circle enuironed with Mountaines, and where is yet remaining ſome few graines of that faire Gold whereof the firſt Age was compoſed. In truth when the fire of Warre is flaming in the foure corners of France, and that within a hundred paces hence, the whole Earth is couered with aduerſe Troupes and Armies; they with mutuall conſent doe alwayes ſpare our Village. The Spring-time in other places producing the beſiegings of Forts and Cities, with other

enterpriſes of Warre, and which for this dozen yeares hath beene leſſe looked for, in reſpect of the change of Seaſons, then for any alteration of Affaires, ſuffers vs to ſee no other thing but Violets and Roſes. Our people are not contayned in their primatiue innocency, eyther by feare of Lawes or Study of Sciences▪ They (to liue vprightly) doe ſimply follow their naturall Bounty, and draw more aduantage from their ignorance of Vice, then moſt of vs do out of the knowledg of Vertue: ſo as in this. Territory of two miles, they know not how to coſen any, ſaue Birds and Beaſts, and the pleading Language is as vnknowne here, as that of America, or of other parts of the World, which haue eſcaped the auarice of Ferdinand▪
                   and the ambition of Iſabella. Thoſe things which hurt the health of man, or offend their eyes, are generally baniſhed hence; Snakes nor Lizards are neuer ſeene here, and of creping creatures wee know no other but Melions and Strawberries. I intend

not here to draw you the portraite of a Palace, the workemanſhip wherof hath not bin ordred acording to the rules of architecture, nor the matter ſo precious as Marble and Purphire. I will onely tell you that at the Gates there is a Groue, wherein at full noone there enters no more day then needes muſt not to make it night, and to cauſe all colours not to looke blacke▪ ſo that betweene the Sun and the ſhade, there is a kinde of third temper compoſed, which may well be endured by the weakeſt eyes, and hide the deformities of painted faces. The Trees here, are greene to the very ground, as well with their owne leaues, as with Iuy which inuirones them: and as for the fruites wherein they are deficient, their branches are all beſet with Turtle-Doues and Pheſants, and this at all times in the yeare. From thence I march into a Meddow, where I treade vpon Tulipans and Anemons, hauing cauſed them to be mingled among other Flowers, to

confirme my opinion I brought from my Trauailes, that French Flowers are not ſo faire, as thoſe of Forraine Countries. I (ſometimes walke downe into that Vallie, being the ſecret part of my Deſart, and which till now) was not knowne to any man: It is a Country to be wiſhed for and painted. I haue made choiſe thereof for my moſt precious occupations, there to paſſe the moſt pleaſing houres of my life: The Trees and Water neuer ſuffer this place to want couleneſſe and verdure. The Swans which couered the whole Riuer, are retired to this place of ſecurity: liuing in a Channell, which cauſeth the greateſt talkers to take a nappe, ſo ſoone as they come neare; &amp; on whoſe Bankes I am alwaies happy; be I merry or melancholly: How ſhort a time ſoeuer I ſtay there, I ſuppoſe I enter into my firſt innocency: my deſires, my feares and hopes ſtop in a trice: all the motions of my ſoule flacken, nor haue I any paſſions remaining,

or if I haue any, I gouerne them as tame Beaſts. The Sunne conuayes its light thither, but neuer its heate. The place is ſo low, as it can onely receiue the laſt points of its beames: being therfore the more beautifull, in that they are leſſe burning, and the light thereof altogether pure. But as it is my ſelfe who haue diſcouered this new found Land; ſo do I poſſeſſe it without any partner, nor would I ſhare it with my owne brother. But in all other quarters vnder my commaund, there is not a man who courts not his Miſtreſſe without controule, nor ſeruant of mine who is not maſter; each one ſatisfying himſelfe of what he loues, and ſpending the time at pleaſure. And on the other ſide, when I ſee the Graſſe trodden downe; and on the other, the Corne full of Layers: I am well aſſured, it is neither Winde nor Haile, hath made this worke, but only a Shepheard and his ſweete-heart. At which doore ſoeuer I goe out of my

houſe, or on what ſide ſoeuer I turne mine eyes, in this pleaſant Pathmos, I finde the riuer of Charauton wel meriting as much fame, as that of Tagus, aud wherein, when Beaſts go to drinke, they ſee the Heauens as cleare as we doe, and enioy the ſame aduantage, which elſewhere men haue ouer them. Beſides, this pure water is ſo in loue with this petty Prouince, that it diuides it ſelfe into a thouſand branches, and makes an infinite of windings and turnings, as loath to leaue and depriue it ſelfe of ſo pleaſing a lodging; and when at any time it ouer-floweth, it is only to make the yeare more firtile, and to affoord vs meanes to catch Trouts and Pykes, leauing them vpon the leuill; and which are ſo great and excellent, as they equall the Sea Monſters; the Crocadiles of Nile, and all the ſuppoſed Gold rowling in thoſe feigned Riuers ſo much ſpoken of by Poets. The great Duke of Eſpernon, comes hether ſometimes, for

change of felicity, and to lay aſide that auſtere vertue and ſplendor, which dazeleth the eyes of all men, to aſſume milder qualities, and a more accoſtable Maieſty. This Cardinall likewiſe, by whom Heauen intends to act ſo high deſignes, and of whom you heare me dayly ſpeake, after the loſſe of his brother who was ſuch a one, as if he might haue choſen him among all men, hee would not haue taken any other: after (as I ſay) hauing indured that loſſe, well deſeruing to draw teares from the Queene, he made choice of this place, here to exerciſe his patience, and to receiue from Gods hands who loueth ſilence, and who is found in ſolitary retirements, what Philoſophy affoordeth not, nor is to be practiſed among the throng of people. I would enlarge my ſelfe vpon other Examples, to ſhew you how my Village hath at all times bin frequented by Heroical Hermits, and how the ſteps of Princes and great Siegniors, are (as yet) newly

trodden in my ordinary pathes. But the more to inuite you to come hither; I ſuppoſe it ſufficient to ſay, that Virgil and myſelfe do here attend you: if therfore you be accompanied in this Voyage with your Muſes; and other Manuſcripts, we ſhall not neede to entertayne the time with Court newes, nor with the Germaine troubles: Let me not liue, if euer I ſaw any thing comparable to your Spirituall Meditations, and if the leaſt part of the Worke you ſhewed me, be not of more worth, then all Frankford Mart, and all thoſe great Bookes which come to vs from the North, bringing cold weather and froſts along with them. I aſſure you the Preſident of THOV, who was as worthy a Iudge of Latine Eloquence, as of the life and fortunes of men; and who had left an exact Hiſtory behind him, had he pleaſed to retract ſome things; made no ſmall eſteeme of theſe my Countrey-men: But I cannot as yet conceiue what cauſed him to affect certaine wits ſo contrary to his

owne, and who neuer were acquainted, nor did ſo much as dreame of that Roman purity, you purſue with ſo great ſcrupuloſity and exact diligence. You will let theſe men ſee I aſſure my ſelfe; yea, and thoſe wiſe Tranſalpines themſelues likewiſe, who thinke all ſuch to be Scythians who are not Jtalians, euen in what faſhion they ſpake in Auguſtus his age, yea and in a time more cleare from the corruption of good cuſtomes. In a word, beſides the propriety of termes, and chaſtity of Stile, which lendeth a luſter to your elaborate Writings, your conceits are ſo ſublime, and ſo full of courage, that it is very probable the ancient Republicke of Rome was adorned with the like, at what time it was victorious ouer the World, and when the Senate conceiued inſemblable tearmes, the Commandments they preſcribed to greateſt Princes, and the anſwers it addreſſed to all Nations on earth: I will ſpeake further, when you appeare where I expect you; and where inſtead of Flowers, Fruites, and

                  Shades, which I prepare for you, I hope to receiue from you all the Riches of Art and Nature. In the interim (to vſe my Lord the Cardinall d'Oſſats tearme) I bid you good night, and let you know, that if you ſeeke excuſes not to come, I am no longer

               LETTER XVI.
               
                  SIR,
               
               I was vpon the point not to haue written any more vnto you, and to haue contented my ſelfe in ſending you ſingle commendations, ſince I ſee my Letters

procure you enemies: and for that you are in dayly conteſtation for defending them; if therefore you deſire continuance of our conference in this kinde, liue hence-forward repoſedly, and reconcile your ſelfe to choice Wits, from whom I ſhould bee ſorry you ſhould ſeparate your ſelfe for my ſake; it is farre better to conceale a ſmall truth, then to diſturbe a generall peace; and I ſhould hold my Eloquence as pernicious as the perfections of Helena, ſhould it prooue any cauſe of your quarrels. Since there haue beene found men who haue carped at the Worlds compoſure, and ſpied ſpots in the Sunne, it is very likely inferiour things cannot be more perfect; and that there is nothing ſo abſolutely approued, againſt which there hath not beene ſome thing diſputed, and certayne weake Reaſons alledged. I confeſſe I write as men build Temples and Pallaces, and that I ſometimes fetch my materials a farre oft; as wee are to make a

voyage of two thouſand Leagues, to tranſport the Treaſures of America into Spaine. But if Pearles be not precious becauſe they grow not in the ſands of Seine; or if in what I doe, ſome condemne me, it ſufficeth that I am not of their minde; if the worſt come, I appeale to my Lord the Cardinall of Richelieu, of whoſe approbation I eſteeme more, then of popular fauour, or applauſe of Theaters. It is long ſince I vnderſtood from him that I exceeded others; not excepting euen thoſe who ſtriue to aſpire to a kind of tyranny, and to vſurpe a more abſolute authority ouer wits, then is either lawfull or reaſonable. This being ſo, I ſhould much wrong that Great perſon, on whoſe bookes God hath placed the Truth we ſeeke after, as well as the Eloquence all of vs imagine wee haue attayned ſhould I digreſſe from his opinion, to regard what foure or fiue of thoſe compoſers of Romands of the Roſe ſay, who haue no other language but Legends: if

I would content my ſelfe with my infant conceptions, or determined to write as an honeſt Woman ſhould ſpeake, they would happily finde their owne facility in my Workes: though truely if I take any paines therein, I aſſure myſelfe they will ſooner ghèſſe at, then gaine my conceptions. But truely, he who purpoſeth to himſelfe the Idea of perfection, and who labours for Eternity, ought not to let any thing eſcape his Pen, till after long and ſerious conſultation with himſelfe. Yet will I tell you, and all the World may eaſily vnderſtand, that my writings ſmel more of Muske and Amber, then of Oyle or ſweate; whereas out of that great labouriouſneſſe they ſo much frame to themſelues, there will infallibly ariſe obſcurity, which none but the Blind can taxe me with▪ But as for thoſe fellowes, it is alwayes night with them, and they are rather to accuſe their mothers of their defects, and not colours or the light: I indeauour (in what I may) to make all

my conceptions popular, and to be intelligable among women and children, euen when I ſpeake of things beyond their Capacity: but if your friends ſuppoſe certayne of my conceits to be ouer-farre fetcht, let them throughly obſerue, whither they tranſcend my ſubiect, or their conceptions; or whither I goeaſtray, or they looſe ſight of me: There are diuers things aboue reaſon, which yet are not contrary thereto. An Heroicall vertue making vſe of exceſſes and highth of paſſions, goeth as farre beyond vulgar Vertue, as it ſurmounteth Vice: we are not therefore to ſhut vp all Wits within the ſame limits, nor preſently to cenſure that as Exorbitant, which is only extraordinary: Otherwiſe we ſhould reſemble that poore Noruegian, who the firſt time he ſaw Roſes, durſt not touch them for feare of burning his fingers, and was much amazed to ſee (as he ſuppoſed) Trees to beare fire: Surely as Nouelty is not of force to make Monſters well featured, ſo ought it not

to hinder our affections to excellent things, though vnknowne vnto vs. If for the vnderſtanding my language, it were neceſſary to learne two; or that Anxietie, Decrepitude, and the Irritaments of Deſpaire, were familiar phraſes with me; if I made vſe of Waues inſtead of Water, and euill Fates for ill fortune; or the Flower-do-luce for France; to the end to play the Poet in Proſe; ſhould I immolate my ſelfe to publique ſcorne, and ſayle vpon the Ocean in the ſtormaticall ſeaſons of the yeare, if I ſhould ſay, the miſericordious Juſtice of God, and his inſt Miſericord; or plucke compariſons from Pliny; and could I not commend a King without the helpe of Alexander the Great, and Plutarckes Worthies; if inſtead of well-ſpeaking, I ſhould tranſlate Tacicus ill, and if in ſpite of him I ſhould force him to deliuer his Opinion concerning all the affaires of this Age, you then might rightly blame me frō bringing follies ſo far off, &amp; for taking ſo much paines to make my ſelfe ridiculous. But ſurely I ſhould be the moſt

innocent of all others, had I onely offended therein; and I may ſafely ſay without vanity, that euen the follies of my Jnfancy, were more ſerious then thoſe ſweete Rbetoricall flowers: when all is ſayd, ſince there is nothing but Religion can force vs to belecue what ſhee pleaſeth, and that Kings themſelues haue no power ouer Soules, I am well ſatisfied with the affection of my Friends, and doe willingly leaue their iudgements free to themſelues. One Good-night is more worth then all our Eloquence, and not to know the miſeries of this life▪ is to be more learned then the Sorboniſts and leſſits. For my part, (deſpiſing the world as I doe) I cannot much eſteeme my ſelfe, who make vp one of the ſicklieſt parts thereof; and I haue ſo poore an opinion of my owne ſufficiency, as I little eſteeme the Talents of others: Thinke not then, I adore the workemanſhip of my hands, though I take as much paines therein, as did the ancient Caruers, in counterfeiting their gods. Butcontrariwiſe, it is

the reaſon why I diſlike them, and had I beene a man of ten thouſand Crownes rent, I would haue giuen the halfe of it to a Secretary, onely to hire him not to indite thoſe Letters you haue ſo much admired.

               LETTER I.
               
                  My LORD:
               
               
                  VVHilſt you imploy your houres in gayning hearts and Votes, and happily lay the foundation of ſome eminent enterprize: I here enioy a repoſedneſſe

not vnlike that of the dead, and which is neuer rouzed but by Clorinda's kiſſes. If the Duke of Oſſona be choſen King of Naples, (as you write the report runneth) I finde no ſtrangeneſſe in it. The world is ſo old, and hath ſeene ſo much, it can hardly ſpie any new matter; nor is there at this day any lawfull authority whoſe Origin (for the moſt part) hath not beene vniuſt. And on the other ſide the ill ſucceſſe of reuolts are far more frequent then are the change of States: and the ſame action which hath no leſſe then a Diademe for the ayme, hath often an ignominious death for its end. Howſoeuer this happens, it ſhall not much trouble me ſince the iſſue cannot be other then aduantagious to this State. For God herein will either make it appeare, that he is the protector of Kings: or it falling out otherwiſe, yet at leaſt it will weaken the enemies to this Crowne. But I hope you will not aduiſe me to beat my braines vpon thoſe

politique conſiderations; for ſhould I doe ſo▪ it were no leſſe then to retract the reſolution I haue taken, to looke vpon things paſſing among vs and our neighbours, as I doe on the Hiſtory of Japon, or the affaires of another World. I ought to ſurrender this humour to vulgar ſpirits, who intereſt themſelues in all the quarrels of States and Princes, and who will alwayes be parties, on purpoſe to put themſelues into choler, and bee miſerable in the misfortunes of others. Truely we ſhall neuer haue done if we will needes take all the affaires of the world to heart, and be paſſionate for the publique; whereof wee make but a very ſmall part. It may be at this very inſtant wherein I write, the great Indian Fleete ſuffereth ſhipwracke within two Leagues of Land: happily the great Turke hath ſurpriſed ſome Prouince from the Chriſtians, and taken thence ſome twenty thouſand ſoules, to conuey them to their Citty of Conſtantinople: It may be

the Sea hath exceeded its limits, and drowned ſome Citty in Zealand. If we ſend for miſchiefes ſo farre off, there will not an houre paſſe wherein ſome diſconſolation or other will not come vpon vs. If we hold all the men in the world to be of our affinity, let vs make account to weare Mournings all our life. As mine experience is not great, ſo are my yeares not many: yet ſince I came into the world, I haue ſeene ſo many ſtrange accidents, and haue vnderſtood from my father ſuch ſtore of incredible occurrents, as I ſuppoſe there can nothing now happen, able to cauſe admiration in me. The Emperour Charles the fiſt his Grand-child, borne to the hopes of ſo many Kingdomes, was condemned to death, for hauing ouer-ſoone deſired them. The naturall ſubiects of the King of Spaine doe at this day diſpute with him for the Empire of the Sea; nor will they reſt ſatisfied with their vſurped liberty. Surely wee ſhould hardly bee

drawne to beleeue theſe things vpon the credit of others, and thoſe in ſucceeding ages will with much difficulty bee perſwaded to receiue them for truths; yet are theſe the ordinary recreations of Fortune, taking pleaſure in deceiuing Mankinde, by euents farre oppoſite to all appearance; yea, and contrary to their iudgements. Hath ſhee not deliuered ouer to the peoples fury, the man whom ſhe had formerly rayſed aboue the reſt, to the end, we ſhould not preſume in greateſt Proſperities? And hath ſhe not at the ſame time taken out of the Baſtile, a Priſoner, to make him Generall of a Royall Army, thereby to oblige vs not at any time to deſpaire? I do here conſider all this with a repoſed ſpirit, and as Fables preſented on the Stage; or Pictures in a Gallery. Now ſince the late Comet had like to haue beene as fatall vnto me, as to the Emperour Rodolphus, in that my curioſity to ſee it, cauſed me to riſe in my ſhirt, which gaue me a cold all the Winter after. I am heereafter

reſolued not to meddle with any thing aboue my reach; but to referre all to GOD and Nature. So as Clorinda ſuffer me to ſerue her, and that I vnderſtand from her owne mouth that ſhe loues me, I will hearken to no other newes, nor ſearch a ſecond Fortune. I therefore moſt humbly beſeech your Lordſhip to excuſe me, if vpon theſe occaſions lately preſented, I cannot affoord you my perſonall attendance, or refuſe to follow you whither your reſolution leades you; my Miſtreſſe hauing commanded me, to render her an account how I ſhed my bloud, and enioyning me neuer to goe to the Warres, but when Muskets are charged with Cypres-powder; I am rather contented you ſhould accuſe mee of Cowardize, then ſhe iuſtly to charge mee with Diſobedience. And after all this tell me whether or no, you thinke me to be in my right wits, and that I haue not loſt my reaſon, together with the reſpect I owe you. I herein doe as a delinquent; who fearing he ſhould not be ſoone enough puniſhed,

puts himſelfe into the hands of Juſtice, not ſtaying eyther for the Racke, or examination of Iudges, for the diſcouery of a crime whereof he was neuer accuſed. I am well aſſured, that of all paſſions, you haue onely thoſe of Honour and Glory, and that your Spirits are ſo repleniſhed therewith, as there is no place left eyther for loue, hate, or feare. Yet doe I withall conſider, that it is a part of a wiſe mans felicity to reflect vpon other mens follies: howſoeuer, if any word hath eſcaped me which may offend your eyes, take it I beſeech you, as a meanes ſent you from God for your farther mortification, in cauſing you to read things ſo diſtaſtefull vnto you. You are neceſſarily to endure farre greater croſſes amidſt the corruption of this Age: if you cannot liue among the wicked, you muſt ſeeke for another kinde of world then this, and for more perfect creatures then Mortals. There will euer be poyſnings beyond the Alpes, Treaſons at Court, and reuolts in this Realme. Howſoeuer

(my Lord) there will be loue euen in ſpite of you, ſo long as there are eyes and beauties in the world; yea, the Wiſe themſelues will loue, if they finde Clorindaes, Dianaes, and Caſſandraes to be beloued. Fire ſeazeth ſomtimes on Churches and Pallaces. God hath framed Fooles and Philoſophers of one and the ſame matter: And that cruell Sect which ſeekes to bereaue vs of the one halfe of our ſelues, in ſeeking to free vs from our paſſions and affections, inſtead of making a wiſe man, haue onely raiſed a Statue. I muſt therefore once againe tell you that I loue, ſince Nature will haue it ſo; and that I am of the progeny of our firſt Parent: but I muſt withall informe you, that all my affections ſpring not from the diſtempers and diſeaſes of my ſoule; my inclination to ſerue you, hauing immortall reaſon, not momentary pleaſure for its foundation, one day happily I ſhall no more be amorous, but will alwayes remayne
               
                  My Lord,
                   Your moſt humble and moſt affectionate Seruant, BALZAC.
               
            
            
               
               To the Lord Cardinall of Valete, Sonne to the Duke of Eſpernon.
               LETTER II.
               
                  My LORD;
               
               AT length they haue done you right, and you now enioy what you deſerued from the firſt day of your Natiuity: if there could bee any thing added to a man who reckoneth Kings among his Predeceſſors, and whoſe inclinations happily are ouer-great to liue vnder the power of another; I ſhould aduiſe you to reioyce at this newes; but being extracted as you are, from one of the moſt illuſtrious▪ Origines on earth, and begotten by a Father, whoſe life is loaden with Miracles; it ſufficeth that you pardon Fortune, ſince it hath ſo happned that preſent neceſſity hath gained of her what ſhe in right owed to your name. I know well that ſome will tell you, you

are created Prince of ſuch an Eſtate, as is bounded neither by Seas nor Mountaines, and how the extent of your iuriſdiction is ſo illimitable, as were there many worlds, they ought all of them to depend thereon as well as this. But I who ſuffer not mine eyes to be dazeled by any other luſter then that of Vertue, and who doe not ſo much as beſtow the looking on, what moſt men admire; if I ſhould eſteeme you either more great, or happy then you were, I ſhould not haue ſufficiently profited vnder you, in the true vnderſtanding of you. Doubtleſſe in the opinion of the Vulgar, it is an extraordinary Honour to be a prime perſon in a Ceremony, and to weare a Hat of equal eſteeme to Crownes and Diadems. Yet I preſume you will pardon mee if I make bold to tell you, it is an honour can neuer oblige a wiſe man to enuy you. For had you this point onely aboue me, I ſhould ſtill be my owne Maſter: Nor had I for your ſake renounced that liberty,

which was as deare to mee as the Common-wealth of Venice. Vpon the matter, to haue none other Iudge on Earth ſaue onely your reputation and conſcience, and to haue a great trayne of followers, ſome whereof are imployed in the procuring your ſpirituall pleaſures, others in the conduct of your temporall affaires, all this ſhal be ſtill the ſame with you, and diuers others whom you ſlight; but to performe good and vertuous actions, when you are aſſured they ſhall neuer come to the worlds eye; to feare nothing but diſhoneſt things; to beleeue death to bee neither good nor bad in it ſelfe; but that if the occaſion to imbrace it be honourable, it is alwayes more valuable then a long life: to haue the reputation of integrity in your promiſes, in a time when the moſt credulous haue enough to doe, to confide on publique faith: This is it which I admire in you my Lord; and not your Red Hat, and your fifty thouſand Crownes Rent; yet

I will ſay, that for the honour of Rome, you ought to eſteeme of what ſhe ſends you. The time hath bin when ſhe would haue erected Statues for you, and affoorded you ſufficient ſubiect to haue merited Tryumphs: but thoſe dayes being paſt, and ſince that Empire is no longer maintayned by ſuch meanes, yet ought you to reſt ſatisfied with the honours of Peace, and accept (as a high fauour) a Dignity the King of Spaine's Sonne hath made ſuite for. If there were nothing elſe in it, but that it cauſeth you to quit your Mourning-robes, to reueſt your ſelfe with the colour of Roſes, you can doe no leſſe then reioyce at ſuch a change. Howſoeuer the neareſt obiects to your eyes, will not be ſo dolefull as formerly they were, ſince there will be nothing vpon you which ſhall not be reſplendent and glorious. I would willingly dilate this diſcourſe, but the ſpeedy departure of the Poſt will not ſuffer me; and beſides, I being well aſſured,

that if you eſteeme any thing in my Letters, it is not the multitude of words; I ought to be contented to end this, after my humble ſuite vuto you, to loue me alwayes, ſince I am paſſionately
               
                  My Lord,
                   Your moſt humble, moſt obedient, and moſt faithfull ſeruant BALZAC.
               
            
            
               
               To the Lord Cardinall de Valette▪ from Balzac.
               J here ſend you two Letters which were deliuered mee, to bee conueyed vnto you, the one from the Duke of Bauaria, the other from the Cardinall of Lerma. My Lord, you ſhall thereby perceiue that your propoſition hath affoorded ioy, both to the Victorious, and to the Afflicted; and that the World receiueth a notable intereſt therein, ſince it augmenteth the contentment of Triumphes, and ſweetneth the harſhnes of retyrement.
               
                  
                     LETTER. III.
                     
                        MY LORD:
                     
                     I Suppoſe you haue vnderſtood of the Election of the Pope, ſome two dayes iournies from Paris; and that you will make no great haſt to adde your approbation to a thing already diſpatched: I had ſent a Post on purpoſe to aduertiſe you thereof; but my Lord Embaſſador thought

it not fit, but hath encharged his owne Meſsenger to aduertiſe you of all things, in your Voyage this way, and to giue you accompt of all occurrents. This makes me thinke that the ſubiect of your voyage ceaſing, and the time of yeare being as yet ſome what troubleſome, for the vndertaking thereof, you will rather reſerue it for a fitter ſeaſon, when you may performe it with leſſe diſorder, and more aduantagiouſly for the Kings ſeruice. My meaning is, that I would haue you ſet forward about the end of Autumne, that you may ſpend here with vs, one of theſe warm and ſpringing Winters, laden with Roſes, wholy reſerued for our admirable Italy. And my Lord, though herein the conſideration of my priuate intereſt may ſeeme to make me ſpeake thus, rather then my affection to your ſeruice; yet would I willingly tell you, that all kinde of contentments attend you here, and if your great Spirit aſpire to glorious things for the keeping it in action, it ſhall infallibly finde

them at Rome. In the interim, how ſhort a while ſoeuer you ſtay here, you ſhall haue the contentment to ſee France change ſome fiue or ſixe times. At your returne you will hardly find any thing anſwerable to what you left there; they ſhall not be the ſame men you formerly ſaw, and all things will appeare vnto you, as the affaires of another Kingdome. But before the matter be growne to that head, it is fitting you reigne here in Soueraignty, and become the Supreame Iudge of three or foure Conclaues: And truly it might ſo happen (my Lord) that I ſhould do you ſome acceptable ſeruice in thoſe great occaſions, if I had my health; but to my great griefe it is a happineſſe, for which I enuy my Grand mother, and howſoeuer I haue heretofore beene little, or much eſtimable: I confeſſe, that at this preſent, I am but the halfe of what I was. It is therefore in vayne to expect workes of any great value from me, or that you importune me to take paynes for the Publicke; for in Conſcience
                        
what high defignes can a man haue, betweene the affliction of diſeaſes, and the apprehenſion of Death? The one whereof doth neuer forſake me, and the other daily affrights me; or how can you imagine I ſhould conceiue eminent matters, who am ready to dye at euery inſtant. True it is, that the neceſſity to obey you, which I haue alwaies before mine Eyes, is an extraordinary ſtrong motiue; but (not to diſſemble) the impoſſibility of my performance is yet more forcible; and ſo long as I continue in the ſtate I now am, I can not promiſe you ſo much as the Hiſtory of the Kingdome ofA little Principality in France.

                        From Rome 
                           this 27. of February 1622.
                        
                     
                  
               
            
            
               
               Another Letter vnto Cardinall de la Valete from Balzac.
               
               LETTER IIII.
               
                  My LORD,
               
               YOur Caſh-keeper hath newly brought mee the ſumme you commanded him to deliuer vnto me. I would willingly ſhew ſufficient thankefulneſſe for this high fauour: but beſides that your benefits are boundleſſe, and that you are ſo gracious an obliger, that it doth euen augment the value of your Bounty, I ſhould ſeeme ouer preſumptuous to thinke any words of mine valuable to the leaſt of your actions. It ſhall therefore ſuffice me to proteſt vnto you, that the bounty wherewith the Letter I receiued from you, is ſo ſtored; (being of force to infuſe Loue and Fidelity in the hearts of very Barbarians,) ſhall worke no leſſe effect in the ſpirit of a perſon

who hath learned both by Nature and Philoſophy not to be ingratefull. Since I finde my intereſt within my duty, I muſt neceſſarily loue you (if I hate not my ſelfe) and be an honeſt man by the very Maxime of the wicked. Yet is not this laſt conſideration the cauſe chiefly obliging me to your ſeruice: For though I acknowledge diuers defects in my ſelfe, yet may I without vanity affirme, I was neuer beſotted with ſo baſe an attraction as that of gaine. I therefore reflect vpon your fauours in their naked purity, and the eſteeme you make of me, is to me by ſo much a more ſtrong obligation then all others, in that it regardeth my merit, and not my inſtant pouerty, and proceedeth from your iudgement which is farre more excellent, then your fortunes are eminent. Herein (my Lord) it is manifeſt, that all your inclinations are magnificent: for you knowing me neither to be fit to make the Father of a Family, nor to ſolicite cauſes

at the Counſell-table, nor well to ride poſt: you make it appeare, you are of the right blood of Kings, who are onely rich in ſuperfluous things. Truely it were a hard matter to gueſſe what in this world is the true vſe of Pearles and Diamonds; or why a Picture ſhould coſt more then a Pallace; but onely pleaſure: which to ſatisfie the inuentions of Art, are dayly imployed, and Nature to that end produceth whatſoeuer is rare, being indeede a thing more noble then neceſſity, ſhee being contented with ſmall matters, euer preferring profit beſore pleaſure. And I will here ſtop, leſt I ſpeake too much to my owne aduantage: And if I haue already incurred that crime, I beſeech you to beleeue it hath not beene with purpoſe to praiſe my ſelfe, but onely to extoll your liberality: Yet will I make bold to acquaint you, how I imploy your money, and yeelde you a more particular account of the affaires I diſpatch for you here at Rome:
                  
Firſt, in this hot Moneth I ſeeke all poſſible remedies againſt the violence of the Sunne. I haue a Fanne which wearieth the hands of foure Groomes, and raiſeth a winde in my Chamber which would cauſe ſhipwracke in the maine Sea; I neuer die but I dye Snow in the Wine of Naples, and make it melt vnder Mellons. I ſpend halfe my time vnder water, and the reſt on Land: I riſe twice a day, and when I ſtep out of my bed, it is onely to enter into a Groue of Orangetrees, where I ſlumber with the pleaſant purling of ſome twelue Fountaines: but if occaſion be offered to goe further once in a Weeke, I croſſe not the ſtreet but in Carroach, paſſing ſtill in the ſhade betweene Heauen and Earth: I leaue the ſmell of ſweeteſt flowers vnto the Vulgar, as hauing found the inuention to eate and drinke them. The Spring▪time neuer parts with me all the yeare either in variety of diſtilled Waters, or in Conſerues. I change perfumes according to

the diuerſity of Seaſons; ſome I haue ſweeter, others ſtronger: And though the Ayre be a thing Nature beſtowes for nothing, and whereof the pooreſt haue plenty, yet that, I breath in my Chamber, is as coſtly vnto mee as my houſerent. Beſides all this, I in quality of my Lord your Agent, am almoſt daily feaſted: and there whileſt others fill themſelues with ſubſtantiall and moſt ponderous cates; I who haue no great appetite, make choice of ſuch Birds as are crammed with Sugar, and nouriſh my ſelfe with the ſpirit of Fruites, and with a meate called felly. My Lord, theſe are all the ſeruices I yeeld you in this place, and all the functions of my reſidence neare his holineſſe; and I hold my ſelfe particularly obliged now the ſecond time to thanke you for this fauour: for by your meanes I enioy two things ſeldome ſuiting together; a Maſter and Liberty; and the great reſt you allow mee, is not the leaſt preſent you

pleaſe out of your Nobleneſſe to affoord me.
               
                  Your Graces moſt humble, moſt obedient, and moſt faithfull ſeruant, BALZAC. 
                  From Rome 
                     the 15. of Iuly, 1621.
                  
               
            
            
               To the Lord Cardinall de Valete from BALZAC.
               
               LETTER V.
               
                  My Lord,
               
               VVIthin the Deſerts of Arabia, nor in the Seas intrailes, was there euer ſo furious a Monſter found, as is the Scyatica: And if Tyrants whoſe memories are hatefull vnto vs, had beeneſtored with ſuch inſtruments for effecting their cruelties; ſurely I thinke it had beene the Scyatica the Martyres had indured for Religion, and not the fire, and biting of wild Beaſts. At euery ſting it

carries a poore ſicke perſon euen to the borders of the other World, and cauſeth him ſenſible to touch the extremities of life. And ſurely, to ſupport it long, a greater remedy then Patience is no leſſe then requiſite, and other forces then thoſe of man▪ In the end GOD hath ſent me ſome caſe, after the receite of an infinite of remedies, ſome whereof ſharpned my griefe, and the reſt aſſwaged it not. But the violence of my payne being now paſt, I beginne to enioy ſuch reſt, as wearineſſe and weakeneſſe affoordeth to ouer-tired bodies. And though I be in a ſtate of health, farre leſſe perfect then thoſe who are ſound, yet meaſuring it by the proximity of the miſery I haue indured, and the compariſon of thoſe paines I haue ſuffered: I am right glad of my preſent Fortune, nor am I ſo hardy, to dare as yet complayne of my great weakneſſe remaining. To ſpeake truth, J haue no better legges then will ſerue to make a ſhew; and ſhould I vndertake to walke the length of my Chamber,

my trouble would be no leſſe, then if I were to paſſe the Mountaines, and croſſe all Riuers I encounter. But, to the end to change Diſcourſe, and to let you ſee things in their faire ſhape; you are to vnderſtand that in this plight wherein J ſtand, (being ſufficient to cauſe you to pitty me foure hundred Leagues off:) J am on the one ſide become ſo valiant, as not to flie though I were purſued by a whole Army; and on the other▪ ſo ſtately, that if the Pope ſhould come to viſite me, I would not conduct him ſo far as the Gates. This is the aduantage I draw from my bad legges, and the remedies ariſing in my bed, wherewith I endeauour to comfort my ſelfe without the helpe of Phiſicke. You will (I feare) ſay I might well haue forborne to entertaine you with theſe impertinencies; nor am I ignorant that perfect felicities, ſuch as yours, deſire not to be diſquieted either by the complaints of the diſtreſſed, or by the conſideration of diſtaſtefull things: But it is likewiſe true,

that the firſt loſſe we indure in paine, fals vpon our iudgement, and the body hath ſuch a proximity with the ſoule, that the miſeries of the one, doe eaſily ſlide into the other. But what reaſon ſoeuer I haue to defend my euill humour, yet muſt it neceſſarily giue way to your contentment; and of the two paſſions wherewith I am aſſaulted, obey the ſtronger. I will therefore be no longer ſad but for others, and will hold it fit I make you laugh vpon the ſubiect of XXXXX▪
                   to whom you lately addreſſed your Letters. You may pleaſe to remember one of their Names to be A. the other B; yet is it not ſufficient onely to know ſo much, but I muſt likewiſe informe you ſomewhat of their ſhape and ſtature. The firſt I ſpeake of, is ſo groſſe, as I verily thinke he will inſtantly dye of an Apoplexcy; and the other ſo little, as I would ſweare that ſince he came into the world▪ hee neuer grew but at the haires end: afore any indifferent Iudges, an Ape

would ſooner paſſe for a man then this Pigmy; nor will I beleeue he was made after the image of God, leſt therein I ſhould wrong ſo excellent a Nature. Beſides, it were an eaſier taske to raiſe the Dead, then to make this mans Teeth white; he hath a Noſe at enmity with all others: and againſt which there is no poſſible defence but Spaniſh Gloues. What can I ſay more, there is no part of his body that is not ſhamefull, or wherein Nature hath not beene defectiue. Yet notwithſtanding one of the faireſt Princeſſes of Italy, is by a ſolemne contract condemned to lodge night by night with this Monſter. When you chance to ſee this man together with the other great bellied beaſt, who ſtuffes a whole Carroach, you will preſently ſuppoſe God neuer made them to be Princes; and that it is not onely as much as to abuſe the obedience of free perſons, but euen to wrong the meaneſt Groomes, to giue them Maſters of this ſtampe. Now

though the party you wot of, doe in ſome ſort repreſent the latter perſon, yet is there ſtill ſome ſmall difference betweene his actions and the others. The great V V V. is newly parted from this Court, where he hath not receiued from his Holineſſe his expected contentment. His deſigne was to breake the Mariage his Brother hath contracted, vpon ſome ſlight appearance of Sorcery, wherewith he deemed to dazle the worlds eye, and ground the nullity of an action, which was by ſo much the more free, in that the parties who performed it, ſought not the conſent of any to approue it. In concluſion after the loſſe of much time, and many words, he is gone without obtayning any thing, ſaue onely the Popes benediction; and as for me, I remayne much ſatisfied to ſee Iuſtice ſo exact at Rome, that they will not condemne the Diuell himſelfe wrongfully. I haue heard how in ſome places halfe houre Mariages are made, the conditions whereof are

neither diſgeſted into writing, nor any memory thereof reſerued; but of theſe ſecret myſteries, there are no other witneſſes, ſaue onely the Night and Silence: And though the Court of Rome approueth them not, yet doth ſhee ſhut her eyes, fearing to ſee them. I am reſolued not to bee long in the deſcription of K K K, whom you know much better then my ſelfe: Yet thus much I will ſay, that ſince Neroes death, there neuer appeared in Jtaly a Comedian of more honourable extraction: And ſurely to make the Company at this preſent in France compleate; this perſonage were ſufficient: He makes Verſes, he hath read Ariſtotle, and vnderſtands Muſicke, and in a word he hath all the excellent qualities vnneceſſary in a Prince. I know here a German called S. to whom hee giueth a annuall penſion of a thouſand Crownes, aſſigned vnto him vpon an Abbey during life; this he hath done, not that he intendeth to vſe his ſeruice in his

counſell, or with purpoſe to imploy him in any important negotiation for the good of his affaires: his onely ambition is to haue him make a booke, whereby it might appeare how thoſe of M M M, are lineally deſcended from Iulius Caeſar. I ſhould be glad he would yet aime at ſome higher, or more eminent race, and that hee would purchaſe a ſecond fable at the like rate he payed for the firſt. I would willingly giue him his choice of the Medes, Perſians, Greekes, or Troians, which of theſe he would haue of his Kindred, and without the relying vpon the authority of tradition or teſtimony of Stories: I would draw his deſcent from Hector, or Achilles, which hee beſt liked. There are certaine Princes who are neceſſarily to be deceiued, if you meane to doe them acceptable ſeruice, being far better pleaſed to bee entertayned with a plauſible lye, then to be aduertiſed of an important truth. I hold my ſelfe right happy you are not of this humour: for whatſoeuer I ſay, I ſuppoſe it would bee

very hard for me to be of a fooles minde, though he were a Monarch. Iintend not to ſteale your fauours, but to purchaſe them legally: and hauing euer beleeued flattery to bee as miſchieuous a meanes to gaine affection as charmes, and ſorcery: I cannot ſpeake againſt my conſcience, and were not this true I tell you, I would not aſſure you that I am
               
                  Your moſt humble, moſt obedient, and moſt faithfull ſeruant, BALZAC. 
                  From Rome 
                     this 10. of December 1622.
                  
               
            
            
               To the Lord Cardinall de Valete, from Balzac.
               LETTER VI.
               
                  My LORD▪
                  
               
               HOw great ſoeuer the ſubiect of my ſorrows be, yet doe I finde in your Letters ſufficient to make mee happy

in my hard fortune. The laſt I receiued hath ſo much obliged mee, that, but for the diſpleaſing newes comming vnto me which tempered my ioy, my reaſon had not beene of ſufficient force to moderate it. But at this time the death of my poore Brother▪being inceſſantly before mine eyes, taketh from me the taſte of all good tidings: and the proſperity euen of the Kings affaires ſeeme diſpleaſing vnto mee, finding my ſelfe to beare vpon mee the mournings of his Victory. Yet ſince in this fatall agitation of Europe, it is not I alone who bewayle ſome loſſe, and ſince your ſelfe haue not beene able to preſerue all that was deare vnto you; I ſhould ſeeme very vnciuill, if I preſumed to preferre my priuate intereſt before yours, or reflect vpon my particular affliction, hauing one common with yours. It is long ſince I haue not meaſured either the felicities or fatalities of this world, but by your contentments, or diſcomforts; and that I behold you as the whole workmanſhip God

hath made. Wherefore my Lord, I will lay aſide whatſoeuer concernes my ſelfe, to enter into your reſentments, and to tell you, ſince you cannot make vnworthy elections, it muſt needes be that in the death of your Friends you can ſuffer no ſmall loſſes. Notwithſtanding as you tranſcend ſublimary things, and in that all men draw examples out of the meaneſt actions of your life: I aſſure my ſelfe they haue acknowledged vpon this occaſion, that there is not any accident to ſurmount againſt which you haue vſe of all your vertue. Afflictions are the gifts of God, though they be not of thoſe we deſire in our prayers; and ſuppoſing you ſhould not approue this propoſition, yet haue you at all times ſo little regarded death, as I cannot beleeue you will bewayle any; for being in a condition your ſelfe eſteemes not miſerable. My Lord, it ſufficeth you conſerue the memory of thoſe you haue loued, in conſequence of the proteſtation you pleaſed

to make vnto me by your Letter: And truly if the Dead be any thing, (as none can doubt) they cannot grieuefor ought in this world, wherein they ſtill enioy your fauours. In the meane time I take this to my ſelfe, and am moſt happy in hauing conferred my dutifull affections vpon a man, who ſetteth ſo high a value vpon thoſe things he hath loſt. For any thing (my Lord) I perceiue, there is ſmall difference betweene good workes, and the ſeruices we offer you; they hauing their rewards both in this life, and the other; your goodneſſe being illimitable, as is the deſire I haue to tell you, I am
               
                  Your moſt humble and moſt faithfull Seruant, BALZAC. 
                  From Rome 
                     the 29. of December, 1621.
                  
               
            
            
               
               To the Lord Cardinall of Valete, from BALZAC.
               LETTER. VII.
               
                  MY LORD:
               
               THough I be not in ſtate either to performe any great exploite vpon the perſon of any man; nor haue any great force to defend my ſelfe, yet cannot I touch vpon the Count Mansfield without taking it to heart, and ioyning my good affections to the Kings forces. If this were the firſt time the Germans had exceeded their limits, and ſent their Armies to be ouerthr owne in France; the nouelty of theſe barbarous faces, and of thoſe great lubberly ſwatrutters, might eaſily haue affrighted vs: But vpon the matter, we haue to doe with knowne enemies, and who will ſuffer vs to take ſo ſufficient aduantages ouer them, beſides thoſe we naturally enioy, as without

being forced to make vſe of Armes, we may defeate them onely by their owne euill conduct. I doe not wonder there are men who willingly forſake Froſt and Snow, to ſeeke their liuing vnder a more pleaſing and temperate climate then their owne; and who quit bad Countreyes, as being well aſſured, the place of their baniſhment ſhall bee more bliſſefull vnto them then that of their birth. Onely herein it vexeth me, in the behalfe of the Kings honour, to ſee him conſtrayned to finiſh the remainder of the Emperours victories, vpon a ſort of beaten Souldiers, and who rather fly the fury of Marqueſse Spinola, then follow vs. Theſe great Bulwarks whoſe neighbour I am, ſeeming rather the Fabricks of Gyants, then the fortifications of a Garriſon-towne, will not euer be looked vpon with amazement; one day (I hope) there will appeare nothing in their places but Cabbins for poore Fiſhermen; or if it be requiſite the workes of Rebellion ſhould ſtill remaine, and the memory of theſe troubleſome

ſome people indure yet longer, we ſhall in the vpſhot ſee them remoue Mountaines, and diue into the Earths foundations to prouide themſelues a Priſon at their owne charge. But withall (my Lord) I beſeech you, let there be no further ſpeech made of occaſions or expeditions, and let a Peace be concluded which may continue till the Worlds end; let vs leaue the Warre to the Turke, and King of Perſia, and cauſe (I beſeech you) that wee may loſe the memory of theſe miſerable times, wherein Fathers ſucceed their Children, and wherein France is more the Countrey of Lansknights and Swiſſes then ours. Though Peace did not turne the very Deſarts into profitable dwellings as it doth, or cauſed not the quarries or flints to be come fruitfull, though it came vnaccompanied, without being ſeconded with ſecurity and plenty, yet were it neceſſary, onely to refreſh ourforces; thereby to enable vs the longer to endure Warre. As I was ending this laſt word, I heard a voyce which deſired my

diſpatch oblieging me to end what I ſuppoſed I had but begun. It is with much reluctation (my Lord) I am depriued of the onely contentment your abſence affordeth me. But ſince you could not receiue this Letter, were it any longer, J am reſolued to loſe one part of my content, to enioy the other; and to ſay ſooner then I ſuppoſed, that I am euer abſolutely
               
                  Your most humble, moſt obedient, and moſt faithfull ſeruant, BALZAC.

               To the Cardinall de Valette from BALZAC.
               
               LETTER VIII.
               
                  My LORD,
               
               YOu ſhould oftner receiue Letters from me, could I ouer-maſter my paine; but to ſay truth it leaueth me

not one thought free to reflect vpon any thing elſe; and what deſire ſoeuer I haue to giue you content, yet am I not able to doe any thing but at the Phyſitians good pleaſure, and at the Feauers leaſure; whileſt the Court affoordeth you all content, and prepareth whatſoeuer is pleaſant for you, reſeruing diſtruſts and iealouſies for others: I here endure torments, ſuch as wherewith one would make conſcience to puniſh Paricides, and which I would not wiſh to my worſt enemies. If notwithſtanding all this (in obedience to the Counſell you giue mee in the Letter you did me the honour to write vnto me) I ſhould make my ſelfe merry, I were neceſſarily to take my ſelfe for ſome other body, and become a deeper diſſembler then an honeſt man ought to be, My Melancholly is meerely corporeall, yet doth my ſpirit giue place, though not conſent thereto; and of the two parts whereof I am compoſed, the more worthy is ouer-borne by the

more weighty. Wherefore if the whole world ſhould act Comedies to make me laugh, and though St. Germans Faire were kept in all the ſtreets where I paſſe, the obiect of Death euer preſent before my eyes, bereauing me of ſight, would likewiſe barre mee of content, and I ſhould remaine diſconſolate amidſt the publique Iubilations. Yea, if the ſtone I▪
                   ſo much dread, were a Diamond, or the Philoſophers Elixa, I ſhould therein take ſmall comfort, but would rather beſeech God to leaue me poore, if he pleaſe to beſtow no better Riches vpon me. But when I haue ſayd all, be it vnto me as he ſhall pleaſe to appoint, ſince I am well aſſured, my maladiys will either end, or I ſhall not for euer hold out: yet ſhould I dye with ſome diſcontent, if it happen before I teſtifie my dutifull affection towards you, and the ſenſibility I haue of your noble fauours. But howſoeuer it fare with me, I would willingly make a iourney to Rome, there to finiſh the

worke I promiſed you, and which you commanded me to vndertake for the honour of this Crowne. Certainely if I be not the cauſe to make you in loue with our language, and to preferre it in your eſtimation before our neighbour Tongues; I am affraide you will be much troubled to reuolte from the Roman Empire, and that it will not be for the Hiſtory of Mathew, or of Hallian, you wil change that of Saluſt and Liuie. I will not deceiue you, nor delude my ſelfe; yet may I tell you, that my head is full of inuentions and deſignes, and if the Spring (for which I much long) would affoord me the leaſt glimpſe of health, I would conteſt with any who ſhould produce the rareſt things. I haue an infinite of looſe flowers, which onely want binding vp into Noſegayes: and I haue ſuffered others to ſpeake any time theſe ſixe yeares, on purpoſe to bethinke my ſelfe what I haue to ſay. But I well perceiue the publique ſhall haue onely deſires

and hopes; and truely if I ſpring not afreſh with the trees, in ſtead of ſo many bookes you expect from me, you ſhall not read any thing of mineſaue onely the end of this Letter, and the proteſtation I here make vnto you, to dye
               
                  Your moſt humble, moſt obedient, and moſt faithfull ſeruant, BALZAC.

               To the Lord Cardinall de Valete from BALZAC.
               
               LETTER IX.
               
                  My Lord,
               
               THe hope which any time this three Moneths, I haue had of your determination to come into this Countrey, hath hitherto hindred me from writing vnto you, or to make vſe of the onely meanes remayning for me to be neare your

perſon. But ſince you haue ſuppoſed the ſpeedy quitting the Court, to be as fatall as to dye a ſuddaine death, and that no leſſe fortitude or time is requiſite to reſolue to weane our ſelues from pleaſing things, then to ſurmount painefull ones, I will by your permiſſion reſume the commerce the common rumor cauſed me to ſurceaſe, and will not hereafter beleeue you can with any leſſe difficulty get out of Paris, then can the Arſenac or Loouer. Were it not a place all ſtored with inchantments and chaines, and which is of ſuch power to attract and retayne men, as it hath beene neceſſary to hazard diuers battailes, to driue the Spaniards further off: one might well wonder at the difficulty you finde to conuay your ſelfe thence. But in truth all the world doth there finde both habitations and affaires: and for you my Lord, ſince in that Countrey our Kings both enter into their firſt infancy, and grow old, as being the ſeate of their Empire; no man can iuſtly blame you for making ouerlong

abode there, without accuſing you of ouer much loue to your Maſter, and for deſiring to be neare his perſon. At Rome you ſhall tread vpon ſtones formerly the gods of Caeſar and Pompey, and ſhall contemplate the Ruines of thoſe rare workmanſhips, the antiquity whereof is yet amiable, and ſhall dayly walke among Hiſtories and Fables: But theſe are the paſtimes of weake ſpirits, which are pleaſed with trifles, and not the imployments of a Prince, who delighteth in ſayling on rough Seas, and who is not come into the world to let it reſt idle: When you haue ſeene the Tyber, on whoſe bankes the Romans haue performed the Apprentiſhips of their rare Victories, and begun that high deſigne, which they ended not but at the extreame limits of the Earth. When you ſhall aſcend the Capitol, where they ſuppoſed God was as well preſent as in Heauen; and had there incloſed the fatality of the vniuerſall Monarchy: After

you haue croſſed that great Circus, dedicated to ſhew pleaſures to the people, and where the blood of Martyrs hath beene often mingled with that of Malefactors and bruite beaſts. I make no doubt but after you haue ſeene theſe and diuers other things, you will grow weary of the repoſe and tranquility of Rome: and will ſay they are two things more proper for the Night and Church-yards, then for the Court and the Worlds eye. Yet haue I not any purpoſe to giue you the leaſt diſtaſte of a Voyage the King hath commanded you to vndertake, and whereof I well hoped to haue bin the guide, if my crazy body would haue ſeconded the motion of my Will. But truely my Lord, I am deepely ingaged in this buſineſſe, and when I looke vpon my ſelfe ſingle, I ſometimes haue a deſire to make you ſuſpicious of thoſe felicities, I feare, I ſhal not be able to enioy with you; yet whatſoeuer I ſay, I am not ſo farre in loue with my ſelfe▪, as to

preferre my priuate content before the generall deſires of all men, and the Churches neceſſities. It is requiſite for infinite conſiderations of importance, you ſhould be preſent at the firſt Conclaue, and that you appeare at a Warre not therefore leſſe conſiderable, in being compoſed of diſarmed perſons, or for that it makes no Widowes nor Orphans. I am certaine you haue elſewhere ſeene more dangerous encounters, and haue often deſired more bloudy Victories. But how great ſoeuer the obiect of your ambition be, yet can it not conceiue any thing of ſuch Eminency, as at once to giue a Succeſſor to Conſuls, to Emperours, and Apoſtles; and to make with your breath the man who ouer-toppeth Kings, and who commandeth ouer all reaſonable Soules: Though my health be ſo vncertaine, as I cannot promiſe my ſelfe three dayes continuance thereof, yet haue I not loſt all hope to ſee you (one day) in this Countrey, the preſcriber of Lawes to inferiours, and of examples to

Commanders. My Lord it may be, God reſerueth me for your ſake, that nothing be wanting to your Glory, and to the end there might be yet one man in the World, able to affoord you the prayſes proper to your merits.
               
                  My Lord,

                   Your moſt humble and moſt faithfull Seruant, BALZAC. 
                  
                     The 23. of Iune, 1623.
                  
               
            
            
               To my Lord Cardinall de la Valete.
               LETTER X.
               
                  My LORD,
               
               IT muſt neceſſarily be the greateſt Affaire at this preſent in agitation on Earth, that could oblige you to leaue Paris; nor had you patted thence vpon any ſlighter condition, then to make a Head for all Chriſtendome. If you arriue there

opportunely to haue your part in this great Election, and that the Conclaue attend your Preſence, on purpoſe to affoord a more full Reputation and Authority, to what ſhall there be reſolued vpon: I doe no way doubt but you will maintayne the ſame aduantage ouer the Italian wits, as you haue obtayned ouer ours; or that their policies will not be as impertinent in your Preſence, as the Charmes of Magicians are friuolous, being confronted with Diuine matters. You haue ſufficient of their patience to put off affaires when occaſion is offered: but you haue a courage they come ſhort of, to carry matters by ſtrong hand if neceſſity require. Therefore my Lord, to what part ſoeuer your Opinion ſhall incline, you will carry that with you which gaineth victories, and cauſeth the greater party to ſide with the ſounder; yea, if matters ſhould paſſe without conteſtation, yet ſhould you at leaſt take notice that you are intreated to that action, wherein God permits you to ſupply his place, and

intruſteth to your care the moſt important matter of all his Workes. To ſpeake ſeriouſly, his prouidence is neuer in ſo high imployment, as when hee is to chooſe the man who hath power to vſe well, or abuſe all the Riches of Heauen, and who is to exerciſe a power neareſt approaching to Diuinity. Heretofore God made vſe of Thunder and tempeſts, when he purpoſed to denounce any thing to men, declaring his Will by other then ordinary meanes. But ſince hee hath cauſed Oracles to ceaſe, and ſuffereth the Thunder to worke only naturall effects: It is onely by the voyce of Cardinals hee cauſeth his deſires to bee manifeſted, and ordayneth concerning the worlds Conduct. When you pleaſe (my good Lord) I ſhall haue ſome notice of theſe inſpirations hee hath ſent you, and of the election you haue made: For to force me (ſo ſoone) to informe my ſelfe thereof in the place where it was performed, this Kingdome had neede

be ouer hot for me, and that I were not ſo well acquainted as I am with the Sun at Rome. That which blackes the Moores, and burnes Lybia, is not ſo dangerous at this Seaſon; and were you not ſtored with treaſures of Snow, and prouided of Halls of Marble, to defend you from the ſcorching Ayre, I ſhould as ſoone chuſe to be condemned to the fire, as to be forced to reſide where you are at this preſent. But your Grace I know can not be affrighted with all theſe apprehenſions of heate; you are none of thoſe who will finde fault with the Ayre, which all that ancient Republicke breathed, or with the Sunne, which hath holpen to make ſo many Conquerours, and giuen light to ſo many glorious Tryumphs. Yet for my part, I who haue none of theſe conſiderations, and who haue wholy put my ſelfe into the power of Phiſicke, it is requiſite I auoide the very ſhadow of danger, and liue with as great apprehenſion of feare

in this world, as though I were in an Enemies Countrey, or in a Forreſt of wilde beaſts. It is therefore out of pure neceſſity I attend your commands in this place, and a more ſeaſonable time, to teſtifie vnto you, without running the hazard of my life, that I am with all my ſoule
               
                  My Lord, 

                  Your moſt humble, and moſt obedient ſeruant, BALZAC.

               To the Lord Cardinall de Valete, from Balzac.
               LETTER XI.
               
                  My LORD;
               
               I Verily beleeued I could neuer haue bin ſo vnfortunate, as to be forced to ſearch in the Gazettes for what you doe, and to heare no other newes from you, then

what common brute beſtoweth in all parts of the World, and which the Engliſh and Germans may as well know as I. This puniſhment is by ſo much the more wounding, in that I haue heretofore beene enriched with thoſe benefits, whereof you now ſeeme to bereaue me; and in that the time was, when you pleaſed ſo farre to diſcend from the ranke whence you are deriued, as to lay aſide all thoſe luſters, which incompaſſe you, to conuerſe freely with me: But (my Lord) ſince one word of your mouth hath often cured my decayed ſpirits, and hath many times made me happy without the helpe of Fortune: I freely confeſſe vnto you, I cannot reſolue to change condition, as knowing the loſſe of the leaſt of your fauours cannot be liittle; Yet being ſo innocent that I can no way imagine my offence, and not acknowledging among men, other more aſſured verity then your word, I haue a great reluctation to be diffident of a thing, vpon the certainty whereof halfe the Court is

ingaged for Warre, and the beſieged would make ſmall difficulty to ſurrender themſelues. My Lord, you haue pleaſed to promiſe you would loue me alwayes; therefore I beſeech you not to be offended, if I put you in minde, that as the ancient gods of the Country where now you are▪ ſubmitted themſelues to Deſtinies, after they had once aſſigned them: So you, though aboue all other Lawes, are yet ſubiect to your word. I am confident it cannot be reuoked ſo long as the order of ſublunary things change not, and the Decrees of Gods prouidence remaine immoueable: and if you repent any one action in your whole life, you therein doe more then your very Enemies, who neuer as yet called the leaſt of them in queſtion. For my part, I am far from thinking I haue totally loſt your fauours, leſt I ſhould wrong your Judgment, which conferred them vpon me, and blame the beſt eyes in the World, for hauing heretofore beene blind. I will rather ſuppoſe, if you ſend me no newes, it

is becauſe you thinke I know what will be done ſome ten yeares hence, and that I am brimfull of the Roman Court, and of the Jtalian affaires. Truely I know the preſent Pope, and I haue euer belceued, there is not any humane wit more capable to carry ſo ponderous a felicity, or to let vs againe behold the Primitiue beauty of Religion, and the golden age of Gods Church▪ I know how at Rome idlenes is day and night in action, and that the complements and ceremonies there, put you to more trouble then you ſhould find in gouerning the whole world, if God had left it to your conduct. Me thinkes I yet ſee this great Tyrant with ſo many Heads, (I meane the Signoury of Venice) together with all thoſe petty Soueraignes, who would hazard more men in hanging one ſingle perſon, then the King would venture in two battailes, or at the taking in of foure Citties. But my Lord all this with the reſt doth but ſlightly touch my ſpirit, and as you are the ſole worldly cauſe,

which affordeth me either ioy or diſcomfort, ſo it is from you onely I expect good or ill newes: I haue made your affection in ſuch ſoft neceſſary for my lifes contentment, that without it I ſhould finde defects euen in Felicity it ſelfe, and ſhould haue an imperfect feeling of the moſt happy ſucceſſes could befall me. Reſtore therefore, if ſo you pleaſe, or continue this your ancient fauour towards me, which J cannot poſſibly forbeare. And ſince you are part of that body to which God hath giuen infalibility, and ſince it is forbidden to call the certainty of your wiſedome into the leaſt queſtion: condemne not I beſeech you, what you haue formerly made, as though your Jtalian fauours were ſome other things then your French ones.
               
                  Your most humble, moſt obedient, and moſt faithfull ſeruant, BALZAC.

               Balzac, his Letter to Mounſieur du Planty.
               LETTER XII.
               
                  SIR,
               
               SInce you cannot be here till after the Feaſt, and for that I preſume you haue no purpoſe to oppoſe the Election of the Pope, being cannonically choſen. I will aduiſe you to ſtay your iourney till the Spring be paſt, and the Snowes melted▪ yet truely you are in ſuch eſteeme here, as if you come not the ſooner, I verily thinke you will be ſent for; and that the Court of Rome will commence ſuite with the Loouer, to haue my Lord the Cardinals preſence. It is therefore fitting (if ſo hee pleaſe) that hee vndertake this Voyage, and put off State-buſineſſe, and the Warre to others, to liue here in the midſt of Glory and Tryumphs. In the meane time, I may (ſo neare as I can) informe my ſelfe

both of men and affaires, thereby to giue you the better inſtructions at your comming. Now to the end to affoord you a taſte of what I know, obſerue what I ſay, for I will tell you ſtrange things. There is a certaine Great man here, who entertaineth ſixe Aſtrologers in Penſion, to let him vnderſtand from time to time who ſhall be Pope: Another takes large fees on both ſides, finding it the onely way to bring his Clients to compoſition: A third hath the moſt extrauagant vertue you euer heard of, he leades a farre more pleaſant life then the Duke of Oſsuna; and hauing read in Holy Writ, how the Wiſedome of the world is folly in Gods ſight, he imagines hee ſhould offend his Conſcience, if he were ouer wiſe. Here are Princes in this place, who in full peace pardon neyther Age nor Sexe. There are others who keepe their beds, though they be well able to ride poſt; and who vſe all Phiſicke poſſible to looke pale, to be

feaueriſh, and full of Cathars, and who make vſe of all the ſectets in Phiſicke to haue a megar aſpect. In concluſion, the higheſt place in this world, is that, whether the more eaſily to arriue, it is neceſſary to be lame, and take ſhort ſteps; ſo as a ſound Pope is commonly made out of a ſickely Cardinall. At our next meeting, I will informe you of the reſt, and will in one halfe houre infuſe into you all the experience I haue hither to gotten: But if I haue not this contentment ſo ſoone as I deſire, faile not I pray you, to let me here newes of your health, and the reſt of our good friends. But eſpecially I beſeech you to aſſure Mounſieur de Mauroy, that I am paſſionatly his ſeruant, and that I finde here much fubtilty and diſſimulation, but not many ſo pure and true vertues, as his are

                  A Letter to Mounſieur de la Magdelene from BALZAC.
               
               LETTER. XIII.
               
                  SIR,
               
               I Am extreamely glad you are not of the number of thoſe whom the King hath loſt before St. Iohn d' Angely. Conſerue your ſelfe therefore ſo farre forth as your Honour and Courage will ſuffer or permit, and content your ſelfe to haue taſted what Warre is; which if you pleaſe to be aduiſed by mee, you ſhould doe well neuer more to behold but with Flanders ſpectacles. You are bound to execute good actions, but you are to performe many, and permanently; and to be a better husband of a worthy

mans life, then that of an ordinary Souldier of the Guardes. At leaſtwiſe ſo long as you continue at the aſſembly of the Clergy, you ſhall be ſeruiceable to the Church at your owne eaſe, and there ſhall commonly be ten dayes iourney betweene you and danger. Though I were not any more of this world then thoſe who liued before the late King, or who are to come into the world after the deceaſe of this, yet ſhould I not feare to hazard my ſelfe in this ſort; and to keepe all my bloud for the Publique, as readily as the moſt valiant Ieſuite of France. It is in this ſort I haue learned to ſpeake in this Court, where honeſt men are ſo wedded to their particular intereſts, and doe ſo little reflect vpon the generall affaires, as they thinke there is nothing beyond the tips of their vpmoſt haires, and ſuppoſe the world endeth at their feet. The C. L. dreames of no other thing, but how to fortifie himſelfe with Men and Money

againſt the C. B. whom he taketh for the Turke and an Hereticke: And ſay what you will, the fifty Abbies he hath gotten in one Yeare, is that portion of the Church which pleaſeth him better then all the reſt. Behold in what tearmes we ſtand at this preſent: inſtead of procuring the conuerſion of Nations, and to ſeeke the meanes to ſet the Leuant at liberty: a P. thinkes he hath worthily acquited himſelfe of his charge, ſo long as he prouides to make his Nephew a greater man then his Predeceſſors was. But that I feare leſt my zeale ſhould ouer-far tranſport me, or that you ſhould become as weary of my Diſcourſe as of a tedious Preacher, I would dilate my ſelfe vpon this Subiect; but I know the affaires in theſe parts are very indifferent vnto you, I will therefore referre the further relation wherewith I intended to acquaint you, to my Lord, the Marqueſſe of Caeuure. In briefe, there are none but himſelfe and the Councell,

who can cauſe the Pope to incline to our reaſonable demands, and I will tell you without flattering him, that ſo long as he is here, the King may glory that he reigneth at Rome. As for other things, what beautifull obiects ſoeuer Rome preſenteth to my view, &amp; what pleaſure ſoeuer each man findes there conformable to his humour and inclination, yet cannot I receiue any, being ſo remote from perſons ſo deare vnto mee▪ and ſhall eſteeme my ſelfe vnhappy, ſo long as I am neceſſitated to write Letters vnto you, and onely ſay, what is not as yet in my power to cauſe to appeare, that I am
               
                  Mounſieur,
                   Your moſt faithfull ſeruant BALZAC.
               
            
            
               
               
                  To Mounſieur de Montigny from BALZAC.
               LETTER XIIII.
               
                  SIR,
               
               THough you vſeme ill, and that I haue reaſon to be ſenſible of your neglects, yet I am reſolued to ſuffer from you with an obſtinate patience, and to acquire your fauours by force▪ ſince I cannot obtaine them otherwiſe. But I am aſſured you are not ſo vnciuill, as not to ſuffer your ſelfe to be beloued, nor ſo tyed to your owne fancies, as that there remayneth no affection in you for whatſoeuer is ſeparate: Otherwiſe I ſhould thinke your humour were as much changed as are the affaires of France, or that you were ſnddainly become quite another man. I will therefore reſt confident in the Opinion moſt pleaſing vnto me, and imagine you are ſufficiently my friend in

your thoughts▪ but that you are ouer loyall a French man to haue any intelligence out of the Kingdome: It may be the Example of the Duke of Biron affrights you, and that you take all ſuch as are in Jtaly for Don Pedros, or Countes of Fuentes: in this caſe intruth you haue reaſon, and it is far better to write no Letters at all, then to be forced to explaine them before the Court of Parliament. But if you were of my humour, and that you would referre the whole State, and all the affaires therein to Mounſiour  Luynes, me thinkes our Amity could not paſſe for conſpiracy, and you might ſafely let me haue newes from your ſelfe, and the reſt of our friends, without any hazard at all. I deſire onely to know what you doe, and wherein you imploy the faireſt ſeaſon of your life. Doe you neuer part from the lips of Opala; whoſe breath is ſo ſweete, as it ſeemes ſhee feedeth onely on Pinkes and Perfumes? are you in as high eſteeme in your Miſtreſses thoughts as your merits and ſeruice deſerues, and

as your loyalty obligeth her vnto? Is Clitophon ſtill in his generous muſings? doth he dayly take Townes at table? and doth he yet frame forraigne deſignes betweene his Bed-curtaines? Is there any good inclination in the Court for our great Cardinall? and are they not perſwaded that if he were Pope, the Church would ſoone be as well Miſtreſſe in Germany as at Rome? After you haue ſatisfied me in all theſe points, I am contented to be at truce with you as long as you pleaſe; and if neede be, will ſuffer you to waxe old vpon the boſome of Opala, without euer asking you what you doe there.
               
                  Yours, BALZAC.
               
            
            
               
                  BALZAC his Letter to the Duke of Eſpernon.
               
               LETTER XV.
               
                  My LORD;
               
               VVEre I not borne (as I am) your moſt humble ſeruant, yet ſhould I

ſhew my ſelfe a very degenerate Frenchman, if I did not much reioyce in the happineſſe of your Family, ſince it is a publick Felicity. I haue heard the proſperous ſucceſſe of the Voyage you made into Bearn, and of the great beginnings you haue giuen, to what the King deſireth there to vndertake. And truly, the Election He hath made of you, to ſerue him in an occaſion of ſuch importance, hath beene ſo generally approued, that, if heretofore there hath beene any defects pretended in the conduct of our Affaires. we muſt neceſſarily auow, that this laſt Action hath ſufficiently iuſtified all the former; it appearing plainly, that it is not only fauour which ſetteth the difference between men. J no way doubt, but right, and power ſiding together, that the euent of things will be ſutable to our deſires: But, howſoeuer it happen, you haue already the glory of hauing facilitated the victory, and made it appeare how the Enemies of the State haue no other force, but what

they draw out of our weakneſſe. It is now time (my Lord) you take notice of thoſe aduantages God hath giuen you aboue the reſt of men: You ought, at leaſt to remember, how being tryed with Worldly affaires, and retired from Court, publicke neceſſity had not ſought you out in your priuate repoſednes at home, to put the Kings royall Armies into your hands, if you were not the only man from whom all men expect the re-eſtabliſhment of theſe affaires. I will not ſo farrerelie vpon my owne opinion, as to anſwere for the future: Yet when J conſider the actions of your Life, which are ſo eminent, that we find difficulty to beleeue them, euen after they haue beene performed; and thoſe in ſuch number, that Strangers may well imagine you haue liued from the very beginning of our Monarchy: I ſuppoſe I might boldly affirme, that, if there be yet any great matter remaining to be atchieued in the World, there is none but your Selfe muſt attempt it. You haue poſſeſſed

the fauour of Kings, as Fortunes which might faile you, and haue not feared that their paſſions could out-laſt your innocency. This Vertue we ſo much admire, hath ſucceeded the ſame authority, our Fathers haue adored. You haue made no vſe of your power in State, which you haue not euer ſince coſerued by the force of your Courage. You haue at all times preſerued the liberty of France amidſt the miſeries of times, and the vſurpation vpon lawfull power. Who is there can ſay this of himſelfe? where are they that haue ſtood firme betweene rebellion and ſeruitude? where was there euer knowne an olde age ſo neceſſary for the world, or ſo much good and bad fortune equally glorious? My Lord, you know your ſelfe too well, to ſuſpect me of flattery; and my humour is ſo aliene from any ſeruile actions, as the Court hath not ſufficient hopes to cauſe me to do any thing againſt my conſcience. I then ſpeake as I doe now; for the onely intereſt of Vertue;

and if that were not on your ſide, I would ſeeke for it among our enemies to doe it right: None will ſuſpect I haue any pretentions at Madrill; or that I intend to make a fortune in Holland; yet to heare mee ſpeake of the Prince of Orenge, and the Marqueſſe Spinola, one would ſay that I did at once expect Abbies from the Hollanders, and were a penſioner to Spaine. In ſumme, I hold my ſelfe obliged to thoſe, who affoord me matter and meanes to reconcile the two rareſt things in this world, to wit; Vertue and Eloquence. And as their reputation hath neede of my Pen, to make it immortall; ſo are their liues and actions right vſefull vnto me, when I imploy my paines on excellent Subiects. You haue euer done mee the honour to wiſh me well, and I haue receiued innumerable fauours from my Lord the Cardinall your Sonne; but howſoeuer, I humbly beſeech you to be confident that my affections are abſolutely pure, and that

my particular intereſts haue not any alliance therewith. I am ſo happy as to haue ſerued you in a troubleſome time, and to haue bin of the weaker ſide; as iudging it to be the more honeſt. I haue not ſince beene of another mind; and the reaſons drawing me to doe what I did, being ſtill the ſame, I am really, as I euer haue beene,
               
                  My Lord, 
                  Your moſt humble and thrice obedient ſeruant, BALZAC.
               
            
            
               To the Duke of Eſpernon from Balzac.
               
               LETTER XVI.
               
                  My LORD,
               
               THe Letter I lately receiued from you, maketh me know I am happier then I ſuppoſed, ſince I haue the honour to

be ſometimes in your memory. It is a place ſo taken vp with high thoughts, and which the publique good doth in ſuch meaſure make vſe of, as I had not the ambition to imagine, there could be any roome left for a man of ſo ſmall importance as my ſelfe. But I fee, that as you neuer had any ſo potent enemies as to exceede your courage, ſo haue you not any ſeruants of ſo ſlight conſideration, whom you eſteeme not worthy your care. Herein my Lord, you make it appeare that the meaneſt matters change their nature into more noble ſubiects, ſo ſoone as they become yours: and how of all men, you haue conquered part, and acquired the reſt. I am verily perſwaded, it were no leſſe then to offend God, to deny obedience to a perſon ſo high in his fauour as you are, and that his meaning is, this commanding ſpirit he hath conferred vpon you, ſhould bee maſter of all others. The Honour therefore to you appertaining, being

little inferiour to what we owe to ſacred things; and that beſides the ordinary prouidence which gouerneth the world, there being a particular one in Heauen, deſigned meerely for the conduct of your life, to make it admired in all after Ages: it is neceſſary as well in contemplation of this common conſideration, as for others particularly concerning my ſelfe, I ſhould perpetually remaine
               
                  My Lord,

                   Your moſt humble and moſt faithfull Seruant, BALZAC. 
                  
                     The 5. of Aprill, 1622.
                  
               
            
            
               To the Duke of Eſpernon from Balzac.
               
               LETTER XVII.
               
                  My LORD,
               
               IN this generall calme of the State, (wherein the affaires of this Kingdome ſeeme to be aſleepe, and the Worlds

occurrents to be at a ſtand) all France expects your preſence at Court, to be the Authour of the deſired Newes, and to draw from the Kings breaſt the good intentions wherewith it is ſo richly ſtored. The reduction of Bearn not ſtayned with any drop of bloud: the truth wherein you haue inſtructed all men, concerning the poſſibility of taking Rochell, and the order you haue now lately left in Guiene, where you haue reduced the Factions to ſuch a point, as their only power conſiſteth in their peruerſe humours; putteth vs in hope, that if God ſhould deferre the ſafety of our State till another Age, it could bee no man (your ſelfe excepted) for whom hee hath reſerued ſo glorious an Enterpriſe. My Lord, it is certaine he neuer ſhewed more miracles in thoſe places himſelfe hath conſecrated to his glory and publique Piety, and which he hath choſen on purpoſe there to manifeſt his power, then he hath done in your perſon. And

when I conſider how often he hath protected you, contrary to all humane appearance; and the oppoſition you haue encountred, in arriuing to this hight by ſo many rockes and precipices; I cannot but conſtantly belecue you haue ouerpaſſed the time of dying; and that for the Worlds generall good, it is fitting you indure as long as the Sunne or Stars. To ſtop here, were to praiſe you imperfectly, and onely to make it appeare you are able to affoord long ſeruices. I will therefore ſay more: on which ſide ſoeuer I turne mine eyes, be it that I conuey them beyond the Seas, or make them paſſe thoſe Mountaines which ſeparate vs from our neighbours, I finde not that perſon in any place, who can iuſtly diſpute for glory with you; or whoſe life is ſo illuſtrious as yours. I haue ſeriouſly conſidered all whatſoeuer might giue value or reputation to the Courts of ſtranger Princes, and there truely I find men who are well ſeene in Military

affaires, and who haue gained to themſelues no ſmall experience by meanes of an infinity of rules and maximes: But the difference betweene thoſe men and your ſelfe, is, that they cannot ſtirre, nor make themſelues awfull without the Jndies, Armies, and Cannons; whereas you are redoubtable all alone, and vnarmed; yea, your very ſtilneſſe terrifieth the greateſt enemies of France. This being abſolutely true (as no man can doubt) it is high time the King doe really make vſe of a man whom the neceſſity of his ſtate requireth of him, and that he no longer imploy thoſe improſperous perſons, vnder whoſe hands opportunities waxe old, and his good fortune will faile him. It is ſufficient that the Rhyne and Alpes haue formerly beene French, and that our Language is ſpoken in neighbouring Prouinces, without ſuffering a ſtrange kind of people ſtil to remaine in the very bowels of our Kingdome, who will not allow of our

ancient Lawes. There is now no longer meanes to couer thisskarre which diſhonoreth the face of State, or to ſuffer that Rebellion and loyalty liue together. To ſpeake truth, what kind correſpondency can be expected betweene the Miſtreſle of the houſe, and the Concubine? what a monſtrous production would that proue betweene a Monarchy and a popular gouernment? and what kind of Soueraigne ſhould hee be, who were dependent on his ſubiects, and his Councell ſubordinate to the Towne-houſe? Truly, if Catholickes ſhould demand Cities of the King, proportionable to their number, as others doe, he ſhould be forced hence-forward to remaine all his life time at Fountaine▪bleau and S. Germins: nor would there remaine vnto him any more then the bare title of a King, and the common fields of his Countrey. But it ſhall not alwaies be ſo if predictions proue true: And Reaſon as well as Nature requireth that things ſhould bee

reduced to their ancient forme. It were no leſſe then to iniure him who hath promiſed to France a longer continuance then to all her diſeaſes, to thinke that hee hauing giuen remedies againſt the Gothes and Moores, hee will ſuffer it to dye at this day by the hands of a ſmall packe of Rebels: Prouided, that face which I rather call immortall, then ancient, doe ſtill aſſure vs of the great ſource of life you retaine in your couragious heart, and that Heauen pleaſe to preſerue for the worlds benefit, the bleſſing it conferred vpon vs at your Natiuity; we require not a more certayne preſage of the end of our euils; nor is there any ſo ſicke or far ſtrucken in yeares, who hopeth not to ſuruiue theſe inteſtine troubles: But we are not to imagine that Victory and Peace are two oppoſite things, though they be different; for it is the one which aſſureth the other, and ſetleth it in ſtate not to be any further either troubled or threatned by any.

When all is done, I finde it were much to oblige theſe malecontents, to giue a ſure repoſe to their diſtruſtfull ſpirits, and at once to ridde them of all their hopes and feares: when they ſhall no longer need to trouble themſelues with making aſſemblies, and that their liues ſhalbe free from the feare of puniſhments. When I ſay both they and we ſhall enioy common ſecurity, it is not to be doubted but their condition will be much bettered, it being a much fairer fortune to be caſt on ſhore by a ſtorme in a craiſed Veſſell, then to be ſtill in the power of Windes and Seawrackes. The word of Kings ought not to contradict the functions of Regality, nor can they oblige themſelues to leaue their Subiects in miſerable eſtate, or to doecontrary to what they ought. And in conſcience ſince the ruine of Rebellion is written in Heauen, in the ſame ſort as is the Day of Judgement, and the Worlds diſſolution; were it not as much as to reſiſt Gods will, and to oppugne his prouidence,

ſhould we ſo ſoone grow weary of well-doing, or refuſe to finiſh a worke, the euent whereof is infalliable? There is nothing ſo eaſie for a great Prince, as either to finde or conceiue faults, nor doth any man doubt that diſſimulation is iuſt, when it rends to the aduantage and auayle of the deceiued. If a mad man were capable of remedies, were it not lawfull to cure him without asking his conſent? were it fit a Father ſhould ſuffer his Son to be drowned, for feare of pulling him out by the haire? Are we to ſuffer the State to periſh, for that we cannot preferue it by ordinary wayes? No (my Lord) we ought not▪ there is no conſideration can cauſe that thing to change its nature, which of it ſelfe is iuſt; and the Lawes of neceſſity doe diſpence with vs for thoſe of formality. Now to returne to my firſt diſcourſe, and to what particularly regardeth your Lordſhip; ſeeing your abſence from Court hath at all times threatned more miſeries vnto vs, then the apparition of Comets and

other irregularities in Nature, and ſince to be miſerable, it is ſufficient to be at odds with you. There is not any of your enemies can eſcape the Diuine iuſtice, nor is there any doubt, but you will generally finde all thoſe ſpirits fauourable vnto you, whom you haue formerly conuinced; or that your propoſitions ſhall not be receiued as aſſured Conqueſts. The beſt is, there are now no more any vſurpers neare the King, who ſeeke to ingroſſe his fauours to their owne aduantages, &amp; bereaue men of thoſe benefits which ought to be as common to them as the Fire or Ayre. His Maieſties heart is open to all his Subiects, hee receiues trueth at what hand ſoeuer it comes vnto him. This being ſo (my Lord) may wee not reſt confident you ſhall not loſe one word, and that your Vertue whereof the World is vncapable, ſhall at length be found the onely meanes the King hath to redreſſe and re-eſtabliſh his affaires. Neither time, trauaile, nor coſt, ought diuert him from this deſigne▪
                  
It is a worke will be nothing ſo coſtly as to raiſe a Fauorite, and it being a thing all Chriſtendome exacteth of him, as an Hereditary debt the King his Father hath left to be diſcharged. And truely, it is moſt certaine that the face of States hath beene changed, and whole Prouinces conquered, with leſſe coſt then diuers Pagan Princes haue imployed in erecting of Idols▪
                   and cauſing them to be adored by their people. But to leaue this Jtalian ſeuerity you formerly reprooued in me, and leſt you ſhould accuſe me for warring againſt the dead, I will for your ſake pardon their memory; nor will I farther dilate my ſelfe vpon ſo odious a Subiect. Yet is this but halfe of what I intended to ſpeake vnto you at Coignac; if in that ſhort abode you made there, and the continuall preſſe hindring the freedome of my Speech vnto you, it had beene permitted mee to haue had a longer Audience. But (my Lord) what I could not performe by word of Mouth, I will continue by my Letters, if you pleaſe

to doe mee the honour as to command them; or if my words which you haue heretofore made choyce of for the conception of your High thoughts, in bewayling preſent miſeries and publique ingratitude, be, as pleaſing vnto you, as I am perfectly
               
                  Your moſt humble, moſt obedient, and moſt faithfull ſeruant, BALZAC 
                  
                     The 18 of Nouember, 1623.
                  
               
            
            
               The Duke of Eſpernon his Letter to the French King: penned by BALZAC.
               LETTER XVIII.
               
                  SIR,
               
               I Vnderſtand by the Letter it pleaſed your Maieſty to doe me the honour to write vnto me, that vpon the opinion wherewith ſome haue poſſeſſed you

concerning the continuance of the German Warres, you iudge it expedient for the good of your ſeruice, I ſhould not (as yet) leaue this Frontire. Whereunto Sir, I can giue your Maieſty no other anſwer, but that hauing at all times gathered out of your commands, what my duty obliged me vnto, and hauing neuer propoſed other end to my actions, then the good of your ſtate, I ſhould be carefull of ſtraying from that deſigne in an occaſion wherein J might imagine your ſeruice depended on my obedience. But at this preſent (Sir) the tranquility of France groweth to be ſo generall, your affaires ſo powerfully eſtabliſhed, and the Honour of your Amity ſo precious among all your neighbouring Princes; that as there is nothing in this Kingdome which doth not bend vnder your Authority; ſo is there not any Prince abroad, who doth not reſpect your power, or who conſerueth not himſelfe by your Iuſtice. And as concerning the troubles of Bohemia; beſides, that

time hath euaporated the firſt heat of ſpirits, and that they begin to retire from thoſe extreamities wherein formerly they inuolued themſelues: the imagined danger is ſo farre remoued hence, as we cannot conceiue the leaſt apprehenſion, euen for thoſe who are not our next neighbours that way. It is certaine (Sir) that on this ſide the Rhine all things ſeeme to bee at reſt vnder the ſhade of your State, and the ancient Allies of this Crowne who are neareſt any danger, expect the end of Warre with our fearing it ſhould come any further towards them, or that out of all this noyſe, there will ariſe any more then one Warre. Theſe conſiderations then doe no way oblige me to ſtay in theſe parts, where things are in ſo good eſtate, as they may well nigh ſubſiſt of themſelues▪ beſides the reſidence my Sonne of Valette ſhall make there in my abſence, being ſufficient to giue order to all occurrents concerning the good of your affaires. I aſſure my ſelfe your Maieſty will

be ſo impartiall as to be pleaſed to reflect vpon the neceſſity of my particular occaſions, and that ſuffering me to retire my ſelfe to my owne houſe, you will at leaſt permit mee to enioy a fauour, vſually inflicted on others as a puniſhment. I doubt not (Sir) but you will condiſcend to the deſire I haue to vndertake this Voyage, and I preſume you will be pleaſed to conſider, that I being ingaged in two hundred thouſand Crownes for your ſeruice; after the ſight of your royall bounty in all ſorts of hands, it were ſmall reaſon (I receiuing nothing) ſhould ſtill in this place ſtand as a meere cypher for the honor of France; or that I ruine my ſelfe with a rich ſhew, only to continue ſtrangers in the opinion they haue of the magnificent greatneſſe of your Crowne. Yet (Sir) hauing neuer beleeued J could ſuſtayne any great detriment by the loſſe of a thing J ſo ſlightly eſteeme, as I do worldly ſubſtance, I intend not in this place to complayne of my pouerty: But (to ſpeake truth) ſince all

my words and actions are by many miſinterpreted; and that hauing affoorded my dutifull attendance to the ſeruice of three great Kings, I yet find much difficulty to defend my ſo long a loyalty agaynſt Calumny: I am with much ſorrow conſtrayned to ſay, that if I ſtood firme in my duty, euen when diſobedience was Crowned with rewards; and haue maintayned your Authority, when by ſome it was abuſed, by others contemned: It is no ſmall iujury to me, to imagine I wil now begin to fayle in my loyalty at this age wherein I am, or ſuffer my ſelfe to be reproached by poſterity, whereto I ſtudy to annexe the laſt actions of my life. But I ſee well (Sir) it is long ſince the hatred of diſhoneſt French-men hath beene fatall vnto me, and that it hath beene borne with mee inſeparably. From the firſt houre I appeared in the World, there was neuer either peace or truce vnuiolated to my preiudice; and as though I were excepted out of all

treaties, though Warre be ended, yet that made againſt me endureth. At this preſent (Sir) it ſufficeth not I performe my charge without omitting or forgetting any thing due to your ſeruice; or that the innocency of my actions be generally acknowledged; but I am driuen to thoſe ſtreights, as to be forced to giue account of my very thoughts, there being not any (my ſelfe excepted) from whom ſatisfaction is required for the fault hee hath not as yet committed. If wee liued in a Countrey where vertue were auoyded, as not concurrent with the times, or aduerſe to the State, and where a great reputation were more dangerous then an inglorious one, I ſhould not neede to make much ſearch for the cauſe of my misfortunes: but I well know the conduct you vſe, hath more honourable and honeſt grounds, and that your Maieſty hath no pretention to reigne with more aſſurance then the King your Father did before you. It is from him (Sir) you

may learne how you are to diſtinguiſh wounded innocency from wicked impudency: and to know it is ordinary to draw honeſt men into ſuſpicion, thereby to make them vnſeruiceable. In following his example, you ſhall finde out the truth, though neuer ſo cloſely hidden, or what ſhadow ſoeuer they caſt ouer the ſame to diſguiſe it. And truely (Sir) ſince this great Prince in beſtowing your Origin vpon you, hath together therewith conferred his moſt Royall inclinations, I will neuer beleeue, that to follow a ſtranger paſſion, you will loſe thoſe perfections ſo proper, and naturall vnto you; or that for me alone your Maieſty hath any other ſpirit then for the reſt of men. Truely, if when you were not yet at your owne liberty, ſuch hath beene the naturall goodneſſe of your gracious diſpoſition, as you haue at all times reſiſted violent counſels, nor haue euer permitted your authority ſhould bee imployed to the ruine of your

ſubiects: there is ſmall appearance, that hauing now by publique and ſolemne act obliged your ſelfe to reigne alone, and your bounty finding not any obſtacle to hinder the ſame, you would diſturbe the old age of one of your beſt ſeruants, or deny to his gray haires that reſt Nature requires at your hands, (I ought to hope (at leaſt) for this recompence for my long and faithfull ſeruices, ſince your Maieſty may beſtow it without incommodating your affaires; and beſides I hauing neuer expected other reward of worthy actions, then the onely contentment to haue performed them, I ſhall hold my ſelfe ſufficiently happy, to receiue from my conſcience the teſtimonies which whilſt I liue it will affoord me, that I haue beene, really am, and euer will to the end remayne▪
               
               
                  SIR,

                   Your most humble, moſt obedient, and moſt faithfull ſubiect and ſeruant, ESPERNON 
                  From Mets 
                     7 of Ianuary, 1619.
                  
               
            
            
               
               Another Letter to the French King from the Duke of Eſpernon, penned by the ſame Balzac.
               
               LETTER XIX.
               
                  SIR,
               
               HAuing long attended at Mets, the occaſions not to be vnuſefully there, and not finding any thing either in the conduct of my preſent life, or in the memory of my fore-paſſed time, which might iuſtly caſt me into a worſe condition then the reſt of your ſubiects: I haue preſumed that the Lawes of this Kingdome, and my Births prerogatiue might permit me to make vſe of publique liberty, and to partake of that peace you haue purchaſed to the reſt of your ſubiects. Neuertheleſſe (Sir) your Maieſties will doth ſo regulate mine, that I had not remooued, had not the cauſe of my ſtay there ceaſed, and the difficulties

of the Bohemian Warre beene vtterly remoued. But hauing had perfect intelligence by the relations the Duke of Loraine hath receiued from thoſe parts, that the affaires there begin to be well ſetled, the ouerture thereof beginning with the ſuſpenſion of Warre on both ſides; I could not imagine the good of your ſeruice did any way oblige me to remaine longer in a place out of all danger in time of peace, and which will make good vſe of the Empires weakenes if the War continue: conſidering likewiſe that if there bee any part of your State leſſe ſound then the reſt, and where your Authority had need with more then ordinary care to be conſerued, it is queſtionleſſe in the Prouince whither I am going, which bordering vpon ſuch neighbours as all honeſt men may iuſtly ſuſpect; and being a people compoſed of diuers parts, haue at all times beene either troubled or threatned with changes▪ yea, at this preſent (Sir) the moſt

common opinion is, that the aſſembly now holden at Rochell, is no way pleaſing vnto you, and that if you haue bin drawne to giue any aſſcent thereto, it hath rather beene a conniuency to the neceſſity of time, then conformable to your will. Whereupon (Sir) if your Maieſty pleaſe to reflect vpon the miſeries of your State, whereout at leaſt you haue drawne this aduantage, that euen in the very ſpring of your age, you haue attained great experience: You ſhall plainely ſee that all the miſeries which befell your Maieſty in your minority, haue beene begun vpon the like occaſions. I therefore vſing my beſt indeuours, if the intentions of thoſe of Rachell bee good; to hinder that the euents bee not euill; therein I hope I ſhall no way diſobey your Maieſties commands; but doe rather explaine them according to the true ſenſe, allowing them the beſt interpretation, ſince it is moſt profitable for your ſeruice. Truely (Sir) no man

is ignorant, that as the conſeruation of your authority is the principle Law of your State: ſo likewiſe that the moſt expreſſe and important part of your commands, is the good of your affaires. This being vndoubtedly true, what appearance is there, it being in my power to preſerue the affections of a diuided Prouince in due obedience to your Maieſty, and to pacifie by my preſence thoſe affections eaſily drawne to reuolt, if none did confirme them in their loyalty: I ſhould (for the interrupting ſo neceſſary a voyage, propound to my ſelfe ſo friuolous conſiderations, and thoſe ſo far fetcht as the Warres of Bohemia. I liue not in an age (Sir) wherein I am permitted to feede my ſelfe with variety; but I doe not withall ſuppoſe your Maieſty doth ſo ſlightly eſteeme of my ſeruice, as not to make any farther vſe of me, ſaue onely to ſee the packets from Germany ſafely conueyed; nor doe I finde my ſelfe ſo vnuſefull, as to be forced inſteade of

better imployments; onely to let you know what newes is ſtirring, and to giue you an account of ordinary rumours. I muſt humbly beſeech your Maieſty, to ſuffer me to dye in this opinion I haue of my ſelfe, and to allow me to make free vſe of my leaſure; if you pleaſe not to impoſe more honourable imployments vpon me for your ſeruice. Howſoeuer it happen, (Sir) or how badly ſoeuer I be intreated, I am determined to continue reſolute in well-doing. And your Maieſty may be moſt aſſured, that neither Time, which affoordeth occaſions to the moſt miſerable to raiſe their fortunes, nor Place often fauouring their reſentments, nor Neceſſity which cauſeth their actions to ſeeme iuſt; ſhall euer tranſport mee from remayning with the ſame affection I euer haue done to be
               
                  Sir,

                   Your moſt humble, moſt obedient, and moſt faithfull ſubiect and ſeruant, Eſpernon.

               Another Letter from the Duke of Eſpernon to the French King, penned by the ſame Balzac.
               
               LETTER XX.
               
                  SIR,
               
               IF your Maieſty haue miſconceiued mine intentions before you were charely informed of them; I am perſwaded, I haue at this preſent in ſuch ſort iuſtified the ſame by my proceedings, as there is no further neede to defend them by my words. Truely, I may iuſtly ſay, that the Conduct J haue vſed, hath beene ſuch: the Queene your Mother, hauing done me the honor to make vſe of my ſeruice in a buſines, ſhe deemed much to import the good of your State; as not making vſe of the aduantages which might ariſe by cauſing miſchiefe to continue, or by giuing way to

ſuch deſignes, the euent whereof would haue ſufficiently commended the reſolution, had they not beene diſaduantagious vnto you▪ I haue contented my ſelfe to reſtifie to all France, that I had reſpect to your authority euen in the hands of mine enemies: whereby (Sir) I truſt I haue cauſed my actions to appeare ſo pure and vnſpotted before your Maieſty, that you remaine fully ſatisfied; nor will you I hope iudge I haue erred, in following a cauſe J might probably ſuppoſe could not be well ſeparated from yours. Now therefore ſince it hath pleaſed your Maieſty to ſupply what ſeemed deficient in the felicity of your Reigne, and to ſettle peace in your State: All your true ſubiects (Sir) are by ſo much the more obliged to rely on your Royall word; in that it is the rocke whereon all Chriſtendome reſts confident: And the ſame hauing beene giuen to the Queene your Mother, beſides your obligation thereto by God and Nature, your very reputation confirmeth the ſame vnto her

vpon this ſacred and inuiolable aſſurance, after hauing dedicated my ſenſibilities and intereſts to publique peace, and taken your Maieſties memory, as witneſſe, that I haue at all times ſerued you faithfully, though it hath not alwayes beene by ordinary and common waies; I aſſure my ſelfe you will bee pleaſed to permit mee hence forward to paſſe the reſt of my dayes in peace; and now at length to leaue mee in the Hauen whereinto I haue beene caſt by ſo many violent Tempeſts. Sir, I haue but a ſhort time to ſtay in this World, and ſurely I ſhould ſuppoſe my life ouer-long, could I find my ſelfe culpable of one ſingle cogitation repugnant to the Allegeance I owe to your Maieſty, I therefore moſt humbly beſeech you (Sir) to be pleaſed to conſider, that I deſiting no other thing of you, but either ſome ſmall repoſe after my great paines, or an honourable death in your ſeruice: I can no way herein allot more moderate limits to my ambition, nor wiſh a more innocent end to my

old age: Howſoeuer, J ſhall eſteeme it right happy, may I end it in this ſort; and if in loſing it, I conſerue the quality I haue euer hitherto inuiolably kept of
               
                  Your Maieſties moſt humble, moſt obedient, and moſt faithfull Subiect and Seruant, ESPERNON.

            THE LETTERS OF MOVNSIEVR DE BALZAC.
            
            To my Lord the Duke de la Valete; from Mounſieur D' BALZAC.
            THE THIRD BOOKE.
            
               LETTER I.
               
                  My LORD:
               
               
                  IN acquittance of my promiſe when I parted from Mets, I am to let your Lordſhip know, wee are at this inſtant beyond ten Riuers, and how all things haue bin

propitious to my Lord your Fathers Voyage. To be diffident the concluſion will not correſpond to theſe faire beginnings: were either to make doubt of Gods prouidence, or to diſtruſt his Grace; but it hath pleaſed his Diuine Maieſty at all times to take ſo particular care for the conſeruation of your Family, that he will as ſoone permit his Altars and Images to be irreuerently intreated, as perſons who are ſo high in his fauour as all of you are. Howſoeuer it happen (my Lord) if none but the proſperous can loſe by altorations; you will, I hope, confeſſe no ſuch change can any way happen, whereout wee ſhall not draw ſome aduantage; and what interpretations ſoeuer they giue to my Lord your Fathers intentions, yet will all honeſt men iudge fauourably thereof, nor will any man apprehend failing after ſo eminent an example. All France attends his reſolution to be rightly informed in the truth of the Kings affaires, and all men know he is of ſuch conſideration in this

State, as his leaſt diſcontentments are to bee reckoned among publicke miſeries. I will perſwade my ſelfe they will not proceede to any extreamity, and that there is not impudency enough in our Enemies to tranſport them to ſo dangerous counſels. If the worſt come, yet muſt this voyage neceſſarily produce the one of two things, equally neceſſary in a troubleſome time, Warre or Liberty. J am not ſo cleare ſighted in future euents, as to anſwere for what ſhall happen; yet ſince the order of ſeaſons are framed to facilitate our paſſage, and that all things haue chanſed more ſucceſfully vnto vs then we preſumed to deſire; there is ſmall appearance that Heauen will declare it ſelfe in fauour of the leſſe ſupportable cauſe. But that which doth the rather fortifie my confidence, is the vigorous eſtate wherein I finde my Lord your Father, he hath no ſhew of old age, ſaue onely experience and authority. The late Ligue, the Rebels, the Sword, nor Poyſon haue not beene of power to kill him,

nor was there euer man ſo awfull in his aduerſe fortune. As for you (my Lord) who are the obiect of his hopes and feares; &amp; who are to performe one of the principall parts in his deſigned action: remember you haue the command of aThe City of Mets.
                   place which hath beene the diſhonour of Charles the fift, and which affoordeth France a reuenge for all the affronts he offered thereto. He who defended it againſt him had no more then two armes as you haue, and one ſingle life, nor was hee madé of any other matter then other men are. It is true, he fought by the Kings ſuccours, but it ſufficeth you fight for his ſeruice, and that all men know you are reſolued not to ſuruiue your fortunes. Were you borne to performe ordinary actions, I ſhould hold it fit to ſpeake vnto you in another ſtraine, but ſince you purpoſe not to exerciſe any idle dignity in this world, nor are at this preſent in caſe to make vſe of the hands of a great Army, or expect

reputation in your bed; ſpeake as high as you pleaſe, prouided you act accordingly; and that out of your particular forces (ſince thoſe of the State faile you) you make good vnto the King, the laſt conqueſt of his Anceſtors. One only worthy man hath heretofore beene the whole Republicke of Rome, and hath reſiſted the fury of a victorious Army. So though there were no more true Frenchmen, but my Lord your Father, your ſelfe, and my Lords your Brothers, I could no way diſpaire of Publique affaires, nor of the fortune of this Kingdome. My Lord, I am ſo weary, that I am forced to defer the continuation of this diſcourſe till another time, and to reſt awhile to make a more ample relation. I will content my ſelfe for the preſent, to paſſe my promiſe vnto you of that Hiſtory, the ſubiect whereof I require at your hands, and to aſſure you it is impoſſible to be more then I am

               To the Signiour of Pleſſis, Gouernour of Tollemount, from BALZAC.
               
               LETTER. II.
               
                  SIR,
               
               SInce it appeares you haue a will to loſe euery hour what you can in truth ſpend but once, and that you ſo ſlightly eſteeme your life, as though it were another mans; me thinkes the Warre hath dealt very kindly with you, in being contented to leaue you halfe a face, and that you may well account what is left, as gotten goods. The Duke de Mayne, and the reſt were not quit at ſo eaſie a rate: and it hath pleaſed God to ſhew examples in this kinde, to make it appeare that he approoueth not vanity; nor that he needeth the aduiſe of men for the defence of his owne and his

Churches cauſe. Truely, if theſe men had practiſed with the enemy, they could not haue beene more confident; nor haue gone more naked to Warre, had they fought againſt women: And in truth I am ſo farre from praiſing their deſperate courſes, as I doe not ſo much as pardon them their deathes; and if my opinion had paſſed, I ſhould haue thought it fit to haue accuſed them as culpable of their owne deathes, and as ſuch who had committed the greateſt Parricides. It becomes mee ill in this place to preſcribe rules to my Maſter; for ſhould I attempt to tech your courage how farre it ſhould extend it ſelfe, I might ſeeme to doe no leſſe then preſcribe lawes to what is illimitable. Yet bee pleaſed (I pray you) to be informed, that valour is ſo tender and delicate a vertue, that if it be not ſometimes well ſhielded and conſerued by ſome others, it becommeth more hurtfull to him who hath it, then healthfull for the State, often

endamaged by it, or to the Prince who maketh vſe thereof. And ſurely without the aſſiſtance of Reaſon, which ought to be its Gouernneſſe, and Prudence as a guide vnto it: there is not any paſſion more blinde, nor which doth leſſe differ from the fury of Beaſts, and the bruitiſh ferocity of Barbarians: The latter of theſe thinke it cowardiſe to quit the place, though the breach of a Riuer rowle vpon them; or not to ſtand firme though they ſee a houſe falling on their heads. But theſe wretches, and wee, haue not the ſame pretentions; for as they propound to themſelues, onely to kill, and to die, ſo ſhould we onely aime at victory, and neglect the reſt; otherwiſe to what end is the knowledge of Vertue vnto vs, and of the limits which boundeth it, or to be borne vnder a more happy Climate, then that of Polonia and Muſcouia: if we draw no aduantage either from the excellency of our inſtitutions or extractions; I doe not at all wonder, why there are

men who preferre death before indigence, and who not finding any contentment in their owne Countries, are well pleaſed to paſſe beyond the Ice of their naturall ayre, as willing to forgoe the infelicity of their fortunes. But a man of worth, who at all houres inioyeth both perfect and pure contents, and who hath a great ſhare of this Ages vertue to loſe, is a Traytour to the Publick, and a Tyrant to himſelfe, if he forſake all this for a meere fancy, and depriue the world thereof onely for a flaſh of Fame and vaine Glory. You know this better then I can tell it you, and if you ſuppoſe the Philoſophy you haue heretofore ſo highly eſteemed, be yet wiſe enough to inſtruct you, ſhee will tell you that Life is the ground-worke of all other good that can here befall vs; ſince by meanes therof one may recouer Kingdomes though vtterly loſt, and remaine Victor, after hauing beene defeated in foure battailes. There is no queſtion

but a dead Lyon is leſſe worth then a liuing Dogge, or that the moſt part of thoſe Princes of whom there hath beene ſo much ſpeech, and thoſe valiant Captaines with whoſe Heroicke acts ſo many Hiſtories are ſtored, would not willingly change their Laurels for our liues. Reioyce therefore (good Sir) together with Nature: in that you are as yet in the number of men; and comfort your ſelfe with Haniball, and the Father of Alexander the great, for the loſſe you haue receiued: whatſoeuer you can ſay, you haue yet ſight enough to cauſe you to turne loueſicke, and to contemplate the beauties of Heauen and Earth. But ſuppoſe you were wholy blinde, yet is it true, that the Night hath its pleaſures as well as the Day, yea and ſuch as you beſt loue.
               
                  Yours, BALZAC.

               Another Letter to Hidaſpe from BALZAC.
               
               LETTER III.
               MY deare Hidaſpe, thou canſt not imagine the content I take in thy Letter, and in the good newes it brings me, it is the onely way to cauſe me to contradict my ſelfe, when I account my eſtate miſerable, ſince I heare thou art in health, and loueſt me. Were I not confident thereof, I ſhould the next day drinke poyſon; or if not valiant enough to attempt ſo hardy an enterpriſe, I ſhould dye with ſorrow. Thou art (then) as neceſſary for my liuing as life it ſelfe; ſo as if thou deſireſt my eſtate, thou needeſt not for that any other meanes, then to depriue me of thy good opinion: But truely I neuer had the leaſt apprehenſion of ſuch a loſſe, and I
                  
aſſure my ſelfe if J were dead, thou ſhouldeſt be double as rich as thou deſireſt to be. I haue long ſince beene aſſured, thy thoughts are not inthralled to the earth, or that thy paſſions onely exceede thoſe of the vulgar. Let me intreat thee to cheriſh them my deare Hydaſpe; and though I be continually ſad, and at all times ill affected in my health; yet remember that the very rauings of my Feauer are ſometimes more prizeable then Philoſophicall meditations; and we ſee beautifull faces often weepe ſo gracefully, that ſome haue beene enamoured of their teares. I haue fully acquainted thee with our occurrents here, by my laſt Letters, nor will I let any opportunity paſſe without giuing my ſelfe the content of diſcourſing with thee in that kind; binde me ſo much vnto thee, as to doe the like on thy part: But if thy Letters be ſo ſhort, as vſually they are, I will now betimes tell thee, I will read them ſo often, as they ſhall become long enough in ſpite of thee. I know well how in the place where thou

art, thou oughteſt not loſe any minute of time; ſince opportunities laſt no longer; and reſolue thy ſelfe to take a thouſand vnprofitable iournies to thy Lords Chamber, before thou makeſt one to purpoſe. Great men vſe not to keepe Regiſters of the abſent, nor remembrancers of them they vſually forget: but rather to the contrary; they imagining there is no other thing on earth but themſelues, and what concernes them: (prouided, they finde any who looke like men) they neuer trouble themſelues to enquire for others, ſince with them aſſiduity often workes more then ſeruice; yea, and thoſe whom they would not affect for merit, they will loue by cuſtome: It is therefore neceſſary you be ſtill in ſight, and alwayes at hand for the entertainment of Fortune: It is a tradition the ſubtle Gaſcoynes at their deathes leaue to their Children: and truely as choler aſſumeth Armes out of whatſoeuer it encounters; ſo is it true, that occaſion taketh hold of all ſuch as preſent themſelues. We

ought to contract perfect loue with honeſt men, but yet not to be at oddes with others. Poyſons themſelues are neceſſary in ſome caſes; and ſince we are forced to liue among ſauage creatures, wee had neede haue the induſtry either to familiariſe or force them. I aduiſe thee not to looke before thee, behinde thee, and on euery ſide when thou ſpeakeſt; or to be in ſo great feare to be taken at thy word, as thou dareſt not tell what a Clocke it is if one askes thee. Thou ſhalt gaine much by being ſilent, the dumbe ſhall at all times therein exceede thee: For my part, I neuer make queſtion of ſpeaking, when I haue any thing in my head better then ſilence. I doe not hereby meane that wee ought to diſcouer our intentions by our lookes, or that our interiour conceptions appeare outwardly with all their paſſions, namely, of feare, hatred, or diſtemper. This were to betray our ſelues, and to giue ill example to others. But herein you are to make election of place, and

perſons, and not wilfully to depriue thy ſelfe of the moſt pleaſing fruite of mans life, there being not any, in whoſe breaſt we may ſecurely depoſite either our griefes or ioyes. Beſides, I would not haue thee of that Spaniards humour, who tooke for his deuice Que fi que no; but conſider with thy ſelfe that Reaſon is a ſacred thing▪ whereto thou art to yeeld, where euer it appeares. I confeſſe that moſt things are inuolued in vncertainties, and that humane Sciences haue very ſlender and vncertaine foundations; yet are there ſome truths ſo perſpicuous, and ſo abſolutely receiued into the Worlds approbation, as it were no leſſe then to lacke common ſenſe, to call them into queſtion; for hee who ſhould ſay, my Lord the Conſtable d'Eſdiguieres were not valiant, or my Lord the Cardinall of Richelieu, were not a man of able parts: doubtleſſe all men would wonder at him, as at one who ſought to introduce ſome new Sect, or indeauour to ouerthrow the fundamentall Lawes of

the Kingdome. Nay, I tell you yet more; you are piouſly to beleeue diuers ſots to be ſufficient men, ſince the World will haue it ſo; and that Kings are not the onely men who deſire complaſency; ſince if we meane to liue among others, we muſt ſometimes neceſſarily flatter, and frame our ſelues to their opinions Let vs then follow the iudgement of the wiſe, and the cuſtomes of the vulgar; let vs keepe our thoughts to our ſelues, and allow them our actions and out-ſides. As J haue aduiſed thee not to be ouer ſilent, ſo would I not haue thee ouer talkatiue, nor to weary any one with thy diſcourſe of Mountauban, or the exploits thou haſt there ſeene performed. I aſſure thee to auoyde the company of theſe boaſting companions; I would take poſte, goe to Sea, or fly to the Worlds end. They ſeeme to me to haue gotten a patent for prating, and that it were no leſſe then to take their purſe, if one ſhould offer to ſpeake a word in their preſence: But aboue all, it is very death

to me, when theſe fellowes come freſh out of Holland, or when they begin to ſtudy the Mathematicks. From Millan to Sienna I was haunted with one of theſe Chapmen; whoſe company I ſhall ſo long as I haue life, reckon among my greateſt misfortunes. Hee would needes reforme all the fortifications of thoſe ſtrong places wee paſſed by; bee trode on no earth at which he carped not, nor trauailed ouer any Mountaine, on which hee had not ſome deſigne; he ſet vpon all the Citties in the Dukedome of Florence; he deſired onely a certaine ſhort prefixed time, to take in all the States of Medena, Parma, and Vrbin: yea, I had much adoe to draw him from caſting his deſignes vpon the lands of the Church, and St. Peters Patrimony. Theſe be diſeaſes the roots whereof are not to be cut vp, without taking away the tongue withall: Nay, J feare when all this is done, there will be yet neede to paſſe further into the cure, and to vſe meanes to bereaue them of voyce, for the

generall good of ſuch as can heare. There is yet another ſort of importunate people, whoſe number doth ſo multiply in France, it is almoſt arriued to an infinity: Theſe haue not one halfe houres intertainement for thee, without telling thee the King is rayſing puiſſant forces; how ſuch a one is out of credit with his faction; another is a great ſearcher into, and medler in State-matters, and how a third diueth into all the intricacies of Court-buſineſſes. If you can haue the patience to heare them yet a while longer, you ſhall ſtraite vnderſtand how the Preſident Iannin was the man who had the trueſt intentions of all the miniſters of Juſtice: That it is expedient to ſhew a Maſter-peece of State, to giue reputation to the preſent current of affaires: That the Kings authority was intereſſed in this action: and that thoſe who ſought to cry downe the preſent gouernment, rather aimed at their particular aduantages, then redreſſe of diſorders. See here the ſtyle wherewith they perſecute

me euen to my poore Village, and which is a cauſe I loath State, and publique affaires. Tyre not therefore my eares at thine arriuall, leſt you turne mine aduerſary with intention to aſſault mee with theſe huge words. If you know not that theſe follies haue not alwayes the ſame aſpect, and that there are as well ſerious follies, as ſlight ones, I would admoniſh thee in this place: Now though a man at twenty can haue no great experience of the World, yet haue you a ſufficient cleare iudgement to keepe your ſelfe from being deluded, by the apparance of good, or by the outward luſter of euill. I had neede of more time then the bearer allowes mee, and of more words then a Letter is capeable of, ſufficiently to inſtruct thee what thou oughteſt to doe, and what to auoide; or to learne thee a Science wherin my ſelfe doe ſtudy in teaching thee. I will therefore onely ſay, ſince I am haſtned to make an end, that before all other

things thou art to offer thy whole will to God, if thou beeſt not able to giue the reſt; and to haue (at leaſt) good deſignes, if it be not as yet in thy power to doe any good deeds. I well know it is no ſlender taske, to vndertake to guard our ſelues from euill, where inticements are extraordinary, and the danger extreame, and where (thou wilt tell me) that if God will hinder thee from louing beauty, he had neede▪ make thee blind. I hauing no pleaſing anſwer to make thee hereto my deare Hydaſpe, I referre thee to thy Confeſſor: intreating thee to conſider, how if the King in the flower of his age wherein wee ſee him, and in the midſt of an infinity of obiects offering themſelues to giue him content, is yet notwithſtanding ſo firme in the reſolution to vertue, that he as eaſily ſurmounteth all voluptuous irregularities▪ as he doth his moſt violent rebels, and is not any way acquainted with forbidden pleaſures, nor doth glut himſelfe

euen with lawfull ones: If as I ſay, this truth bee generally auowed, I beſeech thee tell me why continency may not be placed among things poſſible? But I much feare, there is no meanes to gaine this for granted at thy hands; ſince thou beleeueſt as others doe, that to be chaſte, were no leſſe then to vſurpe vpon the poſſeſſion of married Wiues. Yet at the leaſt Hydaſpe, if this body of thine, being of ſufficient ability to ſend Collonies into each corner of the World, and to people the moſt deſart places, will needes be imployed; I intreate thee to ſtay there, without being tranſported with the debauches of the mouth, which haue no other limits then the loſſe of reaſon, and ruine of health. I ſhould be in vtter deſpaire were it told me, that my brother drinkes as much as though hee were in a continuall Feauer, and were as great a purueyer for his panch, as if hee were to enter into a beſieged City. I confeſſe thy inclination doth of it ſelfe

ſufficiently diuert thee from theſe Germaine vertues, and that thou art not much leſſe ſober then my ſelfe, who haue paſſed ouer three yeares without ſuppers, and who would willingly feed onely vpon Fennill and picktoothes, if I thought I could thereby recouer health. Yet truely this doth not hinder me from hauing ſome apprehenſion, when I conſider how the examples of great ones doth often giue authority to vice: and that to keepe our ſelues vpright in the midſt of corruption, is not an effect of the ordinary force of men: Conſider then once againe (Hydaſpe) that we are powerfully to reſiſt temptations. Haue an eye to the intereſt thou haſt to contayneithy ſelfe within the limits of an orderly life; and be well aduiſed, whether thou couldſt be contented to be of the proportion of thoſe good fellowes, whoſe ſpirits are choaked in their owne greaſe, and who become ſuch comely creatures, that if their bodies were

pierced, there would nothing paſſe forth of their wounds but▪ Wine and Porridge. Beſides, making profeſſion as thou doſt, to be a man of thy word, be not offended if I ſummon thee to obſerue what thou haſt promiſed mee: or that I freely tell thee, that if thou falleſt againe to the old game, I ſhall haue ſmall ſubiect to aſſure my ſelfe of thy fidelity in other thy former promiſes. Wert thou the King of the Indies, or thy life endleſſe, I would not forbid thee this exerciſe; but ſince wee haue ſcarce leaſure enough in this world to attayne vertue, nor ouer great poſſeſſions to ſecure vs from pouerty; beleeue me Hydaſpe, it is very dangerous to ſuffer ſhipwracke on ſhoare; and beſides, the expence of money, (which wee eſteeme as deare vnto vs as life) to loſe our ſences likewiſe, and our time, the laſt whereof is irrecouerable, is both ſhamefull and ſinfull; hauing here admoniſhed thee well neere, though confuſedly and

ſcatteredly of thoſe things thou oughteſt to flye, it were requiſite I ſhould likewiſe aduiſe thee of what were fit for thee to follow, and to cauſe if I could, good lawes to ariſe out of euill manners. But it is fit to take time to deliberate vpon a matter of ſuch importance, and truely to ſpeake herein to purpoſe, all the wit I haue, ioyned with that of others, were no more then ſufficient.
               
                  Yours, BALZAC.

                  To Hydaſpe from Balzac.
               LETTER IIII.
               MY deare Hidaſpe, if God had conferred a Kingdome vpon me, with condition not to haue mee ſleepe more then I doe: I ſhould prooue the

moſt vigilant Prince liuing, nor ſhould I neéde either Guards or Sentinels about my perſon. Surely there is not any (my ſelfe excepted) for whom Night was not made, ſince when the windes are calme, and all Nature quiet, I alone watch with the Starres. But I much feare leſt God will not be ſatisfied herewith, ſince I fore-ſee ſo many miſeries ready to rowle vpon me, as I haue no ſmall apprehenſion to become more wretched tomorrow, then I am at this preſent. The onely countenance of Hydaſpe would refreſh mee, and cauſe my paine to be in ſome ſort pleaſing. But fince there are now at leaſt a dozen great Cities, and a hundred Leagues of Snow betweene vs, I haue much adoe to forbeare dying, and to ſupport my ſelfe vpon my weakeſt part. Yet my meaning is not to haue thee returne hither; for (were it poſſible for me) I had much rather come to thee, and continually to gaze on that face whereof I haue drawne ſo many faire purtraicts.

It is true, there are few men liuing, whoſe loue we ſhould preferre before liberty. But aſſure thy ſelfe thy Maſter is of thoſe; be not therefore more proud then Henry the third, who firſt obeyed him. For my part, though I be naturally refractory, yet haue I euer had a ſpeciall inclination to his ſeruice, yea, when all things went croſſe with him, and that his beſt Friends forſooke him, I tooke pleaſure in periſhing, on purpoſe to affoord him ſome conſolation in his calamities. Many deſire a dependency on him out of their particular ends but me thinkes we ſhould haue more noble deſignes, ſince his onely vertue deſerueth to be followed, and to cauſe a preſſe whereſoeuer it paſſeth. In truth, the ſeruice we yeeld to ſo great a perſon, ought to hold the ranke of the chiefe recompences we are to expect; vet after this, there followeth another ſeldome fayling any of good parts, yea, or thoſe who haue but patience. If thou beeſt

of the one, or other ſort of ſuch men, remember this maxime; and doe not as thoſe honeſt perſons, who thinke they doe good ſeruice to the State, when they betray their Maſters. Beaſts themſelues are capeable of acknowledgement; and that Italian had ſome ſmall ſhew of Reaſon, who called thoſe Diuels, who cured Agues, good Angels. Yet truely it is no leſſe then to be ouer mannerly to goe ſo farre, nor would I thanke Gods enemies for thoſe gracious fauours I indeede receiue from him onely. But as touching the reſt of worldly affaires, there is no queſtion, but wee are to reflect vpon the neareſt occaſions Fortune affoordeth vs; and thoſe who ſeeke after more remote meanes, ſhall in concluſion finde from one degree to another, that it is to Hugh Capete to whom they are obliged. I was affraid leſt I ſhould have left my fingers vpon this paper, and haue diſenabled my ſelfe for euer writing more Letters after this, had I any longer continued

my diſcourſe. I tell thee no lye Hydaſpe, this is the third Winter wee haue had this yeare, and the greateſt irregularity I euer obſerued in Nature. For Gods loue inquire the cauſe of Father Ioſeph, and intreate him from me, if your ſelfe be not acquainted with him, that he would be pleaſed to imploy the credit he hath in Heauen, to cauſe the returne of warmer weather.

                  SIR,
               
               I Cannot conceiue your meaning, when you ſpeake of my friendſhip, as of a fauour, or predeſtination, or in being ſo prodigall of your complements and

commendations. There was ſufficient in the Letter you lately ſent, to bereaue me of ſpeech, and to make me flye to the Indies, were I forced to frame you a punctuall anſwer. But ſince you are vſually victorious, be pleaſed, I beſeech you, to permit your courteſie to worke the ſame effects, as doth your courage; and ſuffer me to yeeld vnto you in this occaſion, as I would doe in thoſe of Rochell, or Mountuban. I onely intreate you, henceforward to loue me with leſſe oſtentation and luſter then you haue done hitherto; and ſince it is not in my power to hinder you from hauing me in eſtimation, let me at the leaſt intreate you to carry the matter ſo, as though you had committed ſome ſinne; that is, without calling witneſſe, or confirming the fact: otherwiſe, doubtleſſe the world will ſuppoſe your affection to be iniurious to your iudgement▪ and I much feare, leſt I ſhould be blamed for blinding you, and for being more wicked then the late Warre, which was contented onely

to make diuers of our friends, blinkards. Truely that ſo compleate a perſon, whoſe acquaintance you commend vnto me; not finding me ſutable to the pourtraite you ſhewed him, may well ſay, you are not onely ſatisfied in being ſingly ſeduced, but ſeeke to raiſe Hereſies out of your errours, and a contagion out of your crazy conſtitution. This being ſo, I ſee not how I can better make good, either mine owne reputation, or your report, then by voluntarily baniſhing my ſelfe from the place where you are, and not by my preſence, to ouerthrow all the Honour you haue hither to acquired for me. If therefore you will not appeare a deceiuer, nor declare your ſelfe my aduerſary, leaue me I pray you, to my retiredneſſe, where I ſtudy onely to maintaine health, and take no other paines then to procure my owne repoſe, nor haue any conference, but with my ſelfe.
               
                  Your moſt humble ſeruant, BALZAC.

               To Mounſieur de Bois Robert from Balzac.
               
               LETTER VI.
               SInce the dead neuer returne but they affright vs: I was perſwaded I ſhould doe you no ſmall pleaſure, nor a little oblige you, in forbearing to appeare ſo much as on Paper before you, ſuffering you purely to enioy your accuſtomed pleaſures, without the mixture of any thing that might be diſtaſtefull vnto you. But ſince at this preſent you come to diſturbe the quiet of Church-yards, and to finde out a man, in affecting whoſe memory you might well be ſatisfied; I am forced to tell you, that the party you ſo highly eſteeme, is wholy remaining beyond the Alpes, and how this is onely his Ghoſt lately returned into France. I breake all

the Looking▪glaſſes I meete with, I blunder the water of all Riuers I croſſe, I auoid the ſight of all Paynters in any place where I come, leſt they ſhew me the patterne of my pale viſage. Yet if in the crazy caſe wherein I am, J were any way capeable of conſolation, I beſeech you to be aſſured, I ſhould take it as proceeding from the good ſucceſſe of your affaires, nor would I deſire of my diſeaſe any long reſpite, then what were requiſite to reioyce with you. But truely, it is an enemy who knowes not how to admit of conditions of peace or truce, and I am ſo happy as not to be ſuffered to quit my paines to reſume them. The meate I here eate for ſuſtenance, is to me as pleaſing as poyſon, and I endure life out of pennance, whereas you (in the place where you liue) ſpend the remainder of the Golden age, refuſing nothing to your ſences you lawfully may allow them. Though the Queenes Court be ſo chaſte, as it were eaſier to drinke drunk of a fountaine, then to take any diſhoneſt pleaſures

thene; and that to gaine admittance, it is requiſite to be firſt purified at the Porters lodge; yet are you allowed euen there to haue pleaſing temptations, and going elſewhere, to ſeeke out more ſolide contentments. But as for me in the caſe I am, I make no difference at all betweene louely creatures, and well limmed pictures: and the miſery I endure, hauing bereaued me of action, my wretched vertue is as much conſtrayned, as the ſobriety of the poore is neceſſary. In all this I adde not one word to the bare truth; and if the Counte of Pountgibaut had his pardon to let you know how it is with me, he would tell you that I am more withered then the laſt yeares Roſes, and how all the Ingeniers in an Army, were no more then ſufficient to remoue me. But my diſcourſe will be more pleaſing, if I ſpeake of that Head which deſerueth to fill a Diadem, then in continuing this wretched complaint. When at the firſt I ſaw concurrent in him ſo much valour, and ſo great beauty, I

neither tooke him for man nor Woman; but after hauing recollected my ſelfe, J ſuppoſed him to be the Amazonian Queene: and doubtleſle in the worlds infancy, it was to ſuch faces onely, whereto all people yeelded willing obedience, none quitting their ſeruice, euery mans duty being conformable to his inclination; ſo as the onely meanes then to be rebellious, was to beblinde. When this young Lord came to Rome at his returne from the battaile of Prague, I can well witneſſe the iealouſie he at once afforded both to men and their wiues, and of the great Prognoſtickes all ſuch gaue of him, who preſumed to haue any experience in future occurrents, either by the aſpect of Starres, or ſome more ſublime vnderſtanding: beſides, to conſider how at twenty yeares of age, there is ſcarce any corner of the knowne world he hath not traced, to encounter honourable actions▪ nor any ſort of combate wherein for the moſt part he hath not beene Conquerour; that he hath borne Armes againſt

                  Turkes and Jnfidels, that he hath appeared both in battailes and ſieges of Citties; that he hath giuen life to ſome enemies, and taken it from others. This (to ſpeake truth) is a thing God ſuffereth as rarely to be ſeene as deluges, and other great effects of his power or iuſtice. In a long proceſſe of time the meereſt Cowards may become Maiſters; were it by no other meanes, but that by ſeeing all men dye before them, they may inherit the whole world. Diuers likewiſe haue performed great exploits, who haue begun their actions either with groſſe errours, or meane aduentures. But as there are very few Riuers nauigable euen from their firſt fountaines, nor Countries where the Sun fendeth forth his full heate from the very day-ſpring: ſo are ſuch men (doubtleſſe) very rare and ſingular, who haue not any neede either of growth or yeares; nor are ſubiect either to the order of times, or rules of Nature. But I haue no purpoſe to folde vp a booke in a Letter: for though my griefe doe

ſometimes permit mee to ſpend ſome ſmall time vpon pleaſing ſubiects, yet will it not allow me to make thereon any long ſtay. I muſt therefore leaue off, during my ſhort good day, leſt I fall ſicke againe in your preſence, and once more clogge you with my complaints, inſteade of thanking you for your kinde remembrance, and aſſuring you of the great deſire I haue to remaine ſo long as I liue,

               A Letter from Balzac to Mounſieurde Bois Robert.

confident of your excellent conſtitution, as I cannot imagine it can be endamaged by that contagious ayre: Surely if it be not in ſuch ſort infected, that birds fall downe dead, and that the Springs be not corrupted, you haue ſmall cauſe to feare; and I haue heretofore ſeene you of ſo perfect a compoſition, and ſo ſtrong a ſubſtance, that an ordinary infection (I ſuppoſe) is vnable to ſeaze vpon you: And rather then I will haue any apprehenſion of your being carryed away with the current of thoſe who dye of this great mortality; I ſhall ſooner beleeue that God reſerueth you to make the worlds Epitaph, and thoſe laſt Songs appointed for the Cataſtrophe of all humane ioyes. Yet ere it come to this point, remember your promiſe, I pray you, and ſend me ſomething to rid me of the Megreme I haue taken in reading the ſotteries of theſe times. I cannot counterfeit the matter, but muſt confeſſe I taſte Verſes as I doe Mellons; ſo

as if theſe two ſorts of Fruites haue not a reliſh neare approaching to perfection, I know not how to commend them though on the Kings Table, or in Homers workes. Whatſoeuer you doe, yet at the leaſt permit nothing to your ſpirit which may wound your reputation; and aboue all, let me intreate you not to bee the man who may iuſtly be taxed of hauing violated the chaſtity of our Language, or for inſtructing the French in forraigne vices, vtterly vnknowne to their Predeceſſours. Poetry which God hath ſometimes made choice of, for the vttering of Oracles, and to vnfold his ſecrets to Mankinde, ought at the leaſt to be imployed in honeſt vſes: Nor is it a leſſe offence to make vſe thereof in vicious matters then to violate a Virgin. This I ſpeake vpon the ſubiect of our Friend, whoſe end I feare will hardly be naturall, if hee dye not the ſooner of his fourth Poxe. This is the ſecond time hee hath iſſued out of Paris by a

breach, hauing eſcaped as furious a flame as that of Troy. For my part, I cannot conceiue what ſhould be his deſigne. For to warre againſt Heauen; beſides, that he ſhall be but ſlackly accompanied in ſuch an expedition, nor hath a hundred hands as it is ſayd of Gyants; he ought to vnderſtand, it was an action they could neuer atchieue: and how in Cicilia there are Mountaines yet ſmoaking with their Maſſacre. We come not into this world to preſcribe Lawes, but to ſubmit our ſelues to thoſe we find, and to content ourſelues with the wiſdome of our fore-fathers, as with their Land and Sunne. And truely, ſince in matters indifferent, nouelties are euer reprehenſible, and that our Kings quit not their Lillies to quarter Tulipans in their armes: by how much greater right are we obliged to conſerue the ancient, and fundamentall points of Religion, which are by ſo much the more pure in that by their antiquity they approach

nearer to the Origine of things, and for that betweene them, and the beginning of all good, there is the leſſe time ſubiect to corruption. To ſpeake plainely, there is ſmall appearance that truth hath from the beginning of the world attended this man, on purpoſe to diſcouer it ſelfe vnto him in a Brothell or Tauerne; and to bee ſent forth of a mouth which comes ſhort in ſobriety to that of a Suiſse. I intend not to intermeddle with the Courts of Parliament, nor to preuent their Decrees by mine opinion: And to thinke to make this man more culpable then he is, were as much as to caſt Inke on an Ethiopians face; I owe ſo much to to the memory of our fore-paſt acquaintance, as I rather pitty him as a diſeaſed perſon, then purſue him as an enemy. I confeſſe he hath parts in him not abſolutely ill, nor doe I deny I haue much pleaſed my ſelfe with his freedome of ſpeech, ſo long as hee propoſed onely men for his obiect, and ſpared to ſpeake

of holy things. But when I heard ſay, he exceeded the bounds of inferiour matters, and banded himſelfe euen a gainſt what is tranſcendent to Heauen, I inſtantly quitted all acquaintance with him, and thought the onely pleaſure I could doe him, was to pray to God to reſtore him to his right ſences, and to take pitty on him as he did of the Jewes, who crucified our Sauiour. Hereafter I will be better aduiſed then to weary you with ſo long a diſcourſe, or to tyre my ſelfe in troubling you: But truely I thought I could doe no leſſe after three yeares ſilence, eſteeming this not to be ouer much for a man who is ſo ſlow a pay-maſter, for ſo many Letters hee oweth you. Yet cannot I conclude, before I informe you of ſome particulars touching the place where I am at this preſent, and of my imployments here. Firſt there is no day paſſeth wherein I ſee not the riſing and ſetting of the Sunne, and how during that time, I withdraw my

ſelfe from all other diſtractions, to enioy the purity of that faire light. Behold here in this preſent ſtate wherein I am, all the Courtſhip I vſe, and the onely ſubiection I oblige my ſelfe vnto. When I deſire to take the Ayre▪at other houres of the day, I muſt indeede confeſſe my eyes haue no obiects ſo vaſt as the Sea, or Appenines, nor doe I behold Rome vnder my feete as formerly I haue done: Yet doe I on all ſides diſcouer ſo pleaſing a proſpect, as though it fill not the capacity of my ſpirit ſo much as did the other, yet doth it farre more content me. Painters come forty dayes iourneyes hence, to ſtudy in my chamber, and if Nature cauſe her greatneſſe to appeare, euen from the bottome of the deepeſt Abyſſes, and darkeſt downefals, ſhe hath no leſſe placed her rareſt perfections vnder my windowes. Moreouer, I am plunged in abundance vp to the eyes, but my Riches are tacked to the twigs and branches of Trees; for as

Summer hath made mee plentifull, ſo will Winter reduce me to my former puuerty. In the meane time, I make Feaſts of Figges and Mellons, yea, out of the very Muſeadine Grapes I eate, there iſſueth liquor enough to make halfe a Kingdome drunke; and the thing whereat happily you will wonder, is, that I put all this into a ſicke mans ſtomacke, to whom well-nigh all good things are forbidden: yet haue I found a meanes to reconcile my ſurfets with my phiſicall receits, and in one and the ſame day I both enioy pleaſure, and endure paine; for I nouriſh my Feauer with excellent fruites, and purge it with Rubarbe: but howſoeuer I cannot hazard my health in more innocent debauches, ſince I performe them without troubling the tranquility either of Earth or Ayre, or without bereauing any thing of life. The firſt men the world produced, attained to extreame age with ſuch pure cates as mine are; for as of all bloudy meates

they onely vſed Cherries and Mulberries; ſo was the ſimplicity of their liues accompanied with a perfect repoſedneſſe; Nature as yet being voide of all Monſters: There was as then no mention either of Geryon, or Minotaure, nor of φφφφ. The Inquiſition and Parliament were onely in the Jdea of things; and of the two parts of Iuſtice, there was that onely knowne which gaue merits their due rewards.

               Another Letter from Balzac to Mounſieur de Bois Robert.
               LETTER. VIII.
               YOur Letter of the fifteenth of the laſt Moneth, came to my hands as I was ready to ſeale theſe Preſents. You might haue iuſt cauſe to taxe me, ſhould I

let them goe vnanſwered, or if this dead man appearing in your preſence, did not giue you thankes for the many excellent words you haue vſed in the adorning his Funerall Oration. I ſhould be but too proud if others were of your opinion, or were infected with the like errour you are; but I much feare you will not for the preſent herein finde a party equall to that of the League, and doe much doubt if all of a contrary conceite, ſhould be declared Criminals, there would hardly be any acquitted in this Kingdome. Howſoeuer, I hold my ſelfe much obliged vnto you, in conferring ſo liberally that vpon me, you ſo well know I want, and for beſtowing all your colours and mercuriall mixtures to make mee ſeeme beautifull: I will bee well aduiſed how I fall out with him who flatters me, and in the loue I beare my ſelfe, I ſhall at all times ſuffer a riuall with much ſatisfaction. Since a certayne Gentleman in Germany pleaſeth himſelfe in being ſtiled King of Ieruſalem, and ſince thoſe

who haue no reall patrimonies, tickle themſelues with meere Titles and Armes: by the like reaſon may J imagine my ſelfe to be the man you will needes haue me, and receiue from your courteſie the qualities my Natiuity hath not affoorded me. But to disblame both of vs, I beſeech you hereafter to haue more care of my modeſty, and not to put me in danger either to loſe it, or not to beleeue you. It is no leſſe then to wrong the Angels, to call other ſpirits then theirs diuine, yea all the Celeſtiall Court is ſenſible of ſuffering that name to fall to ground. For my part, I am ſo farre from freeing my ſelfe of humane defects, as I doe abſolutely auow, there is not any more imperfect then J am, no not ſo much as blinkards and maymed perſons. I eſpye faults enough, on which ſide ſoeuer I ſee my ſelfe, and my wit is ſo disfurniſhed of forraine perfections, as I hold no man for learned, if he be not adorned with thoſe abilities whereof I

am ignorant, yea euen in that whereof you ſuppoſe me to haue a perfect vnderſtanding: I haue in truth no more then meere doubts and coniectures, ſo as if there were a man of perfect Eloquence to befound at the worlds end, I would goe in pilgrimage on purpoſe to ſee one contrary to N N. To ſpeake truely, there is great difference betweene filling the care with ſome pleaſing ſound, and expreſſing the fancies of Artizans and Clownes according to Grammaticall Rules; and in reigning ouer the ſpirits of men by force of Reaſon; and to ſhare the gouernment of the World with Conquerours and lawfull Kings▪ I haue not the preſumption to ſuppoſe I am arriued at this point; but I likewiſe thinke few haue attayned thereto, and the Philoſophers Stone were with more eaſe to be extracted, then the Eloquence I propoſe to my ſelfe. It is as yet a kind of Terraincognita, and which hath not beene diſcouered together with the Indies. The Romans themſelues could onely recouer

the bare image, as they did of thoſe Territories, ouer which they triumphed by a falſe title: Yea Greece her ſelfe how vainely ſoeuer ſhee boaſted thereof, yet ſeazed ſhee onely vpon the ſhadow, not ſeeing the ſubſtance: So as vpon the matter diuers haue poſſeſſed others with that conceite, being firſt deceiued themſelues; and are obliged to the reſtitution of an ill acquired reputation. Many of our friends haue fallen into the like errours; I will not name them, fearing to aſtoniſh at the firſt ſight, all ſuch to whom you ſhall ſhew this Letter; or leſt I ſhould publiſh odious truthes. It ſhall ſuffice I tell you by the way, that if to attaine perfect Eloquence, it ſufficed onely to weary our hands with Writing, none could therein any way compare with our Practitioners and Pen-clarkes. Yet is there not any reaſon why thoſe who performe poore things, ſhould draw their weakeneſſe to their owne aduantage, or imagine I flatter them. A man is as well damned

for one ſingle deadly ſin, as for a thouſand without repentance; nor is it the ſtrength of their iudgement, which hinders them from committing many faults, but the onely barrenneſſe of their wits which enables them not to write▪ many bookes. I might enlarge my ſelfe vpon this ſubiect, and diſcouer diuers ſecrets vnto you, the world is not yet acquainted with. But I haue neither time nor paper left, ſaue onely to tell you that J am

               Another Letter from Balzac to the ſame man.
               LETTER IX.
               IVnderſtand ſome haue taxed me for ſaying (in my laſt Letter vnto you) the ſpirits of Angels; ſince Angels being all

Spirits, it ſeemed vnto them to be two inſeperable tearmes: But to let ſuch men ſee how ill grounded their Obiection is, (and I ſuppoſe our iudgements will herein agree) it may pleaſe them to remember, that we call Angels Spirits, to diſtinguiſh them from bodies, being a farre different ſignification from what the word Spirit importeth, when we take it for that part of the ſoule which vnderſtandeth, reaſoneth, and imagineth, and which cauſeth ſo different effects in the ſoule of a foole, and that of a diſcreete perſon. Queſtionleſſe (euen among Angels themſelues) there may be a difference found betweene the ſpirits of ſome, and other ſome of them, to wit, in the faculty of Ratiotination and Comprehenſion: Since thoſe of the laſt order are not illuminated, but by meanes of them of the precedent rankes, and ſo of the reſt euen to the firſt; which haue a farre more ſublime intelligence then the inferiour Orders, which as no man (how ſmally ſoeuer ſeene in the Metaphiſiques)
                  
will doubt of) come as farre ſhort of the vnderſtanding the firſt Order is indued with, as they doe of their degree. We are therefore to admit of this difference, and ſay, that an Angell is doubtleſſe a Spirit, to wit, he is not a Body: but withall that an Angell hath moreouer a ſpirit, namely, this faculty of knowing, and conceiuing either leſſer, or more large, according to the priuiledge of his Order. So as if a Spirit hath no other ſignification then a ſimple and incompoſed ſubſtance, this inequality were not to be found among the Angels, being equally ſimple, and farre from all compoſition and mixture. When then I ſay it was a wrong done to Angels to call any other Spirits diuine ſaue onely theirs: I take the word Spirit in its ſecond ſignification, and thereby ſeperate it from the Angell, and diſtinguiſh the ſimple ſubſtance, and nature Angellicall from that faculty of the Soule tearmed the vnderſtanding. But that one may not ſay, the ſpirit of Angels, becauſe they are all ſpirit, is a

reaſon very reproueable, and whereto there wanteth nothing but verity to make it no vntruth; for that beſides the ſpirit or vnderſtanding affoording to Angels ſo eminent a knowledge of diuine things, they are likewiſe indued with will, cauſing them to loue what they know, and with memory dayly adding ſomething to their naturall intellect. But admitting I ſhould yeeld to whatſoeuer theſe my reprehendors would haue, and that I limit the word Spirit within the bounds of its firſt ſignification, I ſhould ſtill haue the better of it. For in truth our ordinary manner of conception cannot poſſibly repreſent Angels without bodies, yea, and the Church it ſelfe affoordeth them ſo faire, beautifull, and perfect ones, that from thence the beſt Poets ordinarily picke their Compariſons to pourtraite the rareſt beauties. Beſides, if in holy Writ, mention be often made of the Spirit of God, euen before he aſſumed our

corporall ſubſtance, and in a ſence which could not be vnderſtood of the third perſon in Trinity, why may not I as iuſtly ſpeake of the ſpirits of Angels, being in compariſon of Gods Spirit, no better then earth, and materiall; and which approacheth not by many degrees vnto the ſimplicity and purity of this maieſteriall cauſe, being as the Mother to all the reſt. You ſee here, that (howſoeuer) it is very dangerous to ſtudy by halfe parts, or to vnderſtand ſome ſmall matter more then thoſe who neuer were at Schoole; yet is it out of ſuch men as theſe, that Nouelliſts and ſuperſtitious perſons are raiſed; yea, and all the reſt, who haue reaſon enough to doubt, but not ſcience ſufficiently to determine rightly.

               LETTER X.
               
                  SIR,
               
               YOu haue anticipated what I intended to ſay, and haue not left for me in all Rhetoricke, either complement or commendations to returne you. This is to force ingratitude by exceſſe of obligation, and to reduce me to the neceſſity of being indebted vnto you after I be dead. In truth it were neceſſary I had the power to promiſe you felicity and Paradiſe, in requitall of the vowes and ſacrifices you offer vnto me, and that I were in caſe to be your aduocate, inſtead of being thus put to a ſtand to anſwer you. It may be you haue a minde in ſuch ſort to diſguiſe me to my ſelfe, as I ſhall not hereafter know who I am,

but be forced to forget my owne name, by cauſing me to imagine I am not the ſame man I was yeſterday. Proceede at your pleaſure to deceiue me in this ſort, for I am reſolued not to conteſt with you in this kind, to the worlds end: nor to arme my ſelfe againſt an enemy, who onely throwes Roſes at my head. I ſhould be very glad all my life would paſſe in ſuch pleaſing Dreames, and that I might neuer awake, for feare of knowing the truth to my preiudice. But for the attayning this happineſſe, it is neceſſary I doe quite contrary to your aduice, and neuer quit my Countrey-houſe, where none comes to enter into compariſons, or conteſt with me, for the aduantage I haue ouer bruite beaſts, or my Lackeyes. I agree with you that it is the Court-voice which either approueth or condemneth all, and that out of its light, things though neuer ſo perfect, haue no appearance: But I know not whether it were my beſt, to make that

my owne caſe; ſince I feare leſt my preſence there, will rather preiudice my reputation and your iudgement, then make good your poſition. Vpon the matter, if there be any tollerable parts in me, they appeare ſo little outwardly, as I had neede haue my breaſt opened to diſcouer them: And in concluſion you will finde it a ſufficient obligation for me, to haue you thinke my ſoule is more eloquent then my diſcourſe, and that the better part of my vertue is concealed: Yet ſince my promiſe is paſt, I muſt reſolue for Paris, though it prooue as ſtrange a place vnto mee, as if I were out of the World, or as though they ſhould chaſe raw Courtiers thence, as they doe corrupt Stateſ-men. To tell you plainely how the caſe ſtands, J am none of thoſe who ſtudy the ſlighteſt actions of their liues, and who vſe Art in all they doe, or doe not. I cannot light vpon that accent, wherewith they authoriſe their follies, nor make of euery meane matter a

myſtery by whiſpering it in the eare: And leſſe doe I know how to palliate my faults; or make ſhew of an honeſt man, if really I be not ſo: Now though I could make my ſelfe capable of theſe Arts, yet would it anger mee ſhrewdly, if after hauing paſſed nine Ports, and abidden many backe-caſts to get thither, to be at laſt ſtayed at the Tenth: Nay, ſhould I chance to get admittance; what a hell were it for me to come into a Coū
                  trey where Hatts are not made to couer heads, and where all men grow crooked with extreame cringeing. Conſider therefore, whether this humour of mine would ſute with the place where you are; or if a man whoſe points and garters ſeeme ponderous vnto him, and who findes it a difficult matter to obey Gods Commandements, and the Kings Edicts, can be drawne to bee obliged to new lawes, or procure to himſelfe a third ſeruitude. In the ſtate wherein I now am, all the Princes in the World act

Comedies to make me ſport. I enioy all the riches of Nature, from the Heauens to riuer-waters, and I eaſily obtaine of my moderate ſpirit, what I cannot attaine vnto by the liberality of Fortune. This being thus, will you perſwade me to change thoſe benefits none enuy, with your feares, hopes, and ſuſpicions; or not thinke it fit I value liberty, for which the Hollanders haue made Warre (now this fifty yeares) againſt the King of Spaine? But ſince I haue paſſed my word, I am not reſolued to reuoke it; yet when I muſt needs bid adieu to my Woods and ſolitary places, which haue taught mee ſo many good things, and quit this inchanted Palace of mine, where all my thoughts are reall inſpirations; I ſhall haue a great conflict within me, to keepe my word with you. I will beleeue none but your ſelfe, who beſt know whether or no I haue reaſon to loue this priſon my Father builded for me, or this little ſpot of Land, where there is no defect

but a Fountaine of Gold, and other vnneceſſary things; there being elſe ſufficient here to ſatisfie a ſober perſon; I muſt confeſſe the laſt great raines haue blemiſhed all the beauty abroad: And Winter which by right ſhould bee condemned neuer to depart from Swedland, is already come to croſſe the content I formerly enioyed: But howſoeuer, there are yet pleaſing remedies to auoyde theſe preſent incommodities. The perfumes I burne, and whereof I am as prodigall, as though I exacted tribute from the Countries from whence they come, maketh me the leſſe to miſſe the ſweetneſſe of the Spring: And a great fire reſembling the brighteſt beauty, which I tearme the Sunne of the night, and darke dayes, watcheth at all houres in my Chamber, and giueth light to my reſt, as well as to my Studies. Before this witneſſe (which I neuer looſe ſight of) all Nature is the ſubiect of my meditation▪ and I conceiue workes, which happily may merit a

place in your Library, and to bee choſen Citizens of that diuine Republique. I know not what men doe moſt eſteeme in bookes, but I am confident, that in this I compoſe, Iuſtice and Maieſty, ſhall appeare ſo euenly tempered, as none ſhall therein find any thing either ſauoring of cowardize or cruelty. I take and make vſe of the art of Ancients; as they would haue done from me, had I beene the firſt man liuing. But I haue no ſeruile dependancy vpon their conceptions, nor am I borne their vaſſall, to follow no other lawes or examples, ſaue theirs: To the contrary (if I deceiue not my ſelfe) my inuention is farre more happy then my imitation; and as there haue beene in our age diuers new Stars diſcouered, till this preſent vnperceiued; ſo I in matter of Eloquence, ſeeke out ſingularities, hitherto vnknowne to any. It is certaine, and you know it as well as my ſelfe, you who know good things when you ſee them, and who are the Authour of diuers; that

there are none ſo ſeuere Muſes as the Frēch, nor any tongue more hating affectation, and bare apparances of things then ours. All kinde of ornaments therefore are not propper for her: and her purity is at ſuch ods with the exorbitant licence of other languages, that a French vice in this kind, is often made a forraine vertue. But (in this caſe) we are to take aduice of the vnderſtanding and eare; and for my part, I haue for my patterne herein, the Idea of the great Cardinall of Richelieu, as though he were preſent and priuy to my conceptions, or as if he at all times receiued or reiected them, as they happen to bee either good or otherwiſe: But to tell you the truth, I know not well which way I paſſe by this tedious and vntroden path, or what vſe I intend to make of theſe ſo many impertinent ſpeeches. But I am as often out of my way, in the allies of my hermitage, and I haue many times much vſe of a man, to let me know whether it be day or night, and to order my times and actions; yet

would I haue you know, I doe not vſually fall into ſuch errours, but onely before ſuch as I loue and honour, as I doe you; at all other times, be it in my viſits, or in my Letters; I will bee well aduiſed, how I ſuffer the end to come farre ſhort of the Exordium; and from the firſt word, I make all the haſte I may to come to

               LETTER XI:
               LEt me intreate you, that we may deface out of our intended Hiſtory whatſoeuer hath paſſed theſe laſt four Months, let vs imagine that time to haue hapned in ſome fabulous age, and (for our mutuall content) let vs herein learne the Art of

                  Obliuion. Had I beene conſtrayned to quit our ancient acquaintance, being of equall age to either of vs▪ and whereof I make as great account as of my Fathers inheritance; ſurely J had beene driuen to the like ſtreights, as hee who with one hand ſhould be forced to cut off the other. It is then the neceſſity of my inclination, which forceth mee to affect Philander, though he were mine enemy: and this paſſion doth ſo pleaſe me, that ſhould any man cure me thereof, I would commenſe ſuit with him for my former malady. I will not accuſe any man for the fault committed: Let vs both imagine it to be a Child without a Father, and to cleare all men, let vs lay it vp among the preſent miſeries, and impute it to the power of fortune. I will rather ſuppoſe it to be the laſt effect of the Commet, then impute it to any act of your ſpirit, or that you contriued the diſcontent I haue endured. I ſweare vpon whatſoeuer is Auguſt or Sacred amongſt men, I haue no leſſe loued you then my

ſelfe, and haue equally ſhared my ſelfe betweene my brother and Philander. Hence▪ forward I deſire to doe the like. But let vs leaue all theſe faire words, and petty nicities to poore ſpirits, and hereafter conferre together with ſuch liberty as Philoſophy affoordeth vs. But aboue all things J intreate you not to ſuffer a ſuppoſed wiſdome to reſtraine you within particular reſpects and petty conſiderations, which may hinder you from ſpeaking high in what concernes me. Feare not to ſhew your ſelfe my ſure friend, for it is neyther theft, nor throat-cutting; and of the two extreamities of defect and exceſſe, it is better to fall into the faireſt and leaſt faculty. Otherwiſe if Friendſhip ſhould neuer appeare, but remaine at all times as a recluſe, what better vſe can we draw thence then of hatred alike hidden? and at the worſt what vſe is there to be made thereof, but onely for the pleaſure of conuerſation, and neceſſity of commerce? But I will leaue this diſcourſe whereof I hope you

haue no vſe, to aske you ſome newes or the little man you ſometimes ſee, and who imagineth the King bereaueth him of all ſuch offices as he beſtoweth vpon Mounſieur de Luynes. I make no queſtion but he dayly tormenteth both ſoule and body, for that he is not alwayes at his Maſters elbow, nor is ſo ordinarily ſeene at the Loouer, as the ſteps of the great ſtaires, or the Swiſſes Hall. Threeſcore and ten yeares of experience haue not ſufficed to ſettle his ſpirit, and he who ſhould obſerue his diſcourſe without knowing him, inſtead of ſuppoſing his beard to be ſiluerhaired, would rather thinke hee had caſt flowre on his face; yet are wee to confeſſe, he is one of the rareſt Court-peeces, and that it is no ſmall ſport to ſee him in a chafe againſt the State, and the age wee liue in, which he maliceth more then he doth his creditors. Make quiet vſe of ſo pleaſing a diuerſion, and remember the World could not end, nor Nature bee perfect, if there were not as well ſuch

men as there are Apes and Monkies.

               LETTER XII.
               
                  SIR,
               
               I Beſeech you reſerue your counſell for thoſe who are not as yet reſolued; and goe perſwade the Count Maurice to marry, and beget Captaines for another age. As for me, I loue both ſolitarineſſe and ſociety, but will not be continually tyed to either. If my Father had beene of my minde, I had remayned where I was before he got me. I imagine the party you deſire to beſtow on me, is faire; but ſtay awhile, and ſhe will not be ſo: She is no foole; but happily more witty then is

neceſſary for an honeſt woman to be: She is rich, but my liberty is vnprizeable. So as to make mee alter my reſolution, there is no other meanes then an expreſſe commandment from God, with this propoſition, either of death, or a wife. Thoſe creatures at Paris are ordinarily ſo cunning, and well practiſed, they finde nothing ſtrange the firſt night they are married: and here, they haue not wit enough to giue their bodies right motion; but in all places they make men alike miſerable, as doe Feauers, Warre, or Pouerty. To tell you freely how the matter ſtands, I will not dayly diſturbe my ſelfe in telling my Miſtreſſes haires, for feare ſhe ſhould beſtow them as fauours vpon her familiars; or to be iealous leſt all the women who come to ſee her, were young men diſguiſed. I cannot endure, that in my abſence ſhe and her gallant drinke to the health of their Cuckold, and that I be the ſubiect of all their chatt. And on the other ſide, it were farre worſe, were ſhee chaſte, yet a

ſcowld, and to be troubled with an enemy to aſſault me day and night. J rather affect a tractable vice, then a tyrannicall vertue: But if there bee any other remedy, I will not be reduced to ſuch ſtraights, as to chuſe the leaſt of euills; ſince there is not any of this nature, I eſteeme not vnſufferable. In a word Philander, my neighbours example doth not alittle terrifie me: hee hath begotten ſo many dumbe, blinde, and deformed creatures, he is able to furniſh a reaſonable Hoſpitall. I will not be bound to loue Monſters, becauſe they are mine, and were I aſſured not to be defectiue in this kind, I could well forbeare hauing children; who if they be wicked, will deſire my death; if wiſe, expect it; if the honeſteſt liuing, yet will they now and then reflect vpon it. But it may bee (you will ſay) if my reſolution were generally receiued, the Sea ſhould bee no longer charged with ſhips, and the Land would become deſert. To this Philander J anſwer,

that ſince the World is not alwayes to endure, it were farre better to haue vertue become its Cataſtrophe, then any thing elſe; ſince it cannot finde a more faire and honeſt concluſion, then a generall abſtinence in this kind.

               SInce theſe be the particular dayes appointed for Deuotion: we being now in the ſeaſon of publick Eccleſiaſtical mourning, and it importing euery man to apply himſelfe in the affaires of his conſcience; you muſt excuſe me, if I be ſhort in my conuerſation with you in this kind, and keepe all my diſcourſe for my Confeſſor. It were ſtrange wee

ſhould herein doe leſſe then the Bells, who are now all dumbe, or trouble the commerce contracted betweene God and man, onely to tell idle Stories. Let vs therefore (I pray you) ſurceaſe all ſorts of newes, and not mingle any prophane matter with this holy Weeke, which deſireth to be as pure as a Virgin. The high Feaſt wee are falling vpon, will ſet vs at liberty, after which, inſtead of three Letters you haue written vnto me, I am contented to returne you ſixe anſwers

               To the ſame from Balzac.
               
               LETTER XIIII.
               YOur plaints are both right eloquent, and very vniuſt: I can at leaſt well aſſure you, my thoughts are not ſo often here, as where you are, and if my

Letters come not ſo farre, it is becauſe they can finde none to carry them. But by theſe preſents I purpoſe rather to reioyce with you for the recouery of your health, then to afflict my ſelfe vnſeaſonably. Things paſt are to be reckoned as nothing, and what happened yeaſterday, is as farre from vs as the life of Charlemaine. Wherefore, I who haue a perfect experience of worldly affaires, would as ſoone comfort you for the loſſe you receiued by the death of your great Grandfather, (ſo many yeares dead before you were borne) as for the late danger of your Feauer, ſince it is now gone. The beſt is, the Phiſitians haue not ſo farre exhauſted you, but there yet remaines bloud ſufficient, to beſtow part thereof in your Miſtreſſes ſeruice, and to fill the world with your offences; ſo long as the ruines of your head may be repaired, and your beauty budde againe with the next Roſes, there is nothing loſt hitherto; but indeede if inſtead of your former head,

you carryed the figure of a ruſty Murrion or rotten Pumpian, I ſhould much pitty you in ſuch a plight, and would preſently adde you to the number of decayed buildings. Now when all is done Philander, it is but a little water and earth mingled together, wee ſtudy to conſerue with all the maximes of wiſedome, and all the rules of Phiſicke. Let vs reflect I pray you, vpon our better part, and hereafter labour as well to cure our ſelues of Vice, as of the Feauer. It is that image of God wee defaced by our owne hands, we ought to repaire; and our firſt innocency is the thing it behoueth vs to aske at his hands, rather then our former health. For my part, I am abſolutely reſolued to lead a new life, and to take no other care but for my ſoules health, and to procure the ſame for others. And truely it were farre better to conſecrate this great Eloquence of ours to his glory, who gaue it vs, then to imploy it in commending fooles, and in making our

ſelues to be praiſed among children. The P. E. whom happily you know, and who hath one of the beſt, and moſt polite wits of all his company, confirmes mee all he can in this my deſigne, and euery houre of his company is as much to mee, as eight dayes of reformation; yet is hee not a man who profeſſeth that pale vertue which affrighteth all men, and is incompatible with humane infirmities: but quite contrary, he flattereth mee in reprehending my errours, and inſtead of the pennance I deſerue, he is contented to enioyne me honeſt recreations. Your brother will tell you more, about eight dayes hence, and will giue you an accompt both of my actions and intentions; beleeue him as truth it ſelfe; and beſides, aſſure your ſelfe further vpon my word, he is worth ſome Doctor and an halfe, and hath a good wit, without ſpeaking of his zeale and vertue.

                  To Olympa from Balzac.
               LETTER XV.
               I Am much troubled to finde the cauſe of your teares; to impute them to the death of your Husband, is happily but the bare pretext. It is not to be imagined that Death which cauſeth the moſt beautifull things to become offenſiue to the dayes brightneſſe, and affrighteth thoſe who formerly admired them; ſhould make that man pleaſing vnto you, who was neuer ſo to any. Yet you ſeeme with him to haue loſt all, and doe ſo cunningly counterfeit the afflicted, I can hardly beleeue what I ſee: Can it be poſſible, you ſhould be thus peſtered to ſupport your good fortune with patience, or be really ſo ſorrowfull for the loſſe of a poore gouty fellow, whoſe

ouer-long liuing I ſhould rather haue thought it fit to comfort you? But if this be not thus, what doe you with all this great mourning, wherein you plunge your ſelfe, and this mid-night neuer remouing from your Chamber? I muſt confeſſe I was neuer more aſtoniſhed, then to finde ſuch an Equipage of ſadneſſe about you, accompanied with ſuch elaborate actions, and ſo conſtrayned countenances; and without ieſting Olympia, (after this I haue ſeene) there remaineth nothing for the full expreſſion of a fained paſſion, but onely to weare blacke ſmockes, and to be attended by Moores. Yet is it time, or neuer to returne to your right ſences, and to conclude your Comedy, let me intreat you to leaue off all theſe ſower faces to fooles. Caſt off this blacke vaile which hinders me from ſeeing you, and conſider that fiue foote of ground, is worth you two thouſand pounds by the yeare. To raiſe ſuch a rent, the reuenewes of halfe

ſome Kingdome were hardly ſufficient; nor can you taxe mee for not ſpeaking herein the truth, ſince I haue it from your owne mouth. Is it not almoſt incredible, ſo ſmall a corner of earth, ſhould yeeld ſo large a reuenew. I doubt not but diuers will ſuppoſe it beares Pearles or Diamonds. But I had almoſt forgot the moſt important buſineſſe▪ 
                  J am to impart vnto you, and where upon I firſt intended to write. I muſt therefore ſay, you are to haue a ſpeciall care, neuer to repaire the loſſe you haue lately receiued; aſſuring your ſelfe there is no one man in the world worthy to enioy you priuatiuely: you ſhall be anſwerable for thoſe excellent qualities Nature and Art haue conferred vpon you for the commanding of men, if you ſay you cannot liue without ſubmitting your ſelfe to one. Herein Olympa, you ought not ſuffer the vaine ambition to be wife to a great Signiour to tranſport you, or the aduantage of entring into the Loouer in

Carroch, to cauſe you quit the happineſſe you haue to be Queene of your ſeife▪ How much gold ſoeuer one beſtow in fetters, and how glorious ſoeuer the ſcruitude be, yet aſſure your ſelfe they are but a couple of bad matters. Of late there was not any part of your body, whereof another was not maſter, he would examine your very Dreames and thoughts: It was not in your power to diſpoſe of one ſingle haire, nay he robbed you of your very name. See here Olympa, what it is to haue a Husband, and what you torment your ſelfe for with ſuch prodigall teares. Methinkes it were all you could, or ought to doe were he reuiued; or if the newes of his death were doubtfull.

                  To Cryſolita from Balzac.
               LETTER XVI.
               I Muſt needes diſabuſe you Cryſolita, and informe you better in the Hiſtory of that old Haxtris, you ſuppoſed to bee a very Saint. Firſt, you are to vnderſtand, ſhee is extracted out of her mothers ſinnes, nor was euer any Virginity ſo britle, as that ſhe brought into this world. It is very likely ſhe hath loſt all remembrance of any ſuch matter: But people of thoſe dayes, ſticke not openly to affirme, that the firſt time ſhe had liberty to goe abroade, (at her comming home) ſhe miſt her gloues and Maiden-head. After this, her beauty augmenting with riper yeares, ſhee drew the eyes of all Italy vpon her; and ſold that fifty times at Court, ſhe had formerly loſt at Schoole: But ſince then, ſhe is arriued to an experience, farre ſurpaſſing that of the

Lord Chancellor, or the Popes Datary: and when I ſhall tell you, ſhee knoweth whether there be more pleaſure in a circumciſed Courtizan, then in a Chriſtian; and that ſhe hath experienced the actiuity of Jndians and Muſconites, yet ſhall I relate but halfe the ſtory. So it is, that now after ſhe hath filled▪ 
                  Limbo with her paricidiall leachery, and bin threeſcore yeares a Lectoreſſe in vice, ſhee would make you confident of her conuerſion: Yet am I credibly informed, that not hauing now any thing worth the loſing, ſhe is turned Solicitreſſe, to entice others to vice; nor is there any chaſtity can eſcape her, if it take not ſanctuary in the Carmolites. Shee cannot endure there ſhould be one honeſt woman in the whole City; this angering her as much, as though the robbed her, or had declared her ſelfe her enemy. Yet is this the Saint you ſo much talke of C
                     ••
                  ſolita, and the very ſame old Madame, from whom you promiſed me ſo many miracles. Now I, who know her very heart, write vnto

you, what hereafter you ought to belecue: for let her make what ſhew ſhe will, yet I know ſhe is as far from her conuerſion, as from her youth. The Capuchins themſelues could not cauſe her to paſſe her word to turne honeſt woman the next grand Iubile; for inſtead of a better anſwer, ſhe plainly told them, ſhe had not as yet diſpatched her buſineſſe, and could well ſtay till another, which will happen about eight and twenty yeares hence.

                  Clorinda,
               
               FOr that I am not in your conceite ſufficiently puniſhed with my Feauer, you belike thinke it fitting, I ſhould yet be further afflicted with Loue; ſo as there is nothing wanting to end my good fortune,

but onely a law-ſuite and a quarrell. In this very place, deſigned for repoſe and ioy, I continually burne, I tell each houre, and my dreames are full of diſtractions. Yet after all this, you ſuppoſe you much oblige me in wiſhing mee euery night good reſt, as though it were not in your power to giue it me. I had once a Maſter of your humour: he had meanes enough to procure my aduancement, yet he ſuppoſed it ſufficient to wiſh mee well, and that J ought to reſt ſatisfied, ſo long as he ſayd, I deſerued a good fortune. I know not whether it be your intention to vſemee in this manner: but howſoeuer I cannot take it ill, though you mocke mee, ſince you doe it ſo handſomely. Aduiſe me if you thinke good, to ſeeke for a quiet life in Germany; caſt mee headlong downe ſome Cliffe, and then ſay God guide me; wiſh me a good night out of your chamber, all this concernes not me Clorinda. If I receiue iniuries from you, I am no longer in ſtate to take notice of them. Yet I ſhould thinke

you might be ſomewhat more ſenſible of my ſorrowes, and at leaſt to ſhew your ſelfe pittifull towards me, though you reſerue your affections for ſome other. It is no generous act to kill a ſicke perſon, there is not any ſo common a Quacke-ſaluer but can doe as much. And in concluſion Clorinda, all the honour you will attayne vnto herein after my death, is onely to haue had ſome ſmall force more then my lingering Feauer.

               Another Letter to Clorinda, from BALZAC.
               
               LETTER XVIII.
               WEE are not ſeperated either by Seas or Mountaines: your lodging and mine touch, yet▪ finde I it an impoſſibility to ſee you. If you were

at Iapan, or in the Kingdome of China, I would reſolue my ſelfe for thoſe places, and I ſhould finde ſome Barke or other bound for that voyage: thinke not I diſſemble, there is not any ſhelue in all the Sea, nor hazard to vndergoo in ſo dangerous a voyage, whereof I haue not leſſe apprehenſion, then the meeting this little brother of yours. But it may be it is your ſelfe, who make theſe difficulties, I ſuppoſe, to ariſe elſe-where. You are glad you want no pretext, on purpoſe to vexe mee when you pleaſe. If it be ſo Clorinda, let mee be ſo much obliged vnto you, as to conceale it. I had farre rather be deceiued, then know the truth to my preiudice: Either my company is troubleſome vnto you, or you reſerue your fauours for ſome other friend. Howſoeuer, I am contented to beleeue your Mother is ſicke, and that you cannot quit her Chamber: there are no excuſes ſo counterfeit, I accept not for currant, ſo long as they releiue my ſpirits: Conſidering the power you haue ouer me, it is a ſmall

matter to ſatisfie your ſelfe in making mee conceiue the beſt. Yet muſt I thanke you Clorinda, for violating Iuſtice ſo formerly, and faining reaſons with purpoſe to erre punctually. By this meanes you will not ſuffer me ſo much as to ſoeme miſerable, and you cozen me ſo cunningly, I can neither bemoane my ſelfe, nor beſhrew you▪ Yet is it impoſſible I can for euer conceale my ſenſibilities: What violence ſoeuer I offer to my humour, it can no longer be contained. To be ſhort Clorinda, if you loued me as you ſay, you would not liue with mee in the faſhion you doe; but I ſhould receiue from you reall fauours, not vaine apparances; and ſay what you will, wee ſhall meete alone once in our liues: I beſeech you, let not this word affright you, for if any ſhould finde vs in this manner, none will imagine we conſpire againſt the King, or ſuſpect I reade Magicke to you. Innocent actions carry their warrant with them, nor is there any neceſſity that two cannot bee together without making a

third. Beleeue me Clorinda, if we ſhut our ſelues for three houres into a priuate chamber, the moſt ſlanderous will onely imagine, I eyther let you ſee the errours you are in, or that you adminiſter ſome medicine vnto me for my Feauer.

                  To Clorinda from Balzac.
               LETTER XIX.
               I Know not whether I ſhould tearme it ſlacknes, or patience, the ſmall reſiſtance I make againſt the diſpleaſures you doe me; it may be, you are reſolued to ſee how farre my fidelity will extend, and to extort the vtmoſt proofesthereof: yet is it better Clorinda to endure iniuſtice, then to act it, and to be rather the Martyr, then the Tyrant. Shew your wit, I beſeech you, by

inflicting daily new torments vpon me, and auoyde all occaſions of obliging me, with as much care as I ſeeke thoſe to ſerue you. J haue prepared my ſpirits againſt all the bad occurrents can happen that way. There is nothing I cannot endure, if it comes from you, your ſlighting me onely excepted: But herein I muſt tell you, I am ſo tender, as I am wounded with the leaſt touch. I would not purchaſe the Kings fauour, if he affoord it mee in rough tearmes; nor would I accept of his Graces, were J forced to gaine them with the forgoing the thing I affect more then his Kingdome. You vnderſtand me ſuficiently what I meane hereby, and the iuſt occaſion I haue to complaine; but ſtill you will haue me in the wrong, nor doe I doubt, but you will accuſe mee of your crime: But ſpeake truely, haue you no apprehenſion, that he whom you haue ſo often iniured, ſhall at length grow weary of his ſufferings, and leſt he ſhould loſe all feare, together with his

hopes. You might conſider Clorinda, that I am not poſſeſſed with ſlight paſſions, and how your ſelfe hath told mee ere now; that if God ſhould arme mee with thunder when I am angry, within foure and twenty houres there would be neither Towers nor Pauillions ſtanding in any place: Wherefore to ſecond your conceite; know (if that were) one while the fire ſhould fall vpon all iealous perſons, and by and by burne all the Mothers and little Brothers in a whole Prouince. And dou btleſſe, if I did you no harme, yet would I put you into ſuch a fright, you ſhould be forced to hide your ſelfe vnder ground, and come to meete me in ſome Cane. But I gaine much by theſe glorious brags, or by my ſeeming feuerity: I aſſure my ſelfe, you mocke me and my threats. It is long ſince I haue ſhewed you the way how to catch mee, and you know the meanes how to reduce mee to my former duty: I muſt confeſſe I am not of ſufficient force to

conteſt with Clorinda: her kiſſes haue power to expell all ſpleene, euen out of the ſpirit of an Italian Prince, for the greateſt iniury can be offered him. Nay, they would force the Duke de Mayne to forſake his Armes in the hotteſt of his Martiall conflicts: Wherefore I pray you, let vs agree vpon a buſineſſe, which of neceſſity muſt be concluded: how diſaduantagious ſoeuer the peace be, I treate of with you, yet ſhall I at all times gaine that which otherwiſe I ſhould loſe in your abſence. I haue therefore preſented my complaints, with purpoſe to receiue ſatisfactions: I am angry onely to the end you may appeaſe mee. I will tell you to morrow, that I am come to oblige you, to take the paines to receiue me.

                  To Clorinda from Balzac.
               LETTER XX.
               I See well Clorinda, I doe but loſe my labour, and that it were an eaſier matter to turne yce into coales, then to kindle loue in you: All I can ſay, makes no impreſſion in your thoughts, you will not ſo much as heare reaſon, becauſe it reſteth on my ſide. Well Clorinda, I muſt reſolue my ſelfe for the worſt of euents, and ſtay the time till your wrinkles affoord mee reuenge for all the wrongs you haue done me. Thinke not this tyrannicall power of your beauty, will laſt to the worlds end. Time which ouerturneth Empires, and preſcribeth limits to all things, will vſe you as it doth the reſt of faire workemanſhips. I pray haue patience, if I take vpon mee to tell you this bad newes; for I am not to

day in the humour to flatter any. Though it would raiſe choler in you, yet muſt I ſay, you will grow ſtale, and be then no more what you now are. I doubt not of your ſighes when you reflect vpon this change, or that your very imagination is not ſenſible of ſome ſorrow; yet ſhall this happen Clorinda, there is not an houre paſſeth, which impaires not ſome part of your face. But the time will come, when your Looking▪glaſſe will more ſcare you, then a Iudge doth a Fellon: your fore▪head will flye to the crowne of your head; your cheekes will fall beneath your chinne, and your eyes of thoſe dayes, ſhall turne of the ſame colour your lips are at this houre. I could willingly wiſh out of my loue vnto you, my relation were not ſo true as it is. But ſince I haue quitted all complacency, there is no meanes to make mee ſilent. Glorinda, the Sunne is ſtill beautifull, though ready to ſet; and the Autumne agreeable, though ſprinkled with ſome

Snow, but wee enioy no happy yeares, but the firſt of youth: And be as carefull of your ſelfe as is poſſible, yet can you not conſerue your complexion, and acquire experience. Will you haue mee ſay more, and acquaint you with what I vnderſtood by a ſtranger, with whom I haue conuerſed all this day? You are to know there is not any part of the world ſo remote, whither his curioſity hath not carried him, nor rarity in Nature, hee hath not carefully obſerued: Hee hath ſeene Mountaines which burne perpetually without diminiſhing▪ hee hath landed in Ilands, neuer reſting in one place; he hath ſeene naturall Sea-men; but hee ſwore vnto me, how among all theſe miracles, he neuer yet ſaw a beautifull old woman. The Morall hereof is, that you muſt make vſe of your youth, and gather Noſe-gayes before the Roſes wither. None knowes better then your ſelfe, that to be faire, is to reigne without hauing neede either of Guards or Forts. You

ſee you are the worlds ambition, no man deſiring further hapineſſe then Clorinda: but thinke not to continue this abſolute authority, or this generall eſteeme, by other meanes then you compaſſed them; and aſſure your ſelfe, that when you haue no further attractions then an eloquent tongue, no man will ſeeke for them among the furrowes of your face. A woman had neede be perfectly prouided of vertue, to repaire the ruines of her beauty. All the wit and experience in the world is fruitleſſe, when ſhee falls into this ſtate, nor can any thing hinder her from being hated, but onely to change Sexe. Remember then Clorinda, not to expect to liue, when you are as good as dead; nor doe not ſpend that time in deliberating, which ſhould be imployed in doing. You are now of yeares both to giue, and receiue contentment, and we are in the Moneth, wherein each creature turneth amorous; not excepting Lyons, Tygers, or Philoſophers. I intreate

you therefore, not to ſhew your ſelfe the ſole inſenſible creature in the world: ſuffer your ſelfe to be convinced by reaſon, ſince you cannot reſiſt the ſame but to your owne diſaduantage: You haue no ſubiect to be ſuſpicious of what I ſay; for I aduiſe you to nothing Clorinda, wherein I would not willingly ioyne with you in the accompliſhment.

               LETTER XXI.
               
                  CLorinda, your Religion muſt needes be amiſſe, otherwiſe I ſhould ſee you now and then at Church: But J thinke it were an eaſier matter to conuert a whole Nation, then to diſpoſe you to giue me content. The cauſe why you perſiſt in your owne opinion, is, becauſe

it is oppoſite to mine. Well then, I muſt depart without ſpeaking with you, and am barred from affoording to my affection, what good manners would haue exacted ofme, though I had not loued you: Truely I know not in what manner to ſuffer ſo wounding a diſpleaſure, nor am I ſo well acquainted with my ſelfe, as to paſſe my word for him I ſpeake of in this occaſion▪ All I can ſay vnto you Clorinda, is, that the onely way to rid me out of my paine, is to performe the thing I haue ſo often propoſed vnto you, and to make your ſelfe capable of a ſtrong reſolution. Neuer did any Prince enterpriſe a more glorious voyage, then mine ſhall bee, if you will make one: and truely, I ſee not why you ſhould make any difficulty herein, the longer youriourney is, the further ſhall you be remooued from tyranny▪ It is a Monſter you ought to flye from, euen to the worlds end, and with whom to be in peace, is dangerous: Will you feare to come into the Countrey of Comedies,

Painting, and Muſicke; or into a place where women are by many as highly eſteemed as Saints? with out flattering you, I muſt affirme, you ſhall ſeeme ouer-much to neglect your owne quiet, if you let ſlip ſo fauourable an occaſion to procure it. It is time Clorinda, you make it appeare what you are, and that we begin the Hiſtory of our aduentures. If you loue, all things will be eaſie for you; there is no more difficulty to paſſe the Alpes, then to goe vp into your Chamber: Nor doubt you that the Sea-waters will become ſweet, if you be not ſatisfied in that they bee ſmooth. But I am much affraide I ſhall not receiue from you the ſatisfaction I expect. You will tell me (as you vſe) wee muſt let Nature worke, and that ſhe will ſoone reuenge vs of our enemies▪ 
                  I ſuppoſe Clorinda, all this may happen, but it is no reaſon we ſhould be obliged to the Tyrants death for our liberty, but to our owne reſolutions.

               To Lydia from Mounſieur Balzac.
               
               LETTER XXII.
               I Am almoſt madde to vnderſtand thou wert ſeene laugh to day. Is this true loue Lydia to be merry in my abſence? and to be the ſame woman thou art, when I am with thee? Yet ſhould I haue bin ſatisfied, hadſt thou beene contented only to haue made thy ſelfe merry with thy lookingglaſſe, ſo the man in yron had not been in my place. I neuer ſaw him but once, and ſurely he is eyther a Sot, or elſe all the rules of Phyhognomy are falſe: yet becauſe he cals himſelfe Captaine, thou permits him to perſecute thee with his Complements, and art at the point to yeild. If he touch thee Lydia, all the water in the Sea is little enough to purifie thee; and if thou alloweſt him the reſt, haue a care, leaſt in his ſleep, he take thee for an Enemy, and inſtead of his imbraces, ſtrangle thee.
            
            
               
               To the Baron of Amblouile from BALZAC.
               LETTER XXIII,
               
                  My LORD.
               
               I Attend you here in the ſeaſon of Jaſmins and Roſes, and do ſend you a taſte of the pleaſures of Rome, for feare you be poiſoned therewith, vppon your firſt approach. We are here in the Country of curioſities, and to be happy in this place, it ſufficeth not to be blind. The Sunne hath yet heat enough to ripen vs Reaſins, and to afford vs Flowers: all the Winter fals vppon the neighbouring Mountaines, to the end we may not want Snow in Auguſt. But if you deſire I ſhould diuert my Diſcourſe vnto more ſerious matters, &amp; conceale nothing from you: I muſt tell you, there is no place vnder Heauen, where Vertue is ſo neare a Neighbour to Vice, or where Good is ſo mingled with Euill: We here behold miracles on the on ſide, and monſters on the other; and at the ſame time

when ſome Diſcipline themſelues, others run to debauches of all kinds. Beſides, there is as profound a peace here, as in that part of the Ayre eleuated aboue the Windes and Stormes. Idleneſse in this place, is an honeſt mans ordinary Vocation; and to ſaue halfe the World, no man will riſe haſtily from Table, for feare of troubling digeſtion. If you chance to ſee any with skars in their faces, do not thereupon imagine they haue purchaſed them eyther in Warres, or in defence of their honour, for theſe are only their Miſtreſſes fauours; but in recompence of ſuch refractory humors, you ſhall ſee that here, the ſanctity whereof doth illuſtrate the whole Church. It is their feruent prayers which impetrate all aduantages ouer Enemies: It is their faſtings which cauſe fruitefulneſſe to flow vppon the Earth: It is their innocency which conſerueth the culpable from Eternall ruine. In a word, there are here ſuch excellent examples of Vertue, and ſo intiſing allurements to Vice, that I will not maruaile if you turn

honeſt man here, and I will likewiſe willingly pardon you, if you do not ſo. Truly, as new Spaine is the Prouince of gold; and as Affricke affords Lyons, and France ſouldiers; ſo is Italy the mother of thoſe things you beſt loue. When you ſhall ſee theſe Female Creatures in their owne Country, and compare their beauty with the bad faſhion of the maſculine Italians, I doubt not, but it will ſeeme to you, aſwel as to my ſelfe, theſe diuine Women to haue beene created by themſelues, or to be Queenes who haue married their Groomes. The moſt part of thoſe beyond the Mounts, haue no more beauty then needs muſt, to excuſe them from being eſteemed vgly; and if there be ſome one whoſe face you could fancy, this ſhall happily be ſome deſolate Palace, or ſome well fauoured beaſt. But here (for the moſt part) they are borne Eloquent; and I will tell you before hand, that in one and the ſame perſon, you ſhal find both your Maſter and Miſtreſse. For my part, I ingeniouſly confeſſe, I do no

longer liue vnder Clorinda's regency, and all that is permitted mee in this place, is onely ſometimes to honour her memory. I expect you ſhould at this paſſage accuſe me of leuity and diſloyalty, and that you could willingly reuile mee. But doe you not thinke my ſighes muſt needes be ſurbated, in going euery day foure hundred leagues? Beſides, being ſo farre from her as I am, what know I, whether I loue a dead body, or an Infidell. I haue not receiued any fauours from her, which are not rather markes of her vertues, then demonſtrations of her loue. And had ſhe loſt all her liberality in that kinde, ſhee could hardly miſſe it. I am therefore onely obliged to my word, not to her affection. And as for that, I ſhould ouer-eſteeme her, if I made more reckoning thereof, then ſome Princes doe of theirs, and I ſhould ſhew my ſelfe ouer ſuperſtitious, if I valued what I onely whiſpered in her care, to be of greater efficacy then Letters Pattents and Edicts. It is a point decided in Onids Theology,

that an hundred falſe Oathes from an amorous perſon, amount not to halfe a deadly ſinne, and that it is onely the God of Poets whom wee offend by our periury in that point. Now I will bee iudged by her ſelfe, whether J hauing beſtowed my ſeruice vpon her, ſhe ſhould take it ill if another did reward me; or that I loue rather to bee happy, then otherwiſe; or deſire rather to poſſeſſe Lucretia, then to deſire Clorinda. Will ſhe haue her tyranny extend euen to the Churches patrimony, and that the Pope ſhare his temporall authority with her? J doe not beleeue ſhe hath any ſuch pretentions. For my part, I would ſhee knew I can no longer behold any beauty but naked, nor receiue any but warme &amp; moiſt kiſſes. I will tell you the reſt vpon the bankes of Tyber, and in theſe precious ruines whither I goe to muſe once a day, and to treade in their ſteps who haue led Kings in triumph. If there were any meanes there to finde a little of Sylla's
                  
good fortune, or of Pompeis greatneſſe, inſtead of the Medals we now &amp; then meet with, I ſhould haue a farther ſubiect to inuite you hither. Notwithſtanding, if you be yet your ſelfe, and that by ſolemne vow you haue forſaken the world, and the vanities thereof, aſſure your ſelfe, that it is in this Countrey where felicity doth attend you: and that being once in this place, you will eſteeme all thoſe as baniſhed perſons, whom you haue left behinde you in France.

                  My Lord,
               
               I Send you the papers you haue formerly ſeene, and whereto you haue attributed

ſo much, as I ſhould bee aſhamed to aſſent thereto, were it not that I hold it leſſe preſumption to beleeue I haue merited the ſame, then to imagine I can haue a flatterer of your faſhion. I had neede be eleuated to a more ſoueraigne fortune then the ſtate of Kings, to expect complacency from a man, who could neuer be procured to approue euill: and of whoſe disfauour one can hardly finde other cauſe, then the onely truth he hath declared. Howſoeuer it be, ſince you are now in Lymoſin, and take not any iourney in thoſe parts, without hauing a thouſand old debates to reconcile, and as many new ones to preuent, it is very probable, that after ſo painefull an imployment, and ſo great diſquiet of mind, my booke will fall into your hands, iuſt at ſuch time as you cannot find any thing more tedious vnto you, then what you come from treating of: For ſhould I preſume that in your pleaſant walkes of Duretal, where all your minutes are pleaſing,

and all your houres precious, there could be any time ſpare for me, and my works; it were as much as to be ignorant of the diuerſions there attending you; or not to be acquainted with the great affluence of noble company, dayly repairing thither, to viſite you. But were it ſo, that you had none with you, ſaue onely the memory of your fore-paſſed actions, your ſolitarineſſe hath no neede of bookes to make it more pleaſing; nay, if all this were not, yet if you deſire to ſeeke contentment out of your ſelfe, you cannot finde any more pleaſing, then in the preſence of your Children, and particularly of that diuine Daughter of yours, from whom I dayly learne ſome miracle. It is therefore in her abſence, and in ſolitary walkes, where I haue the ambition to finde entertainement, and to receiue gracious acceptance. In all other places (without preſuming either to paſſe for Oratour or Poet:) it ſhall highly ſuffice me in being honoured with the aſſurance that I am
               
                  My Lord,

                   Your moſt humble Seruant, BALZAC.

               A Letter from the Count of Schomberg, to Mounſieur de Balzac.
               
               LETTER XXV.
               
                  SIR,
               
               THe ſtile you trauaile in, cauſeth the Pennes of all ſuch who attempt an anſwere, to fall out of their hands, and Eloquence may ſo properly be called yours, that it is no maruell though others haue but a ſmall ſhare therein. I would therefore haue you know, that if I vnderſtand any thing in Letters, yours doe obſcure whatſoeuer hath hitherto bin eſteemed of in our Language: and that (without flattering you) there can be no diuerſion ſo pleaſing, which ought not to giue place to the peruſing of thoſe Lines you ſent mee. This occupation is worthy the Cabinets of Kings, and of the richeſt Eare curtins of France; and not (as you would haue it) of my

ſolitary retirements in Lymoſin, from whence I am ready to be gone, with reſolution neuer to retire from the affection I haue promiſed you, whence you ſhall at all times draw effectuall proofes, whenſoeuer you pleaſe to imploy them for your ſeruice.
               
                  Sir,

                   Your moſt affectionate ſeruant, SCHOMBERG. 
                  
                     The 1. of Iune, 1624.
                  
               
            
         
         
            
            THE LETTERS OF MOVNSIEVR DE BALZAC.
            
            To my Lord Maſhall of Schomberg.
            
            THE FOVRTH BOOKE.
            
               LETTER I.
               
                  My LORD:
               
               
                  I Should be inſenſible of Publique good, and an enemy to France, had I not (as I ought) a true taſte of the good newes your Foot-man brought me. I will not

mention the obligations I owe you, being no ſmall ones, if that be not a ſlight matter to be eſteemed by you: But ſince I make profeſſion to honour vertue euen in the perſon of one departed, or an enemy; and at all times to ſide with the right, were there onely my ſelfe and Iuſtice for it, you may pleaſe to beleeue, I complaine in your behalfe for the miſeries of our times, and that I am moſt ioyfull to ſee you at this preſent, where all the world miſt you: Certainely your retirement from Court, hath beene one of the faireſt peeces of your life, during which, you haue made it apparent you are the ſame in both fortunes: ſince I can witneſſe, that no one word then paſſed from you vnſutable to your reſolution. Yet this rare vertue being there hidden, in one of the remote corners of the world, hauing but a very ſmall circuite to dilate it ſelfe, muſt neceſſarily be contented with the ſatisfaction of your conſcience and ſlender teſtimonies: In the meane time the authority of your enemies hath beene obnoxious

to all honeſt eyes. There was no meanes to conceale from ſtrangers the States infirmities, or what reaſon to affoord them for the diſgrace of ſo irreproachable a Miniſter; nor was there any who grieued not, that by your abſence the King loſt ſo many houres &amp; ſeruices. For my part, (my Lord) reflecting vpon you in that eſtate, it ſeemed to me I ſaw Phidias, or ſome other of thoſe ancient Artiſts, their hands bound, and their coſtly materials, as Marble, Gold, or luory, taken from them. But now that better time ſucceede, each thing being againe reduced to its place, it is time to reioyce with all good French-men, that you ſhall no more want matter, and that the King hath at length found how vnuſefull your abſence hath beene to his affaires: Truely, be it that he content himſelfeto gouerne his people wiſely, or that the afflictions of his poore neighbours ſet neare his heart, and that his Iuſtice extend further then his Iuriſdiction: No man doubts whatſoeuer he doth, but you ſhall be one

of the principall inſtruments of his deſignes, and that as well 
                     ▪Peace, as Warre haue equall vſe of your Conduct. All men haue wel perceiued, you haue not contributed any thing to the adminiſtration of the Kings treaſure, ſaue onely your pure ſpirit, to wit, that part of the ſoule ſeparated from the terreſtriall part, being free from paſſions, which reaſoneth without either louing or deſiring; and that you haue managed the Riches of the State with as great fidelity, as one ought to gouerne another mans goods, with as much care as you conſerue your owne, and with as great ſcruple as wee ought to touch ſacred things. But in truth it is no great glory for that man to haue beene faithfull to his Maſter, who knowes not how to deceiue any: And did I beleeue you were onely able to abſtaine from ill, I would barely commend in you the Commencements of Vertue. I therefore paſſe further▪ and am aſſured, that neither the feare of death, which you haue ſlighted in all ſhapes, and vnder the moſt

dreadfull aſpects it could poſſibly appeare, nor complacency which often ouer paſſeth the beſt Counſels, to tranſport it ſelfe to the moſt pleaſing ones; nor any priuate intereſt which makes vs rather regard our ſelues, then the Publique; ſhall at all hinder you either from purpoſing, vndertaking, or executing eminent matters, Poſterity which will peraduenture iudge of our age vpon the report I ſhall make, will ſee more elſewhere then I can here relate, and I ſhall reſt ſufficiently ſatisfied, if you pleaſe to doe mee the honour, as to remember that mine affection is no Child of your proſperity, and how in two contrary ſeaſons I haue beene equally
               
                  My Lord,
                   Your moſt humble and moſt faithfull ſeruant, BALZAC.
               
            
            
               
               To the Biſhop of Angouleſme.
               
               LETTER II.
               
                  SIR,
               
               I Will no longer complaine of my pouerty, ſince you haue ſent me treaſures of Roſes, Ambergreece, and Suger; it being of ſuch pleaſing commodities, I pretend to bee rich, leauing neceſſary wealth to the Vulgar. Two Elements haue ioyntly contributed the beſt they haue, to furniſh matter for your Liberality; and ſmally valuing either Cold, or Pearles as I doe, I could wiſh for nothing either from Sea, or Land, I finde not among your preſents. You haue beſtowed with a full hand what is offered vpon Altars, but ſparingly, which men reckon by graines, and whereof none (the King of Tunnis excepted) is ſo prodigall as your ſelfe. In a Word, this profuſion of forraine odours you haue caſt into your Comfitures, obligeth me to ſpeake as I doe, and to tell you

if you feed all your flockeat this rate, there will not be any one in all your Dioceſſe, who will not coſt you more by the day, then the Elephant doth his Maſter. I ſee therefore Sir, I am the deareſt Childe you haue vnder your Conduct, nor ſhould J receiue ſo delicate and precious nouriſhment from you, did not your affection force you to beleeue, my life to be more worth then ordinary, and conſequently, that it deſerueth morecarefully to be preſerued then any other. But to returne you Complements for ſuch excellent things, were as much as to vnder-value their worth, ſhould J ſtriue to acquit my ſelfe that way; our Language is too poore and vnable to lend mee wherewith to pay you: And ſince in Homers iudgement the words of the moſt Eloquent among the Grecians, were eſteemed little better then Honey, (the foode of Shepheards) there is ſmall probability mine ſhould be comparable to Amber-greece and Suger, the delicacies of Princes. I therefore feare J ſhall

beforced to be all my life time indebted vnto you, for the fauours I haue receiued from you, and that it muſt bee onely in my heart, where I can bee as liberall as your ſelfe. But I well know, you are ſo generous, as to content your ſelfe with this ſecret acknowledgement, and that in me you affect my naked good-meaning, which muſt ſupply the place of thoſe other more fine, and ſubtile vertues I cannot learne at Court. Truely, as I expect no commendations, being the ſecond perfumes you preſent mee, in that I hold myſelfe vnworthy thereof: ſo doe I ſuppoſe you cannot refuſe mee your affection, ſince it is a kind of deſeruing it, to be paſſionately as I am
               
                  Sir, 

                  Your moſt humble and moſt faithfull ſeruant, BALZAC. 
                  
                     The 25. of December, 1626.
                  
               
            
            
               
               To Father Garraſſo.
               
               LETTER III.
               
                  Father,
               
               YOu haue found the place whereat I confeſſe I am the moſt eaſily ſurpriſed, and to oblige mee to yeelde, your Courteſie hath left nothing for your courage to performe: ſince therefore you imploy all your Muſes to require my Friendſhip, and haue already payed of your owne; I can no longer keepe it to myſelfe, but as another mans goods. But if this were not ſo, my reſentments are not of ſuch value with mee, as not often to beſtow them vpon more ſlender conſiderations then thoſe were which produced them; nor doe my paſſions ſo tranſport me, but that I will at all times remaine in the power of Religion and Philoſophy. Hitherto I can defend a iuſt cauſe, but in farther reſiſting what you deſire, I ſhould force right it ſelfe to be in the wrong, were it on

my ſide: And out of bare enmity which in ſome Common-wealthes hath beene tollerated, I ſhould euen paſſe to Tyranny, a thing odious to all men. Since our liues are momentary, it is no reaſon our paſſions ſhould be immortall, or that men ſhould glut themſelues with reuenge, whereof God hath as well forbidden the vſe, as the exceſſe. It is a thing he hath ſoly reſerued to himſelfe; and ſince none but hee, truely knoweth how to vſe this part of Iuſtice, he would no more put it into the hands of men, then hee doth Thunder and Tempeſts. Let vs therefore ſtop in our firſt motions, for it is already too much to haue begun. Let vs not tearme the hardneſſe of our hearts, Courage: and if you haue preuented me in the ouerture of the peace wee treate of, repent not your ſelfe, ſince you haue thereby bereaued me of all the honour there had beene in acquiring it. Heretofore Magnanimity and Humility might haue beene eſteemed two contrary

things, but ſince the maximes of Morality haue bin changed by the principles of Diuinity, and that Pagan vices are become Chriſtian vertues, there are euen weake actions a man of courage ought to practiſe; nor is true glory any longer due to thoſe who haue triūphed ouer innocents, but to thoſe Martyrs they haue made, and to ſuch perſons whom they haue oppreſſed. But to paſſe from generall conſiderations, to what is particular betweene you and me, it is no way likely, a religious man would diſturbe the tranquility of his thoughts, or quit his conuerſation with God and Angels, to intermeddle with wicked Mortals, and to make himſelfe a party in our diſorders. I ſhould likewiſe haue leſſe reaſon to ſeeke for an enemy out of the World, wherein there are ſo many aduerſaries to diſlike, and ſo many Rebels to ſubdue. Now (Father) whatſoeuer opinion you haue had, and notwithſtanding any thing I haue ſaid in the beginning of this Letter. I neuer

intended to commence any reall Warre againſt you: I haue not at all felt the emotion I ſhewed; all my choller being but artificiall, when at any time certaine of my ſpeeches ſeemed diſaduantagious vnto you; ſo as I freely conſent, that what was written to Hydaſpe, ſhall paſſe as a flaſh of my braine, and not as any teſtimony of my beleefe, onely to let men know, I had a deſire to ſhew how able J was to conteſt with truth, if I had no minde to ſide with it. This ſcience hauing beene ſufficiently daring to vndertake to perſwade, that a Quartan Ague was better then Health: Rhetoricke I ſay, which hath inuented praiſes for Buſiris, made Apologies for Nero, and obliged all the people of Rome to doubt whether Iuſtice were a good, or bad thing, may yet in theſe dayes exerciſe it ſelfe vpon ſubiects wholy ſeparated from common opinions, and by gracefull fictions, rather excite admiration in mens ſpirits, then exact any credence. It rayſeth Fantomes

with purpoſe to deface them. It hath paintings and diſguiſements, to alter the purity of all worldly things: It changeth ſides without leuity, it accuſeth innocency without calumny: And to ſay truth, Painters and Stage▪players are no way culpable of thoſe murthers wee ſee repreſented in Pictures, or preſented vpon Theaters; ſince therein the moſt cruel is the moſt iuſt. None can iuſtly accuſe thoſe of falſity, who make certaine glaſſes which ſhew one thing for another: Errour in ſome caſes being more gracefull then truth. In a word, the life euen of the greateſt Sages, is not altogether ſerious, all their ſayings are not Sermons, nor is all they write, eyther their laſt Teſtament, or the confeſſion of their Faith. What can I ſay more? Can you imagine me to be ſo curious, as to condemne the guſt of all that great multitude, who flocke to heare you euery morning? Are you perſwaded that I and the people can neuer be of one minde?

That I will oppoſe my ſelfe to the beleefe of honeſt men? to the approbation of Doctors? and to their authority who are eminent aboue others? No Father; I allow no ſuch liberty to my ſpirit: aſſure your ſelfe, I eſteeme you as I ought. I commend your zeale and learning, yea, were it truer then euer it was, that to compoſe tedious Volumnes, is no leſſe then to commit great ſinnes: Yet if you oblige me to iudge of yours by that you ſent vnto me, I ſay it is very excellent in its kind, and that I will no way hinder you from obtayning a Ranke among the Fathers of theſe moderne ages. But my teſtimony will not (I hope) become the onely fruite of your labours; I wiſh with all my heart the conuerſion of Turkes and Infidels may crowne your indeauours. I am perſwaded, all the honour this world can affoord, ought to be eſteemed as nothing by thoſe who only ſeeke for the aduancement of Gods glory. I will therefore no farther dilate my ſelfe vpon this

Subiect, nor wrong holy things by profaine praiſes; my intention is onely to let you know, J aſſume not ſo poore a part in the Churches intereſt, as not to bee extraordinarily well pleaſed with thoſe who are ſeruiceable thereto, and that I am right glad beſides the propenſion I haue to eſteeme your amity, ſo powerfull a perſwaſion as Religion is, doth yet further oblige me.
               
                  Yours, BALZAC.
               
            
            
               To the Cardinall of Vallete.
               
               LETTER IIII.
               
                  My LORD:
               
               THe Letter you pleaſed to ſend mee from Rome, cauſed me to forget I was ſicke, and I preſumed to ſolace my ſelfe after three yeares of ſadneſſe, euer ſince newes was brought mee of Lucidors death, and the ſucceſſe of that fatall combate, wherein you could not but bee a

loſer, on which ſide ſoeuer the aduantage happened. My Lord, I doubt not but your ſpirit though altogether ſtoute and couragious, to ſupport your proper misfortunes, is yet mollified by the relation of their miſeries who loue you, and where there is queſtion rather of ſhewing your good nature, or your conſtancy, you will quit one vertue to acquire another. I know well, that in the number of your goods, you reckon your friends in the firſt ranke, allowing onely the ſecond place to your dignities, and to fifty thouſand Crownes rent which accompanies them; and conſequently I aſſure my ſelfe, you beleeue you are, as it were, growne poore by the loſſe of a man who had relation vnto you. But I am likewiſe moſt certaine, how after the paſſing certaine vnpleaſant dayes out of the loue you bare him; and hauing affoorded him ſufficient teſtimonies of your true affection, he now expecting no further acknowledgement or ſeruice, you will at length call

to minde, that it is the Publique to whom you owe your cares and paſſions, and that you are not permitted farther to afflict a ſpirit which is no longer yours. Since the miſery of this age is ſo generall, as it leaueth no one houſe without teares, nor any one part of Europe without trouble; and ſince Fortune is not of power to conſerue euen her owne workemanſhips, who are many of them fallen to ground: it muſt needes ſo happen (my Lord) that being of the world, you are to taſte of the fruites it produceth, and that you purchaſe at ſome hard rate, the good ſucceſſes dayly attending you. But truely, the place where you are, and the great deſignes taking you vp, may well furniſh you with ſo ſtrong and ſolide conſolations, as they neede leaue no worke for others; and my Eloquence would come too late, ſhould I imploy it after your reaſon, which hath formerly perſwaded you, there being now neither precept nor Counſell in all humane wiſedome

vnpropoſed to your view; and ſince neither Seneca, nor Epictetus can ſay any thing ſaue onely your thoughts▪ 
                  I had much rather ſend you diuertiſements no way diſtaſtefull, then to preſent you any remedies which doubtleſſe will proue importunate. Theſe writings (my Lord) here incloſed, ſhall not enter as ſtrangers into your Cabinet, they will not talke vnto you of the fiue Pradicables of Perphirie, nor of Iuſtinians Neuelles, or the numbers of Algebra▪
                   But you may there recreate and repoſe your ſpirits at your returne from Audiences, Congregations, and the Conſiſtory. I could well haue beſtowed vppon them a more eminent title, then what they haue. I could out of theſe compoſures haue framed Apologies, Accuſations, and politique diſcourſes; yea, had I pleaſed neuer ſo little to haue extended ſome of my Letters, they might haue beene called bookes. But beſides, my deſigne, aiming rather to pleaſe, then importune, and that I tend to the highth of conceptions

and not at the abundance of words: When I treate with you, (my Lord) I ſuppoſe my ſelfe to be before a full aſſembly; and doe propoſe to my ſelfe neuer to write any thing vnto you, which Poſterity ought not to read. Now if ſometimes from your perſon I paſſe to others, or if I commend thoſe whom I conceiue are deſeruing, I aſſure my ſelfe, I therein performing an act of Iuſtice, and not ofſubiection: you will be no way diſpleaſed with what I doe, and well hope, I may conſerue your fauours without violating humane Lawes, or ſeparating my ſelfe from ciuill ſociety.
               
                  Your moſt humble ſeruant, BALZAC. 
                  
                     The 15. of Iuly, 1629.
                  
               
            
            
               To the Cardinall of Vallete:
               
               LETTER V.
               
                  My Lord,
               
               THough innocency be the Felicity of the afflicted, and that I finde in my ſelfe

the ſatisfaction, he can expect who hath not offended, yet can I not ſo eaſily comfort my ſelfe: And the remedien my Phyloſophy affoord me, are for meaner misfortunes then the loſſe of your fauours. All I can contribute to my conſolation out of the aſſurance I haue of mine innocency, is the liberty I haue taken to tell you ſo, and to complaine of the iniuſtice you haue done me, if you haue ſo much as ſuffered any to accuſe me I neede not ſeeke colours to palliate my actions or words: it is ſufficiently knowne, their principall obiects haue euer bin the glory of your name, and the deſire to pleaſe you: I befeech you likewiſe to call to remembrance, that hard times haue not hindred me from imbarking my ſelfe where my inclination called me; and that I haue ſerued my Lord your Father, when moſt of his followers were in danger to become his Martyrs. It ſhould ſeeme perchance▪ 
                  I ſtand in neede of the memory of what is paſt, and that I make my precedent good offices appeare, to the end to cauſe

them to ouer way my preſent offences. No (my Lord) I intend not to make vſe of what now is not, for the iuſtification of mine actions, nor am I ignorant that neuer any woman was ſo vicious, who hath not heretofore bin a Virgin, nor criminal, who cannot preſcribe ſome time preceding his bad life. I ſpeake of to day, as well as of heretofore, and doe proteſt vnto you, with all the Oathes able to make truth appeare holy, and inuiolable; that I neuer had one ſingle temptation againſt my duty, and that my fidelity is ſpottleſſe, as (if you ſo pleaſed) it might be without ſuſpicion: I muſt confeſſe that you hauing declared your ſelfe no way deſirous to trench vpon my liberty, and that you left it wholy to my ſelfe, I haue ſometimes made vſe thereof, imagining that without wronging that firſt reſolution, I vowed to your ſeruice, it might be lawfull for me to haue ſecond affections. I will not expect the racke to force me to confeſſe it; I haue loued a man whom the misfortunes of Court, and the

diuers accidents happening in worldly affaires, haue ſeparated from ſome friends of yours, and haue caſt him into other intereſts then theirs. But beſides, that he was extracted from a Father, who did not more deſire his owne good, then your contentment; and ſince I am moſt aſſured how amidſt all the fore-paſſed broiles, he at all times conſerued his inclinations for you. I muſt needs tell you, I was in ſuch ſort obliged vnto him, as had he declared Warre againſt my King, and againſt my Country, J could not haue choſen any ſide which had not bin vniuſt: J therefore at this day bewaile him with warme teares, and if euer I take comfort in the loſſe I haue ſuſtained, I ſhall eſteeme my ſelfe the moſt vnworthy, and in gratefull perſon liuing. Your ſelfe (my Lord) knowing (as you do) how much I owe vnto his amity, would ſooner adiudge me to die with him, then blame my reſentments. I aſſure my ſelfe all my actions are diſguiſed vnto you, on purpoſe to cauſe you to diſlike them▪
                  
Howſoeuer I will not diſpaire, but the time to come wil right me for what is paſt. You will on day ſee the wrong you ofter to my innocency, in admitting falſe witneſſes in prciudicethereof, and what you now tearme my fault, you will then be pleaſed to ſay; it was my vnhappy fate, or my hard fortune: in the interim, I am reſolued to continue in well doing, and though there were no other but my conſcience to acknowledge my fidelity yet inuiolably to remaine
               
                  Your moſt humble and moſt faithfull ſeruant. BALZAC.

               LETTER VI.
               
                  SIR,
               
               AS the bearer hereof can teſtifie the obligations I owe you, ſo may he beare witneſſe of my perpetuall reſentments,

and will tell you, that were I borne your ſonne, or ſubiect, you could haue but the ſame power ouer mee, you now poſſeſſe: nay, I am perſwaded, I yet owe ſomewhat more to your vertue, then to the right of Nations, or Nature. If power hath made Princes, and chance Parents, reaſon well deſerues a further kinde of Obedience: It was that which ouercome me vpon the firſt conference I had with you, cauſing me to proſtrate all my preſumption at your feete, after hauing rightly repreſented to my thoughts, how impoſſible it is to eſteeme my ſelfe, and know you: I am ſure this Language is no way pleaſing to you; and that you will looke awry at my Letter; but doe what you pleaſe, I am more a friend to truth, then to your humour, and my ſpirits are ſo repleniſhed with what I haue ſeene, and heard, as I can no longer conceale my thoughts: I muſt tell you (Sir) you are the greateſt Tyrant this day liuing; your authority becomes awfull to

all ſoules, and when you ſpeake, there is no further meanes to retaine priuate opinions, if they be not conformable to yours. I ſpeake this ſeriouſly, and with my beſt ſence; you haue often reduced me to ſuch extreamities, that comming from you, without knowing what to anſwer you, I haue beene ready to exclaime and ſay, (in the rapture wherein I was) Reſtore me my opinion which you haue violently forced from me, and take not from mee the liberty of Conſcience the King hath giuen mee. But truely, it is no ſmall pleaſure to be conſtrained to be happy, and to fall into his hands, who vſeth no violence; but to their auaile who ſuffer. For my part, I haue at all times departed your preſence, fully perſwaded in what I ought to beleeue: I neuer gaue you a viſite which cured me not of ſome paſſion: I neuer came into your Chamber ſo honeſt a man, as I went foorch: How often with one ſhort ſpeech haue you eleuated me aboue my ſelfe, and

bereaued me of whatſoeuer was fleſhly▪ and prophane in me: How often hearing you diſcourſe of the World to come, and of true felicity, haue I longed after it, and would willingly haue purchaſed it at the price of my life? How often could I haue followed you, (would you haue conducted me) to a higher pitch of perfection, then all ancient Philoſophers euer attained? So it is, that you onely haue beſtowed the loue of inuiſible things vpon me, cauſing me to diſtaſte my firſt and moſt violent affections: I ſhould ſtill haue beene buried in fleſh, had not you drawne me forth, nor had my ſpirit beene other then a part of my body, had not you taken the paines to vnlooſe it from ſenſuall obiects, and to ſeuer the eternall from the periſhable part. You cauſed mee at the firſt encounter to become ſuſpicious to the wicked, and to fauour the better ſide, before I was of it; you haue made thoſe remedies pleaſing, which all others affrighted me with, and in the midſt of vice, you haue conſtrained me to confeſſe Vertue to be the moſt beautifull thing on Earth. Thinke

not therefore, that either the pompe of the Roman Court, or the glitter of that of France, can dazell thoſe eyes of my ſoule, where to you haue ſhewed ſo many excellent things. It is the beames and lightning of thoſe eminent Vertues you haue diſcouered vnto me, which caſt ſo forceable reflections vpon the eyes of my ſoule, and which cauſe mee, (though I formerly reſolued to ſlight all things,) yet at leaſt now to admire ſomething. But yet (Sir) aſſure your ſelfe, it is not the world I admire, for I rather reflect vpon it, as on that which hath deceiued me theſe eight and twenty yeares I haue bin in it, and wherein I fearce euer ſaw any thing, but how to doe euill, and counterfeit to be good▪ In all places on Earth, whether my curioſity hath tranſported me, beyond Seas, or on the other ſide the Alpes, in free States, or in Kingdomes of Conqueſt, I haue obſerued among men onely a fare of flatteries, fooles and Cheaters; of Oldmen corrupted by their Anceſtors, and who corrupt their Children: Of ſlaues who cannot liue out of Seruitude: of pouerty among vertuous

perſons, and Ambitious Couetouſneſſe in the ſoules of great perſons. But now that you haue broken the barres, through which I could onely receiue ſome light impreſſion of truth, I diſtinctly ſee this generall corruption, and doe humbly acknowledge the iniury I offered to my Creator, when I made Gods of his Creatures; and what glory I fought to bereaue him of, &amp;c.

               LETTER VII.
               I Know not what right vſe to make of your praiſes; if I receiue them, I loſe all my humility, and in reiecting them, I giue that as granted which I am taxed for. Vpon the edge of theſe two extreamities, it is more laudable to ſuffer my ſelfe to fall on my friends ſide, and to ioyne in opinion with honeſt men, then to leane to that

of Lyſander, ſince all men agree, that his cenſure is euer oppoſite to the right; and that he is the wiſeſt man in France, who reſembles him the leaſt. There would be ſome errour in the reputation I aime at, were I not condemned by him. Thinke it not therefore ſtrange, that iniuries are blowne vpon mee by the ſame mouth which vttereth blaſphemies againſt the memory of ρρρ, and remember this old Maxime, that fooles are more vniuſt then ſome ſinners: The beſt is, that for one Enenemy my Reputation raiſeth againſt mee, it procures me a thouſand protectors; ſo as without ſtirring hence, I get victories at Paris; nor finde I any Harmony ſo pleaſing, as what is compoſed of one particular murmure, mingled with generall acclamations. There are ſufficient in your Letter to cauſe me to retract the Maximes of my ancient Philoſophy: At the leaſt they oblige me to confeſſe, that all my felicity is not within my ſelfe, things without mee entring towards the compoſition of perfect happineſſe. I muſt freely confeſſe

vnto you mine infirmity: I ſhould grow dumbe, were I neuer ſo ſhort a time to liue among deafe perſons, and were there no glory, I ſhould haue no Eloquence. But it is time I returne to the taske I haue vndertaken; and that inſtead of ſo many excellent words you haue addreſſed vnto me, I onely anſwere you, that I am
               
                  Your moſt humble ſeruant, BALZAC.
               
            
            
               To Mounſieur Tiſſandier:
               
               LETTER VIII.
               AT my returne from Poiton, I found your packet attending me at my houſe; but thinking to peruſe your Letters, I perceiued I read my Panegyricke; I dare not tell you, with what tranſport &amp; exceſſe of ioy I was ſurpriſed thereupon, fearing to make it appeare, I were more vaine then vſually women are, and affect praiſes with the like intemperance as I doe perſumes. Without diſſembling, thoſe you ſent mee,

were ſo exquiſite, as be it you deceiue me, or I you, there neuer iſſued fairer effects, either from iniuſtice, or errour. I beſeech you to continue your fault, or to perſeuere in your diſſimulation: For my part, J am reſolute to make you full payment of what J owe you, and to yeeld ſo publicke a teſtimony of the eſteeme I hold of you, as my reputation hereafter ſhall be onely ſeruiceable to yours, oblige me ſo farre, as to accept this Letter, for aſſurance of what I will performe; and if you finde mee not ſo ſeruiceable as I ought to be, blame thoſe troubleſome perſons who are alwayes at my throate, forcing me to tell you ſooner then I reſolued, that I am
               
                  Your moſt humble and faithfull ſeruant, BALZAC

               To Mounſieur de Faret.
               
               LETTER IX.
               THere is not any acknowledgement anſwerable to my obligations vnto you: If I owe you any honour, I am farther indebted vnto you then my life comes to. Truely, to be ſenſible of another mans ſufferings ſooner then himſelfe, or to aſſume a greater ſhare in his intereſts, then hee doth? I muſt confeſſe, is as much as not to loue in faſhion, or not to liue in this Age. It is likewiſe a long time ſince I haue bin acquainted, that the corruption enuironing you, doth not at all infect you; and how among the wicked, you haue conſerued an integrity ſuiting the Reigne of Lewes the twelfth: Nay, happily we muſt ſearch further, and paſſe beyond the Authenticke Hiſtory. It is onely vnder the Poets Charlemaine, where a man of your humour is to be found, and that the combat of Roger hath beene the victory of Leon.
                  
Without more particularly explaining my ſelfe, you vnderſtand what I would ſay; and I had much rather be indebted to your ſupport, then to the merit of my cauſe, or to the fauourable cenſure I haue receiued from the Publicke. Certainly, truth it ſelfe cannot ſubſiſt, or finde defence without aſſiſtance; yea euen that concerning Religion; and which more particularly appertaineth to God then the other, ſeaſeth not on our ſoules, but by the entermiſe of words; and hath neede to be perſwaded to haue it beleeued. You may hereby iudge whether the good offices you affoorded me, were not vſefull vnto me, or whether or no my iuſt cauſe happened ſucceſſefully into your hands. But I muſt deferre the thankes due vnto you vpon this occaſion, till our meeting at Paris, to the end, to animate them by my perſonall expreſſion. Be confident in the interim; though pitty it ſelfe would ſtay me in my Cell, yet you are of power to cauſe mee to infringe my heremeticall vow: beſides, you haue ſet ſuch a luſter vpon that great City, and

haue punctuated vnto me ſo many remarkeable things, and nouelties thereof, in the Letter you pleaſed to ſend me, as I ſhould ſhew my ſelfe inſenſible of rarities, and not poſſeſſed with an honeſt curioſity, had I not a deſire to returne thither. I therefore onely attend ſome ſmall portion of health to ſtrengthen me, to part hence; and to goe to enioy with you our mutuall delights, I meane the conuerſation of Mounſieur de Vaugelas, who is able to make mee finde the Court in a Cottage, and Paris in the Plaines of Bordeaux: Adieu Mounſienr, loue mee alwayes, ſince I am with all my ſoule,
               
                  Your moſt humble and affectionate ſeruant, BALZAC.

               LETTER X.
               IT is now fifteene dayes ſince I receiued any newes from you, yet will I beleeue the

change of ayre hath cured you; and if you (as yet) walke with a ſtaffe, it is rather I hope for ſome marke of your authority, then for any ſupport of your infirmity: If this be ſo, I coniure you to make good vſe of this happy ſeaſon yet remaining, and not to loſe theſe faire dayes, haſtning away, and which the next Clouds will carry from vs. I giue you this aduice, as finding it good; and becauſe there is not any thing doth more fortifie feeble perſons then the Sunne of this Moneth, whoſe heate is as innocent as its light. Adamantus hath had his ſhare of the vnwholeſome influence raigning in theſe parts. The Feauer hath not borne him the reſpect due to a perſon of his quality, hauing ſo rudely intreated him, as he is ſcarce to be knowne: Yet hath he ſome kind of obligation to his ſickneſſe, in hauing acquainted him with ſuch pleaſures, as were not made for thoſe who are ouer fortunate, and which formerly he knew not. At this preſent he can neuer be weary in praiſing the benefits of Liberty, nor in admiring the beauty of Day, and the diuerſities of

Nature: ſo as to heare him ſpeake, you would ſuppoſe all things to be Nouelties vnto him; and that he is entred into another world, or new borne againe in this. Beſides, they paſſe their time merrily at N. and of two hundred calling themſelues Virgins, I verily thinke there is not one who ſpeakes truth, if ſhee haue not recouered her Maiden-head. It may be their intention is not ill, and that in ſuffering themſelues to be courted, they haue no other deſigne, then to raiſe ſeruants to God. But ſince godly intentions doe not alwayes produce good effects, if you ſuffer things to run on in the ſame courſe which they doe, I greatly apprehend in your regard, that Antichriſt will ſhortly take his beginning in your Dioceſſe; and leſt you by conſequence ſhould be the firſt obiect of his perſecution. J ſuppoſe you haue a greater intereſt then any man▪ to oppoſe this accident which now threatneth vs, and that to diuert a miſchiefe which is to be followed by the worlds ruine, you ought not to ſpare the fulminations of Rome; nor make vſe onely

of halfe your power. There are not any will be auerſe to this good Worke, ſaue only our young Gallants. But you cannot procure their diſaffections vpon a better ſubiect then this, nor doe greater ſeruice to the iealious God, then to conſerue the honour of thoſe creatures he loueth,
               
                  
                     I am Your moſt humble and moſt affectionate ſeruant, BALZAC.

               To Mounſieur Pouzet.
               
               LETTER XI.
               IF you will not returne from Court, we are reſolued to ſend Deputies on purpoſe to require you of the King, and to beſeech him to reſtore vs our good company: I know well, that in the place where you are, there are priſons both for the innocent, and moſt happy; and that no man can blame you for your ouer-long abode there, without accuſing you for being fortunate. But

it were likewiſe ſmall Juſtice, your abſence ſhould make this City a Village, and that Paris ſhould vſurpe all the affections you owe me. As I perfectly loue you, ſo doe I expect to be reciprocally reſpected by you; nor would you I ſhould herein haue any aduantage ouer you, though I yeelde vnto you in all other things: Neither of vs therefore can enioy ſolide contentments, ſo long as we are ſeparated; and I pretend you doe me wrong, if you take ſatisfaction where I am not. Take Poſte therefore with ſpeed, to be here quickely, grow not old eyther by the way, or at your Inne, for by this meanes I ſhal get the aduantage of that time, and you ſhall gaine me foure dayes out of the loſſe of three Moneths. I haue ſeene what you willed me concerning λλλ, But I would you knew, I haue no reſentments againſt forceleſſe enemies, nor haue I any minde to put my ſelfe into paſſion, when theſe petty Doctors pleaſe. Should theſe fellowes ſpeake well of me, I would inſtantly examine my conſcience, to know whether I were guilty of any fault; and as Hippolitus
                  
ſuſpected his owne innocency, becauſe hee was eſteemed ſpotleſſe in his ſtepdames eye: So ſhould not I haue any good opinion of my owne ſufficiency, were I gracious in their ſights, who can haue no other then bad affections. Howſoeuer, they cauſe me once a day to thinke my ſelfe ſome greater matter then I am, when I reflect vpon their number, and the miracle I worke, in intereſſing in one and the ſame cauſe ſuperſticious perſons, Atheiſts, and euill Monkes Adieu.

               An anſwer to a Letter ſent to Balzac, from a learned Old Lady, Madamoiſelle de Gournay.
               
               LETTER XII.
               
                  Madam,
               
               I DOe here at the firſt tell you, I haue no other opinion of you, then your ſelfe giues

me, and I haue at all times had a more ſtrong and ſound notion of the inward qualities by the ſpeech, then by the Phyſiognomy. But if after the Letter you did me the honour to write vnto me, it were neceſſary to ſeeke any forraigne proofes; the teſtimony of thoſe two great perſonages, who haue admired your vertue euen in the budde, and left the pourtraite thereof vnder their owne hands, may well ſerue as an Antidote▪ to ſecure mee from the impreſſions and the painted ſhadowes of calumny. I who know that Aſia, Affricke, and a great part of the world beſides, beleeue Fables as fundamentall points of Religion, doe not at all wonder (if in what concerneth your particular) there be ſome who ſide not with the truth, which is ſure to finde enemies in all places where there are men. This is an effect of that errour, now growne old in popular opinion; that it is fit an honeſt woman be ignorant of many things, and that, to maintaine her reputation, it is not requiſite all the world commend her; but that ſhe be vnknowne to all men. Nay, I ſay further:

The vulgar doth ordinarily caſt an iniurious eye, and with ſome taxe of extrauagancy, vpon great and Heroicall qualities, if they appeare in that ſexe, to which they conceiue it ought not to appertaine. Now though to ſpeake generally, and to reflect rightly vpon the order of earthly things, and the grounds of policy, I muſt confeſſe, I ſhould leane to the firſt of theſe opinions: Yet will I be well aduiſed, how I thinke that Nature hath not ſo much liberty left her, as to paſſe (vpon occaſion) the limits ſhee ordinarily alloweth her ſelfe; or ſometimes to exceede her bounds without blame, to the end, to produce certaine things, farre ſurpaſſing the reſt in perfection. It is no good Argument to auerre, that becauſe you are adorned with the vertues of our ſexe, you therefore haue not reſerued thoſe of your owne; or that it is a ſinne for a woman to vnderſtand the Language which heretofore the Veſtals made vſe of. I will therefore leaue theſe calumnious perſons, who deſire to bereaue Lillies of their beauty; and Chriſtall of

its cleareneſſe, to returne to the Letter I haue receiued from you; where without flattery I will affirme, thatMeaning himſelfe. this man who hath beene diſcribed vnto you, for ſo vaine glorious a perſon; who deſpiſeth times paſt, who mocketh the moderne, and preiudicateth the future; hath found out diuers things in your workes well pleaſing vnto him: ſo as if my approbation be at this preſent of any weight with you, you may for your owne aduantage, adde this Encomion to that of Lipſius and Montagnie, and boldly affirme you haue this aduantage ouer Kings and Emperours, that the taſtes of two different ages haue agreed in your fauour. Since you were firſt commended, the face of Christendome hath changed ten times: Neyther our manners, attire, or Court, are cogniſible to what you haue ſeene them. Men haue made new lawes, yea, and the vertues of our fore-fathers age, are eſteemed the vices of ours: yet ſhall it appeare, how amidſt ſo many changes and ſtrange reuolutions, you haue brought euen to ourtimes one and the ſame reputation; and that your beauty (I

ſpeake of what enamoreth the Capucins Friers, and old Philoſophers) hath not left you, with your youth. I ſhall in mine owne regard bee very glad, the world ſhould take notice how much I honour Vertue, by what name ſoeuer it paſſeth, and vnder what ſhape ſoeuer it is ſhrowded: and I eſteeme my party ſtronger by the halfe, then it hath beene, ſince you haue vouchſafed to enter thereinto. But if without offending againſt Grammaticall rules, and thoſe of Decorum: J durſt take you for my ſecond, I aſſure my ſelfe if wee were to denounce war againſt theſe petty Authours, who are ingendered by errour, and diſcloſed out of the corruption of this age, you ſhould not haue ouer many in taking halfe a dozen of them to taske for your part. At the leaſt, you would put thoſe Pedants to ſilence, who bragge they haue taught me to ſpeake. Yet will I tell you, before I proceede any further, and to the end they may know as much (if you pleaſe) that my Mother is not reſolued to giue this for granted, and

how if there be any glory to be gotten in ſo poore an exploite, ſhe is determined to diſpute the matter againſt all theſe bookemakers. I haue euer beene hitherto of opinion, that in what concerneth the choice of words, I ought to ſuffer my ſelfe to be gouerned by the common acceptation thereof, without adhering to any one mans ſingle example; and that inſtead of acknowledging the authority of any particular, I am to follow the publique conſent. But howſoeuer, it is not the praiſe of a great Orator to ſpeake our Language well, but rather the marke of a true Frenchman; Nor doe I pretend applauſe from any, for not being borne in Holland, or Germany. It is true, I attibute much to Elocution, and know that high things ſtand in neede of the helpe of words, and that after thoſe haue bin rightly conceiued, they are as happily to bee expreſſed. It onely angers me, that out of the pooreſt part of Rhetoricke receiued among the ancients, they will needes extract all ours. And that to pleaſe meane ſpirits, it is

ſitting (as they thinke) our workes ſhould reſemble thoſe ſacrifices, whereout they take the heart, and where, of all the head, nothing is left ſaue only the tongue. I would make anſwer to the other aduertiſements you did me the honour to giue me, if they had not relation to a matter I reſerue my ſelfe fully to treate of in L. being a worke I am in hand with, and which I hope ſhortly to preſent vnto you at Paris. There it ſhall be, where I will make it appeare vnto you, that reaſon cannot haue an eaſier taske, then to perſwade a ſpirit of the like making mine is, and that I equally loue the truth, whether I receiue it from any other, or that I finde it my ſelfe.

               LETTER XIII.
               THe meane compliment I am to offer you, is the firſt effect of the fuming

Drinkes I receiued from you. I haue no meanes to finde out my right ſences to entertaine you; they are loſt in your excellent liquors, and I had neede be more valiant then I am, to defend my ſelfe againſt Spaine and Normandy, with their vnited forces: I verily thinke, that what ſhould haue beene drunke at Berniere betwixt this and Eaſter, is ouerflowne in my Chamber: If my Friends come not to my aide, I am in danger to ſuffer ſhipwracke, or not to become ſober againe till next yeare: yet will you needes haue mee euen in this plight wherein I am, to act a ſober mans part; and my ſoule to execute thoſe functions you haue ſuſpended. It is impoſſible, not being my ſelfe, I ſhould ſpeake my ordinary Language; I cannot giue you two words of thankes without taking one for another; and my head is ſo full of your Spaniſh Wine, and Normandy Cider, that my wits giue place; I will therefore content my ſelfe, to aſſure you with this ſmall portion offence yet left mee, that ſuppoſing your Friendſhip

produced nothing, and were as barren, as it is fruitfull, I would ſue for it out of a more noble conſideration, then that of particular intereſt, and would teſtifie vnto you, that it is your ſelfe I loue, and not your fortunes: Beleeue, I beſeech you, the trueſt of all men: you gained my heart the firſt time I had the honour to ſee you; I then gaue my ſelfe wholy as yours, and ſaid within my ſelfe, what I haue often ſince reiterated, that you being rich enough to purchaſe a Soueraignty beyond the Alp es, if that ſhould euer happen, I eſteemed you a ſufficient worthy perſon, to deſerue to haue me liue vnder your Regency, and that I was
               
                  Your moſt humble ſeruant and ſubiect, BALZAC. 
                  At Paris

               To Mounſieur de Voiture.
               
               LETTER XIIII.
               THough the halfe of France diuide vs, yet are you as preſentto my ſpirit, as

the obiects I ſee, and you haue part in all my thoughts and dreames. Riuers, Plaines, and Townes may well oppoſe them ſelues to my content: they cannot hinder my memory from taking entertainment with you, or from the frequent taſte of thoſe excellent Diſcourſes wherewith you haue graced me, till I be ſo happy as againe to heare you. Though you ſhould grow proud, yet muſt I confeſſe▪ I conceiue not any thing either great or ſublime, ſaue onely thoſe Seedes you haue ſcattered in my Soule; and that your company, which at firſt, was right pleaſing, is now become abſolutely neceſſary for me: You may therefore well thinke it is not willingly I leaue you thus long in your Miſtreſſes hands, or that I ſuffer her to enioy my goods, without giuing me account: Euery moment ſhe obligeth you to allow her, are ſo many vſurpations ſhe makes vpon me; all you whiſper vnto her, are ſecrets you conceale from me; and to haue your conuerſation in mine abſence, is to inrich her ſelfe by my loſſes. But there is no reaſon J ſhould malice ſo

faire a Riuall, in that both of you are happy; or that I frame mine afflictions vpon your mutuall contents▪; prouided (at my comming) I find foure moneths abſence notto haueblotted me out of your remembrance, and that Loue hath there reſerued ſome place for friendſhip, I ſhall ſtill haue for mine aduantage the time paſſing to attend the houre aſſigned; and you will come to comfort me ſometimes, concerning the miſeries of this Age, and the iniuſtice of men. In the interim, in the place where now I am, as I haue but ſlender ioyes, ſo haue I not any great diſcontents: I am in equall diſtance remooued from diſ-fauour and good fortune, and that vnconſtant Goddeſſe, who is euer imploied in depopulating Cities, and ſubuerting States, hath no leaſure to worke miſchiefe in meane places. I ſee Shepheardeſſes who can only ſay, yea and nay, and who are too groſſe witted to be deceiued by vnderſtanding perſons; yet is painting as little knowne among them as Eloquence; and becauſe I am their Maiſter, they would ſuffer me to ſhew them, if I ſo pleaſed, how ſmal

a diſtance there is betweene power and tyranny: inſtead of the fine words and quaint diſcourſes wherein your Ladies abound, there iſſues from their mouthes a pure and innocent breath, which incorporates it ſelfe with their kiſſes▪ and giues them a taſte, you ordinarily finde not among thoſe of the Court. Suppoſing therefore you make not any better choice there, then I happen on hereby chance, I make ouer particular profeſſion, to relye on your iudgement, and of being▪

               LETTER XV.
               THe good opinion you haue of me, makes vp more then halfe my merit, and you herein reſemble the Poets Epicts, who out of ſmall truths frame incredible fixions; howſoeuer, if you loued me not, but according to the rigour of Law and Reaſon, I ſhould much feare to be but of indifferent eſteeme with you. It is then much better for me, the

affection you beare me, appeare rather a paſſion then a vertue. Extremities in all other things are reprooueable, in this laudable; and as certaine Riuers are neuer ſo vſefull as when they ouerflow: ſo hath Friendſhip nothing more excellent in it then exceſſe; and doth rather offend in her moderation, then in her violence. Continue therefore in obſeruing neither rule, nor meaſure, in the fauours you affoord me▪ and to the end I may be lawfully ingratefull, being infinitely obliged, leaue me not ſo much as words wherewith to thanke you. Truely your laſt Letters haue taken from me all the tearmes I ſhould imploy in this occaſion▪ and inſtead of the good offices I inceſſantly receiue from you, it ſeemes you will onely haue new importunies in payment▪ Since it is thus, feare not my niceneſſe, or that in matters of great conſequence, I make not vſe of your affection, and in ſlight ones I abuſe it not; henceforward it is requiſite, you recouer all my Law▪ſutes, compoſe all my quarrels, and correct all my errours: For to vndertake to cure all my diſeaſes, I ſuppoſe

you would not, in preiudice of Mounſieur de Lorime. It ſhall therefore ſuffice, you will be pleaſed to let him at this paſſage read how I requite my life at his hands; and if the onely obeying him, will preſerue mee, I will place his precepts immediately after Gods Commandements▪ There is no receite diſtaſtefull, if his Eloquence affoord the preparatiue, nor paine vnaſſwaged by his words, before it be expelled by his Art: Remoteſt cauſes are as viſible to him, as the moſt ordinary effects; and if Nature ſhould diſcouer herſelfe naked vnto him, he could not thereby receiue any further communication of her ſecrets, then he hath acquired by former experience. Let him therefore beſtow better nights on mee, then thoſe I haue had this ſixe yeares, wherein I haue had no ſleepe; intreate him to make a peace betweene my Liuer and Stomacke, and to compoſe this ciuill Warre, which diſturbes the whole inſide of my body, if he deſire I ſhould no longer liue, but for his glory▪ and to perſwade the world, he is nothing indebted to thoſe Arabian Princes, who practiſed

                  Phiſicke, or to the gods themſelues who inuented it. Truely if meere Humaniſts, whom diuers of his profeſſion haue ſometimes ſcorned, ſeeme of ſlight conſideration with him; or if he be not contented with a ciuill acknowledgement, I am ready to call him my preſeruer▪ and to erect Altars, and offer ſacrifice vnto him. Yea, to compaſſe this, I wil quit the better part of what I implore; I deſire not, hee ſhould cure mee▪ It is ſufficent hee hinder mee from dying, and that hee cauſe my diſeaſes and plaints to endure ſome threeſcore yeares. I would likewiſe know (if you pleaſe) what his good Cozen doth, that Citizen of all Common wealths, that man who is no more a ſtranger in Perſia, then in France, and whoſe knowledge hath the ſame extent, as hath all the Turkiſh Empire▪ and all the ancient Roman Monarchy. I haue at the leaſt three hundred queſtions to aske him, and a whole Volumne of doubts to propoſe vnto him; I expect at our firſt meeting, to reſolue with him vpon the affaires of former ages, and concerning the different opinions,

of Baronius and Genebrard on the one ſide, and of Eſcales and Caſaubon on the other. I am in the meane time reſolued to paſſe ten or twelue daies with Mounſieur de Racan, to the end to ſee him in that time worke miracles, and write things which God muſt neceſſarily reueale vnto him. Truely Conquerours haue no greater aduantage ouer Maſters of Fence, then hee hath ouer Doctors; and hee is at this day one of the great Workemanſhips of Nature. If all wits were like his, there would bee a great deale of time loſt at Schoole▪ Vniuerſities would become the moſt vnprofitable parts of the Commonwealth, and Latine as well as Millan Parchment, with other forraine Merchandizes, would be rather markes of our vanity, then any effects of our neceſſitie.

               LETTER XVI.
               VVEre my health better then it is, yet the roughneſſe of the ſeaſon wee are entring into, and which

                  J hoped to preuent, makes mee ouer apprehenſiue, to ſtirre out of my Chamber, or to hazard my ſelfe in a long voyage: A Sunleſſe day, or one night in a bad Hoſthouſe, were ſufficient to finiſh the worke of my Death; and in the ſtate wherein I am, I ſhould much ſooner arriue in the next world, then at Chaſtellerant. I muſt therefore intreate you to hold me excuſed, if J keepe not promiſe with you, or if I take ſome longer time to make prouiſion of ſtrength, to prepare my ſelfe for ſo hardy an enterprize. At our returne from Court, wee are to come to your delicate Houſe, and to ſee the places where the Muſes haue appeared vnto you, and dictated the Verſes we haue ſo much admired. Thoſe wherewith you honoured me, doe ouer-much engage me, to leaue my iudgement at liberty; I will onely content my ſelfe, to proteſt that you were neuer ſo very a Poet, as when you ſpake of me; and that you haue Art enough to inuent new Fables, as incredible as ancient fictions: it ſeemes Diuinity coſt you nothing; and

becauſe your Predeceſſors haue furniſhed Heauen with all ſorts of people, and ſince Aſtrologers haue there placed Monſters, you ſuppoſe it may bee likewiſe lawfull for you▪ at leaſt, to get entrance there for ſome of your Friends. You may doe Sir, what you pleaſe; nor haue I any cauſe to blame the height of you affection, ſince I hold he loues not ſufficiently, who loues not exceſſiuely. It will onely bee the good Wits of our Age who will not pardon you; and will take it impatiently, to ſee my Name in your Verſes with as great Splendor and Pompe as that of Artemiſa and Ydalia. But as you imploy not other mens paſſions either in matter of have or loue; ſo I ſuppoſe you make leſſe vſe of their Eyes in iudging the truth of things. In this caſe, I am ſufficiently confident of my Retoricke to aſſure my ſelfe I ſhall at all times perſwade you, that I am more Eſtimable then mine Enemies: and that they haue no other aduantage ouer me, who am ſicke, but only health, it they inioy it. Beſides, you need not make any Apology,

in excuſe of your tediouſneſſe: I well perceiue by the Excellency of your labours, the time you haue therein imployed, and know that perfection is not preſently to be attayned. A Crafts-man may eaſily in a ſhort time finiſh diuerſe Statues of Clay, or Plaſter; but theſe are but for a dayes vſe, or to ſerue as Ornaments at a Cities tryumph, not to continue many Kings raignes: Thoſe who carue in Braſſe or Marble waxe old vpon their Workes, and doubtleſſe, matters euer to endure are long to be meditated: if my Megreme would permit mee, I could ſay more vnto you, but all J can obtayne of it, is to ſigne this Letter, and to aſſure you that J am perfectly

               LETTER XVII.
               SInce you deſire to ſee in what Stile J begun to Write; and how ſufficient a fellow

I was at nineteene: I here ſend you my Errours of that Age, and the firſt faults I committed: it were much better to condemne their memory, then to fall into them a freſh, by renewing them in this place. But you will be abſolutely obeyed, and J haue no reſiſtance againſt your force: See heere then the remainder of many things now loſt, and what I haue ſaued from ſhip-wracke, being neither valuable to the Diamonds, or lumpes of Ambergreece, the Sea hath lately caſt vpon vpon the Coaſt of Bayone.
               
               
                  I aduiſe you for your honours ſake, not to refreſh the memory of what is paſt, nor to ſeeke for examples of your fidelity in our Ciuill warres, ſince you haue not therein conſerued it. You may hereupon ſay what you pleaſe, and try (if you can) to make things ſeeme to vs contrary to what they are; yet am I well aſſured, you were engaged in a faction, wherein you haue not beene vſefull to the King, no, nor where you could ſerue him as an honeſt man ought; ſo as if you deſire I ſhould

to doe you a fauour) forget things paſt; or if you will alledge that the tranquility we now enioy, and the good order vſed in mannaging Publique affaires, were the effects of your prudent conduct; beſides, that this glory is not abſolutely due vnto you, and there remaining others who ſuppoſe they haue as large a ſhare therein as your ſelfe. You muſt not take it ill, if I freely tell you, there is not any thing therein worthy of admiration. You entred vpon the State▪gouernment in a peaceable time, you therein found all things ſo wel diſpoſed, as they ſeemed of themſelues to worke the wiſhed effects; and the moſt of the French ſo inclined to ſubiection, as it was no hard matter to bring them to due obedience. And herein you are neceſſarily to confeſſe, you owe much to CCC, and that he paſſed the laſt yeares of his life for your inſtructions, as he ſince then, dyed for the generall good of this Kingdome. If there hath beene any obſtacle to remooue, which at this preſent may be troubleſome vnto you, he hath before his

death rid his hands thereof, with as much good fortune as reſolution. If it may be eſteemed a benefit, to vnderſtand the nature of the people, thereby to deale with them according to their humours, he hath made it appeare vnto you, there was not any thing aboue his patience; ſince without reſentment, he was able to ſuffer the loſſe of his liberty; and if ſo it were, that he was forced to make vſe of ſome violent act, which neuertheleſſe was neceſſary; neither hatred, nor enuy, haue euer beene of power to hinder his vndertakings. In a word, he hath tamed the moſt ſtubborne ſpirits, he hath left the parties who moſt perplexed this poore Kingdome, either abſolutely ruined, or ſo weakned, as they are vtterly vnable to riſe againe. He hath accuſtomed all men to patience, and hath performed ſo ſtrange things, as wee now finde not any thing extraordinary; and (what I moſt eſteeme) hee hath made the world ſee, how great things the Kings authority was able to doe, though ſometimes he did this for the eſtabliſhing his

owne. I therefore doe not at all now wonder, if hauing found affaires diſpoſed to receiue ſuch impreſſions, as you pleaſed to put vpon them, you haue hitherto cauſed them to fall out indifferently well, or if you haue not as yet committed any confiderable errours in the mannaging of State-affaires, as not hauing any matter of difficulty to ouercome, you haue onely herein ſuffered your ſelfe to be guided by common and ordinary preſidents. But what is all this? that your indeauours ſhould deſerue to be preferred before all thoſe ſeruices the D. and P. with their Predeceſſors haue performed. Had you any imagination, when you ſpake in ſo high tearmes, you could cauſe vs to beleeue ſo great improbabilities; or had you ſo poore an Opinion of all mens iudgements, as to ſuppoſe wee more valued your feares and continuall diſtruſts, then ſo many generous actions, performed by them in the eye of all Chriſtendome, for the glory and reputation of this Crowne▪ 
                  I will not touch vpon the

merits of the liuing, leſt you ſhould impute that to a deſire of complacency, or ſome particular obligation, which the onely intereſt of truth exacteth of me. I onely require iuſtice for the dead, whom you haue dared to wrong in the Kings preſence, againſt all rules of Piety, obliging you to reſpect their memory. Doubt not, but that they are yet ſenſible of things in this world, and that amidſt the glory and contentments they poſſeſſe, their care to liue in the good odour of men, doth yet continue: You may therefore well imagine, they haue iuſt cauſe to thinke, thoſe liues they haue loſt in their Princes ſeruice, and for the defence of their Country, had beene ill imployed, and might iuſtly complaine of our ingratitude▪ ſhould we ſuffer before our eyes their reputations to be queſtioned, without teſtifying any diſtaſte. In vaine had they triumphed ouer the moſt beautifull parts of the earth, and carryed their victorious Armes where the name of France was not yet arriued. To ſmall purpoſe had they recluded the

power of ſtrangers, wherein the limits Nature preſcribed vnto them. In vaine likewiſe, euen in our memory had they conſerued State and Religion, when thoſe of your faction did diuerſly labour the ruine of both▪ ſhould you now be ſuffered to enter into compariſon with them; or as though the poſſeſſion of that glory wherein they alwaies remained, were vniuſtly controuerted in their caſe. But the miſchiefe herein is, that we haue only right on our ſide, and that all things are ſo auerſe vnto vs, as it wil be very hard to cauſe reaſon to be ſo much as regarded, becauſe it fauours vs; ſo as I get nothing by diſputing with a man who is aboue Lawes, and in whoſe behalfe, the King hath receiued ſo aduantagious impreſsions, as he may ſecurely exerciſe his paſsions, vnder pretext of his authority, and confound his particular enmities, togetherwith the intereſts of the Common-wealth. I ſhould be very leath to ſay you are growne to ſuch extremities, or that out of vanity and preſumption, two imperfections purely humane, you ſhould ſo ſuddainly ſtept into Cruelty and tyranny,
                  
two Diabolicall Errors. Neuertheleſſe, if hauing great power in the Kings breaſt, (as indeed you may do much, you cauſe a generall diffidence therein of all things, and indeauour to bring his beſt ſeruants into ſuſpition with him, thereby to make them vnvſefull: if you intend by imaginary iealouſies to diuert his inclination from that goodneſſe, whereto at all times it hath had an extraordinary propention; or if you hinder him from the free vſe of his naturall debonarity toward her, who brought him into this World. Do you not thinke men willbeginne to ſay, it is not vanity alone hath ſpoyled you? and that it will not be generally wiſhed, that the Maximes you make vſe of, were ſomewhat more Christian, and leſſe contrary to Gods Commandments. I know we haue a Prince of ſuch perfection, as Heauen it ſelfe cannot without miracle make farther addition, then Experience. So timely a wiſe man, hath ſcarce euer bin; all his inclinations do wholy ayme at good, and Vertue is to him ſo naturall, as I verily beleeue he would be much troubled to do ill.

But you are not ignorant that one cannot giue poyſon to any man ſo eaſily, as to him who in taking it, ſuppoſeth he receiueth wholeſome Phiſicke, and that ill counſells haue neuer ſo great power ouer our ſpirits, as when wee embrace them without diſtruſt. Surely the vttermoſt of euills is that, whereof we haue neither knowledge nor apprehenſion; nor is there any fault more dangerous, then when we make vſe of reaſon it ſelfe in our errours. I haue no purpoſe to offend any with my diſcourſe, and doe intreate you to beleeue, I thinke it very well you make vſe of all the meanes, you ſuppoſe, may conduce to the cauſing the Kings authority to become more awfull to all men, and publicke peace further confirmed. Theſe are two ſo delicate matters, as they cannot be touched without danger, nor conſerued with ouer-much care. Yet muſt you pardon me, if J ſay you are to bee very circumſpect, leſt in thinking to ſtrengthen this authority, you abuſe it not to the preiudice of your owne Conſcience; and you

are withall to conſider, that Peace cannot be of any long continuance, if it be not pleaſing to God, who hath neuer ſuffered without reſentment, that the Lawes of Nature ſhould be violated. Theſe Lawes the Barbarians themſelues allow of, haue not beene eſtabliſhed either by force, or neceſſity, as others are: The firſt thing we can doe, is to follow them, and the obedience wee yeelde them, can neither be milder, nor more eaſie: They are not engrauen vpon Marble, but are borne with vs; they are not peculiar to one people or Countrey, but are common to all men: They haue not ordayned any puniſhment for thoſe who will not obſerue them, ſo was it not probable, that any could be found ſo much their owne enemies, as to be inclined to ſuch extreamities. To conclude, they were not made for the meane and vulgar people onely, but for all the world: and thoſe are the more ſtrictly thereto obliged, who owe moſt to their extraction. If this be true (as you cannot but know) ſhould not Heauen be iniured? things both Diuine and Morall, ſhould

they not be openly diſpiſed, would not Nature her ſelfe cry vengeance againſt you, ſhould you by your crafts and diſguiſements animate a young Prince againſt that perſon, who of all the world, ought to be moſt deare vnto him, and deface out of his Royall ſoule by your ſeruile feares (ill founded) his firſt and moſt innocent affections? I will not beleeue for mine owne content, and the honour of our age, that this miſchiefe can happen; but I am much perplexed to know who it is, that cauſeth all honeſt men to ſigh, who hindreth vs the perfect feeling of that felicity peace affords, and which compaſſionateth euen ſtrangers, who are leaſt intereſſed in our affaires. Will you haue ſo ſauage a ſoule, as to dread the faireſt thing the world affoordeth? or can you be ſo puſillanimous, as to haue any timorous reflection vpon an afflicted perſon? Can you imagine goodneſſe it ſelfe ſhould doe hurt, or that the Court cannot without danger behold what it hath heretofore ſeene with ſo great contentment? For my part, if this be thus, I finde no difference betweene a loſt

ſtate, and one concerning it ſelfe in this ſort; and it muſt needes be, thoſe miſeries you apprehend, are very violent, if they exceede your remedies. Alas, if we haue forgotten we are Chriſtians, ſhall wee not at leaſt remember we are men? if we be almoſt inſenſible, euen to brutality, ſhall wee not yet affoord ſomething to apparance? Be ſatisfied in being in eſtimation and fauour with the King: Gouerne alone, (if you can) all his affaires; adminiſter Iuſtice without any aſſiſtant; take all his authority into your owne hands; yet ſuffer his Mother to ſee him, giue way that hee refuſe her not a fauour, which he cannot hinder, euen his very enemies, ſometimes from enioying. Affoord, ſince it is in your power, this fauour to all France; appeaſe in time thoſe publicke complaints ready to riſe againſt you, and ſlackning ſome part of your rigorous counſels, adde this onely point, deficient in the felicity of this Kings reigne. If you can procure ſo pious a thing, and ſo pleaſing to God and Man; this great reputation of Honeſty you haue ſhrewdly hazarded, will

returne with more glitter, and luſter then euer it had; wee will not beleeue our owne eyes, if they ſhew vs any thing oppoſite thereunto: Wee will ſuppoſe it is ſome other who had a deſire to outſtrip the D. and P. and how there is not any apparance, that a man in whom age ought to finiſh, what the ſtudy of Wiſedome had happily left vnperfect, ſhould ſtill be ſubiect to enter into errours. But if on the other ſide, you goe on in abuſing our good Kings facility, and vnprofitably to perplexe his ſpirits with perpetuall diſtruſts, if you diſguiſe all things vnto him, on purpoſe to cauſe him to perceiue nothing, but what you pleaſe, not to take notice of ill, being hidden vnder the apparance of its contrary; perſwade not your ſelfe, that God will long ſuffer Truth to be unknowne. Doe not thinke, but things will ſhortly returne to the ſame tearmes wherein Nature placed them; or that the King hauing once diſcouered the bad deſignes of his Fauousites, will not eaſily be induced once againe to amaze the whole world, by a ſecond example of his Iuſtice,
                  
and to ſatisfie his peoples complaints, by abandoning them to Publicke vengeance. Then will you ouer-late reflect vpon this worlds vanity: you will then conſider, that when wee eſteemed you happy, you are mounted to a place frō whence there is not any, who haue not fallen, and how Fortune enuious of your felicity, drew you from that ſweete and peaceable life, wherein you were entred; fearing leſt thereby you might conſerue your Vertue, or therein auoide your ruine.
            
            
               To Mounſieur Malherbe.
               
               LETTER XVIII.
               AFter I haue told you how deare the teſtimonies I receiued from your remembrance, are vnto me; I can doe no leſſe then thanke you for the good Justice you affoorded me. If the like Jntegrity were to bee found among thoſe, who haue the life and fortunes of men in their hands, I ſhould take pleaſure in pleading, and by the ſame

reaſon Lawes puniſh offenders, I might hope to be rewarded. It may be I flatter my ſelfe, but I ſuppoſe my intereſt is the ſame with all honeſt men, and that they can no longer liue in ſecurity, ſince I am fallen vpon, for the vertues I value in them. Surely if the World ſuffer ill tongues to touch vpon my labours, it is very probable, they will not ſpare other mens; and that hereafter there will not be any thing ſo excellent, which ſhall not be hated, nor ſo holy, ſome Lyſander will not violate. Theſe ill examples therefore are not to be ſuffered, nor is it to be tollerated, that one particular perſon forſake publicke beleefe, to relye vpon his owne peculiar ſence: and ſhould this diſorder continue, Artificers and Farmers would (at length) prooue reformers of State. I pretend not hereby to leſſen the fauour I receiued from you: But on the contrary, I am ſo eaſie to oblige, as I ſuppoſe my friends giue me all whatſoeuer they take not from me; you will yet auouch thus much, that ſupporting my ſide, you doe in ſome ſort fight

in your owne defence: For if to day they ſay, my Stile is not good, to morrow they will maintaine your Rimes to be naught. But it is now time, after I haue thanked you, that I wrangle with you, and complaine for hauing beene iniured in the perſon of Mounſieur de Racan, whom you taxe for a diſeaſe, whereof I haue beene dead this ten yeares. I doubt not, but that part of vs whereby wee are men, as well as by Reaſon, hath heretofore acquired you Honour; and that our Hiſtory ought to yeeld a glorious teſtimony of your forepaſſed Vertues in that kind: But ſince you can no longer be happy therein, but by memory; and that your Courage will now ſtand in neede of your Sonnes aſſiſtance; me thinkes, it is vnſeemely for you to ſcoffe at our weakeneſſe; for howſoeuer in accuſing vs, for not hauing continued young ſo long as your ſelfe, you can onely taxe vs for arriuing at the Hauen ſooner then you haue done. There is none but M. F. who may boldly laugh at the debility of others, and make leſts at our

charge; but hee hath reaſon ſo to doe, ſince his merit herein is generally acknowledged; as being little leſſe valiant in thoſe feates, then that ancient Heroes, who ſubdued Monſters, and in one Night was fifty times Sonne in law to one of his Hoſtes. I infinitely eſteeme the eminent qualities where with hee is adorned, and find nothing in him which is not perfectly pleaſing. But when I conſider, that he is capeable to cauſe vs to bee deſpiſed by a whole ſexe, and to make vs ridiculous to the moſt beautifull part of the World, I haue great conteſtation within my ſelfe, to forbeare to wiſh him ill; and what part ſoeuer I take, touching the glory all men allow him: Yet doth it not a little anger me, that my Eloquence is not ſo maſculine as his.

               VVEre it not for the Letter you wrot me, I ſhould haue ſtood in neede of all my

Philoſophy to comfort my ſelfe for the loſſe I haue receiued. But ſince you haue ſent mee the counterfeit of that diuine company I left at Paris, hauing thereby ſomething, repreſenting my forepaſſed good fortune; take it not ill, I begin to haue leſſe apprehenſion then formerly I had, of the diſcomfort I ſuffer in being remooued from you; or if J ſay, you haue cauſed your abſence to become thereby the leſſe irkeſome vnto mee, which otherwiſe would haue prooued inſupportable. Lucidor doth ouer-much oblige me in retayning me in his memory, and in deſiring my company in his inchanted Pallace. J beſeech you to tell him, I ſhall neuer forget the happy day wee there ſpent, and that I cannot beleeue, there is a more excellent Structure euen in the Roman Kingdome, though builded by the very hands of Taſso, or Arioſto: in ſadneſſe my thoughts ſtayed there, when I parted thence, I ſtill walke in his Allies; I wander in his Woods, and ſlumber vpon the bankes of the Fairies Fountaine, whereof I need only

drinke a drop to turne Poet: That infinity of different beauties diſcouering themſelues to our eyes, at the opening of the gates, cauſed mee inſtantly to hate Rome, Paris, and all Citties; and I tearmed the Duke of Venice miſerable, in that hee is condemned neuer to remoue from the place where he is, and conſequently neuer to ſee what J there beheld. The Foote-poſt, who is to carry this Letter, doth much preſſe my diſpatch, telling me, hee ſhall hazard, to remaine ſtill in this place, if I make it an longer. This is equally my miſery, and your good fortune; for as I am conſtrained to depriue my ſelfe of the contentment to entertaine time with you, ſo will this free you from diuers impertinent ſpeeches, wherewith happily I ſhould otherwiſe haue importuned you.

               LETTER XX.
               I can no longer liue without receiuing newes from you, and vnderſtanding from

your ſelfe, the good ſucceſſe of your voyage. My Brother writ vnto me, they haue done you ſome kinde of iuſtice, wherewith you were reaſonable well pleaſed; but if this content be not abſolute, I am reſolued not to reioyce, and I doe already condemne the State, and all thoſe who gouerne it. It is a ſhame to ſee the bounties of Princes in the hands of ſuch perſons who can neither be vſefull nor pleaſing vnto them; and that honeſt men muſt ſtill ſatisfie themſelues with the onely teſtimony of a good conſcience, and in the content they receiue in well-doing: For my part, I will not complaine of Fortune, prouided, you haue occaſion to commend her. Now if the Miniſters of State vnderſtood my ſecret, and that for ſatisfying of two, it were onely neceſſary to oblige one; by acquitting themſelues of what they owe you, they might eaſily ſpare what they haue promiſed me. Wee haue newly receiued tidings of the Defeate giuen to the Enemies nauall Army; but hauing loſt one of my neare friends in that

Conflict, I cannot forbeare to bee a bad French-man till to morrow, and to grieue for the Victory, whereatal others reioyce: Beſides, I being of a profeſſion onely exerciſed in priuate, and repoſe; I aſſure you the report of Cannons beginnes to trouble me; for of all Warres, thoſe of Germany pleaſe me beſt, in that I am thirty dayes iourneyes off: Our Doctors ſay no leſſe then I doe: the moſt zealous among them, longingly expect a more quiet ſeaſon, fearing the ruine of the aduerſe part, for the intereſt of their Arguments and Schollerſhip: and in very truth, I cannot conceiue what they ſhould doe with their controuerſies, were there no longer any againſt whom they could contend. I write you this from the banke of the moſt beautifull riuer of the world; but being ſo farre from you, I taſte all pleaſures imperfectly; and were my Kinſman reuiued, not ſeeing you, there would ſtill remaine a kinde of affliction vpon me, which nothing but your preſence is able to eaſe. VVithout playing the Poet, I can aſſure

you, I haue taught your name to all the Rocks in my wilderneſſe: and it is written vpon the Bankes of all our trees: but you are no way obliged vnto me, in that I loue you extraordinarily. It is an action independant on my will or free election, it being at this preſent as neceſſary for me, as all other things are, without which I cannot ſubſiſt: And it is requiſite I ſuffer my ſelfe to be tranſported by the force of my inclination, which another would call his Deſtiny. Be therefore when you pleaſe, mine enemy; you are aſſured I ſhall neuer be but

               A Lame Foote-man would haue made more haſte then the Meſſenger did, who deliuered me your two Letters, fifteene dayes after the latter of them was written: Yet notwithſtanding was he very welcome,

and had it beene Lyſander himſelfe, bringing newes from you, hee had beene inuiolable to all my Lackies; and I had receiued him as my Friend. Truely, there is not any diſcontent which is not loſt, in the ioy I receiue to be beloued by you, and if the ſmall diſpleaſure they haue done mee, were of power to offend me, I ſhould in your fauours finde the remedy others ſeeke for in reuenge. I haue as vnmouedly read the Satyre made againſt mee, as I write this Letter; and haue onely accuſed my bad fortune, which hath at all times choſen the moſt infamous of all men for mine enemies: you cannot imagine how much I am aſhamed of this vnlucky accident, and of the wrong I ſuppoſe I receiue, when at any time they giue mee the aduantage in a compariſon wherein Lyſander cannot enter without hauing the better of it. Yet Sir, I am reſolued to haue patience, prouided, the Warre you raiſe againſt me, be onely feigned, and that you ſpeake not ſeriouſly; for ſurely I would burne all my papers, werethey culpable of one ſingle word diſpleaſing vnto you; and

my thoughts ſhould be farre different from my intention, had I done any thing diſguſtfull vnto you; howſoeuer, I craue pardon for the fault whereof you accuſe me, though I ſuppoſe I haue not done you any ſo ill offices to faire Ladies, as it ſeemes you would perſwade me: On the contrary, if my teſtimony be ſeconded by their aſcents, there will not be hereafter any among them, who will not looke vpon you, as at one of their chiefeſt felicities; and who will not ſell all her Pearles, to purchaſe one of your Nights. Queenes will come from the remoteſt parts of the World, to taſte the pleaſure of your conuerſation; and you ſhall be the third▪ after Salomon and Alexander, who ſhall cauſe them to come at the report of your Vertue. As for deuoute perſons, I doe not thinke they will ranke Health and Strength in the number of Vices; for by that reaſon they ſhould hold all thoſe for Saints, whom the Courts of Parliament haue declared as impotent, and ſo fill Heauen with ſicke folkes. To ſay truth, I cannot deny, but I haue giuen the Alarum to Married men,

and I muſt ſay, your viſits will be ſuſpicious to thoſe who know you not: But when they ſhall vnderſtand what I intend to publiſh in all places, that you had rather dye, then violate with ſo much as one ſingle thought, the lawes of true Friendſhip, and that your fidelity is irreproueable: Inſteade of auoyding you, as an obiect of ſcandall, they will propound you to their Wiues as an example of Continency. I could alledge diuers other things for my Iuſtification, but if you thinke I haue beene faulty, I will not preſume to imagine J am innocent; and rather then contradict you, I will ſigne the decree of my Death with mine owne hand.

               LETTER XXII.
               THere is no other meanes to exceed the hight of what you haue written, nor to anſwer the ciuilities of your Letter, but only by rendring you all your owne words,

I know not your meaning: but to take the moſt vnprofitable of your Friends, for your benefactor, and to thanke me for the ill I doe you, is no leſſe then ſtrangely to abuſe the propriety of words, eſpecially for a man ſo perfectly acquainted with our language, as your ſelfe; or queſtionleſſe it muſt needes be, you ſuffer my perſecutions with the like patience, as good men receiue thoſe afflictions God layes vpon them. For as loſſes and diſeaſes are preſents and fauours in tearmes of Deuotion; ſo doe you beſtow pompous names vpon poore matters, and you make your ſelfe beleeue, you ſhall draw ſome aduantage out of my Amity, though in truth you extract nothing thence but charge; nor doth it produce any better effects, then thornes: And vpon the matter, what elſe are the paines and affaires, I perpetually put vpon you; or what difference is there betweene the hatred of an Enemy, and ſo troubleſome an affection as mine? It is I who diſturbe your reſt, who vſurpe your liberty, who will not ſuffer you to haue any

leaſure, though that be the true poſſeſſion of the Wiſe. It is no want of good-will in me, that I change not all your kindneſſe into choller, and make not a pleader and wrangler of the beſt tempered ſpirit Philoſophy euer receiued from Nature; I lay Ambuſhes for you at Paris, at Fontainebleau, and at St. Germaines: Yea, ſhould you thinke to hide your ſelfe at the worlds end, to auoide importunities, I would vndertake the voyage of Magellan, to ſeeke you out there: yet are you well pleaſed with all this, and I receiue thankes inſtead of expecting ill words. The care you haue to oblige me, exceedes all I can deſire: Good offices come thicke vpon me, when they proceede from your ſide; and they are actions it ſeemes you are pleaſed to conuert into habitudes. Without entring into infinities, doe I not of recent memory owe to your teſtimony, all the good opinion your excellent friend can haue of me; and if hee imagine I am worthy any eſtimation, is it not you who ſets a value vpon my defects, and who

haue aſſiſted me in deceiuing him? But in what ſort ſoeuer you haue procured me theſe fauours, be it that therein you haue either committed theft, or made an acquiſition, I am ſtill right happy to be beloued by a man, who hath the reputation not to affect ill things, and to pleaſe whom, it is as much as to be reckoned in the number of honeſt men. The day before I parted from Court, I had the leaſure to obſerue him at Mounſieur the Marſhall of Schambergs houſe; but I aſſure you, I could ſpie nothing of ſlender conſideration, either in his words, or aſpect; and though I haue alwayes vſed to be diffident of my firſt opinion; nor euer to iudge without long deliberation, I haue notwithſtanding herein, ſinned againſt my owne rules; and was not aſhamed to ſay, that a wit of twenty yeares had amazed mine: But the Sermon bell rings, which calls and forceably drawes me from you: my contentment therefore muſt giue place to my duty, which commands mee to make an end, after I haue required newes from you,

concerning a woman, to whom I am extraordinarily and particularly obliged; of a woman I ſay, who is more worth then all our bookes, and in whoſe conuerſation there is ſufficient to make one an honeſt man, without either the helpe of Greekes or Romans: How old a Courtier ſoeuer you are, you vnderſtand not French, if you vnderſtand not Madame de Deſloges.

               I Hope very ſhortly to follow theſe few lines, and to come to court you with as much aſſiduity and ſubiection, as though you were to be the founder of my fortunes. I haue no other buſineſſe at Paris, but this; though I frame many pretexts for that voyage, but I ſweare ſeriouſly you are the onely cauſe. My melancholy is of late become ſo blacke, and my ſpirits are ſo beclouded, as I muſt of neceſſity ſee you, to diſſipate

them. It is to ſmall purpoſe to ſpeake well of me in the place where you are, they doe me no good though; this is as much as to caſt incenſe vpon a dead body, and to ſtrow flowers vpon his graue, but this is no reuiuing of him. I no longer receiue any comfort in the newes you ſend me, and I am well aſſured my misfortune is conſtant, what alteration ſo euer happen in the World: it remayneth then, that I ſeeke for my conſolation in your preſence, and powre forth all my complaynts into your boſome; this I will do at the firſt ſight of the Sun-beames, beſeeching you to beleeue, that as in the middeſt of felicity, I ſhould haue neede of you to make me happy; ſo alſo hauing ſuch a friend as your ſelfe, I ſhall neuer eſteeme my ſelfe abſolutely miſerable.

                  Balzac his Letter to Hidaſpe.
               
               LETTER XXIIII.
               I Doe far more eſteeme the Carthuſians ſilence, then the Eloquence of ſuch Writers, and am perſwaded, (excepting in Church Seruice, and for the neceſſity of Commerce) the Pope and the King ſhould do well to forbid them Lattin and French; whereof they ſeeke to make two barbarous languages. I know well, that French ſpirits are ſworne Enemies to all ſorts of bondage, and that twelue hundred yeares of Monarchy, hath not beene of power to make them loſe their liberty, it being as naturall to them as life it ſelfe. Whatſoeuer vgly face they frame to the Inquiſition, and how full of Tygers and Serpents ſoeuer they paint the ſame, yet do I finde it right neceſſary in this Kingdome: For beſides that, it would cauſe (as in Spaine and Italy) euen the wicked in ſome ſort, to reſemble the Vpright, and vice not at all to offend the publicke Eye: it would beſides

hinder Fooles from filling the World with their baſtardly Bookes, and the faults of Schoole maiſters from being as frequent as thoſe are of Magiſtrates, and Generals of Armies. Truly it is a ſhame there are Lawes againſt thoſe who counterfeite Coynes and falſifie Merchandizes; yet that ſuch are freely permitted who corrupt Phyloſophy and Eloquence, and who violate thoſe things, the Vulgar ought no more to meddle with, then with State gouernment, or Religious Myſteries. The late great Plague was of ſmall conſideration in compariſon of this, which checkes all the World: and ſurely, if ſpeedy order be not taken, the multiplicity of our Authors, will make a Lybrary as big as Paris, wherein there ſhall ſcarcely be found one good word, or reaſonable conceit. Theſe be the fruites ariſing out of inordinate idleneſſe, and the third ſcourge cauſed by Peace, ſent to afflict this poore Realme after Duels, and Law-ſuites. There are hardly any to be found, who are contented to keep their faults and follies to themſelues, or to ſin in ſecret; but are alſo doting vpon their

owne follies, as they deſire to engraue them in Marble and Braſſe, thereby to Eternize their memory, and to make them paſt retracting. Now to returne to the party of whom you particularly required my opinion, and who indeede is the firſt ſubiect of this Letter. I muſt ingeniouſly confeſſe vnto you, that next to Beere and Pbyſicke, I neuer found any thing ſo diſtaſtefull as his works: he wanteth (almoſt throughout) euen naturall Logicke, yea that part thereof which prooueth men to be reaſonable creatures. In three words hee ſpeakes foure bad ones, and as he alwayes ſtrayeth from the ſubiect whereof he treateth, ſo doth he ordinarily talke in an vnknowne language; though he intend to ſpeake French: Beſides yce it ſelfe is not more cold then his conceites, and when he deſires to be facetious (as at euery turne hee faine would) he had neede to be in fee with his Reader, to make him laugh, as at Funerals in Paris, weepers are vſually hired for money. There is no queſtion but truth were of far more force, and diſarmed, then it can

be with the aſſiſtance this ſimple Fellow would ſtriue to affoord her: Now ſuppoſing ſuch men were ingaged in the right, without any treacherous deſigne, yet is it as much as to abandon Gods cauſe, to ſuffer it to be ſupported by ſo weake and vnworthy Pennes. The Renegadoes haue not ſo much wronged Chriſtianity▪ as thoſe who haue not valiantly defended themſelues againſt the Turkes, and ſuch who through defect of conduct and skill, though they wanted neither zeale, nor affection, ſuffer themſelues to be ſurpriſed by the ſame aduantages, they otherwiſe might haue had ouer their enemies. Truely the Empire of the wicked doth much more maintaine it ſelfe by our puſillanimity, then by its owne power or forces; nor doth any thing cauſe▪ Vertue to be ſo badly followed, as doth the weake and vnskilfull teaching and explanation thereof. It were therefore requiſite, ſome wiſe man, who had beene in this Countrey, where there is continuall debate, and where there is neuer eyther peace or truce,

(called the Colledge of Sarbow;) and who beſides had the art to make good things gratefull, and could bring matters to attonement by a ſweete hand; ſhould come to cleanſe the Court from thoſe opinions lately introduced, and cure Soules inſtead of wounding them with iniuries. It was that great Cardinall who triumphed ouer all humane ſpirits, and whoſe memory ſhall euer be ſacred, ſo long as there remaine any Alltars▪ or that oblarion is offered on Earth. It was I ſay the Cardinall of Perron, who was able to ſhew Epiourus himſelfe, ſomething more ſublime and tranſcendent then this life, and cauſe his fleſhy ſoule to be capeable of the greateſt ſecrets of Chriſtian Religion. Though this man had a dignity equall in hight to the greateſt Conquerors and Monarchs: Yet had he (in what concerned Religion) an heart as humble as that of decreped men and Infants. How often hath hee (with thoſe two different qualities) impoſed ſilence vpon all Philoſophyi, and ſpoken of Diuine matters, with as great perſpicuity

as though he had already beene in Heauen; or had ſeene the ſame diuine verity wholy diſcouered, whereof here on earth, we haue onely a confuſed vnderſtanding, and imperfect knowledge. To tell you in plaine tearmes, but for the workes of this diuine perſon, which I as highly eſteeme as the victories of the late King his Maiſter, and wherein I deſire alwayes to leaue mine eyes, when I am neceſſitated to giue ouer reading: I had beene much troubled to retire my ſelfe from the tracing the Booke you ſent me, ſince any miſchiefe doth ſo eaſily catch hold of mee, when I come neare it, as I can hardly looke vpon a begger without taking the itch, and my imagination is ſo tender and delicate, as it is ſenſible▪ and afflicted at the ſight of any baſe obiect; yet thankes be to God, and the Antidote I continually take, I am the better armed againſt the conſpiracy you intended againſt me: and haue yet life in me, after hauing beene vnder a fooles hands longer then I deſired. But by what I can gather, he is notwithſtanding in good repute in the

place where you are, and likely enough to finde ſtore of ſuch as will follow him, in that he is head of an euill party. I can herevnto anſwere you nothing, ſaue onely that betweene this place and the Pyrenean Mountaines, good wits doe ſometimes ſtray from common opinion, as from a thing too vulgar; and doe often take counterfeit vertues, yea, euen thoſe who haue not any reſemblance to the right, for perfect varities: But when I conſider, how there is ſcarce any kind of beaſt which hath not heretofore beene adored among Idolaters, nor any diſeaſe incident either  to the body, or minde of man, whereunto Antiquity hath not erected Temples. I doe not as all maruell, why diuers mon doe ſometimes eſteeme of thoſe, who are no way deſeruing; or why ſimple people ſhould hold Sots in high reputation, ſince they haue addreſſed incenſe to Apes and Orotadiles. The thing I moſt ve
                     •
                  e as herin, is, that both your ſelfe &amp; I, are in ſome ſort obliged to the Author of the book you ſent me, &amp; that I haue receiued the beginnings of my ſtudios, and firſt tincture of Learning from

the laſt, and leaſt eſtimable of all men. For my part, I proteſt before all the world, I am not for all that guilty, either of the follies he will fall into, or of any ſuch as he hath formerly cōmitted: and that hauing had much adoe to purifie my vnderſtanding from the orders of the Colledge, and to quit my ſelfe from peruerſe ſtudies, I haue now no other pretention, but to follow ſuch as can no way be reproachable vmo mee. How ſoeuer, I ſhould not reiect Chastity, though my Nurſe had died of the Poxe; and it may ſometimes happen, that a bungling Maſon may lay ſome few ſtones in the building of the Loouer, or at the Queene-mothers Pallace.
            
            
               LETTER XXV.
               THe Letter newly deliuered vnto me from you, is but three Moneths and an halfe old: it is an Age wherein men are yet yong, yet ſome Popes haue not reigned ſo long, and in the ſtate wherein the Churches▪
                   affaires haue often ſtood. You might haue written vnto me at the beginning of one Papacy, and

                  I had receiued yours at the end of another; howſoeuer▪ 
                  J can no way better imploy my patience, then in attending my good fortune; and as it was the vſe to be inuited a yeare before hand to the Sybarites Feaſts, ſo is it fitting you make me long attend the moſt perfect content I enioy in this world. I doubt not but T. T. ſeeketh all occaſions to doe me ill offices, and that my abſence affoordeth him much aduantage to wrong me; but on the other ſide, I cannot thinke men will more readily beleeue mine enemies words, then mine owne actions; or that it is ſufficient onely to ſlander an honeſt man, to make him preſently wicked. It is true what he ſaith, that I am not very vſefull for Adamantaes ſeruice, I will at all times readily yeelde that quality to his Coach horſes, &amp; to the Mules that carry his Coffers: Yet am I too well acquainted with the Generoſity of that Signiour, to thinke he doth more eſteeme the body, then the ſoule, or to ſuppoſe that a Farmer ſhould be of higher conſideration with him, then a man of worth. What confeſsion of Faith

ſoeuer R. makes, I will not imagine hee can euer be really altered: I had rather both for mine owne contentment and his honour beleeue, it is onely a voyage he hath made into the Aduerſaries Countrey, to the end to bring vs ſome newes, and to giue vs account of what paſſeth at Charenton: Surely, I ſuppoſe, I ſhould not wrong him ſo much in holding him for a Spye among Enemies, as to call him a forſaker of his ſide, and a Fugitiue from that Church, whereto he hath at leaſt this obligation, (if he will confeſſe no other) that it is ſhe who made him a Chriſtian. You may doe me a courteſie, to make mee acquainted with the cauſe mouing him to forſake vs, and to goe from thoſe Maximes hee hath ſo often preached vnto mee; That a wiſe man dyes in the Religion of his Mother: That he neuer alters his opinion: That hee neuer repents himſelfe of his forepaſſed life therein: That all Nouelties are to him ſuſpicious.
               
               It is long ſince J knew, that no mans cauſe can be bad in the hands of Mounſieur 'd Andilly, and that he betters all he affects:

he intereſſed himſelfe in my protection, the firſt day he ſaw any workes; ſo as it is not any more my ſelfe whom hee commends, but his owne Iudgement, which he is bound to defend: Yet will I not deſiſt from being much obliged vnto him: For I ſuppoſing one affoords mee a fauour, when at any time hee doth me Iuſtice, you may well thiuke, I haue right particular, and moſt tender ſenſibilities for thoſe courteſies I receiue, but they are in ſpeciall regard with me, when they come from a perſon of ſo high eſtimation in my thoughts as he is, and of whom I ſhould ſtill haue much to ſay, after I had related, how amidſt the corruption of this age, and in the authority Vice therein hath gained, he hath notwithſtanding the fortitude, to continue an vpright man, and bluſheth not at Chriſtian vertues, nor vanteth of Morall ones. I hope to ſee him within few dayes, and to take poſſeſſion of ſome ſmall corner in his Houſe at Pompona, which hee hath prouided for me, there to breath at mine eaſe, and to ſet my ſpirits

ſometimes at liberty. In the interim you muſt needes know, about what I buſie my ſelfe, and that I tell you, I entertaine a foole, in whom I finde all the Actors in a Comedy, and all ſorts of extrauagancies incident to the ſpirit of man. After my bookes haue buſied me all the morning, and that I am weary of their company, I ſpend ſome part of the after-noone with him, partly to diuert my thoughts from ſerious things, which doe but nouriſh my Melancholy. Euer ſince I came into this world, I haue bin perpetually troubleſome to my ſelfe, I haue found all the houres of my life tedious vnto mee; I haue done nothing all day, but ſeeke for night. Wherefore if I deſire to be merry, I muſt neceſſarily deceiue my ſelfe, and my felicity is ſo dependant vpon exterior things, that without Painting, Muſicke, and diuers other diuertiſments, how great a Muſer ſoeuer I am, I haue not ſufficient wherewith to entertaine my ſelfe, or to bee pleaſed. Thinke not therefore, that either my foole, or my bookes are ſufficient to ſettle my contentment; nay rather

if you haue any care of mee, or if you deſire I ſhould haue no leaſure to be ſad, make me partaker of all the newes happning in the place where you are; let me fee the whole Court by your eyes, cauſe me to aſſiſt at all Sermons by your eares, giue me accompt of the good and bad paſſages happening this Winter, and that there part not a poſt, vncharged with a Gazetto of your ſtile, as there ſhall not any goe hence, who ſhall not bring▪ you ſome viſion of my retiredneſſe▪
               
               There runnes a rumour in theſe parts, that Mounſieur de Boudeuille is ſlaine, but ſince there are not many more hard atchieuements to be wrought, then that, it is too great a death to be beleeued vpon the firſt report.

Sir, I am reſolued not to be beholding to any but your ſelfe, for the happy ſucceſse wherof the goodnes of our cauſe aſſureth vs, and in caſe your Integrity ſhould be intereſſed, I would owe the whole to your fauor: For beſides, that you are borne perfectly generous, I doe not at all doubt, but the commerce you haue with good bookes, and particularly with Seneca, hath taught you the Art, To doe good to all men. But to the end the obligation I deſire to owe you, may be wholy mine owne, inſtead of referring it to the ſtudy of Morality, to your bountifull inclination, or to the Iuſtice of my requeſt: I will rather imagine, I ſhall be the ſole cauſe of this effect, and that you will act without any other aſſiſtance, out of the

loue you beare mee, who am paſsionately

                  GX. X. is reſolued to leaue all worldly affaires in the ſtate he found them, and theſe great cares which ſhould haue extended themſelues ouer the moſt remote parts of Chriſtendome, haue not as yet paſſed the limits of his houſe: He preſerues his old age, and prolongs his life by all the poſſible meanes he can imagine: But it is thought he will not long make his ſucceſſor attend, and that his Death will be the firſt newes in the Gazetto. Phiſitians and Aſtrologers haue concluded vpon this point, that he ſhall not ſee the end of Autumne. For my part, I neuer made any great difference betweene a dead perſon, and an vnprofitable one; and if things leſle perfect, ought to be poſt poſed to more excellent ones; it were a mockery to make choyce

of ſicke folkes, and cauſe them to be adored by thoſe who are in health, or to put ſoueraigne power into their hands, to the end onely to haue them leaue it to others. But it is not my part to reforme all things diſpleaſing me in this World, and I ſhould be very vngratefull, if I blamed that forme of gouernment, wherein I finde my ſelfe very well: In effect (Sir) ſpeake no more to me of the North, nor its neighbours; I declare my ſelfe for Rome againſt Paris, nor can I any longer imagine, how a man can liue happily vnder your Climate, where Winter takes vp nine Moneths of the Yeere, and after that the Sunne appeareth, onely to cauſe the Plague, and (weake as it is) forbeares not to kill men: There is not any place (Rome excepted) where life is agreeable, where the body findes its pleaſures, and the ſpirit his, where men are at the ſource of ſingular things. Rome is the cauſe you are neither Barbarian, nor Pagan, ſince ſhe hath taught you the ciuility of Religion: She hath giuen you thoſe Laves which arme you againſt errour, and thoſe Examples

whereto you owe the good actions you performe. It is from hence Inuentions and Arts are come to you, and where you haue receiued the Science of Peace and Warre, Painting, Muſicke, and Come dies are ſtrangers in France, but naturall in Italy: that great Vertue it ſelfe you ſo much admire in your Court, is ſhee not Roman? That Martchioneſſe, of whom ſo many maruells are related, is ſhee not Countrey-woman to the Mother of the Graches, and to the Wife of Bratus? and in truth, to poſſeſſe all thoſe perfections the World acknowledgeth in her, was it not fitting ſhee ſhould be borne in a place whereon Heauen defuſeth all its Graces? Truely, I neuer aſcend Mount Palatin, or the Capitole, but I change ſpirit, and others then my ordinary cogitations ſeaze vpon me. This Ayre inſpireth me with ſome great and generous thing I formerly had not; and if I muſe but two houres vpon the bankes of of Tyber, I am as vnderſtanding, as if I had ſtudied eight dayes. It is a thing I wonder at, that

being ſo farre off, you make ſo excellent Verſes, and ſo neare the Maieſty of Virgils. I ſuppoſe therefore, none will blame me, for hauing choſen Rome for the place of my abode, or for preferring flowers before ſnow and yce. If men chooſe Popes of threeſcore and ten yeeres old, and not of fiue and twenty, the dayes are therefore neither ſadder nor ſhorter, nor haue wee any ſubiect to complaine of our Maſters debility, ſince we are thereto obliged for our quiet.

               IT is not to anſwer your excellent Letter, I write you this, but onely to let you know, you haue ſo abſolutely acquired me to your ſeruice, as you haue left me no liberty to doe what I deſire, when there is any queſtion of performing your pleaſure. Since therefore you and your Printers haue conſpired againſt my quiet, and that you determine to make my infirmities

as publicke, as though you meant to leade me to the Hoſpitals or Churchporches; J am co ntented with cloſed eyes to obey you, and to put my reputation to aduenture, rather then ſeeme to refuſe you a thing you haue demanded of me. Mounſieur the Priour of Chiues, to whom I communicate my moſt ſecret thoughts, and in whoſe perſon you ſhall ſee that I know how to make good elections, (in deliuering you this Letter) may conclude it, and acquaint you with the power I haue giuen you ouer all my deſires; truely, it hath no other bounds then impoſſibilities. Since as for thoſe which are onely vniuſt, I beleeue I ſhould make ſmall ſcruple, to violate the Lawes for your ſake, and to teſtifie vnto you, that vertue it ſelfe is not more deare vnto mee then your Friendſhip; this is

               LETTER XXIX.
               BEing now ready to alter my courſe of life, and part hence to come to Court, I held my ſelfe obliged to aduertiſe you, that herein I doe, what I haue no minde vnto, and that they haue pulled me out from a ſoyle, where I ſuppoſe I had taken roote. It much afflicts me, that I muſt forſake the company of my Trees, and part from that pleaſing ſolitude my good Fortune had choſen for me, before I was borne: But ſince all the World driues me out, and becauſe what I call repoſe, my Friends tearme Puſillanimity; I muſt ſuffer my ſelfe to be carried away with the preſſe, and to erre with others, ſince they will not let me doe well by my ſelfe. Vpon my Conſcience it is not out of mine owne ambition that J am high-minded, but out of my Fathers; and if people of his time had not meaſured things by the euents, and had not belecued thoſe onely to be wiſe, who are fortunate, I ſhould not haue buſied my ſelfe in ſearching at Paris, for

what I ought to haue found in my ſelfe: But truely I haue ſo great obligation to ſo good a Father, and the care he hath taken to huſband the good graine he hath caſt into mee, and to finiſh mee after hee had framed me; haue beene ſo great and paſsionate, as there is no reaſon, I ſhould follow my priuate inclination, by reſiſting his intention. I goe therefore ſince it is his pleaſure, to liue among wilde beaſts, and to expoſe my ſelfe to hatred and calumny, as though the Feauer and Scyatica were not ſufficient to make me miſerable. At my firſt approach the Grammarians will call me into queſtion, becauſe I put not the French word Menſonge into the feminine gender, and doe not beleeue the Iuriſdiction they haue ouer words, is powerfull enough, to cauſe this word to change Sexe. Thoſe who haue not as yet written, will ſet pen to paper againſt me, and the new Bridge will eccho nothing but my name and their iniuries I ſhall be much diſtaſted to heare I am become an Author, and that I performe indifferent good peeces. The meaner ſort of ſpirits will be much

mooued, in that I haue ſet ſo high a rate vpon Eloquence, and being vnable to follow me, they will throw ſtones to ſtay me. The truth I haue not diſſembled, will at once; offend our aduerſaries and ill Preiſts; debaucht perſons wil neuer forgiue me the P. P. they haue ſeene in my bookes; and Hypocrites will wiſh mee ill, becauſe I ſet vpon vice euen within the Sanctuarie. See here (my deare friend) the perſecution prepared for me, and of what ſorts of people the Army of mine Enemies is compoſed. In all apparance there is not any valour able to ſurmount ſo great a Multitude; and I ſhould doe much better to enioy the peace of my Village, and to eate Mellons in ſecurity, then to caſt my ſelfe into this incenſed troope, and to engage my ſelfe in an endleſſe warre: yet ſince all Grammarians are not worth one Philoſopher, and in that the better part hath often the aduantage ouer the greater; I am in hope, Authority and Reaſon ſiding with me, I ſhall eaſily get the vpper hand of Multitudes and Iniuſtice. To taxe me

in theſe times wherein we are, is as much as to giue the lye to his Maſter, and to condemne the opinion of the prime men of our Age. Thoſe who gouerne at Rome, and at Paris, make my labours their delights; and when at any time they lay aſide the waight of the whole World, they refreſh themſelues with my Workes. But if ſome bad Monkes who in religious houſes, as Rats, and other imperfect creatures may happily haue beene in the Arke, ſeeke to gnaw my reputation; Mounſieur de Nantes, and Mounſieur de Berulle will conſerue it; and you know them for two men▪ whom the Church in this age beholdeth, as two Saints diſ-interred out of the memory of her Annals, or two of thoſe Primatiue Fathers, whoſe Soules were wholy repleniſhed with Ieſus Chriſt, and who haue eſtabliſhed the Truth as well by their Blood, as Doctrine. I haue beſides, as an oppoſite to my Calumniators, one of the moſt perfect Religious this day liuing; I meane Father Joſeph, whoſe great Zeale is guided by as eminent an vnderſtanding, and who hath the ſame paſſions for the generall good of

                  Chriſtendome, as Courtiers haue for their particular Intereſts. This irreproachable witneſſe knowes, I reuerence in others the Piety I finde not in my ſelfe; and if I performe not all the actions of a perfectly vertuous perſon, yet haue I at leaſt all the ſenſibilities and deſires. Mounſieur the Abbot of St. Cyran, who is not ignorant of any thing falling within the compaſſe of humane vnderſtanding, beſides the more ſublime gifts and illuminations where with he is adorned, and who in a right profound Litterature, hath yet a more reſigned humility, will anſwer for me in the ſame caſe; and though all theſe ſtrange forces ſhould faile me; haue I not ſufficient in the protection of the Biſhop of Aire, and Mounſieur Bouthilier, who doe both of them loue me, as though I had the honour to be their Brother; and who are ſo ſage, ſo iudicious, and ſo vnderſtanding in all things, as it is not probable, they would begin to erre by the good opinion they haue of me: I ſuppoſe that hereupon I may venter to goe to Court, and that with ſo powerfull aſſiſtance, there are no enemies I neede

feare. Yet will I once againe tell you, and I beſeech you beleeue mee, I would not part hence, were I permitted to ſtay; and that it doth not a little trouble me, to loſe the ſight of my pathes and allyes wherein I walke, without being enforced to weare Bootes, or haue any apprehenſion of Carroaches.

               LETTER XXX.
               I Am doubtfull to beleeue you ſpeake in earneſt in your Letter, and that he, of all men, who hath moſt cauſe to be ſatiſfied with himſelfe, ſhould neede the aſſiſtance of any other to comfort him. This is as much as to be diſtaſted amidſt the abundance of all things, and to be vngratefull toward your good fortune, ſince in the height of thoſe fauours you receiue, and expectation of thoſe prepared for you; you notwithſtanding ſeeke for forraine pleaſures, and are ſenſible of petty contentments among great felicities. My writings are no obiects but for ſicke and ſad eyes;

yea, of ſuch as will be neither cured, nor comforted: They may indeede flatter melancholy, and affoord a man (in deſpaire) poyſon not vnpleaſing vnto him; but to contribute any thing to the ſatisfaction of a contented ſpirit, and to mingle thēſelues with the pleaſures of his life, without corrupting all the ſweetnes, is a thing I can hardly be drawn to beleeue: And I herein imagine you haue rather a deſigne to tel me ſome good newes, then to write a true Hiſtory vnto me. At the age of ooooo. you are ſeated vpon Flower-de-luces, and can you lye downe vpon Roſes? You are wiſe, and haue not acquired the ſame with loſſe of your beſt yeares; you are borne the ſame wee deſire to be at the beſt: on what ſide ſoeuer you caſt your eyes, you find preſent felicities, and certaine hopes; and were there neither Loouer nor Pallace to promiſe you preferments or offices, the houſe where you are, may alone make you happy. There it is, where vertue hath no cauſe to complaine of the iniuſtice of Fortune, and where ſhe is more commodiouſly lodged,

then among Philoſophers; without going thence; you poſſeſſe whatſoeuer we deſire in our wiſhes▪ and what we imagine in our dreames. The dayes which to mee are ſo long, and whoſe each moment J reckon, paſle ouer ſwiftly at Villeſauin; nor can Riches annoy you in a ſociety capable to make euen pouerty pleaſing. What likelihood is it then, this being ſo, you ſhould be of your Letters opinion, and that you cannot be without me. It ſufficeth mee, you ſometimes haue me in your thoughts, as thoſe in Heauen behold what they left on Earth: and that you receiue the votes and prayers I ſhall hereafter addreſſe vnto you, after the ſolemne proteſtation I am about to make, to remayne whilſt I liue,
