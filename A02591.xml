            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               MY Text (you heare) is
of Iuſtice and peace,
two royall graces; and
ſuch as flow from ſoueraigne
Maieſty: There is a double

Iuſtice, Diuine and humane;
there is a double peace, outward
in the ſtate, inward in the ſoule:
Accordingly, there is a double
ſenſe of my Text; a ſpirituall, a
ciuill ſenſe: The ſpirituall concerning
Theologicall Iuſtice, and
inward peace; The ciuill concerning
humane Iuſtice and outward
peace. The ſpirituall thus; The
Meſſias ſhall cauſe the fruit of his
perfect iuſtice to be our inward
peace with God, and our ſelues.
The ciuill thus; The Magiſtrate
ſhall cauſe the worke of ciuill Iuſtice
in his adminiſtration, to be
our outward peace with one another:
In both, or either (as Muſculus
well) there is an alluſion in
the Hebrew word to a field; the
ſoile is the heart or the State, the

ſeed is Iuſtice, the fruit peace: That
which was waſte ground is now a
Carmell, a fruitfull field; and the
fruit of this field of Iuſtice is peace.
            As there is good reaſon, we will
beginne with the ſpirituall Iuſtice
and Peace.
            
            The great King of Heauen will
disforeſt that peece of the world,
which he calls his Church, and put
it to tillage; it ſhall bee ſowne
with righteouſneſſe, and ſhal yeeld
a ſweet crop of peace: in this only,
not in the barren heaths of the prophane
world ſhall true peace grow.
            At firſt, God and man were
good friends: How ſhould there
be other than good termes betwixt
Heauen and Paradiſe? God made
man iuſt; and iuſt man (whiles he
was ſo) could not chuſe but loue

the iuſt God that made him; ſinne
ſet them at odds; in one act and
inſtant did man leeſe both his iuſtice
and peace; now the world is
changed; now the ſtile of God is
Fortis vltor,
               God the auenger. The ſonnes of wrath. God the auenger, Ier.
51. 56. and the ſtile of men▪ 
               Filij
irae, ſonnes of wrath, Epheſ. 2. 3.
There is no poſſible peace to bee
made betwixt God and man, but
by the perfect Iuſtice of him that
was both God and man: I would
there were a peace in the Church
about this Iuſtice; It is pitie and
ſhame there is not; but there muſt
be hereſies: As there are two parts
of Diuinity, the Law and the Goſpell;
ſo each of theſe haue their
Iuſtice; there is a iuſtice of the
Law, and an Euangelicall Iuſtice▪
The Iuſtice of the Law when a

meere morall man is iuſtified (out
of his owne powers) by the works
of the Law; very Papiſts will giue
ſo much way to S. Paul, ſo much
affront to Pelagius, as to renounce
this; freely anathematizing that
man who by the ſtrength of humane
nature, or the doctrine of the
Law, ſhall challenge iuſtification;
Vnleſſe perhaps ſome Andradius
haue priuilege to teach, that this
Ethica Iuſtitia,
               Morall righteouſneſſe. was enough to iuſtifie
and ſaue the old Philoſophers.
            The Euangelicall Iuſtice is not
without the interuention of a Sauiour▪
To which claime is laid in
two kindes, either as imputatiue,
or as inherent; The inherent
wrought in vs: the imputed
wrought for vs. How eaſie were
it to lead you through a thicke of

diſtinctions into a large field of
controuerſie, concerning the nature,
meanes, manner of our Iuſtification?
No head in all Diuinity
yeelds either more, or more important
Problems▪ In ſo much as
Cardinall De Monte, Vice-Preſident
for the time of the Councell
of Trent, in an Oration made by
him in the eleuenth ſeſſion, profeſſes,
that when they meant to diſpatch
their Decree concerning Iuſtification
in fifteene daies, it coſt
them ſeuen moneths to finiſh,
without one daies intermiſſion;
and when all is done, they haue
left the world, which was before
(as Pighius ingenuouſly) intricated
by the thorny queſtions of
Schoolemen, rather more vnſatiſfied
&amp; perplexed than they found

it. It is the maine care of our liues,
and deaths, what ſhall giue vs peace
and acceptation before the dreadfull
Tribunall of God: What, but
righteouſneſſe? What righteouſneſſe,
or whoſe? Ours, or Chriſts?
Ours, in the inherent graces
wrought in vs, in the holy workes
wrought by vs; or Chriſts, in his
moſt perfect obedience, and meritorious
ſatisfaction wrought for
vs, applied to vs. The Tridentine
faction is for the former;
wee are for the latter; God is as
direct on our ſide as his Word
can make him; Euery where
blazoning the defects of our
owne righteouſneſſe, the imperfections
of our beſt Graces, the
deadly nature of our leaſt ſinnes;
the radicall ſinfulneſſe of our habituall

concupiſcence, the pollution
of our beſt workes: Euery
where extolling the perfect obedience
of our Redeemer, the gracious
application of that obedience, the
ſweet comfort of that application,
the aſſurance and vnfailableneſſe
of that comfort: and laſtly, our
happy reſt in that aſſurance. I inſtance
not; open the Booke, ſee
where your eies can looke beſide
theſe▪ 
               Satis aperti (ſaith their Caſſander)
The Scripture is cleare
ours, So is all antiquity, if they beleeue
that learned Arbiter; So are
their more ingenuous Doctors of
the laſt age; So would they all be,
if they had grace to know God,
themſelues, grace, ſinne, heauen,
hell; God perfectly iuſt, themſelues
miſerably weake, Grace ſenſibly

imperfect, ſinne vnmeaſurably
ſinfull; Laſtly, if they knew
that heauen is for none but the
pure, that hell is for the preſumptuous.
O Sauiour, no man is iuſt
through thee, but he that is ſanctified
by thee; What is our inherent
juſtice, but ſanctity? That we aſpire
towards, we attaine not to; Woe
were vs if we were not more iuſt
in thee, than ſanctified in our
ſelues; we are ſanctified, in part,
according to the weakneſſe of our
receit; we are iuſtified thorowly▪
according to the perfection of
thine acceptation; were we fully
ſanctified here, we ſhould be more
than men; were we not thorowly
iuſtified, wee ſhould be no more
than ſinners before thee; whiles
we ſtand before thee as ſinners, we

can haue no peace; Let others truſt
in the Charets and Horſes of their
owne ſtrength, we will remember
the Name of the Lord our God;
The worke of thy Iuſtice ſhall be our
peace.
            
            Peace is a ſweet word; Euery
body would be glad of it; eſpecially
Peace at the laſt, as the Pſalmiſt
ſpeakes: How haue the politickly
religious held out twigs for
the drowning ſoule to catch at?
Due ſatisfactions, vndue ſupererogations,
patronages of Saints,
bargaines of Indulgences, woollward
pilgrimages, and at laſt (after
whips and haire-clothes)
leaue the dying ſoule to a feare of
Hell, doubt of Heauen, aſſurance
of Purgatory flames; How truly
may it now ſay to theſe Doctors,

as Iob to his friends, Miſerable
comforters are yee all; Hearken,
O yee deare Chriſtians, to a better
voice that ſounds from heauen;
Come to me all yee that labour,
               Mat. 11. 28. 
               and
are heauy laden, and I will giue
you reſt.
            
            Is there any of you whoſe vnquiet
breaſt boiles continually
with the conſcience of any foule
ſinne? whoſe heart is daily tyr'd
vpon by the vultur of his ſecret
guiltineſſe? whoſe boſome is
gnawed before-hand with that helliſh
Worme, which can no more
giue ouer than die? It boots not to
aske thee if thou wouldſt haue
peace.Micah. 6. Peace? Rather than life; Oh
wherewithall ſhall I come before
the Lord, and bow my ſelfe before
the moſt high God? Shall I come

before him with burnt offerings?
Will the Lord be pleaſed with thouſands
of Rammes, or with tenne
thouſand Riuers of Oyle? Shall
I giue my firſt borne for my tranſgreſsion,
the fruit of my body for
the ſinne of my ſoule? Heare, O
thou diſtracted heart; what talkeſt
thou of giuing to the owner? The
world is his; thou art not thine
owne; Yea, were theſe things
thine, and not his, yet know, it is
not giuing, but taking that muſt
procure thy peace: An infinite Iuſtice
is offended; an infinite Iuſtice
hath ſatisfied, an infinite mercy
hath applied it; Take thou hold
by the hand of faith on that infinite
mercy, and juſtice of thy Sauiour;
The worke of his Iuſtice
ſhall be thy peace.
            
               
Fly about whither thou wilt, O
thou weary Doue, thorow all the
wide Regions of the heauen, and
waters, thou ſhalt no where finde
reſt for the ſoles of thy feet, but in
this Arke of Chriſts perfect righteouſneſſe:
In vaine ſhalt thou
ſeeke it in ſchooles of morality, in
learned Libraries, in ſpacious fields
and forreſts, in pleaſant gardens,
in ſullen retiredneſſe, in witty conuerſation,
in wanton Theaters,
in drunken cellers, in tables of
gluttony, in beds of luſt, cheſts of
Mammon, whiffes and draughts of
intoxication, ſongs of ribaldry,
ſports of recreation; No, no, the
more thou ſeekeſt it in moſt of
theſe, the further it flies from thee,
the further thou art from finding
it; and if theſe things may giue

ſome poore truce to thy thoughts,
it ſhall ſoone end in a more direfull
warre. There is no peace, ſaith
my God, to the wicked: Stray whither
thou wilt, O thou wounded
heart, thorow the Lawnds and
Woods; alas, the ſhaft ſticks ſtill
in thee, or if that bee ſhaken out,
the head; None but the ſoueraigne
Dittany of thy Sauiours righteouſneſſe
can driue it out; and till it
be out, thou canſt haue no peace.
In plaine termes; wouldſt thou
haue peace? None but Chriſt can
giue it thee; He will giue it to none
but the penitent, none but the
faithfull; Oh ſpend thy ſelfe into
the ſighes and teares of true repentance;
and then raiſe thy humbled
ſoule to a liuely confidence in
thine all-ſufficient Redeemer; Set

thy Lord Ieſus betwixt God and
thy ſinnes; God cannot ſee thy
debt, but through thine acquittance;
By his ſtripes we are healed,
by his wounds we are ſtanched,
by his death we are quickned, by
his righteouſneſſe we are diſcharged;
The worke of his righteouſneſſe
is our peace. Oh ſafe and bleſſed
condition of beleeuers; Let
ſinne, Satan, world, death, hell,
doe their worſt;Rom. 8. 33. 
               Who ſhall lay any
thing to the charge of Gods elect;
It is God that iuſtifieth: who ſhall
condemne? It is Chriſt that died, yea
rather, that is riſen againe; who is alſo
at the right hand of God, and maketh
interceſsion for vs: Our enemy
is now our Father, our Iudge is
our Sauiour, the offended our
ſurety, that precious bloud our
ranſome, that perfect righteouſneſſe

our euerlaſting peace.
            Thus much of our ſpirituall
Iuſtice, and Peace. The Ciuill followes:
I know theſe two are
wide termes; Iuſtice compriſes
all vertue, as Peace all bleſſings;
For that is iuſt in all kinds, which
hath a meet adequation to the rule;
All vertue therefore conforming
vs to the law of God, which is the
rule of perfection, challengeth
iuſtly to it ſelfe a ſtile of juſtice.
            Narrower bounds will ſerue our
turne: We ſpeake of Iuſtice firſt as
a ſingle vertue. Habits are diſtinguiſhed
by their acts; acts by their
obiects. The obiect of all morall
vertue is good, as of all intellectuall,
is True. The obiect of this vertue
of Iuſtice is the good of men in
relation to each other; Other vertues
order a man in regard to himſelfe;

Iuſtice, in regard to another.
This good being either common,
or priuate; common of all, priuate
of ſome; the acts and vertue of Iuſtice
muſt bee ſutable; Either, as
man ſtands in an habitude to the
whole body; or as he ſtands to
ſpeciall limbs of the body: The
former of theſe is that which
Philoſophers and Caſuiſts call a legall
and vniuerſall Iuſtice. The latter
is that particular Iuſtice, which
we vſe to diſtinguiſh by Diſtribution,
and Commutation; the one conſiſting
in matter of Commerce, the
other in Reward, or Puniſhment;
both of them according to a meet,
though different, equality: An
Arithmeticall equality in Commutation;
a Geometricall in diſtribution;
the former regarding
the value, or worth of the thing,

the latter, regarding the proportionable
difference of the perſon.
The worke of all theſe three Iuſtices,
is Peace.
            Firſt, the legall Iuſtice is the apparent
mother and nurſe of publique
Peace: When Gouernors and ſubiects
are carefull to giue each other
their owne; when both conſpire
to command and obey for the
common good; when men frame
their liues to the wholſome lawes
of their Soueraignes, not more out
of feare than conſcience; when reſpect
to the community caries men
from partiall reflections vpon thē
               ſelues;
As contrarily diſtractions,
and priuate ends are the bane of any
ſtate. When the head and members
vnite their thoughts and endeuours
in the center of the common
good: the head to deuiſe and

command, the eies to ſee, the eare
to heare, the palate to taſte, the
heart to moue, the bellowes of the
lungs to blow, the liuer to ſanguifie,
the ſtomach to digeſt, the guts
to export, the hands to execute, the
tongue to talke for the good of
this naturall Common-wealth of
the body, all goes well and happily;
but if any of theſe parts will be
gathering to themſelues, and obſtructions
grow within; and mutinous
diſtempers ariſe in the humors,
ruine is threatned to the
whole: If either the Superiors miſcommand,
or the inferiors diſobey,
it is an affront to Peace. I need not
tell you that good lawes are the
walls of the Citie, the ſinewes of
the politicke body, the rule of our
life, the life of our ſtate, without
which men would turne brute, yea

monſtrous; the world were a Chaos,
yea an hell. It is wiſdome that
makes lawes, it is Iuſtice that keeps
them; Oh let this Iuſtice ſtill bleſſe
vs with a perpetuall peace; as thoſe
that doe not thinke the world
made for vs, but our ſelues made
for the world, let vs driue at an
vniuerſall good; let there be euer
that ſweet correſpondence betwixt
Soueraignty and ſubiection, that
the one may be happy in the other,
both in peace.
            Secondly, the diſtributiue Iuſtice
is not leſſe fruitfull of peace; when
rewards of honors, &amp; gracious reſpects
are ſuited to the well-deſeruing;
when malefactors ſmart according
to their crimes; This Iuſtice
hath ſtocks for the vagrant,
whips for harlots, brands for pettylarzons,
ropes for fellons, weights

for the contumaciouſly ſilent,
ſtakes for blaſphemous hereticks,
gibbets for murtherers, the hurdle,
and the knife, and the pole for traitors;
and vpon all theſe engines of
Iuſtice hangs the garland of peace.
It was not for nothing that Maximilian
the firſt, paſſing by the gallowes,
ſaluted it with Salue Iuſtitia.
Ye neuer ſee Iuſtice painted without
a ſword; when that ſword
glitters with vſe, it is well with the
publique, woe be to the Nation
where it ruſts. There can bee no
more acceptable ſacrifice than the
bloud of the flagitious. Immediatly
after Garnets execution, Father
Dauid at Ypre; in a publike Sermon
declared the miracles ſhowne
thereat; Amongſt the reſt, that a
ſpring of oyle brake forth ſuddenly
in the place where that Saint

was martyred; Inſtead of a lie, let
it be a parable; The bloud of Traitors
ſhed by the ſword of Iuſtice,
is a well of oyle to fatten, and refreſh
the Common-wealth.
            I know well how mercy befits
the mouths of Gods Miniſters:
The ſoft tongue of a Diuine is no
meet whetſtone for the edge of
ſeueritie; but withall, I dare ſay,
that Iuſtice is a noble worke of
mercy; neither need we wiſh to be
more charitable, than the God of
mercy that ſaies, Thine eie ſhall not
ſpare the murtherer, Numb. 35. 31.
The Tempter to idolatry, Deut. 13. 6.
The very ſonnes of Leui were appointed
to win an euerlaſting bleſſing,
by conſecrating their hands
to God in Iſraelitiſh bloud: The
vniuſt fauour, and plauſibilitie of
Romiſh Doctors, towards capitall

offenders, hath made their Sanctuaries
(euen literally) a denne of
theeues, an harbour of villany. It
is memorable of Lewis of France,
(ſtiled the Saint) that he reuerſed a
pardon wrought from him to a
malefactor; vpon reading that verſe
in the Pſalme,
               Pſal. 106. 3. 
               Beati qui faciunt iuſtitiam
in omni tempore; Bleſſed are
they that doe iuſtice at all times: No
maruell if one of thoſe foure
things which Iſabell of Spaine was
wont to ſay, ſhe loued to ſee; were,
A Theefe vpon the ladder; Euen
through his halter might ſhe ſee
the proſpect of peace. Woe bee
to them that either for gaine or
priuate intereſt ingage themſelues
in the ſuit of fauour to maliciouſly
bloudy hands; that, by the dam of
their bribes labour to ſtop the due
courſe of punitiue Iuſtice; theſe,

theſe are the enemies of peace;
theſe ſtaine the land with that
Crimſon die, that cannot be waſhed
out but by many wofull lauers
of reuenge: Farre, farre be it from
any of you, generous Chriſtians,
to endeuour either to corrupt, or
interrupt the waies of iudgement,
or for a priuate benefit to croſſe the
publique peace: Woe be to thoſe
partiall Iudges, that iuſtifie the
wicked, and condemne the innocent;
the girdle of whoſe equitie
ſaggs downe on that ſide where
the purſe hangs: Laſtly, woe to
thoſe vnworthy ones that raiſe
themſelues by fraud, bribes, ſymony,
ſacrilege; therefore are theſe
enemies to the ſtate, becauſe to
peace; and therefore enemies to
peace, becauſe violaters of juſtice,
And the worke of Iuſtice is peace.
            
            
               
Thirdly, that commutatiue Iuſtice
workes peace; needs no other
proofe than that all the reall brabbles
and ſuits amongſt men, ariſe
from either true or pretended iniuſtice
of contracts. Let me lead you
in a tearme morning to the ſpacious
Hall of Iuſtice: What is the
cauſe of all that concourſe? that
Hiue-like murmur? that noiſe at
the barre, but iniurious bargaines,
fraudulent conueyances, falſe titles,
diſappointment of truſts,
wrongfull detruſions of money,
goods, lands, couzenages, oppreſſions,
extortions: Could the honeſty
and priuate Iuſtice of men
preuent theſe enormities, ſilence
and ſolitude would dwell in that
wide Palace of Iuſtice; neither
would there bee more Pleas than
Cob-webs vnder that vaſt roofe.

Euery way therefore it is cleere,
that the worke of Iuſtice is peace;
In ſo much as the Guardians of
peace are called Iuſticers.
            This for the Common-wealth;
If it pleaſe you to caſt your eies
vpon her Siſter the Church, you
ſhall finde that the outward peace
thereof alſo muſt ariſe from Iuſtice.
Alas; thence is our hopeleſneſſe:
Neuer may they proſper
that loue not, that wiſh not
peace within thoſe ſacred walls;
but what poſſibility of peace in the
peremptory repulſes of Iuſtice?
What poſſibility of Iuſtice in the
long vſurped tyranny of the ſucceſſor
of Romulus? Could we hope
to ſee Iuſtice once ſhine from
thoſe ſeuen hills, we would make
account of peace; but, oh, the
miſerable iniuſtice of that imperious

Sea; Iniuſtice of claime, iniuſtice
of practice. Of claime, ouer
Kings, Church, Scriptures, Conſcience:
Ouer Kings; there is S. Pauls
ſuper-exalted (
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ;) His vſuall
title is Orbis Dominus;
               Lord of the world. 
               Dominus vniuerſorum
in the mouthes &amp; pens
of his flatterers: And leſt Princes
ſhould ſeeme exempted; He is Rex
Regum,
               Ouer Emperours and Kings. as Paulus 4. ſaies of himſelfe;
he is ſuper Imperatores &amp; reges,
ſaith their Antoninus, Triumphus,
Capiſtranus, and who not?
How much? you know the calculation
of the magnitude of the two
great lights: How ouer them? As
the maſter ouer the ſeruant; they
are the words of their Pope Nicholas;
               Whence but from vs?
The Imperiall throne is vnde
niſi à nobis, ſaith Pope Adrian:
What ſhould I tel you of his bridle,
ſtirrup, toe, cup, canopie? Let the

booke of holy Ceremonies ſay the
reſt; Theſe things are ſtale, The
world hath long ſeene &amp; bluſhed.
            Ouer the Church; There is
challenged a proper head-ſhip
from whom all influences of life,
ſenſe, motion come; as their Bozius;
why ſaid I ouer? Hee is vnder
the Church: For he is the foundation
of the Church ſaith Bellarmine;
Ouer as the head, vnder as
the foundation? What can Chriſt
be more? Thence, where are generall
councells but vnder him as
the ſtreame of Ieſuites; Who but
he is, regulafidei, as their Andradius:
he alone hath infallibility &amp; indefectibility,In decrees of faith or precepts of manners.
whether in decretis fidei,
or in praeceptis morum, as Bellarmine.
Hee hath power to make new
Creeds, and to obtrude them to the
Church; the deniall whereof was

one of thoſe Articles which Leo
the tenth condemned in Luther.
            
            
               Ouer Scriptures. There is claimed
a power to authorize them
for ſuch; A power to interpret
them, ſententialiter &amp; Obligatoriè,
being ſuch; A power to diſpenſe
with them, ex causâ, though ſuch.
            Ouer the conſciences of men;
In diſpenſing with their oathes, in
allowance of their ſinnes. It is one
head of their Canon Law,He abſolues from the oath of Allegeance. 
               A Iuramento
fidelitatis abſoluit, Decret. p. 2.
Cauſ. 15. qu. 6. And in euery oath
is vnderſtood a reſeruation and
exception of the Popes power, ſay
his Paraſites.
            I am aſhamed to tell, and you
would bluſh to heare of the diſpenſation
reported to be granted
by Sixtus 4. to the family of the
Cardinall of Saint Lucie; and by

               Alexander 6. to Peter Mendoza
Cardinall of Valentia.
            
            And as there is horrible iniuſtice
in theſe claimes; ſo is there no leſſe
in practiſe. Take a taſte for all:
What can be more vniuſt than to
caſt out of the lap of the Church
thoſe that oppoſe their nouelties,
to condemne them to the ſtake, to
hell for Heretikes. What more vniuſt
than to falſifie the writings
of ancient, or moderne authors
by ſecret expurgations by wilfull
miſ-editions? what more vniuſt
than the with holding the remedy
of generall Councels, and tranſacting
all the affaires of the
Church by a pack't Conclaue?
What more vniuſt than the ſuppreſſion
of the Scriptures, and mutilation
of the Sacrament to the
Laity. What more vniuſt than allowance

of equiuocation; than
vpholding a faction by willing
falſhood of rumors, than plotting
the ſubuerſion of King and ſtate
by vnnaturall conſpiracies? Well
may we call heauen and earth to
record againſt the iniuſtice of
theſe claimes, of theſe practiſes.
What then? Is it to hope for peace,
notwithſtanding the continuance
of all theſe? So the worke of Iniuſtice
ſhall be peace: And an vniuſt
and vnſound peace muſt it needs
be that ariſes from Iniuſtice; Is it
to hope they will abandon theſe
things for Peace? Oh that the
Church of God might once be ſo
happy: That there were but any
life in that poſſibilitie; In the
meane time, let God and his holy
Angels witneſſe betwixt vs, that
on their part the peace faileth; we

are guiltleſſe: What haue we done?
What haue wee attempted? what
haue we innouated? Onely wee
haue ſtood vpon a iuſt and modeſt
negatiue, and haue vniuſtly ſuffered.
Oh that all the innocent
bloud wee haue ſhed could waſh
their hands from Iniuſtice, from
enmity to Peace.
            That from them wee may returne
to our ſelues; For the publique,
wee enioy an happy Peace;
Bleſſed be God for Iuſtice: and if
in this common harmony of
Peace, there be found ſome priuate
iarres of diſcord, whence is it but
from our owne Iniuſtice? The
world is of another minde; whoſe
wont is to cenſure him that puniſhes
the fault, not him that makes
it; Seuerity, not guiltineſſe in common
opinion, breakes the peace▪
               
Let the queſtion bee who is the
great make-bate of the world; begin
with the family: Who troubles
the houſe?The like diſcourſe to this ye ſhall finde in Conrad. Schluſſelburgius in his preface to his 13
                     th. booke Catal. Haeret.
                Not vnruly, head ſtrong,
debaucht, children, that are ready
to throw the houſe out of the
windowes, but the nuſtere father,
that reproues, that corrects them;
would he winke at their diſorders,
all would be quiet. Not careleſſe,
ſloathfull, falſe, lime-fingred ſeruants,
but the ſtrict maſter, that obſerues
and rates, and chaſtiſes
them; would he hold his hands,
and tongue, there would bee
peace.
            Not the peeuiſh and turbulent
wife, who forgetting the ribbe,
vſurps vpon the head, but the reſolute
husband, that hates to leeſſe
his authority in his loue; remembring
that though the ribbe bee

neare the heart, yet the head is aboue
the ſhoulders; Would he fall
from the termes of his honour,
there would be peace.
            In the Country, not the oppreſſing
Gentleman, that tyrannizes
ouer his Cottagers, incroches vpon
his neighbours inheritance, incloſes
commons, depopulates villages,
ſcruzes his Tenants to
death, but the poore ſoules that
when they are cruſhed, yeeld the
iuyce of teares, exhibit bils of
complaint, throw open the new
thornes, maintaine the old
mounds; would theſe men bee
content to be quietly racked, and
ſpoyled, there would be peace.
            In the City; not the impure Sodomitiſh
brothels, that ſell themſelues
to worke wickedneſſe; not
the abominable Pandars, not the

iugling cheater, not the counterfeit
Vagrant, but the Marſhall that
drawes theſe to correction; Not
the deceitfull Merchant that ſophiſticates
his commodities, inhanceth
prices, ſells euery inch of
(what he cannot warrant) Time;
Not the vnconſcionable and fraudulent
Artiſan, but the promoter
and the Bench.
            In the Common-wealth, not the
cruell robber by ſea or land, that
lies in the way, like a ſpider in a
window, for a booty, for bloud:
Not the bold night-walker that
keepes ſauage houres fit for the
guiltie intentions of his burglaries,
but the watch that takes him;
Not the rank adulterer that neighs
after his neighbours wife, and
thirſts after only ſtolne waters,
but the ſworne men that preſent

him. Not the trayterous Coyner,
that in euery ſtampe reades his
owne conuiction, whiles hee ſtill
renewes that face againſt which
hee offends, but the Sheriffe that
attaches him.
            Not the vnreformable drunkard,
that makes a God of his liquor,
a beaſt of himſelfe, and
raues, and ſwaggers in his cups,
but the Conſtable that puniſhes
him; would theſe officers conniue
at all theſe villanies, there would
be peace.
            In the Church, not the chaffering
Patron, or periured chaplaine;
not the ſeducing hereticke, or ſeditious
ſchiſmatike; not the ſcandalous
Leuite, not the careleſſe
queſtman, not the corrupt Officiall,
but the clamorous Preacher, or
the rigorous High-Commiſſion.

In the world, laſtly, Not the ambitious
incrochers vpon others
dominions, not violaters of
leagues, not vſurpers of miſ-gotten
titles and dignities, not ſuborners,
or abettors of conſpiracies, and
traitors, but the vnkinde patients
that will not recipere ferrum:
I wis the great Potentates of the
world might ſee a ready way to
Peace.
            Thus in family, countrey, citie,
commonwealth, Church, world,
the greateſt part ſeeke a licentious
peace in a diſordered lawleſſeneſſe;
condemning true iuſtice of
cruelty▪ ſtripping her of the honour
of peace, branding her with
the cenſure of troubleſome. Fooliſh
men ſpeake fooliſh things: Oh
noble and incomparable bleſſing
of peace, how iniuriouſly art thou

aſcribed to vniuſt neglect? Oh
diuine Vertue of Iuſtice, how deſeruedly
haue the Ancients giuen
thee wings, and ſent thee vp to
heauen in a deteſtation of theſe
earthly indignities; whence thou
comſt not downe at all, vnleſſe it
pleaſe that eſſentiall and infinite
Iuſtice to communicate thee to
ſome choyce fauourites. It is but
a iuſt word, that this Iland hath
beene long approued the darling
of heauen; We haue enioyed peace,
to the admiration, to the enuie of
neighbourhood: Would we continue
it? would we traduce it to
ours? Iuſtice muſt doe it for vs.
Both Iuſtice, and Peace, are from
the throne; Peace is the Kings
Peace; and Iuſtice deſcends from
Soueraignty by commiſſion; Let
me haue leaue to ſay with the

princely Prophet (a word that was
too good for the frequent text of
a Pope) Diligite iuſtitiam qui iudicatis
terram. Still, ô God, giue
thy iudgements to the King, and
thy Iuſtice to the Kings ſonne.
And if any ſhall offer wrong to
the Lords anointed in his perſon,
in his ſeed, the worke of that iniuſtice
ſhall be war; yea Bellum Domini,
the Lords war, (2 Sam. 25. 28)
Then let him who is both the
Lord of Hoſts, and the God of
peace, riſe vp mightily for his anointed,
the true King of Peace;
that he who hath graciouſly ſaid
all this while, Da pacem, Domine,
Giue peace in our time, O Lord,
may ſuperſcribe at the laſt his iuſt
Trophees, with, Bleſſed bee the
Lord which teacheth my hands to
warre, and my fingers to fight.
            
            
               
Ye haue heard of the ſpirituall
Iuſtice and Peace; Yee haue heard
of the Ciuill; may it pleaſe you
to mix both of them together:
My text alone doth it; if you doe
but with our moſt accurate
Tranſlation, reade Righteouſneſſe
for Iuſtice; So ſhall you ſee the
ſpirituall diſpoſition of Righteouſneſſe
produce the ciuill effect of
Peace, What is Righteouſneſſe, but
the ſincere vprightnes of the heart
to God in all our waies: He is perfect
with God, that would be ſo:
            What need I tell you that this
is the way to true inward peace,
Nil conſcire,
               Not to bee guilty of ill. A cleare heart will be
a quiet one. There is no feaſt to a
good conſcience; this is meat,
muſicke, welcome; It ſeemes harder
that true ſpirituall honeſty
ſhould procure euen outward

peace: Heare wiſe Salomon; By
the bleſsing of the vpright, the city
is exalted, Prou. 11. 11. When a
mans waies pleaſe the Lord, hee
maketh euen his enemies to bee at
peace with him, Prou. 16. 7. Righteouſneſſe
exalteth a nation, but ſin
is a reproach to any people, Prou. 14.
34. It followes then as a iuſt corollary,
That the honeſteſt, and conſcionableſt
man is the beſt ſubiect:
He may perhaps be plaine, perhaps
poore, perhaps weake, but the ſtate
is more beholden to his integrity,
than to the ableſt purſe, than
to the ſtrongeſt arme; Whereas
the graceleſſe, and vicious perſon,
let him be neuer ſo plauſible
a talker, neuer ſo carefull an Officer,
neuer ſo valiant a Leader, neuer
ſo officious a courtier, neuer ſo
deepe in ſubſidies, neuer ſo forward

in actions, is no other than
an enemy to the ſtate, which hee
profeſſes to adore.An ill man, a good ſubiect. Let no Philoſopher
tell me of, malus vir bonus ciuis;
I ſay from better authoritie,
that a lewd man can no more be a
good ſubiect, than an ill ſubiect
can bee a good man: Heare this
then (whereſoeuer ye are) ye ſecret
oppreſſors, ye profane ſcoffers,
yee foule-mouth'd ſwearers, yee
cloſe adulterers, ye kind drūkards,
and who euer come within this
blacke liſt of wickedneſſe, how
can ye be loyall, whiles you lodge
traytors in your boſomes? Proteſt
what ye will; your ſins breake the
peace, and conſpire againſt the ſacred
Crowne, and dignitie of your
Soueraigne; What care wee that
you draw your ſword, and
vow your bloud, and drinke

your healths to your Gouernours,
when in the meane while you prouoke
God to anger, and ſet quarrels
betwixt your Country and
Heauen?
            That I may winde vp this clew;
It were folly to commend to you
the worth of peace; we know that
the excellency of Princes is expreſſed
by ſerenity; what good hath
the earth which God doth not
couch vnder the name of Peace?
Bleſſed be God, and his Anointed,
we haue long and comfortably taſted
the ſweetneſſe of this bleſſing;
the Lilies and Lions of our Salomon
haue beene iuſtly worded
with Beati pacifici. Would we haue
this happineſſe perpetuated to vs,
to poſterity? Oh let Prince and
people meet in the ambition to be
Gens iuſta, a righteous nation, righteous

euery way; Firſt, let God haue
his owne; His owne daies, his
owne ſeruices; his feare, his loue,
his all: Let Religion leade all our
proiects, not follow them; let our
liues be led in a conſcionable obedience
to all the lawes of our
maker: Far bee all blaſphemies,
curſes, and obſcenities from our
tongues, all outrages and violences
from our hands; all preſumptuous
and rebellious thoughts
from our hearts. Let our hearts,
hands, tongues, liues, bodies and
ſoules be ſincerely deuoted to him.
Then, for men: let vs giue Caeſar
his owne: Tribute, feare, ſubiection,
loyalty, and (if hee need) our
liues; Let the nobility haue honour,
obciſance, obſeruation; Let
the Clergy haue their dues, and
our reuerence; Let the commons

haue truth, loue, fidelity in all
their tranſactions: Let there be trutinae iuſtae,
pondera iuſta:
               
                  Leu. 19. 36. Iuſt balances, iuſt weights. Let there
be no grinding of faces, no trampling
on the poore (Amos 5. 11.)
no ſwallowing of widdowes houſes,
no force, no fraud, no periury,
no perfidiouſneſſe.
            Finally, for our ſelues; let euery
man poſſeſſe his veſſell in holineſſe
and honour; framing himſelfe
to all Chriſtian and heauenly
temper, in all wiſdome, ſobriety,
chaſtity, meekneſſe, conſtancy,
moderation, patience, and ſweet
contentation: ſo ſhall the worke of
our righteouſneſſe bee peace of
heart, peace of ſtate; priuate and
publike peace; Peace with our
ſelues, peace with the world, peace
with God; temporall peace here,
eternall peace and glory aboue:

vnto the fruition whereof, he who
hath ordained vs, mercifully bring
vs for the ſake of him, who is the
Prince of Peace, Ieſus Chriſt the
righteous.
            FINIS.
