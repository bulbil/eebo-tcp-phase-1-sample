            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

                  MAy it like your good Lordſhip. The renowmed ſentence of diuine Plato, ſo oft celebrated in Dedication of Bookes to Princies, and great perſonages: wherein he affirmeth, that thoſe States doofloriſh, where Kinges be Philoſophers, or Philoſophers be Kinges: ſeemeth not ſo ſound to ſome, that are profeſſours of the Doctrine of the ſame Plato. For they that are occupied in publique affaires, be wont to leaue the ſtudies of learning, becauſe the life, full of buſines, taketh awaye the leyſure of the learned. And the nearer we approche to Iupiter, who is Lord of gouernment, the further we ſtraye from

               Mercurie, who is Prince of learning.

            To this, an aunſwer is made by Plotinus, who is the firſt Philoſopher that is ſpoken of in this worke. That the minde of mā is more mightier, then the nature of the Heauens and earth, and ſo bringeth to paſſe, that the one dooth not promiſe, nor the other permit.

They haue beene accoumpted to be Philoſophers, that ſtudieth to know the cauſies of diuine &amp; humaine things, to teache and follow the way of good life, of the which they were called Maiſters of vertue, &amp; Diuines of the earth: who, as ſacred Miniſters ſhould ſpeake and doo nothing, but that ſhould tend to godlines.

               ¶ To the moſte gracious and mightye Elizabeth, of Englande, Fraunce and Irelande, Queene.
            
            
               THe ſaying of Plato, is commonly ſpoken, and vſed in euery mans mouthe: and yet I doubt, if it be of euery man, ſo well vnderſtanded, (moſte Gracious Queene:) that kingdomes are happy, where, either Princies be Philoſophers, and geuen to Learning, or Sapient and learned men, doo gouerne Kingdomes. The which ſaying, containeth more inwardlie, then it ſheweth outwardly, as I thinke. For whereas Plato, the fowntaine of Wiſdom, doth propound, Plato. two officies and chargies of Philoſophie, that is, to know diuine things, and to gouerne humaine matters: he ment, that then, Commonwealthes, and Kingdomes, ſhould be happy &amp; bleſſed, when Princes ſhould haue the knowledge of God &amp; heauēly things. And being inſtructed Pindarus, borne at Thebes, the which Cittie was ſpared of the Lacedemonians, and his ofſpring of Alexander, for his vertues ſake Diotimus. with that knowledge, would miniſter the law purely, ſtudy for the publike weale, &amp; keepe the people in obedience. Theſe be the two Anchores which the Thebane Poet thought meet to be caſt, to ſtay the ſhip, that is toſſed with the tempeſt. Theſe be the two Nurſes, which Antiquitie aſſigned to Iupiter, Ite, and Adraſtia. The one moderatrice of right, the other diſtributrice, of holy and iuſt. Diotimus thought theſe to be neceſſary miniſtracies, to the gouernment,

and preſeruation of kingdomes. Iuſtinian the Iuſtinianus. Emperour being inſtructed by great plenty of learned men, knew none other Philoſophy, when he comprehended the prudence of the law, within the compaſſe of her barres, and affirmed it was the knowledge of diuine and humaine thinges. This Philoſophy, the moſte learned Poet, ioyneth together, in Anio, whome, when, he maketh both a King and a Prieſte, by the example of the 
                  King Anius, bothe a Prince of 
                        •

               Agis, King of Lacedemonia, after his noble actes, was kylled in Priſon, becauſe he would haue renued Lycurgus his Lawes▪
                  
                Kinge of Lacedaemonia, who ſayd that a Kinge might gouerne his Realme, without force of armes, if he woulde gouerne his Subiects, as a Father dooth his Children: in as much, as by the diuine artes of peace, you adorne, enritche, (and that I may vſe the ſacred worde) you do ſanctifye your moſt floriſhing Kingdome. Hereof it is, that among the chiefe ornamentes of this world, you are accompted the onely Queene, and exalted with moſte exceeding praiſe: Plato, the Prince of witte, and fountaine of pure Philoſophie, did thinke, that to proper names, their was a certaine diuine ſtrength, agreeable to nature, and that moſte truelye: For what name coulde

more aptlye be giuen, to the nature of your Maieſtie, then that which ſhe hath: as in the which dooth ſhine a moſt certaine and vndoubted teſtimony of God, euen that ſame, which the word ſignifieth with the Hebrewes that is, An holeſome and ſweete ſtudie of peace, a friend of Heauen, comming from none other place, but from Heauen: engrafted to you in your byrth, to the which, ſtreight from the Cradell, ſucceeded the helpe of ſinguler and rare learning, as a ſeaſoning of the minde, and a quiet Repoſe of Muſies adhibited: with the which, naturall eloquence, the companion of peace, did ſo growe, and plentifullye encreaſe, and is ſo great in diuerſe tongues, as the greateſt learned Embaſſadours of Princes, be aſtoniſhed and amaſed at it: And I am of opinion, that in a Royall race, nothing can be procured, or wiſhed, more ample, glorious and excellent, then theſe your two ornaments: that is, teſtimonies of God, chiefly in this troubleſome tempeſt of ſtates: By theſe two gardes I thinke, that kingdoms are beſt and moſt ſurely defended: that is, by peace and by eloquence, which maketh mindes to agree. But why doo I (moſte gracious Queene) ſtay in your praiſe, the which the more I extoll, the more I diminiſh.
            But becauſe I ſee the Dedications of bookes, by a receiued and cōfirmed maner, commonly to be directed to Princely perſons, for two cauſes▪ eyther to get and deſerue thanke of ſuche as they be, or to prouide an helpe againſte enme, and poyſoned tongues of ſlaunderers. Of the which, the firſt conſideratiō, ſeemeth to proceede from God, to whom, antiquitie, as it is wel knowne, being mindeful and thankeful of their benifits, did offer the firſt fruits of their increaſe: The ſecōd, to riſe of preſeruatiues: of the which, great plentye was in great price, with men

of the olde time, whoſe mindes were light of beleefe, and poſſeſſed, againſt poyſonings and enchauntments: I being perſwaded, yea compelled by both wayes, haue preſented to your moſte gracious Maieſtie, Eunapius, an olde wrighter, (of whom I haue ſpoken at large in his life,) both that I might gaine you, by inuocation, to my vowe, with a reward, not great, but rare and of old money, the which now, cā abide the light, by the benefit of the Preſſe: and alſo, the mouthe of lewde detractours, (to vſe Catoes word,) that which thinkes nothing well done, might be ſtopped by the glory of your name. May it pleaſe your Maieſtie to accept this laboure, &amp; defend it, with a gratious mighty hand, and a cheerefull countenaunce, of a Straunger: but in time paſt, an inhabitour longe time of your kingdome, whom God, moſte good and mighty, long preſerue in ſafety, to your Realme, and to the Muſies of Learninge.

In that paſſage he was taken with a vehemēt ague, gotrē, as it ſhould ſeeme, by the toſſing of the Sea, which, in ſhort time, did ſo enfeeble and diminiſh the ſtrength of the young man, that not beeing able to go a foote, he was borne by the hands of his Countrimen, that came with him in the iorney, from Piraeo, the Porte of Athens, to Proaereſius houſe: whoſe fame brought him foorth.

Proaereſius, hearing the young man to be of great hope, did prayſe him openly, in a publike audience, and whiles he liued, vſed him as his deere Childe, and he likewiſe, honoured him as a God, with great reuerence for the admiration of his vertue, &amp; ſingular learning. He entred to the ſtate of man, (as himſelfe ſayth) when Iulianus was ſlaine in Parthia, and Valens and Valentinian, were Emperours.

At length being ouercome with the vehemencie of thoſe ſpeeches, it greeued him he had a body, and was mortall: he ſayled into Cicilia, by the rocke, Carybdis, where, they ſay, Viliſſes paſſed, but he could abide to ſee no Cittie, nor here mens voyces. So dyd he leaue delight and diſ

                  ſe and went to Lelibaeuin, 
                  Lelibaeuin. one of the three Forelands of Cicilia, towarde Affrica. There he lay in paine and paſſions, refuſing all meate, and forſaking all men.
               The great Plotinus was not deceyued herein, but eyther by following his ſteppes, or ſeeking for him, 
                     Plotinus, recouereth. Porphyrius.
                   found him out, where he was layde, and by good words, ſo comforted him, as he called againe the life, that was going from the body, and made it able to retaine the ſame. So as he recouered and was ſafe, and after, wrote the talke that was between them.
               But the ſecretes of Philoſophie, being hydden, as Poetry in Fables, Porphyrius, finding the remedy to make them manifeſt: with praiſe of his experience, dyd write a Treatiſe of them, and gaue lyght vnto them. Then he returned to Rome, and renewed his ſtudy, ſhewing proofe of it publiquely. The glory of Porphyrius, redounded to Plorinus, by whome, both the Senate and the people knew, he was enſtructed.
               
                  Plotinus ſeemed harde &amp; darke, for the diuine and obſcure ſubtiltie of his wordes and workes. But Porphyrius, as a Cheane of Mercury, ful of variety of learning, ſent amōg men, declared euery thing, firmly and plainly. For he ſayth in a place, which, paradventure)

he wrote when he was young, that he had Philoſophy by Oracles reuelation of more diuine knowledge, then the common ſort. And in the ſame booke he wryteth howe a man ſhould apply his diligence vpon ſuch matter. He ſaith further, that he droue a deuil out of a Bathe, whome the inhabitaunts called Cauſanthan. His Cauſanthan chiefe Scholefelowes, as himſelfe writeth, were Origenes, Amelius, and Aquilinus, and that they wrote Origenes. Amelius. Aquilinus. ſome Bookes, but their ſtyle was barren, though their precepts were good, &amp; aptly ſet forth in words. Yet Porphyrius prayſeth them for their grauitie, he receyuing all the thanks, and onely celebrating and ſetting forth his Maiſter, being endued with al kind of knowledge. A man may doubt and maruayle wherin he dyd moſt excell. Whether in the Arte of Rethorike, or exact knowledge of the groundes of Grammer, in the ſcience of numbring, or in Geometry or Muſicke. For Philoſophie, neyther left he any thing vnknowen, neyther coulde he well expreſſe what he knew. For natural and diuine knowledge, I leaue them to Religion and Miſteries. Such a generall knowledge had he in all manner of vertue, that a man may doubt, whether the pleaſantnes of his Orations, or the pithineſſe of his precepts, or the vehemencie of his ſpeaches, deſerueth more prayſe.
               It ſeemeth he was maried to Marcella, for there is a Booke directed to Marcella his wife: whome he ſayth, he maryed, being mother to liue Children, not to haue Chyldren by her, but to teach her Chyldren which ſhe had by a friend of his. It ſeemeth alſo he lyued tyll he was olde, wherby he left ſome workes contrary to his former wrytings. Of the which I can not iudge the cauſe, but that in tyme he thought

otherwyſe. They ſay he dyed at Rome, at which tyme, Paulus and Andromacus of Syria, were rectors Paulus. of Rethorike in Athens. And it is very lyke it was Andromacus. about the tyme of Galienus, Claudius, Tacitus, Aurelianus, and Probus. In whoſe dayes, Dexippus lyued, Dexippus. that wrote a ſtory of that tyme, a man fulfylled with all learning and good vertues.
            
            
               Jamblicus.
               
                  
                     NExt theſe, Iamblicus was the Philoſopher of moſt fame. He was of Iamblicus in Conſtantinus Magnus tyme. good byrth, from wealthy and fortunate Parents. His Countrey was Calcide, 
                  He aunſwered maruelouſly to many harde queſtions of Porphyrius.
                   which is a Citie of the hollow part of Syria. He was familiar with Anatolius, who, after Porphyrius, was moſt eſteemed, and paſſed him farre, and atteyned to the heyght of Philoſophy. After him he ioygned Anattolius. with Porphyrius, to whome he was not inferior, but in purity and pyth of ſtyle. For he dyd not vſe his ſpeach with ſweetnes &amp; delyght, nor had any clearenes, nor ioyed in neate phraſes. Yet was he not vtterly obſcure, nor faulty in his ſtyle, but as Plato ſayth of Xenocrates, he dyd not ſacrifice to the graces of Mercurie. Therfore he doth not deteyne his Auditor, X. nor allure him to reade, but rather affray him, and turneth him from it. For his keeping of Iuſtice he was ſo fauord of the Gods, as multitudes reſorted vnto him from euery place, to be partakers of his doctrine: of whome, who was the beſt, it is harde to tell.
               For there was Sopater of Syria, who was moſt eloquent in worde and wryting. Sopater.

He dyd lytle for him ſelfe without his Diſciples and fellowes, and that for a reſpect to God. He accompanied much with his friendes. His dyet was ſymple and alter the olde manner. He cheered his gueſts, and fylled them with his ſweete talkes. They that were not wery, nor full of his diſcourſes, were his common gueſts. They that durſt beſt ſpeake, would come foorth and ſaye. O moſt diuine Maiſter, why art thou ſo alone? Why doeſt thou not imparte thy rare Sapience to vs? A talke is tolde vs by thy ſeruaunts, that when thou art at thy prayers, thou art taken vp ten cubytes hygh, and that thy body and garment, is turned into colour of fayre golde. And when thy prayers are done, thy body returneth to his old eſtate, as it was before thou dyddeſt pray, and commeth to the groūd againe, and than thou l

                     Chryſanthius Schoolemaiſter to

               Furthermore, he ſhewed great demonſtration of his diuine knowledge, after this ſorte. The Sunne dyd ſhew vpon the extreme partes of the Orizon, when he entreth into the ſygne of the Dogge, at which tyme
                  
                  a Sacrifice was woont to be made in one of the Suburbs. And when all was well fyniſhed, they returned into the Cittie, going leyſurely, for they had a talke of God, agreeing with the Sacrifice.
               
               Than the voyce fayled, and he fyxing his eyes on the ground for a tyme: looked vpon his friends, and cryed to them. Let vs go another way: for a dead body is caryed not farre of. When he had thus ſayde, he tooke another way, as he thought, more pure. Some followed him, thynking it a ſhame to leaue their Maiſter. But the more part, and youthfull ſort, among whome was Aedeſius, thought it a ſuperſtitious poynt, and lyke Houndes that hunted after their game, went on their way.
               They had not gone farre, but they met with the buriers of the dead Corps, &amp; dyd not leaue it ſo, but aſked them if they went that way, they ſayde, they muſt needes, for there was none other. This dyd ye more teſtify his diuine knowledge, as there was no vſe of ſyght, but a ſecrete knowledge by odour. They would haue tryed it in a greater matter, but Iamblicus tolde them it was not in his power, but at tyme of opportunity.
               Not long after, it ſeemed good to them to go to Gadara, the ſeaſon ſeruing, to ye Bathe of Syria, in goodnes Gadara. next the Romaines Bathe of Baia, with ye which, Baia. no hote Bathe can compare. They vſe to go to Gadara yearely. And ſo being in the Bathe, &amp; they with him, reaſoning of ye ſame, Iamblicus ſmiling, ſayd. Although I am forbiddē by God, to opē this vnto you, yet for your ſakes I wyll vtter it. He wylled his cō
                  panions to learne of the dwellers, what the auncient name was of ye two litle Baths yt were of moſt price.

They did as he required them, and vnderſtood that the one was called Loue, and the other Loues Contrary,

He by and by ſtyrring the water, for he ſate in the mouthe of the Bathe, where the water runneth out, &amp; hauing ſpoken few words, he rayſed a Childe from the bottom of the Fowntaine. The Childe was whyte and of meane ſtature, his heare yelow, his ſhoulders very whyte, and altogether like one that waſhed, and had beene waſhed. His companions being amaſed, let vs go ſayde he to the other Bathe. He aroſe and went afore, as in a muſe. And doing there as he did before, hee rayſed the other Loue, like to the fyrſt in all reſpectes, ſauing his heares were black and red, hanging ouer his ſhoulders. He embraſed bothe the Boyes, and they cloue to him, as to a gentill naturall father, whom he reſtored to their former places. Whē he was waſhed, he went his waye, his frends maruailing much, from that time, left aſking of queſtions. And being drawne with the euident ſignes, as with a brydle that cannot breake, gaue him credite in all thinges. There is other matter more ſtrainge and monſtrous, told of him, of the which, I will put none to wrighting. Thinking it to men, to be hurtful, and to God hatefull, to commit to ſyrme and ſtable hiſtory, vaine and ſtrainge tromperie: yea, I wright thys fearefully, only following ſuch men, as not beleuing others, were compelled to theſe by plaine ſence. None of his friends wrote theſe, that I doo know. Aedeſius telling it modeſtlye, neyther he wrighting it, nor any other being bolde to doo it.
               In Iamblicus his time, liued Alypius, moſt perſite in Alypius.
                  
the arte of Logicke, whoſe body was moſt ſmall and little bigger then a Pigmey? The body apparant might be thought a ſoule and a ſpirite, the corruptible part not growing great, was diſtributed into diuine matter. For as the great Plato ſayth. Diuine bodyes haue a contrarie being, to them that be mixed with mindes: ſo may a man ſay, that he was tranſformed into a ſoule, of the which he was poſſeſſed as of a God. Alypius had many followers, but his manner of teaching was onely by familier ſpech. No mā brought a booke. Therfore they gladly made recourſe to Iamblicus, as to draw and drinke of a flowing Fowntaine, not containing it ſelf within the brinke. The ſame of them bothe encreaſing, it hapned that they met together as two Starres, &amp; being beſet with an audience as in a great Schole, and Iamblicus, ſtaying to be aſked rather thē to aſke, Alypius, beyond al expectation, leauing Philoſophicall matter, in the mydeſt of the audience, ſayd vnto him. Tell me, O Philoſopher, whether a ritch man be vniuſt, or ye heire of an vniuſt perſon, for in theſe, there is no meane? He, not liking the ſubtiltie of the queſtion, ſayd: O rare man, it is not the trade of our teaching, what is ſuperfluous in outward things, but if a man doe followe inwardlye, with vertues meete for a Philoſopher. And thus ſaid, he departed and all the audience with him, as he wente, merueling at the ſubtility of the queſtion, he procured talke with him, priuately at ſundry times, and ſo loued him for his witte and learning, as when he departed, he wrote his life. For he that wrote this treatiſe had that booke, which was very obſcurely written, and ouerlaide with deepe clowdes, not ſo much, for

the hardnes of ſpeeche, as ſor that it contained tedious matter of Alypius doctrine, whereof there is no memorie, how the diſputations were vſed. That booke ſpake of a going to Rome, of the which there was no cauſe ſhewed, nor no great qualitie of the minde, but that many had the man in admyration, but what he ſayde or dyd, there is no mention. This ſinguler man Iamblicus ſeemeth to haue that fault that Painters haue, who when they painte them of floriſhing yeares, and wil ſet foorth the picture with ſomewhat of them ſelues, they do marre the forme they would expreſſe, and ſwarue from the plat and be auty of their example. So he, propounding to praiſe the trueth, falleth into the ſharpenes of puniſhmentes and miſfortunes, exerciſed in his time: but the cauſes and occaſions he neyther dyd particularly expreſſe, nor went about it, and did confounde the patterne of his whole life.
               Hardly, this he left to be perceyued, of them that can, with great cunning, gather, that he did wonder at the man, and allowed his conſtancie in aduerſitie, and the fineneſſe &amp; deapth of his Oration. He was of Alexandria. And thus much of Alipius, who dyed in his Country, when he was old, and after him Iamblicus, leauing many Fountaines and foundations Death of Alipius and Iamblicus. of Philoſophie. He that wrote this, was of their company, and other of their rehearſed Schollers, were diſperſed thoroughout the whole Romaine Empire: and Aedeſius abode at Pergamo in Aſia.

                     Aedeſius of Cappadotia, tooke Iamblicus office, and taught his Schollers. A woman alſo of this name of rare vertue and chaſtitie. He came of a good houſe, but of no great ſubſtance. Therefore his Father ſent him to Athens to learne ſome Art of profyte, being returned, and his father thinking to haue gotten gaine by him, and perceyuing he had ſpent his time in Philoſophy, he put him out of his houſe as vnprofitable, and purſued him, ſaying. What doth Philoſophie profit thee? Very much father, ſaide he, turning and kneeling downe: which, when his father ſaw, he called him home againe; and marueiled at his conſtancie, and minding to be ruled by him ſent him againe to his ſtudy, which he had diſcontinued. Hee ſent him afore and followed with reioycing, as a father rather of a Diuine creature, then a mortall man. He going before all other that then were famous, or of whom he had bin Auditor, and hauing gottē knowledge of Philoſophy, went to ye ſingular Iamblicus, no long way, from Cappadocia to Sytia. Whom when he did ſee, and hard him ſpeake, he did depend vpon him, and coulde not be ſatiſfyed with his words, ſo as in the end, Aedeſius was not much inferiour to Iamblicus, except in Diuination, of the which I can write nothing, for that Aedeſius kept it ſecret for the time: Conſtantine being Emperour, and in euery place deſtroying goodly Temples, and erecting Chriſtian Churches: wherfore, it may be, yt the beſt Diſciples keeping thoſe miſteries in ſecret, did incline to the ſacred taciturnitie of that circuit
                     •
                  .

For he that wrote this being a Childe, &amp; Diſciple to Cryſanthius, could ſcarcely learne the trueth in twē
                  ty yeares. So great a labour it was to bring Iamblicus Philoſophy to our vnderſtanding, &amp; to frame it to our tyme. When Iamblicus was dead, ſome went one waye and ſome another, and there was none without fame and eſtimation.
               
                  So pater, the eloquenteſt of the reſt, of his luſty nature and corage, coulde not abyde to lyue among other Sopater. men, but went to yt Emperours Court: that he might repreſſe and mitigate the vehemencie &amp; tiercenes of Conſtantine by reaſon. And he came to ſuch dignity &amp; power, as the Emperour was wonne by him, and in publique aſſemblies, would haue him ſet on his right hand: a thing incredible to be heard or ſeene. The great men repyned that the Court ſhould learne Phyloſophy: And as Cercopes, fought time not onely to take Hercules ſleeping, but alſo the waking Fortune voyde of reaſon: Euen ſo they, in ſecrete 
                     Cercopes, crafty men. counſels &amp; meetings, omitted no part of deuillyſh deuice, to bring their purpoſe to paſſe.
               In Athens, there was none, though it were a popular ſtate, that durſt accuſe the auncient and great Socrates, whome all the Cittie thought a perfyt man of Sapience: tyll by dronkennes and intemperance, and feaſts of Bacchus all night, they were led with laughter and tryfles, and ſtaynd with vaine and corrupted affections.
               Whome Ariſtophanes dyd fyrſt infect, drawing Ariſtophanes. their mindes to ſcoffing, and leaping ſonges, and brought the whole audience to behold the ſkipping of Flees, and dauncing of Clowdes, and ſuch other toyes in the ſteede of inſtructiō, which Commedy is

woont to deuice for paſtime. Whē they ſaw y• people ſo enclined to pleaſure, they framed an accuſation, and durſt bring a wicked Oration againſt him: for the which, all the people was plagued, when he was dead. For he that wyll conſider the tymes: ſhall fynd The death of Socrates, cauſe of calamitie to Gretia.
                   that after Socrates was violently put to death, the Athenians neuer dyd any notable feate, but the Citie decayed, and through it, all Gretia was deſtroyed.
               The lyke maye be ſeene, by the mallice that was borne to Sopater. For Conſtantinople that before was called Byzance, dyd ſerue Athens of Corne, and Byzance. it is vnneth to be beleeued, how much was brought thyther. But now all the Shyppes of Egipt, Aſia, Syria, and Phaenitia, and other Nations that bryngeth abundance of Corne by euery winde, can not ſerue nor ſatiſfye the droonken people that Conſtantine haue brought thyther, by deſtroying of other 
                     Conſtantinople populous. Citties, to make ſhoutes and ſurfettes in the Theatre about him, ſeeking praiſe of the rude ſort, and a memory of his name, of them that can ſcarcely ſoūd it, but by vſe.
               It chaunced ſo, that Byzance being ſo ſcituate, as no Nauie can well enter the Port, vnleſſe a vehemēt ſouthwinde bloweth, which hapneth oft by reaſon of the ſcite of the Mountaynes. The Commons, being ſtyrred by famine, a rare prayſe of a dronken people: aſſembled in the Theatre, wherof the Emperour was abaſhed. Then the olde enuiours hauing got a very good occaſion, ſayd: Sopater, whome thou honoureſt, hath tyed the wyndes, by his exceeding wiſdome, which thou doeſt ſo prayſe, and for the which, thou ſetteſt him in royall place.
               
                  Conſtantine hearing this, and mooued at it, commaunded

                  Sopater to be put to death: which, by his euyl willers, was ſooner done then ſpoken. Ablabius, 
                  
                     Sopater iudged to dye. Ablabius.
                   great maiſter of the Court, was Author of all this miſchiefe: becauſe Sopater grew in more credite then he.

               There is a tale in mens mindes, and no man doth reproue it, that an Aegiptiā, comming from that part of Egipt, that is called Mendeſio, to Conſtantinople: and as all Aegiptians are learned to be impudent in their iourneys, in common wayes, and he had learned to play that part at home: He entred into one of the Iunes, &amp; being very hungry &amp; thyrſty, with his long way, commaunded ſweete Wine to be brought him, and ſhewed ſyluer. The Hoſteſſe of the houſe, being glad of gaines, went for it ſpeedely. The wife was one of them that bringeth Chyldwomen a bed. Whyle ſhe brought that Cuppe to the Aegiptian full A Mydwyfe. of ſweete Wine, one of her neighbours came rūning to her, ſaying: Your friend and kynſwoman is now in daunger of her thyrd byrth, except you come and helpe her. When ſhe heard this, ſhe left the Aegiptian, tyll ſhe had done her office, with the labouring woman: whome, when ſhe had brought a bed, and waſhed hir handes, ſhe came to her ſtranger, who was very angry with her, for her tarying.
               But when ſhe had tolde him wherabout ſhe was, he d

                   his thyrſt, that he might tell the Fortune of it.

When he had learned the inſtant, he cried alowde, go &amp; tell the woman, that her chyld ſhalbe lytle inferiour to a King: when he had ſayd this, he dranke vp his drinke, and tolde his name to the woman.
               The Chyld was called Ablabius, and proued a ball of Fortune: for he might rule the Emperour, &amp; cauſed Sopater to dye for a matter of leſſe waight thē 
                  Socrates dyd, as one yt ruled an vnruly people. This Conſtantius honored Ablabius, &amp; was plagued for it: how he died, it is written in his life. He left his ſonne Conſtantius to be gouerned of Ablabius, and he raigned in his Fathers kingdom, with Conſtans &amp; Conſtantine his Brethren, which is more plainly ſet forth in ye life of diuine Iulianus. Conſtantinus, entring his raygne and receyuing ſuch portion, which was from Ellyria to Niſibe, put Ablabius from his authority. He lyued in Bithynia, at a place, which he had princely builded for reſt &amp; quietneſſe, men marueling that he had geuen ouer his authority. Conſtantius ſent certaine ſouldiours from the Cittie that beareth his Fathers name, commaunding the former, to delyuer his Letters with reuerence, which is to kneele after the Romaine manner, when they ſpeake to the Emperour. He receyuing the Letters with great pryde, deſyred 
                     Ablabius looking ſtyll for honour is kylled. the Purple Robe of ye ſouldiours, with ſeuere countenance, and terrible looke. They aunſwered, they had it not, and that the bringers of it, ſtoode without. He, with hauty minde, and proude behauiour, did bid they ſhould be brought in. They came in, &amp; in ſteede of a red Robe, gaue him a red bloody death, cuttyng him in peeces, as an Oxe that is kylled to be eaten publiquely. Thus this happy Ablabius was puniſhed for the wrong he dyd to Sopater.

But the obſcure and heauenly matter was out of his memory, therfore he called his Chylde, minding to waſh his face and eyes with water. The Boy tolde him that his left hand was full of Letters. He ſaw and vnderſtoode it was a diuine thing: And ſo worſhypping his hand, he did ſee wryting, which was an Oracle after this ſort.

               He chooſing to follow the better way, found out a lytle houſe, and followed Shepheards trade. Schollers that were deſyrous of his learning, vnderſtanding where he lay, came thyther with an vnpleaſant noyſe, lyke the howling of Dogges, and beſette the ſame houſe with threatnings, that they would teare him a peeces, if he would not impart his knowledge to them, but ſuffer it to be hydden among Mountaines and Forreſtes, as though he neyther was a man, nor had the ſhape of a man. By this violence he came abrode among men, &amp; tooke the worſt way.

He left Cappadocia, delyuering his charge to Euſtathius, 
                  Euſtathius. a man no way alyed to him, &amp; went into Aſia, the Countrey requiring him, and making his abode at Pergamo, whether the Gretians and borderers reſorted to him, his fame was ſo great.
               Touching Euſtathius, it were a ſinne, not to tell the trueth. Euery man confeſſed that he was of good conditions, and of great eloquence. For in his tongue and lyppes, was ſuch a pleaſantnes, as it ſeemed to be a poynet of wytchery, ſuch a ſweetnes was in his wordes, and wrought ſo much, as they that hearde 
                     Lotos, a Tree, whoſe ſweet fruite maketh men forget theyr Countrey. him, forgot them ſelues. Euen as men that eate Lotos, and were caryed away with his ſpeeches, as Saylers be with Syrenes ſonges.
               Wherfore the Emperour, albeit he was geuen to reade the Chriſtians workes, ſent for him. He was lyke now to haue buſynes, for that the King of Perſia moued warre, and beſieged Antiochia, and at a ſoden 
                     Antioche beſieged of the Perſians.
                   aſſault, had gotten the Tower of the Theatre, and with ſhotte, kylled an infynite number of the beholders. In this caſe there was no Gretian, but commended Euſtathius to the Emperour.

But in this extreme neceſſitie, in all mens iudgements, Euſtathius was thought moſt meete. Wherfore being ſent for of the Emperour, he obeyed. And ſuch an eloquence proceeded from him, as the Emperour rewarded all them with great honours, that moued him firſt to call him, and them he vſed with more good wyll. Some, voluntarily accompanied him with their preſence, in the Embaſſadge,

to haue more experience of him: or to ſee the effect of his eloquence, among the Barbarians. Being come into Perſia, the acc

                  ſſe to the King was as dangerous

                   &amp; fearfull, as it was reported. Yet at length when audience was geuen, as commonly is woont to Embaſſadours: the King marueled at ye ſobernes of his vſage, and the ſweetnes of his language. And though he wrought al waies to affray him, hearing his tempred &amp; pleaſant voyce, and ſeeing his ſober &amp; modeſt looke, he wylled him to proceede. He dyd ſo. The Tyran being moued with his eloquence, &amp; going to meate, cauſed Euſtathius to be called by ſome of his Chamber, whervnto he obeyed. And as he was by nature, created to expreſſe the force of vertue, he was admitted a gueſt at the Table. And did worke ſo with his perſwaſon, as it lacked but lytle, that the Perſian King dyd not leaue his Diademe &amp; purpoſe, his precious Stones &amp; Iuels, and put on the ſymple Cloke of Euſtathius. So great a fall had it made of the pleaſures of the body: as he thought them vnhappy, that vſed them. But they yt were allyed with y• king, dyd ſtoppe it. Saying, he was a Mytch, and that he ſhould anſwer the Romain Emperour: he maruelled, he would ſend men that differed nothing from rytch ſlaues, hauing ſo many worthy men about him.
               But this Embaſſadour was beyond all hope. For this I know well, yt all Gretia deſired to ſee him, and prayed God for his returne. The Oracles did agree with theſe miſfortunes, whē their prayers fayled, for he dyd not returne. The Gretians ſent vnto him, and choſe moſt wyſe men to be the meſſengers. Their minde was to talke with the great Euſtathius, which thing came not to paſſe, according to the tokens.
               
                  
He hearing ſo ſhylfull and learned men, conſydered deepely of the matter, &amp; did examine the magnitude, the tyme, and forme of the Stars. Then ſmyling, he came among them, and when he had heard them, to whom he would not fayne, neither by conference, nor cloquence, he ſayd. But theſe dyd not promiſe my returne. Yet I thinke God anſwereth contrary to mēs requeſt. For he ſheweth that the tokens were leſſe and ſlower, than could do any good. This Euſtathius ſo notable a man, dyd marry Soſipatra, who excelled

                      an excellent learned woman. her huſband ſo farre in knowledge of Sapience, that ſhe made him obſcure and of no name. It is meete to ſpeake of her in the lyfe of learned men, ſo great was the glory of this woman. She was of Aſia, about Epheſus where the flood Cayſter floweth along, and geueth a name to the Region. She was come of rych 
                     Cayſter, a flood ful of Swannes in Lydia.
                   and wealthy Parents, the which ſhe augmented from hir chyldhood: So great beuty and fauour had ſhe in her tender yeares.
               When ſhe was fiue yeares olde, two auncient men, being paſt all the termes of youth, and the one elder then the other, came into the Manour of Soſypatras Father, with their ſkryppes and bagges. And obtayned of the Farmour to haue the ouerſyght of the Vineyard, which was eaſily graunted them. The encreaſe growing aboue all hope, and the owner being come with his Daughter, he wondred at the abundance, thinking it to be done by myracle. Therfore he cōmaunded the Farmour to bring them to y• Table, where he made them good cheere, and rebuked his ſeruants, yt they could not do the lyke. The two olde men being ſo well vſed at a Gretians Table, &amp; maruelouſly delighted with the beuty of his daughter, ſaid.

Other things we keepe in ſecrete: and this prayſe, of goodwyll, as a tryfle and ieſt, with a contempt of the things that we haue encreaſed. But if thou wylt be rewarded of vs for this cheere and hoſpitality, not with mony, nor thanks that may quaile and corrupt, but with a celeſtiall gyfte that ſhall flowe from the ſtarres, vpon thee and thy lyfe, geue vs this Hoſipatra, as Nurſes and Fathers indeede. And for fyue yeares, feare nothing for thy chylde, touching death, but be quiet and at reſt. Care not for the tylling of the grounde theſe fyue yeares, by the courſe of the Sunne. For of it ſelfe, ryches ſhall growe of this grounde and encreaſe. And thy Daughter ſhall not be as an humaine woman, but thou ſhalt conceyue a greater opinion of her. Therfore, if thou haſt good wyll, receyue with both hands, that we haue offred. But if thou haſt any ſuſpition, we haue ſayd nothing. The Father in feare &amp; ſylence, delyuered his daughter to them, and calling his Farmor, ſayde. Whatſoeuer theſe olde men require, let them haue it, and medle no further.
               When he had thus ſayd, he departed before day, as forſaking both his houſe and his Daughter. They receyuing the chylde, whether they were wyſe men, or Spyrites of rare diuine kinde, with what myſteries they brought vp the young Mayde, no man can tell, and it is in certaine, though the ſearch be great, with what diuination they inſpyred the Chylde.
               The tyme appoynted was come, and euery thing prooued of the ground, as was ſpoken. The Father was come, and knew not his Daughter. Neyther for the growth of her perſon, nor for the encreaſe of her beautie. And ſhe knewe not her Father, he ſaluting

her ſo reuerently, as though he had ſaluted a Straunger. When the Teachers were come, and the table couered, they ſayde. Aſke the Virgin what you wyll. Aſke, O Father what hath chaunced all your iourney. He geuing her leaue to ſpeake, ſhe tolde him all the happes that he had had in his Chariot, The diuination of Soſepatra, to her Father. the woordes, the rebukes, the feares, as though ſhe had bene in Chariot with them, and brought her Father into ſuch a wonder, as at the fyrſt he was in a maze, more then in a maruayle, and beleeued the Mayde to be a Goddeſſe. Then kneeling to the men, prayed them to tell who they were. They hardly, and at length, (for ſo it might be Goddes pleaſure,) ſayde. They were of the Sapience called Caldaicall, not prophane. And not without ſome miſterie looked downe. Then he kneeled againe, and prayed them to be Lordes of the ground, and to keepe his Chylde with them, to inſtruct her further in diuinity. They nodded, that ſo they would doo: ſaying nothing. And he, as hauing a promiſe and an Oracle, had good comfort in himſelfe, yet knew not the ſecretes, and with him ſelfe prayſed Homer, that hath ſhewed of ſuch diuine deedes, that cannot be vnderſtanded, for the ſtraunge and diuine matter.
               
                  
                     The Goddes be turned to diuers ſhapes, as pleaſe them nowe and then: 
                     
                        Odyſſ. 17.
                  
                  
                     When Cities they wyll cauſe to ſeeme, a race of new founde men.
                  
               
               For he thought that Goddes woulde be turned to ſtraunge men. And being rauiſhed with the thing, he fel a ſleepe. They going from Supper, and taking

the Child with them, deliuered vnto her very gently, the Robe wherwith ſhe was inueſted with knowledge, to ye which they added diuerſe other ornamēts. They wylled her to locke ye Caſket, wherin all theſe things were put, &amp; gaue her certaine bookes beſyde. She honoured them no leſſe then her Father.
               Day being come, and the doores opened, and men gone to their worke, they alſo went out as they were woont. The Chyld ranne to her father, carying her Caſket, and good newes. He hauing learned of his ſeruaunts what increaſe he had, and what was to be done, called for the men: But they were gone, and no more ſeene. Then he ſayde to Soſipatra: what meaneth this, O Daughter? She ſtaying a whyle, ſayd. Now I remember what they ſayd at their delyuering of me theſe things, weeping. Looke daughter, for we muſt go to the weſt Oceane, and ſhortly returne againe. The which doth manifeſtly declare that they be Spirits. And whether ſoeuer they be gone, thus they went from me.
               The father eſteeming his chyld to be ſacred with diuine modeſty, ſuffred her to lyue as ſhe would, not, much moued with her, but for her ſylence. When ſhe was come to rype yeares, ſhe had without booke, the bookes of Poets, hauing none other Teachers, &amp; of Philoſophers, and Oratours. And that, which others can hardly get with labour and trauayle of minde: ſhe, without ſtudy, did expreſſe with pleaſure. Mynding to marry, ſhe thought Euſtathius only fyt for her. Therfore, thus ſhe ſpake to Euſtathius, and them that were preſent. Heare me Euſtathius, and be you wytneſſe that be here.
               I ſhall haue three Chyldren by thee: and as touching Diuination of Soſipatra.
                  
                  
the world, they ſhalbe all infortunate. Againſt God, no man can be. Thou ſhalt haue before me, a fayre and a worthy ſeate. And I, peraduenture, ſhall haue a fayrer. Thyne ſhalbe about the Moone.
               Thou ſhalt not teach, nor play ye Philoſopher, fully fiue yeares, for ſo thy Phiſnognomy telleth me. But vnder the Moone thou ſhalt haue place with good and quiet motion. I would ſay ſomewhat of my ſelfe, but that I ſee the tyme would be to ſhort for my ſpeech: and my deſtiny doth forbyd me.
               When ſhe had thus ſpoken, fate ſo forcing, ſhe was 
                     Soſipatra marryed to Euſtathius.
                   ioygned to Euſtathius. The ſucceſſe dyd differ nothing from her wordes, ſo certaine was her diuination, as all had bene done before. This is to be added to the other things, that after the death of Euſtathius, ſhe came to her owne in Aſia, and remayned at old Pergamo.
               
               
                  Aedeſius for good wyll, taught her chyldren Philoſophy, 
                     Soſipatra returneth to Pergamo.
                   albeit ſhe had inſtructed them in her owne houſe. And after Aedeſius reſorted to her, no man eſteemed his learning ſo as they dyd, but euery man honoured the diuine knowledge of the woman.
               
                  Philometer her Nephew, being ouercome with her 
                     Philometer in loue with Soſipatra.
                   beuty, and alſo with her learning, fell in loue with her. Her rare gyſts ſo ſurpriſed him, that he could do nothing for that. Likewiſe ſhe was in loue with him Wherfore ſhe went to Maximus, who was moſt familyar with Aedeſius, and of his kyndred. Maximus (ſayd ſhe) take order for my griefe, that I be not moleſted. Maximus. He aſked what ye matter was? She anſwered. What if it be Philometer? Then it is he in deede, who differeth not from any of you. Yet when I ſee him depart, my hart burneth, &amp; turneth at his departure.

Therfore deale friendly with me, and tell me what is beſt for me.
               
                  Maximus was not a lytle proude, as being ſpoken to from a Goddeſſe, that ſuch a one ſhould committe ſuch a matter to him. Philometer continued in his purpoſe. Maximus ſought out the matter by Sacrifice, and tooke great paines in a trifling cauſe. When he had done, he went to Soſipatra, and aſked her, if ſhe were ſtyll troubled. She ſayde no: And tolde his inuocation, his Sacrifice, and all the doing, and tyme, as if ſhe had bene preſent at the appearing of all the viſions. Then he fell to the ground aſtoniſhed, and ſayde ſhe was a Goddeſſe. Ariſe, Sonne (ſayd ſhe) for the Gods loue thee, becauſe thou honoureſt them, and doeſt not eſteeme the worldly and vaine ryches. When he heard this, he went forth with great opinion of him ſelfe, that he had the praiſe of ſo diuine a perſon. Philometer with his companions gladſome, met him at the gate. Maximus a far off ſpake to him. O friende Philometer: leaue to burne wood in vaine, as though he knew what Sorcery he went about. He thinking he heard God ſpeake, honoured Maximus, and left his practiſe, deſpiſing the purpoſe he had taken in hande. From henceforth, Soſipatra loued him purely, and ſo dyd he, her.
               And chauncing, that they being all with her, except Philometer, who was at his paſtime: they fell into a diſputation of the ſoule, of the which, diuerſe argumentes were made. When Soſipatra ſpake, ſhe confuted the former opinions, with euident demonſtrations. Then ſhe entreated of the ſoule generally. What part was puniſhable, &amp; what, immortall, like one that had bene rapt with a diuine furie. And as

ſhe had ſayde, ſodenly ſhe held her peace, lyke one in a traunce. And ſtaying a lytle, ſhe cryed: Alack, my coſyn Philometer, ryding in his Chariot, is ouerthrowen, in a very ſlippery and vnequall place. He was in daunger of breaking his legges, but his ſeruants were diligent &amp; ſaued him: yet is he hurt in his hāds, and his ſhoulders, but without daunger, he is ſet vp againe, and calleth on the Gods. This ſhe ſayd, and it was ſo. All men thought, Soſipatra was in euery place, and knew euery thing, as Philoſophers affyrmeth of the Gods.
               She dyed, leauing three chyldren. Of two of their Death of Soſipatra.
                   names I ſhall not neede to wryte. The thyrd named Antoninus, was worthy of his Parentes, and lay about Canobus, one of the mouthes, of the flood Nilus, 
                  Canobus. and applyed the trade of that place to be as his mother had pronoſticated of him. Young men that deſyred to purge their ſoules with Philoſophy, reſorted to him. The Temple being full of perſons, and he occupied about the holy things, as a man that ſerued God, yet no God: tolde them, that after his death, there ſhould be no more Temple. All the goodly holy things of Serapis, ſhould be defaced, &amp; turned to confuſion and deformity. And that the rude darkneſſe, which had bene thought a Fable, ſhould haue great power vpon earth. All the which ſayings, tyme dyd confirme: and the effect ſhewed the violence of the propheſie to be true. Of this ſort, ſome haue bene left, (for I wyll not wryte, the morning moouinges of Morning influence of Heſiodus.

And of them, the prediction of Soſipatra, was not vaine. Whoſe names I mynd not to recyte, for this Booke is to ſpeake of good men, and not of euyl.
               Yet one of her Chyldren, Antoninus by name, of whom I ſpake before, remaining at Alexandria, was 
                     Antonirus ſonne to Soſipatra.
                   ſo delighted with Canobus, that he gaue himſelf wholy to the Ceremonies of ſecrete ſanctity, and the worſhipping of ye Goddes, neglecting his body, and the pleaſures of the ſame, embraſing Philoſophy, that was hyd to the people. Of whom we might wryte at large. But he, touching matter of Religion, vttred nothing ſtraunge to the common ſence of men: paraduenture, ſuſpecting and fearing the proceedings of the Emperour, tending to other matter. His conſcience, patience, and ſtability, euery man reuerenced: and they that came to traffyke at Alexandria, came to him by Sea.
               
                  Alexandria, was a populous Citty, &amp; for the Temple of Scrapis, an holy habitation, vnto the which they Alexandria. flowed by multitudes, from all places of the world: and when they had done their deuotion, they repayred as faſt to Antoninus, taking recreation by water, to go to a man of worthineſſe: They that were admitted to his company, propounded ſome queſtion,

and were freely and fully inſtructed with the Sapience of Plato. They that propounded problemes of diuine matter, ſpake to a picture, for nothing was aunſwered them. But, with ſtable and vnmouing eyes he looked vp to heauen, not eaſily to be brought to ſuch diſputations.
               It was ſeene not long after, that there was a diuine knowledge in him. For he was no ſooner dead, but the deuotion of Alexandria, and the Temple of Serapis was deſtroyed. And not only the Religion, but the houſes and all things was fordoone. As in Poeticall Fables, of the force of Gyants. And the Temples at Canopus, ſuffred the lyke. For Theodoſius, 
                  Theodoſius Theophilus being Emperour, and Theophilus his Lieftenant, as Eurimedon.

To ſuch an opinion of vertue were men brought, of the which we ſpeake in the moſt part of our Hiſtorie. They did place Monks at Canobus, that mortall ſlaues, ſhould be honoured in ſteede of immortall Gods, and mens mynds be entangled with vngodly matter. Some of their heads yt were puniſhed for their great offences, were ſaltyd, &amp; ſhewed as Gods to be honoured: although as theeues, they had bene puniſhed.
               Men thought them ſelues the better, when they erred in going to the Sepulchres. They were called Martyrs, Deacons, and Legates of the prayers that were made to God, being vyle ſlaues, and branded for their faultes, carying the ſcarres of their whyppings, as markes of their lewdneſſe. Yet the earth bringeth forth ſuch Gods. This dyd confyrme the great diuinatiō of Antoninus, ſaying: that Temples ſhould be made Sepulchres.
               The great Iamblicus, as we wrote in his lyfe, whē one had rayſed Apollo, and euery man afrayde that ſaw him, he came among them and ſayde, maruayle no more good friendes, for this is the Image of a Sword player. So diuerſe is it to ſee a thing with the minde, and with the deceyptfull eyes of the body. Iamblicus told the preſent euyll. But Antoninus, the things that were to come. Which thing onely was cauſe of his griefe. For he came to a quiet ende in olde age, without any ſickneſſe: but it was greeuous and heauy to good men, for the ruines of the Temples.
            
            
               
               Maximus.
               
                  
                     WE haue made mention of Maximus before, &amp; the wryter hereof did ſee him: and came to his company when he was olde, and heard his voyce, which was, as if one had heard Homers, Minerua, or Apollo. The balles of his eyes were rollyng. His beard was long. His looke declared the vehemency of his minde. It was a ioy to heare him, or ſee him. With both ſences dyd he pearce his cōpany, that could not abyde the ſharpneſſe of his eyes, nor the ſwiftneſſe of his tongue. There was none ſo well learned or eloquent in his company, that durſt ſpeake againſt him. But being ſylent, they depended vpon his wordes, as an Oracle. So great a ſweetneſſe ſate in his lyps. He was come of good houſe and wealthy. He had Brethren, whome he would not ſuffer to go before him, he being the fyrſt: Claudianus, who taught at Alexandria, and Nymphidianus, who profeſſed with prayſe at Smyrna. This man was taught by Aedeſius, 
                  
                     Claudianus Nymphidianus.
                   by whoſe Sapience he was caught. And when Iulianus raygned, choſen to be Schoolemaiſter only, all the other being ſequeſtred by Conſtantius: as we

                  Conſtantinus houſe decaying, only Iulianus was left, who for his tender age and weakneſſe, was deſpyſed. The Kings Vncles dyd keepe him, and obſerued that he ſhould be a good Chriſtian. After the which tyme, he ſhewed the docility of his nature. Docilitie of Iuli

not beare with the ſwyftnes of his wytte, not hauing what to teach him. When they had no more to teach him, nor he to learne of them, they deſyred his Coſyn Conſtantius, to let him ſtudy Rhetorique, and Philoſophy. Which, by the wyll of God, he dyd permyt. Minding to haue him wander, and to be ydle in bookes, rather then to haue any minde of kingdomes. When this was graunted, and a great reuenew, and princely trayne appointed to him, he wēt whether he would. And came to Pergamo, being mooued with the fame of Aedeſius, who was nowe waxen olde, and weake in body. His chiefe familiars, was Maximus, of whome we now wryte: Chryſanthius

Iulianus, in whome was a ſage youth, was admitted to familiaritie with Aedeſius, being rauiſhed with the ſharpnes and excellencie of his minde, and would not depart.

Thou ſeeſt the diſpoſitiō of it, if thou wylt do any thing, being a louing chyld of Sapience, for ſo do I gather by the tokens of the minde, go among my gentle ſchollers, of whom thou ſhalt be fylled with all kinde of learning and knowledge.

                  Iulianus had heard this, he did not therfore leaue him, though he meant to ſpend his time with Maximus &amp; Chryſanthius. Chryſanthius was lynked with Maximus, in the works of maruelous ſcience by inſpiration, leauing lyberal arts. And Euſebius, when Maximus was preſēt, would not medle, wt the finenes of Logike, and Rhetorike. Whē he was abſent, he did ſhine like a glittering Star, ſuch pleaſantnes &amp; grace was in his words. Chryſanthius praiſed him, and agreed with him, and Iulianus honored him. Euſebius made this concluſion, yt thoſe things had being, that were in deede. But they that deceyue their ſences, be works of Sorc

                  rers, &amp; of them yt dally with matters of the earth, with mad perſwaſions. When Iulianus had heard this determination, he called Chryſanthius aſyde, &amp; ſayd. If thou loueſt the truth, tell me the effect of this concluſion. He cōſidering the matter deepely, ſaid. You ſhall do beſt, not to learne this of me, but of the Author himſelfe. Which when he heard, he did ſo, &amp; made great accoumpt of Chryſanthius for this aunſwer. When they met againe, Iulianus ſpared not to delyuer ye matter, &amp; boldly aſked him, what he meant by yt concluſion: Then Euſebius with ſweete words, ſayd. Maximus, one of the moſt aunciēt &amp; beſt learned Auditors, for the ſharpnes of his nature, contemned theſe leſſons, and gaue himſelfe to a certaine Magike. And ſodenly called vs to Hecates Tēple, where many

He made a peece of Inſence cleane, and whiſperīg a certain praier to himſelf, wrought ſuch a feat, as y• goddeſſe ſmiled, as if it wer a ſmilīg indeed.

We being troubled with the ſyght, he ſayd. Let none of you be afrayde of this, for by and by, the Lampes ſhall burne that ſhe had in her handes. He had no ſooner ſpoken, but the flames fluſhed from her fyngers. We maruayled at this cunning, and went our way. Do not you maruayle at this, no more then I, that by puritie of reaſon, thinke it no great matter.
               When diuine Iulian had heard this, he ſayd. Farewell, and apply thy booke, for thou haſt tolde mee what I thought. Hauing thus ſayd, and kyſſed Chriſanthius, he went to Epheſus. Where he accompanied with Maximus, and earneſtly ſtudied his doctrine. But Maximus called to him the learned Chryſanthius, being ſcarcely able to teach the young man ſufficiently in the knowledge of Sapience. Who being inſtructed of them, and vnderſtanding that there was The Goddeſſes were Ceres and Proſerpina.

               He foreſaw the deſtruction of Grecia, and the defaſing of Temples, in the preſence of this writers hearing, and affyrmed he ſhould be a Prieſt after him, although it ſhoulde not be lawfull for him to vſe his office, becauſe he was ſacred to ſtrange Goddes, and ſhould ſweare ſolemnly not to ſerue them: yet he ſayd he ſhould be a chiefe in the Cleargy, though he were not an Athenian borne. And ſo much dyd he foreſee, that in his tyme, he ſayde, Temples and holy things ſhould be deſtroyed, and he ſee it, and be contemned for his obſtinacy, though he vſed his duety to the Goddeſſes, and ſhould be depriued of his honour: and

neyther be Prieſt, nor dye an olde man. Theſe Ceremonyes were called, Mithriaaes, of Mithra, whome the Perſians, calleth Apollo.
                  
               
               When the father of Apollos Ceremonies, had thus ſayd, and vnſpeakeable troubles followed: ſome are tolde in other hiſtories, and ſome ſhalbe ſhewed in this Volume: When as Alarichus paſſed ye ſtreyghts, as an open and plaine fyeld, with Barbarians. The ſecte that weare blacke apparell, which came with him, breaking all duety of obedience, opened the

                   ſtrayghts of Grecia to him. This happened after: though for occaſion, the matter is touched before.
               
                  Iulianus had bene conuerſaunt with this diuine Prieſt, and greedily learned his doctrine, and with ſpeede went to Conſtantius, a partner of the Empire. Maximus was thē in Aſia, &amp; Aedeſius was dead. And Maximus encreaſed in learning abundantly. Iulianus got, not what he would, but what he could, for the Iulianus Apoſtata. neceſſity, for he was ſent into France, not to lyue lyke a Prince, but to be cut off, and ſo peryſh. Yet he preuailed by the prouidence of God, not being knowen that he honoured the Goddes.
               He paſſed the Rhene, and ſubdued all the Barbarous Nations there, and eſcaped many trappes &amp; traynes that were layde for him, as is tolde in his lyfe. He ſent for the Prieſt out of Grecia, and after ſecrete conference betweene them. They conſpyred to deſtroy the tyranny of Conſtantius. To this was priuy Oribaſius 
                  Oribaſius. of Pergamo, and Euemerius of Lybia, which the Romaines calleth Affrica, and is more plainly written Euemerius. in the lyfe of Iulianus. When he had put downe Conſtantius, he ſent the Prieſt into Grecia, appearing as God, and doing what he would. And with him he ſent royall gyfts, to renew the Temples of Grecia.
               
               Then he ſent for Maximus and Cryſanthius, making

one calling for both. It ſeemed good to them to learn of the Goddes. And they being men of great experience and learning: conferring together, and prouing all their knowledge and cunning, found euyll and vnhappy tokens. Which when they both dyd ſee, Chryſanthius was afrayde, and with he auy countenaunce dyd byte his tongue, and ſayde. Here is no abyding for me, friend Maximus, but muſt rather ſeeke to flee. The other with a better corage, ſayde: It ſeemeth Chryſanthius thou haſt forgotten what we learned, when we were chyldren. That it is the part of wyſe men, endewed with that doctrine, not to be afrayde of the fyrſt ſhew, but to recyte and vſe the helpe of diuine nature, tyl thou mayſt finde helpe for thy ſelfe.
               Then ſayd Chryſanthius. You p

                  raduenture are bold and haue hart ſo to do, but I wil not ſtriue withtheſe tokens. Maximus making continual practiſe, came to his purpoſe. Chryſanthius remayned as an Image vnmoueable, not intending to be drawen from his ſentence, taken at the beginning.
               Nowe in Aſia, all men reſorted to Maximus, aſwell they that were in authority, as they that were not: the noble Senators and vulgar people, repayred to Maximus, and made noyſe with ſhoutes, which the people is woont to do, when they wyll honour any man. Yea, ye women at another gate, went to Maximus wyfe, and gratulated her felicity, that ſhe might be good to them: and ſhe ſeemed ſo well learned, as Maximus was not of any learning. Thus Maximus with this great honour in Aſia, went to the Emperour. Chryſanthius remayned at home, to whome God had ſygnified that verſe of Homer in his ſleepe.

               When Maximus with his pompe, was come to Conſtantinople, in ſhort tyme he was notable there. For the Emperour and the Princes, were with him both day and night. Such a felicitie thought they to be ſent of God. It came to paſſe that Maximus began

               The Emperour not knowing of it, commaunded that Priſcus ſhould be ſent for. And Maximus requyred that Chryſanthius might be called alſo. So they were both ſent for, Priſcus from Grecia, and Chryſanthius from Lydia. So much dyd diuine Iulian depend vpon Maximus, as he wrote gently to them both, deſyring them as friends, &amp; praying them as Goddes. And hearing that Chryſanthius had a wyfe, called Melyta, Coſyn to this wryter, whome he loued deerely, 
                     Melyta wyfe of Chryſanthius.
                   he withdrew himſelfe, and wrote to the woman with his owne hande, no man being priuy to it, vſing all the fayre wordes he coulds, that ſhe ſhoulde perſwade her huſbande not to deny to come. And requyring the Letter that was ſent to Chryſanthius, hee put in the other, and ſealed bothe, ſending it by the meſſenger, as one, adding to it further by wordes, what hee thought good to bring the matter to effect.

                  Priſcus came and behaued himſelfe modeſtly. And although there were inowe that would haue puffed him vp: yet he remayned after one ſort, not proude of the Court, but ſeeking to bring it to more Philoſophicall forme.
               
                  Chryſanthius would not be allured, with all the deuiſes, but truſting in the Goddes, and that their determination was vnremoueable, he mynded to obey them. He wrote againe to the Emperour, that for his cauſe he taryed ſtyll in Lydia, and that he dyd it by the counſell of the Goddes. The which thing the Emperour conſydering, he made him chiefe Byſhop of Lydia, with his wyfe, and gaue them authority to place other.
               The Emperour went to the warre of Perſia: Priſcus and Maximus following him. Other dyd the lyke, fylling the number, and boaſting their vertues, becauſe the Emperour affyrmed, he honoured the other, they would haue it thought, he eſteemed them alſo. But when that glorious expedition came to a dolorous ende, (as we wyll ſhew in Iulianus lyfe:) Iouinianus that folowed, honoured them: but he had 
                     Iouinianus, raigned onlye eyght monthes. but a ſhort raigne, as many more haue had.
               Than Valentinianus and Valens ruled, and Maximus and Priſcus, taken to a farre contrary vocation: 
                     Valentinianus &amp; Valens, Emperours. then Iulian called them. For that was for honour and euident ioye. Thus from honour to diſhonour, ſuch diſgraces dyd appeare, in the things that were apparant. Priſcus had no hurt, being well reported of all men, and returned into Grecia. At the which

But afterwarde a leſſe paine was put, and he ſent into Aſia to pay the money, in the which he was condempned. The paines that he ſuffred paſſeth all Tragedy.

And when there was none ende of theſe afflictions, he prayed his wife to buy him an exequiſyte potion, that it might rydde him of his paynes.

                   had bene called to Iulianus Court. So he went to Conſtantinople with

great honour of them, that ſaw his Fortune changed to the better.
               Than was he tryed in matter of diuination, which dyd verye much increaſe his fame. Of the which glorie, griefe dyd growe. They of the Court conſpyring together, to know a ſecrete miſtery, that euerie man coulde not tell, came with it to Maximus, and becauſe they could not agree among themſelues: they woulde haue Maximus declare the Propheſie, for it was thought that he knewe the counſell of the Goddes, and could vtter all their ſecretes to others.
               He perceyuing their minde, and waying the words, dyd perceyue where the difficultie laye, and tolde it as ſurely and truly, as the miſtery was true: Shewing alſo, that the ſhewing of it, woulde vndoo him, and all that ſhoulde heare it.
               
                  ❧ And that many by it, ſhoulde be put to death, that deſerued not. And ſo tolde by the Propheſie, that the Emperour after great ſlaughters of others,

                     s burned in a houſe. ſhoulde ſtraungely dye him ſelfe, and not be buryed: And ſo it came to paſſe, as wee declare in our Hyſtorie.
               The conſpyratours were apprehended, and kylled in euery place, as pullen for a feaſt or banquette, and among them Maximus was taken, and caryed to Antioche, where the Emperour was.
               Yet they were aſhamed to kyll him, becauſe he reprooued in Iudgement, them that accuſed him: and that he had ſayde nothing but trueth, ſo as they beleeued there was a God in Maximus body. Therfore they ſent one Feſtus, a man of cruell nature, with him into Aſia, thynking that place worthy for ſuch a man.
               
                  
Who being come thether, dyd execute his Commiſſion, and ſome what more of himſelfe, following the brunt of his cruell nature.
               When he had executed many guilty, and not guilty: Cruell Feſtus, executeth Maximus.
                   at laſt he diſpatched the great Maximus. This ende had that diuination. But the reſt came to paſſe.
               For the Emperour in a fyght in Scithia, dyed ſo ſtraunge a way, that a bone was not found to be buryed 
                     Valens dyeth myſerably.: And fortune ſhewed another great thing. For Feſtus, as the wryter hereof dyd know, and was preſent at the example, being put from his office, and Feſtus. going to Theodoſius, who was choſen Emperour, maryed a ritch and princely wife. And that he might Theodoſius ſhew his pompe, and put away his fame of euyll doing: proclaymed his feaſt to the beſt and noble ſort. It was the thyrde day of the Calends, that the Romaines call Ianuary. At which tyme, all came to the feaſt, to honour Feſtus.
               
               He went into the Temple of Eumenides, not woont to ſerue the Goddes. Hauing put all that he kylled to death for that cauſe. Being there, he tolde his dreame, and in talking, the teares fell from his eyes: which was thus. He thought that Maximus drew him with an haulter to hell, to aunſwer before Pluto.
               
               They that were preſent, remembring his former lyfe, wept euery one, and wylled him to praye the Goddes for himſelfe. He obeyed, and prayde. But going forth, he fell to the grounde, and two chyldren lay vpon his backe. His voyce forſooke him: and being Wycked Feſtus dieth ſodenly. caryed away, dyed by and by. This ſeemed to be a very great acte, and of diuine prouidence.
            
            
               
               Priſcus.
               
                  
                     OF Priſcus, much is ſayde before, by reaſon of occaſion offered. To ſpeake of his conditions particularly: he was a deepe diſſembler, keeping things hyd in his minde, and of a great memory. And had all auncient opinions collected and ready. He was fayre and great of body, and might ſeeme ignoraunt of learning, becauſe he would ſyldome come to talke, but kept his doctrine as a treaſute, calling them prodigall, that would talke at euery motion. He ſayde, he that was ouercome in diſputation, was no more quiet, then he that reſyſteth againſt the trueth: by waxing wyſe with pleaſures, and delyght of the body, and becommeth an hater of learning, and a deſpiſer of Sapience. For this cauſe he refuſed company, and was rude and ruſticall in behauiour. And this manner he dyd not only vſe among his companions of learning, but from a chylde continued thus, to his olde age.
               
                  Chryſantius tolde the wryter of this worke, that Aedeſius was moſt familiar and populous. And when he had done his Lectors and diſputations: he would walke in Pergamo, with the reſt of his audytours. And as a good teacher, would engraft aſmuch by gentle words &amp; dillygence, in his Schollers, that were hard of capacity, as could be done by man. But whom he perceyued haughty for their ſtraunge doctrine, and ſpreading their feathers, greater and weaker than Icarus: he would throw them downe, not

into the Sea, but to the earth, the place of men.
               In the trade of teaching, he met a woman ſellyng hearbes, whome he with gentle manner beheld, and ſpake to her, of her going about, and what gayne ſhe got to waxe wealthy, and alſo tolde her how hearbs were to be ſowen. The lyke he dyd with a Weauer, Smyth, and Carpenter: and by this, they that were gentle and dilligent, dyd learne, and eſpecially Chryſanthius, and ſome other that were lyke vnto him. Onely Priſcus would not forbeare openly, but called him a bewrayer of Philoſophy, and a man cunning 
                     Priſcus poeuiſh. in wordes, which ſerueth to drawe the minde, but be not obſerued in workes.
               Being of this ſort, after Iulianus death, he refrained frō bytternes, &amp; ſuffred many rebukes of young men, They were called Corybants. that ran about lyke mad men. that were fond of their knowledge, lyke Cybels Prieſtes; yet in all things he kept the grauity of his nature, laughing at mans infyrmity. In the Temples of Grecia in his laſt yeares, for he lacked but ten yeares of an hundred, when he dyed: at the which tyme many dyed for very grieſe. Being perſecuted of the Barbarians, among the which was Proterius of Proterius of Cephalenia. the Iſle of Cephalenia, who was reported to bee a man of much vertue and goodnes.
               Lykewiſe Ilarius, whom this wryter knew, and of Ilarius of Bithynia. 
                  Bythinia, lyuing tyll he was olde in Athens. And to to them that were voyde of other learning, he playde the Philoſopher by painting. So that Euphranor 
                  Of Euphranor, an excellent painter. Pli. 35. 11. ſeemeth not to be dead in his handes. And for this cauſe the wryter hereof had him in great reuerence and eſtimation.
               But Ilarius could not eſcape the publique calamitie, for being taken without Athens, hauing an houſe 
                     Ilarius kylled.
                  
nye Corinthe, he was ſlaine of the Barbarians, with all his familie. Theſe things by the helpe of God ſhal be ſhewed in our Hiſtories, in the which we wyll declare, not onely the lyues of particular men, but alſo the publique actions. Now what euery priuate man dyd, is tolde ſufficiently in this Treatiſe.
            
            
               Iulianus.
               
                  
                     I
                     Ʋlianus, an Orator of Capadocia, floriſhed, in Aedeſius tyme, and had 
                     Iuliane the Orator. the place at Athens. For thyther reſorted to him all the youth from euery Lande, honouring him for his eloquence and ſyngular wyt. There were diuerſe deſyrous of vertue, that aſpyred to his glory. As Apſines of Lacedemonia, hauing a name of lyberall ſcience: Epagatus, and a company of Apſines. Epagatus. other parſons. But he paſſed them all in excellencie. And the other were much inferiour. His Diſciples were many, and whether ſoeuer they went (as I may ſaye) and wherſoeuer they were diſperſed, they were had in admiration. The chiefe was, diuine Proaereſius, Hepheſtion, Epiphanius of Syria, and Diophantus 
                  Proaereſius. Hepheſtion. Epiphanius Diophātus. Tuſcianus. of Arabia. Tuſcianus, for his worthynes, is not to be forgotten: for he was familiar with him, all the which be declared in Iulianus the Emperours lyfe. This wryter dyd ſee Iulianus houſe at Athens, which was lytle and plaine. Yet ſo expreſſing Mercurie and the Muſes, that it dyffered nothing from a Temple. He left it to Proaereſius.
               
               
                  
There was the pictures of his friendes, ſuch as he loued. He had a Theatre of Marble, lyke the commō 
                  Theatre, but leſſe, as proporcionate to his houſe. There was at Athens at that tyme, ſuch a faction betweene the Schollers and the Cittizens, as in a Cittie, that within their walles, nouriſhed the peryls of their auncient warres. No Studient durſt go abroade to heare the Leſſons, but kept in priuate auditories, whether Schollers were brought to heare wordes, not contending for lyfe, but for praiſe? Many keeping ſylence, it is requiſite to take and bring this of Iulianus, for a wytneſſe and teſtimony of all his learning and conuerſation.
               It chaunced the bolde Diſciples of Apſines, to modeſt Iulianus in this ciuile tumult, with cruell and It ſeemeth, he meaneth the whyppings of the Lacedemonians.
                   
                  Lacedemoniall handes vſing them, that were in daū
                  ger of their bodies. They were accuſed as euyll dooers, and the cauſe was brought before the Vice Conſull. He ſeeming ſeuere and terrible, commaunded the Maiſter to be apprehended, and all the accuſed to be tyed, as they that were noted of murther. The Romaine ſeemed not to be vnlearned, nor brought vp in rude and ignoraunt manner. Iulianus appeared thus vexed. And ſo dyd Apſines, not by commandement, but to helpe the accuſers. The matter proceeded, and the complayntiues entred. In theſe diſordred Prouince, or charge. 
                  Lacedemonia, one Themiſtocles of Athens gouerned, cauſe of all this euyll. For by his name, he was the more proue, and bolde to deſpight. The Proconſull looked grimly vpon Apſines, ſaying: who commaunded thee to come? He aunſwered, the care of his Diſciples was cauſe of it. The Preſydent ſtayed his nature with ſylence: the accuſed entred in

bandes, and their Maiſter with them. Hauing long heayre and bodies, euyl handled, as the ſtripes might appeare to the Iudge. Whenleaue was geuen to the accuſers to ſpeake, Apſines beganne. Then ſpake the Preſident. The Romaines alloweth not this. For he that ſpeaketh the fyrſt accuſation, is in daunger of the ſecond. All the preparation being thus daſhed by the preſent ſharpnes of the Iudge, Themiſtocles the accuſer, was compelled to ſpeake. He changed collour, and bytte his lyppe full of doubt, and looked towarde friendes, and aſked what ſhe ſhould do. For they were come to make a noyſe and crye, onely when their Maiſter ſhould ſpeake. There was great ſcilence &amp; trouble. Scilence ouer all the iudgement place, and trouble for the part of the accuſers. Iulianus, with a lamentable voyce, deſyred he might be heard.
               Than the Proconſull ſayd: None of you Teachers prepared, ſhall take the matter in hand, nor any of you Diſciples, ſhall make noyſe to the ſpeaker: and then ſhall you know, how pure and ſyncere the Romaines iudgement is. Therfore, let Themiſtocles make an ende of his accuſation, and let him aunſwer whome you thinke beſt: after this no more accuſed, and Themiſtocles name was obſcured.
               
                  Iulianus, as the Preſident commaunded, to anſwer the fyrſt accuſation, ſayd thus. Thou, O Preſydent, by thine exquiſite Iuſtice, haſt cauſed Apſines, as a Pythagoream, to hold his peace, though it were late, which he ought to haue learned chiefly before. Becauſe he taught others to followe Pythagoras doctrine, which is, ſcilence. If thou geueſt me leaue to aunſwere, commaund Proaereſius, one of my friendes

to be vntied. And iudge thou, whether he hath better learned the eloquence of Athens, or ſcilence of Pythagoras. When the Preſident had graunted, and that very gently: as Tuſcianus, who was preſent, tolde this wryter, Proaereſius entred among the accuſed, without bondes. The maiſter crying to him with lowde and high voyce, as they that encourage them that go to fyght. So ſpeaking ſhryll vnto him, ſayde. Now is it tyme to ſpeake. Than he made a Proeme, which Tuſcianus dyd not tell, but onely the ſence. That it tended to moue pitie, of that they had ſuffred: and that it was mixed with a praiſe of their teacher. And that there was added in the Proeme, a reproofe of one purpoſe, declaring the ſwift maner of the Proconſulles power. That it was not lawfull that they that had bene iudged, ſhould be ſo vſed againe.
               The Preſident helde downe his head, and was amazed in his minde, at the words &amp; pithe of the matter, the myid countenance and good ieſture. All were ready to haue ſhowted, but fearing the commaundement, as a thundring, and vſing a miſticall ſcilence: Proaereſius began another Proeme, the ſubſtaunce wherof, Tuſcianus tolde, was thus. If it be lawfull to do all iniurie in accuſing, and the accuſer to be beleued, before aunſwer be made, be it ſo, let this be Themiſtocles Cittie.
               Then the Proconſull leapt out of his ſeate, caſting of his Purple garment, which the Romaines call a Trabeall Roabe, and as a young man, of ſo ſeuere, Nothing more violēt then neceſ

                  Iulianus the teacher, commaunding part to go forth,

and the accuſer, willing the maiſter to remaine alone: Than taking Themiſtocles and the Lacedemonians, he repeated the whypping of Lacedemonia, and added them of Athens. Thus continuing in fame, he dyed at Athens, among his acquaintance, miniſtring great contencion to his friendes, to celebrate his Funerall.
            
            
               Proaereſius.
               
                  
                     OF Proaereſius, is ſpoken part in 
                  Proaereſius of Ceſarea, of Capadocia. the aboueſayde, and in our Hyſtoricall Treatiſe, is declared aboundantly. But nowe we wyll ſpeake more exquiſitely of him, knowing him throughly, and being admytted to his talke and ſamiliarity. His eloquence was great and celeſtiall. I wyll not ſpeake parcially, though he were my Maiſter, and his curteſies, which cannot be expreſſed, had bounde this wryter with long and great friendſhyp.
               He that made this Treatiſe, came out of Aſia, into The Authour ſpeaketh of him ſelfe. 
                  Europe, to Athens, at ſyxteene yeares of his age, hauing a curled and thicke heayre, and for the multytude, of many whyte heayres, lyke the foming Sea, or the whyte ſyluer.
               
                  Proaereſius was then (as he ſayde himſelfe) lxxxvii. yeares of age. In eloquence he was paſſing. His aged body was ſuſteyned with the youth of his mind. So as the wryter hereof, thought him voyde of age, and as it were immortall.
               He repayred to him, as called of one that ſeemed

a God, without any buſyneſſe. He came to Piraeo at the fyrſt watche, hauing gotte a feruent agewe 
                     Pi

                        aeo, the Port of Athens.
                   by the Sea. And many other of his kynne, were come with him.
               At this howre when no thing was to be done, the maiſter of the Shyppe, which was a man of Athens, went ſtraight to the Citie, and many that lyked better that kinde of ſtudy then the other, ſtoode at the Port, where the going downe is at the pyllour, and other paſſengers went alſo. But this wryter was not able to go, therfore he was borne into the Cittie. It was mydnight, when the Sunne maketh equall night, being northwarde, and entred the Ballance, at which tyme the night watches be long. The Shypmaiſter being of olde acquaintance with Proaereſius, knocked at his gate, and brought all the company with him, as it hapneth when contention, falleth betweene two young men, that, that Schoole woulde be fylled with audience. Some of theſe, ſought ſtrength of body, ſome rytches, and ſome a meane betweene.
               This wryter being weake, had only many bookes of auncient wryters in his youth. The houſe was full of myrthe, men and women running about, ſome laughing, and ſome prouooking laughter. Proaereſius that tyme, wylled his coſyn Anatolius, for whome he ſent, to entertaine the Straungers. For he was of Armenia, which is next the Perſians: and they receyued the Gueſts, wherof ſome were their countrey men. The youth in the Bathes, ſhewed all paſtime and myrth: and when they were waſhed, they went their way.
               This wryter, for his great ſycknes conſumed, and

neyther coulde enioy the ſyght of Athons, nor of Proaereſius? Onely ſeeing the things which he 
                     •
                  eſyred, as it were by viſion. His countreymen of Lydia tooke it greeuouſly: and as one young man wyll helpe another, they ſpake of him many great things, more than trueth. Conferring together maruelous ſtraungely, there was a ſorrow in the Cittle, as of a great calamity.
               There was one Aeſchines, not of Athens, but of Aſchines. 
                  Chio, that had kylled many, in praetiſing with the ſicke and the whole. He, (as appeared afterwarde) being earneſt with them that lamented, ſayde. Let me come to geue the dead man a medicine. They were content that Aeſchines ſhould make an ende of him, that was already well nyedead. He opened his mouth with certaine inſtruments: and than he ſpake, which, by the wyll of God, was many yeares after verified. When he had receyued the medicine, his body was thorowly loſed, and he ſaw the ayre, &amp; knew his friends.
               Thus Aeſchines cleared his former faultes, by this one fact, &amp; was honoured of the Patient, and of them that were his friends. When he had done this, being honoured of all men: he went to Chio, and taryed ſo long there, tyll by the vertue of the medicine, he had gotten health, after the which tyme, the Patient kept company with the Phiſitian.
               Diuine Proaereſius had not yet ſeene this wryter, but lamented his caſe: and when he heard, he had gotten health beyonde all hope, he called the chiefe of his Diſciples, and prayſed to them the efficacie of that arte. I am glad (ſayth he) of this young mans recouery, whome I haue not yet ſeene, being greatly

grieued with his infirmity. If you wyll doo me a pleaſure, take him to the publique Bathe, and leauing your wanton toyes, vſe him as mine owne chylde. Thus this matter went, of which ſhalbe ſayde more in our Hiſtory. Notwithſtanding, the wryter thynketh that all the benefyte he got by Proaereſius, came by the wyll of God. Yet in the declaration of his lyfe, he wyll not ſwarue one whytte from the trueth. A diuine ſaying was it of Plato.
               
               
                  Trueth is the guyde of all good,
                  Both to God and man.
               
               The goodlineſſe of Proaereſius body (for now I come 
                     Plot. 5. of his Lawes. to ſpeake of him) was ſuch, though that he were olde, that I doubt, if any other were of that bewty, being of thoſe yeares. And it might be maruayled, that the perfectnes of beuty, did ſuffice ſuch a body, that had a iuſt proportion with ye greateſt. For his ſtature was bygger then a man would beleeue, yea, coniecture, for he was hygher then all other, by a foote, as he ſeemed a Gyant amongſt the talleſt men. When he was yong, Fortune droue him from Armenia to Antiochia, for he went not ſtrayght to Athens, for he wanted money, and that way, he was infortunate, though he come of honeſt parentage.
               In Antioche, he followed Vlpianus, who was chiefe teacher of eloquence there, and proſpered with the Vlp

               Both of them had but one Cloake, and three or

fowre Mantelles, which being dyed at home, ſhewed their courſenes for age. Further, being two men, they ſeemed but one, as the Poets wryght of Gerion.

               And they contended, not for cunning, but for contries, which ſhould be moſt cunning. All the laſt, as an honour, was appointed to Epiphanius. Diophantus had Arabia, Hepheſtion reuerenſing Proaereſius, let Athens and dyed. To Proaereſius, all Pontus, and Hepheſtion. the Confynes ſent auditors, honouring him, as a donieſticall God. Bithynia, and Helleſpontus dyd the lyke.
               
                  
                  Lydia now called Aſia, reaching to Caria and Lycia, and ending at Pamphilia, &amp; Taurus, and Egipt, for the excellency of learning, was to him a peculiar portion, and all that is aboue Egipt, ſtreatching to Lydia, and the vnknowen partes inhabited.
               I haue told this at large, that men may ſee euidently, the Natiōs that fyrſt ſaw them ſelues deceyued by youth, turned to ſeeke other. The excellency of Proaereſius made a great faction, which grew to ſo great contention with the young ſort, that he was forced to leaue Athens: they corrupting the Proconſull, wherby they got the vpperhande. Yet Proaereſius after great penury in his exyle, returned lyke vnto Piſiſtratus. Other men lyued by their rytches, but Proaereſius by his eloquence. As Homers Mercury, 
                  Iliad. a. conueyed Priamus to Achilles Tent, through the enimies. He had good fortune that a new Officer was come, who hearing what was done, dyd not alow it. So by the Emperours permiſſion, and alteration of voyces, he returned to Athens.
               
               His enimies, againe aſſembling, roſe againſt him, lyke ſtynging Serpents: but being preuented of his friendes, he was reſtored to Athens, as Tuſcianus, who was preſent at euery thing, tolde me, who had Tuſcianus of Lydia. bene Proaereſius, if Proaereſius had not bene. When he was come, as Vlyſſes, after a long abſence, he founde ſome of his friends in good caſe: among whome, was Tuſcianus, they could not leaue beholding of him, nor he embracing of them. And determyned to tarry the comming of the Proconſull, which was at hande. Who being come, called the Orators, and diſgraced all their doings. They had no wyll to come before him, but neceſſity compelling, he propounded queſtions

vnto them: to the which, they aunſwered euery man according to his capacitie, as they were called and inſtructed, and departed reioyſing.
               Then were Proaereſius Schollers ſodenly called in: who came, not knowing what was meant. Then ſayd the Preſident with a lowde voyce, I wyll haue you all, this day, aunſwer to a queſtion, which, when you haue done, then, ſhall Proaereſius, or at his pleaſure, ſay what he wyll. They effectually deſiring this thing, and declaring with great conſideration, ſpeeches of Ariſtides: not as things vomitted but well digeſted, the Preſident ſayd againe. Now ſay Proaereſius. He, from his ſeate, ſpake ſomewhat, as a Proeme with great grace, and when he had ended that ſpeache, which he ſpake of the ſodaine, he applied his matter to the chiefe poynt. For the which, the Preſident was ready to make an ende. Than he looked about the audience, and eſpyed of his aduerſaries a great number, and of his friends very few: whera
                     •
                   he was afrayde, as he might well be. Yet Fortune fauouring him, and ſeeing in the furtheſt part of the Schoole, the men that were great talkers, and workers of much euyll, ſayde, alowde. O God, yonder be the beſt Oratours.
               Commaunde them, O Preſident, to come foorth, paraduenture they wyll tell, they haue done naught. When they heard this, they hydde them ſelues among the people, coueiting to be cloſe.
               The Preſident, ſending ſome of his Sergeaunts, brought them foorth, and with an exhortation, appoynted them to ſpeake, in that forme, that is called, Concluſiue. When they had looked a lytle and ſpoken together: They propounded a baſe matter, rude and

harde, and voyde of all Rhetoricall ornament.
               He looked grimly vpon them, and ſayde to the Proconſull. I beſeech thee let me haue the right that was graunted me before the action. He ſayde, he ſhould not be denied right. I requyre (quoth he) ſwyft Notaries.
               That this daye, they maye noate Themis tongue, and attend vpon my wordes. He wylling 
                     Themis, the goddeſſe of true petitions. the beſt Notaries to come, they ſtoode about him, to noate his woordes: but wherefore, it was not knowen.
               Than I (ſayd he) would aſke a greater thing: which he was bidden to doo. Let no man, ſayd he, clappe his handes, at the ende of Sentences. Which being graunted with great feare to the other: Proaereſius beganne to ſpeake with flowing Oration, clapping his owne hands, at euery ſentence ende.
               The Auditours that were compelled to keepe Pythagoras ſcilence, were grieued with ſighing and groning.
               He increaſing in cloquence, and ſpeaking aboue mans opinion, came to the ſecond part of his matter, and as a man rapt in a futie: he left that he thought coulde not be aunſwered, and turned his ſpeach to the enimies argument.
               The Notaries coulde ſcarcely follow him, and the Auditours, hardly holde their peace. Such was the plenty of the wordes, turning his face to the Notaries.
               Marke dillygently, ſayde he, if I doo not remember all. Than he rehearſed all againe, when neyther The woonderfull memorie of Proaereſius.
                   the Preſident kept his owne Lawe, nor the audyence

feared the threatninges, but extolled the Oratour as a God, and all that were preſent, dyd him honour, and ſayde he was a God of Mercuries eloquence.
               His aduerſaries freating for anger, yet ſome of them coulde doo no leſſe then prayſe him. The Preſident, with all his Guarde and power, brought him out of the Theatre. And after that tyme no man durſt mute againſt him. But as they had all bene ſtroken with a lightning, they acknowledged him for the better.
               In proceſſes of tyme reuiuing againe, as the heads of Hidra, they returned to their nature, alluring ſome of the beſt ſort with great feaſtes, &amp; fayre Damiſels. As Princes that be ouercome in iuſt and ſette battell, and by deſperation brought to extremitie, they are glad of ſhotte and lyght Horſemen, which at the fyrſte they dyd not eſteeme, but nowe for neceſſitie, accept them: So theſe being feared from ordinarie helpe, layde traynes, that were lewde and vyle. Which were voyde of enuye, vnleſſe a man can hate himſelfe.
               They had many fellowes, and theyr crafte came to good paſſe. Proaereſius was in greate credyte, and his vertue in floryſhing eſtate. All wyſe men loued him, and they that went to him, attayned to knowledge.
               At this tyme, the Emperours Courte brought foorth a man, that loued both eloquence and glorye. 
                     Beritos, in Phaenitia, now 
                        
                           •
                        aruto.
                  
               
               He was of y• City of Beritos, &amp; his name was Anatolius, whom his euil willers ſurnamed Azutriona. What 
                     Anatolius, ſurnamed Azutrion.
                  
                  
this name doth ſygnify, let the madde company of ſtage players tell. This Anatolius, obtayned both eloquence and glory, and came to perfite knowledge of the law, which his countrey Berytos vſed, being a mother of that ſtudy. He ſayled to Rome, and for his pythy wiſdom and eloquence, was called to Courts, and in ſhort tyme came to great power.
               He had all Princely offices geuen him, with ſuch eſtimation, as his very enimies wondred at him, and in tyme was made great Maiſter of the Court. This Great maiſter of the Court. is a Princely office, without Purple. Fortune folowing his ambition, he was made Lieftenant of Illyria. And where he was very ſuperſtitious, &amp; geuen to Greeke facions, albeit, ſtudy of publique ſtate drew him from it: he appointed to go to the chiefe places of the Empyre, and viſyte all, euen as he would.
               Being mooued with a feruent deſyre to ſee Grecia, and the Images of the Oratours, with his owne eyes: he made great haſte into Grecia, and came thyther with much authority. Where he propounded a queſtion to the Oratours, wylling euery one to ſay his minde of it. Grecia maruayling at his wiſdome, learning, and indyfferency. Hee commaunded them to ſpeake of this queſtion, they dayly ſought to be guile one another. But when there was no remedy, they determyned the ſtate of the matter, as they call it: vpon the which, was ſuch a contention, as the wryter hereof, neuer heard a more foolyſh thing. They were deuided by difference in opinion, euery man being bent to pleaſe his audience, and prayſe his eloquence. And after the comming of Anatolius, more fearefull then the army of Xerxes, and the peryll redounding, not to the Greacians, but to the ſtudients:

all other, among whome, was Himerius of Bythinia, 
                  Himerius of Bythinia. an Oratour, tooke great paines to exerciſe their wyttes, in the ſtate of this matter. This Himerius was not knowne to the wryter, but by his Bookes. Proaereſius truſting to his witte and knowledge, was ſtraunge among them, and tolde no man his opinion.
               When Anatolius had done his Ceremonies in Athens, he commaunded the Oratours to begyn their diſputation. Then euery man ſought to preuent other in the oſtentation of their wytte. So ambitious a creature is man. Anatolius laughed at them, that ſought to pleaſe their Schollars, and pitied their Parents, that had put them to ſuch Teachers.
               Then he called Proaereſius which was onely left. He got familiaritie of Anatolius men, and learned the meaning of all the purpoſe. The which thing (as the wryter ſayde before) was to be laughted at) being of no moment, nor any rewarde of victory propounded, yet Proaereſius obeyed, as ſoone as he was called. And ſpake ſo aptly and eloquently to the thing, that Anatolius leapt out of his ſeate, and the audience was caried to cries, and there was none but thought him a God in ſpeache. So as Anatolius eſteemed him very much, and as for the reſt, ſcarcely thought them worthy his table. For he was pleaſaunt, and fine in talke at Feaſts, and there was no meale with out ſome purpoſe and learning. Theſe happened long before, and the wryter had the better tyme to heare of them.
               
                  Anatolius eſteemed much Nileſius borne in Smyrna, 
                  Mileſius of Smyrna. a Cittie of Ionia, a man of great wytte, and geuen to a ſolytary lyfe. He miniſtred in holy things, and was

without a wyfe: and in verſe and meter, of paſſing knowledge: ſo delighting Anatolius, as he iudged him one of the Muſies. He called the Rhetoricall queſtions of Epiphanius: Breakings, reprouing the barrennes, and loſt buſines in ſuch tryfles. He illuded all the inuentions of ſuch Oratours, ſaying: if there were aboue thyrteene, the problemes ſhoulde be infinite.
               Not long before, he was called of the Emperour into France, who had him in ſuch admyration, as Conſtance. he admitted him to his table among his Nobillitie. And where the men of that countrey, coulde not attayne to the inwards doctrine of his minde: they gaue their eyes to the wonder of his body, maruayling at the highnes and goodlines therof: As an high Picture, vnto the which, they could ſcarcely looke. For in all thinges he was beyonde a man. They that marked his temperaunce, iudged him without affection, 
                     Proaereſius, more then a man. lyke yron, ſymple clad without ſhoes, marueling he coulde abyde the colde of the countrey, and drinke the froſen water of the Rhene. For in all his lyfe, he neuer dranke hotte drinke.
               The Emperour ſent him to the great Cittie of Rome, for a glory, that they ſhoulde ſee, what men were ſubiect to the Emperour. They could not tell at what to maruayle moſt, all thinges dyd ſo paſſe mans nature.
               Than, for many cauſes louing him, and lykewyſe prayſing him: they made a Picture of Braſſe, of his iuſt ſtature, and dedicated it to him, with this inſcription.
               
                  Rome Queene of the worlde,
                  To the King of Eloquence.
               
               
                  
The Emperour gaue him leaue to returne to Athens, and to aſke what gyfte he woulde. He aſked a thing woorthy his nature: Ilandes, not fewe, nor lyttle, trybutarie to Athens, in paying of Corne. The Emperour gaue them to him, adding the greateſt honour, making him Lieftenaunt Generall, that no man ſhoulde enuie that he had ſo great a publique reuenew. The Preſydent had authority to eſtablyſh theſe offices, who was lately come out of France.
               
               And after theſe dyſputations, he went to Anatolius, to haue his office confyrmed, calling to Athens, all his friendes that myght congratulate with him, in his dygnitie, who reſorted without number.
               When the Theatre was full, and he requyred his acquaintaunce might ſpeake. The Preſident preuenting him, to knowe what he coulde doo of the ſodaine, ſayd. Speake Proaereſius. For it is not conuenient that other king, then he that is preſent ſhould praiſe the Emperour.
               Than Proaereſius, as an Horſe called to the race, ſpake of the gyft, and rehearſed Celeo, Triptolemus 
                  
                     Celeus, Father to Triptolemus, to whome Ceres ſhewed the way of

                        •
                     he. and the comming of Ceres with the gyfte of Corne, applying the Emperours benefite, to theſe examples.
               Than ſtrayght hee paſſed to the auncient Mannor of muniſycence, confirmed all things by examples, and declared the glory of Fame by eloquence.
               He tooke a wife of the Cittie of Trallis in Aſia. Her name was Amphiclea. They had a Daughter that lyued ſo long as there is tyme betweene the conception and the byrth. After the which tyme, he had a fayre Sonne. That made the Father glad for the tyme, but ſhortly after, fylled both Father and Mother, with heauines by death.
               
                  
As at the griefe therof, Proaereſius ſeemed to looſe all his Sap
                     •
                  ence. But Nileſius, with his muſyke and ſweete harmony, reſtored his minde againe.
               The Romaines required him to ſend his chiefe Diſciple to them. And he ſent Euſebius of Alexandria, who agreeing well with the Cittie, for he could well Euſebius of Alexandria. flatter, and pleaſe the great men, being thought ſeditious at Athens, deſpiſed others, and magnifyed him ſelfe. Therfore he ſent him thyther, as not ignoraunt of that Citties ſubtilties. For as touching his eloquence, it is inough to ſay, he was an Aegiptian. For that Nation is giuen to Poetry, inſomuch as Mercurie, when he had earneſt buſineſſe to do, would not dwell with them.
               
                  Muſonius his Diſciple, ſucceeded him in Rhetorique, 
                  Muſonius. of whome we haue ſayd aboundantly, for other cauſes, in our Hiſtories. He being appointed to aunſwere, and perceyuing with whome he had to doo, leapt into ciuile cauſes. He was put from teaching in Iulianus reigne, becauſe he was a Chriſtian, perceyuing that Ieraphantus, as the God of Delphos, 
                  
                     Ieraphātus, a teacher of holy things dyd foreſee things to come, and tell them to the requirers, that with great ſkyll and ſleyght, dyd intercept his knowledge.
               The Emperour dyd affygne Landes to learned To the G

                  r meane, learning what would follow, lyued more at quiet.
               At this tyme, the wryter being ſyxteene yeares of age, entred Athens, and was admitted his Scholler, and loued, as his ſonne. The fyfthe yeare he would

haue gone into Aegipt, but his friendes called him againe, and ſet him to the ſtudy of Eloquence, to the which euery man exhorted him. Proaereſius dyed ſhortly after, a man of ſuch quality, as all the worlde was fylled with his eloquence, and inhabited of his Diſciples.
            
            
               Epiphanius.
               
                  
                     HE was of Syria, moſt wyttie in iudginge queſtions of controuerſie, 
                     Epiphanius of quicke iudgement. but in Rhetorique not vehement. He was one of Proaereſius tyme, and attayned to great Fame. Mans nature cannot abyde one to be prayſed alone, but for malice and enuie, wherto they be enclined: they ſet vp another, againſt them that haue Fame and glory. Making principles of contraries, as they do in naturall Philoſophy.
               He dyed not very olde, of bloody diſeaſe, and his wife, a very fayre woman, ſuffred the lyke. They had no chylde. This wryter knew him not, being long before his trauaile.
            
            
               Diophantus.
               
                  
                     DIophantus, was of Arabia, following 
                     Diophātus. againſt Proaereſius▪
                     
                   Sciences. The ſame opinion of men, obiected him againſt Proaereſius, as if a man woulde ſet Callimachus againſt 
                     Callimach. a Poete of Cyrene.
                   
                  Homer. But Proaereſius laughed at theſe thinges,

and at the men that ſought eſtimation, in this behalf. This wryter knew him, and heard him many times openly declame: which to put to the writinges aforeſaid, &amp; remember, it ſeemeth not good. For the memory is of worthy men, not a wryting to be laughed at. He made the funerall Oration of Proaereſius, who dyed before him, and thus they ſay he ſpake to Selamine 
                  
                     Marathon. where Milciades ſlew 10000. Perſians.
                   and the Medians.
               
               O Marathon and Salamine, nowe you ſhalbe in ſylence. What a trompe haue you loſt of your prayſes? He left two ſonnes, geuen to pleaſure and rytches. 
                     Salamis, where Themiſtocles ouerthrew the Nauy of Xerxes.
                  
               
            
            
               Sopolis.
               
                  
                     THis wryter dyd many tymes heare Sopolis. He was a follower of y• old 
                     Sopolis, an Antiquarie.
                   ſpeeche: deſyrous to attayne to a ſounde doctrine. He knocked at the doore oft ynough, but it was open but ſyldome. A ſoft &amp; weake ſound dyd cracke from thence. A lytle diuine breath iſſewed, which pleaſed the audience. But dyd not beare a way the flowing ſtreame of the fountayne at Delphos. He had a ſonne, who they ſay, dyd aſcend to the chayre of learning.
            
            
               Himerius.
               
                  
                     Blthyria brought forth this mā. This wryter knew him not. Yet he was

                     Iulianus Emperour. 
                  Proaereſius, &amp; was wel receyued of the Emperour. Who being dead, he continued his trauayle, &amp; when

                  Proaereſius was dead, he came to Athens. He was ſweete and pleaſant in his Orations. He had a perſwading way, probable to the people, and ſometime, not vnlyke to diuine Ariſtldes. After his daughter, he dyed in his age, of the falling ſyekneſſe.
            
            
               Parnaſius.
               
                  
                     IN this tyme was Parnaſius in the chayre and teaching. Hauing ſcholers Parnaſius. that might be well numbred, yet of great name.
            
            
               Libanius.
               
                  
                     ANtioche brought forth Libanius, the chiefe Citie of that part of Syria, 
                  This part is called Coeleſyria. Antioche. Libanius, in Iulianus tyme, of whoſe praiſe he wrote a booke. that is called Holow. The worke of the noble Seleucus Nicator. He was of a good houſe, and taken with the beſt: when he was young &amp; ruler of him ſelfe, his Parents being dead, he came to Athens: neyther to Epiphanius, nor Proaereſius, that were of greateſt name, that he ſhould not be obſcure in ſuch a nūber of ſcholers, &amp; great glory of maiſters.
               Being caught with them of Diophantus, he cloue Diophātus. to him, but as they that knew him very well, affirme among the ſcholers, and familiars, he was lytle conuerſaunt, neyther tedious to his maiſter. But of him ſelfe, followed ye forme of auncient Rhetorique, which he expreſſed both in tongue &amp; minde. As they that oft do ſhoote, ſomtyme do hyt the marke. Diligence continuall in inſtruments, bringeth an arte, not a ſcience.

So Libanius by zeale, and imitation, forcing him ſelfe to follow the olde Oratours that were accoumpted beſt, made good ſteppes, and paſſed thorough the moſt of the way. Truſting in his eloquence, and perſwading him ſelfe to be equall with them that were in eſtimation: he would not be hydden in a lytle Cittie, but went to Conſtantinople, a Cittie moſt famous and wealthy, hauing neede of their wordes &amp; works, that could ſet the ſame forth. He quickly became notable there. And after a tyme returned to his Countrey. Where he continued all his lyfe, which was long. Wherfore the memory, worthy his lyfe, is ſhewed in our Chronicle, of Iulianus actes. Now his priuate doings are rehearſed.
               None of his friendes or familiars, went away without a taunt. What euery mans maner was, he well marked, and vnderſtoode his minde, whether he enclined to vertue or vice. Such a one he was, in deſcribing and vttering the condition of men, all the which he dyd with a nyppe. His familiars ſuppoſed to be in him, an other him ſelfe. Therfore his acquaintaunce ſayd, he was a table and Image, of ſundry facions.
               Neyther coulde he be perceyued of his Scholers, (were they neuer ſo many) to what part he enclined. But to contrary nature, of contrary maners, he was lyked, euen of them that were contrary to his profeſſion. So euery man dyd thinke to beholde their conditions, alone in him, not without admiration, ſo diuers formes of ſundry qualities were found in him at ones. He alſo deſpiſed mariage, yet he had a woman as his wyfe, but not of lyke worthyneſſe. His Orations were colde and barraine, without lyfe, ſo as in

this poynt, it ſeemed he was without a teacher. For the common rules woont to be knowen to chyldren, he knew not. But in Epiſtles and ſuch other lyke familiar talke, he roſe ſufficiently to the auncient forme. His wrytinges are full of grace and pleaſantneſſe of Comedy, and acumlynes is to be founde, ſcattered 
                     Syrophoenitia, the coaſt of Phoenitia
                   thorough his workes. All the Syrophaenitians hath that manner of ſpeech, which may be taken of him by learning.
               They of Attica, calleth it ſenſyble and ſharpe: He laboured this as the chiefe poynt of learning, all geuen to draw what he coulde, out of the olde Comedie, and to expreſſe it: and as it were, made of nature from the beginning, to that pleaſantnes &amp; delighting of eares. A man may finde in his Orations, exceeding learning and knowledge, full of ſweete ſpeeche, ſo as he would not haue paſſed the trees of Eupolidis, 
                  
                     Eupolis, a wryter of the old Cō

                  Deſphoſia, and Damaſia, if he had knowen the names of them, by the which men call them now a dayes. Yet he found a ſtraunge and auncient ſtyle that was hydden, as a gyft taken from the olde time, &amp; brought it abroade, cleanſing it, and making it fayre, framing an whole argument to it, with apt ſentences, as ſeruaunts and handmayds, to a new growen maiſtres, and of olde made young.
               Diuine Iulianus maruayled at it: And all men maruayled at his grace in ſpeeche. Many bookes there be of his, which maye be vnderſtanded of them that haue wytte and ſeeke them. He was ſufficient for ciuile cauſes and buſynes, and beſyde his Orations, to be bolde to performe other things touching ſights in Theatres. The Princes that followed, gaue him great offices. For they wylled him to haue the great

maiſterſhip of the Court, and ſo ſaluted him. He refuſed it, ſaying. A Philoſopher is aboue it. And this is no ſmal praiſe, that being inferiour, in glory, he would be ſuperiour in ſtudy. Thinking the other to be a common and ordinary office. He dyed very olde, leauing to all men, great admiration of him.
            
            
               Acacius.
               
                  
                     CAeſarea of Palaeſtina, brought forth Acacius, who was of Libanius time. Full of Scolaſticall contention, and ſpirit, as euer was man. His ſpeeche was lyke the olde manner with clapping of handes. Ryſing with Libanius, he got a prayſe and helde it. A booke written of Libanius, of the aptneſſe of nature, was dedicate to Acacius, in the which, he confeſſeth to be ouercome of him, by reaſon of his ſyngular hptneſſe. He wytneſſeth to him ſelfe, of the placing, and quicke ſetting of wordes, as a man ignoraunt.

                  Acacius, thus remaining for the beſt, hauing great glory and paſſing Lybanius, died in his youth. Whom men, for his learning, honoured as he had bene a very olde man.

He was borne to Eloquence, and worthy the name of an Orator. Iulianus made him his Secretarie, chiefly for the Greeke tongue. Yet Secretarie to Iulianus.
                   he was better in declamations, and diſputations: in the beginning and proceeding, not lyke himſelfe. He dyed being an olde man, and after the death of his brother Maximus.

And after him, in Proaereſius tyme, ye ſucceſſour of Zeno, who excelled both in teaching, and practiſing of Phiſicke.

                     PErgamo brought forth Oribaſius. Who ſtraight came to glory by that

He being wel borne both wayes, was famous from a Chylde, endued with all ſcience that auayleth to vertue. As he grewe in age, he was Auditor to great Zenon, and companion with Magnus. Whome he left behinde him in mouing of affections, wherin he was excellent.
               He came to the height of Phiſicke, following his

countrey God, or was poſſible for a man to do. Being young and notable: Iulianus aſpyring to the kingdome, 
                     Oribaſius Phiſitian to Iulianus. tooke him for his ſcience. He excelled ſo in other vertues, that he aduanced Iulianus to the ſtate.
               The which is more plainly ſhewed in his lyfe. But as the Prouerbe ſayth. There is no Larke without a Creaſte.
               
               So Oribaſius was not without enuie. For notwithſtanding, his excellencie, the officers of Iulianus ſpoyled him of his ſubſtaunce, and minded to haue done the lyke with his lyfe, but they reſtrayned from the miſchiefe. Otherwiſe, committing as euyll, for they appointed him to be kylled of the Barbarians, as the Athenians do them that be excellent in vertue. Yet ſuch in Athens, ſuffred as the law was, and no more. But Emperours added ſomewhat more to baniſhment, That lawe was called Oſtraſiſmus
                   being deliuered to moſt cruell Barbarians, making them Lordes of their ſentence.

Euen as they ſay, numbers, and ſuch ſcience doth.
               He got forthwith a great name of the Barbarians, and their Kinges. He was taken with the beſt. And hauing regarde to the Romaine kingdome, he was honoured among them, as a God. Hea

               He recouered his former ſubſtance, reſtored by the Emperours publique decree, which he had vniuſtly loſt by the former ſentence. And in this caſe was he. To be conuerſant with Oribaſius: he muſt be a gentle Philoſopher, that he may knowe what to eſteeme, aboue al other. Such an armony and grace, was ſhed and ioyned with al men in his ſamiliar acquaintance.

We wyll not augment the benefyte receyued, cut rather ſpeake moſt moderatly of him, for ſo it was agreed betweene vs. Chryſanthius was of the Senate, and for Nobilitie, accoumpted with 
                     Inocentius, a Lawyer grādfather to Chryſan.
                   the beſt.
               
                  
One Inocentius was his Grandfather, a man of great rytches and eſtimation, being appointed by the Emperours to make Lawes. There be bookes of his, extant, written both in Greeke and Latine. Which teſtifieth his deepe and ſtayed iudgement, and contayne knowledge of theſe thinges, for ſuch as be deſyrous of them.
               
                  Chryſanthius being left young of his Father, and geuen to Philoſophy, by his diuine nature, went to Pergamo, to the great Aedeſius. And growing in yeares, had ſuch a deſyre and thyrſt of Philoſophy, as chancing on ſuch a Teacher, as dyd geue him inough to aſlake his thyrſt, he loſt no leſſon, nor gaue place to any in dilligence. For he was of a ſounde and ſtrong body, acquaynted with labour.
               He got full knowledge in Ariſtotle, and Plato, and gaue all his minde to Philoſophy. And hauing vnderſtanded all the ſormes of the ſame, he was of inclination to obtayne eloquence, and in good way of exerciſe and doctrine. He ouercame euery enterpriſe that he tooke in hande, and had boidnes to make declaration of his proofe: apt to ſpeake, and to be ſylent alſo. And when he ſpake, to get the maiſtry, he would vſe high prayſe and pompe. After this, he went to the ſtudy of knowledge of the Goddes, and followed the Sapience that Pythagoras taught, and other that followed him. 
                     Parentinus Architas, Philoſopher. Apolonius, was of Alexandria. borne at Tyana in Cappadocia
                  
               
               Beſyde olde Architas and Tyaneus Apolonius, and them that honoured Apolonius, ſurely diuine men, yet mortall. After this ſtudy, Chryſanthius going the ſtrayght way, taking the fyrſt occaſion, by theſe principles and guides, he proſpered and attayned to ſuch a perfection of the minde, which Plato calleth a purgation,

as he gotte the full of all that ſcience to the vttermoſt, and was perfyte in all foreſyght.
               Men ſayde, he dyd better ſee, than ſpeake of things to come, as one that euer had bene preſent with the Goddes. After he had beſtowed a good tyme this waye, and coferred with Maximus very much, he Conditions of Maximus.
                   left his ſociety. For being contentious and obſtinate of nature, ſtriuing againſt the tokens that God ſent, he ſearched and wreſtled for others. But Chryſanthius by induction, when he had ſeene the fyrſt, ſtayde with the ſygnifications that were geuen, and eyther had the victory, or if he were wroong, ſupplyed it by polecie.
               And when Iulianus the Emperour, ſent for them both by one calling, appoynting ſouldiours for their honour, bringing a perſwaſion from Theſſalie, ioygned with a ne
                     ••
                  ſſitie: that it ſeemed he dyd communicate with God, and manifeſtly wrought with him, as a priuate and dayly workman of the lower ſort, to iudge the tokens of God: forbydding his going. But Maximus continued faſt in the Ceremonies, and deuoutly vſing the Sacrifyces, with cryes: he would aſke of God other tokens, to differ the deſtiny.
               And where he had ſtyll contrary tokens, and therby cauſed Chryſanthius to trye it againe: yet at length the wyll of the Goddes was manifeſted by ſygnes, and their determination many times ſhewed by Sacrifice, although the thing that appeared, was not by him, approued. So as Maximus tooke that iourney, which was cauſe of all calamitie: Euen ſo Chryſanthius taryed at home.
               At the fyrſt, the Emperour conſydered the cauſe, and coniectured, why Chryſanthius would not come, becauſe

he ſawe difficulty in the matter. Notwithſtanding, Iulianus wrote againe for him: and not onely exhorted him, but alſo moued his wyle to perſwade him to come.
               
                  Chryſanthius againe, reſorted to diuine knowledge. And the Goddes ſhewed him continually, all one tokens. The which comming oft to paſſe, and the Emperour hauing great opinion of him, gaue him the chiefe Byſhoprike of that countrey. And he knowing certainly what woulde followe, was not grieuous in his dignitie, nor oppreſſed the younger, as all in this age, were woont to do, hotly and feruently, neyther was he very extreme to the Chriſtians.
               So great lenitie was in his behauiour, that in all Lydia it was ſcarcely knowen, that there was any alteration of Religion. Wherof followed, when the chaunge came, that no new thing ſeemed to be done: Nothing ſodenly appeared to be altred, but al things ſtayed quietly, and vniformly, and without motion. And where all other were toſſed, as with the Sea, he onely was in quietneſſe, ſome of the ſodaine throwen downe, other ryſing againe, from their former myſeries.
               He was in admiration, for that he dyd not onely foreſee thinges to come, but alſo vſed well the things he knewe. This was his behauiour alwayes. So as it might be ſeene, that Socrates was reuiued againe: or that from his youth, he had immitated and followed him, and was tranſformed into him.
               A plaine and ſymple manner of grace appeared in

his ſpeeche: yet the ſweetneſſe of his wordes, dyd moue his audience. He was gentle to all in conuerſation. Inſomuch that they that went ſrom him, were thought ambitious. And as gentle and mylde verſies, do eaſily and readily enter and paſſe into euery mans eares, and moue thinges voyde of reaſon, as they ſay of Orpheus. So Chryſanthius ſpeeche was harmonious to all men, as it agreed and was fytte for ſuch a diuerſitye of manners. Yet was hee ſtyffe and ſtable in his ſentence and opinion, for the which he ſawe moſt men at controuerly. Seldome ſhoulde any man heare him boaſt of his learning, or bee thereby the more inſolent to others: what they ſayde, he prayſed, though it were not well ſayde.
               Hee allowed an opinion, though it were not of the

                  eſt, as though he hearde it not throughly, ſeeming to bee borne to pleaſe, and not to offende. If there were any motion, by the preſence of ſome learned men: and hee mynd

                  ug to ſaye any thing of the coutrouerſie, all was full or ſcilence, as though there had bene noman.

                  rogations, diuiſions, nor repetions, were requyred of him, but refrayned from diſputation and contradiction, leaſt they ſhould ſeeme to fall into manifeſt fault.
               Many that dyd but meanely knowe him, and coulde not conceyue the depthe of his minde, blamed his ſymple ſpeeche, and onelye prayſed his myldneſſe of mynde. But when they hearde him dyſpute, and wrapping himſelfe, with reaſons into pr

                  cepres, they thought him to be another manner man, than they ſuppoſed.
               
                  
So vnlyke dyd he ſeeme vnto him ſelfe, in matters of controuerſie. His heayres ſtoode ryght vp as in a feare, and his eyes teſtified, that his minde was rapt, about his doctrine. Lyuing to great yeares, he ſpent his dayes, without the cares of mans cauſes: but onely for prouiſion of familie, mayntenance of the Plowe, and gayne that was iuſt.
               He better dyd beare penury, than others plenty. His dyet was ſuch, as might be eaſily gotten. He neuer eate Porke, and ſyldome any other fleſh. Alwayes worſhipping God, he applyed the reading of olde Authors, diligently. He differed neyther in age, nor in youth. For being fowre ſcore yeares olde: he wrote ſo many Bookes with his owne hand, as few young men can reade ouer: wherby his fyngers endes, for the continuall vſe, waxed crooked. When he roſe from ſtudy, he recreated his mynde by walking ſoftly abroade, taking this wryter with him.
               He would walke a good way, but fayre and eaſily. So as it might be thought, he had paine in his feete, ſo much was hee caryed, with declaration of the trueth. Bathes he ſeldome vſed, yet alwayes ſeemed as he had bene waſhed. As touching the company of great men, hee refuſed not for arrogancie or pride, but as it may be iudged for ſimplicitie, as a man ignoraunt of power, yet he talked with them openly, and plainly.
               He taught the wryter hereof, being young, who came to him to Athens. And continued his loue towarde him, as his Childe, encreaſing it with dayly beneuolence. And ſo much encreaſed in learning this wryter, as in the morning, he taught others,

and read Rhetorique to them that woulde heare it. And after noone reſorted to his chiefe maſter to learn more diuine and Philoſophicall matter, which was not painefull, becauſe he beſtowed it vpon his deere beloued: and to him, ſo readily taking it, the worke was a paſtime.
               Than the Chriſtian ſtate preuayling, and ruling 
                     Iuſtus ruler of Aſia.
                   ouer all: One Iuſtus came to gouerne Aſia, from Rome, which was a long iourney. He being olde and of gentle behauiour, not hauing leſt the auncient rites of his countrey, but followed that bleſſed and happy manner of life, euer in prayer, and depending vpon the aunſweres of God, being the more bolde, that he proſpered ſo well therby.
               He came dyrectly from Conſtantinople to Aſia, and appoynted Hilarius an officer, who was of his owne Hilarius. opinion: And on the ſodaine ſet vp Altares at Sardis, (where was none,) and repayred the Temples that were decayed, and making publique Sacrifyce: By his letters, ſent to euery place, called all ſuch as had opinion, and fame of learning, who came to him out of hande, maruayling at him, thynking nowe the tyme to be come, that euerie man might vtter his knowledge.
               Some of theſe put their truſt in flattering, lyke chyldren, hoping that way, to get honour, glorie, or gayne. There was a publique Feaſt proclaymed, at the which all we
                     ••
                   preſent, and among others, the wryter hereof.
               
                  Iuſtus marking well, and beholding the Sacrifice which lay out of order, aſked of them that were preſent, what the forme of that manner of falling of the Hoſt, meant. Here the flatterers were ſtyrred with

a great maruayle, that he coulde diuine by Fygure, and affyrmed that he onely knew it.
               The grauer ſort, ſtryking their beardes with their fyngers endes, ſtaying their countenaunces, and ſhaking their heads, ſlowly and leyſurely, behelde the thing as it laye, and ſayde ſome one thing, and ſome another.
               
                  Iuſtus ſcarcely refrayning from laughter, turned to Chryſanthius, ſpeaking a lowde, what ſaye you olde man? Chryſanthius being nothing abaſhed, ſayde: he diſallowed all. And if you (ſayde he) wyll haue me ſpeake, what way there is of diuination: ſay you firſt what kindes you know, and of what forme, of what queſtion, and what prefixed manner, it proceedeth. And if you tell this, I wyll ſhew, what the apparance ſygnifyeth to come, before you declare this, it were a rude parte of mee to aunſwere to your interrogation, and to ſhewe of thinges to come, ſeeing the Goddes wyll ſygnifie ſufficiently, what ſhall be, and ioygne that, that is, with that which muſt be hereafter.
               By this reaſon, there ſhoulde be two interrogations, and no man is aſked at ones, of two or more, for in thinges defynite, controuerſies hath not one conſyderation.
               Than Iuſtus cryed, that he learned that he neuer knew before, and ceaſſed not from that tyme to learne that he knewe not, by conferrin

                  ayne, that of which he was ignoraunt.
               At this tyme, many that had names of learning, came to talke with Chryſanthius, moued by the fame of his excellent knowledge. But when they perceyued

that they were farre inferiour to that Maieſtie that was in him, they went their wayes.
               The lyke happened to Helleſpontius of Galatia, a Helleſpontius. verie ſyngular man, and except Chryſanthius, the chiefe of all. He was ſo deſyrous of learning, that he went to places vnknowen, to ſeeke better learned than him ſelfe. And being furniſhed with goodlye trauayle, and great learning, he came to Sardis, the olde Cittie of Lydia, to ſpeake with Chryſanthius.
               
               
                  Chryſanthius had a ſonne, of the name of his Maiſter, Aedeſius at Pergamo, of whome we haue ſpoken before, who from a chylde, enclyned to vertue, as 
                     Plato, in Phaedro, reſembleth two partes of the mind, to Horſes, and the thyrd, to the Carte
                        •
                     s. one that with wynges was created to flie to it. Not hauing but one of the Horſes that Plato ſpeaketh of, neyther a puffed minde, but quicke &amp; ſwyft to knowledge, whollye bent to the honour of God, and ſo much aboue the affections of the body, as he ſeemed almoſt to be created of the mindeonely.
               His body in mouing, was ſo delyuer, as is to be ſcarcelye credyted, as one (according to the Poets) that was caryed in the ayre. He had ſuch familiaritie with diuine matter, and that ſo eaſily, and ſo readily, that it was ſuperfluous to ſet a Garlande on his head, but looking onely againſt the Sunne, hee vttred true Oracles, and conformable to that kinde that commeth from a pure diuination. Yet he knew no verſe, nor was ſufficiently learned in Grammer. So God wrought all thinges in him. Neuertheleſſe, at the determined ende of his lyfe, he dyed: at the twentie yeare of his age.
               Than his father declared himſelfe to be a Philoſopher. For eyther the rauiſhment of his ſences made him voyde of affections, or the patience of his minde,

made him beare the loſſe of his ſonne. And the mother, hauing regarde to her huſbande, paſſed the nature of a woman, refrayning from all lamentation, though the paſſion were moſt grieuous. After theſe matters, Chryſanthius returned to his ſtudies. And many great &amp; publique cauſes chauncing, that droue mennes mindes to feare, he onely remayned without trouble, that it might ſeeme, he was not of the earth.
               At this time Helleſpontius came to him, but ſeldome entred diſputation. But when they were at it, Helleſpontius was ſo rapte, as he leſt all to abyde with Chryſanthius, and learned lyke a young man, and repented he had loſt ſo much tyme, and was ſo olde, before he had taſted of ſo healthfull doctrine. So wholly dyd he geue his minde to him.
               
                  Chryſanthius would be let blood, as he was woont: when this wryter was preſent, as he commaunded. When the Phiſitians agreed that he ſhoulde ſtryke a vaine, he attended to ſee it done accordingly. And affyrmed that it was raſhly and vnaduiſedly done, to take ſo much blood, and commaunded him to be ſtopped. For this wryter was not ignoraunt of Phiſicke. Helleſpontius hearing of it, came in great anger, and chyding, as in a great offence, that ſo much blood ſhoulde be taken from ſo olde a man. But when he ſawe him ſafe, and heard him ſpeake, he turned to this wryter, ſaying: The Cittie accuſed you of a great fault, but now they wyll be ſtyll, when they ſee the olde man ſafe, and voyde of daunger.
               This man comming after to Chryſanthius in a publique cauſe, fell ſicke by the way of a flyxe, and at Apamea in Bythinia, dyed. Commaunding his fellowe Procopius, onelye to honour Chryſanthius. Which

thing Procopius tolde, when he was come to Sardis.
               
               
                  Chryſanthius in the ſommer, the yeare following, vſed the ſame Phiſicke. And where this wryter wylled the Phiſitians that they ſhoulde tarry for him, as the maner was, becauſe he was Preſident. Yet they preuented him, and let him blood, and whyleſt he bled, he put his hand to his chyn, and a ſodaine weaknes followed, with a ſhrynking of the ſynewes. Oribaſius was called forthwith for his conning. And he with noriture and hotte things, reſtored ſtrength againe, and made him in good caſe. But age preuayled, which the next yeare diſpatched him, naturall heate being extinct, by the much vſe of fomentations. And ſo being ſicke, he dyed after the common courſe of man.
