            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

                  •
                to meete mee,

it will stand vpright, when I with Callicratides am ouerthrowne, but to shrinke in so good a quarrell, is in my opinion, more foule a disgrace then death it selfe. God knoweth I neuer vndertoke thys troublesome peece of woorke for any vaine glorie as Crassus did his Inuectiue againste Carbo, and repented him afterwardes, because it was a hatchet to hys owne libertie, setting many mens eyes a worke to watch hym; nor of any fantasticall ouer-hardinesse, as he that hauing taken a Wolfe by the eare, neither letteth hym goe; for

being assaulted; nor is able to master hym for wante of mighte: But as the Wrastler entring the liste, first tasteth his strength, by lifting some churlish peece of vveight at the armes end, &amp; therevvith as it vvere rebateth hys stomacke, for being too rough vvhen he comes to grapple; I first vveighed in my hands the aunciente Fathers of the Church, that the massinesse of theyr argumentes in thys matter might cause me not to deale so ouerthvvartlye &amp; stubbornelye, as the Defendantes of Players haue deserued. Neuertheles I thought

it necessarye to nettle one of their Orators aboue the rest, not of any set purpose to deface hym, because hee hath dealt very grossely, homely, and vncharitably vvith me, but like a good Surgeon to cut, &amp; to seare, vvhen the place requireth, for his ovvn amendment. Which thinge I trust shall neither displease your honor, nor any of the godly, in the reading, so lōg as the person vvhom I touch is (as I heare by hys ovvne frendes, to hys repentance if he can perceiue it) hunted by the heauy hand of God, and become little better than a

vagarant, looser than liberty, lighter than vanitie it selfe. The righte, for the recouery vvherof I framed these actions belongeth not to mee, but vnto God, vvhose manner is to beate dovvne the loftinesse of vsurpers, not vvyth the vvisdome of the world, or with preparation of speare &amp; shield, but with the foolishnes of the Gospel, and the nakednesse of hys truth. Therefore it had bene as daungerous for me, in this simple Confutation of our Comedies, to play with my penne by seekinge fine pouders for deintie noses, as it is

for the soldier to dally with his weapon when the battell ioynes. It is one thing to flourish, an other to fighte, one thing to bragge, another to come to handye gripes. Finding Playes of thēselues, as filthy as the stables of Augia, impossible to bee cleansed before they be carried out of Englande, wyth a stiffe streame, and the banishinge of them as worthy to be registred in the labors of Hercules as the conqueringe the monstruous wilde Bore, of Erymanthus, that wasted the countrey round about: If euer so notable a thinge bee

brought to passe it must bee done by some Hercules in the Court, whom the roare of the enimy cā neuer daunt. Whiche perswaded mee amongest all the patrones of vertue in her Maiesties court to dedicate both this &amp; my selfe vnto your honor, that your wisedome might be a countenaunce to my study, your authoritie a buckler vnto my life. Agamemnon a valiaunt Captayne of the Greekes, thought verely, that if hee might haue but tenne suche as Nestor to take hys part, it would be no trouble to sacke Troy: I haue beene

alwaies of this opinion, that if but one suche as Nestor, that is, your honor, doe no more then thruste out your hand to succour mee, let the wicked discharge their shot at my face, Playes will bee easely fired out: and I when I sleepe shall be as safe, as the childe in his cradle, whose mother will not suffer a flye to bite him. Meane while I most humbly craue pardon for my bouldnesse, in presuming, to crepe into your honours patronage: I make as much accounte of your honour, as the Atheniens did of Paralus their holye shippe,

and a dagger to my brest, the fault is mine owne, the punishmente due: But if it be the pleasure of the Almightie, rather in mercy to deliuer, then in iustice to confound; &amp; by your honorable patronage to snatch mee out of the iawes of those rauenous wolues, that haue whetted their teeth to pull me downe; I shall learne to employ my study to the glory of God, and be bound to your honour vvhilest I liue. Thus vvishing a charitable minde to them, better successe vnto my selfe, plentye of happines to your honor;

I leaue them and me to your honors consideration, and your honor to the tuition of God himselfe.

please you, but that whiche is sweete, you may well be cōpared to those nice kind of Dames which in platting of Garlands forget their thrifte, or to him whiche thinkes it impossible to quenche his thirst, if his drinks be not serude in a cup of golde: if you be contentious and ouerthwart, willinger to cauil, than to learne: contented to reade, but not to regard: to be taught, but not reformed: you are like vnto him that forsakes the Phisitian when he is cutte, and neuer permits him to finish the cure: if you be so slow, of your selues, that because writers many times doe not set downe euery thing that may be spokē, but onely pointe with their fingers to the place, where you may bee satisfied if you seeke it, you wil not trauell and study to

You know it is a notable point of folly for a man to toaste himself by his neighbours fire, and neuer bestirre him to keepe any warmthe in his owne chimnie: as great a madnes is it in manye Readers, when they are taught, not seeke to mainetaine it of their owne: whiche is, to contente themselues with the glorious blase of an other mās knowledge, whereby they outwardly get some colour in their cheekes, but within they are duskie, darke and obscure. Many thinges might bee spoken against Playes, for the vaine ostentation of a flourishinge wit, brauelie, for satisfieng thē that

I can not denie, they were both mine, but they were both pēned two yeeres at the least before I forsoke them, as by their owne friends I am able to proue: but they haue got suche a custome of counterfaiting vpon the Stage, that it is growen to an habite, &amp; will not be lefte. God knoweth, before whom to you all I doe protest, as I shal answer to him at the last day, when al hidden secrets shal be discouered, since the first printing of my Inuectiue, to this day, I neuer made Playe for them nor any other.

            Thus submitting my booke

and my self to your iudgement, I leaue to trouble you any farther, crauing this at your hāds before we parte, that if anye Player belie me in your hearing vpon the stage, you would rather consider of the person than of the speach, for a Player is like to a Marchants finger, that standes sometime for a thousande, sometime for a cypher, and a Player must stand as his parte fals, sometime for a Prince sometime for a peasant.

Whereby I gather, that the wisedome of man, is able to rule any thinge but man: for the sauage and brute beasts neither grudge to féede where they are appoynted, nor resist when they are driuen from those places, where they loue most of all to byte. But whether our eares be wilfully stoped, &amp; our eyes muffled, that in hearing, we heare, and not vnderstand; in seeing, we see and not perceiue; or whether the deuill our ancient enemie hath stricken so deepe and so venemous a tothe into the hart of man, as hath infected, and wounded the soule to death, I know not well

                and haue sufficient warrant by the worde of God, that beinge watred with the Preachinge of the Gospell, if the fruite wee yéelde bee thornes and briers, it is a very earemarke of reprobates, and of such as are giuen ouer by the Lorde, to their owne sense, to follow destruction with full saile. The worde of God is liuelie,

and mightie in operation: being liuelie, if it doe not quicken and stirre vs vp to a newenesse of life, it is a token that we haue no life, but are alreadie stone deade, in the workes of darkenes: being mightie in operation, both the plaiers and wee must be persuaded, that their idle occupation, hauing so stoute, so strong, so puyssante, so mightie an enemie as the worde of God, though the honour and authoritie of their Masters hold them vp for a time, yet in the end they must haue a fall. For neither strong holds, nor inuentions of men, nor any high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of God, shalbe able to stand, whē the foote of his Prophetes comes against it. Amongest all the fauorers of these vncircumcised Philistines I meane the Plaiers, whose heartes are not right, no mā til of late durst thrust out his heade to mayntaine there quarrell, but one, in witt, simple; in learning, ignorant; in attempt, rash; in name, Lodge; whose booke, as it came not to my handes in one whole yeere after the priuy printing thereof,

                  Ephes. 4.24.

That Stage Playes are the doctrine and inuention of the Deuill, may bee gathered by Tertullian, who noteth verie well that the Deuill foreséenge

And Thomas Lodge in that patchte pamphlet of his wherein he taketh vpon him the defence of playes, little perceiuinge how lustely ye chippes flye in his face, whilst he heweth out timber to make the frame, confesseth openly that playes were consecrated by the heathens to ye honour of their gods, which in deede is true, yet serueth it better to ouerthrow them them establish them: for, whatsoeuer was consecrated to the honour of the Heathen Gods was consecrated to idolatrie, Stage Playes by his owne confession were consecrated to the honour of Heathen Gods, therefore consecrated to idolatrie. Being consecrated to idolatrie, they are not of God, if they proceede not from God, they are the doctrine and inuentions of the deuill. This will be counted news learninge amonge a greate number of my gay countymen, which beare a sharper smacke of Italian

deuises in their heades, then of English religion in their heartes. Neuerthelesse the godly perceiue how lamentable &amp; damnable a case we stand in; lamentable, because we are so asotted with these delightes, so blinded with the loue, and drunken with the swéetnes of these vanities, that greedely we flocke together, and with our brainesicke assemblies not vnlyke to the Troyanes hale in the horse, whose mischiefe hath beene discouered by the Prophets of the Lorde, and whose bowels haue beene manye times gaged with the sword of his trueth: damnable, because we professe Christ, and set vp the doctrine of the deuill; wee holde with the hare and run with the hound, heaping vp iudgement vpon our soules by this hipocrisie. Certayne it is, that this life of ours is a continuall warrefare, a pitchte fielde, wherein, as the lickerous tounge of our mother Eue hath iustly prouoked the Lorde, to set the deuill and vs at deadly feude, so is it our part to bethinke vs of him, that neuer leaues nibling at our heele.

Though the Romans in that horrible Plague that vexed theyr City fetcht the famousest Plaiers out of Hetruria, yèt did not the Sicknes of bodie surcease, because the

delicate phrensie of plaiyng entred, but the craftines of wicked spirits foreseeing that the pestilence shoulde haue an end,

Euerie Seafaring man is able to tell you that there is greater daunger in those stormes that forbid you to shoote into the Hauen, then in them that wil not suffer you to saile at al: which policy the Deuill vsed to peruert the Gentiles. For those wicked spirites which challenging a diuinitie to them selues, were worshipped of the Gentiles, neither regarded the smoke of sacrifices, nor showe of plaies, but the men that offered vp bothe to honour them. By this meanes the Deuill driuing them from the worship of the true God, as ships from the harbour where they shoulde ryde, helde them in greater perill of death then if they had worshipped no God at all. Sithince it is manifest by all Antiquities, if we search them, that plaies are the Sacrifices of the Deuill, taught by him selfe to pull vs from the seruice of

our God, as ofte as euer wée set them vp in our Christian Cities, the Diuell, triumpheth and reioyceth therein as in thinges sacrificed by Christians vnto him.
            Because that as in the Church singing and praysing the Lorde together as hee him selfe hath instrcted vs in his worde, is a signe by whiche the true God is assured that we sacrifice our hearts vnto him with the Calues of our lippes: So the Diuell perceiuing vs to aduaunce the offringes or sacrifices of the Gentiles, after the same manner of houses, of apparell, of Stages, of Plaies, that he instructed the Gentiles by his Oracles, hath greate cause to bee merrie, and to holde him selfe honoured thereby.

I would it pleased master Lodge to remember that in cases of conscience no mans aucthoritie may stand for reason, it is therefore our duetie to weighe before we speake, whether the testimonies of other men will abide the hammeringe, when they come to be wrought by the worde of God, otherwise to take what soeuer they

say for Oracles, and muster them together in proofe of that which neither reason nor conscience doth allow, is as fonde and impertinent an enterprise, as to open our locke with the hatchet, and cleaue our wood with the key.
            But because master Lodge will needes father these wordes vpon Tullie that neuer spake them, I will first sette downe the matter, and the persons of both kindes of playes, then rippe vp euery part of this definition, that you may see how this gentleman like the Foxe at the banquet of the Storke,

            The argumēt of Tragedies is wrath, crueltie, incest, iniurie, murther eyther violent by sworde, or voluntary by poyson. The persons, Gods, Goddesses, furies, fiendes, Kinges, Quenes, and mightie men. The ground worke of Commedies, is loue, cosenedge,

flatterie, bawderie, slye conneighance of whordome. The persōs, cookes, queanes, knaues, baudes, parasites, courtezannes, lecherouse olde men, amorous yong men. Therefore Plautus in his prologue before the comedie of the captiues, desiring to curry fauoure with his auditours, exhorteth them earnestly to marke that playe, because it shall cast no such stenche of impuritie into theire noses as others doe. There is in it (saith he) neither forsworne baude, nor harlot, nor bragging souldier. Why could he not giue this commendation to all the rest? because it was the practise of the deuill, to weaue in a threed of his own spinning. Why is this rather purged of filthines then the rest? because it is the iuglinge of the deuill, to turne himselfe sometimes to an Angel of light, to deceiue vs the sooner.

If any goodnes were to bée learned at Playes it is likely that the Players them selues which committ euery sillable to memory shoulde profitte most, béecause that as euery man learneth so hee liueth; and as his study is, such are his manners; but the dayly experiēce of their behauiour, sheweth, that they reape no profit by the discipline them selues; how then can they put vs in any good hope to be instructed thereby when wée haue the sight of such lessons, but an houre or

two as they study and practise euerie daye, yet are neuer the better. Master Lodge finding some péeuish index or gatherer of Tullie to be a sléepe, is very wel contented to winke for company, and thinking his worde so currant to goe for payment, woulde gladly persuade vs vpon Tullies credite that a Play is the Schoolmistres of life.

Whether this be the practise of Poets in these dayes you may perceiue by the drift of him that wrote the play termed the three Ladies of London, which in the Catastrophe

maketh Loue and Conscience to be examined how thrie good ladishippes like of playes? Loue answeres that she detesteth them, because her guttes are tourned outward, and all her secret conueighaunce, is blazed with colours to the peoples eye. Conscience like a kindharted gentlewoman doth alow them.
            In this pointe the Poet makes so much hast to his iorneyes end, that he throwes him selfe headlong downe the hill. For neither Loue disliked them, before he had maried her to Dissimulation, whose prop
                  •
               itie is to say one thing and thinke another: nor Conscience allowed them, before he had spotted her with all abhomination, whose nature is to allowe that which is like her selfe, filthie, corrupt, spotted, and defiled. The writer of the plaie called London against the three Ladies confesseth in his prologe that he made it partly for enuie, partly for a vaine glorious minde. For enuie: because his stomack would not beare the commendations, that other men gaue to the three Ladies in his hearing.

For vaine glorie: because he straue to do better himselfe, and

                If any deformity be reprehended there, it is to be done by the players mouth, he that will shewe another man his fault, must purge him selfe first. For as they were forbidden in old time to expounde anie Oracles which had anie infection about theire bodies:
                  Plutarch.

It is not spoken in the spirit of meeknes, but with a scoffing, and iearinge spirit, altogether vnmeete for such a purpose. The white that rebukers ought to leuil at, is the recouerie of him that hath trodde awrte.

                  Colos. 3.5.
                Spiritual delight is the operation of vertue consisting in a meditation of the life to come purchased to vs by the bloode of Christ, &amp; reueiled for our comforte in the word of God. A notable blessinge is

pronounced on him whose delight is in the lawe of the Lord,

It is shame, to frequent playes, impudency to defende them; it is dangerous to fall in the enemies hande, present death to be prysoners to the Diuell; it is sinne in the Gentiles to set out Playes, in Christians it is a presumptuous sinne, because we see better wayes and take the worse, we knowe their corruption, and allowe them.

            Most of the Players haue bene eyther men of occupations, which they haue forsaken to lyue by playing, or common minstrels, or trayned vp from theire childehoode to this abhominable exercise &amp; haue now no other way to gete theire liuinge. A common weale is likened to the body, whose heade is the prince, in the bodie: if any part be idle, by participation the damage redoundeth to the whole, if any refuse to doe theire duetie, though they be base, as the guttes, the gall, the bladder, howe daungerous it is both to the bodie, and to the heade, euerie man is able to coniecture.
            We are commaunded by God to abide in the same calling wheirein we were called, which is our ordinary vocation in a commonweale. This

is the standing, which as faithfull souldiers we ought to kepe, till the Lord himselfe do call vs from it. Be we neuer so base or meane in the sight of men, yet k
