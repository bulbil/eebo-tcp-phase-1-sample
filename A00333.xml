            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            ¶ To the Right Worshipfull, the Maior, Shiriffes and Aldermen, together with all that vnfainedly feare God, and sincerely loue the truth, in that religious and famous Citie of Norwich, W. B. wisheth all outward prosperitie, with increase of heauenly grace in this life, and eternall felicity in the life to come.
            
               RIght Worshipfull, Fathers, and Brethren, as Elisha said2. King 4. 13. vnto the Shunamite (who prouided a chamber for the Prophet) Behold, thou hast had all this care for vs, but what shall we doe for thee? So may I truely say. The Citie of Norwich hath beene very carefull for me, and exceeding kinde vnto mee sometime an vnworthy Minister of Christ amongst them, but what shall I doe for them, wherby to shew my selfe thainkefull for their loue? fiue yeares it was my blessed hap (through the goodnesse of God) to reape the benefit of two very reverend &amp; godly persons then your Citie Preachers,M. Moore. M. Roberts. and now Cittizens of Heauen, (whose memorie is blessed of all that knew them, and must of me be euer honored as my Fathers in the Lord, and with them also I inioyed the labours of many learned and godly persons besides, which made your Citie like Bethel and Iericho, which mainetained2. King. 2. the Schooles of Prophets amongst them. Oh the heauenly harmony and sweete amitie that then was amongest you from the highest to the lowest! The magistrates and the Ministers imbracing and seconding one an other, and the common people affording due reverence, &amp; obedience to

them both. No matters of weight were vsually concluded in your common assemblies for the good of your Citie, before you had first consulted with your graue and godlie Preachers. It was Dauids ioy, to see the people goe vnto the house of the Lorde. And whose heart was not filled with ioy, to see in Norwich the continuall resorte that was euery day through the yeare, and that for many yeers togither vnto the holy exercises of Religion, which were continually supported by woorthy and sincere Preachers, and graced by the presence of so many graue and Religious Magistrates? And so great a meeting of learned, godly, and faithfull Pastors; aboue twenty together, of good account haue I seene vsually frequenting the holy exercises, and all hauing pastorall charges in the Cittie, besides those of the Cathedrall Church. And all these were of one heart, and one minde, all as brethren imbracing most louingly each other from the heart, boldely conuersing, and freely reioycing one with another, no man suspecting each other. Such was their care and vigilancie, yea, and such was their grauitie and modestie, yea such was their grace and humillitie, and such was their charitie, and fidelitie; but especially so well were things managed by the wisdome &amp; moderation of those two worthies before mentioned, who were still amongst the rest as presidents, or leaders of an armie, that it was not possible for any iarre or contention to be of any longer continuance then a sparke of fire produced by the violent stroke of the steele and flint, of which a man might truly say, Oritur moritur, if any were kindled with one word, the next word quencheth it againe; their heauenly doctrines were greedily receiued of you for the truthes sake, and themselues were alwaies welcome vnto you for their doctrine sake, but whether of their doctrines or their persons were in greater price with you, it is hard for me to say. Being inuited to your houses (as daily they were by one or other) they were seldome or neuer dis-ioyned, but whither some went, all went: none were excluded, to shew that you had not the word in respect of persons, but all were imbraced alike, that all might receiue incouragement

alike in the worke of the Lord: in which course of yours, whether your aboundant loue, or christian wisedom ought to haue the preheminence, I know not: passing sweet was the one, and exceeding pleasant was the other, yea gracious &amp; admirable were you in both chargeable: I confesse it was vnto you, yet such was the loue you bare to those, whose feet brought you the glad tidings of peace, that you counted nothing too deare for them. I write not thus to flatter you: the Searcher of hearts wil witnesse for me, that I speak the truth &amp; lie not, my conscience tels me that I shuld do you open wrong, if I should not acknowlege the City of Norwich to haue been alwaies as kind and louing to their Preachers, as they haue beene famous for their gouernement. In all, let God haue the glorie. As for my selfe, (the most vnworthy of all) I must acknowledge my selfe by many bands of loue to be tied vnto you, but espetially, for that in my troubles which befell me about matters of my Ministrie (though long since, yet neuer to be forgotten) it pleased you for the most part in your own persons as occasion serued, but espetially in the person of a most worthy Senator, then your chiefe magistrate (and now also a glorious citizen of heauen, to stand forth in the face of all the world for my iust defense, as also afterward when all meanes fayled, to extend your inlarged harts to the vtmost of your power for my maintenance. Abounding was your loue before, but thē it superabounded, and by the chearfull working therof it appeared to all the world, that your faith was not dead nor barren, but like Dauids blessed tree, planted by the riuers of celestiall waters, which bringeth forth his fruite in due season, without either fading or fall of the leafe; so farre were you from driuing me away (as it hath pleased Enuie to remour it home euen to the place where I dwell) that I must needs confesse, that you did labour to the vtmost of your skill, to haue kept me still amongst you, and no lesse was the care for the rest of my brethren, &amp; fellow laborers, who being in the fame predicament with my selfe, were also inforced (through the indisposition of those times) to remoue their tents from amongst you, to the general griefe of

themselues, and the most parte of your Citie, and to place them elsewhere, vpon those aggrauated rumours posted after me by the malignant messengers of the enuious man, it hath bin my happc (God purposing for my good I trust to haue it so) to be not alittle sifted in this countrey, where it hath pleased the Lord of his goodnesse to place mee: to which end, there hath beene also posting from hence vnto you for coppies of records and I wote not what, assuring themselues, that from thense would come such shot that would batter downe my hold, and make me quite to giue ouer; and no lesse in boasting manner most confidently they gaue out amongst themsel

               es. But God be thanked, who suffered them like deluded soules, no lesse foolish then malitiously to triumph before the victorie: and my feare is, that those men which traueled so far, and searched so neare, and were at such cost and raked (as it were) so many backesides, and troubled both themselues, and others, and all for the finding, and reuiewing of an old rotten coffin (so many yeares since buried with a blocks end in it, sor want of a better co
                  •…
               se) haue receiued the most hurt themselues: for some of them (besides the forfiture of their credit which they pawned vpon the bargaine) haue prooued since that, like cloth that shrinkes in the wetting, and hauing borrowed till no man will trust them, are glad to liue where no man doth know them, shifting for themselues tanquam indiuidua vaga, which are vix demonstratiua in their owne countrey, wherof I take no pleasure at all, for I haue alwaies wished them more good then they doe themselues: and I hope, the rest of their confederates will make good vse of their fellowes falls. But as for you, right Worshipfull, and in the Lord intirely beloued, your hearts, and hands haue euer bin free from such kinde of practises, and blessed be God that hath euer kept you from casting in your lot amongst them, whose deuising hath bin still to spreade nets for the innocent and simple man: and as the remembrance of your antient loue doth much reioyce me; so is my ioy much more increased, through the constant continuance of your loue, which by many signes and tokens, did most plentifully appeare,

when (after many yeares discontinuance) it pleased the Lord of his goodnesse, to bring mee amongst you againe. And now, beloued in the Lord, what remaineth, but that you continue your antient &amp; holy courses, that so the fame of your faith, loue, and zeale, which is spread farre and neare, may increase yet more and more, to your euerlasting commendation. And if you haue still the holy assemblies and sacred exercises of religion continued amongst you, as I hope you haue, I beseeeh you be thankfull vnto God for them, and make your best vse of them while you may. And you that be the worthy Senatours and gouernours of that Citie, let me intreate you to follow the good example of your predecessours, grace the holy assemblies with your presence, and goe before the people to Gods house, as Dauid did in fetching home the Arke; incourage your Pastors and Preachers still, and shew forth the power of religion in your holy conversation and good gouernment, as you haue done. And my good brethren which be of the ministerie in that Citie, if I haue found grace in your eyes, and may be counted worthy to aduise you in the Lord, be you all of one heart and of one minde in the Lord. And I beseech you forget not the holy counsell, which one of your antient Fathers and Pastours wasM. Moore. wont oftentimes to put you in minde of; though there may be some difference in opinion, about matters of circumstance and lesse weight, yet let there be no difference in brotherly affection, but loue one another in the Lord from the heart, remembring that of the Apostle: If any be otherwise minded, God shall reueale it vnto him in his good time: and let none be too forward in rushing into the heart and conscience of his brother, for that is (as you know) Gods prerogatiue, but rather imitate the Lord himselfe, who said; if Solomon did sinne against him, he would visite2. Sam 7. him with the roddes of the children of men: but yet his louing kindnesse and mercy, he would not take from him. So, though there may perhappes arise some hote disputes amongst you, about this or that, and in heate, you may perchance sometimes strike too hard, and make the sparkles

               
                  •…
               ie too fast; yea, cause may be giuen sometime to reprehend one another roundly, as Paul did Peter, yet let charitie &amp; louing kindnes neuer depart frō amongst you, &amp; the God of peace shall blesse you as he hath done, to the wonder of the world. I know you are already established in the present truth, and therefore neede none of my instructions: yet, for somuch as sound faith hath neede of a strengthning, and a pure minde, of a stirring vp, and a wearie heart, of a warming, I beare my selfe somewhat bold vpon your Christian patience, to write thus vnto you as I doe. And now (right Worshipful, and the rest of your Citie beloued in the Lord) for a testimonie of a heart that would be thankfull, if my velle &amp; posse, would be sutable the one to the other, I doe heere offer vnto your Christian consideration, &amp; curteous patronage, these Dialogues, which I haue at times, for my owne recreation, translated out of Latine into english. And because they containe varietie of matters, therefore I dedicate them to your whole Citie, which also comprehendeth varietie of wits and dispositions. I trust you will accept them in good part, as you alwaies haue done my selfe, and all my poore and slender indeuoures in former times: which if you doe, you shall incourage me to labour heereafter, in arguments of greater moment, if greater may be. In the meane time, I commend you to the grace of God. And as I haue you alwaies in remembrance in all my prayers, so I beseech you, forget not mee in yours, nor the whole Church of Christ, that so the communion of Saints, may not sound onely in our lippes, but may bee powerfull in our hearts, and fruitfull one towardes another, vntill wee shall all fully inioy that blessed fellowshippe of the Saints, which the Lord Iesus Christ, our head and blessed Redeemer, hath purchased with his blood, and reserued for vs in the heauens, Amen.

               GOod Reader, here I exhibite vnto thy view, certaine Dialogues, compiled first in Latine by that famous man Erasmus, and now by mee translated into English, for the generall good of our Church and Common-wealth: not absque delectu, or hand ouer head (as they say) haue I gathered them, but according to the Apostles rule, I haue tried all, and chosen the best. If thou wilt but enter into them, thou shalt find so delightfull and fruitfull a walke, that thou wilt hardly retire vntill thou hast gone through. They are full of doctrines, both sound and substantiall. Repleate they are with sent

Of learning both diuine and humane, thou shalt haue thy fill: Both pleasure and profite will entertaine thee at thy entrance, and recompence abundantly thy trauell all the way thou goest. What should I say more? Good wine needes no Iuy bush, and Erasmus, hath no need of my commendations. To the learned and iudicious, yea generally to all men, he is so wel knowne for his deepe learning, and profound iudgement: that for the entertainment of th

and beating themselues one against another for want of food, ended their miserable and wofull dayes: a thing able to break a heart of flint. This midwife being demaunded whether she spake this vpō hearesay or no, did protest that she was an eie witnesse thereof her selfe, and saw them all three laid forth vpon a boord together. The hearing whereof caused some watry eyes, and bitter sighs. This cruell murtherer answered the Law, but she could not giue the poore Infants their innocent blood againe.

            The Printer to the Reader.
            COurteous Reader, there haue in this impression some faults escaped, whereof I must acquite the Author, and pleade thy pardon for my selfe, he being both absent, and vnacquainted with the sodaine publication of his booke: and I, sometimes mis-led by doubt and difficulty of the copie. The number and moment of them is not so great, but I hope thy kindenesse will be greater, in giuing what thy selfe (as being a man) doost somtimes neede, excuse of errors.
         
      
      
         
            
            
               ❧ A dialogue of Fish-eating, both pleasant and profitable, wherein are many excellent poyntes of Divinitie discussed, but chiefly that of the right vse of thyngs indifferent, very necessary for these times.
            
               The Speakers are onely two.
               1 Lanio, that is, a Butcher.
               2 Salsamentarius, that is, a Fishmonger.
            
            
               Butcher.
               
                  HOw now lusty Fishmonger? haue you yet bought you a rope?
            
            
               Fishmonger
               A rope Butcher, what to doe?
            
            
               Bu.
               What to do? to go hang thy selfe.
            
            
               Fish.
               Why man, I am not yet weary of my life.
            
            
               But.
               But you will be ere it be long.
            
            
               Fish.
               Why Butcher, what is the matter?
            
            
               But.
               If you knowe not, I wil tell you. There is comming towards you, a very Saguntine famine (as they cal it) that will make you euen goe hang your selues.
            
            
               Fish.
               Good wordes Butcher, let this come to our ennemies: how commeth it about, that of a Butcher you are so sodainely become a diuiner of such great calamitie?
            
            
               But.
               It is no diuination, doe not flatter your selfe, the

matter is euident, and the thing it selfe is already in the open market place.
            
            
               Fish.
               You trouble my minde much, fhew it mée if you haue any thing.
            
            
               But.
               I will shew it you to your great griefe: There is of late come forth an edict from Rome, that from henceforth it shal be lawful for euery man to eate what he list. And wat then remayneth to you and your order, but an insatiable hunger with your rotten salt fish?
            
            
               Fish.
               For my part, I care not if any man do list to eate snailes or netles, let him: but is any man forbidden to eate fish?
            
            
               But.
               No, but there is libertie graunted to all men, to eate flesh that will.
            
            
               Fish.
               If this be all, then goe thou and hang thy selfe: for I hope to gayne more héereafter than euer I haue done.
            
            
               But.
               Yea, great comming in, but hunger to the full: or if you had rather heare more merry newes, henceforth you shall liue more cleanely, neither shall you vse to wipe your snotty nose, which is euer itching with scabbes vpon your arme, as you were wont to doe.
            
            
               Fish.
               Ha, ha: now we be come to the toppe: the blinde reproacheth the one-eyed, I would it were true that you tell me, but I am afraide you doe but féede me with a false ioy.
            
            
               But.
               That which I tel you is too true, but whereupon do you promise to your selfe greater gaine?
            
            
               Fish.
               Because that the world is come to that passe, that looke what is most forbidden, that men do most of all desire.
            
            
               But.
               And what of that?
            
            
               Fish.
               Because more will abstaine from eating of flesh, when there is libertie giu

               You should séeme to be all salt, by your vnsauorie spéech.

               Fish.
               Tell me then (maister Hippocrates) why in good gouerned Citties it is forbidden to kill bulles and swine within the walles? And it were more for the health of the Cittizens, if there might be no cattell killed within the walles. Why haue Butchers a certayne place allotted them to dwell in, for feare that if they should dwell euery where, they would soone infect the whole Citty with the plague? Is there any kinde of stinch more pestilent than the corrupted blood and dregges of beasts and other liuing things?
            
            
               But.
               These things be very swéete spices, if they be compared with the rotten sauor of fish.
            
            
               Fish.
               To you I thinke they be méere spices, but not to the Magistrates which haue remooued you from the Cittie. And howe swéetely your slaughter houses doe smell, let them declare that passe by them, holding their noses: yea aske the common people, who had rather haue tenne bawdes dwell by them then one Butcher.
            
            
               But.
               But neither pondes nor whole riuers will suffice

to wash your rotten salt fish: and it is truely said, that you spend water in vaine, for a fish alwayes smelleth like fish, though you should besméere it with swéet oyntments. And no maruel though they smel so when they are dead, for the most of them do smel so soone as they are taken. Flesh béeing powdred in brine may be kept very swéet many yéeres together, and common salt wil preserue it from smelling: being dried in the smoake and the wind, it gathereth no ill sauour. If you should do al this vnto fish, yet it would sauour stil like fish. By this alone you may coniecture, that there is no rotten sauor to be compared vnto that fish maketh. And fish corrupteth and putrifieth the very salt it selfe, whose nature is to preserue things from putrefaction, whilest by his natural force it both shutteth and bindeth, and also excludeth and kéepeth out whatsoeuer might hurt outwardly, and drieth vp inwardly whatsoeuer might putrify the humors. In fishes onely salt is not salt. Some dainty or delicate person perhaps doth hold their nose when they goe by our sla

And, if it were possible, that pure salt fish could be brought into the citie, as we doe the flesh of beasts that we kil, yet the Lawe would not sléepe: but no

And further, that paradise stoode in a most commodious and healthful ayre. And I do thinke that such bodies in such places, yéelding on euery side a sweete ayre, by reason of the swéete hearbs, trées and flowers that there did growe, might liue long without any meate, and the rather, I thinke so, because the earth abundātly powred forth euery thing of it own accord, without the labor of man: for the dressing of such a garden was rather to be counted a pleasure than a labour.

               Gods law is perpetuall. And Christ saith; he cameObiect. not to breake the Law, but to fulfill the Law. How then durst they that came after, to abrogate a good part of the Law?
            
            
               Fish:
               That Law was not giuen to the Gentiles: andAnswer. therefore it séemed good vnto the Apostles, not to burthen them with circumcision, (which theIewes obserue vnto this day) lest they should (as the Iewes also doe) place the hope of saluation in bodily obseruations, rather then in faith and loue towards God.
            
            
               But:
               I omit the Gentiles. By what scripture prooue you that the Iewes (if they would imbrace the profession of the Gospel) should bee frée from the bondage of Moses Law?
            
            
               Fish:
               Because the Prophets did fore-tell, that God would make a new couenant with them, and giue them a new heart, and they bring in the Lord, abhorring the festiuall daies of the Iewes, refusing their sacrifices, detesting their fasts, reiecting their offerings, and desiring a people of a circumcised heart. The Lord himselfe confirmed their

prophecies, who giuing his body and his blood vnto hisThe choyce of meates abrogated. Disciples, calleth it a new Testament. Now if nothing were abolished of the old, why is this called a new▪ The choice of meates is abrogated, both by Christs example, as also by his word, who saith; That man is not defiled with that which goeth into the belly, &amp; is cast out in the draught. The same was shewed to Peter in a vision; yea, and Peter himselfe with Paul and the rest, eateth common meates forbidden by the Law. This matter is handled by Paul in all his Epistles, and without doubt, the Christian people to this day doe follow the same rule, as deliuered them from the hands of the Apostles. Therefore the Iewes are not onely fréed from the superstitious obseruation of the Law, as it were from milke, or food that they were familiarly vsed vnto, but now they are driuen from it as a thing out of season. Neither is the Law abrogated, but onely some part of it is commanded to cease, which now would be idle, or in vaine, which may be illustrated by some familiarSimilies. similitudes in the course of Nature.

               It was abrogated in parte, and that for two causes.
               First, lest Iudaisme shoulde (as it did beginne) ouerwhelme the glory of the Gospel.
               Secondly, lest through the rigour of the ceremoniall Lawe, the Gentiles should be kept backe from Christ, among whom were many weake ones, who were in daunger of a double inconuenience, if some part of the Law had not béene taken away.
               First, they might else haue beléeued that no man could be saued without the obseruation of the lawe.
               Secondly, they might otherwise perhappes choose rather to remayne still in their Paganisme, than to vndergo the yoke of Moses lawe.
               Therefore it was méete to allure and catch those weake ones, with a certaine baite of libertie.

               But.
               Your reasoning is grosse enough, or (if you will)Humane obseruations to be arbitrary, and why. substantiall enough: but mée thinkes there are causes enow why their carnall obseruations should be now taken away, or at leastwise be left arbitrary to euery mans conscience and discretion.
            
            
               Fish.
               Why so?
            
            
               But.
               Oflate I sawe the whole worlde pictured vpon a linnen cloth, but very large, there I sawe how small that part is which doth purely and sincerely professe Christian religion, namely one corner of Europe reaching westward, and parte of it towardes the north, and a third parte tending (but afarre off) toward the south, and the fourth reaching to the eastward séemed to be Polonia. All the worlde besides containeth either Barbarians, not much differing from bruite beasts, or Schismatiques, or Heretiques, or all.
            
            
               Fish.
               But you sawe not all that part which lieth southward, and the dispersed Ilands, noted for woorthy christains.
            
            
               But.
               I saw them: and I learned, that from thence many preys haue bin taken: but that christianitie was planted there, I heard not. Sith therefore the haruest is so great, I woulde thinke that this were the best way of all for to plant religion there, that as the Apostles tooke away the burthen of Moses Law, lest the Gentiles should goe backe againe; so now also to alure the weake ones, it were fit to remoue the bondage of certaine things, without which the world stood well enough at the first, and now might continue as wel, if there were that faith and charity which the Gospel requireth. Againe, I sée that there bee many which doe place the chéefest part of piety in the obseruation

of places, garments, meates, fasts, gestures, and singing, and by these things do iudge their neighbour, against the rule of the Gospel, from whence it commeth, that when all things should be referred to faith and charity, by the superstition of these things, both are extinguished. And farre is he from the faith of the Gospel, that trusteth to such things: And farre is hee from Christian charity, that for meate and drinkes sake, will gréeue his Christian brother, whose liberty Christ hath purchased with his blood. What bitter contentions doe we sée amongst Christians? What deadly reproaches about garments of this fashion, or that fashion, and about the colour of garments, and about meates which the waters yéelde, and which the fieldes yéelde? If this mischéefe had infected but a few, it might be contemned: but now the whole world we sée is at deadly centention about them and the like. If these things wer

               2 Againe, amongst the lawes of men, there are found oftentimes wicked, foolish, and pestilent lawes, where
                     •…
                  pon they are abrogated, either by the authoritie of the higher power, or by an vniuersall neglect of the people. In the lawes of God there is no such matter.
               3 Againe, mans law doth cease of his own accord, when the cause is ceased for which they were made.
               4 Againe, mans law is no law, vnlesse it be approued by the consent of the people. The law of God ought neither to be examined, neither can it be abrogated. And albeit Moses in giuing the law gathered the voices, and required the consent of the people, yet this was not of necessitie, but to make them the more guiltie, and to leaue them without excuse if they did breake them. For it is an impudent part to contemne that law which thou hast approued, by giuing thy voyce and consent.
               5 Lastly, forsomuch as the lawes of men, (which for the most part prescribe bodily things) are inducements to godlinesse,

they séeme then of right to cease when any man is growne to the strength of a spirituall man, that nowe hée néede not any longer to be bounded in with such railes or bounds, so that to the vttermost of his power he be carefull, not wittingly to offend the weake ones, nor malitiously to offend those that are superstitious. As if a father, for the better preseruing of his daughters virginity vntil she be married, doth charge hir, while she is a virgin, that she drinke no wine: but when she is growne to be of yéeres, and married to a husband, she is no longer tied to her fathers commaundement.

some daies together, at last he beganne to amend, vntil a certaine damsel tolde him what it was, then he began to cast vp that which he had eaten. But the same man that was so superstitious in egges and milke, made no conscience of forswearing a debt that he owed me: for when I in simplicity sent him his bill, he secretly with his naile cut it and rent it, and sware it was cancelled. What more peruerse then this iudgement? he sinned against the minde of the Church, in not obeying either the Bishop or the Phisitians, and in manifest periury he had a firme conscience, that was so weake in a messe of milke.

If the same persons should at the same time but mend a shooe, or eate a pigge vpon a Friday, they should bee seuerely punished for a most deadly sinne. And yet the Lords day was chéefely ordained to this end; that men might be at leasure to heare the doctrine of the Gospel, and therefore are men then forbidden to worke bodily worke, that they might be at leasure to informe their mindes with the wil of God.

I haue heard that the lawes of the church do expressely except children, old folks, sicke persons and weake, great labourers, women with child, giuing sucke, and very féeble.
            
            
               
                  But.
               And the same haue I also often heard.
            
            
               Fish.
               I haue also heard of an excellent Diuine, Gerson I thinke his name is, that hath added this, that if there bée any cause of the like moment, with those which the canons of the Church do except by name, that then also the force of the law doth cease. For there be peculiar habites of states of mens bodies, which do make the restraint of meat more daungerous than an euident disease. And there be secret diseases which yet do not appeare, which in truth may bée so much the more dangerous. And they which compel children, or very old folkes, or sicke and féeble persons, either to taste, or to eate fish, doe commit a double sinne, first against brotherly charitie: Secondly, against the mind and meaning of the Church, which would not haue them wrapped in a law, which cannot keepe it without their owne destruction, or danger.
               Whatsoeuer Christ did institute, he instituted it to the health both of soule and bodie, neither can any potentate chalenge vnto himselfe so great power, as that by his constitutions he may driue any persons to endaunger their liues. As if one by fasting one night, should not be able to sleepe, and for want of sleepe, should be in danger of a frenzie: he that shal driue a man to this inconuenience, is (both against the minde of the Church, and against the will of God) a murtherer of his neighbor. Princes so often as they sée cause, do make lawes to punish men by death: whatPrinces may punish by death. they may do I do not define; this I thinke I may say, that they should deale more safely, if they did not punish any by death, but for such causes as are expressed in the holy scriptures. In heynous crimes, the Lord doth call men away from the vttermost bond of circumstance that may leade thereunto, as in the case of periurie, he forbiddeth to swear at all; to kéepe men from murther, he forbids men to be angrie. We for a humane constitution doe driue men to the vttermost bound or verie point of manflaughter. But so often as there appeareth any probable cause, it is the part of charitie to exhort our neighbours, vnto those things which

the weakenesse of his bodie doth require. And if there appeare n
                     •…
                   cause, yet it is the dutie of christian charitie, fauourably to interpret the matter, that it might be done with a good minde, vnlesse he that wil eate, shall shew therin a manifest contempt of the lawes. And such as shall contemptuously, and seditiously, eate any thing that is forbidden by law, the ciuill Magistrate doth iustly punish. But what euery man may eate in his own house, for the health of his bodie, it is for Physitians, and not for Magistrates to determine.
               But if hereupon also any shall be so wicked as to raise any tumult, let him be guiltie of sedition, and not he that prouideth for his bodily health, not breaking either Gods law or mans law. And such is the lenitie and moderation of the Church of Christ, that vpon good cause, they will of their owne accord stirre vp men to vse such things as the health of their bodie shall require, and which their licences or charters wil also arme men against the accusations and backbitings of ill disposed persons.
               It may be called zeale, if any man shall deale seuerely with his owne body, for euerie man is best knowne vnto himselfe; but where is the pietie, or where is the charitie of these men, who contrarie to the law of nature, contrarie to the law of God, and contrarie to the meaning of the Church, would enforce their weak brother vnto death, or to some kinde of disease more cruell than death it selfe?

               Oh that word seruant sticketh sore in your stomack, but marke, my good Xantippe, of seruants there be two sorts, bond seruants, and frée seruants: now though you are to serue and obey your husband, yet it is not the nature of a bond or

               Not so, good friend, now you mis-take: for though we be frée of our husbands, &amp; all that they haue, that is, of bed, and boord, and familiarity, and maintenance from them, yet it doth not follow, that therefore we must not obey them, or that we may be our owne caruers of that which they haue at our plesure, and whether they will or no.

               Because we are vnder a law, which hath made vs subiect to their power and authoritie. For though a man bée a noble man, and a Lord, and hath tenants vnder him, yet is he also a subiect, and must obey his Prince, as one that liueth vnder a law: and yet though a Lord, or a fréeholder are to obey the law, and to doe seruice for their Prince, yet are they not in the nature of the Princes hired seruants, or bond seruants, which are daily about him, and take wages, but are as frée subiects, and do enioy their goods and lands, &amp;c. vnder the Princes protection, and liue in great liberty, and are called by their Prince with swéet words of great loue, &amp; princely kindnesse; as, our louing subiects, and sometimes, our trustie &amp; welbeloued, if they be of their Councell, but not, our louing seruants: so they write to those that are of their houshold and serue for wages.

               First, in my care of domestical affaires, which is the peculiar prouince of Matrons, I was very vigilant and careful, not onely that nothing was pretermitted, but also, that euery thing was a gréeable to his liking, euen in the smalest things: as for example; If my husband loued this or that meate better then another, or i

The same course I tooke, if at any time I saw him come home more in drinke then ordinary. And for that time I would speake of nothing but pleasant matters, and onely by flattering and faire spéeches, I would draw him to bed.

By and by his conscience was touched, and he beganne to suspect that this was his wiues doing. Being returned home, he asked her if she had not béene there, she did not deny it: then he demanded of her to what end she sent that stuffe thither? husband (quoth she) you are vsed to lie and fare better at home, I saw that you were but homely vsed there, and I thought it my dutie, (when your pleasure was to lie there) to see you haue better entertainement.

               It may bee so: but in the meane time, there is a perpetual warre betweene you, and it is a hundred to one that he wil neuer loue you for it.

               First, you must swallow vp all iniuries that your husband offer you, and his affection must be by little and little wonne, by duties, and kindenesse, and méekenesse, and mildenesse, and so you shal at last, either ouercome him, or vse him more commodiously than now you can.

For if that place which is consecrated to the putting away of all offences, and to the restoring of loue, be profaned with strife and gréefe, then all remedies of reconciliation are gone.
               And there be some women so froward, that euen in the very act of generation, they wil be brawling, or sullen, and malcontented,

               They are true indéed, my Sophronius, almost all that thou sayest. But where gatest thou this sanctimonie, which wert woont to be the wantonnest of all wantons? No man did euer more often resort hither, or at more vnseasonable houres than thou hast done. I heare say you haue beene at Rome.

               I thought what reuerend ones they were. But feare not, you shall tell it to a stone.

               But by such beggers I gaine more, then by you rich folke.
            
            
               So.
               I know that well enough, for they spoile honest matrones to bestow it vpon wicked harlots.
            
            
               Lu.
               But go on with your booke.
            
            
               So.
               So I will, and it is best of all. There Saint Paul (who cannot lie) taught me, that neither whoremongers, nor fornicatours shall inherite the kingdome of heauen. When I had read that, I began thus to thinke with my selfe: It is but a small thing that I looke to get by my fathers inheritance, and yet I had rather renounce all whoredomes, and harlots, then to be dis-inherited of my father. How much more should I take héede that I be not dis-inherited of my heauenly father? And yet against my father (if he shold dis▪ inherit me) I might be relieued by the laws of men; but if God should dis-inherite me, I haue no refuge to flie vnto. Therefore I did fully resolue with my selfe wholy to renounce all harlots.
            
            
               Lu.
               If you can containe your selfe, it is well.
            
            
               So.

                  GOd saue you my déere Fabulla.
               
            
            
               Fab.
               And you too Eutrapilus, but what is the matter that you come now to salute me, which none of vs haue séene this thrée yéere full?

               I wil tel you, by chaunce I (passing by these houses) sawe the crowe or the ring of the doore bound about with a white linnen cloth, and I maruelled what the reason of it should be.
            
            
               Fab.
               Are you such a stranger in this countrey, that you do not knowe the reason of that? doe not you knowe that it is a signe that there is a woman lying in where that is?
            
            
               Eut.
               O wōderfull! is it not a prodigious thing to sée a white crow? but in good sadnes, I knewwel inough, that that is the maner where a woman lieth in, but I could not once īuspect that, you being so yoong a damsel, scarse yet sixtéene yeares olde, had so soone learned that most difficult Arte of getting children, which oth

               Eutr.
               So may you wel be called Fabulla, for you are neuer without a fable. But as I was thus musing at the matter, in good time I met with him that hath had so many wiues.
            
            
               Fab.
               What, he that s

                   lately buried his tenth wife?
            
            
               Eutr.
               The very same: but ile tel you, (that which perhaps you are ignorant of) he goeth a wooing againe as prowdly and lustily as if he had neuer bin married: And I asked of him the reason of this white crowe. There is (quoth he) in this house, a woman cut in two, or diuided by the middle, what hainous offence (saide I) hath she committed? And if it be true (quoth he) is bruited by the common rumour of the people, the good wife of the house hath flead her husband, and with that went laughing away.
            
            
               Fab.
               He is a pleasant companion after his rude manner.
            
            
               Eutr.
               I came forthwith in, to gratulate or reioyce with you for your happy birth.
            
            
               Fab.
               So you may if you wil Eutrapilus, but then you wil reioyce for my happy birth, when you shall sée in that which I haue brought foorth, a token of a good man.
            
            
               Eutr.
               Thou speakest both godly and truly, my Fabulla.

               Eut.
               To Petronius only, you bring forth, but I suppose you do not liue to him alone. But for this also am I glad, and do reioyce with you, that you haue brought foorth a man childe.

               This is not the first time I haue heard of these things, but are they as truly as commonly reported?
            
            
               Fab.
               They are too true.

               Will you haue me then to perswade your husband, that from henceforth be shall not meddle with you? For so shal you be sure to be frée from this danger, Fabula.
               
            
            
               Fab.
               Surely I desire nothing more willingly, if you can bring it to passe.

               If you please to haue it so, let it be so, and whatsoeuer caution or assurance else you can deuise.

               And why may it not be done now rather, according to my minde?
            
            
               Eut.
               I will tell you, because I feare that after a month, you will be of another minde, and then both you must double your reward, and my paines also will be doubled in perswading and disswading.
            
            
               Fab.
               Well then, let it bée euen as you will for me: but in the mean time go forward, and shew why the male sex should be more excellent then the female?

               Oh, I perceyue Fabulla, that you haue studied this matter, and come prepared for this combate, and therefore for this time I thinke it my best course, euen to giue you the Bucklers, I will deale with you after an other manner, and I will be armed too, neither will I come without a Souldier to helpe me, for when the matter is tried onely by the tongue, surely one woman will be too hard for seuen men.
            
            
               Fab.
               Certainly nature hath armed vs with this weapon, although you men be not tongue-tied.

               Fab.
               Away trifler: he is with his nurse.
            
            
               Eut.
               What nurse doe you speake of? hath he any other nurse then his owne mother?

               Yea, why not? that is the common maner now.
            
            
               Eut.
               When you speake of the common manner, Fabulla, you name the woorst author that can be, of a thing that should be well done: for commonly men sinne, the common maner

is to play at Dice; the common manner is to goe to whoorehouses; the common manner is to deceiue, to be drunken, and to riot.
            
            
               Fab.
               It seemed good to my friendes to haue it so, for they thought it meete to spare mee yet, being of so tender yeares.

               Yes, I doe beléeue it.

               Why then do you willingly resigne more then halfe your title of Mother vnto another woman?

               You speake of things to be abhorred.

               By this you may perceiue, that within the brainepanne doe lie the instruments of vnderstanding, of will and memory, which be not so grosse or thicke, as the eares and eyes, but yet material.

First, if the body be that to the soule which the garment is to the body: how much the garment makes to the health of the body, Hercules hath shewed: to say nothing of the colours of haires and kindes of skinnes. But whether one soule may suffice to we are out many bodies, as one body doth to weare out many garments, I leaue that to Pythagoras to tell.

               And why may not that also come to passe, that your sonne may loue you but to the halfes, whenas that natiue loue is as it were distracted, &amp; diuided betwéen two mothers? neither can you be caried with the like natural affection toward your son: As he groweth in yeares, so he shall be more vnwilling to obey your commaundements, and your care will be the colder towards him, in whose behauiour perhaps you shall sée his nurse. And the chiefest step to learning, is the mutuall loue that is betwéene the teacher and the schaller. Therefore, if he shall loose nothing of that swéete sauour which naturall affection yéeldeth, you shall the more easily drop into him the precepts of liuing well: For here the mothers helpe is not small,

euen in this respect, that she will teach him that, which both for matter and maner, will be most pleasing, and in all points to be imitated.

               So it seemed good vnto nature, to fit and match euerie mans turne: how carefull is nature that nothing may perish; see how she hath represented two persons in this one childe; the nose and eies resemble the father; the fore-heade and chinne the mother. Can you commit such pretious pledge to another bodies trust? Me thinke they are double cruell that are able to doe it: for that is not done onely with the perill of the Infant that is put away, but also with their owne perill, because the milke which is corrupted by chaunge, doth oftentimes bréede most perillous diseases. And therefore it falleth out, that while they prouide for the fashion or beautie of one bodie, they neglect the liues of two bodies, and while they go about to preuent sudden old age, they cast themselues into an vntimely death; but I will go sée what I can do with your husband and friends.

               No, good sir, but my wiues mother bound her selfe by a vow, that if her daughter did bring forth a sonne aliue, I should go in mine owne person, and salute St. Iames of Compostella, and giue him thankes for it.
            
            
               Men.
               Did you salute the Saint onely in your own name, and your mother in law?

               The winde being so prosperous did inuite me thither, and I had passed my promise before to that Saint by the Sea coast, that after two yéeres I would see her againe.
            
            
               Mene.
               What sute had you to her?
            
            
               Og.
               No new matter, but all ordinary, that my familie might be in health, that my wealth might encrease, and that I might enioy a long and happy life in this worlde, and euerlasting happinesse in the world to come.

               Ogy.
               There is no fault found with it: they grow richer by their deuout piety, than by a yearely rent. Their Church is beautifull and costly, wherein doth not dwell the Uirgine her selfe, but for honour sake that she hath yeelded vnto her Son. She hath a Chappell by her selfe, as she is placed at the right hand of her Sonne.
            
            
               Men.
               Right hand? Which way then looketh her Sonne?
            
            
               Ogy.
               Well remembred, when he looketh toward the West, then she hath the right hand; but when he turnes himselfe to the East, then she hath the left hand: yet she doth not dwell heere neither, for her house is not yet finished, and the place very windy on euery side, the doores open, and windowes open, and the Ocean sea, the father of the windes, is hard by.
            
            
               Men.
               That is very hard: where then doth she kéepe?
            
            
               Ogy.
               In that Church that is not yet finished, there is a very narrow Chappel, floored with bordes very straight on both sides, and a very little doore to let in pilgrimes. There is almost no light, but candle light of tapers and wax candles, a most pleasant smell.
            
            
               Men.
               All this is agréeable to their religion.

               Men.
               Are they of the canons?
            
            
               Ogy.
               No, they are not vsed to that end, for feare that by occasion of their religion, they should be drawne from their religion: and while they should attend vpon a Uirgine, themselues should lose their owne virginity. Onely in the inward Chappel, which I call the bed-chamber of the blessed Uirgin, there attends a certaine canon at the Altar.
            
            
               Men.
               To what end?
            
            
               Ogy.
               To receiue and to kéepe that which is giuen.

               Me.
               Suppose that none were by, it is maruel that the blessed Uirgin her selfe do not presently thunder against such guests.
            
            
               Ogy.
               Why should the Uirgine doe that rather then God himselfe, whom they feare not to spoile of all his ornaments; yea, and to digge through his Church walls for them?

               But did he make this admirable tale of any credite?

               Yes that he did.

               That was not so easily done, you being a Philosopher and a wise man.

               He shewed me nailed vpon the doore, a copper plate, with that horse-mans picture vpon it that was so preserued, and in the same manner of apparrell, that then was vsed in England, and such as we sée vpon antient pictures, which (if they lie not) doe shew plainely that Barbers and Taylors in those daies, were not much set by.

               Me.
               You make a good construction of the matter: but I feare that many such things are deuised but for lucre sake.

               Yes surely, séeing as both mother and sonne, and father, and holy-ghost, (as you said) are robbed by sacrilegious persons, and yet in the meane time, they séeme to be so little moued at the matter, that neither by a becke nor making any noise they will make those wicked persons afraide. So great is the patience of the godhead.
            
            
               O.
               So it is indéede, but heare the rest: That milke is kept vpon a high Altar, in the midst of which altar, stands Christ, and for honour sake, his mother stands at his right hand, for that milke doth represent his mother.

               It may be so: but I did not suspect my selfe, and a good conscience feareth nothing. And the desire I had to sée that same table wherunto the Mystagogue referrd vs, drawn thither, and after long seeking we found it, but set vp so high that euery bodie could not read it. And I haue such eies, that I can neither be said to be sharpe-sighted, nor yet starke blind. In the meane time, Aldrise read, I conterfeyted him with mine eyes, as if I did reade, scarce trusting him in so w

               I was euen ashamed of my selfe, that had made any doubt of the matter, the whole matter was so plainly laide before our eyes, the name, the place, and the whole matter in order as it was done. To be short, nothing was omitted. There was a godly man borne at Paris, they call him William, who as he is otherwise, so in this especially religious, for searching the whole world for the Reliques of Saints. He hauing trauailed many Countreys, and séene verie many Monasteries,

and Churches, at last went to Constantinople: for this Williams brother was a Bishop there. This Bishop, when when he sawe his brother William preparing to returne home againe, tolde him of a certaine holy virgin, which had some of the Uirgin Maries Milke: and that he were a verie happie man, if either for loue or money, or by any skill, he could obtaine a portion of it: for all the other Reliques which hitherto he had gotten were nothing in comparison of this holy milke. There Wil. could not be quiet till he had begd half that milke. Hauing that treasure he thought himself richer than Croesus

The French-man dieth, the English-man taketh the milke, and placeth it vpon the Altar, the Canons of the church being present, which then were called Regulars, of them he obtained halfe the milk, that he caried into England, and by the motion of the spirite Either of God, or the diuell., he bestowed it vpon that blessed ladie of Walsing ham.

               That also came out of her breasts, but by chaunce, as she was milked, it fell vpon a stone, whereupon she sate, and afterward by the will of God, it was multiplied, as you heard before.

               After al this, while we were making ready to depart, and in the meane time looking héere and there, to sée if there were any other thing worth the séeing, we met againe with Mystagogues or Relique-maisters, who looked askew at vs, they poynt at vs with the finger, they come running towards vs: then they go away, then they come running againe, they nodde at vs, and they séemed as if they were about to call vs, if they had béene hardy enough.

               No surely, but I turned my face towardes them, smiling, and beholding them, as if I would haue some of them to call me.

               At the féete of the Uirgin lay a pretious stone, the name whereof neither Latines nor Gréekes could euer finde out. The Frenchmen call it a Toad, because it hath in it the forme of a toade so liuely, that no Arte can make the like: and that which is more to be wondred at, it is a very little stone, and the image of the toade doth not appeare in the outside of it, but is inclosed in the very heart of the stone.

In the stone calld O eraunia we sée the proportion of a thunder bolt: in the Carbuncle we sée the likenesse of flaming fire: in the Chalazia there is both the shape and coldnesse of haile, yea though you cast it into the middest of the fire: in the Emerald we sée the déepe and cleare waues of the sea: the Carcinias hath the forme of a sea crabbe: the Echites hath the likenesse of a viper: the Scarites resembleth the fish Scarus: the Hieracites is like a hawke: the Geranites hath a cranes necke: the Aegophthalmus sheweth a goats eie: the Lycophthalm

But what doe I

To this question when the Kéeper of the golden head made no answer, Gratian (as he is somewhat earnest) said, I thinke, yea and do verily beléeue, that such a holy manas he was, would be glad now whē he is dead, to reléeue the penurie of poore men with his goodes. With that the Mystagogue frowned vpon vs, and put out his lips at vs, and looked vpon vs with Gorgonicall eies, and I thinke verily that he would haue spit at vs, and with al reprochful spéeches haue thrust vs out of doores, but that he knew we were commended by the archbishop.

               Surely I greatly commend your pietie: but I often times muse to my selfe, with what colour they can be excused, as frée from all fault, which bestow such abundance of wealth in building, adorning, and enriching of temples, as if there were neuer any end to be made. I graunt there is a certaine dignitie due to holy vestures, to church implements, and solemne seruice, or holy solemnities: I alow that the buildings themselues should haue their state and maiestie, but to what end serue so many baptisteries, or fonts, so many candles, and candlestickes, so many golden Images, and such cost as is bestowed vpon organs: and not content with these, we must haue great reuenues to maintaine a musical kind of whining, neighing, and chanting, when in the mean time our brethren and sisters, that are the liuely temples of Christ, are ready to perish with hunger and thirst.

               The way to death is more hard than death it selfe. But if a man can frée his minde from that imagination of feare of death, he shall abate a great part of that euil. To bée short, whatsoeuer is bitter, either in sickenesse, or in death, is made more tollerable, if a man doe wholy commit himselfe ouer to the good will of God. For as touching the féeling of death, when the soule is pulled from the body, I thinke it to be either none at all, or very stupide and blockish, because nature before it be come to that passe, doth dead, and astonish, or mortifie, and as it were, cast asléep

Although, as there is not the like chaunce vnto all in their birth, so it happeneth not alike to all in their death, some die quickely, and are soone out of paine, others doe languish long of a lingering di

               All his liuing was so diuided, that all the funerall charges being deducted, twelue partes should go to his wife, whereof the one halfe should be for hir maintenance, the other to the place of hir abode, from whence if she should (vpon hir mind changing) depart, then al that part should go for euer to that parish: another part to hir son, who should haue some of it presently payd him, to beare his charges, going his iorny, and remayning at Rome, and he should haue sufficient besides to

pay for his orders and dispensations: But if he shoulde alter his minde, and refuse holy orders, then should his parte be diuided betwéene the Franciscans and the Dominicans, which I feare he will loose, the youth séemed so much to abhorre being a Priest. Two parts should go to the Monasterie, wherein his yonger son should be brought vp. And two parts likewise to the Monastcries where his two daughters shuld liue: but with this prouiso, that if they would not professe that kind of life, yet all their money should remaine whole and safe to their vse. One parte was bequeathed to Bernardine, and as much to Vincent, and halfe a part to the Cartufians, to be made partaker of all good works that should be done by their whole Order. That which remained, was to be giuen in secret to the poore: Quos beneficio dignos iudicassent Bernerdinus &amp; Vincentius, that is, whom B

               Phae.
               Then they demaunded of the sicke man, (after they had rehearsed his Will) in this manner: George Gunner, you being aliue, and of perfect memorie do approoue this your last will and testament? And he said, I do approoue it. It is your last and immutable will, is it not? He saide: It is. And you make me (quoth Bernardine) and this man Vincent Executors of this your last will? He sayd, I doe. Then he was required to subscribe his name.
            
            
               Mar.
               How could he doe that, lying a dying?

               What did he subscribe?
            
            
               Phae.
               Saint Francis and Saint Dominicke be enemies vnto him that shall assay to alter any part of this will: these things being thus done, his wife, and children gaue their right hands to the sicke man, and were sworne to perform that which was giuen them in charge. Then there was much adooe about the funerall solemnities. At length this was concluded, that of euery one of the fiue orders there should nine be present at his buriall, for the honor of the fiue bookes of Moses, and the nine

orders of Angells. Euery order should beare his Crosse and sing mourneful songs before the coarse. Moreouer, besides hisA good reson kinred, there should be thirty other mourners, because, for so many pence Christ was solde. The taper bearers should be in mourning apparel, and for honors sake, they shoulde be accompanied with twelue mourners, for this is the holy number of the Apostolike order, after the coffin should his horse go in mourning apparel, with his head tied so lowe to his knées, that he should séeme, as it were, to require his maister of the ground. The vpper cloth should be set here and there with his armes, and in like manner euery torch, and euery mourning garment should haue his armes. And his body should be laid on the right hand of the hie Altare in a marble toombe, which should hang ouer foure foote from the ground, and his picture to lie vpon the top of it, carued out in white marble, from the crowne of the head to the sole of the foote: hée should also haue his helmet, with his crest, his crest was a Swannes necke: vpon his left arme was his buckler, with his armes grauen vpon the same: these were three wilde Boares heades ore, in a field argent, and vpon his side his sworde, with a gilded hilt, that should be fa

               We haue séene also, and haue laughed hartily at these foolish shewes that poore men will make, there folow Fullers, and Curriers before, and Coblers behinde, and Monkes in the middest, a man would take them for monsters, or chimny swéepers, and this was no otherwise, if you had séene it. It

was also prouided by George, that the Franciscans and Dominicans should cast lots, which of them should goe foremost in the funerall shew, and that the rest also after them should doe the like, for auoyding of tumult: the parish priest and his clarkes should come last of all, for the Monkes would haue it so.

                  st these things were thus in handling, the sicke man grew very weak, and gaue most euident signes that his time was come, and so commeth the last acte of this storie: now the bishops pardon was read vnto him, whereby he was fréed from al his sinnes, and from all feare of Purgatorie: and besides that, all his goodes were iustified and approoued.

               In good time, but what if that had béene dissembled, if there had béene an error? I thinke the sicke man should haue béene neuer the worse.
            
            
               Phae.
               I grant you that: but the sicke man was so troubled about that matter, that he beganne to despaire. There Vincent played the man, and bade him be of good chéere, ser that he had authoritie to correct or put in whatsoeuer was amisse, or wanting in the Pardon. And (quoth he) if any thing in the Pardon deceiue you, I pawne my soule for yours, and lette yours go to heauen, and mine to hell.

               Phae.
               By the law of the Gospell: To him that hath shall be giuen. There was also recited the number of Masses and Psalters that should accompanie the soule of the dead man, and that was huge. After this was rehearsed his confession, and the Priests absolution was giuen him.

               And did he so yéeld vp the Ghost?
            
            
               Phae.
               Not yet. There was spred vpon the ground a Mat of Bulrushes, and at the beginning before it was vnfolded, it was like a Pillow in fashion.

A Friers Coole was put vnder his head, for then it could not be put on, and withall was laid his pardon, and all his prouisoes.
            
            
               Mar.
               This is a new kind of death indéed.

               And they had that, the Diuell hath no power ouer them that die in that maner, so they say, that among others, St. Martin, and St. Francis died.
            
            
               Mar.
               But their life was answerable to their death. And I pray, what then?
            
            
               Phae.
               Then there was reached to the sicke man the Image of the Crosse, and a waxe Candle: when the Crosse was taken him, he said, I was woont in warre to be defended with

my Buckler, but now I will oppose this buckler against my enemie: and when he had kissed it, laid it vpon his left shoulder; but to the holy Candle he said, sometimes with my speare I haue preuailed against the enemies of my bodie, but now I will shake this speare at the enemies of my soule And with that they all fled away, as a dog doth from a gammon of bacon, when he is through ly a hungred..

               Phae.
               These were the last wordes that he vttered: for presently death was in his tongue, and he began to breathe out his soule. Bernard standing at his right hand, and Vincent at his left hand; the one shewed him the image of Saint Francis, and the other the Image of Saint Dominicke. The rest that were in the Chamber murmured certaine Psalmes with a murmuring voyce. Bernard with great and loude voyce stood roaring in his right eare: and Vincent the like in his left eare.
            
            
               Mar.
               What did they crie?
            
            
               Phae.
               To this effect cried Bernard: George Gunner, if now you like of that we haue done, turne your head to the rightO miserable comforters. Not a word al this while what Christ did for him. hand: and he did so. On the other side, Vincent cried: feare not George, thou hast Francis, and Dominicke to fight for thée. Be secure, and take no care for any thing. Thinke what aboundance of merits thou hast, what a pardon thou hast: and last of all, remember that I haue pawned my soule for thine if there should be any danger, if thou doest beléeue &amp; like these things, then turne thy head to the left hand, and so he did. Againe with the like noyse they cried; if thou beléeuest these things, crush my hand, saith the one, and mine, said the other, and so he did. And so with turning of his head this way and that way, and crushing of their haudes there were almost thrée houres spent, since George began to gaspe for breath. Here Bernard standing vpright, pronounced his absolution againe; but before he could finish it, George was gone. This was about midnight; in the morning they went about their anatomie: and after dinner they finished the buriall in manner aforesaide.

               Phae.
               Yes, onely one he was aduised by, both a good Phisition, and a good man. His name is Iacob Castrutius, he told Cornelius that he would do the best good that he could for his friend but said withall, that there was more helpe in God then in Phisitions. Cornelius receiued this speach in as good part as if he had giuen him most certain hope of life. Therfore though he were euer to his abilitie good to the poore, yet now whatsoeuer he could spare, after he had taken order for his wife and children, he gaue it to the néedie, not to these proude beggers, that are in euerie place, but to the honest poore, who wrought hard for their liuing, and yet were poore, their charges being greater then their labour could supplie, I prayed him to go to his bed, and to send for the Minister, rather then by walking vp and downe to weary his thin wasted bodie. His answere was, that his care was alwayes rather to be helpfull, than troublesome to his friends, if it were possible, and that hée

would not be vnlike himselfe at his death. And truly he did not kéepe his bed aboue one day, and part of a night, before he left this world. In the meane time, for the weakenesse of his bodie, he leaned on a staffe, or sate in a Chaire, seldome would he lie in his bed, but vpon his bed sometime, aud sit right vp. At this time he did euer giue something in charge of looking to those that were knowne to be honest poore folke, or reade on some holy Booke, which might stirre vp his minde to trust in God, and might also set forth the loue of God to vs-ward. If through wearinesse he were not able to reade, he would heare some friend rea

                  e vnto him. He did often with maruellous zeale exhort his familie to concord and mutuall loue, and to the studie of true godlinesse: and those that tooke care for his death, he did comfort most louingly. He did also admonish them all, and all his friends to pay euerie man his owne.
            
            
               Mar.
               Did he not make a Will?
            
            
               Phae.
               Yes, he did that before, when he was whole &amp; strong. For he was of opinion, that they are not Wils, but dotings, or dreames rather, which men make when they lie a dying.
            
            
               Mar.
               Did he giue nothing to the Monasteries, and Mendicant Friars?
            
            
               Phae.
               Not a farthing: I haue (said he) to my abilitie disposed all my litle substance: now as I leaue to others the possession of my goodes: so I also leaue them the dispensation of them, And I hope they will sée them better employed then I haue done.
            
            
               Mar.
               Did he not send for religious men to be about him as George did?
            
            
               Phae.
               Truly there was not one more then his owne family, and two of his speciall friends: for he said he would not trouble any more at his death, then he did at his birth.
            
            
               Mar.
               I expect an end of this storie.

               You shal haue it presently: he sent for his pastor, who gaue him the holy communio
                     •…
                  , but without any secret confession: for he saide that his minde was not troubled with anie thing. Néere his pastor beganne to deale with him about his

buriall, and asked him, where, and in what manner he would be buried? Bury me (saide the other) euen as you would burie a christian man of the most inferior sorte, neither doe I care where you lay this body of mine, it will be found out well enough in the last day wheresoeuer it be laide, and as for funerall pompe I regarde it not. Then there was mention made of the ringing of belles, of yéerely dirges to be sung, of a pardon, and the communion of merites to be purchased: to which his answer was, My pastor, I shal be neuer the worse, if there be no bell rung for me: if you bestow any solemne funerall on me, it is more than néede: or if there be any other thing that the publike custome of the church requireth, if it may be omitted without offence to the weake ones, I leaue it to your discretion. Neither is it my purpose, either to buy any mannes prayers, or to spoile any man of his merits, Christ hath merited sufficiently for me, and I hope the prayers of the church will not alittle prosite me while I am aliue. My whole trust is, that the prince of Pastors the Lord Iesus, hath done away all my sinnes, and fastned them vnto his Crosse, and that hée hath written and sealed my pardon with his most pretious blood, whereby he hath made vs assured of eternall life, if wée put all our trust in him. For God forbidde that I with mans merites and pardons should prouoke my God to enter into iudgement with his seruant, being most assured, that in his sight no flesh liuing shall be iustified, I appeale from his iustice to his mercy, which is great and vnspeakeable. Hauing spoken these things the Minister departed. Cornelius hauing conceiued great hope of saluation, with great ioy and chéerefulnes, willeth some things to be read vnto him out of the Bible, which tend to prooue the resurrection of the dead, and the rewarde of immortallitie, as that out of Esay concerning the death of Hezechia, together with his song: then the fiftéenth chapter of the first epistle to the Corinthians: then of the death of Lazarus, out of Iohn, but especially the hystorie of Christes passion out of the Gospel. Oh how gréedily did he deuoure (as it were) euery thing in his minde? at some things sighing, at some lifting vp his hands with thankesgiuing, reioycing at

some, and at many things that were read vnto him, he would cast forth certaine short prayers. After dinner, when he had slept a while, he willed the twelfth chapter of Iohn to be read vnto him, euen to the end: héere you would haue saide he had béene a man transfigurated, and inspired with a new spirite. Now it grew towards the euening, he called for his wife and children, and raising vp himselfe so well as he could, he spak

That care, and loue, and godlines which héeretofore thou hast shewed to me and these swéete pledges, bestow whally on these the fruite of our marriage, which God hath giuen vnto vs, maintaine them and briug them vp in such sorte as they may be compted worthy of Christ, which if thou shalt doe, as I trust thou wi

But héere Cornelius interrupted her, and saide, My most deare sister in Christ, if the Lord Iesus shall vouchsafe to bestowe this strength of spirite vpon thée, be not thou wanting to his heauenly gift, but embrace it: for it will be better both for thée and thy children: but if the infirmitie of the flesh shall call thée to the married state, then knowe that my death doth set thée frée from that power which I haue had ouer thée, but not from that faithfulnesse, which both in respect of mée and thée, thou owest vnto all the children common to vs both. As touching matrimonie, vse that libertie which the Lorde hath permitted vnto thée: onely this I request, and admonish thée of, that thou choose a man of those conditions: and thou also to shew thy selfe in such sort towards him, that he may either by his owne goodnesse be drawen, or by thy commoditie may be prouoked to loue his sonnes in lawe. And moreouer, beware that thou doost not binde thy selfe by any vow: Kéepe thy selfe frée to God and our children, whome I would haue thée so to traine vp in all piety, that they may not addict themselues

vnto my trade, vntill by their yeares and experience of things, it shall appeare for what kind of life they are most fit. Then turning to his children, hée exhorted them to the studie of godlinesse, to obey their mother, and to haue mutuall loue and concord amongst themselues. Hauing ended these sayings, he kissed his wife, and his children, and prayed God to blesse them. After all this, he looking vppon the rest that were present, he said, before to morrow morning, the Lord Iesus which rose againe in the morning, will vouchsafe of his great mercie to call this soule out of the sepulchre of this body, and out of the darkenesse of this mortalitie, into his heauenly light. I will not wearie my tender age with néedlesse watchings. And let the rest also go take their rest, one shall

The night being past, about foure of the clocke, all his family being about him, he willed the whole Psalme to be read vnto him, which the Lord Iesus praying rchearsed vpon the crosse. That done, he said, The Lord is my light and my saluation, whom shall I feare? The Lord is the protector of my life, of whom shall I be afraide? Then he folded his hands vpon his breast in maner of a supplicant, and lifting his eyes toward heauen, he said, Lord Iesus receiue my spirit. And forthwith closed vp his eies, as one about to sléepe, and with a little sigh yéelded vp the ghost, you would haue said he had béene asléepe.
