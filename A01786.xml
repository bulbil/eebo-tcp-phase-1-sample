            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

There was a certaine wylderneſſe called Ramanna, which was a waſte grounde, vnhabited, belonging to the Aſſyrians: with the eaſt, bordering vpon Aries: vpon the ſouth, Carmanill: vpon the weſt, the Medes: vpon the north, the Hircans. Theſe Raellyans were contented at the firſt to become tributaries to the Aſſyrians, not onely to inhabite that grounde: but alſo to plant the ſame, with all manner of fruitefull encreaſe. But after good ſpace of tyme, the Raellyans growing to great wealth, and ſecure pleaſure of all proſperous felycitie,

were able to traffique prouiſion of marchandyze to all countreys rounde about them: dyd buye and freelye purchaſe the priuiledge of their countrey and lande of the Aſſyrians: which they the rather compaſſed to bring to paſſe, for that the Aſſyrians repined at theyr wallowing in wealth, and great happineſſe which the Raellyans grewe vnto: as alſo becauſe the Aſſyrians beganne to extort, and with cruell vexation to oppreſſe them: practyſed the ſpaedier to auoyde ſuch inconuenience which might enſue.
               Theyr owne brittle foundation wayed and conſidered after theyr owne hartes deſire was eſtabliſhed, and all thinges brought to paſſe, euen as they wiſhed for: they with one conſent and agreement, for the more ſurer faſtening, and grounding of theyr eſtate by the counſell and aduiſe of the chiefeſt and wyſeſt men of the Raellyans: gathered together with one agreement, to chooſe a King: thinking thereby theyr gouernaunce, not onely to become ciuile: but alſo theyr eſtate better and happyer, and that theyr countrey ſhoulde the rather he dreaded.

And alſo that they all throwing themſelues vnder the obedience, &amp; ſcepter of one man, ſhoulde become one: whereas euery mans opinion bearing ſwaye, there was many factions, treaſons, conſpiraries, which dyd enſue: one enuying anothers eſtate, within them ſelues.
               Therefore as they thought beſt, to reduce this their popular eſtate, in one vnifourme gouernaunce: thorow which determination, great grudging aroſe, moſt part of them, thought it vnneceſſarie to throwe theyr neckes vnder the gouernaunce of one man: and the rather for that before theyr forefathers had refuſed theyr obedience vnto the Scithians, a people of theyr owne fleſhe, and blood: And alſo for that they were called Raellyans, which name came of theyr baniſhment: which if nowe they ſhoulde proſtrate them ſelues to a King, might well againe be called Scithians, after theyr olde name, and countrey, from whence theyr ofſpring yſſued. And ſo in continuaunce of tyme, the Aſſyrians poſteritie woulde pretende a tytle to theyr gouernaunce, and this theyr eſtate ſhoulde bee

come very daungerous. Whereas now euery man is ready to defende his owne eſtate, and euery mans particular condicion of lyfe, is generall to all the whole countrey. And he that enuyeth eyther the eſtate of the countrey, or the proſperitie of his neighbour, is a plaine enemie vnto him ſelfe, and his owne famylie. This hath béene heretofore the gouernaunce, and therefore ſéeing we proſpere and floriſhe, that all countreys rounde about vs reuerence vs, feare vs, and craue helpe at our handes: why ſhoulde we ſo greatly abandone our great libertie, whiche hath béene deryued, from the ſtoute magnanimitie of our forefathers, to bee cowardly loſte in vs theyr poſteritie, and chyldren?
               Theſe and ſuch lyke perſuaſions were in the hartes of the common people of the Raellyans: Notwithſtanding the prudent elders of the countrey, woulde not deſiſt theyr opinion: but that theyr countrey, coulde not bée ſaufegarded by any better meanes, then by electing and choſing of a King.
               Nowe whereas the Scithians hauing

in their countreye, as a moſte precious iewell, an Aſſe of Adamant ſtone, ſumptuouſly portrayed with golde, and precious orna

               This ſtrife betwéene the commen people and the prudent elders of the Lande, for the electing and chooſing of a Kinge, for

that it coulde not bée otherwayes deſcribed: ſhoulde be ended in the holye Alſephon before this Aſſe: whereas a great gathering together was m

               This controuerſie growing to ſuche a wounde, which feſtered more ſharper in their hartes, then the languiſhing diſeaſe Loſſorna doth in the ioyntes and partes of man: yet notwithſtanding, ſuch was the reuerent feare, and blinde heathniſh eſtimation, both for that cuſtome which ouercaſteth and ſhaddoweth all thinges, had forgotten the very begynning of this Aſſe, helde the ſame in the worſhippe of a God, the whole multitude durſte not but wholly geue conſent, both for feare and loue: whiche wholly as this relygious Image reuealed the ſubſtance of the cauſe, ſo to be content, to eſtabliſhe theyr eſtate.
               For as they feared this Image, in reſpect of the diuers plagues, &amp; miſchiefes that might fal vpon their eſtate &amp; contrey:

euen ſo, for the pure zeale and blind loue of vaine worſhip, not one of them woulde fall awaye, or once wring aſide in that duetie, that they thought might be done to ſo holy and reuerent an Image: for health, ſickneſſe, riches, pouertie, all maner of earthlie increaſe: yea the renowne of theyr countrey (as they beléeued begun) continued, and ended thorowe this Image.
               Wherefore this deuiſe was prouided, that all the people, which although they were of two ſeuerall opinions in minde: notwithſtanding, they ſhoulde be gathered all in one, in this holye Alſephon. Where before this holy Image the Aſſe, this wounded controuerſie ſhould bee cured: and as herein they were all content, ſo the two ſortes of people dyd chuſe two ſeuerall Orators, to decyde theyr two ſeuerall cauſes: the one how that it was neceſſarie, that the lande ſhoulde be gouerned by a King: ſo the others opinion was, that their eſtate was nowe happieſt, and therefore moſte vnneceſſary to haue a King: The common ſorte of people dyd thoſe an excellent Orator, one Harmannus,
                  
that ſhould ſet downe the opinion of the common people: and the prudent Senators dyd chuſe for theyr Orator, one Alectros: As theſe cauſes and opinions were very ſkylfully handled, ſo was the controuerſie lefte before the Image, by the Determyner of the holy Alſephon to be ended.

Then alſo not onelye this holye Image wyll beholde the innocencie of my hart: but the people, whoſe feruent zeale this daye haue choſen mee, to bee an Orator in their defence (as vnworthie of the ſame) wyll geue out theyr showte and crye of conſent. Our realme and countrey was firſte begunne of the Scithians

blood: vvhich although fleshlye nature dyd ioyne them to bee of naturall conſanguinitie: yet in maners there was great difference. For as the Scithians were barbarous, and lyued in a ſauadge and rude maner of lyfe, plaging their carkaſes', bothe outwardly and inwardlie: Our fathers being of hautie and noble ſtomackes, hauing a wonderfull and highe ſpeculation in the giftes of nature: ſo they woulde not teare theyr fleshe, and pyne their bellyes, whiche should be honoured. And therevppon it came to paſſe, that our fathers refuſing their obedience, were banished: and for a monument of renowne, tranſported this holye Image whiche hath directed and taught them, in all honourable nobilities, and reuerent adorations, vnto this daye. In this holye Alſephon, hath all good vertues beeneſet forth, and taught vnto our elders, and lefte vnto vs: vvhy shoulde wee thus fall at variaunce then within our ſelues for a Kinge?
               VVhat shall other bordering countreies here about vs report? Some of them wyll ſaye that we cannot agree within our ſelues.

And is it not commonlie ſeene, that kingdomes whiche is diuided within it ſelfe, doeth ſooneſt decaie, and fall to deſtruction: and the concorde of the people, is the beſt defence of a countrey, and the happieſt gouernance of a cōmon wealth? Our fathers haue brought vs to this happie inheritaunce: why shall vve now ſeeke our owne woe, to correcte our fathers actions? VVhat shall other countreies ſaye? beholde this kingdome howe it altereth from the begynning of theyr fathers: Oh vnhappie children, the curſedneſſe of your eſtate, hath deſerued ſome great plague from the firſt begynning, and nowe shall be reuealed in this generation.
               If we haue a king, our goodes and our poſſeſsions are not our owne, we shall be oppreſſed with taxes as our forefathers were vnto the Aſsirians: If our forefathers could haue endured obedience, why would they haue refuſed theyr owne kindred and countrey, the Scithians? vvhy did they raunſome their tribute whiche they paide vnto the Aſsirians, vnto theyr great charges, not being growne to the

thirde parte of the wealth, as we nowe ares but becauſe they woulde freely at theyr owne lybertie enioye theyr owne goodes without controlement, and make vs their heyres freemen?

Doo you not knowe howe harde and ſtraunge a thing it is to remoue olde and auncient cuſtomes?

It is harde to grafte a wylde thiſtle in a Roſemarie ſtocke: it is a more harder matter to plant the weake braunches of the nettles, in the highe fyrre trees of this wylderneſſe: The growthe of many yeares hath ſtrengthned the fyrre tree, as the ſweete heate of ſommer hath cauſed the ſtinging bloſſomes of the

nettles gallantlie to shew forth their friſeled faces: ſo the colde winter hath quite withered the ſame away againe. Let vs remēber what pleaſure the Hircans, the Trebonians, obtained through their renowne they got in lyuing at their ownely bertie? and what miſchiefe and deſtruction they fell vnto, when as they gaue conſent to thruſt their neckes vnder the yoake of obedience to be ruled: wheras before, euery man did rule at his owne pleaſure: This their vnhappie eſtate of lyfe, maye make your eſtate of lyfe happie: if they in not taking hede, may cauſe you to take hede: If they in falling to deſtruction, maye cauſe you to winne renowne: and keepe it. Then thinke and perſwade with your ſelues, it is farre better to lyue in the pleaſure of free men to be rulars, then to fall to deſtruction by ſlauish bondage to bee ruled.

If that enuious vexations do lurke and lye hyd in the hartes of the people? there is no better way to vnroote olde cuſtomes, and plant good orders, (ſuch as are agreeing with the old opiniōs of our forefathers, perticular and neceſſarie to our common wealth: and ſo as neceſſary

to endure cōtinually:) then ciuile aucthoritie. It is not vnknowne, but that old and auncient cuſtome, being neuer ſo ſtraunge to remoue, by ciuile gouernance it taketh place: And where thorowe lyttle ſtrife, the people are readie to holde vp the ſworde, one againſt another: their aucthoritie muſt be made the ſtranger, and more forceable to endure. I doubte not but that this happie eſtate shall both preſently and proſperouſly enſue to renowne: and ſuch as are enemies herevnto, shal vtterlie in short tyme be deſtroyed: and our eſtate and common wealth, shall for long time be preſerued. Indeed, the wild thiſtle for that it choaketh good corne, is to be cut downe: but the Roſemary ſtocke is to be preſerued as neceſſarie and holeſome: The weake ſtincking nettles are to be cut downe: but the fir trees of the wilderneſſe are to be preſerued for a common wealth. If we call to remembraunce the wofull pleaſure (as Harmannus wylleth vs) of the Hircans and Trebonians, the miſerable penurie they brought vnto their lande, in lyuing at their owne lybertie, and myſchiefe and deſtruction: their frowarde awkarde ſtomackes did worke in them: for their ciuile vvarres and horrible diſſentions that they

vvere ſubiect vnto, when as they fel at diſcord with their King? as alſo ſuch was their mallice, that one of them became odious vnto another. Indeed it is truely ſpoken, that their vnhappy eſtate of life, may make our eſtate of life happy: for if the remembrance of their rebellions, worke in our harts obedience and duety: if their ignoraunce, worke in vs knowledge: if they for diſobeying, and rebelling againſt their King, came to ruine: let vs vvith obeying, duetifullie acknowledge our Soueraigntie, and maie be long and euermore made happie and proſperous ſubiectes, to winne renowne and keepe it: For in hauing a King, degrees of men are knowne: euerie man is preſerued in his owne eſtate: the whole lande chieflie maintained in a most proſperous ſafegarde: This you may well perceiue it is farre better to haue a king to bee ruled, then to liue at lybertie, one man to destroie another.

                  rlie burlie, that fell among the people in the holie Alſephon.
               PReſently after the ende of theſe Orations, there grewe ſuch diſſention in the holy Alſephon: on both ſydes, partes were taken: ſo that not one man, that was in the holye Alſephon, coulde aſſure himſelfe, to goe away with the hope of his owne lyfe. There was for the ſpace of two howres, ſuche a ſhowte, with roaring and myſerable crying of the people: rending their cloathes, ſcratchinge theyr ſkinnes, pulling their heayrre from theyr headdes, that the lyke was neuer hearde before.
               
                  
So that the prudent Elders of the land, had veryly thought, that preſent deſtruction, and waſtfull ſubuerſion of their countrey, had in that woofull inſtant run vppon them. In the middeſt of this hurlye, burlye, ſuch was theyr deſperate perylous miſchiefe: that one Roſmonna, a vyllanous Ruffyan, dyd run very vehemently with an edgde toole, in careles maner, purpoſing to kyll Alectros the Oratour: and with the excéeding thruſt and ſtrife that was among them, the holy Image was throwne downe: Whereat they being all amaſed, kepte ſilence

               In the ende of this controuerſie, iudgement was geuen by the conſent of the people, that Roſmonna ſhoulde be hanged. And as touching their controuerſie, for that the people were deuided,

they woulde for the preſent tyme, referre the arbiterment thereof vnto the Determyner of the holy Alſephon: And preſentlie after, that they with one conſent had executed Roſmonna to death, came to heare the full ende, and fynal determynation of this controuerſie: for they were al weryed with yrkſomneſſe of ciuile crie and ſhowte of the people with, the clamorous noyſe, murmuringes, grudginges, that one of them had againſt another: which moued them the rather, and wyllinger to make an ende, fearing leaſt their countrey woulde drawe to ciuile warres, and ſo in the ende come to deſolation.

               MY friendes and countrey men: I am ſorie, and the inwarde griefe of my harte plungeth ſorrowfull teares in myne

eyes: Firſt to ſee you my countrey men, friendes, and neighbours, to fall at ſuch variance, to hazarde your ſelues and your goodes, in ſuche a matter: about which you neede not ſo much to trouble your heads, or yet your raginge wittes to bee diſcouered, by ſuch greeuous. agonies: vvhether it be neceſſarie, or vnneceſſary, this lande to be gouerned by a King, perceiuing the myſerable miſchiefe alreadie kindled with the whoate fyrebrandes of mallyce, in the hartes of the people.
               I woulde rather with wholſome water of good counſaile, ſquenche the ſame: then to put the drye ſtickes of the wylderneſſe to increaſe it, or the gunpowder of the Aſſyrians to cauſe it more raginglie to flame out.
               I humblie beſeeche you my good countrey men, to quiet your hartes, and pacifie the griefe of your mindes: I am ſorie that it shoulde bee thought, yea, to haue muche more ſo iuſte occaſion to ſpeake, that the Raellyans are of ſuche rude conuerſation, and lewde behauiour: Yea, before this bleſſed Image ſo vnreuerently,

and ryotouſlie to behaue them ſelues. If you woulde not abſtaine for your owne ſakes, for your fathers ſakes, or for wiſedome ſake, which aboundauntly is grafted with in your noble ſtomackes: I ſaye, if none of theſe thinges can reſtraine you: then looke vp and beholde this holy Image, which hath power in one howre, yea, in one moment, to ſtryke you to death and deſtruction: Repent this your vnreuerent careles wickedneſſe: call to remembraunce this Image, which with my conſent, shall determine this controuerſie: For that it hath guided our fathers from the lande of Scithia, and hath ſeene al the actions, deedes, monuments, purchaſes and determinatiōs of all thoſe thinges that haue beene done, or thought to be done, from the Reellyās firſt begynning vntyll this preſent daye: This Image therefore knoweth what is moſt profitable and neceſſarie for this our countrey and common wealth: And as I coulde reueale the inward affection of my harte: ſo I wyll ſuſpende my iudgement, vntyll this Image hath pronounced a iudicyall determination of the ſame.

               ¶ How the Aſcalon of the Alſephon did require an aunſwere from the Image, whether they shoulde haue a King, or no.
               AFter the Determyner had ended this mylde and curteous Oration: the

people were not onely perſwaded vnto quiet repentannce, and ſorrowfull compunction: but the determination was made, and they all wholy agréede vnto the ſame: The Aſcalon whiche was the Sacryficer ſhoulde watche the good leaſure of the bleſſed aunſwere of the the Image. For he that was alwaies, the Aſcalon of the holy Alſephon it belonged vnto his office, not onelye to watch ouer the people, for to eſpye their feruent zeale towards this Image, but alſo it was not lawfull for any man to ſpeake vnto this bleſſed Image in any ſute, but firſte he ſhoulde come and pay the thirdes of al his increaſe vnto the Aſcalon of which he had taken commoditie of a monthe afore. And than the Aſcalon ſhoulde be a mediator for hym and vtter his cauſe. And as anſwer was receiued, ſo anſwere was made againe. And héerein, both for appeaſinge the wrathe and diſpleaſure of the Image for the former contencion, as alſo for the ſtirringe forwarde of the Aſcalon to be zelous in their cauſe, they gaue of the beſt of all their increaſe, to be ſacrificed before the Image: And

               In the morning very early, all the prudent Elders, with the cōmons of the land reſorted to this holy Alſephon: ſome came to make ſupplycations to this Image, for the cruell tempeſtes that was the ſame night before, ſome came to heare of the newes, which the reuelation of the holy Image (as touching their Kinge) had ſet forth: and ſome came for very enuy they had againſt this new order of chooſinge a King, to raiſe tumultes and miſcheuous ſedition. But when the holy Aſcalon had read before the people, what the Image had pronounced: they were then al quiet. Some were quieted for ioye, that their purpoſe was at an end: ſome were quieted for ſorrowe, for that they durſte not ſpeake againſt the Image. This determination for chooſing of a King, was a perfect finall ende.
            
            
               
               ¶ HOW THE KINGE was choſen by the conſent of the whole Realme, as wel the Elders as the commons.
               
               THeſe great troubles beinge appeaſed, and quietneſſe eſtabliſhed: the prudent Elders laying their heads together, for the preſent chooſing of their King vſed many wayes: yet in the end, they agréed and fully conſented in one opinion, as the holy Image had reuealed: which for that it was an impoſſible thinge that euerye mans Bull ſhould be brought: they were therfore all generally ſetled in this one minde according as the Image had vttered: that fortie of the Auncientes of the inhabitours, whoſe fathers firſt entered the lande, and were the firſt founders of their frutes and pleaſures which they did enioye, ſhould bring his Bul. When they had builded a goodly theatrée for the buls to fyght in, and euery man had clodded his Bull with a harneſſe of braſſe, with long pikes of pron ſticking forth at euery

place of the ſaide Bulles, nothinge was couered ſaue their hornes, mouthes and legs, whiche were at frée lybertye: One Hellepatrus a riche Gentleman of that Countrye, put vnto his Bul betweene the ſkin and the Harneſſe a number of lytle ſharp ſhorte needles faſtened vnto the inward parts of the Harneſſe: the Bull beynge both couragious, fierce and luſtye, and alſo vehemently pricked forwardes with the bitter greife of theſe néedles, came vpon the Theater with ſuch admyrable force, that the ſaide Bull preſentlye kylled ſix other Bulles, in the preſence of all the Elders of the Lande. Incontinent all the aforeſaide Elders made low reuerence vnto Hellepatrus, and ſaluted hym King. And as he gaue great thankes vnto them all: ſo with great ſinging, and playing of ſwéete Inſtruments, with all roiall pomp they went to the holy Alſephon to render thanks to the bleſſed Image. Whē all the Elders of the Land. wt the conſent of the Cōmons had ſtrengthened the authorytie of his kingdome: ſome for feare, and ſome for lone: then the day of Coronation was appointed with great prouiſion,

and aſſemblye of people: with ſuche magnificent and royall pompe as the lyke was neuer hard in any kingdom before: ſuch prouiſion of wines: ſuch ſtore of imbroydered coſtly garments: ſuch ſtore of oyles: ſuch ſtore of kids: with dates, orenges, pumgranets, yea that coſt coulde not be thought but prouiſion was made for it. But yet there reſted an other ambiguitie The ſtrife for theyr Coronatiō was the eternal prouidence. which cumberſomly dyd hang in ye minds both of the King, the Elders and the commons of the land: which was, with what Crowne the Kinge ſhoulde be crowned: Some ſaide a Crowne of Golde: ſome ſaid of Siluer: ſome ſaide of Braſſe: ſome of Iron: ſome other ſaide a Crowne of Adamant ſtone imbroydered with Gold: for Ada mant ſtone was thought to be ye moſt precious ornament that their Land was furniſhed withal. This doubt increaſing greater and greater with what Crowne the Kinge ſhoulde be crowned withall: they went into the holy Alſephon, where petition was made vnto the Aſcalon, to intreate, and make ſupplycation vnto the holye Image: Bothe with

what ſcepter the King ſhould be ſouerainted and with what crowne crowned. The Aſcalon made vehement peticion vnto the Image for the ſpace of foure nights, and could receaue no other aunſwer but this:

                  The Aſcalons Declaration vnto the Elders concerning the anſwer of the Image.
                  After this anſwer was pronounced, the Aſcalon declared vnto the elders: that there was ſome gret ſecret counſel which lay hid vnto the holy Image: for that he could receaue no other anſwer, but commaunded to goe, to Delphicus Appollo: Then the King, and the prudent elders of the land tooke great conſultation of the matter, and choſe two wiſe learned Imbaſſadours, with a great garriſon of men to aſſyſt them vnto Phocides: where they ſhoulde aſke counſell of the Oracle. After theſe two Imbaſſadours were furniſhed forwardes with ſpéedy appoyntment

for their returne: they comminge to Phocides, after ſome pauſe had, with as much expedition as belonged to ſuch a haſty buſineſſe, they layd downe beneth the foote of the hill Parnaſſus their giftes and fat of the earth, to be carried vp to the Temple of Appollo, being ſent from the King and Elders of the Raellians, they pitching their pauilion betweene the faire cleare fountaine Helicon, and the hil Parnaſſus.

               AFter the ende of this Coronation, the Elders of the Lande, dyd eracte an oathe of the King: and they cryed with a

lowd voice: Holy Image defend our king.
               Fyrſt they propowned that he ſhoulde defende the honour of the holye Image vertuouſly, and ſhoulde gouerne righteouſly: that neither for fauour of the one, or hatred to the other, he ſhould deny iuſtice: neyther by ſtrength power or aucthority, ſhould extort of them: but with equity to mayntaine and vphold the Scepter of his kingdome: And laſtly, to defende them, from the inuaſion of forraigne enemies.
               This his chardge being at an ende: the people ſhowted with lowde voice, and the Trumpets blew, with other inſtrumēts ordayned for that day and purpoſe: Now laſtly, ſetting the Crown vpon the Kings head, fowre ſeuerall tymes, one after another, but in the end they left ye Crowne remayning vpon the kings head, ſtyll vntyl night. Nowe after ye fynal end of all theſe triumphes &amp; renowned pleſures: the king aroſe, with al the Elders, &amp; departed for ye preſent, vnto a ſumptuous banquet, prouided for the daye of Coronation: In the ende whereof, the king with the Elders went vnto the Theatre, where they dyd ſee the yong men of all the Realme, ſhew Royal actiuity of many and ſundry Marſhall

feates of Armes: thus the day being almoſt ſpent, and night drawing on, returned to the holy Alſephon: where they hanged the Garland of Thyſtles, which was the kinges Crowne: and in lyke maner delyuered vp the Scepter, and thankes being rendered vnto the holy Image, departed.
            
            
               
                  ❧ Here is ſhewed howe the King fell at diſcorde with his ſubiects: his ſubiects confederated with the King of the Hircans, to inuade their lande: Hellepatrus the king of the Raellyans, was banished, and reſtored vnto his kingdome by the King of the Trebonians: with the myſerable death that the King of the Trebonyans was executed to.
               AFter this, the king being eſtabliſhed It is the greateſt policy that may be, to bridle affection in the gouernance of a kingdome. in his kingdome, &amp; confirmed king of of the Raellyans, with all the aſſuraunce that might be: the king being of a hautye and luſtye nature,

                  oulde not beare the murmurations of thē common people: but for verye ſmall trifles, dyd hang &amp; drawe them, with executing them

to many other ſauadge and cruell deaths: ſuch was his crueltie, that no king was feared lyke vnto Hellepatrus: The king ſeeing his eſtate ſure, his ſubiectes reduced to obedience, and that all thinges fell out as he wiſhed for: then he procéeded to enriche his unperial Crowne with lands and lyuinges: at which (generally) the ſubiectes repyned, and beganne to repent them ſelues, that euer they had made him king. Inſomuch, the king with ſuch crueltie began to taxe them, and brought ſore yoakes and burthens vpon them: as many of them fled from their owne countrey: ſo many of them yeelded them ſelues, and ſet good faces of the matter, although their hartes were ful of cankered miſchiefe, and poyſoned mallice towards the king. The king calling all the chiefs and rycheſt of the lande together, in mouing them to reſigne all their lands and lyuinges vnto the imperiall Crowne of his kingdome, and to become his tennauntes. At which, they being all ſore amazed, for that euerie man helde, but according to the cuſrome of the countrey, denyed the kinges requeſt: The king

                  Hellepatrus taking ſore diſpleaſure, by the aduiſe of ſome certaine flatterers about him, put many of the chiefe Elders of the lande to death: inuaded his owne countrey with ſuch terrors, that thoſe which woulde not obey him, were ſlaine, and executed to a moſt ſhamefull tyrannous death. Some of them were put to fyne: ſome of them put to perpetuall impriſonment: ſome of them bondſ

The cauſe hereof, was for that, they being ſo earneſt to haue a king, not that they fauoured any one man to bee theyr king: but for that euery man hoped after the kingdome him ſelfe: the king perceyuing euery mannes greedy deſyre, gaue but certayne outward thankes vnto them: but dyd attribute the ſucceſſe of

his good lucke vnto Ladie Fortune, and that holy Image. For as the King perceaued howe his people hated him: ſo he dyd not ſquenche their hatered with lenitie, or by any execrable méekeneſſe: but with more greater vengeaunce and crueller tyrannie.
               The people had him in ſuche horrible diſdayne, that whereas they hauing not delyuered theyr wrytinges, and auncient monumentes of recorde, which was betwéene their fathers, and the Aſſyrians, when they purchaſed the lande: ſo they practiſed with the King of the Hircans, that if hée woulde make warres vppon theyr king: they woulde not onely aſſiſt him, but alſo they woulde delyuer vp into his handes, the monumentes and wrytinges, of the free purchaſe of the lande, which was betwéene their fathers and the Aſſyrians.
               The King of the Hircans woulde preſently haue had the ſame wrytinges, but they woulde not agrée therevnto, before he had ouercome and vanquiſhed theyr king, by battayle: thorowe the great ſecreate ſuite of the Raellyans, the King of the Hircans was content to ſatiſfy

In the meane whyle the lande of the Raellyans was gouerned by the king of the Hircans, and as the Raellyans lyued as they lyſted them ſelues, to be at free lybertye, ſo they proued within that ſpace to be verie riche and welthie, and began to abound againe withall maner of plentifull pleaſures. The king when he fled, tooke Hellidorus his ſonne with him: and lefte Abdona his wife and other children in the lande of the Raellyans: which after the departing of Hellepatrus, moſt miſerably the Hircans tormented Abdona the Queene and her children, in moſt terriblye burning them to death. This baniſhment, dyd not ſo muche vexe the king, as the death and loſſe of his wyfe, with the reſydue of his children: whereas naturall affection dyd moue him to ſorrowe: ſo the remembraunce of reuenge, dyd comfort him on the contrary: Nature and reuenge working together, practiſed many wayes: yet no better way woulde ſerue his turne, then to open his griefe vnto the king of the Trebonians: the king of the Trebonians being at mortall deteſtation with the king of the Hircans,

declared vnto the king, howe the Elders and commens of his lande, had choſe him king, and confirmed the ſame with as ſtrong and forceable auchority as might be deuiſed: it was alſo ratified before a bleſſed Image in his lande, which theyr fathers brought from the lande of Scithia: howe with an Oracle from Delphicus Apollo, the maner of his Coronation was appointed. And that both the Scepter and Crowne of his kingdome were hanged vp in the holye Alſephon before the bleſſed Image: which they durſt not for feare of eternall plagues once diminiſh the ſame. And as he thought, the ſtrength of his kingdome, dyd conſiſt both in the Scepter, and alſo in the Crowne garlande of thyſtles. After they had made mee theyr king, and alſo royally put mee in anthoritie, and alſo had crowned, and ſoueraigned mee with the aforeſayde Crowne and Scepter: I afterwardes, but demaunding their obedience, which was due vnto mee: and that they woulde geue mee ſuch ryghtes and poſſeſſions vnto my imperiall Crowne, as they promyſed: they not onely denyed mée of the one, but they

rebelled againſt mée for the other: and practiſing with the king of the Hircans, haue dryuen mee from my kingdome, and ſpoyled mée of my landes and goodes: and moſt greeuouſlye haue bereft mee of my wyfe and chyldren: for moſt trayterouſly haue they put them to death.

And as Hellepatrus dyd geue him ſelfe to great exceſſyue drinking, among the Trebonyans: ſo the Trebonyans were a very inordinate people in drynking. Hellydorus, although geuing him ſelfe to an accuſtomed order of myldneſſe, for that he in all his lyfe neuer laughed: ſo he practiſed him ſelf to ye great actiuitie of the Trebonyans: for the Trebonyans were verye actiue and nymble people, in the feates of Armes, &amp; moſt ſtrongly woulde they fight, when they were exceſſiuely ouercome with drynking: But the king of the Trebonians, and the people practiſed many pleaſant deuiſes, to moue Hellydorus to laughter: but ſuch was his myldnes, that it coulde neuer be brought to paſſe:

Thus the king being bothe drowned in dronkenneſſe, ouerwhelmed with lecherie, indoted with olde age: theſe thrée enemies were more crueller, then all the hoaſt of the Hircans.

                  Here is ſhewed howe the King paſſed forth his Coronation with feaſting, and actiue tryumphe, fell ſicke, and recouering his health, reuenged the death of his father, Hellepatrus.
               
               AFter the ende of this Oration, the King departed to his banquet, and the Actiuities were ſhewed vpon the Theater: The King in the preſence of the people, with ſuch puiſſancie, dyd ſhew the courage, and Marſhal renowne of a king In ſo much, that he was not onely marueylous

to beholde: but alſo greatly dreaded in the eyes of the people.
               After thankes was rendred vnto the holy Image, and great peticions made: the king departed vnto his Pallace, and with a heate and colde that he tooke, in ſhewing his renowned chyualrie, fel ſicke vppon a Feuer: for which cauſe tooke him ſelfe vnto his Chamber, for the ſpace of twentie dayes after, and neuer came abroade, nor no man coulde ſpeake with him: ſaue his Phiſitions, and ſuch Gentlemen that were of his priuie chamber. After his health was recouered, and beganne to be ſtrong againe, the reremembraunce of the murthering of his Father coulde not be put awaye: ſo the offence was neyther forgeuen nor forgotten: For as he had the woman in holde, which had ſo ſhamefully commytted this murther. So he vppon the recouery of his health, fell to the examination of this naughty woman. And ſhe vpon her ſtrayght impriſonment, and ſtrayghter examination: apprehended the chiefeſt of the Elders of the land, with theyr wiues: which when the king had fullye knowne,

and with perfect inſtructiō was acquainted with theyr murtherſome practiſes, dyd not incontinently ſende for them, by his men of warre: fearing leaſt they hauing any ynkling hereof, would flie into another Lande: for no man was priuie to the examynares confeſſion, ſaue onely Hellidorus him ſelfe: dyd after a curteous manner in the waye of friendſhippe, ſende for them, and theyr wiues, one after another, to come and ſpeake with him. which ſo ſoone, as any of them made their appearaunce, were preſently ſent vnto priſon without further examination.
               And thus he dealt with all of them. one after another, vntyll he had apprehended euerie one of them, when theſe deuiſes were accompliſhed: the king vppon very prudent pollycie, ſent for all the neareſt kindred and friends of theſe murtherers, and talked vnto them after this ſort.

                           MY friendes and ſubiectes, I thought it good and neceſſarye to ſende for

you being Raellyans and wyſe men, and as I hope truſtie ſubiectes: Such reports haue beene geuen out. of your obedience: whiche moueth mee to preſume of that good fame and honeſt report that is ſpred in all places of this Lande, of your true and iuſt dealinges, towardes this Imperyall Crowne: For which cauſe I am perſwaded, that not for the deareſt kyndred or friendes that you haue among the Raellyane, wyll aducnture your lyues, landes, and goodes, for theyr ſakes:
                           If in treaſons towardes this Crowne, there were any ſuch of your kyndred and friendes, to be founde guiltie, would take theyr parts: Or that their deathes ſhould cauſe any ſorrowe to pearce your haries, they being perfectlye knowne, and once founde Traytours. You knowe my father your late king of famous memorie, was moſt trayterouſly murthered, and ſhamefully put to death, doo you not think it was plaine and preſumptuous treaſon? yea, ſuch a murther is not to be ſuffered among common perſons, much leſſe in a King: doo you not thinke the doers hereof are worthy to ſuffer the ſtrayghteſt death

that maye be deuiſed. And the people aunſwered:
                           
                              O Noble King, if their kindred vvere neuer ſo deare vnto vs, vvee vvoulde doo the beſt that lyeth in vs, not onelie to apprehende them: but alſo to put them to death.

And I of my owne prudencie, haue apprehended them alreadie: which if they can cleare them ſelues, from that which they be apprehended of: they ſhall be as free, as euer they were. And alſo I wyll recompence them for theyr vniuſte impriſonment. Wherefore for that they are your kyndred &amp; friends, you ſhall be aſſiſtants in iudgement with mée, when they are arraygned to be guiltie of this murther or no: Theſe men durſt not deny the King his requeſt: they were verye ſorye that they ſhoulde be vrged therevnto: partly

becauſe ſome of thē were not ſcarce cleare from the murther: other ſome hanged backe for kyndred ſake: other ſome, for ignorant ſimplicitie, not knowing what belonged to ſuch a ſoddaine prouocation, woulde gladly haue reuolted, not onelye their promiſe if they durſt, but alſo to haue They had

the death of the wicked woman, from the toes of her féete, vnto her ſholder partes, one ioynt was cut péecemeale, one from another: There was two thouſande men and women of the Raellyans, that were put to death in another maner, as this: Whoate ouens were heated for the ſame purpoſe, and the men were put therin: there were neare adioyning, whoate furnaces of boyling leade, wherin the graue women were caſt, a moſt lamentable ruth, in the preſence of many wéeping eyes, were ſkalded to death.
               This terrible iuſtice of the King, dyd ſtryke ſuche a horror in the hartes of his ſubiectes: that they not onely feared the kinges preſence, but alſo they were in doubte to ſpeake of him: thus the king thorowe extremitie, obtayned quietneſſe: and thorowe wiſedome and pollicie ruled his kingdome, he kepte them in ſuch obeence &amp; awe, that of all Princes that were then lyuing, Hellidorus was of his people moſt feared.

                  HEllidorus hauing ſquenched the naturall reuenge of his fathers death: eſtabliſhed his kingdom, &amp; ſubdued his people to great feare: then they began by lyttle and lyttle, to inquyre after the monumentes and wrytinges that were betweene their forefathers, and the Aſſyrians, for the purchaſing of that lande. The ſecreate inquiſitours of the King, handeled the matter in ſuch ſorte, from one to another, vntyll the matter was apparant, where and in whoſe cuſtodie

the wrytinges remayned. As many ſuffered death for concealing the matter, ſo many ſuffered death for the conuaying of them: and he in whoſe cuſtodie they were founde, ſuffered a moſt ſtraunge and ſtrayght death: Thus, as the King coulde gette nothing at their handes thorowe gentleneſſe: ſo he had what he woulde, thorowe croaked cruclueſſe.

In the myddeſt of theſe ſecuryties, and blinde knowledge of the eternall goueruaunce from about: hauing no other vnderſtanding, ſaue onlye in that dombe Image the Aſſe, which ſtoode in the Alſephon: which their forefathers brought from the lande of Scithia: there aroſe a great Prophete, in the lande of the Raellyans: of what countrey,

               Here is ſhewed how the King fell in loue with one Sebona a harlotte, married her: and was turned to an Aſſe: and how the Aſsirians did repoſſed the Land of the Raellians by conqueſt.
               AFter the King wasin his olde cuſtom of idolatry &amp; all other corruptions, the lande pacified, and prefixed in the wicked obedience of that peeced God, the broken Aſſe: the King alſo in doting in loue, was led with variable affections: led with the nordinate luſt of bewty: hunting in the

wicked concupiſcence of diuerſe women, was rauiſhed, with the ſpecial delectation of one woman: wheras the fine amorous Ladies of the Raellyans, perceauing the Kings laſciuious inclinatiō, deuiſed with them ſelues howe they might beſt ſet out themſelues in ſale before the King: Some with gallant imbrothered garments, and the coſtly ſilke of the Hircans: woulde ſhew them ſelues, with the flying wantō countenances of Louers to catche &amp; ſnare the King with their abhominable delites: ſome with daunſing, ſome with ſinging pleaſant Ditties: So that ſundry women had ſundry delytes, one contrary to another: whoſe ſundry contraryeties ouercaſted the king, with contrary impolutions. Sebona a bewtifull dame, &amp; the comlyeſt creature that euer lyued, eyther among the Hircans, eyther among the Trebonyans, or Raellyans the acceptableſt of all: Notwithſtanding, ſhe had bene the moſt whore, &amp; ſhameleſſe harlot, that euer raigned: this Sebona for bewty, gorgeous apparell, ſweete ſmelles, ſinging, daunſing, with al the deuiſes of a louer, moſt delited ye kinges fantaſie. This Sebona in reſpect of all other women, was a bright burning

The King languiſhing in the heauy agonies of loue, wrote vnto Sebon a after this manner.
               
                  
                     The Kinges letters to Sebona.
                     
                     
                        O Sebona, the worthy Louer of the Raellyans, which with the arrowe of thy beutie. haſt shotte and woūded my deſire, that al comforts eyther of my kingdome, cōmon vvelth, riches, poſſeſsions, renown, ſoueraigntie, do not ſo much pleaſure or comfort mee, as thy beutie. I that did conquer, am now conquered my ſelfe: I that did worship an holy Image, do now vvorship beutiful Sebona: I that did rule a kingdome, am now ruled by a vvoman: I that did ſubiect my people and Land, am now brought in ſubiection my ſelfe: O pitifull

Sebona: the Phiſition of my diſeaſes: the comfort of all my troubles: the eaſe of all my griefes, vnderſtand my ſorrowes: fulfil my mind: reſtore him that is banished frō al pleaſures, to find ſome ioy: thy loue shal be thy renownathy beutie shalbe thy pleaſures and vvealth: the comely neſſe of thy bodie, shalbe rular of this Land and countrey. Let me receaue ſome comfort againe of theſe earneſt letters: or elſe if I be forſaken my ſvveete Sebona: as thou before haſt vvounded mee, ſo preſently novve haſt thou killed me: as thou haſt punished me, ſo novv haſt thou brought me to vtter deſtruction. Heare the pittifull crie of a King, that deſireth to revvard thy Loue in making thee a Queene.
                     
                     The ende of the kinges letters.
                  
               
               AFter theſe letters were receaued by Sebona: that whore, and filthy harlot, had counſell by her neare friends, neyther to ſend, or go, or write: or by any meanes to geue ye King any comfort of his letters, for as they ſurmyſed, the King practyſed rather to ſatiſſye his affection &amp; voluptuous luſt, then to tye himſelf to yt immaculate renowned, glory, vertuous mariage:

and in eſtraunging her ſelf in the mater, the kinges earneſt deſire woulde both increaſe towards her, and alſo would the readyer indue her in the eſtate of ye kingdome: which if ſhe would laciuiouſly anſwere the kings wanton letters, the king would vſe 
                     •
                  er as a harlot, to ſerue his preſent affection, and alſo ſuſpect her light behauiour to be the lewder. But the king perceauing her contemptuous ſtraunge Loue, or rather whoriſh polycie, neyther in ſending vnto him, neyther anſwering his letters, or yet in comforting his amorous agonies, with her preſence, beganne not onely to hate her, but alſo vtterly to renounce her: which partly might proceede of his kingly ſtomacke, partly of his voluptuous luſt had with diuers other infamous harlots ſquenched in the ſtinking lake of concupiſcence: ſo it came to paſſe that Sebona &amp; her friends were very ſory, for that theyr polycie, was pretudiciall, both to the king &amp; them ſelues: to the king in not hauing his purpoſe, and to them ſelues, both for that they had loſt ye kinges fauour, &amp; the commodity that might haue ryſen thereby: they thought they woulde not omyt ſo happy opportunity being ofred,

for a lowring countenaunce. This Sebona who had bene the Aſcalons whore of the holy Alſephon, practiſed with the aforeſayde Aſcalon, what was to be done. The Aſcalon reſpecting the famylyaritye that had paſſed betwéene them, the Aſcalon could not deny Sebonaes requeſt, conſidering alſo that if ſhée were preferred, his renowne woulde bee alſo increaſed: practiſed with an olde woman that was a witche, and alſo in tyme paſt Sebonaes bawde: for which cauſe wyllinger to further the matter, and with the beſt indeuor that conſiſted in her, to doo good vnto Sebona: By ſorcery (this olde ryuen witch) did vnderſtand, both where ye gouernment of the kingdome, and the preſeruation of the king dyd conſiſt: which was in the gréene Garland that hanged vp in the holy Alſephon: which ſo long as the Garland hangd there, no euyl fate, or infortunate cōdicion of life could approch the kings perſon: but ſo ſoone as ye garland was deflowred, the kings renowne, riches, honor, glory, pōpe, fame, were fully &amp; wholy in the power of thē that had gotten the ſame the Aſcalon neyther reſpecting the holines of the function, the office of the place, neyther the

ſanctimonyall reuerence due to the place: nor the feare of the holy Image: nor his duety to the king: or yet the commodity that might redown to the common welth: practifed with this filthy whore Sebona to rauiſh this holy Alſephon with ſacriledge, and to ſteale this floriſhing gréene Garlande of Thiſtles. And as ſoone as they had burned the ſayd Garland of thiſtles, the king perceyued a force to goe from him: in the audacity of his countenance: of which before he was bolde, became nowe ſhamefaſt: in his ſtrength: of which before he was mighty, was now weake: in his ſtomacke: of which before he was coragious, was nowe full of cowardnes: in his wiſdom: of which before he was prudent, was now fooliſh. Thus the king in ye eyes of al men, was marue

                  louſly altred, &amp; his complexion changed: ſo that in ſteede of a king, you would haue adiudged him a priſoner: in ſteede of a rular, you would haue adiudged him a wretche: in ſtéede of a knight of armes, you would haue adiudged him a ca

And alſo ſince that, vnderſtanding the great alteration and abatement that is fallen vppon your

grace, the emptineſſe of ſuch a hungry tree as I am, not worthy to bee fedde by ſuch a ſweete barke, and delectable rinde, as the bright perſonage of ſo comly a gentlemā, may be ashamed to preſent my ſelf before your grace: my vnworthineſſe conſidered. But chiefly I feared your letters were rather the dalying pleaſures of a King: then the faithfull affection of loue: which ſince vnderſtanding the great anguishes of lurking loue, that haue aſſaulted your royall noble hart: I ſorrowed, and was in a heauie hate with my ſelfe: for that I had not long before this haue aunſwered your worthie writings: not deſerued to be writtē, to ſuch a vnthankfull creature as I am: Although feare and shamefaſtneſſe haue ſkalded my harte, that I durſt not write in time: ſo I truſt my letters do not come to ſo worthy &amp; fauourable a king out of time: which if any ſorrow of ſickneſſe be fallen vpō you, and the Phiſition of your health &amp; chirurgion of your ſoares.

                           THe nobility and ſoueraigne renowne of the king, with al the condicion of his worthy vertues, is neyther vnknowne to mee, nor the people: for that we haue had great and long tryall of the ſame: ſince that it is a needeles thing to trouble you, with that you vnderſtande alreadie. So at this preſent tyme it doeth not, but in the way of remembrance, belongeth to my office to ſpeake of the ſame: I being appointed the holy Aſcalon of this bleſſed Alſephon, wyl put you in duety of the ſolempnization of this mariage, whiche is betweene a King and Queene, the lyke was neuer ſeen in this land before: for that obedience bynding vs, both to render thanks, and with great ioye of hartes to triumph:

are alſo muche bounde to ſet forth this preſēt daie, with the greateſt renown that maie be either thought or done: for that Hellidorus our king hath maried ſo vertucus a Queen, a virgin of vnſpeakeable chaſtitie, the flower garland of this land of the Raellyans, am not to deſiſt to praiſe her, both for that our king hath recouered his health thorow her: our lande is guerdoned thorow her: our people renowned thorow her: other nations put in feare thorow her: O Sebona moſt ſoueraigne Queene: thy bewty was the Phiſition of our King: thy bewty is the bulwarke of this lande: thy wiſdome is both the ſubiection, and direction of the people: Shall not this lande of the Raellians thorow this worthy Queen, obtaine double royaltie? is not this Sebona Queene of the Raellyans, the flagrantes flower that euer ſweetelie and delicatlye ſprong vp amōg the Raellians? as she hath vowed her chaſtitie to one man, ſo she shyneth in the eyes of all men: As she is to be beloued of all men: ſo she loueth but one man: and yet hateth no man: O precious iewell, the rareneſſe hereof aſtonieth the hartes of all men, and yet comforteth the harte of one man: renowne is her victorie:

bewtie, is her praiſe: eſtimation, the duetie of her florishing fame: can any tonge ſet forth her deſerued praiſe? beutie? renown? comlynes? al the qualities vvhich decorate her vvith ineſtimable ſoueraigntie? So my hart is not able to thinke any vertue comparable to the ſame. As touching this Garlande vvhich hanged vp in this Alſephon, and now taken awaie: the vvant herof O king let it not amaze thee: for this holy Image vvhich deliuered the beutifull Sweete poyſon. chaſtitie and vertuous vviſedome of this Sebona, Queene of the Raellyans into thy handes, vvyll alſo delyuer that Traytour vvhiche tooke this florishing Garlande crowne avvaye out of the holy Alſephon? O king Hellidorus, as this vvor thy Sebona doth garnishe thy lande vvith all the florishing flowers of fame: ſo is she deckte vvith the pleaſures of Venus odyferous ſmelling garden. O king beutifie her againe vvith loue, ſoueraigntie, condigne renowne, vvealth, fame, florishing pleaſures, mete and fit for a Queene.

So, the Aſſyrians lamenting the infortunate hap of Hellydorus: and for that noble minde they perceyued alwayes to bee in him: in reuenge whereof, they perſecuted Quéene Sebona &amp; the Aſcalon, to a moſt terryble death: for they were pricked to death with néedles, as the king of the Hircans was, and their dead carkaſes were throwne lyke carren into the wylderneſſe to bée deuowred of the Fowles of the ayre: the Lande of the Raellyans was inhabited of the Aſſyrians, for euer after.

               THe King of the Aſſyrians hauing conquered the Lande of the Raellyans, dryue out and dyſperſed the people, the Lande was fully impeopled with the Aſſyrians. The king of the Aſſyrians, after his being ſetled in the kingdome: on a tyme for pleaſaunt recreation, dyd ryde forth a hunting into the wylderneſſe: bychaunce in the ſayde wylderneſſe, in a great brake of buſhes, his houndes found an Aſſe, which they courſed and bayted ſo ſore, before any ſuccour coulde drawe neare: that the ſayd houndes had drawne the guts out of the Aſſes bellye: the braying of the Aſſe, &amp; the noyſe of the hounds, heing hearde of the King and his nobles, drewe neare: perceauing it was an Aſſe, tooke vp the houndes: and the Aſſe being halfe dead, ſpake vnto the king of the Aſſyrians in this ſort.
            
            
               
               ¶ The wordes of King Hellidorus, when he was an Aſſe.
               O King of the Aſſyrians, I am Hellydorus that was once King of the Raellyans: heare mée: which although I am in the forme of an Aſſe: yet haue I the minde of a man: O idolatry dyd deuowre mée and my Lande: the blood of a holye Prophete doth crye out againſt mée: O my tyranny is turned to myſerie: O my heauy fate, I was deceaued by a wicked woman, &amp; ſubdued to wretchedneſſe: the forgetting of the eternall gouernance, and the blind worſhipping of an Image, which was an Aſſe, hath tranſformed mee from a man to an Aſſe: O King of the Aſſyrians, as thy houndes haue wounded mée to death: yet honorablie bury my dead carkaſe: which although it be the ſhape of an Aſſe, yet it is the carkaſe of King Hellydorus, which hath a penitent hart. Preſently dying, the king of the Aſſirians did burye the dead carkaſe, and builded a very rytche gorgeous Tombe ouer it, in the myddeſt of the wyldernes, with theſe Epigrams written ouer the ſame: and an Aſſe portrayed in Adamant ſtone vppon the ſame.
            
            
               
               The verſes wrytten ouer King Hellydorus his Tombe.
               
                  Ah cruell fate, O noble King,
                  Subdued by natures kind,
                  Although in ſhape thou art an Aſſe:
                  Thou waſt a man in mynde.
               
               
                  Though wretched treaſon did tranſlate,
                  By ſteightes of Venus luſt,
                  Such was the hap and fruitles fate:
                  In thee to be diſcuſt.
               
               
                  A noble king durſt Nature race,
                  The guerdon of thy right,
                  To chaunge a king to be an Aſſe:
                  VVhich did appeare ſo bright?
               
               
                  This king was beate with cruell roddes,
                  Before his fatall day,
                  In glorious pompe and wallowing wealth:
                  There is no hope or ſtaye.
               
            
            FINIS.
