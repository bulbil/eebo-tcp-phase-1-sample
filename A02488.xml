            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            TO
THE PRINCE
his Highness, my gracious
Lord and
Master.
            
               WHat hath heeretofore been
presented to your Highnesse
eare, I heere make
bolde (with some little
change) to present afresh
to your eye: that you may beholde
at one view the entire body of those
discourses which were delivered disiointly
and by peece-meale; as also
that you may revise that at leasure
(if ought therein shall be thought
worth revising) which was sometimes

of necessi
                  •
               y shuffled up in haste, though
I must confesse to mine owne comfort
and your honor, never heard but with
singular attention; and lastly, that I
may serve your Highness in somwhat,
as well absent as present▪ specially now
that your frequent presence with his
Majesty enforceth your often absence
from your Familie.
            I adventure then, most noble Prince,
to unfolde and lay before your view
the Vow of DAVID (as seasonable I
hope to the times, as suitable to the
person) for the reformation and government
of himselfe, his housholde
and State; whether made before his
comming to the Crowne, or newly
upon it, it is not certaine to define, nor
very materiall to know: once wee are
sure, it was DAVIDS Vow: which one
Motive me thinks were of weight sufficient
to stirre-up all Christian Princes
(specially such as professe the defence of
the Christian faith) to a serious meditation
thereon, even in that it was DAVIDS
Vow; who so lived and so died,

as never Prince (I thinke, before him
nor perhaps since him) so joyned together
Valour and Vertue, Courage
and Humility, Policy and Piety, Thrift
and Bounty, Solemnity and Devotion,
Greatness and Goodness.
            Without flattering the present times,
I might safely and justly say unto you,
Et Pater Aeneas, &amp; avun
                     •
                  ulus excitet
Hector.
            
            The former of which (as the world
well knoweth) hath added to his practice
singular precepts of this kinde;
by which hee as much surpasseth other
Kings, as Kings doe ordinary men, or
men the brute creatures. Yet I thought
it not amisse to adde therunto the practice
and precepts of that King who
received such a testimony from the
mouth of God as never did any; and
farre surpassed that, in reall acts, which
Xenophon of Cyrus conceived onely in
imagination.
            This King then if you please to propose
to your selfe as a paterne, and his

Vow as a rule, we may by Gods helpe
one day promise to our selves another
Charlemaine, or rather the perfections
of all the Edwards &amp; Henries, &amp; Iameses
your renowned progenitors united in
one Charles: and, your proceeding
and ending answering your gracious
beginnings and vertuous disposition
(which wee all hope and pray for) wee
may rest assured thereof.
            For the effecting of which, you cannot
doe better than performe in deed
what you have chosen for your word,
Si vis omnia subijcere, teipsum subijce rationi;
which is truely to be a King. For,
in so doing you will valew Soveraignetie,
not by impunity of doing evill,
but power of doing good; and in
attayning it▪ onely be enabled for the
doing of that good which before you
desired.
            And if this poore Worke of mine,
or any my endeavours, either have
or shall any way conduce to the furtherance
of that publike and important

worke, I shall therein reape a sufficient
reward both of my service and
travailes; accounting it my greatest
happinesse on earth to have been counted
worthy to be

               YOV, it was, mine Honourable
and worthy Friends, to whom
(next after our Gracious Master)
these ensuing Sermons
were first and chiefly directed: You may iustly
then claime a part in them: and I wish
they may prove as fruitfull unto you, as they
were intended. Sure I am, they wil not prove
unfruitfull, if you compose your selves to the
Glass they hold forth, striving to present you
such to your Master, as they represent to you;
that is, such as seek not to rise, save to get the
vantage-ground for the doing of more good:
such, as preferre their Masters good before
their owne gain; their Masters safety before

their owne ease, their Masters credit before
their owne advancement: such, as in preferring
sutes aim not at their private ends th

the sides of the Publike, nor use faire
pretenses for the compassing of foule proiects
or the smothering of honest motions; nor, lastly,
look so much to the purse and power of
Petitioners, as to their worths and necessities.
            A Master you have, born (I hope) in a
happy houre for the good of the Christian
world: of whom it may bee truely said,

                  Antevenit sortem meritis, virtutibus
annos,
                  Ingenio formam, relligione genus▪
                  
               
            
            Who not onely rewards and cherishes vertue,
but traceth out the path therof before you
with his own steps; best deserving that place,
by his ingraven courtesie and many Princely
endowments, which hee houlds by lineall descent.
Why then should any seek that favou
                  •
               
in the way of basenes and sycophancie, which
may more easily bee won in the plain and safe
way of vertue and honesty?
            Provocations to vice (I knowe) are not
wanting in the place wherein

               Daniel in Nebuchadnezzars,
a Ioseph in Pharaohs, and
some faithfull Christians even in Neroes
house; what may wee there expect, where
from the Chiefest are so many encouragements
to piety? in that Family, whose Head
(I dare say) rather glories in being a member
of the true Church, than the Second in the
Kingdome; rather in beeing baptized into the
religion hee professeth, than in beeing descended
from the royall stock of so many famous
Kings: and where religion is built up (be it
spoken without disparagement of other mens
labours, or relation to mine owne) by as sufficient
Master-workmen in their kindes▪ as
the Land affords; not thrusting themselves
into the Place, but all of them culled out and
called thither: not posting to Preferment by
indirect means; but, like sacred Lamps,
spending themselves to give you light, well
testified by your singular respect towards
them.
            Of my self, or this ensuing Worke, I will
say nothing. By the grace of God I am that I
am: and I hope it will appear in this Worke,

and the effects therof in you, that his grace in
me was not altogether in vain. Whatsoever it
bee, it is for your use: and whatsoever I am,

Realme, it being the Metropolis and head
Citie of the Kingdome, as also and principally

               AS the whole Scripture
is by inspiration from
God: so this Booke of
the Psalmes seemeth to
challenge a kinde of preheminence
above the rest; inasmuch as the Authour
of it was not onely a Prophet
and a King, but a man after Gods
owne heart, a Figure of Christ; or,
as Euthymius speaks, primi regis &amp; 
                     •
                  or,
&amp; lingua, &amp; calamus, the tongue, and
pen, and heart, of the King of Heaven.
            The several passages of this book
are more frequently and particularly

quoted by Christ and his Apostles,
then of any other of the ould
Testament. It was, and still is, more
usually both sung and read, not onely
in the Iewish Synagogues, but
Christian Assemblies, as well by the
People as the Minister; &amp; that with
more outward reverence then any
other part of holy Writ. It is put for
al the Books of the old Testamēt, as
they are differenced from the law of
Moses and the Prophets, Luke 24. 44.
And lastly, more Sermons, Commē
               taries,
Meditations, Expositions, Enarrations,
upon it have been made
and published, as well by the Iewish
Rabbins, as by the Doctors of the
Christian Church, then upon any
other scripture whatsoever. Nay,
the very Turks themselves swear as
solemnly by the Psalms of David, as
by the Alcoran of Mahomet. And in
truth, hee that hath either practically
tried, or shall duly consider, what
a rich store-house it is of all manner
of Prayers, Precepts, Exhortations

and Comforts, how this one celestiall
Fountaine yeeldeth all good necessarily
to bee knowne, or done, or
had; what a familiar introduction it
is to beginners, a mighty augmentation
of vertue &amp; knowledge in such
as are entred before, a strong confirmation
to the most perfect; may
easily conceive the reason why it
hath in all Ages bin esteemed even
of the best and most learned, as a
rare and precious Iewell, worthy to
be laid up in that Persian Casket imbroidered
with gould and pearle,
which Alexander reserved for Homers
Iliads. In regard whereof, our
good King Alured translated the
Psalter himself into his Saxon tong:
and one of the Emperours caused
this Book to bee bound up in a little
volume by it self, for the special and
daily use of himselfe and his attendants,
to serve them as a Manuall, &amp;
alwaies to attend them in their running
Library. And as I would not
sooner commend the reading of any

book to a Courtier then this: so
would I specially commend this
Psalm to the carefull reading and serious
meditation both of my Gracious
Master the Prince, and his religious
Followers. They shall both
finde their duties lively expressed in
it, as in a mirrour, howbeit it were
indeed first composed rather to expresse
the former then the later, and
my present choice of it bee chiefly
intended and directed to that purpose.
            This Psalme, by the consent of
Writers, is a vow of David: whether
made before or after his comming
to the Crowne, it is not certain, neither
skilleth it much; but, that it is
a vow, all agree. Since then, for the
Person, the maker of it was both of
understanding and power to make
it; since, for the Matter, the thing
therein vowed is both lawfull and
possible; since, for the Manner, hee
made it both deliberately and freely
with advice and without constraint;

and lastly, since the End of
it was to serve both as a bridle to
prevent and redresse sinne, and as a
spur to stirre him up and incite him
to vertue, and keep him close to the
duties therein promised: we are to
hould it not onely for a warrantable
but a commendable vow; nor only
commendable in David, but with
like commendation imitable by us
in like case. And as David made this
vow, so had hee speciall care to pay
it, 2. Sam. 8. 15. willing others to do
the like, Psal. 50; it beeing indeed
better (as his Son tells us, Eccles. 5. 5)
not at all to vow, than to vow and
not perform. Yet in wicked vowes,
as that of the Iewes, Acts 23. or in
rash vows, as that of Herod &amp; Iephte,
that of the Canonists houlds true;
In malis promissis rescinde fidem, in turpi
voto muta decretum: In wicked promises
hould not thy word, in shameful
vows change thy purpose: wherupon
St. Hierome worthily censures
Iephte, that hee was in vovendo stultus,

in praestando impius; naught in making
such a vow as he did, but worse
in performing it.
            The thing heer vowed is either
generall, in the first verse: or particular,
touching his own Person, from
the second verse to the fift; touching
his Attendants, Counsellers
and Officers, from the fift to the
eight; and lastly, touching the
Church and Common-wealth, in
the last.
            The matter by him vowed in generall
is contained in the first verse;
I will sing mercy and iudgement: unto
thee, O Lord, will I sing. Wherein,
without any curious descant or division,
wee may observe first the manner
of expressing this vow: it is by
way of singing, which implieth
cheerfulnesse and alacrity: for, Is any
merry, let him sing? Iames 5. And,
How should wee sing the Lords song in a
strange land? Psal. 137. As God loves
a cheerfull giver: so doth hee a
cheerfull vower. Secondly, the ditty,

or rather the burden of this song:
Mercy and Iudgement. Thirdly, the
Person to whom hee both sings and
vowes: it is the Lord.
            
            First then of his maner of expressing
this vow; I will sing. As ancient
and manifold as is the use of Musick,Gen. 4. 21.
so excellent was David in the
use thereof; a thing which delighteth
all Ages, and beseemeth all estates;
a thing as seasonable in grief
as in joy; as decent being added to
things of greatest weight and solemnity,
as beeing used when men most
sequester themselves from action. It
is apt both to quicken the spirits, &amp;
to allay that which is too eager; able
both to move and moderate all
affections: yea, such is the force and
efficacy thereof upon that very part
of man which is most divine, that
some have beene thereby induced
to think, that the soule of man is
composed of harmony. Which being
(to speak properly) of high and
lowe in sounds, a due proportionable

disposition, whether it be by instrument
or by voice; our Prophet,
the sweet Singer of Israel, having
singular knowledge in them both, as
also in the art of Poetry, judged
them all, as very usefull in civill affairs,
so in sacred actions and religious
exercises even in the house of
God it selfe not unusefull; leaving
behinde him to that purpose a number
of divinely indited poems (howbeit
their metre in the originall bee
now unknowne) and adding unto his
poetry melody, both vocall and instrumentall,
by ordaining some of
the Levites skilled in musicke to
praise the Lord by singing and playing
on instruments, to the number
of foure thousand, 1. Chro. 23. 5. who,
divided into severall companies, by
course served the Lord in his Sanctuary
for the raising up of mens
hearts, and sweetning their affections
towards God.
            The instruments they used in
praising the Lord are most of them

reckoned up in the last Psalm: all
which may be reduced to two sorts,
whereof one is called Negenoth, such
as made a sound by touching; the other,
Nechiloth, such as being hollow
made a sound by breathing. Sometime
the musicall instrument began,
and the singing voice followed, and
then the song was called Canticum
Psalmi: somtime again the song was
first sung with the voice, and the
musicall instrument followed, and
then it is called Psalmus Cantici: of
which sort it seems was this Psalm,
both sung privately by David for his
better remembrance therof, and by
him appointed to bee sung publikely
in the Congregation; as for the
good of others, so thereby to oblige
himself the more strictly to the performance
thereof.
            Before Davids time this singing of
sacred hymns was in use, as may appear
by the songs of Moses and Miriam,
Exod. 15. and of Deborah and Barach,
Iudg. 5. After him, his Sonnes

songs were no less then a thousand
and five, 1. Kings 4. 32. And one speciall
one of his we yet enjoy at this
day, by the name of Canticum canticorum,
the Song of songs; setting
forth unto us the mystical union between
Christ &amp; his Church. Christ
himself and his Disciples, according
to the custome of the Iewes, sung a
Psalme, Mat. 26. 30. Paul and Silas
sung in prison, Acts 16. 25. And,
to shew that it was a duty to continue
in the Church,Eph. 5. 19. both S. Paul and
S. Iames not onely exhort us to it,Col. 3 16.
but give us rules for the practice of
it.Iames 5. 13. In consideration whereof, the
Church of Christ doth likewise at
this present day retain it as an ornament
to Gods service, and an helpe
both to our edification and devotion:
neither can they well bee excused
from profanenesse, who eyther
scorn to doo it themselves, or scorn
others for the dooing of it. I will
shut up this point with an excellent
speech of S. Basils, touching this use

of singing psalms in Christian Families
or Congregations. Whereas
(saith he) the holy Spirit saw, that mankinde
is unto vertue hardly drawen, and
that righteousnes is the lesse accounted of,
by reason of the pronenesse of our affections
to that which delighteth; it pleased the
wisedome of the same Spirit to borrow
from melody that pleasure, which, mingled
with heavenly mysteries, causeth the
smoothnesse and softnesse of that which
toucheth the 
                     •
                  are, to convay as it were by
s
                     •
                  ealth the treasure of good things into
mans minde. To this purpose were those
harmonious tunes of the Psalmes devised
for us, that they which are either in years
but tender and greene, or touching perfection
of vertue as yet not growne to ripenesse,
might, when they think they sing,
learn. O the conceit of that heavenly Teacher!
which hath by his skill found out a
way, that, dooing those things wherein
we delight, we may also learn that wherby
wee profit. And so I com from our
Prophets manner of expressing his
vow (I will sing) to the burden of his

song, Mercy and Iudgement. I will sing
Mercy and Iudgement.
            
            The ditty or subject-matter of his
song hee promiseth should bee modest,
and grave, and useful; not light
and vain, or unsavory and fabulous,
much less filthy and unclean, fit for
nothing; but, as a sacrifice offred to
the Divell, to defile the mouth and
hart of the singer, to corrupt others,
and to offend chaste ears. For, if evill
words corrupt good manners,
much more lewd songs; which, the
more artificiall they are, the more
dangerous and pestilent are their effects;
the pleasantnes of their tune
with more facility and less suspicion
convaying their poison unto the
soule. Vse not the company of a woman
that is a singer and a dancer, neither hear
her, lest thou bee taken by her craftinesse,
Ecclus. 9. 4. To which purpose it was
not unfitly spoken by the Roman
Historian touching Sempronia a gentlewoman
of Rome,Salust. that shee was
taught psallere &amp; saltare elegantiùs

quàm modestam decebat, to sing and
dance more gracefully then becam
a modest woman. Besides, these amorous
and wanton songs and sonnets,
as they serve the Divels turn to
convay poison into the minde: so
doo they abate the edge of the masculine
vigour thereof, bending and
turning it by degrees from a manly
martiall disposition to an effeminate
softness.

per
                     •
                  o, in regard of his extraordinary

skill in singing.
            Now, as the matter of our Prophets
song was not fabulous or wanton:
so was it not diffamatory or libelling
stuffe, impeaching any mans
reputation, such as the drunkeards
made upon him, Psal. 69. 12; a lash
which the greatest Princes cannot
avoid, and the best sometimes feel:
but the knowne authors thereof are
by so much the more severely to
be censured, as they deeply wound,
and are hardly discovered. Finally,
the matter of his song was not his
own triumphs and victories, though
they were many and glorious, aswel
against strangers abroad, as rebels at
home; hee left that to others, Saul
hath slain his thousand, and David his
ten thousand. And thus having taken
a brief view what the matter of our
Prophets song was not, though too
too rife now-adaies both in Court,
and City, and Country; let us now
consider what it was: Mercy &amp; Iudgement.
And first take them jointly: not

Mercy without Iudgement, nor
Iudgement without Mercy, but
Mercy and Iudgement both together,
like Rahel and Leah, which
twain did build the house of Israel;
or like Moses and Elias at the transfiguration
of Christ, whereof the one
was the meekest man upon earth,
and the other the most zealous of
the Prophets.
            As the badge of the Ship S. Paul
               
                  •
               ailed-in was Castor and Pollux, two
twinnes; so the badge of this Psalm
is Mercy and Iudgement, inseparable
companions: of whom it may bee
said, as our Prophet sometime spake
of Saul and Ionathan, they were lovely
and pleasant in their lives, and in their
deaths they were not divided. The two
brightest Stars they are in the firmament
of Majesty; the two fairest
Flowers, and choicest Iewels in the
Imperiall Crown; like the Carnation
and the Lilly, the Ruby and the
Saphire, or the Carbuncle and the
Diamond, yeelding a mutuall and

interchangeable Iustre each to other,
They resemble not unfitly the
two supporters of the Kings armes,
or the two Seraphins stretching out
their golden wings over the Propitiatory;
or the white and red Rose
in the same Escutchion.
            We read,1 Kings 7. that Salomon set up two
goodly pillars in the porch of the
Temple, the one called Iachin, the
other Boaz; which signifie Stability
and Strength: such pillars of the
State are Mercy and Iudgement. The
Throne of the King is borne up by
them, as Salomons was with Lions of
Ivory on each side. Therefore, as in
one place it is said, that the Throne is
established by iustice,
               pro. 16. 12. so in another, that
it is upheld with Mercy:
               pro. 20. 28. Iustice beeing
as the bones and sinewes in the body
politicke, and Mercy as the veins
&amp; arteries. They are the two hands
of Action, the two eies of Vertue,
and the two wings of Honour. And
as the eyes, if they bee rightly set,
doo both look one way: so do Mercy

and Iudgement; how-ever in the apprehension
of the vulgar they seem
to look contrary waies. And as the
Trebble and the Base accord best in
Musick: so do they in managing the
Common-weal
                  •
               h. Wherefore David
promiseth to make them both

                  •
               ound tuneable in his song without
jarre or discord: I will sing Mercy and
Iudgement.
            
            The answer of Apollonius to Vespasian
is full of excellent instruction.
Vespasian asked him what was Nero's
overthrowe: he answered; Nero
could touch and tune the Harp well, but
in government sometimes hee used to
winde the pinnes too high, and sometimes
to let them down too lowe; thereby intimating,
that hee applied Causticks
and Corrosives where gentle Lenitives
would have served the turne,
&amp; again he applied Lenitives where
Corrosives were needfull. Sometimes
hee administred Iustice without
Mercy, and sometimes Mercy
without Iustice; Iustice without

Mercy beeing nothing else but cruelty,
like Esau red and rough, bitter
as wormwood; and Mercy without
Iustice, but fond pity &amp; foolish partiality.
As Mercy then serves to abate
the edge and rigour of Iustice:
so doth Iustice, to quicken the slownes,
and sharpen the dulness of Mercy.
As Mercy without Iustice is cō
               temned:
so Iustice without Mercy
is hated.
            Astronomers conceive, that the
Crystalline Sphear, which they suppose
to be the waters above the heavens
(mentioned in the first of Genesis)
is set next the first Mover, for allaying
the heat thereof; which, by
reason of the incomprehensible
swiftnes of its motion, would otherwise
set the whole world on fire.
This I take to bee but a fancy of
theirs: but Mercy, I am sure, is set
so neer Iustice, for the cooling and
tempering of it. Hee that iustifieth the
wicked, and he that condemneth the righteous,
they are both an abomination to the

Lord, Pro. 17. 15. Now, he that pretends
Mercy, but without Iustice,
will bee sure to justifie the wicked;
and again, hee that pretends Iustice,
but without Mercy, cannot but condemne
the righteous: but the right
mixture and true temper of both, justifies
the righteous, and condemns
the wicked. Which temper is by S.
Paul commended to the publique
Magistrate, Rom. 13: If thou doo well,
hee is the Minister of God for thy good;
but, to take vengeance of thee, if thou do
evill. And by S. Peter in his first Epistle
and second chapter, They are
sent of God for the punishment of evill
doers, and the praise of them that do well.
All precepts touching supream Governours
are in effect comprehended
in these two Remembrances;
Memento quod es homo, and Memento
quod es Deus, or vice Dei: Remember
thou art a man, remember thou art a
God, or in stead of God; the one to
bridle their power, the other their
will. From the former of which issue

the acts of Mercy, and from the
other of Iustice: nay, the verie remembrāce
that they are vice-gods,
is sufficient to put them in minde of
both, inasmuch as Gracious and righteous
is the Lord, and all his paths are
Mercy and Truth, Psal. 25. Hee hath
not one path of Mercy, and another
of Truth: but all his paths are Mercie
and Truth; like Crimsin and White
Silk twisted together, or woven one
within the other. His red Cross of
Iustice is ever set in the white streamer
of Mercy; as the rod of A
                     •
                  ron
and the pot of Manna were by his
commandement laid up in the same
Ark.
            Through the thickest &amp; blackest
cloud of his Iustice alwaies appears
some beams or sparks of Mercy: and
the clearest sunshine of his Mercy is
overshadowed with showres of Iustice.
What infinite Mercy did hee
shew in the redemption of mankind,
when he might justly have tumbled
them down, as hee did the Apostate

Angels to the bottomless pit of hel
                  •
               
and yet withall, what infinite Iustice
did hee express in the same action,
in laying the sinnes of the whole
world, and the punishment due to
sinne, upon the shoulders of his innocent,
best-beloved, and only-begotten
Son! And thus did his wisedom
finde out a way for the making
of his Mercy and Truth one path:
much like Zal
                     •
                  uchus, who shewed
his Iustice in causing one of his sons
eyes to bee put out for comitting
adultery, according to a law newly
before made by himselfe; and his
Mercy, in putting out one of his
owne for the sparing of the other of
his sons, which the law also required
to have been put out. Hence S.
Peter represents God unto us both
as a Father and as a Iudge, in one &amp;
the same verse, 1. 1. 17; to shew, that
he is mercifull as a Father, and righteous
as a Iudge. So ought his Vicegerents
heer on earth; having therefore
a sceptre given them to putte

them in minde of Mercy, &amp; a sword
that they forget not Iustice; Scarlet
and Purple to think upon Iustice,
and white Miniver or Ermins to
remember Mercy: that so the people
committed to their charge may
sing with joyfull &amp; thankfull harts,
Mercy and Truth are met together;
               
                  
                     •
                   psal. 85. 
               Righteousnes
&amp; Peace have kissed each other.
And themselves at last may finde Salomons
saying true; Hee that followeth
after Righteousnes and Mercy,
               pro. 21. 21. 
               shall finde
life, righteousnes and glory: as holy Iob
did, who in his prosperity did not
onely put on Iustice as a robe and as a
crowne, by breaking the iawes of the unrighteous,
and plucking the prey out of his
teeth; but, expressed works of Mercy, in
beeing eyes to the blinde, and feet to the
lame, and a father to the poor, Iob. 29.
14. 15. 16. 17.
            Having thus handled these two
Vertues jointly together, let us now
take a view of them single &amp; apart:
for, though they neither be, nor can
be, really and in action severed each

from other, yet may they by conceit
and imaginary abstraction. First
then of Mercy, because it is both
heer and elsewhere set in the first
place: and that not casually, but of
purpose, and by due desert; as Peter
is commonly first named of the Apostles,
like the Fore-man of the Iury,
having a primacy of order before
them, though not a supremacy of Iurisdiction
over them. And as Mercy
is heer set in the first pl
                  •
               ce: so
shall the Sentence of Mercy &amp; Absolution
bee first pronounced at the
last Day. And it is a laudable custom
of Princes, at their first entrance to
their Kingdoms, to shew Mercy, by
hearing the mourning of the Prisoner,
and delivering the children of
death, by loosing the bands of wickednes,
by taking off the heavie burdens,
by letting the oppressed goe
free, and by breaking every yoke of
former extortions. Thus, our Prophet
himself, as soon as the Crowne
was settled on his head, made enquiry

if there remained yet alive any
of the house of Saul, on whom he
might shew Mercy, 2. Samuel 9. O
how fair a thing is this Mercy in the
time of anguish and trouble! It is
like a cloud of rain that commeth in
the time of drouth. But this Mercy,
heer spoken of in the first part of our
Prophets song, stretcheth further;
unfolding it self in Clemency, in Courtesie,
and in Compassion: In Clemencie,
by pardoning malefactors; in Compassion,
by releeving the afflicted;
in Courtesie, towards all. Of this later
I shall heerafter have occasion to
speak, in handling those words, A
froward heart shall depart from me. For
the present then it shall suffice to
commend unto your consideration
and practice the two former; Compassion
and Clemency.
            
            
               Compassion is a vertue, saith Aquinas,
non quâ mo
                     •
                  us est sensitivi appetitussed
intellectivi, a ratione directus
&amp; dirigens inferioris appetitus motum;
not as it mooves the sensitive appetite

but the rationall, being directed
by reason, and directing the motion
of the inferiour appetite. It consisteth
in releeving the afflicted, and
righting the oppressed; by receiving
their petitions, by hearing
their grievances, by granting their
reasonable sutes, by dispatch of Iustice,Cap. 32. 11.
by beeing unto them (as the
Prophet Esay speakes) a hiding place
from the winde, a refuge from the tempest,
as rivers of waters in a dry place,
and as the shadow of a great rocke in a
wearisome land. It was well said of
Augustus, that Petitions should not bee
given to a Prince, as meat to an Elephant
that one is afraid of.
            
            To these hero
                  •
               call works of Mercy,
may bee added, as peculiar to a
Prince, the easing of the Subject
from the burden of immoderate
tribute; the protecting of them frō
the rapine and spoil as wel of homebred
Pirats and Robbers, as forren
nations; the redeeming of poor captives,
especially from the slavery of

the professed enemies of IESVS
CHRIST; the erecting of Hospitals
for fatherlesse children, wounded
souldiers, decayed tradesmen,
and aged or impotent people. In
which regard, Iames the fift, King of
Scotland, was worthily tearmed,
The poor mans King.
            
            Now, as Compassion thus shewes
is self in releeving the afflicted, and
righting the oppressed: so dooth
Clemency, in winking at some faults,
in pardoning others where is hope
of amendment, in providing the punishment
exceed not the proportion
of the offense; and, lastly, in pronouncing
Sentence of death with a
kinde of reluctancy and unwillingnes,
casting a severe eye upon the
example, but a pitifull upon the person:
And heerin doth Clemency include
Compassion.
            
            It is an ungentle and inhumane
thing for a Prince, delectarisono catenarum,
to delight in the rattling of
of chaines and fetters; as a Carter,

that is never well, longer then he is
hearing the lash of his whippe. But
a right noble disposition it was in
Augustus, quem dare poenas apparebat
cum exigeret, who seemed himself to
suffer when he inflicted punishment
on others; and in Vespasian, qui neque
caede cuiusquam laetatus, iustis supplicijs
illacrymavit etiam &amp; ingemuit, who
was so far from delight in the death
of any, that he often wept and groaned
even at just and necessary executions;
and of Nero himselfe at his
first comming to the Empire, if hee
dissembled not: who beeing importuned
by Burrus to signe a warrant
for the execution of certain malefactors,
his answer was, O utinam literas
nescirem! I could wish I had never
learned to write or read. But above
all, Nihil quicqu
                     •
                   gloriosius principe
impune laeso, ther is nothing more
honourable for a Prince, than sometimes
to passe over injuries against
his owne Person. The patience of
Augustus heerein was rare and singular:

               probrosis in se dict is arrisit, hee
made himself merry with reproachful
speeches touching himself; therin
manifesting as his Clemency, so
also his Wisedome: in as much as
convitia si excandescas agnita videntur,
spreta exolescunt: railings, where they
move choler, seem acknowledged;
but contemned, they vanish. That
memorable speech of our late famous
Queen to this purpose wil never
bee forgotten; that, next the
Scriptures, shee knew no Book did
her so much good as the often reading
of Se
                     •
                  eca de Clementia: wherein
shee was taught like a good Chirurgion
not to cutte off any member,
whē any other remedy would serve
the turn; and then to do it not without
sighes and tears.
            These bee the diverse tunes and
strains, the severall notes and steps
of Mercie's Song; then which nothing
is more pleasing in the ears of Men
and Angels, nothing more acceptable
unto God. For, though he professe,

that he preferreth Iustice before
Sacrifice, Pro. 21. 3; yet of Mercy
hee pronounceth, that Sacrifice
is no way comparable unto it: I will
have Mercy &amp; not Sacrifice, Mat. 9. 13.
Nay, of Mercy S. Iames testifieth,
that it reioyceth or glorieth against iudgement.
And our Prophet, that as the
Faithfulnesse of God, which is a part of
his Iustice, reacheth to the Clouds; so
doth his Mercy to the Heavens, farre above
the Clouds, Psal. 36. 5. Where
there is no Mercy to bee hoped for,
there men growe obstinate and desperate:
but, where Mercy is expected,
there is Reverence and a filiall
Fear. Ther is Mercy with thee that thou
maist bee 
                     •
                  eared, Psal. 130. 4.
            And if Mercy breed Feare, much
more Love, the most kindly &amp; proper
fruit thereof, the surest guard of
Princes persons and estates. Castles
and Fortresses, walled Towns, stored
Arcenals and Armories, a Navy
of Ships, Troopes of Horse, thousands
of Foot, a masse of Treasure,

Ordinance and Artillery, cannot afford
him so safe a defence in the
day of trouble, as the Love &amp; Prayers
of his Subjects, purchased by
dealing mercifully with them. As
then he expects Mercy at the hands
of God: so let him deal mercifully
with those whom God hath put into
his hands. And as the Mercie of
God is over all his works: so let the
mercy of his most lively image heer
upon earth shine above all his other
vertues; above them, I say, but not
without them: for, though Mercy
bee heer set in the first place, yet is
it coupled with Iudgement, as milk
and blood that mingled stood. Iudgement,
like another Iacob, layes hould upon
Mercie's heel: and though Mercy, like
Pharez, bee first borne, yet instantly
followes Iudgement, like Zarah, with
his red thread about his arme. Nay,
without Iudgement, Mercy cānot subsist;
in as much as by due execution
of Iustice upon particular members
Mercy is shewed in preserving the

whole body. And as filiall Feare is
procured by Mercy; so is unfained
Love by such Iustice. As Mercy
then is the more beautiful, the more
comely and amiable Vertue: so is
Iustice at times the more necessary.
            It hath long been, and still is, a
Question controversed between
Physicians and Philosophers, whether
the Braine or the Heart be the
more principal member; in as much
as the one is the fountain of life, the
other of sense: so mee thinks, when
I compare these two Vertues together,
Mercy is like the Brain qualifying
the immoderate heat of those
spirits that are bred in the heart; but
Iustice, like the heart it self, the fountain
of those spirits. Now, because
I am to speake of the administration
heerof in handling the last verse of
this Psalme, I will pass to my third
and last part proposed in my Text;
the Person to whom this Song and
this Vow are addressed, and that is
the Lord: Tibi O Iehova psallam, to

thee, O Iehovah, will I sing.
            This Name Iehovah, anciently
tearmed Nomen tetragrammaton, the
name of foure letters, was to the
Iewes so venerable, that they never
durst pronounce it (as fearing to pollute
it with their lips) but Adonai
(which also signifieth Lord) in stead
thereof. Of all the Appellations given
to God in holy Scripture, it is alone
reserved as peculiar to himself,
and never imparted to any Creature:
neither doo we finde it given
to God till hee had created man;
thereby to teach us, that as man was
by him made a subordinate Lord of
the other Creatures: so was he the
independent and absolute LORD
both of him and them.
            To this great Iehovah then, this
most Soveraigne Lord, this Lord of
lords it is, that David addresseth his
Song and his Vow. Hee was himselfe
a great Lord, the grand Commander
of a mighty and populous
Nation: yet he acknowledgeth this

Lord to bee by infinite degrees higher
and greater than himself, and himself to
be but a worm in comparison of Him.
First then, of his singing to this Lord, then
of his vowing unto him, and lastly of his
vowing and singing unto him Mercy and
Iustice.
            
            Wee ought in our singing n
                  •
               t so
much to respect the delighting of our
selves or others with the sweet tuneablenesse
of the voice, as to do worship
to God by it, and to edifie our consciences.
It is both ryme and reason,

                  Non Vox, sed Votum; non chordula Musica,
sed Cor;
                  Non Clamans, sed Amans, cantat in
aure Dei.
                  The Heart, not Harp; Devotion, not
the Voice;
                  The Lover, not the Lowd, GOD's
ears rejoice.
               
            
            Not so much the Lute-string, as the
Heart-string; nor so much the shrill
Voice, as the zealous Affection, sounds
in the ears of God. And heerunto accords
the Apostle; Singing and making

melody to the Lord in your hearts, Eph. 5. 19.
And againe; Singing with a grace in your
hearts to the Lord, Colos. 3. 16: not to your selves,
but to the Lord; or, at leastwise,
rather to the Lord, than to your selves.
            Now, as hee addresseth his Song, so
doth he his Vow unto the same Lord, according
to his owne Counsell; Vow &amp;
perform to the Lord your God, Psal. 76. 11.
The reason is, because all Invocation is
due unto God; and a Vow is alwaies
joyned with invocation, either for the
obtaining the good wee desire, or the
avoiding the evill wee fear. Besides, it
is God only that knows the secret motions
of the heart. As then in that regard
we pray unto him alone: so unto
him alone are wee to direct our Vows,
who alone is able either to punish us if
wee break them, or to reward us if wee
keep them.
            Lastly, a Vow beeing nothing else
but a promissory oath: as wee are to
swear by none but God; so are wee to
vow to none but God. And, as the properties
of an oath are, Truth, Iudgement
               
and Iustice: so are they also of a Vow:
Iudgement, for the avoiding of rash
vows; Iustice, for the avoiding of wicked
vowes; and Truth, for the performance
of such as are neither wicked
nor rash, but are made upon good advice,
and tend to good ends.
            Finally, our Prophet both sings and
vows Mercy and Iudgement to the Lord;
thereby acknowledging GOD, as his
guide both in the entrance and accomplishment
of all actions, so in speciall of
Mercy and Iustice; and that he would
exercise these imperiall Vertues not so
much to content himself, or to gratifie
men, as to please and glorifie God: not
so much because men expected it, or
commended it, as because God commanded
it, and would take account of
it. Concerning actions of like nature
done for humane respects, the Lord
hath said, they have their reward, Mat. 6. 2;
that is, acceptance, honour and reverence
from men, because they are done
to men: but the Iustice &amp; Mercy, that
have God for their object, and are referred

to his glory, and set him before
them who is the searcher of hearts;
they, I say, receive their recompence
from God. Many times it falleth out,
that the Prince causeth a wicked person
to bee executed: the deed is good;
but perhaps he is moved thereunto rather
with desire of revenge, or importunity
of suters, then with the detestation
and vileness of the fact: this work,
I say, in it selfe is just; for, the malefactour
by his sinne deserved the punishment:
yet hee that doth it is notwithstanding
unjust. So much doth vertue
desire to be cherished for her own sake,
or rather so much is God, the fountain
of all vertue, jealous of his honour, and
jealous also of our love, that hee will
have every thing, to the end it may bee
good indeed, referred unto himselfe,
and to the ends that he hath appointed:
as indeed all is taken and cometh from
him alone, and therefore should be referred
to him and his glory onely; as
the rivers, derived from the sea by secret
veins &amp; chanels, disburden themselves

with full mouth into the same again,
Eccles. 1. 7.
            To bee short: the Prince above all
should referre and approve his actions
to God, seeing that God alone, and not
man, hath set him up; and seeing also,
that hee is not to bee judged by men,
but by God. And now to conclude
this point: great and excellent things,
as wee see, are comprehended under
these two tearms, Mercy and Iudgement:
which are indeed the very summe and
abridgement of all that Kings should
either learn or doo. And, seeing they
are of so deep reach, and extend so far
as they doo, wee may thereby plainely
perceive, that it is no light charge To
be a King; neither is it an art easily learned,
To rule well.
            Let not Mercy and Truth forsake thee:
binde them on thy neck, and write them upon
the table of thine hart: so shalt thou finde favour
and good understanding in the sight of
God and man, Pro. 3. 3.
         
         
            
            Verse 2.
I will behave my self wisely in 
                  •
                perfect
way. O when wilt thou com unto me! I will
walk within my house with a perfect heart.
            AS, before, hee promised cheerfulnes
in singing; so heer hee promiseth
wisdome in behaviour: so that
hee would bee both merry and wise. In
the former verse wee have the generall
of his Vow: heer hee coms to the particulars;
and begins first with himself,
in this verse and the two next ensuing,
what hee would bee in respect of his
owne life and conversation. Neither
is it to bee omitted without observation,
that, before he come to deal more
specially about his publike Charge, he
first promiseth the orderly government
of his owne Person. He knew full well,
that it was the duty of such as have the
guidāce of others, to guide themselves
aright, if they meant by their counsell
and authority to keep them in good order.
For, as Poësie is a speaking kinde

of painting, and painting a dumb poësie:
so is the law a dumbe Magistrate,
and a good Magistrate a speaking law.
And indeed this is the common course:
Men desire to finde occasions, whereupon
to refuse or withstand the means
ordained for their good: if they can
espy any faults in such as teach or govern
them, they presently imagine, that
such should neither reproove nor punish
them. And, to say truth, with what
countenance can we rebuke or chastise
that in others, which our selves make
no conscience to commit▪ 
               Quintilian
defines an Orator to bee vir bonus dicendi
peritus, an honest man skilfull in speaking:
and we may define a good Prince
vir bonus regendi peritus, an honest man
skilfull in governing: which as it procures
a reverēce &amp; credit to his place
and person; so doth it strength and authoritie
to his lawes and admonitions.
            Tum pietate gravem, 
                  •
               ut meritis, si
forte virum quem
            Conspexêre, silent, arrectis
                  
                     
                  
                  que
                auribus adstant.
            
               Ill eregit dict is animos, et pector a mulcet.
            To which effect, Iob speakes of himselfe
not vauntingly or vainely, but to
comfort himself in his bitter affliction,
and to clear himself from false accusation;
The young men saw mee, and 
                     •
                  idde
themselves, the aged arose and stood up unto
mee: Men gave eare and waited, and held
their tongue at my counsell. After my words
they repl
                     •
                  ed not, and my talke dropped upon
them: and they waited upon mee as for the
rain and they opened their mouth as for the
later raine. Which power hee got in
mens mindes, not so much by his greatnes
as by his goodnes. The Evangelists
tell us of our Saviour, that hee spake as
one having authority; and the rather,
no doubt, because hee did as he spake:
whereas the Pharises lost their authority,
because they tought and did not.
Hee then that expects and desires, the
people should doo as hee adviseth or
commandeth, must command in the
stile of Abimelech, Iudg. 9: What you haue
seen me doo, make haste, and doo like mee;
and advise in the stile of Iosuah, I and my

house will serve the Lord, Iosuah 24. 15.
            When Alexander would have punished
one for his Piracy, hee tould
him to his face, that himselfe was the
Arch-pirate of the world. Princes as
they act their parts upon an high
                  •
               stage,
so is the least errour in their action presently
discerned; it beeing in every
mans eye. A small fault in them is as a
mole or wart in the midst of the face,
which cannot be hid. And as men most
greedily gaze upon the Sunne when it
is eclipsed: so doo the multitude more
willingly discourse of the imperfections
and vices of their Leaders, then of
their vertues; thereby hoping to justifie
themselves, &amp; to scape unpunished.
The best way then to have a Law well
executed, is for the Author of it first to
keep it himselfe in his owne Person.
            —Tunc observantior aequi
            Fit populus, nec ferre negat, cum viderit
ipsum
            Authorem parêre sibi:—
            —nec sic inflectere sensus
            Hum
                  •
               nos edicta valent, ut vita regentis.
            
               There the people readily obey, and
follow after; willingly yeelding their
necks to the yoke, where they see the
Magistrate goe before in the observation
of his owne Edicts. Neither do any
perswasions or threats prevaile with
them so much as that; it beeing the nature
of man rather to be led thē drawn:
to bee led by reason or example, then
to bee drawne by penalty and force of
law. And because it is to the Vulgar
difficult to conceive the reason even of
reasonable Commands, the greatest
part have ever bin led rather by example
then by reason; the Lives of their
Superiours beeing by them esteemed
the fairest &amp; safest Copy they can rule
their actions by. Vita principis (saith Pliny
the younger) censura est, ea
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   perpetua;
ad hanc dirigimur, ad hanc convertimur:
Hee might have said, in stead of Censura,
Cynosura; in as much as the life of
the Prince is the load-star of the Common-wealth,
upon which all men fix
their eyes, and shape their course by it.
I will conclude this point with the

grave speech of the heathen Oratour,
not unworthy a Christian penne: Qu
                     •
                  
perniciosius de republica merentur vitosi
principes, quòd non solum vitia concipiant ipsi,

                     que

quòd corrumpunt, pl
                     •
                  sque exemplo quàm
peccato nocent: By so much the worse do
vitious Princes deserve of the State
they govern, in as much as they are not
onely corrupted themselves, but convay
the poison thereof into the bowels
of the State; dooing more harme by
their example, then their sinne. Vpon
which considerations, no doubt, our
Prophet promiseth to begin at the welhead,
&amp; to set in order the first wheel,
by the reformation of himselfe. I will
behave my self wisely in a perfect way.
            
            The first thing hee vowes touching
himselfe, is wise behaviour; prudence,
not sapience; not wise contemplation,
but wise action. It is not wise thoughts,
or wise speaking, or wise writing, or
wise gesture &amp; countenance, will serve
the turn; but wise behaviour: the former

are gracefull, but the other needfull.
For, as the Apostle saith of godlinesse,
Having a shew of godlinesse, but denying
the power therof: so certainly there
are in point of wisdome and sufficiency
that doo little or nothing throughly,
but magno cona
                     ••
                   nugas, they make much
adoo about small matters; using all the
perspectives of shifting they can devise
to make an empty superficies seem a body
that hath depth and bulk.
            It hath been an opinion, The French
are wiser then they seem, the Spaniards
seem wiser then they are: and pity it is
they should bee sundred; but, if they
must needs, better it were to make
choice of a wise behavior without seeming,
than of seeming wise without
behaviour suitable thereunto. The reason
is, because as the conceptions, so
also the affections of the soul are more
lively and effectually charactered and
unfoulded in deeds than in words; in
as much as words may more easily bee
dissembled than deeds: and true vertue
consists not in knowledge, but in practice;

at least as oft as occasion and opportunity
are offred, and means afforded.
The hearers of the law are not iustified,
but the dooers thereof, saith the Apostle,
Rom. 2; opposing doing to simple
hearing. And, Blessed are yee if yee knowe
these things, and doo them, saith our Saviour;
opposing dooing to bare knoweledge.
The end then both of hearing
and knowing, is dooing: it is the badge
of our Profession, the pledge of our Election,
the assurance of our effectuall
Vocation, the fruit of our Iustification,
a special part of our Sanctification, and
the high-way to our eternal Salvation:
Faith, without it, beeing but a vain speculation;
and Hope, but a vaine presumption;
and Charity, but a vaine ostentation.
Therefore, saith our Prophe
                  •
               ,
as some Latine Copies reade it,
Prudenter agam, I will doo wisely. It is
a received axiome in Schooles; Deus
est remunerator adverbiorum, non nominū:
God is a rewarder of Adverbs, not of
Nouns. Their meaning is, that hee regardeth
not so much a good action, as

the dooing of it well. For, a man may
do that which is good, either by chāce,
or by compulsion, or by starts: but, to
the well-doing of it, it is requisite, that
hee doo it both wittingly, and willingly,
and constantly. As then we have action
implied in the Verb: so have wee witting,
and willing, and constant action
implied in the Adverb. And as such action
is the life of religiō: so is wisdom,
of such action; being as it were the knot
in the string, the meddall in the chain,
the gem in the ring of Christian Vertues:
sitting as an Empress in the midst
of them, consulting, judging, commanding,
ordering things present, and providing
for the future, by comparing
them with the by-past, prescribing circumstances
of time, and place, and persons,
and manner, and measure, to every
severall vertue; by failing in the least
of which, they lose both their name &amp;
their nature: Humility, not seasoned
with Wisdome, beeing but basenesse;
and Patience, dulnesse; and Zeal, fury;
and Obedience, slavish subjection; and

Bounty, wastefull; and Courage, desperate:
but, above all, Mercy and Iustice
require Wisdom. And therefore
our Prophet having tould us, I will sing
Mercy and Iustice; hee presently addes,
I will doo wisely; Mercy and Iustice being
as the two scales of the balance, &amp;
Wisdome as the beam between them:
Mercy and Iustice like the two eyes,
and Wisdome like the Optike nerve in
which they both meet.
            A good Chirurgion, as they say,
should have three properties; a Ladies
Hand, a Lyons Heart, and an Eagles
Eye: which may well serve as a fit Embleme
of these three Vertues, like the
three Sister-Graces ever dancing hand
in hand. But, of the three, Wisdome is
the more excellent, in asmuch as it moderates
both the other two, and all other
vertues, in publike, in private, in
war, in peace, in adversity, in prosperity,
in health, in sicknes, in diet, in apparell,
in speech, in action. Which Salomon
knew right well, when he prayed
not for riches, or honor, or a long life;

but for Wisdome, In whose right hand is
length of daies, and, in her le
                     •
                  t, riches and
honour: the merchandise thereof is better
than the merchandise of silver, and the gain
thereof is better than gold. It is more pretious
than pearles: and all things that thou
canst desire are not to bee compared unto her:
shee is a tree of life to them that lay hould on
her; and blessed is hee that retaineth her.
            
            As Wisdome is a singular ornament
to all: so is it in a manner essentiall to
Kings, in as much as by it they raigne,
Pro. 8. There are few things presented
to their view in their proper shapes and
colours: which requires in them the
greater Wisdome to finde them out; it
beeing the Kings honour to search out
a thing
                  •
                as it is the glory of God to conceal
it, Pro. 23. 1. 2. 25. 3. The Wise-men
of the East, who brought our Saviour
Presents, are therefore (as I conceive)
specially thought to have been Kings,
because they were wise: and, Rexilliteratus,
said a King, what other is he, quam
bos coonatus. It was the speech of Lewis,
the eleventh of France, to his sonne,

               Charles the Eight, that hee should learn
no more Latin but this, Qui nescit dissimulare,
nescit regnare. But surely, had
himselfe learned more than hee did,
it may well bee thought, he would never
have taught him that Lesson; learning,
especially in morall philosophy
and history, joyned with judgement &amp;
experience, beeing the best mistress of
Wisdome, which ever hath beene and
will be justified of her owne children.
            To let go the Living, for fear of flattery;
I will onely instance in Augustus
and Charlemain, both well learned, and
both very wise and happy Emperours,
great rewarders of learning, and advancers
of their Teachers. It will be said,
that many Princes have attained to rare
Wisdom, without learning: yet can it
not be denied, but that learning wisely
used would have added both grace and
strength unto their Wisdome.
            Quale manus addunt ebori de
                  •
               us, aut ubi
                  •
               lavo
            Argentum pariusve lapis cum cingitur auro.
            
               For, as expert men can best execute,
so learned men are fittest to judge or
censure. And as the Sciences are contemned
by the crafty, and admired by
the simple, and by some abused to sloth
or affectation: so wise-men onely use
them aright, not onely for delight and
ornament, but for ability. As then that
State is happy which enjoyes both a
learned and a wise Prince: so is that
most unhappy, Cuius Rex est Puer, whose
King is neither learned nor wise. Yet
is it not all kinde of learning or wisedome
which is availeable for the true
happinesse of a King or Kingdome (as
may appeare in the miserable ends of
Herod, and Iulian the Apostate, both in
their kindes wise and learned) but wise
behavior in a perfect way, that is, Wisdom
mixed with Piety, guided by Religion,
and sanctified with Grace.
Whence our Prophet addes, I will behave
my self wisely in a perfect way: I will
so make use of the Wisdom of the Serpent,
that I forsake not the Innocency
of the Dove.
            
               The cursed Atheist thinks himselfe
a jolly Wise-man, and all others fooles
that make conscience of any religion:
but our Prophet is bold to put the fool
upon him; The fool hath said in his heart,
There is no God, Psal. 14. 1. The Philosophers
of the Gentiles thought themselves
the only wise-men of the world:
but, while they professed themselves wise,
they became fools, and their foolish heart was
full of darknes, Rom. 1. 21. The covetous
Worldling applauds his own wisdom,
and laughs at others for their simplicity:
but, before hee sleep, hee hears his
Doom; Thou fool▪ this night shall they take
thy soule from thee. The Galathians
thought themselves wiser than the other
Gentiles, for the observation of
the legall Ceremonies: but St. 
               Paul in
his Epistle to them, calls them fooles for
their labour. And likewise the Pharises
were held the wisest of all the Iewish
Nation: but our Saviour tels them
to their faces, they were but formal fools.
True Wisdome is then to bee found,
and only to be found in the perfect way.
            
            
               There is a Divellish wisdome, rather
craft then wisdome, maintained by dissimulation,
and lying, and perjury:
such as was that of Boniface the eight
Bishop of Rome, who entred like a Fox,
raigned like a Lion, and died like a Dog; of
Iezabell and Achttophel in practice, and
Machivell in precepts. This wisdome
runs a contrary biass to this perfect way:
it is directly opposite unto it, and fights
against it. Again, there is a Humane or
rationall wisdome, enlightned at the
torch of right reason, yet left amongst
the remainders of Gods image in man:
and this, though it be beside the perfect
way, yet may it bee reduced unto it;
good use (no doubt) may bee made of
it. And lastly, there is a Divine, holy,
and heavenly Wisdome, whose beginning
is the fear of God, whose crowne
is the favour of God, whose guide is
this perfect way, the word of GOD:
which is therfore called a way, because
it leads us to our journeyes end; and a
perfect way, because the Authour of it
is the abstract of all perfection; because

it sufficiently containes in it all things
requisite to bring us to perfection both
of body and soule, both of grace and
glory; and lastly, because it makes those
perfect that walk in it, at least in regard
of endeavour, and the severall parts of
perfection, though not the degrees: as,
a childe may bee said to bee a perfect
man, in that hee hath all the parts of a
man, though hee want the growth and
strength of a man. And if this way
were thus perfect in Davids time, what
is it by the addition of so many parcels
of Scripture since? If it then gave wisdome
to the simple, Psal. 19. 7; if it
made David, beeing brought up but as
a Shepheard, wiser than his enemies,
than his ancients, than his teachers,
Psal. 119; as an Angell of God in discerning
right from wrong, 2. Sa. 14. 17;
able to guide the people by the skilfulnesse
of his hands, Psal. 78. 72; what
kinde of wisdome is there, which wee
may not now gather from thence?
            What depth of naturall Philosophy
have we in Genesis and Iob? what flowrs

of Rhetorique in the Prophets? what
force of Logick in Saint Pauls Epistles?
what Art of Poëtrie in the Psalmes?
what excellēt morall Precepts, not only
for Private life, but for the regiment
of Families and Common-weales, in
the Proverbs and Ecclesiastes? to which
may be added in a second rank as very
usefull, though Apochryphall, the book
of Wisedome and Ecclesiasticus? what
reasonable and iust lawes haue wee in
Leviticus and Deuteronomy? which moved
the great Ptolomey to hire the Septuagints
to translate them into Greek:
what unmatchable antiquitie, variety,
and wonderfull events, and certaintie
of storie, in the books of Moses, Iosuah,
the Iudges, Samuel, the Kings and Chronicles,
together with Ruth and Ester,
Ezra and Nehemiah, and since Christ,
in the sacred Gospels and Acts of the
Apostles? and lastly, what profound
mysteryes have we in the Prophecies of
Ezekiel and Daniel, and the Revelation of
Saint Iohn? But in this it infinitely exceeds
the Wisedome of all humane

writings, that it is alone able to make a
man wise unto salvation, 2. Tim. 3. 15.
Vpon these considerations, Charles the
fift of France, surnamed the Wise, not
onely caused the Bible to be translated
into French, but was himselfe very studious
in the holy Scriptures. And Alphonsus,
King of Arragon, is said to have
read over the whole Bible fourteen severall
times with Lyraes notes upon it:
though he were otherwise excellently
well learned, yet was the law of God
his delight, more desired of him than
gold, yea then much fine gold, sweeter
also than hony and the hony-combe.
            
               I will end this point with the Commandement
of God himselfe to the
King, Deuteronomie 17: When he shall sit
upon the throne of his kingdom, hee shall
write him a copy of this Law in a booke, out
of that which is before the Priests, the Levites:
and it shall bee with him and hee shall
reade therein all the dayes of his life, that hee
may learne to feare the Lord his God, to keep
all the words of this Law, and these Statutes
to doe them, that his heart be not lifted up aboue

his brethren, and that he turne not aside
from the Commandement, to the right hand
or to the left, to the end that hee may prolong
his dayes in his kingdome, hee and his children
in the midst of Israell. And looke
what was there given in charge to the
King in generall, was afterward commanded
Iosuah (a worthy Leader) in
particular, Iosuah 1. 8. This booke of the
lawe shall not depart out of thy mouth, but
thou shalt meditate therein day and night,
that thou mayst obserue to do according to all
that is written therein: For then thou shalt
make thy way prosperous, and then shalt thou
Or doe wisely. have good success. It followeth, O when
wilt thou come unto me!
            The comming of God unto his
children, is, either by the performance
of his promises, or by the speciall assistance
of his Spirit, or by the receiving
of them unto himselfe. Such as
thinke this Psalme was penned before
Davids comming to the Crowne, understand
these words, of the performance
of Gods promise in setting it
upon his head and settling him in the

regall Throne, and then this to be the
meaning; O Lord I will tarry thy leasure,
and keep my selfe within the bounds of my
dutie, till thou hast accomplished that which
thou hast promised unto mee; though thou
delay the matter, and put me off, I will bee
content to walke in the perfect way, and not
once presume to step aside out of it, to compass
that which thou hast sayd thou wilt give me.
And according to this promise of his,
we may see how hee carried himselfe:
for, although there were a great space
betwixt his anoynting, whereby hee
was by Gods owne mouth proclaimed
heire apparant to the Crowne, after
the death of Saul, and his comming to
it; notwithstanding he had the hearts
of the Subiects, insomuch as the women
in their songs extolled him above
the King; though the soule of Ionathan
the Kings eldest sonne were fast linked
to him, and so hee might haue conceived
hope to have made a strong party
against Saul, who daily provoked him
by most cruell and unjust persecution:
yet David kept himselfe in his uprightness:

hee hasted not by any indirect attempt
(as did his sonne Absolon afterwards
against himselfe) to seeke his
owne revenge, nor to displace the
King and his seed, which hee knew in
time were to be remoued; but patiently
waited upon God, doing his will:
yea, when God two severall times had
put Saul into his hands (once in the
Cave where David and his men were
hidden; another time in Sauls owne
Tent, where with such courage hee
had adventured) hee was so farre off
from taking away his life (which easily
hee might have donne) that his heart
checked him for cutting off the lap of
the Kings garment, at the one time; &amp;
he sharply rebuked Abner for guarding
the Kings person so weakly, at the other.
Thus did this holy man wisely
carry himselfe in the perfect way of patience
and loyalty to his cruell Prince,
and persecuting father in law, till God
himselfe (by the way that he appointed)
had set him in the Kings seat.
            The contrary is reported of Don Carlo,
               
Infant of Spaine, if the relation bee
true; that hee through impatience and
ambition practiced against his Father,
and for that cause suffered in the yeare
of the Lord made up in the numerall
letters of this old verse,156
                     •
                  . 
               Filius ante diem
patrios inquirit in annos. Once we are sure
that our late neighbour King, the sooner
to get the quiet possession of that
Crowne, to which hee had unquestionable
right (if their Salique lawe be in
force) forsooke that religion in which
hee was brought up; and such as were
disposed to play with his name, found
in it while he stood out, Bonus Orbi,
               Borbonius. but
afterward, Orbus boni: but God dallied
not with him, suffering him to be dangerously
stricken in the mouth upon
the first abjuring of his religion; and afterwards
in or neer the heart, in the
midst of his Triumphes, Nobility, and
imperiall Citie, to the great astonishment
of the Christian world.
            Indeed, it was a speech borrowed
frow Euripides, and often repeated by
Caesar,
               
                  
                  Si violandum est ius,
                  Violandum est propter imperium:
               
            
            But, rather befitting the mouth of a
Heathen, then a Christian: yet are our
owne Chronicles but too plentifull in
Examples in this kinde, of such as being
heirs apparant to the Crowne, rather
snatcht it before their due time,
then received it when it fell.
            Among others, we read that Richard,
eldest sonne then living to King Henry
the second, approaching the corps of
his Father as it was carrying to bee interred
(adorned according to the manner
of Kings, with all royall ornaments
open faced) the blood gushed out at
the nostrils of the dead, a signe usually
noted of guiltiness; as if nature yet after
death retained some intelligence in
the veines, to give notice of wrong, and
check the malice of an unnaturall offender:
at which sight Richard, surprised
with horror, is saide to have burst
ou
                  •
                into extreame lamentations. Neither
was Edward the fourth free from
this imputation: who when his father

and himselfe had voluntarily and solemnly
sworne, to suffer Henry the sixt
quietly to enioy the Crowne during
his life; yet did hee (as thinking the
time long till hee had it on his owne
head) set his brother of Glocester to dispatch
King Henry, teaching him by the
same Art to kill his owne sonnes and
successors, Edward and Richard. For
those Kings that sell the blood of others
at a lowe prize, doe but make the
market for their enemies to buy theirs
at the same rate.
            On the other side, it is recorded in
the French History, to the eternal commendation
of Robert eldest sonne to
Hugh Capet the first King of their last
race, that being by his fathers consent
and desire crowned King, and proclaimed
his Lieutenāt General in the kingdome,
hee notwithstanding still continued
a sonne without waywardness, a companion
without iealousie, &amp; a King without
ambition.
            
            And wee may speake it without flattery,
that his Maiesty now living and

long to live, hath left to posterity a
worthy paterne in this kinde, by receiving
this crown of England even from
the hand of God: having patiently waited
the due time of putting it on, howsoever
hee were provoked to hasten it,
refusing the assistance of her enemies,
that wore it as long with as great glory
as ever Princesse did; not entring by a
breach or by blood, but by the ordinary
gate which his owne right, and divine
providence, set open. Neither
would hee, for the settling of his right,
admit the toleration of any other religion,
then that which hee heer found,
and himselfe professed; protesting openly,
that hee would chuse rather, if
hee were forced to it, to spend the last
drop of his blood, than to enter upon
such conditions. But, God would not
suffer one drop of that sacred blood to
be spilt, which was so ready to be poured
out for his sake.
            Now those, who thinke this Psalme
was penned by David after his coming
to the Crown, conceive that at his entrance

thereunto hee▪ thus prayed for
the speciall assistance of Gods Spirit,
aswell in the private carriage of his
owne Affairs and Person, as in governing
the people committed to his
charge; well knowing, that without it
hee could not observe this Vow to
which hee had bound himself, nor administer
Mercy and Iustice, nor behave
himselfe wisely in a perfect way, nor performe
any duty belonging to the office
of a King, or a good man, as he ought.
Hee therefore desires of God, that as
hee had set him in the Kings Throne,
so hee would indue him with all maner
of graces and royall vertues fit for so
high a place; and not onely so, but to
assist and direct him in the exercise of
those graces and vertues.
            
               The Heart of the King is in the hand of
God, hee turneth it as the rivers of waters,
Pro. 21. 1: hee turneth it to his good, if
hee flee to him for assistance; but, to
his confusion, if he stand upon his own
strength. It behooves all men to implore
the aid of G O D, but specially

Kings and Princes; as in all their actions,
so principally in negotiations and
treaties of greatest Consequence. That
of King Salomon then chiefly concerns
them; Trust in the Lord with all thine hart,
and leane not to thine owne wisdom; in all thy
waies acknowledge him, and hee shall direct
thy waies Pro. 3. 5. 6. Princes have fewer
then private men, that dare freely tel
them the truth (which is indeed one of
the great mischiefes of great places)
whereas, on the other side, their temptations
are many and strong, and their
actions of weight &amp; importance, drawing
after them either much good or
much evill. It behooveth them then,
above all, not to presume too much upon
themselves, upon their owne policy
and forecast; but rather upon the providence
and assistance of him whose
substitutes they are. Th

dare doo nothing of moment, without

they enterprise any thing of importance,
without consulting with the Oracle
of God, by religious invocation

of him, for the illuminating of their
understādings, &amp; guiding of their wils;
following therein the example of the
Wise man, who treating of the excellēcy
of true wisdom, &amp; acknowledging
it to be the special gift of God, crav'd it
at his hands, &amp; withal notably set forth
the weaknes of mans wit &amp; judgement,
with the reason therof, in these words:
Give mee that wisedome, which sitteth by
thy throne, and put mee not out from among
thy children: for, I thy servant and sonne
of thine handmaid am a feeble person and
of a short time, and yet less in the understanding
of iudgement and the lawes: and
though a man bee never so perfect among
the children of men, yet if thy wisedome bee
not with him he shall bee nothing regarded:

with the uncertainty of humane

affaires and events; it were good for
all religious Princes to take that as their

                  t
nullus: but, in the end he proved both;
Et Caesar, &amp; nullus. And Timotheus the
Athenian after hee had, in the account
given to the State, of his gouernment,
often interlaced this speech [and in this
fortune had no part] was observed never
to have prospered in any thing hee
undertooke afterwardes. Now, looke
what Fortune was to them, the same is
Gods Providence unto us: whereas
on the other side, the most prosperous
in their enterprises, have ever most willingly
ascribed their victories, their deliverances,
their success-full Counsels,
and happy issues, rather to the goodness

of divine Providence, than their
owne valour or wit.
            And surely, hee that shall consider
how a day, an houre, a moment is enough
to overturne the deepest plots
of the gravest Senates, that seemed (as
one speakes) to have been founded and
rooted in Adamant, cannot but withall
acknowledge it as exceeding folly and
ingratitude in any man, so to dote upon
and admire the sufficiencie of his owne
gifts, as to forget the Giver; so much
to rely upon the arme of flesh, that hee
neglect the direction of Gods holy
Spirit: which is, as if a man should set
to Sea without a Pilot, or undertake a
journey through a dangerous Forrest
in a dark night, without a guide. I will
then conclude this point with that
prayer of the People for their Prince,
and the Prince for himselfe; Give thy
iudgements to the King O Lord: and thy
righteousnesse to the Kings sonne, Psalme
72. 1.
            A third sort understand these words
of our Prophet, When wilt thou come unto

mee] of Gods comming to David to
receive him to himselfe: thereby implying
that hee would so behave himselfe,
as he would alwayes have an eye
to the maine chance; not onely to the
end of his actions, but of his life: which
indeed is an excellent meanes both to
walke wis
                  •
               ly, as he promis
                  •
               th before;
and uprightly, as hee voweth immediatly
after: When Princes look not so
much upon their plumes and traines,
their present power and magnificence;
as upon their future condition, when
their bodies shall become the like prey
to worms and rottennesse, and their
soules shall vndergoe the like strict examination,
as the bodies and soules of
their meanest Subjects: When this
great game at Chesse is heere ended,
they must with others be laid up together
in the common bagge of Nature;
and then shall th
                  •
               re bee no difference
betweene their dust, and that of the
poorest Begger.
            The rememberance hereof is like a
bitter pill, to purge out the malignity

of many wanton and vaine 
                  •
               umors; or
like a strainer, all our thoughts &amp; speeches
and actions, which pass through
it, are thereby cleansed and purified.
As the bird guideth her body with her
traine, and the ship is steered with the
rudder: so the course of mans life is
best directed with a continual recourse
unto his end. It is hard for a man to
think of a short life, and to thinke evill;
or to thinke of a long life, and to thinke
well. Therefore when Salomon had
spoken of all the vanities of men, at last
hee opposed this Memorandum, as a
counterpoi
                  •
               e against them all, Remember
for all these things thou shalt come to
iudgement, Eccles. 11. As if hee should
say, men would never speake as they
speake, nor doe as they doe, if they did
but thinke that these speeches and
deeds should shortly come to judgement.
            But an hard thing it is for them, who
fare delicio
                  •
               sly every day, who glister
like Angels, whom all the world admires,
and sues and bowes to, which

are called Sacred, Gracious, and mightie
Lords, to remember the approach
of Death. They have no leasure to
thinke of it, but chop into the earth before
they bee aware; like a man that
walketh over a field cover'd with snow,
and sees not his way, but while hee
thinks to run on, suddenly falls into a
pit: so they which have all things at
their will, and swim in pleasure, which
as a snow covereth their way, &amp; dazeleth
their sight, while they thinke to
live on and rejoyce still, suddenly rush
upon death, and make shipwrack in the
calme Sea. As it is good therfore for
them to heare they are gods: so it is
meet they remember they are mortall
gods, They shall die like men, Psal. 82.
For when they forget they shal die like
men, they also forget to live and raigne
like gods.
            Had they with Ioseph of Arimathea,
their tombes hewed out in their gardens,
where they use of solace themselves,
it would make them so to number
their dayes, that they would apply

their hearts unto Wisedome. O that
men were wise (saith Moses) then would
they consider their latter end, Deutr. 32. 29.
So that Wisdome brings a man to consider
his end, and the consideration of
his end makes him more wise; As, on
the other side, it is noted as a point of
folly in Gods people, that they minded
not, nor remembred their end, Lament. 1. 9.
Now, as the remembrance of death
made the Prophet walke more wisely:
so did the remembrance of judgement
after death, make him walke more uprightly;
as well knowing hee was to
render an account to a higher Iudge,
who could neither bee terrified with
stout lookes, nor ledde with respect of
persons, nor perswaded with eloquēce,
nor blinded with gifts; But, as hee was
in greater place then others, so should
his reward be greater, and his Crowne
more glorious, if he did well: but his
punishment greater, and his torment
more grievous, if hee did ill. Therefore,
hee presently addes, after, this ejaculation
cast in betweene, I will walke

within mine house with a perfect heart.
            
         
         
            
               I will walke within my house with a perfect
heart. Walking is a word often used
in holy Scripture, and specially by
our Prophet in this book of the Psalms;
yet more often figuratively than properly.
It shall not be amiss then, out of
the property and nature of it, to consider
the duties included and implied in
it. The natural acts of it then are three;
motion, progress, and moderation. As it includes
motiō, so is it oppos'd to lying, or
stāding, or sitting: as it includes progress
in motion, so is it opposed to jumping, or
capring up &amp; down in the same place:
as it includes moderation in a progressive
motiō, so is it opposed to violē
               
                  •
                running.
            
               Motion is the common effect of all
naturall bodies: they all either move in
their place, or to their place. The heavens,
&amp; ayr, and birds move above us;
the sea, 
                  •
               ivers, fishes, and worms, move
under us; the beasts beside us; and our
own harts day &amp; night within us; And
shall we alone stands still in the midst of
so many movers round about us? Everie

one of these Creatures seem to cry
unto us, Qui fecit me propter te, fecit te
propter se, He that made me to move for
thee, made thee to moove for himselfe.
            Why then stand yee heer all the day
idle, saith our Saviour to those loy
                  •
               er
                  •
               rs
in the Gospell: and I wish I might
not justly say the like to many here present;
Idleness beeing commonly the
best mark of a Gentleman and a Courtier:
whereas imployment and action
was injoyned man, even in the state of
innocēcy, Gen. 2. 15. but, then for recreation;
afterward Gen. 3. 19. for necessity.
To which the Apostle seemes to allude,
He that will not worke and exercise
himselfe in some lawfull kinde of
imployment, is to be held Telluris inutile
pondus, not so much as worthy to
eate, 2. Thes. 3. 10. Diogenes, that hee
might not seem idle in the midst of business,
would needs bee doing, though
it were but by rowling of his Tub: and
these men to shun the imputation of
sloathfull persons become busie bodies,

and so walke indeede, but inordinately,
v. 11. Like those walkers in the
third to the Philippians, who
                     •
                  e end is damnation,
or like that Arch-ranger, vvho
vvalkes about seeking whom hee may devour,
they wholly spend their time either
mal
                     •
                   agendo, or aliud agendo, or nihil
agendo, in dooing naught, or impertinences,
or nothing, which will quickly
bring them to the other two; The
minde of man being of such an active
disposition, that if it be not set aworke
in goodness, it will quickly set it selfe
aworke in mischiefe: if it be not manured
with good seeds, it will soon be
fertill in weeds.
            Pittie it is, that three such good mothers,
as Truth, Familiarity, and Peace,
should by the viciousness of our nature
bring forth three such bad daughters,
as Ha
                     •
                  red, Contempt, and Idlenesse; the
daughter indeed of Peace, but the mother
of Discord and Warre: of the war
of the sensuall appetite against reason,
as appeared in the filthy Sodomites, Ezekiel
16. 49. Of the Subject against the

Soveraigne, as hath often appeared in
the rebellious Irish. It were good then
for a Prince to keep his Subjects in motion,
either by imployment of trades,
or discoveries, or some such action:
which, as it tends to the ornament and
wealth of his Kingdome, so doth it to
the safety of his person; and the rather,
if himselfe bee of a stirring humour:
whereas, on the other side, his standing
still is like the standing of the Sunne in
the firmament; which, as it cannot but
breed admiration, so neither can it well
bee without dangerous effects: it beeing
knowne, that the two first Races of
the French Kings were extinct by putting
off their Affairs of the State upon
the Majors of the Palace, that so they
might betake themselves to a retired
kinde of life. Industry hath ever raised
and enlarged Empires, but idlenesse ruined
them. As then Princely State doth
not become the Monkes Cool: so neither
doth Monkish retirednes, the Princes
Crown. As the Lord hath called every
one, so let him walk, 1. Cor. 7. 17.
            
               Secondly, as walking implyes motion,
so doth it progress in motion; when by
his motion a man gets ground &amp; goes
forward. It is truly sayd even in Civill
affaires, that the mind of man is more
cheered and refreshed by profiting in
small things, then by standing at a stay
in great: but▪ in the course of piety and
religion, Not to get ground, is to lose
ground. Wherefore,
               H
                     •
                  b. 6. 1 
               leaving the principles of
the doctrine of Christ, let vs go on to perfection.
And forgetting the things behind, and
reaching-forth to those which are before,
               Phil. 3. 13. 
               let
us press toward the mark. Turpis &amp; ridicula
res est elementarius senex, Tis a shamefull
thing to see an old man in his Ab
                     •
                  e; but,
dāgerous for a Christian not to go forwrad
in the gaining of knowledge and
practice of sanctification. His first beginning
is as the dawning of the day,
his proceeding as a faire sun-shine morning,
his ending as the Sunne at high
noone in the middest of a Summers
day; according to that of Salomon,
               Pro. 4. 18. 
               The
path of the Iust is as the shining light, that shineth
more and more untill it be perfect day.
            
            
               Now the steps by which we mount
this Meridian, are eight; answerable to
the eight steps going up to the Temple.Ezek. 40. 31
               Adde to your faith vertue, and to vertue
knowledge, and to knowledge temperāce,
and to temperance patience, and to patience
godliness, and to godlines brotherly kindnes,
and to brotherly kindnes charity, 2. Pet. 2. 5.
The lowest step in this Christian Progress
is Faith: and the highest, Charity;
faith being the ground-work, and charity
the
                  •
                roofe of our spirituall building.
In the world, the ambitious man
never leaves his aspiring to honor, nor
the covetous man his scraping up of riches,
nor the voluptuous man his hunting
after pleasure, nor the curious man
his prying into the secrets of God and
the bowels of nature▪ they all either do
or desire to goe forward, though it be
to the Confines of hell; And shall we
then bee less active in our progresse to
heaven? Ad quod multi potuerunt peruenire,
nisi se putassent peruenisse, unto
which many vndoubtedly might have
arrived, had they not sate downe in the

mid-way, and thought their condition
for Travellers good enough: whereas
the exhortation, 2. Pet. 3. 18, Growe in
grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and
Saviour Iesus Christ, still hath and will
have its place and vse so long as we soiourne
here belowe in this valley of
teares, vntill our faith be turned into
vision, and our hope into fruition; untill
we come to the measure of the stature of
the fulness of Christ, Eph. 4. 13; who being
a child encreased as in age and stature,
               Luke 2. 52 
               so in
wisedome and fauour with God and men:
which as all are to labour for, so specially
they that sit in his throne &amp; beare
his name, in that they are his anointed.
            Thirdly, as walking implyes motion
and progresse, so doth it moderation, as it
is opposed to violent running; which
is more subject both to falling and tiring,
then moderate walking. Moderation
is the salt that maketh all our actions
relish to our selves, beneficiall to
others, and acceptable to God: without
which, businesse is rather burthensome
then profitable, and exercise rather

a toyle than recreation. As a man
may eate too much honey, so pleasure
it selfe growes loathsome and distastefull
by immoderate vse. Nempe voluptatem
commendat r
                     •
                  ri
                     •
                  r vsus. Besides: moderation
is the mother of duration; it is
like the steddy burning of a taper, or
the fire upon the Altar which never
went our: whereas head-strong violence
like a squib or flash of lightning
dazles the eyes for a moment, but is instantly
extinct.
            The great Maister of morality held
it a great indecency in a Magistrate, to
be seene running in the market place:
because he, who is to moderate others,
should himselfe observe a stayed moderation
and gravity, even in his pase
and gesture, and countenance; much
more in his actions. The Lyon, they
say, is seldome or never seene to runne;
yet is he for courage and wisedome the
King of beasts: and the higher the Celestiall
Spheres are in situation, the
slower they are in their proper motion.
It is commonly the fault of youth, by

reason of their strong passion and little
experience, to make more haste than
good speed: and therfore it was good
counsell of a Father to his Sonne, Parce
puer stimulis, &amp; fortius u
                     •
                  ere loris: to bee
sparing of the spur, and to make use of
the bridle. Generally it is better to hal
                  •
               
in the right way, than to ride a-gallop
out of it. And howbeit in the way of
godliness a man cannot make too much
haste, nor come too soone to heaven;
yet it were fit to remember that of our
Prophet, I will runne the way of thy commandements,
when thou shalt have enlarged
my heart, Psal. 119. 32; there beeing not
a few, who will undertake to runne and
flee too, before they are well able to
go or stand.
            Lastly, the ordinary effects of bodily
walking, are, the quickning of the appetite,
the refreshing of the spirits, the
warming of the blood, and the exercising
of the body: In like manner, by
this spirituall walking in the paths of
Gods commandements, is the appetite
of our soul quickned to spiritual things,

the spirit comforted and refreshed, our
zeal warmed, and our benummed affections
made more nimble and pliant.
            Now followes the Rule of his walking;
which is, the integrity of his hart.
So Tremelius renders it, Ambulabo in
integritate animi mei: our last Translation
reads it, with a perfect heart. That
same which hee heere promiseth for
himself, he elsewhere enjoins his Son;
And thou, Salomon my Son▪ knowe thou
the God of thy Fathers, and serve him with
a perfect heart, and a willing minde, 1. Chr.
28. 9. First then hee voweth, that the
Rule of his actions should bee the Dictate
of his owne heart; not the fancy of
other mens brains, nor the example of
other mens lives, nor the report of other
mens tongues: which is as uncertain
and variable as are the passions of
their mindes; some, speaking out of
fear; some, of 
                  •
               lattery; som, of malice;
and some, of faction. The best way
then for a man to examine his actions,
is, To examine his heart; there beeing
no man living that knowes or possibly

can knowe thee so well as thou doost
thine owne self. For, what man knoweth
the things of man, save the spirit of man that
is within him? 1. Cor. 2. 11. Though all
the world acquitte thee, if thine owne
heart condemne thee in that thou dost,
thou art guilty before God: &amp; though
the whole world condemn thee, if thy
owne heart acquit thee, thou art either
guiltless, or therby less guilty. For, as
whats
                     •
                  ever is not of faith, is sin, Rom. 14. 23
(that is, whatsoever is don against conscience,
though good in it selfe, yet to
mee is made sin): so, on the other side,
if our heart condemn us not, then have wee
confidence towards God, 1. Ioh
                     •
                  
                3. 21. In a
doubtfull cause, then, howbeeit perchance
the applause of all men, the reasons
of Statists, together with the opinion
of great Clerks, should give thee
allowance; yet, if thou canst not resolve
thy self of the lawfulnesse thereof,
attempt it not. For, as it is good for
a man to begin with his owne heart, for
consultation: so is it also, to conclude
with it, for resolution; yet so, as other

good meanes ordained to informe the
conscience (as, advice with discreet
friends, and conference with the Learned,
if the matter bee of moment, and
the cause difficult) bee not neglected.
Let thine heart then be the Line of thy
walking; and the perfection of thine
heart, the Levell of that Line. I will walk
with a perfect heart.
            
            
               Perfection implies two things, In
                     •
                  egrity
and Sincer
                     •
                  ty: Integrity, that it bee
whole and sound; Sincerity, that it bee
single and upright. Sincerity is opposed
to that double heart mentioned by
our Prophet, Psal. 12. 2, With flattering
lips and with a double heart doo they speak:
(the Original is, with a hart and a hart)
Integrity, to that divided heart, whereof
the Prophet Hosea, Their heart is divided,
cap. 10. 2; when a part is bestowed
on God, and a part on our owne profit
or pleasure. First then hee promiseth
to walk with a perfect heart, that is, in
the singlenesse and simplicity, the uprightnes
and sincerity of his heart, as
God commanded Abraham, Gen. 17. 1▪
                  
Walk before mee, and bee thou perfect; or,
as the Margent reads it, upright and sincere;
a word borrowed from hony, as
the Grammarians will have it: which,
the purer it is, sine cerâ, without wax,
the more pleasant and wholesome it is;
as they likewise draw simplicity, which
signifies the same, from a garment, sine
plicis, without pleats or foulds. Now,
this sincerity or simplicity is therfore called
perfection, because it is the greatest
perfection wee can possibly arrive unto
in this world. For, absolute perfection,
in fulfilling every point of the Law
in that exact manner and degree as is
required, neither doth our Prophet undertake,
neither could he by any means
perform.
            He wel knew, all that God expected,
and himselfe could safely promise, was
but sincerity: without which, many
good services are not accepted; and
with which, many great imperfections
and infirmities are covered, as with a
mantle. How many infirmities escaped
from our Prophet himselfe! his numbring

the people, his counterfeiting
madness, his collusion with Achish, his
rash anger, and furious swearing, and
vowing the death of Nabal, and his unjust
dealing with good poore Mephibosheth:
these things were sinnes; yet sincerity
was a vaile unto them, because it
was not so shaken in these, as in his
murther and adultery. God that tooke
some speciall notice of this last, would
take none at all of the other: The heart
of David (saith the Scripture) vvas upright
in all things, save in the matter of Vriah,
1. King. 15. 5. In like manner, some
of Asaes infirmities having been mentioned
by the holy Ghost, as that the
high places were not taken away; yet
the Conclusion is, Nevertheless his heart
vvas perfect with the Lord all his dayes.
Loe, how all his infirmities are covered
with the mantle of sincerity, 1. King.
15. 14. Contrariwise, in Iehu, wee may
observe, how the holy Ghost, after a
large description of many excellent
things done by him, doth at last drawe
as it were a cross-line, and dash out all

spoken before, with this Conclusion,
But I
                     •
                  hu regarded not to walke in the law of
the Lord vvith all his heart. Loe, how all
his other graces are buried in the grave
of an unsound heart, 2. King. 10. 31.
            Great vertues, not sweetned with
sincerity, are no ornament unto us: &amp;
great infirmities not sowred with hypocrisie
are no great deformities:
those God acknowledges not, these he
imputes not. The reason is, because
where sincerity is, there in the meanest
workes that are, together with them
the heart is given to God▪ &amp; the more a
man gives of his hart to God, the more
acceptable is his worke. The widowes
mite could weigh but little, but her
heart weighed heavy: and so her heart
being put to her mite, gave it weight above
the greater (but farre more heartless)
largess of the Pharisee. Sincerity is
to our works, as spirit is to our bodies;
which maketh it far better then where
there is more 
                  •
               lesh, but less spirit. O
rare and excellent vertue of sincerity!
which can make light drams and barley
corns as massie and ponderous, as

the huge talents: whereas contrarily,
the want of sincerity maketh talents as
light as feathers. Hypocrisie (such is
the filth of it) imbaseth the purest metalls,
and turneth very gold, yea pretious
stones, into rust
                  •
               y iron: whereas
sincerity by a divine kinde of Alchymie
turneth iron into gold.
            As in the naturall body, to use Saint
Augustines comparison, the case of the
sound finger is safer than of the blindish
eye: the finger indeed is but a little
small thing, and cannot do such service
as the eye, it is not of that admirable
nimbleness and quicknes, nor can
it guide and direct the whole bodie as
the eye doth; and yet is it better to be a
finger &amp; sound, than to be an eye and
dim or dark, ready to fal out of the socket.
And Chrysostom sayes well, that
she is a worse woman that in hypocrisie
blurs her face with tears, that shee
might be judged an hūble Penitētiary,
than she that beautifies it with painted
colours, that shee might be reputed a
faire and lovely creature.
            
               Finally, sincerity as it is of all vertues
the girdle, Ephe. 6. 14. &amp; of all other the
most acceptable to God: so is it to us
the most profitable in all dangers, tryals
&amp; temptations; begetting in us that Lion-like
boldness spoken of in Pro. 28.
1. It is not put out of countenance with
false accusatiōs of sland
                  •
               rous tongues:
it throweth them off as Paul did the
Viper, unhurt; yea, in a holy scorne it
laugheth at them. No, no: the brest-plate
of righteousnes, the brazen wall
of a good conscience feareth no such
arrowes. It saith with Paul, 1. Cor. 4. 3.
I pass not for mans iudgement: And with
Iob, 31. 35. Though mine adversary should
write a booke against me, I would take it upon
my shoulder and binde it as a crowne unto
me. That which made him thus confident,
was the sincerity of his heart.
My righteousness I holde fast, and will not
let i
                     •
                   goe: my heart shall not reproach mee so
long as I live, Iob 27. 5. And as it bred
confidence in Iob, in his tryals, so did it
minister comfort to Hezekiah, beeing
now stricken with the thunderbolt of

the sentence of death. O Lord, thou knowest
(saith he) I have walked vvith an upright
heart, Esa. 38. 3. Though those
good works hee had done, were in regard
of his calling, of the highest note,
the restoring of the true worshippe of
God, the purging of the defiled Temple
and Priest-hood: yet hee doth not
comfort himselfe with these so worthy
works; O Lord, thou knowest I have
cleansed thy Sanctuary, erected thy
worship, repaired the decayed wals of
Ierusalem, renewed the glory &amp; beauty
of thy Sion. No: but, without instancing
in any particulars he had done, he
mentions onely the sincerity of his affection
in doing them; I have walked
with a perfect or upright hart: which is
the same our Prophet here promiseth,
I will walk with a perfect heart.
            
            
               Perfect, as in regard of sincerity, opposed
to a doubl
                  •
                heart; so likewise in
regard of integritie, opposed to a cloven
or divided heart. The former implies
an unfained; the later an universall
obedience: for the shunning as of

hypocrisie in respect of others, so of
partiality towards himselfe. Blessed are
they that seeke him with their wh
                     •
                  le
heart, Psal. 119. 2. And therefore are
they blessed, because it is commanded,
Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
all thy heart, Deut. 6. 5. Those false harlots,
the World, &amp; the Divell, and the
Flesh are content to share with God in
thy heart: but God, like the true mother,
will have all or none. The gods of
the Heathen were goods fellows, they
could well enough endure inter-com-communing
and partnership: but the
true God is the jealous God, who cannot
away with halfes or parts. As himselfe
and the light (which of all visible
things comes nearest his nature) are indivisible:
so is he most delighted with
the Holocaust of an intire and undivided
heart. And as in nature, Solutio continui,
the division of any member, is the
mayme and griefe of the bodie, but the
division of the hart is the present death
of it: so the division of the affections
of the heart betweene the love of God

and the love of our selves, is undoubtedly
the death of the soule.
            With what face can we come before
God, when with Ananias and Saphira
we keep back pa
                  •
               t from him? when
with Zachary and Elizabeth wee walke
not in all the commandements of the
Lord? Doubtless, the old and sure way,
not to be asham'd when we present our
selves befo
                  •
               e him,Psa. 119. 
                     •
                  
                is, to have respect to all
his cōmandments. Though we cānot keep
all nor any one indeed as wee ought,
yet we may and must have regard unto
all, and that equally without respect or
difference of any. For, he that failes in
one point, is guilty of all, Iames 2. 10.
His meaning is (sayes the most learned
Interpreter) Deum nolle cum exceptione
coli, that God will not bee served with
exceptions and reservations. As his
lawe is one intire rule, though consisting
of many peeces: so ought our actions
and affections intirely to be squared
thereunto. If wee will goe out of
Egypt, we must not leave so much as an
hoofe behinde us. If we leave but one

gate of our soule o
                  ••
               n, our spirituall enemies
(who ly in ambush for all advantages)
may as well, by that, rush in
upon us to our perdition, as if no gate
were shut, no breach made up. If the
Bird bee taken but by the claw, the
Fowler is as sure of him, as if hee had
his whole body in his hand. And the
Ship is oftner sunk by some little insensible
leak, than by the violent dashingin
of the waves unto it. Look, then, as
to the sincerity, so to the integrity of
thy heart in Gods service.
            Hee forbiddes us not to love other
things besides himselfe; but wee may
love nothing but for his sake: and so
dooing, wee can love nothing in that
degree wee love him. Above all, let us
beware of the sinnes of our particular
vocation, and of our naturall constitution,
and of the times and places in wch
wee live: for, These, most men make
their Idols, and are ready to say with
Naaman, The Lord be mercifull to me
in this. But, this is not to walk with a
perfect heart: which strives against all

knowne sinne, because it is sin; and endeavours
the keeping of all the commandements,
because they are commanded:
and if wee so doo, for sinnes
of pure ignorance and meer infirmity,
God doth graciously vouchsafe us a
daily pardon of Course. Who can understand
his errours? Keep thy servant from
presumptuous sinnes; then shall I be upright,
Psal. 19. 12.
            To conclude: how-ever the damnable
Politicians of our Age would perswade
their Prince, that the practice of
outward Piety and civill Hon
                  •
               sty is
sufficient for him; yet our Prophet and
Prince promiseth to walke with a pe
                  •
               
               fect
heart, and performed what he promised,
so as hee dareth for that to appeal
to Gods examination and censure:
Iudge mee, O Lord: for, I have walked in
mine integrity, Psal. 26. 1. And againe:
Search mee, O God, and knowe my heart, try
mee, and knowe my thoughts, and see if there
bee any wicked way in mee, and lead mee in
the way everlasting, Psal. 139. 
                  •
               3. And,
lest wee should think This, presumption

in him, the holy Ghost doth him
this honour, that those Kings who truly
feared God, and raigned well, are
said to have walked in the waies of David
their Father, 2. Kings 22. 2; but, those that
raigned ill, because they feared not
God, not to have walked in his waies,
1. Kings 15. 3. So that hee is not onely
commended for his sound and single
heart, but is therein proposed as a rule
to succeeding Ages, for the tryall either
of the straightnes or crookednesse
of his Successors.
            Now, in the last place followes the
Place of his Walk: which is, within his
house; or, as Arias Montanus hath it,
in interiori domus meae, in the inmost part
of my house. Hee would make a tryall
in the very managing of his Family and
houshould-affaires, of his ability and
sufficiency for the government of the
Kingdom; as the Queen of the South
made a ghess of Salomons Wisdome by
the government of his house, 1. Kin. 10.
Every house-houlder is parvus Rex, a
little King in his owne Family: and

the greatest Monarch, upon the matter,
is but magnus Pater-familias, a great
house-houlder, or a common Father of
the publique Family of the State. As
then a man may see the coasting of the
whole world represented in a little map
as well as a gr
                  •
               at; the degrees of the
Sunnes motion, as well in a little Diall,
as a great; the figure and colour of a
visage, as well in a little picture or looking-glass,
as a great; and the convayance
of a building, as well in a little
frame or modell, as a great: so may a
mans desert and sufficiency, for the governing
of a Kingdome, bee seen and
made knowne in the wel-ordering and
disposing of his private house.
            And, as it is a tryall, so is it also a preparation
to greater matters; it beeing
not safe committing a vessell of burden
to his charge, who never guided a bark
or pinnace; nor to make him Generall
of an Army, who never had experience
of an under-Captains place: But, hee
that first shewes himselfe faithfull in a
little, is both thereby counted the worthier,

&amp; is indeed the fitter to be made
Ruler over much, Luke 19. 17. whereas,
on the other side, If a man knowe not
how to rule his owne house, how shall he take
care of the Church of God? saith the Apostle,
1. Tim. 3. 5. Hee speaks indeed of a
Bishop; but so, as his words are appliable
to the civill Magistrate, who is
charged with the government both of
Church and temporall State. Quid authoritatis
poterit habere in populo, quem propria
domus reddit contemptibilem? How
shall the people reverence him, whom
his owne family respects not, and his
owne behaviour therein makes him respectless?
            Again: In that he promiseth to walk
uprightly within his house, i
                     ••
                  ra privatos
parietes, as Iunius doth paraphrase it,
within his private walls; his meaning
is, that hee would bee no changeling:
that amongst his houshould-people
(where few beheld him) he would be
the same that hee was abroad, where
many eyes saw him: hee would bee as
godly in his Chamber, as in the Temple;

in his Closet, or Grove, or Gallery,
as in the great Congregation: it
beeing indeed the truest signe of an ingenuous
spirit, to practise the same alone
which he professeth in company;
and of a false hart, to be devout abroad,
and profane at home; an Angell in the
Church, and a Divell in the house:
such as they, who in open place, where
they may have praise of men, will doo
som good; but after they are more private,
they discover themselves in their
kinde, and runne freely to their owne
race, as the horse rusheth into the battell,
ler. 8. 6.
            I knowe, there is a time even for private
men, much more for Princes▪
whose bu
                  •
                then is greater, to unbinde
the boaw of their serious thoughts; and
to give the minde some relaxation and
refreshment from publike imploimēts,
that so they may bee the fitter to return
to them again: but, no time or place is
there in which they may loose the reins
to their unbridled appetite, or securely
sinne because they are private. No,

Hee that is present with them sitting in
their Thrones, is likewise present with
them lying in their Beds: as he is with
them in their Chappels, so is he in their
most secret Cabinets and withdrawing
roomes. Like a well-drawne picture
that eyeth each in the room, hee eyeth
in that manner each one in the world;
and all the waies of each one, as if his
eye were upon him alone. Hee seeth all
things, himself unseen of any; beeing
so without all things, as that hee is not
excluded from any; and so within all
things, as that hee is not included in any.
It is hee, of whom our Prophet
speaks in another Psalm▪ 
               Thou knowest
my down-sitting and my 
                     •

my path and my lying downe, and art
acquainted with all my waies: unto whom
the day and the darknes, the light and the
night are both alike, 139. In whose sight
the very intentions of the heart are naked
and open, Heb. 4. 13. The Greek word
signifieth so opened, as the entralls of a
man that is anatomized, or of a beast

that is cut up and quartered. Quare, sit

thou wilt sin securely, seek ou

                a place

                  •
               very corner, then hast thou reason rather
to stand in awe of the presence of
the immortall God, than of a mortall
man. So, doo whatsoever thou doost,
saith the heathen Philosopher, 
                  〈…〉
               ,
as if severe Cato stood by &amp;
lookt on: but, if in stead of Ca
                     •
                  o, he had
put Deus (as if God stood by and lookt
on) his advice might well have passed

was the Counsell of Another, save tha
                  •
               
hee named gods for God;

                  Quaecunque capesses,
                  Testes factorum stare arbitrabere divos.
               
            
            What availeth it to have no creature
privy to our evill acts, when wee have
him privy to them, who must one day
judge them?
            The forgetfulness heerof makes many
men, and especially great ones, dig

deep, as if they would hide their counsell
from 
                  •
               he Lord; and contrive in secret
those things, which afterward being
brought to light, cast shame in their
faces, a burden upon their consciences,
a blot upon their name, and (without
repentance) everlasting confusion both
upon body and soule. It were good,
then, to write upon their walls, and to
engrave upon their windowes, that
short Mo
                  •
               to (which as short as it is, yet
our memories are shorter); Cave, Deus
videt, Take heed, God sees it. But then
should wee chiefly call it to minde, and
make use of it, when, beeing inclosed
within our wals, sequestred from company,
occasion and oportunity invite
us to sinne.
         
         
            
            Verse 3.
I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes:
I hate the work of them that turne aside, it
shall not cleave to mee.
            THe Originall hath it, if wee will
render it word for word, I will set
no word of Beliall before mine eyes. But▪
               Word is there figuratively put for Thing;
as likewise, Psal. 41. 8: and so is it rendred
both by Montanus in the Margent,
and in the Text by 
                  
                     •
                  unius; howbeit, in
his comment upon this Psalm, hee precisely
follow the Originall, applying it
against sycophants and flatterers, the
mice and moaths of Court. But, of
these I shal find or take occasiō to speak
heerafter, and for the Present make
choice rather to follow the beatē track
of all the Translations, and other comments
which I have seene; specially
considering, that (to speake properly)
a Word cannot bee the object of the ey,
but a Thing. Well then: one speciall
point of that Wisdom which our Prophet

had promised in the verse going
before, appeares in not setting these
things of Belial, or wicked things, before
his eyes.
            As wee turne away our eyes from
that, or remove that from our eyes
which we like not: so, what wee most
delight in, wee commonly set before
our eyes, or at least wee fixe and set
our eyes upon that. True it is, that the
eyes of the Lord are sayd to be in every
place, beholding the evill and the
good, Pro. 15. 3: yet are they in a special
manner set upon those places and persons
that hee hath a tender care of and
respect unto, and loves in a speciall maner.
Such a place was the Land of
Canaan▪ 
               A Land which the Lord thy God

                     •
                  areth for: the eyes of the Lord thy God are
upon it from the beginning of the yeare, to
the end thereof, he never took off his eye
from it, Deut. 11. 12. Such a person was
David: I vvill instruct thee and teach thee
in the way that thou shall goe: I vvill guide
thee with mine eye; or as the Originall,
Mine eyes shall bee upon thee, Psalme 32. 8.

Such are all those of whom Saint Peter
speakes, The eyes of the Lord are over the
righteous, 1. Pet. 3. 12: and they are so over
them that hee withdrawes not his
eyes from them, Iob 36. 7. Now then,
as they are alwayes sette before Gods
eyes, whom he loves: so is God alway
set before their eyes who love him. I
have set the Lord alwayes before mee,
Psalme 16. 8. Vnto thee lift I up mine
eyes, Psal. 123. 1. And as long as hee
thus set his eyes upon God, and God
before his eyes, hee could not well set
any wicked thing before them. Hee
could not at once intend two such distant
objects; hee might glance, or
squint upon both: but directly fix his
eyes upon both hee could not. This
made him so confident, I will set no wicked
thing before mine eyes.
            
            A bird may light upon a mans house;
but he may choose whether shee shall
nestle or breed there, or no: And the
Divell or his instruments, may represent
a wicked object to a mans sight; but
hee may choose whether he will entertaine

or imbrace it, or no. So that upon
the matter, for a man to set wicked
things before his eyes, is nothing else,
but to sinne of set purpose, to set himselfe
to sinne, or to sell himselfe to sin,
as Ahab did, 1. King. 21. The best among
us, God helpe us, are subject to
sinne. For if we say we have no sinne,
we deceive our selves, and the truth is
not in us: yet by the grace of God we
may be kept from presumptuous sins,
that they have no dominion over us,
Psal. 19. 13. And though wee doe the
evill which we would not doe, yet wee
endeavour to doe the good which wee
doe not; and we delight in the lawe of
God after the inner man, though wee
feele in our members another law warring
and rebelling against the lawe of
our mind, and bringing us into captiuitie
to the lawe of sin, Rom. 7. In such,
sinne ever goes with some unwillingness,
with some wrastling and striving,
with some remorse of heart and check
of conscience: whereas the unrepentant
sinner sets wicked things before

his eyes, hee seekes out provocations,
and hunts after occasions of sinning, he
goes on with an high hand and a stiffe
neck, and is carried with a swinge, as a
ship under full saile: hee drinkes-in iniquity
as the beast licks up the water, or
the fish catches at the bait: hee cannot
sleep nor rest quietly in his bed, before
hee have done some mischiefe: his only
study is, to fulfill the desires of the flesh:
and, having his conscience seared with an
hot iron, and being past feeling, he gives him
selfe over to vvorke all manner of uncleanness,
and that with greediness: hee returnes
to his former sinnes, as the horse rusheth into
the battell, Ier. 8. 6. He makes haste, he
runs to all excess of ryot, I. Pet. 4. 4. And
being come to this pass, hee gets him a
brow of brass, a strumpets forehead that
canon blush, Ier. 3. 3. He declares his sin
like Sodome, and hides it not, Esa. 3. 9.
And then, Peccator cum in profundum venerit,
contemnit, when he is thus plunged
in the gulfe of sinne, hee growes
desperate, hee neither feares God, nor
cares for man. Take heed then of setting

wicked things before thine eyes,
that is, of sinning ex destinata malitiâ, of
set purpose, say alwaies, and practice
with our Prophet: Mine eyes are ever toward
the Lord, Psal. 25. 15. And that shal
keepe thee safe, or cure thee beeing
wounded; as the looking upon the brasen
Serpent did the Israelites, stung
with the fiery Serpents, Num. 21. 9.
            
               N
                     •
                   vvicked thing] The originall is a
thing of Belial: which word, because
we do not often meet with, I thought
it not amisse at this time to open the
sense and nature of it, so far as it makes
for our present purpose. It is not unlikely
in my judgement, that it alludes
to Baal, the common Idoll of the Nations,
bordering upon the Iews, whom
the Patriarchs, and Prophets, and Penmen
of holy Scripture, changing some
letters by way of scorne, called it Belial.
As the Prophet Hos
                     •
                  a, chap. 4. 15. calles
Bethel, which signifies the house of
God, Bethaven, which signifies the
house of an Idol; because there Ieroboam
had set up one of his goldē Calves,

1. King. 12. 29. And to express a further
hatred to this Idol, and in it to all Idolarrous
worshippe, they applyed this
name of Belial to the Divell: and thus
is it taken, 2. Cor. 6. 15. What harmony
or concord hath Christ with Belial?
They can never fall-in, or make musick
together in one Quire.
            The word is, by diverse, diversely
derived. Some fetch it from a roote
which signifies, not to profit; by reason
of the great hurt and losse hee brings &amp;
intends to mankinde, 1. Pet. 5. 8. Others
from a roote, that signifies, not to rise
or mount upward; because he seeks the
fall of mankinde, and to keepe those
downe that are fallen into his snares, 2.
Tim. 2. 26. But Saint Hierome, who studied
the holy Lauguage, in the holy
Land it selfe, for many years together,
and had a skilfull Iew to his Master,
fetches it from a roote that signifies,
without a yoke, or lawless: and therefore
the Septuagint commonly translate
it 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , as a man would say, altother
irregular. And this I take to be the

most probable; in as much, as where
wee reade of a sonne or a childe, or a
man of Belial, through the Scriptures,
for the most part, it is in regard of some
notorious disobedience, in casting off
the yoake of subiection. Thus the sons
of Eli are called the sonnes of Belial,
1 Sam. 2. 12: and the reason is given, because
they hearkened not to the voyce of
their Father. In the tenth of the same
booke, verse 27. a band of men, whose
hearts God had touched, went with
Saul: but the children of Belial saide,
How shall this man save us? and they despised
him, and brought him no presents. In
the 2. of Sam. 20. 1. There was a man
of Belial, Sheba the sonne of Bichri, that
blew a trumpet, and sayd, Wee have no
part in David, neither have we inheritance
in the son of Ishi, Every man to his tents,
O Israel. In the 2. of Chron. 13. 7. those
who stuck to Ieroboam, against Rehoboam
the sonne of Salomon, are tearmed
vaine men, the children of Belial. And
Saint Paul as I thinke, alluding hereto,
2. Thes. 2. 8. cals Antichrist, Satans eldest

sonne, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , because at his pleasure
hee shakes off the yoke of obedionce
to the lawes, both of God and
man; and such, as go about to advance
his kingdom by inciting men to serve
other Gods, are called the children of
Belial, Deut. 13. 13.
            Now as there are sonnes of Belial,
so are there things of Belial, of which
we reade, Deut. 15. 9. And here in this
place, I will set no wicked thing, or
thing of Belial, before mine eyes:
whereby may be understood any divelish
thing, tending to withdraw us frō
sobriety and godliness, whether it bee
so in its owne nature, or by our corrupt
nature it be made so to us: as, lascivious
spectacles, wanton pictures, either
dead or living, or images for religious
use, which som good Divines are
of opinion our Prophet heere meant.
Nothing more different from Beliall
than God, than Christ, than a glorified
Saint; and yet than the representation
of God, or of Christ, or of a Saint for
religious use, nothing more a thing of

Belial, be it never so curiously wroght,
never so artificially graven or carved,
never so lively coloured, or richly attired:
nay, be it of massie silver &amp; gold,
garnished with jewels and precious
stones; yet beening put to religious use,
it is still a thing of Belial. And the more
divine the person is whō it represents,
and the more artificiall the representation,
the more dishonour it doth him
who is adored in it; and the more it insnares
him who doth adore by it: and
consequently, it still proves the more a
thing of Beliall.
            Now, the best way for a man to keep
himselfe free from this offence, is, To
keep him free from the society, at least
the domestick and familiar society, the
inward bosom-acquaintance of those,
who think it a main part of their religion,
to set such things before their eyes.
The Ark and Dagon will not stand together:
neither can a Crucifix, ordained
to such an use, and Christ himselfe
well dwell together under the same
roof.
            
               I read in the second of Samuel 16. 7,
that Shimei called David a man of Beliall:
and beeing then guilty to himselfe
of setting a thing of Beliall before his
eyes, in the matter of Bathsheba, though
Abishai would presently have taken
Shimei his head from his shoulders, yet
would not David suffer him so much as
to touch a hair of his head: hee took it
as patiently as hee did the reprooving
of Nathan the Prophet; though the one
came to gall him, and the other to cure
him. Hee saw the hand of God in it,
that, having set a thing of Belial before
his eyes, one should not be wanting to
tell him that hee was a man of Beliall.
It was malice in Shimei, patience in David,
justice in God. The malice of Shimei
was afterward justly punished, the
patience of David rewarded, and the
justice of God ever admired. Nay,
heerein againe appeares the justice of
God, that, if wee set wicked things before
our eyes for the commit
                  •
               ing of
sinne, God in his season sets the guilt of
it before our eyes; beeing committed

for the conversion of som: as, Psal. 51. 3,
I knowe my transgressions, and my sinne is
ever before mee; but, for the confusion
of others, I will reproovet
                     •
                  ee, and set before
thee the things that thou hast done, Psal.
50. 21. Therefore saith our Prophet, I
will set no wicked thing before mine eyes.
            
            
               Before mine eyes. More danger there
is of setting wicked things before this
sense, than any other: and therefore
our Prophet, having prayed GOD to
turn his heart to the keeping of his testimonies,
immediately addeth, Turne
away mine eyes, O Lord, from regarding
vanity, Psal. 119. 37; as supposing
this later the readiest meanes and best
way for attaining the former. But Iob
steppeth yet one degree further, from
a Praier to a Vow, I have made a covenant
with mine eye: why then should I look on
a maid? 31. 1. And which is more, from
a Vow to an Imprecation. If mine heart
have walked after mine eye, let me sowe, and
let another eat, yea let my plants be rooted out,
verse 7. This was the Vow and the Imprecation
of this holy man; howbeit

the common practice of men bee that
of Salomon; Thine eyes shall looke upon
strange women, and thine heart shall speake
lewd things. I remember, I have read
a Dialogue betwixt the Eye and the
Heart, which of them should worke
most mischief; and the conclusion of
it was,

                  Ratio litem dirimit
                  Definitivo calculo,
                  Cordi causam imputans,
                  Occasionem oculo:
               
            
            Reason takes up the matter, and decides
the controversie, by imputing the
cause to the Heart, and the occasion to
the Eye; the Eye beeing as it were the
Pandar or Broker, but the Heart the
Strumpet: though S. Peter seem to impute
it to the Eye, Having eyes full of
adultery, and that cannot cease to sin,
2. Pet. 2. 14; or, as the Originall reads
it, full of an adulteress. Where we see
(by a figurative manner of speech) the
very chair and throne of wantonnesse
to bee seated in the Eye; how
                  ••
               it it be
in truth but the passage &amp; pipe to convay

it to the soule: yet such a passage as
the Fathers generally understand of it,
those passages of Ieremy, Death hath climed
up by the windowes, 9. 21. And again,
Lament. 3. (as the Vulgar reads it) Oculus
meus depraedatus est animam meam,
mine ey hath made a prey of my soule.
            Which, the very Heathens well understanding,
in the dedication of the
severall parts of mans body to their severall
gods and goddesses (as, the cars
to Minerva, the tongue to Mercury, the
arms to Neptune) they leave the eye to
Cupid, their god of lust, as being the fittest
for his use; the proverb houlding
alike in inordinate lust, as in ordinarie
love, Out of sight, out of minde: Vbi
dolor, ibi digitus; ubi amor, ibi oculus: as
the finger alway waits on grief, so doth
the eye on lust. Whence it may bee in
the Greek, the same word (only by the
change of a vowell) signifies both to
see and to love. Valerius fitly cals the
eyes the spies which ly in ambush for
the un
                  •
               lermining of other mens mariages.
And Alexander, using a different

phrase, shot at the same marke, when
hee called the Persian maides dolores oculorum,
griefes of the eyes; and thereupon
in my iudgement, hee wisely refused,
that Darius his wife (whose
beauty the Macedonians so much admired
and commended) should bee
once brought into his presence; as fearing
lest hee who had manfully subdued
so many nations, should himselfe be
shamefully conquered at the sight of
a woman: but on the other side, the
Comedians, saith Clemens Alexandrinus,
bring-in the wanton Sardanapalus,
sitting in an ivory chaire, and casting
his eyes in every corner.
            
               Dinah goes a straggling through the
country: whom when Sichem, heire to
the Lord of the countrey, sawe (sayes
the text) he tooke her and lay with her,
and deflowred her. It is noted of Potiphars
wife, that she first cast her eye on
Ioseph, before she inticed him to folly;
and of our Prophet, that from the roof
of the Kings Palace (their houses being
square and flat on the top) he sawe

a woman washing herselfe. And what
followed upon it you know: first goes
videt hanc, then quickly comes after,
visamque cupit, and instruments will not
be wanting for potiturque cupita.
            
            —vidit sine veste Dianam,
            Praeda fuit canibus nec minùs ille suis.
            This irregular glancing, or inordinate
gazing, is that which metamorphosies
a man into a beast, and makes
him a prey to his owne brutish affections.
            The Divell knew full well the danger
of this sense, when hee presented
before our Saviours eye all the kingdomes
of the world, and the glory of
them; and Hezekiah learned it to his
griefe, when he stirred up such coales
in the Babylonish Ambassadors by shewing
them his treasure, that they never
left, till they came and fetcht it away. I
saw among the spoyle a goodly Babylonish
garment, saith Achan, and two hundred
shekles of silver, and a wedge of gold, and
I coveted them, and tooke them. Thus as
it is the instrument of wantonness, so is

it of covetousne
                  •
               s, and of gluttony and
drunkenness too. Looke not thou (saith
Salomon) upon the wine when it is red, and
when it shewes his colour in the cup; in the
end thereof it will hurt like a Serpent, and
bite like a Cocatrice, Prov. 23. 31. So is it
of pride; looking-glasses being nothing
else but the artificiall eyes of pride, as
our naturall eye is a kinde of living looking-glasse,
by which so many staines
and blemishes are not discovered in
the face, as imprinted in the soule: and
lastly, so it is of Idolatry; the Prophet
Esay in his twentith chapter, stiling the
Idols of Egypt the abomination of
the eyes, twice within the compass of
two verses, ver. 7. 8. Whence it is, in my
iudgement, that among all those idolatrous
nations which worshipped false
gods, and went a-whoring after their
owne in ventions, the greatest part have
ever consented in worshipping the
host of heaven, the Sunne, the Moone
or the Starres, which among all creatures
the eye most admireth and delighteth
in. Good reason then had our

Saviour, to say, If thine eye bee evill, all
the body is darke, Mat. 6. 23: and Saint
Iohn, 1. Epist. 2. 16, to make the lust of
the eyes one of those three fountaines
from which all other vices streame.
            The sonn
                  •
               s of God saw the daughters
of men that they were faire: and
then followes that mischiefe which
drew on the flood on the olde world.
The first woman sawe the fruit of the
tree of knowledge, that it was pleasant
to the eye: and from thence issued
that first sinne, the mother of all the evill
which wee both doe and suffer.
Whence it may be, in the Hebrew the
same word signifieth as well an eye, as
a fountaine; to shew that from it, as
from a spring or fountaine, did flowe
both sinne it selfe, the cause of sinne,
and misery, the punishment of both.
And if our first parents were thus bewitched
by the eye, and thereby received
their bane in the state of innocency,
when their appetite was yet subordinate
to reason, and their reason to
God, what can wee promise to our

selues, Qui animas etiam incarnavimut,
who have made our very spirit a lump
of flesh, prone to entertaine vice; but,
weake God knowes, to resist it? They
are in a manner composed of flax or
tinder, apt to conceiue fire, and to bee
inflamed by the least sparke admitted
by this sense: except it be speedily repelled
or quenched by grace.
            Great reason then had our Prophet
to pray, and wee with him, Turne away
mine eyes, O Lord, from beholding
vanitie: great reason had hee to
promise and we with him, I will set no
wicked thing before mine eyes: the
one, for the imploring of Gods assistance,
and the other for the quickning
of our owne endeavours.
         
         
            
            I hate the worke of them that fall away, or
turne aside: it shall not cleave to me.
            BEcause, such as set wicked things
before their eyes, commonly turn
aside after their owne inventions and
desires; therefore our Prophet having
in the former part of this verse, promised
not to set any wicked thing before
his eyes, here hee professeth to
hate the worke of them that turne aside or
fall away.
            
            
               I hate] It is but Stoicisme and vanity,
to think that all passions either may be
or should be utterly rooted out of the
soule. They cannot, beeing as naturall
to the soules sensitive power, as the
will and unsterstanding are to the reasonable:
they should not, in that Saint
Paul, censures it as a fault, to be without
naturall affection,
               Rom. 1. 30 in that being qualified
and corrected by reason, they become
usefull for the executing of that
which reason directs (they are good
servans being kept under, but bad commanders,

having gotten the mastery)
and lastly, in that they are found even
in the glorified Saints, in the blessed
Angels, in Man before his fall, in Christ
as Man, and are in holy Scriptures attributed
to God himself.
            It is a good conclusion of Thomas;
Animae paessiones malae moraliter dicend
                     •
                  
non sunt, sed quae contra &amp; praeter rationis
iudicium sunt: The passions of the mind
are not to bee tearmed morally evill,
but in that they are either against or beside
the dictate of reason: And of Augustine
before him, Interest qualis sit volunt
as hominis: qui
                     •
                   siperversa est, perversos
habebit hos motus; si autem recta est, non
soluminculpabiles, sed etiam laudabiles erunt.
It availes not a little, how the will of
man stands affected: which if it be perverse,
these affections will likewise bee
irregular; but if it bee straight, they
will not onely bee without fault, but
deserve commendation.
            The 
                  •
               ost universall, the most operative,
and the most durable passions of
the soule, are Love and Ha
                     •
                  red: they

spread farthest, they pearce deepest,
they last longest. Now, as all the other
passions flowe from love as their fountain,
so doth hatred too. It may seem a
strange assertion, yet is it certainely a
true one, Cum nihil odi
                     •
                   habeatur nisi quod
adversatur bono convenienti &amp; quod amatur,
omne odium ex amore nasci necesse est:
since we hate nothing but what is contrary
to the good wee love, it cannot
bee, but hatred must spring out of love.
Fear ariseth from some danger apprehended
of losing the thing wee love;
grief, from the sense of the loss of that
wee love; and hatred, from the impatience
of opposition against that wee
love: so that the more our love is, the
more is our fear to lose that wee love,
the more our griefe if wee lose it, and
the more our hatred to that which opposeth
against it.
            Since then our Prophets affection
was such towards God, that his soule
thirsted for him as a dry land where no
water is; that his heart panted after
him, as the Hart brayeth after the water-brooks,

that his favour was better
to him than life it selfe, and his words
sweeter than hony, more pretious than
thousands of gold and silver; it cannot
bee, but his hatred should answer in
proportion to that which is opposite
to Gods law, &amp; derogatory to his glory.
No mervail then, that hee not only
mislikes, or dis-affects, or approoves
not; but detests, abhorres hates the work
of them that fall away.
            
            An hatred there is of malice, and an
hatred of zeal; the one profane &amp; carnal,
the other holy and divine: the one,
as a stinking and poysonsome weed,
shoots up every where through the
field of the world: the other, as a pretious
herbe or rare outlandish flowre,
comes up thinne, and that but in a few
mens gardens, neither prospers it long
without much tending and cherishing.
The one is sowen in our hearts by that
envious man, who hates the light, because his
deeds are evil; the other, planted by that
good Spirit, who hates all the workers of
iniquity, Psal. 5. 5. Of it speaks our Saviour,

               The world hates mee, because I testifie
of it, that the works thereof are evill: And
our Psalmist, the type of our Saviour,
They that hate mee without a cause, are more
in number than the hairs of my head.
            
            To hate those that hate us, is heathenish;
to hate those that are harmelesse
and innocent, is brutish; but to hate
those that love us, and seek our good by
telling us the truth, that is divelish. Am
I therefore your enemy, because I tell you the
truth? saith S. Paul to the Galathians:
And Ahab to Eliah, Hast thou found
mee, O mine enimy? Yet this enemy
of his it was, that brought him at last to
an outward and seeming repentance at
least, and consequently to the turning
away of Gods wrath in his daies. This
kinde of hatred is one of those three
bad daughters, born of three good mothers:
Contempt beeing commonly the
birth of Familiarity; Idleness, of Peace;
and Hatred, of Truth. But, this is not
of kin to the hatred our Prophet heer
speaks of▪ So far was he from hatred of
the truth, that (I think) hee loved and

honoured the Propher Nathan the better
while he lived, for telling him the
truth, when others flattered him. Once
I am sure, that afterwards he gave him
free accesse into his bed-chamber, and
named him a Commissioner for the
declaring of his Successor:1 King. 1 but the hatred
here spoken of, is of vice and superstition,
arising frō the love of truth
and vertue: without which, hee that is
hottest in matters of religion, can bee
but luke-warme; and hee that walkes
most upright, must needs halt between
two opinions. This hatred then as it is
commended in private men; so is it necessary
in Magistrate; just anger being
the whetstone of courage, and this
hatred, of justice: which, as one truly
sayes, delights not so much to see men
severely punished, as justice duely executed;
that is▪ hates the worke, but
loves the person: therefore saith our
Propher, I hate the worke of them that
turne aside; not the persons but the work,
that is the object of his hatred, and the
second thing I am to speake of.
            
               
               The worke.] As wee are not to love
the vice for the mans sake, so neither
are wee to hate the man for the vice. It
is proper to God alone, who as Creator
hath ius vitae &amp; necis, an absolute
dominion over all his creatures (disposing
of them at his pleasure) to affect or
reject, to love or hate them, as he will;
his will beeing indeed the measure of
right, and the rule of justice. Vnto Cain
and his offering, hee had no respect,
Gen. 4. 5. First, hee had no respect to
Caine, his person; and then to his work,
his offering: and yet hee did him no
wrong. Iacob have I loved, but Esau
have I hated: and the Apostle addes,
the children beeing yet unborne, neither
having done any good, or evill.
What shall wee say then, Is there unrighteousnesse
with God? God forbid.
Hath not the Pot
                     •
                  er power over the
clay, of the same lump to make one vessell
to honour, and another to dishonour? Shall
the thing formed, say to him that formed it,
why hast thou made mee thus? Now, because
we are to conforme our wills to

Gods will, that is, his revealed will (in
as much as wee cannot conforme our
selves to that we know not, and hee reserves
to himselfe) we may therefore
safely and justly hate those, whom God
hath namely and particularly expressed
that hee hates; but, for others, wee
may and we ought to hate their lying &amp;
their fal
                     •
                  e wayes, as our Prophet speakes:
but for the Lyers themselves, and those
that walke in such wayes, wee have no
warrant that I know, to hate them.
            There is a perfect hatred mentioned
by our Prophet, Psal. 139: which Saint
Augustine understands to be, when a
man hates the manners, but loves the
man; when hee hates the action, but
loves the person. False witnesses did rise
up against mee▪ they layd to my charge things
that I knew not, saith hee, Psal. 35; there
is their action, that hee hated: neverthelesse
when they were sick, I put on
sackcloth, and humbled my selfe with
fasting; there's his love to their persons.
2. Sam. 15. He praies against the wicked
policie of Achitophel: O Lord, I pray thee

turn the counsel fo Achitophel into foolishnes;
but against Achitophel himselfe, wee
finde not that hee prayed: howbeit,
David had advanced him to honour,
and hee now sided with those Rebels
that had taken up armes against him. It
is to this purpose good advice of Saint
Augustine, Hominem Deus fecit, praevaricatorem
ipse se fecit; ama in illo quod Deus
fecit, persequere in illo quod ipse sibi fecit;
God made man upright, but they
have found out many inventions to
make themselves crooked: Love that
in him which God made, but hate that
in him which himselfe made. And in
another place, Nec propter vitium oder is
hominem, nec ames vitium propter hominē,
sed oder is vitium, ames hominem. Many
thinke they may love God, and yet
hate their brother: but Saint Iohn is
bold to put the lye upon such, 1. Iohn 4.
20; If any man say, I love God, &amp; hates
his brother; he is a lyer. If any man like
not the phrase, let him chalenge him
for it. Others thinke they may hate
their brother, and yet God love them

well enough: but them he tels, Whosoever
hateth his brother is a murtherer;
and yee knowe that no murtherer
hath eternall life abiding in him: and if
not eternall life, then not the love of
God, 1. Ioh. 3. 15. The object then of
our hatred, must be the worke, not the
man: we must learne
Parcere personis, dicere de vitijs.
            
            It is the commendation of the Angell
of the Church of Ephesus, Revel. 2.
6. This thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds
of the Nicholaitans, which Ialso hate: not
the Nicholaitans, but their deeds; and for
those imprecations wee reade of in diverse
Psalmes, or else-where in holy
Scripture, seeming to inferre or include
hatred to the persons, of those against
whom they be poured out, they
are all either Indefinite, or Conditionall, or
Propheticall. Indefinite, without naming
or ayming at any particular person: or
if they be definite, naming some partilar
person, then are they Conditionall;
intending in the first place, if God have
so ordained it, Conversion; if not, in

the second, Confusion: or if they bee
both definite and absolute, then are
they Propheticall, non tam vota quam vaticinia,
speeches of men inspired, not so
much wishing what they foretell, as
certainely foreseeing and foretelling
that which of themselves they wish
not, Vt in verbis quasi mal
                     •
                   optantis intelligamus
praedicta prophetantis, saith Saint
Augustine: or if they with it, it is either
because they knowe by revelation
it is the will of God, or tht it makes
for the glory of God. And thus Moses
wished his owne name to bee razed
out of the book of life, and Saint Paul
himselfe accursed from Christ, and
both rather then Gods glory should
be blemished by the scandalous imputation
of the Gentiles in the rejection
of the Iewes, his chosen people, To
whom pertained the adoption, and the glory,
and the covenants, and the service of God,
and the promises. This was it likewise
that troubled our Prophet: he was not
so much moved for his owne sake, as
for Gods cause: hee doth not so much

hate the work of them that forsake him
selfe, as of those that forsake God: not
so much of those who turned aside, or
fell away from his friendship, as from
the course of a vertouous and religious
life, or from th service of the true and
living God.
            
               I hate the worke of them t
                     •
                  at fall away.
Whether in doctrin or in mariers, whether
in convesation or in opinion,
whether by impure life or false worship.
His zeale in this case (an affection
equally compounded of love and
anger) was such, that it consumed him,
and (as his owne phrase is) ate him up:
which though it were mystically spoken
of Christ, yet is it literally to bee
understood of David; and yet withall
his excessive griefe, such that his eyes
poured out rivers of waters, because
men kept not Gods lawe. Thus zeale
kindled a fire within him, and his grief
resolved him into teares; to teach us
that in our heate to Gods cause, we forget
not to be tenderly affected towards
men, but to joyne pittie with our earnestness,

and with our fervency, compassion;
and to our compassion, must
be added knowledge and discretion:
otherwise, shall wee be no better than
those reprobate Iewes, who had zeale;
but not according to knowledge: and out
of this perfect composition, fervency,
compassion, and discretion, ariseth that
perfect hatred touched before; but
here falling into its proper place, Doe
I not hate them, O Lord, that hate thee, &amp;
am I not grieved with those that rise up against
thee? I hate them with a perfect hatred,
as if they were mine enemies, Psa. 139.
21. David would scarce have accounted
them good Subjects, who should
not have shewed thēselves enemies to
them, who were enemies to him, and
the State; but reason then, if himselfe
would be reputed a good Subject
unto God, or his Vice-gerent on earth,
he should proclame them his enemies,
who had proclaimed themselves enemies
to God and religion.
            When Croesus was assaulted in the
sight of his dumbe sonne,Herodotus. they write,

the force of Nature wrought so powerfully
in him, that it unloosed the
strings of his tongue, and hee cried out,
Homo ne perimas Croesum. The truth of
of the story I leave to bee defended by
the Authours of it: but this am I sure
of, that scarcely any outward action
more cleares our inward grace of adoption,
arguing us to bee indeed the
sonnes of God, then when wee are
truely sensible of dishonour offered to
our fathers name, when we imbark our
selves in his quarrels, and (as our Psalmist
speakes in another place) The reproches
of them that reproach him, fall upon us.
It argued a righteous soule in Lot, to be
vexed, or as the Originall hath it, to be
tortured, or racked, not so much with the
opposit on, as the uncleane conuersation
of the Sodomites: and it argueth in
a Chrihian man the renewing of the image
of God, stampt upon him in his
Creation, and in a Christian Magistrat
the acknowledgement of his Lieutenantship
to be held from God, when he
shewes himselfe as forward to make

lawes, and draw his sword for the punishing
of sacrilege as theft, blasphemy
as murder, idolatry as treason, atheism
as rebellion; finally, when by his actions
it appears, that he is as zealous and
carefull of the honour and service of
God, as of his owne either gain or glory.
How many have vainely spilt their
blood for the defence of their mistresses
beauty, or their owne imaginary reputation!
which had they done in defence
of God and religion, against atheisme,
idolatry, or blasphemy, they
had undoubtedly purchased both the
renown and reward of Martyrdom.
            Now, as our Prophet professeth to
hate the work of al those that set themselves
against God and godliness; so of
those most specially, who turn aside frō
the right path in which they have somtime
trode, or fall away from that truth
which they have formerly professed. It
is true, that where true justifying and
sanctifying grace is once throughly
seated and settled in the hart, it can never
utterly be rooted out: the degrees

and measure of it may be impaired and
abated, but the habit cannot bee ex
                  •
               inguisht:
the sense and feeling of it may
be interrupted, but the essence &amp; being
cannot be abolisht: the act and exercise
of it may be for a time suspended, but
the character remains indeleble: wch,
being once imprinted upon the soule,
can never afterward bee blotted out or
wiped away; inasmuch as Christ whom
hee loves, hee loves to the end, Iohn 13. 1. his
gifts &amp; calling being without repentance, R
                     •
                  .
11. 29. So then, this we must hold for
a sure ground, Stella cadens non est stella,
cometa fuit: A starre that falls was never
indeed a star, it was but a blazing Meteor.
There may be an outward profession
of doctrine, and participation of
the sacraments; nay, more than so, in
regard of the understanding, an inward
inlightning in som measure; and a taste
of the powers of the world to come, in
regard of the affections, Heb. 6: yet all
this but a counterfeit blaze. No marvell,
then, if such not onely turne, but
turne aside; not onely fall, but fall away:

               They go out from us, because, though
for a time they were among us; yet indeed
and in truth, they were never of us, 1. Iohn
2. 19: but, it had been better for them not to
have knowne the way of righteousnes, than
after they have knowne it, to turne from the
holy commandement delivered unto them,
2. Pet. 2. 21. And better had it beene for
the Church, never to have brought
forth or brought up such grace-lesse
children. These then it is, that David
as a Prophet must hate, and as a Prince
must punish; as beeing most injurious
to the truth, most scandalous to the
Church, most dangerous to the State,
and most odious to God: but, above
all, he must take heed that they proove
not infectious to himself.
            
               Shall not cleave to mee. No work of
them that fall away; but chiefly, their
worke of Aposta
                     •
                  ie and falling away,
That shall not cleave to mee. As likenes
is the cause of love; and That, of union:
so dissimilitude is the cause of
hatred; and That again, of seperation.
That which wee hate, we suffer not to

come, or at least not to abide neer us:
but either wee remove it from us, or
our selves from it; nothing beeing
more hatefull in it self, and in the sight
of God and good men, than to entertain
and imbrace that in our selves, Wch
wee professe wee hate in others. David
then having professed, that hee hates
the work of them that turne aside, hee
could do no less than promise, it should
not cleave to him. Were their arguments
never so plausible, their power
or number never so great, their neernesse
by friendship or kinred never so
inward; though Israel play the harlot,
yet let not Iudah offend: though Saul
turn aside and fall away, yet that is no
warrant for David; nay, rather let Sauls
falling away serve to warn David. The
one fell away and lost his Kingdome
by it: but the other would not fall
away, though it were to the gaining of
a Kingdom, nay, all the Kingdoms of
the world and the glory of them: they
beeing temporall; but the sting, which
followes upon this defection and finall

apostasie, eternall. Witnes that desperate
voice of cursed Iulian: who, sprinkling
his blood in the air, cryed out;
Vicisti Galilaee, vicisti; O Galilean, thou
hast overcom.
            Now, the way to keepe us that this
damnable work of apostasie cleave not
to us, is, to keepe us from cleaving to
the Apostates themselves, or suffering
them to adhere or cleave to us; and
withall, to cleave fast to God. This
was Davids practice. For the first, Their
drink-offerings of blood will I not offer, nor
take up their names within my lips, Psalme
16. 4. So far was hee from cleaving to
them, or suffering them to cleave to
him. And for the second, It is good for
mee to hould fast by God, Psal. 73. 27. And
againe, I have stuck to thy testimonies, O
Lord, put mee not to shame, Psal. 119. 31.
This his utter disclaiming of the one,
and sticking close to the other, was it
that made him so bold in another Psal.
Mine heart is fixed, O God, mine heart is
fixed, 57. 7; and so confident heer, It
shall not cleave to mee. I conclude with

the exhortation of the Apostle, Saint
Paul, Take heed, brethren, lest at any time
there bee in any of you an evill heart and unfaithfull,
to depart away from the living
God, Heb. 3. 12. And with the praier of S.

            Verse 4. The froward heart shall depart
from me: I will know none evill; or, I will
not knowe a wicked person.
            HEe had promised in the second
verse to walk with a perfect hart:
and heer he promiseth, A froward heart
shall depart from him. Now, though that
part of his Vow bee set before this in
place, yet hath this the precedency of
that in order: scales must first fall from
S. Pauls eyes, before he can see clearly;
and Naaman must first be cleansed of
his leprosie, before his flesh com again
as the flesh of a young childe. We must
first deny our selves, before we can follow

Christ; and the heart must first
leave to bee froward, before it beginne
to bee upright: as the distemper of the
body must first bee remooved, before
health can bee restored; and darknesse
first chased away, before the light
break forth.
            In the Verse immediately going before,
hee professed hee hated the work
of those that fall away, or lepart from
God. Now, the best way to provide,
that himself might not bee found faulty
in that which hee hated in others,
was, to strive that a froward heart
should depart from him. For, the more
this frowardnes decreaseth in us, the
neerer wee draw to God; and the closer
it sticks unto us, the farther we wander
from God. True indeed it is, that
it can never utterly depart our soules,
till our soules depart our bodies, and
both body and soule depart this vale of
tears. While the heart lives its naturall
life, it will also live in our hearts: and,
as the heart is among the bodily members
the first that lives, and the last that

dies; so is this amongst all the corrupt
affections of the heart: yet must wee
still labour to mortisie it, that though it
remaine, yet it raigne not in vs; though
it live, yet the strength of it be broken,
and the head of it crushed.
            Againe, in that hee speakes of parting
with a froward heart, hee freely
acknowledges, that though hee were
by grace a man after Gods owne hart;
yet by nature beeing without God as
well as others, hee could not bee without
this froward heart; neither his
Calling, nor his Crowne could priviledge
him in that Case: unless in becomming
a King, hee should leaue to
be a man; and being advanced in dignity,
he should shake-off nature: which
being voyde of grace, rather serves to
deprave nature farther, than any way
to correct it.
            Once in this Psalme hee promised a
reformation of his eyes, twice of his
heart: therefore a double watch is to
be set over the heart, in regard of any
other member. Salomon begins with it,

               Prov. 4. 23, Keepe thy heart with all diligence;
or as the Originall reades, abo
                     •
                  e
all keeping, as a man would say with
double diligence: for out of it are the issues
of life. And from the heart he comes to
the mouth, ver. 24. Put away from thee
a froward mo
                     •
                  th; and from the mouth
to the eyes, ver. 25. Let thine eyes looke
right on; and from the eyes to the feet,
ver. 26. Ponder the path of thy feet; and
from the feet to the hand, ver. 27. Turn
not to the right hand, nor to the left: thereby
shewing us, that the heart is as the
first wheele of the Clock: if this bee
either righ
                  •
               , or disordered, so are the
rest. For, as out of the aboundance of
the heart the mouth speaketh; so the
eyes looke, the feet walke, the hand
moves.
            As the heart is the shop of the vitall
spirits, and they againe the food of the
naturall life: so is it likewise the fountain
of new birth, and That the beginning
of our spirituall life. Those sacrifices,
in which no heart was found,
were by the Heathen counted ominous.
            
               Their conceit therein might bee
superstitious; but I am sure tis true,
that those religious exercises in which
the heart is wanting, cannot be acceptable
unto God. Hear, then, with thine

                  ••
               res, but with thy heart too; pray

                  ••
               th thy lips, but with thy heart too;
receive the
                  •
                Sacrament with thine
hand, but with thy heart too: otherwise,
thy hearing, thy praying, thy receiving,
being heartless, will in the end
proove f
                  •
               uitless. Therefore doth our

                  •
               rophe
                  •
                so often beat upon this heart-string,
A froward heart shall depart from
mee.
            
            Frowardnes is sometimes universally
extended to the whole corruption
of the heart: as, Psal. 58. 3, The ungodly
are froward, even from their mothers
wombe: and so it includes both
Ieremies deceitfull heart, 17. 9, The heart
is deceitfull above all things, who can know
it? and Ezekiels stony heart, 11. 19. I
will take from them their stony heart, and
give them a heart of flesh: and Saint Stephens
uncircumcised heart; Acts 7. 51.

Yee stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart
and eares: and Saint Pauls foolish heart,
Rom. 1. 21. They became vaine in their imaginations,
and their foolish heart was full of
darkness. And thus our froward heart is
both stony, and uncircumcised, hard, an
                  •
               
               impure, in regard of it selfe; deceitfu
                     ••
                  
               
full of windings and turnings, in regard
of men; and lastly, foolish, voyd of all
true knowledge and understanding, in
regard of God. Now, to this hard wee
must oppose a tender heart, compassionating
the miseries of men, relentin
                  •
               
at the threatnings of God, and bleeding
in the consideration of its owne
naturall hardness. To this impure wee
must oppose a cleane heart, Create in me
O God a cleane heart; cleane, though not
from all stain, yet frō the foule blots of
gross sinnes; though not from all impuritie,
yet from hypocrisie. To this
deceitfull we must oppose a simple heart,
sine plicis, without pleits and foldes,
speaking as we thinke, and doing as we
speake: and lastly, to this foolish wee
must oppose a wise heart; wise I meane

in things appertaining to saluation, and
the mysteries of godliness.
            More specially, frowardness against
God, in holy Scripture, is contracted
either to stubbornness and rebellion, in not
submitting our necks to the yoke of
his law; or to repining and murmuring, in
not submitting our backs to the rod of
his chastisement. The first is peruersnesse
and obstinacy, and it shewes it
selfe either in preferring the traditions
of men before, or equalling them to
the Oracles of holy Scripture, and the
ordinances of Christ▪ or which is as
bad, if not worse, in preferring the devices
and desires of our hearts before
the express injunction or inhibition of
Gods commandements: faire pretenses
may be made for the former; but
for the later no colour, no excuse at all.
I will instance onely in the two last
precepts of the first table, because they
immediately concerne the honour of
God. Thou shalt not take my name in
vaine, saith God: if then I speake of
him jestingly or inconsiderately, or

sweare by him rashly or falsly, knowing
what he commands, and my selfe
practice; Doth not this argue a froward
heart?
            Remember that thou keep holy the
Sabbath day, saith God. If then I
spend it in gaming or idleness, in gluttony
and drunkenness, in chambering
&amp; wantonness, knowing what he commands
and my selfe practice; Doth
not this argue a froward heart? This
froward heart it is, that our Prophet
doth heer promise to put away. And
surely not without great cause; since
hee had learned (no doubt) out of the
26. of Levit. ver. 24, If yee will not be reformed,
but wil walk stubbornly against me,
I will also vvalke stubbornly against you,
I will punish you yet seuen times: that is, in
the highest degree. Neither could he be
ignorant or forgetfull of the message
of Samuel to Saul, yet fresh in memory,
To obey is better than sacrifice, and to
hearken than the fat of Rams: but rebellion
is as the sinne of witch-craft,
and stubbornness as idolatry; Because

thou hast reiected the word of the Lord, he
hath also reiected thee from beeing King,
1 Sam. 15. 22. 23. Nay, himselfe had
told vs in another Psalme,
               Psal. 18. 26 speaking of
God, With the pure thou wilt shew thy
selfe pure, and with the froward thou wil
                     •
                  
shew thy self froward: or as the Originall
beares it, Thou wilt wrastle with the froward.
Now, if God come to wrastle
with man, though with the stoutest
of men, the commander of heaven &amp;
earth with dust and ashes, it cannot but
proue impar congressus, as the wrastling
of a Giant with a Dwarfe; wee shall
make no match with him: Hee it is that
looseth the bond of Kings, and powreth contempt
vpon Princes, if they contemne him,
Iob 12. As severe as they are towards
their inferiors, if they carry themselves
frowardly towards them; so severe
is hee to them if they carry themselves
frowardly toward him. Let them
alwayes then remember, that
Omne sub regno graviore regnum est:
            
            Every earthly kingdome must yeeld
an account to a higher. And let them

deale with God, as they would haue others
to deale with them: the same obedience
which they expect from others,
themselves must first performe
to God. And the more and greater
blessings they have received from him,
the stronger is their obligation of obedience
to him: specially considering
that God demands it at our hands, as a
thing not any way beneficiall to himselfe
(For, our goodness extendeth not to
him, Psalme 16. 1) but onely as profitable
to our selves. Neither doth hee
binde vs to any blinde obedience as
the Padres doe their novices; nor exacts
at our hands the sacrificing of our sons
and daughters, and the passing of them
through the fire, as the Divels did of
the Heathen: but onely tyes us to his
will revealed in his worde. The execution
whereof is no lesse comfortable
for this present life, then necessary for
that which is to come. The first thing
then, and the chiefe, in abandoning
this frowardnesse, is, the submitting of
our necks with all forwardnesse to the

yoake of Gods lawe; which though it
seeme at first to be burdensome to flesh
and blood, yet that being once mastered,
His commandements are not grievous,
1 Iohn 5. 3. Nay, his yoake is easie, and his
burden light, Mat. 11. 30.
            The next is the submitting our backs
to the rod of his chastisement; and as
the former required our obedience,
so doth this our patience. For, after we
have by our obedience done the wil of
God, yet even then wee have need of
patience for the finishing of the race
that is set before us, Heb. 10. 36. It is a
fair step to perfection &amp; victory, when
a man can say with the Church in the
44. Psalm, Though all this become upon us,
yet forget we not thee, nor behaue our selues
frowardly in thy covenant. And with Mauritius
the Emperor, when he felt the utmost of misery,
Iustus es Domine, &amp; iusta
sunt iudicia tua, Righteous art thou O
Lord, &amp; upright are thy judgements: &amp;
with that noble Lord of Plessis, when
hee had lost his eldest and his only son,
and as I take it, his only childe, a Gentleman

of marvelous great hope, Tacui
&amp; non locutus sum, quia tu Domine fecisti:
I held my peace and opened not my
mouth, because it was thy dooing O
Lord. I deny not but the best may at
times, when they feele the hand of
God heavy upon them, growe pettish,
and breake out with Iob, Let the day perish
wherein I vvas borne; or with Eliah,
It is enough, now O Lord take awaey my life;
or with Ionah, I doe well to be angry even
unto death: (though that were indeede
an high degree of impatience) or with
our Prophet, Hath the Lord forg
                     •
                  tten to
be gracious, and will hee shut up his loving
kindnesse in displeasure.
            
            These motions may suddenly arise
in their hearts, and they may speake unadvisedly
with their lippes: yet they
take care that frowardnesse doo not
possesse their hearts. And when they
come to themselves, they are as ready
to say with one of them, Though hee slay
mee, yet will I trust in him, Iob 13. 15. And
with another, Though I walke through
the valley of the shadowe of death, I will

feare none evill: for thou art with me, thy
rod and thy staffe they comfort me, Psalme
23. 4. When a man is once growen to
this assurance, that God loves him;
hee takes every stroke at Gods hand as
a severall pledge of his love, &amp; kisses the
very rod that strikes him; as knowing
that the rod of Aaron, and the pot of
Manna must goe together: but, when
that assurance wants, if God strike a
man for his disobedience, it makes him
fret with impatience, till that provoke
another stroke: and the more he is st
                  ••
               cken,
the more impatient hee growes;
and againe, the more impatient hee
growes, the more is hee st
                  ••
               cken: till in
the end, insteed of confession and submission,
he breake out into open defiance
and rebellion against his striker,
challenging his Maker of injustice, and
from that to indignation and gnashing
of teeth; which is nothing else, but a
kinde of frowardnes proper to Divels
&amp; damned spirits. Now, the higher we
are in place, the more impatient we cō
               mōly
are of crosses, supposing we shold

have God at our beck, as we have men,
&amp; being apt to say, with Pharaoh, Who
is the Lord that hee should thus cross
me: but let such take heed, lest while
they imitate Pharaoh in his rebellion,
they partake with him in his confusion.
            Now, as from the love of God
flowes the love of man: so from this
frowardnesse of obstinacy and impatience
towards God, for the most part
issues a frowardness of ha
                  •
               shnes &amp; bitterness
towards men, opposite to that
meeknesse which Christianitie, and
that sweetnesse of disposition which
morall Phylosophie teacheth us. The
symptomes of it are, a bended brow,
a frowning eye, a sharpe tongue, a
a hanging lip, a clowdy and lowring
countenance; the ca

                  s faire speech, and stretching
forth of the hand, was it that stole the
hearts of the men of Israell: as on the
other side Rehoboams crabbedness was
it that forced the people to say, What
portion have vvee in David, neither have
wee inheritance in the sonne of Iesse, to your
tents O Israel. One gentle word, one gracious
look would then have won them
for ever, whereas his dogged answer
                  •
               
wrought him a deep and irrecoverable
losse. Vt ameris, amabilis esto, the way to
be beloved, is to be lovely in carriage,
and amiable in condition: and the best
guard of Commanders, is the love of
inferiors.

world, cannot so safely guard the person
of a Soveraigne, as the love of his

then of affability and curtesie (a word

as it is commendable in private men;
so in a Magistrate, such as David, is it
in a manner necessary: as the contrary
vice of frowardness, which in private

them is both dishonourable and dangerous.

or as both our vulgar English and last
Translation reade it, [I will not know a
vvicked person] the Originall beares
both: &amp; if we take it the first way, it is
to be referred to things; if the second,
to men▪ Evill, in as much as it hath no
Entitie or Beeing it in self, but in good,
and nothing can be farther knowen
then it hath a Beeing, consequently it
cannot be knowen of us in it selfe, but
onely by the knowledge of good; as
darknes is by the knowledge of light,
&amp; sickness by the knowledge of health.
Rectū est index sui et obliqui, the evenness
of a straight line, is the best way to discover
the unevennesse of a crooked;
and the knowledge of true syllogisms,
the deceit of fallacies. This knowledge

of evill then arising by reflexion
frō good, is not in it self unlawfull;
in as much as God thus knowes the utmost
extent and possibilitie of evill,
though never acted, or to be acted, and
yet remaines altogether untainted in
himselfe, as the Sunne-beames which
glaunce upon sinks or dunghils. Yet
this very knowledge, though not unlawfull
in it selfe, in regard of our corrupt
nature to us it is dangerous; like
a sparke cast upon flax or tinder, which
easily conceives fire. Adams eating of
the tree of Knowledge of good and evill,
was it that brought all that ensuing
miserie upon himselfe and his posterity,
yet was hee then in the state of
innocency. To know evill that we may
runne the farther from it, or hate it the
more, is good: but now, there is such
a sympathie between us and it, that for
the most part the more wee knowe it,
whether it be by reading or by relation,
or experience, the more are we inamoured
of it.

               We need not then go seek it in books,
or farre countries: it will comesoone
enough and fast enough of it selfe, it
will come home to us, and find us out.
Let us resolve then with our Prophet,
that wee will not seeke so much as the
knowledge of evill, farther than for the
better practice of good.
            But I rather fasten upon our vulgar
and last translation, I will not know a
vvicked person.] For a Magistrate to
know wicked persons that hee may punish
them, is a part of his dutie. And
for a private man to know them, that
he may shun their company, is a signe
both of honestie and discretion. Take
away the drosse from the silver,Pro. 25. 4. 5 and
there shal come foorth a vessell for the
Finer: take away the wicked from before
the King, and his throne shall be established
in righteousness; and this
doth our Prophet promise in the last
verse of this Psalme. But for a Magistrate
or private man to know thē, that
is, to entertain them, to credit or coūtenance
them, to admit them into their

friendship or service, to lodge them in
house with them, or place them in office
under them; is that which our Prophet,
and with him all good men, specially
all good Magistrates, utterly disavow:
considering the three-fold hazard
from thence manifestly incurred
of Suspicion, of Infection, of Malediction.
Of suspicion from others, of infection in
themselves, of malediction and punishment
from God.
            The hazard of Suspicion from others,
in as much as wee commonly ghesse at
a mans inclination by the disposition of
his servant or company, because (for
the most part) birds of a feather will
together. 1. Thes. 5. 22, the Apostle wils
us to abstaine from all appearance of evill:
whereof this surely is one.
            The second hazard is of Infection;
such beeing both the corruption of our
nature, and the nature of our corruption,
that, if the good and bad meet, the
good is rather soiled by the bad, than
the bad any way bettered by the good.
It is written of Mezentius the tyrant,

                  Corpora corporibus iungebat mortua
vivis:
            
            Hee bound the dead and the living
together; but the dead did not revive
by the living: the living rather putrefied
by reason of the dead. The fresh waters,
running into the Sea, do not sweeten
it, but are made brackish by it. It is
but madnes for a man to presume upon
an Antidote in going to the Pest-house,
when hee may keep himselfe from it.
It is indeed the property of oyle, beeing
poured into other liquors, to swim
on the top, and keep it selfe unmixed;
and of the Salamander, to ly in the fire
and not bee burnt: but, this quality is
rare. Even in Paradise, the woman,
whom God himselfe gave to the man,
beeing infected by the Serpent, infects
the man, and that at the first assault: and
shall any man, now beeing shut out of
Pardiase, and stript of those supernaturall
helps and graces wherewith Adam
was invested, think himselfe more able
to resist, than hee? No, no: Evill words
corrupt good manners; much more a continuall

evill conversation. Reiterated
importunity will at length make a
breach upon the soule, though in our
judgement never so throughly fensed:
as the long playing of the Cannon batters
the wall, and a continuall dropping
pearceth the stone. Samson held
out long against Dalilah; so did Salomon
against his outlandish wives: but, in
the end, neither the wisedome of the
one, nor the strength of the other, could
priviledge or secure them; the grace
of Perseverance (as his Majesty well
inferres thereupon) not being a Flower
that growes in our garden.
            The third hazard is of Malediction
from God. For, as the blessing of God
fals upon a whole society or familie
many times for one mans sake; as it did
upon all that sailed with Paul for his
sake, and for Iosephs sake upon 
                  
                     •
                  otiphar
and his house: so the plague and curse
of God sometimes pursues a whole
company for one mans offense; as it did
all that sailed with Ionas for his rebellion,
and the whole host of the Israelites

for Achans theft. S. Iohn would not
abide under the same roofe with Ebion
and Cerinthus, for feare it should fall
down about their ears. And, touching
Babylon, hee heard a voice; Goe out of
her, my people, that yee bee not partakers of
her sinnes, and that yee receive not of her
plagues, Revel. 18. 4: Like that of Moses
to the Israelites, in the sixteenth of Nū
                  bers,
verse 26, Depart, I pray you, from the
tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing
of theirs, lest yee perish in all their sins. Neither
is it injustice in God, if wee incourage
or countenance sinners with our
presence or approbation (though wee
partake not with them in their sinnes)
to wrap us in the same vengeance.
         
         
            
            Verse 5.
Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour,
him will I cut off: him that hath an high look
and a proud heart, will I not suffer.
            OVr Prophet having, in the la
                  •
               er
part of the verse going before,
professed in generall, that hee would
not kn
                     •
                  we a wicked person, that is, entertaine
him in his family &amp; service, much
less admit him unto his familiaritie and
friendship; he comes in this verse, and
in the seaventh, to shewe in particular,
what wickednes it is hee meanes, and
specifies foure kindes; Slander, Pride,
Deceit, Lies: Slander and Pride, in this
verse; Deceit and Lies, in the seaventh.
To these foure severall vices, he threatens
foure several censures: to the first,
cutting off; to the second, not suffering;
to the thi
                  •
               d, not dwelling within his house;
and to the fourth, not tarryi
                     •
                  g in his sight.
The first and worst vice is Slander, and
with it is joyned the greatest punishment;

destroying, or cutting off. First
then, of the vice, which is bad enough
in it selfe; but is heere aggravated by
two circumstances, the A
                     •
                  iunct and
the Subiect: the one as an Vsher makes
way for it; and the other as an attendant,
beares up the traine. Slander is a
Divelish Sinne, but privie slander makes
it worse, and privie slander of a mans
neighbour (that is, as I take it, of a pretended
friend) worst of all. And the
more neerely it touches him in his liberty
or his life, in his goods or his
good name: the greater the person is
to whom it is brought, and upon whō
it is cast: and the more confidently it
is affirmed; the more damnable it is. I
will begin with the naked vice it selfe,
stript out of the Circumstances.
            Slaunder is a vice of the tongue,
which is but a little member; yet is it
(as Aesop truely said) the best or worst
meate that comes to the market: being
well or ill used, it becomes the instrument
of great good or much mischief.
Being used to the glory of God, and

the edification of our neighbour, it is
the crowne and glory of a man; as our
Prophet calles it, Psal. 30. 12; To the
end my glory may sing praise to thee, and
not bee silent, that is, my tongue. But on
the other side, being abused to the dishonour
of God, or the hurt of our
neighbour, it defileth the whole body,
and setteth on fire the course of Nature.
This made our Prophet to pray,
in one place, Set a vvatch O Lord, before
my mouth, keep the doore of my lippes,
Psal. 141. 3. And to promise in another,
I will keep my mouth with a bridle, or with
a muzzell; I will take heed to my waies▪ that
I sinne not with my tongue, Psal. 39. 1.
Which one lesson Pambus a famous
professour in the Primitive Church,
plying hard nineteen whole yeares together▪
(as himselfe witnesseth in the
fourth booke and eighteenth chapter
of Socrates Ecclesiasticall story) yet could
hee not learne it so perfectly as to take
forth a new: which the Author imputeth
not so much to the dulnesse of the
scholler, as to the difficulty of the lesson,

in as much as if there be any man
that offends not in word, the same is a
perfect man, and able to bridle the
whole bodie. For every kind of beasts, &amp;

an unruly evil ful of deadly poyson, Iam. 3.
            The vices of this member are, Blaspheming,
Swearing▪ Cursing, Dissembling,
Reviling, and those two named heer in
my Psalme, Slandering, and Lying: but
of the two, Slander named in my Text,
is the worse, in as much as it includes
a Lie; it is a lie cum additamento▪
                a lie
and somewhat else. And againe, a lie
though it be in it selfe alwayes naught,
yet doth it not alwayes tend to harme,
but slander doth; it being as the School
hath rightly defined it, denigratio alienae
famae, the smutting of a mans good
name. As flatterie daubs white upon
black, so slander sprinkles black upon
white; it is a false report (whether it be
by speaking, or by writing and libelling)
wounding a man in his good name:

false, either by denying, disguising, lesning,
concealing, misconstruing things
of good report; or else, in forging, increasing,
aggravating, or uncharitable
spreading things of bad report; which
though they bee true, yet if I spread
them, not knowing them to be true, to
mee tis sinne: nay, though I knowe
them to be true, and blase them abroad
not for any loue to the truth, nor for
respect to justice, nor for the bettering
of the hearer, or the delinquent, but
onely to disgrace the one and incense
the other, I cannot avoide the imputation
of a slanderer.
            Secondly, it is said to be a wounding
instrument, and that justly; 
                  •
               t being compared
by our Prophet sometimes to
keene and cutting razors, sometime to
sharp and pearcing arrowes, sometime
to naked drawen swords, sometime to
the poyson of Asps and Adde
                  •
               s, sometime
to speares and the teeth of wilde

                     •
                  e, 5. 21. And yet none of these
commonly make such a wound, but a
cunning Surgeon will cure them without
any great signe: whereas the rule
of the Slaunderer is, Calumniare a
                     •
                  dacter,
semper aliquid h
                     •
                  ret, Lay on loade
boldly, somwhat will alwaies stick by
it: Many that heard the slander, shall
never heare the truth; all men by their

                  •
               aturall corruption, being more apt
both to beleeve, and to publish the one
than the other. The stroke of the rod
maketh marks in the flesh, Ecclus. 28. 17,
but the stroke of the tongue breaketh
the bones.
            Besides, those other instruments
wound cōmonly but one at one stroke,
whereas a slanderous tongue strikes &amp;
wounds no lesse than three at a blowe.
The first and worst blow, hee gives his
owne soule, infecting it with slander,
and making his conscience guilty of a
lie. The second lights on the soule of
him, to whom he brings the false tales;
for as wee shall hereafter heare, the
plausible and willing hearer, is as farre

forth lyable to censure, as the 
                  •
               ale-bearer.
The third and last stroke, lights on
the reputation of the party slandered:
which though it bee of the three the
least; yet is it a very grievo
                  •
               s wound,
and the third part of my definition, tis
a false report, wounding a man in his
good name.
            
            The Latines call it Detractio, because
it is a kinde of theft, in that it
stealeth from a mans good name; in
in which sense our Saviour may bee
thought to have called them theeves,
whom he whipped out of the Temple;
because by their buying and selling in
it, they robbed God of his honour,
profaning the place consecrated to
his worship. As then the Sl
                  •
               nderer is a
murtherer, by wounding a man in his
reputation; so is he a theefe in stealing
from his good name: nay, theft it is in
the highest degree, and a degree beyond
the highest kinde of theft, properly
so called▪ and therein I affirme
no more, than the Prince of Schoolemen
hath done before me. Vitium detractionis

suo gravius est quam 
                     •
                  urtum: and
his reason is; first, because restitution
may more easily bee made of goods
than of good name: which, being once
lost, for the most part is unrecoverable.
Secondly, because a good name is dearer
to a man of understanding, than
his goods; in as much as it hath a nearer
affinitie with our spirituall good:
And a good name (saith Salomon▪ Prov.
22. 1.) is rather to bee chosen than great riches,
being better than precious oyntment,

Eastern parts they were laid up among

Kings Treasurie, as appeares Esa. 39. 2,

               med;
not onely for civill use in anoynting
their faces and bodies, as well living as
dead; but for sacred use in anoynting
their Kings, Priests, and Prophets. And
this oyntment is it, which in the 30. of
Exodus is called the holy anoynting

oyle, compounded of oyle olive, and
Myrrh, and Cinnamon, and Calamus,
and Cassia, after the art of the Apothecary
or the Perfumer: and whosoever
compounded any like to it, or
put any of it upon a stranger, by Gods
ordinance hee was to bee cut off from
his people. Even before this rare and
costly oyntment, doth Salomon prefer
a good report; and not without cause,
since the one cannot keepe the body
from putrefying, as the other doth the
memory from rotting. Well then, by
how much more excellent and divine
a good name is, by so much more dā
               nable
and pestilent is this vice of detraction.
            The Proverb is, Oculus &amp; fama non
patiuntur iocos, There is no good sporting
with the eye, or with a mans good
name; the least aspersion cannot but
be offensive to either: and a wise man
is as tender &amp; sensible of the least touch
upon the one as the other. He was no
foole, at least in morall matters, who
hath tolde us, that Negligere quid de se

quisque sentiat, non solum arrogantis est
sed &amp; dissoluti, To be careless what men
thinke or speake of him, is the part not
onely of a proud but of a loose minde.
And hee was no foole either in morall
or spirituall, who exhorts us, Whatsoever
things are of goodreport, if there
be any vertue, any praise, to thinke on
those things, Phil. 4. 8. Whereof Saint
Augustine yeelds the reason, Propter

                     •
                  os conscientia nostra sufficit nobis, propter
vos fama nostra non pollui, sed pollere debet
in vobis. In regard of a mans owne self
the keeping of a good conscience is
sufficient, if he be clear to God-ward:
but in regard of doing good to men,
specially in publique places, a good reputation
is no lesse necessary: which
hee that by slander takes away, not only
wrongs him from whom he takes it,
but others with whom hee communicates
in vertue, and to whom he might
prove beneficiall; whereas standing
in their opinion guilty of that whereof
he is accused, though wrongfully, neither
his speeches nor his actions can be

so acceptable; and consequently, not
so profitable unto them, as otherwise
they might bee. To which purpose is
that of Thomas, Auferre alicui famam
valde grave est, per cuius defectum impeditur
homo à multis bene agendis. And likewise,
that forenamed good Doctour &amp;
Pillar of the Christian Church, duely
weighing these dangerous effects, caused
these two verses (as Possidius reports
it in his life) to bee written in capitall
Letters over the Table where hee took
his ordinary repast;

                  Quisquis amat dictis absen
                        •
                     ûm rodere
vitam,
                  Hanc mensam vetitam no verit esse sibi.
               
            
            Hee that loves to detract from such
as are absent, let him knowe, that his
presence at this table is not desired.
            Another thing, which much aggravates
this vice and the foulenesse of it,
is, that the Divell hath his name from
slandering, and a nature nothing dissenting
from his name: hee slanders God
to man, and man againe to God, as his
instruments doo man to man. God hee

accuseth of envy to man, Gen. 3. 5, God
doth knowe, that in the day yee eat thereof,
your eyes shall bee opened, and yee shall bee as
Gods, knowing good and evill. And as hee
accuseth God, to man, of envy: so doth
hee man, to God, of hypocrisie; Doth
Iob serve God for nought? hast thou not
made an hedge about him, &amp; about his house,
and about all that hee hath on every side?
thou hast blessed the works of his hands, and
his substance is increased in the land: but,
put 
                     •
                  orth thine hand now, and touch all that
hee hath, and hee will curse thee to thy face.
            
            The Herbalists write of a certaine
Plant, which they call Divels-bit; so
named (as they say) because, beeing of
soveraign use for mankinde, the Divell
is thought (by simple people) of malice
to bite off the root of it, which is found
very small, or none at all. Now, the
root of the union betwixt God &amp; man,
is the love of God to man, and the duty
of man back again to God: and this
root I am sure wee may truely call Divels-bit;
not that he can ever bite it off,
but because hee never leaves nibbling

at it. This is hee that stands before the
woman, Rev. 12, clothed with the Sun,
and the Moon under her feet, and upon
her head a Crown of 
                  •

now ready to bee delivered of her
childe, and hee as ready to devo
                  •
               re it
beeing delivered. His endeavour is,
either by temptation to make a good
purpose abortive, and to sti
                  •
               le it in the
womb or birth, if hee may: or if not
that, by slander to deuoure it beeing
brought into the light. Let the slanderer
then remember, as often as hee opens
his mouth to that end, whether it
bee simply to disgrace another, or by
his disgrace the more to commend and
justifie himselfe; that, as it is a divine
property, To cover sin, where is hope
of amendment, with the mantle of charity:
so, To fain a fault where it is not,
or to amplifie and extend it beyond
truth where it is, is a divelish condition:
yet that which makes it worse, is, the
dooing of it in secret, Whoso privily
slandereth his neighbour.
            This is the Adiunct that go
                  •
               th before

it, the Vsher that makes way for it:
which notwithstanding is so inwardly
essentiall unto the nature of it, that som
put it in the very definition, as a masterpeece;
making open false accusation
(whether in judgement or otherwise)
to bee Calumnie or Sycophancy; but secret,
Obloquie or Detraction: the ground
of the former being commonly anger
or revenge, hope of reward or favour;
but of the later, Emulation or Envy,
which is nothing else but an overgrown
and inveterate anger.
            
            And in regard of this quality of seeking
corners, it may well bee ranged among
the workes of darknes; and the
slanderer himselfe, among those creatures
which delight in darknes. With
the Mole, hee alwaies workes under
ground; and, with the Owle, he shuns
the light: in which regard, in our Language
is it cald back-biting, in as much
as the Author of it loves not to stand to
it, or to be brought in question for the
avouching of it; but, like a coward, not
daring to look a man in the face, nor to

give him time to draw in his defence,
hee assaults him behinde at unawares,
and thrusts him through: like a dog, he
bites a man by the shinnes, before hee
bark; and hurts, before his malice bee
espied: as some kindes of lightning
melt the blade in the scabberd, it remaining
sound and entire.
            These secret whisperings (as the Apostle
cals them, Rom. 1. 29, and sets them
downe as one of the marks of a reprobate
minde) like the winde, which
creeps-in by the chinks and crevises in
a wall, or the cracks in a window, prove
cōmonly more dangerous than a storm
that meets a man in the face upon the
Champain. And the saying is, Avento
percolato &amp; inimico reconciliato libera nos,
Domine; from such kind of whisperers,
good Lord, deliver us: which are so neer
of kinne to backbiters, that, in the place
before alleaged out of the Romans, they
are set immediately before them; and,
in the 2. Cor. 12. 20, immediately after
them. Yet Calvin, therein following
Thomas, puts this distinction betweene

them, that the Backbiter intends the
impeachment of a mans good name,
but the whisperer breach of friendship,
Obloquutor intendit infamiam, susurr
                     •
                  
discordiam: which is the worse of the
two, in as much as friendship as farre
exceeds reputation, as reputation doth
riches; reputation beeing referred to
friendship, as riches is to reputation.
            
               There be six things (saith Salomon, Pro.
6. 16.) which the Lord hates, yea seven are
an abomination vnto him; among which
the last and worst is, He that soweth discord.
I will shut up this point with the
exhortation of the Apostle Rom. 16. 17,
Now I beseech you brethren marke them
which cause divisions, specially by these
kindes of slanderous whisperings, contrary
to the doctrine which ye have learned,
and avoid them.
            
            The second thing, which in my text
aggravates this offence, is the person
offended, a mans neighbour: Hee that
privily slandereth his Neighbour. In the
largest sense, Proximus tuus est qui tecum

natus est ex Adams &amp; Eva, saith Augustine,
Hee is thy neighbour, who is
borne of the same race with thee of Adam
and Eve. Thus is it taken in the
ninth and tenth Cōmandements, Thou
shalt not bear false witnesse against thy neighbour:
Thou shalt not coet thy neighbours
house. And by our Saviour in the tenth
of Saint Lukes Gospel. And I deny not,
but it may thus be understood, and be
as generally extended heer in my text:
Yet because our Prophet heer chiefly
intended the ordering of his houshold,
I thinke this word is heer to be contracted
to such as dwell together under
the same roofe, and converse together
in the same family: which is favoured
by Montanus his Translation, Obloquentem
socio suo, him that slaundereth his
fellow.
            
            It is a bad bird, they say, that defiles
his owne neast: and surely it is a signe
of little grace, when a man slaunders
those that should bee nearest and dearest
unto him; when Cham uncovers
his fathers shame; when Siba by presents

and false suggestions obtaines his
Masters inheritance, 2. Sam. 16; when
the Mistris of the house by slander &amp;
wrongfull accusation shall cause her
servant, her faithfull servant Ioseph, to
be cast into prison. It was the blow of
Bru
                     •
                  us that struck deepest into Caesar;
&amp; tis the slander of a pretended friend
that gives the most dangerous wound.
            
               Such are excellently described by
Bernard, in his 24. Sermon upon the
Cantitles, Detractores autem quodam simulatae
verecundiae fuco, &amp;c. The Slanderers,
under the colour of feined modestie, labour
to shadowe that malice which they cannot
keepe in: you shall see them send forth deep
sighes; and with a kinde of gravitie and
slaiedness, with a sadde look and whining
voyce, to poure forth their slander: which
passeth by so much the more plausibly, as it
is thought by those that heare it, to proceed
not from any 
                  •
               nvious, but a condoling affection.
I am very sorry (saith hee) for
him, because I love him, and have often admonished
him thereof, but could never reclaime
him: the thing was knowne unto me

before, but it should never have been published
by mee; yet now that it is blowen abroad
by others, I cannot denie the truth, indeede
it is so. Hitherto Bernard. And who
would thinke that a contemplative Abbot,
living within the cloisters of a Monastery,
shold be so perfect in the tricks
of the Court? And so I come from
the vice to the Censure, from the slanderers
cutting &amp; wounding of others,
to the cutting of him off; Him that privily
slandereth his neigbour, him will
I destroy, or cut off.
            He promiseth of other offences, he
would not suffer them, they should not
dwell within his house, or tarry in his sight;
but of this, like a rotten incurable mē
               ber
when no other remedie will serve
the turne, off they must. Hee would not
himselfe raise slanders upon innocents,
that hee might enter upon their possessions,
and then cut them off; as Iezabel
dealt with Naboth: but hee would rather
right the innocent, by cutting off
the slanderer.
            Now, a double kinde of cutting off
               
there is; either from favour, or friendship
or service, &amp; thats for private persons:
or from the participation of religious
exercises with the Church: and
thats for the Magistrate Ecclesiastical;
or from liberty, by banishment; or lastly,
if the case so require, from life it
selfe, by inflicting of death; and thats
for the Civill Magistrate: and this case
in the Leviticall Law was onely when
the slander reached to the life of him,
upon whō it was raysed, Deut. 19. 19. He
that testifies falsely against his brother, yee
shall doe to him as hee thougth to have done
to his brother: eye for eye, tooth for tooth,
hand for hand, life for life. But for private
men, all the cutting off they can use, is
the shutting of their doores, and the
stopping of their cares against them;
making demonstration, by speech or
countenance, of distasting their base
practice; according to that wholesom
advice of the Apostle, Ephes. 5. 11, Have
no fellowship with the unfruitfull vvorks of
darkness, but rather reproove them. And
surely all honest men have reason to do

it, not onely in that they have reason
to conceive, that he who brings a slander
upon another to them, will bee as
readie upon occasion to carry a slander
upon them to another; but withall because
Salomon tels vs, that the wicked
giveth heed to false lippes, and a lyer hearkeneth
to a naughty tongue, Prov. 17. 4. It
it a shrewd signe that a man is that way
disposed himselfe, when he giveth way
to others without any checke or controule.
And besides, it is a conclusion agreed
upon by the best Divines, Audiens
detrahentem cui possit resistere, sed ei
placet detractio, eiusdem detractionis reus
est: Hee that heareth the slaunderer
quietly whē he may resist him, so as the
slander seemeth to please him, he is becomne
guilty of the same offence.
Wherewith that of Bernard in his second
booke de Consideratione ad Eugenium
accords, Detrabere aut detrahentem
audire quid horum damnabilius sit non facile
dixerim: To de
                  •
               ract, or to listen to the
detraction, which of these two is the
worse I cannot easily define: the one

having, as he addeth, the Divell in his
tongue; the other in his eare. And of
Isidore, in his third booke de Summo bono,
Non solum ille reus est, qui falsum de
alio profert, sed &amp; is qui citò aurem criminibus
praebet: Hee is not onely guilty,
that raises a false report of another, but
hee also who readily listens thereunto.
The ground heerof is taken from the
last verse of the first to the Romans,
Not onely they which commit such
things are worthy of death, but they
also that consent vnto them that doe
them. Now consent is either indirect,
when a man resists it not being in his
power; or direct, in advising or inticing
to the dooing of it, or in abetting
of it, or delighting in it beeing
done.
            It is the Receiuer that makes the
theefe, and a smiling countenance and
open eare that makes and maintaines
a Slanderer: Whereas on the other
side, As the North winde driveth away the
raine; so doth a frowning looke the slanderous
tongue, Pro. 25. 23. It is like the casting

of a dart, or the shooting of an
arrow against a flint, or peece of brass,
it reflectenth back againe upon the face
of the shooter. Et discit non libenter dicere,
quod videt non libenter audiri; Hee
learnes not to speake that willingly,
which hee findes to bee unwillingly
heard. Therefore it is that our Prophet
ioynes both together, Psal. 15. Who
shall abide in thy tabernacle, or who
shall dwell in thy holy hill? Hee that
backbiteth not with his tongue, nor receiueth
a false report against his neighbour: And
so doth the Poet:

                  —Absente
                        •
                      qui rodit amicum,
                  Qui non defendi
                        •
                      alio culpante.
               
            
            They both are guilty of

                  Denigratio alienae famae.
                  Hic niger est, hunc tu Romanc cavet
                        •
                     .
               
            
            Thus farre a Magistrate may &amp; must
goe with private men: but hee must
not stand heer, hee must proceed one
step further, and that is to punishment.
It was none of the worst sayings of Domitian,
though himselfe none of the
best Emperours, Princeps qui delatores

non castigat, irritat: His meaning I take
to bee, not so much of lawfull informers,
as wrongfull accusers: For, righteous
lips are the delight of Kings, and they
love him that speaketh right. Prov. 16. 13.
Though they bee the chiefe of men,
yet men they are: and having their persons
confined to places, they cannot
see and heare all things themselves.
Many things they must of necessity see
by other mens eyes, and heare by other
mens eares: Yet requisite it is, that
such as they either imploy, or permit
to be their eyes or ears, should be men
of knowen trust and tryed faithfulness;
&amp; even then too, are they to keep one
eare open for the defence of the party
accused.
            Qui statuit aliquid parte inauditâ alterâ,
            Aequum licet statuerit, haud aquus fuit.
            As it is true, Si sufficiat negasse, nemo
erit nocens, If a bare deniall were sufficient,
no man would bee guilty: So is
it as true, Si sufficiat accusasse nemo erit innocens,
If a bare accusation were sufficient,
no man should be innocent. A naked

information, or that which the
Lawyers cal Clamorosa insinuatio, a common
fame, is enough to give iust occasion
to a farther inquiry: but not to
a finall Sentence.
            
               Descendam &amp; videbo, I will goe
downe and see, saith God himselfe, of
Sodome it selfe, whether they have done
altogether according to the cry which
is comn unto me. The phrase of descending
to see, is not so proper to
God, whose eye pearceth thorough
the bowels of all things, as it is a kind
of descending to our capacities, and
for our instruction, specially his deputies
and vicegerents on earth; who except
somtimes they descend from their
majesty &amp; throne of State, to a familiar
search of truth, themselves will often
be carried on the wrong side, &amp; wrong
others.
            I conclude what I have to say at
this time, with the grave and wise exhortation
of the Apostle, Galat. 5. 15.
If yee bite and devour one another, take
heed yee be not consumed one of another; I

take him specially to be understood of
byting by a slaunderous tongue; of
which our Propher heer, Hee that privily
slandereth his neighbour, him will I
cut off.
            
         
         
            
            Him that hath an high look and a proud
heart, will I not suffer.
            AFter Slander, our Prophet rankes
Pride in the next place: and sure
they are so neer of kin, that hee could
not well set them far asunder; Pride being
commonly both the mother and
the nurse of Slander. For, when wee
have once a good conceit of our selves,
we are apt for the slandering of others,
that thereby either our vices may in
some sort bee justified, or our vertues
shine the clearer. I deny not, but Slander
(as you have heard it proved in opening
the former part of this verse)
sometimes ariseth out of malice, and
seeking revenge, or breach of friendship;
sometimes out of covetousnes, in
seeking to gain by it; sometimes out of
ambition, in seeking to rise by it; but,
more often out of pride, in seeking credit
to our selves, either by forging false
reports, or by inlarging true, tending to
the discredit of others. Hence is it, that

the Apostle, in 2. Cor. 12. 20, sets swellings
next to whisperings; the one beeing
a branch of Pride, as the other is of
Slander. And Salomon, in the sixt of the
Proverbs, ver. 17, couples together hauty
eyes and a lying tongue; they being
the two first of those seaven which the
Lord hates, and his soule abhors: nay,
our Prophet himself joyns them in one
verse, Psa. 40. 5, Blessed is the man that hath
set his hope in the Lord, and turned not to
the proud, and such as goe about with lies:
insinuating, it may bee, that the slanderer,
who goeth about with lies, as a pedler
with his pack, is as the broker; and
the proud man, as the marchant or
chapman to whom he vents his wares:
for, as the slanderer is as ready to receive
lies, as to coine them; so is the
proud man as ready to receive slāders,
as to raise them.
            The way, then, to purge the tongue
from Slander, is, to keep the heart from
Pride: and the best means to free a family
from the one, is, to rid it of the other.
Therefore, our Prophet having

promised, in the former part of this
verse, to cut off him that privily slandereth
his neighbour; heer hee voweth,
not to suffer him that hath an high look
and proud heart; or, as some Translations,
have it, a proud looke and a high
heart. Elatumoculis &amp; latum pectore, saieth
Musculus: vastum corde, or turgid
                     •
                  
corde, saith Arias Montanus: tumentem anime,
saith Iunius. The phrases are somwhat
different, but they all aime at the
same mark, and are all sufficiently warrantable
by the Originall. Wee are,
then, in the first place to consider of
the vice heer censured; It is Pride, both
outward in the look, and inward in the
heart. Secondly, of the censure opposed
unto it; It is▪ 
               not suffering: so insufferable
a vice it is. Him that hath an high
look and proud heart, will I not suffer.
            
            Had our Prophet said, I will not suffer
a proud heart; the question might
have been, How wee should come to
knowe it: hee therefore, to 
                  •
               ase us of
that doubt, takes the right way to discover
it by an high look; God having

so both ordained and ordered it, that
our secret thoughts and hidden affections
should be manifested to the world
by outward acts. What man knoweth the
things of man, save the spirit of man which
is in him? saith the Apostle, 1. Cor. 2. 11.
But, there hee speaks of a direct and immediate,
of a primary and infallible
knowledge, which is proper to God,
and God alone; in as much as hee it is,
and hee alone that searcheth the heart,
and trieth the reins, Ier. 17. 10. No man,
no divell, no Angell, no created substance,
can possibly attaine to that, except
it be by divine dispensation, by revelation
supernaturall. The ordinary
knowledge then which we have of the
heart, is gathered by discourse of reason,
by observation of marks &amp; effects;
as the physician ghesseth of the disease,
by the Symptomes. We judge of the
weather, by the face of the sky; of the
motions of the wheels of a clocke or a
watch, by the pointing of the Index:
wee judge of the motion of the Sunne,
by the progress of the shadow in the

diall: wee judge of the motion of the
heart, by the beating of the pulse: wee
judge of the fountaine, by the streame
which issues from it: and, lastly, wee
judge of the depth of the foundation,
by the height of the building which is
raised upon it: and as justly may wee
gather the pride of the heart from an
high look. Iudge not, lest yee bee iudged,
saith our Saviour, Mat. 7. 1. And his Apostle,
Iudge nothing before the time untill
the Lord come, who will lighten things that
are hid in darknes, and make the counsels of
the heart manifest, 1. Cor. 4. 5. But they
both speak of an uncharitable, unadvised
peremptory and finall judgement;
not so much touching the present disposition
of men what they are, as their
future state what they shall bee.
            This then notwithstanding, as wee
lawfully may and usually doo judge of
the passions of the minde (of feare, of
hope, of griefe, of joy, of hatred, of
love, of anger, of jealousie) by outward
signes: so may wee as lawfully judge of
the vertues or vices of the soul by outward

effects; as it were of the goodnes
of the tree by the fruits, or of the value
of coin by the stamp set upon it. And
more safe it is to judge of vices than of
vertues; in as much as few are so desperately
wicked, but they desire at least
to appear good. Vertue may be counterfeit,
and that so cunningly, as the imitation
shall seem to exceed the copy;
the counterfeit, the truth: but yet
I think was never man so madde as to
counterfeit a vice; wee labour rather
by all means to conceal it: yet we cannot
do it so cunningly, but that it shews
it self at times, as it were in a glasse, either
in our speech, or in our apparell,
or in our gait, or in our countenance,
or in our actions, or in all. And doubtlesse
the wise observation of these, is
beyond all the rules that either judiciary
Astrology by casting nativities, or
Physiognomy by inspection of faces,
or Chyromancy by behoulding the
lines of the hand, can afford. Of these
then it may bee truely said,
Qui bene conijciet, vates hic optimus esto.
            
            
               But, amongst all vices, there is none
(onely drunkenness excepted) that discovers
it self sooner than pride. For the
speech, wee read of a bragging &amp; boasting
mouth, a mouth of pride, Iude ve.
16: for the gait, wee read of a foot of
pride, Psal. 36. 11: for apparell, of a
crown of pride, Esay 28. 1; of a chaine
of pride, Psal. 73. 6. So that pride in the
heart can no more hide it self, than fire
that lies in the bosome, or oyle that is
wrung in the fist. Many that know not
the man, yet point at him as hee walkes
the streets, and say, There goes a proud
fellow: which, men usually pronounce
of no vice beside, but the drunkeard;
because these two chiefely bewray
themselves: and therfore doth the prophet
Habbacuc join them both together,
2. verse 5.
            When a man shall see a cloak imbrodered
over with woods, and parks, and
Lordships, and lined within with obligations,
and bands, and statutes; may
wee not justly say, that such a man is so
farre from cloaking his pride, that hee

proclaims it in his cloak? It was said of
old, that soft raiment was the weare in
Kings Courts; whereas, now a-daies, it
is so bedaubed with gold and silver, so
loaden with pearle and pretious stone,
as it is hard to judge, whether it more
burden their bodies, or lighten their
purses. The Poet could say of the women
of his time;
Matrona incedit census induta nepotum.
            
            And another:
—Pars minima est ipsa puella sui.
            
            But, what would they say? or, rather,
what would they not say, if they lived
in these our daies, and saw that we see;
when, for apparell, a man can see little
or no difference betwixt the Lord and
the Tenant, the Master &amp; the Servant,
the Prince and the Subject?
            But, what a marvellous thing, yea
what a madnes is it, To see a man, created
according to the image of God, &amp;
Lord of all the visible workes of his
hands, to growe proud upon the furres
of beasts; upon silkes, the excrements
of worms; upon gemmes, or gold, or

silver, somewhat better concocted and
finer part of the earth; or, as the Prophet
cals it, thick clay? Hab. 2. 6. Yea,
to growe proud of that which hee carrieth
about him, as a prisoner doth his
manacles or fetters, in token of his offence;
our raiment beeing both the effect
and the badge of the fal of our first
parents, and of our fall in them. Had
they stood in their first integrity, and
wee in them, we should no more have
been ashamed of our nakednes in our
age, than in our infancy: wheras now,
beeing disrobed of originall justice, we
are driven to seek these coverings, partly
for defence, and partly for hiding
our shame.
            If the clothing of Salomon in his royalty
(who had the rarities of the known
world at his command) were inferiour
to that of the Lilly; why should wee
think the better of our selves for a gay
coat, or a quaint fashion, or a fringed
rose, or a fine feather? All that we can
get by it, is this, that in covering our
bodies, wee discover to the world the

humour of our mindes: by proud apparell
wee disclose a proud heart, but
yet more by a proud looke; and therefore
sayes our Prophet, Him that an
high looke and proud heart.
            As we finde a man in what Inne hee
is lodged by the signe: so wee knowe
whether pride have taken up her lodging
in the heart, by the signe of the
looke. As a wanton looke is a signe of
a lustfull heart, and a sober looke of a
chaste heart, and a sad looke of a heauy
heart, and a cheerfull looke of a merry
heart, and a modest looke of an humble
heart: so is an high looke of a proud
heart. By this, as one truely sayes, a
proud heart is traced unto, as a Deere
or Hare are traced to the place where
they be, by their footing.
            A difference I finde in holy Scripture
betwixt Oculus elevatus, and elatus
oculis: the one implies a looke lifted
up to God; the other, lifted up above
our brethren. The former our Prophet
professes Psal. 121. I vvill lift up mine
eyes unto the mountaines, from vvhence

mine helpe shall come: and our Saviour
practised it, Iohn 11. 41. Iesus lift up his
eyes &amp; said, father I thank thee, because thou
hast heard mee: and so did Stephen, Acts
7. 55. Being full of the holy Ghost, hee looked
stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory
of God, and Iesus standing at the right hand
of God. Now, this kinde of lifting up
the looke, in as much as it serves or
helps to lift up the soule, either in an
holy confidence, or heavenly, contemplation,
or both; is not onely lawfull
but commendable, and tis a token of a
lowly minde. But this high supercilious
looke, this lifting up of the eyes
heer spoken of, is when a man beholds
those that are under him with a scorfull
and disdaining countenance; like
one that lookes downe from an
high Tower, to whom, men walking
under, seeme to be but crowes in comparison
of himselfe: and this elatus oculis
is that doth manifest la
                     •
                  um corde;
and therefore doth our Prophet joyne
them both together: againe, Psal. 131. 1.
Lord I am not high minded. But how

doth that appeare? I have no proud looks;
and so doth Salomon, Pro. 21. 4. An hauty
looke and proud heart, which is the light
of the wicked, is sinne. When a man by
facing, and strouting, and bearing his
head aloft, would have all men that
see him take notice of his noble descent,
of his honourable place, of his
great estate, of his comly personage,
or some singular quality, or admirable
excellency that is in him, or hee thinks
to be in himselfe; his hauty looke is an
evident signe, an argument infallible of
his proud heart: and heerein is the
looke more offensive than the heart; in
that, though the pride of the heart bee
more odious to God, yet is the hautinesse
of the looke more scandalous to
men. Nay, in the 6. of Prov. It is one
&amp; the first of those six &amp; seaven things
which God hateth, and his soule abhorreth;
&amp; therefore will he also with
such severity punish it, as he threatneth
by his Prophet, The high looke of man shal
be humbled, and the loftinesse of men shall
be abased, and the Lord alone shall be exalted

in that day, Esa. 2. 11.
            Thus much of outward pride, specially
in the looke, and the discovering
of the pride of the heart by it: we
now come to the proud heart it selfe,
the true cause and fountaine of all outward
pride; and howsoever outward
pride cannot be without this, yet this
may bee, and sometimes is without it.
            
               An high looke and proud heart will I not
suffer. By some it is rendred, Latum
corde, a large heart. Now, the heart
may be enlarged, either by knowledge
as Salomons was: God gave him wisedom
and understanding exceeding much, &amp; latitudem
cordis, and a large heart, even as
the sand upon the Sea shore. 1. King. 4. 29.
Or by sanctifying grace, whereof our
Prophet, Psal. 119. 32. I will run the way
of thy Commandements, when thou shalt
have enlarged my heart: or by covetousnesse,
whence some render it, Insatisbili
corde; or by joy, for as sadnesse contracts
and drawes it together, so joy
dilates and enlarges it: or lastly, by
pride, not containing it selfe within its

owne bounds; but swelling like the
Sea, and being puft up like the stomack
that is filled with winde. And as the
swelling of the spleene is very dangerous
for impairing the health &amp; strēgth
of the bodie, and of the sailes for the
overbearing of a little vessell: so this
swelling of the heart is, of all spirituall
diseases, the most dāgerous to the soule;
whether it arise from the gift of temporall
blessings, of riches, of beauty,
of birth, of power, of eloquence, of
knowledge; or from an opinion that we
have those vertues in us, which indeed
wee have not; or that we have them in
a greater measure and perfection, than
indeed we have; or that we have them
from our selves and our owne industry,
not from God: or that we have obtained
them from God, but by our owne
merit: or lastly, that by reason of them
wee over-value our selves, and despise
others.
            And herein lies the great danger of
this vice, that it arises out of vertue it
selfe, though not of it selfe, but by reason

of our corruption; and by that
meanes, the Divell both staines the
worke, and steales away the reward.
It is impossible to have good parts and
not to know it: &amp; a very difficult thing it
is for a man to know so much touching
himself, &amp; not thereupon to be the better
opinioned of himselfe: with the very
increase of sanctification, if we take
not good heed this creeps-in; &amp; which
is strange, is noted to spring even out
of humility. A secret pride is sometimes
occasioned by not being proud:
and then is it more deformed, than if
it appeared in his own proper colours.
As Saint Hierome noted long since, Multo
deformior est superbia quae sub quibusdā
humilitatis signis latet: And as it occasionally
springs out of the life and
flower of vertue: so doth it out of the
ashes of dead vices, the carcases of
mortified sinnes; as wormes doe of rotten
timber.
            Cum bene pugnaris, cum cuncta subacta
putaris,
            Quae magis infestat vincenda superbia
restat.
            
               It is like the shirt, the first thing wee
put on when we come into the world,
and the last we put off when we go out
of the world. It runnes through all estates:
it infects the Artificer, the Soldier,
the Lawyer, the Citizen, the
Schollar, the Courtier, the Counseller,
and hath Vniversalem quandam influentiā
in omnia vitia, saith the School-man,
an universall kinde of influence
into all vices; in as much as it is an aversion
from God, which is the first
essentiall part of all vice. It infected the
Angels in heaven, unto whom that of
the Babylonian King is applyed by the
Antients, I will ascend into heaven, and
exalt my throne aboue the starres of God: I
will ascent above the height of the clowds,
Esay 14▪ 14. It infected our first parents
in Paradise. Primi hominis peccatum primum
superbia fuit, qua quoddam spirituale
bonum supra mensuram suae conditionis appetivit.
The first sinne of the first man,
was pride, by which hee longed for a
certaine spirituall good, above the
reach and capacity of his condition. It

is the conclusion of Aquinas, and seems
to answer rightly to the Serpents suggestion,
God doth know that when ye shall
eate thereof, yee shall bee as Gods, knowing
good and evill.
            
            Lastly, Pride, by Divines is ranged
among the seaven captaine or capitall
sinnes; so called, because from them
the rest stream, as from their wel-heads.
Nay, by Gregorie it is made the Queene
and Mistris of the capitall vices themselves.
Ipsa vitiorum Regina superbia,
saith hee, cum devictum plenè cor ceperit,
mox illud septem principalibus vitijs quasi
quibusdam suis ducibus devastandum tradit,
ex quibus vitiorum multitudines oriuntur:
Pride the Queen of vices, having
once taken full possession of the heart,
delivers it over to the seaven principall
sinnes, as it were to her chiefe Leaders,
by them to bee laide waste, and from
hence all the following troopes of enormities
ensue. And so I come from the
Vice to the Censure; Him that hath an
high looke and proud heart, I will not suffer:
or as some Translations have it, more

literally therein agreeing with the Originall,
Ipsum non potero, I cannot suffer.
            
            Now the reasons which chiefly moved
him not to suffer this vice, touched
him partly as hee was a reasonable
man, endued with intellectuall and morall
vertues; partly as hee was a member
of the Church, and the childe of God,
inspired with the spirit of God; partly
as hee was an housholder, the father of
children, the master of servants, the
head and governour of a family: and
lastly, in part as hee was a King the Soveraigne
of a populous and mighty nation.
            First, then as a reasonable man, hee
knew there was nothing in man, which
could in reason make him proud.
            Vnde superbit homo? cuius cōceptio turpis,
            Nasci poena, labor vita, necesse mori.
            Whence should a man grow proud?
whose conception is shamefull, his
birth painefull, his life toylsome, his
death necessary. The dayes of his pilgrimage
heere on earth are few and evill:

and yet even in those few, subject
he is to infinite infirmities in his body,
partly by casualties from without, and
partly, by diseases from within; to infinite
error &amp; ignorance in his mind, to
infinite perversnes &amp; distraction in his
wil: he comes whining into the world,
&amp; departs groaning out of it; he shooteth
forth as a flower and is cut downe,
he vanisheth as a shadow, &amp; continueth
not; his flesh is but as grasse, the winde
bloweth over it, and it is withered, and
the place therof shall know it no more;
his breath goeth forth, and hee returneth
to his earth, and then all his
thoughts perish.
            Secondly, as a member of the Church
and childe of God, hee had reason to oppose
pride. As a member of the Church, in
as much as schisms and heresies, sects &amp;
separations, which rent and molest the
Church, spring for the most part out
of a vain affectation of singularity: as
a member of the Church, hee knew that
man in his best estate was moulded out
of the dust of the earth; that after the

fall, his soule was spotted with the leprosie
of sinne; to which, by the daily
adding of infinite actual transgressions,
if God should enter into judgement
with him, hee were not able to answer
one for a thousand.
            Againe, as Gods deare childe, hee had
great reason to oppose against those,
who are of all the greatest Rebells against
God. The Prodigall is an enemy
directly to himselfe, indirectly to
God: the Covetous an enemie directly
to men, indirectly to God:
but the Proud is a direct enemie to
God himselfe. For whereas other sins
arise, some out of infirmitie, some out
of ignorance, some out of a desire of
profit, or pleasure, or honour, or ease,
or revenge; the proud man hath no
cause to be proud, but Pride it selfe,
which saith like Pharaoh, I will not Obey.
Superbia (saith Aquinas) habet aversionem

                     •
                   Deo, ex hoc ipso quod non vult
Deo &amp; eius regulae subijci: Pride hath an
aversion from God, even for this very
cause, because it will not be subject to

God and his law: and thereupon hee
quotes that of Boëtius, Omnia alia vitia
fugiunt à Deo, sola superbia se Deo opponit;
all other vices flie from God, pride alone
stands out, and makes head against
him.
            And as pride resists God in a speciall
manner, so God in a speciall manner
resists it; as both Saint Peter tels us in
his first Epistle, the fift Chapter, and
fift verse: and Saint Iames in his fourth
chap. and sixt vers. Which he manifesteth
to the worlde in punishing this
vice in a speciall manner, by letting a
man fall into other sinnes, for the correcting
or curing of Pride. Hee lets a
man fall into in continency, into drunkennesse,
into murther, into theft, that
so hee may learne to blush at his pride.
The Philosophers of the Gentiles whē
they knew God, and yet in the pride
of their heart would not glorifie him
as God, God gave them up to vile affections
for their punishment: but for
the cure of his blessed Apostle, lest he
should be puffed up with abundance

of revelations, hee sent him the messenger
of Satan to buffet him: which
was either a sinne, or doubtlesse a
strong solicitation to sinne. When the
Israelites were to possesse the Land of
Canaan, the inhabitants were not utterly
driven out; lest the wilde beasts
should devour them: and God hath left
the reliques of Originall sinne in the
best, while we are heer in warfare upon
earth; lest it being utterly vanquished,
we should be made a prey to self-love,
which is a branch of pride; it beeing
either Amor illicitus propriae excellentiae,
or appetitus celsitudinis illicitae: An unlawfull
love of our owne worth, or a
longing for an unlawfull height.
            That sinne then must of necessitie be
very odious in the sight of God, which
hee prevents, or scourges, or reformes
with other grievous sinnes: and being
so odious to God, it cannot but be very
displeasing to the sons of God. If
God denounce warre against any man,
all the creatures are ready to serve him
in their course: those then that he proclaimes

Rebels, the least that we can do
(if we would shew our selves good and
faithfull Subjects) is, To professe that
wee may not, wee must not, we cannot
suffer them; in as much as To lodge a
knowne traitor in our house, or to give
him countenance, or to converse familiarly
with him, and then to give out
that we carry as sound and loyal a heart
to our Soveraign as the best, is a matter
that rather deserves laughter, than beleef.
            Thirdly, our Prophet had reason
thus to oppose Pride, as hee was the
head of a family. Disobedience in children
towards their parents, stubbornnesse
in servants towards their masters,
envy in brothers one towards another;
name Pride, and you have named the
mother and nurse of them all. The least
thing that is spoken to a man of this humor,
to range him into order, is as burning
coales cast upon flax: it presently
sets him on fire. Hee envies his superiours,
and scorns to be commanded by
them: his equals hee disdains, &amp; scorns

to converse with them: and for his inferiours,
if hee could, hee would trample
them under feet. Hee commonly
sets-going, in pursuing his vanities and
pleasing his fancy, within lesse than a
quarter, the allowance of a whole year:
then must he with unjust dealing, either
at home or abroad, to the dishonour of
GOD, and the scandall of the house
where hee serves, make up that breach,
and repair those ruines which his owne
proud humour hath caused. I will bee
bould to say it (though it bee not commonly
held so) that, all things considered,
drunkennesse or incontinency, or
theft is more tolerable, and lesse troublesome
in a family, than Pride.
            Fourthly and lastly, our Prophet had
reason to oppose this vice, as hee was a
King: not onely, because the pride of
great ones must be maintained &amp; born-out
by exaction, extortion, and rapine
from the lower Subject; but because
it never leaves pearching and pushing
forward, till it set it selfe higher than is
meet: whence issue divelish and damnable

practices, in ridding such out of
the way, as they think bee likely to hinder
them. If Mordecai will not bow to
Haman, a whole nation must bee rooted
out for it. Finally, Only by pride man maketh
contention, Pro▪
                13. 10: wheresoever
strife goeth, there is pride, at least in
one of the parties contending, if not on
both sides. Sometimes, it stirreth up
men, and imbouldeneth them to offer
wrongs: somtimes, it imbittereth men,
and maketh them weyward against the
right: sometimes, it causeth the one to
be carelesse of dealing according to equity,
and the other to be impatient of
bearing any injuries. The best use then
for pride in a Common-wealth, is, To
make work for the jayler or hang-man,
or at least to keep the Lawyer from idleness.
            The last thing which I will speak of
in the handling of these words, is, that
if David would not suffer pride in others,
hee would much less allow it in
himselfe. Many gifts indeed hee had,
which were able to puffe up flesh and

blood; yet none of them all could
moove him. For beauty, hee was of a
lovely countenance, &amp; comely visage;
his strength such, as he was able to break
a boaw of steel; his bouldnes and courage
such, that hee had the heart of a Lion:
beeing but green in years, but a boy in
a manner, hee encountred and slew a
Bear, a Lion, a Giant of six cubites and
an hand-breath of height. Hee was taken
from the sheepfolds, and from following
the Ewes great with yong, and
from thence advanced to feed Gods
people in Iacob, and his inheritance in
Israell. Hee was so gracious before his
comming to the Crown, that the soule
of Ionathan (Sauls eldest son) was knit
to him: and the very women sang in
their courses, Saul hath slaine his thousand;
and David, his ten thousand. Hee
happily escaped the stratagems and persecutions
of Saul, and his Counsellers,
and men of warre: hee found courteous
entertainment even among the enemies
of God and his nation.
            After hee came to the Crowne, hee

obtained victories upon the Iebusites,
the Moabites, the Edomites, the Aramites,
the Ammonites, and upon the
Philistines, many a time and often. At
home, hee suddenly suppressed the rebellions
of Ishbosheth, of Sheba, of Absolom,
of Adoniah. His Wisdom was such,
that by Gods assistance hee drave Achitophel
(who was held in those daies,
for his wisdom, as the Oracle of God)
to hang himself with his owne hands:
his favour with God such, that he was acknowledged
to bee a man after Gods
owne heart: so skilfull was hee in Musick,
that hee was stiled the sweet Singer
of Israel; so expert in Poetry, that
his Psalms were even then during his
life publiquely sung in the Congregation,
as they are at this day; his propheticall
spirit such, that he cleerly foresaw
and foretould more particulars of the
Person, the Office &amp; Kingdom of the
Messias (of whom hee was a type, and
from whom Christ was to come) than
any one of the Patriarchs or Prophets
that went before him; his Power such,

that hee had under his command many
renowned and worthy Leaders, and to
the full number of thirteene hundred
thousand strōg men that drew swords;
his riches such, that hee left his Son toward
the building of the Temple an
hundred thousand talents of gold, and
a thousand thousand talents of silver,
                  
                     •
                  spans
                     •
                  
               
and of brass and iron passing waight; a
matter, were it not for the testimony of
Scripture, beyond beleef.
            Besides all this, his Patience was such,
that hee waited Gods leasure many
yeares betwixt the time of his anointing,
and his investing in the Throne;
his thorough &amp; found Repentance such,
that tis left as a patern to all succeeding
ages; his Charity such, that he prayed
for his enemies; hee caused the Amalechite
to be put to death, that gave out
hee had slain Saul; and the servants of
Ishbosheth, who indeed slew their master
Sauls son; and for the death of Absolon
hee sorely lamented, though his
owne life and state were endangered
by his practices: his Loyalty such, that

hee spared Saul twice, when hee might
have dispatched him and made a way
to his owne advancement. His Pietie
such, that hee desired rather to bee a
doore-keeper in the house of God,
than to live at ease in the Kings Palace.
And lastly, a Promise was made him,
that his sonne Salomon should succeed
him, and that his seed should bee established
in the throne.
            Were not these strong motives to
puffe up flesh and blood, to make himselfe
conceited and proud of his owne
worth? Yet heare what himselfe professeth
of his humility, the groundworke
of all his other vertues and abilities:
Psalme 131, I am not high minded,
I have no proud lookes, I doo not exercise
my selfe in great matters which are
too high for mee: but I refraine my soule
and keepe it lowe, like as a childe that is
weaned from his mother, yea my soule is euen
as a weaned childe.
            
            But, what was it that kept him so
lowe, notwithstanding his greatnesse,
and so many rare excellencies and perfections

wherewith he was endowed?
The first no doubt was the grace of
God: for, as he gives his grace to the
humble, so it is his grace which makes
them humble. The second, was those
Crosses and a
                  ••
               lictions, both outward
&amp; inward, wherewith God̄ fro time to
time had exercised him; From my youth
upward, thy terrors have I suffered with a
troubled minde. The third, was the consideration
both of his naturall corruption,
I was borne in iniquity, and in sinne
hath my mother conctived mee; as also of
his actuall transgressions, They are moe
than the haires of my head, and mine heart
hath failed mee. The fourth, was the acknowledgement
of his owne frailty,
Hee knoweth whereof we are made, hee remembreth
that we are but dust. The fift,
was the contemplation of Gods greatnesse;
the greatest among the sonnes of
men, being lesse in comparison of him,
than the silliest worme that crawles on
the face of the earth, in comparison of
them. The sixt, was the often exercising
of himselfe with fasting, with prayer,

with divine meditations and holy soliloquies,
with sackcloth and ashes, with
making his teares his drinke, and minling
his bread with weeping. The seaventh,
was his studying day and night
in Gods lawe (according to the commandement
given to the king, Deut. 17.
20, that his heart might not bee lifted
vp above his brethren) and esteeming
it above the hony and the hony comb,
above gold an silver, yea much fined
gold, and precious stone. The eightth
and last, was a full assurance &amp; free confession
that God was privie to all his
thoughts, that hee would reward him
according to his works; that hee was
both the Author, Maintainer, and Finisher
of whatsoever good, either in his
bodie, or in his soule, or in his estate:
according to that memorable speech
of Saint Paul, l. Cor. 4. 7. What hast thou,
which thou didst not receiue? and if thou
didst receive it, why doost thou glory,
as if thou hadst not received it? Let
our conclusion then still be, in regard
of all the good we either haue or doe,

               Non nobis Domine, non nobis, sed nomini
t
                     •
                  o da gloriam: Not unto us O Lord,
not vnto us, but unto thy Name give
the praise.
         
         
            
            Verse 6.
Mine eyes shall bee upon the faithfull of the
Land, that they may dwell with mee: hee
that walketh in a perfect vvay, hee shall
serve me.
            OVr Prophet having, in the verse
going before, made knowne in
part, what they were whom he would
not receive into his family and seruice;
Hee comes in this verse to tell us of
what condition they should be, whom
hee purposeth to admit, Mine eyes shall

                     •
                  e to the faithfull of the Land, &amp;c.
            
            
               It is not good that man should bee alone,
sayes God himselfe, Gen. 2. 18. And, Woe
be to him that is alone, saith the wise Salomon,
Eccles. 4. 10. And, Solus, vel Deus,
vel Daemon, saith Aristotle, He that
desires to be alone, is either of a more
base, or divine metall, than men commonly
are made of. Vpon this foundation
of mans sociable nature, Kingdomes
and Cōmon-wealths are built,
consisting of cities, and townes, and

parishes; and they againe of housholds
and families; and they againe of husband
and wife, parents and children,
Masters and Servants: of which last relation
I am chiefly to speake at this
time.
            Though the name and nature of a
Servant were first brought into the
world by the ungratiousnesse of Cham,
Gen. 9. 25: Yet is the impression of superiority
and subjection so universally
stampt upon the face of Nature, that
it reacheth up to heaven; there being
a greater light to rule the day, and a lesser
light borrowed from and subordinate
to the greater, to rule the night.
If wee ascend higher to the Angels,
there are among them principality &amp;
domination: nay, more than so, it
pearceth downe to hell, where wee
reade of Beelzebub a Prince of Divels.
And experience hath farther observed,
that even among unreasonable creatures,
this forme is kept; The birds being
by a naturall instinct subject to the
Eagle, the beasts to the Lion, and the

Bees marvailously obeying and reverencing
their Master. But, this truth
shines yet more clearely in man him
himselfe, a little map or module as it
were of the great world; his members
being subject to the head, his body to
the soule, his appetite to reason. And
this principle is so deeply ingraven upon
the conscience of all, that the very
barbarous nations, who retaine any
sparke of civility, willingly subscribe
vnto it.
            Whether then wee looke upward to
heaven, or downeward to hell, or outward
to the creatures, or inward to our
selves, we shall every where finde characters
imprinted of superiority and
subjection, command and obedience,
domination and service. To take it then
as granted, to bee a thing not lawfull
onely, but commendable; nor commendable
onely, but as the case now
stands, in a manner necessary; I will
proceed to the unfolding of the words
themselves. And first, of the former
part of the verse, Mine eyes shall be to the

faithfull of the Land, that they may dwell
with mee.
            
            Faithfulnesse in holy Scripture is taken
in diverse senses: Sometimes for
steadfastnes and assurance of beleefe;
Put forth thine hand, and put it into my side,
and bee not faithless, but faithfull, Iohn 20.
27: Somtimes for truth of speech; Fidelis
est hic sermo, This is a true &amp; faithfull
saying, 1. Tim. 4. 9: Sometimes for
the profession of Christian religion; If
any faithfull man or faithfull woman have
widowes, let them minister unto them, 1.
Tim. 5. 16: Sometimes for certainty &amp;
constancy in performing what a man
promiseth; Let us keep the profession of our
hope without wavering, for hee is faithfull
that hath promised, Heb. 10. 23: Sometimes
for perseverance in the truth; Bee thou
faithfull unto the death, and I will give thee
the crown of life, Rev. 2. 10. And, lastly,
sometimes for a carefull and conscionable
discharge of ones duty in that
place whereto he is called: thus Christ
is said to have been a mercifull and faithfull
high Priest, in things concerning God,

Heb. 2. 17. And Paul testifies of Tychicus,
that he was a faithful minister in the Lord,
Ephes. 6. 21. And in this sense I take this
word specially to bee understood heer
in my Text: Mine eyes shall be to the faithfull
of the land, that they may dwell with me.
            
            As the Art of navigation is most proper
to a Mariner; courage, to a Souldier;
arithmetick, to a Merchant; utterance,
to an Oratour: so is fidelity, to
a Servant. Wee commend a ship, not
so much for the fine shrowds and tackling,
or for the gilding or painting of
it, as for the sayling; and a horse, not
so much for the rich bosses, the trappings
&amp; caparisons, as for the running;
and a sword, not so much for the handle
or pummell hatcht or inameld, or
for a velvet scabberd imbroidered with
pearl, or set with pretious stone; as for
the temper of the blade and cutting:
so we commend a servant, not so much
for his strength, his nimblenesse, his
comelinesse, his parentage, his bravery
in clothes, or invention of fashions, his
court-like behaviour, or gracefull

speech, his pleasant wit or merry disposition,
his subtle and crafty fe
                  •
               ches,
his knowledge of foraine States &amp; languages;
as for his fidelity: Any of the
rest, nay all the rest without it, serving
only to make a servant more disposed &amp;
more able too, as well for the plotting
as the acting of villany; wheras fidelity,
having joyned with it but some few of
the rest in a mediocrity, makes him serviceable
in a good degree.
            This is the commendation of Moses,
Heb. 3. 5. Moses verely was faithfull in all
his house, as a servant. And it is required in
Stewards, that a man bee found faithfull,
1. Corinthians 4. 2. And our Saviour demandes
the question,Mat. 24
                     •
                   45 
               Who then is a faithfull
servant and wi
                     •
                  e, whom his Master
hath made Ruler over his house: They all
thereby implying in my understanding,
that faithfulnesse is one of the
Cardinall properties, if not the principall,
required in a good servant. Servus
fidelis protectio fortis, munitum palatium,
vivus thesaurus, saide Nazianzen; A
faithfull servant is a strong protection,

a fenced palace, a living treasure. And
therefore the great Alexander, being
enquired where his treasure was, pointed
with his finger to his domesticke
servants.
            Now, faithfulness presupposeth
knowledge and diligence, and shewes it
selfe either in deeds or vvords, in actions
or in speeches: In actions first, when a servant
doth that which tēds not so much
to the satisfying of his Masters vain
humour and sensuall appetite (which is
sometimes wanton and lascivious, and
sometimes againe malicious and bloody)
as the advancement and furtherance
of his true and reall good.
And thus doe I take Saint Paul to bee
understood, 1. Cor. 7. 23. Yee are bought
vvith a price, bee not the servants of men.
And againe, in the second of Titus, the
9. and 10. verses, Let Servants be subiect
to their Masters, and please them in all
things, not answering again▪ neither pickers,
but that they shew all good faithfulnes (all
good faithfulnes) adorning the doctrine
of God our Saviour in all things. In both

which places (as it seems) he would put
a difference betwixt Christian servants
and the bondslaves of the Heathen:
their Masters having over them ius v
                     •
                  tae
&amp; necis, absolute power of life and
death; and they being instrumenta animata,
living Engines, not so much respecting
the justness and equitie of that
which was commanded, as the wil and
pleasure of the Commander; such as
Tigillinus and Petronius were to Ner
                     •
                  :
But in these Cases better obey God
than man. The Masters turne is to bee
served vsquead aras, as far as honesty
and pietie will give leave; and no further.
            Againe, fidelity shewes it selfe in
deeds, when the servant preferres his
Masters good before his owne; his
Masters gaine, his ease, his liberty,
his safety before his owne: but as
Salomon askes the question, Pro. 20. 6,
Many men will boast everyone of his goodness,
but who can finde a faithfull man? So
may wee justly demand, Where shall
a man finde such a faithfull servant?

Surely he is a pretious jewell, and therfore
hard to bee found: yet such a servant
was our Prophet to his Master
Saul, who sought him as a flea, or as
one would hunt a Partridge in the
mountaines: yet when Abishai would
have nayled him whiles he slept, with
his speare to the earth, David would
not suffer him; hee spared his Masters
life, though it were to the indangering
of his owne, when hee might have secured
his owne by taking away his:
and therefore, by Gods blessing, himselfe
afterwards found the like affected
to him; Thou shalt not goe foorth, for thou
art now worth ten thousand of us, 2. Sam.
18. And againe, Thou shalt goe no more
out vvith us to battell, lest thou quench the
light of Israel, 21. of the same booke.
            Fidelity in words shewes it self, partly
in concealing of secrets and imperfections,
and by laying the finger upon
a mans mouth, and sealing up his lips in
such a case, whereof Salomon speakes,
Prov. 11. 13. Hee that goeth about as a talebearer,
discovereth a secret: but hee that is

of a faithfull heart, concealeth a matter.
And for this speciall quality it was, that
Augustus so highly esteemed and rewarded
Mecanas; it being the property
of a foole to be full of leakes, Plenus rim
                     •
                  rū
hac at
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   illac diffluens, No sooner is
any secret poured into his eare, but it
drops out at his tongue; he is in paine
till hee be delivered of it, as a woman
that is great with childe, or a stomach
that is full of winde. Yet two things
have often drawne secrets even out of
the bosome of those who have beene
otherwise held wise men; the inticements
of women, and the strength of
wine: Whereas on the other side it is
found by experience, that a sober and
chaste heart is the surest Casket to cō
               mit
the jewell of a Secrecy unto.
            Besides, fidelity shewes 
                  〈◊〉
                selfe in
words (if occasion serve, and a man bee
called unto it) in giving such counsell
as hee conceives to be not most acceptable
and passable, but most profitable
and wholesome; Such hearty counsell
as Salomon speakes of, Prov. 27. 9. As oyntment

and perfume reioyce the heart: so
doth the sweetnes of a mans friend by hearty
counsell: and in the multitude of such
Counsellers there is health, 24. 6. And
therefore one speciall thing which the
Primitive Christians ever mentioned
when they prayed for the Emperor (as
Tertullian in his Apolog
                  •
                tels us) was
this, that God would send him Senatum
sidelem, faithfull Counsellers. And it
seems our Prophet alluded heerunto; in
as much as where our English reads it,
To dwell with me; Arias Montanus, rendering
word for word, translates it, Ad
sedendum mecum: and Tremelius a Iew
borne, Vt consideant mecum, That they
may sit with me, as it were at Counseltable:
and Iunius hath this note upon
it, Bonos consiliarios, mihi adhibebo, I will
procure me faithfull Counsellers.
            Now as counsell is the life of action
and authority; so is discreet liberty
the life of counsell: which being once
remooved, for mine owne part, I finde
no difference betwixt a friend and a
flatterer, a parasite and a Counseller;

such as Ionadab, Amnons Counseller &amp;
friend, to whom he no sooner disclosed
his unnaturall affection to his sister
Tamar, but Ionadab presently findes
out, and shewes him a trick how hee
might compass his desire, and satisfie
his unlawfull lust, 2. Sam. 13. Whereas
had hee beene a faithfull Counseller
indeed, hee would have laboured by
all meanes to have reclaimed him from
his mischievous purpose, &amp; have stopt
such a villanie, as afterwards brought
shame to Tamar, griefe to David, death
to Amnon.
            
            Somewhat better was Ioab: who
though hee wickedly gave way to Davids
cruelty, in making away Vriah,
according to the tenor of the letter sent
unto him, 2. Sam. 11; Yet afterwards he
did him the office of a faithfull Counseller,
when David retyred himselfe
unseasonably upon the death of Absolon:
I sweare by the Lord (saith hee) except
thou come out, there will not tarry one
man with thee this night, 2. Sam. 19. 7.
And again, in the 24. of the same book,

when the King in the pride of his heart
would needs have his people to bee
numbred, The Lord thy God, saith Ioab,
increase thy people an hundred folde more
than they bee, and that the eyes of my
Lord the King may see it; but why
doth my Lord the King desire this
thing? Which howbeit at that time
David hearkened not unto, yet I
                     •
                  ab
therein did his part: and I make no
doubt, but the King himself afterward,
when hee felt the hand of God heavie
upon him, wished he had followed that
advice.
            The counsell of a grave and wise
man, who speakes not out of passion or
private respects, but out of a zeale of
the publique good, &amp; of the person of
him to whom hee gives it, should bee
entertained and reverenced as the Oracle
of God. And though it bee true,
that bookes written in former ages
(which are justly called dead Counsellers)
be for the most part more faithfull,
in regarde that they speake without
blushing or feare, to the present

times: Yet as true it is, that Counsellers
(which are or should bee living
bookes) if they bee faithfull, are undoubtedly
the more usefull, in regard
they best know the disease, and should
seek out the remedy of the times wherin
they live.
            It is not alwaies easie &amp; gentle physicke
which is the best; neither is it alwaies
crossing coūsell wch is the worst:
desperate is that mans case and past all
cure, whose eare judgeth all to be harsh
that is wholesome; and nothing profitable,
but what is pleasing. Our Prophet
was of another minde, when hee
spake, out of deliberation, Psal. 141, Let
the righteous smite mee; for that is a benefit:
and let him reprove mee, and it shall bee
a precious oyle that shall not breake my head.
And so was Salomon, Prov. 27. 6. Faithfull
are the wounds of a friend, but the kisses
of an enemy are deceitfull. And it commonly
proves true, that hee who reproves
not out of vaine affectation of
singularity, but with discretion and
out of an honest heart, shall commonly

finde more favor, certainly more comfort
at the last, than hee who flattereth
with his lips.
            But Counsell is best sought for at
their hands, who either have no part at
all in the cause whereof they instruct;
or else are so far engaged, that themselves
are to beare the greatest adventure
in the success of their owne counsels.
Vpon that counsell which Rehoboams
Counsellers gave him, are set the
two marks whereby bad counsell is for
ever best discerned; that it was greene
for the persons, and violent for the matter.
            Principis est virtus maxima, Nosse suos.
            It is a great part of princely vertue,
to observe the humours of his subjects
in generall, but chiefly of his Counsellers;
the greatest trust between man &amp;
man, being the trust of giving counsell.
For, in other confidences, men commit
the parts of their life, their lands, their
goods, their childe, their credit, some
particular affaire: but, to such as they
make their Counsellers, they commit

the Whole; by how much the more
they are obliged to all faith and integrity.
Neither need the wisest Princes
think it any diminution to their greatnes,
or derogation to their sufficiency,
to rely upon Counsell; since the ancient
times doo set forth in figure both
the incorporation and inseparable conjunction
of Counsel with Kings, in that
they say, Iupiter did marry Metis, which
signifieth Counsell: so as soveraignty
or authority is married to Counsell.
            The second condition which our
Prophet proposeth, to bee found in
such as he meant to entertain in his service,
is, Walking in a perfect way, or walking
perfect in the way: it comes both to
one; and the meaning of it is, The taking
of a godly and religious course, as
hath already been shewed in opening
the sense of the former part of the second
verse, I will doo wisely in the perfect
way; so heer, Hee that walketh in a perfect
way, hee shall serve mee. These two then
must go together, Faithfulness and Godlinesse,
Piety and Fidelity, civill Honesty &amp;

Religion: neither indeed can they bee,
as they should, either thrifty for themselves,
or trusty to their masters, who
bee not first religious towards God. It
was the memorable speech of Constantius,
father to the great Constantine, to
such as forsook their religion, that they
might please and serve him.
            
               Godliness, then, is requisite in the servant,
first in regard of himself, and then
in regard of his Master: in regard of
himself, because by that means he is sure
of a reward, either from his master, or
from God, or from both. The generall
promise they have, 1. Tim. 4. 8, Godliness
is profitable unto all things, having the promise
of the life present, and of that that is to
come. But, a more speciall one they have
directed to themselves in particular, in
Ephes. 6. 8, Knowe ye, that is, ye servants
(for, unto them hee begins to addresse
his speech in the fift verse) Knowe yee,
that whatsoever good thing any man doth,
the same hee shall receive of the Lord, whether
hee bee bond or free. And yet more
expresly in Colos. 3. 23. 24, Whatsoever yee

doo, doo it heartily as to the Lord, and not to
men; knowing, that of the Lord yee shall receive
the reward of the inheritance: for, yee
serve the Lord Christ.
            
            And many times it falles out, that
those, who beeing faithfull and godly,
receive the least reward at their masters
hands, receive the greater from
God, and that even in this world by his
gracious blessing. This, Iacob found:
hee was so religious towards God, that
though his Master were an Idolater, he
still kept himselfe free from it; and yet
so faithfull was hee to his Master, that,
for the space of twenty yeers, hee was
in his service consumed with heat in
the day, and frost in the night; and if
any of the flocks were either stolne, or
torne by beasts, hee made it good himself,
he set it not on his Masters accoūt.
Yet for all this, could not his Master afford
him a good look, much less a good
word: hee changed his wages tenne
times, sought to eat him up, &amp; to raven
all hee could get from him. This was
the reward he had from his Master for

his faithfull service. But now God so
blessed him for his sincerity in religion,
that the very Presents he sent his brother
Esau were able to make a rich mā,
Gen. 32. And of himself hee professeth
in the same chapter, verse 10, With my
staff came I over this Iordan, and now have
I gotten two bands.
            
            In regard of men, it fared worse with
Ioseph: though God prospered his Masters
house for his sake, neither would
he hearken to the impudent and importunate
su
                  •
               e of his mistresse; yet his recompense
was disgrace and imprisonment,
they put his feet in the stockes,
and the iron entred into his soule. But
God, in stead of the stocks, set him in
the seat of Iustice; and, in stead of his
fetters, put a chaine of gold about his
neck. I will conclude this point with
the exhortation of St. Peter, Servants,
bee subiect to your Masters with all feare;
not onely to the good and courteous, but also
to the froward: for, this is thank-worthy, if
a man for conscience towards GOD endure
grief, suffering wrongfully, 1. Pet. 2. 18.
            
               Secondly, as godliness is requisite in
a servant, in regard of himself; so is it in
regard of his Master. First, because, if
hee feare his Master and not God, all
that hee doth will bee but eye-service;
hee will certainely intend his Masters
good no further, than hee sees it may
sort with his owne: whereas if God &amp;
the fear of him bee before his eyes, hee
is the same man when his Master is absent,
as if hee were present; hee desires
and endeavours his best advantage, as
much though he were a thousand mile
off, as if hee stood by and lookt on. If
Gehezi had thought that his Master had
been so far indued with a propheticall
spirit, that hee could have tould him
what hee did in so great a distance from
him, hee would never have taken such
paines to run after the Syrian Captaine
for a bribe, to the disgrace of his Master,
and the undooing of himself. And
if Iudas had beleeved our Saviour to
have been God, and consequently that
hee had knowne the thoughts of his
heart, undoubtedly hee would never

have hatched against him such a foule
treason within his breast. It was nothing
that made Achitophel to side as a
Rebel with Absolon, and to plot against
his Master David, and Ziba against Mephibosheth;
but worldly respects, and
want of true religion.
            Besides, as ungodliness in the servant
cannot but put the Master in continuall
fear, both of his estate and person: so
it serves to infect as wel the children of
the house, as his fellow-servants; wheras
on the other side, the godliness of
one, beeing countenanced and incouraged
therein, serves to shame the lewder
sort, and to draw-on the well-disposed.
Thus Daniel, beeing admitted
into the King of Babylons Court, was
an instrument for the reforming and
converting even of the King Nebuchadnezar
himselfe. And Ioseph was admitted
into the King of Egypts Court,
that hee might inform his Princes, and
teach his Senatours wisedom, Psal. 125.
22. In the second of Kings and the fift,
wee read of a poore silly maid, but a

Iewesse by Nation (the onely people
of God at that time) who being taken
captive by the Aramites, and serving
Naamans wife, tolde her Mistris, of
the Prophet Elisha in Samaria; and by
that meanes gave occasion to her Lord
of going thither, and cleansing himselfe
from the leprosie both of his bodie,
and his soule.
            Lastly, a godly and religious servant
will ever be praying unto God, to send
a blessing on that worke which he is set
about; as Abrahams servant did, Gen.
24; and so God prospered his journey,
and the business he was intrusted with
accordingly. All which considered,
great reason had our Prophet to say,
and to double it, to promise and to vow
it, He that walketh in a perfect way, he shal
serve mee: He, he.
            Now, because the word heer used,
to Serve, in the Originall, signifies a
free and liberall kind of service; it may
well bee thought that our Prophet intended
not only the admitting of faithfull
and godly servants into his family,

but the advancing of such to the highest
offices, &amp; the placing of them in the
chiefest roome of government under
him. And surely this consideration
and promise was no less (nay, more)
necessarie then the former, in regarde
that the good which frō hence might
arise is more publique. They that bee
of high calling (if they bee good, and
desire their goodness may spread abroad
and reach unto others) for this
purpose may not un
                  •
               ily bee likened to
great Cisterns or ponds full of cleare
and wholesome water, that might bee
beneficial to many, if there were sound
and sweet pipes to convay it: whereas
on the other side, it yeeldeth no benefit
at all, if the pipes bee stopt; nay
proves hurtfull, if they bee poysoned
and corrupted. Whereof it commeth
to passe, that even when there be good
Princes, yet things doe still continue
out of frame: as wee see in the dayes
of Iosiah, a most excellent and carefull
King, who feared God betimes, &amp;
twice in his dayes reformed religion;

his remembrance is as the perfume
made by the Art of the Apothecarie,
and as musick at a banquet of wine;
there was no King before him, either
after him, that like Iosiah turned to
God with all his heart, as hee did: yet
were there in his dayes, even in the
time of his raigne, horrible abominations,
atheisme and contempt of God,
pride in apparell, oppression and cruelty,
yea much damnable Idolatry, notwithstanding
the good King by his laws
had taken as good order against these
as possibly he could. The cause of all
was, that such as were under him in the
Common-wealth, and in the Church,
did not that which hee willed, and belonged
to their place; According to
that complaint of Zophonie, That the
Princes were as roaring Lions, the Iudges
as Wolves in the Evening, which leave not
the bones till the morrow; the Prophets were
light and wicked persons, and the Priests
such as polluted the Sanctuary, and had
wrested the lawe of God to serve their owne
turne: And so what marvaile though in

a rare Kings daies iniquity overflowed
and abounded.
            
               Esay in like manner prophecied under
good Kings, Vzziah and Iotham, and
Hezekiah: yet he justly and sorely complaines,
how farre all things were even
then out of order, their silver vvas become
drosse, and their wine mixt with water,
Cap. 1. 22; and hee addes the reason
hereof in the verse following, because
their Princes, that is, their chiefe Officers
under the the King, vvere rebellious
and companions of theeves, They loved
gifts and followed after rewards, they iudged
not the fatherless, neither did the widowes
cause come before them. The people themselves
do so sensibly see and feele this,
that they reioyce vvhen the righteous bee in
authority, Prov. 29. 2; whereas cleane
contrariwise, they sigh and mourne
when the wicked are set up, and beare
rule; as it followes in the same place.
Thus when Mordecai came out from
the King in royall apparell, of blew &amp;
white, and with a great Crowne of
golde, and with a garment of fine linnen

&amp; purple, the whole citie of Susan
rejoiced and was glad, Ester 8. 15. The
counsell therfore of Iethro (Exo. 18. 21.)
was very good, and not without just
cause approoved of Moses, when hee
gave advice, that not onely his higher
Officers, Rulers over thousands and
hundreds, but the inferiours too, over
fifties and tennes, should bee men of
courage, fearing God, dealing truely and hating
cov
                     •
                  t
                     •
                  usnesse. Their fearing of God
was a meanes for them in good causes
to put on courage; and their hating of
couetousness to deale truely, which in
case they did not, the Cōmon-wealth
should not onely suffer, but Moses
should be sure to hear of it. For though
to private men it bee sufficient, if
them-selves doe no wrong; yet a
Prince must provide that none doe it about
him or under him; the neglect
hereof being the chief imputation that
was layde to Galbaes charge, and tumbled
him out of the Empire, as being
unworthy of government, Omnium consensu
dignus imperio, nisi imperasset.
            
            
               Hitherto of the Conditions which
our Prophet r
                  •
               quires in those whom
hee proposed to admit and entertaine
as Servants about him, as Counsellers to
him, as Officers under him: Now for
himselfe, he purposes his eyes should bee
upon them; and that, as I take it, first, for
Choyce, and secondly for Vse. There is
an eye of Search, and an eye of Favour:
the one is for the seeking and finding
them out, that they may serve; the other
for the countenancing of their
persons, and rewarding of their service.
First then, for the eye of search and
choyce; He would not take them up
at haphazard, nor upon the bare report
and commendation of others, hee
would not presently entertaine them
who most importunately sued or made
the greatest friends, or largest offers;
these being for the most part sure signes
of little desert, and lesse conscience in
the parties themselves, in discharging
the duties of those places they sue for.
Hee that buyeth is thereby shrewdly
provoked, nay, is after a sort openly

dispensed withall to sell againe. If hee
have to doo with the treasure, hee will
rob and spoyle; if with justice, he will
take bribes; if with Church affaires,
with matter of warre, or Civill government,
it may be hee will goe farther:
Such will make small account to sell a
State, or to deliver up a Kingdome.
Now the King, our Prophet speaketh
of, will for avoyding these mischiefes,
rather become a suter himselfe to sufficient
and able men, for the accepting
and undergoing of such charges as he
knew them fit for: neither would hee
advance any to the highest roomes of
dignity, but such as himselfe by experience
had found to bee conscionable
and faithfull in lower places; and if he
could not finde such neare him, hee
would seeke them farther off; his eyes
should runne through the Land from
the one end to the other, for the finding
of them out. Oculi mei ad 
                     •
                  ideles
terrae, Mine eyes shall bee to the faithfull of
the Land.
            
            Now, as his eyes were to them for

choyce and entertainement: so were
they upon them for encouragement &amp;
reward. Lord, saith hee, who shall dwell
in thy tabernacle, or who shall rest upon thy
holy hill? Among other properties this
is one, Hee that maketh much of them that
feare the Lord, Psal. 15. 4. And therefore
in the very next Psalme vers. 3, hee protests
that all his delight was upon the Saints
that are on the earth, and upon such as excell
in vertue. And againe, in the 119.
36, I am a companion of all them that feare
thee, and keep thy precepts: And in speciall
of servants, of Kings and Princes, sayes
Salomon, in the 14. of Proverbs, at the
last verse, The pleasure of a King is in a
wise servant, but his wrath shall be toward
him that is lewd.
            
            Neither is it sufficient to make much
of them by lookes and countenance,
and to feed with good words and faire
promises: but to speake and doe really
for them, as occasion shall serve &amp; they
deserve. Let thy soule loue a good seruant,
and defraud him not of his liberty, neither
leave him a poore man, Ecclus. 7. 21. And

the reason is given in the 33. of the same
booke, vers. 29. If thou have a faithfull
servant, intreate him as thy brother, for
thou hast need of him as of thy selfe. Such
a Master it seemes Naaman was to his
servants: which made them call him
father; Father, if the Prophet had commanded
thee a great thing, wouldest thou not
have done it? Such was that Centurion
in the Gospell,Compare Mat. 8, with Luke 7. who when his servant
was sick, intreated our Savior to come
to him and heale him, calling him by
the same name which signifies a sonne;
thereby shewing that good seruants
should be as sonnes to their Masters, in
dutifull obedience; and good Masters
againe, as kinde fathers in loving affection
to their servants, as remembring
that themselues have a father in heaven,
to whom they must one day render
an account of all their actions, and
with him there is no respect of persons.
         
         
            
            Verse 7.
Hee that worketh deceit shall not dwell
within my house: he that telleth lies shall not
tarry in my sight.
            OVr Prophet in the fift verse had
promised to banish Slander and
Pride: heer hee promiseth to take the
like order with Deceit and Lying; two
vices contrary to those two vertues
which before hee had vowed to entertain;
Deceit beeing opposite to Faithfulness,
and Lying to Godliness. These two
vices are so common and generall, and
yet withall so close and subtile, that he
could not promise utterly to abolish
and extinguish them; but to deale with
them as Physicians doo with pestilent
diseases, to expell them from the vitall
parts: upon discovery, they should not
lodge in the Court, nor remaine in the
Presence. Hee could not alwaies prevent
their entrance and abode there for
a while; deceitfull men beeing as cunning
to cover, as to work their deceit:

yet would hee as narrowly as he could
seek them out; and, when he had found
them, cast them out too.
            Indeed the saying is, Turpius eijcitur,
quàm non admittitur: It is more shamefull
to cast out a servant, than not to admit
him: But it is as true, Tutius eijcitur,
like a raw morsell that sitteth ill in the
stomach, he is more safely cast out than
retained: or, if hee be a Retainer, non
habitabit, hee shall not bee in ordinary;
or, if hee bee, hee shall not bee of such
as ly under my roof; or, if hee doo, non
habitabit in interiori domus meae, saith Arias
Montanus, hee shall have no place in
my privy-chamber, or bed-chamber.
            And for the Lier, hee may chance to
come into my sight, but non prosperabitur,
saith Musculus, hee shall not build
his neast there: non firmabitur, saith Arias
Montanus, hee shall take no rooting
there; non stabilietur, saith Iunius, hee
shall not set up his rest there.
            It was great Wisdom in our Prophet
that hee would not have his house a
mingle-mangle, to consist pel-mel of

diverse dispositions, as Hannibals army
did of severall nations: hee would not
have his family like a motley cloth, or
a meddly colour; some of his servants
being of one Die, and some of another:
but hee would have all to goe in one
Livery, uniforme and suitable; that so,
all agreeing and according together,
they might all walk, and look, and draw
one way in the service of God &amp; their
Master. For, had hee chosen some religious,
and others profane or idolatrous,
some honest and sober, others
swaggerers and unthrifts, some civil &amp;
peaceable, others cut-throats and rakehels;
lastly, some faithfull and godly,
as in the verse next going before; and
some deceitfull and lying, as in this
verse; like fire and water, they would
never have given over striving to expell
and chase away, or to supplant and undermine
one another: so that the Master,
in stead of an orderly and comfortable
service, should have found nothing
but controversie and complaint,
faction and brawl: for, What fellowship

hath righteousnes with unrighteousnes? what
communion hath light with darknes? what
concord hath Christ with Beliall? what agreement
hath the temple of God with Idols?
2. Cor. 6. It was indeed Machiavels rule,
Si vis regnare, divide; If thou wilt rule
in safety, sowe discord, and set division
betwixt those that are under thee: but
this is a point of the divels policy, hee
never learned it in the school of Christ;
and, for the most part, the practice of
it prooves most dangerous to the Authors
of it.
            Hitherto in the generall for so much
as concernes both these vices taken
jointly together; now to the particulars,
as they ly in order heer in my text:
and first of working deceit, and then of
telling lies. Deceit is commonly by the
Latines exprest by one of these three
words; Astutia, Dolus, or Fraus: between
which, the Schoolmen put this
difference, Prudentia directè opponitur astutia,
To true Wisedome craft or wilinesse
is directly opposed: executio autem
astutiae est propriè per dolum in verbis, perfraudem

fraudem in factis: but the execution of
craft is properly by cosenage in words,
and by guile in deeds. Wec are afterwards
to speake of cosenage in words.
The thing then heere intended, as I
think, is guile in deeds: which howbeit
it bee now-adaies almost generally
esteemed the essentiall point of a Lawyer,
the proper passion of a Merchant,
and the complement of an absolute
Courtier; yet our Prophet held it so odious,
as in two severall places he ioins
it in the same verse with bloodthirstinesse:
The Lord will abhorre the bloodthirsty
and deceitfull man, Psal. 5. 6. Vpon
which words, saith Aquinas, Verbo abominand:
denotatur odium irreconciliabile;
By the word, Abhorre, is implied an irreconcileable
and implacable hatred:
and indeed so it seemes, in as much as
our Prophet tels us again, Psal. 55. and
the last verse, The bloodthirsty and deceitfull
men shall not live out half their daies.
            
            Our Saviour, when hee would set
out Herod in his colours, cals him a fox;
Goetell that fox, Luke 13. 32: and when

hee would commend Nathanael, hee
calles him an Israelite, in whom was no
guile, Iohn 1. 47. The Divell is in holy
Scripture named a Serpent, not onely
because hee took that shape upon him
when hee deceived our first parents in
Paradise, but because the Serpent was
more subtile than any beast of the field,
Gen. 3. 1. As a Serpent, he is full of windings
and turnings, which are called his
depths, Rev. 2. 24, Neither have knowne
the depths of satā, that is, his deep fetches:
wherupon S. Paul, having reproved Elymas
the Sorcerer, that hee was full of
all subtilty and mischiefe; hee presently
addes, Thou childe of the divell, and enimy
of all righteousnes, Acts 13. 10. Now,
as the Divell appeared in the shape of a
Serpent, which is of all beasts the most
subtile and crafty; so did the H. Ghost
in the shape of a Dove, which is of all
birds the most simple and innocent:
and Iohn the Baptist tearms our Saviour
a Lamb, Behold the Lamb of God, that taketh
away the sinnes of the world, Iohn 1. 29.
And again the next day, as hee saw him

walking by, Behold the Lamb, or, as the
Original and our last Translation reads
it, that Lamb of God: not onely because
he was so prefigured in the sacrifice of
the Paschal Lamb, and foretold by the
Prophets, Hee was ledde as a sheep to the
slaughter, and as a lamb dumb before the
shearer, so opened hee not his mouth, Esay
53. 7; but also because hee had the properties
of a Lamb, and those specially
of a native innocency and godly simplicity;
according to that of the same
Evangelicall Prophet, cited by S. Peter,
1. 2. 22, Hee did no sin, neither was there any
guile found in his mouth.
            
            There is a blockish simplicity, or rather
stupidity, arising out of a naturall
defect; When a man deceives not another,
because hee wants wit to doo it:
and this is no more praise-worthy, than
continency in one that is an Eunuch
by nature, or sobriety in him that hath
no means to exceed. And ther is a godly
simplicity, when a man hath wit sufficient;
yet so, as, being corrected and
qualified by grace, hee restrains it from

such mischievous and guilefull plots;
as his naturall corruption would draw
him unto. And this indeed is that simplicity,
and none but this, which is cō
               mended
in Scripture, and accepted of
God. Posse &amp; nolle, nobile.
            
            And the vice contrary to this, is that
which the Civilians call dolus malus, by
them opposed to bona fides, and defined
to bee Machinatio quaedam alterius decipiendi
causa, cum aliud agitur, &amp; aliud simulatur,
A device for the deceiving of a
man, where one thing is done, and another
is dissembled. Whereunto agrees
that of Cicero, in the first book of his Offices,
where hee approves the reply of
Aquilius his familiar friend: who being
demanded, Quid esset dolus, what deceit
was; he answers, Vbialiud est actum,
&amp; aliud simulatum, where one thing is
practised, and another pretended: And
of Augustine in his seaventh Tract upon
Iohn, expounding those words of
Christ, touching Nathanael, Behold an Israelite,
in whom is no guile: Tum dolus est,
               
                  •
               aith hee, cum aliud agitur, &amp; aliud fingitur;
               
when one thing appears in the fact,
and another thing is hid in the heart.
Yet even this, if it bee for the good of
some, and the hurt and hinderance of
none, I dare not pronounce to be simply
unlawfull. Such a deceit is that
which Nurses use for the stilling of
their children; or Physicians, for the
healing of their Patients. Such did our
Prophet himselfe use, when for the saving
of his life hee fained himself mad,
among the Philistines, 1. Sam. 21. 13.
And hitherto are those words of S. Paul
by some referred, For as much as I was
crafty, I took you by guile, 2. Cor. 12. 16.
            Nay, though it tend to the outward
hinderance and hurt of some, I cannot
alwaies utterly condemn it. It was by
a cunning sleight, that the Israelites
robbed the Egyptians, that Ehud slew
Eglon, and Iehu Baals priests: yet they
being warranted by Gods counsell, and
excited by his Spirit, what therin they
did was in right justifiable. Nay, more
than so: in a just and honorable warre,
where it is lawfull to kill, it is not unlawfull

by stratagems to deceive.
            Dolus an virtus quis in hoste requirit!
            It was the speech indeed of a Heathen,
yet approoved by St. Hierome in
his Exposition upon Ezek. 17; but with
this caution, that it be practised without
the violating of an oath, the breach of promis,
or the making of a lie.
            
            W
                  •
               ich notwithstanding, the world
too well knoweth, and with griefe feeleth
it to bee both the doctrine and the
practice of the Church of Rome, that
Faith plighted to Hereticks is not to bee held.
Which position while she houlds, I see
not how those whom she accounts Heretiques
can either with safety and security,
or without just fear and manifest
danger, any way rely upon the contracts
made with her or her adherents.
Their morall or civill honesty may
chance ty them to the performance of
such oaths: but (I am sure) their religion,
the strongest bond of conscience,
doth not. Nay, if it bee for the good of
their Church, it dispenseth with the
breach, and (which is more) cōmands

them to break it. It is written by an Italian,
no stranger to the Court of Rome,
that the Proverb is, Mercatorum est, non
regum, stare iuramentis, It is for Merchaunts,
not Kings, to stand to their
oathes: but from such Merchants of mens
soules, Libera nos Domine, Good Lord deliver
us.
            Now, the inconveniences and mischiefes
which accompany this deceitfulness,
specially in a servant, are these:
First, himself seldome or never thrives
by it; hee enjoyes not the benefit of
that which hee gets by falshod, according
to that of Salomon, Proverb. 12. 27.
The deceitfull man rosteth not that which he
tooke in hun
                     •
                  ing: and of our Prophet,
Psal. 58. 9. Or ever their pots bee made hot
with thornes, so shall indignation vex them
as a thing that is raw. It shall fare with
them as with hunters, who many times
when they take a prey, yet themselves
taste not of it; or as with meat, which,
the thornes being consumed under the
pot, is left unsodden: and so all their
plottes and enterprises become as the

untimely fruit of a woman, which never
sees the sunne. And if they come
not to publike shame amongst men,
which for the most part they doe (the
vizard of their hypocrisie being pluckt
off) yet God in his due time will not
forget them. According to that of the
Apostle, 1. Thes. 4. 6, Let no man oppresse
or defraud his brother, for God is the avenger
of all such things. If a man be so mighty
to oppresse, that the Magistrate wil
not lay holde on him, or so cunning
to defraude that the lawe cannot take
holde of him, then where man and
his lawe cease, there God and his lawe
begin; though they dazle the eyes of
men, yet the eye of God they cannot;
and the lesse they feele at the hands of
men, the heavier shall they feele the
hand of God, either in their states, or
in their bodies, or in their soules, or in
their posterity, or in all. Such a one
may flourish for a while, like a greene
Bay tree; but, I went by, and loe hee was
gone; I sought him, but his place could no
vvhere bee found. Keepe innocencie then

and take heed to the thing that is right, for
that shall bring a man peace at the last, Psal.
37. It is the surest, and fairest, and likeliest
way to bring him to riches and honour,
in as much as all men desire to
deale with him whom they repute honest,
though themselves bee not such:
but the undoubted way it is to bring
him Peace, peace with himselfe, and
peace with his God; without which,
his riches and honour will doe him little
good: Nay, they will in the ende
prove his bane and confusion.
            Another mischiefe, that arises from
the deceitfulness of a Servant, is to his
Master (specially if hee be a great personage,
and of eminent note) either by
bringing-in unjust accounts, or by betraying
him to his enemies; who somtimes
preferre a servant, that they may
thereby worke villany and get intelligence
of secrets; and so it may come
to passe, that under a velvet or silke or
scarlet cloake, a Iesuite or Priest may
be entertained: or lastly, in deceiving
others, by using his Masters name,

though without his knowledge or consent,
yet hee cannot but by that means
breed in mens minds an ill conceit, &amp; in
their tongues an il report of his Master.
It very much then imports great men &amp;
Princes, not onely to observe narrowly
such servants as they suspect, but for
examples sake to punish them severely
being detected. Such were some of
them about the good Emperour Aurelian,
who by Monopolies and impositions,
by projects and perquisites enenriched
themselves, to the impoverishing
of the estate, and the dishonoring
of their Master: Nay, of him
they made a Monopoly too; who, being
let to know no more then what they
pleased to informe him, was of them
by that meanes even bought and sold.
But Alexander Severus tooke another
course with them: who understanding
that Vercovius had greatly abused his favour,
taking much money of diverse
to preferre their sutes, and dooing nothing
for them, hee caused him to bee
hanged up in a chimney as some write,

or as others, to bee tied in publique to
a stake, and there to bee stifled with
smoake; an Herauld proclaiming to
the people, Fumum vendidit, &amp; fumo
pereat, Smoak he solde, and with smoak
let him perish. And, if it be observed,
the greatest Marchants of smoak have
ever been found to be the greatest slaterers
of their Masters, Having mens
persons in admiration because of advantage,
Iude 16. I have dwelt somewhat the
longer upon this point, because the
Court is generally held the Shop, the
Forge, nay, the Schoole and Theater
of this vice: not without good cause
then doth our Prophet vow, it shall
not dwell with him.
            As in the first place hee excludeth
working of deceit; So doth he in the second,
telling of lies: Hee that telleth lies
shall not tarry in my sight.
            
            Servum nolle mentiri nova religio est,
            Saith one of the antient Comikes;
            And another,

                  Is cliens frugi habetur, qui neque leges,
                  neque aequum bonum unquam colit.
               
            
            
               But this is heathenish divinity: or as
it may well bee thought, they rather
spake what men commonly did, then
what they should doe. Once, our Prophet
I am sure was of another minde:
though he were an old servant, though
never so usefull and profitable to him,
though never so neare and deare, as his
right hand, or his right eye; yet if hee
fell to lying, away he must; hee would
would bee so farre from shewing him
any favour, that hee should not so
much as enjoy the sight of his countenance.
            A wonder it is to consider that the
imputation of a lie should bee so odious,
and yet the practice so frequent among
men (specially those who stand
most upon their reputation) the name
so hatefull, and the use so common:
that men should be so tender, and sensible
of the giving of the lie, as to think
it presently worthie the stabbe or the
chalenge; and yet to be so careless and
unconscionable in the making of it: a
strange kinde of vanity, I say it is, and

a marvailous repugnancy and contradiction
in the nature of man, to bee so
hot in the pursuite of the one, and so
colde in the other. Wherefore either
seeme to bee as thou art, or be as thou
wouldst seeme: either have a care and
conscience that thou make not a lie, or
bee content that a man call a Spade a
Spade, a Lier a Lier.
            This vice of all other is so universally
spread over the face of the world,
not onely among servants, but all sorts
of men, that what our Prophet spake in
his haste, I said in mine haste, all men are
Liers, Psalm 106. 10, that the Apostle
spake advisedly, Rom. 3. 4, Let God bee
true, and every man a lyer. But we must
know it is one thing to lie, and another
to make a trade or custome of lying:
one thing to slip into it unawares; another,
deliberately to forge and conceive
it, and which is worse to defend
it, and stand in it being done. The one
may proceed from the common frailty
incident to mankinde; yet not without
some striving against it, and repentance

for it, in such as are sanctified by Gods
spi
                  •
               it: but the later is onely proper to
the unbeleeving and unregenerate.
Therefore sayes our Prophet, not Loquens
mendacium, in the singular number;
but mendacia, in the plurall.
            Now in the handling of this point,
wee may first consider the nature, and
diverse kindes of a Lie. Secondly, the
greatnesse of the offence, how slightly
soever we esteeme of it. And lastly,
the punishment alwaies due unto it, &amp;
many times inflicted upon it.
            
               A Lie (to speak properly) is the speaking
of an untruth with an intent to deceive.
For the clearer unfolding of which definition,
we are to call to mind a fourefolde
truth mentioned in holy Scripture:
of Iudgement, of Affection, of
Action, of Speech. The truth of Iudgement
is opposed to Error, of Affection to
Hypocrisie, of Action to Dissimulation,
and of Speech to Lies or Falshood.
If a man speak that which is false without
an intent to deceive, supposing it to
be a truth, it is a material lie. If he speak

a truth with an intent to deceive, supposing
hee spake a falshood, it is a formall
lie: But if hee speake a falshood,
knowing it to be a falshood, with an intent
to deceive, this is a full, a flat lie;
it hath the whole essence, the matter &amp;
the forme, the soule and the bodie of
a lie.
            The materiall lie is lyable to the
censure of men, but excusable before
God, at least à tanto, though not à toto;
in as much as it proceeds out of ignorance,
the tongue agreeing with the
understanding, but the understanding
disagreeing from the thing. The formall
lie is punishable by God, though
acquitted by men; in as much as the understanding
disagrees from the speech,
though the speech agree with the
thing: but the full lie including both
the matter and the forme, deserves punishment
both from God and men; in
as much as in it both the understanding
disagrees from the speech, and the
speech from the thing. Which ground
being laid, I see not how the most cunning

Sophisters in the world can free
their equivocations, and mentall reservations,
at leastwise from the formality
of a lie: which is indeed the life of it,
if there may bee life in such a dead
work. For, to grant that the thing wch
they speake is true, yet they cannot denie
but they speake it with an intent to
deceive: and then Linguam ream facit
mens rea, It is a guilty minde that makes
a guilty tongue; according to that of
Augustine, Ex animi sui sententia non ex
rerum ipsarum veritate aut falsitate mentiens
aut non mentiens iudicandus est: A Lyer
is to bee iudged not so much by the
truth and falshood of things, as by the
purpose and intent of his minde.
            It matters not then, whether my lye
be iocosum onely for sport and merriment;
or officiosum, for the pretended
good of some, without the hurt of any;
or malitiosum, out of a mischievous
designe: if it be an untruth uttred with
an intent to deceive, it comes all to one
for the unlawfulnesse of it; howbeit,
the one bee sinfull in a higher degree,

more divelish and damnable than the
other: and beeing once unlawfull in it
self, as being a direct breach of the law,
none other respect but onely the dispensative
power of the Lawgiver himself
can possibly make it lawfull. When
Thespis, the first stage-player, was asked
if he were not ashamed to utter so many
untruths in so worthy an audience;
hee answered, that hee did it in sport:
but wise Solon replied, if wee approve
and commend this sport, we shall finde
it in earnest, in our contracts &amp; affaires.
And even so indeed by just judgement
it befalles a man, who, using to ly in
sport, gets an habite of lying in earnest;
and with his jesting lies raiseth such a
suspicion of him, that, bee he in never
so good earnest, hee cannot bee beleeved.
And for officious lies, since wee
cannot make a lie for God cause, as Iob
testifies, 13. 9; much less may we ly for
the behoof of our selves or other men.
Vse not then to make any manner of lie: for,
the custome thereof is not good, Ecclus. 7. 13.
No good and honest means are to bee

neglected, which tend to the refreshing
and cheering of their spirits who beare
the burden of the State: yet the Prophet
Hosea 7. 3, reproves those that make
the king glad with their wickednesse, and the
Princes with their lies: neither is it anie
way warrantable to doo evill, that good
may come thereof, Rom. 3. 8. As righteousnes
then and peace, so truth and charity are
inseparable companions. And therfore the
Apostle, 1. Cor. 13, puts downe this among
other marks of charity, that it reioyceth
in the truth, verse 6.
            And for those examples registred in
holy Scripture of the Mid-wives to
save the male-infants of the Hebrews,
of Rahab to save the spies, of Mich
                     •
                  l and
Ionathan to save David from Sauls fury,
and the like of that kinde, either commended
or not discommended; I answer,
that we must distinguish betwixt
the deeds of the faithfull, and their maner
of dooing them. Their facts in saving
David, the children, the spies,
were commendable, and argued the
fear of God and love of his children:

but the manner of putting them in execution
is neither approoved in holie
Scripture, nor was in it selfe justifiable,
nor is to bee imitated of us; it beeing
no more lawfull to save a mans life by a
lie, than by theft: both which, without
repentance, in themselves deserve
death eternall. Et quomodo non perversissimè
dicitur (saith S. Augustine) ut alter
corporaliter vivat, debere alterum spiritualiter
mori? How can it be but a perverse
assertion, to say, That one should incur
the death of the soule, to free another
from that of the body? And not farre
off in another place, Quanto fortius, quā
                  to
excellentius dices, Nec prodam, nec mentiar,
ut Firmus Episcopus Tagastensis?
How much more courage and constancy
doth it shew, for a man to say, I will
neither betray the truth, nor my friend;
as did Firmus Bishoppe of Tagastum,
Firmus nomine, firmior autem re; Firm
in name, but more firm indeed.
            The truth heerof will the better appear,
if we consider the greatnes of the
offense, the second thing which I proposed:

in as much as it is first directly against
God himselfe; secondly, against
the Scriptures, the Oracles of GOD;
thirdly, against nature, the workmanship
of God; and fourthly, against civill society,
the ordinance of God. Against
God it is both essentially and personally
taken. Against God the Father; This is
eternall life, that they knowe thee to bee the
onely true God, Iohn 17. 3: Against God
the Sonne; I am the way, the truth, and
the life, Iohn 14. 6: Against God the holy
Ghost; When hee is comne, who is the
Spirit of truth, he will lead you into all truth,
Iohn 16. 13. And as God is the Father
of truth; so is the Divell the father of
Lies: when hee speaketh a Lie,
then hee speaketh of his owne; for
hee is a lier, and the father thereof, Ioh.
8. 44. No marvell then, that one of
those seven things which the Lord
hates, and his soule abhorres, is a lying
tongue, Pro. 6. 17.
            Secondly, it is against the Scriptures,
the Oracles of God. And therefore are
they truely called Verbum veritatis, the

word of truth, Eph. 1. 13; not onely because
they were indited by the Author
of all truth, or because they contain so
much supernaturall truth as is requisite
for our salvation, but withall because
they excite us to the imbracing &amp; practising
of truth. Cast off lying, and speake
every man truth unto his neighbour, Ephes.
4. 25. Ly not one to another, Col. 3. 9. Lord,
who shall dwell in thy Tabernacle, saith our
Prophet? Even he that speaketh the truth
from his heart, Psal. 15.
            Thirdly, it is against nature, the workmanship
of God. It is the priviledge
of Mankinde above all Creatures, that
hee is 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , a creature capable
both of reason and speech: and as reason
was ordained to bee the guide and
directer of our speech; so was our
speech, to be the expounder and interpreter
of reason. And therefore the
Grammarians make 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , which signifieth
speech, to be 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , that which
gives light to the notions of the understanding.
If, then, wee speak one thing
and think another, if wee expresse one

thing with our lips, and conceive another
thing in our hearts, it is against the
end for which God created speech.
            Fourthly and lastly, it is against Civill
society, the ordinance of God; a maine
part wherof consisting in Conference,
in Consultation, in Contracts, Fractavel
leviter imminuta authoritate veritatis,
omnia dubia remanebunt, saith Saint Augustine;
The credit and soverainty of
truth, being never so little crackt, or
the practice of lying never so little coū
               tenanced,
a man can build upon nothing,
but all things will bee full of
doubt and distrust. Rightly then saith
the same good Father, Nunquam errare
tutius existimo, quam cum in amore nimio
veritatis &amp; reiectione nimia falsitatis erratur:
A man cannot lightly erre more
safely, then in too much love of truth,
&amp; hatred of lies. Truth is a salt which
serveth for the seasoning of every action,
and maketh it favorie both to God
and man: and in the 6. to the Ephes. it
is compared to a girdle, or a Souldiers
belt, whereby they knit together and

close vnto their middle the upper and
lower peeces of their armour. And
these belts, as they were strong, so were
they set with studs, being faire &amp; large.
There is then a double use of them:
one, to keepe the severall peeces of armour
fast and close together, &amp; to hold
the loynes of a man firm &amp; steddy, that
hee may be able to stand the surer, and
holde out the longer; the other, to cover
the ioynts of the armour, that they
might not be seene. The first use was
for strength, the second for ornament:
and thus truth is both an ornament to a
Christian souldier, and also an excellent
meanes for strength to uphold and
assure him in the day of trial. Therfore
wisely doth Solomon advise us, To buy the
truth, but in no case to sell it, Pro. 23. 23.
            The last thing which I promised, is
the punishment: and that surely cannot
but much aggravate the grievousnesse
of the sinne. It is both the punishment
of other sinnes, and other sinnes the punishment
of it. When God would punish
Ahab for his wickedness, presently

the Divell offers himselfe for the
execution of the service; I will goe and
be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his Prophets,
1. King. 22. And those that would
not beleeve and love the truth, he punisheth
with strong delusions that they should beleeue
lies, 2. Thess. 2. And as it is the punishment
of other sinnes, so did hee punish
it with other sinnes in those Philosophers
of the Gentiles, who because they
turned the truth of God into a lie, therefore
God gaue them up unto vile affections, Rom.
1. 25. And the rule is general, The mouth
that lieth slayeth the soule, Wis. 1. 11. Thou
shalt destroy them that speake lies, Psal. 5. 6.
And Revel. 22. 15, Without shall bee dogs▪
and enchanters, and whoremongers, and
murtherers, and Idolaters, and whosoever
loveth or maketh lies. And if God thus
shutte them out of his presence; not
without cause doth our Prophet promise,
They shall not tarry in his sight. It is
the prayer of Salomon, Prov. 30. Remoue
from mee vanity and lies; and his position
in the 29. of the same book, ve
                  •
               s. 12, Of
a Prince that hearkeneth to lies, all his servants

are wicked. And if wee are to shun
the practice of lies, much more the
doctrine of lies, Teaching lies through hypocrisie,
1. Tim. 4. 2. One effect whereof
is the confident relation of their lying
miracles, and that Golden Legend compiled
by a leaden braine, and published by
a brazen forehead. I will conclude with
Saint Augustines conclusion of his two
Treatises de mendacio ad Consentium, Aut
cavenda sunt mendacia recte agendo, aut
confitenda sunt poenitendo; non autem, cum
abundent infeliciter viuendo, augenda sunt
&amp; docendo. Lies are either to be shund
by speaking truth, or to be confest and
bewailed with sorrow; or if they abound
by ill living, they are not to bee
multiplied by teaching them as lawfull.
         
         
            
            Verse 8.
I will earely destroy all the wicked of the
Land, that I may cut off all wicked doers
from the citie of the Lord.
            OVr Prophet, having in the former
verses of this Psalme, vowed the
reformation of his owne Person, of his
housholde Servants, of his Counsellers &amp;
inferior Magistrates; Heere in this last
verse he vowes in generall the reformation
both of the Church and of the Common-weak,
of the Civill and Ecclesiastical
State. In the handling of which words,
I will follow the method proposed in
the Text. The first word is, In matutinis,
as Arias Montanus; or Singulis matutinis,
as Tremelius renders it: In the
mornings, or morning by morning▪ Every
morning: wherin he notably expresseth
his diligence and dispatch, in that it should
bee his mornings worke; and then his
Constancy and perseverance, in that it
should bee his worke euery morning,
The second thing is, the worke it sel
                     ••
                  
                  ▪
                  
I will destroy, I will cut off; his meaning
is, when no other remedy will serve
the turne. The third is the Obiect, the
persons upon whom this severe justice
is to be done; not petty offenders,
much lesse the innocent, but notorious
malefactors: The vvicked of the Land,
wicked doers. The fourth is, the unpartiality
of his proceeding without respect
of persons, All the wicked of the
Land, all wicked doers; twice repeated,
that we might take notice of it. As he
wold cut off none but notorious malefactors,
so would he as near as he could
cut them all off: Neither his heart nor
his eye should pitie, nor his hand spare
any of them. The fift and last is, the
End hee proposeth to him selfe of this
worke; the purging of the Citie of the Lord,
by which is meant Hierusalem: first, for
Example to the whole Realme, it being
the Metropolis and head Citie of the
kingdome; as also and principally, by
reason the service of God and the exercise
of religion was in a speciall manner
by divine ordinance tyed unto it. First

then of the first, In matutinis: wherein
his diligence in the carefull performing
of this worke comes first to bee observed.
            The saying is common, and in some
cases no lesse just, Odi nimium diligen
                     •
                  es:
but where the businesse is weighty, and
the fayling dangerous, a man can hardly
be too, diligent. The life of man is
precious, and the preservation of the
State and Church important; and diligence
in such a case is not onely commendable,
but necessary. The search
of truth is hard, specially being disguised
by the colourable shifts of cunning
heads: and in such a case, as it is the glorie
of god to conceal a thing, so it is the Kings
honour to search out a matter, Prov. 25. 2.
And no time so fit for this search as the
morning, when mens wits are freshest,
and their mindes after repose least distracted:
Therefore Iosuah rose early
in the morning for the discovery of Achans
theft, 7. 16. And besides, the drinking
of wine often makes men after
meales to forget the lawe, and pervert the

iudgement, Pro. 31. 5. Therefore is there
a woe pronounced against that Land,
whose Princes or chiefe Magistrates
eate in the morning, Eccles. 10. 16; that is,
take up that time which is specially allotted
for matters of justice, with intemperate
and unseasonable eating and
drinking. As then he is cursed that doth
the worke of the Lord negligently: so
is hee blessed that doth it diligently and
watchfully, In matutinis.
            
            The second thing implyed in this
word, is speed and dispatch: therefore it
followes in the same place of the Prophet
Ieremy, Cursed bee hee that keepeth
backe his sword from blood, 48. 10; that
deferreth to doe justice when occasion
and oportunity is offered, when reason
and religion requires it. Delayes in other
things are not good: but in this
they are starke naught, because by delay
great offences many times get either
friends for protection, or meanes
for evasion; according to a saying of
the Italians, Give mee time, and give mee
life. Againe, by delay and connivence,

small offences growe great: a little fire
which at first might have beene put
out with a spoonfull of water, being let
to burne, turnes townes and cities into
ashes, and cannot bee quenched with
whole rivers. Punishments are as medicines,
which if they be kept too long,
hazard the Patient, and lose their vertue;
And Magistrates as Physicians,
who must not let a disease go too long,
left by sufferance it proove incurable;
which might haue beene holpen by
timely ministring. Lastly, as by delay
the offender growes bolder, to the farther
indangering and oppressing of the
innocent, the infecting of the good, the
hartening and hardning of the wicked:
So hee that should cut him off, many
times by tract of time growes colder in
his zeale to justice.
            If Ioab had received condigne punishment
according to his deserts at his
killing of Abner, he would never have
growen so audaciously insolēt to murther
Amasa in such a treacherous manner.
And had Absolon beene taken

short, when by his command his brother
Amnon was slaine, there had bin
no danger of his ensuing rebellion against
his Soveraigne, his Father. It is
good then to launce an ulcer betimes,
before it growe to a Gangrene; and to
kill a Tetter before it spread to a Ringworme.
That which God commandeth
Fathers of families, that if they
love their children, they correct them betimes,
and chastice them whiles there is hope,
Prov. 13. 24, is also required of the fathers
of the Common-wealth: Whoseever
will not doe the lawe of God and the
King, let iudgement be executed speedily upon
him, Esra, 7. 26. And the reason hereof
is yeelded by Salomon, Eccles. 8. 11. Because
sentence against an evill worke is not
executed speedily, the heart of the sonnes of
men is fully set on mischiefe.
            
            Yet is there not more haste to be made
than good speed. The celestiall spheares,
the higher they are in situation, the
slower are they in their proper motion:
and the supreame Iudge of the
world useth much forbearance &amp; long

suffering toward sinners, that so by the
riches of his goodnes hee might draw
them to repentance; or because hee
foreseeth, that they will doo some notable
good worke to the advancement
of his glory, &amp; the good of his church:
Much like, saith Plutarch in that golden
Booke of his, De sera Numinis vindicta,
as the lawes ordain that a woman, condemned
to death for some hainous offense,
bee neverthelesse reprived and
spared, if shee be with childe, untill she
bee delivered: which beeing done, the
Law is executed upon her. As then the
supreme Iudge in heaven inflicts punishments
on offenders without al passion,
and with all patience, in due manner,
place and season: so should his
Vice-gerents on earth, not so much out
of desire of revenge, as zeal of justice;
For, the wrath of max worketh not the righteousnes
of God, Iames 1. 20.
            And as hee, which hath no skill in
Physick, cannot with reason controule
a skilfull Physician, because hee draweth
blood from his Patient rather to

morrow than to day: so neither ought
men to censure the proceedings of
God, whose judgemēts are many times
secret, but alwaies right; having feet
of lead, but hands of iron: and though
hee bee long a-striking, yet he strikes
home at last; tarditatem gravitate compensat,
he makes amends for his sloweness
with the waightiness of his blow. Nor,
among men, ought inferiours too farre
to censure the proceedings of their superiours;
who many times stop the execution
of Iustice, for causes just and
reasonable in themselves, though unknowne
to us. The Heaven for height, &amp;
the earth for depth▪ and the heart of the king,
is unsearchable, Pro. 25. 3.
            The Law enacted by Theodosius, at
the instance of S. Ambrose, cannot bee
misliked: that because, being transported
with choler, hee had caused many
Innocents of Thessalonica to be put to
the sword; from thenceforth thirtie
daies should passe betwixt the sentence
of death and the execution thereof: in
as much as the guilty, though spared

for a time, might notwithstanding afterwards
bee executed; but the guiltlesse,
beeing once executed, could not
again bee restored. Yet can it not bee
denied, but upon evident proofe and a
fair triall, so way bee not given to rash
&amp; unadvised anger, for many &amp; waighty
reasons already touched, it were for
the most part better, that expedition in
punishing great offenses, and cutting
off notorious malefactours, were rather
used, than slacknes.
            Some others there are, who, by this
Betimes heer mentioned in my Text,
understand our Prophet as vowing the
execution of Iustice at his first entrance
to the Crowne, in the morning of his
raign. Like a cleane soule comming out
of the hands of the Creator, &amp; placed
in a Kingdom left by Saul, as in a body
altogether unclean, hee promiseth, not
to draw pollution from it, as the soule
doth from the body; but rather to endeavour
to cleanse it from those foule
impieties wherewith it swarmed: heerin
resembling the Sun in the Heavens,

which as soon as it riseth, or before it
appear, chaseth the darknes before it,
and is clothed with glory, as with a
robe.
            Heer, reason of State objecteth the
danger of sudden innovation, feare of
the multitude; and I knowe not what
a number of doubts and difficulties it
forecasts: but our Prophet, though
doubtlesse not ignorant of these, yet in
a holy resolution casts them behinde
him; as well knowing, that the principles
of humane policy are as uncertain
as the braine wherein they are forged;
beeing perswaded in conscience, and
his heart telling him, The action it self
was good, the throng and thickness of
difficulties should not discourage him,
but rather make him the more stoutly
to plucke up his spirits, and to buckle
himself more roundly to the businesse.
It was a sore task he had in hand, a long
journey hee had to goe; and therefore
hee had need to set forth betime, if hee
meant to arrive at the end thereof before
the night of death should overtake
him.
            
               They were memorable peeces of justice
which Salomon did, as soon as God
had put the scepter into his hand. Iehu,
at his first entrance into the Kingdom,
roots out the house of Ahab, and the
worship of Baal▪ Iosiah, when hee was
now but twelve yeeres old, beganne to
purge Iudah and Ierusalem, 2. Chro. 34;
that men might knowe what they were
to trust unto in the succeeding course
of his government.
            Yet I take not our Prophets meaning
to bee, that the Prince at his first entrance
should unwisely and without advice
destroy and cut off; for so, perhaps,
by seeking to make a way for godliness
and vertue, and to banish impietie and
vice, he might chance to fall into a mischief
more intolerable thā the present
condition: the remedy might proove
worse than the disease.
            In nature wee see, that such a body
there may bee, in which all the blood
shall bee so corrupted, that, before a
man should find any good blood therin,
hee might (if he would use phlebotomy

draw out &amp; take away both the
life and last drop together: in such a
case, when the corruption is so grosse
and infinite, a skilfull Physician will use
Epicrasis, as they call it, labouring to
bring the body to a better tēperature.
He will draw from it at diverse times
and by diverse means; but yet hee will
take no more but what is needfull to
unburthen nature: which, beeing discharged,
gathereth vigour to it selfe again;
and evacuateth, by sweating and
other good meanes, the malignant humours,
&amp; at length cleanseth the blood
it self: so may 
                  •
                Prince, in these abundant
and superfluous humours of the
State, not presently open a vein, lest so
perhappes the spirits depart with the
blood, and the life goe away with the
strength, but by degrees; as hee may
displace corrupt Officers and Iudges,
and substitute better in their roomes:
and by this discretion, and Gods blessing
upon it, he shall see in a short time
a conversion of the body of the Common-wealth,

without any subversion
or trouble to it or in it; a new Kingdome,
and yet without any great novelty
or change.
            The shippe of Delos, so renowned in
antiquity for lasting many years and ages
without renewing, whence got it
that fame? but because, as soone as a
plank was in danger or beganne to rot,
they presently provided a new &amp; sound
one in the room thereof: And the safest
way to restore a decayed State, is,
To proceed by the same course; but
then there needs constancy and perseverance,
singalis matutinis, morning after
morning every morning.
            
            It is not one mornings work: but, as
Speed is required for such a work without
delay, and Diligence without remisnes;
so is Constancy, without intermission.
It is a common saying, that A new
besome sweepsclean; but it is a true one,
that The end crowns the work: for, to begin
well and then to give over, or to go
on by starts, and not with a constant
hand, is the next way to draw on a relapse;

which many times proves more
dangerous than the originall sicknesse.
Many, to win applause, or the better to
settle themselves in their regall or imperiall
Thrones, have begunne with
wholesome Lawes, and strict execution
of them: but, within a while they
have growne weary, either by despairing
the event would answer their purposes,
or by giving themselves over to
ease and pleasure; and so have lost both
their honour with men, and their reward
with God. But, as naturall motions
gather strength in moving: so a reformation
begun aright out of a conscience
of duty, and a zeal of goodnes,
though it finde some rubs and oppositions
at first; yet the farther it wades,
the more easie it findes the passage, and
the means more ready for the compassing
of what it intends.
            Had our King Henry, the last of that
name, continued the same course at the
last as at first he began with, in the worthy
execution of Empson &amp; Dudley, two
caterpillers of the State; he had doubtless

left more honour to his name, and
happely more treasure in his Coffers.
Had Nero held-out the residue of his
government suitably to his first five
years, hee might well have marched in
equall rank with the best Emperours:
but, beginning with an head of gold, &amp;
ending in feet of iron &amp; clay, hee now
stands registred amongst the monsters
of mankinde. It was constancy which
made Augustus truely to affirme of
Rome at his death, Lateritiam inveni,
marmoream reliqui; I found it Brick, and
left it Marble. It was constancy that erected
in every corner so many monuments
of honor to the memory of Traian,
that the great Constantine, succeeding
in the Empire about two hundred
years after, was wont to call him Herbam
parietariam, Pellitory of the wall.
And lastly, constancy it was, and houlding
on in an upright course to the end,
that made al Iudah and Ierusalem sorely
to mourn at the funerals of the good
King Iosiah; and the singing men and
women continually in succeeding ages

to remember his name in their lamentations;
Whereas it is recorded of
some other of that race, who had faire
&amp; glorious beginnings, but clowdy &amp;
durty endings, that they dyed without
being desired of the people: no man so
much as shed a teare at their funerals,
or wished them in beeing againe.
            I come from our Prophets diligence,
dispatch, and perseverance, to the worke
it selfe; I will destroy, I will cut off: where
a question offers it selfe, Whether it bee
lawfull, or no, to destroy; in what case it is
lawfull, and to whom it belongs? For the
commandement seemes to be generall,
Thou shalt not kill: and so doth the rule,
grounded upon the law of Nature, and
given before the Morall lawe, Who-so
sheddeth mans
                     •
                  blood, by man shall his blood
be shed: and the reason is added; For,
in the image of God made hee man, Gen. 9.
6. And to the lawe Naturall and Morall
is added the Evangelicall, All that
take the sword shall perish with the sword,
Mat. 26. 52: Which passages, notwithstanding
the peevishness of Anabaptisticall

interpretations following the
letter and not the sense, the rinde and
and not the pith, are not to be expounded
without many limitations and distinctions.
For the resolution then of
the question, we are to knowe, that in
three cases, which by some are held
unlawfull, it is lawfull to destroy; and
in three other cases, by othersome held
lawfull, is is unlawfull to destroy. It is
lawfull for a man to destroy another,
either Se defendenda, in defence of his own
person, or in a iust and lawfull warre, or by
the sword of the publique Magistrate.
            
            In defence of his owne person, in as
much as charity begins at home: and
being to love our neighbour but as our
selves, the love of our selves is the rule
of the love of our neighbour, and consequently
before it in nature; the rule
by which a thing is ruled and ordered,
being ever in nature before that which
is ruled and ordered by it. If then my
person bee violently assaulted, and my
life wrongfully indangered, it is not
onely lawfull but commendable, to indanger

or take away the assailants life,
for the preservation of mine owne:
but, if I can by any other meanes save
mine owne life without the taking away
of his; though it bee in the worlds
account reputed disgracefull, yet am I
in Christian charity to make choice of
that; which as it teacheth a man to preferre
his owne life before anothers: so
doth it also to preferre another mans
life before mine owne pretended or imaginary
reputation.
            Secondly, it is lawfull to destroy in
a just and lawfull warre: which is then
presumed so to be, when it is commanded
by the supreame Magistrate, either
for the revenging of outrages committed,
or for the repairing of injuries received,
or for the recovering of right
detained, or for defending of our own
countrey or religion, by the enemy
threatned. And though it were to bee
wished, that, among those who joyntly
professe the glorious name of Iesus,
none occasion were offered of destroying
one another and spilling of Christian

blood, but that they might all
joyne their hearts and hands together
in destroying the professed enemies of
that name: yet as long as covetousness
and ambition are admitted to Counsel,
as long as right is measured by might,
and private respects are made publique
quarrels; as long as the Bishop of Rome
the eldest sonne of that Abaddon or Apollion,
Revel▪
                9▪ which indeed signifies
a Destroyer, proudly challenges to himselfe
those words of Ieremy, 1. 10. I haue
this day set thee over the nations, and over
kingdomes, to root out, to pull downe, and to
destroy, as Pius Quintus expresly doth
in his declaratory Bull against Queene
Elizabeth of blessed memory, and is
therein not checked, but applauded by
Christian Princes; So long I say▪ such
a wish may well passe for an honest and
religious desire, though in reason it be
never likely to take effect: nay, wee are
sure that the grand Destroyer himselfe
is at last to be destroyed, even by those
Christian Princes whom he imployed
as instruments for the destruction of others.

               The ten hornes which thou sawest upon
the beast, are they that shall hate the
whore, and make her desolate, and naked,
and shall eate her flesh and burne her with
fire, for God hath put into their hearts to fulfill
his will, Revel. 17. 16. 17. Wee are
then to follow peace with all men; but
none otherwise then as peace is joyned
with holiness: for what peace can there
bee as long as the whoredomes and
witchcrafts of that Iezabel remaine yet
in such abundance? War then is to be
preferred to such a Peace, where a
Land may justly complaine,

                  —Longae pacis patimur mala: Saevior armis,
                  Luxuria incumbit—
               
            
            The third sort of Lawfull destroying
is, by the sword of the publique Magistrate,
in the execution of justice upon
notorious malefactors; for he beareth it
not in vaine, but is the minister of God
to take vengeance upon him that doth
evill, Rom. 13. 4. And of this it is that
our Prophet (being then by Gods ordinance
designed to be his Vice-gerent
on earth) chiefly speakes in this place,

               I will destroy, I will cut off. And with him
agrees the wise Salomon, Prov. 20. 26, A
wise King scattereth the wicked, and bringeth
the wheele over them. It is not onely
justice but wisedome, sometime to cut
off and destroy: First, that others may
thereby bee admonished to walk more
warily. Thus the disobedient sonne
must bee brought foorth and ston'd to
death, That all Israel might heare and fear,
Deut. 21. As the thunderbolt falleth
with the danger of fewe, but with the
feare of all: So Poena ad paucos, metus
ad omnes: the terror of publique executions
reacheth farther than the punishment;
for the feare extends to all,
but the punishment to few: and howsoever
it be true, that the better sort be
directed by love, yet the greater sort
are corrected by feare. A man that
stands by, and sees one that is wounded,
seared, or launced, is therby made
more carefull of his owne health: and
in like manner the beholding a malefactor
to be brought to deserved punishment,
makes men more wary how they

runne into the like courses. It was a
true saying in the generall of the Proconsull
to Cyprian at his martyrdome,
though ill applyed to him in particular,
In sanguine tuo caeteri discent disciplinam;
In thy blood the rest will learne
discipline.
            Secondly, the cutting off of the wicked
causeth the good to leade a more
quiet and peaceable life in godliness and honesty:
who if they should be permitted
to live and enjoy their liberty, wee
should neither meet quietly in our assemblies,
nor dwell quietly in our houses,
nor walke quietly in our streets, nor
travaile quietly in our wayes, nor labour
quietly in our fields. In better
tearmes stands that State where nothing,
then where all things are lawful:
and it is no lesse cruelty to spare all,
than to spare none. For, he that spares
one bad, thereby injuries many good:
which gave occasion to the Proverbe,
Foolish pitie marres the Citie; and to
the saying of Domitius, that hee had rather
seeme cruell in punishing, than

dissolute in sparing.
            Many, saith Saint Augustine, call
that cruelty, when for love of disciplin
the fault committed is revenged by
the punishment of the offender; whereas
the Sentence of him that punisheth
satisfieth the lawe, and redoundeth to
the good not onely of them that are
present, but even of them that are yet
unborne. So that severity used in this
case, Vtilitate publica rependitur, is payed
home and recompensed with publike
benefit. Yea, but though hee be a malefactor,
say some, yet is hee a personable
man, of an excellent wit, and
good parentage; and is it not pitie to
cast away such a man? To which may
justy be replyed, Is it not more pitie,
that a proper man should undoe a profitable
man, that a witty man should
hurt an honest man, that hee who hath
good parentage should spoile him that
hath good vertues to serve the Common-wealth?
To cut off such a wicked
person then by the stroake of justice,
is not to castaway a man; but to

preserve mankinde: and better it is,
Vt unus pereat quam ut unitas; that one
single person should suffer, than a whol
Society:

                  —Truncatur &amp; artus,
                  Vt liceat reliquis securum viuere m
                        •
                     bris.
               
            
            Thirdly, as by sparing wicked
and wilfull transgressors, the wrath
of God is provoked, and his judgements
pulled downe vpon a Nation:
So by cutting them off, as by an
acceptable sacrifice his wrath is appeased,
and his favour procured. If blood
were shed in the Land, and the murtherer
not put to death, the whol Land
was thereby defiled, and made lyable
to Gods displeasure, Num. 35. 33. When
Achan had stoln the consecrated thing,
the wrath of the Lord was so kindled
against all the Hoast of Israel, that they
could not stand, but were discomfited
before their enemies: but as soone as
Achan with those that belonged unto
him were stoned to death, the Lord
turned from his fierce wrath against Israel;
so that wheras, before, their enemies

chased and smote them, now they
atchieved many great and famous victories,
Ios. 7. So long as the murther
committed by Saul upon the Gibeonites
was unpunished, there was sent a
grievous famine upon the Land of Israell
three yeares together: but as soon
as Sauls seaven sonnes were hanged at
the motion of the Gibeonites, God
was appeased with the Land.
            Two notable examples to this purpose
we have recorded by Plutarch: the
one in the life of Romulus, the other of
Camillus. When Romulus K. of Rome, &amp;
Tatius K. of the Sabines, after cruell war
had made their cōposition to governe
the Romans &amp; Sabines joyntly, there fell
a strange kinde of plague and famine in
the Cities of Rome and Laurentum, for
two murthers committed by the Romans
and Laurentines: the one by the
kinsmen of Tatius upon certaine Embassadours
of Laurentum; which murder
Tatius neglected to punish: and the
other by the friends of the saide Embassadours
upon Tatius in revenge of

the injustice done by his kinsmen, and
suffered by him. Whereupon it being
noted that the plague and famine increased
strongly in both Cities, and a
common opinion conceived that it
was a punishment of God upon them
for those murthers committed and
not punished, they resolved to doe justice
upon the offenders: which being
once done, the plague ceased presently
in both places.
            The same Author likewise ascribeth
the Sack of Rome by the Gaules, to the
just judgement of God upon the Romans,
for two injustices done by them:
the first was the unjust banishment of
Camillus; the second, the refusall to punish
certain Ambassadors of their own,
who beeing sent to treate peaceably
with the Gaules, on the behalfe of the
Clusians, committed acts of hostility against
them, contrary to the lawe of
armes: And when the Gaules sent to
Rome to demand reparation of the injury,
the Romans not onely refused to
give them satisfaction; but also made

made their Ambassadours, who had
done the injurie, Generals of an Army
to assist the Clusians against them, notwithstanding
that the Foeciales (officers
ordained by Numa Pompilius to determine
of the lawfull causes of Peace
and Warre) made great instance to the
Senate, that the Ambassadours might
be punished, lest the penalty of their
fault might otherwise fall upon the
Common-wealth: as indeede it did.
For the Gaules, giving battel to the Ambassadors,
overthrew them; and prosecuting
their victory, spoyled and sacked
Rome it selfe, under the conduct &amp;
command of Brennus, their chief Leader,
and as some write a Brittain.
            
            Wherein I wish to bee noted, how
grievous a sinne it is in the opinion of
the very Paynims themselves, and how
dangerous to the Common-wealth, to
neglect and omit the punishment of
notorious malefactors, whereby the
offences of particular men are made
the sinnes of the whole State, and draw
the wrath and punishment of God upon

the same: And as upon the whole
State, so chiefly upon his person and
posterity to whose place and office it
belongs to see justice done. It is a true
saying, Iudex damnatur, cum nocens abs
                     •
                  luitur,
the Iudge is condemned when
the guilty is absolved; and Qui non vetat
peccare cum potest, iubet: He that doth
not restrain a man (when it is his duty,
and it lies in his power) doth command
him to sinne. He that saith to the wicked,
thou art righteous, him shall the
people curse, Prov. 24. 24. And in another
place, Hee that justifieth the
wicked is an abomination to the Lord,
17. 15. So that whereas they thinke by
this meanes to winne estimation with
men, they make themselves odious
both to God and men. Saul was punished
with the losse of his kingdome,
for not punishing Agag with death,
1. Sam. 15. And Ahab, for sparing Benhadab,
had a sharpe greeting sent him,
1. King. 20. Because thou hast let goe out of
thine hand a man whom I appointed to die,
thy life shall goe for his life, and thy people for

his people. And many times wee see by
experience, that a desperate wicked
man, reserved from due punishment,
proves a continuall vexation vnto him
that hath spared him: As, the nations
that inhabited the Land of Canaan, being
not cast out and destroyed by the
Israelites as God had commanded
them, became by his just judgement a
snare &amp; destruction unto them▪ a whip
on their sides, and a thorn in their eyes,
Ios. 23. 13. Iudges 2. 3.
         
         
            
            Verse 8.
I will earely destroy all the wicked of the
Land, that I may cut off all wicked doers
from the Citie of the Lord.
            HItherto of the three kindes of lawfull
destroying, by some phantasticall
and Anabaptisticall spirits held
unlawfull. Now, it remaines, that I
speake of three other unlawfull kindes
of destroying, by some irreligious and
profane spirits held lawfull; whereof,
the first is selfe homicide, the destroying
of a mans selfe, the cutting off the
threed of his owne life with his owne
hands. The second is, destroying of
another by Duel, in single combate;
whether hee send or accept the chalenge,
it matters not. The third, is the
destroying of a subject by the sword,
and at the command of a civill Magistrate,
onely for reason of State, or politique
respects, without due order of
law, or course of justice.
            First, then of the first; of the unlawfulness

of a mans destroying himselfe,
whether it bee for the shunning of
shame, or griefe, or misery, or sinne.
Our Prophet himself was often broght
into great distress, marvailous streights
&amp; plunges, both bodily and ghostly, as
may appear by his dolefull complaints
through-out this booke of Psalmes:
Yet would hee not destroy himselfe
thereby to bee ridde of them. Saul,
who would not destroy Agag, destroyed
himselfe: but David voweth
to destroy the wicked; himselfe
hee would not destroy. Paul, though
he had fightings without, and terrors
within, and desires to bee dissolved;
yet dissolve himselfe, or hasten his dissolution
hee would not. Iob, though
scourged with unmatchable chastisements,
yet he would not moove from
his station without his Generalls command,
he would not change himselfe,
but patiently wait all the dayes of his appointed
time, untill his changing came, 14. 14.
            It was a worthy speech which Iosephus
the Iew made to his Souldiers, being

in a cave, where they lay hid after
they lost the City Iotapata, taken by
Vespasian; they, rather than they would
bear the disgrace of being taken by the
enemy, would needs make an end of
themselves: like Fannius, of whom the
Poet,
Hîcrog
                     •
                  , Non furor est ne m
                     •
                  riare m
                     •
                  ri?
            
            Yet some might perhaps commend
this resolution: but what saith the good
Iosephus, to perswade them to the contrary?
The Almighty hath given unto us
our life as a most precious iewell: hee hath
shut it and sealed it up in this earthen vessel,
and given it us to bee kept, till hee himself 
                     〈◊〉
                  
ask for it againe: wee are neither to deny it
when hee shall require it, nor to cast it forth
till hee command it. Among other reasons
for which the Books of the Maccabees
are held Apocryphall, this is not
the least, that they commend 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                  
                his
destroying of himself, as a manfull and
noble act; whereas indeed it is the truest
signe of a minde truely 
                  〈◊〉
               ,
like a Cube to stand upright in all fortunes.
            
               Fortiter ille facit, qui miser esse potest.
            The second kinde of unlawfull destroying,
by too many held lawfull, is
the killing of another in Duel: not such
as our Prophet himself undertook with
Goliah the Philistine, by publike authority
from the State, and for the publike
good of the State; but when men for
private revenge, &amp; righting their conceived
or pretended wrongs, either
send or accept a chalenge for single
combate, all the Sope and Niter in the
world cannot wash away the guilt of
blood from this practice: whatsoever
men pretend heerin, either for the triall
of man-hood, or the putting-by the
imputation of cowardise, or for the
maintenance of reputation, it cannot
excuse in this case. And howsoever the
world applaud it many times with
tearms of worth, of gallantry, of brave
spiritednes, and the like; yet is it doubtless
no better than murder in Gods account;
and disloyalty to the civill Magistrate,
by wresting the sword out of
his hand, and taking his office from

him. Sin then against God is more to
bee feared, than shame amongst men;
and true Christianity to bee preferred
before the opinion of such fool-hardy
courage.
            Think not, I read a Lecture of basenesse:
since true valour consists not in
quarrelling &amp; brabbling for private injuries,
or in stabbing for a word of disgrace;
but in maintenance of Gods honour,
in preserving thy alleageance to
thy Prince, in safe-garding thy Countrey.
Hee may well bee reckoned among
Martyrs, who upon conscience
and knowledge engageth himself upon
these occasions.
            Was Augustus Caesar a coward in the
repute of the Heathen, when, receiving
a chalenge from Anthony, he returned
him this answer; that, if Anthony had a
disposition to dy, or were weary of his
life, there were waies enow else to
death besides that? The chalenge was
rejected, and yet his honour untainted.
            I will shut up this point with an excellent
speech of Bernards concerning

unjust fightings; and in that number I
esteem these: If in thy fighting thou hast a
minde to kill another man, and then art slain
fighting, thou diest a murtherer: if thou prevail,
and kill the other, thou livest a murtherer.
Whether then thou live or dy, beest conquered
or Conquerer, it is not good to bee a
murtherer. So that the conclusion is,
that, which way soever it fall out, murther
it is before God. Miserable for a
man to bee slaine, and so to goe to his
reckoning while hee is malitiously labouring
to take away anothers life: as
miserable, if hee kill, to bee continually
haunted with the guilt of blood. All
the fame and commendation of doing
it upon fair tearms, cannot countervail
that vexation.
            I have the rather touched this point,
for that it is one of the evils of our
times; many scarce accounting themselves
men, till they have made a braul,
and (like the Youngsters of Helkethhazzurim)
sheathed their swords in
their fellowes bowels: whereby the
Land is becomne a very Acheldama, a

Field of blood. The more are wee to
blesse God, who hath put it in the mind
of our David, not any way to countenance
these Cutters, but to range them
among those wicked ones whom hee
hath vowed to destroy and cut off.
            The third kinde of unlawful destroying,
by some held lawfull, is the cutting
off of a Subject by the sword, or at
the command of the civill Magistrate,
for politick or private respects, without
just cause and due desert. Almightie
God, who out of the earth moulded
man, and breathed into him the spirit
of life, might (as an absolute Lord of
life and death) take that breath againe
from him, &amp; turn him into dust, or into
nothing, at his pleasure: but his Vicegerents
on earth have no such transcendent
power; their commission beeing
confined to the rules of justice and religion:
the observation whereof is undoubtedly
the fairest and safest course
they can take. Vriah was Davids Subject:
yet when the King had cunningly
caused him to bee placed by Ioab in

the forefront of the battell, and upon a
sudden retreit to fall by the sword of
the Ammonite; in sense of this unjust
act hee afterwards cries out, Deliver me
from blo
                     •
                  d-guiltiness, O God. Naboth was
Ahabs Subject: yet, because Letters
were written in the Kings Name, and
his Seal was set to them for the putting
of Naboth to death, the Prophet Eliah is
bid to charge him with the murther;
Hast thou killed, and also taken possession?
Neither doth Ahab plead his power over
Naboth, or Naboths subjection unto
him; but, by humbling of himselfe,
seems to acknowledge his guiltiness.
            There is nothing that makes a man
to bee more accounted of amongst all
men, than, beeing accountable to no
man for his actions, so to carry himself
(specially in the destroying and cutting
off of men) as if he were ready to yeeld
account of his proceedings to all men.
There is nothing that wins more hearty
affection, and inward both reverēce
and obedience, than when a man may
uncontrouleably and without checke

doe what hee list, to doe no more than
what is lawful and justifiable.
            Nee tibi quid liceat, sed quid fecisse decebit,

               e domet respectus

            And as the Panegyrist speakes of The
                  
                     •

                  pia commodandi▪
non securitate peccandi, experiris. Wherunto
the strongest motive to induce a
minde possessed with the sense of religion
and the feare of God, is, that no
earthly throne is so high, but that it
hath a superior throne in heaven, from
which it was derived, to which it is subordinate,
and by which it must bee judged:
and the lesse it is lyable to humane
censure, the more strict and severe either
in this world, or in the next, or in
both, must it in reason expect the divine.
            Si genus humanum &amp; mortalia temnitis
arma,
            At sperate Deum memorem fandi at que
nefandi.
            
               Therfore our Prophet ads, I will destroy,
I will cut off: but whom? the wicked
of the Land, the workers of iniquity: which
is my third generall part, the Obiect upon
whō this severe justice is to be don.
            It is as great abomination, saith Salomon,
Prov. 17. 15, In the sight of God
to condemne the just, as it is to justifie
the wicked: And the Prophet Esay 5.
23, pronounceth as great a woe against
him that taketh away the righteousness
of the righteous from him, as against
him that iustifieth and absolveth the
wicked for a reward. As then speciall
care must be had, that the innocent do
not suffer with the guilty, or as the guilty:
So specially that their blood be not
spilt, and their life uniustly destroyed.
Know for certaine (saies the Prophet Ieremy)
that if yee put mee to death, yee shall
bring innocent blood upon your selves, and
upon this Citie, and upon the inhabitants
thereof, 26. 14. Thereby implying that
God would avenge his blood, not onely
upon the murtherers themselves,
but upon the people; the whole Land
should be guilty of it.
            
               
               Manasses was a 
                  〈◊〉
                murtherer, hee
shed innocent blood exceeding much,
till hee replenished Ierusalem from corner
to corner, 2. King. 21. But marke
how fearfully God revenges this sinne
in his posterity. In the dayes of Iehoachim,
the Lord sent against him bands
of the Chaldees, and bands of the Aramites,
and bands of the M
                     •
                  abites, and
bands of the Ammonites, and hee sent
them against Iudah to destroy it; For
the sinnes of Manasses, and for the inn
                     •
                  
                  cent
blood that hee had shed: as it is exprest
in the 24. of the same booke. Manasses
was dead and rotten long before this
time, yet wee see God had not forgotten
that sinne; but the whole Land
smarted in the third generation after
him. So likewise Ioash most unkindly
caused Zachariah the sonne of good Iehoiada
to be stoned to death, because he
reproved him for his Idolatry. But see
what followed. When the yeare was
out, the Hoast of Aram came uppe against
him, and they came against Iudah
and Ierusalem, and destroyed all the

Princes of the people, and sent all the
spoyle of them to the King of Damascus:
though the army of Aram came
with a small company of men, yet the
Lord delivered a very great army into
their hands. After this, the King himselfe
was smitten with great diseases,
and at last his owne servants conspired
against him, and slew him in his bed.
And the reason of all these fearefull
judgements is given there by the holy
Ghost, For the blood of the children of Iehoiada
the Priest.
            
            It is memorable, that which Procopius
an Historian reports, touching Theodorick
King of the Gothes; how that having
slain Bo
                     •
                  thius and Symmachus, two
both noble and innocent persons, the
guilt of that horrible fact cleaving
close to him, hee had a strong imagination
that the head of a certaine fish
which was set upon his table, was the
head of Symmachus, gaping and yawning
upon him: The very conceite
whereof struck him into such a quaking
fit, as was the beginning of an extreame

sickness, upon which he shortly
died.
            Now, as hee vowes to destroy the
wicked, and none but them: so doth
he all them; my fourth generall part,
His indifferent and unpartiall proceeding, I
will destroy all, I will cut off all. Not
that he thought it possible to root out
all; but that hee would doe his best to
leave none.
            The magistrate herein is to imitate
God, whose deputy he is, &amp; whose person
he represents: And as he communicates
with God in his name, so shold he
in his nature; Who without respect of persons
iudgeth according to every mans work,
1. Pet. 1. 17. Though Coniah were as the
signet upon his finger, yet would hee pluck
him thence, Ieremy 22. 24. And as his
practice is, so is his precept: Ye shall haue
one lawe, it shall be as well for the stranger,
as the borne in the countrey. The stranger
if hee deserve favour, must have it
as much as if hee were borne in the
countrey: and hee that is borne in the
countrey must be punished as severely

as if hee were a stranger.

               1. If a brother, if a daughter,

Asa, King of Iudah, is commended
for his uprightness in this respect,
that when Maacha, his owne mother,
committed Idolatry, hee would not
spare her, but deposed her from her Regency,
1. King. 15. And indeed it is truly
said, Iustitia non novit patrem, non
novit matrem, veritatem novit: Iustice
neither knoweth father, nor mother,
but onely the truth.
            It is reported by a late Traveller,

            This place hateth wickedness, loveth
peace, punisheth offences, preserveth
the lawes, honoureth the good; implying
that there should be no partiality
used, but every man should be proceeded
withall according to his deserts.
            To which purpose, was that memorable
speech of our King Henry the
fourth of that name; who when his eldest
son, the Prince, was by the L. chief
Iustice, for some great misdemeanors,
commanded and committed to prison,
hee thanked God that hee had both a
sonne of that obedience, and a judge of
such unpartiall and undanted courage.
            But Agesilaus was as much to blame,
who when hee commended a friend
of his to the Iudge, hee mooved him
that if his cause were good, hee would
absolve him for justice sake; if not, at
his motion: but howsoever the world
went, absolved hee must be bee; an ill

example of dangerous consequence, in
him who was to be a paterne of indifferent
justice to his inferiour Iudges:
among whom wee finde that too often
true, which the heathen Orator complained
of, in his times; Omnium Sermone
percrebuit, It is rife in every mans
mouth, In his iudiciis quae nunc sunt, pecuniosum
hominem quamvis sit nocens, neminem
posse damnari: That in these judgements
which are now-adayes, a monied
man though hee bee guilty, cannot
be condemned. Nihil tam sanctum quod
non violari, nihil tam munitum quod non
expugnari pecuniâ possit, There is nothing
so holy that may not be violated,
nothing so well fenced, that may not
bee overthrowne with money; the
lawes being made like unto cobwebs,
which catch and holde little 
                  •
               lyes, but
the great ones breake through them.
Blasphemy, and perjury, &amp; sacriledge,
and symonie, and extortion, and oppression,
and vsury, and exeessive bribery
passe currant; when petty theeverie
in case of extreame necessity is most

severely punished.
            The fif
                  •
                and last point I proposed, is
the End our Prophet proposeth to him
selfe of this great work heer vowed, It
is the purging of the Citie of the Lord:
whereby is meant Ierusalem. First, for
example to the whole Realme, it being
the Metropolis and head Citie of the
Kingdome, as also and principally by
reason the service of God, and the
exercise of religion, was in a speciall
mann
                  •
               r by divine ordinance tied unto
it: in which regard he cals it the Citie of
the Lord, as the Evangelist doth the holy
Citie, Mat. 4.
            This Citie was so large, that it con
               
                  ••••
               ed
of foure quarters▪ every one of
them by walles divided from another.
The first and highest was mount Sion:
in it was the Citie of David, called by

                  
                     •
                  osephus the superiour Citie, exceeding
strong in regard of the naturall
situation thereof. The second was
called the Daughter of Sion, because it
seemed to come out as it were of the
bosome of the other; and in this was

mount Moriah, whereupon the Temple
stood: This Citie was compassed
with a stronge wal
                  •
               , wherein stood
threescore Towres. The third was
beautified with many ample streets, &amp;
faire buildings, compassed with a wall
wherein were fourteen Towers. The
fourth was inhabited by all sorts of Artificers,
compassed with the third wall
which was twenty five cubits high, and
had in it fourescore and tenne strong
Towers. So populous withall it was,
that during the siege of the Romans in
the space of five monthes there were
slaine and died, as Iosephus there present
reports it, to the number of eleven
hundred thousand. Now, albeit in our
Prophets dayes this Citie was not yet
brought to this perfection, yet was it
then very spacious and populous: notwithstanding
which greatness of the
place and disordred multitude of the
inhabitants, yet by Gods helpe he undertakes
the reformation.
            It is a thing which we ought to bear
away: for, it meeteth with the idle
                  •
               ess

and litherness of many, who imagine
that it is impossible to reforme a great
City: yea, if it bee but a little market-town,
it is impossible (say they) that all
should bee well there. Yea, this excuse
is pretended by such as have but small
families in comparison: and so, under
a colour of this impossibility to reform
all, they doo almost just nothing; no,
not so much as the lawes put into their
hands, and command them to do. Yet
these men have but as it were a posterne
gate in Ierusalem to keep: what thinke
you would they doo, if they had the
charge of so great and large a City?
True it is, let Officers doo their best,
there will be much disorder: what wil
it bee then when they doo little or nothing,
in respect of any care to weed
out sinne? but rather bolster it out, take
part with leud companions, give them
countenance, speak and write for them,
yea keep them company; men fitte rather
to bee overseen and guided continually
by others, than to bee in authority
to see or guide any. But let such as

bee in office doo their duty, executing
the good lawes put into their hands by
higher authority, and then not doubt
of the impossibility of reforming abuses
in their lesser charges; seeing David,
trusting upon the help of God, is
so confident touching this great &amp; populous
City. Let them but put-to their
endeavours, and they shall finde such
success in the advancement of godlines
and suppressing of impiety, many times
even beyond hope and expectation, as
they wil see cause to rejoice in the performance
of their dutie, and to praise
God for his blessing upon it.
            Again: David, vowing to reforme
this City, meaneth not to stay there,
but to proceed to the cleansing &amp; purging
of the whole Land. This no doubt
hee might think, that if Ierusalem were
reformed, it would be a great light and
direction to the whole Kingdome: as
wee see how it falleth out; lesser places
look to those that be
                  •
                greater, and
the meaner sort look to those that be
                  •
               
higher, frō whom also there is 
                  〈◊〉
               
               
force to draw inferiours either to good
or evill.
            Above maiori discit ar are minor.
            A great towne or a great house well
ordered may fitly bee compared to a
great garden ful of sweet flowrs, which
yeeldeth much good 
                  •
               avour and prospect
to the neighbours: if they bee ill
ordered, they bee like great dunghills,
noysome and contagious to such as
dwell about. A great towne or a great
Personages house, if they bee good, do
much good to the Countrey: but, if
they bee naught and sinfull, the poison
of them is strong, and the infection dā
               gerous.
            It is then a work worthy a King, to
beginne the reformation of his State,
with purging the head-city of his
Kingdome: where, by reason of the
confluence of forren nations &amp; all sorts
of people, vice must needs abound; but
specially, because head-cities (for the
most part) by Monopolies, and Companies,
and Corporations, and I knowe
no
                  •
                
               
                  •
               hat devices, labour to drawe to

themselves the whole treasure of the
Land: and if the blood should all bee
drawn from the other members to the
head, it would both distēper the head,
and starve the members. The head-city
then is so to bee respected, that inferiour
cities and towns bee not neglected;
but an indifferent hand to bee extended
to them al, lest one in time swallow
the other, as the greater fishes devour
the lesser.
            The last thing wee are to observe, is,
that hee would begin his reformation
in the City of the Lord. Of the Lord.
His meaning is, with matter of religion;
it beeing therefore called the City
of the Lord, because, as hee had chosen
the Land of Canaan out of all the
world to bee the portion of his people▪
so out of all Canaan hee chose Ierusalem,
to place his Name and Tabernacle
there (the Temple beeing not yet
built) and in the Tabernacle the Arke
of the Covenant; a speciall sacrament
of his presence. This, our Prophet expresseth
yet more cleerely in another

Psalm, 122. 9, Because of the house of the
Lord our God, I will seeke to d
                     •
                  o thee good.
Among other main and waighty matters
then pertaining to the Princes
charge, the care of GOD's truth and
Church must bee the chiefest. For,
should the bodies, goods and credits
of men bee preserved; and the honour
and glory of GOD bee neglected?
Should earthly ease bee so much in request;
and heavenly bliss so little in desire?
Feare wee the ruine of all things,
where injuries and violences by men
are not repressed by the princes sword;
and doubt wee no danger where idolatry,
heresie, ath e
                  •
               sm and blasphemie against
God, goe unpunished? Is Gods
hand shortned, that hee cannot strike?
or his will altered, that hee will honour
those that dishonour him, and blesse
them that hate him?
            It is a Romish errour, repugnant to
the word of God, and to the examples
of the best Kings and Monarchs before
and since Christ, to restraine Princes
from protecting and promoting the

true worship of GOD within their
Realms. Neither hath the man of sin
more grosly betraid his pride and rage
in any thing, than in abasing the honor,
and abusing the power, and impugning
this right of Princes, by making them
his Bailiffs and Sergeants to attend and
accomplish his will, and not meddle
with supporting the truth, or reforming
the Church farther than hee listeth;
that, whiles they command their
subjects bodies, hee might command
their soules, the better half: which,
commanding the body, wil quickly upon
occasion draw that after it; as reason
shewes, and experience teacheth.
            It is rightly observed, that, after the
Bishop of Rome had once fully engrossed
the Imperiall power, there was
never since Emperour of strength, or
Pope of vertue: so they lost both by it.
And indeed, as the blood, if it fall any
way out of the veins too much, there is
some danger; but, if it fall into the body
extra vasa, there is more danger, for
it will corrupt and putresie: so was it

with the supreme authority of Princes,
when they suff
                  •
               red it to fall into the
Clergy, as it were extra vasa: but their
Scepters and Thrones, allowed them
by God, are sufficient proofs that they
may and must make lawes and execute
judgement, as well for godliness and honesty
(which by the Apostles rule are
within the compass and charge of their
Commission) as for peace and tranquillity.
God hath given them two hands,
to be Custodes utriusque tabulae; Vpholders
of both the tables: from observing
this, no man may drawe them; since
for neglecting this, no man shall excuse
them.
            They must not be careful in humane
things, and carel
                  •
               sse in divine: God
ought to be served and honoured by
them, that is, by their Princely power
and care, as much afore men, as his
truth and glory excelleth the peace and
w
                  •
               lfare of men. It wanteth many degrees
of a Christian government to
look to the keeping of things that must
perish, and to leave the soules of men

as an open prey to impiety and irreligion.
And if Princes provide not this
for their Subjects, peace, and traffique,
and such like makes no better provision
for them, then is made for Oxen in
good pasture; nay, not so good. For
an Oxe hath therein all hee needeth;
but a man without this left altogether
unprovided in his farre nobler and better
part.
            And as Princes without this Care
provide not well for their people: so
they provide but ill for themselves, in
as much as they can have no certaine
assurance of the loyalty and allegeance
of their subjects without it; since nothing
can cast a sure knot on the cōscience
for the firme binding of it, but the
true knowledge and feare of God. So
that where Princes advance the good
of Gods house, they establish the good
of their owne all in one.
            Lastly, it is to be observed, that in all
the Kings of Israel and Iudah, their stories
beginne with this observation, as
with a thing worthy to be chronicled

in the first place, how they dealt in matter
of religion. Such a King, and such
a King: and what did he? Hee did that
which was right in the sight of the
Lord; and such a King, hee walked in
the wayes of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat.
I spare to cite places: but it is the
generall observation of those books of
Kings and Chronicles; as they that reade
them knowe: yea farther, it may bee
marked, that God hath alwaies humbled
Princes, &amp; even powred contēpt
upon them, when they have contemned
the messengers and forsaken or forgotten
the house of the Lord.
            For the preventing whereof, it shall
not be amisse for them to consult with
Church-men, specially in Church affair
                  •
               s;
as the wise, the good King David
in all his weighty businesses, but
specially in matters touching religion
and the service of God, still used the
counsell and direction either of Gad or
Nathan, Prophets, or of Abiathar and
Hiram, chiefe Priests. It went wel with
Ioash, as long as Iehoiada his trusty Counseller

lived: but when Iehoiadah died,
the Kings goodnesse dyed with him.
Then came the Princes of Iudah, and
made obeisance to the King, and the
King hearkened unto them, and they
left the house of the Lord God of their
Fathers, and served Groves and Idols,
and wrath came upon Iudah and Ierusalem,
because of this their trespasse,
2. Chron. 24. 17. 18.
            Give the King thy iudgements O God, and
thy righteousness unto the Kings Son.
