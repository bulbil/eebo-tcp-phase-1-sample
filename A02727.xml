            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               Brethren, my hearts desire and prayer to God for Israel, is, that they might be saved.
               Rom. 10.1.
               For I would not (Brethren) that ye should be ignorant of this secret; that partly obstinacie is come to Israel, untill the fulnesse of the Gentiles be come in: and so all Israel shall be saved (as it is written &amp;c.)
               Rom. 11.25.
               And Ierusalem shall be troden under foot of the Gentiles, untill the time of the Gentiles be fulfilled.

               Even to this day, when Moses is read, the vayle is laid over their hearts: neverthelesse, when their heart shall be turned to the Lord, the vayle shall be taken away.

               Verely, I say unto you, ye shall not see me, untill the time come that ye shall say, Blessed is he that commeth in the name of the Lord.

               Most High and mightie Prince,
            
            
               THis Treatise was published seven yeares agoe, and Printed in the Low-Countries; not long after the death of that noble Prince Henry my master: And for that, and some other reasons, Dedicated to those high and honourable personages; as by the Epistle following may appeare. The same reasons have moued me to revise it, and publish it a new, vnder the Protection also of your Maiestie and Royall Issue; that most hopefull yong Prince; cujus e

The other reason, for that the Iewes also (whom this argument chiefly concerneth) many of them remaine in your Maiesties Dominions: whereof in time your Maiestie, or Royall Issue (as may be hoped) raised vp of God for that very purpose, may be a happy instrument; as of the finall desolation of that Mysterie of Iniquitie Babylon: so consequently of the finishing of that Mysterie of Godlinesse; even the conversion of the Iewish Nation, the very period of all Prophecies. And then (as Iohn concludeth his Revelation) come Lord Iesu. He which testifieth these things saith, surely, I come quickly, Amen. Even so come Lord Iesu. Amen, Amen.

               FOR two reasons I haue made bold to present unto your high and honourable considerations this Treatise following. The one more particular, in respect of that intyre amitie, and correspondence, which was betwixt my deare Master deceased Prince Henrie, of famous memorie, and your Exce

And that your princely Brother (alter idem, an other Henry, cujus ego nomine ipso recreor, even for my Masters sake, that gone is, and for that affection he sh

such heroicall spirits. An other reason is, for that the persons whom this Argument chiefly concerneth, to wit, the Iewes, many of them remaine in your Countrie, and haue their habitation in peace and safetie: not in that slaverie as in other Nations, accounted of in the basest maner that may be, in the number of dogs rather then of Men. Which though it haue fal

               What is then the preferment of the Iew (saith he) much euery maner of way. For to them apperteineth the adoption,
               Rom. 9.4. 
               and the glorie, and the covenants, and the giving of the Law, and the service of God, and the Promises: of whom are the Fathers, and of whom concerning the flesh Christ came, &amp;c. And in that respect we Gentiles ought not so proudly and tyrannously to insult over them (as many doe) especially Christians of all others, should not adde affliction to affliction: but rather pitie and bewaile their induration (as Paul doth in the place before cited) expecting with patience their conversion in due time, as the Lord hath promised: for if God himselfe loue them being his enemies (for they are beloved (as I said before) for the Fathers sake, as he loved us before our conversion (when we were his enemies he loved us: so the Apostle testifieth) why should we Christians hate and abhorre them, who are so highly in Gods account (even the beloved of the Lord) and hold them in such disgrace and contempt as we doe: as in my sma
                  •
               l observation, and experience, I am able to testifie, both by that I have seene and heard: which rather exasperateth them against our profession then otherwise. Which harshnesse and uncharitablenesse of ours; together with the Idolatrie, and superstition of the Church of Rome, in worshipping of Images, and such like tromperie, I am perswaded, haue beene two maine obstacles to their conversion hitherto: as some of them in Barbarie objected to me, saying: the Christian Religion could not be the true Religion, for that it alloweth the worshipping of images, which is expresly against the Law: Thou shalt not make to thy selfe

any grauen Image. And if we say they crucified Christ, and therefore we hate and abhorre them, even to the third and fourth generation, that is to say, their posterity for ever: so doe we daily by our crying sinnes, euen crucifie againe the Lord Iesus, they but once and unwittingly (as Saint Peter testifieth) we often, and that both wittingly,Act. 3.17. and willingly, to our greater condemnation, in respect of the fulnesse of knowledge we haue in the Messiah. This is that fulnesse of the Gentiles, already come in (whereof the Apostle long since prophecied) as in knowledge abounding, so in sinne super-abounding, and that generally through out all Nations. Of whom I doubt much whether I may say (as it was said in times past of the Amorites as touching their fulnesse) it was not yet come: for I am sure the fulnesse of the Gentiles (as touching sinne) is already come: fulnesse of Bread, and aboundance of Idlenesse, as in Sodome: yea fulnesse and loathsomnesse, even of Manna it selfe: as the children of Israel in the end waxed wearie of that heavenly foode, so is it with us in respect of the foode of our soules. Else what meaneth so many Sects, and Schismes in our Church at this day? Diseases arising from some bad humours and corruptions in the body (as all diseases doe) which therefore ought to be purged. Surely the varietie of the one argueth a fulnesse and sacietie of the other. We are fallen from the names of Christians,
               Act. 11.26. given to the Primitiue Church, to be baptized into new names; Anabaptists, Arminians, &amp; id genus farinae: Corne I may not call them, but chaffe: yea,Mat. 13.24 rather tares sprung up with the good Corne, over-spreading, and over-topping it too in many places: but both must grow together till the harvest. Yea, our fulnesse and nicenesse is such, as we can taste no maner of meat almost, but what some curious cookes for the nonce provide for us: every one must have a cooke for his owne palate. We are fallen into that time fore-prophecied by the Apostle, 2. Tim 4. For the time will come when they will not suffer wholesome Doctrine, but having their eares itching, shall after their owne lusts get them a heape of Teachers. We are even wearie of Manna, as the children of

Israel were. And therefore now that they haue fasted so long time, and that fulnesse of the Gentiles come upon us; it standeth both with the Lords justice and his mercie, both to us and them, to doe to them as he did to us at the first,Rom. 11.22 and to us as he did to them. Behold therefore the bountifulnesse and the severitie of God, toward them which have fallen severitie, but toward thee bountifulnesse, if thou continue in his bountifulnesse, or else thou shalt also be cut off: and they also if they abide not still in unbeliefe shall be graffed in, for God is able to graffe them in againe.

And therefore least any one should accuse me hereafter of secret theft; I doe ingeniously acknowledge before hand with the Poet: Fateor me transtulisse. But yet with many additions, and alterations of my owne, I have made it of right (as it were my owne, without any wrong to the Author.

            THE MESSIAH ALREADIE COME.
            
               First for the promises and prophecies of old as touching the coming of a Messiah, whom we call CHRIST, both they and we agree, both of us reading dayly in our Churches &amp; Synagogues, teaching &amp; holding for canonicall the verie self same Scriptures, euen the Law and the Prophets. In so much that the Gentile is oftentymes enforced to marvile, whē he seeth a people so extreāly bent one against another, as the Iewes are against Christians, and yet doe stand so peremptorily in defence of those verie principles, which are the proper causes of their disagreement. But in the interpretation &amp; application thereof ariseth all the controversie, they understanding and applying all things literally and carnally to their long looked for Messiah yet for to come, we after a spirituall maner understanding all those promises and prophecies to be most truly and really fulfilled in the person of our blessed Mesiah, alreadie come, they expecting a temporall King, to rule and conquer in this world, we acknowledging a spirituall King, whose kingdome is not of this world, as himself did many tymes protest, while he was in the world: My kingdome is not of this World. To beginne with Adam and so forward.
            
               Gods Promise to Adam.
               THe first promise as touching the Messiah is this made to Adam after his fal, for the restoring of mankind, to witte that the seed of the woman should breake the serpents head,
                  Gen. 3, 15. that is to say one of her seed to be borne in tyme should conquer the divel death and sinne, as the auncient Iewes understand this place, which being a spirituall conquest and against a spirituall enemie the divel, he (I meane the Messiah) must needs be a spirituall, and

consequently not a temporall King, as the Iewes imagine.
            
            
               Gods Promise to Abraham.
               THe second to Abraham Isaack &amp; Iaacob often repeated. To Abraham Gen. 12.3. In thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed. To Isaack Gen. 26.4. In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed. To Iaakob Gen. 28.14. In thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed. Therefore the Gentiles aswell as the Iewes, the blessing is generall without exception, all the families of the earth, all nations, no prerogatiue of the Iewe, no exception of the Gentile, as touching the Messiah, I meane the benefit of this so generall and great a blessing, though otherwise much everie waye, as the Apostle reasoneth to the Romans.Rom. 3, 2. Rom. 9.4. Whereupon I inferre as before, that the Messiah must be a spirituall and not a temporall King: otherwise it had been but a verie small benediction to Abraham, or others after him (who neaver sawe their Messiah actually) if he must haue been onely a temporall King, and much lesse blessing had it been to us Gentiles, if this Messiah of the Iewes must haue been a worldly and a temporall Monarch, to destroy and subdue all those Nations formerly blessed (and blessed shall they be) to the servitude of Iurie, as the later Teachers doe imagine.
            
            
               The Prophecie of Iaakob.
               THe third (which confirmeth the former) is the prophecie of Iaacob at his death Gen. 49.10. The rodde or scepter shall not depart from Iudah, nor a Lawgiver from between his feet, till Shiloh come and the people or nations shall be gathered vnto him. Which the Chaldie Paraphrase, as also Onkelos, both of singuler authoritie among the Iewes, doe interpret thus. Vntill Christ or the Messiah come (which is the hope and expectation of all nations, aswell Gentiles as Iewes) the government shall not cease in the house or Tribe of Iuda. Whence I inferre the same conclusion as before, that if the Messiah must be the hope and expectation, aswell of the Gentiles as of the Iewes, then can he not be a temporall King to destroy the Gentiles, as the later Iewes would haue it, but a spirituall King, as before hath been declared.
               Secondly, if the temporall Kingdome of the house of Iuda whereof the Messiah must come, shall cease and be destroyed a
                     •
                  
                  
his comming, and not before, that being a certayne signe of the tyme of his manifestation, how then can the Iewes expect yet a temporall King for their Messiah, the scepter alreadie departed &amp; gonne, their kingdome and priesthood defaced, their citie and temple destroyed, themselues scattered amongst all nations, and so haue continued almost this sixteene hundreth yeeres, yea such a fatall and finall desolation by Gods just judgment brought upon that wofull Nation, &amp; that not many yeares after the death and passion of our Saviour Iesus Christ,Luk. 19.42. according to his prophecie in his life tyme, as may fully settle our fayth in this poynt.
            
            
               The Prophecie of Moses.
               THe fourth is that of Moses to the people of Israel,Deu. 18.1
                        •
                     
                   
                  The Lord thy God will rayse up unto thee a Prophet like unto me, from among you, euen of thy bretheren, unto him ye shall hearken, &amp;c. and in the verses following,ver. 18. 
                  I will rayse them up a prophet from among their bretheren like unto thee (sayth God to Moses) and will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speake unto them all that I shall command him, and whosoever will not hearken unto my words, which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him. Which words cannot be understood of any other Prophet that ever lived after Moses amongst the Iewes, but onely of the Messiah, as appeareth most playnly in another place in Deutro. where it is sayd,Deu. 34.10 
                  There arose not a Prophet in Israell like unto Moses, whom the Lord knewe face to face, in all the miracles &amp; wonders which the Lord sent him to doe, &amp;c. no such Prophet except the Messiah ever after to be expected: but the Messiah, he it is that must match and overmatch Moses everie waie, he must be a man as Moses was in respect of our infirmities, euen according as the people of Israel themselues desired the Lord in Horeb, saying, let me heare the voyce of the Lord God no more, nor see this great fire any more,
                  Deu. 18.26, 
                  that I dye not. And the Lord sayd unto Moses, they haue well spoken, I will rayse them up a Prophet from among their bretheren, like unto thee, &amp;c. He must be a Lawgiver, as Moses was, but of a farre more perfect Law, as hereafter shall appeare, he must be such a one whom the Lord hath knowne face to face, as he did Moses, but of a far more divine nature. For as it is in Esay,Esa. 53.8. 
                  Who shall declare his age? Lastly, he must be approved to the World by miracles, signes, and wonders, as Moses was, which the Lord shall send him to doe, as he did Moses. But no such Prophet hath ever yet appeared in the

world, not ever shall, who hath so fitly answered this type, so perfectly observed the Law of Moses (which Moses himself could not doe) giving us in stead thereof a farre more excelent Law, as was prophecied long before that he should. And finally, so miraculously approued himself to the world, to be sent from God, by signes and wonders donne both by himself &amp; his Apostles, as hereafter shall appear) except this Christ which we professe, therefore he alone is the true Messiah and no other to be expected
            
            
               The Prophecie of David.
               THe fift, is the prophecie of David, a type also of the Messiah, who for that he was a holy man, a mā after Gods own heart, out of whose linage the Messiah was to come, had this mysterie most manifestly reveiled unto him, for the assurance whereof as of a great mysterie, euen that of Christ and his Church, God byndeth himself by an oath saying,Psal. 89.3. 
                  I haue made a covenant with my chosen, I haue sworne unto David my servant, thy seed will I stablish for ever, and set up thy throne from generation to generation, Selah. Which words although the later Iewes will apply to King Salomon (and so in some sorte they may, for that he was also a type of the Messiah) yet properly these words, I will stablish the throne of his kingdome for ever,
                  2 Sam. 7.13 so often repeated, cannot be verified of Salomon, whose earthly Kingdome was rent and torne in pieces, streight after his death,1 Kin. 12. by Ieroboam, and not long after, as it were extinguished, but they must needs be understood of an eternall King and kingdome, as must also those other words of God in the psalme: Thou art my sonne this day haue I begotten thee,
                  Psal. 2.7. 
                  aske of me, and I will giue thee the Heathen for thyne inheritance, &amp; the ends of the earth for thy possession, Thou shalt crush them with a rod of yron, and breake them in pieces like a p

                        •
                     l, which prophecie was never fulfilled in Salomon, nor in any other temporall King in Iewrie after him. And much lesse this that followeth, They shall feare thee as long as the sunne and moone endureth from generation to generation.
                  Psal. 72, 5. 
                  In his daies shall the righteous flourish,
                  ver. 7. 
                  and abondance of peace so long as the moone endureth. His dominion also shall be from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth, They that dwell in the wildernesse shall kneele before him, and his enemies shall lick the dust. The Kings of Tharshish and of the yles shall bring presents, the Kings of Sheba and Seba shall bring gifts, yea all Kings shall worship him,
                  ver. 17. 
                  all nations shall serue him. His name shall be for ever, his

name shall indure as long as the sunne, all Nations shall be blessed in him, and shall blesse him. And blessed be the Lord God, euen the God of Israel which onely doth wonderous things. And blessed be his glorious name for ever, and let all the earth be filled with his glorie, Amen, Amen. And so he endeth as it were in a traunce, ravished beyond measure, with the sweet and heauvenly contemplation of this spiritual and everlasting kingdome of the Messiah, for to him and to no other can all these circumstances and hyperbolicall speaches of David (rapte with the spirit of prophecie) properly and primarily apperteyne, though literally the Iewes understand them of Salomon, as they doe many other places in like case, applying them onely to the type, never looking to the substance, whereof those types and figures were but shadowes and semblances, God of his mercie in his good tyme take away the vayle from their hearts, that at length they may see the true Salomon in all his royaltie, not any longer to grope at noone dayes, wincking with their eyes against the cleare sunne like their forefathers, as it is in Esay: a most fearefull judgment of God layd upon that Nation of old, objected to them many tymes and oft, both by Christ and his Apostels, but in vayne, goe and say unto this people, ye shall heare indeed but shall not understand, ye shall playnly see and not perceiue,
                  Esai. 6.

                     . 
                  make the heart of this people fatte, make their eares heavie, and shutte their eyes, least they see with their eyes, and heare with their eares, and understand with their hearts, and convert and be healed. Whereupon ensueth (euen upon this wincking and wilfull obstinacie) a most severe denunciation of finall desolation. Lord how long (sayth the Prophet) and he answered untill the cities be wasted without inhabitant, the houses without a man, and the land be utterly desolate, &amp;c. But yet a tenth reserved to returne, a holy seed remayning in due tyme to be converted. This judgment and desolation, hath been along tyme upon them, they feel it and groane under the burden of it, as their forefathers did in Egypt under Pharaoh, &amp; yet wincking shutte their eyes and will not see it, I meane, acknowledge the true cause of these so great judgments revealed from heauen upon thē, euen the contempt of Gods holy Prophets sent unto them from tyme to tyme, but especially of the Messiah, whose blood lyeth heavily upon them, euen to this day, as their forefathers desired, his blood be upō us &amp; on our children, which all the world seeth is come to passe, yea they themselues feele it, yet wincking with their eyes

they will not see it. But there is a tenth to returne &amp;c. The rest which will not this their Messiah to raigne over them, let them look into that parable in the Gospel, there shall they finde a farre more fearefull destruction denounced then the former. The first being but for a tyme, but a type of the other, but a beginning of woes, the other eternall, for ever and ever. The first he pronounceth with teares over Ierusalem, the second he denounceth as an angrie Iudge, provoked at length to execute his fierce wrath upō them, without any compassion at all. His words are these: Moreover, those mine enemies, which would not that I should raigne over them, bring them hither,
                  Luc. 19, 27. 
                  and slay them before me. Which words of our Saviour although they will in no wise beleeve, no more then they did the former, yet shall they find his words one daye, as truly fulfilled to them in the one, as they haue done alreadie in the other. And howsoever hitherto they haue esteemed of him as a false prophet, a deceiver, yet hath he been to them but too true a Prophet in all their calamities both first and last. And so after this long digression I come to the next.
            
            
               The Prophecie of Ieremie.
               THe sixt, which confirmeth the former, is that of Iere. 23, 5. Behold the dayes come sayth the Lord, that I will rayse up unto David a righteous braunch, and a King shall raigne, &amp;c. And this is the n
                        •
                     me whereby they shall call him, the Lord our righteousnes.
               
               This was spoken of Davids seed aboue 400 yeeres after David was dead and buried, which proveth manifestly, that the former promises were not made unto him for Salomon his sonne, or any other temporall King of his line, but onely for the Messiah, who was called so peculiarly the sonne and seed of David.
            
            
               The Prophecie of Ezechiel.
               THe seauenth, which also confirmeth the other, is that of Ezec. 34.23. I will set up ashepheard over them, he shall feede them, euen my servant David, &amp;c. In which words the Iewes themselues doe confesse, in their Talmud, that their Messiah is called by the name of David, for that he shall discend of the seed of David, and so it must needs be, for that King David being dead so long before, could not now come againe in his owne person to feed them him self.
            
            
               
               The Prophecie of Isaie.
               THe eight, is the prophecie of Isaiah, 2.2. It shall be in the last dayes, that the mountayne of the house of the Lord shalbe prepared in the toppe of the mountaines, and shall be exalted aboue the hilles, and all nations shall flowe unto it, &amp;c. for the Law shall goe forth of Syon, and the Word of the Lord from Ierusalem. He shall judge among the Nations. Which verie words Michah repeateth, cap. 4.1. and are applyed there as also here unto the Me

There shall come a rod forth of the stock of Ishai, and a graffe shall growe out of his root, &amp; the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him. Behold your God cometh &amp;c. Then shall the eyes of the blynd be lightned, and the eares of the deaf shall be opened, then shall the lame man leape like a hart, and the dumme mans tongue shall sing, &amp;c. chap. 35.4.

               Out of all which places before aledged, I conclude, first the cō
                  ming of a Messiah, which the Iewes will not denie: secondly, that he must be King aswell of the Gentiles as of the Iewes, which they cannot deny: thirdly that he must be a spirituall and not a temporall king, as they imagine. It followeth next to be proved, that he must be both God and man, euen the sonne of God: the second person in Trinitie to be blessed for evermore, which also they shall not deny.
            
            
               That the Messiah must be both God and Man.
               The Iewes at the first agreed with us in all or most poynts as touching the Messiah for to come, denying onely the fulfilling or application thereof in our Saviour, but since the later Iewes finding themselues not able to stand in that issue against us, they haue devised a new plea, saying, that we attr

                     •
                  e manie things unto Iesus, that were not foretold of the Messiah to come, namely, that

he should be God, and the sonne of God, the second person in Trinitie, which we will proue both by Scriptures, as also by the writings of their own forefathers. For Scriptures, it is evident by all (or the most) alledged before, that the Messiah must be God, euen the sonne of God, indued with mans nature, that is, both God and man. So in Genesis, where he is called the seed of the woman, it is apparant he must be man, and in the same place, where it is sayd, he shall breake the serpents head, who can doe this but onely God? So in Isay,Isai. 4.2. where he is called, the budde of the Lord, his Godhead is signified, and when he is called the fruit of the earth, his Manhood.Isa. 7, 14. And so in an other place. Behold a virgine shall conceiue and beare a sonne, and thou shalt call his name Immanuel, that is to say. God with us, which name can agree to none, but to him that is both God and man. And who can interpret these speeches, that his kingdome shall be everlasting Isa. 9. That his name shall be for ever, 
                        •
                     it shall indure as long as the sunne and the moone, That all Kings shall worship him, all nations serue him, Psal. 72. worship him all ye Gods, Psal. 97. that no man can tell his age, Isai. 53. that he must sitte at the right hand of God. Psal. 110. Who, I say, can understand or interpret them but of God, seeing in man they cannot be verified, with which place of Scripture the Euangelists doe report, that Iesus did put to silence divers of the learned Pharises: for, sayth he, if the Messiah be Davids sonne, how did David call him Lord? signifying, thereby, that albeit he was to be Davids sonne, as he was man, yet was he to be Davids Lord as he was God, and so doe both Rab. Ionathan, and their owne publique commentaries interpret this place. Michah is plaine,Micah. 5.2. 
                  His going forth is from the beginning, and from everlasting, And Isay is bold to proclaime him by his owne name, euen God, and to giue him his right stile, with all his additions, (as Herolds to great Kings and Princes use to doe) he shall call his name, Wonderfull, Councellor, the mightie God, the everlasting Father,
                  Isai. 9.6. 
                  the prince of peace, &amp;c. In vayne therefore is that objection of the Iewes, that El, or Elohim, signifying God, is sometymes applyed to a creature, here it cannot be so, nor in the next place following, Psal. 45.6. Thy throne o God is for ever and ever, &amp;c. Wherefore God euen thy God hath anoynted thee with the oyle of gladnes ab
                        •
                     ue thy fellowes, which cannot be applied to Salomon, but as a type of the Messiah. Howsoever the name IEHOVA which is of such reverence among the Iewes, that they dare not pronounce it, but

in place thereof read Adonai, that I am sure they will never grant to belong to any creature. Then what say they to that of Ier. 23.6. where the Messiah is called in plaine termes Iehovah, And this is the name whereby they shall call him, Iehovah our righteousnes. So likewise, chap. 33.16. over againe is he called by the same name Iehovah our righteousnes. And so doe the auncient Iewes themselues expound this place, namely, Rabbi Abba, who asketh the questiō what the Messiah shall be called, and answereth out of this place, he shall be called the Eternall Iehovah. The like doth Misdrasch. upon the first verse of the 20 Psalme. And Rabbi Moyses Hadersan, upon Gen. 41: expounding that of Zephanie 3.9. concludeth thus: In this place Iehovah signifieth nothing els but the Messiah, and so did one of the Iewes at unawares acknowledge to me, alledging that place out of the Psalmes, the Lord doth build up Ierusalem &amp;c. that their Messiah at his coming should build a new citie and Sanctuarie, much more glorious then the former. So did he also interpret that place of Hagg. 2.10. of a third temple. Whereupon I inferred, seeing in those words he alledged, the Lord doth builde vp Ierusalem, the Hebrew word is Iehovah, therefore by his own interpretation the Messiah must be Iehovah which he could not well shifte off, but sayd that Adonai (for Iehovah they dare not name) must there be understood, which point of the Godhead of the Messiah the most auncient Iewes did ever acknowledge proving by sundrie places of Scripture, not onely that he should be the sonne of God, but also the word of God incarnate.
               First that he should be the sonne of God, they proue out of Gen. 49.10. The scepter shall not depart, &amp;c. till Shiloh come. Which Rabbi Kinhi proveth to signifie his sonne, that is the sonne of God. Out of Isai,Isai. 4.2. where he is called the budde of the Lord. Out of the Psalmes,Psal. 2.7. where it is sayd, thou art my sonne, this day haue I begotten thee. And a litle after kisse the sonne least he be angrie, and ye perish, blessed are all they that trust in him, which last words cannot be understood of the sonne of any man, for it is written, Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, Ier. 17.5.
               Secondly, that he shalbe the Word of God, they proue out of Isay, as also out of Hosea,Hose. 1, 7. where it is sayd, I will saue them by the Lord their God. Ionathan translateth it thus, I will saue thē by the Word of their God. So where it is sayd, The Lord sayd to my Lord,

                  He sent his Word and healed them. Rabbi Isaack Arama, upon Gen. 47. expoundeth it to be meante of the Messiah, that shall be Gods Word: So likewise that of Iob,Iob. 19, 26. 
                  I shall see God in my flesh, &amp;c. Rabbi Simeon upon Gen. 10. gathereth therupon, that the Word of God, shall take flesh in a womans wombe. Another out of these words; Iehovah our God is one Iehovah, proveth the blessed Trinitie,Deut. 6, 4. saying, by the first Iehovah, is signified God the Father, by the next, which is Elohim, God the sonne, and by the other Iehova, God the Holy Ghost proceeding of them both: to all which is added the word one, to signifie, that these three are indivisible, but this secret (sayth he) shall not be reve

                  led untill the coming of the Messiah. These are the words of Rabbi Ibda, reported by Rabbi Simeon, in a Treatise called Zoar of great authoritie among the Iewes, where also the sayd Rabbi Simeon interpreteth those words of Isay, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hosts, in this maner. Esay by repeating three tymes Holy (sayth he) doth signifie as much as if he had sayd: Holy Father, holy Sonne, and holy Spirit: which three Holies doe make but one Lord God of Hosts, which mysterie of the blessed Trinitie, Rabbi Hacadosch gathereth out of the verie letters of IEHOVAH, upon those words of Ieremie before recited,Ier. 23, 6. the two natures of the Messiah both divine and humane, his two filiations, the one whereby he must be the sonne of God, the other whereby he must be the sonne of man: concluding thereupon, that in him there shall be two distinct natures, and yet shall they make but one Christ, which is the same that we Christians hold. Philo that learned Iewe shall ende this first consideration, touching the nature and person of the Messiah, as himself writeth in his Book De Exulibus, By tradition we haue it, sayth he, that we must expect the death of an high Priest, which Priest shall be the verie Word of God, voyde of all sinne, whose Father shall be God, and this Word shall be the Fath

               That the Messiah must change the Law of Moses.
               AS the Messiah must be both God and man, euen the naturall and onely begotten Sonne of God, and the verie Word of

God incarnate, voyde of all sinne, able to satisfie the wrath of his Father, and to fulfill the Law of Moses for us, which Moses himself could not doe, nor any other after him. It was a burdensome Lawe to the children of Israel, A yoake which neither they nor their forefathers were able to beare:
                  Act. 25.10▪
                   so having once in his owne person most exactly accomplished the same here on earth, together with all rites, ceremonies, prophecies, types, figures, and circumstances, of his comming, clearely fulfilled in him and by him. It was necessarie (I say) the substance being once come, those shadowes and ceremonies should cease and be abolished, I meane the ceremoniall Law totally, for as touching the morall Law, or the Commandements he sayth, I came not to destroy the Law or the Prophets, but to fulfill them, onely thus farre hath he abolished that too, he hath taken away the curse of it, hanging it on his crosse, euen the handwriting that was against us, together with himself crucified.
               This ceremoniall Law of Moses (I say) consisting of such a multitude of ceremonies, figures, types, sacrifices, &amp;c. all of them for the most part pointing at the Messiah to come; for by those outward signes and services appointed by God to his people, they were still put in mind of his covenant, and assured of his promise, that the Messiah should come. Moreover it being proper and peculier to one onely nation in all the world namely Iurie, the exercise thereof permitted, but in one onely place of that countrie, namely Ierusalem, whither everie man wa
                     •
                   bound to repaire three tymes everie yeere, to wit, at the Pasqua, Pentecost, and the feast of Tabernacles, there &amp; no where else to offer sacrifice. I say this Lawe of Moses, being altogether ceremoniall, and peculier to that nation, it was necessarie at the comming of the Messiah, the same should be abolished, and a more generall and perfect Law giuen and established, a Law that should be cōmon to all men, serue for all countries, tymes, places, and persons, otherwise how could the Gentiles be made pertakers of the covenant, aswell as the Iewes, how could all these nations, so farre distant from Ierusalem, repaire thrice everie yeere thither, how should everie woman dwelling in the East or West Indies repaire thither for her purification, after everie childbirth, as by the Law of Moses she was commanded Levit. 12. Therefore it is manifest, that this Law of Moses was giuen to continue but for a tyme, euen till the comming of the Messiah, and then another to come in place to continue, till

the worlds ende. This signifyed Moses to the people, after he had delivered the former Law to them,Deu. 18.15 saying, The Lord thy God will rayse up unto thee a Prophet like unto me, from among you, euen of thy brethren, unto him thou shalt hearken. As if he had sayd, yee shall heare me till he come, who must be a Lawgiver as my self, but of a farre more absolute and perfect Law, and therefore more to be reverenced and obeyed. And then he addeth in the person of God himself, this thundering sentence against all misbelievers: Whosoever will not hearken unto my Word, which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him. Which words cannot be verefied in any other Prophet, after Moses untill Christ, for that of those Prophets there arose none in Israel like unto Moses, Deut. 34.10. They had no authoritie to be Law givers, as Moses had, but were all bound to the observation of his Law, till Christ should come, whom Moses here calleth a Prophet like unto himself, that is, a Lawmaker, exhorting all men to heare and obey him. Hereunto the Prophets subscribe, none of them all presuming to take upon them that priviledge to be like unto him. A prophet like unto Moses, they must let that alone to the Messiah, whose office it is to change the Law of Moses, giuen upon mount Sinay, &amp; in stead thereof, to promulgate a new Law, to beginne at Sion, as sayth the Prophet Isay:Isai. 2.3. 
                  The Law shall goe forth of Sion, and the Word of the Lord from Ierusalem. Which cannot be understood of Moses Law, published eight hundreth yeeres before this prophecie, and that from Sinai, not from Sion, but of the preaching of the Gospel, which began at Ierusalem, and from thence was spread over all the world. Which the same Isay foresawe, when talking of the Messiah, he sayth, In that daie shall five cities in the Land of Egypt speak the language of Canaan, &amp;c. In that daie shall the alter of the Lord be in the middest of the Land of Egypt,
                  Esa. 29.18. 
                  and a piller by the border thereof, unto the Lord. And the Egyptians shall knowe the Lord in that daie, and doe sacrifice and oblation, and shall vow

                      vowes, &amp;c. which could not be verified of the Law of Moses, for by that Law, the Egyptians could haue nether alter nor sacrifice, but it was fulfilled upon the cōming of Christ, when the Egyptians were made Christians. Also in another place, and the yles shall waite for his Law. The same was likewise foretold by God in Malachie,Isai. 42.4. where he sayth to the Iewes, and of the Iewish sacrifices, I haue no pleasure in you, neyther will I receiue an offring at your hands, for from the rising of the sunne,

               The tyme of his manyfestation with all other circumstances.
               NOw for the tyme of his manyfestation, with all other circumstances, of his birth, lyfe, death, resurrection, ascension and those things also that fell out afterwards, if we shall consider how particulraly, &amp; precisely they were all foretold by the Prophets, and how long before (some hundreths some thousands of yeares) before they fell out; as also how exactly they were all fulfilled in the person of our blessed Saviour: all directed like so many lynes to one center: we shall (as it were in a mirrour) see and behold both the truth of Christian religion setled vpon a most firme &amp; unmovable center; as also the vanitie of all other religiōs whatsoever, especially this most vain expectatiō of the Iewes to this day, of their Messiah yet for to come, as vaine and fond altogither, as was that opinion of one of the Phylosophers which the word center hath put me in mynd of, that the earth forsooth did move and the heavens stand still: &amp; how far they are degenerate, not onely from all true light &amp; vnderstāding in heavenly matters, but also even from cōmon sense and reason it selfe in things of that nature tending therevnto.
               And first for the tyme. Daniell who lived in the first Monarchie foretold that there should be three monarchies more, the last the

greatest of all, to witt the Romane Empire, and then the eternall King or Messiah should come, his 
                     〈◊〉
                   are these. In the dayes of these Kings, shal the God of heaven set vp a kingdome which shall never be destroyed, Dan. 2.44. And just according to this tyme was the Messiah born, namely in the dayes of Augustus Caesar, Luk. 2. (as both we Christians account and the Iewes acknowledge) even in those halcyon dayes of peace when the temple gates of Ianus were commannded to be shut, and vpon that very day when Augustus commaunded that no man should call him Lord was this Prince of peace borne. Therefore to him agreeth this circumstance of tyme very fitly, most vainly therefore doe the Iewes after this tyme expect for another.

                  iah whom he there calleth Shilo should come at that tyme when the scepter or goverment regall was departed from the house of Iudah, which was in the dayes of Herod, and never till then, who first vsurped that government, his father in law King Hircanus with all his of

A new pedegrie for himselfe divised, In a word all authority regall whatsoever belonging to that tribe, at that tyme, quite extinguished. And just according to this tyme was our Saviour borne, namely in the dayes of Herod, Math. 2.1. Therefore, to him agreeth this circūstance of tyme very fitly: most vainely therefore doe the Iewes after this tyme expect any longer.
               Thirdly God himselfe saith by his Prophet Hagga
                     •
                  ; that the Messiah whome he there calleth the de

The words of the Lord by his Prophet Haggai are these.Hag. 2.

And I will move all nations, and the desire of all nations shal come, and I will fill this house with glory saith the Lord of hostes. The glory of

this last house shalbe greater their the first &amp;c. which must needs be vnderstood of the coming of the Messiah to wit his personall presence in this second temple, in whom is the fulnes of glory, &amp; therefore could he and none other, fill it with glory, being himselfe indeed the King of glory. Lifte vp your heads ô yee gates and be yee lift vp yee everlasting dores and the King of glory shall come in.
                  Psal. 24.
                        •
                     . So doth Mallachie prophesy in these words.Mal▪ 3.1. 
                  The Lord whom yee seeke shall speedily come to his temple, even the m
                        •
                     ssenger of the covenant whom yee desire, behold he shall come sayth the Lord of hosts &amp;c. And so indeed he did, for Christ Iesus came into the world during this second temple, and did himselfe likewise foretell the destruction thereof, which came to passe even in that age. Therefore to him agreeth, this circumstance of tyme very fitly, most vainly therefore doe the Iewes after this tyme, to wit the destruction of the second temple expect any further.
               Fourthly the Messiah by the true computation of Daniels prophesie, accounting his Hebdomades or weekes for so many yeeres to be multiplied by seauen: that is to say weekes of yeares, (as they must needs be understood) was to come just according to the tyme before mentioned, his words are these: Seventie weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thyne holy citie: knowe therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the Command
                        •
                     ment to bring againe the people, and to build Ierusalem unto Messiah the Prince, shall be seauen weeks, and threescore and two week
                        •
                     . And after threescore and two weeks shall the Messiah be slayne, and not for hims
                        •
                     lf. And the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the citie and sanctuarie, and he shall confirme the covenant with many for one week, &amp; in the middest of the weeke he shall c
                        •
                     use the sacrifice and oblation to cease. Which Hebdomades, or weeks of yeeres, whether we account from the first yeere of Cyrus who first determined the Iewes reduction, or from the second of Darius, who confirmed, and put the same in execution, or from the twentieth yere of Darius, for that he then made a new Edict in the favour of Nehemias, and sent him into Iury: everie way they will ende in the raigne of Herod and Augustus, under whom Christ was borne, or in the raigne of Tyberius, under whom he suffered. And by no interpretation can it be avoyded, but that this tyme is now out, aboue one thousand and fiue hundreth yeeres. Beside
                     •
                  , this being a cleare prophecie of the Messiah (howsoever somewhat more intricate and obscure, in respect of the yeeres, wherein the Prophet alludeth to the captivitie of Babylon, as some thinke)

must needs be interpreted according to the former prophecies also of the Messiah. And so doth the Prophet expound himself in the former words, namely that theMessiah should be slaine, before the destruction of the citie and Sanctuarie. Yet is there one weeke more to make up the number of seauentie, in the midst of which weeke the Messiah should be slayne, which came to passe accordingly, for in the middest of that weeke, that is about three yeeres and an half after his baptisme, Christ Iesus the true Messiah was slayne,Luk. 23.14.22. 
                  and not for himself, for Pilat could find no fault in him: I find no fault in the man, I finde no cause of death in him, I am innocent of the blood of this Iust man,
                  Mat. 27. 
                  look ye to it. Not for himself but for us was he wounded (as sayth the Prophet Isai) He was wounded for our transgressions.
                  Isai. 53.5. Therefore to him doth this circumstance of tyme beare witnes, and consequently the Iewes after these tymes by God himself appointed for the Messiah, expecting yet for an other beside
                     •
                   the vanitie of this their expectation, they make God himself a lyer, yea and all their Forefathers Abraham, Isaack and Iacob, &amp; all the holy Prophets (whose children they hold themselues to be) who all of them sawe these dayes, and prophecied of them, Abraham rejoyced to see my day (sayth our Saviour) and he sawe it,
                  Ioh. 8, 56. Act. 3, 21. Chap. 8, 44. 
                  and was glad.) All these make they Lyers with themselues, whereby they shewe themselues, rather to be the children of the Divil, who is the father of lyes, then of Abraham, who is the father of the faithfull onely. For so did that vile serpent at the first, euen dare to giue God himself the lye (as it is in Genesis) God

                  ye shall not dye as all. So doe these Imps of Sathan, generation of vipers, as Iohn the Baptist in his time called them,Mat. 3.7. euen just after the same maner. For sayth God by his prophets, at such a tyme will I sende the Messiah into the world, and by such and such markes, ye shall knowe him: no sayth this froward generation, it is not so, he hath not yet sent him, he is not yet come, we acknowledge no such marks, as that he shall be poor and of no reputation in this world, put to death. We look for a magnificent prince, we will none of such a base fellowe, as this Iesus to reigne over us, a false Prophet, a deceiver, and so forth, with whatsoever els their malicious harts can imagine, their blasphemous tongues, being set on fire of hel, are ready to utter to his disgrace. But let them looke into that parable of our Saviour

&amp; there they shall find him another maner of persō thē they imagine, I will repeat it unto them. Moreover those mine enemies who would not that I should raigne over them,
                  Luk. 19, 27. 
                  bring them hither and stay them before me. God of his mercie giue them repentance in tyme of their heynous and high blasphemies, that they may mourne for him whom they haue pierced, everie familie and tribe apart. Repent for the kingdome of heauen is at hand, And think not to say with your selues, we haue Abraham to our Father, for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones, to rayse up children unto Abraham. Now is the axe put to the roote of the tree. The last trumpet will blowe and then it wil be to late, when ye shall heare that shrill voyce ringing in your eares arise ye deade and come to judgment, that voyce will awake you out of all your dreames, and make you arise whether ye will or no, when ye shall see the sonne of man come in his glorie, euen your long looked for Messiah, like a magnificent prince indeed, but litle to the comfort of those that remayne obstinate. Awake therefore to your salvation that ye be not awakened hereafter to your condemnation: Awake thou that sleepest, stand up from the dead,
                  Eph. 5.14. 
                  and Christ shall giue thee light, shake of all your ydle dreames and foolish fantasies of your imaginarie Messiah, fitter for children then men of discretion, consider with your selues at length, how long ye haue overslept your selues, how manie ages are now past and gone, since both by computation of Scriptures (as aforesayd) as also by the observation of your owne Doctors, and Teachers, your Messiah was to come, and yet you see him not, no nor any likelyhood at all of his comming, more then at the first, yea rather all evidenc

                  s and probabilities to the contrarie that may be, looke into your Talmud, and there ye shall see plainly, if you be not blynd there also as you are in the Scriptures, the vanitie of vanities of this your expectation, for so it is indeede.
               It is often repeated in your Talmud that one Elias left this tradition, that the world should endure six thousand yeares, that is two thousand before the lawe, two thousand under the lawe, &amp; two thousand, after that vnder the Messiah. Which last two thousand yeares, by all computation could not begin much from the birth of Iesus.

so longe, deferreth the same much more then may ye marvel vpon whome the ends of the world are come.
               An other observation cabalisticall they have vpon those words of Isa. 9:7: The increase of his goverment and peace shall have no end, where the Hebrew word is lemarbeh signifying to increase or multiply ad multiplicandum: In which worde, because they finde mem to be shut which is not vsual in the middle of a word they gather many secrets, and amonge other, that seeing mem signifieth 600 yeares, so longe it should be from that time of Isai, vntil the time, of the Messiah, which accompt of theirs falleth out so just, that if you reckō the yeares frō Achas King of Iuda, in whose time Isay spake these words, vntil the time of Herod vnder whom Christ was born, ye shall find the nūber to fail in litle or nothing.
               A much like observation hath Rabby Moses ben Maimon in his Epistle to his countrymen the Iewes in Africa concerning the time of the Messiah, which he thinketh to be past according to the Scriptures above a thousand yeares, (he lived about the yeare of Christ one thousand, one hundreth &amp; forty) but that God deferreth his manifestation for theire sinnes, since which time, hath passed almost 500. yeares more, and yet yee heare nothing of his cōming. Consider this yee Iewes of Barbary for to you partly seemeth this Epistle to be written. Will you then stay still, and say stil after so many hundreth yeares past and gone, that for your sinnes God deferreth yet his cōminge, putting it of from one five hundreth yeares to another, &amp; so in infinitum? it is all one as if you say, that for your sinnes God hath broken his promise nowe, a thousande and six hundreth yeares, and consequently it may be for your sinnes the Messiah will never come, this must be your last refuge, you may aswell say the one as the other. But howsoever you make your selves sinfull, yea out of measure sinful, yet let God be iust and righteous in his promise (as it is written) make not him a lyer as you have done hitherto.Psal 51.4.

                     . 66.7. that is saith he, before the Synagogue was afflicted and made desolate, by the Romans she brought

forth the Messiah. But yet saith he this Messiah for our sinnes doth hide himself in the seas and other defarts, till we be worthy of his comming. Which is asmuch in effect as if he had said, (the one as probable as the other) that perhaps for our sinnes and vnworthines the Messiah may not come at all, but returne to heaven backe againe from whence he came. And why I pray you not have stayed aswell in heaven all this while rather then in the seas and desarts for so many yeres, to no purpose. I am parswaded if Balaams Asse were aliue againe, and did heare these, and such like your idle fantasies &amp; dreames touching your Messiah, the very asse woulde reprove you to your faces, and make you ashamed of them, wherof though I have read somewhat in divers authors yet coulde I hardly beleeve any such absurdities to be delivered, much lesse defended, by any reasonable creatures, till I had heard some thinge my self. I urged that place of Genesis, to one of them, to witte, that the Scepter should not depart from Iuda till Shilo came, that is the Messiah, which being so long since departed and gone, I asked what reason they had, as yet to expect for a Messiah, he answered, the Scepter was not departed, they had their sheckes, that is to say, chief men of their tribes, in all parts, where they inhabite. Moreover that some of the Moores forsooth had brought them word of a people or nation of the Iewes, inhabiting in a farre countrie, he could not tell me the place where, but first there is a river to be passed, two trees, growing on eyther side directly one against another, which two trees, everie saturday and no day els, doe of their owne accord bowe one towards another, making as it were a bridge for men to goe

                  and a litle childe to leade them, &amp;c. That these things should thus come to passe literally, according to the verie Hebrewe characters. This is

all the knowledge they haue in the Scriptures, the bare Hebrew letters, and no more. Yet can they not speake one word of the true spirituall language of Canaan, but in steede of Shiboleth (like those Ephraimites,Iudg. 12.6. they pronounce Siboleth, no interpretation spirituall of the celestial Canaan, the heauenly Ierusalem, of the spirituall temple, of the mysticall bodie of the Messiah, that is to say, his Church, no relish at all of the Spirit of God, or any spirituall worship amongst them. And yet forsooth they will be the people of God alone, and who but they, the children of Abraham, and of the promise, and none but they, yea they are so vaynly puft up with the foolish pride of this their high pedegree, that they thinke verely and will speake it confidently (I haue heard it from them, that none of them, unlesse for verie heynous offences as perjurie, or such like, shall be judged after this life, or be in daunger of hell fire, they onely to haue their punishment in this world, and not els. As though hell fire were onely prepared for us gentiles, and heauen onely for the Iewes, which unlesse they repent they shall find quite contrarie, if the words of our Saviour be found true, which hitherto they haue found but to true, to their woe, as I noted before. I say unto you that many shall come from the east and from the west,
                  Mat. 8.11. 
                  and shall sitte downe with Abraham, and Isaack, and Iaakob in the kingdome of heauen, and the children of the kingdome shall be cast out into utter darknes, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Where are now the Iewes with their loftie pedegree▪ Euen as Esau sould to Iaakob his birthrigh for a messe of pottage, so haue the Iewes to us Gentiles their birthright to the kingdome of heauen, for a messe of idle dreames add fantasies they imagine to themselues, towres &amp; castles in the aire, crownes &amp; kingdomes in expectance, euen in this world, another paradice here on earth. But in the end they shall find themselues to haue been all this while in a fooles paradice, and as it were in a dreame, which when one awaketh vanisheth, and so I leaue them to their dreames and profound sleep, till it shall please God of his mercie to awake them.
               Thus then it is manifest both by Scripture, tradition, and observation of the Iewes themselues, that about the tyme before mentioned, to witte in the dayes of Augustus Caesar, the newe Roman Emperor and of Herod the vsurper King of Iury, who was the first that tooke away the scepter from Iuda, euen in the tyme of the seconde Temple, the true Messiah was to be borne.

               His birth with the circumstances thereof.
               THirdly, the Messiah by the Scripture was to be borne of a virgin, so sayth Isay.Isai. 7.14. 
                  Behold a virgin shall conceiue and bring forth a sonne, the Hebrewe is He emphatioum the virgin. And Isai appointeth this to Achaz, for a wonderfull &amp; straunge signe from God, therefore, sayth he, the Lord himself will giue you a signe, behold, which he could not haue done in reason, if the Hebrewe word in that place had signified a young woman onely, as some later Rabbins will affirme, for that is no such signe nor straunge thing, but verie common and ordinarie for young women to conceiue and bring forth children, and so did the Elder Iewes understand it, as Rabbi Simeon noteth. And Rabbi Moses Haddersan upon those words, Truth shall bud forth of the earth, sayth thus. Here Rabbi Ioden noteth, that it is not sayd, truth shall be ingendred, but truth shall budde forth, to signifie, that the Messiah, who is meant by the word truth shall not be begotten as other men are, in carnall copulation. To the same effect, and after the same maner to be interpreted is that of Ieremie.Ier. 32.22. 
                  The Lord hath created a newe thing in the earth a woman shall compasse a man. And Rabbi Haccadosch proveth by cabal

Behould the Lord rideth vpon a light cloud (which is his flesh, or humanity) and shall come into Aegipt, and all the Idols of Aegipt shall tremble) at his presence, which later pointe Eusebius sheweth was fulfilled most evidently in the sight of all the world,Euseb. iib. 6. for that no nation came to christian religion with so great celerity and fervour as did the Aegyptians, who threwe downe theire Idols before any other nation. And as they had beene the first in Idolatrie to other countries, so were they, the first by Christ his cōming vnto them that afterwards gave exāple of true returne vnto their creator. It followeth in Isay, I will deliver the Egiptians into the hands of cruel Lords (these were the Roman Lords and Princes, Pompei, Caesar, Antonie &amp;c. &amp; a mightie King shall raigne over thē &amp;c. this must needs be Augustus the Emperor, who after the death of Cleopatra the last of the blood of the Ptolimies, tooke possession of all Egypt and subjected it as a province to the Romaine empire. But after these temporall afflictions threatned against Egypt, behold a most Euangelical promise of deliverance: In that day shall fiue cities of the land of Egypt speake the language of Canaan, &amp;c. In that day shall the altar of the Lord, be in the middest of the Land of Egypt &amp;c. They shall crye unto the Lord because of their oppressors, and he shall send them a Saviour, and a great man, and shall deliver them, &amp;c.

Iohn the Baptist, in the spirit and power of Eliah, as an angell from heauen expoundeth it, appearing to Zacharias his father in the temple, sent to foretell him both of his birth, as also by what name he should call him,Luk. 1.13. euen Iohn, saying, thou shalt call his name Iohn, he shalbe great in the sight of the Lord, &amp;c. he shall goe before him in the power and spirit of Eliah. And therefore our Saviour in plaine termes he calleth him Eliah, Mat. 11, 14. And if you wilt receiue it, this is that Eliah which was to come, he that hath ears to heare let him heare. And as our Sauiour gaue him his due, before a multitude

then assembled, calling him Eliah: So did this Eliah also giue our Saviour his due, in acknowledging him for the Messiah, not assuming unto himself that honour offered unto him by the Iewes, but refusing it absolutely, and laying it upon Iesus our Saviour the true owner. Then, this is the recorde of Iohn,

And truely no one thing in all this storie of Iesus life, doth more establish the certaintie of his being the true Messiah, then that Iohn the Baptist, whose wisedome, learning, vertue and rare sanctitie is confess

imbracing of Iesus doctrine, which is most evidently proved, that he did for that somany followers and Disciples as himselfe had, not one appeared ever after, that was not a Christian.
               These circūstances I say of the birth &amp; cōming of the Messiah into this world so lōg before foretold by the Prophets &amp; fulfilled so exactly in the person of our blessed Lord &amp; Saviour wel considered; I may at length conclude, Heaven and earth concurring, men and Angels with all other creatures applauding therevnto, yea &amp; God himselfe from heaven pronouncing it, this is my beloved sonne in whome I am well pleased. That therefore as sure as God is God and cannot lye nor give testimony to any vntruth, so sure is Iesus Christ the sonne of God, the true Messiah and Saviour of the worlde, no other to be expected.

               THus having evicted by the birth of our Lord and Saviour Iesus Christ together with the circumstances both before and after, that he was by birthright the onely legitimate (as I may say) and true borne Messiah, all others that were before him, or since have sprunge vp or shall doe hereafter to the worlds end, but bastards, and vsurpers, yea theeves, and robbers, and that in the highest degree of theeverie that may be, even robbing God of his honor, which he wil not impart to any other: it remaineth yet furthere to demonstrate the same by his life, death, resurrection, ascention, with all other accidents, and circumstances accordingly to be observed, which may make this mistery more &amp; more manifest, or rather palpable, as the Apostle witnesseth saying, that which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seene, with these our eies, which we have look

corruptions of flesh and blood, which procured him the more hatred (as in all the foure Euangelists, Mathewe, Marke, Luke, and Iohn, who recorded both his sayings and doings may appeare:) wholly tending to the sinceare service of God in spirit and truth, to the exaltation of Gods glorie, the beating downe of mans pride, by discovering his miserie, to the contempt of this wicked world and vaine pompe thereof, to the mortifiation of all sinnes in vs, patience, peace of conscience &amp;c. in a word all directed to the manifestation of his fathers will and amendment of mans life:Deut. 6.5.

The maner of his doctrine was simple plaine and easie, altogither according to the evidence of the spirit, not in the enticing words of mans wisdome like the heathen orators &amp; Philosophers, nor like the Scribes &amp; Pharisees, but with power and authoritie, without eyther feare or flatterie of any mans person, rebuking all mens sinnes even to their faces, which (I say) procured him such a generall hatred. It tooke away no one spirituall point of Moses law (but the ceremoniall onely and provinciall, which by the comming of the Messiah was to be taken away) yea rather revived, interpreted and made perfect the same, corrupted much by the Iewes false interpretations and glosses.

                  though two or three had been sufficient in lawe,Luk. 7.11. who afterwardes sealed the truth thereof euen with their dearest blood, as did infinite others after them. Neyther could the Iewes of those times, compassed about with such a clowd of witnesses ever deny the truth thereof: the parties themselves then living, and conversing amongst them, upon whom they were wrought. They had no other evasion but this, to say (and that most blasphemoussie, contrary to their owne knowledge and conscience: and therefore our Saviour layeth it to their charge as that fearefull sin against the holy Ghost not to be praied for) that he wrought these his miracles by the help of Beelzebub the Prince of Divils. Wheras it is most apparant, the Divill himselfe had never that power giuen him to rayse one from the dead: and though he had, yet would he sooner by his good will, take away both lyfe and breath from all men at once (if it were possible) wishing all men in the world had but one head or neck, like that cruell tyrant in Rome rather than give life to any one, for he is a murtherer frō the beginning. And yet the Iewes themselves in their Thalmud doe acknowledge that the Messiah at his coming, shalbe most wonderfull in working myracles. And in their publick commentary vpon ecclesiastes they haue these words: all the former miracles of the Prophets or Saincts, shall be nothing to the myracles of the Messiah when he cōmeth. But such were the myracles of our Saviour, the whole multitude applauding hereunto: Mat. 9.33▪
                  
                  the like was never seen in Israel, he hath done all things well; never man spake like this man. Seing also it is impossible, yea blasphemie to think that God should give testimonie, to any untruth, it must needs followe that all was true which Iesus affirmed, &amp; therfore seing he affirmed himself to be the sone of God, and the Messiah, it must needs followe (I say) by these his miracles, that he was so in deed, according to that speech of his to the Iewes:Ioh. 10.2

And yet with these cold offers presented to the world, first by himself to his Apostles and disciples wonne thereby to follow him, euen upon the first call, they left all and followed him, and by them to all others afterwards: Isay, by this doctrine so crosse and opposite to mans nature, inclination, and sensuall appetite, he gayned moe harts unto him, within the space of fortie yeeres, then ever did monarch in the world possesse loving subjects, by whatsoever temporall alurements, they did or might propose: which argueth the omnipotent, puisance of him, that contrarie to mans reason in so shorte a tyme could bringe to passe so miraculous a conquest, were there no other argument in the world, of the truth of Christian Religion, this were sufficient.
            
            
               His death and passion.
               FOr his death and passion, with all the disgrace dispite and indignities were done unto him by the Iewes, it was also foretold by the Prophets, and so expounded by their owne Rabbins, as also by our Sauiour himself:Luk. 18, 31. behold we goe up to Ierusalem, and all things shall be fulfilled to the Sonne of man, that are written by the Prophets,Mat.

All which narration Rabbi Ionathan,Isay. 53, the author of the Chaldie Paraphrase applyeth to the murther of the Messiah by the Iewes, whereunto agree Rabbi Simeon, Rabbi Hadersan, and others: proving further out of Dan. 9. ver. 27. That after the Messiah shall haue proached half seauen yeeres, he shall be slayne: which disagreeth litle or nothing frō the account of us Christians. Also in their Talmud it is set

                  awe, and so oxpounded and acknowledged by the Iewes themselues (the auncient Rabbins before mentioned) and finally, so exactly fulfilled in our Lord and Saviour (as by the quotations in the margent may appeare) together with the milde maner of his death, praying for his enemies,Mat. 27.

And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their brests and returned. So may I conclude, Truly this was the sonne of God, truly this is the Messiah, and let all the people of the Iewes come together againe to this sight and behold him, whom they haue pierced,Act. 1.37. and smite their brests, prick

               His Resurrection.
               FOr his Resurrection it was also foretold by the prophets, and prefigured in Ionas. David sayth in the person of the Messiah of whom he prophecied in divers places, and was a type, I haue set the Lord alwaies before me,

                  till the third day, least his disciples steale him away by night, &amp; say unto the people, he is risen from the dead, &amp; so the last error be worse then the first. All which was done, according to their desire, a strong watch appointed, the Sepulchre sealed up, all things made so sure by the Iewes as might be: for they had gotten from Pilate a speciall commission for that purpose, to whom he was as forward to grant it, as they to aske it, and that in as large and ample maner as themselues knewe or could devise. All which, notwithstanding after a most miraculous maner, The angel of the Lord discending from heauen,
                  Mat. 28, 2. 
                  with an earthquake, and rolling back the stone from the doore of the sepulchre, the keepers astonied and become as dead men: Iesus our Saviour according to the former prophecies is risen againe, and hath appeared to his Apostles and disciples his faithfull witnesses, a number of them, at divers severall times, to whom he presented himself aliue (as S. Luke writeth) by manie infallible tokens,
                  Act. 1, 3. 
                  being seene of them by the space of fortie dayes, and speaking of those things, which apperteyne to the kingdome of God: how soever the Iewes suborned the soldiours, giving them largely to say, his disciples came by night and stole him away, while they slept, which saying is noysed among the Iewes to this day. How probably (the former circumstances considered) let the world judge. Therefore I will conclude this point also, with that of Paul, touching the Resurrection of our Lord and Saviour,Rom. 1, 4 
                  He hath declared himself mightily

to be the sonne of God, by the Resurrection from the dead, and consequently,Rom. 1, 2. that Messiah promised before by the Prophets in the holy Scriptures, as the same Apostle urgeth.
            
            
               His Ascention.
               FOr his Ascention, it was also foretold by the Prophets, and necessarily followeth upon his Resurrection to be believed: to wit, that having finished the worke of our Redemption here on earth, he ascended up into heauen, and there sitteth at the right hand of God. David sayth, Thou art gone up on high thou hast ledde captivitie captiue,
                  Psal. 68, 18 
                  and received gifts for men, &amp;c. And in another place,Psa. 110, 1. 
                  The Lord said to my Lord, sitte thou at my right hand, &amp;c. which is the place alledged by our Saviour, wherewith he put the Iewes to silence, both as touching the Dietie and the humanitie of the Messiah, for sayth he, if David call him Lord, how is he then his sonne, where we may see David acknowledgeth him his Lord, and consequently his God, euen the sonne of God, sitting at the right hand of God (for the present, as touching his divinitie) afterwards to be accomplished also in his humanitie, which David believed as verely should come to passe, and forsawe by the eye of fayth, as did Thomas, when it was come to passe, putting his hand into his side and crying, My Lord &amp; my God: so sayth David here, my Lord: The Lord sayd unto my Lord, &amp;c. I say, this article of our fayth as touching his Ascention, it followeth necessarily to be concluded upon his Resurrection, it needeth no other proof. For that whosoever seeth and acknowledgeth, that Iesus being dead could raise himself to life againe, will easily belieue also, that he was able to ascend up to heauen at his pleasure. And hereof we haue also all his Apostles and Disciples for witnesses, eye-witnesses, in whose presence and sight he ascended, as it is in that place, they looked stedfastly towards heauen as he went.
                  Act. 1, 10. And in witnesse thereof gaue up their liues, and sealed the same with their blood.
               Therefore I conclude vpon all these premises so necessarily following and depending one apon an other: to witt his birth, life, doctrin, actions, death, resurrection, and ascention: seing nothing hath happened in the same which was not foretold by the Prophets of God, nor any thing foretold by the same Prophets concerning the Messiah, which was not fulfilled most exactly in the person of our Saviour: We may most certainly assure our selves

that as God is truth, and therefore can neither foretell an vntruth, nor yeeld testimonie to the same: so it can not be but that these things which have beene shewed to be so manifestly foreprophecied, and so evidently accomplished in the person of this our blessed Lord and Saviour: must needs (I say) assure vs Christians that he was indeed the true Messiah: &amp; quite confound the Iewes in theire vaine imagination, and expectation of another.
            
            
               The sending of the Holy Ghost: with the first plantation &amp; wonderfull increase of the Church.
               NOw for those things that followed after his ascention as argumēts &amp; effects of his divine power: they were also foretold by the Prophets, to wit, the sending of the Holy Ghost that comforter from on high with the sodayne, strange and myraculous increase of his Church, throughout the world even against all worldly power and policie, by the onely power and ministerie of his worde confirmed with signes and wonders that followed, wrought by his Apostles, Disciples, and other his faithfull servants, and witnesses in the primitive Church: then the which there can be no greater argument in the world of the truth of Christian Religion, if we consider how all other religions in the world have growne and been maynteined by force of armes, fyre and sword, this onely by the preaching of Christ crucified, in all na

                  all with one accord in one place sodenly there came a sound from heaven as of a mighty wind and filled all the house where they sate. And there

appeared unto them cloven tongues like fyre, and it sate upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues as there is mentioned. And with these fiery cloven tongues these 12. silly soules without any other meanes, men, money or munitiō in a very short time conquered a great part of the world. In so much that at one sermon of S. Peter at the same time there were added to the Church three thowsand soules. And so multiplied successively from time to time, and from place to place, spreading it selfe from one country to another, and from one nation to an other and so at length into all nations; there is neyther speach nor language where their voice is not heard, their line is gone forth through all the earth and their words into the ends of the world, as we see it is come to passe this day. Of which cōming of the Holy Ghost in the time of the Messiah Ioel prophesied saying.Ioel. 2.28. 
                  And it shalbe in the last dayes that I wil power out my spirit vpon all flesh &amp;c. and on my servants and on my, handmaids. I will powre out my spirit &amp;c. It filled all the howse where they sate, &amp; it sate upon each of them and they were all filled with the holy Ghost. Here is a deluge of Gods grace powred upon the world immediately upon the ascension of our Lord and Saviour. First vpon his Apostles and disciples of those times in greater measure as the first fruites of his spirit by the which they wrought miracles, spake all manner of languages, healed all maner of diseases, cast out Divils, raysed the dead, and lastly sealed the same with their blood. Poore fishermen and such like, of no reputation in the world, without learning, without credite, without meanes (as before) yet by this meanes conquered the world to the subjection of their maister Christ;Pal. 118.22. Act. 4.11. that stone cast aside of the builders but now become the heade stone of the corner: this is the Lordes doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes.
               
            
            
               The sinceritie of the Evangelistes.
               NOw for the Evangelists, or writers of the Gospell, that is to say the registers of his birth, life, doctrine, and death: it is to be noted, that our Saviour being God, tooke a different way from the custome of man, in delivering vnto us his lawes, &amp; precepts. For that men who have been lawmakers vnto the world, knew no surer way of publishing their lawes, and procuring authoritie to the same, than to write them with their owns handes, and in their life time to establish their promulgation. So Lycurgus, Solon, and others among the Grecians, Numa to the Romans,

Mahomet to the Sarasins. But Iesus, to shew this divine power in directing the pen, and stile of his Evangelists; would not leave any thing written by himselfe, but passed from this world in simplicity and silence: without any further shewe, or ostentation of his owne doings. Meaning notwithstanding afterwards, to his glorie, and the aedification of his Church here on earth, by foure irrefragable witnesses or remembrancers, (the four Evāgelists) every word should be established &amp; recorded. As may appear by that place where he saith:Ioh. 14.25. 
                  These things have I spoken vnto you being present with you, but the Comforter which is the holy Ghost▪ whom the Father wil send in my name he shal bring all things to your remembrance which I haue told you. Wherevpon I inferre, that the Evangelists, and Apostolicall writers, were all of them guided and directed, by one and the same spirit, even the spirite of God for the registring of all things eyther sayd or donne by our Saviour: so farre forth as seemed best to his divine will and pleasure▪ to be registred, and recorded, for the benefite and edification of his Church. Ioh. 20.30.21.25. 
                  For there were many other things which Iesus did (as Io. the Evāgelist testifieth) which are not written: that is to say, which the holy spirit of God thought needlesse to faith and salvation, but (saith he) these things are written that ye might beleeve,
                  
                     
                        〈…〉
                     
                   
                  that Iesus is the Christ the sonne of God and that in beleeving ye might have life through his name. Now for these Evāgelists,Ezek. 1. foure in nomber (which some have resēbled to the foure beasts in Ezek:) the first &amp; last are Apostles, that wrote as they had seen, the two middle at disciples who registred things as they had ūderstood by cōferēce with the Apostles.Luk. 1.2. The first gospel was written by an Apostle to give light, to the rest: and the last also by an Apostle, to give authoritie and confirmation to the former. The first was written in the Hebrew tongue: for that all those myracles which Iesus wrought were doone in that countrie (he was not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel) to the end that eyther the whole nation might beleeve them or the obstinate impugne them:Mat. 15, 24. which yet never any of theire Rabbines tooke in hand to doe. The other three were written in the most famous and popular language of all nations at that time, to wit, the Greek tōgue. They wrote their stories in divers countries, farre distant one from another, and yet agreed they all most exactly in one and the same narration (as is to be seene) though diversly related, yet in truth and substance all one: one sometymes supplying vvhat another

hath not, according to the discretion of one and the same spirit, vvherevvith they vvere all guyded and directed, like those four beasts in Ezech. 1.12: Everie one went streight forward▪ whither their spirit ledde them, they returned not. They vvrote in divers times, one after another: and yet the later did neyther correct nor reprehend any thing in the former, as heathen vvriters use to doe. They published their vvritings vvhen infinite vvere aliue that knevve the facts, and of them no small number, vvho desired by all meanes to impugne them. They set dovvne in most of their narrations, the tyme, the daye, the hour, the place, the village, the house, the persons vvith all other circumstances, vvhich the moe they are in number, the more easie to be refuted, if they were not true. Neyther did they write of things donne in farre Countries or places remote, but in the same Countrie where they were borne, in townes and cities that were publiquely knowne, in Ierusalem it self, in Bethania, and Bethsaida, villages hard by Ierusalem, in the Suburbs and hills about the citie, in such a street, at such a gate, in such a porch of the temple, at such a fishpoole, publique places, familiarly knowne to everie one, for these things were not done in a corner (as sayth the Apostle.) All which circumstances duly considered,Act. 26, 26. (never yet impugned) me thinks should perswade any man of reason, to become a Christian: as Agrippa in that verie place acknowledgeth to Paul, saying, almost thou perswadest me to become a Christian. They published their writings in their life time. They altered not their writings af
                     •
                  erwards as other Authors are wont in their latter Editions, nor ever corrected they one jote of that which they had first s
                     •
                  t downe. And (that which never happened in any other writings in the world besides, nor ever monarch was able to bring to passe for credite of his Edicts) they gaue their liues for defence and justifying of that which they had written. Their maner of writing is sincere &amp; simple, as becommeth so divine a Historie: without all art or Rhethoricall amplifications, as Historians use. They flatter none, no not Iesus himself,Mat. 21, 18. Luk. 19, 41. Mar. 14.33. whom they most adore, nor in confessing him to be their God, doe they conceale his infirmities of flesh, in that he was man: as his hunger and thirst, his being werie, how he wept, his passions of feare, and the like. Nay, these Evangelists were so sincere and religious in their narrations, as they noted especially the imperfections of themselues, and of such others, as

they principally respected. Mathew nameth himself, Mathew the Publican. Mark,Mat. 10, 3. Mar. 14, 67. Peters Disciple, recordeth how S. Peter thrise denyed his Lord and Master, and so of the rest. These mens writings were published for canonicall, and received for undoubted truth by all that lived in the verie same age, and were privie to everie particular circumstance therein conteyned. They were copied abroad into infinite mens hands, and so conserved with all care and reverence, as holy and divine Scripture. They were read in Churches throughout all Countries and nations, expounded preached and taught by all Pastors, and Commentaries made upon them by holy Fathers from tyme to tyme. So that no doubt can be made at all, eyther of the Authoritie of them, as originally and immediately proceeding from the Holy Ghost, or of the certaintie: but that we haue the verie same incorrupt, as the Authors left them, for that it was impossible for any enemie to corrupt so manie copies over the world, without discoverie and resistance. And thus much for the credite and authoritie of our Evangelists.
            
            
               The confession of Martyrs.
               NOw for the Martyrs (or witnesses) appoynted by God, for the sealing &amp; deliverie of this doctrine of the Gospel of our Lord and Saviour Iesus Christ to all the world, they were first and principally his owne Apostes and Disciples, Now ye are witnesses of these things: Who both heard his doctrine, and sawe his myracles:Luk, 24, 4
                        •
                     . as S. Iohn testifieth:1 Ioh. 1.1. 
                  that which wee haue heard, which we haue seene with our eyes &amp;c. That I say, which we haue seene and heard declare we unto you. And S. Peter,2 Pet. 1, 16. 
                  For we followed no deceiueable fables when we opened unto you the power and comming of our Lord Iesus Christ, but with our eyes we sawe his majestie. This doctrine (I say) of the glorious Gospel of our Lord and Saviour, whereof they were so fully perswaded,
                  Luk. 1.1. they did not onely professe it with their mouthes, yea euen before Kings, and were not ashamed, as God sayth to Paul,Act. 23, 11. cha. 27, 24. 
                  as thou hast testified of me in Ierusalem, so must thou beare witnes also at Rome: thou must be brought before Caesar: but in witnes thereof they gaue up their liues, and by their deaths sealed and delivered to the world the truth of that which in their liues they professed, they haue sealed that God is true: These are witnesses worthy to be beleeved, these are Martyres. Next to these are all those holy Disciples of theirs, all those holy confessors of the Primitiue Church put to death with

most exquisite torments, under those cruell Roman tyrants, during those tenne famous persecutions upon record, called the ten persecutions, Catexochen, in respect of the rage, furie and crueltie thereof: and all against poore, harmeles, and innocent Christians, dayly to

                     inteined. In vvhich extreame &amp; most incredible sufferings of Christians three points are vvorthie of great consideration. The first, vvhat infinite multitudes of all estates, conditions, sexes, qualities and age did suffer dayly for testimonie of this truth. The second, what intollerable and unaccustumed torments, not heard of in the world before, were devised by tyrants for afflicting this kind of people. Thirdly, and lastly, what invincible courage and unspeakable alacritie these Christians shewed in bearing out these afflictions and torments, which the enemies themselues could not attribute, but to some divine powre and supernaturall assistance.
            
            
               The subjection of Spirits.
               ANother consideration followeth of his divine powre &amp; omnipotencie, declared and exercised upon the spirits infernall, which in those dayes spake in the oracles, and till that time had possessed and deluded all nations. Heare the complaint of one of them: Hei mihi, congemiscite, hei mihi, hei mihi, oraculorum defecit me claritas. Woe unto me, lament ye with me, woe, woe to me, for that the honour of oracles hath now forsaken me. Which woefull complaint is nothing els but a plaine confession, that Iesus was he of whom a prophet sayd divers ages before,Zeph. 2, 11. 
                  He shall consume all the Gods of the earth, and everie man shall worship him from his place, euen all the yles of the Heathen. This confessed also the wicked spirits themselues, when at Christs appearing in Iewrie they came and did their homage to him, and besought him not to afflict or torment them before the time, nor command them presently to returne to hell: but rather to permit them some litle time of entertainement in the sea, or mountaines, or among heards of swine, or the like, which conf
                     •
                  ssion they made openly before all men, and declared the same afterwards by their deeds. For presently upon Christ

his death, &amp; upon the preaching of his name &amp; Gospel throughout the world, the oracle in all places ceased, whereof the Poets themselues beare witnes: Cessant Oracula Delphis.
                  Iuven. Saty 6. Whereupon Plutarch, that lived within one hundreth yeeres after Christ made a speciall Treatise to sifte out the causes, why the oracles of the Gods (as they deemed them) were ceased in his time.Plutar, de defectu oraculor. And after much turning and winding manie waies, at length resolved upon two principall points, or causes thereof. The first, for that in his tyme there was more store of wisemen then before, whose answers might stand in steede of Oracles: and the other, for that perhaps the Spirits accustumed to yeelde Oracles, were by length of tyme growen old and dead. Both which reasons, in the commonsence of all men must needs be false: &amp; by Plutarch himself cannot stand with probabilitie. For first in his books, which he wrote of the liues of auncient famous men, he confesseth, that in such kind of wisdome as he most esteemed, they had not their equals among their posteritie. Secondly, in his Treatise of Phylosophie he passeth it for a ground, that Spirits can not dye or waxe old. And therefore of necessitie there must be some other cause yeelded of the ceasing of these Oracles: which can not be but the presence, and commandement of some higher power: according to that saying of S. Iohn:1 Ioh. 3, 
                        ••
                     
                   for to this end and purpose appeared the sonne of God, to wit, that he might destroy the works of the divel. Neyther did Iesus this alone in his owne person, but gaue also powre and authoritie to his disciples, and followers, to doe the like: according to that their commission in the Gospel: Then called he the twelue Disciples together, and gaue them powre and authoritie over all divils, &amp;c.
                  Luk. 9, 7. And not only to these twelue did he giue this absolute powre and authoritie over uncleane Spirits, but to the rest likewise: as may appeare in the next chapter following, upon the returne of their commission: And the seauentie returned with joy saying:
                  cha. 10, 17. 
                  Lord euen the Divils are subdued to us through thy name. And he sayd unto them, I sawe Sathan like lightning fall downe from heaven: and so renueth their commission, saying Behold I giue unto you powre to tread on Serpents &amp; scorpions, and over all the power of the enemie: (that is to say, the Divil) neverthelesse (sayth he) in this rejoyce not, that the spirits are subdued unto you, but rather rejoyce because your names are are written in heauen. And this authoritie over the spirits infernall given by Iesus to his Disciples in the primitive Church, extended it selfe so far, that not

It is no merveile (saith he) if this citie so many yeares be vexed with the plague, seeing that both Aesculapius, and all other Gods, be now departed from it, by the comming of Christians: for since that men have begun to worship this Iesus, we could never obtaine any prophet by our Gods. Thus much cōfessed this patrone of paganisme, concerning the mayme that his Gods had received, by the power and comming of our Lord Iesus Christ, which albeit he spake with a malicious minde to bring Christians in hatred, yet is the confession notable, &amp; confirmeth that storie, which Plutarch in his forenamed book doth report: that in the latter yeares of the reigne of the Emperour Tiberius, a strange voice, and exceeding horrible clamor, with hideous, cries, skryches, and howlings, were heard by many, in the Graecian sea: complayning; that the great God Pan was now departed. And this af

                  irmeth Plutarch (that was a gentile) to have been alleadged and approved, before the Emperour Tyberius, who merveyled greatly thereat, and could not by all his diviners, and southsayers, whom he called to that consultation, gather out any reasonable meaning of this wōderfull accident. But we Christians, comparing the time wherein it happened, vnto the time of Christ his death and passion, and finding the same fully to agree: we may more then pabablie perswade our selves, that by the death of their great God Pan (which signifieth all, was imported, the vtter overthrow of all wicked spirits,Iohn.

This dreadfull and unspeakeable miserie, fell upon the Iewes, about 40. yeares after Christs assention, when they had shewed themselves most obstinate, and obdurate, against his doctrine delivered unto them, not onely by himself, but also by his disciples: of which they had now slaine S. Steven, and S. Iames: and driven into baniment both Peter, and Paul, and others that had preached unto thē. This thē was the providence of God, for the punishmēt of the Iews at that time.

Others condemned to dig, and hew stones for ever. And this was the end of that warr, and desolation.

And in the eighteenth yeare of Adrian the Emperour, one Iulius Severus being sent to extinguish all the remnant of the Ievvish generation, destroyed in a very short time ninetie &amp; eight townes and villages within that countrie, and slue five hundred &amp; fourescore thousand of them in one day. At which time also he beat downe the citie of Ierusalem, in such sort, as he left not one stone standing upō another of their ancient buildings: but caused some part thereof to be re

He changed the name of the citie &amp; called it Aelia,Aelius Adrianus. after the Emperors name. He droue out all the progenie and ofspring of the Iewes forth of all those countries, with a perpetuall law confirmed by the Emperor, that they should never returne, no nor so much as looke back from any high or eminent place, to that countrie againe. And this was donne to the Iewish Nation, by the Roman Emperors, for accomplishing that demand, which their principall Elders had made not long before to Pilate the Roman Magistrate, (after he had washed his hands, before the multitude to cleare himself, at leastwise in outward shewe, from the blood of Iesus, saying: I am innocent of the blood of this just man, looke you to it:) Then answered all the people, and sayd,

As namely at one tyme, after a long and vehement commination made, to the Scribes and Pharisees (in which he repeateth eight severall times that dreadfull threat, woe) he concludeth that all the righteous blood injuriously shedde from the first martyr Abel, and so successiuely should be revenged verie shortly upon that generation:Mat. 23.3

                  Luk. 19.41. 
                  saying: O if thou haddest euen knowne, at the least in this thy day those things which belong unto thy peace, but now are they hidde from thyne eyes. then denounceth that fearfull desolation following: that not one stone should be left upon another, but all throwne downe euen to the ground. Executed upon them &amp; made good by Tytus the sonne of Vespatian, and finally, accomplished by Iulius Severus, who in the daies of Adrian (as before is rehearsed) utterly defaced the verie ruines of that citie, in such sort, as he left not one stone standing upon another, of all their auncient buildings, but laid them euen with the ground. Againe, at another time,Luk. 21, 5. as some spake of the tēple how it was garnished with goodly stones, and consecrate things, he sayd: are these the things you looke upon? the dayes will come wherein a stone shall not be left up

And yet how certaine and assured foreknowledge, and as it were most sensible feeling, Iesus had of these miseries, he declared by those pitifull teares he shedde upon sight and consideration of Ierusalem (as before is mentioned) when he wept over it: as also by that tender speech he used to the women of that citie, who wept for him as he was ledde to be crucified,Luk. 23, 28. perswading them to weepe rather for themselues and for their children, (in respect of the miseries to followe) then for him. All which prophecies, and predictions of Iesus, with sundrie other his speeches, foreshewing so particularly the imminent calamities of that Nation, and that at such tyme, when in humane reason there could be no probabilitie thereof, when a certaine Heathen Chronicler, named

Phlegon, (about a hundreth yeeres after Christs departure) had diligently considered, having seene the same also in his dayes most exactly fulfilled (for he was servant to Adrian the Emperor, by whose command the finall subversion of that Iewish nation was brought to passe) this Phlegon (I say) though a Pagan, yet upon consideration of these events, and others that he sawe (as the extreame persecution of Christians foretold by Christ, and the like, he pronounced, that never any man foretold things so certainly to come, or that so precisely were accomplished, as were the predictions and prophecies of Iesus.

Finally, the preaching of the Gospel to all nations, Mat. 24, 14. and the uniting, and gathering together both of Iew and Gentile into one fold, under one shepheard (euen that great shepheard of our soules) that there may be one sheepfold, and one shepheard, Ioh. 10, 16.

Seeing also in the meane time (which I could not choose but see, with much pity, and compassion) the great, and grievous oppression, vnder which you grone: taxations, vexations, exactions; grammings (as you call them) even with torments rather than fayle; drubbings (so many hundreth blowes at once, as my selfe have both seen and heard:) with that base servile and most contemptible state, and condition otherwise, (above any other natiō, or people) under which you live: not onely in Barbary, but in al other parts of the world besides: as a fatal effect, of that heavie curse laid on you by your own forefathers long agoe, vpon the death of Christ; (when Pilate the judge washed his hands, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this iust man, looke yee to it:) they cried with one consent his blood be vpon vs &amp; on our children. As also of that prophesie of our Saviour in his life time, when he wept over Ierusalem saying ô if thou haddest even knowne, at the least in this thy day, those things which belong to thy peace, but now are they hid frō thine eyes &amp;c.

Which heavie curse of your owne forefathers, and prophisie of his, how truely they have been fulfilled both the one &amp; the other, all the world seeth, and yee your selves feele the effect: as before. The Lord in mercie, take away the vayle from your hearts, that at length ye may know those things which belōg to your peace which now are hid frō your

eyes: for why will ye dye ô ye house of Israel? These considerations (I say) and reasons, with some others, have moved me; and partly in recompence of those your definaes, and dainties, wherof I tasted so often while I was amongst you) to send you here a smal banket, of such dainties as Christendome can afford: wishing you would but tast some part of mine (as I did of yours) being indeed Sabbath dayes dainties: tast (I say) and see how sweet the Lord is. And the rather doe I invite you to this banket,Psal 34.1. yea rather provoke you therevnto (even to your owne salvation, which through your fall is come to us Gentiles to provoke you (as it is that place) for that now the time of your redemtion draweth neare (with ours:Rom. 11.11. 
               much nearer now thē whē we beleeved) foretold also, both by Christ, and his Apostles, as was your desolation: and shall one day, as surely and certainely come to passe, the one as the other. For God that hath promised is of power to performe it; he will doe it; he is able to graffe you in againe, into your owne olive tree.

               and Ierusalem shall be troden vnder foote of the Gentiles, vntill the time of the Gentiles be fulfilled: So long and no longer: there is the period.Luk. 21.24. And Paul the Apostle in a most fervent manner, both prayeth and prophesieth to this effect: brethren my hearts desire, and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved.

Then prophecieth at large in the chapter following, and that most divinely, as of their fall so of their generall call in due time: with many arguments, and reasons to that purpose. Which praier, and prophesie of his, proceeding from a divine instinct, and revelation; no doubt shall one day take effect. For it can not be, but that the word of God should take effect.

this: when they sinned against the Lord, he delivered them into the hands of their enemies: but when they cryed to the Lord in their trouble (that is to say repented) he straight-way delivered them out of their distresse, raysing up from time to time, one Saviour or deliverer after another, &amp; so immediatly governing them by Iudges till the daies of Samuel. When this people still growing worse and worse, and not contented with this sacred kind of government, immediately from God himselfe, but desiring a King like all other Nations: Make us now a King to judge us like all other Nations: he gave them a King in his anger, saying to Samuel:S

               heare the voyce of the people in all that they shall say unto thee, for they have not cast thee away, but they haue cast me away, that I should not raigne over thē, &amp;c. And as before under the Iudges, so now under the Kings still as they sinned, and multiplied their transgressions, so did the Lord inflict and multiply upon them his judgements, one plague after another: till at length they were caried captiues into Babylon. After which long captivitie, yet restored againe upon their repentance, the time was not long, but they fell againe to their old byas, and forgate the Lord their God, which had done so great things for them: yea, rather now worse then ever, persecuting the Prophets from time to time, whom God raysed up amongst them, and killing them one after another: even till the comming of the Messiah, and him likewise they crucified. Whereupon ensued this last and finall desolation, as the full measure of their sinnes deserved, and as themselves desired, saying: his blood be upon us and upon our children: which hath continued now almost this 1600 yeares: the longest captivitie and greatest miserie that ever happened to any people, and so shall continve, till they (as did their forefathers) turne to the Lord by trve and hearty repentance, and cry unto the Lord in their trouble, and then will the Lord deliver them out of their distresse, according to the former examples▪ and not before. And this is the state and condition of the Iewes at this day: the miserable state (I say) with the cause▪ and the remedie, which God graunt they may make use of.
