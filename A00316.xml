            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               FOrasmucheas the autour self in his preface here ensuyng dooeth at large declare the nature, the purpose, and the vse of Apophthegmes, to make of thesame matier double inculcacion should bee (as me semeth) bothe on my parte and behalf a thing superfluous, and also a tedious dullyng to the reader. It shall therefore at this presēte tyme be sufficiēte to admonyshe you gentle readers, that of the whole werke of Apophthegmes by the right excellente clerke Erasmus: for the moste plesaunte and the same moste honeste, profitable, &amp; holsome readnyg of allmaner persones, &amp; in especiall of noble menne collected and digested into eight volumes, I haue thought better with twoo of the eight to ministre vnto you a taste of this bothe delectable and fruiteful recreacion, then by suppressyng it vntil y• whole werke might bee perfectely absolued and finysshed, to defraude you of so many goodly histories, so many high poinctes of counsaill, so many notable preceptes of wysedome, so greate a noumbre of philosophicall lessōs, suche vnestymable treasure of morall doctrine, as may of this litle porcion in ye meane tyme with small labour &amp; incomparable delite, coūforte and solace of mynd, bee perceiued, gathered, and acquired. And although vpon consideracions, (at a more propice tyme herafter by goddes grace to bee declared) I haue beē so bolde with myne autour, as to make the firste booke &amp;

For as y• one parte maie thynke it muche superfluous to fynd Latine and Greke in an Englyshe booke, so the learned haue no nede of certain annotacions (whiche I haue in places not a fewe entremyngleed, partely to supplye &amp; redubbe that wanteth of the whole werke, and partely to geue necessarie light to ye Greke and Romaine histories) of whiche annotacions euē he peraduēture shall fynd ease, whiche wil fynd faulte with the admixtion of Greke and Latine &amp; will auouche thesame confused medleyng of soundrie tounges rather to contein some spiece of ostentacion &amp; braggue of the p

To all whom would Christe I could perswade (as trueth it is) that I seke nothyng lesse then suche shadoe of vnstable glorie, &amp; that my onely wille and desire is to further honeste knowelage, and to call (awaye the studious youth in especiall) from hauyng delite in readyng phantasticall trifles, (whiche contein in manier nothyng but the seninarie of pernicious sectes and sedicious doctrine, vnto a more fruitefull sorte of spēdyng good houres, &amp; by inuityng thesame youth vnto the imitacion of honeste exercises, to dooe good if I maye. But to procede in that I was now about to saie, truly for the Englysheman to bee offended with the admixtion of Latine, or the Latine manne to myslyke the pouthreyng of Greke, appereth vnto me a muche like thyng, as if at a feaste with varietee of good meates &amp; drynkes furnyshed, one that loueth to feede of a Capon, should take displeasure that an other

manne hath appetite to a Coney, or one y• serueth his stomake with a Pertrige, should bee angrye with an other that hath a mynde to a Quaylle, or one y• drynketh single beere should bee greued with his nexte feloe for drynkyng ale or wyne. Now for the better vnderstandyng of the cōceipte, trade and conueighaunce of this booke, I haue thought requisite to admonyshe you, that in eche mānes Apophthegmes the saiyng self is sette out in a greate texte lettre: after whiche ymmediately foloweth in a middle lettre (with this marke) the moralizacion of Erasmus, wheresoeuer to thesame it semed expediente any suche morall sense to gather of the Apophthegme for edifiyng of the reader in vertue or ciuile honestee.

And to the entente that nothyng should lacke whiche to the ease and commoditee of the vnlearned reader might seme necessarie, there is added also a large &amp; plain table in ordre of ye A.B.C. whereby to the name of any persone, or to any good matier in the booke conteined, readie waye and recourse maye with a weat fynger easily bee foūd out.

            THE PREFACE OF DEsyderius Erasmus of Roterodame unto a dukes soonne of his countree
            
               FOR asmucheas ye did so gentely afore receiue ye other litle bookes whiche I had then sent as a poore earnest penie (suche as it was) of my good herte &amp; mynde towardes your grace right noble prince, &amp; not onely your self, but also bothe your moste noble parentes did so courteously accepte thesame: I haue thought good at this presēte to ioyne to ye saied bookes some other thyng bothe more meete for your noblenesse &amp; also (except I be muche deceiued) more profitable for your studies. I haue therfore out of euerie good autour for the moste parte, chosen and gathered, that the Grekes callen apophthegmata, that is in englyshe, notable good and brief saiynges: for that I sawe none other kynde of argumente or matier more fitte for a prince, especially beeyng a

young manne not yet broken in the experience of the worlde. In deede ful conueniente and meete to bee knowen are those thynges whiche ye aunciente philosophiers haue lefte in wrytyng of honeste behaueour, of wel gouernyng and ordreyng a cōmenweale, &amp; of kepyng warre. But what one manne emōg many thousādes (yea though he be nothyng cloggued nor letted wt any publique office or ministerie) hath so muche vacaunte tyme, yt he maye bee at leasure to turne ouer &amp; ouer in the bookes Plato wryteth al his bokes in dialogues &amp; in the most parte of theim Socrates is one of the disputers which Socrates pretēdyng echewhere simplicitee &amp; ignoraūce did ofte tymes cō
                  uince diuerse of theim that he reasoned wt all in their owne artes, vsyng to thē suche kynde of reasonyng as here in the texte is recited of Plato the ragmannes rolles, and the taryers or toyes of the subtile knackes, of the drye mockes, and of the lōg inducciōs by familiar exaumples, whiche Socrates dooeth there vse? And as for Aristotle wrote tenne bookes entitleed Ethica, that is, of honeste behaueour &amp; vpright liuyng and dealyng.Aristotle, in deede he wrote largely of maners and behaueour, whiche werke he entitleeth in greke Ethica, but by ye entriked obscuritee and derkenesse therof he appereth to haue wrytē thesame for philosophiers, that is to saie, for menne of high learnyng, and not for a prince. More clere and more plain to bee perceiued, been the werkes that ye same Aristotle wrote of householdyng entitleed Oeconomica, and of ordreyng a citee or cō
               menweale entitleed Politica, but this māne euerie where requireth a reader bothe

that he readeth, &amp; also well at leasure. And besides this, forasmuche as he vseth no suche manier of rhetoricall style or writyng as maye moue the affectes &amp; passiōs, he dooeth not so greately hold or rauyshe a mannes mynde, yt is wholy bent &amp; geuē to princely cures &amp; buisynesse. Sembleably in ye bookes of morall philosophie, whiche Marcꝰ Tulliꝰ wrote, many thynges there been of suche sorte, as it is not muche to ye purpose, nor anythyng at all necessarie, yt princes knowe theim: Of whiche kynde are those thynges yt he treacteth of the consummacion of good and ill (whiche wee christian menne would call of blisse and damnacion) with more subtilitee of reasonyng and argumentacion, thē fruite to edifie in vertuous liuyng. And suche manier thynges seruen well for ye purpose of theim, who all the dayes of their life dooe nothyng els but talke &amp; dispute of honest

               e. But for a māne born to bee a prince and a gouernour, it is necessarie yt a readie &amp; shorte waye to learne vertue bee quickely dispeched, and not at leasure disputed &amp; reasoned in woordes. Now resteth the histories whiche because thei dooe represēte to the yi
                  •
                (euē as in a peinted table to bee vewed) aswell the noble actes of prowesse, as the contrarie, and that not without pleasure and

delectacion: seme to bee more fitte for greate menne. But in this behalf though a prince might haue voide tymes enough to peruse ye infinite multitude of bookes of histories, what manne wer hable to comprehend and kepe theim all freashe in his memorie? But like as those persones who been dooers in ye game or feacte of wrastleyng haue in a readynesse at all tymes certain suer poinctes and wayes bothe to catche holde, and also to wend out of holde, when neede is, so thei yt trauaill in the busie occupacions of peace and of warre must of congruence haue in a readynesse suer rewles, by whiche thei maye bee putte in remembreaunce what is in that presente case nedefull or expediente to bee dooen, and what not. And in this behalf, we see yt diuerse highly well learned mēne haue assaied &amp; taken peine by their good diligence to ease the carefulnesse of princes and noble menne, emong whiche, some haue writen lessōs of vertue in brief sentēces, as Theognis a Greke poete yt wryteth in Elegeiacal vses suche morall preceptes of virtue as been in ye litle treatise yt is reade vnder y• nam

                   of Cato. Theognis, and Isocrates a greke oratour wrytyng many litle treatises in prose.Isocrates: &amp; others haue wrytē the feactes of armes, or policies of warre, &amp; the goodly shorte saiynges of famous mēne as Ualerius Max. a latine autoure that wrote a werk of .ix volumes whiche he entitleed, of the saiynges and actes of noble menne. Ualerius Maximus, and Sextus IuliusSextus Iulius Frontinꝰ wryteth also in latine .iiii. volumes, whiche he entitleeth strategematū, that is to saie of armes, or policies of warre. Frontinus, whiche Frontinus declareth ye self fame thyng by diuerse other wryters before hym customeably to haue been

dooen. It is a thyng of no small tyme of leasure to serche out golde in the veines vnder the yearth, or to seeke precious stones in the sande or in the sea. Suche a feloe especially aboue others to a prince wt high &amp; weightie matiers contynually embusied dooeth acceptable seruice and pleasure, whiche to the same exhibiteth &amp; presenteth golde alreadie fyned &amp; made in fagottes or plate, &amp; whiche bryngeth to his hande precious stones that are chosen pieces &amp; well poolyshed, alreadie sette in golde, or vpon cuppes of precious metalle. And this kynde of pleasure &amp; good turne, whereas it hath of many wryters been attempted, yet (after my mynde and sentēce) no māne hath with more dexterite

Plutarchus, who after the settyng foorth of an excellente good &amp; passyng fruitefull werke of the liues of noble mēne, (in whiche werke here &amp; there been myngled and recited aswell the factes as ye saiynges of the same) he gathered in to one litle booke for the vse of Traianus Caesar ye best commended manne of all the Emperours that before his tyme had been, the notable saiynges of soundrie renoumed persones, by whiche as in a veraye true &amp; perfecte glasse the herte and mynde of euerie of theim is to

the yie of ye readers liuely and certainly represented. For in the actes &amp; deedes of princes, a good porcion of the laude and praise the Counsaillour maye clayme and chalēge for geuyng his auise the Capitain for his chieualrie, &amp; the souldyours for their stoutenesse. And a veraye greate porcion of ye same laude and thanke dooeth ladie fortune clayme to haue, by whose cōueighaunce ofte tymes wee see thynges not without high counsaill &amp; wysedome entreprised to haue a veraye vnluckie ende, and contrarie wyse y• misaduised temeritee and vndescreetenesse of some persones to haue right prosperous chaunce, and in ye ende to proue veraye wel. As it is reported that Siramnes the Persian, (a Capitain as I suppose) saied, when he was asked why his deedes wer not aunswerable to his ioyly saiynges, for because (saieth he) what I wil speake, lyeth in myne owne power, but how suche thynges as I dooe, shall ende or bee taken, standeth in the pleasure of fortune and of the kyng. Albeeit honeste purposes &amp; deuises are not therefore vtterly defeacted of their due laude and condigne praise. But the saied Plutarchus dooeth in this kynde ferre excede and passe all other wryters, not onely in choosyng ye best, but also in expounyng and declaryng

yesame. For these saiynges (whiche, as afore is mencioned, the Grekes callē apophthegmata) haue appropriated vnto theim a certain reason &amp; marke of their owne whereby to iudge, so that thei dooe plainly expresse &amp; sette out the veraye naturall inclinaciō and disposicion of eche speaker that thei procede frō, briefly, finely, quippyngly, and meryly within the boundes of good maner. And as euerie seuerall persone hath proprely belongyng vnto hym a faciō of his owne wherby he is commended, and whereby his saiynges &amp; dooynges haue a good grace orels other wyse: euen so like wyse hath euerie nacion, so that not one manier saiynges are conueniente for Alexander and for Philippus or Antigonus. One sorte are meete for Alcibiades: Again one facion agreeable for a manne of Lacedaemon, and an other for a Scythian or a Thracian: and a diuerse from yt again comely for a manne of Athenes, or for a Romain. Now, in expressyng &amp; vttreyng suche saiynges Xenophon seemeth to me somewhat weeryshe, Herodotus voide of quickenesse or life, Diodorus &amp; Quintus Curtius ouer full of woordes, and so foorth of the other wryters, whiche I surceasse by name to speake of. Plutarchus is a perfecte feloe in all poinctes, and therefore I haue

thought best thesame Plutarchus to foloe principally aboue all others. Wherefore all yt euer is cōprised in ye werke of this autour whiche he entitleed de apophthegmatibus, yt is, of feacte and brief saiynges, ye shall fynd here in this werke euerie whitte of it. Wee dooe all knowe that this werke of Plutarchus hath been twis translated out of greke into latine, first by Francisce Philelphus, and afterward again by Raphael Regius, with whom I was somewhat acquainted in the vniuersitee of Padwaye. Philelphus in diuerse places had missed yt cushē, whiche places Raphael dooeth restore and correcte, and yet somewhere stumbleth hymself. The truth is, thei bothe wer menne, and might erre, mystakyng a thyng yt thei read. Albeit either of theim mynded to bee nothyng els but a plain trāslatour of the greke into latine, but I for many causes haue thought better the saied Plutarchus to foloe, thē to translate, to expoune at large, then woorde for woorde out of greke onely to enterprete
                  •
                first that the stile might bee the more clere &amp; plain as beeyng lesse bounden to the greke woordes: (For this presēt booke of myne is not wryttē vnto Traianus, a māne bothe in greke &amp; latine excellentely well seen, and also in lōge experiēce of all manier affaires

And certes for myne owne parte, ye geassyng and redyng what diuers
                  •
                of these apophthegmes should meane or signifie, hath curstely troubleed &amp; vexed my braines, &amp; I cānot saie whether it hath some where beguyled me too. And in places not a fewe I haue had muche strougleyng &amp; wrastleyng with the faultes of enprientyng in ye bookes, at whiche it could not bee avoided, but that the enterpreters and translatours maugre their heddes did stumble. For it is

a thyng vneth beleueable how muche &amp; how boldely aswell the commen writers that frō tyme to tyme haue copied out the bookes of Plutarchus, as also certain yt haue thought theim selfes hable to countrolle and emend all mēnes dooynges, haue taken vpō theim in this autour who ought with all reuerēce to haue been handleed of theim and with all feare to haue been preserued from altreyng deprauyng or corruptyng. For neuer hath there been emong ye greke writers, (especialli as touchyng matiers of vertue and good behaueour,) any one more holy then Plutarchus, or better worthie of all menne to bee read. But the veraye same thyng hath prouoked persones desirous of glorie &amp; of lucre, to depraue &amp; corrupte this autour, to putte in more then he wrote, and also to leaue out of that he wrote whiche ought moste of all to haue feared theim from soo dooyng. For euerie wryter ye better accepted and sette by that he is, and ye greater name that he hath emong learned menne, so muche the rather shall he for lucre &amp; auauntage bee corrupted. That this autour hath been soo vsed, ye veraye diuersitee of ye Greeke texte not agreeyng one copie wt an other dooeth right well argue and proue. For all others omitted, to speake onely of this presēt werke that nowe

is in hand, the translacion of Philelphus hath certain thynges, whiche Raphael lefte vntouched, &amp; Raphael likewise some thynges of whiche Philelphus maketh no mencion at all. Besides this, where Plutarchus in the preface by expresse woordes dooeth plainly testifie that in the liues he had myngleed the saiynges and actes of noble mēne together thone with thother: &amp; in this werke for briefnesse to haue lynked together onely their apophthegmes or saiynges, yet dooe wee see right many thynges admixt &amp; putte in emōg ye apophthegmes whiche in veraye dede are no saiynges at all, nor any other thyng but me
                  •
               e pollices of warre which the Grekes callen Strategemata. Now in ye self same werke one and yesame thynges so often again and again repeated, dooen thei not openly crye this argumente and matier by some other feloe to haue been cōtamynated &amp; sloubreed? So yt wee maye now pardone yt in certain places an apophthegma is recited vnder ye name of the persone that it was spoken to, and not of hym by whom it was spokē, as of Lysymachus &amp; Philippus. For in this treactise of Plutarchus whiche is entitleed Collectanea, that is to saie a manual of soondrie and pretie histories and saiynges compiled together for all readers the aunswer

that Philippus made vnto Lysimachus, is told and reported vnder the title or chapiter of Lysimachus. But yet it was an higher poincte of presumpcion yt of one werke thei haue made it twoo. For because Plutarchus of the saiynges of Lacedaemonians, whiche been a veraye greate noumbre, had touched onely so many as for ye Emperour beeyng with many matiers sore embus
                  •
               ed, semed like to suffice. He, whosoeuer it was, (at lest if it wer but one feloe &amp; no mo that sette handes therunto) hath assigned to the saiynges of Lacedaemonians one propre volume, and that accordyng to the ordre of ye greke letters as thei stand in ye alphabeete, whiche Raphael in his translacion hath turned into the ordre of ye letters of ye latine A,B.C.

and kyngdomes as thei stand in rowe, &amp; in euerie of theim ye ordre of tymes, to euery of the kynges ioynyng his owne capitaines, &amp; to euerie of the capitaines their mates. Frō the Persians he cometh to ye Egyptiās, frō ye Egyptiās to ye Thracians, frō the Thracians to the Scythians, from the Scythiās to the Sicilians, from the Sicilians to the Macedonians, from thens to ye Atheniense, from theim to the Lacedaemonians, folowyng in euerie of these thordre of the tymes, and not of the letters in the alphabete. Frō the Lacedemonians he cometh to the Thebanes, frō the Thebanes to the Romaines, so that the reader by the saiynges of a fewe persones maye familiarly knowe the ordre of the whole historie, whiche ordre that feloe hath pieteously confounded &amp; trobleed and sette out of ordre, that soondreed and disseuered the saiynges of the Lacedemonians frō the others, &amp; yet here and there repetyng the veraye same thynges that Plutarchus had gathered afore vnto Traianus, albeit in soondrie places one thyng repeated is muche more often deprehended and openly found in the other werke of apophthegmes, but in bothe werkes so oftē as thesame fallyng in a slumbre and forgettyng hymself cannot lyghte on Plutarchus a writer of

precise diligence. More ouer, this parte hath no preface at all, and the preface that goeth before the apophthegmes vnto Traianus will not s
                  •
               rue to bothe werkes. Now, what thanke suche persones are worthie to haue whiche dooe in this wyse slabre and defyle ye bookes of famous autores, I will not at this tyme reason, but truely me thynketh it a veraye sacriliege. Yet of me (except a fewe saiynges of Lacedemonians, because the self same been repeated in the other table of rehersall euerie one of theim) is not so muche as one omitted af all that goeth abrode vnder ye name of Plutarchus partely to thēde that the reader beeyng rather a gredie glutton, then a mynion deintie peece might not mysse any thyng that he would faine haue: and partely, for that I sawe nothyng there but woorthie to bee knowen, though some tyme rehersed &amp; tould out of his right place. Neuerthelesse, all the whole werke I haue in manier made my propre owne in yt I dooe more at large and more plainely expresse the thynges that bee tolde in greke, puttyng in sometymes suche thynges as I had well perceiued to bee added in other autours, addyng also out of the other werkes of Plutarchus veraye many thynges whiche wer not in this presente treactise, &amp; eueriewhere

as it wer with litle brief cōmentaries openyng &amp; shewyng aswell the sense of ye apophthegme as also the vse wherfore, and how it maye serue, especially in those places whiche lacked some more light &amp; clerenesse, albeeit thesame haue I dooen briefly in fewe woordes, lest I should haue clene turned awaye from the nature of apophthegmes, whiche ought not to cōtein many woordes. But as for the ordre is wurse broken &amp; confused euē of me, then I found it there, for that, where at the begynnyng I had purposed to make rehersal but of veraye fewe and onely of the principall best sorte, when I was ones entreed in my warke, the veraye heate therof pricked &amp; sette me to chaūge my mynde &amp; to go on still a greate waye ferther, neither should I haue made any ende, had not this as ye would saie an hougemain sea of thynges stil freshe &amp; freshe comyng to mynde enforced &amp; driuē me to blowe retreacte &amp; to recule backe. For as Quintilian emōg ye vertues &amp; graces of a schoolemaister in grammer putteth this to bee one, that he bee in some thynges ignoraunte: so, in this kynde of argumēte it seemeth to bee some parte of diligence certain thynges to passe ouer and to leaue out. Therefore, I haue thought b

a coūbreous or troublesome, especially for y• if any thyng be in this presente supper leafte out, it maye at some other supper bee sette before my geastes after yt all this shalbe perfectely digested. And ye incōmoditee of ye ordre of thynges neglected &amp; not precisely kept I haue with a large reportorie or table redoubbed. For the title, it nothyng forceth to bee carefull or scrupleous, sens y• emōg those saiynges whiche Plutarchus vnder ye title &amp; name of apophtegmes hath gathered &amp; cō
               piled together, there bee many whiche an other māne would rather cal, scornes, taūtes, checkes, iestes, or merie conceipted saiynges to laugh at. But forasmuche as Marcus Tullius in puttyng a seueral distinctiō betwene eche of these kindes, hath takē earnest labour &amp; peine, without any effecte, &amp; forasmuche as Marsꝰ a right wel learned māne hath in this behalf nothyng satisfied Quintiliā, no, nor yet Quintilian in knowlage &amp; litterature ferre passyng Marsus hath satisfied hymself: I haue not thought it a thyng woorthe y• laboure in this behalf to bestowe muche buisie trauaill, cōtented &amp; thynkyng sufficiēte, here &amp; there by y• waye as occasion serueth to haue opened &amp; shewed the kynde &amp; the nature of the saiyng or of the merie iest
                  •
                Certes in those thynges that I haue of my

self added besides Plutarchus dooynges, I haue diligentely foreseen and prouided in no wyse confusely to myngle policies of warre (hauyng no saiyng of this kynde annexed vnto theim) and apophthegmes bothe together, and also that I would in no wyse putte in here any thyng but taken out of ye best allowed and thesame the moste auncyente writers bothe in Greke &amp; Latine: not that I am ignoraunte the later wryters to haue recited many thynges sharpely &amp; also pleasauntly spokē: but suche thynges as antiquitee hath made precious iewels and as ye would saie reliques, been of more autoritee, and meete it was that this werke should haue an ende and not bee infinite. Nor this thyng neither ought to moue any manne that one and thesame saiyng is of one autour ascribed vnto the persone of one māne and of an other autour is attributed to an other manne. For it forceth not so greately of what persone a thyng is spokē, as it dooeth, what is spokē: albeit in deede a famous speaker and one that hath the fauour and hertes of menne geueth to the saiynges muche weight and grace also. This thyng more often cometh in vre, then yt it needeth by exaumples to bee proued. But yet sometymes it chaunceth by reason that mannes

memorie failleth, albeeit there is no cause to the contrarie, but ye one and thesame sentēce maye procede frō soondrie speakers or wryters, whether imitacion be the cause therof orels chaunce, as for exaumple, this staffe of a metre in greke,

Out of Herodotus I haue had no greate lust to gather any greate noumbre of saiynges, because that most parte of theim appere to haue been inuented of that wryters owne witte. Like trashe and bagguage been those saiynges that are incidente in oracions, whiche the wryters of histories (eche as his witte serueth hym) are woonte to attribute to menne, albeit euen those dooe muche auaill aswell to the readers iudgemente as also to make a manne hable well to frame &amp; promptely to tell his tale.

And I praye you, what been the moralles of Plutarchus, but aresse hangynges with suche like colours pictured? More ouer those saiynges that seme moste fond thynges of all to laugh at, by well handleyng become maters of sadnesse. For what could bee a more fond thyng to laugh at thē Diogenes gooyng from place to place wt a cādle in his hande at high noonetid saiyng still yt he did seeke a manne? But in ye meane tyme by laughyng, wee learne that he is not by &amp; by in all the haste a manne, that hath

It geueth vs also a lesson that wee putte not our wholle trust and staigh in thynges externall and transitorie, whiche by many dyuerse chaunces are wt a trice taken awaye from a manne, but wee should acquire and purchace ye veraye true rychesse of ye mynde and solle, on whiche fortune hath no power ne dominaciō, soo highe a poincte of serious philosophie dooeth that fond toye of ye saied peuyshe harlotte Phryne, teache vs. For

For a finall conclusion, as often as vacaunte tyme is geuen, or the case requireth hilaritee and myrth, how muche more decente is it with suche maner saiynges as these been, to passe ye tyme, then to take pleasure of fables voide of honestee, voide of learnyng, and full of rebaudrie. I am of this opinion, that young children might muche more to their profecte and benefite bee exercised in the grammer schooles with themes, or argumentes to wryte on, of this sorte, then with matiers to make vpon, suche as been commenly vsed, (whiche themes for the moste parte, as thei contein nothyng but litle trifleyng senses voide of all pith or fruite, so dooe thei nothyng open the my

fondly spoken, that the hearers or readers cannot but laugh at it, maye bee turned or applyed to a serious vse and purpose. And this one thyng will I saie more. In sermones percase it is not conueniente to miengle iestyng saiynges of mortall menne with the holy scriptures of God, but yet might thesame muche more excusably bee vsed, to quicken suche as at sermones been euer noddyng, then olde wiues foolyshe tales of Robyn Hoode &amp; suche others, whiche many preachers haue in tymes past customably vsed to bryng in, taken out euen of the veraye botome and grossest parte of the dreggues of the commen peoples foolyshe talkyng. Iulius Caesar Emperour of Roome susteinyng the burden of so many chargeable affaires of encoumbraunce and buisynesse, aswell at home in the citee when peace was, as also abrode in warrefare, vsed to drieue awaye ye werynesse of takyng thought for suche thynges as he had in his hedde to carke &amp; care for, wt taūtyng woordes of bourdyng and iestyng: with whiche he was so greately delited, that he did allow and take in veraye good parte suche as wer spoken by others euen against his owne persone, so that thei wer propre

feacte and well conueighed. Uneth any other of all the aunciente Emperours of Roome was either more holy and better disposed, orels more encoumbreed with buisynesse of the worlde, then was Augustus Caesar: But again, what persone in this kynde more merie conceipted? Of Marcus Tullius, I will nothyng saie at this presente, who is of many menne thought in iestyng to haue remembred or considreed as he ought to haue dooen neither measure nor yet honestee and comelynesse. Xenocrates ye philosophier was of a more soure nature, a ioyly feloe in some other respectes: but Plato moe tymes thē one auised hym, with sacrifice to purchace the fauour of the Graces, that is, so to applye hymself, yt his saiynges and dooynges might haue more grace and bee better accepted &amp; taken of the worlde. zeno beeyng outright alltogether a Stoique vsed to call Socrates the scoffer, or the Hicke scorner of the citee of Athenes: because of his merie conceiptes and tauntyng, that he neuer ceassed to vse: but yet is there no manne, but he will saie that Socrates was a more godly feloe then either of those twoo whiche I named last afore. And to leaue vnspoken that no mennes

                of pleasaunte myrth, vndoubtedly Socrates, Diogenes, and Aristippus would serue better for teachyng and trainyng young children, then either Xenocrates orels zeno. That if the moste wyse aunciente fathers wer not deceiued in that thei thougt it conueniente, with certain knackes of pleasaūte delectacion to lure y• tendrenesse of youngth vnto the loue of sage ladie Sapiēce, muche more is thesame conueniente for one that is bothe tendre of age, and also born to bee a prince or gouernour: whom as it becometh to bee vigilaunte, and to haue in all causes a diligente yie, so it behoueth not either to haue a soure couutenaunce hymself, orels to leat any persone with an heauie looke to departe from his presence.

With these reasones I might sufficientely haue defēded myself though I had gathered together nothyng but merie iestes, wheras now suche saiynges of myrth are but here

and there in fewe places entremedleed emong saiynges of grauitee and sadnesse, as sauces of the feaste. That if I shall perceiue your grace herewithall to bee well pleased: it shall neuer repente me of this my labour &amp; seruice dooyng, though (as some persones shall percase iudge) it bee ouer poore and base. Others dooē wryte bookes for theim that bee ferther entreed bothe in yeres and knowelage: I dooe (as ye would saie) feede the tendre age of a young babe of noble byrth. That if your grace hath alreadie outlearned this geare (as with all my herte I would wyshe that ye had) yet I knowe well it will stand with the good mynde and pleasure of thesame, that the commen studies of young scholares haue been ferthreed, and haue fared thus muche the better for your sake. And I shall perhappes here after geue you thynges of more saigenesse and grauitee, when ye shall perfectely haue learned all this by herte. For these thynges must in any wyse bee cunned by herte, to thende that ye maye haue theim euer readie at hande.

            ¶ A preamble of the enterpreter vnto the saiynges of SOCRATES.
            
            
               FOrasmuche as emong al the gentile Philosophiers of old tyme, ther is none, either for integritee of maners, for vpryght liuynge, for quickenes &amp; (as ye would saie) liuelynes of saiynges, or for the perfeccion of philosophical humilitee &amp; suffreaunce to be compared with Socrates: And in consideracion that thesame Socrates firste of all that sorte attempted to wythdrawe menne from vayne studies and desires, to the readynge of morall philosophie, &amp; to the trade of vertuous lyuyng, not onely so framyng and ministryng his doctrine, that he might effectually persuade vnto menne vertue &amp; perfecte honestee, but also directyng ye exaumple and paterne

of all his life and dooynges to the same ende, effecte and purpose: we haue thought moste conuenient to set his saiynges first, as of ye which the studious reader maye gather &amp; take suche presidentes of holy and innocent liuyng, suche nourture of vncorrupt maners, suche lessōs of myldnes and pacience, suche discipline of eschewyng vice, and al carnall pleasures, suche paterne of bridelyng and refreinyng all sensualitee, suche exaumple of cōtemnyng worldly gooddes and other vanitees, as shall bee to thesame right pleasaūt, fruitefull, &amp; profitable.
         
         
            
            
               The saiynges of SOCRATES.
               
               
                  OUt of the mouthe of  
                  SOCRATES it came,God is to be folowed as nere as we maye. the goddes to bee of al the best and moste blissed: and that euery manne the nerer that he draweth to the facions and representaciō of thesame goddes, the better he is and the more heauenlyke. If ye saye one God, as he saied goddes (for there is but one God) nothyng maye be spoken more Christianelyke.
               It was also a saiyng of his, that  nothynge ought to bee desired of god in mennes praiers,What sorte oure payers ought to be. but vndre this fourme, &amp; with these wourdes (suche thynges as bee good for vs) wythout any ferther addicion. Where as the moste parte of menne dooe aske in their praiers, one a wyfe wt a good dourie, an other asketh ryches, this manne honours, that manne rewle, some long lyfe, as it were prescribyng &amp; appoynting to God what he shuld dooe.

But God of hym self before we aske, doeth best knowe what is good and expedient for vs, and what is not.
               
                   His mynde was, that sacrifice should bee dooen to ye goddes with as smal charges as myght bee,Sacrifice to God ought not to bee ouer sumptu
                     
                        •
                     us. for that the goddes, as thei haue no neede of the gooddes of mortal mē so thei haue more regarde to ye hertes of those yt offre sacrifice, then to their riches: otherwyse, forasmuche as commenly the wurste disposed persones haue moste aboundaūce of worldly gooddes, ye worlde wer at an eiuil poynte, if god wer better pleased wt the sacrifice of ye naughtie persones thē of ye good. And to yt ende he vsed greatly to allow this verse yt foloeth of the greke poete. Eche mā to his power in any wise.
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Unto the goddes to dooe sacrifice. This saiyng toucheth vs Christian menne also, which dooe bestowe co

better content and please God, yf that, that is aboue good housbādlyke clenlynes, we would bestowe in almes vppon our Christian brethrē, beeyng in extreme nede. Sembleable measure he taught to 
                     •
                  ee vsed also in receiuyng and intreteinyng of geastes and straungers when thei resorte to vs, euer hauyng in his mouthe the verse aboue written: Eche man to his power. &amp;c.
               Whē it was told hym by a frende  of his, that agaynst the receiuyng of certain geastes into his hous, he had sclendrely prepaired for theim:Sclendre fare is to much for eiuill geastes. If thei be honeste menne (ꝙ he) it wylbee enoughe: yf not, a greate deale to muche.
               One lesson of his was, that mēne  should abstein frō meates whiche might prouoke a manne to eate hauyng no appetite nor beeyng houngrie,Uertue &amp; temperate diet to bee vsed. &amp; also frō that drynke whiche myght tempte a manne to drynke, not beeyng thyrstie. For meate &amp; drynke we ought not to vse, but as the the necessite of the bodye requireth.
               
               
                  Socrates saied,Houngre is y• best sauce in the worlde for meate. the best sauce in the

world for meates is to be hoūgrye. Because thesame bothe sweeteth all thynges, and also is a thyng of no cost ne charge, and by this meanes dyd he for his part euermore eate and drynke with pleasure &amp; delite, for he dyd neither the one, nor the other, but whē he was houngrye and thirstie.
               
                   Yea and to endure houngre and thirst,The 
                        ••
                     st and appetite must bee refreined. he had purposely exercised &amp; enured hym self. For after swette or greate heate taken in the wrastleyng place (wher thei vsed to wrastle and walke for the exercise of theyr bodyes) wher as others wold nedes haue drynke by and by in al ye hast: Socrates would neuer drynke of the firste cuppe. And beeyng demaunded wherfore he dyd so, that I maye not accustome my selfe, ꝙ he, to foloe my sensuall appetites, lustes and desyres.In takynge meates and drynkes, reason is to bee fol
                        •
                     ed &amp; not the appetite. For sometymes though a manne bee thyrstie, yet is it a noysome and daungerous thyng to drynke. And in this case whē reason aduiseth to forbeare, &amp; the appetite pricketh to take drynke, a manne ought rather

to foloe reason.
               He saied that suche as had well  broken theim selfes to vertuous liuyng and 
                     •
                  ēperate diete dyd perceiue &amp; take of ye same,Inordinate liuyng, is much more peynful thē vertuous liuyng. both muche more pleasure and lesse peines thē suche as with all high cure and diligence dyd on euery side make prouision to haue all thynges of pleasure.The inconueniencies ensuyng of inordinate sensualytee. Because the pleasures of inordinate l

                  ūt, yf a man haue been accustomed vnto theim.
               He saied yt it was a foule shame  yf a manne wylfully beeyng as a bonde seruaunt to pleasures of the bodye,To bee as a bond seruaūt to the pleasures of ye body made himselfe suche an one as no manne would by his good wyll haue to his seruaunt at home in his hous. And in suche persons he saied that there was nomaner hope of recouerie, excepte yt others

would praye to the goddes for thē that (for asmuche as thei wer vtterly determyned to bee bond seruaū
                  tes) their fortune might be, to gea

                   good and honest maisters. For his opinion was, that no persones dooe liue in a more fylthy or beastely, and in a more wreched or miserable state of bondage, then suche as bothe in mynde &amp; bodye, been captiue to naughtee pleasures.
               
                  
                  Socrates beeyng demaunded for what cause he would not beare some publique office in gouernyng the comē weale sens that he could singlare good skyll howe to administre thesame:To dooe bn̄fite to a whole multitude. answered, that persone to dooe muche better seruice in a cytee whiche dyd make a great noūbre of menne apte &amp; mete to bee rewlers in a comē weale, then hym that could well gouerne thesame in his owne person onely.

Neither dyd Socrates suppose yt person worthie to bee called a craftie beguiler of menne which of some foolysh body (persuaded therunto) dyd receiue &amp; take either money or some pece of plate which he were not hable to repaye, but muche rather those persones he pronounced woorthie to be accoūpted deceytfull bobbers

                   He was woont to saye, that there is no possession or treasure more precious thē a true and an assured good frēde,A true frēde is an high treasure. nor of any other thyng in the worlde besides, to bee found more good, profyte orels pleasure. And therfore, he saied, that many persones dooe arsee versee,Thei dooe ars

               Of a certain manne somewhat  sharpely beatyng a bonde seruaūt of his owne, Socrates asked wherfore he was so vengeable eagre, marie (ꝙ the other) because this knaue, wheras he is the greattest gluttō &amp; rauener of meates that maye bee, yet is he the moste idle lubber aliue and whereas he is the moste couetous feloe in the worlde, yet is he the moste slowethful that is possible to bee.Many menne punyshe in others thesame thynges in whiche thei

                  Olympia, with the tediousnes of trauaillyng so ferre aiourney, vtterly discouraged, thus saied Socrates: wheras beeyng here at home thou walkest too and fro, ofteseasons in maner all y• whole daye, aswell afore dyner, as before supper: yf thou stretch ye walkynges that thou vsest at home, &amp; laye theim on lēgth by the space of fiue or sixe dayes together yu shalt easyly reache to Olympia.

daunger, losse or trauaill must bee susteined about any honest maters, wee fynd excuses, wee will none of it, it standeth clene against our stomakes, whereas in maters not woorth a blewe point (for I will not saye in thynges vnhonest) wee will spare for no cost: Thus some persones beeyng inuited and exhorted to falle to the studie of lettres, make their excuse that thei bee sickely,To take pein or trauaill in honest maters eche man fyndeth excuses. that the

               An other certain manne cōplainynge  that he was euen doggue werie, and clene tiered with goyng a long iourney, Socrates asked, whether his boye hadde been hable enough to keepe foote with hym all the waye? he saied, yea. Went he leere (ꝙ Socrates) orels charged with the charge of any burdē? he carryed

a good preatie packe on his necke

                   saied the manne. And what? doeth the boye finde any faute that he is werie, ꝙ Socrates? Whē the feloe had saied, naye, &amp; art thou not ashamed (saied Socrates) of suche nicenes, yt gooyng on ye waye emptie &amp; voide of any burden, thou shouldest bee werie, sens that he hauyng caried a fardelle cōplaineth not of werines.Nicenes and tendrenes maketh men vnapte to labour. 
                  Socrates declared the seruaunt in this behalfe to bee in muche better case then the maister, that for asmuche as he was better e

(I suppose) to this, that the Greke woorde,

                  , that vpon the bodie might not bee laied a more heauie burden then it wer well hable to awaye withal. For this sillable,

as he made hys oxen euery daye fewer &amp; fewer, yet required in any wise to bee accoūpted a good cowheard: but yet a thyng muche more stādyng against reason, if a manne would desire to be reputed a good gouernour in a commē weale, whē he dayly diminisheth the noumbre of his people. These woordes he spake aferre of against Critias &amp; Charicles,
                  
                     Critias and Charicles, were twoo of the thirtie tyrannes in Athenes.
                   which had put to death many of the cytizens, neither was thesame vnknowē vnto theim. For Critias manaced &amp; thretened hym, that onelesse he chaumbreed his toūgue in season, ther should ere lōg bee one oxe the fewer for hym. And what he thretened in woordes, he perfourmed in dede. For by ye meanes of Critias was Socrates put to death.
               He had chosen out of the olde  autours certain verses whiche he vsed veraye often tymes for prouerbes, emong whiche this verse of Hesiodus was one:

                     
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        .
                     
                        
                        Idlenes euermore worthie blame.No kynde of laboure is a thyng of shame,
                     But idlenes euermore, worthie blame.
                  
By this verse he did counsail young folkes not onely from idlenes, but also from all vnprofitable or vn

                  yng, in reuellyng or banquettynge, and in whoorehountyng.
               
                   Also this verse of homere as shewen bothe Gellius and Laertius:

                     
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        .
                  
That is.

                     Aswell within our hous as without.
                  
By this verse he did not onely call backe suche as would geue eare to hym, from buisie medleyng with other mēnes maters,To bee ouerfull of medleyng in euery bodyes maters. but also from al kyndes of learnyng beeyng not necessarie to bee had: (as from the exa

                  he aunswered nothyng els but that menne had no knowelage at what seasons thei should come abrode with their salettes on their heddes. A thyng muche like to this dooeth Laertius father vpon Diogenes.
               
               He saied yt he woondreed, where  the cunnyng makers of images in stone or metalle, did with all their possible studie and diligēce, the vttermust of their power, that a stone might bee in figure and shape euē
                  
veraye like vnto a liuely creature, that thei did not sembleably prouide, that theim selfes might not bothe appere, and also bee in veray deede like vnto stones insensate. In deede, some writers there bee of this opinion, that Socrates, before he diuerted to spende his tyme in philosophie was a werker of imagerie in stone.
                     Socrates a maker of stone images, afore he went to the studie of philosophie. And that is the cause why he dooeth make the moost parte of all his similitudes by images of Maceons werke.
               
                   He exhorted young spryngalles, euer now &amp; then earnestly to vewe and behold theimselfes in a glasse:Young folkes, to vewe theim selfes in a glasse. to the ende, that if thei wer beautifull and of good feacture of bodye thei should beware to commytte nothyng vncomely for thesame: if otherwise, that the defaultes of ye bodie might with exercise or furniture of the witte, &amp; with honestee of maners &amp; behaueor be redubbed.The defaultes of ye bodye must with honestee of maners, bee redubbed.

                  He had sodainly called twoo or  three welthie riche menne to supper with him: and his wife Xantippe takyng great care for the mater because the prouision was veraye sclēdre.
                     Xantippe, was Socrates his wif y• curstest quēne that euer wetted cloute. Take no discoūforte (saied he) for if thei be menne of an housbādlyke or thriuyng sorte,
                     Honest geastes, taken all maner fare in good parte.

Bothe the one parte and y• other of this sentence might iustely shake of from vs all the curious and chargeable pompeousnes and desire to excede, in receiuyng geastes to dyner or supper.
               He saied, ye many persones dooe  liue purposely euē to eat &amp; drynke:Some persones liue onely to bee gluttons. and that he contrariewise, did eate and drynke, to the ende that he might preserue his lif. For that he vsed these thynges, not for sēsualitee of ye bodye,Feede onely to maintein life. but for y• necessitee of nature. This sentēce did the poete thus expresse in one of his satires woorde for woorde.
               
                  
                  Non uiuas ut edas, sed edas, ut uiuere possis.
                  Liue not as a glutton, styll for to eate.
                  But feede to maintain life, by thy meate.
               
               
                   Those persones whiche would geue credence vnto the vnlearned and vnexperte multitude of the people, Socrates affermed to dooe euen like, as if a māne refusyng one pece of money of fowre grotes, would not take it in paymente, and yet a great noumbre of like refuse peces cast in an heape together, he would allow for curraunt &amp; receiue theim in paymente. Whom ye would not trust by hymself alone,He that is not to bee trusted by hymselfe, is not to bee trusted in a multitude, of suche like as he is. is not one whitte better to bee trusted in a great rable of suche lyke feloes as hymself is: for it forceth not how great a noumbre thei bee, but how graue and substanciall. A counterfaicte peece of coyne, bee it euen in neuer so great an heape, is a countrefaicte peice. This maketh against the estemyng of witnesses by the multitude of theim and against the iudgementes of the commen people beeyng vnlearned.

                  AEschines sued to bee one

of the noumbre of Socrates his disciples and scholares, and did shamefastly laye pouertee for his excuse, saiyng that it was a great greef vnto hym, where the other frendes of Socrates, beeyng welthie, gaue vnto hym many great gyftes, that he had nothyng for to geue, except his owne self:The gētle towardnesse of Socrates ī receiuyng scholares. dooest thou not vnderstand (ꝙ Socrates again) how great a presente thou hast brought and geuen me, except percase thou estemest thyself at a lowe price?The office of a good schole maister.

The death of good menne,The death of good mēne, is not to bee wailled. euen for this pointe is not to bee wailled, that thei bee put to execucion without deseruyng:A muche more miserable thing, to haue deserued punishemēt, thē to haue suffred. but thei been double woorthie to bee wailled for, whiche suffre death for hayneous offenses, but yet of the two, a muche more miserable thyng it is, to haue deserued punishement, then to haue suffreed.

                  Socrates had two wiues at ones Myrtho and Xantippe. Therefore to a certain manne greatly meruaillyng to what vse he kepte two women at ones (especially beeyng scoldyng quennes, euer chidyng &amp; braullyng) and did not beate or driue theim out of his doores, thus he saied: these women dooe teache me at home within the hous, ye pacience &amp; suffraūce which I must vse whē I am abrode forth

of doores. Beeyng exercised afore and well broken with the facions of these twoo, I shalbee the better and more gentle to liue or to deale withal, for ye coumpaignie of other menne.

Whiche thyng when Socrates was asked, he answered, that he had well deserued, to be auaunced with veray high honoures &amp; rewardes, and to haue contynuall fyndyng for terme of life, of the charges of ye citee, frely allowed vnto hym, whiche honoure and preemynēce was estemed and accoumpted the highest that coulde bee emong y• Grekes. With whose answere the iudges were so sette on fyer with angre, that thei cōdemned to death ye moste innocente persone of the worlde.
               
                  Socrates mette full butte with Xenophon,
                   in a narrowe backe lane, where he could not stert from hym.

when he espyed hym to be a young strieplyng of rare towardnesse, &amp; like to proue so well as fewe did, he helde out his staffe, &amp; charged hym that he should not a foote ferther. As soone as he stode styll, Socrates asked of hym,The autoritee of Socrates, in maters of philosophie. where soondrie wares were made and sold, that mēne did commenly occupie, when Xenophon had therunto readyly &amp; quickely shaped an aunswer: Socrates eftsons demaunded, in what place of the citee, menne wer made good, honest and vertuous,Fewe ꝑsones know or take heede, where vertue is to bee learned. when the young manne had aunswered, that he was of that mater ignoraunte: Then come with me (ꝙ Socrates) that thou mayest learne. Frō yt tyme forthward begonne Xenophō to bee disciple and scholare vnto Socrates.Howe Xenophon became scholare vnto Socrates. It is a thynge contrarie to all good reason, to haue knowelage, where thou mayest bee serued of a welfauoured &amp; clenly garmēt or of a fair cuppe, and to bee ignoraunt, wher thou mayest purchace the good furniture of the mynde and soule,The furniture of the mynde, That is vertue and cunnyng.
               
                  On a certain tyme as he was  walkyng before his dore a greate pace, euē tyl the gooyng awaye of the daye light, when one of the folkes that passed by, had saied: what meane ye Socrates, by thus dooyng? I procure my selfe some cates for my supper (ꝙ he) menyng of houngre, whiche he prouoked with chafyng vp and downe Marcus Tullius dooeth set it out with these woordes: That I maye suppe the better, I dooe with walkyng procure houngre,One of y• be

But ye poetes dooe fable that he was slain, with lightenyng of Iuppiter, because he had wyth his cunnyng of Physike restored Hippolytus again to life. whiche duely to paye, in no wise bee ye negligente. Euen as though he had vpon the takyng of a medicinable drynke, perfectely recoured again all his helthe. For Crito was an honest citezen in Athenes, and a true frende vnto Socrates, and the other as good, and as louynge a frende again to hym in all pointes, of mutuall familyarytee. Crito had afore dooen all that euer he might possible dooe, yt Socrates should make

meanes to saue his life. And in Socrates there was so rooted a certain veine of honest merynes, euē naturally geuē hym in his cradle, yt he could iest and speake meryly euen at the houre of death, for these are reported to haue been the last woordes that euer he spake.

Ueray sound slepyng taketh away for the tyme all operacion of the bodily senses, &amp; the solle beeyng departed away from the bodye, shall at length returne again into his tabernacle, that is to saie  into thesame bodye.
               Thesame vsed also many tymes to saie, that if the vniuersall calamitees of all menne should bee gathered all in an heape to gether,If the vniuersal calamitees of al men wer in an heape egually to bee distributed, eche manne would rather take his own again, then eguall porcion with all his feloes. &amp; ymmediately to eche manne seuerally by hymself should bee distributed eguall porcions out of thesame heape, it would come to passe, yt eche manne would rather choose to receiue his owne former calamitees again, then eguall porcion wt his feloes out of the cōmune heape.

Albeit I thynke the saiyng of Socrates to haue this sense and menyng, that to haue made a good begynnyng or entreaūce, is not a lytle but a lytle more, or a degree ferther then a lytle. That is to saye: as good a forth deale, and auauntage towardes the ende of the werke, as if a good porciō of thesame wer already finyshed.

For who so hath ones made a good begynnyng of his werke, shall easily bryng thesame to suche ende, and to such passe and effecte as he would dooe.

I suppose he mened, yt menne ought not to purchace, but landes &amp; possessions moderate, whiche it might well stand wt a bodies ease and commoditee, bothe to receiue of his auncestours, and also to leaue to his heires. For ouer greate possessions of landes, as thei bee not purchaced ne gotten without muche a dooe, so thei come to the heires hādes not peaceably nor without gret trauerse.

And in deede no small vtilitee &amp; benefite it is, that groweth to comenweales by the sapience and high knowlage of learned princes.
               
                   Beeyng asked what fruite he had receiued of the studie of philosophie:The fruite of philosophie is that a manne shall speake plainly as ly

lyeth in my mynde. For neither did he feare menne of power and autoritee,Aristippus feared no manne nor disdeigned any persone. nor disdeigne inferiour persones of lowe degree, forasmuche as he had a mynde free and clere voide, aswel from hope, as from feare, he was no mannes dogbolte, ne in any mānes bondage, nor held vp y• yea &amp; naye of any persone contrarie to yt he thought in his own herte.
               When certain persones did by ye 
                   waye of reproche cast in his teeth that he liued gentlemanlike and passyng deintyly,Aristippus loued gaye apparell &amp; good fare. beeyng one that professed philosophie:Whether in gaye clothyng and in dentie fare bee any vice. If that wer a vice (saieth he) it should in no wise bee dooen in ye solemne feastes of the Goddes. For in thesame solemnitees mēne vsen of a coustome bothe to bee gayly &amp; trymmely apparelled, and also to haue the moste deyntie fare yt can bee gotten or dressed. And forasmuche as the Goddes been earnest enemies to all vices, thei would not bee appeaced, but rather sti

                  red to wrathe &amp; angre by suche maner royaltee, if thesame conteined any spiece of synne or viciousnesse. Thus in deede he auoided &amp; clene defeacted the cōtumelious checke, but he did not shewe what was best.
               
                  
                   Unto Dionysius demaundyng of hym,Phylosophiers wold liue wel, though there wer no lawes. what high thyng was in the philosophiers more then in other menne, he saied: that if all lawes wer anulled &amp; fordooen, yet would wee liue still after one maner rate. The moste parte of people is barred from offendyng,To a physophier,

                     eason is a lawe. onely by prestripcions of lawes, but a philosophier accoūpteth and vseth reason in stede of lawes: not dooyng that is vpright &amp; honest, because the lawe hath so commaunded, nor refreining fro deedes of myschief, because the lawe hath forbidden thesame: but for that he knoweth the one to bee of it self vpright &amp; honest, and the other of it self to bee abhominable.
               
                  
                  Aristippus and Plato bothe of theim wer awaiters in ye court with Dionysius.
                  Plato &amp; Aristippuz bothe wer in courte with Dionysius. But Aristippus absteined not frō the pleasures of the courte when thei came in his waye. Plato euen in the middes of all superfluitees &amp; excesse of ye court

                  ade in all behalfes. Therefore when Plato checked and rebuked Aristippus for that he was

so sweete mouthed, and drouned in the voluptuousnesse of high fare, he asked of Plato, what he thought of Dionysius, whether he semed to bee an honest manne, or not, when he had aunswered, yt he seemed to bee honest: And yet he (ꝙ Aristippus) liueth much more delycately then I dooe. Therefore nothyng leatteth, but that a māne bothe maye liue takyng his parte of good fare, and also liue well and vertuously.There is nothyng to ye cō
                     trarie, but yt a manne maye liue, takyng parte of good fare, and yet liue vertuously.
               
               Unto Dionysius demaundyng how  it chaunced, that the philosophiers did frette and weare the threshholdes of riche mennes houses, &amp; not contrariewise,Why phylosophiers haūt ryche mennes houses &amp; not cōtrariewise. he saied: because the phylosophiers dooe knowe what thei wante, and the riche menne knowe not. The philosophiers dooe knowe that without money, there is no liuyng,Without money there is no liuyng. and therefore thei drawe to suche persones as been hable to geue theim, that thei haue neede of. That if ye riche menne, did like well vnderstand &amp; perceiue, that thei lacke and neede wisedome,

thei would muche more haunt and trede the dores of the philosophiers houses. For more miserable is the pouertee of the mynde and solle, then of the bodye

                  More miserable is the pouertee of the mynde thē of the bodye. And so muche the more pieteously beggered, and with extremitee of neede oppressed are the riche mēne: that thei dooe not vnderstand, of how precious and how necessarie a thyng thei bee destitute.
               
                   Beeyng asked in what pointe ye learned diffreed frō the vnlearned:What difference there is betwene the learned &amp; the vnlearned. in thesame pointe (saieth he) that horses well broken, dooe diffre frō the vnbroken.As

As an horse not yet broken, is by reason of ignoraunce what he should dooe, and of skittishenesse, nothyng apte, but all vntoward for any vse or seruice to bee putte vnto: so he that is forceably rewled or violently leed with affeccions, that is to saye: with the corrupt mocions and sodain pangues or passions of the mynde (whiche pangues and affecciōs or passions, nothyng but onely phylosophie, maistreeth and subdueth) is vnapte and vnmeet

               On a tyme when he was in a  shippe sayllyng towardes the Citie of Corinthus, and a tempeste beeyng sodenly arysen, made theim euerye mynnte of an houre to looke when the shippe should synke &amp; bee drowned,Aristippꝰ beeyng in ieoperdie of death feared &amp; weaxed pale.

that death is not to bee feared, yet neuerthelesse loke with pale faces by reason of feare in tyme of perill &amp; ieoperdie, and we beeyng menne vnlearned are in no feare at all? Aristippus aūswered:A great differēce be

Aulus Gellius addeth this to it, I feare perishyng of the life of Aristippus, and thou fearest not leesyng the life of a knaue: whiche woordes yet for all that bee more full of galle,We feare not harme taking of thynges of small valour. then to bee conueniente for Aristippus, whose vrbanitee &amp; merieconceipted woordes are not of so poynaunte a sorte. We feare not the harmetakyng of thynges of veray small valour, wherof cometh the latin prouerbe, Hydria in foribus. 
                     
                        Hydria in foribus.
                     
                     A stene or a canne in the more, is a prouerbe, by whiche Aristoteles and other auncient writers, vsed to signifie a thyng so vile &amp; of so small valoure y• no māne would attempte to purloyne or stele, or if any did, there wer no greate losse in it, forasmuche as an other of like sorte might bee euery where gotten for an halfe peny or lesse money. And because it was a thyng of so small price, if an yearthen potte stoode in a bodyes doore, no theef or false knaue would stoope to take it vp, nor set his mynde to conueigh it awaye. But ouches &amp; perles wt other like thynges, dooen such feloes studie how to come by. As for a pitchaer euery bodye may without any feare of stealyng sette (if hym please) in the open strete. So writeth Plutarchus, that the bryers whiche by theim selfes wil catche and take holde on eche bodyes gowne, euery manne neglecteth and passeth by, but vynes and oliues no manne but desyreth and wil seeke for. Seneca also in his epistles writeth in this maner. Many persones dooe passe by thynges that lyen open, but for thynges lyyng hidden in secrete corners, thei will make narrowe serche. Thynges curiously and suerly sealed, or faste locked vp, dooe saye to a theef, come steale me. It seemeth not woorthie takyng vp from the grounde, whatsoeuer lyeth abrode And thynges lyyng open a breaker of houses will not foyle his handes withall: but to breake into secrete corners, is sette all his mynde and desire.
                   A stene or a canne in the doore. For this respecte Aristippus found a merie toye, that the other feloe chaunged not colour: not forthat he was of a better stomake &amp; courage, or of more hardinesse in tyme of perill, but because forasmuche as he was a feloe of no price, but a villain and a rascall, and had a mynde or solle clere voide of all vertue, it should haue been a small losse or none at all, if he had turned vp his heles and

perished. A manne of profoūde learnyng &amp; highly endued with sapience, perisheth not, but to the sore losse &amp; dāmage of the commenweale.
               To a certain persone makyng  his vaunte, that he had veray good sight in soondrie facultees or disciplines, (as though he had learned, all that might bee learned,) Aristippus saied: like as, not those per

This profite haue I gotten by Socrates (saied he again) that the oracion, whiche thou hast made in my defense and commendacion hath been true. The oratour had defended hym as beeyng a right honest manne, and innocēte in the mater that was laied to his charge. And, that euer he was a manne of suche sorte, as he was by the oratour reported for, had been the acte of onely Socrates whose scholare he was in philosophie. It is no parte of an oratours playe, to make that a manne bee of perfecte honestee and vertue, but that he maye appere to the iudges to bee suche an one, although in veray deede he bee not so. Then a thyng of muche more excellēcie it is, that the philosophier dooeth perfourme, then that the oratour can dooe.

                   A certain manne was in hande with Aristippus, to take his sonne to schoole to hym, but when the philosophier

required in rewarde for his peines of teachynge, fiue hundred drachmes (whiche was aboue the summe of eight poundes sterlyng.) The other partie beeynge clene discouraged with the greatnesse of the pryce, saied: for lesse money or better cheape then so, myght I bye a bondeman, that should dooe me tall and hable seruice: But here now (ꝙ Aristippus) thou shalt haue twain.The peines of teachyng is woorthie great wages. His menyng was, that with thesame summe of money whiche was to bee paied for one bondeman, he should purchace bothe a philosophier yt should stand hym in good steede, and also a sōne obediente to his father.Moste parte of mēne geue moore wages to their horse kepers, then to the good bryngers vp of their children in learnyng and vertue. He did feactely checke the iudgemente of the commē people, who in no behalf are greater haines and niggardes of their purse, then in prouidyng to haue their children well and vertuously brought vp in learnyng and maners, and dooe bestowe more coste on kepyng or dressyng their horses, then on the good guydyng and ordreyng of their sonnes and doughters.

For the moste parte of riche folkes casteth away their money, either vpon horses, or on buisie and sumptuous buildynges, orels other ryottous wayes: wheras it ought to bee geuen in almes to good and honest menne, if thesame bee in neede. Yea and a manne maye an other waye also vnderstād &amp; applye this saiyng. Aristippus

to his owne persone apperteinyng he had with money hyered ye helpe of an oratour to pleade for hym at the barre, he saied: why, that is not so greate a woondre, for when I would haue any supper dressed too, I hyer a cooke. The other parties mynde was, that it should appere ye oratour to bee of more excellēcie or dignitee then ye philosophier,A philosophier to bee of more excellencie and dignitee, then an oratour. for this pointe, because ye philosophier gaue money to haue his helpe, &amp; he turned it clene cōtrarie

But he that maketh requeste to heare any one thyng or other out of philosophie, declareth that he would learne philosophie of the philosophier.

The kyng beeyng for this answere of Aristippus in an high fume cōmaūded hym to sitte in ye lowest place of al, at the table. Aristippus in this case nothyng discōtēted, saied in this maner: Sir kyng it is your pleasure (I perceiue) to nobilitate this place &amp; to make it honorable.Not the lowe place maketh the manne of lesse dignitee, but of ye worthynesse of ye persone much honoure groweth to the place.

Wherof the poetes haue feigned Iuppiter to bee the God of heauen, Pluto of helle, and Neptune of the waters.

               When Diogenes on a certain tyme treactyng, and makyng a declaracion  of an earnest and saige mater of philosophie, had not one hearer that would geue diligente eare vnto hym,How Diogenes rebuked the people, for that thei wer readie to harken vnto maters of lightnesse, &amp; slacke to geue eare to maters of grauitee. he begoonne to syng suche an other foolyshe song, (as Robyn hood, in barnesdale stood &amp;c.) &amp; sembleed as though he would daunce withall. And when a veraye greate multitude of people had now gathered together, &amp; swarmed about hym, he tooke theim all vp for stumbleyng, because that to thynges foolyshe and seruyng to no good purpose, thei came rennyng by whole flockes, &amp; as merye as pyes, where as to serious maters, &amp; thesame muche auailable vnto good liuyng, thei neither would resorte or approche, nor diligently geue

                  e So it was, that Demosthenes on a tyme beeyng hotte in makyng an oracion to the Atheniens: the people were soodainly in suche a greate rore emong theimselfes, that thei gaue no eare to Demosthenes, but rather troubleed hym in his tale. Wherupon he saied, that he had twoo or three woordes to saie vnto theim, requiryng theim to hold their noyse, &amp; to geue good eare what he would saie. Immediately was made silence, and Demosthenes in this wyse begoonne. A certain young manne had hyered an Asse from Athenes, to the towne of Megara. And bothe the parties wēt together in coūpaignie. And beeyng somer season, about noone the sonne weaxed so feruente hotte, that for to couer theimselfes from the sonne, either partie would needes hyde hymselfe vnder the shadoe of the Asse. But thei fell at variaunce about it, and either partie would needes putte of the other. The one saied, that he had sette out the Asse to hyere, but not the shadoe, the other on his partie auouched, that forasmuche as he had hyered the Asse, he had best right and title for the tyme duryng, to the shadoe of the Asse to. And ymmediately after thus much of the tale told, Demosthenes came downe frō the pulpite or scaffolde. The people wer so fain to heare the reste of the tale, that thei caught Demosthenes by the gowne &amp; held hym backe, nor would at no hande suffre hym to departe, but required hym in any wyse, to make an ende of his tale. Then saied Demosthenes vnto theim: Why are ye so desirous and fain to lysten a tale of the shadoe of an Asse, and haue no will ne mynde at all to herken me speakyng of maters weightie, serious, and touchyng the commen weale? shadoe of an asse.

For Homerus hymself was blynde, and made voluntarie, and soong ex tempore, that is without studie. And after his death Aristarchus gathered all his makynges together, and compiled theim into two werkes, the one entitleed Ilias whiche is of the battaill and destruccion of Troie, &amp; the other Odyssea, of the wandreyng of Ulysses, ere he could geat home to Ithaca, after that Troie was burned. And because those werkes were cōpiled by patches, thei wer called, rhapsodiae, as ye would saie patches or

And if at any tyme suche occasion chaunced, that thei must goo foorth of doores, he brought theim foorth vnkembed, &amp; vnpiked, without cotes, barefoote and bareleggued, and not a woord with theim. Ouer and besides this, he did breake theim in the feacte of huntyng, in this behalf folowyng the guyse and custome of the Lacedemonians.The Lacedemoniās broke and exercised their children and youth in huntyng. By reason of these thynges it came to passe, that Diogenes had muche reuerente attendaunce dooen to hym by the saied children, and that he was for their sakes highly estemed

and accepted with their father Xeniades. Other writers tellen the tale, that the cryer by the biddyng of Diogenes did in this maner speake his woordes. Is there any manne that is willyng or mynded to bye a maister?
               When he sate hym downe in the  sale tyme, he was forbidden to sitte on his taille, &amp; was charged to stād vpon his feete, for this entente (I suppose,) that the cheapman might the more easyly vieue &amp; trye what he bought.

               The reporte goeth, that in the  hous of thissame Xeniades he contynued and liued vntill he was a veraye aged manne, and was there buiryed of his owne scholares.

Then Diogenes dryuyng theim awaye wt a staf, saied: I bade menne to approche, and not dounge hylles or draffesackes. He thought not the name of a manne to bee a congruente or a right name for suche persones, as liued not accordyng to reason, but were leden and rewled by sensual mocions,Thei that liuen not accordyng to reason, but are leden by sensuall affectes and passions, are not worthie to bee called menne. and pangues, after the maner of swyne and other brute beastes.

                   Beeyng asked the question whether he had any manne or woman seruaunte of his owne,Diogenes had neither māne ne womā seruaunte. he aunswered, no in good feith, not one in the world. And whē the demaūder had ferther saied, why, who shall then carrye thee to thy graue, in case it fortune thee to dye? Marie, ꝙ he, euen whosoeuer shall haue neede of my hous, for to dwell in it.

                     •
                   shalbee brought to their graues,Diogenes toke no thought howe or by what ꝑsones he should bee buiryed. and laied in ye grounde: of all suchemaner thought or care was Diogenes clere voide, castyng no doubtes, but that there should come one or other bodye, that would conueigh his dedde carkesse

out of doores, though it wer for nothyng els, but to make the hous voide. Albeeit his chaunce was in fine, to bee veraye honestly buyried.

               The grace of the saiyng consisteth in this poynte, that Diogenes feactely applyed the verse of Homere to his purpose, by saiyng

                   When he had heard twoo cunnyng lawers contendyng, trauersyng, and earnestly laiyng the lawe betwene theim selfes together,What Diogenes saied of twoo lawers contendyng, laiyng y• one against the other. about a mater of thefte: he saied, thei wer false knaues bothe of theim, and condemned aswell the one as the other, allegeyng that the one had committed thefte, and that the other had lost nothyng. Signifiyng that bothe of theim were well woorthie

to bee hanged. The subtilitee of this presente saiyng consisteth in this poynte onely, whoso pieketh or priuely stealeth awaye any thyng, hath some auaūntage and gayne thereby: and the partie, from whom any suche thyng is piel

Here al so the ready aunsweryng muche contrary to the expectacion of the demaunder geueth to ye saiyng all his grace. The other partie looked for another maner aunswer, as the whiche in his question askyng, mened of the kynde of wyne.
               To one that saied vnto hym: all  the worlde almoste dooeth mocke thee. Yea, but for all that, saied he

again: I am not mocked. And this a manne would thynke to bee a thyng vnpossible, that one should strike you, and yet ye not bee striken. But Diogenes denyed that he was had in derision, either for that he was no manne woorthie why, orels for that he thought the skornyng of the fond people, nothyng to touche hym,Diogenes thought the skornyng of the fond people, nothyng to touche hym. nor hymself to be in any pointe the wurse for thesame.
               
                   To another persone affermyng that it was a miserable and a wretched thynge to liue here in this worlde. No, saied Diogenes, to liue is no miserable, ne wretched thyng, but to lede an eiuil or a vicious life is a thyng wretched and miserable.To liue is no miserable thyng, but to lede a vicious life. The moost parte of folkes calleth it a miserable life, or a doggues life, yt is subiecte or in presēte daūger of trauailles, of bodyly greef or peines, of sickenesse or diseases, of losse of goodes, of exilinges and banyshementes, &amp; many sembleable incommoditees. But the philosophier rekened nothyng to bee 
                     •
                  iuill or miserable, sauyng that was lynked or coupleed with vice and dishonestee.Nothyng is eiuil, but that is coupleed wt dishonestee &amp; with vice.
               
               
                  
                  Diogenes had a seruaunt, that was

called Manes,
                  Manes the seruaunte of Diogenes. and when this Manes had taken his heeles and renne awaye from his maister, the frendes of Diogenes, auised hym to seeke out the renneawaye: Marie sir, ꝙ Diogenes,
                  The aunswer of Diogenes to his frendes auisyng hym to pursue after his bondemanne, that was renne awaye from hym. that wer a madde thyng of all thynges, if Manes dooe alreadie willyngly liue without Diogenes, and Diogenes could by no meanes liue without the coumpaignie of Manes. yet many menne pursue after their seruauntes in mynde and purpose, to bee auenged on thesame: but Diogenes had regarde to the neede of vsyng or occupiyng a seruaunte. That if any one philosophier bee of righter sorte then another, it is he, yt nedeth fewest thynges.The best philosophier is he that feeleth nede of fewest thynges. And in consideracion therof, Diogenes would not in any wise seme wurse then his bondmanne. For Manes had renne awaye from hym, because he could lyue without his maister well enough.
               On a tyme Diogenes made al his  dyner with Oliues onely: and tarte and other sweete meates, anone after brought in place, he floung frō hym, &amp; therwithall soūg this greke

                     •
                   And so, to one demaundyng what maner a doggue he, for his parte was, he feactely aunswered, and saied: when I am houngry I am a litle mynxe full of playe, and

when my bealy is full, a mastife. For that, when he had good luste or appetite to eate, he would fawne vpon folkes, &amp; speake theim faire, and when his bealy was well filled, he wouldeuermore buff, and barke, and byte agood.
               Beeyng asked, whether philosophiers  wer eaters of tartes or sweet meates too?Philosophiers eate allmaner meates as others y• are menne. yea, of all thynges (saied Diogenes) euē like other christian bodyes. In this also, he made an vndirecte aunswer, to the question that was asked of hym. The demaunders question was, whether it wer conuenient for philosophiers (who professen frugalitee or temperaunce) to feede of tartes and marzepaines, the meates of dē
                  ty mouthed persones. Diogenes sembl

                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , but to bee more then half a foole, so shaped his aunswer, as though philosophiers were no menne in deede, and yet did eate meates to the diete of manne belongyng. For euery kynde of ye brute beastes dooe not eate allmaner thynges at auenture without excepcion. The oxe eateth heigh, the lyon woll none of it: the sheepe loue the leffes and toppes of wieloe twygges, the horses would haue otes. Some byrdes are fedde with the beries of Iuniper, some foules

are deuourers of fleshe, some dooe fede altogether on fyshe. And to this alluded Diogenes.
               
                   When Diogenes on a tyme at the table emong coumpaignie, was eatyng of a tarte, and one that sate in yesame coūpaignie, saied: what art thou eatyng now Diogenes? (demyng that ye cynike philosophier had no knowelage what maner thyng a tarte shoulde bee:) he aunswered breade, of a veraye good makyng, or breade veraye well handleed in the bakyng. Pretendyng, that he knewe not, what it was. To others it was sweete tarte, to Diogenes it was no better then breade, who did not eate it for sensualitee, or for to sweete his lippes, but for his necessarie foode and susteinaunce.

gatherest of, a feloe not many dayes agon hanged hymselfe. Marie (ꝙ Diogenes) and I will purifie and clense it again. The other partie supposed, that Diogenes beeyng so aduertised would haue forborne ye tree inquinate or polluted, in that it had borne a dedde carkesse. But Diogenes beeyng free and clere from all spiece of supersticion,Diogēes clere voide of all spiece of supersticion. estemed the fruite to bee no poyncte the more polluted, or ympure for that respecte.
               Markyng one that was a greate  prouer of maisteries in the games of Olympia,
                  What Diogenes saied whē he sawe a chalenger of Olympia set an earnest yie on a wenche. to sette an earnest yie on a commē stroumpette, in so muche that he turned his hedde backe, &amp; behelde hir, after that she was gon past hym, he saied: loe, how a principall ramme, for the touthe of Mars hymself, is leed awaye in a bande (his necke sette clene awrye) by a damisel, that is as commen as the cartewaye. He thought it a mater of laughter for the feloe to bee a prouer of maisteries with picked or chosen menne of price, &amp;

thesame to bee haled or drawen awaye as a priesoner without any chordes at all, by a shiten arsed gerle.
               
                   Well fauoured or beautyfull stroumpettes,Beautyfull stroumppetes Diogenes likened to sweete wyne tempered with dedly poyson. he auouched to bee like vnto bastarde or muscadyne, tēpered &amp; mixte with dedly poyson. For that thesame caused in deede at the begynnyng, delicious pleasure &amp; voluptee, but euē at ye heeles of whiche pleasures, ymmediately ensued endlesse doloure and wofulnesse.
               
                   As he was makyng his dyner, euen in the open strete: when a greate noumbre stoode rounde about hym for the straungenesse of the sight, and euer emong made a criyng at hym, doggue, doggue: Naye, ꝙ Diogenes, ye bee doggues rather, in that ye stand roūde about a māne beeyng at his dyner.Diogenes called theim doggues, y• stood rounde about hym whyle he dyned. For that is one of the commen propretees that doggues haue.
               
                   When mencion was made of a boye in moste detestable abomynacion abused, Diogenes beeyng asked

what countreeman the boye was: Made aunswer, by daliyng with a woord that might bee twoo maner wayes taken, and saied: he is a Tegeate. For Tegea, is a citee of Arcadia.
                  Tegea, a citie of Arcadie. And therof is deriued a noune gentile Tegeates,

               when he sawe a feloe now takyng vpon hym to practise &amp; ministre  physike,How Diogenes mocked one that from a wrasteleer fell to bee a physician. who had afore been a commen dooer in the games of wrastleyng, but in deede, was a veraye slouche, and a veraye dastard he saied vnto thesame: wilt thou now by course ouerthrowe theim again, that haue heretofore ouerthrowen thee?

As for ye menyng of Diogenes was, yt the partie was nowe as eiuill a physician, as he had afore been a false herted wrastleer. A mery ieste muche like to thissame there is in the poete Martialis, of a feloe which frō a physiciā, hauyng become a fighter in harnesse, did none other beeyng Hoplomachus then what he had doen beyng a physiciā.

               Certain persones highly-magnifiyng and praisyng the bounteous  liberalitee of one that had geuen to Diogenes a thyng what euer it was: And why dooe ye not praise

me to, saied he, yt haue deserued to haue it geuē me? For to bee worthie a benefite, is more thē to haue geuē a benefite, accordyng to yt the sentēce of Publius Mimus:To bee woorthie a benefite is more then to haue geuen a benefite.

                   restitucion of his robe or mantell,The aunswer of Diogenes to one yt had geuen hym a mantell, and would nedes haue had it from hym again. he thus made a woondreous feacte and pleasaunte aunswer. If thou gaue it me freely, I haue it: if thou diddest lend it me, I dooe stil occupie it. Signifiyng, yt he was nothyng mynded to restore it home again, whether it was of free gifte, orels by the waye of lone for a tyme that he had receiued it. It is shame for a bodye to require again that he hath freely geuen. And it is a pointe of inhumanitee hastyly to snatche awaye, that ye occupier hath neede of, and cannot well forbeare.

should bryng foorth a wenche and thesame conueighed away, should haue a manne childe of an other womans bearyng, laied by hir in stede of hir owne, or if a woman should countrefacte trauaillyng and labouryng of childe, and haue an other womans childe laied by hir, and vsed as though she had been deliuered of it hir self in veray dede,) that childe so impropreed to a wrong mother maye proprely in latin bee called partus supposititius, as ye wold saye in englyshe a childe mothered on a woman that neuer beare it, or, a chaungelyng, and suche persones are euer after called supposititii, or, suppositi.

of a philosophier, euen that veraye pointe is to bee a phisophier outright.To shew nigh towardenesse of a philosophier, is a great porcion of beeyng a philosophier out right. Halfe notyng, philosophie to bee a thyng of so high difficultee, yt euen to countrefeacte thesame, and to shewe any towardnesse of it, is no smal porcion of philosophie. As yt persone hath an high pointe, and a greate fordeale, toward beeyng a kyng, that cā expertely and cunnyngly, in gesture &amp; countenaūce represente ye state of a kyng. So in deede, whoso coūtrefeacteth or maketh shew or countenaunce of a thyng, dooeth as muche as in hym lyeth, imitate &amp; foloe all the facions to thesame belongyng. And by imitacion to drawe nigh to all the facions or pointes of a philosophier is a great parte of beyng a right philosophier in deede, that is to saie, of beeyng a studious and peinfull labourer to atteigne philosophie or perfecte sapience.
               A certain persone brought a  childe vnto Diogenes, to thende that thesame childe, might take some parte of his doctrine. And so, to cō

                   Those persones who talked muche of vertue,Suche persones, as talked of vertue and liued not vertuously, Diogenes likened to an harpe. &amp; yet did not lede a vertuous life, he affermed to bee like vnto ye harpe, whiche with the soune or melodie did pleasure and good to other, but itself neither perceiued, ne heard any thyng at all. This saiyng varieth not veraye muche from the saiyng of Saint Paule,1. Corin. xiii. of a tynkleyng cymballe.

And beeyng asked why he so did, he saied: This am I of purpose earnestly bent al dayes of my life to dooe. Menyng, that to dooe the duetie &amp; parte of a right philosophier,The better philosophier the more earnestly bent to discorde from the people. is, in all accions or thynges to bee dooen, all yt euer maye bee to discorde and to bee of contrarie wayes frō the multitude or commen rable of the people, for because the moste parte of folkes are lede with carnall lustes and appetites,The moste parte of mēne are lede wt carnall appetites. and not by reason or good discrecion.
               Beholdyng a yoūg mā, bothe of  apparell &amp; of demeanure, nothyng comely ne conueniente for one that should bee a māne:How Diogenes tooke vp a young māne yt apparelled &amp; demeaned hymself vnmannely. Art thou not ashamed, ꝙ he, to bee more backe frēde to thyself then the mynde or wille of nature self hath been? For

she created and made the a manne and thou dooest diguyse and reforge thyn owneself into a womā. The selfe same woordes maye bee well spoken of many an one, whom, where as nature hath created and made menne, theimselfes of their owne voluntarie inclinacion, fallen from their propre nature and kynde, to the abusions of swyne, &amp; other brute beastes.
               
                   When he sawe a certain mynstrell, settyng his instrumente in tune,How Diogenes rebuked a mynstrell of inordynate maners and behaueour. where hymself on his owne behalfe, was a lewde and vicious feloe, and of demeanure clene out of all good ordre and frame, he saied: Thou feloe, art thou not ashamed of thy selfe, that thou knowest the waye howe to sette tunes in true corde vpon a piece of woodde, and canst no skylle to frame thy life by the rewle of right discrecion and reason? This apophthegme too, appeareth to haue been deuised and drawen out of some others aboue writen.

The grace of the saiyng resteth in the collacion or comparyng of twoo contraries. For these twoo thynges will in no wise accorde, to despise an other, and to stand well in ones owne conceipte.

               Certain persones laiyng to hym  in reproche, that he was a commen crauer &amp; asker of thynges at euery bodye his hande, wheras Plato beeyng a philosophier (as he was) did

not so, he saied: well, Plato is a crauer aswell as I,Diogenes said yt Plato was a priue crauer and he and open asker.

               Whiche verse Diogenes abused in an other sense then Homerus did, to signifie yt Plato was euē as great a begger &amp; proller as he was, sauyng that Plato did craue priuely whispreyng in mennes eares, &amp; he apertely, makyng no counsaill of it.
               
                   Espiyng a feloe shootyng veraye eiuill at his marke, he sate hym down euen hard by the pricke: and to suche persones as demaunded ye cause of his so dooyng, he saied,Meryly spoken, lest he should by some chaūce hitte me. Signifiyng, that the feloe was like to hitte what soeuer other thyng it wer, sooner then the marke: yet other lookers on, conueighen theimselfes aside as ferre as possible is, wyde from ye marke, for feare of catchyng a clappe.
               
                   Those persones that shoote or

cast wyde of their marke, or other wyse mysse to hitte it, are saied proprely in greke 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , to lese their shotte or cast, or to shoote or cast awrye.What persones shoote or cast al awry. But Diogenes auouched plainly, not those persones to mysse to lese their shotte, or to hitte awrye, that wer wyde or shorte of their marke, but theim that directed and leuelled their cares and studies towarde sensual pleasures as towarde their marke or butte. For by suche pleasures,Through sensualitee mēne fall in to the deepe pitte of miserie and wrechednesse. thei seeke and desire to haue perfecte beatitude, whereas by meanes of thesame, thei fall or tumble down into the moste deepe pitte of miserie and wofulnesse.
               Beeyng asked the questiō, whether  death wer an eiuill thyng: by what meanes possible should it bee eiuill, ꝙ he,How Diogenes argued death not to bee an eiuill thyng. sens yt wee feele it not at ye veraye houre whē it is come? And when it is awaye, it is eiuill or harme to no body. As lōg as a man

hath perfecte sense and feelyng, he is aliue, so then death is not yet in place, that if thesame bee presente, then sense and feelyng is awaye. And eiuill is it not, that is not felt. This maner of argumentacion or reasonyng, certain writers ascriben to Epicurus. And in dede death it selfe is not eiuil, but the iourney or passage to death is pieteous &amp; full of miserie. Of thesame iourney if we stand in feare, all ye whole life of manne what other thyng is it, but a passage or iourney towarde death?

He plainly cōuinced that a kyng was not to bee feared, excepte he would to all the worlde denounce hymselfe to bee an eiuill or a myschieuous persone. But if that

wer a sufficient good argumente, he might thereby haue gathered and concluded yt God wer not to bee feared.

                   by these woordes commended vnto all menne,How Diogenes commended erudicion to all menne. allegeyng that thesame vnto young folkes geueth sobrenesse, to aged persones coumforte and solace, to the poore richesse, to riche men ornamēt or beautifiyng. For because that the tendre youth, beeyng of the owne propre inclinacion readie to fall, it brydleeth and restreigneth from all inordinate demeanure, the incommoditees or displeasures of a mannes later dayes, it easeth with honeste passetemps and recreacion, vnto poore folkes it is sure costage to liue by (for thei that are learned, bee neuer destitute of necessaries.)

               Unto thesame Antisthenes, at another  seasō, (for because it had come to his eare, that thesame Antisthenes, for loue and desire that he had to liue, did take his sickenesse somewhat ympaciently) he entreed with a woodknife by his syde. And whē 
                  Antisthenes bemonyng hymself had saied vnto hym: Alas, who will dispetche and ridde me out of these my peines?Death riddeth a bodye out of peines. 
                  Diogenes (the hanger shewed foorth), saied: euen thissame feloe

And beeyng expulsed from Siracuse, he went to Corinthus, 
                        •
                      there after that he had a certain space liued a bare life, at length for veraye extreme neede, he was drieuen to excogitate some way and meanes whereby to gette his liuyng. Wherupon he sette vp a schoole and teachyng of children, and so contynued vntill his diyng daye.
                  Dionysius beeyng expulsed and driuen out of his kyngdome, had ther sette vp. And heard his boyes saye their lessons veraye naughtyly. Dionysius in the meane whyle comyng in, because he thought verayly, that Diogenes had come to coumforte hym, saied: It is gently dooen of you Diogenes, to come and see me. And loe, suche is the multabilitee and chaunge of fortune. Yea, ꝙ Diogenes again,What Diogenes entreyng ye schoole of Dionysius saied vnto hym. but I meruaill, that thou art suffreed still to liue, that diddest perpetrate so muche myschief in the tyme of thy reigne. And I see, that thou art in all behalfes, euen as lewde a schoolemaister now,Dionysius as lewde a scholemaister, as he had been a kyng afore. as thou wer

               Another of the saiynges of thesame  
                  Diogenes was this: Emong the other sortes of menne, to suche as liue in welthe and prosperitee, life is sweete, and death hatefull: &amp; cōtrarie wyse, to suche as are with calamitee and mysfortune oppressed, life is greuous, and death to bee wished for: but vnto tyrannes bothe life and death are peinfull &amp; coumbreous.Unto Tyrannes bothe life and death are coumbreous. For like as thei liuen more vnpleasaūtely, then those persones who dooen euery daye with all their hertes wyshe to dye, euen so dooen thei none otherwyse stand in contynuall dred and feare of death then if thei ledden the moste sweete &amp; pleasaūt life in all the worlde.

                   This Philippus vsed many a tyme and oft to saye, that hym thought y• 
                  Atheniens to bee much happie, who could euery yere fynde the full noumbre of tenne soondry persones, whom to create their Capitains for bataill: where he for his parte in many yeres had found one sole Capitain for warrefare

This manne beeyng of passyng high prudence, and moste profounde experience or knowlage in the course of the worlde, did not insolently skippe and leape, or shewe tokens of ioyfull gladnesse for his well spedyng, or for the successe of thynges, but rather did suspecte and mystrust the cockeryng of fortune,The cockeryng of fortune is to be suspected &amp; mystrusted. whose nature he knewe to bee, that to whom she werketh vtter confusion and exterminion, thesame persones she dooeth first laugh vpon &amp; flatre with some vnquod prosperitee of thynges. To this mater apperteineth, that Plynius reporteth of 
                     Valerius Maximus, and the other Historiographiers writen, that Polycrates the Tyranne of the Samians, had liued many yeres in suche incōparable prosperitee, that in all his affaires either publique or priuate, neuer any thyng went against hym, nor any myschaūce fell vnto hym, in so muche that beeyng (as ye would saie) werye of suche contynuall successe of thynges, euen in despite of good fortune, (to the ende that it might not be saied of hym, that he neuer had in al his life any losse, or myschaunce,) as he rowed on the sea for his pleasure and solace, he willyngly and of purpose cast awaye into the sea a golde ryng with a precious stone in it, of valour vneth estymable. And yet in suche wyse did fortune flatre hym, that within a daye after, his cooke found thesame ryng in the bealy of a fishe, whiche he garbaiged to dresse for his lordes dyner, and restored to thesame his owne ryng again. Yet this notwithstādyng, in his later daies fortune chaunged hir copie, and Polycrates taken presoner by Orontes the high Capitain or leuetenaūt of Darius kyng of the Persians, was after moste peinfull and moste greuous tormentes, hanged vp on a iebette vpon the toppe of an high hyll.

Well then, sens it is so yt thou hast mo feloes besyde thyself to stande in eleccion for to haue this empier &amp; to weare the croune after my deceasse, so applye thyselfe that thou maiest at length proue an honest or vertuous and a weldisposed manne, that thou maiest appere to haue achiued the croune not by me, but by thyn owneselfe. This manne with right princely wisedome and experiēce endeued, did not with sweete wordes put his soonne in any cumforte, but putte the same ferther in feare, to thende that he might the more pricke hym foortheward vnto vertue, geuyng notice and intymacion that there was none other waye for hym to conceiue any hope to bee kyng after hym, excepte he shewed hymselfe a mā worthie to succede in ye croune, neither to bee of so greate momēte to attein and geat an empier,It is not of so greate momēte, to haue an empier, as to bee woorthie to bee a kyng. as woorthyly to haue deserued to bee a kyng of a royalme.

                   He had created and autorised one of ye frendes of Antipater to bee of the noūbre of ye iudges.Of antipater read in his saiynges. But afterward, when it was come to his knowlage yt the partie vsed to dye his bearde &amp; his heare, he deposed thesame again &amp; discharged hym of that office, allegeyng that who in the heare of his hedde was not feithfull and vpright,Who vseth deceipte and guile in small thynges, is eiuill woorthie to bee trusted in higher and more weightie maters. the same in publique dooynges semed full eiuill woorthie to bee put in truste. He vsed deceipte, and falshood in dyyng his heare, whereby was no great auaūtage no gaine to bee gotten, muche more was it like that he would vse deceipte and falsehood in publique affaires, where guile dooeth at

a tyme auauntage to a manne a good potte of wyne. And this ought to bee the chief care of kynges, that thei putte in authoritee persones vpright and void of all corrupcion to bee hedde officers in hearyng and iudgeyng of causes. And how maye that possibly bee, where the offices of sittyng in iudgemente bee sold for money, &amp; that persone appoynted and made iudge, not that passeth others in honestee and goodnesse, but that cometh first to enoyncte or greace the handes, of hym that geueth the office, or biddeth moste money for it? But with Philippus, no not the autoritee of his dere beloued frende Antipater might weigh and dooe so muche, but that he deposed the suspected persone from the benche and ordre of the iudges.
               Sittyng in iustice on ye benche  he had before hym, to geue sentēce and iudgemente vpō, the cause of one Machaetes, but he was so heauie of slepe yt he could in no wise hold vp his yies, ne geue his mynde, as he should haue dooen, to the equitee of the lawe.The equitee of ye lawe is, that ye lawers callen the epicai, whiche thei take for y• moderacion of all s

cryyng with a loude voice, had saied, that he appealed from thesame sentēce, the kyng beeyng angrye saied again, to whō dooest thou appeale? for the woorde of appealyng (whiche is euermore from the inferiour iudge and power to an higher) vnto kynges veray odious. Thē, ꝙ Machaetes, euē to your ownself sir kyng, do I appeale, if your grace will awake, &amp; with more earnest &amp; tēdre attenciō of mynde, heare my cause. Immediately here vpon, the kyng arose and stood hym vp. And when he had better weighed the matter with hymself, and well perceiued, that the saied Machaetes had had wrong,How Philippus vsed one Machaetes by his sentēce wrōgfully cō

And when Myrtilus required his promysse, Pelops caused hym to bee cast into the sea, whiche sea of his name was called Myrtoum. In the region of Pelopennesus wer these noble &amp; florente citees, Argos, Micenae, Corinthus, Lacedaemon, Patrae, the mountain of Malea lyyng on the sea coste Epidanrus, and these countrees, Arcadia, and Sicyona.

Graciously and with woondreous ciuilitee turned he the argumente of his frendes to the contrarie, thus: If thei bee of suche frowarde nature and disposicion, that thei mocke and skorne those persones, who haue dooen theim benefite, thei will dooe muche more annoyaunce and harme, if a bodye therunto prouoke theim with shrewd turnes or dedes of myschief. A manifeste token and prouf it was not onely of moderacion or paciente suffreaunce and of mercifulnesse, but also of a certain excellente high magnanimitee, a kyng to neglecte &amp; sette lighte by the hissyngs, of ingrate persones.

And at thesame season, it fortuned that one Demaratus a Corinthian a veraye familiar acquaintaunce &amp; frende of Philippus, pretendyng to bee one yt would hymself in al causes frankely, freely &amp; boldely saye his mynde, was come vnto Philippus.

               THE SAIYNGES OF ANTIGONVS THE FIRST KYNG OF THE MACEDONIANS
               This Antigonus was of all the successour
                     •
                   of Alexander moste puissaunt and mightie. And Plutarchus in ye life of Demetrius saieth yt Antigonus had by Stratonice ye doughter of Cor
                  
                     •
                  haeus twoo soonnes, of whiche the one he called (of his brothers name) Demetrius, and the other (of his fathers name) Philippus. And thesame Plutarcꝰ in the life of Paulus Aemilius and els where in moo places thē one saieth that this Antigonus euen by ye title of his birth and descente, claymed to haue the name of a kyng, &amp; first begoonne to reigne in Asia after ye deceasse of Alexander. Albeeit (as the said Plutarchus in the life of Demetrius testifieth) the successours of Alexander wer not euen at the first called kinges, but certain yeres after, whē Demetrius the soonne of Antigonus had on ye sea subdued Ptolomeꝰ the kyng of Egypte and had destroyed all his nauie, then came one Aristodenus a Milesian from Demetrius in poste, and salued Antigonus by the name of kyng. Then Antigonus not onely on his owne partie and behalfe vsurped the name, the honour, the estate, and y• ornamentes and armes of a kyng, but also sent vnto his soonne Demetrius a Diademe, that is to saie, a kynges croune, together with letters, in whiche he called hym a kyng. Antigonus reigned twoo and twentie yeres, and kept in ye tyme of his reigne many warres, &amp; at last was slain and dyed euen in the felde.
               
                  
                   1.
                     ANtigonus was an eagre and a sore manne in takyng exaccions of money of his subiectes.How Antigonꝰ excused his greuous exaccions of money emōge his subiectes. Wherupon, to a certain persone saiyng, Iwys Alexander was no suche manne: A good cause why, ꝙ he again, for he rieped Asia and had all the eres, and I dooe but gather the stalkes. Menyng that Asia sometyme the rychest &amp; welthiest countree of the worlde, had been afore his tyme spoyled by Alexander,Alexāder spoyled Asia and left it as bare as Iob. and that he must bee gladde and fain to scrape together what he might bee hable to geat emong theim, hauyng been afore in suche wyse pilled, &amp; lea
                     •
                  t as bare as Iob.
               
                   2. Beholdyng on a tyme a certain of his soldiours to plaie at ye balle hauyng bothe their iackes &amp; their salettes on, he was highly well pleased with the sight therof, and commaunded ye capitaines of thesame soldyers to bee called &amp; fette, to thentente to geue theim thāke,How Antigonꝰ vsed certain of his capta
                        •
                     nes which sate drinkyng whyle their soldyours exercised theim selfes wt plaiyng at ye balle in their harnesse.
                  
and to praise theim in presence of their capitaines: but when woord was brought hym, yt the said capitaines wer drynking and making good chere, he conferred their capitainshippes vnto those actiue souldyers, whiche had plaied at ye balle in their harnesse. All vnder one bothe punyshyng the sluggyshenesse of the capitaines, and with honour and promocion rewardyng ye actiuitee of the soldyers.
               Euery bodye meruaillyng that  wher in ye begynnyng of his reigne he had been a veraye sore manne,Antigonus in ye begynnyng of his reigne, a sore manne, but in the later ende ful of al mercie and gentlenesse. now beeyng striken in age, he gouerned his royalme with all mercie and gentlenesse: At the begynnyng, saieth he, it behoued me to haue a kyngdome, &amp; at this daye I haue more neede of glorie and beneuolence. Menyng, that an empier is ofte tymes by the sweord &amp; by roughnesse purchaced or acquired, but thesame not reteined, or long yeres cōtinued, without the honest opinion yt the subiectes haue of their

kyng and the hertie good wille of the prince mutually toward his subiectes.
               
                   Thesame Antigonus vnto his soonne Philip beeyng full of questions in presence of a greate noumbre,What Antigonus aunswered to his soonne beyng muche inquisitiue when y• campe should remoue. Albeit Plutarchꝰ nameth yt it was Deme
                     
                        •
                     rius yt was so inquisitiue and saiyng: Sir, when shall wee remoue the campe? thus aunswered: what, art thou afeard, lest thou alone of al the coumpaignie shalt not heare ye troūpette blowe? Notynge the lacke of experience &amp; skylle in the young manne, in that he would in the hearyng of a greate compaignie moue suche a question to his father, wheras in tyme of warre,The ententes &amp; purposes of price
                        •
                      ought in no wyse to bee vttreed in tyme of warre. the ententes and purposes of princes ought in no wyse too be vttreed ne disclosed, but as often as the campe muste remoue, a trumpette geueth a knowelage therof to the vniuersall multitude all to gether.
               
                   When his soonne the said Philip beeyng a young manne, had made woondreous earneste request and suite to haue his lodgeyng appointed hym at a wedooes house,How Antigonus disappointed the purpose of his soonne, seekyng to bee lodged in an house where his loue was that had three fair &amp; welfauoured doughters, Antigonus callyng for

ye knight herbynger, saied vnto y• same: wilt yu not see my soonne voided out of suche a streight corner? He did not discrye how ye young mannes herte was sette, although he knewe thesame to seeke wheron to bestowe his loue, but found an ympedemente by the narrowe roome of ye house in which the wedooe liued with hir three doughters.
               After that he had perfectely recouered  of asore disease and maladie well (saieth he) all this is no harme.Sickenesse putteth vs in remembraūce not to bee proude in hert forasmuch as we be mortal. For this syckenesse hathe geuen vs a good lesson, not to bee proude in herte, forasmuche as we bee mortall. Who had taught this heathen kyng suche a pointe of Philosophie meete and woorthie for any christian herte? his frendes lamēted &amp; bewailled as a great

The maladie had made his bodye leane and bare of fleshe, but it endued &amp; replenyshed his herte with sobrenesse and humilitee. It had shrew dely abated the strength of his bodye, but frō his herte it pulled awaye insolencie,Insolēci

                  Hermodotus a poete had in his versis writen Antigonus to bee ye soonne of Iupiter. Antigonus readyng thesame, saied:The humilitee of Antigonus. To this thyng was ye pissepotte bearer, neuer made priue nor of counsaill by me. After a veraye pleasaunt sorte mockyng the flaterie of the poete, and with no lesse humilitee agnisyng and knowlageyng the basse linage that he was come of, in comparison of beeyng soonne to Iupiter. Lasanum is greke and latin for an yearthē pissepotte,

                   A certain persone saiyng, that

all thynges wer honeste and iuste or leefull for kynges to dooe: by Iupiter, saieth Antigonus and euen so thei bee for the kynges of barbarous, wylde, and saluage nacions,How Antigonus aunswered one, saiyng al thinges to bee honest &amp; leefull for kynges to dooe. but to vs yt knowe what is what, those thynges onely are honeste,To good kynges on

He did with high grauitee dampe and putte to silence the flateryng woordes of the partie, by whose mynde and wille all thynges should bee permitted as leefull vnto kynges &amp; gouernours For truely a kyng is not ye rewle of honestee and of iustice, but ye minister of theim.A kyng is not the rewle of honestee &amp; of iustice, but y• ministre of theim. And would God the eares of christian princes neuer heard any lyke woordes spoken, or if thei did, that thei would with sēbleable seueritee reiecte &amp; abandon thesame. For what other thyng saiē those persones, who are alwayes harpyng on this streng, and syngyng this songe, that foloeth: what standeth with the lykyng and pleasure of a prince hath the

force, strength &amp; vertue of a lawe. And those who dooen afferme a kyng not to bee vnder bonde or subieccion of any lawes, and suche as dooen attribute &amp; assigne vnto a kynge twoo distincte powers, the one ordinate, &amp; the other absolute, of whiche the first maye dooe no more nor no other wyse but as the lawes and statutes of a royalme, as couenauntes and bargaines betwene partie and partie, and as leages and agrementes publique betwene royalme and royalme dooen regnire, and the other, whatsoeuer standeth with the pleasure, appetite, and phansie of the prince.
               
                  
                  Marsyas the brother of Antigonus had a mater of suite and trauerse in the lawe:What Antigonus saied to Marsyas his brother, besechynge yt an accion of his might bee heard &amp; iudged in a secrete place, &amp; not in open courte. but he besought the kyng yt the mater might bee heard and a secrete courte purposely holden at home within his house for it. To whom Antigonus in this wyse made aunswere. If wee dooe nothyng but accordyng to iustice, it shalbe mouche better that it bee doen in open courte, and in y• face and hearynge of all the people.

The naturall zele and tendre loue towarde his owne brother could not obtein of the kynge, to haue so muche as one iote of the lawe or of the ordre of iustice releassed.The vpright iustice of Antoignus. And as for Marsyas he cloggued &amp; bound on all sides wt this saiyng yt could not possible bee a voided. If thou knowe thy matier to bee naught, why dooest yu sue, or trauerse ye lawe? if yu knowe thy cause to bee good, and the lawe to bee on thy syde: why wouldest thou auoide to haue all the world priue to it, and labourest in any wyse to haue a mater of open courte to be doen secretely in hugger mugger,It is to bee greately mystrusted, if one labour to brynge a mater of opē courte into a secrete chaū

What thynge more full of mercie then this worde of pleasaunce?The lenitee &amp; mercyfulnesse of Antigonꝰ. or what thyng more full of pleasaūce then this deede of mercie? he sembleed and made as though he tooke not indignacion or displeasure for their speakyng eiuill of hym, but for yt thei did it so nere his nose, that thei might easely bee heard of the partie, on whom thei raylled.

cooke to his father) vnto this Aristodemus auisyng him to abate somewhat of his great charges and of his bounteous geuyng rewardes and fees, he saied.Howe Antigonus aunswered one Aristodemus auisyng hym to abate of his charges &amp; pēsions geuyng.

                   A certain young strieplyng, beyng a disciple or scholare of Anaximenes the rhetorician, pronounced in the presence of Antigonus an oracion deuised and made by his maister not without great studie, and the young thyng taught afore for the nones, and purposely brought in to pronoūce it, (as though the oracion had been of his owne makynge, and that i

                  Where it is afore noted yt Antigonus had twoo soonnes and named the one by his brothers name Demetrius, and the other by his fathers name Philippe, Plutarchus saieth that suche was the fame and bruite that went of hym. Albeeit (saieth Plutarchus in the life of this Demetrius) many chronicleers haue left in writyng, that this Demetrius was not the soonne of Antigonus, but his brothers soonnes soonne. For ye father of Demetrius beeyng deceassed, and his mother beeyng marryed vnto Antigonus, Demetrius beeyng a veraye young infante, was beleued to bee the soonne of Antigonus, &amp; muche the more, because that Philippe beeyng twoo or three yeares younger of age then Demetrius dyed, and Demetrius was by Antigonus made his heire apparaunte to succede hym in his croune and empier. with a great nauie &amp; with a greate puissaūce of soldyers for to deliuer the Grekes,Howe Antigonus exhorted his soōne Demetrius, when he sent hym foorthe with an armie to deliuer Grece. and to sette theim free from all yookes of homage or forren subiecciō: he saied, that glorie and renoume was like a beaken enkendleed or sette on fyer from grece, as from a mountain with an high toppe to extend &amp; spred lighte ouer all ye whole vniuersall worlde. Prickyng foorthwarde y• young manne with desire of glorie to make hym dooe the parte of a valiaunte

And Agamemnon was the hedde &amp; chief kyng of theim all. But at his returne frō Troie he was slain by his owne wife Clytemnestra, by ye helpe of Aegyptus who kepte hir by adulterie, because he had (as Clytēnestra supposed) slain Iphigenia his doughter and hirs in sacrifice vnto Diana at the porte of Aulis, when ye Grekes should take their viage towardes Troie. did sethe

                  Antigonus had on a season in his  dreamyng, seen Mithridates repyng golden corne, and therefore laied awayte to haue thesame Mithridates by the backe, and to despeche hym out of the waye. And when he had

opened this mater vnto his sonne Demetrius, he bound thesame by an oth to make no woordes at all of it. Wherefore Demetrius takyng Mithridates in compaignie with hym went walkyng vp and down on ye sea banke,The feithfulnesse of Demetrius towarde Mithridates his frend sauyng his othe vpright, and not breakyng the commaundemente of Antigonus. and with ye nether ende of his speare wrote in ye sande, as foloeth, Mithridates auoide the countree. Mithridates
                  Of this Mithridates kyng of Pontus, it is written that he was a man of a mightie greate stature, stronge of bodye, of a noble courage, of excellente witte and policie, and of incredible memorie. For where he was kyng of twoo and twentie nacions, it is certain that vnto euerie of thesame seuerally he made lawes, and kepte courtes, and ministred iustice in their owne toungues, and that duryng the tyme of his reigne whiche continued by the space of sixe and fiftie yeares, he neuer neded the helpe of any interpreter betwene hym and any of the nacions beeyng vnder his obeisaunce and subiection, but would talke with all and singulare persones of the saied nacions in their owne languages. He kept warre against the Romains many yeres. At last he was discoumfaicted by Lucius Scylla, &amp; vtterly ouercomed by Pompeius Magnus. And at last beeyng besieged in a certain castle by his owne soonne, he. toke poison to destroye hymselfe, but when he sawe yt it would not worke vpon hym (for he had by the continuaunce of long and many yeres, accustomed hymselfe to take euerie daye preseruatiues and ymmediatly vpon the preseruatiues to take poison purposely, that if any suche chaunce fell it might not hurte hym) he called one of his trustie seruauntes to slea hym, and where as the feloe beeyng with the veraye sight of his maiester dismaied, failled in herte

But this historie, forasmuche as it is no apophthegme, (for an apophthegme consisteth in woordes spoken) semeth to haue been put in by some other bodye. Then by Plutarchus who compiled the treactise of apophthegmes. Albeeit woordes after suche sorte and for suche purpose writen maye haue the force, strength &amp; place of woordes with the tounge and voice pronounced.
               
                  When the frendes of Antigonus
                   aduised hym, that in case he shuld wynne and take the citee of Athenes he should fēse and warde thesame with strong fortresses and sure garisons, to thende that it might no more fall to rebellion, and that he should with moste earnest cure &amp; diligence kepe it, as the foundamente,Athenes the foundamente of all Grece, &amp; ye onely poste to leane to. the staye or ye leanyng poste of all Grece: he aunswered that he had euermore been of this mynde,The moste sure garrison of a royalme, is ye beneuolence of the subiectes towardes their prince.

But ye Argiues sēdyng to either of theim ambassadours, and praiyng them to holde their handes, &amp; to absteine from dooyng iniurie to a foren citee which neither of theim bothe had any right or title vnto, Antigonus promised to departe and gaue vnto the Argiues in hostage therof his soonne Alcyoneus. But Pyrrhus, wheras he promised to dooe thesame, yet did it not, but by night entreed the citee vnawares and vnknowyng to the Argiue

                  Pyrrhus after pitchyng his tentes about Naplia, sent on the nexte morowe by an haralde of armes to bidde hym come down into ye plain, and there to assaye and trye what he could dooe in battaill. But Antigonus made aunswer, that his manier of battreyng stood not a whitte more in the furniture of harnesse and ordeinaunce, then in the oportunitee of tymes when to fight, &amp; that for Pyrrhus, (in case ye same wer werye of his life) there wer wayes many enough open or readie to dispeche and ridde hym out of the worlde.

But Augustus shewed hym another remedie, whiche was, that he should suffre the people to talke their pleasure, and to saie what thei would, so that

thei persuaded not to hym the thynge that were false.

                   A certain young manne named Herennius beeyng with many vices corrupted, the emperour had commaunded to auoid his campe and armie. And when the partie beyng discharged of his roome, did with fallyng on his knees, and wt most lamentable blubbering or weping in this maner beseche themperour not so to putte hym awaye: Alas sir, with what face shal I retourne into my countree? and what shall I saie vnto my father? Marie (ꝙ Augustus) saie, that I haue loste thy fauour. Because the young manne was ashamed to confesse that hymselfe had encurred the disfauour of Cesar, Cesar permitted hym to turne the tale in and out, and laie the wyte or blame on hymselfe the saied Augustus.

ieste of it, saiyng: yea marie this is euen in veraye deede to harroe and visite ones fathers monument. Yet ones again he dalyed wt a worde of double significaciō. For the latin verbe, colere, in one significaciō is to honour or to wurship, and in an other significacion it is to tille or to housbande, as grounde or any other sembleable thyng is housbanded. Whiche I translate to harroe or to visite, as we saie that Christe harroed helle, and visited hell when he descended downe to helle ymmediatly after his passiō, and pourged, scoured, or clensed the same of suche solles as hym pleased. And visityng is in englyshe a kynde of shewyng honour, as wee viset sicke folkes &amp; priesoners to dooe theim honour and coumforte.

As for exaumple, wee saie in latine of a manne that was not contented with suche thynges as wer in his dayes, or in his tyme praesentibus non erat contentus:This latine diccion praesens, may bee referred vnto the tyme past, the tyme that nowe is, and the tyme to come. we saie also in latine, praesens uita, this presente life that is now in ledyng, and thirdly, of a thyng at a more conueniente, apte, or propice tyme to bee dooen, wee saie in latine praesens in tempus omittatur, bee it omitted or leat alone vnto a tyme to serue for it, that is to saie, vntill a propice tyme of oportunitee and occasion herafter to come.

hymselfe wholly to the faccion of Sylla.
                  Pōpeius beeyng but a veraye young manne gathered an armie in Italie, before yt he was eit

And although he wer neither any officer of the citee, nor senatour, yet he gotte vnto hym out of one place and other of Italie a greate armie. And when Sylla had cōmaunded thesame to come and ioyne with hym, Nay (ꝙ he) I wil neuer present an hoste vnto ye high capitaine of Roome without booties or spoyles, nor vnfleashed on their enemies. Neither did he repair vnto Sylla, before that he had in soondrie battrees and encountreynges vanquyshed diuerse capitaines of enemies. Euen at the first date, shewed he a greate token and lykelyhood of a prince moste woorthie, and born to dooe greate thynges. It was not his entente to bryng vnto Silla, philip and cheiny moo then a good meiny, but to bryng hable soudiours of manhood approued and well tryed to his handes.

Truly he is rewarded accordyng to his desertes. For he hath taught Metellus to flygh and not to make oracions. Notyng the lightenesse and inconstauncie of Metellus.

               Plutarchus &amp; other historiographers doen write that Demosthenes had a poore woman to his mother and a woman vnknowen, his father kepte a cutlers shoppe and sould kniues, a good honeste manne and meetely welthie, as the whiche when he dyed leaft vnto his soonne honeste substaunce, but because Demosthenes was then but a litle childe, he &amp; his patrimonie

was cōmitted to certain executours or feoffers who beguiled Domosthenes so ferre, that thei neither regarded to sette hym to schoole, nor while he was at schoole to paie his schoolemaisters duetie.

Signifiyng, that vnto vnhoneste pleasure repentaunce is a prest compaignion to come after.Repentaunce euermore ensueth of vnhoneste pleasure.

made to the becke of the people, but at his owne wille &amp; pleasure at all tymes to dooe what thyng he had iudged expediente to bee dooen.
               A certain bonde maiden had receiued  of twoo menne of hir acquaintaunce a certain summe of money to kepe for theim, with this condiciō and agreemente, that she should redeliuer thesame summe vnto theim bothe together. The one of these twoo parties within a shorte space after, comyng cladde in a mournyng garmente, &amp; gooyng as though he had no ioye of his life, and feignyng that his partener was dedde, beguiled the woman, &amp; gotte the money out of hir fyngers.How Demosthenes by a suttle ingen saued a poore woman from paiyng one summe twys. This dooen, anon came the secounde partie vnlooked for, and begoonne to require that had been leafte in hir custodie. And wher ye woman beeyng in a pecke of troubles was half in mynde &amp; purpose to hang hirself, Demosthenes
                  
was so good vnto hir to become hir aduocate, who, as soone as he came to make his plea in hir behalf, went roundely to the demaū
                  der of the money after this sorte: This woman (saieth he) is readie well &amp; truely to discharge hirself of the money which she was putte in truste withal to kepe, but onles thou bryng thy partener too, she maye not dooe it, because that by thyne owne confession and woordes, this was a plain composiciō made betwen you, that the money should in no wyse bee deliuered to the one of you without the other. By this suttle ingen he saued the poore seelie woman, and clerely defeacted the conspirisie of the two vilaines, who had drieuē a drifte to receiue double paimente of one summe.
               To a certain ꝑsone demaūdyng  what was the principall poincte in eloquence, he made aunswer, hypocrisis,

                   ticleed to aid and succour Harpalus, and wer now alreadie vp towardes warre against Alexander, soodainly was seen Philoxenus arriued in the countree of Attica, whō

By the soonne he mened Alexander, in comparison of whom, this Philoxenus was scacely to bee estemed a cādle.
