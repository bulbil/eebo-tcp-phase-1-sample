            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               THe Papistes by long experience beeing learned, howe litle is gained to their part, by writing such Treatises, in which they tooke vpon them, either to iustifie their owne errours, or to condemne the truth of Gods Church, haue now of late taken an other course, and begun an other way of writing, which they haue thought more meete, both to couer the infirmitie of their cause, and to reteine such as they haue seduced in obstinacie of errour. For not abiding to proue, either that they are in the right, or wee in the wrong, they content them selues generally to inueigh, against Schisme and Heresie, &amp; to shew foorth the daunger of both, in which argument while they conteine them selues, they yeeld many good and substantiall reasons, as is not hard for them to do, which take a good cause in hande. But when they come to couple this argument of Schisme or Heresie, either by affirmation vnto vs, or by denial vnto them selues, (without which there can no conclusion be made, of the whole cause in controuersie) they bring nothing but a stale, vnlearned, and miserable beggerie, of the whole matter in question: namely that they are the Catholikes, &amp; we the Schismatikes, they are the Church, and wee the Heresie. Such is the whole drift of Gregorie Martinus vaine Treatise of Schisme, such is the scope of Hides seditious Epistle Consolatorie vnto Papistes, and the same is the policie of this blasphemous and traiterous discourse, cōteining the coulorable reasons made for the Papistes, that refuse to go to Church. The full and large aunswere vnto which infamous Libell, presumed to be dedicated euen to her most excellent Maiestie, with the confutation of the same Epistle Dedicatorie, because it requireth larger time, and is to be expected from a man of singular learning and diligence, assoone as it may bee done conueniently, I haue thought good in the meane time, briefly to set forth vnto the ignorant (for no man of meane knowledge can be deceiued by such petition of pri

This is suche a thing,

as it must needes bring comfort to al men, and can iustly greeue none, except the common enemy the Deuil him selfe. For as for

Their aduersaries also and persecutors, it can not in any reason mislike, for that the contrarie religion were to haue them as constant and faithful in that, if it were possible to win them to the same.
            But notwithstanding, seeing you wryte that there is both great dislike, and displeasure also taken of it, as though their constancie were obstinacy, and their conscience meere wil: (which most of al greeueth (as you write) their obedient and wel meaning mindes) albeeit otherwise the pressure it selfe bee so hea

               Secondly, what way or meanes they may vse to remedie or ease them selues of this affliction now layde vpon them for their consciences.
               Thirdly, if that way or meanes doe not preuayle, then howe they ought to beare and indure the same.
            
            
               BEfore the nyne reasons, is premised an answere to (a Letter (as is pretended) of a gentleman in England, touching the late imprisōmēt of Catholiks there: the cōtents wherof are these. First a great sorrow cōceiued in this answerer, for that pitifull descriptiō of Englād cōteined in the gentlemans letter, wherin was writtē, that so many great Gentlemen of worship were prisoned, for their consciences &amp; religion of late. What great imprisonment I pray

you hath béene of late, of so great Gentlemen, as hath not béene and continued many yeares before, except some intermission granted, to assay to winne by clemency, y• which was not atteined by punishment. But it is not hard to gesse, what marke you shoote at, that would haue conscience and religion, to bee the only cloake to couer whatsoeuer by secrete conspiracie against the state, hath beene of late attempted, by some of the Popish faction, whom you call Catholikes. Your treasonable practises, hauing not that successe you promised to your selues, and to your friendes in England and Irelande, you woulde nowe mooue connseration by persecution, for conscience, in them that deserue iustly to be suspected for conspiracie, yea and them also that are ma
                     •…
                  ifestly detected of trecherie. And howe I pray you is the state of England made miserable, that it deserueth your foolish of pitie, by imprisonmēt of these Gentlemen? You answere, So many good houses broken vp, so many young Gentlemen and seruantes vnprouided, so many poore people destitute, as though al housekéeping, maintenance of young Gentlemen and seruants, &amp; prouision of the poore people, depended vpon a fewe obstinate Recusants, who if they were all with God, yet none of these commodities should be wanting in y• realme. And while they remaine in the worlde, who forbiddeth them, although they be imprisoned, to kéepe good houses, mainteine seruants, relieue ye poore? It is wel knowne, how great a gaine they make of their imprisonment, &amp; how glad some of them are, whē they may haue the colour of restraint, but euen in their own houses, that they may pretende imprisonment, for not keeping of good houses, mainteining of seruants, &amp; relieuing of the poore. But let vs heare more of this lamē
                  table description. So many wiues disioyned from their husbands. But how many is there, or what one is there? or euer hath there béen in her maiesties raign, that being imprisoned for the only cause of religion, might not be suffred to haue his wife resort vnto him, yea, &amp; to remain with him if it were both their pleasures so to liue, and the wife to beare parte of her husbandes trouble. If not one can bée named, that can bée prooued (for Howlettes slaunder of Maister Dimmockes wyfe, hath béene openly confuted) there is no colour in the nexte complainte, Of so many children berefte of their parentes, whose Parentes are liuing, and at libertie to prouide for them, in all honest and duetifull manner.

As for the flying, running, dispersing, shutting vp &amp;c. It is so great as hardly can bée séene in any place worth the noting, and least able to make a pitifull description of the floorishing estate of Englande, which God of his mercy long continue, that enuy of all her aduersaries, may breake her bowels, with griefe to beholde it. But who can abide that slaunderous complaint of such pitifull abiding hunger, thirst, and colde in prison described by the supposed Gentleman? repeated by this reason maker to bee a miserie not accustomed to fall in our fathers dayes vpon that noble Realme, and all for different opinions in religion. You haue beene a great and long straunger from this noble realme, that haue not knowne in your own daies if you bee of any yeeres méete to make argumentes for all Catholikes, or in your Fathers dayes of what yeeres soeuer you be, that you haue not hearde of greater miserie, then hunger, thirste, and colde, in prison susteined, accustomed to be laid vpon Englishmen professours of the trueth, by Papists mainteiners of heresie, and all for difference of opinions in religion. But I woulde I might reason a little with y• gentleman describer (because you the reporter, haue deuised to colour a most destable s

But to say mine opinion, I think verily, that no gentleman in England, hath so vngentlemanlike conception, wtout al shew of truth, to auouch so lowd a lie. But rather y• this reason maker, faineth such a letter of description, whereof he himself is the authour, imagining by example of his owne faction, that the like tyrannie is practised in the Church of God, as is vsual to the crueltie of the Papists.

                  to bee ill that he doth, and yet doth thē, he goeth downe quick vnto hell.
                  
As though he would say: Albeit he be yet quicke vpon the earth, yet is he, in the prouidēce of God, dead &amp; damned in hel. And S. Paul talking of this sin, neuer laieth lesse punishment vpon it, then iudgement &amp; dānation, although it be committed in thinges of themselues indifferent or lawfull: for albeit (as he saith) meates offred to idoles be of themselues lawfull toRom. 14. 1.

And the reason is that which S. Paule hath immediatly following, saying. All that which is done by vs not according to our knowledge or conscience, is sinne. And S. Iames confirmeth the same, saying. He that knoweth good, and doth it not, sinneth. Wherefore S. Paule crieth out a a little before, thus. Blessed is hee that iudgeth not, or condemneth not himselfe, in doing contrary to that he best allowetb. And the cause whyMarke this reason.

                      Three kindes of Sinne. this sinne against a mans owne conscience is so damnable, is this. Some doe sinne of humane frailtie, as did Peter, and this is called a sinne against the father, who is called Power. Some doe sinne of ignorance, as did Paule,Math. 26. 1. Tim. 1. Vide D.

Some doe sinne of meere will and malice, choosing to sinne although they know it to be sinne, and this is the sinne against the holy Ghost to whom is appropriated particularly grace and goodnesse, the which a man most wickedly contemneth and reiecteth when he sinneth wilfully against his own conscience: and therefore Christ saith, that a man shalbe forgeuen a sinne agaynst the father and against the sonne, as we doe see it was in Peter andSinne agai

But why doe you oppose the Catholike Romayne Religion, to all other new doctrines? When by the Catholike Romayne religion, you meane the present Popishe religion, and not the auncient Romayne religion, which was the Catholike religion of all true Christians. I sée wel, as we must first of all suppose you to be a true Catholik, so wee must secondly suppose, the present Popishe Heresie, to be the auncient Romayne and vniuersall religion, of al the Catholike Church of Christ. These suppositions will doe you greate pleasure, to the ende (as you saye) that your reasons maye conuince.

                      many did in their censciences better like of Idolatre, then of Gods worship, and that the word of compulsion plainely declareth: for it appertaineth to them that are vnwilling, and not to them that are prompt and redy to obey.
                  But let vs weigh the cause, why you would not for so many thousand worldes, compell a Iew to swere to the blessed trinitie, you say, because hee should be damned for swearing agaynst his conscience, although the thing be neuer so true. And what if he sweare not, but continue still obstinate in his Iudaisme, shal he escape damnation? But if after he haue béene instructed in the faith of the holye trinitie, or haue had instruction offred him, and yet stil contēneth y• same, is not y• magistrate bound to compell him, eyther to acknowledge Christ, or to punish him for his obstinarie? By which punishment, if he be compelled to heare the doctrine, which before he dispysed, there is hope hée maye bée wonne to beléeue it, or if aster longe teaching he bée further vrged too confesse it, experience (as Augustine testifieth, of manye Donatistes) doeth shewe, that although hée did first professe it by compulsion, hée maye by Gods grace, woorking in him, afterwarde imbrace it willingly.
                  Wherefore the compulsion pretended to bee vsed, is neyther so daungerous to them that are compelled, nor so hurtefull to them that muste vse it, being the last refuge to bring vngodly persons to repentaunce, by threatning and executingof punishment, which contemne &amp; despyse all gentle and fatherly admonishment. Which, if it will not preuayle, but that of some, it is borne out with obstinacie, of other pretended by hypocricis, the Magistrate hath discharged his dutie, the offendor hath not founde damnation, which hée should haue

                  The first reason.
                  THe first reasō why a Papist may not go to church, is y• perril of infectiō: which is as good a reasō, as y• a fowle toad may not come into a cléere spring, to wash her, &amp; spewe out her venome, for feare of infection, not of the well (of which there is greater daunger) but of her owne body, vnto whose poysoned complexion, nothing almost may be added. Or that a man infected with the pestilence, pockes, or other contagious disease, may not come néere the place where phisicke and surgerie is ministred, least hee shoulde bée further infected. So that if a foole or a madde man, bée perswaded that the Phisition will kil him, by this mayne reason, hée must auoyde him. For what other force is in this argument, except trueth bée confessed to bée falshoode, and true phisicke daungerous infection? but marke the argument. Al daunger of infection is to bée auoyded: in going to Church and seruice, there is daunger of infection: therefore it is to bée auoyded. The first parte of this reason, our discourser prooueth by similitude, by authoritie of scripture, of Doctors, by examples, and by experience. Which was altogether néedelesse, excepte it were for young children, that learne to speake, for all men of meane capacitie, and smal discretion, will confesse, that all peryll of infection is to bée auoyded, of them that desire to lyue in health: but the proofe of the seconde parte of the argumente, which is, that in going to Churche and seruice, there is anye daunger of insection, hee bryngeth not one worde, beside his bare affyrmation. A worthye reason, to the hearing whereof the Prince, with her counsell, the learned, with the wise, of all England are called.
                  
                     Hée that coulde obteine a priuiledge thus to reason, that al which hée affirmeth must be taken for trueth, and that his aduersarie shal not bée admitted to denie any thing that hee saith, may easely proue to bée an 
                        •…
                     rrefragable Doctor. If this kinde of resoning had béen vsed among Papists only, which are professed to beléeue what soeuer you will teache them, it might haue gained you some credite, when it should haue had no controlling, but when you publish your arguments, that the Queene and her Counsell (which al denie your principles) and the wise and learned of this lande (of which the most part refuse your doctrine as heretical) may sée that your Clients refusall is vpon great reason, you declare that as in pride you lacke measure, so in iudgement you want discretion, in reasoning, you want learning, in defending, you want trueth in taking the cause in hande of obstinate contemners to iustifie it. you haue shewed neither wisdome, discretion, trueth nor honesty. But this seemeth strange that you cite out of Nicephorus lib. 3 cap. 30. That the Apostles and their schollers, were so wary and circumspect in this case (of auoidyng Heretikes) that they would not so much as once reason the matter with any of them, who indeuoured by their lying, or newe deuises to corrupt the trueth. Haue you set out your champion, to challendge the combate, and will you nowe giue ouer the battell? must you follow the example of the Apostles and their schollers, not so much as once to reason the matter with vs, whom you account for here
                        •…
                     kes? very well. The Diuell ought the Papistes a shame to make so proude an offer of disputation, which they neuer ment shoulde holde, as appeareth not onely by the present flight of the challenger, notwithstanding hée prosesteth that hée was prepared to suffer any torment, that shoulde bée laide on his body, for his constant confession, but also by the plaine attestation of this his associate, wherby it is euidently bewrayed, that suche bolde prouocation was nothing els but a traiterous and seditious deuice, to erect the peoples mindes in eexpctation, of some change in religion, while other diuilishe practises were in working in Irelande and the like attempted in England. But howesoeuer you bee affected towarde disputation, you slaunder the Apostles and their schollers, and Nicephorus the reporter of this sentence, and Irenaeus the authour of it, in saying they would

not so muche as once reason the matter with any heretike. For Saint. Paul whose doctrine and example, the other Apostles, and their schollers vsed and followed, alloweth vnto euery heretike two solemn admonitions at the least, before he be auoided, before which might be many reasonings, &amp; after also though not with any certaine hope to winne them, yet with certaine profite vnto

                     eightes of Heretikes laide open to their shame, and the plaine trueth of the Gospell haue the victorie, to the glory of God, So did the Apostles dispute against the obstinate Iewes, so did their schollers with Heretikes, as is manifest by the concertation of Augustine with the Donatistes, Manichees, and Arrians, and that often in hearing of the people, the recordes whereof are extant, as the disputation of Germanus and Lupus with the Pelagians testified by Beda in the first of his English historie. Neither doth Ireneus say, that the Apostles and their schollers, woulde not once reason the matter with any Heretikes, but shewing how Polycarpus the scholler of Saint Iohn, beeing saluted by Marcion the Heretike, who desired to bee acquainted with him, answered, that hee knewe him alreadie to bee the eldest childe of the Diuell: hee declareth, that ye Apostles and their schollers, were so circumspect, that they woulde not communicate in any worde or familiar spéech with any, that had corrupted the sinceritie of the Gospell, with lying and false deuises. And this circumspection Polycarpus
                     
                        Irene. lib. 3. Cap. 3. learned indeede of Saint Iohn, who saith in his second Epistle, That if any man come vnto you and bring not this doctrine, receiue him not into your house, nor salute you him, for hee that saluteth him is partaker of his wicked workes.
                  Finally, where you say, that out of the first sect of Luther dyd spring Lutherans and Zwinglians, Caluinistes, Puritanes, Anabaptistes Trinitaries, Familie of loue, Adamites and suche like, you bewray not onely your malice, but also your ignorance. For besides that out of the doctrine of Luther so farre as it was consonant too the worde of GOD, no heresie coulde spring, more then out of the worde of God it selfe: the Anabaptistes

and Familie of loue, are olde sectes springing out of the Enthusiastes, Pelagians, Donatistes, Valentinians, and other auncient heresies, The Trinitaries are a broode of the Arrians, Nestorians, Macedonians, and suche like Monsters. The Adamites, were both sprong vp and suppressed by the refourmed Churches of the Bohemians and Morauians, manye yeeres before Luther was borne. The rest whom you name, when you can conuince them of heresie, by the authoritie of the holy Scriptures, you may referre their beginning to what head you please. In the meane time, you must learne to reason better, against your aduersaries, then by challenging the whole cause, without tryall or proofe, otherwise your victorie shalbe as glorious, as your argumentes bee forcible, méete to bée answered with hoopes and hisses of Sophisters, not worthie the hearing of suche as bee wise, and learned in Englande, muche lesse too bée regarded of her moste excellente Maiestie, and the honourable Lordes of her pri

                      mentioned, more forewarned, more forbidden, more detested, more threatned in the Scripture, then any sinne els mentioned in the same, except it bee Idolatrie. But in the new Testament nothing so much exaggerated, or with such vehement speeches prohibited: Christe signifiyng, that the most part of the worlde were to be damned for this sin, when he cryeth out with that cōpassionable voice of his, saying. Wo be to the world by reason of scandales. Wherefore pronoucing as pitifull a sentence, vpon the authour of these scandales he saith. Woe bee to that man by whome come these scandales. And deuising with himselfe (as it were) how to expresse vnto our capacities, the intollerablegreatnes of this mans torment in Hell, for scandalizing of other men: he vttereth it in this sort.

                     It were better for that man that a milstone were hanged about his
                     Mark. 9.

As if a man shoulde induce another by his example, or otherwise, to commit adulterie, to take an oth against his conscience, or the like: and as Ieroboam did by his example, make the tenne tribes forsake the vnitie of the Church of Ierusalem, which sinne of his, is so much noted in the scripture, with this title of scandale, (For that he

this were euill which the Donatist saieth, the other woulde reproue him. But if saint Ambrose had seene the Emperour to haue gone to the Panims Temples, or S. Augustine the other to frequent the Donatistes Churches, what then would they haue saide? What excuse then would they haue receiued? and this is our verie case.
               
               
                  The second reason.
                  
                     THe second reason (saith hée) why a Catholike can not yeeld to go to church, is because he cānot go without scandale, which is a sin more mentioned, more forwarned, more forbidden, more detested, more threatened in the scripture, then any sinne els mentioned in the same, except it be Idolatrie. I will not stande to examine the comparison, but certaine it is, that the wilfull giuing of offence, or as hée calleth it newly, scandale, is in scripture often and greatly detested, and verie damnable and abhominable, a thing well knowne to them, that are wise and learned in the scriptures, and therefore néeded not the one quarter of quotations and textes, that are cited for it. There are also diuers kindes therof, and neuer a good of them all. Whether it be by inducing other men to sinne, by false doctrine, or wicked example, by offending the weake conscience of our brethrē in a thing of it selfe lawful, which our reasoner setteth downe absolutely, without regarde of such circumstances. If I doe offende an other mans conscience in a thing of it selfe lawfull. As though our sauiourMat. 15. 5. 12. Christ might be accused for neglecting the offence of the obstinate Pharisees. Or whether it be by giuing occasion to the enemy to blaspheme, when a man doeth wickedly, which also our Aduocate of the Recusantes doeth set downe so nakedly, that he woulde make a Christian man afraid to glorifie Christ before a Iew, whō both hée is sure to offend, and that hée will take occasion, either in heart or mouth, to blaspheme our Sauiour. The third point (saith hée) is in respect of the enemie, that is, when although I doe not induce any man to sinne or offende any mans conscience, yet I doe disedisie the enemy, and doe that thing whereby the enemy is scandalised, and taketh an occasion to blaspheme God, his trueth, his lawe, or the like. For except the thing, which I doe is wicked, as the adultery of Dauid, which hée bringeth for an example, though the enemy is scandalized, as the Pharisées were at Christ, and taketh an occasion to

                        〈◊〉
                      al y• proofe. A Catholike (saith he) by going to Church, seruice, or prayers of them of the contrarie religion, can not but commit this great Scandale in the highest degree, that is in all those three pointes, before rehearsed. This is boldly saide, but what is the reason to shewe, that it is truely saide. Touching the first pointe (saieth hee) If he bee a man of any calling, his example shal induce some other as wife, &amp;c. This is as good Logike, as the necessarie supposition, to pr
                        •…
                     us an vniuersall proposition, by a particular. Euerie Catholike giueth offence, because some that is of any calling, induceth by his example. So that hée which is a méere priuate man, whose example can not induce, or authoritie constraine, is exempt from this point of giuing offence. But why shoulde any man, of what estate so euer hée is, bée charged with offence giuing: when the thing which hée doeth is not disprooued, but by a vayne supposition, to be godly and honest.
                  And touching the seconde pointe, when it is not a thing indifferent, but either a necessarie duetie, as wée iudge, or a thing altogether vnlawfull, as hée holdeth, to come to the Churche, howe can any man bée saide touching that pointe, to commit offence, which is contrary to his owne determination, of that point. But by a marginall note, hée commaundeth vs to marke the third pointe, and that is this. There is no enemy of the Catholike religion in the worlde, whether hee bee Gentile, Iewe, Turke, or heretike, but that hee must both thinke and speake, the woorse of the saide religion, seeing the professours of the same, are content for worldly pollicy to dissemble it: and leauing their owne Churches, to present them selues to the Churches of their open and professed enemies.
                  
                  This man reasoneth altogether of necessities, and impossibilities, the strongest Cheynes that are to holde any reasons, if they were surely linked &amp; riueted, into the causes, that hée would binde with them. But howe prooueth hée, that it is necessarie for euerie enemie of the Catholike religion in the worlde to thinke woorse of it, for the dissembling of some of the professours of the

same? The worlde is wyde, and the true Catholike religion, hath many enemies, that are wise, which when they knowe, that euery religion, and their owne, what euer it bée, hath many dissemblers, when it is persecuted, will not for the onely pointe of dissembling, thinke woorse of the Catholike religion, then they thinke of their owne, for the same cause.

                  The third Reason
                  THe thirde reason why a Catholike may not come to churche, is,

So that a catholike by going thether, doeth directly denye his religion.

As for example, In Italy a Iewe may bee knowne, First, by his woordes, if hee woulde professe him selfe to bee of that religion. Secondly, by woorkes proper to Iudaysme, as by keeping the Saterday, holy day, by circumcysing his children, and the like.

Nowe, as these three, are wayes to professe this religion, so if a man of an other religion, (for example) a Christian, should yeeld to vse any of these thinges, hee should sinne greeuously, and in effect deny his fayth. And as for the first, if hee shoulde professe him selfe to bee a Iewe, it is euident that he denieth thereby his Christianitie. And as for the other two waies, it cannot be denied: for the circum

                      offered him selfe rather to suffer death, then to weare one of them: as appeareth in the same booke of Tertullian. But now, much more is the thing vnlawfull in our case. For that the going to the Protestantes churches (which is a catholike must presume to be heretical) was neuer a thing of it selfe lawful, (as I wil hereafter proue) which the wearing of a garland was: and therfore much lesse now to be tollerated, seeing besides this, it is also made a signe distinctiue, as I haue alreadie prooued.
               
               
                  The third reason.
                  THe third reason is not vnlike his brethren, that went before, which all holde of a necessarie supposition, or els they inforce no necessarie conclusion. This third reason is for that going or not going to the Church is made a signe, nowe in Englande, and a distinctiue note betwixt religion and religion, betwixt a Catholicke and a schismatike, as the wearing of a yellow Cappe, is the marke of a Iewe in Italy. I yéeld it is so, and therfore going to Church, is the externall note of a Catholike, &amp; not going to Church, is the marke of a Schismatike &amp; Heretike. But what go I about to breake, the adamantine necessitie of the former supposition? Then let it stand, and sée howe it is fastened to the cause, in controuersie.
                  
                     That the going to Church is the playne and apparant signe of a Schismatike, that is to say, of a conformable man (as they call him) to the Protestantes proceedinges, it is manifestly to bee prooued. In déede it is necessarie to bée prooued, if you will haue the argument, of auoiding the distinct marke of Schismatikes, to agrée with Protestantes. Howe then doe you proue it? First by the commandement and exaction of the same, for going to Church.

In déed this proueth the meaning of the cōmanders to be, y• they woulde haue all true Christians, whō you call the Protestants to bée discerned from heretikes and schismatikes by this marke. But that all Protestants are heereby proued to bée schismatikes, it is as farre of as euer it was, and as néere as euer it shalbe. But the reason of exaction, mightily doeth prooue it. For when a Catholike doeth come before the Commissioners, there is nothing asked of him, but when hee was at Churche, and if hee will promise to goe to Churche, commonly they account him a sufficient conformable man, (that is to haue yeelded sufficiently vnto them) It were (I gesse) hard to proue, that euery Papist which commeth before the Commissioners, is examined of that one Article of comming to Churche. And if it were graunted, that to bée one question which is asked of him when hee was at Churche? yet that nothing els is asked of any that commeth before them, I thinke there is no man will beléeue you, though you woulde swere it. And if some of whose conformitie there is hope, by promising to goe to the Churche. where they may bée instructed, are for a season vrged no further: yet that they are commonly accounted to bée conformable men, and thought to haue yéelded sufficiently vntoo the Commissioners: I dare say, neither the Commissioners who best know their owne thoughts wil acknowledge so much: and their contrary practise, is often séene in many, and you your selfe complaine of it, that they exact of many to communicate, &amp; to take the oth, whiche is more then onely going to Churche. But the long imprisonment of many, doeth make this absteining from the Church to bée a proper and peculiar signe of a true Catholike. No verily: but of an obstinate herctike. For not y• imprisonment, but the cause for which they suffer, must argue them to bée true Catholikes, whiche cause séeing it is lefte without defence or proofe, sau

                      only a poore, naked and beggerly supposition to stande vpon, it followeth not that going to Churche is the note of a Schismatike, but not going to Churche rather argueth a Schistike or an Heretike.
               
               
                  The fourth Reason.

Churche, the which howe perrillous and dreadsul a thing it is, all catholikes doe sufficiently knowe. For as they firmely beleeue, that to oppugneVide Aug. tom. de Fi. &amp; simb. ca. 10. the visible knowne Churche of Christe (as all Heretikes tontinually doe) is a verie wicked and damnable sinne: Euen so in like manner they beleeue that to breake the vnitie of the same Churche, and to make any rent or disuion in the same (whiche is the proper faulte of schismatikes,) is also damnable. For the whiche cause Saint Paule doeth so diligently request the Corinthians too auoide Schismes, saying. ( beseeche

So that suche an action as I haue talked of (for example, goingActions extor ted by feare are simplie free actions, &amp; only violent in part. to the churche for the auoiding of temporall losse) is called both the Philosophers and Diuines. Inuoluntaria secundum quid, simpliciter autem voluntaria. That is: in part or in some respect, vnuoluntarie. But absolutely, and simplie it is to bee accounted voluntarie. And therefore, they are to bee esteemed good or bad, punishable or rewardable, euen as other free actions are: for otherwise, no sinne shoulde bee punishable. Seeing euery naughtie action commonly hath some kindMarke "these absurdities. of compulsion in it, but yet it may not bee excused thereby. As for example, the murtherer may say that hee did it not willingly, for that hee was compelled thereunto by rage of anger. And the Lecherer may say, his fleshe compelled him to sinne: and to take fitter example for our purpose: all those that denied Christe in time of persecution for feare of tormentes, mighte by your obiection, say that they did it not willingly but by compulsion of torments, and therefore were not to bee damned for it. But yet Christe saide, that hee woulde take it as doone voluntarily, and therefore damne them for it, by deniyng them openly before his Father, and his Angelles, at the day of iudgement.Mat. 10. Luc. 12. lo. 12. And yet to giue an other example neerer to oure matter: Sainte Iohn saieth of the noble men and Gentlemen of Iurie in his time. Many of the principall men did beleeue in Christe, but they did not confesse him outwardly for feare of the Pharisees least they shoulde bee caste out of the Sinagogue, for they did loue more the glory of men then the glory of God.
                  
                  Heere wee see the act of these noble men and Gentlemen: also the compulsion to the act, the cause of their compulsion, &amp; lastly Saint Iohns iudgement vpon the act. The act wherof they are accused is only holding their peace, &amp; not confessing Christ openly, according as they did inward ly beleeue of him: The cause or excuse that they had to lay for themselues,

was the feare of the Pharises or Magistrates which cōpelled them agaynst their will so to doe. Now, what punishement they feared at the PharisesVVhat a great matter it is amongst the

For he looseth therby al offices, dignities, and credit whatsoeuer: no man maye buye or sell with him: noe man may visit him, or talke with him, or salute him in the streates.

                  Besides this, to proue it schisme, yea and that obstinate and rebellyous schisme, it were sufficiente to knowe that the meaning, wil, and commaundement, of the generall and vniuersall Catholyke Churche at this daye, is, that catholyke men shoulde not presente them selues to Protestantes churches, or conuenticles, seeing they are denounced open enemies to the aforsayd church, and their relygion hath beene as orderly condēned in the lastgeneral counsell of Trent, As the doctrine of Arrius was, in the first generall counsell of Nyce.

Neyther did Gregorie, when hée sent Augustine into Englande, to plant the fayth and religion that was at Rome, thinke it expedientBede. lib. 1. cap. 27. to bynde the Saxons to the forme of Ceremonies and seruice, vsed in the Church Romayne, but willed him to choose out of euery Churche what hée thought conuenient, for the newe Church of the English Saxons.
                  
                  But procéeding to shewe how grieuous the sinne of Schisme isDe vnit. eccl. cap. 4. out of Augustine, our reasoner putteth vs in minde, what Augustine meaneth by cōmunicating with the vnitie of the Churche, in these woords, That their Communion bée with the whole body of Christes Church dispersed ouer the whole world, and not with any one parte separate, or els it is manifest, that they are not (saith he) in the Catholike Churche. Uerely, these wordes of Saint Augustine, with many other that he hath to the same effect against the Donatistes, doe cleere vs of Schisme, who willingly communicate with all the whole bodie of Christes Church dispersed ouer the worlde, and charge the Popishe faction bothe of Schisme and heresie: Of Schisme, because they mainteine the Church to be onely in a part of Europa. As the Donatists did in Asia, which heresie▪ because they differ not onely in the bodie of Christ, which is his Church, as theEphe. 5. &amp;c. Donatistes did, but also in the head thereof, which is none but Christ borne, suffered, risen agayne, and ascended in heauen, that he might be the onely head Sauiour, Redéemer, of his spouse and Aduocate of his Church with GOD his Father. But now that this acte of goyng to the Protestantes Churches and prayers is a Schismatical
                     
                     act and such a one as deuideth from the vnitie of the churche, it is easie (saith hee) to bee prooued. If you haue suche facilitie in prouing, I trust you will no more charge vs with your necessary suppositions. Then let vs see what you say. Schisme according to Sainte Augustine, is a separation of them that thinke the same thing. That is aLib. 2. cont. Creson. ca. 3. different kynde of seruice of GOD in those menne that doe not differ in opinion of religion. Once agayne a little more Logicke woulde doe you good, too teache you too expounde thinges vttered generally by spéeche as generall, and not as you dee heare by particular: For Augustines generall terme of separation, you restreine to a different kinde of seruice of GOD, as though there mighte not bee scisme, where there is one, and the same kinde of seruice of GOD acknowledged. But let vs see the difference also that Augustine maketh betwixt an here
                        •…
                     ike and a scismatike, Scismatikes are made, not by differing in fayth or beliefe, but by the breaking of the societie or vnitie of the communion. Hitherto we dissent not in the matter for wee allowe both the discription and the difference, being vnderstoode according to Augustines meaning, which euery wise and good man, will think to be such, that the crime of scisme and name of Scismatiks,Aug. quest. 11. in Mat. must be appropried not to euery one that departeth from any sect but to them onely, which departe from the Church of the liuing GOD. Howe then doeth our discourser prooue, that we are not in the Communion of the Churche of God? The communion or vnity of the churche (sayth hée) consisteth in these three things, To wit that all Christians haue one Sacrifice, one &amp; the selfe same Sacramēts also one &amp; the selfe same seruice of God.

As for our seruice when he bringeth any argumentes (as hee promiseth) to prooue that it hath no part of the Catholike seruice, hee shall receiue his answere and our defence accordingly. Hitherto therfore, although with many whot woordes, he hath concluded nothing against vs, at length he commeth to answere an obiection of colde Catholikes, as hee calleth them, whiche are, that they goe not too the Churche willingly, but by constraynt of the Publike Lawes of the Realme.
                  And héere out of Aristotles Ethickes Lib. 3. The Acte of goyng to Churche, is prooued voluntarye because the constraynt is conditionall, eyther to doe that is commaunded, or too beare that punishment that the Lawe appoynteth. Where is then the sore charge agaynst them, that compell men against theyr

                     But beside this to proue it schisme, yea and that obstinate and rebellious Schisme it were sufficient to knowe that the meaning, will and commaundement of the generall and vniuersall catholike churche at this day, is, that catholike men shoulde not present themselues at Protestants churches. UUhy Sir, is not the Pope by your reede the best Interpreter of the Catholike Churches meaning? And hath not hee graunted diuers dispensations, for Papistes to presente themselues in Protestantes Churches? But they haue beene denounced open enimies (say you) by the Councell of Trent, as the doctrine of Arius was condemned in in the firste generall Councel of Nice. Nay rather as the Homousians were in ye Councel of Ariminium, &amp; in many other Councels of the East. And as the doctrine of the Catholikes, was in the seconde of Ephesus, Nice the seconde, and many other blasphemous and heretical coūcels: I passe ouer your slaunder of the Nobility of Englande, by certaine of which, you affirme, that the heretical and schismaticall cōuenticle of Trent, was moued, whether they might not lawfully without offence go to Church, to do some meere temporal Acte, as to beare ye swoord before her Maiesty, &amp;c. Except you meane of such of the Nobility, as haue openly declared their disloyalty, by entring into rebellion or otherwise.
                  But as touching ye forbidding to goe to heretical churches, which you labour so vehemently to proue, yt you father it vpon a Cannon of the Apostles themselues, which must needs be obserued. Can. 63 You should haue done more wisely, to haue confirmed it, by theyr Canonicall writinges, rather then by those Apocriphall Canons, which if we should receiue thē as authentical, wil prooue euē your popish churches to be hereticall, &amp; your selues to bee Heretikes, because you goe against many thinges decreed in those Canons.

The example also of the people of Rome, whiche refused to communicate with Felix might haue heene spared, but that vnder colour of certaine wordes of Theodoret, you would haue it seem▪ as though not one of the Inhabitants of Rome, was infected with Aurianisme. UUheras ye matter is other wise, seeing that Felix, although himselfe of the Catholike religion, was chosen bishop by the more part of the Clergie, and people of Rome, which were of the faction of the Arrians. And therfore where Theodoret saith, that none of the Inhabitants of Rome would enter into the church so long as Felix was within, it must of necessitie be vnderstood, of the Catholike Inhabitantes. For that there was neuer an Arrian dwelling at Rome, at such time as Constantius came thither, I thinke no man but lightely acquaynted with the hystory of that time, that can bee perswaded.

For the which cause, they note that the new Testamente byddeth vs not to beware of Iewes and Gentiles, but of Heretickes in manye places. The reason is, for that they are those wolues, which Christ foretolde vs should come in sheepe skins: which as S.

Protestants churches is, because the seruice which they vse, is nought and dishonourable to God, and therfore, no man can come to it, or heare it, or seeme to alow of it by his presence, without great offence to God. Neither is it sufficient to say (as cōmonly they vse to say to beguile simple people withall) that it is the Scripture, taken out of the Gospels, Epistles, Psalmes, and the like. For by that argument, the Iewes seruice were good at this day, which is taken out of the olde Testament: and al Heretikes seruice that euer was, seemed to be nothing but Scriptures. For, asAug. to. 6. cont. Max. li. 1. initio. &amp; iter. vers. fi. S.

                         from the rest. to say, that it is deuised of them selues, and altogether different frō al the seruice of christendome besides: and therfore not to be receiued by catholikes, with whom they deale too childishly, when they say, their seruice differeth in nothing from the old catholikes seruice, but only because it is in English: thereby thinking to make the simple people, to haue the lesse scruple to come to it. The which how false it is, it shal appeare by2 Condemned by the Puritaines. that which I wil say hereafter. I might also bring the opinion of al the hotter sort of Protestants, called the Puritaines, who in writing, sermons, and priuate speech, doe vtterly condemne, the seruice which now Protestants haue, and therevpon doe refraine from it, as much as catholikes. But I wil giue more particular reasons, as foloweth.
                  First the scripture is read there in false &amp; shamelesse translations, conteining3. Fal
                           •…
                        e translations of scripture. manifest and wilful corruptions, to drawe it to their owne purposes, as hath bin shewed in particular, by many learned men in their works: and is like to be (shortly) more plainly by the grace of God. As for example, throughout the scripture, where Idoles are forbidden, they translate1 Ioh. 5.
                      it Images, as in Saint Iohn they reade. Children keepe your selues from Images.
                  
                  Whereas the Scripture sayeth Idoles: and this is, to make simple men beleeue, that Idoles &amp; Images are al one, which is absurd. For then, where Moses sayeth: That God made man according to his owne Image. WeeGen. 1. 3. should consequently say: God made man according to his owne Idole. Againe, where in contrarie maner S. Paule sayeth. That a couetous man

                     maketh his money his Idole. We should say, that he maketh it, his image. The which howe foolish it is, euery man seeth, and it can not stande with any sence of the Scripture. The like absurde translations they haue, in infinite other thinges, which I cannot stand to rehearse. Let some man reade

the latter ende of the xii. Chapter of the second booke of the Machabies, where he shal see what labour their English translator taketh to shift ouer the words of the scripture, which talk of oblatiōs &amp; prayers for the dead:2. Macha 12. and by that one place, let euerie man iudge of his fidelitie in the rest. ForSee the English Bible dedicated to King

                        . I am sure, that if a Boye shoulde so corrupt Tullies Epistles, in translating them in a Grammer Schoole, he should be breeched for his labour. The scripture therefore, being read there, in false translations, it must needes seeme to be false, which is blasphemie against the holy Ghost the inditer of them. So that by this, it appeareth, that, that part of their seruice which they pretend to be scripture, is no scripture, because it is by the malice of the interpretor false, the which scripture can not be.4.

                  Secondly, the seruice that Christians ought only to goe to, shoulde beIg. ad Hier. Chri. li. 3. &amp; 6. de. Sacer. &amp; hom. 60. Hier. ep. ad Helio. &amp; ep. 85. ad Eua.

Paul when he saith. That no man may take vnto him this honour, but he that is called as Aaron was. Wherefore the same Paul aduiseth the Bishop Timothie, not to giue this dignitie vnto any man but vpon great consideration, saying. Do not lay thy hands rashly vpon any man. But now that either al, or the most part of Ministers of England, be meere laye men, &amp; no Priestes, and consequently haue no authoritie in these thinges, it is euident for many causes: as wel for that they haue not receiued the vnder Orders, which they should haue done before Priesthood, (as appeareth by the auncient Councel of Carthage, wherin S. Augusten was himself,) &amp; by al the Fathers both before &amp; since: as also because they are not ordained by such a Bishop &amp; Priest, as the catholike church hath put in that authoritie: which admitteth no man for Bishop, which is not ordeined by imposition of three or twoo catholike Bishops handes at the least. Of al which thinges none are to be founde amongest the Protestantes.
                  Thirdly, their seruice is nought, because they haue diuers false, and blasphemous thinges therein: and that which is yet worse, they so place those thinges, as they may seeme to the simple, to be verie scripture. As for5. Fals

                  Fourthly, albeit the Protestantes seruice had not all this euil in it, as it hath: yet were it nought, because it hath not in it, those good things which Christian seruice should haue. For seruice may bee euil, as well for hauing too litle, as for hauing too much. As the seruice of the Arrians was, for singing, Glorie to the Father, and not singing the same to the Sonne: And as if a man should recyte his Creede, and leaue out one article (as in effect the Protestants doe the article of discention into hell) all the whole Creede were nought thereby. Nowe, howe many thinges doe want in the Protestantes seruice, which should be in Christian seruice, it were too long in euerie point to rehearse: yet will I (for examples sake) name two or three thinges. First therefore, they haue left out the chiefest, and highest thinges of all: which is the blessed Sacrifice of Christ his Bodie and Blood appointed by Christ, to bee offered vp euerie day for thankes giuing to God, for obteyning of grace, and auoyding of all euil, and for the remission of sinnes both o

                      quicke and dead: as with one consent the Fathers of the Primatiue Church doe affirme. The which sacrifice beeing away, no Christian seruice can bee saide to be there: For so much as, for this cause were ordeined Priests, neither can there any be called Priest but in respect of this sacrifice: also in respect of this sacrifice were christian churches called Temples, for this sacrifice were made Aulters: for an Aulter is the place of sacrifice, euen as an armorie is the place where armour is. For this sacrifice was Priestes apparell made.

                  The seconde thing, which the Protestantes seruice leaueth out, is, no lesse then sixe, of the seuen sacramentes, which the catholike seruice of God doeth vse: (for as for their communion it can bee no sacrament

as they doe vse it.) The commoditie of which Sacraments, in the church saint Augustine saieth. That it is greater, then can bee expressed, and therefore the contempt of them is no lesse then sacriledge, because (saith hee) that, can not be contemned without impietie, without the helpe of

The third thing that the Protestants seruice leaueth out, is, all the ceremonies of the catholike church, of the which the olde auncient Fathers and Councels doe say these three thinges. First, that that they are to bee had in great reuerence, and to bee contemned of no man. Secondly, that they are to bee learned by tradition, and that many of them are receiued by the tradition of the Apostles. Lastly, that they which doe either condemne, despise, or wilfully omyt these ceremonies, are excommunicated. I might heere adde many other thinges, as leauing out prayers for the dead, beeing (as the Fathers holde) one of the chiefest functions of a Priest. Also for hauing their seruice in an other order and language then the vniuersall church vseth: But this is sufficient. For if they leaue out of their seruice, both Sacrifice, Sacraments, and all Ecclesiasticall ceremonies: I knowe not what good thing they haue left, besides a fewe bare wordes of scripture, euil translated, and woorse applyed, which they read there. Seeing therefore their seruice is such, it is a sufficient cause to make all catholikes to auoide it.

                  HE telleth vs, that the seuenth reason, why a catholike may not yeelde to come to the Protestantes churches is, because the seruice which they vse is nought, and dishonourable to God: and therfore no man can come to it, or heare it, or seeme to allowe of it, by his presence, without great offence to God. Wee heare that it is nought and dishonourable to God. But let vs heare the cause, why it is so tearmed. First, it is not sufficient (he saith) to defend it, y• it is takē out of the scripture, the Gospels, Epistles, Psalmes, and such like: 
                        •…

(a sufficient witnesse of so weightie a matter) saying, That the Sacramentaries doe in vaine beleeue in God the Father, in God the Sonne, in the holie Ghost, and in Christ our Sauiour: al this doth auaile them nothing, seeing they doe denie this one article, as false, of the real presence, whereas Christ doeth say this is my bodie. Suppose that Cope citeth this saying truely, out of Luther, and that those whom hée calleth Sacramentaries, did deny this one article of the reall presence, according to the meaning of Christes wordes. This is my bodie, as false, as though Christe were a lyar: It were true, that all other articles of fayth, could not profite them vnto saluation: But what woorde is héere to shewe Luthers opinion of the Protestantes seruice, whiche might bee good, although they were nought which vsed it.
                  But wheras he hath gone hetherto, vpon méere suppositions, nowe wée shall haue his assumption confirmed by weight of argumentes, and authorities. First therefore, to shew that the Protestants seruice is euil, he saieth, it were sufficient to say. That it is deuised of themselues &amp; altogether different from al the seruice of Christendom. Cōcerning the matter it was confessed before, that it is taken out of the scriptures, the Gospels, Epistles &amp; Psalmes, &amp; therfore not deuised by vs. Touching ye forme and ceremony thereof, it hath alwaies bin frée, &amp; lawful for euery particular Church, to deuise whatsoeuer is most méete for edification, order, &amp; cumlinesse, as I haue shewed before, euen out of the authoritie of Gregory Bishop of Rome, &amp; therefore may be different from the forme and ceremonies of all other churches in Christendom, so the substance of doctrine &amp; Sacraments be the same. I wil set down his wordes:

                     The interogation of Augustine. Cum vna sit fides, &amp;c.
                      
                     
                        when thereBed. lib. 1▪ cap 27. is but one faith, why are there diuers customs of the Churches, &amp; one custom of Masses (so they called the celebration of the Lords Supper) in the holy Roman Church, &amp; an other in the Church of Fraunce? Gregorie the Pope answereth, (euery Bishop was called Pope in his time). Your brotherhood knoweth the custom of the Church of Rome, in which you remember that you haue beene brought vp. But it pleaseth me, that whether in the Churche of Rome, or of Fraunce, or of any other churche, you haue found any other thing, which may more please Almightie GOD, you choose it forth carefully, and in the church of Englishmen, which yet is new, vnto the faith, you plant by principal institution, those thinges whiche you coulde gather out of many churches. For thinges are not to bee loued for the places sake, but the places for good thinges sake, Wherefore choose you out of euery churche, such thinges as are godly, as are religious, as are right: and these things being gathered as it were into a bundell, lay them downe for a custome, in the mindes of the English men.
                     
                  
                  As for the childish saying of them, which tel you that our seruice differeth but in language from yours, we mislike asmuche as you The second reason is, that you affirme the hotter sort of Protestants called the Puritanes, in writing, sermons, and priuate speeche, vtterly to condemne the seruice which now protestants haue, and thereupon do refraine from it as much as Catholikes. That any of the hottest protestants, although they woulde wishe some things therein, to bée other wise, doe vtterly condemne the seruice, and refraine from it, as much as Papistes, it is altogether vntrue, in them that are wise and learned. If a fewe, froward, schismaticall fooles, doe refrain from it, there is smal reason why it should be iudged naught, except you would preferre their iudgement before al y• bée wise &amp; learned of the protestantes in England. Which as with no equitie you can doe, so the cause which they pretende of their condemning being for comming ouer neere to your seruice, there is no reason why you shoulde flée to their opinion, that it is naught, except you will acknowledge that your owne is farre worse. But you promise to giue more particuler reasons in that whiche foloweth. The first reason particuler, &amp; the third generall, is false interpretation of Scripture, whiche you say is read there in

                        And after hee had made preparations, by a collection of euery man vnto two thousand drachmes of siluer, hee sent vnto Ierusalem, to bring a sacrifice for sinne, doing very well and ciuilly, in thinking of the resurrection. For if hee had not weighed, that they which before were falne shoulde rise againe, it had been a superfluous and trifling matter, to pray for the dead. Then considering that to them that are falne a sleepe, with godlinesse, there is laide vp a most goodly free rewarde, holy and godly is the consideration, when hee made expiation for the dead to be loosed from that sinne
                      Now let vs sée, what the Englishe Bible dedicated to king Henry differeth from this. 
                        So hee gathered of euery one a certaine, insomuch that hee brought together 2000. drachmes of siluer, whiche hee sent vnto Ierusalem that there might a sacrifice bee offered for the misdeede, In the which place hee did wel and right, for he had consideration and pondering of the life that is after this time, for if hee had not thought that they which were slaine, did yet liue, it had beene superfluous and vaine to make any vowe or sacrifice for them that were dead. But forsomuche as hee sawe, that they whiche die in the fauour and beleefe of God, are in good rest and ioy he thought it to be good and honorable for a reconciling to doe the same for those, which were slaine that the offence might bee forgiuen
                      The difference as euery indifferent man may sée is in woordes, and not in matter, but it séemeth, that our proude Censor hath not viewed any, but the vulgar Latine translation, whiche differeth muche more from the Gréeke, then the later of the Englishe Bible. The Englishe of whiche vulgar Latine, as well as I can translat it is thus. 
                        And a collection being made, he sent twelue thousande drachmes of siluer to Ierusalem that a sacrifice might bee offered for the sinnes of the dead, thinking wel and religiously of the resurrection. For except hee had hoped that they which were fallen, shoulde rise againe, it might seeme superfluous and vaine to pray for the dead. And because hee considered that they which with godlines had receiued sleeping▪

                     Holye therefore and wholesome is the cogitation, to entreate for the departed, that they may be loosed from sinnes.
                  
                  Although this translation séeme more pregnante and full, for prayers and sacrifices to the dead, yet is the same also contayned in the former translations: wherfore here is no wilful corruption, or false translation proued, but the translation is more agréeabl

                  The seconde particular cause, and the fourth reason is, for that the seruice and sacramentes, which shoulde bée sayde and administred onelye by Priestes, are sayde and ministred onelye by laye men. For nowe all, or the most parte of the Ministers in Englande, are meere lay men. That the Sacramentes and publicke prayers should be said and ministred by Ministers lawefully ordayned, it is a thing out of question with vs, sauing that the Papists doe allowe baptisme in case of necessitie by a laye man. But howe is it proued, that our Ministers are all, or the most parte méere laye men? By two argumentes brought forsoothe, though he speake of many causes.

to kindle the lightes of the church. Also let him receaue a little cruse emptye, to giue wine for the Euchariste of the blood of Christe Although this Canon, with a many of the rest, bee not of such antiquitie as the councell of Carthage the fourth, where S. Augustine was present, séeing in diuers olde copies, they haue not the title of the Carthage councell, but generally: Statua Ecclesiae antiqua, Auncient statutes of the Church: yet you sée playnelye, that héere is neuer a word to shewe, that those vnder orders, eyther were or ought to bée necesiarily receaued, of euerye one, that shalbe preferred to the order of Priesthoode. Nowe let vs sée the other Canon of Laodicea 
                        
                           Quid non oporteat sacro ministerio deditos, &amp;c. That they which are dedicated to the holy ministerie, from the Priestes vnto the Deacons, and the rest of the Ecclesiasticall order, that is vnto the Subdeacons, Readers, Singers, Exorcistes, and dorekeepers, nor any of the number of Contayners, and Monkes, ought not to come in anye tauerns, or common tipling houses

                     blye trowe you, that no man ought to bée made Priest, excepte hée haue receaued these vnder orders? It followeth, I thinke by any logique, that wheresoeuer these Officers are named, there it is meant that they were all receaued, by euerye one that was aduaunced to the order of Priesthoode. Naye, the contrary is easie to bée gathered, out of the hystories, that manye were ordaynedChrisost. de sacerd. lib. 1. Priestes, which neuer had those vnder orders, and that manye hauinge those vnder orders continued in them, al their lyfe tyme, whereas no man taketh them all at this daye, in the Popishe Churche, but with intente to bée promoted by them, as by steppes vnto Priesthoode. For in the most auncient Church, where they were first vsed, they were names of offices, to read in the Church, to kéepe Church dores, from the entring of Gentiles or excommunicate persons, to attende vppon the Byshop as witnesses of his conuersation, and exorcists, were such as had a 
                        〈◊〉
                      to cast out diuels, of them that were possessed, the Subdeacons, to serue vnder the Deacons, in prouiding for the poore, &amp;c. But in the Popish Church, they haue none but 
                        〈◊〉
                      offices about idie ceremonies, and vain pageants of their Masses, consecrations, ordinations, and such like theatricall pompes, and showes.
                  
                     The seconde cause why our Ministers are said to bée laye men, is, for that they are not ordayned by such a Byshop and Priest, as the catholyke church hath put in that authoritie. This cause dependeth altogether vppon our olde supposition, that the Popishe Church is the catholyke Church, which is not like to bée admitted by any, but by the Papistes themselues. Otherwise the true Catholike Church hath allowed the ordination of our Ministers as lawfull, vntill by authoritie of the holy scriptures, it can bée conuinced to bée vnlawfull.
                  The third particular cause, and fifth generall reason, why our seruice is sayde to bée naught, is: Because they haue diuers false and blasphemous thinges therein. God forbid that this saying shoulde 
                        〈◊〉
                      proued true. And that which is worse, they so place those thinges, as they may seeme to the simple, to bee very scripture. A wonderfull hard accusation: but let vs heare the probation. As for example, in the ende of a certayne Geneua Psalme. They praye to GOD to keepe them from Pope, Turke, and Papistrie, which is blasphemous. If it be blasphemous, it is against y• Popes triple crown, or the Turkes torbāt, for against God it is no blasphemie, nor against his truth, or any of his children. But what an impudent slaunder is this, that the dittie, which playnely caryeth before it, the name of the endighter. Robert Wisdome, is so placed, as it may séeme to bée very scripture? And is called a Geneua Psalme, as though the Church of Geneua had any thing to doe with hymmes, and spirituall songes, vsed in the Church of England? Or that the Church of England had receiued all such ditties from Geneua. But the matter is taken greatly in snuffe, that the Pope is ioyned with the Turke, of whome al antiquitie in Christes church, hath thought and spoken so reuerently, calling him the high Priest of the church, With many other titles, which, if they might all bée iustified, of the auncient Prelats of Rome, while they were Catholike Byshops, yet they would little helpe, to defend that Antichrist, which now occupyeth the same place, but holdeth not the same foundation of fayth, and doctrine.
                  But let vs sée howe manye of these tytles were appropryed to the Byshoppe of Rome in anye time. For the fyrst and chiefest is quoted Cyprian de simplicitate Praelatorum,
                      and also

                     Chrisostome lib. 2. de sacerdotio.
                      Concerning the former treatise, there is in it, no worde of the Byshoppe of Rome, more then of all other Byshoppes, nor any such title of high Prieste, giuen vnto him, but contrariwise the vnitie of the Church is shewed to consist, in the obedience of euery perticular Church to their own Byshop, which are all made of equall authoritie and dignitie There Cyprian setteth forth the subtyltie of the diuell, which vnder the name of Christe, commendeth Antichriste, a
                        •…
                     d shewing the cause of the deceite, hee sayeth, 
                        Hoc eo fit fratres dilectissimi. &amp;c. This commeth hereof my most welbeloued brethren, while men returne not to the beginning of trueth, neyther is the head sought, nor the doctrine of the heauenly maister obserued. Which thinges, if a man consider and examine, there is no neede of large treatie or argumentes. The tryall vnto trueth, is easie by the compendiousnesse of trueth: Our Lorde speaketh to Peter: I say to thee (quoth hee) that thou art Peter, and vppon this stone, I will buylde my church, and the gates of hell shall not ouercome it. To thee I will giue the keyes of the kingdome of heauen, and what thinges soeuer thou shalt loose vppon earth, they shall bee loosed also in heauen. And to the same man, after his resurrection hee saieth: feede my sheepe. And although after his resurrection hee giueth equall power to all his Apostles, and saieth: As my Father sente mee, so I also sende you: receaue the holye Ghoste: whose sinnes you shall forgiue, they shall bee forgiuen: whose sinnes you shall retayne, they shall bee retayned: yet that hee myght make the vnitie manifest, hee disposed the original of that same vnitie by his authoritie, beginning of one man. Verilye the rest of the Apostles were the 
                           •…
                        ame thing that Peter was, endued with equall felowship, both of honour, and of power, but the beginning proceedeth from vnitie, that the church might bee shewed to bee one And after a fewe lynes, entreating of the vnitie of the Church, hee saieth: 
                        Quam vnit atem, &amp;c. whiche vnitie most of all, wee that rule as Byshoppes in the Churche, ought to holde faste, and mayntaine, that wee myght proue the Byshoppes office it selfe, to bee one, and vndeuided. Let no man deceaue the brotherhoodde with a lye, Lette no man corrupte the trueth of

fayth, by such preuarication, There is but one byshopricke or bishops office, whereof a parte is helde of euery one, in solidum, throughly, or perfectly, or in the whole. You sée that Cyprian saith nothing for his title, but against the Antichristian authority, pretended therby, very much &amp; very effectuously. But what saieth Chrisostome in his 2. booke de sacerdotio, sounding to that purpose? I finde nothing, but that he admonisheth Basill, that he had no iniury in being taken by sorce, and made a priest, séeing he was therby made equall with Peter, euen as Peter excelled all the Apostles. Etiam ne nunc nobiscum, &amp;c. 
                     Wilte thou then still contende with vs, that this fraud hath not happened wel &amp; luckely to thee? Which by it, art to be made ouerseer of all the goodes of God almightie, especially when thou doest those thinges, whiche when Peter did, Christ woulde haue him to be indued with authoritie, and also farre to excell the other apostles. These woordes shewe, that euery Priest when he doeth the same thinges which Peter did, is indued with the same authoritie that Peter was, and farr passeth all other men. And that Peter was not simplie preferred in authority, but only when he did execute his charge &amp; therfore so preferred that euerie minister in teaching and administring the sacraments, hath the same authoritie and excellencie.
                  The next title pretended to be giuen to the Pope, by all antiquitie, is the Bishop of the vniuersal church, For which is quoted Cyprian Epist. 46. that of Cyprian is no more, but that certaine Confessors, which had ioyned with the Nouatian Scismatikes, that made an other Bishop at Rome beside Cornelius, returning to the Church, acknowledged that Cornelius was the right bishop of the Catholike Church, and Nouatus, or Nouatianus a false byshop of a scismaticall Church, The wordes of their confession are these, Nos inquiunt. &amp;c. 
                     
                        We say they, doe know that Cornelius is set vp by God Almightie, and by our Lorde Iesus Christ, a bishop of the most holy Catholike church. We confesse our errour. We haue been circumuented, being carried out of our right minde by factious loquacitie of falshood, Wee seemed to haue as it were a certayne communicating with a schismaticall person: but our mynde was alwaye sincere in the churche, neyther are wee ignoraunte, that there is one GOD, and one Christe, our Lorde, whom we haue confessed, one holye Ghoste, that there
                        
                        ought to be but one bishop in a catholike church.
                      Meaning that in euery Catholike Churche, there ought to bée but one Byshoppe at once, not that there shoulde bee but one bishop of all the Catholike Church, which were a monstrous absurdity.
                  The thirde title, is The Pastour of the Churche, for whiche is quoted Chrisostome lib. 2. de Sacer.
                      Where I finde nothing that hath any shewe of suche a matter, more then I haue alreadye declared.
                  The fourth, the Iudge of matters of faith, for which is quoted, Innocentius Epist. 93. apud August.
                      and Leo Epist. 84, These are both bishops of Rome, and partiall witnesses, to depose of theyr owne Prerogatiue, shewing what they claymed, and not what al antiquitie gaue vnto them. The Romane Prelacie, as Socrates testi

Which this reasoner sayth was giuen him by all antiquitie.
                  The fifth title is the repurger of heresies, for which is quoted: Sy Alex. 4. apud Athanasium. But Athanasius allowed no sucheConc. Carth. 3. ca. 26. Epist. ad solit. vit agentes. title to the Romane bishoppe, whom he confesseth to haue subscribed to the Arrian heresie. 
                        Liberius deinde. &amp;c.
                      
                     After Liberius had passed twoo yeeres in exile, he was turned, and through threates of death induced to subscription.
                  
                  The sixth title is, The examiner of al bishops causes, for which is quoted. Theodor. lib. 2. hist. cap. 4. UUhere there is no such matter, but that Athanasius desired to haue his cause examined and tried by Iulius Bishop of Rome, which when it procéeded not because his aduersaries would not appeare, his cause was referred by the Empérour Constantius his commaundement, to the councell of Sardica, when finding no helpe in Iulius the Byshoppe he had first appealed to the Emperour Constance.
                  
                  The last title is, The great Priest in obeying whom all vnitie consisteth, and by disobeying of whome, all heresies and

Schismes arise. Cyp. Epist. 55. This place is alreadie answered, to pertaine no more to the bishoppe of Rome, then to any other Bishop.
                  A second cause he rendreth, why our seruice is blasphemous, because wee pray to be deliuered from papistrie, which hee sayth, is onely true religion, but that hath neede of many suppositions to prooue it.
                  A third cause he yeeldeth, Because they sing it and make other simple men to sing it, in the beginning of sermons and otherwise, as though it were scripture it selfe, and one of Dauids Psalmes. If men were as ignorant in the scriptures and Psaimes of Dauid, as the Papists would haue them to be, this pretensed cause coulde haue but smale coller, seeing the title of this hymme, in euery booke plainly sheweth, that it is none of Dauids Psalmes, and the prayer conceiued therein for the Queene and her Councell, with diuers other requestes, pec

Much lesse can it with any apparance of reason be gathered that there is any purpose in them, that cause it to be song to induce any man neuer so simple, into such a grosse error, that he shoulde thinke the same song to be scripture it selfe, or one of Dauids Psalmes.
                  The fourth reason in particuler, why the Protestantes must be déemed naught, is, Albeit it had not all this euill in it, yet because it hath not in it, those good thinges, which christian seruice should haue: for seruice (sayth he) may be euill as well for hauing too little, as for hauing too much, as the Arrians seruice, for singing glory to the father, and not singing the same to the sonne. As if a man should recite his Creed, and leaue out one article, as in effect the Protestants doe the article of discention into hell, all the whole Creede were naught thereby. In deede whatsoeuer is defectiue in any necessarye parte, cannot bee perfectly good, in the whole, but that for wante of some good partes, all other good partes shoulde bee naught, that is a great vntrueth: as also it is a senselesse

But God receiueth no sacrifices, but of his priestes. Wherefore God before hand doeth teslifie, that he doeth accept all them that offer by this name, the sacrifices which Iesus Christ hath deliuered to be made, that is in the Euchariste or thankesgeuing of the breade and the cuppe, which are done in euery place of the Christians.
                      By which words it appeareth, that thankesgeuing was offered in the Sacrament not that Christes natural bodye and blood was offered therein: and this not by the Prieste alone, but by all Christians.

For these are the onely sacrifices that christians haue receiued to make, to be put in minde by their drie and moyst nourishment, of the passion which God the sonne of God, is recorded to haue suffred for them.
                      This place doth not onely shew, what the only sacrifice of Christians was in his time, but also teacheth, that in the Sacrament is drie and moyst nourishment, that is bread and drink, and not bare accidents, as the Transubstantiators affirme. Therefore howe little Iustinus maketh for the Sacrifice of the Masse, these places doe sufficiently declare. And howe vntrue it is that all the Fathers of the Primitiue Churche, with one consent doe affirme it. Declaring rather▪ how al the Fathers of the Primitiue church,

that speake of the Sacrifice of the Church, are to be vnderstood, of a Sacrifice Eucharysticall, and not Propitiatorie.

The fleshe and blood of this sacrisyce before the comming of Christ, was promised by oblations of similitudes: In the passion of Christe it was geuen vp by the very truth. After the Ascention of Christ, it is celebrated by a sacra ment of remembraunce Goe your wayes now, and charge Augustine, to affirme a sacrifice in proper speech, to be offered of the bodie and bloode of Christ, which he himselfe affirmeth, to be a me morie of the only sacrifice of Christe, once offered, as the legale oblations, were promises of the same sacrifice before it was perfourmed.

And what other thing truely, are these instrumentes and vessels, but the workes of mens handes? But yet haue they a mouth and shall not speake? Haue they eyes and shall not see?

                  The seconde thing, which hée complayneth to bée left out of the Protestantes seruice, is no lesse then sixe of the seauen Sacramentes. That wée haue the two Sacramentes, which onelye were instituted by Christ, I haue shewed before sufficiently, And séeing hée will néedes take one of them from vs perforce, I will shewe that in accounte of Papistes them selues, wée haue one more then those two. For except they did acknowledge vs to haue the Sacrament of Matrimonie (albeit wée account it none) they woulde make it as frée, for persons maryed in our Church to departe one from the other, that is willing to departe, as the Apostle maketh it for them, that béeing maryed in paganisme, were forsaken of the vnfaythfull partie, and no more bound vnto them. The places that hee quoteth out of Augustine, to shewe that the Sacramentes are not to bee contemned, myght well haue beene spared, excepte hee coulde haue brought somewhat to proue those siue, wherein they excéede vs, to bee Sacramentes of Christes institution. But the supposition first protested of, is the best proofe hee hath for that poynte. The thirde thing that hee accuseth the Protestantes seruice, to leaue out, is all the ceremonies of the catholyke church, of which, the olde auncient Fathers and councelles doe saye these three thinges.
                     
                     first, that they are to be had in great reuerence, and not to be contemned of no man. Secondly, that they are to bee learned by tradition, and that manye of them are receiued by the tradition of the Apostles. Lastly, that they which doe eyther conte

                     ramined, will make as little in a manner, as they did before for the Pope, and the sacrifice. First Tertullian de corona militis
                      nameth in déede many ceremonies to haue béene vsed in the Church by tradition, whereof many are neyther vsed of vs, nor of the Papistes themselues. As in Baptisme beside thrise dipping, to taste of milke and hony. To abstaine from washing by a whole wéeke after. To receiue the communion in the méetinges that were before day. To make oblations for the death of men, and for the byrth on the yearely day. At euery steppe and going forward, at euery comming in, and going out, at putting on of garmentes, at putting on of showes, at washing, at tables, at lightes, at beddes, at seates, or any thing that they occupied, to make a crosse on their foreheades, which they did to testifie that they were Christians, against the Paganes.
                  Howe many of these thinges, doe the Papistes obserue more then wée? If they maye bée discharged for omitting some of these aunciente Ceremonies, why is not the same equitie graunted to vs, against which nothing can bée brought, but the stale supposition, that they maye doe what they lyst, because they are the onely Catholykes.
                  The next Doctour quoted, is Basill de spiritu sancto.
                      Who referreth vnto tradition, these Ceremonies following. To marke them with the signe of the Crosse, which beléeue in Christ, and are baptized. To praye towardes the East. The wordes of inuocation whyle the Bread of thankesgiuing, and the Cuppe of blessing is shewed. The blessing of the water of Baptisme, and the oyle where with the baptized is annoynted. The dypping thrise in baptisme, the renouncing of Satan and his Angelles. What great Ceremonies are héere, that are omitted in our seruice.

Epiphanius is quoted. Her, 71. Which is against the Plotiniones, in which chapter there is no worde of Ceremonies or traditions: it may bée an error in the number: for Hier. 61. contra Apostolicos,

Many of the faith full came (to the Apostles) confessing and reuealing their owne acts. And foure hundred yeeres after that, S.

Let no man say, I doe it secretly, I doe it with God alone, God which hath to pardon me, knoweth wel how that I doe repent in my heart.

And not onely this, but if a man be in any mortal sinne whatsoeuer, as long as he abideth in the same without repentance, and confession, al deuines holde, that he looseth the reward of al his good deedes.

As for the visions of Angels that Chrysostome speaketh of in the place by him quoted, proue nothing, but the presence of them. But Hom. 3. contra Anomaeos, Hée explicateth the same more at large, saith our Reasoner. At that time my deare brother, not onely men doe giue out that dreadfull crye.

But also the Angels doe bowe their knees to our Lorde, and-the Archangels doe beseech him. For they account that a fit time, hauing that sacred oblation in their fauour.

And in like maner: I beleeue and confesse, that all those fayned and false shewes, by which, the veritie of the Gospel is hidden, &amp; the word of God despised, or by which, the ignorant and infidel is confirmed in his error, or by which the weake is offended, are not of Cod, but of Sathan, altogether contrary vnto the trueth of the word.

nature, as the cōsideration of most of the reasons doth declare. For albeit, it be prohibited by the churche, yet not onely by the church: seeing that a thing may be prohibited by the canons of the churche (for more plaine explicatiōs sake) which was forbiddē before by the law both of nature &amp; of God also: as Adulterie, Violence, Simonie, and the like. Euen so, albeit going to hereticall assemblies be prohibited by the church: yet because it hath in it, or necessarily annexed to it, diuers thinges which are prohibited by the lawe of God and nature, (as perill of infection, Scandale, deniyng of our faith when it is made a signe distinctiue, or commaundement dissēbling in gods cause, honoring gods enimies dishonoring the catholik church, and the like) therefore, the whole acte of going to church, is saide to be prohibited also.

Wherefore, that which hath been giuen out (as is saide by some great men) that the Pope by his letters to her Maiestie, did offer to confirme the seruice of England, vppon condition that the title of Supremacie might be restored him again, is impossible to be so: so that, if any suche letters came to her Maiesties handes, they must needes be fained &amp; false.

For albeit Scandal bee one reason, why it is vnlawful, and that in such sort, as is almost impossible to be auoyded: yet you see, that I haue giuen diuers other causes besides Scandal, which make it vnlawful. Whereof it followeth, that a man cannot goe to their churches, albeit hee might goe in such secrete maner, or otherwise haue their seruice in his house so priuily, as no Scandale shoulde followe thereof, or any man knowe thereof, (whiche is notwithstanding impossible to doe, but if it coulde bee, yet were the thing vnlawefull, especially for the 1, 4. 5. 6. 7. reasons before alleadged.

Seeing by this protestation, hee shoulde testifie vnto the whole worlde, that he did a thing against his conscience.

But (I thinke) by this time hee hath felt, that hee was deceaued. For when aMarke this obiection, of going to the materiall Church. thing it selfe is naught, no protestation can make it lawefull, but rather maketh the doing of it a greater offence, by adding the vnlawefulnesse of the thing the repugnaunce of the doers conscience. But you will perhaps say: to goe to the material church, is not a thing euill of it selfe. I answere and graunt that it is true. But you must not single out the matter so. For in this one action of going to church, there be many things contained, wherof the whole action is compounded. As for example, there is the material church: the possession of the same by the enemie of the catholike religion: the seruice and sermons in reproofe of the same religion: the dayes and houres appoynted for the same: the bel ringing and publikly calling al men thither: the Princes commaundemente for the Catholikes to goe to the same: the end of the commaundement in general, that they, by going,Hovv many things

                         in going to church should pray with them, allowe of their seruice, and by their presence, honour it. Then is there the peril of infection: the scandal wherby I offend other mens consciences: and perhaps bring diuers other to bee corrupted by my meanes: the dishonouring of God his case: the honouring of his enemies cause: hearing God blasphemed, and holding my peace: Semblably there is the conscience of the catholike, that thinketh he doth nought: the explication of the church, that is not lawfull: the matter nowe in tryall: and the vnlawfulnesse of it, defended both by word and writings of learned men, ann by imprisonment of many other: the controuersie now knowne to all the world and many thousand mens eies fixed vpon them, that are called in question for it: the Protestant, wheras he esteemed nothing of goeing to Church before, yet now so desirous to obtayne it, that hee thinketh the yeelding in that one poynt, to bee a sufficient yeelding to all his desires: the which thing on the other side, is so detested of the true catholikes, that, whosoeuer yeeldeth to this, they thinke him a flat Schismatike, and so abhor him. And by this meanes the matter is made a signe distinctiue betwixt religion and religion: whereof againe it foloweth, that if the thing were much lesse then it is (as for example, the holding vp of a finger) yet because it is made, Tessera, a marke, token, or signe of yeeling to

their proceedings in religion, it were viterly vnlawful. As if a man shoulde but lyft vp a straw to the deuill, in token of obedience, it were as much, asNote this simi

Neyther, if you could by some deuice, pluck from this action one or two of these things, must we think that by and by the action were lawful. As for example, if by a protestation you could signifie that your minde were not in going thither, to consent to their seruice: as also, that the princesse minde to you in particular, were onely that you should goe for temporal obedience sake, yet were not by this all the matter amended. For if a peece of meate were venomous for ten causes concurring together, ifyou should take away two of them, and so eate it, you might for al that be poysoned therwith.

Which words can importe no more, but a graunting to his request: which was, to pray to God that hee woulde pardon him, if he went so to chuch, or at the vttermost (as some will enforce it) a tolleration with him, being yet a Proselite or a new gotten man, to do this temporal seruice vnto his king: (for he went not vpon commandement to shew his religion as our men doe) especially, it beeingAct. 19.

For the same word which we translate here adore, doeth in Hebrew, Greeke, and Latine, signifie often tymes onely bowing downe, without any diuine adoration. As when IaoobGen. 32. adored his brother Esaw seuen tymes, that is, bowed downe to him seuen times. And Dauid adored Ionathas king Saule his sonne three times. Abigaile also adored Dauid twise.

For most certaine it is, that if all bee not lawefull, then no parte of it is lawefull. And Christ saith, thatMat. 5. hee will not haue one iot of his lawe to bee past ouer vnkeept: and who soeuer shall breake one of the least of his commaundementes, shall haue least part in the kingdome of heauen. The which wordes of Christ,Iacob. 2. Saint Iames explicating, saieth. Hee that keepeth all the whole lawe, and doeth offende but one thing onely, yet is he guiltie in all the rest. AndApoc. 2.

But the Procestāts thēselues (saith he) are recusants also in other countries. Yea &amp; very good cause why they should, seing they ought to absteyne frō idolatry &amp; superstitiō which is committed dayly in the popish churches. But therby (saith he) It appeareth: that they goe quite against their own doctrine &amp; example in Englād, which obiect the same to catholikes, as disobedience, obstinacy, and rebellious dealing within other countries, they themselues both teach and practise.▪
                      Alas poore Sophister, this is sorie stuffe. The true Christians teach and practise that they maye not be defiled with idolatry, therfore heretiks be not disobedient, obstinate and rebellious, when they refuse to communicate wt the true church &amp; submit thēselnes to ye godly lawes of a christiā magistrat. Yet the madde man pleaseth himselfe so much in this absurd cōscience, y• after he hath alleadged a large cofession of one Iohn Gardiner

As though the Prince &amp; Magistrats, y• execute the lawes for cōming to church, would haue the papists to come like hypocrits, dissēblers, &amp; counterfeiters, &amp; not rather y• they may heare the word of God preached, be instructed, beléeue, and be saued.

The reasons thus vnreasonably discoursed, hee gathereth out of the same, certayne shorte conclusions, which because they are all aunsweared before, I will not now stand to repeate the answeres, only where any new matter occurreth, I wil briefely note it vpon the first conclusion: hée aunsweareth another conclusion, that no power vppon earth canne dispense with goyng too Churche, whiche is prohibited by the law of GOD and nature. Here hee biddeth open warre to the Canonists, which defend that the Pope may dispense almost with al matters. And sée wée not in his dispensations for marriage, that a man may marry his brother or sisters daughter,Leuit. 18. which is contrary both to the law of God and nature, that the Pope doeth dispense with suche marriage, what the Pope did offer by his letters to her Maiesty, I neuer heard it reported whiche he saith is geuen out by some greate men.

                  In the 3. conclusion is contayned a case with 4. qualifications, in which a papist might lawfully goe to Church, namely, for some méere, particular, knowne, tēporall businesse, without geuing any signe of reuerence and honor to their seruice. Which is nothing to y• purpose or matter in questiō, whiche is, whether Papists y• are so

obstinate ye they wil not bee taught, are to bee compelled eyther to yéelde too instruction, or too suffer punishment vntill they shalbée willing.
                  In the later end he shameth not to repeat, that his meaning was to geue some satisfaction to her Maiestie, and the Right Honorable of her councell, touching the Principles (he should rather haue said the petition of principles) which catholikes haue, to refuse that conformity, which is demaunded at their handes. Nay rather her Maiesty and Councell, when they sée that Papistes haue no reasons to yéelde for their obstinacie, but such as stand vppon so vnreasonable suppositions, as no man liuing, would graunt against his cause and religion, they may bee better encouraged to proceede in punishing that contumacie, which is not grounded vpō any approoued reason or authority of Gods worde, but vpon the méere wilfulnesse and suppositions of wicked and vngodly men, whiche howsoeuer béeyng nowe disappointed of the intended massacres and treasonable purposes, they woulde be taken for honest and true subiects, yet can they not perswade any wise man, that they depending vppon the oracle of Antichrist, who hath taken vpon him, like a proude Instrument of Satan, to depose her Maiesty from her royal throne, and to discharg a

                  The first part of this treatise beeing ended, I knowe not what friende of his, maketh his excuse for omission of the second &amp; thirde part promised in the beginning, whereof the one was, what way or meanes Papistes may vse too remedie or ease themselues, of this afflictiō now layde vpon them, for their conscience. The other if that way or meanes doe not preuayle, then howe they ought too beare and indure the same, These parts the writer (saith he) part ly by euill disposition of body, and partly by other sodayne busines falling vpon him, hée was inforced to leaue out.
                  But the contents of the second parte which is missing should be to shew (as hée sayth) How the only way which catholiks haue of remedie or easement in these their afflictions, is prayer &amp; humble recoursevnto the good nature, mercy, &amp; wisedome of the Queenes Maiesty: confuting the custome of al heretikes, which in euery countrie where they are contraried, seeke to molest and disturbe by rebellion, their Lords and heades.

                        antia Sess. 8. &amp; lib. 4. Trial. cap. 36. That Christians are bound to no Princes lawes, and therefore it is lawfull for the subiects to rise against their Princes, and punish them at their pleasures if they rule amisse.
                  
                  This detestable slander indéed, is most vniustly laid vpō 
                     Wickliffe in y• wicked councel of Constantia, 40. yeres after he was dead, which is manifestly disproued▪ by his owne woorkes yet extant to be séenè, in which he teacheth the contrary, but it is a slander, without all colour, y• 
                     Luther should so teach, except it were whē he was a Papist. The other for which he quoteth▪ 
                     Caluin. lib. 4. institut. 10. part. 5.) is charged to say, That howsoeuer the prince ruleth wel or euill, yet his lawes binde not the subiectes to obey in conscience, but onely for feare of temporall punishment, so that if the subiect were of abilitie, to resist the prince, he might without sinne doe the same. Let any man that will turne the booke, and if he finde in Caluine these words, or in the doctrine of them, let him boldely condemne Caluine, not onely for an heretike, but also for a common enemy of mankinde. That whiche Caluine speaketh, of the spirituall libertye of a Christian mans conscience, whiche must bee kept wholly in subiection vnto God, how maliciously this lewd writer draweth to such seditious heresies, fiue hundreth places in Caluins woorks directly condemning all rebellion, sedition, and murmuring against Magistrates,

and exacting obedience vnto them, not onely for feare, but also for conscience sake, doe most abundantly demonstrate. But what the doctrine of the Papistes is concerning obedience, to lawfull Magistrates, let the Bull of Pius Quintus and the same repeated by Gregorius 13. against her Maiestie, sufficiently beare witnesse. Except you wil say these Popes, for geuing such Bulles, and al Popes for clayming and practising such authority, are Heretikes. If your popish doctrine, and practise had béene agaynst rebellion, why did not your Pope excōmunicate the procurers and stirrers vp of y• rebellion in the North? or, if he lacked time because it was suppressed before knowledge coulde come vnto him. Tel vs I pray you, how many of the knowne rebelles that fledde ouer the Sea, haue byn excōmunicated for raysing war against the Prince, in her owne dominions? Doeth not your open acceptation of them, without any penance or satisfa

                     ion, declare that your church well liked of their traiterous fact? Yea, from whence proceeded the whole traiterous attempt, but from the Popes approbation and promises. You deceiue your selues to much, when you thinke to take the charge and crime of rebellion and treason from your owne consciences, and to lay it vppon Luther and Caluines backes, and imagine you shoulde finde credite among wise men. There were other secrete causes why this second part was omitted, as there be other meanes of easement, whiche you daily séeke, and therefore doe allow, whatsoeuer you pretende to the contrary.
                  As for the third parte of considerations and comforte were to small purpose, except you did first prooue the cause of your suffering to be good and godly: for not the paine, but the cause maketh a Martyr. Which séeing you are not able to defend, you suffer not as Christians, but as euill doers, not as humble Martyrs, but as obstinate and rebellious Heretikes.
               
               God be praysed.
