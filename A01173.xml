            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

1574. trauayling
frō 
               Florēce towards
Millan, I by chance
met with a Florentine gentleman,
who, after certayne embraſinges
and acquaintance taken by reaſon
of ſome former knowledge both

at the court and at Paris, vſed ſuch
courteſy and honeſty towards me,
that of force I was compelled not
to leaue his companye, before I
had viſited hys manſion houſe,
whereas hauyng for the ſpace of
two dayes enterteyned mee wt very
good cheere, I hauing pulled on
my bootes, determining to returne
whither as eſpecially my way lay,
and being ready to take my leaue
of him, he brought into my chamber
a pourſe, conteyning by eſtimation
(cōſidering the greatneſſe
and weight of the ſame) a thouſande
or xii. hundred crownes, deſiring
me to take ſo much thereof
as my ſelfe thought good, for the
which, (notwithſtanding I had
thereof great neede,) yet determining
to make of neceſſitie vertue
according vnto my duetie I thanked
hym, perſwading my ſelf tha
                  •
               
               
at Millan I ſhold meet ſome frend
who would lend me ſo much. But
he hauing ſhewed me, yt knowing
from how long and tedious a iourney
I now was returned, he was
not alſo ignorant how ſore it had
conſumed my coyne, wherefore he
earneſtly entreated me not to conceale
my neceſſitie, but willed mee
in any wiſe to take my commoditie
of his ſtore as him ſelfe in lyke
caſe would doe with mine, wherevpon
doubtynge leaſte ſome of
my trayne had reuealed vnto
hym my eſtate, as in very deede
the nexte day I learned who had
committed this offence) I made
hym anſwear that ſeing he would
needes doe me ſuch a pleaſure, I
wold willingly borow of him two
hundred crownes, I had ſcarcely
ſayd the word but preſently he told
me out three hundred piſtolets vpon

my own band which I deliuered
vnto him ſealed and ſubſcribed
with my owne hande, which
with great dificoulty I forced him
to take, and beſides that hee vſed
toward me ſo much verteous and
honeſt communication with ſuche
thanckes for that I had ſo muche
pleaſured him as to come and viſite
his houſe, and ſo largely opened
my ſelfe vnto him, that if the
opinion of Pithagoras were as certayne
as in deed it is falſe, I ſhuld
haue occaſion to thincke that the
ſoule of ſome Frenchman of the
former time, reteyning yet the taſ
                  •…
               
of his former Adam, had bene lodged
in the body of this man, euen
from the day of his birth. Wherevpon
I am ſo greatly bound vnto
him, that I doubt I neuer ſhal be
able ſufficientlye to diſcharge my
ſelfe, and yet is it but ſmall, in reſpect

of that wherein all Frenchmen
are bound to him generally,
and my ſelfe perticulerly, in that
after large communication of the
miſeries of France, with the water
in hys eyes, he drew out of a ſmal
boxe two leaues of paper written
in Italian ſpeach and letter, and
deliuered them vnto mee to read,
wherin I ſatiſfying hys expectation,
and being come vnto the laſt
ſyde, not geuing me leaue to finiſh
the ſame, he deſired mee to keepe
and tranſlate it into French, to the
ende I might ſend the copyes vnto
my frendes, bicauſe he knew it
moſt neceſſary to publiſhe the contentes
therof. Oh how good a man
he was, I would to God that all
Italians which be in France were
lyke to him, and that they were as
good Chriſtians as I know hym
to bee: Wherefore ſeeing that although

the promiſe which I made
vnto him, yt in this his requeſt, I
would not faile him, touched no other
but him ſelf only, yet could I
not be quiet▪ before I had accompliſhed
hys entent, ſo highly doe I
finde my ſelfe bonnde vnto him,
with much more reaſon thē ought
I now to proceed in the ſame, leaſt
I ſhould to greeuouſlye ſwarue
from my duetie toward my countrey,
in as much as indifferently it
concerneth all frenchmen in generall,
alſo bicauſe the effecte of the
publiſhing of the ſame, may ſtoppe
the courſe of the moſt cruell and
tirannous practiſes that euer
were conſpired in Chriſtendome,
as all men may perceaue in taking
ſo much peyne as to read my
tranſlation of the afore named
two ſheetes of paper. The which
to the ſame ende I haue dedicated

vnto all my Lordes the princes of
the blood, other Princes, Lordes
and gentlemen, and vnto all other
good and legitimate Frēchmen, of
what eſtate or condicion ſoeuer
they bee, as well of the one religion
as of the other, according to the
counſell of this honeſt Florentine,
with moſt humble ſupplication vnto
all ſuch as I doe owe the ſame,
and moſt earneſt requeſt vnto all
other, that they wil accept the zeale
and good will as well of the Florentine,
as of the tranſlator hereof
with as good a harte, as the tranſlator
doth pray vnto God long and
bleſſedly to preſerue thē in health
and proſperitie, attendyng hys
owne opinion herevpon, which he
will place in the ende of the aforeſayde
diſcourſe.

time the moſt cruell
and deteſtable murthers
whyche euer
were committed had driuen mee
out of France, by reaſon of the ſimple
ſafetie which I perceyued that
honeſt men ſhould in time to come
enioye in thoſe countreys, I haue
diuers tymes thought vpon a diſcourſe,
which once I heard geuen
in the preſence of the Kyng, the
Q. mother, my Lorde the Duke▪
ſince K. of Poole, and now King of
France, and the Countie of Re

before the Q. of Nauarre lately deceaſed
came thether, and it was

made by a gentleman, named the
Knight Poncet, whom as I haue
ſince learned, the Countie of Retz
had ſent for into Germany, for that
he had heard him accompted to be
a man of great forecaſt, iudgemēt,
and diſcourſe, who alſo had lyued
eight or nine yeares in Turquye,
and now hauyng ſundrye tymes
with my ſelfe weyed the ſayde diſcourſe,
I perceiue that out of the
ſame might be ſpronge the originall
of the aforeſayd murders, rather
then of any other thing. And
therefore bicauſe that by diuers
thinges which ſince the ſame diſcourſe
haue chāced, all men might
more aſſuredly iudge of the ſame,
vnleſſe my opinion deceiueth mee,
I thought my ſelfe bound to put
the ſame in writing, and to the end
that I might ſhake of all name of
vnthanckfulneſſe, for ſuche great

courteſies, fauours, and benefits,
as in the ſpace of 18. yeares which
I ſpent in that countrey, I had receiued
of the good and myld Frēch
nation, to giue the ſame vnto ſome
ſuche perſon as might admoniſhe
them thereof, to the ende that fynding
my iudgement not to be far
amiſſe, they might take heede vnto
them ſelues and looke better to
their own affayres, then hetherto
they haue done, and ſo to preuent
ſuch pernicious practiſes as might
be put in execution agaynſt theyr
perſons and eſtates. The ſayde
Knight Poncet, in his diſcourſe dyd
fyrſt let them vnderſtand in howe
many Countreys, Principalities,
Kingdomes and Monarchies he
had bene, then that in anye of the
ſame he could neuer fynde anye
perfect obedience vnto the ſouerayne,
except in Turquy only, and

that the ſame there proceeded principally
of the cauſes which hereafter
ſhall be expreſſed.
            Firſt the Turke hath no prince or
great Lord throughout his Empire
but ſuch as him ſelf haue created
and made of his owne liberalitie
and proper coſt, neyther ſuffreth
he any ſuch to aſcend ſo high,
but that he may plucke down and
diſpatch them at his owne wil and
pleaſure.
            Secondly, he permitteth no other
nobilitie to be in eſtimatiō through
out his empire, but hys Ianiſſaryes,
who being from their chyldehood
by him brought vp and enterteyned
as his owne creatures, are
ſo bound to his deuotion, that by
their meanes and by the auctority
of hys miniſters and officers, all
kynde of obedience is preſented
vnto hym, as well by the meane

man as by the welthy perſon, neither
is there any kinde of accompt
of preeminence, by reaſon of any
antiquitie or greatneſſe of houſes
and families, nor any excuſe for
any man not to obey him whom
the Turcke putteth in office.
            Thirdlye, hee neuer permitteth
throughout his owne dominions
any other religion then him ſelfe
doth exerciſe, except in thoſe countreis
which he hath lately conquered,
whom he will not conſtrayne
to alter theyr profeſſion, bicauſe by
ſuch meanes he may the more eaſely
enlarge his limittes, and yet
there, no man is permitted to diſpute
of religion. Moreouer in
all the coūtreys of his dominions,
are no Lordſhips nor ſeigniores,
for all the landes belong to hymſelfe,
and thoſe doth he by his officers,
ferme out vnto his ſubiectes

for a few yeares, which being expired,
the farmers or poſſeſſors
are dryuen to purchace a newe
graunt, and the ſame to acknowledge
from fyue yeares, to fyue
yeares, inſomuch that no man can
ſay, that that which he poſſeſſeth is
his owne, and ſo euery man endeuoureth
more and more to ſhewe
his obedience, to the end that therby
he and hys children may continew
in poſſeſſion in the ſayde farmes,
and by this means the great
Turcke is continually ſo well ſtored
with riches, that vpon no kind
of occaſiō he euer is forced to rayſe
taxes or ſubſidies of his ſubiectes.
            Moreouer, there be neyther fortreſſes,
neyther any wauled townes
in the harte of hys Empire,
nor in any other places, but only
on the borders and a fewe other,
in the which his officers and Cap-

                  〈2 pages missing〉
               
               
pleaſures of Kinges, whereby the
ſayd Princes and great Lordes
may rightly be termed controulers
and hinderers of the Kinges
willes, and this proceedeth of the
vnitie and agreement of the ſayde
three eſtates, and therefore it is
ſayde that Kinges be chiefe Lords
and maſters in outwarde apparence,
but in effecte they are as it
wer ſubiect to their own ſubiects,
in that they can not accompliſhe
their owne deſires, and that theyr
own mocions and reaſons for the
moſt parte be neuer accepted, notwithſtanding
diuers tymes they
tende to the augmenting of theyr
liuing, and ſometimes to the ayde
of the neceſſitie of their affayres,
and therefore the ſoner to diſpatch
himſelfe of the ſayde Princes and
great Lordes, with the reſt of the
nobilitie, to the end by that means

the ſtraightlier to ſubduce the reſt,
and ſo to diſpoſe &amp; alter all things
after his owne pleaſure and will,
it were neceſſary to vſe the troubles
for religion, for that they bee
the beſt inſtruments that might be
wiſhed to murder and ſlay on all
partes, and yet not to reiect ſuche
meanes as the peace might miniſter,
and which might be executed
as well by the parties greeued, as
by ſuch as be ingaged and bound
to his maieſties ſeruice, as the affaires
may beſt miniſter occaſion,
alſo that hereof, they ſhall fynde
choyſe of deuiſes and inuentions
inough among the aſhes of debate
and hatred, which the ſayde troubles
and deuiſions haue brought
forth. In the meane tyme to labour
by all meanes poſſible for the
deminiſhing of the ſayde Princes,
Lordes, and nobilitie, as well in

perſons, as in goodes, and not to
graunt them any thing whereby
to obteyne greater numbers of
ſeruants and bondſlaues to them
at his maieſties charges, it is neceſſary
that his maieſtie abſteyne
from giuing any rewardes and
recompences at the ſuites of the
ſayd Lordes, or of any other then
of ſuch as ſhall be founde truſtie,
and whom his maieſtie myndeth
to preferre vnto their dignities.
Alſo yt if it were poſſible, it were
good that ſuch as receiue any liberalitie
ſhould come to hys owne
preſence, to the ende they might
perceiue vnto whom they were
principally bound, and this ought
eſpecially to be obſerued among
thoſe vnto whom his maieſtie ſhal
commit any publick offices, who
alſo after theyr diſpatches ſhould
be brought to take their leaues of

his maieſte, whereby he might let
them know, him ſelfe to haue bene
the only motioner of this honour
and commodity, alſo that he might
commaund them whatſoeuer hys
maieſty ſhould thinck good, for this
be aling would greatly binde them
vnto him and be very profitable.
Moreouer that the decayed and
ruinous caſtles and charges ſhold
be giuē to ye ſaid Princes, Lords,
and noble men which ſhould remayne,
vntill the tyme were come
that they might bee diſpatched.
Alſo that in the meane tyme none
of their eſtates, pentions, or wages,
ſhould be geuen to any other
of them, then to ſuch as his maieſtie
ſhould ſee good, and that ſo by
all meanes poſſible, their commodities
might be taken away, or at
the leaſtwiſe hindered, for that by
thoſe meanes he might be the better

aſſured of them, &amp; keepe them
from practiſing any great enterpriſes,
but all muſt bee wrought
artificially and vnder fayre pretēces.
Alſo that his maieſty ſhould
not permit any aſſembly of eſtates
to be holden eyther generally or
perticulerly▪ for that they ſerue only
to bridle Kinges more &amp; more,
but rather he ought ſeuerely to puniſhe
all procurers of the ſame,
whereby the Kinges ſhall neuer
be without occaſion to diſpatche
ſuch as ſhould be odious vnto thē
               
                  •
               
and thus after that his maieſty be
diſpatched of all hys Princes,
Lordes and nobilitie as is aforeſayd,
he may eaſely atteyne vnto
the reſt, whē as all the chiefe force
and principall parte of the ſayde
eſtates ſhal be voyde, and that his
maieſty hath with the tyme, made
and created others to hys owne

mynde, for the common people of
themſelues dare not practiſe any
thynge, vnleſſe they haue ſome
great Captaines which wil either
beare them out in their doynges,
or egge them forwarde to theyr
practiſes. Lykewiſe his maieſtie
hauing made a peace, ſhould in any
wyſe puniſh, and for the ſmaleſt
occaſion that might be, put to death
all ſuch gouernours and officers
of townes, as during theſe troubles,
haue bene contrary to hys
ſeruice, for bicauſe at the firſt blaſt
of any contrary wynd, they will
not fayle but reuolt, to the ende to
exempt thēſelues from ſuch peyne
and puniſhment as they ſhould
feare to haue iuſtly deſerued for
their former follyes and offences.
Alſo at ſuch tyme as hys maieſtie
hath reduced his ſubiectes to thys
obediēce, the people dare not with

ſtand the beating down of fortreſſes,
&amp; vnmāteling of walled townes
in the hart of his kingdom, or
in any other place where his maieſtie
ſhall thinke them hurtfull:
For aſſuredly the great nūber of
Caſtles and walled townes, doe
eſpecially encorage ſeditious and
euil diſpoſed perſons, to the practiſes
of ſuch enterpriſes, and doe
make the inhabitauntes of the
ſame more haughty and leſſe obedient:
And doubtleſſe the greate
number of townes in France were
in tymes paſte, built by ſundrye
Lordes, Princes, and common
wealthes, which enioyed ſeuerall
dominions, and then ſerued for
bulwarckes &amp; defences to the one
agaynſt the others, neyther were
they gotten and incorporate vnto
the crowne as preſently they bee,
inſomuch that that, belōging now

to one only, which was wonte to
ſerue diuers, we muſt needes confeſſe
that, in that the pluralityes
and diuerſities of the grauntes of
the ſayd townes doth ceaſe, conſequently
ſuche of them as are ſituate
in the harte of the realme,
and farre from the borders, are
not only to no vſe, and vnprofitable,
as touching the defence and
conſeruation of the kingdome, but
cōtrariwiſe, ſtand in election to bee
occaſions of diuers euil demeanures
and dealinges.
            As concerning religion, at what
time his maieſty hath atteined ye cō
               moditie
&amp; profite aforeſayde, then
may he eaſely force all men to receiue
eyther his own, or any other
that his maieſtie ſhall thinke good
of, and ſo not to permit, but one
only throughout all hys dominions
and countreys, which will bee

farre more aſſured and ſtrengthened,
in caſe his maieſty would forbid
all diſputations of his ſayd religion.
Heare vpon the time drawing
on to go to maſſe, the aſſembly
brake vp, and the ſayd Poncet was
entreated to ſet downe theſe meanes
which he had diſcouered and
diſcourſed vpon, with ſuch addicions
as him ſelf ſhould think good,
and that not without great promiſes
and hope of wonderfull commoditie
and reward.
         
         
            The tranſlatours
opinion.
            
               COnſidering &amp; with
my ſelfe conferring
this braue diſcourſe,
with ſuch things as
I knowe haue paſſed

in France within theſe fewe
yeares, &amp; yet dayly doo continew,
I finde the ſame to be diligently
kept, and in all poyntes obſerued,
without omitting any parcel therof,
as playnly and openly I could
declare and repreſent to all mens
viewe, were it not that I feare
through my diſcontinewing of a
courtiers life in France, I ſhould
forget and ouerſlippe ſome of the
principall and moſt neceſſary occurrences,
which eſpecially might
procure a more aſſured iudgemēt,
which ſuche men may better vnderſtand
and know, as more ordinarely
be reſident at the court, eyther
in Paris, or in any other parte
of France, then I: among whom it
cannot bee, but that there is ſome
one, who wil in part diſcharge his
duetie vnto his countrey, parents
and frendes, and to the reſt of hys

poſteritie, if he doeth conſider the
weightineſſe and daungerous conſequence
of the ſayde diſcourſe, the
which whenſoeuer there bee any
talke of peace, all ſuch as are
deputed to the ſame, ſhould
continually remember
and wiſely conſider.
            Fare ye well.
