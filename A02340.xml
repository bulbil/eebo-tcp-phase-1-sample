            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

And nat withstandynge that there be ryght many and sondry sortes, aswell of very good and scyentyke bokes, as of ryght expert men within this Realme in the scyentycall arte of Cyrurgery.

A certayne yonge gentyll man enured in the sayd scyence haue a boke of the same in frenche moued the ryght honest ꝑsone Henry Dabbe bybliopolyst &amp; stacyoner to haue it translated in to englysshe.

            ¶Hereafter foloweth the questyonary of Cyrurgyens.
            
            ¶The Demaunde or questyon.
            WHat is Cyrurgery? The responce or answere. Cyrurgery is scyence that teacheth the maner and qualyte to worke / principally in knyttynge / in cuttyng / and exercysyng other workes of ye hande. In healynge of man, as moche as it is possyble. And here scyence is put for kynde. And albeit that Cyrurgery is of it selfe proprely by arte and no scyence / yet for the bonde and affynytie that arte and scyence haue eche with other / somtyme vnproprely that which is arte is called scyence / and that which is scyence is called arte. It is otherwyse sayde (and better) that Cyrurgery is in two maners. One is that sheweth onely so yt by it we can do nothynge as touchynge the operacion / and that proprely is called scyence / as we say in physycke that there be .vi. maners of symple appostumes / that is to wyt .iiij. humeralles / one aignous / &amp; the other vētous. The other maner of cyrurgery is vsaunce / that is to saye / that it teacheth to vse / that he yt knoweth it maye helpe hym selfe therwith as many tymes and as often as he wyll as touchyng Cyrurgycall operacions / so that by it he is gouerned and ruled whan he wyll vse it / as by the Cyrurgery that he hath in his vnderstandynge / that teacheth hym that in all hote appostumes he oughte to put and laye to it repercutyues / saufe vnto them that ben in the sumuytones / and to such as be venymous / 

This Cyrurgery or arte that thou haste in thyne vnderstandynge / teacheth the to worke &amp; vse manually in medecynes / and is proprely called arte and nat scyence. And in the ende of thy dyffynicion besyde the particulers that are put for differences that are set vnto that whiche is possyble / for it is nat possyble to all Cyrurgyens to heale all theym that are dyseased and sore. ¶Demaūde. In what case oughte a Cyrurgyen to vse very cure? And in what cases is he permytted to vse onely palliatiue cures. Answere. In all cases ought he to vse very cure / excepte in thre cases / where as alonely he is permitted the cure palliatyue. The fyrste is whan the disease of them selfes are vncurable as lazary. The seconde for ye inobedyence of ye pacient to suffre the paynes that he ought / bycause his myght can nat suffre it / as is the Canker in a pertyculer mēbre. The thyrde / yf by the cure of such a disease there foloweth a greater inconuenyent / as in to euyll inueterate sores / or in to olde emeroides / yf there be nat alway lefte an yssue there as any daū
               ger is / for drede to fall in to ydropsy or manyake / as Ipocras sayth in his Aphorysmes. ¶Demaū
               de. Wherof is named Cyrurgery? Answere. It is so named of chyr / that is a hande / and of Gow / that is operacion / for it is a scyence that teacheth to worke by hande yt is manually. ¶Demaunde. What is the subiect of cyrurgery? Answere. The subiecte of Cyrurgery is the body of man that is diseased &amp; sore able to be healed, for it is therabout

that the Cyrurgyen worketh. ¶Demaūde. what is theffecte of Cyrurgery? Answere. Theffect therof is to take away the dysease of mānes body / and to kepe it in healthe as moche as it is possyble.
            ¶Demaunde. In howe many kyndes or partyes is Cyrurgery deuysed? Answere. Iohānyce sayeth that generally it is deuysed in two, that is to wyt to worke in soft membres / as in the flesshe. And to worke in the harde mēbres as the bones. And partyculerly Cyrurgery is deuyded in .v. That is to wit to worke in woūdes / in appostumes / in sores / and in restoracyons / and in other thynges belongynge to handy operacyon. ¶Demaunde. What dyuers operacions exerciseth the Cyrurgyen? Answere. In thre dyuers operacions. That is to wyt dysolue the thynge contynued / knyt the thynge seperated / and put out the superflue thynge. To dyssolue the thynge contynued is by incysynge / cuttynge / or scaturysyng. To reioyne the seperate as in consolydynge the woundes and redusynge the lyppes. And to put out the superflue thinges, as in curyng appostumes to clense them and put away the coores. ¶Demaunde. Howe many and what yrens ought a Cyrurgyen to bere in his case with hym? Answere. He oughte to haue .v. as Cysers / Nyppers / Launcettes / Rasoures / and Nedelles. ¶Demaūde. Howe many and what oyntementꝭ cōmonly oughte the Cyrurgyen bere with hym? Answere .v. That is to wyt / an oyntement Basylycon for to rype / Apostolorum to clense / Aureum

to encrease flesshe. And the whyte oyntement for to drye and bynde. And de Althea for to sowple.
            ¶Demaunde. Of howe many thyngꝭ / and what thynges the Cyrurgyen taketh his entencions for to heale sore folkes? Answere. That after Galyen in his terapentyc they ben taken of thre thynges. That is of thynges agaynst nature / of naturall thynges / and of vnnaturall thynges / and also of theyr annexes. And fyrste he taketh this indycacyon of thynges agaynst nature / that is to wyt to the knowledge of the malady in his nature after Galyen in the seconde of his terapentic. And than come vnto the naturalles / and after to the vnnaturalles and theyr annexes. And so after his indycacyons taken he ought to procede to the healyng of the pacyent in all that may lye in hym possyble. And let the Cyrurgyen note that it is sayde / in all that may lye possyble in hym / bycause it is nat alway possyble. And with what thynges, and howe. For as galyen sayth towarde ye ende of his thyrde boke / and in the seauenth of his sayd terapentyc / 
                  •
               f the intencyons curatyues ben fewe / and accordynge / the cure is easye to the Cyrurgyen as in a symple wounde. But where there is many consy
               
                  •
               eracyons whiche in it selfe are contrary / as in a holowe woūde and apostumate and nyghe to a noble membre, the Cyrurgyen ought to consydre .iij. thynges. ¶The fyrste is, yf there be two contrary diseases, wherof ye cure of the one letteth the other (whiche is moste doubtfull and daungerous yf it

remayne) in suche case he ought to begyn his cure at the moste daungerous / &amp; where there is moste peryll in the remaynynge of it / and oftentymes more sooner in the accydentes that happeneth in a sore / then in the sore selfe. As whan a great flux of blode ouercōmeth in any woūde or any sore fretynge that hath corroded any vayne / in suche case often he must leaue the healynge of the sore for to entende to the flux of blode that is so great. Lykewyse yf in a sore were any synew that was pricked wherof foloweth crampe / there must he begyn at the pryckyng of the synew for daunger of the spasna, which is moste peryllous. The seconde thyng that the Cyrurgyen oughte to consydre is / yf one of the sayde dyseases be nat the cause of the other, and nouryssheth nat the other. In suche case he ought to begyn at the cure of it that is the syller and nouryssher of the other. For tyll that yt which is the causer of the other be totally extyrped the healynge can nat be. ¶Demaunde. Howe many consideracions ought the Cyrurgyen to haue touchynge his fourme and generall maner to worke manually? Answere. After Arnolde de villa noua, he ought to haue .iiij. The fyrst is he ought to consydre what operacyon it is that he ought to do to mānes body. And it is knowen by the dyuysyon of the operacyons of Cyrurgery aforesayde / that is to knyt the thynge deuyded. The seconde consyderacyon is / that he ought to consydre wherfore he worketh. And this is knowen by ye general intencyon

of Cyrurgery, that cōmaūdeth to do the operacions vnto the body of man profitably with confydence or surenes. The thyrde consyderacyon is / that he oughte to consydre yf suche operacyon be necessary &amp; conuenable to be done to mānes body. And this he knoweth whan it can nat be healed otherwyse. And the fourth consyderacyon is / that the Cyrurgyen ought to knowe howe to bestowe his remedyes to the body of man. In these consyderacyons the Cyrurgyen oughte to take hede in doynge all thynges that he ought to do / as touchynge this operacyon / aswel before the workyng as after. The whiche .iiij. consyderacyons thou mayest haue and perceyue by suche an example. Yf thou wylt draw water fro the belies of ydropikes by manuall operacyon. Fyrste thou ought to consydre that the operacion which thou wylt do is to drawe out the said water. Secondely thou ought to consydre wherfore thou doest it / for it is for to 
                  •
               eale / or at ye least way to gyue ease. Thyrdly why ther such operacyon be necessary / nedeful / or possy
               
                  ••
               e. And thou ought to wyt that it is necessary at 
                  ••
               ast wayes yf thou wylt heale an ydropyke of the 
                  •
               dropesy confermed / and thou knowest that it is 
                  ••
               defull and possyble yf the myght of the pacyent 
                  •
               e strong / for yf it be weke be wel ware for to do it. And fourthly thou ought to cōsydre the maner to do it, which is such. Fyrst lye thy pacient vpryght, and than with a rasour cut the skynne of his bely vnder the nauel vnto the voyde places that are betwene

the cyphac and the myrac. And also thou ought to make incision on ye left syde yf the disease come of the ryght syde. Contrarywyse make ye incysion on the ryght syde yf it come fro the left, and than put a lytell quyll or rede in to the hole, wherwith thou shalt drawe out of that water after the strength of ye pacient. And whan thou wylt drawe no more / take away the quyll and let the skynne of the belye go that wyll close the hole that no more water come out. And whan thou wylt drawe any more do as thou dyd before. ¶Demaunde. Howe many and what condycyons ought a Cyrurgyen to haue? Answere, iiij, The fyrste is that he ought to be lerned and a clarke / &amp; nat onely in the pryncyples &amp; begynnynge of Cyrurgery / but lykewyse in Phisyke, and asmoche in theoryke as pra
                  •
               tyke
                  •
                For in theoryke he oughte to knowe the naturall thynges and vnnaturalles / and agaynst nature, Fyrste he ought to knowe the vnnaturall thyngꝭ / and chyefly the nathomy / for without it nothinge can be done surely in Cyrurgery / as it appereth afterwarde more playnely. Also he ought to knowe the complexyon of his pacient / for after the dyuersyte of the nature of the bodyes ought the medycyns be diuersified as Galyen declareth all alonge in his terapentyke agaynst Thesilus. And by lyke reason oughte he for to knowe the strength. Secondly he ought to knowe the vnnaturall thyngꝭ, that is ye meate / the drynke. &amp;c. for they are cause of all helth when they be vsed as they ought to be.

And also they be causes of all maladies when they are euyl vsed. Thyrdly he ought to knowledge the thingꝭ agaynst nature, which are .iij. The disease, the causes, and the accydentes of the disease. Fyrst he ought to knowe ye dysease. Secondly the cause therof / for yf he healed otherwyse (it shuld nat be of a sayntes dysease / as good olde women saye) it shuld be but case of aduenture. Thyrdly he ought to knowe the accydentes that chaunce to come in dyseases / for often tymes it preuaryeth the same selfe cure of the dyseases / as Galyen declareth in the begynnynge of the boke that he sent to Glauton his dyscyple.

maner of people wold leue theyr craftes &amp; rēne to Physyke, &amp; become Physicyens. The seconde cōdycyon yt a Cyrurgyen shuld haue / is to be experte / and ought to haue sen other maisters worke. And this wytnesseth Auenzoar when he sayde thus. It behoueth that euery Physycyen fyrste knowe / and than to haue vse and experience. The thyrde condycyon that a Cyrurgyen ought to haue / is that he oughte nat to be a foole / vnwytty / nor of rude vnderstandynge. But as Haly sayth in the thyrde boke de regni / he oughte to be a man of good memory / of good iudgement / of good dylygence / of a clere syght / hole of mynde / and of his membres, with sclender fyngers / &amp; a stedfast hande without shakynge. The fourth condycyon is that a Cyrurgyen shulde haue / is that he ought to be well manered / bolde / and sure in thynges that be nat to feare. And doubtfull, &amp; fearefull in peryllous thynges. And ought to eschew all desperate cures / and ought to be gentyll to his pacientes, wel wyllyng to his company / wyly in pronostykynge / chaste / sobre / meke / and mercyfull / nat anaricious / nor extorcyoner for money. but after the capacyte of the pacyent / and the faculte receyued / competent and moderate rewarde. ¶Demaunde.

The fyrst that he oughte to be obedyent to his Cyrurgyen / as the seruaunt towarde his mayster / as Galyen

declareth in the fyrst of his Terapentyke. The seconde condycyon of the pacyent / is that he ought to haue trust in his cyrurgyen / for he heleth moste in whom he trusteth moste / as Galyen sayeth in the fyrste boke of Pronostykes.

                        •
                      The scyence of the Nathomy is nedefull and necessarye to the Cyrurgyen / as it

appereth by two reasons. The fyrste Galyen putteth in the .vj. boke of his Terapentyke, and is suche, for the Cyrurgyens that be ygnoraunt in the Nathomy may arre in many maners in theyr incysyon of synewes and theyr knyttynges, the whiche yf they knewe the nature of euery mēbre, their settynge and colligacion that they haue in all the body, and with euery onely membre partyculer / yf it dyd happen yt they were hurt they shuld knowe yf the synewes were cut or nat. And by this same reason they shuld nat arre in theyr incisions. And this reason is confyrmed by an example yt Henry de Maūdeuille putteth / sayeng that the same maner that a blynde man worketh in hewynge of a log, so doth a cyrurgyen that knoweth nat the nathomy. For lyke as a blynde man that heweth on a log knoweth nat howe moch he shuld hew therof, nor howe, &amp; therfore cōmonly he arreth hewynge more or lesse than he ought to do. Lykewyse so doth the Cyrurgyen that worketh in mānes body without the Nathomy. Also the sayde Henry approueth that the Cyrurgyen ought of necessyte to knowe ye Nathomy, for euery workeman is bounde to knowe the subiect of his worke in whiche he worketh, or els he shulde arre in workynge. Tha
                        •
                      lykewyse yf it so be that the subiecte of the Cyrurgyen be the body of menkynde, it must be of necessyte that the Cyrurgyen do knowe ye body of mankynde in it selfe / and in the partyes therof, so tha
                        •
                      it is necessary for a Cyrurgyen to knowe the Nathomy.

And this is for the fyrste parte of the questyon. ¶The seconde parte where is demaūded to howe many and what thynges the scyence of Nathomy is necessary to the Cyrurgyen. That is to wyte howe many proffytes and vtylities be of the scyence of Nathomy? The answere. The scyence of the Nathomy is necessarye and nedefull to the Cyrurgyen for .iiij. vtylyties. The fyrste and the greatest is for ye meruayle of the great power of God the creator of men, that so hath made theym to his lykenes &amp; forme. The seconde is for to haue the knowlege of the membres yt may be dyseased. The thyrde for bycause to haue knowledge to tell the disposicions to come of ye mēbres. The fourth is for to heale the dyseases yt come to the mēbres. ¶Demaunde. What is Anathomye, and wherof is it deryuate? Answere. Anathomy is the ryght determynacyon and dyuysyon of euery partyculer membre of ye body of mankynde. And is deryuate of Ana, that is to saye (nyght) that is to say (dyuysyon.) Thus Anathomy is called nyght dyuysyon of membres done for certayne knowleges. ¶Demaunde. In howe many &amp; whiche maners ought

whan he had a deade body by beheadyng or other wyse / he layde hym on a benche in makynge .iiij. partycyons. In the fyrste he deuyded the nutratyf mēbres, for they be dysposed to putrefaccyon. And in the seconde the spyrytuall membres. And in the thyrde the anymall mēbres. And in the fourth the extremyties. And vpon euery mēbre ought to be sought .ix. thynges. That is to wyt the posycyon / the complexyon, the substaunce, the quantyte, the nombre, the fygure, the operacyon, the vtilite, and what dyseases may come therunto. ¶Demaūde. What is the body humayne? Answere. It is one hole togyther decorate with reason / composed of many and dyuers membres. ¶Demaunde. what is membre? Answere. Dyuers auctours haue gyuen dyuers diffinicions. G. in the fyrste boke of the vtylyte of the partycles sayeth it is a body that is nat holly seperate, nor holly conioynt to another. And also in the fyrst boke of his canon he defyneth it in plurell, and sayth thus, that mēbres ben bodyes that are engendred of the fyrste cōmyction of humours. ¶Demaunde. Howe many maners of membres are founde? Answere. Two. That is to wyt, symple membres called consēblables, and mē

As the bone / for what parte thou takest of the bone be it more or lesse euer it beareth ye name and diffinicion of the

bone, for euery parte of a bone in bone / and euery parte of a synew in synew. The compost membres contraryly be they that maye be deuyded in other kyndes, for no parte of them seperated bereth nat away the name of all. As the hande, the legge, the heade. ¶Demaunde.

other is regeneracyon nat very / but lyke therto as nyghe as may be.

And ye other is vntrue consolydacyon / and lyke to the other as nyghe as can be done, by meanes of the poore that the Physycyons call Porus sarcoydes. These thynges

I say secondly that no membres sparmatyf after the losse of theyr substaunce maye nat regenerate bicause that their mater is attribuate to them at the very begynnynge of theyr creacyon, and after that neuer engendre agayne. And also for theyr so lidite, &amp; bicause they are weke of here &amp; moysture. And for these causes and reasons they do nat reconsolydate with trewe reconsolydacyon after the desolucion of their seperatyng, but nature strengthynge alwayes possyble thyngꝭ the best that she may / wyl nat leue them thus dyssolute, reioyneth and knytteth them the best that she may / and engendreth a flesshe (for to holde ye dissolued parties) that is called porus sarcoydes. ¶Demaunde.

In the vpper roūdnes therof is affyrmed the holownesse of the pyt or morteys bones, and there the fote is moued, and the nether roundnes is affyrmed to the concauyte of the manyculare bone / and after that forwith toward the bone called Nanyculer / that is a synew concaued on eche syde. In the fyrste concaue is receyued the roundnes of Cohas aforesayd. In the seconde concaue is receyued ye seconde coniūction of the bones of the fete / and vnder them is the bone of the hele, of the whiche all the fote is stedyed / and yssueth towarde the hyndre parte for ye strynges that are fyxed in it. ¶Demaunde. Howe many bones is there in the seconde coniunction / &amp; howe are they fygured? Answere. There be foure that be short ynough / one of them is called grandmos

                  DEmaūde. What is the maner to make bolsters? Answere. Auncyently they were made of fethers sewed betwene two whyte clothes / and therfore are they called plumeceaulx or pylowes of fethers in frenche. And bycause that they behoued to often to be renewed &amp; remoued / which was ouer anoyous / it is founde to make them of towe or flax of hemp wel boucked and clensed / and somtyme with wol or cotton / and somtyme is put soft and thynne clowtes in two or thre foldes or mo / as it nedeth. ¶Demaunde. Wherfore serueth the bolsters? Answere. To stay and conpryme the places dissolued / and confort the natural heate of the

membre vnioynte / and to deffende ye greues of the lygatures. ¶Demaūde. Howe ought the bolsters to be applicate? Answere. Somtyme they be layde to drye / somtyme they ought to be moysted or bathed in gleyr of egges, in wyne, or in oyle, as the dysposycyon requyreth. And they be of thre sortes, some be thre square, which (Auycen sayth) serue to brede flesshe / and ought to be layde on eche syde of the wounde / and the other on the wounde in ioynynge them togyder / and some are rounde that are layde drye on the other to kepe the naturall heate, and to rype the rottēnes / &amp; other be square, and they are layde to deffende the hurtynge of the lygatures.

                     olowe woundes / wherin we oughte to engendre flesshe. Thyrdly in woundes altered of ayre, which ought to be clensed. Fourthly in woundes brused. Fyfthly in appostumes. Syxtly in woundes that must be wrought about the bones. Seuenthly in bytynges. And last in woundes vlceres. And all other woundes without tentes and moches ought

to be vnderstande to be consolydate. ¶Demaūde. Wherfore be tentes and lyntes made? Answere. Some be for to clense the woundes / and they be made of softe tendre, as of seare olde lynen cloth / other are made to kepe the lyppes of woūdes open and they ben made of very clene towe / or of fyne clowtes, or cotton, or of quyll of bras or syluer holowe, as to the nosethyrlles for to haue ayre, or in depe woundes that the rottennes reclose nat but come out. Other are made to enlarge the oryfyces of the woundes / &amp; they be made of sponges harde wrythen or of Gencyan rotes.

                  ¶Demaunde.
                  WHat is bledyng or blode lettynge? Answere. Dyuers Auctours haue gyuen dyuers diffynycions of bledynge. Arnolde of the newe towne in his boke of partyculer operacyon that bledynge is incysyon of veynes / by the

whiche incysyon the blode euacueth and the humours that rēne in the veynes with ye blode. And Auycen in his fyrste fen, of the fyrste boke of his canon sayth / that bledynge is an vnyuersall euacuacyon of emptyeng the multitude of humours. And in the thyrde boke of the sayde canon he hath dyffyned that it connue euacuacyon of humours. And Galyen vpon the syxth artycle of the affoe of Ypocras vpon this canon. Quecun

What euacuacion is moste surest &amp; least daungerous / eyther the lettynge blode or the medycyne laxatyfe? Answere. After Galyen in his lytell boke that he made of blode lettynge / that lettyng of blode is the least daungerous / for it is restraynt whan we wyll, and nat the medycyne / for after that it is ones taken it wyll do ye operacyon. ¶Demaunde. For howe many intencions be the bledyngꝭ made? Answere. For .vj. The fyrste is for

                     yspatyc / that is to say dyuersyue / and this declareth Galyen in ye fyfth boke of his Terapentycke / as the flux of blode at the nose of the ryght nosethrylle, is restraynte by the bledynge of the ryght arme. And whan the lefte nosethrylle bledeth the

blode lettynge of the lefte arme restrayneth it / for the diuersion of the blode that for the blode lettynge taketh another way / and tourneth in to other places than at ye nose. And this lykewyse sheweth vs Ypocras in ye fyfth partycle of his affor / where he sayth that yf the hynder parte of the heade dyd ake / yt the souerayne remedy is to make the ryght veyne of the foreheade be opened / and nat onely for the euacuacyon that is made by the bledynge, but lykewyse for the antispase and diuersion. The thyrde intencyon wherfore bledyng is made is for to attray as Galyen declareth in the boke aboue-sayde of blode lettynge. Yf we wyll cause the menstrues of women to come we cause the sophynes of the fete to be opened / nyghe to ye tyme that they shulde come / or els we apply to them ventoses wt scaryfycacyons in the nether partyes. The fourth intencyon wherfore lettynge of blode is made is for to alter / as sayth Galyen in the fourth boke of his Terapentycke / and vpon the fyrste artycle of the affor / that blode lettynge vnto Lipothomie / that is to say vnto fayllynge of the hert, sodaynly coleth all the body / and restrayneth the feuer as yf it hadde slayne it. The fyfthe intencyon is for to preserue / and this intencyon declareth Galyen in the said boke of blode lettynge, and on the syxte of affor, vpon this affor / that to who soeuer ye blode lettynge is good &amp; conuenable where as he sayeth that many dyspose to periplemonie and spyttynge of blode, to quynsees, to epylence, and appoplexy

were preserued of the said inconuenyentes / by lettynge of blode at the sprynge tyme. The syxte intencyon is for to lyghten nature / as Galyen declareth in the eleuenth boke of his Terapentycke the xv. chapytre, towarde the myddes of the said chapytre / sayeng that it is than better to cut ye veyne, nat onely for the feuers synocalles / but also in all the other that ar of rotten humours / and to them that haue aege and suffysaūt strength therto. For nature dyspensed ouer all the body is lyghtned bycause yt the thynge that greued it is taken away / as a great burden lessened and made lyght. The rest it dygereth that ye oughte to be dygered / and dyuyde that yt ought to be dyuyded / and retourne to kyndly operacyons. ¶Demaunde. What be they that may well bere the lettynge of blode? Answere. To this questyon Galyen in the boke aboue sayd of blode lettyng sayth that it is they that are robust and stronge / and that haue byg and large veynes / and that be nat to leane, to whyte, &amp; ten

The fleumatykes, &amp; them that and wont to diseases of colde maladyes. And those that dwelleth in very colde regyons, or vehement hote. ¶Demaūde. Howe many and what veynes are to be let blode in the body of mankynde? Answere. As Haly sayeth in the nynth sermon of the seconde parte of his boke / de regali dispositione / there be xxxiij. Of the whiche there be .xij. amyd the armes / that is to wyte two medyans, two cephalykes, two basilykes, two affelleres, two cubytalles, and two seynalles. And in the heade there be .xiij. That is two behynde the eares, two in the angles of ye eyes, two organykes, two on the sūne of the heade, one on the foreheade, one on the hyndre parte of the heade, one on the nose, and two vnder the tongue. And there be .viij. in the fete, two on the knees, two sopheynes, two scyatykes, and two at the ancles. Howebeit Albucrosus putteth in all but .xxv. That is to wyt .xv. in the heade .v. in the armes, and .v. in the legges. ¶Demaunde. Is it lefull and conuenable to let blode on the arteres? Answere. Yea, howbeit it is very doubtfull / 

and yet may ye let blode at the arteres of the temples and behynde the eares. ¶Demaunde. Howe ought the arteres to be opened? Answere. It is better to cut them thorowe then otherwyse. ¶Demaunde. In howe many maners ought ye veynes to be opened? Answere. After thre maners, that is to wyt the cōmon veynes be cut in length, the partycules ouerthwart / and are cut thorowe and be canterysed. ¶Demaūde. In what quātyte ought the blode to purge by the blode lettyng? Answere, It is nat possyble to measure the blode lettynges by certayne rule / for all medycynall euacuacyons ven coniecturatyues as Galyen sayeth in his foresayd boke, and in his seconde boke of his Terapentyke. Howebeit Arnolde of de villa noua the newe towne after the doctryne of Ypocras measureth

Which of the sayd consyderacions that ought to be had to measure the quantyte of the bledyng be moste necessarye / and that ought syngulerly to be 
                        ••
                     nsydered? Answere. There be two amonge the other / that is the strength of the malady, and the vertue / for yf the malady be great and the necessyte and the vertue be stronge, a greate bledynge ought to be made for one tyme. And yf the vertue be weyke and the necessyte greate / it ought nat to be done so moche at one tyme / but ought for to b
                        •
                     
                     
withdrawen &amp; taken away at two or thre tymes / after as the vertue may suffre at once. And this to do oughte to be consydered the poulce / and whan it is seen that it alyeneth to vnequalyte / and that it minissheth the veyne ought to be stopped. Thus lykewyse ought to be consydered the colour / for yf it chaunge to better disposicion &amp; colour / it ought to be stopped. As it appereth by Galyen in ye fyfthe boke of sharpe dyseases. And the great bledyng after Galyen and Auycen is of two pounde / and the least of halfe a pounde / &amp; the meane of one poūde. ¶Demaunde. At what houre / and at what tyme oughte the bledynge to be made? Answere. At all tymes necessarye and constraynte. The tyme constraynte is the tyme whan the bledynge ought to be made / and can nat be in any wyse taryed / with out more daunger wherunto ought nat totally to be regarded in thynges that shulde hyndre or let it / yf the lettynge were nat so greate (as sayeth Bernard of Gordon) yt there myght ensue greater inconuenyence. In suche case it may be correcte &amp; tourned to some other euacuacyon / as in a chylde that hath a feuer synocall in stede of lettyng blode to be boxed. Howebeit that Auynzar let his sone blede that was but thre yeres olde, &amp; healed hym. Auerois recounteth in the seuenth boke of his collyget, in speakynge of this tyme, and this houre, at all tymes, and at all houres, as well by nyght as day, and ought to let blode without any delay. The tyme chosen is the tyme conuenable to do it / 

after the instaunce of the bodyes aboue / and the dysposycyons belowe / as to the dysposynge of the bodyes. That is to wyt that the mone haue good lyght / as of .vii.ix. or .xi. dayes in encreasyng, or of xvii.xix. or .xxi. in wanynge / and neyther be in coniunction nor opposycyon / &amp; that she be in a good place, and good sygne / &amp; fre of all yll sygnes. And mayster Arnolde de villa noua sayeth in his affor. That to let blode is best aboute the myddes of the thyrde quadre / bycause that than be but lytell condensed, no renmatizanted. And the salernytans do chuse the bledynge at dyuers houres / after that at dyuers houres the humours haue theyr cours. Neuertheles it is to be noted as touchynge these thynges that are sayde / that there where as the two influences may nat both togyder ouercome. The Phisycyen or Cyrurgyen ought sonest to stey at that yt is best knowen vnto hym / that is to the influence here beneth / whiche is effecte of the dysposycyon aboue. ¶Demaunde. Howe many and what condycyons oughte the workeman to haue that wyll dyspose hym to let blode? Answere. He

                     ught to haue foure condycyons. Fyrste he ought to be yonge, vertuous and stronge / so that he be

                     e morogie yf it hap to come. ¶Demaūde. What ought to be the maner to set blode? Answere. Fyrste he ought to rub the place well all about that he wyll let blode / and than he ought to take a lyst or a gyrdel wherwith he must bynde the membre hygher than the place where he wyll make the openynge. And than he ought well to holde the place where the veynes is that he wyll open / and seke it with the ende of his fynger / and than open it softely / and pearce it nat thorowe / but ought to reyse somwhat the poynte of the launcet vpwarde for feare to hurt ye artere or the synewe / and his euacuacyon thus suffycyently done, to take awaye the gyrdell that it was bounde wt / and dylygently close the wounde with a lytell cotton and bende it. ¶Demaunde. Howe ought he to be gouerned that wyll be letten blode before he do blede / and after that he hath bled. Answere. To the fyrste demaūde I say or he be letten blode / yf he double that the blode be grosse / or in colde wether as in wynter / he ought to walke a lytell and trauayle / or be bayned the day afore / specyally yf he shulde blede at any lytell veyne of the handes or fete. And yf ye veynes as yet appere nat wel, a day before he must haue a plaster of leueyne And yf he doubte of his strengthe that he were to weyke / or he blede gyue hym a

                     maunde howe

he ought to be gouerned whan actually he is let blode. Fyrste yf he haue rynges or stones that haue specyall vertues for to staunche that he leaue them of. And than whan ye opening is made gyue hym a staffe in his hande / and that he remoue his fyngers and coughe / and that he be a lytel stryken on the hande and sholdres. And yf the wether be colde / or that ye doubt that the blode be to grosse, or that ye make fecōdacyon / ye must make an openynge longe ynoughe. And in wether / and opposyte dysposycyon ye must make it lesser / and yf the vertue be weyke ye must haue colde water all redy for to rubbe hym. And make hym other thynges that are accustomed to be made for faylyng of the hert, yf his herte do faynte. As to the thyrde questyon, howe he ought to be gouerned after the bledynge / I say that yf for the bledynge he chaufe, ye must gyue hym some of a pomgarnade to eate wt a lytell colde water, by ye counceyll of Galyen / and yf he be nat chauffed gyue sauge leues wet in wyne. And then lye hym vpryght vpon a bedde decly

                     yng somwhat on the syde that he hath blede on / and close the dore and the wyndowes / so that by ouer moche light his eyen be nat troubled. And an houre after, (nat before) let hym 
                        •
                     ate temperatly &amp; nat gredyly / &amp; let his meate be of good substaūce and qualyte / and that it eugendre good blode and rectify the yl yf any be, and let his drynke be more than his meate / but nat so moche as he is wonte. And yf he be accustomed to slepe .ij. or .iij. houres / 

after let hym slepe a lytell. Howebeit Auycen forbyddeth holly the slepynge soone after lettynge of blode / for the cōfraction that than after ensue in the membres / &amp; that the pacyent take good hede that his veyne open nat agayne / and he ought to kepe this rule thre dayes after. ¶Demaunde. Is the Cyrurgyen bounde to haue the knowledge of the blode that is drawen? Answere. No, but the beholdynge of the said blode belongeth to Physycyens. Neuerthelesse for to comforte hym yt hath bled / &amp; to reioyce hym he oughte to loke on it, and tell hym that his bledynge was good / for ye blode that is drawen was good / and that is better that is remayned, and yf it be yll it was a good bleding for hym. ¶Demaunde. If the Cyrurgyen wolde haue the knowledge of the blode yt he hath drawen by the blode lettynge / howe shall he dyscerne the good from the bad? Answere. For the good is it that is his substaunce is neyther to thycke nor to thynne, and that is frangyble / and in his coloure is redde. In odoure pure, and in sauour swete and amyable / and the yll blode is it that is deuoyde of the sayde condicyons, as the coleryke yt is to thyn̄e and yelowe and bytter / and is sharp in smell. And the melancolyke blode is thycke and blacke, or yellowysshe drawynge to dymine
                        •
                      &amp; aygre in sauour. And the blode stewmatyke is thycke and gleymy / and whyte in colour, and swete in 
                        •
                     auour / and the blode where as is moche water betokeneth that the pacyent was a good drynker / or that his reynes

be feble and weyke. And that that is graueyllous, and of coloure and substaunce of asshes / betokeneth that he is a lazar / &amp; the blode blacke and asshy is yll, &amp; betokeneth corrupcyon of humours / and dysposycyon to feuers and appostumes / and euyl pustule &amp; blaynes. And yt which is thycke / and the skynne ouer stronge, so yt scantly it wyll breke / sygnyfyeth disposycyon to opilacions. And ye blode that hath the coloure of greas and blode, sygnyfyeth coldnesse, or ouer great heate and adustyon. Of the which thou shalt knowe the dyfference by the behauyng of the body. And the blode that can nat congele, signifyeth that he is waxen colde and 
                        •
                     nnatural. And that that congeleth in competent tyme, as in halfe an houre, sygnyfyeth that he is naturall. And of all these maners and sygnyfycacyons it is very good for the Cyrurgyen to cal the Dhysycyens bycause of parfyte knowledge.

Wher of ought ventoses to be made? Answere. After Albucrasis they be made of thre thynges. Some of hornes, some of glasse, and some of brasse. ¶Demaunde. Howe many fourmes is there for to vse ventoses / and what is theyr effectes? Answere. Some be with garsynge / and other without scaryfycacyon. Those that be done without scaryfycacyon draweth the mater out felyng, and ye other contraryly. ¶Demaunde. What dyfference is betwene euacuacions done by blode lettynge, by ventosynge, and by snayles blode sowkers? Answere. The moste dyfference is of blode lettynge / for it draweth the blode deper than the boxynge or the snayles / and the snayles deper than the ventoses / whiche proprely draweth but betwene the skynne and the flesshe. And therfore Auycen sayeth yt they purge more the thynne blode than the thycke / and more the vpperest than the nether. ¶Demaunde. For howe many and for what intencyons are ventoses appli

and some ꝑtyculer. The generall is made to clense sensybly / and haue the place of a blode lettynge / whan blode lettynge dare nat be done for dyners thynges that letteth blode lettyng, as in a chylde of .xiiij. yere olde, &amp; in aged folke aboue .lxx. yeres. And for this cause Auycen calleth vētoses curates of ye veynes. The .vij. intencyons wherby the sayde ventoses is applyed, is taken of the places yt they be sette to. The fyrste is to purge the mater of the heade, and the partyes therof / and therfore they are applyed in the nawpe of the necke, and kepeth the place of the cephalyke bledynge. And therfore they be good for the dyseases of the eyes, to the infections of the face, and stynkynge of the mouth. The seconde intencyon is for to clense the spyrytual maters / and therfore they must be applied betwene the shuldres / &amp; kepeth the meane for blode

                     ostumes, and dolour of the lyuer of the reynes, and scabbes of all the body. The fourth intencion is that it is applied in the myddes of the arme, for the ache &amp; paynes of the parties therof. The fyfth intencyon is for that it is applyed in the myddes of the thyghes and the legges nygh to the ancles,

and applyed there is in the stede of the blode lettynge of the sophynes / and therfore they prouoke the floures to women / and causeth them to pysse, and easeth the paynes of the matryce and the bladder, and cōfereth to the gowte of the fete &amp; euyll sores. ¶Demaunde. For howe many / and for what intencyons the ventoses applyed without scarificacyon? Answere. But for one generall intencyon / and for .xi. partyculers. The intencyon general is for to drawe, and the particulers do vary after the places that they be applyed to. The fyrste place is vpon the ypocondres to reduce &amp; dyuert the blode of the nosethrylles after Galyen in the fyfth of his Terapentyke sayenge that whan the ryght nosethryll doth blede, for to staunche it ye ventose must be applyed vpon the lyuer / and whan one bledeth at the left nosethryll it must be applyed on ye mylt. The seconde place where they be applyed is vnder the brestes for to staunche and dyuerte the floures of women, as Ypocras sayth in ye fyfth of his affo, and as Galyen declareth in the begynnynge. The thyrde place where they ought to be applyed is on the interyour parte of the heade for to reyse the euela / &amp; to staunche the rewme. For to drawe the depe mater outwarde as Galyen declareth in the xiij. boke of his Terapentycke / and for that cause they be often applyed vpon ye appostumes that be in the clensyng places / the which Auycen hyddeth to be drawen out as moche as maye be. Lykewyse they be applyed for ye same cause vpon ye thyghes / 

for to prouoke floures in women. And also nyghe to the appostumes of the ioyntes / to wtdrawe &amp; deffende that the sayde appostumes do nat brede / and to put ferof the humours fro ye sayde ioyntes. The fourth place to apply them is vpon the bredyng of synewes, in palsy, for to heat them as Auycen sayeth in the thyrde boke of his Canon in the Chaptour of palsy. And Galyen in the thyrde boke of ye interyours, where as he proueth agaynst Archygenes that the brayne is pryncyple and begynnynge of the vertue anymall. The fyfth place to apply ventoses is vpon the bely in colyke passyon, for to resolue and vnuapen the vētosire, and cease the payne. The .vj. place is vpon the matryce, and vpon the bowelles for to reduce and withdrawe them to theyr places, as Auycen sayth in his thyrde canon. The .vij. place is vpon the rybbes &amp; lyke bones for to reduce and retourne them in to theyr places, whan they are broken or dysioynted. The. viij. place is vpon the wayes and poores wherby the vryne passeth from the reynes to the bladder / as Auycen sayth in the thyrde boke of his Canon. The .ix. place is vpon the eares &amp; gappes of depē woundes, for to drawe out the fylth or other noyaunce yf there were any. The .x. place is vpon the necke for to enlarge the wayes of the breth and of the meate. The .xj. place to apply ventoses is vpon venymous bytyngꝭ and blaynes to drawe out the thycke venym. ¶Demaunde. Howe ought they to gouerned that must be ventosed before &amp; after it?

Answere. To the fyrste answereth Galyen in the thyrde boke of the cretyke dayes, and the same proueth Albumazer ī his great introductory that the chosen dayes for to applye ventoses is whan the moone is ful &amp; nat in the wane. For as the moone encreaseth in lyghte / lykewyse encreaseth the humours within the body / and as it waneth so descreaseth ye humours &amp; withdrawe them inwarde. And therwith it ought to be an australl day / that is to say hote and moyste / and the ventoses ought to be plyed fro two of the clocke vnto thre. And after ye intencyons of doctours / fyrste ye place ought to be bathed and fomented (whiche shulde be ventosed) with warme water yf the blode be thycke / but yf it be thynne it is nat nede at all, for it shuld be daunger of to moche resolucyon / and that the strength shuld weyken. And it is to note / that neuer scaryfieng ought to be made but fyrst ye must put to the ventose drye, bycause the blode must be drawen or it be voyded. As to the seconde question it is to be noted as is afore spoken that there be two maners of ventoses. Some be of horne / and some of glas. They of horne are applied in suckynge. They of glas with towe put in to the ventose / and fyre in the twoe and layde on the flesshe / than the fyre quencheth where the ventose taketh. Or after Albucrasis / take a lytell candell of waxe and gyue it a lytel stey belowe that it may holde ryght vpon the flesshe, and lyght it, than set on the ventose, and the candell wyll quenche and the ventose

take holde. And the Cyrurgyen oughte with his handes to rubbe all aboute the place to moue the blode to it. As to the thyrde questyon after that ye haue applyed and set to the said ventose by two or thre tymes yf it be nede whan it is taken away ye ought to make certayne scaryfycacyons very depe with the rasour / and than wype and drye the blody place / and than ones agayne set to the ventose as ye dyd before / and kepe it on halfe an houre tyll it be halfe full of blode, and then take it away and

Answere. He must bath and foment the place all about with warme water in such wyse &amp; so longe

that the eyre entre nat. ¶Demaunde. Is it nedefull for to contynue &amp; kepe them longe? Answere. No, specyally aboute the pryncipal membres that are the mynes of strength / for behynde the necke they hurte the mynde / and behynde the shuldres they anoy the herte / &amp; in the ryght ypocondre they noye the lyuer.

action of rupture / for it is greatly suspecte to the pryncipall membres / and therfore it ought nat to be applyed, but yf case be that the pacyente were faynte herted and durst nat abyde the fyre / and in case that ye wolde apply canteres lastly and for to purge / for in suche case the rupture for the payne that it maketh and for the byg scar that it leueth, and in weykynge of ye place is cause of bygger flux of blode. ¶Demaūde. Which is moste profytable to make actual canteres with golde or with yren? Answere. In pryncypall and tendre membres, as the eyes it is better to do it with golde than with yren. Howbeit in other mēbres it is more behoue full to do it with yron as sayth Albu. For the fyre may be better estemed in ye yren than in the golde or in syluer bicause of theyr colours, but yf it were a goldsmyth that is wonte therto. ¶Demaunde. Yf actuall canteres be necessarye, and to whome, and wherwith? Answere, Fyrste they be necessary to conserue helth and to heale diseases, and kepeth the rowme of profytable purgynges, as blode let tynges, and clensynge by medycyns laxatyues, in suche that may nat suffre them. And the rest that remayneth after the purgynges it correcteth in great and stronge dyseases, where as it is wonte to be gyuen.

And for that cause be the cetons &amp; canteres done (behynde the necke,) and in the fontenelles of the lacertes where as one is deuyded from the other) vnder the sayd lacertes a two or thre fyngers fro the ioyntes. The syxth vtylyte that Galyen putteth is to entrebreake, and intercyde the matter. And for that cause are the veynes of the temples canterysed / bycause that the mater rēne nat in to the eyen / and in ruptures that the bowelles shall nat descende, and in the cyrcuyt and next places to wycked sores. And of this vtylyte Arnolde of vylle. maketh an afforysme / where he sayeth yt the rennynge can nat be diuerted nor yssue kyndly / &amp; that his abiden may be cōpetently clensed by canteres.

            AS Galyen wytnesseth it is greate iniury be it done to man or woman to departe &amp; put away theym that be nat infecte wt lepry, nor touched with meselry, &amp; nat beynge lazares. And also it is greate daūger to supporte, haunte, or be with suche as are stryken or dyseased therwith / for it is a contagyous and daū
               gerous malady. And therfore they that ought to iudge and approue them shulde ryght dylygently beholde theym &amp; considre the vnyuoke sygnes and equyuokes also. And nat for one onely token gyue theyr sentences / but by many conuenaunces / and specyally vnyuokes. ¶Fyrste than whan that the approuers come or cal them dyseased to theyr presence for to examyne them, they ought to conforte them with holsome wordes, and tel them that the sayd dysease is penaūce salutary for the saluacion of theyr soules, and byd them to take it pacyently. And that they feare nat to saye the trouth / for yf they were founde lazares it shuld be theyr purgatory in this worlde. For albeit that they were refused of the worlde / yet they were and be chosen of God. &amp;c. And than cause them to swere to say the trouth / and enquyre of them suche thynges as foloweth. ¶Secondly the examyners ought to enquyre

of theym by the prymatyfe causes of lepry. And fyrste enquyre of them yf there were any of his lygnage that he knewe to be lazares / and specyally theyr faders or moders / for by any other of theyr kynred they ought nat to be lazares / but yf it were by some constellacion that influed equally vpon a kynred / and specyally on them that dwelt togyder, and haue one selfe maner of lyuynge / as we se oftentymes by the tyme of pestylence, yf any of a kynred be stryken or enfect / yt also many other as bretherne, and cosyns, or other parentes soone after are stryken, &amp; yet or they haue be borne. For as Auycen sayeth in his seconde treatyse the fyrste son of the fourth of his Canon in the fyrste chapyter of rottennes. The fyrste cause of rottennes is meates / and the nourysshynge that is of euyl qualytees. And for that cause yf a chylde be nourysshed of a woman corrupte and infecte in her humours ought also to be infect. And nat all onely yf the mother be a lepresse / but let vs beholde also yt for the sayd cause by experyence that they beyng conceyu

extendeth of the nature of the thyng wherof they ar dissolued. Than ought ye to enquyre yf he hath had ye company of any lepresse woman. And yf any lazare had medled with her afore hym and lately / bycause of the infect mater and contagyous fylth that she hadde receyued of hym. It is to be noted that a woman is nat so daūgerous to be a lepresse to habyte with a lazare, as it shulde be a man to habyte with a lazarous woman, or with one that hath habited newly wt a lazare. For all infections remayne in the matryce of the woman, vnto the tyme that they be pourged by theyr floures &amp; clensed / whiche a man can nat do, bycause he hath no receptacle where to holde the sayd īmundycytees. ¶Than ye oughte to enquyre of hym yf he hath had the quartayne feuers / and howe longe syth? For howbeit (sayth Auycen in his fyrste fen of the fyrste boke of his Canon) the feuer quartayne delyuereth a man of euyl melancolyke diseases / and wyte yf he hath nat had the emorroydes, and syth whan? Lyke reason / the emorroydes kepeth that he fall nat in to inconuenyence. ¶Than enquyre hym of his dreames / &amp; yf his dremes be nat terryble / and that he seeth blacke thynges, and deuyls / suche dreames betoken the melancolyke humour to haue domynyon wherby he is so enclyned. And wyt of hym how he is wont to lyue / as yf he hath vsed meates with stronge spyce and in great quantyte, and strong wyues, or garlyke, lekes, onyons, and colewortes, olde chese, gotes flesshe, of beares,

of foxes, of mesyl swyne, or salt meates, and of vnclene fysshe all at one table, &amp; yf he haue continued therwith. And also of all maner herbes, and such meates as brenne the blode, and holly consumeth it. Than aske yf he hath had great solycytudes, &amp; chargeable thoughtes that hath dried hym made hym melancolyke. ¶Than ye oughte to beholde and consydre in your selfe of what complexyon he is, aswel naturall as accydentall, for suppose that lepry be a colde disease by incineraciō of humours, yet Auycen sayth, the moste aūcyent cause of lepry is the euyl complexyon of the lyuer that is so hote and drye that it brēneth the blode &amp; melancolyeth it. ¶After yt the pacient hath ben examyned vpon the fyrste causes that dyspose a persone to be a lazare / he oughte to be examyned and approued by the sygnes of lepry aswel equyuocalles as vnyuocalles / and are the sygnes that cōueneth onely in this dysease / and the equyuocal sygnes conueneth them in dyuers maladyes. ¶Of the vnyuocall sygnes.

that alwaye betoken lepry / whan they are all or the moste parte of theym with the equyuocalles as it shall appere / and such sygnes come in lepry by these causes as Auycen sayeth. The fyrste generacyon of lepry is in the entrayles, &amp; for that cause the lunges and lyghtes be hurte / &amp; the pype of the voyce assysteth it, and causeth them to speke as it were in the nose. And for the rotten and corrupte fumes yt mounte vpwarde by the conductes of the brayne, and the heares lessen and fall for defaute of good fedynge.

Howbeit it is not ynoughe to knowe the generalyte of the sayde Methode / but behoueth to be exercyced in all the partyes therof, seynge that in the same is nede (by maner of spekynge) of sondry partyculer Methodes, bycause yt euery kynde of dysease hath his owne Methode. Than that whiche resteth of of the curatyon of vlceres must be perfourmed in this boke, takynge the begynnyng here. ¶Euery vlcere is ey

The other are without the which the sayd vlcere may nat be cured / &amp; of them haue we treated here before. ¶We shall treate in this present boke the dysposycyons which augmenteth the vlcere / in the whiche lyeth double councell of curacyon / that is to wyte, eyther to take the sayde dysposycyons all holly out of the body / or to surmoūt the incōmodite that aboundeth

But yf it be great the vlcere maye nat come to cycatryce vntyll that remedy be put to the sayd disposycyon, wherby we must dylygently consyder what the sayde affeccyons and dysposycyons be / and howe many in nombre, in takynge our begynnyng as is aforsaid. ¶Euery vlcere is be it alone

The fyrste maner haboundeth by the vntemperaunce of the flesshe subiecte. The seconde by the vyce and yll qualyte of the blode gatherynge to it. The thyrde for the ouer great measure and quantyte of the sayd blode. Ought nat the dyuysyon to be made thus? or otherwyse / that is to wyte the cause wherfore some vlceres are stubburne and defycyle to be healed is for the mystemperaunce of ye flesshe vlcerate, or for the gatheryng of humours ¶Yet agayne, the mystempered flesshe ought to be deuysed in two dyfferences. The fyrste is whan the subiect flesshe is out of nature in an onely qualyte. The seconde is whan with the euyl qualyte it hath tumour agaynst nature. ¶The flowyng of humours is dyuyded in two dyfferences, that is to wyte in the qualyte of gatherynge ye humours, &amp; in the quantyte. Somtyme dyuers of the sayde dysposytyons are medled togyther, and somtyme all. But the Methode for to cure thē all togyther ought not to be gyuen but eche one by it selfe. As yf the intemperaunce of the flesshe be drye &amp; fylthy moderate it with bathynge, and wetynge in temperate water. But at all and as many tymes that this remedy shalbe vsed, the ende of the bathynge and wetynge shalbe forth with that the partycle becometh ruddy and ryse in a lumpe. Than sease yt bathynge &amp; moystynge. For yf ye bath it any more ye shall close the humour agayne that was losed out, And so ye shall profyte nothynge. Lyke wyse the moystynge faculte of medycyns ought to be

greater then it is cōmaunded in hole party yf the flesshe be more moyste, than naturall habytude. Ye must haue regarde to the contrary, for the faculte of medycyns ought to be desyceatyfe, and in no wyse to vse any water. But yf ye must wasshe the sore take wyne or posca, that is to saye oxycraton, or the decoction of some sharpe herbe. Lykewyse ye shall coole the pryde of the flesshe that is to hote, and heate that whiche is to colde. ¶Ye shall knowe suche vntemperaunces partly by the colour, and partly by touchynge, and partly by felynge the dyseased. For somtyme they feale great heate in the party, somtyme manyfest coldenes, &amp; delyte them in hote or colde medycyns. And sometyme appereth rednes, and somtyme whytenesse. But it is an impertynent thynge to this worke to dystynke these thynges. In the whiche worke we shewe not the Methode to knowe the affectyons,

suche dysposycyon or affection hath to procede further / there must be had delyberacyon, to knowe yf all the party dyscoloured and hardened vnkyndly ought to be cut, or yf it ought to be cured by longe space of tyme. And without any dowbte in suche case it is necessarye to knowe the pacyentes wyll. For some had leuer to be longe in healynge than to suffre incysyon. And other are redy to endure all thyngꝭ / so that they may be soone healed. ¶Lykewyse here shall be spoken of the curacyon of euyll humours that gathereth in the partes of ye sore places, in as moche, and bycause that it is an humour gnawynge aboute succorosyfe. But in as moche as it is a wycked humour or ouer encreasynge in quantyte / the curynge therof shal be spoken of in his owne place. ¶Than whan the humours that gathereth in the vlcerate partyes is nat very fer of, nor in quantyte, nor qualyte, it behoueth to dyuert &amp; dryue away, that is in restreynyng and to coole the heate of the partyes that are before the sore place. Lyke maner ye must begyn the lygature at the vlcerate party, in ledynge it towarde the hole partye / as Hyppocrates wylleth in the fractour of bones. Also that the salues that are layde to the sayde vlceres must be more vndryeng than they that are layd to a syngle sore. And yf the flux or rēnynge wyll nat stop with salues, seke the cause of the sayde fluxyon, and take it fyrste away. Yf the fluxyon come by weykenes and feblenes of the party that receyueth it, ye sayd weykenes

must be cured. And such curacyon also shall be propre for ye vlcerate party. But yf cause of the sayd fluxyon haboūde eyther by ouer moch blode, or fylthynesse of all the body, or of any of the superyour partyes, ye must fyrst delay the sayd causes. The weykenes of the partye for the which gathereth to moche humour haboundeth holly of the intemperancy. And nat all togyther of intemperancy / wherof foloweth that the vlcerate flesshe is onely intemperate / &amp; nat weyke and feble. And somtyme chaunceth both the one and other, that is, both vntemperate and weyke. For ye great vntemperaunce is cause of the weykenes of payned party. The which vntemperaūcy shal be cured (as it is beforesayd) in coolynge the heate, moystynge the dryth, warmyng the colde, &amp; dryeng the moyst. And yf the place be to colde and moyste togyther / in warmyng and dryenge also togyther. And so of the other vntemperaunces in doynge away euer the qualyte that surmoūteth by his contrary qualyte.

                  o it, neyther any partye, nor any qualyte, it is all parfytely moderate. Contraryly, the thynge that must be taken fro, or somwhat put to it, is nat in a natural estate, wherto is nat possyble to retourne,

but in doynge awaye the excesse, and puttynge to it that it lacketh. ¶In an other place we shall speke of the ouer moche or lacke of ye partyes / but whan any qualyte is ouer excessyue, it is nedefull that the other qualite contrary be ouercome. And that the corrupcyon vntemperaūcy be delayed, in restorynge the sayde qualyte that was ouercome. For in colyng that which was to hote, thou shalt restore that whiche lacketh / and dymynysshe that whiche was to moche haboundant. Thus it is necessarye that the enracyon of the thynges that are put fer fro theyr naturall beynges, by some in temperacy be made by thyngꝭ of contrary vertne. And thus the flesshe / or any party therof wherin is fluxyon bycause of weykenes, ought to be cured in this maner. And whan the intemperaūcy is cured, heale the vlcere. Curynge the temperaūcy as yf it had come without vlcere. By the which thynge it is manyfest that all such curacyon is nat propre to vlcere, but to intemperacy. Lykewyse yf any corrupte fluxyon happen in the vlcerate partyes / as well by ye occasyon of any partycle as of all the body wherto the blode or any yll humours do gather. Fyrste remedy must be had, eyther to the party that is cause of ye fluxyon, or also to al the body. Thus than we shall heale fyrste the varyces that are often ouer the sore place / bycause that anone after we maye heale the soore. Lykewyse in them that haue dysease in the mylte, or of any other notable party. Fyrst it behoueth to cure the sayd partye / 

and than after we shall come to the curacyon of the sore or vlcere / howbeit none of ye curacyons therof is nat propre vnto an vlcere, but to some other affection and dysposycyon, eyther that engendreth vlcere, or that nouryssheth &amp; conserueth it. ¶Nowe it is tyme to make an ende that no straū
                  ge cause (or as it is nowe sayde) the fyrste iudiciall is iudycatryce of curacyon, but the curatyfe iudiciall affection &amp; dysease. But the thynges yt ought to be done particulerly are founde, eyther that the fyrste iudicial sheweth eyther of the nature of the sore party, or of the temperaūce of the ayre / and of other lyke thynges. For to speke bryefly no indycacyon maye be taken of thynges that be nat yet parmanent. But in as moche as for to knowe a dysease that is nat euydent by reason nor by wyt, we ar often constrayned to enquyre of the externe and prymityfe cause. For this occasion the vulgar meneth that the sayde prymytyfe cause is indycatyfe of curacyon, the which is all other. As it appereth clerely that may well &amp; parfytly be knowen. For yf ecchymosis, or vlcere, or erisipclas, or putryfaction, or phlegmone be in any parte, it a superflue thynge to enquyre the effycyent cause of suche 
                     •
                  yseases, but yf it be yet present and remaynynge. 
                     •
                  or in this matter we wyll heale that whiche is done all redy / and shulde prohybyte the effycyent cause to procede any ferther. And yf the sayd effycyent cause which hath produced the effect therof hath no lenger beynge, we shall do away the sayd

effecte. For to do away the cause that is no more / it shulde nat be possyble for vs, whan we wolde do it away, bycause that the curacyon apperteyneth to the thynge present, as prouydence to the thyng to come / but that which we feare nat that it may hurt neyther for the present nor for the cōmynge is out of both the offyces of ye arte, that is to wyt, of curacyon and of prouydence. Wherfore in such a thynge ought to be no serchyng of any iudicial, neyther to cure nor to puruey, but (as sayd is) the knowlege of the prymytyfe and externe cause onely vtyle in the dyseases to vs vnknowen. Neuerthelesse the Empirykes take somtyme the prymytyfe cause as partye of all the cours of the dysease (that is called in Greke syndrome) wherin they haue obserued and experymēted the curacyon / as in them that haue ben hurte with a mad dog, or venymous beastes. Thus doth also some Dogmatystes / which do affyrme to heale such dyseases by experyence onely without racyonall indicion / for they enquyre the cause prymytyfe as partye of all the syndrome, and vnyuersall cours. But the prymytyfe cause serueth nothynge to the indicion of curynge, althoughe it be vtyle to the knowlege of the dysease, to them that haue knowen the nature of venymous beastes by vse and experience, and therof taketh curatyfe indicion. For put the case that I knowe that the venyme of a Scorpyon be of a colde nature. And for that cause as of a colde thynge that I take indicacion of the remedy, howbeit

the case is such that I haue no sygne wherby I do vnderstande that the body is hurte of a scorpyon. It is manyfest yf that I knowe that ye sayd body is hurt with a scorpion that I wold enforce me to warme all the body / and also the party stynged without abydyng for any other experyence in takynge myne indicion of the nature of the thynge. For lyke as we haue shewed in the boke of medycamentes / wherin it behoueth to be exercyted who soeuer wyll take any fruyte of these present cōmentaries. No such faculte can be founde with out experyence. Sothely it shuld be a gyfte of fely

But lykewyse as in all thynges is cōmytted errour, as well by excesse, as by lacke, so is it presētly. For yf they that afferme that the vertues of medicamentes is nat yet knowen / &amp; that after so greate experyence. And the other yt esteme the sayde vertues to be knowen by one experyence

But for this present tyme we wyll say no more, bycause I haue spoken more playnly in ye thyrde boke of temperamentes / aud also in the boke of medycamentes. Neuerthelesse for knowlege of ye diseases some prymytyfe causes are proffytable / but after yt the present dysease is all togyther knowen / than the

cause prymytyfe is totally vnutyle. ¶Nowe haue we abouesayd / that it behoueth nat to medle and confounde both the doctrynes togyther / but the emperyke ought to treate by it selfe / &amp; the rationall also by it selfe. We muste nowe call to mynde (bycause we haue preposed in these present cōmentaryes) to treate all onely the doctryne rationall. Albeit that to some thyngꝭ that we say we do nat adde that them all and absolutely be nat true, but onely after the sentence of the Methodyke secte / howbeit euery one of hymselfe ought to reason it, and for to adde it. And at this present tyme we haue added that any cause externe and prymytyfe is profytable to the indicacion curatyfe / albeit that it serueth well to the knowlege of the dysease. And we confesse that the cause prymytyfe is a party of the syndrome, and of all the emperykes cours is that they cure all dyseases, by reason or by experyence. But in all that we wyll say hereafter it shall nat be necessary to adde suche wordes. ¶Than let vs retourne to oure fyrste purpose in takynge the pryncyple certayne and vndowbtfull / wherof also we haue vsed heretofore / there as we haue sayde that the dysease that requyreth to be cured iugeth the ende wherunto the Cyrurgien ought to entende / and of the same all other indications ben taken / wherby ye maye vnderstande pryncypally of the vlceres, wherof we haue begon to speake, that the sayd indication hath no maner of societe with the cause prymytyfe. For put we the case that any

vlcere be come of a fluxyon in any party than it is manyfest that ye sayd vlcere procedeth of corrupt humours / for nature is wont for to do so in dyseases / whan she purgeth the body she sendeth all the corrupcyon to the skynne / in suche a maner that the sayd skynne is vlcerate / &amp; all the body purged. ¶ What is than the curacyon of suche vlceres? Certaynly as of other vlceres wherin no corrupte affec

But yf the vycyous humour remayned some indication myght be taken of the sayd cause / or otherwyse it shulde be a deafe thynge that yt thynge whiche is no more beynge shulde requyre curacyon

                  hat thynge that belongeth to prouidence, who so wolde be abused with the vocable. The grekes cal it Prophylactice. For ye curation of vlceres eyther beyng onely syngle vlceres, or beyng with holownesse (yf ye esteme and consydre dylygently) is parfyte

in eschewynge and foreseyng the thyngꝭ that may anoy nature. And the sūme in effect when all is done, it is the worke of nature, as is closynge of a sore vlcere / and regeneracyon of flesshe. In the which thynges belongeth all the cure to that parte of the arte medycynall / that is called Prophylactyce in Greke / yt is to say prouydence / although that vulgaryly it hyght, healynge. ¶And therfore this party that is named prouydence is deuyded in to two kyndes. The fyrste is it that doth a way the dysease that is present. And the other wt stādeth the dysease that is nat yet in estate. Thus the yonge leaches vnderstande nat that theyr contencyon and dysputynges is of names. Howebeit that yf they were studyous of thynges / they shuld inuent and knowe that there be two fyrste dyfferences of the functions and actions of medycyne. That is to wyte, eyther to cure &amp; heale the dyseases all redy greuous / or to let and withstāde them that are nat yet present. ¶ Than is there no man but he wyll saye that to cure and to heale is none other thynge / but to do away the diseases all redy present and greuous / be it but that is done in doynge awaye the thynges that do let the worke of nature, or by medycamentes. But prouydence is none other thynge but to let that the sayde dyseases come nat. And certaynly they that by reason &amp; Methode admynyster the arte of medycyne do cure y• vlceres that come afore of corrupt humours / in purgynge the sayde humours / and also in doynge

away the thynges that letteth the worke of nature. And proprely to say these two maners of curyng ar called Prophilactykes in Greke. For they let (as is aforesaid) that the fylthynes engendreth nat at the sore / or ouer moche moyste corruption. It behoueth nat than thus miserably to stryue of the names. But rather it is more conuenyent to gyue some good Methode to cure the vlceres, suche as I haue gyuen (after my iugement) as well in the boke precedent as in this. But I merueyle me moche of the

And after that ye haue made it lyke vnto a fresshe wounde / it must be healed agayne as a bledynge vlcere. And yf the sayd cure profyte in nothyng, ye ought to mytygate thynflāmation / and make all other dylygence. But the vlceres that come to closynge and open agayne in ye actes and outwarde sores / ye ought to heale them, lyke vnto thē wher there is fresshe brennynge. And afterwarde ye ought to lay vpon the sayd vlceres a playster made of mytygant thynges, vntyll that the yre and fyersnesse be abated. After this done ye ought to helpe to dresse the cycatryce. And than that ye make the partyes about it waxe reade / in wrappyng it aboute with a malagme (that is to wyt a salue malactyke) the whiche is made of Mustarde / or with some other medycament that may chaunge the sayd parties, and make them to be the lesse subiecte to dysease. And yf they ceas nat ī this maner / ye ought to haue cure of all the body / in strengthyng it with dyuers exercytacyons, iestynges, and vociferacions, in cōmyttynge them that kepe hym to such thynges. Also by maner of lyuyng, dymynuyng, or augmentyng by degrees / in begynnyng at vomytynge made by Rayfortz. Ye shall also vse whyte Elebore, and all other thynges, wherof we vse in dysseases and dyffycyle to do away that are subiect to

But tell me Thessalus / what is the indicacyon curatyfe taken of olde sores? In good soth I neuer founde curation that was indicate and shewed of the olde vlceres, nor of new, nor also of the tyme in what dysease that it be / but of the affection &amp; dysposycion that I haue purposed to heale.

often to knowlege the dysease at the begynnynge, and it is necessary that the indication be taken of the sayd dysease. But I can nat coniect what may shewe and ensygne the tyme more than the nombre of dayes, but that Thessalus wyll saye that to haue knowledge of such vlceres / we must tary the tyme / but in such a maner he shuld be an ydyot all togyther. That is to wyt, yf he cōfesse openly that of other thynge the indication curatyfe is taken / and of other the knowledge of the dysease. For although that the tyme serueth somwhat to yt dysease / neuerthelesse the indication curatyfe is nat taken of the tyme. But wherof serueth it yf any vlcere be inueterate, to do away that whiche letteth the coition and coalescence, and to renew the place that is payned? For a man inepte yf by a fylthy fluxyon (that the Grekes cal cacoethe) the lyppes are disposed in such or such maner / what shalt thou proffyte yf thou cut it before thou hast prouyded to stop ye fluxyon? That is to wyte / thou shalt make the vlcere wyder than it is / as some do that cure vlceres in the same maner / bycause that as longe as the cause lasteth that before made the vlceres harde and flynty. Other thynge shal nat come of thexcysyon of the sayd vlceres but amplyfycacion. For them that thou cuttest shal be agayne as hard and stony as they were before, albeit that the prudent and wyse Thessalus (God knoweth) hath nat added this word, that is to wyt, that the partye of the vlcere that is stony and harde &amp; vncoloured

ought to be cut, but cōmaūdeth by absolute sentence and diffynytife, that we ought to cut that which letteth the closynge of the vlcere, and renew it, yf he counceled to do away ye causes that let and hyndre the agglutynacyon. And that this reason and maner were antyke I wold nat excuse hym. For it is a precept and cōmaundement almoste of all the auncyent maysters / whiche haue wryten by any reason and Methode of the cure of vlceres that it behoueth to do away the effycyent causes of the said vlceres, lyke as of al other sores,

be the cause, or that the mylte is augmented, or some dysease of the lyuer, or the weykenes of the party greued, the which is none other thynge but a clere and notable vntemperatnes, or euyll and vycyous humour in all the body that the Grekes call Cacochynne. The which is the greatest cause of all them that maye vnproffyte and anoye in the vlceres. As moche also may greue the vlceres the superhaboundaunce of humours egal to the same that the Grekes cal Phethora. ¶Yf Thessalus cō
                  maunde to do awaye euery of these causes aboue sayde, I alowe hym, as he that consenteth and is conformed to the auncyentꝭ. But also yf he be nat of the opynyon that onely the labyes shuld be done away, I say that of many thyngꝭ he hath knowen one alone, which is so euydent that the shepeherdes are nat ygnoraunt therof. For yf a shepeherde sawe the labies of a sore, harde, flynty, wan, and blacke, or of any other notable vyce of colour, he wold haue no dowbte for to cut it. Than for to cut is a redy and easy thynge / but for to heale by medycamentes is a greater thynge / &amp; that requyreth workemanshyp. Neuertheles Thessalus neuer knewe what the labyes are that may be softened by medicamentꝭ. For all confesse that he hath swerued from this party of the arte. And thus (as hym selfe sheweth) it semeth that he had neuer experyence nor rational scyence of any medicamētꝭ, whiche is a manyfest thynge of the boke that he hath made of medycamentes. ¶But to the processe

Is nat that to cure an vlcere as a grene woūde? Than hast thou wryten in vayne / that ye indicacyon to cure caued vlceres is nat closyng, but fyllynge.

For it is necessary that they be nat vynculate / but bycause that the same also be gyuē to Thessalus, and that we passe ouer without so curyous examynacyon.

any dare admynyster any bytter or hote medytament to the partye. For all those medycamentes drawe vnto them from all the body lyke vnto the cucurbitule, that is to say ventose or boxyng. And thus yf thou do nat empty fyrste all the body thou shalt leaue mater of fluxyon to the bytter medycament / which thynge the emperyke confesse / and so do the dogmatistes, &amp; the most auncyent doctours haue estemed it so. For in as moche as Thessalus hath made mencyon of them, it shal be no straunge thynge to cyte and alledge them as wytnesses. That is nat leafull to heale the eye well before all the rest of the heade, nor the heade before all the body. Such was y• sentence of Arystotyll &amp; Plato in the curacyon of dyseases.

To the contrarye, where they haue estemed that it shulde be superflue to recyte, they haue obmysed and left some. ¶Nowe it is well knowen to all after that I holde my peace, that the auncyentes haue well loued shortnes of speche, and pryncypally for that cause.

                   But also partyculerly by the kyndes of euery dysease. For eyther the vycyous humours flowe no more in the sore partye, or els it floweth styll. Yf it flowe no more, it behoueth onely to succour and remedy the party that is payned. That is to wyte yf it appere pale, blacke, or read, it must be scarified and made to blede. Then afterwarde (bycause that I maye vse his wordes) must be layde therupon a sponge more dryer then moyst. I thynke that no persone is ygnoraūt that this partycle (that is to wyte than) hath in this place any strength of denyall, as yf he sayde thus drye and nat moyste. And afterwarde ought to be applyed remedyes dyssyccatyues. And than (yf it be requisyte) for to drawe blode agayne, and forth with after make suche thynges as is abouesayde, vnto the tyme that the helth be all togyther gotten. And yf the lyppes of the vlcere appere harde and stony, they must be cutte, wherof is spoken in this wyse. Yf the vlcere that are cyrculer and roū

Eyther a hoole or halfe a cyrcle accordynge to the length. Also it is wrytten of all tumours that are coniunct with an vlcere how it ought for to be cured, Lykewyse of the varyces / for by the occasyon of them the vlcere is waywarde and rebel to be healed, yf that any humoure of the sayde varyces do

                  rom all the body, he byddeth that all the bodye be purged without takyng of any indicacion of tyme. And for certayne it shuld be a laughyng thynge that so many of dyuers and often contraryes shulde be taken of a cōmunyte. For put the case that any indycyon of tyme be taken / yet fynally it must be sayd what it is, and compryse it in a sūme / as Thessalus doth (nat onely we) whiche hath alway an indycyon of the dysease of the body that is stopped, that is to wyt that it be vnlosed / and another vnlosed of the body to be stopped. Lykewyse in the vlceres, yt that is fylthy requireth to be clensed, that yt is caued to be fylled, that yt is egal to be festred. And that that ouergrowen f

Of the which thynges shal be spoken more playnly hereafter, whan we shall shew that no indicacyon in what dysease soeuer it be nat taken of tyme. Albeit that ye tyme is somtyme sygne

of the dysease. ¶But I fynde agayne a
                     •
                   Hyppocrates, wherof I merueyle of his great dylygence in all other thynges, and chyefly y• he hath nat forgoten yt whiche is pryncypally to be consydered, of the mayster in medicyns touchyng to indicacion. Nat onely in one dysease or two, but in all. That is to wyt the indycacyon yt is taken of the myghtynes of the dysease, which the Methodykes onely haue nat left (whiche is no merueyle) but also dyuers of the racyonalles, &amp; Emperykes althoughe it be in dyuers maners. For when they say yt they haue obserued the euacuacyon of the cours of to moche blode / they confesse manyfestly yt they haue no regarde of other thynges yt appere in the sores for to come to such euacuacyō, which yt I say therfore ye purgacyon is euacuacyon, the which is nat indicate by the cours of to moche flowyng of blode, but also for bycause yt (althoughe yt there be no cours of redoundyng blode) we must somtyme come &amp; haue refuge to the sendyng of blode, in greke called phlebotomy? For when the disease is great, with the force of strengthes there is none but he make phlebotomy, yf he be expert in the workes of the arte. And sothly we se yt the emperykes cōmeth to the sendyng of blode when any is fallen from a hye place. Or when there is any partyes sore brused &amp; hurte wt any wounde thoughe yt the pacyent were hole &amp; sounde before &amp; without superhabundaunce of blode. By the whiche it appereth yt it is nat the redoundyng of blode yt indicateth the phlebotomye,

but it is the myghtynes &amp; vehemency of the dysease, &amp; the force of the strengthes, acceptynge alway children. And by an other reason, as yf a man be hole &amp; sounde &amp; in no wyse hurt &amp; is ful in habundaunce of blode, for all y• it is nat necessary to take his blode from hym. For to some, fastynge may satysfye, to another small eatyng, to another
                     •
                   flux of the wombe, or purgacion, or hauntynge of batthes, to another onely besynes, or habundaunt fretyng may be ynoughe. But the phlebotomye is nat necessary to such folkes, as the emperykes say also. Lykewyse purgacyon is nat cōuenable in the onely habundaunce of vycyous humour. But lyke as the phlebotomye is made eyther for habūdaunce of blode, or for the magnytude &amp; fyersnes of the dysease, also the purgacyon is made for the habundaunce of some other humour, &amp; for the vehemency &amp; force of the dysease. ¶ As touchynge the myssyon of blode we haue treated in another boke, &amp; shall treate hereafter. In this present boke I wyl speke of the purgacyon. For they yt be dyseased desyre it. Nat onely bycause yt it euacueth the superflue humour &amp; noysome, wherwt they be greued, but also to put it out &amp; be clēsed. And for this cause Hyppocrates aswel in his other workes as in yt that he hath wryten of vlceres considereth the vehemency &amp; strength of the dysease to ye indication of purgyng sayth thus. ¶Purgacyon by the bely is profytable to many vlceres, to the woundes of the heade &amp; of the bely, &amp; of the artycles, or also yf

there be daūger of rottēnes in the bone, or where sutares behoueth, or also to gnawyng. Lykewyse to serpent vlceres &amp; other affections yt maketh the vlceres long in healyng. And also where as rollynges must be vsed, in all suche affections behoueth purgacyons. ¶By these wordes it is clerely shewed yt purgacyon is ꝓfytable to all vlceres &amp; woū
                  des, at al &amp; euery tyme yt they are greatest. For in asmoche yt nat onely the sayde affections, but also other be made greuous &amp; great in thre maners. That is to wyt eyther for y• exc
                     •
                  llency &amp; nobylyte of the party, &amp; myghtynes of the dysease, or bycause yt the sayd maladyes &amp; affections are Cacoethe, yt is wycked. Hyppocrates hath made mencyon of all these thynges by them selfes. That is when he sheweth of woundes of the heade, &amp; bely, the dygnyte &amp; excellency of the party yt is hurt. ¶I thynke yt it is manyfest to all yt here must be vnderstande nat onely the inwarde bely, but also the superyour. For in diuiding ye tronke which is betwene the necke &amp; the legges, is two great capacytees. The fyrste is contayned vnder the Thorax. The seconde vnder the fondement, yt is to the mēbrane yt is stretched vnder labdomen, &amp; for certayne ye woū
                  de yt hath perced wtin the Thorax, or wtin the ars hole is very daungerous, pryncipally yf any of the inwarde partyes be woūded. ¶Lykewyse there is but few but he knoweth well yt all woundes of the artycles are Cacoethes and wycked. The whiche thynge the Emperykes vnderstande by onely experyence.

And they yt haue studyed to haue the scyence of the nature of the body, vnderstande it by the nature of ye hurt partyes. For in the synewes and bony places &amp; without flesshe there is daunger of payne, wakyng, &amp; pryuacyon of rest, &amp; also of con

That is to wyte coleryke superfluite, &amp; al other olde vlceres cōmeth of such a cause / wherfore in all ye vlceres aforesaid Hyppocrates cōmaūdeth to purge by ye bely, and folowyng after he addeth these wordes.

But yf the fluxion be stopped all redy, in such wyse yt it is drawen to, &amp; fixed in the membre, it is more expedyent to dryue it out by the next places, seyng that the translacyon &amp; transporte is by ye partyes yt be next it. Seyng also ye thaccesse &amp; actraction of the purgyng medycament is more easy &amp; prompte nere then fer. The which reason belongeth also to another party of ye art, yt is to wyt of yt which treateth of the purgacyon of humoures, as it is well knowen to all, &amp; therfore hereafter it shall be necessary to repete it, and make it all parfyte

For syth it is so yt euery dysease is greuous &amp; fyers in .iij. maners, yt is eyther by precellence &amp; noblenes of ye partye, or for the strength &amp; magnytude of ye affection &amp; dysease or for ye wyckednes &amp; frowardnes of the same, called ī greeke Cacoethia. Hyppocrates hath made mēcyon of all these thyngꝭ where as he spake of purgacyons, but some perchaunce shall say.

Howe than? doth nat Hippocrates perswade somtyme for to drawe the blode for the same causes abouesaid? It semeth yt he cōmaundeth them thus, but in few wordes, &amp; neuertheles nat without demonstracyon, as he is accustomed, &amp; also all the other auncyentes. Thou shalte vnderstande yt it is thus. Fyrste yf thou rede agayne his wordes yt are such. In all vlceres newly made, but yf it be in the bely, it is expedyent yt forth wt it flowe in blode eyther more or lesse. For by yt meane the vlcere shall be lesse greuous by a phlegmon, &amp; also the places yt are about it. ¶ And after these wordes yt be wryten ī his boke of vlceres (yf yu hast mynde of it) yt he hath often proposed it in his other bokes. Howe yt medycyne ought to be īmytatour nat onely of nature, but also to those thyngꝭ yt are ꝓfitable when they come to theyr, ꝓpre &amp; natural flyryng yu shalt clerely vnderstande ye mynde of Hyppocrates, that is, yt blode must be drawen when the woundes are great. For yf it be expedient yt the blode flowe in suche vlceres, &amp; that be nat leten slowe, yu must adde &amp; supply that yt is nedefull. T

Lykewyse yf ye adde to the abouesayd thynges yt Hyppocrates admonysshed to empty the superflue humour, somtyme ye shal vse detraction of blode, yt is when the blode surmounteth. Somtyme ye shal gyue a medycament yt hath vertue to purge ye humours coleryke or melancolyke, or els phleume. Hauyng euer in mynde in all these workes howe none of them is the curacyon of vlceres. In asmoche &amp; as vlcere. But rather of cacomye yt is coniunct wt the vlcere, or of Pletore, or of phlegmon, or of herpes, &amp; other lyke dysposycyon, wtout to forget yt any of the accydentes of the vlcere gyue any force of his propre indication, as magnytude. ¶In the boke afore we haue spoken of vlceres, wherin we haue exposed all the differences of vlceres, how many, &amp; what they be, &amp; what is the indycacyon of eche of them. Howbeit I haue nat spoken in ye sayd boke

howe somtyme to purge is taken of the force &amp; vehemence of the disease, bycause it shuld be to longe demonstracyon. Also in the sayde boke I haue nat conioyned ye cure of al the body wt the vlceres, but I haue wryten it in this present boke, in asmoche as it is good &amp; vtyle for ye thyng proposed. For the parfyte &amp; absolute exposycyon of this kynde of indicacion, which we haue sayd is taken of ye myghtynes &amp; strength of the dysease, shal be also treated of hereafter. Lykewyse of the indication taken of the age, and also of it yt is taken of purging of humours. And lykewyse the indicacion yt is taken of the payned parties shal be parfytly declared in the bokes yt foloweth. For as nowe we haue onely made mencion of the curatyfe indicacion, which may be taken of the nature of the sayde partyes, yt is to wyt of ye temperaunce &amp; substaūce, wtout touching of yt which is taken of the situacyon of the fourme &amp; fygure, of the vtylyte &amp; vsage, &amp; of ye felyng sharp &amp; dull, ¶ Nowe then let vs speke of the sayd indi

At this present tyme we wyl shew ye reason &amp; maner to heale, which is taken of ye situaciō &amp; fygure of the partyes, &amp; than we wyl impose the ende of this fourth boke. ¶For this cause we haue cogitate &amp; inuēted yt we must gyue medicamētꝭ to drynke to hym yt hath his vētricle vlcerate, whiche vulgarily is called ye stomacke, &amp; yf the bulke yt properly is called ye stomacke, yt the grekes cal cesophagus be vlcerate, the sayd medycamentꝭ ought nat to be taken &amp; swalowed at ones, but by lytel &amp; lytell in contynuyng, bycause of the passage, &amp; also of the touchyng there come vtylyte in the vlceres yt are in yt party, &amp; nat for to contayne the sayd medycamentes yt be adherent, as in the vlceres of the ventricle. ¶Lykewyse we haue indicate &amp; shewed by the sytuacyon &amp; fygure of the sayd party yt such medycamentꝭ ought to be made grosser &amp; thycke, &amp; more gleymy &amp; cleuyng, bycause yt the bulke is a passage of the thynges yt is eaten &amp; dronken.

                   are next to ye syege. But of the vlceres yt are in the intestynes vpwarde &amp; thynne, bycause they be ferdest from the syege, &amp; are set in ye myddle situacion, requyre both the two medycyns, yt is to wyt, those yt are receyued by ye mouth, &amp; those be infused and cast out by the syege. ¶Nowe for certayne the cō

And yt we leaue &amp; cast away all contrary thynges. Albeit yt in the vlceres whiche be in the outwarde parties, the vsage of such medycament be nat noysom as is aerugo, aes vstū, &amp; aeris squama &amp; cadmia, &amp; pāpholix cōmonly called thutie, &amp; argenti spuma, yt is litargiri, &amp; ceruse. Such &amp; lyke medycamentꝭ ought nat to be vsed nor admynystred to the vlceres of ye inwarde partyes, of whose nature we haue wryten in the boke of tēperamentes, and in the boke of the symple medycynes. ¶And yf ye wyl bryng ye vlcere to a festre or cleuynge ye ought to chuse tarte meates &amp; gleymy yt haue no maner of erosyon. But yf ye wyll clense the vlcere ye must chuse thynges yt absterge or wasshe moderatly, as rawe hōny, which aboue al thyng is clēsing thus. As touching scarre potions &amp; meates they are cō

                  ion.) ¶The medycyns yt may be taken surely and

without daunger is treated of in the bokes of medicamentes. Neuertheles we wyl say some formulary for the inwarde vlceres such medycamentes are holsome, as hypocistis, &amp; balaustium, yt is the floure of tame pomgarnets, &amp; galla, &amp; malicoriū, y• is the huske or pyl of the pomgarnet, terra samea, et leminū, yt is terra sigillata, &amp; the pyth of Rhus, yt is symac, also the iuce of roses, &amp; achatia, &amp; other lyke, which anoy nat the bowels &amp; inwarde ꝑties. And ye must shew &amp; gyue ye sayd medicamentes wt some decoction of tarte thynges, as decoction of quinces, of lentister, or of the hyghest boughes of rubus, or of vynes burgeons, or grene myrtylles, or wt tarte wyne. ¶It is now manyfest &amp; none is ygnoraūt, yt he must beware of drynkynge of wyne yf there be phlegmon, or els there is no daunger. In lykewyse it is wel knowen &amp; euydent yt the said medycamentꝭ must be prepared &amp; receyued wt the decoctions, &amp; moyste thyngꝭ. Also ye must medle togyther fraga, cauthu, &amp; gēme, chyefly to ye vlceres yt are in the bulke &amp; resophage. Also it was cōmaū

                  ysthmia, but in the vlcere yt is in the sharpe artere called tracheia, the pacyent must be layde vpryght, &amp; kepe the medycament longe tyme in his mouth in losyng all y• muscles yt be in yt place. For in so doynge some parte of the medycament wyll flowe by lytel &amp; lytel in to ye artere sēsibly &amp; manyfestly. As we may know whē the sayd artere is well disposed after the nature of

it, yt somwhat of ye which is dronken rēneth &amp; passeth throughe it. But lykewyse as in helth &amp; good lust it must be kept yt it influe nat to moche, so in it must in dysease for feare yt it engēdre nat ye cough. For as longe as the humoure descendeth in euery parte nygh the tunycles of ye artere as water doth by a wal it exciteth nat ye cough, but yf some thing passe in the myddes of the way of the spert, yt is the ayre, forth wt it bredeth the coughe. All the indicacyons of it is taken of ye situacyon &amp; fourme of the partye. Lykewyse also hūny must be medled in all medicamentes destined &amp; ordeyned to the vlcere of the Thorax &amp; the lunges. For yf ye vse onely tarte medycyns they wyll remayne in ye bely. Thē thynstrument of the dygestyon and distrybucyon of the sayd medycamentꝭ ouer all the body shal be hūny. Also of theyr sodayne passynge as a vehicule, with yt there is hūny it noyeth nat the vlcere. Lyke maner all and as many tymes as there is vlcere in ye bladder &amp; in ye raynes it must be myxed wt the medycamentes of the vlceres, nat wt hūny, but with some dyurytyke medycamentes, yt is such as prouoketh &amp; styrreth to pysse. ¶I thynke that yt is patent &amp; manyfest to euery man, after yt I holde my peace, yt is to wyt yt they can knowe &amp; dyscerne the vlcerate partyes by theyr substaunce, action, vtylyte, position &amp; fygure, the which hath ben shewed playnly in the boke of the sygnes of ye payned partyes, but this is nat now yt tyme to speke of them. ¶I wyll retourne to ye Methode curatyfe, &amp; I say

that nat onely the thyngꝭ abouesaid, but also many other are the indicyons of the fygure, &amp; sytuacyon of the partyes. For ye can nat well &amp; cōmodyously bynde the sore party, but yf fyrste ye haue taken indicacyon eyther of ye fygure, or of the sytuacyon, or of both two togyther. Nor ye can nat set the pype of a clyster ryght wtout such indycacyon. It is also many tymes necessary to make iniectiō of the medycamentes in the bladder by the yerde, wherfore it is no nede to make mencyon here yt totally ye can nat wel vse a syring of bras yt the grekes call Cathering, but yf ye knowe parfytely the posycyon, &amp; fygure of all the bladder. ¶Than in all these thynges it appereth clerely yt the payned place indicateth moche to all the curacyon, but of the ruptions (yt the grekes cal Regmatha) dyuers indicacions are concurraūt to one purpose, &amp; pryncypally ye indicacion yt is taken of ye posicion ought to be examyned. For seynge yt the rupcyons be hyd in the depth of ye body, therfore they requyre other curacions than the vlceres yt appere outwardly, &amp; bycause yt all holly &amp; alway such rupcyons be with ecchymosis or ecchymonia, &amp; somtyme wt contusyon about the broken flesshe, therfore there be dyuers indicacyons curatyues therin, for alway the curatyfe indicacions are correspondent to ye nombre of ye affections &amp; dyseases, which we shal shew more playnly when we speake of phlegmon, howe the dyseases yt are in ye depe places requyreth stronger medycamentꝭ, than they yt be at ye superfluyte

of the body. Than for the least I do thynke for to be manyfest and pacyent, yt it is necessary that the strength of medicamentꝭ yt are mynystred outwarde be resolued &amp; dymysshed when the party yt shuld be holpen &amp; remydyed is hyd in the dypenes of the body, &amp; therfore it behoueth asmoche to intende &amp; augment the vertue of the said medycament, as it shulde be remyssed &amp; dymynysshed in ye depth of the body. Certaynly all acchymosis or ecchymonia indycateth vacuacyon for remedy of ye cure, wherby it hath nede of medycamentꝭ moderatly hote and dry, for they yt dry excessyuely, of trouth do dygest &amp; resolue at ye begynnyng more euydently than they yt be weyke, but also some party of the dysease scyryous, &amp; dyffycyle to heale, we shal speke of it hereaft dylygently, for as now we haue spokē ynough, after as it belongeth to the matter. ¶Of trouth all the medicamentes &amp; oyntmentes, yt moysteth &amp; heteth more then they yt all the grekes call chalastica, yt is to say laxatyfes, also amonge the sayde medycamentes all they yt declyne somwhat to drynesse, neuertheles be nat yet clere nor manifest contraction (they be called syntatica in greke) such medycamentes ben the remedyes of all ecchymosis. But ye must take good hede yt the medycamentes applycate to the ruptions yt are in depenesse of the body haue stronge vertue, and yt they be sourer &amp; digestyfe, yt is resolutyfe. (And for to say sōmaryly) yt such medycamentes to be of greater force &amp; effycace, in asmoch as lecchymosis is ferther of, from

the skynne vnto the depenes of the body. In suche affections &amp; dyseases the vsage of the herte bytuleth, yt is to say ventose shuld nat be inutyle, which is an instrumēt inuented &amp; excogitate of maysters for to make vyolent attraction. ¶And when ecchymosis is all dygested &amp; resolued, than it is parmytted to drye the broken flesshe, moche, &amp; to conioyne it wt lygature, &amp; to do all yt is conuenable to coalesse &amp; close an vlcere togyther. Than yf ecchymosis be soone digested &amp; resolued y• broken flesshe gathereth togither &amp; waxeth playne easyly, but yf the sayde ecchymosis tary longe or it be resolued, moche fylthynes bredeth in it, &amp; occupyeth ye space yt is betwene the labyes or lyppes of the vlcere, so y• the rupciō can nat close, wherfore it foloweth yt all these thynges abouesayd admonyssheth vs for all causes, how smal soeuer they be. For though that some hath had rygour, yt is to say vnegall concussyon of all ye body, or that it hath nat made good concoction, or yt it hath had the feuer, or yt it hath ben ouer weryed or fatygate, anone it shall haue payne in the sayd partye where as the ruption is. For bycause of the sayd ruption haue ben vnyed &amp; nowryssneth togither, but haue alonely ben approched one to another, wherby it foloweth yt a lytell thyng may departe them easyly, &amp; fyll the place wt superflue humour, but what engendreth it in such rupcyons contynually but now ecchymosis, &amp; lyke vnto the fyrste, that is to wyte when y• flesshe was fyrste broken, except yt presētly ecchimosis is made

of more toughe &amp; subtyl corrupcyon, &amp; at y• begynnyng it was made of blode. And herfore now it digesteth &amp; resolueth more easyly thā it dyd at ye begynnynge. And thus that whiche we haue sayd hytherto shall suffyse for the dysputacyon of vlceres. The

               DEare Brethren, and friendly Readers, wee haue here according to the trueth and meaning of the Author, set foorth this needefull and necessarie worke concerning the Anatomie of mans bodie, being collected and gathered by Maister Thomas Vicary, and now by vs the Chirurgions of S. Bartholmewes Hospitall reuiued, corrected, and published. And albeit this treatise bee small in volume, yet in commoditie it is great and profitable. Notwithstanding, if the things therein conteyned be not discreetly and wisely studied and applied, according to the true meaning of the Author, we haue to tell you hereof, that therein is great perrill, because through ignorant practitioners, not knowing the Anatomie, commonly doth ensue death, and separation of soule and bodie. Furthermore, whereas many good and learned men in these our daies, do cease to publish abroade in the English tongue
