            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            The Prologue.
            
               GOOD Chriſten reders, where as of late, in the beginnynge of my writing againſt Frithes booke, I promyſed this order.
            Firſte to ſet forthe by it ſelfe, what maner of ſtate it is, wherin an Heretike leadeth his life.
            Secondarily, what manner of foundation it is, that Frithe bildeth his wycked purpoſe vpon.
            Thirdly, how falſelie he dothe vnderſtande, not onlie the holy ſcripture, but alſo the olde holie Fathers, and auncient Doctours of the Catholike churche.
            Fourthly how crafty, falſe, and fooliſhe, his reaſons, and argumentes are to be founde, yf they be well and truely tried.
            Fiftly, what is to be ſayd againſt his opinion, that one body cannot be in two places at once.
            Sixtlie, that the poſſibilite therof, maie be proued by very good reaſon.
            Ye ſhall vnderſtand, that of this diuiſion, the firſt and ſeconde parte, I haue perfourmed and put foorthe all ready, although but rudely and not in all poynctes euen as I wolde, if my haſt to the reſt, had not ben the greater. But yet ſufficiently, and euen more then enoughe, to ſhowe the due prouſe of ſo much as I thereby did intende. And now therefore, here dothe folowe the thirde

parte, for which, I diſpatched my handes with the more quicker ſpeede of the other two paſte. And that not with out cauſe. For in thys conſiſteth the very chiefe pithe of my principall purpoſe in all the reſte. Which is to make his falſe vnderſtandinge of the olde holye Doctours and 
                  〈◊〉
                trew meanynges playnly to appere. And therefore I wiſhe, all thoſe in eſpeciall, whiche hath mooſt nede therof, to loke well, and wiſely vpon it. And therin to haue no reſpecte vnto me, nor yet to any payne or labour beſtowed of my parte in that behalfe. But to haue good reſpecte only to the trewth, which is and may clerly be founde therin. Whereof I dare ſay, they ſhall not miſſe, if they be of ſuche good wyll, as without whyche, they cannot be ſaued. For if good will, be to vs in all thinges ſo neceſſari, that we can nothing do rightly with out it, how muche more neceſſary is it to be had, aboute the trial of trewth, in ſo weighty and worthy a matter, as is the very reall preſence of the bleſſed body of our Sauiour Chriſt in the holy Sacrament? For to euen by the trewth, of a moſt weighty, &amp; worthy thing, there is alwaies required a moſte pure, and parfit good will. Whiche is neuer mixed with pride, nor vayne glory, neuer infected with diſdayne, nor enuy, neuer yoked with ſtout ſtubbernes, nor obſtinacie, but euer indewed with meekeneſſe and humilite, wyth dew feare of God and charite, with patience and pitie of mannes weaknes and infirmite, for onely to men of that ſorte were, theſe moſte gratious and mercifull promyſes made. 
                  Petite et dabitur vobis, quaerite &amp; inuenietis, pulſate &amp; aperietur vobis.
                That is to ſay. Aſke, and to you it ſhall be geuen, ſeeke, and ye ſhal finde,

knocke and it ſhalbe opened vnto you.
            
            And therfore what is more precious, and more expedient to be had, then the trewth of this holy Sacramēt? wherfore, let him take hede whiche hathe it not. For when ſhall he haue it, yf he wyll not ſo muche as aſke it? when ſhall he fynde it, if he wyll not voucheſafe to ſeeke it? or when ſhall he enter into it, if he wyll not knocke to be let in? The doore is not to be opened, but onely to them that wyll knocke. The thynge is not to be founde, but onely of them that wyll ſeeke. Neyther is it to be graunted, but onely to theym that will aſke. And who doeth aſke for it? who doeth ſeeke after it? or who doeth knocke, to enter into it? In verie deede, none rightlie, none wyſely, nor anie profitably, but onely thoſe, that be of good wyll. Wherfore onelie to them (as I ſayde) thoſe promyſes were made. And therefore it is not enoughe, to reade, to talke, or to reaſon, and queſtion of the matter. But it is muche more to be wayed and conſidered, wyth what maner of wyll, and intente, all that is done. For trueth is a Lady, alwaies of that ſtraingenes, that ſhe wyl not voucheſaufe to ſhowe her amiable face, but onelie to them that be of good will. For yf any other by chaunce fortune ſometyme to ſee her, (ſpecially there, where they haue no luſt or deſyre to meete with her) indeede vnto them, for all her bewtifull countenaunce, ſhe geueth but a lowrynge looke, wyth ſmale occaſion of anie credence. And no maruell whye, for thoſe be they, of whome the Scripture doth ſay.Mat. 13.
            
            They ſee and ſee not, They here and here not.
            And that is not all for lacke of knowledge, but in very

deede for lacke of good will. For as the common ſayinge is.
            Who is ſo blinde as he, that will not ſee.
            Therfore good will (Gentle reders) good wyll is it, whiche dothe bothe aſke and obteyne, ſeeke and fynde, knocke and is harde, and ſo let in. For without that, moſt trew it is, that nothing can ſpeede in thys kynde of thynges. Wherfore this matter, is to be weyed, and pondered therafter. For who dothe not knowe, that readers there be of dyuerſe and ſundry ſortes.
            Wherof ſome wyll ſone conceiue myſlykinge, if they fynde but the matter any thinge longe in readinge, and ſay, it is to tedious. How be it in very deede thoſe be they, of whome men may ſay.
            They are ſone wery of well doninge.
            Some other therbe whiche in reading, falleth ſtrayte into miſlikyng, if they fynde any thinge paſſe their vnder ſtandinge, ſaying it is very darke and to obſcure. And all becauſe, they loue not in ſuch good labour, any while to tarry or longe indure. But of that, they do fyrſte, they will make the laſt, and ſo giue it ouer.
            Some, yf they finde not the matter, ſette out wyth paynted ſpeeche accordinge to theyr pleaſure, ſtreyght, they wyll ſay it is verie groſe, and but rudely dunne, without witte or learninge, and ſo make that an excuſe of theyr miſlikinge.
            Some will miſlike the matter, becauſe of the wryter. And ſome the writer, becauſe of the matter.
            And ſome not eche for other, but euen indifferently bothe together. But what eſtemers, or louers of trewth ſhall we recken all theſe, which wyll thynke it to derelie

bought, with bearing the light burden of a litle tediouſnes? or to paynfully gotten, with the labouring awaye of a litle obſcuritee, and darkenes? or to be the leſſe worthy good acception, for lacke of ſome fyne and curious expreſſion? or to be regarded after the writer.
            And not, as it ought to be, euen after the matter? what eſtemers (I ſaye) or louers of trewth ſhall we recken theſe? how vnworthy of trewth be they, whiche wyll other refuſe it, or ſet the leſſe by it, for theſe cauſes or anie other lyke? ſpecially in ſo great a matter, as thys holy Sacrament is? Wherfore thys muche haue I ſayde, for a louinge warnynge, and a frindly monition, only to them, whiche hath neede therof. Truſtinge, that when this, that foloweth ſhall come to their redynge, they wyll not forget this neceſſary warninge, but well and wiſely will beare it in mynde, and vſe them ſelues accordingly. For otherwiſe, reade they may, but profit they can not. And therfore now good Chriſten readers, becauſe no man is, or can be herein, ſufficient of hym ſelfe, but as the holy Apoſtle dothe ſay.
            ¶Our ſufficiencie is of God, I wyſhe vnto you,2. Cor. 3 as euen to my ſelfe, the perpetuall ſuccour and helpe of that holie Spirit, whiche is the worker and mercifull giuer of euerie good will. To whome wyth the Father, and the Sonne, be honour and glorye now and euer. Amen. ☞ ♣
            
         
         
            
            IT is to be noted that where I dooe not recite the woordes of Frythe, nor any of his allegacions, but that I ſhowe in what leafe of his booke, the reader maie fynde it, ye ſhall vnderſtande, that I meane it of his booke whiche is of the firſt printe, bearinge date Anno Domini 1533. for his booke of any other later prynte (which I haue hearde of and not ſeene) maie chaunce to varie from the fyrſte, in the numbre of leaues. And ſo by reaſon of that, it might peraduenture be thought, that other (I ſaie) not truely of him, or els of the places, where I report him to ſaie, as he dothe. In auoydinge wherof I haue thought it good to geue this knowledge therof before.
         
         
            The argumentes of the chapiters.
            
               THE cauſe, why Frythe doth alledge the olde holie doctours, and ſpecially Saynt Auſten. Cap. 2.
               
               That his falſe vnderſtandynge of Saint Auſtene proued, is ful proofe enough againſt him, in all the reſt of the olde holy fathers beſyde, and of the ſcripture alſo. Cap. 3.
               
               How Fryth doth handle this text, This is my bodie: and Sainct Auſten vpon the ſame. Cap. 4. &amp; 5.
               
               How Frith behaueth him ſelfe in his allegacion of Saint Auſten wrytyng againſt Adamantus. Cap. 6.
               
               What Frithe concludeth of the Sacrament, and what he maketh of Chriſte. Cap. 7.
               
               How frith lieth vpon the plaine litterall ſence of Scripture. Cap. 8.
               
               How Frithe vnder pretence of Engliſhinge Saynt Auſtens woordes, doth therin falſly expounde theim for his owne purpoſe. Cap. 9.
               
               
                  How he lyeth vpon Sayncte Auſtene? and what an argument he maketh betwene this worde, eate, and this texte, This is my bodie. Cap. 10.
               
               That this text, This is my body, hath a litterall ſenſe proued by Saint Auſten directly agaynſt Frithes purpoſe. Cap. 11.
               
               How falſely Frithe dothe vnderſtande this that Sayncte Auſten ſayth, Chriſte bore himſelfe in his owne handes after a certayne manner, and what a certaine maner is. Cap. 12. &amp;, 13.
               
               How Frythe pretendeth to beleue Saynt Auſten, and yet beleueth him not in dede. Cap. 14.
               
               Of the good and perfit agrement of the wordes of Saynt Auſten, where he ſayth, ye ſhall not eate thys body that ye ſee, nor dryncke that bloud whiche they that crucifie me ſhall ſhede out. And where he ſaythe, Chriſte hathe geuen vs the ſame fleſh to eate, wherin he walked here in yerth. Cap. 15.16.
               
               How directly Frithe in apert wordes is agaynſt Chriſte. Cap. 17.
               
               How Frythe deceyued him ſelfe in thys text, what if ye ſee the ſonne of man aſcendynge thyther where he was before: and how he belieth Saynt Auſten vpon the ſame. Cap. 18.
               
               What a parte Frithe playeth with Saynt Auſten in vnderſtandynge of this texte, The fleſhe profiteth nothing. Ca. 19.
               
               That Frithe gathered out of the olde Fathers ſayinges, not theyr meanynges, but his owne foolyſhe dremynges, wherby he deceyued himſelfe and other alſo. Ca. 20
               
               What the ſpirituall vnderſtanding of this matter is. And that Frithe vnderſtode it not. Cap. 21.22.
               
               That it is not euen properly ſpoken to ſaye, that Chriſte hath now a naturall body or naturall fleſhe. Cap. 23.
               
               What ſpirituall vnderſtandynge is, after the mynde of Chriſoſtome. Cap. 24
               
               He that vnderſtandeth Chriſtes fleſhe to be immortall,

and vnderſtandeth nothing in it to the contrary, vnderſtandeth it Spiritually. Cap. 25.
               
               That thoſe whiche are and ſhalbe dampned in Hell and ſo continew for euer, can not for all that, be trewly &amp; properly called immortall. Cap. 26
               
               That there is nothing now in Chriſtes body, that may be ſo vnderſtande, as it is now in our bodies, or was in his, before his reſurrection. Cap. 27. &amp;. 28.
               
               How falſly Frithe dothe vnderſtande thoſe places of S. Auſten, whiche he dothe alledge out of his worke. De Ciuitate dei, libro. 21. Cap. 25. and out of his ſermon (as Frithe dothe note it) De ſacra feria Paſche. 
                  Cap. 29. &amp;. 30
               
               How many maner of wayes the bleſſed body of Chriſte is eaten. And whether it may be properly ſayde, to be any way eaten corporally or not. Cap. 31
               
               Of the difference that is betewne Corpus &amp; Corporale, That is to ſay, betwene a body and a bodely thynge or perteynyng to a body. Cap. 32.
               
               That the Sacrament in reſpect of it ſelfe, is not corpus, that is to ſay, not a body, and yet it is corporall. And that there is no ſuch corporalite in Chriſtes bodie now, as is in ours. Cap. 33
               
               That althoughe the bleſſed body of Chriſte, be of good Catholike men, for dyuerſe good cauſes, called corporall and naturall, yet it is not properly ſo, but ſupernaturall and ſuper corporall. Cap. 34
               
               Whether the quantite of Chriſtes body now, be ſuche as ours is, or whether he hathe his quantite therof, as we haue ours or no. Cap. 35. &amp;. 36
               
               That Frithe dothe not alledge Saynt Auſten vpon certain textes of Scripture euen there, where he goeth euen purpoſely vpon them, but taketh hym in other places, where he toucheth but parte of the ſenſe, to confyrme therby ſuche other matter as he hath in hande. And the cauſe why, that Frithe dothe vſe hym ſo. Cap. 37.
               
               The cauſe why, that Saynt Auſten doth ſome time write more obſcurely to vs, then he doth to heretikes. Cap. 38
               
               
                  That, not only the very reall eatinge of Chriſtes bleſſed body in the holy Sacrament, whiche is generall, but alſo the ſpirituall eating of it whiche is ſpeciall, is proued by Saynt Auſten. Cap. 39.
               
               That Frithe by Saynt Auſten is conuinced in this, that he wolde haue none other eating of Chriſtes very body but only ſpirituall, whiche he meaneth to be nothyng els in effecte, but onlie to beleue that Chriſt died for vs. Cap. 40. &amp;. 41.
               
               That if Frithes fayth were trew, the ordinance of man in the Roode, ſhuld be better then the ordinance of chriſt in the Sacrament. Cap. 42.
               
               What a falſe parte Frithe playeth with Saynt Ambroſe, and of the cauſe why. And what he ſeyth of Belaſius. Cap. 43. &amp;. 44.
               
               What falſe diſſimulation Frithe vſeth in the ſayinges of the olde holy fathers. And how directly he is therin ageynſt hym ſelfe. Cap. 45
               
               That this worde ſubſtance, and alſo this worde nature, are taken and vſed eache of them very diuerſly. Cap. 46.

And therfore euen now am I cum, only for that purpoſe and nothyng els.

               Nothyng els, but as I tolde you at the firſt, that if wold diſpleaſe a great ſorte, if it came to their heringe, as it doth now in deede.
            
            
               CATH.
               And did not I then tel the againe, that it could diſpleaſe none, but onely ſuche, as woulde other kepe their grefe therof ſecretly to them ſelues, or els in their diſcloſinge therof vnto other, ſhow them ſelues what they be.
            
            
               HERE.
               Ye but yet for all that, it goeth farder then ſo. For beſyde thoſe, whom ye meane, it doth not pleaſe ſome other, whiche are (as ye counte them) euen both wiſe, and alſo learned.
            
            
               CATH.
               That maie chaunce to be trew, how be it, althoughe it dothe not pleaſe them, yet is it enoughe to me, that

it doothe not diſpleaſe them.
            
            
               HERE.
               It muſte needes diſpleaſe them, when it doth not pleaſe them,
            
            
               CATHOLICVS.
               That foloweth not. For it is two thinges to diſpleaſe, and to not pleaſe althoughe they ſeme and be ſome tyme vſed and taken for bothe one. For not pleaſe, is properlie but as it were a meane betwene pleaſe, and diſpleaſe. As it maie wel apeere by the diuerſitee of thinges, wherof ſome dothe pleaſe, and therin they gender delight. And ſome doth diſpleaſe, and therin they gender greefe. And ſome be indifferent, and they do nother of them bothe, that is to ſay, nother pleaſe nor diſpleaſe. And therfore, of that ſorte I take my labour to bee, to them that be learned and wyſe. For althoughe it be harde for them to be pleaſed with that, whiche they coulde dooe farre better them ſelues, yet their wiſdome and learnynge, will not ſuffer them to be diſpleaſed with that, whiche holdeth the trewth, and refelleth the contrary, although not ſo aptly as they coulde frame it. Wherfore mine intencion therin, was not ſo muche, to pleaſe thoſe of learnyng which be wiſe, and of my helpe hath no neede, as it was to helpe thoſe ignoraunte heades, whiche for lacke of grace and learnyng bothe, are not ſo wiſe, and therfore of helpe, hath verie great neede. And this, thoſe learned whiche be wiſe, doth wey and conſider well enoughe: Beyng (as alway they are) more willyng to ſet forward the trewth with their good pacience, then to burt or hinder it, with any diſpraiſe or great miſlikinge, of my ſimple handlyng therof. And therfore tell not me of any diſpleſure taken with al, but only among ſuch, as I tolde thee of before.
            
            
               HERE.
               Well ſir, yet I woulde

               Thow doeſt no leſſe. For who hath done or ſaid ſo, yt he hath therein diſpleaſed no man? I dare ſay, not the holy apoſtles, nor our Sauiour Chriſte him ſelfe nother.

                  No not ſo. But yet, althoughe I haue not forgotten it my ſelfe, I doubt for all that, whether thou doeſt ſo well remember it, as the truthe therof doth requyre.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Yes ſir that I do, for your ſaiyng was this, that ye coulde, and wold proue, that Iohn Fryth did falſly vnderſtande, both the Scrypture, and alſo the olde holy Doctours to. And

farther more, that his reaſons were and are, but deceaueable ſophiſticacions, and nothing els.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  Trew it is. That was my ſaiyng in deede. And for the perfourmaunce therof (whiche is the cauſe of our meetinge here now) thou ſhalt vnderſtande, that he dothe not alledge thoſe holy doctours, for any thynge more, then for the proofe and confirmaciō of his owne intellection, and vnderſtandyng of thoſe Scriptures, whiche he woulde haue vs beleue, doth make for his purpoſe. And therfore, when I ſhal proue his vnderſtandynge of thoſe holy doctours to be vtterly falſe, and far from their meanyng in deede, ſhal not that be a ſufficient proofe, that other they make directly againſt hym, or els at the leaſt, nothyng for him? And therfore if they make nothynge for him, why dooeth he alledge them? If they make againſt him, is not alſo that, euen proofe enough, of his falſe vnderſtandynge of Scripture, whiche he woulde defende by them? when his ſaiynge is ye, and their menyng naie? Except thou wilt ſaie, that he is more credible then all they, when he neuer thought ſo him ſelfe: For if he had, he woulde not haue brought them in, for his wytneſſe as he dooeth.

                  CATH.
                  With that am I well contente. And therfore now to drawe neare vnto it, thou muſt (for a more compendious breuitee of the matter) farther conſyder, that as he bringeth the olde holie doctours for nothinge ſo muche, as (if it would bee) to confirme his falſe vnderſtandynge of Scripture, ſo he bringeth none of them all ſauynge one, but to confirme his falſe vnderſtandynge of that ſame one, whom he taketh

onely to be enough for his purpoſe. Wherfore if I proue him falſe in his vnderſtandynge of that one, it muſt needes folow, that he is therin proued falſe in his vnderſtandynge of all the reſt.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Ye but which one of them is that?

                  If thou wilte needes knowe, it is euen holy Saint Auſten.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  And how know you, that be bryngeth in, all the reſt of the holy doctours, onely to confyrme his vnderſtanding of Saint Auſten? or that he vnderſtandeth Saynt Auſten falſely, as ye ſay he dooth.
               
            
            
               Cap. 3.
               
                  CATH.
                  I will recite vnto thee ſome of his owne ſaiyng, and by that, thou maieſt perceiue how I know it. For in the 30 leafe of his booke, he thinkyng, or feinyng, that he hath his purpoſe proued by S. Auſten, doth ſay theſe woordes.
                  
                     This were proofe enough (ſaith he) to conclude, that all the olde fathers did hold the ſame opinion. For who wold once ſurmiſe (ſeyng we haue S. Auſten ſo plaine for vs, which is the chiefeſt amonge them al, who wold once ſurmiſe (I ſay) that he diſſented in this great matter, from the other faithfull fathers, or they from him? Neuertheleſſe, I dare not let him ſtande poſt alone, leaſt ye diſpiſe him. And therfore I will ſhew you the mynde of certeine other alſo. And alſo of his maiſter Saint Ambroſe. &amp;c.
                  
                  In theſe woordes of his, it appereth playne, and much worthy to be noted, that he doth not only brynge the olde holy fathers to confyrme his vnderſtandynge of Saint Auſten, but alſo that, (to fortifie the ſame) he would haue no man, ſo much as once ſurmiſe, that S. Auſten in this great matter, diſſented from other the faithful fathers,

nor they from him, as I graunt al that to be trew in deede. But what a ſurmiſe is this of him, that (as he ſaith) he dare not let Saint Auſten ſtande poſt alone, leſt we wold deſpiſe him, if he ſhoulde not bringe forth the minde of the other faithfull fathers to defende him? where tooke he any occaſion thus to ſurmiſe, but only of his owne arrogant fooliſhe head, to make ignorant perſons beleue, that this holy man S. Auſten maketh clerely for him in his wicked purpoſe? as in the .29. leafe of his booke, he boſteth in plaine words, which are theſe, Bleſſed be god (ſaith he) which hath ſo cleerely diſcuſſed this matter by this faithfull father.
                  
                  Now, leſt thou woldeſt ſay or thynke, that this ſame arrogant ſurmiſe of his, proceded not, but (as many a man doth ſome tyme ſpeake) raſhly by chaunce, here him in the .24. leafe of his booke, where he hath theſe woordes.
                  
                     Now were this enough (ſaith he) for a chriſten man that loued no contencion. But becauſe there are ſo many ſophiſters in the worlde, which care not what they ſay, ſo they holde not theyr peace, I muſte needes ſet ſome bulwarke by this holie doctour, to helpe to defende him. For els they will ſhortly ouer runne him (as they do me) and make him an heretyke to. Therfore I will allege his maiſter Saint Ambroſe. &amp;c.
                  
                  How ſaiſt thou now? who can declare his malicious and arrogant blindneſſe, ſo fully as he declareth it him ſelfe? for what a malicious blindneſſe, is this of him, thus to ſurmiſe any nede to defende Saint Auſten againſt vs, as thoughe we would not allowe him? Therfore when it may here, of his owne woordes appere, that he bringeth not in, the reſt of all thoſe faithfull fathers, for any neede he hath of them, but to defende Saynt

Auſten, whom he ſayth, is proufe enough for his purpoſe becauſe he diſſenteth not from them, nor they from hym, it muſt needes folow, that if Frithe be founde falſe in his vnderſtandynge of Saynt Auſten, he ſhalbe therin founde falſe in his vnderſtanding of them all, and of the ſcripture to, when they do al agree (as he doth confeſſe) and herin diſſent not one from another. Wherefore what neede I, to trauell aboute the triall of his falſhed any farther, but in Saynt Auſten only?

                  Marry ſyr his principall purpoſe is thys, to proue, that Chriſtes very body fleſh and bloude, is not really, verely, and preſently in the ſacrament. And to begin his proufe wyth all, hys owne wordes in the .21. leafe of his booke are theſe.
                  
                     Except I brynge (he ſayeth) euydent Scripture, whiche they all ſhall expounde as I doe, I deſyer not to be beleeued.

                  In very deede, thou ſayeſt euen trewth. For it is ſo reſonable, that I wolde to God, al his folowers wolde aſſent vnto it, and graunt him no leſſe. But I feare that manie of them, graunted hym ſuche a requeſt at the fyrſte, that they wil now deny him this at the laſt. And therefore as touching his bringing of euident Scripture, and his expoſicion of the ſame, This that I finde in the. 6.

leafe of his booke, is muche to be noted, where his wordes be theſe.
                  
                     In euery text (he ſaythe) is but only one verite, for which it was ſpoken.
                  
                  And alſo agayne, in the .18. leafe he hath theſe wordes.
Some textes of Scripture (he ſayth) are only to be vnderſtande after the letter, and ſome textes are only to be vnderſtande ſpiritually, or in the way of an allegory. And, ſome muſt be vnderſtande both litterally and ſpiritually.
                  
                  Here we may fyrſt aſke of hym, how he wyll proue, that ſome text muſt be vnderſtande bothe literally and ſpiritually, if it haue in it (as he ſayth it hath) but only one veritee? for onlie one veritee in one text, to haue two ſundry vnderſtandynges, and bothe trew, is verye ſtraynge, and that more ſtrainge, then may well agree wyth reaſon, or trewth other. Agayne we maye aſke of hym alſo, why ſhould any one text haue any mo vnderſtandinges in it, then any other hathe, if it haue in it but only one verite, as thoſe other hathe, which he ſayth are onlie to be vnderſtande after the letter, or only ſpirituallye? very repugnant it is, to ſay (as he dothe) that in euery texte is but only one veritee, for whiche it was ſpoken, and to ſay, ſome text muſt be vndeſtande both litterally and ſpiritually, wherof the one vnderſtanding or the other, can not be trew, if the text haue in it but onlie one veritee (as he ſaythe) it hath. Neuertheleſſe, vpon this phantaſy of his, euen there dothe he conclude with theſe wordes.
                  
                     And I ſay (ſayeth he) that this text of ſcripture, This is my bodie, is only ſpiritually to be vnderſtand, &amp; not litterally.
                  
                  How ſayeſt thou to this? doeſt thou perceyue what he ſaieth?

                     And that doth ſaynt Auſten (ſayeth he) alſo confirme, whiche writeth vnto Adamantus, and ſayeth, Theſe ſentenſes of Scripture, Chriſt was the ſtone, the bloud is the ſoule, and thys is my bodie, are figuratiuely to be vnderſtande, (that is to ſay ſpiritually, or by the way of an allegory) and thus haue I Saynt Auſten wholie of my ſyde whiche thynge ſhall yet herafter more playnly appere.

                  I ſay this, that Frithe doth herin but reporte Saynt Auſten thys to ſaye. And dothe not alledge where, nor yet perchance recite Saint Auſtens owne wordes, in ſuch order and forme, as he dothe ſpeake them him ſelfe nother. Wherfore Frith is herein to be rather miſtruſted, then beleeued. And beſyde that, theſe words which he hym ſelfe doth here reporte of Saynt Auſten, dothe leaue this text (This is my body) ſo muche at large, as to be vnderſtande litterallie, as well as figuratiuely. And doth not dryue it to this narrow ſtreyght of only figuratiuely, as Frithe wolde wraſte and wringe it vnto: for figuratyuely, and only figuratiuely, doth very muche differ. Becauſe, with the one, there may ſtande an other, but with the other, no more but it ſelfe alone. It is two thinges to ſay, that our Sauiour chriſt is a man, and to ſay that he is only a man. For the one is ſayd trewly, and the other is a damnable hereſy. Wherefore as he that ſayth Chriſte is

to be vnderſtande a very man, and yet taketh him not therin to be only a man, nor denieth him to be very god. Euen ſo S. Auſten whiche doth ſay, that this text, This is my body, is to be vnderſtande figuratiuely, dothe not therin ſay or meane it to be vnderſtande only figuratyuely. Nor denieth it to be vnderſtande litterally. For althoughe a thinge be trewly ſayde to be ſo or ſo. Yet that draweth not with it this conſequence to be only ſo. But Frith dothe reaſon the matter after this ſorte, as if he ſhould heere a man reported, to be learned in Aſtronomie, he will ſtreyght conclude, that the man can no ſkyll of Phiſike nor Geometry, but only of Aſtronomy. When for al that report, he may be, as diuerſe ar, lerned: ſome in two, and ſome in all three. Therfore of this kinde of concluſions, I hope thou ſeeſt enoughe. Wherefore, how can Saynt Auſten (whome Frithe hym ſelfe, doth here report, to ſay none otherwiſe of this texte (This is my boddy) but that it is to be vnderſtande figuratiuely, make any thinge for him, in this that he ſayth it is to be vnderſtande only figuratiuely and not litterally? when the wordes reported of Saint Auſten maketh no farther mention, but of the one, and not of the other. And yet, without putting any difference betwene fyguratyuely, and only figuratiuely, or bringing for hym any dew allegation of Saynt Auſtens owne words where, or in what order he ſpake them him ſelfe, the blinde arrogant foole is not here a ſhamed to boſte and ſay, that he hath herein Saynt Auſten, wholy of his ſide. Who doth here nothing touche any parte of hys purpoſe.

Here (ſaith he) Saint Auſten ſaith plainly, that Chriſt called the ſigne of his bodie, his body. And in this chapter doeth compare theſe thre textes of Scripture, This is my boddy, The blood is the ſoule. And Chriſt was the ſtone. &amp; declareth them to be on phraſe, and to be expounded after one faſhion.

                  I ſay, that S. Auſten, ſaith not here, ſo plainly, that Chriſt called the ſigne of his body, his body, as Frith doth here plainly belie him in ſo reportyng of him. For S. Auſten, hath here no ſuch woords, as can be wreſted vnto that ſenſe. For is it all one to ſay, that the lord doubted not to ſay, This is my body, when he gaue a ſigne of his body. And to ſay, that he called the ſigne of his body, his body? As if I ley my hand flat vpō an heape of fyne ſande, ſaiyng, this is my hande, will it followe thereof, that I call the ſigne of my hande, my hande? which ſigne I make in the ſande, by layinge my hande therupon? how be it this conſequence is not ſo ſtrainge, as it is common with frith: Therfore as he lyeth falſly vpon S. Auſten in this, ſo he dothe likewiſe in the reſt, for Saint Auſten maketh no ſuche compariſon there, of

                  Becauſe it is ſo. For diddeſt thou not thy ſelfe recite vnto me right now, that Frith ſaieth, Saint Auſten doothe wryte to Adamantus this ſame that he nowe gathereth herein for his defence?

But what is it to hys purpoſe of improuynge or diſprouinge the reall preſence of Chriſtes very body in the holy Sacrament? or wherof doth this concluſion folow? of this, that he ſayth, there is no man ſo mad, as to ſay that Chriſte was a naturall ſtone, is he ſo mad, as wolde haue it follow thereof?
               
               
                  HERE.
                  No not ſo.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  Wherof then?
               
               
                  HERE.
                  He doth meane, that as Chriſt was called a ſtone, and was not a naturall ſtone indeede, ſo the Sacrament is called his body, and is not his naturall body indeede nother?
               
               
                  CATH.
                  Well, this graunted, what is it to the purpoſe of the very preſēce of Chriſtes bleſſed body in the ſacrament? for that is it, whiche he goeth about, with all he can to diſproue? will it folow that Chriſtes bleſſed body is not really and verely in the Sacrament, becauſe the Sacrament in reſpect of it ſelf, is not his natural body? The queſtion lieth vpon in, or not in. And Frith concludeth vpon is, or is not. As if I ſaye, my booke is in the Churche, he will proue the contrary by thys, that the Church, is not my booke. Therfore becauſe the churche is not my booke, is it not thereby well proued thinkeſt thou, that my booke is not in the Churche? becauſe we

ſay, as the trewth is, that the very body of chriſt is in the ſacrament, he wil proue the contrary by this, that the ſacrament is not his very body. Plucke out of his booke, all thoſe concluſions, that he of this forte, and truſt me trewlie, thou ſhalt therin leaue but few or none behynde. For it is common with him, to make his aſſertion of one thinge, and his concluſion of an other.
                  Whiche is good enoughe, to ſuch raſhe, light, wilfull, and ignorant heddes, as can no ſkill of the matter. For when they finde this, (his nedleſſe probation) trew, that the ſacrament is not the very body of Chriſte (as it is not indeede, in the bare reſpecte of it ſelfe) they take what ſo euer he ſayeth beſide, to be ſufficientlie proued in the ſame. For well knew he, that the moſte parte, are farre from the knowledge and conſideration of the diſtinction and difference, that is betwene the Sacrament and the thinge of the Sacrament. Whereof the olde holy Fathers dothe ſay.
                  
                     
                        Aliud eſt Sacramentum, &amp; aliud res Sacramenti.
                     
                  
                  That is to ſaye.
                  
                     The Sacrament is one thynge. And the thynge of the Sacrament is an other.
                  
                  And therfore becauſe the one ſomtime beareth the names of bothe, that is to ſay, the name of it ſelfe as it is, and alſo the name of the other, not as it ſelfe is, but as it is called, for good cauſe why, he thought, that as the Sacrament is called Chriſtes body, and yet is not hys very bodie indeede, ſo he thought as thou ſaydeſt before, that his body is ſayd to be therin, and yet is not verelye therin indeede. Wherfore as he thought the trew proufe of the one, ſhoulde be enough to colour hys falſe pretended

proufe of the other, ſo with the trewth of the ſame one, he wolde take away, not only the trewth of the other but alſo our verie profit of them bothe together. But whether he ſaw this muche him ſelfe or no, I can not perfitly tell. But of thys am I ſure, that his folowers ſeeth it not, for if they dyd, they wolde not all, (I ſuppoſe) do as they do. And therfore when he ſayth (as thou haſt recited) that there is no man ſo madde, as to ſay, that Chriſte was a naturall ſtone, except he be a naturall foole, I wolde haue them all, for the truſte they haue in him, tell me how muche more, then a mad naturall foole was he to ſaye, that it is not dampnable ſo to thinke? which is farre worſe, then ſo to ſay? for parchāce in ſome caſe, it may ſometym
                        •
                      ſo be ſayd, when in no caſe, at any time, it may ſo be thought, but moſt dampnably.
               
               
                  HE.
                  Ye but I pray you ſyr, where dothe Fryth ſo ſay?
               
               
                  CATH.
                  Doſt thou not know, that in the .59. leafe of his booke, he ſpeaking of his belefe in the Sacramente, hath theſe wordes?
                  
                     The beleuing of this poinct (he ſayeth) is of it ſelf not damnable, as it is not dampnable to thinke, that Chriſte is a verie ſtone or a vine.
                  
                  Theſe wordes thou ſeeſt are plaine enough. For what difference is there betwene a very ſtone and a naturall ſtone, but vtterly none at all. And therfore what wicked wretche hath there bene harde of, ſo curſed that euer ſpake anie ſuche thinge of our Sauiour Chriſte? for what foloweth therof but this, that it is not dampnable to thinke Chriſte to be worſe, or not ſo good, as a dog? for a Dog in the dew order and dignitee of nature, is far better then a ſtone or a Vyne other. For a ſtone hath

but a bare being without any life at all, where as a vine hath ſo muche, and a vegetable life alſo. But a Dogge hath not only beynge, as well as a ſtone, and a vegetable life, as well as a Vyne, but alſo a ſenſible lyfe, whych is farre paſſing them bothe. Wherfore, excepte thou be of that wilfull blindnes, whiche will ſay, as no man els wil that no life is better then life. Or a vegetable life, better then a ſenſible life, thou muſt needes graunte a Dog farre better then a very ſtone, or a vyne other. Therfore what ſoeuer is thought to be a very ſtone or a vine, muſt needes be thought to be worſe, or not ſo good as a Dog. But thys wicked kaytiſe, ſayth it is not dampnable, to thynke that Chryſte is a verie ſtone or a vyne. Wherefore it doeth, and muſt needes folow thereof, that it is not dampnable to thynke that our Sauiour Chryſte is worſe, or not ſo good as a Dogge. O what a thyng is thys of hym, but ſuche an vnſpeakable curſednes, as neuer was, nor yet is, to be harde of, if a man myght choſe? But it is wyth hym, as the Goſpell dooeth ſaye.
                  
                     
                        Exabundantia cordis os loquitur,
                      That to ſay.
                  
                     Of the ſtore of the harte, the mouthe dothe ſpeake.
                  
                  Therfore how cam this into his harte, but thoroughe the mooſte cruell ſubtill and wily blaſte of the father of liars, and conſequently the father of all Heretykes?
                  How was it otherwiſe poſſible for hym this to ſay, but by that meane? And yet that, not withoute the holye permyſſion of Goddes inſcrutable prouidence, to the great and wonderfull ſhame of all thoſe, that foloweth this curſed kaytyues opinion. To their ſhame, I ſaie, that euer they ſhoulde be of ſuche a wilfull blyndnes,

and therby ſo infortunat, as to be the folowers of ſuche a dampnable lyinge leader. And yet in this, their ineuitable ſhame, is offred vnto them (if they wyl take it) a wonderfull occaſion of obteynyng the great mercie of God agayne. For what greater occaſion of their returne vnto trewth againe, can they haue or imagin, then this theyr notable ſhame of folowing him, whoſe moſte dampnable error is ſo great, and alſo manifeſt, that they them ſelfes are not able to defende, nor excuſe it? It is none excuſe that ſome of them dothe make, ſayinge that Frithe might ſo ſay in ſome reſpect. For in what reſpect may anie man thynke, but dampnablie, that Chriſt is a very ſtone? Who ſo euer thinketh him a very ſtone, can therin thinke him no better thinge. For a very ſtone, of him that ſo taketh it; can be thought no better then a verie ſtone, of what ſorte or kinde ſo euer it be. Therfore, Frithe being found the authour of ſuch a doctrine, what neede we anie farther trial of him, other in the holy ſcripture, or in the holy doctours other, when we haue ſuche a proufe of him, as this, his moſte curſed ſaying is, that it is not dampnable to thinke that Chriſt is a very ſtone or a vyne? who wolde truſt him in anie thinge els. Sithe we haue founde his falſehed ſo abominable in this?

                  Becauſe the other without theſe, was enoughe to declare, what a blinde malicious Heretike he was: but yet neuertheleſſe (ſithe thou goeſt ſo farre) I will ſaye now more then I ſayde before. For this brother of liers, was ſo ſet a worke by the father of liers, that where as he lied before, but vpon Saynte Auſten, for to colour the falſhed of his owne purpoſe, now here, for a farther cloke of the ſame, he lyeth alſo vpon the holy Scripture, whiche he falſely taketh to witneſſe. For where fyndeth he any litterall ſence, ye or myſticall ſence other, in all holy Scripture, that ſayth, it is not damnable to thinke that Chriſt is a very ſtone.

                  Loe here ye miſſevnderſtand him agayne, &amp; take it far otherwiſe, then he dothe meane, for he doth meane, that the litteral ſenſe doth ſay it is not damnable ſo to thinke, but he doth meane, that

the litterall ſence doth ſay, that Chriſt is a very ſtone, &amp; therfore he him ſelf ſayth it is not dampnable to thinke that Chriſt is ſo.

                  Althoughe there be a difference to ſay a ſtone was Chriſte, and to ſay (as Frith doth) a very ſtone was Chriſte, or Chriſte a verie ſtone, yet here, why more a ſtone was Chriſte, Then the ſtone was Chriſt?
               
               
                  HERE.
                  That is all one.

                  Ye amonge Heretikes. For I thinke your tergiuerſations, be neuer to ſeeke. For is it all one to ſay (a ſtone) and to ſay, the ſtone? when the one, is ſo generall, that it may be vnderſtand of any ſtone. And the other ſo ſpeciall, that it maketh relation to ſome certen ſtone, mentioned before or after? And therefore it is not all one to ſay. The ſtone was Chriſte and to ſay, A ſtone was Chriſt. For in ſignification (The) and (A) dothe here muche differ. Wherfore Frith dothe falſely Engliſhe the litterall ſenſe (whiche is) the ſtone was Chriſte, with this that he ſayth, a ſtone was Chriſt.1. cor. 10 For the one maketh playne relatiō to the ſpirituall ſtone expreſſelie mencioned of the Apoſtle him ſelf immediatly before, &amp; ſo doth not the other. Moreouer frithes falſhed herin reſteth not thus, but goeth farther &amp; addeth vnto it this worde (very) ſaying chriſt is a very ſtone. Putting away by yt word veri, al ambiguite of ſenſe, that might riſe of this word a ſtone. Therfore he ſaying a very ſtone, what litteral ſenſe in the ſcripture can there be founde,

that ſo ſayth of Chriſte? Or what is there to be ſayd for Frith herin, but that thou muſt needes confeſſe him a verie manifeſt liar, and that vpon the litteral ſence of holy Scripture?
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Although there be no litteral ſenſe that ſo ſayth of the ſtone, yet the litterall ſence ſayth, euen ſo of the Vine, ſayinge,
                  
                     
                        Iohn̄. 15
                     Ego ſum vitis vaera. That is to ſay, I am a very vyne.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  What maketh that for Frith? For althoughe the litterall ſenſe be ſo, of the Vyne, yet it is not ſo, of the ſtone. Neuertheleſſe Frithe ſpeaketh it of the ſtone, and not of the vyne. For he ſayth.
                  
                     It is not dampnable to thinke, that Chriſt is a very ſtone, or a vyne.
                  
                  And ſayth not a very vine.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Yet ye may there perceiue by this worde (or) that he ment the ſame worde (very) of the vine, which he ſpeaketh of the ſtone.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  Then, why doeth he, but only meane it, without any expreſſion of it, where it is. And expreſſeth it, ſo playnly, where it is not?
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Becauſe it may be vnderſtande of the ſtone, as it is expreſſed of the vine.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  That is falſe. For although the litterall ſenſe dothe ſay in the one place, a very vine, yet it nother dothe, nor can ſay, in the other place, a verie ſtone.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Why ſo?
               
               
                  CATH.
                  Becauſe the ſtone there, hath in it conteyned a perticuler reſpect to that, whiche goeth before. And ſo hath not the vine, whiche is ſpoken in ſuche a generalitee, that it hath no reſpecte to any one vyne, more then to another. And therefore by this it may well appere, that falſely doth Frithe bring in, theſe two textes, of the ſtone, and the vine, to be one phraſe of ſpeache, without any difference. How be

it, that dooth he, onely to thentent he myght there withall, wringe in, this text, This is my bodie, to be lykewyſe of the ſame forte, and of one maner of ſpeeche.
                  Which hath from them both, a farre greatter difference, then they haue eache from other, whiche is not ſmall nother, when the one can not be trewly engliſhed with this article (A) ſeying a ſtone, nor the other with this woorde (The) ſeying the vyne. But in thoſe places (A) is proper to the vine, and (the) to the ſtone. As the very trew and perfite ſence of the letter in both places, doeth of neceſſitee requyre. Wherfore, thus maieſt thou ſee, how well Frith hath quyt him ſelfe, in his vnderſtandinge of the ſcripture hitherto, and of S. Auſten both.

In ſo much, that for a farther proofe of his vnderſtandyng of this text, This is my bodie, he doth in the 22. leafe of his booke, alledge Saynt Auſten againe, in theſe woordes.

be taken figuratiuelye, that is, it is a phraſe, allegory, and maner of ſpeakyng, and muſte be vnderſtande ſpiritually, and not after the letter. Except (ſaith Chriſte) ye eate the fleſhe of the ſonne of man, and drynke his blood, ye ſhall not haue lyfe in you. He ſemeth (ſaith S. Auſten) to command a foule and a wicked thynge. It is therfore a figure commaundyng vs to be partakers of his paſſion, and ſweetely and profitably to prynte in our minde, that his fleſhe was crucified and wounded for vs.

That is to ſay.
                  
                     If the Scripture ſeme to commaunde an euill or a wicked thinge, or forbid a profite or a good thinge, it is a figuratiue ſpeache. Except ye eate (he ſaith) the fleſſhe of the ſonne of man and drynke his blood, ye ſhall not haue lyfe in you. Therfore it is a figure commaundinge vs to be partakers of his paſſion, and ſwetely and profitably to prynt in our memorie, that his fleſhe was cruſified and wounded for vs.
                  
                  Here thou maieſt now perceiue plaine that Fryth hath not ſo many latine woordꝭ, in his allegacion of S.

Auſten, as I haue in myne, and yet I haue fewer Engliſſhe woordes in myne, then he hath in his, by a great ſorte.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  How cummeth that to paſſe?
               
               
                  CATH.
                  Not without a falſhed of his parte, if thou marke it well. For where theſe fewe latyne woordes of S. Auſtens, Figurata loquutio eſt, are no more to ſay, but (as I haue ſayd) it is a figuratiue ſpeeche, Fryth doth Englyſhe them after this ſorte, ſaiyng.
                  
                     Then muſt that text he taken figuratiuely, that is, it is a phraſe, allegorie, and maner of ſpeakynge, and muſte be vnderſtande ſpiritually and not after the letter.
                  
                  Haſt thou harde of any trew man, that wolde, or truly coulde, ſo turne thoſe latine woordes into Engliſhe as he doth? Doeſt thou not ſee, how his wily falſhed doth here, vnder pretence and colour of Engliſhinge S. Auſtens woordes, brynge in nothyng els, but his owne falſe phantaſticall expoſicion of them, to make his diſciples beleue and thinke, that Saint Auſtens meanyng, was but accordyng to this, his owne falſe feynynge? what woordes hath Saynt Auſten here, that may be wreſted to this, whiche this falſe lyar doth ſay, it muſt be vnderſtande ſpiritually and not after the letter?
                  where fyndeth he this ſame, not after the letter? therin lyeth all the matter, And thereof here ſpeaketh S. Auſten nothinge at all. For he ſaith no more, but that this texte.
                  
                     Excepte ye eate the fliſhe of the ſonne of man, and drinke his blood, ye ſhall not haue lyfe in yow.
                  
                  Is a figuratiue ſpeache. And dooeth not ſaye, onely figuratiue, or not litterall, as this marchaunt doothe beare vs in hande, and woulde make vs beleue

that he dooth.

                  Yet ſir, if it bee a figuratius ſpeche, then muſt it be vnderſtand figuratiuely.

                  That is trew.

                  Therfore if it muſt he vnderſtand figuratiuely, then it may not be vnderſtand litterally.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  That foloweth not. For Fryth him ſelfe doth graunt and ſay, (as I tolde the before) that ſome texts muſt be vnderſtand both figuratiuely, and alſo litterally. And therfore why may not this, which Frith ſpeaketh of, be one of them? as it may indeed, for any thing that Saint Auſten ſaith here to the contrary? And yet as though S. Auſten had ſaid the contrary, (as he doth not) this falſe Raynard is not aſhamed to knit vp the knot with theſe woordes.
                  
                     This trewth (ſaith he) thankes he to god, doth Saint Auſten declare vnto vs. which thinge beſyde the openynge of this text, againſt maiſter Woores minde, doth plainly ſhow, what he thought in the woords of Chriſtes ſupper.
                  
                  Whiche is no more to ſay, but that thoſe woordes maie not be vnderſtande after the letter, becauſe here, Saint Auſten telleth vs nothing of that matter, whether they may or not. Therfore doth not Saint Auſten declare this trewth vnto vs very well, when he ſpeaketh nothing of it?
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Sir, if it might be vnderſtande, both figuratiuely and alſo litterally to, S. Auſten wold not haue made mention (as he dooth) of the one ſenſe, and not of the other.

                  How knoweſt thou that?

                  It is moſt like ſo?

                  Ye to Frith. And therfore that is enough to him, to conclude ſo falſely therof as he doth. But thou muſte vnderſtande, that it was not Saint Auſtens minde there to ſpeake of any of them both, that is to ſaye, nother of the one ſenſe, nor of the other, but as it chaunſed the one and

&amp; not the other, to ſerue his purpoſe for example of that he had in hande, whiche was to geue a rule, whereby a figuratiue ſpeach in the ſcripture might be knowen.
                  And not to diſcuſſe how or whether that text might bee litterally vnderſtande or not. And therefore, graunt this to be trew, which Fryth doeth here ſay that Saint Auſten.
                  
                     Dothe plainly ſhow, what he thought in thoſe woordes of chriſtes ſupper.
                  
                  Yet it foloweth not thereof, that he dooth ſhowe all, that he thought therin. For it is two thinges to ſhow what he thought, and to ſhowe all that he thought.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Marry ſyr that is trew, but Fryth, for the openynge thereof, dooeth alledge him agayne in theſe woordes.

                  Nay ſofte I praie thee, let vs fyrſte here what Frithe fayth more of this place, whiche he hath here alledged all ready, before we go anye farther. For he hath yet ſhowed vs almoſt nothyng, what he gathereth of it, after his owne mynde, but onely his falſe expoſicion thereof, brought in (as I ſayde) vnder the colour of Engliſhyng of Saint Auſtens woordes.
                  Therfore let me here what he ſaith farther of it him ſelfe, without any cloke or colour at all.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  That ſhall ye do. For immediately after this his ſaiyng, that S. Auſten doth plainly ſhow, what he thought in the woordes of Chriſtes ſupper, he addeth vnto it theſe woordes.
                  
                     For ſith he called it (ſaith Frith) a foule and a wicked thing

to eate his fleſhe, then may you ſoone perceiue, that he thought it as foule and as wicked a thinge, to eate his body, ſeyng his bodie is fleſhe. And then conſequently it ſhall folow, that other this woord, eate (where Chriſte ſaide, take this and eate it) muſt be taken ſpiritually, or els that this ſaiyng of Chriſte. This is my body, muſte be figuratiuely ſpoken. But this woorde, eate, is taken after the letter (for they did in deede eate the bread) therfore it muſt needes folow, that this ſentence (This is my body) muſt be figuratiuely ſpoken.
                  
                  Now haue you hearde what he ſaieth and gathereth of it him ſelfe.

                  Than ſaiyſt trew. And therfore ſhall I neede to byd thee marke his falſe lye, that he maketh here agayne of Saint Auſten? For doth Saint Auſten call it a fowle and a wicked thynge (as this lyar ſayth he doothe, when he ſayth no more but that the ſcripture therin ſeemeth to commaunde an euyll or a wicked thyng? Saint Auſten nother calleth it ſo him ſelfe, nor yet doth ſay, that the ſcripture calleth it, or commaundeth it ſo nother. He ſaith the ſcripture ſo mech to commaunde ſuche a thynge. And doth not ſay, the ſcripture doth commaunde it. But in deede to commaunde, and ſeme to commaunde, to call, and ſeme to cal, or to be, &amp; ſeeme to be, is all one with Frith. As who ſay there is nothing otherwyſe then it ſemeth to be, nor any thyng ſemeth to be, otherwiſe then it is.
               
               
                  HE.
                  Sir ye can not auoyde his argument ſo.

                  His argument? what is that?

                  Ye haue harde how he dooeth ſay, that
                  
                     Either this word eate (which Chriſt ſaid, take this &amp; rate it) muſt be taken ſpiritually, or els that this ſaiynge of Chriſt, This is my bodi, muſt be figuratiuely ſpoken. But this woorde 
                           •
                        ate (ſaith he) is taken after the letter, for they

did (he ſaieth) eate the bread, therfore it muſt needes folow that this ſentence (This is my body) muſt be fyguratiuely ſpoken.
                  
               
               
                  CATHOLICVS.
                  I meruayle where Frythe learned this kynde of argumente, whiche can brynge forth ſuch a woorthy concluſion. For dooth it not properly folow, that this ſentence (This is my body) muſte be figuratiuely taken, becauſe (as he ſaith) this woorde eate, is taken after the letter? And this he doothe but ſay, without any proofe at all.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  That is not ſo. For he dooth proue, that this woorde (Eate) is taken after the letter?
               
               
                  CATH.
                  That is but a parte of it, and yet (for all thy ſaiyng) he proueth not that nother.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Yes, he proueth it by this, that (as he ſaith) they did eate the bread.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  Ye but that I denye. For without queſtion they dyd eate that, which they were byd to eate, whereof, it was to them ſayde, Take eate, This is my body, whiche ſhalbe geuen for you. And that was not breade, except thou wilt ſay, that bread was geuen for their redempcion. And therfore, where he ſaith, that this woorde bread, is taken after the letter, And therof would haue it folow, that this ſentence, This is my body muſte be figuratiuely ſpoken, I aſke him why figuratiuely, more then lytterally, or why fyguratiuelie, and not rather litterally? For if the woorde of eatynge, he taken after the letter, dooth it not thereof muche better folowe that the woordes of that whiche is eaten, ſhulde be taken after the latter likewiſe? To take the woord of eatynge, in a litteral ſence and therfore the woordes of the thyng eaten, is a figuratiue ſence is more ſtrange then I can ſkil of.

Yet the one (ſaieth he) muſt needes folow the other. But by what reaſon, although no man can tell, yet to ſuch as will needes beleue him, it is good enough, although it be neuer ſo falſe and fooliſhe to any man els.
                  And therefore ſith it appereth in the .47. leafe of his booke that he taketh not the eatynge of Chriſtes body, but onely for the beleuynge in him, I aſke him, why may not this woord (Eate) be taken ſpiritually, as well as this text, This is my body, be ſpoken figuratiuely? or why may not the ſame text be taked litterally, as wel as this woorde (Eate) be taken after the letter, ſith theſ be ſo ioyned together?
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Becauſe there is a great difference betwene them.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  Ye that is, as Frith woulde haue vs take them, but not as our ſauiour Chriſte in the vnitee of ſence and ſentence together doth ioyne them. For there is no doubte, but the meanynge of this woorde Eate, and alſo the meanynge of this ſame ſaiynge of Chriſte, This is my bodye, are bothe together of him ſo inſeperably kint and conteyned in this one ſentence.

                     Except ye eate the fleſhe of the ſonne of man, and drynke his blood, ye ſhall not haue life in you.
                  
                  That they both maketh one perfit ſentence and ſence, whether thou take it to be litterall or ſpirituall. And therfore by this one leſſon aforeſayde, it maye well appere, that they can not ſo differ in ſence, but that they muſte other be bothe ſpirituall, and not literall, or bothe litterall and not ſpirituall, or els bothe not onely ſpirituall, but alſo lytterall, Wherefore, Frythe can not ſaye, that they be bothe ſpirituall and not litterall, becauſe he ſayeth 
                        •
                     he an
                        •

them, that is to ſaie, this woorde Eate, is taken after the letter. Againe, he can not ſay, that they are both litterall, and not ſpirituall, becauſe he dothe both holde and ſay, that the other which is, This is my body, muſt be taken figuratiuely, that is to ſay ſpiritually. And therfore it muſt needes folow, that they be bothe, not only ſpirituall, but alſo litterall.

For my fleſhe is very meat and my bloud is very drinke. The ſpiritual vnderſtanding ſaueth him that beleueth, for the letter killeth, but the ſpirit quickeneth.

But .iiii. or .v. lines before, cleane to an other purpoſe, then Frith wolde here make vs beleue, that Saynt Auſten ſpeketh them for.

                  What ſo euer thou wilt tell, I tell thee, that vpon the title of the ſayde .33. Pſalme, S. Auſten ſpeaking there of the prophet dauid, as the ſtory compelleth him to do, doth ſay theſe wordes.
                  
                     
                     Et ferebatur in manibus ſuis. Hoc vero fratres quomodo poſſit fieri in homine quis intelligat? Quis enim portatur in manibus ſuis? Manibus aliorum poteſt portari homo. Manibus ſuis nemo portatur. Quo modo intelligatur in ipſo Dauid ſecundum literam, non inuenimus. In Chriſto autem inuenimus. Ferebatur enim Chriſtus in manibus ſuis. Quando commē

                           •
                        . Hoc eſt corpus meū. Ferebat enim illud corpus in manibus ſuis.
                  
                  That is to ſaye.
                  
                     He was borne in his own handes. But brethern how this may be done in a man, who can vnderſtande? for who is borne in his owne hands? A man may be borne in the handes of other. But in his owne handes no man is borne.
                     How it may be vnderſtande in Dauid hym ſelfe after the letter, we do not finde. But we finde it in Chriſte. For Chriſte was borne in his owne handes, when he ſetting furth the ſame his owne bodie ſayth, this is my bodie. For he bore that bodie in his owne handes.
                  
                  Here it can not be auoyded, but euen by Saynt Auſten, theſe wordes of Chriſte. This is my body, muſt needes haue a litterall ſenſe.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  That is not ſo. For althoughe Saynt Auſten, dothe here ſay, that chriſt was borne in his owne handes, when he ſayde, This is my body, yet it foloweth not, but that he mente he bare hym ſelfe in his own handes figuratiuely, and (as Frith ſayeth) not litterally or after the letter.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  A, wilt thou be there? dothe not Saint Auſten here playnly ſay, that he findeth the ſame in Chriſte, whiche he findeth not in Dauid? And this (he ſayeth) he findeth not in Dauid, how it may be vnderſtande that he was borne in his owne handes after the letter. Wherfore it muſt needes

folow, that he findeth how it may be vnderſtand in chriſt that he was borne in his owne handes after the letter, when he ſayd, This is my body. And therevpon dothe Saynt Auſten reſt. For otherwiſe, he myght haue founde it in Dauid, but (as he ſayeth) not after the letter. And therfore after the letter he fyndeth it in Chiſte. Now therefore tell me where is Frithes denyall of this litterall ſenſe becum, ſithe he is therin, thus cleane ouer throwne, and that by the playne woordes of Saynt Auſten hym ſelfe, whome he falſelye boſteth to make ſo muche and clerely for hym? when the trewth is, he maketh directlie agaynſt him.

                     The text of Saynt Auſten (ſayth he) whiche they there alledged againſt me was this, that in the Sacrament, chriſt was borne in his owne handes, where vnto I ſayde, that Saynt Auſten doth full well expounde him ſelfe. For in an other place he ſayth. Ferebatur tanquam in manibus ſuis. That is, he was borne after a certayne maner in his owne handes. And by that he ſayth after a certayne maner, ye may ſone parceyue what he meaneth.
                  
                  Now haue ye harde what Frithe ſayeth of Saynt Auſten agayne.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  Thou ſayeſt trewth. And thereby doo I well perceyue him to folow more that, whiche he hath in thys poynte harde of Saynt auſten by other, then that, whiche he hath ſeene of ſaynt Auſten him ſelfe. And that appereth not only by this, that he maketh here no mention of anie ſpeciall place of Saynt Auſten, where thoſe wordes ſhould be, but alſo by this, that in the place, where I haue redde Saynt Auſten concerninge the ſame. That is to ſay, vpon the title of the .33 Pſalme, hys very wordes be theſe.
                  
                     Ferebatur in manibus ſuis. Quomodo ferebatur in manibus ſuis? quia cum commendaret ipſum corpus ſuū &amp; ſanguinem ſuum, accepit in manus ſuas, quod norunt fideles, et ipſe ſe portabat quodammodo eum diceret. Hoc eſt corpus meum.
That is to ſay.
                  
                     He was borne in his owne handes. Now was he borne in his owne handes? becauſe when he did ſet furth the ſame his owne bodie, and his bloud, he tooke that into his handes, whiche the faythfull doeth know. And he bore hym ſelfe after a certayne maner, when he ſayde, this is my bodie.
                  
                  Theſe be the woordes of Saynt Auſten in that place whyche I haue red. And althoughe it be no greate matter, yet there is no ſuche, tanquam in manibus

ſuis, as Frithe dothe here ſpeake of. Therefore if he him ſelfe ſaw and red this place of Saynt Auſten, and wolde not (as he dothe not) alledge the woordes of it as they be, iudge thou what a parte he playeth in that.
                  Of the other ſide, if he ſaw them not hym ſelf in S. Auſten, but tooke them (as I beleue he did) oute of ſome heretikes booke, to colour his falſe purpoſe with al, how fooliſh was he to thinke, that it wolde neuer be ſpied?
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Syr all this, is but a voyde draught. For in the wordes whiche ye do here recite of Saynt Auſten your ſelfe, appereth enoughe for Frithes purpoſe, and as muche as he requireth.

                  This that Saynt Auſten ſayth.
                  
                     Chryſte bore hym ſelfe in his owne handes after a certayn maner, when he ſayd, thys is my body.
                  
                  For by thys that he ſayth after a certayne manner, ye may ſone perceyue (ſayeth Frythe) what he meaneth.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  O after a certayne maner? indeede it is to vs after a certayne maner, that Frithe doeth alway make his concluſion, vpon an incertayne grounde, althoughe it be to him, aftter his common maner. For what is the cauſe that he doth not firſt make it certaine, what Saynt Auſten meaneth by this, that he ſayth, after a certayne maner?
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Frithe ſayeth ye may perceaue what he meaneth.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  Ye, we maye, and do, but yet why dothe not Frithe expreſſe the meaning of it, leaſt he take it one way, and we an other?
               
               
                  HERE.
                  He doeth expreſſe it in the ſame place immediatlie folowynge, and that in theſe wordes, ſayinge.
                  
                     
                     How be it, if Saynt Auſten had not thus expounded hym ſelfe, yet he ſayth, Ad bonifacium, that the Sacrament of a thynge hath a ſimilitude of the thynge, whiche it ſignifieth. And for that cauſe, it hath many tymes, the name of the very thynge whiche it ſignifieth. And ſo he ſayeth, that he bore him ſelfe, becauſe he bore the Sacrament of his body and bloud.
                  
               
               
                  CATH.
                  And wel ſayd. Is this the bering of himſelf in his owne hands after ye certaine maner, which S. Auſten meaneth, to beare the ſimilitude or ſacramēt of him ſelf in his owne handes?
               
               
                  HE.
                  What els?
               
               
                  CAT.
                  Then, where is the bering of him ſelf in his owne hands after the letter? S. Auſten ſaith (as I ſayd before) he bare him ſelf in his owne handes after the letter. But to bere the ſimilitude or ſacrament of him ſelf in hys owne handes, is not to bere him ſelf in his owne handes after the letter. For there, the letter maketh no mention of any ſimilitude or ſacrament other. Wherfore if S. Auſten had mente by this that he ſayeth, after a certayne maner, none other but that Chriſte bore the ſimilitude of hym ſelfe, in hys owne handes, when he ſayd, This is my body, he myght ſone haue founde, how that might haue bene as wel vnderſtanded in Dauid, as in Chriſt. Therfore it was not that, whiche he ment, when he ſayd, he founde not howe it might be vnderſtand in Dauid after the letter. For Dauyd might haue borne the ſimilitude of hym ſelfe in hys owns handes. Wherfore thys that Saynt Auſten ſayeth, Chriſte bare hym ſelfe in hys owne handes, after a certayne maner, can be no expoſition (as Frithe wolde haue it to be) of thys that he ſayeth, Chryſte bore hym ſelfe in hys owne handes after the letter. Nor no more, can this nother, that he ſayeth.
                  
                     
                     Sacramentes haue a certaine ſimilitude of thoſe things, whereof they are ſacramentes, and ofte tymes of that ſimilitude take the names of the thynges them ſelues.
                  
                  When the letter (as I ſayde) maketh there no mencion of any ſimilitude or ſacrament other.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Then if this that Saint Auſten ſaith, Chriſte bore him ſelfe in his owne handes after a certaine maner, can be no expoſicion of this that he ſaith, Chriſte bore him ſelfe in his owne handes after the letter, doubtles thoſe two ſaiynges can not be bothe trew nor ſtand together.

                  CATH.
                  If thou or Frith other, take S. Auſten after that maner, doubtles ye are both deceiued in him, after a wicked maner. For what is after a certaine maner, but not after a commune maner?Luc. 14. As when our ſauiour Chriſte appeered vnto certaine of his diſciples in the way goyng to Emaus after his reſurrection, either he appeered vnto them after his common maner, or els after a certaine maner. If he had apeered vnto them after his common maner, they had then knowne, it had bene he, whiche (as the goſpell doth ſey) they did not in deede. Wherefore he apeered vnto them, not after his common maner, but after a certayne maner, whiche was ſuche, as by reaſon whereof, they knew him not, as it doth there, right well apeere. Againe of the other ſyde, his apparence alſo vnto them then, was other after the letter, or els not after the letter. If thou ſaie it was not after the letter, then thou denyeſt both his very beyng with them then, and alſo the letter to, whiche doth ſay.
                  
                     
                     Ieſus him ſelfe drawinge nere, went with them.
                  
                  Therefore if thou ſay that he apeered vnto them after the letter (as the trewth is, he did in deede) then thou muſt needes grant, that he apered vnto them there, not after a common maner, but bothe after a certayne maner, and alſo after the letter to, and that bothe at once. And why therefore ſaieſt thou, that Saynt Auſtens ſaiynge of Chriſtes bearyng him ſelfe, in his owne handes after the letter, and his ſaiynge that he bore him ſelfe in his owne handes after a certaine maner, can not ſtand together, when thou maieſt thus perceiue that after the letter, and after a certayne maner, doothe well agree and ſtande together, in the goſpell?

                  Yet ſyr me thynke by you, that after the letter, and after a certayne maner, are not bothe one, but haue ſome difference betweene them.
               
               
                  CATHOLICVS.
                  Trew it is. How be it no ſuche, but that they maie and dooe ſtande together well enoughe. For after the letter, is here ſayde, in reſpect of the very reall and eſſenciall beyng of his ſubſtaunce. And after a certayne maner, is ſayde in reſpect of the ſtraunge forme, wherein he apeered vnto them.
               
               
                  HERETICVS.
                  Ye but when he bore him ſelfe in his owne handes (as Sainte Auſten ſaith) after a certaine maner, there was no ſuch ſtrange forme appeerynge then.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  Yes euen ſo ſtrange, as when he by the way ſhewed him ſelfe to the two diſciples. For then he ſhewed him ſelfe in the forme of a mā whiche fourme coulde not be ſtraunge, but wel known,

in that reſpect, what it was. Therfore the ſtraungnes was not in that, but in this, that he ſhewed him ſelfe in the fourme of an other maner of man, whiche was no man in deede, but he him ſelfe ſo in it, as though he had not beene therein. And therfore the fourme is ſayde to be ſtrainge, becauſe it was of him ſo ſtranigly vſed. Wherefore lykewyſe, when he bore hym ſelfe in his owne handes after a certayne maner, he bore him ſelfe in the fourme of bread, whiche fourme, to anie man coulde not bee ſtraunge, but well knowen what it was. Therfore the ſtraingneſſe was not in that, but it was in this, that he bare him ſelfe in the fourme of breadde, whiche was no breadde in deede, but he him ſelfe ſo in the fourme thereof, as thoughe he had not beene therein. And therefore the fourme, maie alſo there, be ſayde to bee ſtraynge becauſe it was, as dayly it is, of him ſo ſtraingely vſed. Wherefore as he, to the two diſciples, ſhowed him ſelfe after a certayne maner, that is to ſaie, not in his owne proper fourme, but in the fourme of an other maner of manne, whyche made him therein ſo ſtraynge vnto theim then, ſo he bore him ſelfe in his owne handes after a certayne maner, that is to ſaie, not in his owne proper fourme, but in the fourme of an other maner of thynge, whiche maketh him therin ſo ſtraynge now vnto them, that bee vnfaithfull. For as Saynt Auſten ſaieth of it in manie places, Norunt fideles, The faythfull knowth him therein well enoughe, he is not ſtraynge therein

to them. For he that can vſe him ſelfe vnder one fourme, more then is proper or naturall vnto him, And that without the crafte, arte, or helpe of man, I doubte not, but that he can vſe him ſelfe vnder, an other and mo formes, or vnder as many as he will. As it may well appeere by that he ſhowed him ſelfe, as is aforeſaid to the two diſciples in the fourme of a trauailer by the waie.Luc. 24 Iohn̄. 20 Mat. 17. And to Mary magdalen in the fourme of a gardiner. Alſo an other tyme, to three of his diſciples, in the fourme of a glorified bodye. Wherefore he dyd none of theſe, after a common maner, but after a certain maner. Yet this ſame certaine maner, neither dooth, nor yet can take away, the very reall and ſubſtanciall preſence of the vſare thereof, or haue any beyng it ſelfe, where the vſare thereof is not, or force anye good and trew vnderſtandynge, that the vſare of it ſhoulde not euen be there, with it or in it. For it doothe but onelye ſhowe how dyuerſly, he can behaue him ſelfe in his apparence, and denieth not therein his preſence. By this therfore it maie well appere (as I ſaide before) that this ſaiynge (After a certaine maner) and this ſaiyng (after the letter) maie well agree, and ſtande both together.
                  As good reaſon, and thexample thereof whiche I haue recited vnto thee of the holy goſpell, dooth plainely declare. For the trewth to ſay, (as the trewth is in deede) thoſe two ſaiynges of Saynt Auſten are not ſpoken, but in theſe diuers reſpectes. The one (as I ſayde) in reſpect of the very ſubſtanciall beynge of the thynge it ſelfe, whereof it is ſpoken. And the other, in reſpecte of the Accidentall fact or behauiour of the ſame. Therefore when S. Auſten ſaith, Chriſte bore him ſelfe in his

owne handes after the letter, the very vnderſtandynge therof apperteyneth onely to the reall and ſubſtanciall preſence of Chriſtes very body in the ſacramente, nothinge touching any accidentall qualitees or occult behauiour thereof, but the verite of the ſubſtaunce onely. And when he ſaith, Chriſte bore him ſelfe in his owne handes after a certayne maner, the trewe meanynge of that apperteineth only to the very ſecret and inſēſible behauiour of it in the ſacrament, and not to the ſubſtance wherin that inuiſible behauiour is. And beſide this, how farre from all doubte of this vnderſtandyng, doth Saint Auſten expreſſe the matter him ſelfe, in his woordes before alledged? where he ſaith.
                  
                     Chriſte was borne in his owne handes, when he ſettynge foorth the ſame his owne body. fayth, This is my body. For he bore that body in his owne handes.
                  
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Ye what body?
               
               
                  CATH.
                  The ſame his owne body (ſaith Saint Auſten) or the ſelfe ſame body of his, chooſe the whether. For ſo theſe woordes, Ipſum corpus ſuum, maie or muſt needes be Engliſhed, and no way els more trewly. Wherefore thoſe woordes of Saint Auſten can not be applyed, to any ſigne, ſimilitude, or ſacrament other, but directly to the very ſubſtance of the thing that he ſpeaketh of, which is the bleſſed body of Chriſt. And that ſpecially when he addeth vnto it, and ſaith, he bore that body in his owne handes. He ſaith not a body, as incertaine which, but he ſpeaketh certeinly and ſaith, that body, wherof he dooth playnely treat. And that appeereth alſo in the other place, where he ſaith.
                  He bore him ſelfe after a certaine maner.
                  
                     For what ſo euer that maner of bearyng was, yet him ſelfe, can be none other but him ſelfe. Saint Auſten ſaith, he bore him ſelfe. And there is nother ſigne, ſimilitude, or ſacrament of him, that is, or can be properly ſaid, to be him ſelfe. For this worde, him ſelfe, or it ſelfe, hath none other reſpect, but alway and only, to the very reall and ſubſtanciall being of him or it, wherof it is directly ſpoken. Wherfore this that S. Auſten ſaith. Chriſte bore him ſelfe in his own handes after the letter. Serueth onely to conuince them, that denieth the very real preſēce of Chriſts bleſſed body in the holy ſacramēt. And this that he ſaith.
                  
                     He bore him ſelfe after a certaine maner.
                  
                  Serueth onely to helpe and amende the blindeneſſe of them, that conſidereth none other but onely ſuche common maner of bearyng and beyng, as their owne outwarde deceiuable ſences, dayly dremeth vpon, whereby they are drawne to ſuch wonder at the matter, that they thinke it to ſtrainge, to beleue therin, as the holy Catholyke churche dothe teache. And all becauſe this bearyng that S. Auſten ſpeaketh of, is not common, but after an other certaine maner, then their blinde phantaſtical dreming of ſenſible thinges, can, may, or is able, to reach vnto. And therefore therin to holde and kepe them ſtyll, Frith doth labour and trauayle with his wringyng and wreſting of this ſame certaine maner, to ſuch an vnderſtanding, as nother the wordꝭ of S. Auſten, nor yet any reaſon, authoritee, or learning, can beare or ſuffer. For he, thorow lacke of puttinge any difference betwene the thing done, and the maner of the doing, doth ſo confound them together, that with his handlyng of the one, he deceiueth

him ſelfe and many mo, in the trewth of them bothe. But ſuch was his lacke, not onely of learninge, but muche more of grace. For it is two thinges to teach what was done, whereof S. Auſten ſaith,
                  Chriſt bore him ſelfe in his owne handes after the letter.
                  And to teach how or after what maner it was doone, wherof S. Auſten ſaith no farther, but that it was done after a certaine maner, of which certaine maner, here he declareth no farther, becauſe (as he doth trewly ſay) the veritee of the thyng, the faythfull doth know. And therfore becauſe he declareth here no farther thereof, Frith of his owne head, taketh vpon him to do it him ſelfe, after his hereticall maner. Whom if we coulde beleue, we might thynk our ſauiour Chriſte no better then a very ſtone, without (as he ſayth) any parell of damnacion at all. Wherefore if thou haſte marked well, what I haue hitherto ſayd, thou maiſt eaſely perceiue how fooliſhe and falſe his vnderſtandyng of Saynt Auſten is.

                  That is to be weyed as we fynde him in the ende. For he hath mo places of S. Auſten for his purpoſe then theſe. And ſpecially one, whiche paſſeth all that ye haue herde of him yet, and directly againſt the place of the. 33. pſalme, whiche you haue alledged.

                  In the 27. leafe of his booke, he dothe alledge Saint Auſten both in latine and in Engliſhe alſo, after this ſorte, ſaiyng that Saint Auſten ſaith.
                  
                     
                        Non hoc corpus quod videtis, eſtis manducaturi, nec

bibituri illum ſanguinem quem effuſuri ſunt qui me crucifigent.

                     That is to ſay,
                  
                  
                     You ſhall not eate this body that you ſee, nor drinke that blood which they that crucifi me, ſhall ſhed out. I haue geuen a certaine ſacrament vnto you, if it be ſpirituallye vnderſtand, it quickneth you, But the fleſh profiteth nothinge.
                  
                  Now ſir, of this, Frith doth aſke this queſtion.
                  
                     What thinges can be more plainely ſpoken?

                  And I aſke of him agayne, what thinges can be more falſely vnderſtande, then he doth vnderſtande them? for if he had vnderſtand them trewly, or bene willyng ſo to do, he might and wolde, as well alledged S. Auſt. in theſe wordꝭ, which he hath no farther from that place, then in the very ſelfe ſame leafe, where he ſaith of our ſauiour Chriſte.
                  
                     Pſal. 92.
                     
                        Suſcepit enim de terra, terram. Quia caro de terra
eſt. Et de carne Mariae carnem accepit. Et quia in ipſa carne hic ambulauit, &amp; ipſam carnem nobis manducandam ad ſalutem dedit, Nemo autem illam carnem manducat niſi prius adoraueri, inuentum eſt quemadmodum adoretur tale ſcabellum pedum domini.
                  
                  That is to ſaie, He toke earth of earth, becauſe fleſhe is of earth. And of the fleſhe of Mary he toke fleſh. And becauſe he walked here in the ſame fleſhe, and for our helth hath geuen vnto vs the ſame fleſhe to eate, but no man doth eate that fleſh, except he honour it before, it is found how ſuche a foote ſtoole of our Lorde, ſhould be honoured.
                  
                  Now, although it doth not here (for lacke of that, which goeth before) euen euidently apere, why S. Auſten doth chiefly ſpeake theſe words, yet may I ſay of this place,

the ſame, and as well as Frithe dothe ſaye of the other, what thinges can be, more playnely ſpoken? More playnly ſpoken I ſay, as touching the veritee of Chriſtes own bleſſed fleſh and bloud in the holy Sacrament? For is it not here, moſt playnly expreſſed of Saynt Auſten, that Chriſte for our healthe hath geuen vnto vs the ſame fleſh to eate, wherin he walked here in earth? And where did he ſo giue vs that to eate, but in the holy ſacrament? Therefore what coulde Saynt Auſten ſaye more to the very playneſſe of the matter, if a man had aſked him purpoſely, how he did beleue therein, or what his faith was in that behalfe?
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Nay then, if Saynt Auſten can handle the matter after ſuche a ſorte, as of the other ſide, in the parſon of Chriſt to ſay.
                  
                     You ſhall not eate thys body, that you ſe, nor drynke that bloud whiche they that crucifie me, ſhall ſhed out. And farther ſay, I haue geuen a certayne ſacrament vnto you, yf it be ſpiritually vnderſtande, it quickeneth you. But the fleſhe profiteth nothinge.
                  
                  If Saynt Auſten (I ſay) can handle the matter ſo, that he will ſpeake ſo playnly of bothe ſides, and make for eache parte, beinge ſo contrary as Frithes opinion and yours is, truſt him who will, for ſo wyll I neuer from hence furth.

                  So wolde Frithe ſay for his parte, if he were to anſwere therin. And yet I dare ſay, he truſted him, no farther then he thought be ſhould make for his purpoſe. And (as it appereth) no more doeſt thou, nor any of you all.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Why ſay you ſo? for as touching Frithe, I am well aſſured that he truſted ſaynt Auſten aboue all men, as it dothe by his owne wordes euidentlie

appere.

                  If he had ſo done in deede, as he did falſely ſo pretende, he wolde not alledged the one of theſe foreſayd places, and lefte the other behinde as he doeth, being ſo nere together in one leafe, as of ſome volume they are in deede, but wolde alledge them both and made ſome conference betwene them of their agrement, if he had truſted Saynt auſten as wel in the one, as he did in the other. How be it becauſe he ſaw the one place, make ſo playnely with our belefe, that he coulde caſt there vpon no colour to the contrary, he left out that, and brought foorthe the other, whiche as he thought might ſeeme, to make only for his purpoſe altogether. Wherefore this cam not of any truſt that he had in Saynt Auſten in deede, but of the truſt he had in his owne falſe and wylie handlinge of ſome certayne places of Saynt Auſten, to deceaue hys diſciples withal, wherof he choſe this place, whiche thou haſt alledged to be one. For if he had truſted Saynt Auſten as he pretended to doo, he wolde haue truſted him as well in the one of theſe places, as in the other, where as now it is playne, he truſted him in none of them bothe or at the leaſt, miſtruſted him in the one, and onwares, or wilfully, wolde miſtake him in the other.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Why ſyr, wolde he haue hym truſt Saynt Auſten in bothe places, when they be ſo repugnant, and ſo contrary one agaynſt an other, that they can, by no reaſon, ioyne nor agree together?

                  Euen as I tell you.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  Thynkeſt thou Saynt Auſten beinge a man of ſuche witte, of ſuch learning, of ſuche holineſſe, and therfore of ſuche moſte excellent fame thorow all chriſtendome ſo many hundred

yeares, to be one of that ſorte, that in ſo weyghtie a matter, forgetteth to day, what he ſayde yeſterday? or wyll ſay one thinge now, and to morrowe the contrary? or in his writynge ouerſhotte hym ſelfe in one ſentence, before an other be drie? For doubtleſſe, theſe two ſayinges are placed ſo nere together, that I beleue the one was not drie, before the other was written. Therefore how madde a phanſy were it, ſo to thinke of Saynt Auſten, that theſe two places are contrarie, and one agaynſt an other?
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Why, who can take them otherwiſe, the wordes beinge ſo playne? for doth he not ſay in the one place,
                  
                     Chriſt hath geuen vs the ſame fleſhe to eate, wherein he walked here in earthe.
                  
                  And in the other place.
                  
                     You ſhall not eate this body that you ſee?
                  
                  And what is this, but eate and not eate one thinge both at once, whiche is not poſſible? for other that body which they ſaw, was the body of that fleſhe, whiche (as Saynt Auſten ſayeth) was geuen vs to eate, and that fleſhe was the fleſhe of that body whiche they ſaw, and ſhould not eate it, or els that body was of an other fleſhe and that fleſhe of an other body, and then the one or the other, not Chriſtes body or Chriſtes fleſhe, which were (I ſuppoſe) euen curſednes to thinke. For wherof is his owne body, but of his owne fleſhe? And whereof is his owne fleſhe, but of his owne body? And therfore where he ſayth the ſame fleſhe, he might haue ſayd the ſame body. And where he ſayth this body that you ſee, he might haue ſaid, this fleſh yt you ſe, &amp; al one. And therfore when he putteth eating in the one place, and not eatinge

in the other, and bothe of one thynge, what can be more contrary?

                  No trewly.

                  Then how ſayeſt thou to this? doth not Chriſte now in heauen, ſit on the right hande of God the Father, in the ſame fleſhe, wherein he walked here in earthe.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  That can not I tell.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  Why canſt not thou tell? for yf he ſit not there in the ſame fleſhe, wherein he walked here in earth, then he ſitteth not there in the ſame fleſhe, that he tooke of the holy virgin mary.
                  If he ſit not there in the ſame fleſhe, that he tooke of the virgin Mary, then he ſitteth not there, but in an other fleſhe, or els in none at all. If he ſitteth not there, but in an other fleſhe, or in none at all. Then is it not trew to ſay, that he is her ſonne, nor ſhe is his mother.

For ſhe can not be the very mother of an other fleſhe, then ſhe brought foorth her ſelfe, or the mother of no fleſhe at all. Wherfore, other thou muſt graunte this to be trew, (as I thinke thou wilt not) that ſhe is not now his mother, nor he her ſonne, or els thou muſte needes graunte, that on the right hande of God the father in heauen, he ſitteth now in the ſame fleſhe wherin he walked here in earthe. For that is the fleſhe whiche he tooke of her.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Well ſyr, I will not ſticke to graunt that now, becauſe I ſee more in it then I did before.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  Then if he (now ſittinge on the right hande of God the Father in heauen) haue the ſame fleſhe, wherein he walked here in earthe, and the ſame fleſhe, was here in earthe paſſible and mortall, how canneſt thou auoyde this, but that it is paſſible and mortall now in heauen?
               
               
                  HERE.
                  No ſyr not ſo. For I can auoyde that well enoughe, and it were but by this, that ye declared yeſterday, how Iohn Frithe was deceiued in his foundation, by miſtakinge of this ſame worde, the ſame. For althoughe Chriſte haue now the ſame body and fleſhe in heauen, wherein he walked here in earthe, yet he hath not there now the ſame, in the ſame and euerie condition.

                  HERE.
                  What els? For it is the ſame bodie and the ſame fleſhe in reſpecte of the ſubſtance, but not the ſame in reſpecte of the ſtate, condition, and accidentall qualites thereof, whiche it had when he walked here in earthe. For it was then paſſible and mortall, but now impaſſible, and immortall, whiche are cleane contrarye. And therefore not the ſame now, that it was then, nor the ſame then, that it is now in

one reſpecte. And yet the very ſame then, that it is now, and the very ſame now that it was then, in an other reſpecte. For ſuche is the difference betwene the ſubſtance and the ſtate, condition and accidentall qualites of any thinge, that it may alway and trewly be ſayde, to be the ſame and not the ſame in thoſe dyuerſe reſpectes.

                  Becauſe thou haſte (as thy wordes doeth declare) ſo good vnderſtanding of the difference, that is betwene the ſubſtance of a thinge, and the ſtate, condition, or accidentall qualites of the ſame. And yet neuertheleſſe, wilt take Saynt Auſten ſo ouerthwartly as thou doeſt. For where he ſayeth.
                  
                     Chriſt hath giuen vs, the ſame fleſhe to eate, wherein he walked here in earthe.
                  
                  Thou takeſt hym to meane that fleſhe in euery condicion, wyth all ſuche accidentall qualites as it had then. And not in the only reſpecte of the ſubſtance of it. And agayne, where he ſayeth,
                  
                     Ye ſhall not eate this body that ye ſee,
                  
                  Thou takeſt him to ſpeake that, in reſpecte of the ſubſtance, and not in the onelie reſpecte of the ſtate, condition, and qualites of it. So that, thou vnderſtandeſt Saint Auſten wronge in bothe places. That is to ſaye, thou takeſt his meanynge of the fyrſte place, to be in the ſeconde, and of the ſeconde, to be in the firſt, as the places them ſelues, are well able to declare. For where he ſayth.
                  
                     
                     Chriſt hath giuen vs, the ſame fleſhe to eate, wherein he walked here in earthe.
                  
                  Cleare it is, that in this ſame worde (vs) Saint Auſten amonge other, ment hym ſelfe to be one. And in that he ment him ſelfe to be one amonge other, to whome he ſayeth, Chriſte hath geuen his fleſhe to eate, playne it is he neuer mente, that Chriſte gaue it him or them to eate, but as it was in his tyme, when he ſhould eate it. And in his time when he ſhoulde and did eate it, it was nother paſſible, nor mortall, nor yet ſubiecte to any ſuch other accidentall and naturall qualites, as it was before the reſurrection therof. Wherfore thou mayeſt by thys, with halfe an eye perceue, that Saynt Auſten, neuer ſpake thoſe wordes of Chriſtes geuing his owne fleſhe to eate, in reſpecte of anie ſuche qualites, but onlie in reſpecte of the veritee of the ſubſtance.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Then, why doeth he adde vnto them, theſe wordes, ſayinge.
                  
                     Wherein he walked here in earth.

                  That he doeth, to declare his mynde and meaninge in the veritee of the thinge, whiche was in Saynt Auſtens time, (euen as it is now) the very ſame wherein he walked here in earth, and is now in the holy Sacrament. The verie ſame I ſay, in the only reſpecte of the ſubſtance, but (as euerie man doeth or ought to know) not the ſame, in reſpect of thoſe qualites, which in his reſurrection were chaunged into ſuch perfections as are to vs inſcrutable and incomprehenſible. And therfore of the other ſide, where Saynt Auſten ſayeth,
                  
                     Ye ſhall not eate this body that ye ſee,
                  
                  Why wilt not thou ſee, that to be ſpoken, not in reſpect of the ſubſtance but of the qualites, when the facultee of

ſeyng or ſight, doothe no farther extende or pertayne but vnto the vnderſtanding of the qualitees, and not of the ſubſtaunce? For if he had ſayd.
                  
                     Ye ſhall not eate this body, and gone no farther.
                  
                  Or had added vnto it theſe woordes.
                  
                     Which ſhalbe geuen for you.
                  
                  As it was ſayde at his inſtitucion of the holy ſacrament, it had bene then an other matter. But when he ſaieth.
                  
                     Ye ſhall not eate this body that ye ſee.
                  
                  What is it els to ſay, but that ye ſhall not eate this body viſible, or this body ſenſible, or this body in ſuch condicion and ſtate, as ye now ſee it in. When the ſeeyng it ſelfe, dooth import no farther of the body, but as aperteyneth vnto the ſight, or ſenſibilitee thereof?
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Then, why doth he adde vnto it theſe wordes, ſaiyng.
                  
                     I haue ſet foorth vnto you, a certayne ſacrament. If it be ſpiritually vnderſtande, it geueth you lyfe. But the fleſhe profiteth nothyng.
                  
               
               
                  CATH.
                  Firſt, theſe woordes.
                  
                     But the fleſhe profiteth nothyng.
                  
                  Are in this place, of Frithes owne adding and putting vnto the other before. And not of Saynt Auſtens puttyng there. How be it becauſe they be the woordes of the goſpell, and of Saint Auſten recited, not far from the ſame place, where Frith doth take the reſt, I wyll not cleane omit them, but I will ſpare them for a while, And firſt go to this that he ſaith.
                  
                     I haue ſet foorth vnto you a certayne ſacrament, and beyng ſpiritually vnderſtand, it geueth you lyfe.
                  
                  Therefore what other thinge is that to ſay but this, that

when he ſaith,
                  
                     Ye ſhall not eate this body that ye ſee.
                  
                  Ye ſhal not eate it in ſuch ſorte, as ye ſee it, but as it ſhal be in a ſacrament, wherin ye ſhall not ſee it. For els, if he had not ſo ment, he woulde not haue ſayde.
                  
                     Except ye eate the fleſhe of the ſonne of man, and drynke his blood ye ſhall not haue life in you.
                  
                  For he ment not that fleſhe to be eaten in that proper viſible fourme whiche they ſaw, and yet to be eaten, in deede for all that, or els he woulde not haue denied lyfe (as he dothe) for the not eating of it. And therfore eaten it muſt needes be of very neceſſitee. Althoughe not that, as it was of them ſeene, but yet that, as it ſhuld be of them and vs both, trewly and verily beleued, in the holy ſacrament. And for that cauſe he ſaieth, I haue ſette forth vnto you a certayne ſacrament, and beyng ſpiritually vnderſtande (that is to ſay, farther and farre otherwyſe then your ſences can reache) it geueth you lyfe. Wherefore becauſe here appeereth both eatyng and not eatyng of one thynge both at once, whiche are bothe trew, And that can not be in one reſpect, it muſt therfore nedes folow to be vnderſtand and taken, as the trewth is, in two reſpectes. Wherof the one, that is to ſay, the eatyng, is in reſpect of the verye thinge, with the inuiſible ſtate, occult and ſecrete behauiour thereof, as it is in the holy ſacrament. And the other, that is to ſay the not eatyng, is not but in reſpect of the viſible fourme, and ſencible apparence thereof to their eyes. And therfore this eating and not eatinge be not here ſo direct contraries, as thou takeſt them for.

                  Then, where is this become that he ſaith,
                  If it be ſpiritually vnderſtand, it geueth you lyfe?
                  As who ſay, or els it doth not?

                  I haue tolde the that already.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Ye but yet euen therin conſiſteth Frithes purpoſe altogether, as it maie partly apeere by that he ſaith in the .21. leafe of his booke, where he recityng the ſaynge of Chriſte to the Iewes that beleued him not, And alſo the minde of Saint Auſten therupon (as he ſaith) he hath theſe woordes.
                  
                     Chriſte ſaid, doth this offend you? what will ye ſay then, when ye ſhall ſee the ſonne of man aſcendynge thither, where he was before? Then addeth S. Auſten (ſaithe he) you ſhall know that he ment not, to geue his fleſhe to eate with your teeth: for he ſhall aſcende hole. And Chriſte addeth, it is the ſpiryte that quickneth, The fleſſhe profyteth nothynge. The woordes that I ſpake, are ſprite and lyfe. That is to ſay, (ſaith Sainte Auſten) are ſpiritually to bee vnderſtande. And where Chriſte ſaith, that the fleſhe profyteth nothyng, meanynge of his owne fleſhe, (as ſaynt Auſten ſaith), he meaneth that it profiteth not, as they vnderſtode him. That is to ſay, it profiteth not, if it were eaten.
                  
                  Now here ye may ſee, how Frith hath plainely proued both by the woordes of Chriſte, and alſo by Saynt Auſten vpon the ſame, that all this matter lyeth in a ſpirituall ſenſe, and muſt bee vnderſtande ſpiritually.
               
               
                  CATHOLI.
                  Frith hath not proued that ſo plainely, as he hath herein, proued him ſelfe a falſe lyar once againe. For vnder the colour of his allegacion of Chriſte, and Saynt Auſten together, he hath herein wrapped no ſmall pece of his owne hereticall falſhed, to

deface the trewth of them both. For of thoſe woords of Chriſte, the fleſſhe profiteth nothynge, when Saint Auſten ſaith it profiteth not, as they vnderſtode him, where did this antichriſt fynde this expoſicion, which he addeth vnto it, ſaiyng.
                  
                     It profiteth not, if it weare eaten.
                  
                  S. Auſten hath no ſuche thynge nor Chriſte nother. And yet as though they had, this crafty and falſe Raynarde doth annex it vnto their ſaiynges, to make it ſeme to be their meanynges.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  And will you call him an antechriſte therefore?

                  What ſhould I call him els? For who can be more contrary to Chriſt herein, then he is? for Chriſt ſaith.
                  
                     Except ye eate it, ye ſhall not haue life in you.
                  
                  And he ſayth.
                  
                     If ye eate it, it ſhall not profite you.
                  
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Tuſhe, thoſe be not Frithes woordes. For he ſaith.
                  
                     It profiteth not if it were eaten.
                  
               
               
                  CATH.
                  And what is that, but if ye eate if, it ſhall not profite you? is it not all one? Therefore is there any thynge more agaynſt Chriſtes ſaiynge then that? when Chriſte ſaieth,
                  
                     Except ye eate it, ye ſhall not haue life in you.
                  
                  Doth lyfe not profyte? and ſpecially euerlaſtynge lyfe, whiche Chriſte doth meane, and promiſe that we ſhall not haue it, except we eate his fleſhe? And yet this antechriſt ſaith, it ſhall not profyte vs, if we eate it.
                  Therefore, whiche of theſe two, are we beſt to beleue? Chriſte, or this his wicked aduerſary? for both we can not allow, they be ſo contrary.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  They be not ſo contrary as ye take them. For all Chriſtes meaninge

(as it apereth by his owne woords) is of ſpirituall eatyng by feyth, and not of carnall eating with the teth. And that doth Frith defend and nothynge els, as it apereth in the .44. lefe of his boke where his wordꝭ be theſe.

                        If Chriſte had (ſayth he) ſo ment, that his owne bodie naturall ſhould haue continued in the ſacrament, whiche is the meate of the ſoule thorow feyth, and not of the body by eatynge of it, and maie as well be eaten thorow feyth, although it remayne in heauen, as if it were here preſent to our mouthes, if he had (I ſaie) ſo ment, then wold he neuer haue geuen vs ſuche ſcriptures as he did. for I ſay that this groſſe imaginacion may not ſtande with the proceſſe of the ſcripture, whiche is receiued, as it ſhall appere by certeine textes. Firſt where our ſauiour ſaith, The fleſſhe profiteth nothyng. The waight of thoſe words doth compell vs to vnderſtande our matter ſpiritually.
                        For by this ſhorte ſentence, we are no leſſe plucked backe from the carnall eatyng, then was Nichodemus, that he ſhould not once dreame of the carnall regeneracion, when Chriſte ſaide vnto him. That what ſo euer was of the fleſhe, was fleſhe.
                     
                  
                  And alſo againe, in the .47. leafe, Frith hath accordyng to the ſame euen theſe woordes.
                  
                     It is impoſſible (ſaith he) the ſcriptures ſtandyng as they dooe) that the naturall body of Chriſte, ſhoulde be preſente to our teeth in the ſacramente. And as for our faith it neadeth not to haue hym preſent in the bread. For I maie as well eate him and drynke him thorow faith. That is to ſay, beleue in him, as though he were as preſent in the ſacrament, as he was hangynge on the Croſſe.
                  
                  In this ye ſee, Fryth dothe expreſſe his mynde ſo playnly that no man can doubt of his meanynge therein. Whiche in effect reſteth but in two pointes, wherof the one is. That chriſtes very bodie fleſhe and blood hath no verie beeynge nor reall preſence in the

ſacrament. And the other is, that what ſo euer Chriſte ſpake as towchynge the eatynge therof, muſt nedes be vnderſtande, onely ſpirituall. And theſe two hath he proued by the woordes of Chriſte, and alſo by S. Auſten to.

                  What, wilt thou be at that poynt yet, for all that thou haſt hytherto herde already? thou plaieſt the very Frithiā now in dede, to ſay that he hath proued both, when he hath proued in dede none of the both by any thynge that we haue harde of him yet. But thou haſt herde profe enough to the contrary, if that wolde ſerue. And therfore what ſo euer he hath brought for his profe hytherto, hath other made directly agaynſt him, or els vtterly nothynge for him. Therefore ſpeake of no profe that he maketh, for he maketh none in dede.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Yes ſyr, for he hath proued, that it muſt be vnderſtande ſpiritually. And therof it muſt nedes folowe, that it maie not be vnderſtande carnally, for they be two contraries. And therefore, where there maie be no carnall vnderſtandynge, there can be no fleſſhe remaynynge. Wherefore thus hath Fryth his purpoſe thorowly, that is to ſay, that the fleſhe profiteth not to be eaten, and that, by reaſon of the ſpirituall vnderſtandinge, wherof he is moſt aſſured, both by chriſts woordes (as I ſayde) and Saynt Auſtens alſo.

                  Then if he were ſo aſſured, he coulde not be therein deceiued.

                  HE.
                  Why, thou maiſt perceiue by thine owne reaſon, and alſo by this which I told the before, that although, it muſt be vnderſtand ſpiritually yet it foloweth not that it muſt be vnderſtād only ſpiritually. For ſpiritually (as I ſaid) and onely ſpiritually,

is two thinges. Therfore if Frith take it to be vnderſtande onely ſpiritually without any other, or farther reſpect, then he taketh it otherwyſe, then he hath, or is able to proue it, by the woordes of Chriſte, or Saint Auſtens other. Againe of the other ſyde, if he take it to be vnderſtande ſpiritually and not onely ſo, Then hath he proued therin, ſo muche for his purpoſe, as is in deede, euen nothyng at all.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Why ſyr it is profe enoughe for him, that he is by Saint Auſten moſte certayne and ſure (as he hath declared) that it muſt be vnderſtande ſpiritually.

                  HERE.

                  Then he wolde haue geuen it a difinicion, and made it certaine, before he had wrought anie concluſion thervpon, as euery threw and wyſe perſuader dothe, in what ſo euer he taketh vpon him to proue. But this we ſee he did not. And why? but other becauſe he was therin ignoraunt, and therfore coulde not do it, or els becauſe he was of ſuch a malicious falſhed, that though he could, ye he wolde not doe it Which is of the twayn, moſt lyke to be trew. For he ſaw perchance that if he had made a good difinicion, or playne diſtinction, betwene the ſpirituall and the carnall vnderſtandyng therof, it ſhould not only not haue ſerued, but alſo clene haue deſtroied his purpoſe altogether. And therfore he choſe rather to roue at a vēture, thē to ſhote at any mark certein. wherfore let vs, ſeke out the certeinte of this ſpirituall

vnderſtandyng. And that once had, wee ſhall ſoone ſee, whether he went about to bring it to light, or els to hyde it all together, or no. For he will not deny but that Saynt Auſten and other olde auncient, fathers and doctors of the holy church, did certeinly know it, when he pretendeth to proue all his purpoſe, moſte chiefely by them.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  I graunt that, for them he wil not deny.

                  Then remember thou well, what I haue hytherto ſayd. And let vs returne to thexaminacion of that, which thou haſt recited all ready, out of the 21. leafe of his booke.

                  Marry ſir that is how Chriſte, to thoſe that beleued him not, did ſay.
                  
                     Doth this offende you? what if ye ſhall ſee the ſonne of man aſcendynge thyther, where he was before? Then addeth S. Auſten (ſaith he) you ſhal know, that he ment not, to geue his fleſhe to eate with your teeth. For he ſhall aſcende hole. &amp;c.
                  
               
               
                  CATHOLICVS.
                  Is this Saint Auſtens ſaiynge vpon thoſe woordes of Chriſt?
               
               
                  HERE.
                  So ſaith Frith.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  Therefore here, thou ſhalt ſee once agayne, what Frith was. For if it were not for auoyding of tediouſneſſe, I woulde recite vnto the, the very woordes of S. Auſten, vpon thoſe words of Chriſte, both in latine and alſo in engliſh. but his woords in latine turned into engliſhe ſhall be ſufficient, which are euen very theſe.
Chriſte anſwerynge ſayd, Dothe this offende you, that I ſayde, I geue you my fleſſhe to eate, and my bloodde to drynke? This offendeth you in deede. Therefore what if ye ſee the ſonne of man aſcendynge thyther where he was before? What is this? By this he eaſed ſome, whom he knew. By this he opened wherwith they were offended. Wherwith vtterly, if they woulde haue vnderſtande it. For they thought him to deuyde and

diſtribute his body. But he ſayde, he wolde aſcende into heauen euen whole. When ye ſhall ſee the ſonne of man aſcendinge where he was before, ye ſhall certaynlie ſee euen then, that he diſtributeth not his body, in that maner that you thinke. Ye ſhall euen then certenly vnderſtande, that his grace is not with bytinges conſumed. 
                  
                  Now where is this, that Frithe ſayeth of Saynt Auſten.
                  
                     You ſhall know that he ment not, to geue his fleſhe to eate with your teethe?
                  
                  Where is this (I ſaye) where is it? in deede it can not be founde. And therefore in the ſteede of that, thys we finde, that Frithe was nothinge aſhamed of his lies. For if he had, he wolde neuer haue put ſo many of them in his writinges as he did. And beſides this, what faute is there here founde, with thoſe vnbeleuers of Chriſte, whiche vnderſtode him not in this matter?
               
               
                  HERE.
                  This faute, That their vnderſtandinge ranne vpon the fleſhe of Chriſt.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  That is falſe. For their faute was not therin, but it was in their miſvnderſtanding of the maner of it, as here Saynt Auſten in playne wordes doeth well declare, they thought him to deuyde, and diſtribute his body peece mele. And that miſvnderſtandinge, doeth Chriſtes queſtion touche directly, ſayinge. What yf ye ſee the ſonne of man, aſcendynge where he was before?
                  
                  What were this queſtion of his hoole body to the purpoſe, if it were not to confound, and ouerthrow their miſvnderſtandinge of the diuiſion therof in partes? for by this, he opened, (as Saynt Auſten ſayeth) wherewith they were offended. Whiche was with the diſtribution and erogation of his body in partes as they thought.
                  So that their faute (for whiche they are here reprehended)

was for that they gaue no farther credence to Chriſt, in the maner of geuyng his fleſhe to eate, then theyr owne imagination, and blinde vnderſtandinge did leade them vnto. And not for that, they thought hys meanynge to be of hys owne very fleſhe in deede. For whiche thinking of his owne very fleſhe, they bare here, no ſmake of any blame at all, as they ſhould haue done, if it had bene a faute ſo to thinke. Wherefore, this thou mayſt ſee, how very nothinge, this place maketh for Frithe, notwithſtandinge all the great truſt that he had therin.

                  HERE.
                  Ye but ſyr, ye muſt conſider, that (as you haue herde) Frithe goeth farther then this. Saying euen there.
                  
                     Chriſt addeth. It is the ſpirite that quickeneth, the fleſhe profiteth nothinge.
                  
                  This text excludeth all vnderſtanding of fleſh, and driueth vs to the ſpirit altogether.

                  There, Frithe wolde haue it indeede. But why doeth he not bringe in Saynt Auſten there, as well vpon this text.
                  
                     The fleſhe profiteth nothinge.
                  
                  As he wolde make vs beleue, he doeth, vpon this other before.
                  
                     It is the ſpirit that quickeneth?
                  
                  Sythe they ioyne ſo nere together, as immediatly one text after an other can do?
               
               
                  HERE.
                  He thought it was no neede, becauſe this. The fleſhe profiteth nothinge, is ſo playne of it ſelfe.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  It is harde to finde thee without an excuſe. But neuertheleſſe thou ſhalt here

what Saynt Auſten ſayeth of it, for all that. And then iudge, why Frith did paſſe it ouer. For Saynt Auſtens wordes turned into engliſhe are euen theſe.
                  
                     What is this (ſayth Saynt Auſten) that he putteth to it, it is the ſpirit that quickeneth, the fleſh profiteth nothing? let vs ſay vnto hym (becauſe he ſuffreth vs, not ſpeakinge contrary, but coueting to know) O good lorde and mayſter, how doth fleſhe profit nothing, when thou haſt ſayd, except a man eate my fleſhe, and drinke my bloud, he ſhall not haue lyfe in hym? doth lyfe profit nothing? And for what pupoſe are we that we are, but that we might haue euerlaſting life, whiche thou haſt promyſed with thy fleſh Therfore what is, it profiteth nothing, the fleſhe profiteth nothinge, but as they vnderſtode it? for they vnderſtode fleſhe ſo, as it is rent, or torne in a dead carkas, or as it is ſoulde in the ſhambles, and not as it is quickened with the ſpirite. Therfore ſo it is ſayde, the fleſhe profiteth nothinge, as it is ſayde ſcience puffeth vp. Now therfore ought we to hate ſcience? God forbyd. And what is, ſcience puffeth vp: alone without charitee. Therfore he ioyneth to it. But yet charitee doeth edifie. Adde therefore charitee to ſcience, and ſcience is profitable, not by it ſelfe, but by charytee. Alſo now lykewyſe, the fleſhe profiteth nothinge, beinge fleſhe a lone. Let the ſpirite come to the fleſhe, as charitee commeth to ſcience and it profiteth very muche.
                  
                  And a littell after, he ſpeakynge in the parſon of Chryſte knitteth vp hys expoſicion of thys texte wyth theſe wordes.
                  
                     So, I geue not my fleſhe to eate, as they did vnderſtand fleſhe.
                  
                  Wherof it foloweth (ſay I) that otherwiſe he did geue it to eate, although he did it not ſo. For the wordes import no leſſe. Therfore, here thou mayſte parceyue, why Frith brought not forth this place or expoſition of Saint

Auſten, as he doeth the texte, wherevpon he goeth. Whiche was in deede, becauſe he lyked not Saynt Auſten ſo well in other places, but he liked hym as euyll in this, for all his falſe boſtinge, that he maketh ſo muche for his purpoſe. Where as in deede, he maketh for him in no place, but directlie agaynſt hym in many places, as it hath, and hereafter ſhall right well appere. Wherefore in all this, thou ſeeſt, Saynt Auſten taketh not the ſpirituall ſence ſo, that he excludeth the whole vnderſtandynge of all fleſhe therein.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Syr, Saynt Auſten commeth not to that yet. For vnto this text, that is to ſay,
                  
                     It is the ſpirite that quickeneth, the fleſhe profiteth nothinge.
                  
                  Frithe doeth adde the wordes of Chriſt folowing, with Saynt Auſtens mynde vpon the ſame, whiche wordes are theſe.
                  
                     The wordes that I ſpake vnto you, are ſpirite and life, That is to ſay (ſayeth Saynt Auſten) are ſpiritually to be vnderſtande.
                  
                  Here is the hoole matter come now, euen clerely to light, bothe by Chriſte and Saynt Auſten to. And what wolde you haue more?

                  This expoſition of S. Auſtens, whiche thou ſpeakeſt of now, is very ſhorte.
                  And more ſhorte then he is wonte to make vpon ſo great a matter. And therefore coulde Frith finde no more of it but this?
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Yes ſyr ſumwhat more, which will lyke you leſſe, if ye heare it.

                  It were ſtrainge that I ſhould miſlike any of Saynt Auſtens doinges in ſuche matters. And therefore what ſo euer it be, I pray thee let me heare it.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  That ſhall ye do. For Frithe in the .45 leafe of his booke hath theſe wordes.
                  
                     
                     This is a playne concluſion (ſayeth he) that when Chriſte ſayde, the fleſhe profiteth nothinge, he ment it euen of his owne fleſhe, that it coulde not profit, as they vnderſtode hym, to be eaten with the teethe. Albe it, it dothe muche profit to be ſlayne for our redemption, and eaten thorough fayth. Whiche thinge we may do, althoughe his naturall fleſhe be not in the Sacrament. For I may as wel beleue in hym, thoughe he be in heauen, as if he were in earthe, and in the Sacrament, and before myne eyes. And that Chriſte ſpake theſe wordes of his owne body, it is playne, by Saynt Auſtens wordes, writing vpon the ſame place. And therefore he ſayeth, that they muſt be vnderſtande ſpyrytually, and addeth, if thou vnderſtande them ſpyritually they are ſpirite and life. And thoughe thou vnderſtand them carnally, yet neuertheleſſe they are ſpirit &amp; life. But vnto thee, they are not ſpirit &amp; life, which vnderſtandeſt not ſpiritually, thoſe thinges that I haue ſpoken.
                  
                  Here you may ſee now, that Frithe hath more of Saint Auſtens expoſition, then I tolde you of before.

                  Thou ſayeſt euen very trew. And therfore where thou telleſt me, that I may here ſee now, that Frithe hathe more of Saynt Auſtens expoſition, then thou diddeſt tell me of before, I ſay vnto thee agayne, that thou mayeſt here ſee (yf thou marke it well) that vpon theſe wordes of chriſte,
                  
                     The fleſhe profiteth nothinge.
                  
                  Frith doth bring in that expoſition of S. Auſtens, which Saint Auſten maketh vpon this ſayinge of Chriſte.
                  
                     The wordꝭ which I haue ſpoken vnto you, ar ſpirit &amp; life.
                  
                  And the proper expoſition that Saynt Auſten maketh vpon theſe wordes.
                  
                     The fleſhe profiteth nothynge.
                  
                  
                     Which expoſition, I recited vnto thee right now my ſelf, he doth cleane omit and diſſemble, as though there were no ſuche matter at all. Therfore wilt thou not ſee, what a parte he playeth herein? Thus to applie a mans expoſition of one text, to an other, and his proper expoſition of that other, cleane omit, diſſemble, and will not be knowne of it? Haſt thou ſeen a more manifeſt falſhed at any mans hande?

                  Syr the macter is not ſo great as ye make it. For when Chriſt ſaith, my wordes are ſpirit and life, he meaneth thoſe wordes whiche he ſpake at that tyme, amonge whiche were euen theſe.
                  
                     The fleſhe profyteth nothynge.
                  
                  Therefore they be of the wordes, which he meaneth to be ſpirit and life. That is to ſay, ſpiritually (as S. Auſten ſayth) to be vnderſtand. Wherfore theſe wordes of ſaynt Auſten, ſpiritually to be vnderſtande, do as well ſerue and expounde this texte.

                  What moneth thee to thinke, that I wolde ſo ſay, but euen the verie trewth therof? for moſt trew it is, that the one expoſition ſoundeth no more of the ſpirit, then the other doeth of the fleſhe. Whithe Frithe coulde in no wiſe away with all. And therfore that made hym ſo redy to bringe forth that one, which might ſeme to make for his purpoſe, and not to be knowne of the other, whiche maketh ſo muche agaynſt him. For all his purpoſe was in nothinge ſo muche, as to exclude all the reall beyng of Chriſtes very fleſhe, in the holy Sacrament. For there, he wolde haue nothing but very bread in a bare ſignification. And therfore coulde he abide nothing, that myght ſeme or ſounde to the contrary. But what ſo euer he coulde finde amonge the olde holy fathers, to ſounde or ſmacke of any ſpirituall vnderſtandinge in the matter, that did he catche and holde, thinkinge vtterly thereby, to proue his intente thorowly. Neuer ſerchinge what they mente by it, but alway tooke it and applied it to that he wente aboute, whiche was, as it dothe well appere, nothinge els but falſhed indeede. And therefore it proued there after. For had he bene at the fyrſte, as redy to trie what the olde holy fathers ment, by that ſpirituall vnderſtandynge, as he was raſhe and readie to runne headlinge vpon hys owne dreamynge thereof, without any good aduyſement or dew conſyderation, or wolde haue referred the iudgement of his owne phanſyes, to the Holy Catholike churche, as euery trew and good chriſten mā ought to do, and as I

For my part, dayly pray God of his grace, that I neuer do otherwiſe, if he had (I ſay) this done, it had neuer proued with him &amp; ſome other as it hath done, whiche was but according, to this old ſaying, the haſty man, lacketh neuer woo.

                  Sir why do you account him raſh and haſty herin, when he taketh not the olde holy doctours, but according to their owne ſayinges?
               
               
                  CATH.
                  I do account him ſo, becauſe all ſayinges, are not alway ſo ſimple, but that many of them oftentimes, contayne and haue in eache of them, diuerſe vnderſtandinges. Or els there ſhould not be as there is, ſuche contention aboute there meaninges, after that men hath vttered and putte forthe their bare ſayinges. Wherfore, the faut of raſhnes that I finde with Frithe, is becauſe he looked ſo muche vpon their ſayingꝭ, that he paſſed nothing vpon their verie meaninges, but to their ſayinges, he ioyned his own meaninges, and thereby deceiued him ſelf and many other moo.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Why, what other meaninge ſhould he gather of this their ſaying, a ſpiritual vnderſtādyng, but a ſpiritual vnderſtanding in deede? And that he not only doeth, but alſo defēdeth, as much as he can. And therfore as I tolde you before, where there is a ſpiritual vnderſtandinge, there can be no carnall vnderſtandinge. And where there can be no carnall vnderſtanding, there can be no very fleſh remayning.

that is to ſay, ſo in one reſpect, and otherwyſe in another reſpect. Wherefore if it maie be, both ſo and otherwyſe, where is Frithes purpoſe become then, which reſteth all together vpon only ſo and none otherwyſe? Therfore he muſt proue, that it is onely mere ſpirituall, and not onely that, but alſo, what a ſpirituall vnderſtandynge is. For without that all his hole talke, is but vayne bablynge and nothyng els.

                  Well ſyr, it is to late for him, to dooe that nowe. And therefore ſith ye holde it ſo neceſſary to be done, I pray you for the fruictful furderance of our talke herein, declare you whether the vnderſtanding of it be onely mere ſpirituall or not, and what the ſpirituall vnderſtandyng of it is.

                  Then thou muſt firſt conſider this, that although ſome, yet all and euery ſpirituall vnderſtandynge, doth not exclude, and forbyd the vnderſtandynge of all maner of fleſſhe, as it doth, when it is but onely and mere ſpirituall, as ſome tyme it is, and ſome tyme not. For if thou take ſpirituall vnderſtandynge ſo, that is to ſaie, to be alway of onely and mere ſpirituall thinges, thou ſhalt not take anie body or fleſhe, within the compas of any ſpirituall vnderſtandynge at all. Wherefore if thou take it ſo, that there may be no ſpirituall vnderſtandyng of any fleſhe, thou takeſt it then, euen directly againſt the holy Apoſtle Saint Paule, wrytynge to the Corinthians of the generall reſurrection, and deſcribinge the difference of the ſtate of the body before and after. where he ſaythe, It is ſowne a naturall body,1. cor. 15 and it ſhall ryſe a ſpirituall

body. There is a naturall body. And there is a ſpirituall body.
                  
                  And a little after he ſaith alſo.
                  
                     That is not firſt, whiche is ſpirituall, but that, whiche is naturall. And then that whiche is ſpirituall.
                  
                  Here thou maieſt ſee by the holy apoſtle (if thou truſt him) that ſome bodye is, and mo ſhalbe, ſpirituall at length. And a ſpirituall body can not be, trewly vnderſtande, but at the leaſt in ſome reſpect ſpyrytually. Except thou wilt ſay, it maie be otherwyſe vnderſtande then it is, which is no perfyte good, and trew, vnderſtandyng in dede. Therefore, this doth not folow, as Frith wolde haue it, that where is a ſpirituall vnderſtandynge, there is no fleſhe. But this doothe well folowe, that where there is ſpirituall fleſhe, there the vnderſtandynge muſt needes be ſpirituall, not therin deniyng the veritee of the fleſhe, but declaring the ſtate and condicion therof. Yet this ſpirituall vnderſtanding, is not al onely and mere ſpirituall, becauſe it is not dyrectly and only of a ſpirite, but of a certaine perfite and very fleſhe, whiche is ſpirituall, and not a ſpirite, but ſpirituall, for that it is aduaunced ſo nere the perfection of the ſpirite, whereunto it is knit, and therby made ſpirituall, as of the contrarie parte, the minde of ſome man is made carnall and fleſhly, not becauſe it is fleſhe-but becauſe it is ſo addict vnto the fleſhe, that it is become ſubiect vnto the vitious deſires or inclinaciō therof. And therfore called (as it is in dede) fleſhely. For of ſuch a man, we ſaie, he is a man of a fleſhly mynde, yet his minde is not fleſhe for all that. Wherfore as the ſpirite of that man is fleſhly and no fleſhe, ſo is the fleſhe of

the other, ſpirituall and no ſpirite. And for that it is ſpirituall, it muſt be ſpiritually vnderſtande. And that can it not trewly be without the ſpirite, by whiche it is made ſpirituall. And therfore the woordes whiche are ſpoken of that fleſhe, are called ſpyrite and lyfe, that is to ſay, ſpiritually to be vnderſtande. For without that ſpyryte the fleſhe profyteth nothyng. Wherwith, they were trewly anſwered, whiche toke it otherwyſe, that is to ſay, without the ſpyryte. As it apereth by the words of Saint Auſten recited before.

                  Yet it wyll not ſynke in to my head, but that, if this ſpirituall vnderſtandyng of fleſhe, be of fleſhe, that is verye fleſſhe in deede, it muſt nedes haue alſo then, a fleſhly vnderſtanding with all.
                  Becauſe it ſemeth more agreable to the thinge, then the ſpirituall vnderſtandynge of it dothe. For what maketh vnderſtandinge carnall or fleſhelie but fleſhe? or howe can fleſhe bee not fleſhely vnderſtande, when vnderſtanding muſt needes be after, and accordinge to the thing that is vnderſtande?

                  Herein thou art as frith was, wonderfully deceiued. For he did, as thou doſt put no difference, Inter carnem &amp; carnalem. That is to ſay, betwene fleſhe, and fleſhly or fleſhy, when the one hath reſpecte to the ſubſtaunce of fleſhe, and the other, to the naturall qualitees, diſpoſicions, propertees and vſage thereof, or thereunto belonginge. And therefore when the fleſſhe is vnderſtande, after anye of them, then the vnderſtandynge of it, is carnall and fleſhely, For thoſe

naturall qualitees, propertees, and diſpoſicions of fleſhe, is it, that maketh the vnderſtandinge of it carnall and fleſhelye, and not the ſubſtaunce it ſelfe: as it maie well appere, not onely By Saint Paule, but alſo by Saint Auſten vpon the ſame ſixt chapiter of Saint Iohn, where his woordes be theſe.

But the apoſtle ſaith, and ſaith trew, to vnderſtande after the fleſhe, is death. Our lorde gaue vnto vs, his fleſhe in eate, and to vnderſtande after the fleſhe is death, when he ſaide of his owne fleſſhe, that there is euerlaſtynge lyfe. Therefore we ought not to vnderſtande fleſhe after the fleſhe.

                  I ſay that S. Auſten ſaith here very well. For what meaneth he by this, that we ought not to vnderſtande the fleſhe after the fleſhe, but that we ought to vnderſtande it after ſome other thing, whiche is here ment by the fleſheand not the fleſhe it ſelfe?

haue thought the ſo fooliſhe, as to take it ſo. for this as is though it were all one to ſaie, we ought not to vnderſtande the fleſhe after the fleſhe, and to ſaie, we ought not therein to vnderſtande any fleſhe at all, when the ſaiyng forbyddeth vs not, the vnderſtanding of the fleſhe it ſelfe, but the vnderſtandynge of it, after the common courſe, and naturall diſpoſicion thereof. It forbyddeth vs to vnderſtande it, as nature here daiely doth vſe it, and at length ſhall leſe it, but not as the ſpirite ſhall at length againe obteine it. The ſpirite of man it ſelfe, is nowe in this lyfe muche after the fleſhe here, but the fleſhe in the next lyfe, ſhalbe after the ſpirite there. After the fleſhe here, hath no place, nor being there. And that ought we to conſider here. For the fleſhe is one thinge, and after the fleſhe is an other. Wherfore although in the courſe of nature, they go here both together, yet in this matter, our vnderſtandinge muſt plucke them a ſonder, or els, thou ſhalte vnderſtande fleſhe, after the fleſhe, whiche is death, as thou haſt harde before, and more playnely doth appere, by the manifeſt woordes of thapoſtle againe, in an other place, where he ſaith.

after them. But ſo it nother is, nor ought to be known now. And therfore not after the fleſhe, and yet fleſhe in dede for all that, although not fleſhly fleſhe, which onely maketh fleſhely vnderſtandyng, But ſpiritual fleſhe which maketh the vnderſtandynge ſpirituall.

                  No, it ſhall not be onely my ſaiynge, but as in the .17. leafe of his booke, it maie be partly perceiued by his owne ſaiyng, which is this.
                  
                     As touchinge the other woordes (ſaith he) that Chriſte ſpake vnto his diſciples at the laſt ſupper, I deny not but that he ſayde ſo, but that he ſo fleſhlie ment, as ye falſly feygne, I vtterly deny.
                  
                  Now marke, what doth he meane, by this, whiche he laieth here ſo ſore to our charges, that we haue (as he ſaith) ſo falſely feygned of Chryſtes meanynge?

                  He meaneth your feygnynge to be this, that Chriſt

ment, that his woordes, concernynge his bodie, ſpoken at his laſt ſupper, ſhoulde be taken and vnderſtande fleſhlie, whiche can not be.

                  Therfore by this it is cleere, that his meanynge of our feynynge, is euen like his vnderſtandynge, which is in deede both falſe and fleſhly to. For do we feyne, that Chriſte ſpake thoſe woordes of his bleſſed body, with a fleſhely meaning? Where findeth he, that we feyne that, as here he luſteth ſo to lie? For we do not only, not feine it, but vtterly deny it, conſtantly affirmynge, and faithfully teachinge, that therin Chriſte ment, in deede very fleſhe, but yet not (as this fleſhe monger lieth) fleſhly fleſhe, for all that. How be it euen fleſhely fleſhe it is, which Frith dreameth vppon, and none other. And that deceaueth him altogether. For commonly where ſo euer he maketh mencion of Chriſtes bodie, his fleſhe, and eatynge therof, he doth not call it but a naturall bodie, naturall fleſhe, and the eatynge thereof, carnall eatynge, eatyng with the mouth teeth and belly, and ſuche other talke concernynge the ſame, as ſmelleth not, but euen altogether fleſhely and nothynge els: as it appereth in the .44. and .45. leafe of his booke, and many other places therein beſyde: when, as I tolde thee before, betwene fleſhe and fleſhely, there is as great difference, whiche Fryth did nothynge conſider. And therfore it is no wonder although he came neuer at the ſpyrituall vnderſtandyng of the matter, beyng ſo fleſhelie phantaſied, as his owne talke therein doth plainely declare that he was. Wherfore in him are well verified theſe woordes of thapoſtle ſaiyng.

But the ſpirituall man iudgeth all. That is to ſay.

                  Nay not ſo. For we beleue, that therin is verie fleſhe for all that. But he beleueth that therin, is vtterly none at all. Therefore his opinion and ours are not bothe one.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Then, how can you beleue, that therin is Chriſtes very fleſhe, if ye beleue not, that hys naturall bodie, and naturall fleſhe is in it?
               
               
                  CATH.
                  Well enough. For if thy weake hedde coulde beare it, I wolde deny, that Chriſt hath any naturall body, or naturall fleſhe other.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  No not in the ſacrament.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  No nor in heauen or any where els.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  What neuer ſpeake it. For then it muſt folowe, that he hath no very body, nor very fleſh at al.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  That is after Frithes learning. For his wit was ſo yoked with the commen courſe of nature, that his vnderſtandinge coulde reache no farther. And yet in his tyme I dare ſay he herde of this difference of thinges, that ſome were naturall, and ſome ſupernaturall. Wherfore, I deny not, but that the bleſſed body and very fleſhe of our Sauyour Chriſte, was once naturall, but not ſynce the tyme of hys reſurrection. For what is naturall, but what ſo euer is vnder the yoke and lawes of nature, as our bodies

are, and our fleſh is? And what thinges may we call ſupernaturall if that be not one of them, whiche hath bene once naturall, and now hath ouercome the power and ſtrength of nature, and hath gotten cleane out of the lawes and bondage therof? wherefore, yf thou ſay, that there is no ſuche thinge, then thou muſt needs graunte, that the body, and fleſh of our Sauiour Chriſt hath euen now, neede of eyer and brethe, meate, drinke, ſlepe and ſuche other, as without whiche, no naturall body of man doeth,Ex. 34.3. re. 19. or can be able, to lyue and indure. Except it be by myracle for a ſeaſon, as in parte, it was wyth Moyſes and Helyas by the ſpace of .40. dayes. Therefore if the body of Chriſt haue now, neede of thoſe thinges, then it is paſſible, and may ſuffer. If it be paſſible and may ſuffer, then it is mortall, and may dye. And that I am ſuer thou wilt not graunt. Wherfore if it can not dye, it is not mortall, if it be not mortall, it can not ſuffer. If it cannot ſuffer, it hath no neede of thoſe thinges, or any other like. If it hathe no neede of any of thoſe thinges, what hathe nature to do with it, when thoſe be thynges, which of neceſſite nature requereth? Therfore if nature haue nothing to do with it, how can it be natural? That, is not naturall, whiche the courſe of nature hath nothinge to do with all. Therfore why doth Frithe ſo often call it natural, but becauſe his vnderſtanding of it, was ſo carnal that he coulde ſee no ſparke of the ſtate of it, whiche is ſpiritual? He did not know, that natural and carnal, are no meete, nor conuenient termes, to be put to the expreſſion of the holy fleſhe of Chryſte, as they are not indede If a man ſhould go to the very proper ſignification of the wordes. Becauſe therein they make no difference

betwene the ſtate of that fleſhe and ours. For ours is naturall and carnall. And therefore to the declaring of hys fleſh, there ſhould be put in the place of naturall, ſupernatural. And in the place of carnal, ſpiritual, as now the verites of the thinge, doth moſt worthyly and dewly require. For if it were alway vſed to be ſpoken of ſo, it wolde perchance eaſe ſome weake myndes, of many carnall and fleſhly phantaſies, that runneth yet in their hed des aboute this matter, as there did none other in Frithes hedde, ſo longe as he lyued. For as it appereth in dyuerſe places of hys booke, he tooke nature, to be one of hys pryncipall groundes, to proue his purpoſe by, in thys caſe. And therfore he that wyll go aboute to improue and diſalowe that by nature, whiche is ſupernaturall, ſhall proue hym ſelfe (I may ſaye to thee) euen as Frythe did, farre worſe then a naturall foole. Wherefore herein leaue thy dreamynge of what ſo euer is naturall and carnall, and tourne it to that, whyche is ſpirituall and ſupernaturall an other whyle. Or els thou ſhall neuer haue, trew, perfit, and conſtante faythe in this matter, whyle thou lyueſt. For ſo longe as thy cogytation herein, runneth or reſteth vpon the common courſe of naturall fleſhe, thou ſhalt neuer be ſatiſfied, wyth any trewth, that thou ſhalt gette and come by that waye. Therefore remember and folow the holy Apoſtle in that he ſayeth (as I tolde thee before.)
                  
                     Although we haue knowne Chriſte after the fleſh,2. cor. 5, 1. cor. 15 yet we do not ſo now, for if therbe (he ſayth) a naturall body,
there is alſo a ſpirituall body. Now he it that is not fyrſt,

whiche is ſpirituall, but that whiche is naturall, and afterwarde that, whiche is ſpirituall.
                  
                  Wherefore in this matter, thou muſt forget naturall and fleſhly fleſhe, and vnderſtande, or at the leaſt haue in beleefe, ſupernaturall and ſpirituall fleſh. And then thou ſhalt, as Frithe did not, trewly vnderſtand the meaning of Chriſte, where he ſayeth.

                     The wordes whiche I haue ſpoken vnto you are ſpirite and lyfe.
                  
                  For ſpirituall vnderſtanding is not here, as Frith did take it, only and mere ſpiritual, without all reſpect, and being of any maner of fleſhe at all. Nor the carnall vnderſtanding, whiche he ſpeaketh of, and layeth here to our charges, is none ſuche nother, as he taketh it for.
                  He was farre deceyued in bothe. For as he tooke the one, to be onely and mere ſpirituall, So he tooke the other to be only and whole carnal. Which are bothe falſe, as it may well appere, and it were but by the very ſubſtance of the thinge it ſelfe, whiche indede is fleſhe. But yet ſome way, ſo ſpiced with ſpiritualitee, that it is nother carnall, nor yet only, or mere ſpirituall, but ſpiritually to be vnderſtande, for the ſpirituall ſtate, whiche it hath obteyned.

                  HER.
                  Then, what is carnall vnderſtandinge?
               
               
                  CATH.
                  That is well aſked. For with that, thou ſhouldeſt begyn. Becauſe that once knowne, thou ſhalt know the other ſo muche the better. For that order in the ſame matter, vpon this text, the fleſhe profiteth nothing, doth holy Chriſoſtome folow in theſe wordes.
                  
                     Quid autem eſt carnaliter intelligere? ſimpliciter veres dicuntur. Ne
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         aliud quippiam excogitare. Non enim ita iudicanda ſunt quae videntur. Sed miſteria omnia interrioribus oculis conſideranda, hoc eſt, ſpiritualiter. Qui non manducat carnem meam, et bibit meum ſanguinem, non habet vitam in ſemet ipſo.
                     Quomodo nihil prodeſt caro, ſine qua nemo poteſt viuere? vide quod ea perticula, caro non prodeſt quic quam, non de ipſa carne, ſed de carnali auditione dictum eſt.
                  
                  
                     That is to ſay.
                  
                  
                     But what is it to vnderſtande carnally? ſimply as the thynges are ſpoken, and to imagyn therof nothing els.
                     For thoſe thinges which are ſeene, are not to be iudged ſo. But all myſteris are to be conſidered with the inwarde eyes. This is ſpiritually. He that eateth not my fleſh, and drinke my bloud, hath not lyfe in him. Now doeth the fleſh profit nothing, without the whiche, no man may lyue?
                     Marke, that this parte, the fleſhe profiteth nothing, is not ſayd of the fleſhe it ſelfe, but of the carnall hearyng of it.
                  
                  Here, by this, thou mayſt well perceyue, that carnall vnderſtandinge extendeth no farther herein then ſenſible experience doth leade. But ſpirituall vnderſtanding extendeth to that, which no ſenſible experience is able to reache or come vnto, although it be in ſenſible thinges. As the grace of baptim, although it be in the ſenſible ſacrament and miniſtration thereof, yet it is inſenſible it ſelfe. Farther more thou mayſt here alſo perceyue, that

holy Chriſoſtome doeth not reprehende the vnderſtandinge of the fleſhe it ſelfe, but the carnall hearyng of it.
                  That is to ſay, the fleſhly or fleſhy vnderſtanding of it.
                  Whiche is, when it is taken and vnderſtande after the fleſhe, as it is in the commen courſe of nature. For that, he doeth here reprehende and nothing els.

                  I take vnderſtanding, and beleuynge to be without any great difference in this caſe. And therfore becauſe this poynt runneth vpon ſpirituall vnderſtandinge, how can I vnderſtande very fleſhe, but that myne vnderſtanding thereof, muſt be carnall and after the fleſhe, whiche I do vnderſtande?

                  I pray thee hartely vnderſtande that fleſh, euen after that fleſhe, and ſpare not. For ſo, thyne vnderſtanding of it ſhall nother be carnall, nor yet natural nother as carnall and naturall be communly taken. For if thou vnderſtande that fleſhe, after that fleſhe indeede, thou doeſt then vnderſtande it euen as it is, and not as it was, that is to ſay, as it is now, and hath bene euer ſince his reſurrection. But not as it was, betwene that, &amp; the firſt time of his incarnacion. How be it, this ſame carnal &amp; after the fleſh, that I meane here, is not in him, properlie called, carnall &amp; after the fleſh now, but ſpirituall and after the ſpirit. Becauſe in him, what ſo euer was cōteyned vnder or in the ſignification of this worde carnal is

now turned ſo farre into the contrary, that it is comprehended vnder the ſignification of this worde ſpirituall.
                  And therfore if thou vnderſtande that fleſhe, after as it is now, thine vnderſtanding of it is then ſpirituall, and not carnall.

                  Ye but although that fleſhe be (as ye ſay) ſpirituall, yet it is fleſhe. And therefore ſithe it is fleſh, how ſhall I know when I vnderſtand it ſpiritually and not carnally?

                     Therfore that liuinge fleſhe, whiche is aboue, and be yonde al the power of death, muſt needes be immortall. For althoughe death &amp; it, made once a fray, wherin death gat the victory and the fleſhe gaue way for a litle whyle, yet ſoone after, that ſame fleſhe gat the victory of death agayne, and that for euer. Wherefore if there were no more, nor anie thinge els, wherby to vnderſtande it immortal, but this one teſtimoni of thapoſtle, it were (as it is) ſufficient &amp; euen enoughe to any good chriſten man.

                  That is not ſo. For the feelynge of payne, doth not euen properly belonge and apperteyne vnto lyfe, but vnto death. Euen as the ſelynge of pleaſure, doth not belonge vnto death, but vnto lyfe. It is proper to death, to come by paine. And proper to life, to acquere pleaſure. for the felynge, which perfect and very lyfe hath, is of none other but of pleaſure. And the feling that very death hath, is of none other, but of paine. But this is ſumwhat ſtrainge, becauſe in this world, there is none of them both. That is to ſaie, nother perfect life, nor yet (if I may ſo call it) perfect death nother. For the lyfe that we haue here now is but as it were a courſe vnto deth, or a mixture of both together. wherein death in concluſion preuaileth and maketh an ende of both. that is to ſaie, of life and it ſelfe to. For they both be here tranſitorie and temporall, but afterwarde, permanent and eternall, not mixed and confounded together, or the one folowynge the other, as they do here. But there, clerely and diſtinctly ſeparate a ſonder, eache from other, for euer more.

                  Thou that takeſt one thynge for an other. For did I ſaie that they ſhall remaine deade? when I ſayd none otherwyſe but that they ſhall remaine in death. Ded and in death, are two thinges. For he that is dead, is paſt death &amp; without all

maner of felyng. But ſo is not he, that is in death. For he is but at the poynt of dyinge, which abydynge ſo, is farre worſe, then dead in deede. For he feleth ſumwhat but what is that? In dede no pleaſure, but onely paine and that extreme. Wherfore that, or ſo much as we ſee of this matter, by dayly experience here, geueth to vs good occaſion of ſome conſideracion, how it ſhalbe there. For although it be finiſhed here in a ſhort time, yet it ſhalbe there continuall for euer. Wherefore, ſay not, that thoſe whiche ſhall remaine in perpetuall damnacion and miſerie, ſhalbe therefore immortall. For that woorde properly, belongeth onely to them, that ſhall remaine in pleaſure eternall. And therfore as thoſe maie, and be trewly called immortall, ſo the other might, if the woorde were in vſe, be called inuitall.
                  For thoſe two woordes geueth this muche to be vnderſtande, that, as the one ſort, nother doth nor can die.
                  So the other, nother doth nor properly can lyue. For they be contraries.

                  That is not ſo. For what is feelynge, but the ſenſibilitee of well or wo? That is to ſaie, of pleaſure or payne, And therfore whereto tendeth, or belongeth the ſenſibilitee of payne, but vnto death, as I tolde the before? And whereto, tendeth or belongeth the ſenſibilitee of pleaſure, but vnto lyfe? And therefore, ſhall, or maie we ſaie, that they haue in hell the ſenſibilttee of pleaſure?

God forbyd. If they haue not the ſenſibilitee of pleaſure, they haue not that, whiche apperteyneth and belongeth properly vnto lyfe. If they haue not that whiche apperteyneth and belongeth vnto lyfe, how can we trewly ſaie, that they dooe lyue or haue lyfe?
               
               
                  HERE.
                  why ſyr, lyfe is one thynge, and pleaſure is an other, and payne is a thyrde. Wherefore I take not lyfe of it ſelfe, to be other pleaſure, or payne other, but onely as it were an indifferent receptacle of the other two by courſe, as they chaunce vnto it.

                  Ye, that is here in this worlde, where death hath dominion ouer it. And where thoſe contraries of pleaſure and payne are confounded together for the tyme. But not ſo afterward in the worlde to come, where they ſhall be deuided, with all that properly belongeth vnto them.
                  And ſo to remaine a ſonder for euer more. And therfore it foloweth not, that they haue lyfe, becauſe they haue the ſenſibilitee and feelynge of extreme paynes, whiche (as I ſayd) belongeth vnto death, and not vnto lyfe.
                  For how ſhould we trewly iudge lyfe in thoſe, which we know, it were better for them, that they had neuer bene borne: as of one of them in eſpeciall, the Goſpell doth ſay.

                  That is to ſay.
                  It had beene good for that man, if he had not beene borne.
                  If he had not bene borne, he had had no lyfe. Therfore if he haue life, and had bene better to haue had none, then it muſt folow, that no lyfe, is better then lyfe, which cannot be.

                  Yes ſyr in ſome reſpecte. For

although lyfe muſt needes be better then no lyfe in reſpecte of it ſelfe, and in the order of nature, yet no lyfe is better then lyfe, in reſpect of him, which hath purchaſed ſuch a ſtate, that no good thinge, can do him good. Wherfore becauſe this can not be auoided, but other he hath life, or no life, and clere it is, that he hath not no life, which no life were better for him then lyfe. Therfore if muſt nedes folowe, that he hath lyfe, although it be worſe for him thē no life.

                  I ſhall tell you therein, as I thynke. becauſe death conſiſteth in extreme paynes, and paynes be there, extreme and perpetuall, therfore it maie well be called death, ſpecially when it hath in it no commoditee lefte, that apperteyneth vnto lyfe, except it be feelynge.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  Nay excepte not that. For feelynge is no commoditee but condicionall, that is to

ſay, if it be of pleaſure, wherof they in hell haue none at all.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Therfore the lyfe that they haue, maie be called death.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  Ye but the ſcripture doth not ſo call it, becauſe it maie, but becauſe it is ſo. And therfore how canſt thou trewly call them immortall, when they are in a death eternall? they might rather be called mortall, then immortall. How be it properly none of them both. For mortall is that. whiche ſhall haue a fynall death. And immortall is that, whiche ſhall haue none at all, but a perpetuall and a pleaſant life. for neuer die, is onely in heuen. And euer die, is only in hel, Wherfore ſith euer die, and neuer die, be two direct contraries, this woorde immortall can neuer be trewly nor properly ſayd of them bothe: for it doth exclude and vtterly forbyd the vnderſtandyng of all death, which hath in hell, no leſſe then a perpetuall continuance for euer.
                  Therfore ſith it maie thus appere, that although thoſe damned bodies ſhall haue their beyng eternall, and yet are not in deede immortall, becauſe they ſhall remaine in the ſecond death which is perpetuall, it muſt nedes folow, that there is no ſuche impediment as thou doſt obiect againſt the going together of impaſſibilitee and immortalitee, but that they maie, as they are, and muſt nedes be, alway inſeperable. Wherefore although by this occaſion, thou haſte cauſed me ſomewhat to dygreſſe from my purpoſe, yet to returne therevnto agayne, I ſay as I ſayde, that as paſſibilitee and corruptibilitee doth apperteyne and belonge to the ſtate of mortalitee, ſo doth ther contraries, that is to ſay, impaſſibilitee and incorruptibilitee appertayne and belonge to the ſtate of immortalitee. And for

a generall rule, there is nothynge that is or maie be ſo vnderſtande of Chriſtes fleſhe, and his bodie nowe immortall, as it is and maie be now of other mennes fleſhe and their bodies, or might haue bene of his, when it was mortall.

                  Beware what thou doeſt. For wilt thou vnderſtand the ſenſibilite of his bodie, to be ſubiect to the ſenſis of men, and to the actions of other naturall thinges, as the ſenſibilite is of our bodies?

                  What, when ſo many diſpleaſures chaunceth to men therof, as we may dayly ſee? doeſt thou not know, that by our ſenſibilite we be made ſubiect to paſſibilite? for what corporall paſſion or payne coulde be put vnto vs, by any man, or other body, if we could not be hard, ſeen, touched, or felt? or what penal ſuffering could touche vs, but by our ſenſes of hearing, ſeyng, or felyng? Therfore by our ſenſes or ſenſibilite, we come to paſſibilite &amp; ſuffring, and by paſſibilite &amp; ſuffring we come to death and corruption. There is no man I ſuppoſe, that hath the ſtature and quantite of his body ſo, but that he wolde, ſome time, for one cauſe or other, haue it other more, or leſſe, or otherwiſe then he hath, yf he myght. If not, yet who doeth not know it to be ſubiect to diuiſion, which tendeth to corruption, and ſo to deſtruction? therfore wilt thou vnderſtand the forme, figure, ſtature, quātite, ſenſes, &amp; ſenſibilite of chriſtes body after this ſorte, &amp; as thou doeſt &amp; muſt needes vnderſtād them in, &amp; of other mens bodies? if thou ſo do, wtout queſtion, thine vnderſtandinge of it then, is but carnall &amp; after

the fleſh, And not ſpiritual and after the ſpirit, &amp; therfore not according to ye ſcriptures before alledged. For ſo thyne vnderſtanding walketh not, but wtin the compaſſe of ſenſible experience, whiche can not reache, to the ſtate of immortalite, nor to any thinge nere it. For ſo long, as thou vnderſtandeſt any poynt in that body ſo, as yu doeſt and muſt vnderſtand it in ours, without faile thou doeſt not vnderſtand it immortall, but as it were mortall ſtil, although, or what ſo euer thou doeſt thinke, or phanſy to the contrary. For what is in our bodies, yt is not ſubiecte to diſſolution, corruption, and mortalite? And what is ſo contrarie to immortalite as thoſe thinges are? therfore thou ſhalt neuer trewly vnderſtand Chriſtes body to be immortal, ſo longe as yu dremiſt vpon any thing to be in it, as it is naturall. Becauſe it is not in parte, but euen whole ſupernaturall altogether.

                  Therfore thou haſt them not, ſubiect to thy wil when thou canſt not vſe them accordinge to thy wyll.
                  Wherfore by this it appereth playne, that when thou art ſeen, and parchaunce woldeſt not be ſeen, theſe thinges in thee then are therin but reſyſters of thy wyll, and not folowers therof. And therefore, god forbyd that we ſhould vnderſtande them to be ſo, and after that ſorte, in the bleſſed bodie of our Sauyour Chriſte. Wherfore, other he hath them not at all, or els he hath them ſubiect to his holy will. And parell it were to thinke, that he hath them not at all, becauſe it is ſo harde to vnderſtande, how a very body may haue any beynge without them. And more parill it is to thinke, that he hath them in his body, as we haue them in ours, whiche are tending to corruption. But no paril at al, to thinke yt he hath them ſubiect, and at the becke of his holy wil, to vſe or not vſe them after this or that ſorte, alway at hys pleaſure. That is to ſay, to ſhow them or not ſhow them, or him ſelf by them,

when, where, and as it ſhall pleaſe hym. For yf it were his glorious pleaſure to ſtande here now betwene vs bothe, thynkeſt thou that we ſhoulde ſee theſe thinges in hym, as in like caſe, we ſhoulde ſee them in other, and aſke them no leaue? or that his very beyng betwene vs, ſhould let thy ſeyng of me, or my ſeynge of thee, as an other mans direct being betwene vs ſhould do, whether we or he wolde or not, except it were his holy pleaſure ſo to do? And therfore, becauſe the altitude of this matter, extendeth ſo farre beyonde the common reache of our reaſon, and vnderſtandinge, how to auoyde euery how, that hath, is, or may chaunce to be hurled agaynſt it, but with other like howes of the ſame ſorte, it pleaſed hym of his infinit goodneſſe, for the coroboration of the verite of our fayth herin, to leue vnto vs, in his holy ſcripture, ſome, ye and ſufficient examples therof. For how dyd the ponder ofite of his holy boddy behaue it ſelfe,Iohn. 6 when he walked vpon the water? did it not there, forſake the common order of nature, and ſubmit it ſelfe wholy and only to his will? How did the viſible forme, of his whole body, (wherein al theſe thinges were contayned) behaue it ſelf,Iohn. 8. when the Iewes wolde haue horled ſtones at him in the temple, if they had not ſuddenly loſt their ſight of it? did not alſo that, euen there then, leaue the order of nature, and folow his only wyll likewyſe? mo plates diuerſe there be, for the purpoſe, whiche ſhal not neede to be recited now: Therefore if he had theſe accidentall qualites of hys body, ſo obedient vnto his wyll, that he myght as he dyd, vſe them at hys pleaſure, contrarie and agaynſt all the rules of nature, (he beinge then, in a mortall ſtate, and they of them ſelues in a naturall

courſe) how muche more now and euer ſince are they ſubiecte to his will, he hauinge his body glorified, and in a ſtate immortall? wherin, they are alſo chaynged, from what ſo euer the ſtate of mortalite in them requered. Wherfore, if he hath them (not as we haue of neceſſite) but as the trewth is, at hys liberte, to vſe, or not vſe them (as I ſayde before) when, where, and how ſo euer therein hys holy wyll and pleaſure is and ſhalbe, where are all your knappyſhe and ſcorneful cauillations become, that ye, by the natural courſe of theſe thynges, make agaynſt hys reall and very preſence in the holy Sacrament? ſaying, what? ſo longe and large a body, with hādes, feete, armes legges, hed, heere, backe and belly, in ſo litle a roume and ſpace, as the Sacrament is of? and yet more ouer, nother ſee him nor feele him nother? who wolde beleue thys? In deede none of you, whiche frame your beleuynge, after your ſenſible ſeing and feelynge. But neuertheleſſe, what are all theſe cauillations of yours to the purpoſe? all theſe I ſay, wyth other, of ſome of you, more ſhamefully inuented, then of vs, conueniently may be recyted? Therfore what if thou thy ſelfe, haddeſt the ſenſible forme of thy bodie, at the liberte of thyne owne wyll, to ſhow or not ſhow it, how, when, and where thou liſte? woldeſt thou not ſome tyme be ſo amonge men, that nother by their ſeynge, nor yet by theyr feelynge, they ſhould beware of thee? And when thou were ſo amonge them after that ſorte, wolde it folow that thou were not there, becauſe they coulde not ſe thee, nor feele thee? Therefore by theſe your owne obiections, it appereth playne, that your cogitations and

vnderſtandynges herein, runneth not, but directly and only after the fleſhe, and not after the ſpirite. Ye and that after the fleſhly fleſhe, without any ſparke or reſpecte, of any ſpirituall fleſhe at all. Wherein lieth ſo muche of the matter, as cauſed the Holy Apoſtle to ſaye.
                  Althoughe we haue knowne Chriſt after the fleſh,2. cor. 5. yet we do not ſo now.
                  That is to ſay.
                  Not now after as it was, when he walked in it here in yerthe accordyng to the courſe of nature, and ſo therein ſuffered at lengthe. But now after the ſpirite, and as the ſpirite had obteyned it, when and before he ſitting in Emmaus with the two of hys dyſciples, ſhowed him ſelfe vnto them, fyrſte in one forme, whereby they knew him not, and immediatly after in an other, wherby they knew hym in deede, And yet there vpon ſo ſuddenlye vaniſhed away from theyr ſyght, that bothe they and alſo we, myght and may thereby vnderſtande and perceyue, how very ſubiecte and obedient his ſenſible forme, was and is, vnto his holy will, to vſe, thys way or that way, at hys only pleaſure. Therefore it foloweth not, that he is not preſently and verely in the holy Sacrament, becauſe he ſuffreth vs not, therein ſenſibly to ſe him, nor feele him. But this foloweth well, that becauſe he ſuffreth vs not, to haue any ſuche ſenſible experience of him therein, we be ſo muche the more bounde, therefore to thanke hym, as all the merit and profit of our faythe commeth to, in that holy miſtery. Wherein, amonge all other artycles, faythe is in none (as I thynke) more excellent and neceſſarie.
                  Wherefore, thys thou haſte nowe harde euen more

then enoughe, to perceyue how farre Frithe was (for all his babling pretence of the contrary) from the very ſpirituall vnderſtandynge of this great myſtery. And thorow his lacke of that, and of good will together, what blinde and dampnable falſhed he fell into, bothe in hys vnderſtanding of the Scripture, and alſo of Saynt Auſten likewyſe, I thynke I haue declared vnto thee ſo muche therof, that thou canſt not with reaſon, require anie more, wherby thou mighteſt any better know what he was, then by thys that I haue ſhowed thee all redy.

                  In the 23. and the .24. leafe of hys booke, he doeth vpon this ſayinge of Chriſte.
                  He that eateth my fleſhe and drinketh my bloud, bydeth in me and I in hym.
                  Alledge Saynt Auſten in theſe wordes.
                  
                     Qui manducat carnem meam, &amp; bibit meum ſanguinem, in me manet &amp; ego in illo. Hoc eſt ergo mandu care illam eſcam &amp; illum bibere potum, in chriſto ma nere et illum manentem in ſe habere, ac per hoc, qui non manet in Chriſto, &amp; in quo non manet Chriſtus procul dubio non manducat eius carnem nec bibit ſā
                        guinem, etiamſi tantae rei Sacramentum, ad iuditium ſibi manducat &amp; bibit.
That is to ſay.
                  
                     He that eateth my fleſhe and drynketh my bloud, abideth in me, and I in him. This is therfore the eatinge of that

meate, and drinikng of that blood, to abyde in chriſte, and to haue him abydynge in vs. And therfore he that abideth not in Chriſte, and in whom Chriſte abideth not, without doubt he eateth not his fleſhe nor drynketh his blood, although he eate and drinke the ſacramente of ſo great a thynge vnto his damnacion.
                  
                  And vpon this, Fryth him ſelfe hath theſe woordes.
This one place (ſaith he) is ſufficient to proue my purpoſe though he ſaide not one woord more. For here he dooth plainely determyne, that he which abideth not in Chriſte, That is to ſaie, he that is wicked or vnfaithfull, doth not eate his fleaſhe nor drynke his blood, although he eate and drynke the ſacrament of ſo great a thynge. And ſo muſt it needes folow, that the ſacrament is not the very naturall body of Chriſte, for then the vnfaithfull ſhoulde eate his fleſhe, ſeynge he eateth the ſacrament of his body.
                  
                  How ſaie you now?

                  No not ſo, For although this be enough, yet he hath more.

                  In the ſame leafe, Fryth goeth farther with theſe woordes.
                  This ſaiyng (ſaith he) hath ſainte Auſten in an other place alſo, where he writeth in this maner.
                  
                     Qui non in me manet, &amp; in quo nō ego maneo, nō ſe dicat aut exiſtimet manducare corpus meū, aut bibere ſanguinem meum. Non ita
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         manent in Chriſto qui non ſunt eius membra. Non ſunt autem membra Chriſti qui ſe faciunt membra Meretricis.
                  
                  That is to ſay.
                  
                     He that bideth not in me, And in whom I abide not, let him not ſaie, or thynke, that he eateth my bodye or drinketh my blood. They abide not in Chriſte, which are not his membres. And they are not his membres, which make them ſelues the membres of an harlot.
                  
                  And theſe (ſaith Frith) are alſo the very words of Bede.

Wherunto he addeth of his owne woordes theſe.
                  
                     Here is it plaine (ſaith he) proued againe by the auctorite of S. Auſt. and Bede, that the wicked and vnfaithfull (which are not the membres of Chriſte) do not eate his bodie nor drynke his blood. And yet they do eate the ſacrament as well as the other. Wherefore you muſt needes graunte (ſaith he) that the ſacrament is not the naturall bodie of Chriſte, but a fygure, token, or memoriall thereof.
                  
                  Now ſir, do you marke well theſe places of S. Auſten, and what Frith doth here gather of them?

                  I will tell the ſo thou wilt firſt conſider his old fooliſhe accuſtomed concluſion, which he doth here inferre and renew againe, and that in both theſe places.

                  Be not theſe his woordes?
                  It muſt needes folow, and ye muſt needes graunt, that the ſacrament is not the naturall body of chriſte.
                  What is this to his purpoſe, of the not beyng of Chriſtes very body in the ſacrament? to be, and to be in, is all one with him. Whereof I haue tolde the enough before. And therefore, what fyndeſt thou els in anie of theſe two places of Saint Auſten, that can make any thynge for his purpoſe?
               
               
                  HERE.
                  I wonder that ye wyll aſke me that queſtion, ſith they make ſo muche and ſo cleerely for him as they do. For whether you take the ſacrament it ſelfe, to be the very body of Chriſt, of Chriſtes

very body to be verely in it, theſe places maketh directly againſt you in them both.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  How ſo?
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Doth not the firſt place ſay (as Frith hath declared) that, to eate Chriſtes fleſhe, and drynke his blood, is to abide in him, and he in vs? and by that, he that abydeth not in Chriſte, nor Chriſte in him, eateth not his fleſh nor drinketh his blood, although he eate and drinke the ſacrament thereof. Now this beinge plaine enough, yet to confirme the ſame, doth not the ſeconde place ſay alſo, let not him ſay or thynke, that he eateth my body or drynke my blood, which abideth not in me, and in whom I abyde not? Therfore they abyde not in Chriſte, which are none of his membres. And they are none of his membres, which maketh them ſelues the membres of an harlot. And yet cleere it is, that ſuch wicked perſons, doth often times eate and drynke the ſacrament. Wherfore, if other the ſacrament it ſelfe, were Chryſtes verie body and blood, or his very body and blood were verely in it, it ſhulde and wolde nedes folow, that ſuche wicked lyuers and vnfaythfull perſons, as neuer abyde in Chriſte, nor he in them, whiche dooe daiely eate the ſacrament, ſhoulde therin eate his very bodye, and drynke his blood. And that doth Saint Auſten in bothe places vtterly deny.

                  Marry that ſuch wicked perſons do eate the very body of Chriſt, when they eate the ſacrament.

                  Ye ſir when the woordes be ſo plaine as nedeth it not. For Saint Auſten ſaith, that thoſe perſons doth not eate the body nor fleſhe of Chriſte, when

they eate the ſacrament. And what wolde ye haue more plainly ſpoken then that is?
               
               
                  CATH.
                  I graunt it to be both plainely ſpoken, and alſo trewly. But yet nother plainely nor trewly nother, as Frith doth take it.
                  For he taketh it not to be ſpoken, but of the very reall eatynge of it, whiche in deede is vtterly falſe, and directly againſt that, whiche I tolde the, of Saint Auſtens own ſaiynge before. where he ſaith,
                  
                     Chriſte for our health, hath geuen vs the ſame fleſhe to eate, wherin he walked here in earth, and the ſame fleſhe, that he tooke of the virgin Mary.
                  
                  And where did he (as I ſaid before) geue vs that fleſhe to eate, but in the holy ſacrament? And therefore who ſo euer dooth eate the ſacrament, muſt nedes alſo therin, eate that fleſhe, or els that ſaiynge of Saint Auſten can not be trew. Wherefore this is directlye againſte Frithes vnderſtandyng of theſe two later places: which thou haſte recited. Whereby we maie well perceiue, that Saint Auſten ment not in them, as Frith doth take him. For if he did, he ſhoulde be in this one place, directly agaynſt him ſelfe in the other two places. Whiche in ſo weighty a matter, god forbyd to be thought of S. Auſten: whoſe moſte excellent witte, learning and holyneſſe, hath reigned and floriſhed ſo longe in ſuche an honorable eſtimacion, as it hath moſt worthely done. For herein, if he had ſo ment as Frith doth take him, then in him there ſhould haue bene verified this notable ſaiynge of the Apoſtle.

                     Therefore, Saint Auſten was to wiſe, to well lerned, and to happie, to ouer ſhoote him ſelfe in this great matter, with any crum of the leuen of this contradicion.
                  Which were enough to deface all his doyng herein, and him ſelfe to. Wherfore it can not be auoyded, but this is enough, whereby thou maieſt be ſure, that frith dooth falſely vnderſtande theſe two places of Saint Auſtens, as he doth all the reſt before.

                  I wyll here more eare I graunt ſo much. For how ſo euer ye auoyde this contradiction in Saint Auſten yet I am ſure ye can not auoyde the contradiction that is herein betweene hym and you. For here he ſaith plainely that the wicked, whiche abyde not in Chriſte, nor Chriſte in them, doth not eate Chriſtes body nor his fleſhe, although they eate the ſacrament therof. And you ſay here as plainely, that they do eate it. And what is this but eatyng and not eatynge one thynge both at once. And what is that, but plaine contradiction, which in no wiſe can ſtande together?

                  That is euen I. For dooſt not thou know, that in dayly common meates, eating is ordeined onely, to mans commoditee and profite, And not to his hurt or hinderance, although they be daiely, very muche abuſed?

                  And doth it not ſometyme chaunce, that the hole man and the ſicke man, eating of one meate, the one eateth it to his profyte, and the other to his hurt?
               
               
                  HERE.
                  What of that?
               
               
                  CAT.
                  If the ſicke mans eatyng, who taketh nothinge but hurt and hinderaunce therof, ſhould come in queſtion, or be aſked whether he doth eate any thing

or not, will it not, nor maie it not, be rightlie anſwered and ſayde, that he eateth nothynge? When he taketh not that therein, whiche eatynge is chieflie or onely ordeyned for? In ſo muche that if one will ſaye, he dooth eate, wyll not an other ſay, what eatynge call ye that, whiche dooth more hurte then good? ye rather no good at all, but muche hurt, when the eater is neuer the better for it, but the worſe: For is that eatynge worthy, or meete to be called eatynge, which is not onely without all the commoditee and profite of eating, but alſo doth purchaſe far more hurte and hinderaunce, then not eatynge. Therefore althoughe in reſpecte of the thynge eaten the ſycke man dooth eate the verie ſame meate, whiche the hole manne dooth eate, yet becauſe he dooth not eate it, with that inwarde effecte and profyte of it, that the hole man dooth eate it with all, it maie well be ſayde and ſtande with reaſon, that he eateth not, becauſe that whiche he dooth, is but in vayne. For althoughe eatynge bee commonly taken and vnderſtande of the meate and outwarde maner of receyuynge thereof, yet it maie as well and better be vnderſtande of the verie inwarde commodytee and profyte thereof, for whiche profyte only, the outwarde eatynge is prepared and ordeyned, as it is plaine, when without, yt the other doth nothing (as I ſayd) but greatly hurt and hinder, although the faute and cauſe therof, be not in the meat taken, but onely in the ſtate of the taker. Wherfore, if a man wolde ſaie, (as ryght well he might) that the ſicke man eateth

not, meaninge in reſpect of the commoditee and profite, that eatynge is ordeyned for, yet of that faiynge it foloweth not, but that he dooth eate of the verie ſame meate, that the hole man dooth eate, for all that.
                  For the name of eatynge dooth include the vnderſtandyng, not only of the outwarde maner of eatynge, but alſo and moſt cheefly, of the inward cōmoditee and fruictfull profite therof, which is the very dew ende, wherunto the other is not ordeined but only to ſerue. And therfore of eating, that ſame dew ende, doth moſt worthely beare the name, as it doth ſomtime, and euen ſpecially now in this caſe, where it is, of no more mente, but euen of that alone. So that betwene theſe two reſpectes, that is to ſaie, of the outwarde eatynge, without profite, and of the inwarde eating, wherin conſiſteth all the profite therof, there is both eating and not eating of one thing, and that both at once. The one by it ſelfe alone, euyll and hurtfull: and the other, good and effectuall. Therfore likewiſe in our caſe, of this effectuall eatynge it is, that Saint Auſten dooth here ſpeake of. For doth he not in theſe two foreſayde places, ſpeake onely of theſe eaters. which abyde not in Chriſte, nor Chriſte in them?

yet for all that, they eate not the ſame meate that other doeth, effectually and profitably. And that eatynge only it is, whiche Saint Auſten doeth here denie, and none other. and yet not with ſtanding, that he denieth not here but only that eatinge of Chriſtes very body, whiche fayleth not in deede, but only in thoſe, that abyde not in Chriſte, nor Chriſte in them, becauſe they abuſe them ſelues ſo wickedly, Frith wolde needes for all that, vnderſtande hym, as thoughe he had denied that eatinge therof, whiche houldeth and is in all of lawfull age, bothe good and bad euen generally. And therfore herein, how falſe his vnderſtanding is, it may well appere by thys that Saint Auſten maketh here no mention of the whole multitude of eaters therof in generall, but onlye of one parte of them, whiche are but a certayne ſorte in ſpeciall.

whiche ſome time is not able to keepe that it taketh, or letted wyth anie other impediment, whereby they can not, or conueniently may not haue it. And the only reall eatinge, is in thoſe, that receueth the holy Sacramente not abiding in Chriſt, nor chriſt in them, becauſe of their paruerſe behauour and wicked ſtate. Of whome onlye (as I ſayd) and of their not eating, Saynt Auſten doeth here ſpeake, and of none other. Thirdly, the eating both reall and ſpirituall together, is in them that doeth receyue the holy Sacrament, not only actually, and therefore therin the body of chriſt really, as the naughty ſorte doeth, but alſo in a right fayth, with a pure conſcience, &amp; a contrite harte, ſpiritually, as the other for lacke therof doth not. Wherefore, of Chriſtes bleſſed body, this many maner of eatinges there be.

                  Although it be harde to tell the why, for thynſuffitiēcie of our engliſhe tongue yet for the beſt declaration therof, that I can make, thou ſhalt vnderſtande, that for this latyn worde Corpus, we haue this englyſhe worde, bodye. And for this latyn worde Corporale (which commeth of Corpus) becauſe we haue no proper Engliſhe worde for that, we borrow therof this worde corporall, whiche geueth any thynge to be vnderſtande, partayninge to a body, according to the order of nature, as accidentall qualites doeth. And farther more lykewyſe, for this latyn worde Caro, we

haue thys Engliſhe worde, fleſh. But for this latin worde carnale (whiche commeth of caro) becauſe we haue no Engliſhe worde for that nother, ſo proper as is able euen aptly and fully to counteruayle the ſignification therof, we therfore borrow of it, this worde carnall, as we do of corporale, corporall. Which wordes, both corporall and carnall, althoughe they be no Engliſhe wordes properlie, yet by vſe, they are growne into ſuche acquayntaunce wyth many, (although not learned in the latin tongue) that they know, or haue a great geſſe, what they meane and ſignifie. And that in thys caſe, is what ſo euer (as I ſayd) partayneth to a body or fleſhe naturally. Whiche ſome doeth Engliſhe wyth theſe wordes, bodylie and fleſhlie, althoughe thoſe be the proper Engliſhe wordes, not of corporale and carnale, but of corporaliter and carnaliter. whyche doeth ſome what differ from corporale and carnale. Therefore when we eate the bleſſed body of chriſt in the holy ſacrament, we may no more ſay, that we eate it corporally or bodyly (and yet eate it verily). Then, when we eate therein (as we do in deede) hys verie fleſhe, we maye ſay therof, that we eate it carnallie or fleſhly. For ſo we eate it, as we ought to vnderſtand it. And we ought not to vnderſtād it carnally, nor fleſhly. For if we do, then we vnderſtand it after the fleſh, which the doctrine of the holie apoſtle dothe vtterly forbid, as I haue declared vnto thee al redy. And therefore as the fleſhe, and after the fleſhe, is two thinges. So the body, and after the bodie is to thinges likewiſe. And as the vnderſtandinge of the fleſhe after the fleſhe, is none other but to vnderſtande it carnallye or fleſhelie, So the vnderſtanding of the

body after the body, is none other, but to vnderſtande it corporally or bodyly. Wherfore, as it is proued bothe by Saynt Auſten and alſo by Saynt Paule before, that we may not vnderſtande Chriſtes holy fleſhe after the fleſh, that is to ſay, not carnally nor fleſhly, ſo we may not vnderſtande his bleſſed body, after the body nother, that is to ſay, not corporally nor bodyly. For after one rule, they muſt be vnderſtande bothe of them, whiche rule the holie apoſtle doeth geue vs, where he ſaythe (as before is alledged.)
                  
                     2. cor. 5,
                     Although we haue knowne chryſte after the fleſhe, yet we do not ſo now.
                  
                  Therfore if we may not know Chriſte now, after the fleſhe, we may not now, vnderſtand him after the fleſh. For we can not knowe him one way, and vnderſtande him an other way. Therefore if we may not vnderſtand him after the fleſhe, then we may not vnderſtande hym after the body. For that is fleſhe. Wherfore as it is none other to vnderſtande him after the fleſhe, but to vnderſtande him carnally or fleſhly, ſo it is none other (as I ſayde before) to vnderſtande him after the body, but to vnderſtand him corporally or bodely. And for that cauſe, as we are by the apoſtle, forbyd the vnderſtandinge of him after the one, ſo we are likewiſe in the ſame, forbyd the vnderſtanding of him after the other. And therefore, how woldeſt thou haue me graunte a corporall eatinge of Chriſtes body, or to be eaten corporally, whē we may not vnderſtande it corporally? for we may not eate it after one ſorte, and vnderſtande it after an other, leaſt we make a diſcrepance or a variete in the thinge, whiche in the verite of it ſelfe, is none other in our eatinge, then

in our vnderſtandinge, nor in our vnderſtandinge, then in our eatinge of it, but all one. For although a body can not be by nature corporally or bodyly, except it be verylie, yet, by poſſibilite, it may be verely, althoughe it be not corporally or bodely, but as Chriſtes body in the Sacrament is. For verely, riſeth of the ſubſtaunce. And corporally or bodely riſeth of the naturall qualites thervnto annexed. Whiche in hys bleſſed body are ſupernaturally chaynged. And therefore it is ſufficient for vs to beleue, that (as the trewth is) we eate his body in the Sacrament verely, althoughe we eate it not corporally or bodylie. That is to ſay, not after a corporall or a bodylie maner, becauſe to be eaten of vs, it nether doeth nor yet needeth, to behaue it ſelfe after that ſorte.

                  Why ſyr, how is it poſſible to be trew, but that, when it is eaten verely, it muſt needes be eaten corporally and bodylie? for a very body, muſt be very bodylie eaten, or els it can not be eaten in deede.

                  How can a thinge be corporall and be not a bodie? for a body can not be but corporall, nother anie thing be corporall, but a body.

                  Thy dreame runneth not, but alway vpon the common courſe of nature. And yet euen therin thou art deceyued to: for quantite is a corporall thinge, but yet not corpus that is to ſay, not a bodie for all that, but in, or of a body as a certayne thinge appertayning vnto it. Alſo colour is a corporall thinge to, but yet not corpus, or a body nother. And ſo likewiſe of forme, figure, and all other ſenſible obiectes and qualites what ſo euer they be. for euery one of them is corporall, and yet none of them corpus or a bodie, but only pertayning or naturally belonginge to a body. And therefore they are called corporall qualites.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Then belike, ye cal that corpus or a body, wher in all thoſe thinges be.

                  No not ſo nother. For we cal that, ſubſtance, and not a body.

                  Then what call you a body?

                  Not ſubſtance by it ſelfe, nor thoſe accidentall quantites and qualites by them ſelues nother, but ſubſtance and they ioyned naturally together. For then it is corpus, that is to ſay, a body, or els in the order of nature, no very body indede. And therfore this worde corporall, ſerueth ſo indifferently to them

that it may be ſayd ſome tyme of the one, and ſome time of the other. That is to ſay, ſome tyme of the ſubſtance, and ſome time of thaccidentall quantite and qualites.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  And why not of them bothe or all together?
               
               
                  CATH.
                  Becauſe it is then, corpus, or a body, whych worde commonly, in the courſe of nature, extendeth in ſygnification properly, to no leſſe then all the whole together, and not to any of the partes particulerly by them ſelues.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Yet then I may ſay, that the Sacrament it ſelfe is at the leaſt a corporall ſubſtance, althoughe it be (as you ſay) not a body.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  How canſt thou ſay ſo, when it lacketh nothinge els of a bodye but onlie that? For there is none other cauſe why, that it is not a bodie, but becauſe it hath not a proper ſubſtance, as other quantites and qualites hath, wherein they be.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  If it be not a corporall ſubſtance, how coulde I ſee and feele it as I do?

                  As thou ſeeſt and feeleſt all other corporal thinges. Wherof, any corporal ſubſtance, thou neuer ſaweſt in al thy life. For it is but only the quantites &amp; qualites that thou or any man els, doeth or can ſe of any thinge, &amp; not the ſubſtance it ſelfe, which is alway of it ſelfe and by it ſelf inſenſible.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Yet by thoſe quantites and qualites, I do ſuerly know, that there is a ſubſtance, wherin they be, when I ſee them.

                  CATH.
                  In that thou muſt except the holy Sacrament. Which is alone, and without the like, among all ſenſible thinges that are in our knowledge: Of the whiche Sacrament, what if I wolde ſay this, that the ſame whiche we ſee, is a corporall thynge, and

not a body. And yet hath in it a body, that is not corporall?
               
               
                  HERE.
                  If ye wolde ſo ſay, it were ſtrayngely ſpoken. How be it, if you wolde ſo ſay in deede, your meaning therof, I wolde take to be this. That there, is corporalite without a body. And a body without corporalite.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  Take it euen ſo?
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Then ye meane the corporallite without a body, to be of the Sacrament in the only reſpecte of it ſelfe. And the body without corporalite, to be the thynge of the Sacrament, whiche you ſay, is the very body of Chriſte really and preſently conteyned therin. Is it not this that ye meane?
               
               
                  CATH.
                  Forth with thy purpoſe, and then I will tel thee more.
               
               
                  HER.
                  My purpoſe is this. If Chriſtes very body in the Sacrament, be without corporalite, beinge the ſame bodie (as you ſay it is) whiche is in heauen, it muſt needes folow that Chriſtes bodie in heauen, is of no corporall ſubſtance. For without corporalite, there can be no ſubſtance corporall. And therefore conſequently, yf it be of no corporall ſubſtance, then it is no body at all. For with out, a corporall ſubſtance, no bodie can be.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  Firſt whether thou put the caſe of his bleſſed body, in heauen, or els in the holy Sacrament, all that is one to me. For I put no difference betwene them in the verite thereof, but that it is the very ſame in the one place, that it is in the other. And therfore if thou put thys worde corporall to that ſubſtance, for to ſhow a diſtinction or a difference betwene the ſubſtance thereof, and the incorporall ſubſtance of an Angell or a ſpirite, I holde well wyth all.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  And wyth no cauſe els but only that?
               
               
                  CATH.
                  Yes trewly, and that is thys. If thou put it alſo to that ſubſtance, and call it corporall, meanynge it to be

corporall, by reaſon of a ſupernartual connection of that ſubſtance, and ſuche ſupernaturall quantitee and qualitees together, as are beyonde al therperience and reche of any mortall mans wit, reaſon, or vnderſtandyng, I holde ſo well with that to, that I will here none of you all, what ſo euer ye wolde feyne or ſay to the contrarie. But if thou meane it corporall, by reaſon of any ſuche mortall, and corruptible quantitee and qualitee, as there is none other in thy body and myne, or in any other mortall creature liuynge, I deny it vtterly to be corporall ſo, or to haue ſo muche as any beynge, other in the ſacrament or in heauen other, after that ſorte. For your dreamyng of ſuche maner of corporalitee in him, is alſo an other cauſe why, then I tolde the of before, that theſe madde, and hereticall phanſies hath ryſen among you, ſaiyng and aſkyng, what, Chriſtes very body preſently in the ſacrament? what, ſo great a quantitee in ſo little a ſpace? what, before my face and ſee it not? what, haue it in my handes and fele it not? what, receiue it, eate it, and taſte it not? what, here and there one body in ſo many places at once? who wolde beleue this? And ſo ye conclude with your capteyne Fryth, where he ſaith in the .76. leafe of his booke,
                  It is no article of our crede (ſaith he) and therfore let them7 beleue it that will.
                  A goodly concluſion and euen lyke not onely him ſelfe, but alſo all the reſt of his folowers. How be it, by this it maie well appere, what maner of fruictes they bee, whiche ye haue gathered out of ſuche corporalitee in Chriſte, as ye dreame alway vpon in your ſelues.
                  And no meruaile why, when ye will nedes make your deceiuable

ſenſes (whiche beguildeth you dayly) to be the iudges and guydes of your faith, in ſuche diuine miſteries.

                  Why ſir, be there not of your ſorte, and euen in the ſame beleue that you be of, that doth both ſay and wryt, that Chriſte hath euen now, a naturall body, and that it is of a corporall ſubſtaunce?
               
               
                  CATH.
                  I graunt no leſſe. But what of that? thinkeſt thou therfore, that when they cal his body a natural body, they meane it ſuche a naturall body as ours are, within the compaſſe and common order of nature? or when they call it a corporall ſubſtance, that they meane it corporal, by reaſon of any ſuch corporall quantitees &amp; qualites as our bodies hath, which bodies are yet, by thē &amp; with them, ſubiect vnto death and corruption?
               
               
                  HER.
                  If they do not ſo mean, why do they put thoſe wordes naturall and corporall to it, whiche dooth none otherwiſe ſygnifie: and not rather forbyd them to be vſed, when the ſignificaciō of them, is to their meaning ſo contrary?
               
               
                  CATH.
                  I ſhall tell the why. Fyrſte, becauſe there be no proper woordes for the thinges that they meane by them, except they ſhould call naturall ſupernatural, and corporall ſupercorporall. Wherof allthough ſupernaturall, hath ſome vſe monge them that be learned, yet is it farre, both from the vſe and alſo the vnderſtandynge of them, that be vnlearned. But as for this woorde ſupercorporall, playne it is, that that was neuer in vſe among the vnlearned, nor yet among the learned nother, becauſe there is not founde any ſuche

woord of that compoſicion.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Then were they beſt, to bringe both thoſe woordes into an vſe, whereby they might expreſſe directly what they meane, and not there, to vſe thoſe other woordes, whiche dooth ſignify the contrary or inſufficientlie.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  No not ſo. for where they put this woord naturall, if they ſhoulde put ſupernaturall, and where they put corporall, if they ſhoulde put ſupercorporall, althoughe moſte of ſuch as be learned, coulde well awaie with all, yet the greate multitude of the vnlearned, ſhould by that, be rather prouoked to the miſtruſt and doubt of the verytee of the thynge, then to the fyrme credence and faſt beleefe therof, if ſuche ſtraynge woordes, were ioyned vnto it, as they for lacke of knowledge were not able to vnderſtande, nor coulde awaie withall. For thoſe words ſupernaturall and ſupercorporall, coulde not be brought amonge them into ſuch a familiar vſe, as might leade them any nere the vnderſtandynge or beleeuynge of the veritee of the thyng, then the other words doth, nor ſo nere nother, they beyng vnlearned as they are. Wherfore it were without wiſdome, all reaſon, and diſcreacion, to ioygne ſuche woordes vnto that (whiche of neceſſitee they ought to beleue) as might rather brynge them in dout, and the thynge out of credence, then to confyrme them in their faith as the trewth thereof doth require. And therfore theſe woordes naturall and corporall, doth much better ſerue the purpoſe in that reſpect, then the other could dooe amonge them, if they be well vnderſtande, and trewly conſidered, wherfore learned men doth put them there.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Why, wherfore is that?
               
               
                  CAT.
                  Not to ſhow or

ſignifie the ſtate or maner of the thinge, but moſt certeinly to confirme and ratifie the veritee therof. For the verytee of Chriſtes bleſſed body in the holie ſacrament is the thynge, that we are bounde to beleue, And not after what maner or ſorte it is there, whiche paſſeth the reache of all mens wittes, but not of his power, whiche firſte ſaid the woorde, and tolde vs ſo muche of the matter, as is cleane out of doubte, except it be with them whiche doth therein miſtruſt, and not beleue him.
                  Wherefore beſide all this, if theſe woordes naturall and corporall, were in this caſe put cleane away, and not vſed of good and catholyke men, to be ioyned vnto it, as they are are, how lyke is it, that ſome of you, wolde ſone reyſe vp againe, this olde very peſtilent hereſye of the Manicheis, whiche ſaid that Chriſte had but a phantaſticall bodie, and no very body in deede. For that moſt wicked errour, is not conuinced and put away, by any wordes, more clerely then by the words natural and corporal. For when by them, the body is called a natural body, &amp; of a corporal ſubſtance, that doth declare it plainly, not to be phantaſtical, but euen very eſſencial. And therfore one of the chiefe cauſes why catholike mē do vſe to put thoſe words vnto it, is to preuent, &amp; ſuppreſſe that curſed hereſie, from riſynge any more agayne. And an other cauſe is (as I ſaide before) to confyrme and ſtabliſhe the faith of the multitude, in the veritee of the thinge, And not to declare therby the maner of beynge and qualitees therof (whiche farre paſſeth our knowledge) nor to ſhow any ſuche naturalitee or corporalite, to be in it, as we haue in our bodies, ſubiect to the order and courſe of nature, by reaſon wherof, we are now

and then, compelled euen to ſuſtayne, diuers diſpleaſures.

                  Yes that I haue.

                  It ſemeth ſo. But yet if thou conſider it well, thou ſhalt finde it his quantitee, and nothing els. For if his quantitee had bene ſo ſubiect to his power, as his power was to his quantite, he might haue vſed his quantitee then, according to his will. For any man may vſe what ſo euer is in his power, as he will &amp; liſt him ſelfe. And therfore if he might haue vſed his quā
                     titee according to his will, it was not the ſtockes, yrons, nor the pryſon nother, that could haue holden him therin, when he wolde haue bene away. wherfore it was his quantitee (not being ſubiect to his power) that kept him there againſt his will. And therfore wilt thou thinke that chriſt hath the quantite of his holy body after that ſorte?

                  Why ſyr, this muſt needes be trew, that of the length, bredth, and depth of it, an ynch can be none other, no more, nor leſſe, then an ynche. And a foote, none other

no more nor leſſe, then a foote. And the hole, none other, no more, nor leſſe then the hole. Nor the leaſt part of it, none other no leſſe nor no more then the leaſt part. And this order of quantitee holdeth (as it muſt nedes do) in euery mans body likewyſe.

                  Thou doeſt yet dreame ſtill (I perceiue) vpon the common order of nature, and nothing els. Accordyng to the which, quantitee hath alſo this propertee, that alway the more, muſt needes conteyne the leſſe. And the hole all the partes thereof. But what if the quantitee of Chriſtes bleſſed body be now of this ſorte, that the leſſe maie conteine the more. And euery part the hole?
               
               
                  HER.
                  That is impoſſible.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  Not ſo impoſſible, as it is for the to beleue it, ſo longe as thou doſt thinke it impoſſible.
                  But neuertheleſſe, thou and I maie chaunce, although not now, yet hereafter, to aſſaie what maie be ſayde to the poſſibilitee thereof. Where as for this tyme, this may be ſufficient, that Chriſtes bleſſed body is now without doubt ſupernaturall. And therfore other it is all hole ſupernatural, or els but in parte. If it be ſupernatural but in parte, then is the reſt of it, vnder the yeoke and bondage of nature ſtill, which (I ſuppoſe) were wickednes to thinke. Wherfore of the other ſyde, if it be all hole ſupernaturall, as it is in deed, then there is no part of it, but muſt nedes be ſupernaturall likewyſe. And therefore if there be no part of it, but ſupernatural, then muſt the quantitee thereof nedes be ſupernatural to. for that is a certaine parte of it, except thou wilt ſay (as I thinke thou wilt not) that it is without any quantitee at all.
                  Wherfore if the quantitee therof be ſupernaturall, as it muſt nedes be, this maie well folow, that as the bondage

of naturalitee in naturall bodies, compelleth the more quantitee, to conteine the leſſe, and the hole, all the partes, ſo the liberte of ſupernaturalite in Chriſtes ſupernaturall body, doth permit and able the leſſe quantitee, to conteyne the more, and euery parte the hole. For a dyfference to be betwene quantitee, naturall, and ſupernaturall, thou muſt nedes graunt. And as for anie other difference betweene them then this, I ſuppoſe thou ſhalt not be able to fynde anye.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Yes ſyr that I can. for quantitee naturall, is of neceſſitee vyſyble, and ſo is not quantitee ſupernaturall.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  Although it were euen ſo as thou ſaieſt, yet that coulde make no proper difference betwene them.
                  For althoughe ſome quantitee naturall, be of neceſſitee vyſyble, yet all is not ſo. For the naturall quantitee of the ayer, nother is nor can be viſible, when the hole body of the ayer it ſelfe, is inuiſible. And therefore how ſhould viſibilitee, and inuiſibilitee make a difference betwene quantitee naturall and quantitee ſupernaturall, when bothe maie be founde in one of them? That is to ſay, in quantitee naturall.
               
               
                  HER.
                  Then this maie be the dyfference betweene them. That quantitee ſupernaturall is perpetuall, and hath a beynge for euer. But ſo hath not quantytee naturall.

                  Why ſaieſt thou ſo? For as the earth is perpetuall and ſhall haue a beynge for euer, ſo the naturall quantitee thereof muſt nedes haue and be lykewyſe. Wherefore perpetuitee can bee no proper difference betweene them nother, when it is and maie be founde in eache of them, And therefore ſeeke as longe as thow wylt, harde

it ſhalbe for the (as I ſayd) to fynde any other dyfference betwene them, then I haue ſhowed the. Or if there be any other, yet they let not, but this maie be one for all that. Wherfore if this be one, that the leſſe quantitee maie conteyne the more, and euery parte, the hole, where is your hereticall obiection become, that ye ſaie ſo great a quantitee as Chriſtes bodie is of, can not be in ſo little a ſpace, as the ſacrament dooth occupie? as who ſay, he can therin none otherwyſe be, or do, then ye can vnderſtand.

                  Syr, how ſo euer he can be or do, or we can vnderſtande, well I wot, that ſo great a quantitee to be in ſo little ſpace, is far againſt reaſon.

                  Then if thou wilt not be ſatiſfied, with that I haue ſaide alredy, tel me this. how are all thinges new in him, if his quantitee be olde, that is to ſay, of the olde ſorte, as it was before his reſurrection? For dooth not the holy apoſtle, after he had ſayd,
                  
                     2. cor. 5
                     Although we haue knowne Chriſte after the fleſhe, yet we do not ſo now.
                  
                  Adde vnto it and ſay this.
                  If there be any new creature in Chriſte, the olde thinges are paſt and gone.
                  And that he confirmeth with theſe woordes.
                  Beholde (he ſaith) all are made new.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Ye ſyr, all that he ſpeaketh, for as muche as perteyneth to the ſpirite of them, that trewly foloweth Chriſte. But not for any thynge that perteyneth to the fleſhe.
               
               
                  CATHOLI.
                  Wilt thou ſaie ſo,

when he doeth euen there make mencion of Chriſtes fleſhe? wherefore therin, thou ſayeſt not well, For he ſpeaketh it bothe of Chriſte, for ſo muche as partayneth to the newnes of him in fleſhe, and alſo of them, that trewlie folow him, for ſo muche as pertayneth to the newneſſe of them in ſpirit. That is to ſay, in ſpirite now, and in fleſhe then, when they ſhal riſe agayne and be made all new, not only in ſpirit, but alſo in fleſhe, Where as now they are all new, not in fleſhe but onelie in ſpirit. And therfore the minde of the apoſtle is there, to declare, that as Chriſte is now all new in fleſhe, for ſo muche as partaineth to the mortal and corruptible ſtate of the quantite and qualites thereof, ſo muſt thoſe that trewly folow him, be now all new in ſpirite, that they might here after at the latter day, be likewiſe all new in fleſhe, as he is now.
                  
                     Who ſhall then as the apoſtle ſayeth,Phili. 3, tranſforme the low ſtate of theyr bodies into the likeneſſe of the glorious ſtate of his bodye, accordinge to the operation of his power, wherby he is able to make all thynges obedient vnto hys will, as it appereth to the Philippians. Cap. 3.
                  
                  Wherfore if thou ſay that Chriſtes holy fleſh, hath in it now, ſuche quantite, as it had before his reſurrectiō, Thou ſayeſt none other therin, but that it is olde. And therefore if thou ſay that it is olde, then thou denieſt it playne to be new. And if thou denie it to be new, then thou arte therin directly agaynſt the holy Apoſtle, whiche doeth partelie therof ſay, as before is alledged. The olde thinges are gone and paſt, beholde all are made new.
                  
                  Therefore what thinges are made new in Chriſtes fleſhe, but the corruptible quantite and qualites therof?

for when he ſayeth.
                  Althoughe we haue knowne chriſt after the fleſhe, yet we do not ſo now.
                  He doeth not therein denie him to haue fleſhe, but to be knowen after the fleſhe. Therefore what other thinge is it, not to know him after the fleſhe, but not to knowe him after the former courſe and olde ſtate of the fleſhe, as it was before his reſurrection, whyche is now altered, chaynged, and made new, farre after an other ſorte. And therefore when the quantite and qualites of hys bleſſed fleſhe, in the time of the paſſibilite, and mortalite thereof, were for all that, euen then obedient and ſubiecte vnto hys holy will, farre beyonde and contrarie to the common courſe of nature, as I declared vnto thee before, And when they are (farthermore) euen now in the tyme of hys glorification, made new, and chaynged ſo farre into ſuche an other ſtate, as paſſeth the vnderſtandinge of any mortall mannes witte, why dremyſt thou (not wythſtandynge all thys) vpon anie ſuche naturalite and corporalite to be in it, as is in ours, or was in hys, before his reſurrection, when (the verye trewth to ſay) that ſame naturalite, is now turned into ſupernaturalite, and that corporalite, into ſupercorporalite, yf I might ſo call it? Leaue therefore thy muſinge and beholdinge of any courſe of nature in thys caſe, whiche courſe of nature hath herein nothing to do. For ſo longe as thou doeſt wey the matter after that and ſeekeſt none other rule to folow then ſo, it is not poſſible for thee to come by the trewth and to beleue therin, as thou oughteſt to doo.

I pray you this, who is able by anie reaſon to vnderſtande, how any of them bothe, that is to ſay, other the body or the fleſhe, ſhould or may haue anie beyng at all after thys ſorte, that ye ſpeake of? for how is it poſſible to vnderſtande a mannes body or fleſhe to be, wythout what ſo euer is corporall or carnall? That is to ſaye, wythout ſuche quantitee and qualites as perteyneth vnto them, by the courſe of nature? ſpeciallie, when we haue no knowledge of them at all, but that it is fyrſte gotten, by ſuche maner of thynges, as belongeth vnto them naturallie?

Wherof (as I ſayd before, and as Frithe doeth declare) this muſt folowe, that Chriſtes very body and his very fleſhe, is not in the Sacrament really and preſentely. For if it were, they

ſhoulde eate that, when they eate the Sacrament.

                  Thou ſayeſt euen trew. And therefore that ſame one worde ſpiritually, was the verie thinge, that cauſed Frithe to refuſe this place of Saynt Auſten, and to runne to thoſe other two places, wherein that worde ſpiritually was not expreſſed. By reaſon wherof, Frithe had in them ſome hope, where as in this, he had none at all. For he perceyuinge this place to ſpeake preciſely, and expreſſely of one eating that is ſpeciall, (whiche geueth an other to be vnderſtand, that is general) thought, that if he ſhould make his allegation thereof, it wolde geue an occaſion, of a great interruption of all his purpoſe. And therefore he toke the other two places, (which (as he thought) ſemed to deny the very eatinge that is generall) to ſerue hys turne farre better then this, whiche doeth expreſſe the ſpeciall. Wherin he clerely deceyued him ſelf, as it may well appere by this, that Saynt Auſten doeth euen here, the verie ſame that he doeth there, ſpeake onely, (as I ſayde) of one ſorte of eaters in ſpeciall, and not of all ingenerall. Wherfore the ſame eatinge that S. Auſten

doeth meane there, muſt nedes be vnderſtande of thys eatinge, whiche he doeth expreſſe here. For indeede they be all one, as the ſpeciall ſtate and ſorte of the eaters is, of whome he ſpeaketh in all three places.

wrote any thynge vnto them, that is to ſaie vnto heretikes (becauſe they lacke both trewth and alſo good wil to) he left therfore no parte of his minde vnexpreſſed (ſo farre as the matter requyred, wherin he procured their amendment) but did at large, with ſuche plaineneſſe ſo ſet it foorth vnto them, that they them ſelues could haue no doubt of his meanynge, although they were neuer ſo vnwillyng to take any profyte of his playne ſaiynge.
                  This he vſed alway vnto them, but not alway ſo vnto vs. Becauſe in vs, there was no ſuche neede. For we, by his expreſſe and manifeſt ſpeakynge of this matter in ſome place, do ryght well know his trew ſecret and ſylent meanynge therof (although not expreſſed) in euery other place. Wherin we doo not as ye wolde do if ye myght.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  What is that?

                  Ye wold hyde, and ouerthrow that, whiche is very certaine and manifeſt, by that, whiche ſeemeth vncertaine and ſecret. But we contrariwyſe, as reaſon compelleth vs, do ſhow and defend that, whiche ſeemeth incertaine and ſecret, by that, whiche is moſte certaine and manifeſt. For where Saint Auſten ſaith.
                  
                     They that abyde not in Chriſte, nor Chriſte in them, eateth not his fleſhe nor drinketh his blood, although they eate and drynke the ſacrament of ſo great a thynge.
                  
                  Becauſe he expreſſeth not there, euen certainely what maner of eatyng it is that he meaneth (wherefore ſome, are therof in doubt) we may and iuſtly do, way that place by this, where he ſaith.
                  
                     He that abideth not in Chriſte, and in whom Chriſte abydeth not, without doubt he eateth not his fleſh ſpiritually, nor drinketh his blood.
                  
                  By this place therfore, we waie the other, becauſe he

excludyng all doubt in this, doth plainely expreſſe what maner of eatyng it is, that he doth meane in the other, wherein he dooth but leaue it to men of good wyll to be vnderſtande, who neuer faileth to take it ryght.
                  Therefore when that maner of eatynge, whyche he dooth meane, is made very certaine in the one place and not ſo in the other. That is to ſay, plainely expreſſed in the one place, and not expreſſed in the other, why dyd Fryth alledge him in that place, where it is not expreſſed (ſith in that maner of eatynge lyeth all the matter) and wolde not alledge him in the other place, where it is expreſſed, and put cleane out of queſtion? what other why (as I ſayde before) can there be found in his ſo doinge, but onely falſhed? For who wòulde take a mannes tale to witneſſe, where he ſpeaketh but obſcurely or incerteinly, and vtterly refuſe it there, where he ſpeaketh it full, hole, and plainly? any man els, but onely Frithe, and ſuch as he was? for the plaine place he wilt well, he could nother ouerthrow, nor yet wrynge it to anye apparence of his purpoſe.
                  But the obſcure and ambiguous place, he thought he might wreſt, whiche waie he liſte, and ſo to make many beleue (as he did in deede) that it ſufficientlye ſerued his turne.

                  Yet ye confeſſe that place of Saint Auſten whiche Frythe dooth alledge, to be obſcure and ambiguous.

                  Ye to them, that lacketh good wyll or knowledge. But not to them, (as I ſayde) whiche be learned and of the catholyke ſayth. Wherefore, thus maieſt thou ſee, Why Frith alledged that place of Saint Auſten and not this, ſo craftylie as he dyd. Whiche was no more but onely

becauſe, when he ſaw, there was made therein, no ſpeciall mencion by name of the reall eatynge, whiche is moſte common and generall, nor yet of the ſpyrytuall eatynge, whiche is more ſinguler and ſpecyall, but of eatynge ſymplie, without anie dyrecte or proper diſtinction, he thought he myght vnderſtande of them bothe, whiche he lyſt, or els take it, as thoughe there had bene none other maner of eatynge thereof, but euen verie one alone. And thereuppon he did take that place to be no leſſe, then enoughe, and very ſufficient to proue his purpoſe.
                  As I graunt it had beene in deede, if it had beene after that ſorte to be vnderſtande, as he tooke it.
                  But he looked ſo muche vpon this poynte, that he founde there no mencion made of anie dyſtynction of eatynges (whereby he thought he myght take (as I ſayde) whyche he lyſte or one for all) that he forgat, what mencion Saynt Auſten made there, of the diſtynctyon (although not of eatynges, yet for all that) of eaters, whiche was enoughe, to ſhow what maner of eatynge he mente. For as his manifeſt ſpeakynge was there, of a peculiar ſorte of eaters, ſo his very meanynge, muſte needes be vnderſtande of a peculiar maner a eatynge.
                  For it is agaynſt all reaſon and trewthe, to denye that to ſome, whiche is common to all, or to graunte that to all, which perteyneth but to ſome. And therfore, thou maiſt well know, that Saint Auſten wolde not do ſo. For he denyed not there, but onely that eatynge, whiche apperteyneth vnto ſome, and not vnto all.
                  
                     That is to ſay, only to them that be good, and not vnto them that he nought. Of whom there, he dooth make mecion, and of none other. For the libertee real of eating perteyneth both to good and bad. But the ſpirituall eatyng perteyneth to none but onely to them that be good.

                     All this that our lorde ſpake, of his fleſhe and his blood, And that in the grace of diſtribucion therof, he promiſed vnto vs lyfe euerlaſtynge, and that therof he wolde to be vnderſtande, that the eaters and drinkers of his fleſhe and blood, ſhould abyde in him and he in them, And that they did not vnderſtande, whiche did not beleue, And that they were offended, by vnderſtandynge ſpirituall thinges carnally, And that they beyng offended and perylſhynge, the comforte of our lorde was preſent to the diſciples which did abide, vnto the probacion of whom he aſked, wil you go away, that the anſwere of their abiding might be alſo knowen to vs, for he knew them whiche did abide. All this therefore, moſt deerely beloued, auayleth vnto vs for this purpoſe, that we ſhoulde not eate the fleſhe of Chriſte and the blood of Chriſte onely in the ſacramente (whiche many doth that be nought) but that we ſhoulde eate and drynke it, vnto the part taking of the ſpirite, that wee ſhoulde abyde as membres in the body of our Lorde, that we might be quickned with his ſpirite, And that we ſhould not be offended, although many now, dooth eate and drynke the ſacramentes with vs temporally, whiche ſhall haue in thende tormentes eternall.
                  
                  Now what canſt thou wiſhe more plainely ſpoken, for the reall eatynge and drynkynge of Chriſtes moſt precious fleſhe and blood in the holy ſacramente, then when he ſayth (as here thou ſeeſt) we eate it not onely in the ſacrament? that ſame not onely in the ſacramente, dooth moſte cleerely declare it to be therin euen verely eaten. for he wolde not haue ſaid,

not onely in the ſacrament, but not in the ſacrament. For not in the ſacrament, and not onely in the ſacrament, are two thinges. Not in the ſacrament, denyeth it to bee eaten therein, but not onely in the ſacrament, confeſſeth it to bee eaten therein, and alſo other wiſe to. Wherefore this very reall eatinge of Chriſtes bleſſed fleſh and blood in the holy ſacrament, muſt nedes be common and generall, when (as here S. Auſten ſaith) many doth it, which be nought, whoſe eating therof, thou maieſt well know commeth not to the perticipacion or partaking of the ſpirite that quickneth, when thoſe be they, that abyde not in Chriſte, nor Chriſte in them.
                  And therefore the participacion or partakynge of the ſpirite therin, is and muſt needes be, the ſpirituall eatynge, whiche is not generall, but ſpeciall and proper onely to thoſe, that abyde in Chriſt, and Chriſt in them. as the noughty and euill ſorte dooth not. And yet they in the ſacrament (as Saint Auſten doth here plainly ſay) do eate his fleſhe, and that muſt nedes be really, becauſe it is to playne, that it can not be ſpiritually. Wherfore, here thou haſt now of Saint Auſten plainely expreſſed, and diſtinctlie touched, both the very reall eating, which is common to good and had, and alſo the ſpirituall eatyng, whiche perteyneth to none, but onely to them that be good.

Alſo did Iudas the wicked traytour and ſeller of his maiſter, although he did (as Luke the Euangelyſte dooth apertlie declare) eate and drynke with the other diſciples the ſame ſacrament of his fleſhe and blood when it was firſt made in his owne hands, abide in chriſt and chriſte in him? farthermore, there be many, that euen with a feigned hart, do eate that fleſhe and drinke that blood, or when they haue eate and drinke it, forſake

ther fayth, abyde they in Chriſte, and Chriſte in them? but in very deede ther is a certayne maner of eatyng that fleſhe and drynkynge that blood, whereby, he that eateth it and drynketh it, abydeth in Chryſte and Chriſte in him. Therfore not in what ſo euer maner, anye man eateth the fleſhe of Chriſte, and drinketh the blood of Chriſte, abideth in chriſte, and chriſte in him. But in a certaine maner which maner he ſaw, when he ſpake theſe woordes.
                  If thou be not here now euen thorowly ſatiſfyed, both as touching the certeintee and alſo the difference, of theſe two eatings and drinkings of Chriſts moſt bleſſed fleſhe and blood, that is to ſay, both of the reall eating, and alſo of the ſpirituall eating of it, it is not Saint Auſten, nor all the other holy fathers beſyde, that therein can ſatiſfy the. For no man can more plainly expreſſe them, then he doth here diſtinctly deuyde and ſhow them.

Abraham (he ſaith) did eate his body and drynke his blood thorow faith.

                  It was not neceſſarie, that the woordes ſhould ſo be vnderſtand as they ſound.
                  That is to ſay, he wold not haue it ſo taken, that theſe words of eating &amp; drinking, ſhould, as they ſound, be vnderſtand of the very reall eating and drinking of chriſtes

owne fleſhe and bloud in deede, but only of the fayth and beleuing in him, as it appereth in the .17. lefe of his boke where he ſayth.
                  
                     Who ſo euer dwelleth in Chriſte, (that is to ſay) beleueth that he is ſent of god to ſaue vs from our ſinnes) doeth verelie eate and drinke his body and bloud, althoughe he neuer receyue the ſacrament. This (ſayeth he) is the ſpiritual eating neceſſarie for all that ſhalbe ſaued.
                  
                  And in the .47. leafe.
                  
                     As for, our faythe (he ſayth) it nedeth not to haue him preſent in the breade. For I may (ſayeth he) as well eate hym and drinke hym thorow fayth, that is to ſay, beleue in him as thoughe he were as preſentlie in the Sacrament as he was hanginge on the croſſe.
                  
                  Now therfore by this, you may perceyue that Frithe (as I ſayde) doeth vnderſtande none other by all thoſe wordes of eatinge and drinking of that fleſhe and bloud, but only ſpirituall eatinge and drinkinge of it in faythe. That is to ſay, onelie beleuing without any reall eating of it at all.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  What, in ſo many places, and ſo diuerſly, as our Sauiour Chriſte him ſelfe, his holy apoſtles, and al the other holy fathers of the Catholike churche, doeth ſpeake of it, in thoſe playne wordes of eatinge and drinkinge? And when none of them all, doeth ſo declare it, nor teache it? as in witneſſe whereof, it dothe in the wordes of S. Auſten, laſt recited before, very clerely appere, if thou remember them well. When therein he ſayeth, that thoſe doeth eate the ſame fleſhe and drinke the ſame bloud, of whome the holy Apoſtle doeth ſaye, they eate it and drinke it, to theyr dampnation. And playne it is that thoſe, whiche eate it and drinke it to theyr dampnation, doeth nother eate it, not drinke it ſpiritually. For yf they did, it coulde not be to their dampnation,

But to theyr ſaluatiō. Wherfore how ſo euer Frithe doeth take it, ſithe it is cleare by Saynt Auſten, that thoſe, which doth eate it &amp; drink it to their dampnation, doth eate the ſame fleſh and drinke the ſame bloud, and yet not ſpiritually, it muſt therefore needes folow, that they do eate it &amp; drinke it euen in very deede really. Except thou wylt ſay, they eate it not at all, whiche were directly agaynſt Saynt Auſten and Saynt Paule bothe.
                  Farthermore, thou ſhalt vnderſtande, that in Saynt Auſtens dayes, there were many, that came and dyd beleue in the name of Chriſte, whiche were called Cathecumini, that is to ſay, herers or learners. And ſo called becauſe they were not baptiſed, for that they beleued not ſome certayn myſteries in ſome of the Sacramentes. And therfore where the goſpell doeth ſay, that when Chriſt was at Ieruſalem in the tyme of Eaſter, many did beleue in the name of hym, for the myracles they ſaw him do,Iohn. 2. but Ieſus did not commit hym ſelfe vnto them.
                  Saynt Auſten vpon the ſame place doth ſay, that all thoſe be ſuche, whiche are called cathecumini, that is to ſay, herers or learners. For his owne wordes thereof in latin be theſe.
                  
                     Tales ſūt oēs Cathecumini. Ipſi iā credunt in nomine Chriſti Sed Ieſus non ſe credit eis. Intendat &amp; intelligat charitas veſtra. Si dixerimus cathecumino, credis in Chriſto? Reſpondet, credo, et ſignat ſe. Iam crucem chriſti portet in fronte. Et non erubeſcit in cruce domini ſui. Ecce credit in nomine eius. Interrogamus eum, manducas carnem filii hominis &amp; bibis ſanguinē filii hominis? Neſcit quid dicimus, quia Ieſus non ſe

credit ei.
                  
                  Which may thus be engliſhed.
                  
                     Cathecumini are al of the ſame ſort. For they beleue in the name of chriſt. But Ieſus cōmitteth not him ſelf vnto thē. Let your charite marke and vnderſtande. If we ſhall ſay to the cathecumini, doeſt thou beleue in Chryſte? he wyll anſwer and ſay, I beleue, and bleſſeth him ſelf. Now he beareth the croſſe of Chryſt in hys forehead. And is not aſhamed of the croſſe of hys lorde. Beholde, he beleueth in hys name. We aſke hym agayn, doeſt thou eate the fleſh of the ſonne of man, and drinke the bloud of the ſonne of man? he knoweth not what we ſay, becauſe Ieſus hathe not committed hym ſelfe vnto hym.
                  
                  How ſayeſt thou now? what thinge is it, whiche thys Cathecuminus doeth here not know, when he is aſked this playne queſtion of the eating and drinking of Chriſtes moſt bleſſed fleſhe and bloud? The wordes be playn. And therefore what is there in them, that (as Saynt Auſten ſaieth of him) he doeth not know?

                  Ye but what is the ſpirituall eatinge and drinkinge therof?
               
               
                  HERE.
                  It is, as Frithe hath ſayd to beleue in Chriſte.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  To beleue in Chriſte? is it that thinkeſt thou, whiche Saynt Auſten doeth here meane, that (as he ſayeth) this Cathecuminus doeth not know, when he hym ſelfe ſayth of him, that he beleueth in chriſte? Thou mayſt perceyue it can not be ſo. For yf S. Auſten had ment here none other eatinge and drinkynge of it but that, he wolde not haue noted him to be ignorant of his queſtion, when he him ſelfe reporteth

him to beleue in the name of Chriſte. For that were as muche as he requireth, if he had ment nothinge els.
                  Therfore if thou perceyue it not alredy, let vs looke farther what S. Auſten doeth meane, by hys not knowinge. Anie thinge els, but his not beleuinge? And what meaneth Saynt Auſten by his not beleuing, but that he beleueth not accordinge to his aſkyng? And what is it to beleue accordinge to his aſkinge, but to beleue the very eatinge and drinkinge of Chriſtes fleſhe and bloud? for that is the verie playne queſtion, whiche he doeth aſke him. Wherfore that muſt needes be the thinge which the Cathecuminus knoweth not. And that becauſe, he beleueth it not. And therfore it is hys lacke of faithe in the reall eatinge and drinkinge of Chriſtes holy fleſhe and bloud, that Saynt Auſten doeth here finde faute wyth him for. And not for anie other eatinge and drinkinge therof, which as Frithe ſayeth is nothinge els but onely faythe and beleue in Chriſt. Whiche fayth (as Saynt Auſten ſayeth) this Cathecuminus hath, and yet chriſt committeth not him ſelfe vnto hym. Therefore when Saynt Auſten doeth aſke him the queſtion of eatinge and drynkinge of the fleſhe and bloud of the ſonne of man, it is an other eatinge and drinking that he doeth meane and ſpeake of, then this Cathecuminus doeth knowe or beleue, or els he wolde not réprehende hym therein as he doeth. It is an other alſo, then Frith doeth beleue, when he ſayeth a man may vſe it, althoughe he neuer receyue the Sacrament. And therfore what other is it, but euen only the very reall eatinge and drinking of it in the holy Sacrament?
               
            
            
               
               Cap. 41.
               
                  HERE.
                  Why ſyr, doeth not Saynt Auſten ſay as Frithe doeth alledge, in the .17, leafe of hys booke Why prepareſt thou teethe and belly? beleue and thou haſt eaten.
                  
               
               
                  CATH.
                  What of that? wilt thou gather thereof, that there is none other eating of it, but only beleue? Therefore if there be an other, what doeth this make for Frythes purpoſe or thine other? And that there is an other, haue I not proued it all reddie before, by the manifeſt wordes of Saynt Auſten hym ſelfe? Wherefore if thys be trew, (as Frithe doeth ſay it is) that theſe wordes of eatinge and drinking in this matter, meane nothing els but faythe and beleefe, it muſt needes folow, that Saynt Auſten doeth here vniuſtlye reprehende this Cathecuminus, of whome he doeth confeſſe no leſſe hym ſelfe, but that he hath faith and beleueth in the name of chriſt. And beſide that, this muſt alſo folow thereof likewyſe, that when he ſayeth.
                  Beleue and thou haſt eaten.
                  It is no more, nor none other to ſay, but beleue and thou haſt beleued. What reaſon is this? or who wolde thinke S. Auſten to meane ſo?
               
               
                  HER.
                  Why what ſhould he there, meane els?
               
               
                  CATH.
                  Euen as he dothe, which is this. Beleue trewly, and thou haſt eaten ſpiritually.
                  For the ſpiritual eating, commeth not to paſſe, but thorow the whole trewth of beleuing. And the hoole trewth of beleuinge, conſiſteth not in holding ſome partes of the fayth, and denyinge ſome other, but in holdinge them whole, euen altogether. Therefore Saynt auſten

doeth here (as in many other places moe) farther mean then he doeth expreſſe. For where he doeth here (as touching the fayth) no farther ſay, but beleue, yet he meaneth theſe wordes, wholy, and trewly, to be vnderſtande with all. For he meaneth no ſuche beleue, as is mixed or corrupted with any falſhed, or with the lacke of any parte of it. Therefore beſyde thys, he meaneth farther then ſo to. For he meaneth not that ſame beleefe nother, althoughe it be neuer ſo whole and trew whiche is infected with euyll and wycked maners. But he meaneth that, whiche (as the Apoſtle doeth ſay) worketh by charite. Wherfore beleue ſo, and I wyll graunte, that thou haſt eaten, or els not. For withoute that maner of beleuynge (whiche is but accordinge to Saynt Auſtens meaninge) doubtles there can be no ſpirituall eatinge at all. And in that maner of beleuinge, there is and muſt needes be contayned, the verye beleefe of the reall eatinge. For the ſpyrytuall eatinge was not ordeyned for the reall eatynge, but the reall eatynge for the ſpirituall eatynge. And therfore without the very beleefe of the reall eatinge, the ſpirituall eatynge can neuer he had.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Then the ſpirituall eatinge, and the reall eatynge muſt needes go ſo together, that the one can not be wythout the other.
               
               
                  CATHOLICVS.
                  That is not trew, excepte it be in beleefe. For therein they muſt needes go alway together. But els, ſo muche they dyffer, and are ſome tyme a ſonder, that an infidele may chaunce to eate it really, but yet for lacke of faythe, neuer ſpiritually. And a good Chriſten man may eate it ſpiritually, althoughe, thorow ſome lawfull impediment, he eate it not reallie.

Wherefore by thys it is cleare, that all the ſort of you, whyche denieth it (as Frithe doeth) to be eaten really, without doubt do neuer eate it ſpiritually. Wher in your tortuous and eluiſhe doctrine, doeth moſt manifeſtly appere. For ye holde wyth that, whiche ye neuer do. And vtterly deny that, whiche ye dayly do.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  How ſo?
               
               
                  CATH.
                  Ye graunt and holde with the ſpirituall eatinge of Chriſtes holy fleſhe, which eatinge without fayle, ye neuer come to. And ye ſtifly deny the reall eatinge of it, which eatinge in deede ye often and commonly do. And therfore when ye do that, whiche your ſelues denie, how is it done, but vnworthyly? and wherto tendeth that, but (as the Apoſtle ſayeth) to your owne dampnation? but now I let that paſſe,1. cor. 11. and to an other place of Saynt Auſten, where hys owne wordes be theſe.

Qui autem non dum manducant &amp; non dum bibunt, ad tales epulas inuitati feſtiment. Per iſtos dies magiſtratus

Et forte modo cum euangelium legeretur dixiſtis in cordibus veſtris, putamus quid eſt quod dicit, Caro mea vere eſca eſt, &amp; ſanguis meus vere potus eſt? Quomodo manducatur caro domini &amp; bibitur ſanguis domini? Putamus quid dicit? Quis contra te clauſit vt hoc neſcias? Velatum eſt.

Tu autem Cathecuminus diceris, Audiens &amp; ſurdus es. Aures enim corporis patentes habes, quia verba quae dicta ſunt au dis, Sed aures cordis adhuc clauſas habes, quia quod dictum eſt non intelligis.
                     
                  
                  Whiche may thus be Engliſhed.
                  
                     When the holy goſpell was red as wee haue herde, our Lorde Ieſus exhorted vs to the eatinge of his fleſhe and drinkinge of hys bloud, with the promyſe of euerlaſting lyfe. You, whyche haue hearde theſe thynges, do not yet all, vnderſtande them. For you whiche are baptized and are faythfull, doeth knowe what he ſayde.
                     But thoſe amonge you, whiche are yet called Cathecumini or hearers, may be hearers, but therein vnderſtanders thynke you? Therefore our ſermon is directed vnto bothe. Nowe thoſe whyche doeth eate the fleſhe of our Lorde and drynke hys bloud, lette them take heede, what they eate, and what they drynke, leaſte (as the Apoſtle ſayeth) they eate and drinke it to theyr owne dampnation. But let them, whiche doeth not yet eate, nor yet drynke, beynge inuited, make haſte vnto ſuche dayntes. For in theſe dayes magiſtrates doeth eate. Chryſt doeth dayly feede,

That table of his. is ſet in the middes. What is the cauſe, O ye herers, that ye ſee the table, and come not to the delicates? perchaunce now, when the goſpell was redde, you ſayde in your hartes, perceiue wee what it is that he ſaith, my fleſhe is verely meate, and my blood is verily drynke? how is the fleſhe of the lorde eaten, and the blood of the lorde dronken? perceiue we what he ſaith? who hath hid it from the, that thou knoweſt it not? hid it is. But if thou wilt, it ſhall be opened. Come to the profeſſion, and thou haſt ſolued the queſtion. For thoſe that be now faithfull, knowth what our lord Ieſus ſayd. But thou art called an herer, and yet in heryng thou arte deaffe. For thou haſt the eares of the body open, becauſe thou hereſt the woordes whiche are ſpoken. But thou haſt the eares of the hart yet ſhut, becauſe thou vnderſtandeſt not that, whiche is ſaid.
                  
                  Now, meaneth Saint Auſten here nothyng els by all theſe playne words of eatyng and drynkyng of Chriſtes holy fleſhe and blood, but onely faith and beleefe? which only Frith doth call the ſpirituall eatyng and drynking thereof, ſaiyng there is none other but that? Therfore is it onely that eatyng and drinkyng, whereunto Saint Auſten doth here inuite thoſe, which he calleth Cathecumini or heres, who hath feith (as he ſayd before) and doth beleue in the name of Chriſte all ready, and beareth his croſſe in their forheades? is it alſo that eatyng and drynkyng, that is to ſay, onely faith and beleefe,
                  Wherevnto he doth here inuite them, with the name and promiſe of deinties and delicates, ſet vpon the table? the name of the table deintes or delicates, pretēdeth &amp; declareth an other maner of eatynge and drynkynge then is onely feith and beleefe, if thou loke well vpon it? moreouer, is only faith and belefe, that ſame eating and drinking, which (as he ſaith) our ſauiour Chriſte doth exhort

vs vnto, with the promiſe of euerlaſtyng lyfe? when the Cathecuminus (as he doth alſo declare (hath faith and doth beleue in the name of Chriſt, and yet cummeth not to this eating and drinking, that Saint Auſten ſpeaketh of. Is it not alſo that eating and drinking, that is to ſay, only faith and belefe, wherof he ſaith, let them whiche doth eate the fleſhe of our lord, and drinke his blood take hede what they eate &amp; what they drinke, leſt (as thapoſtle ſaith) they eate it and drinke it to their own damnacion? He ſaith not how they eate &amp; how they drinke, but what they eate &amp; what they drinke. And what meaneth he by that ſame what? very bread in a bare ſignificacion as Frith doth take it? did not thoſe Cathecumini or herers take it ſo, whom S. Auſten doth reprehēd? wherfore did he blame them? but becauſe they beleued therin to be nothing els but only that, wherin they were deceiued to?
                  How be it, after Frithes vnderſtandyng, it is all one to ſay, let them take bede what they eate, and what they drynke, and to ſay, let them take hede what they beleue and what they thynke. I will not deny, but thoſe warnings be very good, but yet to ſay they be both one (as Frith doth take them) who wold vnderſtande it ſo, but only he, and the blind weiward ſchole which thou art of?

                  Nay Saint Paule dooth not ſay, that the one is any more damnable then the other. For he ſpeaketh but of the one alone. And yet therin, his ſaiynge dooth not make it damnable nother. For it dooth but declare it ſo to bee And therefore I aſke of the, why the other ſhoulde not be ſo to? For if I be vnworthy to eate it, I am (without queſtion) vnwoorthy to looke vpon it. For beetwene the acte of eatynge, and the acte of lookynge or behouldynge, doubtleſſe there is no difference, of any woorthyneſſe or vnwoorthyneſſe, more in the one, then in the other. Wherefore, if there be none other cauſe, why it is damnable to eate it vnworthyly, but becauſe it is a fygure, token or ſigne of Chriſtes boddy and blood repreſentynge his death, then it muſt needes be as damnable to looke vpon it, or beholde it vnwoorthyly, becauſe figures, tokens, and ſygnes perteyne rather, and more commonlie to the ſence of the ſight, then to anye eatynge or drynkynge other. And therefore

vnwoorthy ſeyng or beholdyng of it, can be no leſſe faute, then is the vnwoorthy eatynge and drynkynge of it, if there be no more in it, then thou ſpeakeſt of. Wherfore, let vs go farther and conſider this, that if it be nothynge els, but a figure, token, or ſygne of Chriſtes body and blood repreſentynge his death, why is the ſentence of damnacion declared vpon the vnworthy eatyng and drynkynge of that, more then vpon the vnwoorthy lookinge and beholdyng of the Crucifix or the roode? For that is a fygure, token, or ſigne of Chriſtes boddy and blood repreſentynge his death to. whiche it doth much more aptly, muche more apparantly, much more lyuely, and therefore muche more profitablie, then the ſacramente doeth, if there bee no more in the ſacrament, then thou ſaiſt there is. For that the roode doth, it doth it moſt ſenſiblie. But that the ſacrament doth, it doth it ſcāt intelligibly. And therfore if there be no more in the ſacrament, then is in the roode then is the roode as good and better then the ſacrament is.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  No ſir not ſo. For I will not deny, but the ſacramente hath in it, that the roode hath not.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  What is that?
               
               
                  HERE.
                  The ſacrament hath in it, the ordynance of Chriſte. And the roode, but the ordinaunce of man. For Chriſte did inſtitute and ordeine the one, and man the other.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  Then thou muſte needes graunte that therein, the ordinaunce of man, is better then the ordinaunce of Chriſte. For euery figure, token, or ſigne, is alway ordeyned to ſignifie. And that ſigne muſt needes be beſt, whiche doth moſt aptly and moſte manifeſtly repreſent the thinge that it ſignifieth. But the roode doth much more manifeſtly repreſent the thing

that it ſignifieth, then the ſacrament dooth, wherefore the roode muſte needes bee a better ſigne then the ſacramente is. Therefore if the roode bee (as it ſeemeth by Frith) a better ſigne then the ſacrament is, And the better ſigne muſt nedes procede of the better ordinance, (as the better effect, of the better cauſe) it foloweth plaine, that the ordinance of man in the roode is better then the ordinance of Chriſte in the ſacrament.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Tuſhe ſir, I can not away with that reaſon.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  That is becauſe thou art not able to auoide it, as thou art not in dede, except thou graunt a better thing to be in the ſacrament, then any figure, token, or ſigne other. And a better there is none, but onely the verye thinge, that is thereby ſignified, which is the very body and blood of Chriſte. For what can be directly better then a ſigne in that kinde of thinges, but onely that, whiche it dooth ſignifie? becauſe there is no meane betweene them, wherof any compariſon is to be made, but onely of the one to the other, that is to ſaye, betweene them two. Therefore other thou muſt nedes graunt the bleſſed body and blood of Chriſte to bee verely and really in the ſacrament, (whereby the ſacrament is made more and better, then is anye other fygure, token, or ſigne) or els thou muſt needes graunt the roode to be a better figure token or ſigne then the ſacrament is. And ſo the ordinaunce of man to be better (as I ſayd) in the one, then the ordinaunce of Chriſte in the other. Wherefore by this, (whiche thou dareſt not graunt) thou maiſt, if thou haue any grace, well perceiue the very cauſe why the ſacramente dooth in the Iudgement of all trew chriſten people, ſo farre paſſe

the roode as it dooth. For although the roode be a worthy ſygne and very expedient for vs to behoulde, yet it is not ordeyned but onely to refreſhe our memorie, fayth and deuocion. Where as the vertue of the ſacrament is, to geue lyfe, helth, and ſaluacion. Wherof the glorious author him ſelfe doth ſaie,
                  
                     Iohn̄. 6.
                     Take, eate, this is my body, whiche ſhall be geuen for you. He that eateth my fleſhe and drinketh my blood hath lyfe euerlaſtynge, and I wyll reyſe him vp agayne in the latter daie, for my fleſhe is veryly meate, and my blood is verely drynke.
                  
                  And why dooth he ſay, it is verely meate and verely drynke, but becauſe we ſhoulde verely eate it, and verely drynke it? For what ſo euer is verely meate, is without doubt, to be veryly eaten accordingly. And therfore what can bee ſpoken more litterally, as touchynge the verytee of the thynge?
                  Wherefore it was a very madde and a weyward phanſie of Fryth to ſaye, or thynke, that there is none other meanynge or vnderſtandynge of thoſe plaine woordes of eatynge and drynkynge of that holye fleſhe and blood, but onely feyth and beleefe. And that (as I ſayde) in ſo many ſondrye places, and by ſuche, and ſo many notable, and moſte woorthy authors, as thát matter is ſpoker. of, ſette foorth, and by thoſe woordes expreſſed. But yet euen ſuche is the blyndneſſe of hereſie, vnto the whiche, becauſe credible ſeemeth incredible, and intelligible not intelligible, what ſkilleth it, what Fryth dooth ſaye? or what is his ſaiynge to that thou haſte herde of Saint Auſten? whom although he taketh aboue all men for his defence, yet thou maieſt now ſee, how clerely

he maketh againſt him. In ſo much, that if I ſhould recite vnto the, all ſuche other places of Saint Auſten as maketh no leſſe, but rather more againſt him lykewyſe, the whole daie were to little to ſerue the purpoſe. And therefore now content thy ſelfe with that I haue hytherto ſayde, as thou haſt herde alreadye, whiche is ſo muche, as perchaunce woulde ſeeme to ſoome, euen to be more then enough. Wherefore with this content thy ſelfe, and fare well for this tyme.

                  Ye why not? for it were but a loſt labour to beſtowe anye more tyme about that, ſith he bringeth none of them al, for any other purpoſe (as I ſayd at the firſt) but onelie to confyrme that, which he wolde make vs to beleue, he gathereth out of Saint Auſten. And that apeereth by his owne woordes, whiche I recyted vnto the before, and alſo will now agayne, to put the in better remembraunce thereof. For his woordes be theſe.
                  
                     This (ſaith he) were proofe enough, to conclude, that all the olde fathers did holde the ſame opinion. For who woulde once ſurmiſe (ſeynge we haue Saynt Auſten ſo playne for vs, whiche is the chiefeſt among them all) who wolde once ſurmiſe (I ſay) that he diſſented, in this great matter, from the other faythfull fathers, or they from him? Neuertheleſſe I dare not let him ſtande poſt alone, leaſt ye diſpyſe hym.
                     
                        And therefore I will ſhowe you the minde of certaine other alſo. And firſt of his maiſter Saint Ambroſe.

                  What neede that? For thou ſeeſt it playne, that he bryngeth not in Saint Ambroſe nor anie other beſyde for any thynge els, but onely to ſhow thagrement betwene Saint Auſten and them. And therefore looke (as I haue declared vnto the) how Saynt Auſten dooth make for his purpoſe, euen ſo dooth Saint Ambroſe, and all the reſte lykewiſe. That is to ſaie, none otherwyſe in deede, but euen dyrectlie agaynſte him.

                     Quia enim morte domini liberati ſumus, huius rei in edendo &amp; potando carnem &amp; ſanguinem quae pro nobis oblata ſunt ſignificamus,

                     Becauſe we be deliuered by the death of the lorde, in eatynge and drynkinge this thing meaning the ſacrament, we ſignifie the fleſhe and blood whiche were offerered for vs.
                     
                        Here doeth ſaynt Ambroſe ſay enough (ſayth he) yf men were not ſophiſters, but wolde be content with reaſon.
                  
                  Now by thys ye ſee, that Frithe deſireth none other, but that reaſon might rule, as it ought to do.

                  In deede this reaſon I finde in it, that thy recitall herof (as I now perceyue (chaunceth very well for thee, if thou will be ſo happy, as not to truſt falſhed wilfully. For if euer thou foundeſt a falſer harlot, then Frithe ſhalbe founde in this, truſt me no more. And that not only in his allegation of Saynt Ambroſe wordes, but alſo in his tranſlating of them into englyſhe to. And to thyntent it may the more playnlie appere vnto thee, I wyl ſo trewlie alledge the very ſame place of Saynt Ambroſe my ſelfe, as thou ſhalt not fayle to finde it, worde by worde, looke where it is, when thou wilt. For the very wordes of Saynt Ambroſe are theſe.
                  
                     Quia enim morte domini liberati ſumus, huius rei membres in edendo &amp; potando carnem et ſanguinem quae pro nobis oblata ſunt ſignificamus.
                  
                  That is to ſay.
                  
                     Becauſe we be deliuered by the death of our lord, we mind full therof do in eating and drinkinge the fleſhe and bloud whiche were offred for vs, ſignifie.
                  
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Ye what do we ſignifie?
               
               
                  CATH.
                  Softe let that alone for a whyle. And let vs fyrſt conferre Frithes allegation and mine, not only in latin but alſo in Engliſhe bothe together, that we may ſe, how well they doo agree. And therfore in his allegation of the latin, what hath he done with this worde Memores, whiche is to ſay in Engliſhe mindefull. Why dyd he leaue out that, and wolde not bringe it to light? he thought perchaunce that Saynt Ambroſe did not well to put it in. Or els he

thought to make an exchaynge with hym, and for that latyn worde, to gyue him in recompence, theſe three or foure Englyſhe woordes. That is to ſay, meaninge of the Sacramente. For what Latyn worde hathe Saynt Ambroſe here, that may be trewlie turned in to thys Engliſhe worde meaninge? Or into this worde Sacrament? If he haue here none ſuche, (as he hath not in deede) what foloweth, but that Frithe of purpoſe did put them in, to deceyue and make the ſymple Engliſhe reader beleue it to be, the minde of Saynt Ambroſe when it is but his owne falſe Hereticall practiſe, and nothinge els? As it may well appere by thys, that vnder the colour of a tranſlatour, he playeth here the falſe expoſiter. And why? but as I ſayde to ſeduce the reader. For where as Saynt Ambroſe doeth ioyne theſe wordes (huius rei) and thys worde (Memores) together, whiche are to ſay, myndefull of thys thynge, Frithe putteth away this worde, memores, and ioyneth to huius rei, theſe wordes, in edendo &amp; potando.
                  
                  Whiche beynge ſo ioyned are to ſay, in eatynge and drynkynge of thys thynge. Nowe to ſaye, myndefull of thys thinge, as Saynt Ambroſe ſayeth, and to ſaye, in eatynge and drinkinge of this thynge, as Fryth ſayth thou mayſt perceue, hath a greate difference. Whereby doeth it not euen clearely appere, how falſe a parte he playeth herein? And yet to make vs beleue, that Saynt Ambroſe dyd meane, by thys ſame, huius rei, the Sacrament, he of hys owne head addeth vnto it, for an expoſition thereof, theſe wordes, meanynge of the Sacramente. When Saynt Ambroſe meaneth by it not ſo, nor anie thynge els, but (as

it is playne) the very ſame, that he maketh mention of before, whiche is the death of Chriſte, whereby we are delyuered, ſayinge.
                  We myndefull of this thinge, in eating and drinking the fleſhe and bloud, which were offered for vs, do ſignifie.

                  Yet ſyr ye make thereof no parfyt ſenſe. For as I aſked of you before, what doo we ſygnifie? we can not ſygnifie except we ſygnifie ſomewhat. And as ye doo handle it, there is nothing expreſſed. Wherefore there muſt, other be ſomewhat vnderſtande, or els thys worde ſignifie maketh no ſenſe at all.

                     We myndefull of this thinge do ſignifie it, in eatinge and drynkinge the fleſhe and bloud whyche were offered for vs?

                  Here is a maruaylous thinge to ſee, how Frithes Englyſhinge of thys matter and yours doeth dyffer. For where ye ſay, the meanynge of it is thys, that we ſygnifie the death of chriſte, Frythe doeth ſay, we ſygnifie the fleſhe and bloud, whiche were offred for vs.

For he ſayth, of the fleſhe and bloud whyche were offred for vs.
                  In eatinge and drinkinge of them (ſayeth he) we ſignifie the deathe of Chriſt. For he hath not here any ſuch worde as the Sacrament is, nor any ſuche meaninge as Frithe doeth ſay he meaneth nother. Wherfore by thys it may once agayne, euen playnly appere that Frythe doeth here falſelie belie Saynt Ambroſe, as he doeth Saynt Auſten, and all the other holy fathers beſyde.

                  Panis iſte panis eſt ante verba ſacramentorum. Vbi acceſſerit conſecratio, de pane fit Caro Chriſti.
                  That is to ſay.
                  
                     This bread is breade, before the woordes of the Sacramentes. But when the conſecration is cum to it, there is made of the breade, the fleſhe of Chriſte.
                  
                  And in the next chapiter of the ſame booke, his wordes be alſo theſe.

And for proufe therof, herken to him that ſayth Take and eate of it all you. This is my body. And before the wordes of Chriſt, the Chalice is full of wyne and water. But when the wordes of Chriſte hath wrought, there is made the bloud, whyche redemed the people.

                     That is to ſay.
                  
                  
                     As our Lorde Ieſus chryſte is the verye ſonne of God, not as men are by grace, but as the Sonne of the ſubſtance of the father. So is it very fleſhe, as he ſayth him ſelfe, whiche we receyue.
                  
                  Now therefore tell me why, that Frithe doeth not alledge theſe places of Saynt Ambroſe (amonge many other lyke in hys wordes beſydes) as well as that other place, whiche he doeth alledge, and ſo falſely handle as I haue declared vnto thee? Is there any other why, but only becauſe he was not able to deface the manifeſt trewth of theſe places, as he did (ſo farre as in hym lay) the trewth of the other? Beſyde thys, he doeth in the .39. leafe of his booke alledge alſo the bleſſed martyr Saynt Cyprian in theſe wordes.
                  Cyprian ſayeth (ſayeth he) that the people is annexed in the ſacrament, thorow the myxture of water.
                  
                  
                     Why therfore doeth he not as well alledge hym in that place, where he hath theſe wordes.
                  
                     Cipri. Serm. de caena domini
                     
                        Panis iſte quem dominus diſcipulis porrigebat, non effigie, ſed natura mutatus, omnipotentia verbi, factus eſt caro.
                     
                  
                  That is to ſay.
                  
                     This breade, whiche our lorde gaue hys diſciples, beynge chaynged, not in outward forme, but in nature, by the almighty power of the worde, is made fleſhe.
                  
                  This place made not for Frithes purpoſe. And in deede no more did the other nother, as it may well appere by this, that he nother doth, nor yet can frame any maner of proufe of hys purpoſe by it. For he doeth no more but without cauſe therof, fayne hym ſelfe to maruell, that men will not vnderſtande and take it, as he doeth.
                  For therevpon, his wordes be theſe.
                  
                     I maruell me muche (ſayeth he) that they are ſo contentions and wyll not ſee, that as the water is the people, ſo the wyne is chriſtes bloud, that is to ſay, in a miſtery, becauſe it repreſenteth Chriſtes bloud, as the water doeth the people.
                  
                  Here thou ſeeſt, he gathereth of this place, whiche he doeth alledge of Saynt Cyprian, nothing els, but only a maruell, that we take it not as he wolde haue vs.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Yet ſyr he doeth ſaye, that as the water is the people, ſo the wyne is Chriſtes bloud, that is to ſay, in a miſtery, becauſe it repreſenteth Chriſtes bloud as the water doeth the people.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  Trew it is, that ſo he ſayeth, but ſo he doeth not proue it for all that. And therefore as he doeth but only ſay it of Chriſtes bloud, euen ſo he doeth but only meane the lyke of Chryſtes fleſhe. Wherof Saynt Cyprian doeth not ſay, this bread is made in a miſtery, ſygne, or ſignification of fleſhe, but

he ſayeth it is made fleſhe, That is to ſay, fleſhe indeede for if he had not verelie-beleued, the nature of the bread (whiche he taketh for the ſubſtance thereof) to be as he ſayth, by the almighty power of the word, conuerted and chaynged into the very fleſhe of Chriſte in deede, he wolde neuer haue ſo ſayde of it, as here thou haſte hearde he doeth. Wherfore now thou ſeeſt how well S. Ambroſe and Saynt Cyprian bothe, ſerueth hys purpoſe in Saynt Auſten. And euen ſo wythout queſtion, doeth all the reſt of the olde holy Fathers which he doeth alledge beſyde. For doubtleſſe of them all, he doth nothynge els, but onelie pyke out ſuche places, as he knew well, the vnlearned reader ſhould not be able to vnderſtande. Speciallie when he, for hys owne parte doeth ſet them ſo craftelie foorthe vnto hym, and handle them ſo vngraciouſly as he doeth. Whereof a parte, I haue here nowe declared vnto thee by manyfeſt example of hys wycked and falſe handelynge, not onely of Saynt Ambroſe, but alſo of Saynt Cipryan to. But as for anye ſuche other places, whiche Saynt Ambroſe, and the other holy Fathers haue ſo playne, as may eaſely put the ſymple reader in ſuertie of the trewth, and cleane out of doubt, he wolde in no wyſe touche, nor brynge foorthe anie one of them, but ſo wynke at the matter, as thoughe there were no ſuche in deede. And therefore to knowe what he was, and what hys doynges are, what is there els, that thou woldeſt haue more, then I haue tolde thee? If thys to thee bee not enoughe, in very deede there is nothyng will ſerue.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Yes ſyr ſomethynge wyll ſerue,

but yet not all this, I may ſay to you?
               
               
                  CATHOLI.
                  Why ſo?
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Becauſe I doo knowe, why ye wolde ſo fayne haue done, &amp; make ſuch haſt to be gone.
               
               
                  CATHOLICVS.
                  Why?
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Becauſe Frithe hath one ſayinge of a certayne Doctour to be anſwered vnto, whiche I perceyue ye be not willinge to meddell with all.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  What Doctour is that?
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Frithe ſhall tell you that, him ſelfe. For in the .76. leafe of hys booke, his wordes be theſe.
                  
                     That there remayneth breade (ſayeth he) myght be proued by the authorite of many doctours, whyche call it breade and wyne, euen as Chryſte and hys Apoſtles did. And thoughe ſome Sophiſters wolde wreſt theyr ſayinges and expounde them after their owne phantaſye, yet ſhall I alledge them one doctour whiche was pope, that maketh ſo playne with vs, that they ſhall neuer be able to avoyde hym. For Pope Belaſius writeth on thys manner.
                  
                  
                     Certe Sacramenta quae ſumimus corporis &amp; ſanguinis Chriſti, diuinae res ſunt. Propter quod &amp; per eadem diuinae efficimur conſortes uaturae. Et tamen non diſinit eſſe ſubſtantia vel natura panis &amp; vini. Sed permanet in ſuae proprietate naturae. Et certe Imago &amp; ſimilitudo corporis &amp; ſanguinis Chriſti in actione Miſteriorum celebrantur.
                  
                  That is to ſay.
                  
                     Suerly the ſacramentes of the body and bloud of Chryſte whyche we receyue, are godlye thynges. Therefore thorow them are we made partakers of the godly nature.
                     And yet doeth it not ceaſe to be the ſubſtance or nature of breade and wine, but they contynew in the properte of theyr owne nature. And ſuerly the Image and ſimilitude of the body and bloud of chryſte are celebrated in the arte of the myſteries.
                     
                        This am I ſure (ſaith he) that no man can auoyde it, nor ſo wreſt it, but that all men ſhall ſoone eſpy his folly. And therfore I may conclude, that there remaineth the ſubſtaunce and nature of bread and wyne.
                  
                  Here ye maie now ſee, how ſure of his purpoſe Fryth maketh him ſelfe, by the playne teſtimonie of this doctour.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  Ye but yet I perceiue, thou ſeeſt not, how ſure I make my ſelfe, that he for all this, is neuertheleſſe deceiued.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  That were to ſtraynge. For there can be no plainer wordes for his purpoſe, then he doth here alledge of this doctour.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  Thou ſaieſt wel, and therefore let vs returne to Saint Ambroſe againe. And that not onely with good remembraunce of what ſo euer I haue alledged of him vnto the already, but alſo with dew conſideracion of this, that I ſhall alledge of him more vnto the now. For in the ninth chapiter of his worke intituled De his qui miſterijs initiantur, where he maketh a compariſon beetwene the bleſſed body of Chriſte in the ſacramente, and the ſhadowes and figures therof in the ould law, he hath euen theſe woordes.
                  
                     Potior etenim lux quā vmbra, veritas 
                           
                              
                           
                           quam
                         figura, corpus authoris quam Manna de coelo. Forte dicas. Aliud video. Quomodo tu mihi aſſeris quod Chriſti corpus accipiam? Et hoc nobis adhuc ſupereſt, vt probemus.
                  
                  
                     That is to ſay.
                  
                  
                     Better is the light then the ſhadow, better is the trewth then the fygure, better is the body of the maker, then the Manna from heauen. Peraduenture thou woldeſt ſay, I ſee an other thynge. How affirmeſt thou to me, that I receiue the body of Chriſte? That doth yet remaine for vs to proue.
                  
                  And now therfore take thou good heede, becauſe for

his profe therof, theſe be part of his woordes.
                  
                     Probemus hoc non eſſe quod natura formauit, ſed quod Benedictio conſecrauit. Maiorem
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         vim eſſe Benedictionis, quam naturae. Quia Benedictione etiam natura ipſa mutatur.
                  
                  That is to ſaie.
                  
                     Let vs proue this not to be that, whiche nature hath formed, but that, whiche benediction hath conſecrated. And that the power of benediction, is more then the power of nature. For thorow benediction alſo nature it ſelfe is chaynged.
                  
                  Whiche thinges he proueth by no leſſe then manifeſt example of holy ſcripture, ſaiyng.
                  
                     
                        Virgam tenebat Moyſes, proiecit eam &amp; facta eſt ſerpens. Rurſus apprehendit caudam Serpentis &amp; in virgae naturam reuertitur. Vides igitur prophetica gratia, bis mutatam eſſe naturam &amp; ſerpentis &amp; virgae.
                     
                  
                  That is to ſay.
                  
                     Moyſes had a rodde. He dyd caſt it foorth, and it was made a ſerpente. He tooke the ſerpente by the tayle, and it was turned into the nature of the rodde agayne. Therefore thou ſeeſt the nature, both of the Serpent, and alſo of the rodde, by the prophetical grace, to be twiſe chaynged.
                  
                  Now after this example of the ſcripture and diuers other mo, he hath alſo theſe woordes.
                  
                     Aduertimus igitur maioris eſſe virtutis gratiam, quam naturam. Et adhuc tamen propheticae Benedictionis numeramus gratiam, Quod ſi tantum valuit humana Benedictio vt naturam conuerteret, Quid dicimus de ipſa conſecratione diuina, vbi verba ipſa domini Saluatoris operantur? Nam ſacramentum iſtud quod accipis, Chriſti ſermone conficitur.
                     Quod ſi tantum valuit Sermo Heliae, vt ignem de

coelo deponeret, Non valebit Chriſti ſermo vt ſpecies mutet elementorum? De totius Mundi operibus legiſti. quia ipſe dixit &amp; facta ſunt, Ipſe mandauit &amp; creataſunt. Sermo ergo Chriſti qui potuit ex nihilo facere quod non erat, Non poteſt ea quae ſunt, in id mutare quod non erant? Non enim minus eſt, nouas, rebus dare, quam mutare naturas.
                  
                  That is to ſaie.
                  
                     Therefore we perceiue grace to be of more power then nature. And yet hytherto we recken the grace of the propheticall benediction. wherin, if mannes benediction was ſo ſtronge, that it did chainge nature, what ſay we of the diuine conſecracion it ſelfe, where the ſelfe ſame woordes of our Lorde and Sauiour doth worke? For this ſacrament whiche thou doeſt receiue, is made by the worde of Chriſt. For if the woorde of Helias was ſo ſtronge, that it brought doune fyre from heauen, ſhall not the woorde of Chriſte be ſo ſtronge, that it maie chaynge kyndes of elementes? Thou haſte redde of the woorkes of the whole worlde, that he ſpake the woord, and they were made, he commaunded, and they were create.
                     Therefore can not the woord of Chriſte, which was able to make that of nothinge, which was not, chainge thoſe thinges that are, into that which they were not? For it is not leſſe, to geue new natures to thinges, then it is to chaynge them.
                  
                  Here thow haſt now herde, what Saint Ambroſe ſaith. And therfore I wolde fayne know of Frith, how he wold ioyne that ſaiynge of Gelaſius, and theſe of Saint Ambroſe together?
               
               
                  HER.
                  How can they be ioyned together, when they be cleane contrary? for gelaſiꝰ both ſay.
                  
                     That it ſeaſeth not to be the ſubſtaunce or nature of bread and wyne, but they continew in the propertee of their owne nature.
                  
                  And Saint ambroſe doth ſay.
                  
                     
                     That thorow benediction the nature is chaunged. And thorow canſecracion, there is made of the breade, the fleſhe of Chriſte. And thorow the operacion of Chriſtes woordes, there is made of the wine and water, the blood which redemed the people.
                  
                  And ſo after him, there remaineth no ſubſtannce nor nature of bread and wyne at all. But after Gelaſius there remaineth both. Wherfore theſe two doctours be directly one againſt another.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  And doeſt thou beleue, that they be ſo in dede?
               
               
                  HERE.
                  It is ſo plain, I can not chooſe.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  Then is Frith not onely therein againſt the, but alſo againſt him ſelfe to. For thou knoweſt (as I tolde the before) that he doth in theſe woordes aſke this queſtion.
                  
                     Who wolde once ſurmiſe that Saint Auſten diſſented in this great matter from the other faithfull fathers, or they from him?
                  
                  As who ſay no man wolde ſo ſurmiſe. And therefore if none of them, in this great matter, diſſented from S. Auſten, nor he from them, It foloweth thereof, that none of them, diſſented from other. If none of them diſſented from other, and Gelaſius one of them in deede, as Frith him ſelfe doth take him to be, then doth Saint Ambroſe and Gelaſius by Frithes owne ſaiynge agree together well enough. Therefore if Saint Ambroſe and Gelaſius do agree together well enough, why doth not Frith in this great matter, beleue them both, that is to ſay as wel ſaint ambroſe in theſe places which I haue recited, as he doth gelaſius in that place, which he doth recite?
               
               
                  HERE.
                  It were but reaſon, if they did agree together in deede, but plaine it is they do not ſo.
               
               
                  CAT.
                  Then Frith doth lie. For by his owne ſaiyng they do

agree for all that.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  If they do not, how come this to paſſe, that none of them bothe, in all this longe tyme, from their daies hytherto, hath bene touched with any ſclaunder or note of hereſy? Frith ſcaped not ſo, but was quickly taken for an heretyke, as he was moſte woorthy. Therefore if they had diſſented in this great matter one from an other (as Frith doth ſay, they did not) there is no doubt, but one of them both, had bene an heretyke in dede, and coulde not haue ſcaped away withall, thus longe in the Churche of Chriſte, without the worthy infamie and note therof.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Yes ſir well enoughe. For in this caſe, there is no matter of hereſie at all. For Frith ſaith, there is no man bounde to beleue it vnder peyne of damnacion.

                  Although I toulde the enough of that ſaiynge of his, euen yeſter day, yet now therin, marke his lacke, of witte, learnyng, or grace, or els rather of al thre. For here thou haſt herd, how he calleth it, and cōfeſſeth it to be a great matter.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  That is trew.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  And I tould the yeſter day, how and where, he calleth it an article of our faith.

                  Ye but none of our crede, he ſaith.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  Yet an article of our faith he confeſſeth it to be for all that. And therfore when he dooth confeſſe it to be, not onelie an article, but alſo a great matter, what other thinge therin dooth he, but (althoughe vnwares to hym ſelfe) confeſſe it to be a great article of our fayth. For the article can not be ſmall, and the matter thereof great. And therefore if it be a great article of our fayth (as it is in deede) wherein dooth hereſy conſiſt, if it be not, in the not beleuynge thereof? And who denieth it to be a damnable faut, not to beleue

a great article of our fayth, but ſuch a great heretike, or the very ſame that Frith was in deede? when the not beleuynge, of the leaſt article therof, is enough to make an heretike with all. Wherfore this maiſt thou ſee what wit, learnynge, or grace was in Frythes head, that wolde ſay they dooe agree, and diſſent not one from an other (as they do not in deede) and yet houlde not ſo muche with the one, as he doth directly agaynſte the other, that is to ſay, not ſo muche with Gelaſius, as againſt holy Saint Ambroſe.
               
            
            
               Cap. 45.
               
                  HERE.
                  Syr I pray you let that paſſe. And to this, that (as I perceiue) you do take theſe two doctours, S. Ambroſe and Gelaſius, not to diſſent one from an other, but very well to agree together, wherat I meruayle, their wordes being ſo contrary as they are.
               
               
                  CAT.
                  Of their agrement I haue no doubt. But whether they be the very words of Gelaſius which Frith doth here alledge of him or no, I haue ſome doubt of that, becauſe he doth not ſhow, nor note in what place of Gelaſius woorkes, we maie fynde them. But let vs graunt him the moſt he can aſke, that they be the verye wordes of Gelaſius in deede. And therefore let me ſee what he can gette by that?
               
               
                  HER.
                  No more but euen as the very woordes of Gelaſius doth declare, whiche are playne, that
                  
                     It dooth not ceaſe to be the ſubſtance or nature of bread and wyne, but they continew in the propertee of their owne nature.
                  
                  Therefore what doubt can there be, in the meaninge of

theſe ſo plaine wordes?
               
               
                  CATH.
                  Some perchaunce in this, that he ſaith, it ceaſeth not to be the ſubſtance or nature of bread and wyne. He ſaith not the ſubſtance and nature, but the ſubſtaunce or nature, As doubtynge whiche of them both he myght beſt ſay. And therfore it is incertaine to Frith, whiche of them both he ment.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  That is not ſo. For there is no doubt, but Gelaſius ment as well the one as the other, and referreth to vs, the libertee of vnderſtanding or taking of whiche we lyſt, becauſe although they be two wordes, yet they are both of one ſignification.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  They are ſome tyme confounded (thou maiſt ſay) and taken one for an other, But yet not bothe of one proper ſignifycacyen for all that. For ſubſtaunce perteyneth properly to the pryncipall beynge of a body, makyng it to be the ſame that it is. And nature, althoughe it bee ſome tyme taken more generally or largely for the whole thinge, yet commonly it perteyneth but to the accidentall qualitees, and propertees thereof, declarynge it to bee rather ſuche as it is, then what it is. Therefore if Fryth ſaye, that Gelaſius ment both ſubſtance and nature, that I maie well denie, becauſe his woordes be diſiunctiuelie ſpoken, of the one, or the other.
               
               
                  HER.
                  Yet maie we then chooſe, and take which of them we will.
               
               
                  CAT.
                  Which ſhall that be?
               
               
                  HER.
                  Subſtaunce.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  Nay not ſo. For thereof Gelaſius maketh a reſtraynt him ſelfe, if thou marke it well. For when he dooth ſay, They continew in the propertee of their nature, he ſayth not, in the propertee of their ſubſtaunce. Whiche had bene as much to ſaye, as in the propertee of their chiefe and principall beynge,

For of the ſubſtaunce euery thynge that is a body, (as breadde and alſo wyne is) hath his nominacion. Therfore he ſaith not in the propertee of their ſubſtaunce.
                  But in the propertee of their nature, as of a leſſe beynge then of ſubſtaunce. And yet euen therein, this is alſo to be noted to, that he ſayth not in their nature, but in the propertee of their nature. For nature and the propertee of nature, is not without a difference, as it is well proued by this, that the one procedeth and is ſayde of the other. For the propertee of nature, is but the operacion of it accordynge to the ſame.
                  Whereof nature is ſome tyme letted by one occaſion or other. And yet then, althoughe it be ſo put or let from the proper operacion thereof, it is neuertheleſſe nature ſtyll for all that. And therefore Gelaſius, to amende or qualyfye, his woordes of ſubſtaunce or nature, and to auoyde all ſynyſter vnderſtandynge therof, doth adde vnto them and ſaye, They continew in the propertee of their nature. As he mighte ſaie, I do not meane the verye ſubſtaunce or nature it ſelfe, but the naturall quantitees, qualitees, and propertees thereof. Wherefore, if he had ment (as Frith dooth take him to meane) the very ſubſtaunce or nature it ſelfe of breadde and wyne ſtyll to remayne in deede, it had beene ſuperfluous and to no purpoſe, but rather a very folly to tell vs, (as he dooth) that they continew in the propertee of their nature.
                  For who doeth not know, that all ſubſtanciall and naturall thinges, for the tyme of their beyng, do contynew in the propertee of theyr nature? Therefore, Gelaſius was to wyſe, and to well learned, to

teache vs that, for a ſpeciall or a neceſſary leſſon, whych euery man knoweth alredy.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Why euery man doeth know, that they contynew in the properte of theyr nature.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  Ye but euery man doeth not knowe that they ſo do, wythout their owne proper ſubſtance.
                  And that is the cauſe, why Gelaſius doeth ſo ſay therof as he doeth. For els he ſhould ſpeake it wythout cauſe or any neede at all. And that he wolde not do. For yf he had thought or ment, that the very ſubſtance or nature it ſelfe, of breade and wyne, had therin contynued ſtyll, he wolde not haue ſayde they contynew in the propertee of theyr nature, whiche euery man knoweth, but he wolde haue ſayde they contynew in the verytee of theyr ſubſtance, becauſe the contrary therof, is wel and trewly beleued. For therin lyeth all the doubt or queſtion if anie be. In ſo muche, that when it is hearde, that the ſubſtance or nature of a thynge doeth ceaſe to be, it is thought, by and by, that the propertee thereof doeth ceaſe wythall, becauſe in the common courſe of thinges, it doeth ſo in deed. This ſame thought therfore, did Gelaſius intende to helpe, when he ſayth, they contynew in the propertie of their nature. As who ſaye, althoughe theyr proper ſubſtance and nature be chaynged yet they continew in the propertee of theyr nature for al that, and in nothing els, as the trewth is, they do not in deede. Agayne of the other ſyde, when it is hearde, that the propertee of nature in any thynge, doeth holde and contynew, it is thought ſtreyght way, that the ſubſtaunce and nature of the thynge, doeth alſo contynew likewiſe. Wherefore that ſame thought, dyd Saynt Ambroſe purpoſe to helpe, when and where he doeth

ſay, that.
                  
                     Thorow benediction the nature is chaynged. And thorow the conſecration, ther 
                           〈◊〉
                         made of the breade, the fleſhe of Chriſte. And thorow the operation of Chriſtes wordes, there is made of the wyne and water, the bloud whyche redemed the people. And as our Lorde Ieſus Chryſte is the very ſonne of God, ſo it is very fleſhe (as he ſayth him ſelfe) whiche we receaue.
                  
                  Here thou mayſt playnlie perceyue, according to the agrement of theſe two doctours, how the one defendeth the other. For who ſo euer wolde take and gather of S. Ambroſe, that there doeth not remayne the naturall propertee of breade and wyne, becauſe he ſpeaketh ſo playne of the alteration and chaynge of the ſubſtance or nature therof, Gelaſius doeth directly for hym anſwer and ſay, they contynew in the popertee of theyr nature. That is to ſay, the propertee of theyr nature doeth contynew ſtyll, althoughe the ſubſtance or nature it ſelfe be chaynged. And who ſo euer wolde, for this ſayinge, take and gather of Gelaſius (as Fryth doth) that there remayneth the very ſubſtance or nature of breade and wyne ſtyll, becauſe he ſpeaketh ſo playne, of the continewance of the naturall propertee thereof, Saynt Ambroſe doeth in that behalfe, directlie anſwer and ſay, that.
                  
                     Thorow benediction the nature is chaynged. And by conſecration there is made of the breade, the fleſhe of Chriſt, and ſo foorth.
                  
                  Wherfore, by thys it doeth moſte clerely appere, that Frithe was not deceaued in that he ſayeth, theſe faythfull fathers dyſſented not one from an other, but well and trewlie agreed together. But how therefore,

doeth he agree with him ſelfe, in this that he ſo ſayeth, and yet aloweth not ſo muche the ſayinge of the one, as he dooeth vtterlye deny the ſayinge of the other? when dyrectelie agaynſt Saynt Ambroſe he doeth ſay, there remayneth the ſubſtaunce and nature of bread and wyne. Who can be more agaynſt hym, then he is herein agaynſt hym ſelfe? He holdeth wyth the ſaying of Gelaſius, but not with the ſaying of Saynt Ambroſe. And yet doeth holde, that they diſſent not one from an other. Haſte thou hearde of any man, that euer framed hys thynges together after this ſorte?
               
               
                  HER.
                  Why ſay you that he holdeth not with Saynt ambroſe? If he helde not with hym, he wolde not alledge him ſo often as he doeth.
               
               
                  CATHOLI.
                  Thou ſayeſt well. For euen ſo he holdeth wyth Saynt Ambroſe, as he doeth (for all hys ſayinge) wyth Gelaſius.
                  That is to ſay, wyth none of them boeth. For it is two thinges for hym, to holde with them, and to holde wyth his owne falſe vnderſtandinge of them, as he, thou, and manie other doeth. For yf he ſought in them anie thinge els but that, he wolde not (as he did) pyke out onlie ſuche places, as be to the ſimple reader darke and obſcure, but wolde haue ſet foorthe as well ſuche other places, as are cleare and out of all queſtion, and not omitte or rather hyed them (as I tolde thee before) euen purpoſly to deceue.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  How ſhould he ſet foorthe ſuch playne places of them, as ye ſpeake of, when parchaunce he neuer ſaw them?
               
               
                  CATH.
                  Nay thou ſhalt not excuſe hym ſo. For in the .81. leafe of hys booke, his wordes are theſe.
                  
                     Of this (ſayeth he) ſpringeth the maner of ſpeakynges,

that the olde fathers do ſometime vſe. whiche at the fyrſt ſyght, myght ſeme contrary to our ſentence. But yf they be well pondered, it may ſoone be ſeen, how they ſhould be taken.
                  
                  Now tell me, how coulde he (as here he doeth) make mention of that maner of their ſpeakynges, whyche (as he confeſſeth) mought ſeme contrary to hys ſentence, if he had not ſeen them? And hauinge ſeen them, what is the cauſe, that he bringeth foorthe none of them, to let vs ſee, how they do but ſeeme contrary to hys ſentence, and may be otherwyſe taken? Is there any cauſe why, but that he knew, they wolde make cleane agaynſt him, ſythe hys owne wordes declare no leſſe, but at the leaſt, they ſeme ſo to do? Therefore in auoydinge of all doubt, why doeth he not bringe foorthe ſome of them, that we might ſee, how they ſeeme, and how he wolde proue that they do no more but ſo?
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Marry ſyr he doeth euen immediatly folowinge ſhow ye how, and that in theſe wordes.
                  
                     Many tymes (ſayeth he) when they ſpeake of the Sacrament and outwarde eatinge, they applie vnto the Sacrament and outwarde eatinge, the fruite and conditions of the inwarde eatinge and thynge it ſelfe. Becauſe, that in a faythfull man, they are ſo ioyntly ioyned, that the one is neuer without the other.
                  
                  Lo here he doeth tel, how that maner of ſpeakinges and ſayinges of the olde fathers, are in thoſe places, to be taken and vnderſtande.

                  In thoſe, where their ſayinges might ſeme (as he ſayeth) to be contrary to hys ſentence.
               
               
                  CATH.

                  That ſhall not ſkyl, for here he hath ſhowed you how they ſhould be taken.

                  Haſt thou heard of any man ſo mad, ſo fooliſhe,

or rather ſo falſe, that wolde make an expoſition, vpon no ſpecial recitall of any ſayinge? where are the wordes of thoſe olde fathers? where ſhall we finde that maner of theyr ſpeakynges? where or whiche are the places wherin they make this application that he ſpeaketh of? He telleth vs not that. But maketh vs an expoſition, we ſee not whereof. He ſendeth vs foorthe, and will not tell vs wether. How ſhall we trie his ſayinge, or herein make him anſwer?

                  Thou ſayeſt euen trew. For ſo that his ſayinge might be allowed, he wolde aſke no more. But full well did he know, that if he had alledged thoſe playne places or anie of them, thys falſe gloſe of his, coulde haue done him no ſeruiſe. And therefore he thought it better for hys purpoſe, to reporte them as he liſte, then with any iuſte recitall of theyr owne wordes, to let them reporte them ſelues. Wherfore yf thou wilt thy ſelfe, thou mayeſt now, eaſely perceyue, the cauſe why he bringeth not foorth, thoſe manifeſt and playne places of the olde Fathers, as he doeth the other obſcure, whiche he doeth ſo falſly handel, as I haue declared vnto thee.
               
            
            
               Cap. 46.
               
                  HERE.
                  Syr ye can lay no ſuche handlinge of Gelaſius wordes vnto his charge. For he maketh no maner of expoſition of them, but doeth take thē euen as he fyndeth them.
               
               
                  CATH.
                  Euen as he findeth them? What is that to the purpoſe? for if thou go to fyndinge, why did he not take the Catholike faythe, euen as

he founde it? For once he founde that well enoughe, if he wolde haue kept it. And becauſe he wolde not kepe it, therfore he loſte it. And not onely that, but alſo the trew vnderſtanding of them, whiche dyd moſt parfitlie teache it. For how myght he vnderſtande the very teathers of trewth, when he hym ſelfe, was ſo erneſtlye bent as he was, agaynſt the trewthe? And for a more clere knowledge therof, thou muſt conſider, that trewth is denied two maner of wayes. One, in the bare worde it ſelfe, an other, in the meanynge therof. And therfore whether the trewth of the worde and the trewth of the meaning go bothe together, or els a ſonder, (as ſome tyme they do, and ſome tyme not) yet Frithe thou ſhalt finde vnable to be defended in any of them bothe. As when Saynt Ambroſe doeth ſay.
                  Thorow benediction the nature is chaynged.
                  Trewth is there, bothe in the worde, and alſo in the meaninge. Whyche Frithe (as well in the one as in the other) doeth vtterly denie. Where he ſayeth.
                  There remayneth the ſubſtance &amp; nature of bread &amp; wyne.
                  And agayne when Gelaſius doeth ſay.
                  It ceaſeth not to be the ſubſtance or nature of breade and wyne.
                  Trewth is there alſo, in the meaninge, but not in the worde, as Frithe doeth take it. For he taketh ſubſtaunce there, as the logition doeth take it. And as it is one of the ten predicamentes, where it is alway taken in corporall thinges, to ſignifie that, whyche ſuſteyneth, and is as a receptacle of naturall quantite, &amp; qualites, as heate, tolde, colour, ordor, forme, figure, or ſuch other. For that, wherin thoſe accidētal quātites and qualites are conteyned, is (as it ought to be) after the logition,

called the ſubſtance of the thyng. And in that ſenſe, doeth Frithe take it, wherin he was vtterlie deceaued, or willinge to deceaue. For here, it ought not ſo to be taken. And therfore after that ſenſe, trewth is not here in the worde, but yet in the meanynge for all that.
                  For yf the worde had here bene put in that ſenſe, there had bene no trewth in anye of them bothe. That is to ſay, nother in the worde, nor yet in the meanyng nother.
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Why ſyr, dyd Frithe amiſſe to take the meaninge of Gelaſius, accordinge to the worde?
               
               
                  CATH.
                  Why doeſt thou aſke of me that queſtion, ſithe indede, he tooke it not ſo? for when the worde hath dyuerſe and manie meaninges, how coulde Frith be ſure to take the meaning according to the worde, before he had made it certayne, in whyche of thoſe meanynges the worde is put? For ſubſtance, is a worde of ſuche a ſorte, as by that, is mente ſome tyme one thynge and ſome tyme an other. In ſo muche, that ſome tyme it is taken for wordlie goodes, by reaſon whereof, we ſay of a ryche man, that he is a man of greate ſubſtance. Some tyme, when we beholde a goodly new buyldinge, we ſay that it is ſubſtancially done. There, ſubſtaunce is applied partlie to the ſtrengthe of the thynge to contynew, and partely to the connynge of the artificer.
                  Alſo it is ſome tyme taken for a certayne quantytee of ſtuffe, and ſome qualytee of workemanſhyp.
                  As when a man commeth to a Drapers ſhoppe, to hye hym a Cloke or a gowne clothe, and hathe an endee of the peace turned oute vnto hym to looke vpon, he deſyreth at lengthe to ſee the other ende of it, and when he hathe felte that in hys hande,

ye marry ſayeth he, here is an other maner of ſubſtance in thys ende, then is in the other, cut me therefore that I ſhall haue, oute of this ende. Therefore what meaneth he, by that other maner of ſubſtance, but a more quantitee of ſtuffe, and ſome qualite of better makynge in that ende, then in the other. For the verie ſubſtance of bothe the endes, and alſo of the whole clothe, after the Logition, is all one. But not ſo after the common vſe of ſpeakynge. Agayne it is alſo taken ſometyme, for the pythe or pryncipall parte of a tale. As when we heare a man longe aboute the vtteringe thereof, we byd hym go quicklie to the ſubſtance of the matter. Subſtance is not there, taken after the logition nother, but after the common ſpeache. Beſyde thys, it is ſome tyme taken for nature it ſelfe, as nature is alſo taken for it, and that as though there were no difference betwene them. And ſo doeth Gelaſius put it here, when he ſayeth.
                  It ceaſeth not to be the ſubſtance or nature of breade and wyne.
                  Meaninge indeede none of them bothe after the logition. But yet in that he doeth ſay, ſubſtance or nature, he putteth no difference betwene them, but (as thou ſaydeſt before) take whiche we liſt, it is all one to hym.
For yf they had not beene to hym as bothe one in thys caſe, he wolde not haue put as he did, the one or the other. As who ſaye I care not whiche ye take, but he wolde haue put the one and the other, (as two diſtincte) or the one and not the other, (wherin had beene no queſtion) or els nether of them bothe. Therefore ſythe it was all one to hym, to take of them,

whiche we liſte, it foloweth well, that he did not put the one, but for the other. And whiche for other, that was, his owne order of woordes doth well declare. Which is not, nature or ſubſtaunce, but ſubſtaunce or nature. He putteth ſubſtaunce before, for that which he putteth after, as an expoſicion thereof. That is to ſay, nature. Therfore he ſaith ſubſtaunce or nature, as who ſay by ſubſtaunce I meane nothynge els but nature. For if he had put nature for ſubſtaunce, as he doth ſubſtaunce for nature, he wolde not haue ioyned vnto them theſe woordes, ſaiyng, they continew in the propertee of their nature, but he wold haue ſaid, they cōtinew in the properte of ther ſubſtāce. How be it, he wold not ſay ſo, becauſe it had bene directly agaynſt his purpoſe. Wherfore euen as he dooth put ſubſtaunce for nature, ſo in very deede, he doth put nature for the propertee of nature. And therfore as a playne expoſicion of his mynde therein he doth ſay, they continew in the propertee of their nature. As who ſay therein is all the beynge they haue. For if he had thought them to haue any other, or more beynge then that, it had bene but a vayne ſaiynge of him, to ſay that they continew in the propertie of their nature, when it had bene farre better, more certaine, and playner, to ſay they continue in their very ſubſtaunce, or very nature it ſelfe, which towcheth ther whole beynge, where as the propertee of their nature, toucheth but a parte of it. For the proper nature of bread and wyne it ſelfe, and the propertee of their nature, is two thinges. And therfore Gelaſius ſaith not, that they continew in their proper nature, but in the propertee of their nature, which is leſſe. And ſo muche of bread and wyne, we graunte

to remaine in the holy ſacrament, as well after the conſecracion as before. And yet not afterwarde, and ſubſtance or nature of bread and wyne for all that, excepte thou take nature, for the onely accidentall quantitees, qualitees, and propertees therof, as it is oft tymes vſed to be taken. Ye and ſomtime for the condicions and behauiour of men, both good and badde. As when we ſee a man of a cuſtomable gentle behauiour, we ſay, he is a man of a gentle nature. Againe when we ſee a man of the contrary ſorte, and alway intractable, we ſay he is a a man of a ſtraynge nature, or a man of an euill nature. And as ſome will ſay, I neuer ſaw man of that nature. And yet all men are but of one nature, as nature is ſome way taken. Therfore when ſubſtaunce and nature both, may and daily are, ſo diuerſly vſed and taken, as they are in dede, what can Frith (for all his craakes) get of gelaſius, by thoſe words? he ſhould firſt haue tried and made it certaine, how or in what ſence gelaſius dyd put them and what he meaneth by them. And then ſo to allege them with their dew expoſicion accordingly. But that, becauſe he neuer vſed to do with S. auſt. nor S. ambroſe, he thought it to late to begyn it with Gelaſius·
For he did better like the firſt ſound of thoſe words after his owne minde, then he did the very meanyng of them, after gelaſius mynde. Wherfore this maiſt thou ſee how very nothing Gelaſius maketh for him, although they were the very woordes of Gelaſius in deede. Therefore what if they bee not his woordes? how then?
               
               
                  HERE.
                  Then ſome where, I muſt needes graunte a faute, if it were ſo. Now be it, I can not beleue that euer Frith wolde alledge them in Gelaſius name, if they were not Gelaſius woordes in deede.

                  Then for a farther triall thereof, I wolde wiſhe the to take ſo muche payne (which were not great) as to reade ouer that notable and worthy booke, intituled, (the aſſercion and defence of the ſacrament of the aulter) made by maiſter doctour Smith of Oxforde a man well known to be of great and famouſe learnyng. Wherin amonge other his good and perfecte ſolutions, to a great ſorte of Frithes hereticall obiections, thou ſhalt fynde one ſolution concernyng this matter, in the .148. leafe of the ſaid booke, where part of the woordes be theſe.
                  
                     For an anſwere here vnto (meanyng Frithes allegacion of Gelaſius) ye ſhall vnderſtand (ſaith he) that this ſaiyng aſcrybed vnto Gelaſius, beynge of this ſorte as it is, is neyther founde in anie of the woorkes reputed and taken for the trew and vndoubted woorkes of Gelaſius, nor yet it is ſo redde in the ſayd booke, intituled, Antidotum contra hereſes, as here in this obiection it is deduced, like as it ſhall manifeſtly appere vnto the reader therof, conferrynge them both together. And vndoubtedly amonges learned catholyke men, it is conſtantly beleued, that this ſaiyng of Gelaſius, as it is here deduced, is falſly aſcrybed vnto gelaſius, and counterfet by the lutherians, who (for the maintenance of their falſe errour and naughtie opinion or hereſy, beyng that with the very trew body and blood of Chriſte, there remaineth materiall breadde and materiall wine) haue ſo contriued the matter, that where in all Gelaſius woorkes, there can not be founde any one ſaiynge after this ſort, they haue yet iobbed it in, in an other booke. Ye and to auoyde ſuſpicion of falſhed, and to get them the better credite, they haue put it in the ſayde booke, hauynge an honeſte name, beynge intytuled a tryacle or remedy agaynſte hereſies, thynkynge that in ſuche a booke, hauynge ſuche a title no man will

thinke that any hereſies are planted at all, to be mainteyned in anye wyſe, But that in ſuche a booke all veritees and catholike aſſertions are ſet forth to bee allowed. And that this is very lyke te be as I do ſay, it appereth in maner notoriouſly of it ſelfe, as well for that the ſayde ſaiynge, as here it is deduced, is not (as I ſayde) amonges the other ſaiynges of Gelaſius in his knowne and approued woorkes, as alſo for that no writer (in the ſayd Gelaſius tyme) dyd eyther holde this opinion, ſo aſcribed to gelaſius, nor yet any thynge ſpeaketh in or for the confutacion therof, which vndoubtedly they woulde haue done, in caſe the thynge had bene ſo in deede, as it is deduced and purpoſed for trew, ſemblably as they did the lyke, agaynſte all other errour and hereſies, whiche then dyd ſprynge and were ſowne abrode, eſpecially beyng of ſuch importaunce and weyght as this is of. Moreouer this thyng by the way (good reader) maie be noted to the great confuſion and ſhame of theſe falſifyers and corrupters of bookes (as Fryth is and other alſo of that ſorte) that the ſaiynge of Gelaſius is ſo here reherſed, that a plaine man wolde thinke that Gelaſius had ſo ſayde, as Fryth dooth here brynge him in, and lookyng vpon the boke intituled ANTIDOTVM, out of whiche, the ſaiynge of Gelaſius is extracted, there ſhall ye fynde farre otherwyſe. Ye and moreouer, the thynge whiche ye ſhall fynde there, in the foreſayde booke, it is ſo corrupted, that ye can not (as it is there) make any ſentence of it. &amp;c.
                  
                  Now theſe wordes of this great learned mannes ſettynge foorth, with the reſte that folowe in the ſame place, if thou woldeſt thorowly reade, peruſe, and well way them with indifferent iudgement, thou ſhouldeſt eaſyly perceyue, whether there be ſo muche as anye lykelyhood that thoſe pretended woordes of Gelaſius be Gelaſius woordes in deede, or no. Therfore if they be not what doth Fryth get by them? Of the other ſide, if they were his woordes as Fryth doth ſay they be, yet

well and trewly, waied, conſidered and with reaſon vnderſtande, thou ſhouldeſt fynde (as it doth now already appere) that they make not onely nothynge for him, but alſo rather, euen cleane agaynſt him. Wherfore, ſith (as I told the at the fyrſt) that all frithes purpoſe in the olde holy doctours, was no more but only to get ſome colour of, or by ſuch certein ſaiynges of theirs, as he could &amp; did pyke out, to make it (as it were by them) ſeme that his vnderſtandynge of thoſe places of ſcripture, whiche he doth meddle with all, could not be but trew, pretending that they were to bee taken in the ſame onely ſenſe that he did put them for. And againe ſith it is now proued, that the chiefe of all thoſe places of the holy fathers, whiche he did ſo pyke out, and moſte truſted vpon, he did but falſely vnderſtande after his own blinde phanſy, and not after their mindes, but far otherwyſe and clean contrary to their meanynges, as it hath moſt plainly apered, euen by the teſtimony of their owne ſaiynges, which I haue trewly recited vnto the, what folowth herof but this? if his vnderſtanding of thoſe places of ſcripture be trew, thers is falſe. if theirs be trew, his is falſe. And whiche ſhall we take? for both, we can not they be ſo contrary. Therefore becauſe their vnderſtandyng thereof, is well knowne to be ſo trew, that euen he him ſelfe nother did nor durſte deny it, and his vnderſtandyng ſo falſe, that all the colour and craft he could ſet apon it, is not able to defend nor hide it, who is ſo blind, weywarde, and wylfull, as, notwithſtandynge al this, will yet truſt or beleue him? any other but ſuche, as paſſeth not muche, whether they go to god or the diuel? wherefore, if the dew conſideracion hereof, be not enoughe

to a certayne thee, that he was but a falſe and a wicked teacher of errour and Hereſye, it ſhalbe enoughe to a certen me, that thou arte but a man intractable, and full of inſatiabilite. And therfore more of me now, thou getteſt not at thys time.

                  In that ye haue ſo ſpiced your talke, wyth ſuche obſcure wordes and ſtraynge termes at many tymes, yt I cannot tell what ye meane by them.

                  Why diddeſt thou not tell me ſo then, when I dyd ſpeake them and was in hande wyth them?
               
               
                  HERE.
                  I thought I wolde not let your purpoſe ſo muche, but wolde and did rather herken, whervpon ye wolde reſt in the ende.

                  Then, why fyndeſt thou more faute with any obſcuritee or ſtrayngeneſſe of my wordes, then thou doeſt wyth any of Frithes wordes? for he vſeth as ſtraynge wordes as I do, and more ſtraynge to. For in the .42. leafe of hys booke, thus he ſayeth.
                  What neede he (meanynge Saint Auſten) to make theſe, woordes and Antitheſies, but becauſe. &amp;c.
                  Now what vnderſtandeſt thou by thys worde antitheſies? Canſt thou tell what it meaneth?
                  And agayne in the .52. leafe, where alſo he ſayeth.
                  It muſt be, Ratione poroſitatis vt in igne &amp; ferro, nam penetrationem dimentionum nunquam probabit.
                  
                  This, he doth not ſo muche, as expreſſe, or turne into englyſhe. how be it that was perchaunce becauſe his ignorant diſciples ſhould thinke him the greater clarke. for ſome there be, that, the leſſe they vnderſtand of what ſo euer they heare, the better lerned iudge they him, which is the ſpeker. But notwithſtanding, if he had put foorth the very engliſhe of it, as it had bene his parte to do, ſith he wryteth in Engliſhe, yet how muche ſhouldeſt thou haue bene the wyſer for that?

                  Euen ſo muche as the vnderſtandyng of that commeth to. For then I ſhould haue known what he meaneth by it.

                  that will I ſee ſtreight way. For the engliſhe of it is this.

                     It muſt be (ſayeth he) by reaſon of porſfite, as in fyet and yron, for penetration of dementions he ſhall neuer proue.
                  
                  Now tell me what he meaneth by it?

                  why for that worde or two, but becauſe thou doeſt not vnderſtande them? And why doeſt thou not vnderſtande them, but becauſe they be to thee, obſcure and ſtraynge as euery thinge is to him that knoweth it not. And therefore ſythe he vſeth wordes and termes, more obſcure and ſtraynge then I do, how come this to paſſe, that thou canneſt not as well away with the obſcurite and ſtrayngeneſſe of my talke full of trewth, as thou canneſt wyth the abſcurite and ſtraygenes of hys talke, full of errour and falſhed? Wherein thys augmenteth my maruell greatlie, that euer thou woldeſt be ſo lyght and ſo raſhe as to chaynge thy faythe in ſo weyghty a matter as thys is, beynge not able (as thou arte not, by thine owne ſayinge) to vnderſtande ſuche conuenient and neceſſary talke therof, as it requireth vpon ſuche occaſion, as Frythe and other Heretikes hath giuen vnto it. Wherefore in thoſe poyntes, whyche thou art ignorant of, truſt nother thy ſelfe, nor yet thoſe, whiche are as blynde as thou arte, or as falſe as Frithe was.
