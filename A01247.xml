            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

Printed for Nicholas Bourne, and are to bee

            Articles agreed vpon, betweene
His Excellence the Prinee of Orange,
and the vanquiſhed Towne of S'Hertogenboſh.
            
               SInce that by the Command of the
Excellent, high, and mighty Prince
of Orange, the Towne of S'hertogenboſh
hath beene this great while beſieged,
and daily furiouſly aſſaulted
and battered; chiefly ſince that the
Gallery by the Vucthter gate hath
beene brought ouer the Ditch, whereby his Excellence
endeuoured by all meanes to get the Halfe-moone
without the Vncthter gate, wherein they of
the Towne had all their truſt and confidence; To
which end, his Excellency had already blowne vp a
Mine. And although the Frenchmen hauing giuen an
Aſſault, and attempted vpon the Towne, they within
had beaten them backe, and forced them to retire,
yet the next day after, being betwixt Sunday and
Munday, the Engliſh and Dutch hauing the Watch
there, haue alſo giuen an aſſault vpon the ſaid Halfe-moone,
and haue taken the ſame by force of Armes;
ſo that they within had no more Trenches or outworkes,
but onely the Walles, into which, by the
continuall battering of the Ordnance, was made ſo

great a breach, that two Waggons together might
well haue paſſed thorow it. And whereas his Princely
Excellence did for the laſt time ſummon them to
yeeld themſelues and warned the Gouernour, that
if he would not in good time hearken to a Compoſition,
that he ſhould take heede to himſelfe, and to all
them that were in the Towne, leſt they might come
in danger of their liues, becauſe his Excellence was
reſolued to aſſault and take the Towne by force, and
way of Armes. The ſaid ſummons cauſed not little
alteration and troubles among the Burgers and Women,
ſo that they ranne with great fury to the Commanders
Houſe: But becauſe the Gouernour would
not hearken vnto their complaints, whereby the ſedition
of the people did continually increaſe, Therefore
the Clergie with the Biſhop, were forced to
come forth themſelues, both to appeaſe the people,
&amp; to moue the Gouernor by their perſwaſions, telling
him, that there reſted no hope for them, of any helpe
or reliefe from abroad, and that within the Towne
there was an infinite number of ſicke and hurt perſons,
and beſides alſo, that they were altogether vnprouided
of warlike Amunition, to make ſufficient
reſiſtance againſt the Forces of the Prince: ſo that
they thought it more neceſſary to parley, and make a
Compoſition with the Prince, then to hazzard and
endanger all their liues.
            By this perſwaſion and requeſt the Gouernour was
induced and content to demand of His Excellence
a ceſſation of Armes for three daies, that in the mean
while, there might bee made ſome good agreement
and compoſition on both ſides. Therefore on the 11.
ſtilo nouo, and the 1. ſtilo veteri, of September, being
Tueſday, there came out of the Towne into the Princes
Quarter, the Deputies, namely, 2. of the Councellours

of the Town, the Brother-in-law of the Gouernour,
and two Monkes, the one a blacke-Frier,
and the other a white-Frier, which did treat, Couenant▪
agree and conclude with the Prince of Orange,
and ſome of the Lords States, on the 13. of September
at night, being Thurſday laſt; theſe Articles as
here doe follow.
            1. Firſt, the ſpirituall or Eccleſtaſticall perſons,
as Fryers, Prieſts, Monkes, ſhall depart out of the
Towne within 6. weekes.
            2. Other religious perſons as Nunnes, and ſuch
Women, ſhall keepe their Cloiſters, and there bee
maintained and well entertained during their liues.
            3. The Towne and the Burgers are to keepe and
be maintained in their Priuiledges: But as for ſuch
as will depart, they ſhall haue liberty for two whole
yeeres next enſuing, to ſell their Houſes and goods at
their profit, according to the agreement of Brede.
            
            4. The Papiſts are to haue liberty of conſcience,
but no publike exerciſe of their religion.
            5. The Souldiers ſhall on Munday next (being the
7. of September) depart out of the Towne, with their
full Armes, burning Matches, Bullets in the mouth,
and with 4. Peeces of Ordnance.
            6. Vpon Friday laſt, the 4 of September, the
Towne was deliuered into the hands and power of
his Excellence, wherefore our Garriſon was receiued
into the Towne, and doe now keepe watch &amp; guard
vpon the Wals, and of the Gates of the Towne: And
on the ſame day there hath alſo beene deliuered into
the hands of his Excellence the Pettler Sconce, and
receiued and kept with his Garriſon.
            7. The Gouernor ſhall be conuoyed to Breda.
            
            8. Thoſe of the Towne haue required, that they
may haue a Gouernour of the Houſe of Naſſaw, which
hath beene granted vnto them.
            
               
               Louing Reader, this is that which in the Treatie, (ſo
much as is deliuered vnto vs) hath beene agreed vpon.
Wherefore we can not enough praiſe and thanke the good
Almighty God, for the great and worthy Victory, which
he hath giuen vs in deſpight of all our Enemies.
            
            
               The Lord God bleſſe and preſerue with all happineſſe,
the Excellent, high and mighty Prince, the Prince of
Orange, His Excellencie, Count Erneſt, and the high
and mighty Lords, the States, and all true maintainers
of his holy Word. Amen.
