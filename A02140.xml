            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

Insomuch that my principles grew authenticall, and I so famous, that had I not beene crost by those two peeuish Pamphlets, I might at the nexte Midsommer haue worne Doctor Stories cappe for a fauor. For I trauelled almost throughout all England, admired for my ingenious capacitie: till comming about Exceter, I began to exercise my art, and drawing in a Tanner for a tame Conie, assoone as he had lost two shillings he made this replie. Sirha, although you haue a liuery on your backe, and a cognisance to countenance you withall, and beare the port of a Gentleman, yet I see you are a false knaue and a Conny-catcher, and this your companion your setter, and that before you and I part Ile proue.
            At these wordes Conny-catcher and Setter, I was driuen into as great a maze, as if one had dropt out of the clowds, to heare a pesant cant the wordes of art belōging to our trade: yet I set a good face on the matter and asked him what he ment by Cony-catching. Marry (q. he) althogh it is your practise, yet I haue for 3. pence bought a litle Pamphlet, that hath taught me to smoke such a couple of knaues as you be. When I heard him talke of smoaking, my heart waxed cold, and I began to gather into him gently. No no sir (q. he) you cānot verse vpon me, this booke hath taught me to beware of cros-biting:

And so to be breefe he vsed me curteously, and that night causd the Constable to lodge mee in prison, &amp; the nexte morning I was carried before the Iustice, where likewise he had this cursed book of Cony catching, so that hee could tel the secretes of mine art better then my selfe: whereupon after strict examination I was sent to the gaole, &amp; at the Sessions by good hap &amp; some friend that my money procured mee, I was deliuered. Assoone as I was at liberty, I got one of these bookes, &amp; began to tosse it ouer very deuoutly, wherin I found one art so perfectly anotomized, as if he had bene practitioner in our facultie forty winters before: then with a deepe sigh I began to curse this R. G. that had made a publike spoyle of so noble a science, and to exclaime against that palpable asse whoso

But see the sequel, I smoothered my sorrowe in silence, and away I trudged out of Deuonshire, &amp; went towards Cornwal, &amp; comming to a simple Ale-house to lodge, I found at a square table hard by the fire halfe a doozen countrie Farmars at cardes. The sight of these penny-fathers at play, draue me straight into a pleasant passion, to blesse fortune that had offred such sweet opportunity to exercise my wits, &amp; fil my purse with crowns: for I coūted all the mony they had, mine by proper interest. As thus I stood looking on them playing at cros-ruffe, one was taken reuoking, whereat the other said, what neighbour wil you play the cony-catcher with vs? no no, wee haue read the booke as wel as you. Neuer went a cup of small beare so sorowfully down an Ale-knights belly in a frosty morning as that word stroke to my hart, so that for feare of trouble I was fain to try my good hap a

The nature of the Setter, is to draw anie person familiarly to drinke with him, which person they call the conie, and their method is according to the man they aime at: if a gentleman, marchant, or apprentice, the cony is the more easily caught, in that they are soone induced to plaie, and therefore I omit the circumstance which they vse in catching of them. And because the poore countrie farmer or yeoman is the mark which they most of all shoote at, who they know comes not empty to the Terme. I will discouer the meanes they put in practise to bring in some honest, simple, and ignorant mē to their purpose. The coni-catchers apparelled like honest ciuel Gentlemen, or good fellowes, with a smooth face, as if butter would not melt in their mouths, after dinner when the clients are come from Westminster hall, and are at leasure to walke vp and downe Pauls, Fléet stréet, Holborne, the strond, and such common hanted places, where these coos

Gramercie for this trick saith the cony, ile dominere with this amōg my neighbors Thus do the verser and the setter seem frendly to the Cony, offering him no shew of cosenage, nor once to drawe him in for a pint of wine, the more to shadow their villanie, but now begins the sport: as thus they sit tipling comes the Barnacle &amp; thrustes open the dore, looking into the room where they are, and as one bashful steps back againe saying, I cry you mercie gentlemen, I thought a frend of mine had been here, pardon my boldnes: no harm saith the verser, I pray you drink a cup of wine with vs and welcome: in comes the barnacle, and taking the cup, drinks to the cony, and then saith, what at cards gentlemen? wer it not I should be offensiue to the companie, I would play for a pinte til my frend come I look for. Why sir saith the verser, if you wil sit down you shalbe taken vp for a quarte of wine: with al my heart saith the barnacle, what wil you play at, Primero, primo visto, Sant, one and thirtie, new cut, or what shalbe the game? Sir saith the verser I am but an ignorant man at cards, &amp; you haue them at your fingers end, ile play with you at a game that hath no deceit, called mumchance at cards, and it is thus: you shal shufle, and ile cut, you shal cal one card, and this honest yeoman shal cal another for me, and which of our cards comes first shal win, here you see is no deceit, and at this ile play. No truely saith the Conie, me thinkes there can be no great craft in this. Wel saith the barnacle for a pint of wine haue at you: so they play as before, fiue vp, and the verser winnes. This is hard luck saith the barnacle, and I beléeue the honest man spies some card in the bottom, therefore I will make this, alwaies to prick the

bottom card: content saith the verser: and the cony to cloake the matter saith
                  •

                he sweareth tis but his il luck, and he can sée no deceit in it, therfore he wil play xii.d. a cut. The verser in cō
               tent, and wins ii. or iii. s. of the barnacle, whereat he chafes and saith, I came bether in an il houre, but ile win my monie again, or lose al in my purse, with that he draws out a purs with some thrée or four pound and claps on the boord: the verser asketh the conie secretlie by signes if he wil be his halfe, he saies yea, and straight séekes for his purse. The Barnacle shufles the cardes throwlie, and the verser cuts as before, the barnacle, when hee hath drawen one card saith, ile either winne something or lose something, therfore ile vie and reuie euerie card at my pleasure til either yours or mine come out, therfore xii.d. vpon this card, my card comes first. No saith the verser, and saith the Connie I durst laie xii.d. more. I hold it saith the barnacle: so they vi

At last to whet on the conie he striketh his chopt card and winneth a good stake: away with the witch cries the barnacle, I hope the cards wil turne at last. Much thinks the conie, twas but a chance you askt so right one of the fiue that was cut off, there was fourtie to one on my side, and ile haue you on the lurch anon.

Then hée

Therefore wil I presently acquaint you with the signification of the tearmes in a table. But leauing them til time and place, comming downe Turnmill stréet the other day, I met one whom I suspected a connycatcher, I drew him on to the tauern, and after a cup of wine or two, I talkt with him of the manner of his life, and tolde him I was sory for his frendes sake, that he tooke so bad a course as to liue vpon the spoyle of poore men, and specially to deserue the name of conny-catching, disswading him from that base kind of life, that was so ignominious in the world, and so lothsome in the sight of God, Tut sir, quoth he, calling me by my name, as my religion is small, so my deuotion is lesse, I leaue God to be disputed on by diuines, the two ends I aime at, are gain &amp; ease, but by what honest gaines I may get, neuer comes within the compasse of my thoughtes.

Think you some lawyers coulde be such purchasers if al their pleas were short, and their procéedinges iustice and conscience? that offices would be so dearely bought, and the buyer so soon enriched, if they counted not pillage an honest kinde of purchase? or think you that men of handy trades make all their commodities without falshood, when so many of them are become daily purchasers? nay what wil you more? who so hath not some sinister way to help

Whereupon the woman let him goe: but as soone as the Collier was out of dores, it was needelesse to byd him runne, for downe he gets to his Bote and away he thrustes from Billinsgate, and so immediately went downe to Wapping, and neuer o

As soone as she saw her coles, shee easily ghessed there was scarce sixe bushels, yet dissembling the matter, she payd him for them and bad him bring her two sacks more. The Collier went his way, and in the meane time the Flax-wife measured the coles, and there was iust fiue bushels &amp; a peck. Hereupon she cald in her neighbors, being a company of women that before time had also been pincht in their coles, and shewed them the cosenage, and desired their aide to her in tormenting the Collier, which they promist to performe: and thus it fell out. She conueyed them into a backe roome (some sixteen of them) euerie one hauing a good cudgell vnder her apron, straight comes the Collier and saith, Mistres here be your coles: welcome good Collier (quoth shee) I praie thee follow me into the backe side, &amp; shoot them in another roome. The Collier was content and went with her, but as soone as he was in, the good wife lockt the doore and the Collier seeing such a

This sentence being pronounced, she rose vp, &amp; gaue no respit of time for the execution, but according to the sentence before expressed, all the women fell vpon him, beating him extreamly, among whom he lent some lustie buffets, but might ouercomes right, and therefore Ne Hercules contra duos.
